(Sweden)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAddress by The Honourable Chandrika\r\nBandaranaike Kumaratunga, President of the\r\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Democratic Socialist\r\nRepublic of Sri Lanka.\r\nThe Honourable Chandrika Bandaranaike\r\nKumaratunga, President of the Democratic\r\nSocialist Republic of Sri Lanka, was escorted into\r\nthe General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations Her Excellency The Honourable Chandrika\r\nBandaranaike Kumaratunga, President of the\r\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, and to\r\ninvite her to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Kumaratunga: I extend to you, Sir,\r\nour warmest congratulations as you assume the high\r\noffice of the President of the General Assembly at its\r\nsixtieth session. We wish you all the best and assure\r\nyou of Sri Lankas support and cooperation in your\r\nwork. I convey gratitude to Mr. Jean Ping for his astute\r\nleadership of the fifty-ninth session.\r\nThis sixtieth landmark session of the General\r\nAssembly is doubly significant for Sri Lanka, as this\r\nyear we mark the fiftieth anniversary of our\r\nmembership in the United Nations. As a small nation\r\nthat has kept the flame of democracy burning through\r\nmany tribulations, we take modest pride in the fact that\r\nwhat we said at the first session of the General\r\nAssembly we addressed can still be recalled with\r\nundiminished relevance. Prime Minister Bandaranaike,\r\nrepresenting Sri Lanka, said on that occasion:\r\nThis is an Organization which expresses itself\r\nmost effectively by bringing to bear a certain\r\nmoral force  the collective moral force and\r\ndecency of human beings. That is a task in which\r\nthe weak as well as the strong can render a useful\r\nservice, and I give the Assembly the assurance,\r\non behalf of my country, that as far as we are\r\nconcerned, every endeavour that we can make in\r\nall sincerity to assist in the achievements of those\r\nnoble ideals for which this Organization stands\r\nwill always be forthcoming in the fullest\r\nmeasure. (Official Records of the General\r\nAssembly, Eleventh Session, Plenary Meetings,\r\n590th meeting, para. 42)\r\nFive decades on, I have the pleasure to say that\r\nmy country has kept that promise by regularly\r\ncontributing to consensus-building in the Organization\r\nin areas ranging from the law of the sea to\r\ndisarmament and from human rights to the issue of\r\nterrorism. We remain fully committed to the United\r\nNations.\r\nWe continue to believe that the collective moral\r\nforce of this Organization is indispensable for a secure,\r\npeaceful and humane world. We are convinced that\r\nsuch a world can be realized through the honest\r\ncommitment of every Member State to its individual\r\n2\r\nA/60/PV.10\r\nand collective responsibilities. Our peoples live in the\r\nhope and expectation that we shall deliver.\r\nOn the morning of 26 December 2004, Sri Lanka\r\nand several other countries around the Indian Ocean\r\nregion woke up to a natural disaster of unprecedented\r\nmagnitude. Towering tsunami waves struck two thirds\r\nof the coastal areas of our island nation, leaving in its\r\nwake death and destruction on a scale hitherto\r\nunknown by the world. Moved by the enormous scale\r\nof that calamity, Governments, the United Nations and\r\nother international organizations, civil society\r\norganizations and countless well-wishers across the\r\nworld rushed to help my country and its people to\r\nrecover, rehabilitate and rebuild. It was a magnificent\r\ngesture of human solidarity. Citizens of the world\r\nreached out beyond the confines of geopolitical and\r\nother man-made barriers in one magnificent gesture of\r\nhuman generosity. That rekindled in us new confidence\r\nin the power of peoples acting in unison across the\r\nworld to move Governments to act in the best interests\r\nof humankind for a new and better world.\r\nOn behalf of my people and my Government, I\r\nwish to convey my profound appreciation and gratitude\r\nto all those who assisted and sympathized with us and\r\ncontributed generously to rebuild our country. Let me\r\ntake this opportunity to extend a special word of thanks\r\nto President Clinton, the United Nations Special Envoy\r\nfor Tsunami Recovery, for his commitment and\r\nleadership in coordinating the ongoing international\r\neffort for sustainable recovery.\r\nJust as my country was in national distress in the\r\naftermath of the tsunami disaster, we are now in\r\ndistress in the face of an ominous renewal of terror on\r\nour soil. One month ago, my dear colleague Lakshman\r\nKadirgamar, the Foreign Minister of Sri Lanka, was\r\nassassinated by a calculated and barbaric act of\r\nterrorism. One more hero who fought relentlessly for\r\nfreedom and justice has been felled by the enemies of\r\npeace and unity. As Foreign Minister, the late\r\nMr. Kadirgamar argued powerfully and worked\r\ntirelessly against extremist racist ideologies that\r\nemploy violence to gain their divisive objectives. He\r\nwas bold enough to expose to the world the true face of\r\nterrorism inflicted upon my country. For 11 long years,\r\nfrom this very podium, Mr. Kadirgamar warned the\r\nAssembly about the threat posed by terrorism to the\r\ndemocratic way of life, not only in Sri Lanka but\r\nacross the world.\r\nFor over two decades, Sri Lanka has been under\r\nsustained assault by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil\r\nEelam (LTTE), an armed group that employs brutal\r\nmethods and suicide bombings in its campaign of terror\r\nto obtain a separate State. Disregarding the\r\nimplementation of the ceasefire agreement, that group\r\ncontinues to engage in numerous illegal and terrorist\r\nactivities. Those include the conscription of children as\r\nsoldiers  in callous disregard for promises given to\r\nmany, including the Special Representative of the\r\nSecretary-General on Children and Armed Conflict \r\nand the assassination of democratic opponents, as part\r\nof their policy of eliminating Tamil political leaders\r\nand human rights activists, with disdain for all\r\ninternational law and practice and despite sustained\r\nefforts by my Government and Norwegian facilitators.\r\nI tend to doubt that the Security Councils recent\r\nidentification of that group in connection with child\r\nconscription would suffice to deter such activities.\r\nTargeted sanctions such as those proposed by\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan in his report to the\r\nSecurity Council should be imposed on those armed\r\ngroups that undermine national and international peace\r\nand violate human rights.\r\nI firmly believe that terrorism cannot be\r\neliminated through military suppression by State\r\nmachinery. The socio-economic and cultural roots of a\r\nconflict must be sought and effectively redressed. We\r\nrecognize that a lasting solution to ethnic issues and to\r\nterrorism in my country, or anywhere else, can only be\r\nfound through negotiation and dialogue. Accordingly,\r\nmy Government was the first, in 1994, to offer a\r\nnegotiated settlement in place of an armed conflict, as\r\nwell as an extensive devolution of power instead of a\r\nseparate State. In February 2002, the Government\r\nentered into a ceasefire agreement with the rebel group\r\nand began talks, with the facilitation of the\r\nGovernment of Norway.\r\nHowever, two and a half years ago, the LTTE\r\nwalked away from the peace talks for the sixth time in\r\n18 years. All efforts to have the talks renewed have so\r\nfar failed. As a measure of good will after the tsunami\r\ndisaster struck us, I agreed to an arrangement with the\r\nrebels for joint action in tsunami reconstruction work.\r\nThat was yet another measure in a long series of efforts\r\nto engage and work with the rebels, particularly in\r\nhumanitarian ventures, despite their obdurate\r\ninsistence to remain armed and remain uncontested by\r\nany other democratic Tamil political party.\r\n3\r\nA/60/PV.10\r\nMy Government has reaffirmed its commitment\r\nto the ceasefire and the peace talks. We continue to do\r\nall that is required by a democratic Government to\r\nensure that we do not return to armed conflict,\r\nfulfilling the wishes of all our people.\r\nA peace process cannot, and does not, operate in\r\na vacuum. People demand that a process of peace\r\nshould include the commitment and good conduct of\r\nall parties to a conflict. When a belligerent group  a\r\nnon-State actor  exploits the unique position offered\r\nto it by a peace process to utilize the freedom\r\nguaranteed under a democratic system of governance to\r\nstrengthen itself through infiltration and the coercion\r\nof civilians, organizations and political parties, that\r\nimpinges seriously on the ability of an elected\r\nGovernment to move forward effectively in its efforts\r\nat reconciliation and peace.\r\nThe restoration of democracy, the creation of\r\nspace for dissent and the promotion of human rights in\r\nthe affected areas in the north and the east of our\r\ncountry are now essential prerequisites for a successful\r\nand meaningful peace process in Sri Lanka. A lasting\r\npolitical solution can come to fruition only when the\r\nrebel group becomes a democratic civilian\r\norganization. That deserves the fullest support of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nAs we have been for many long years, Sri Lanka\r\nremains firmly committed to the global endeavour to\r\nfight terrorism in all its aspects. No cause justifies the\r\nindiscriminate unleashing of terror upon the innocent.\r\nSri Lanka has accordingly signed and ratified all\r\nUnited Nations conventions aimed at combating\r\nterrorism. We earnestly hope that at this session it will\r\nbe possible to conclude work on the comprehensive\r\nconvention on international terrorism, in order to\r\ncomplete and strengthen the international legal\r\nframework to combat terrorism through collective\r\nmeasures. Sri Lanka will continue to provide its\r\ncontribution to facilitate a consensus in its capacity as\r\nChair of the United Nations Ad Hoc Committee on this\r\nsubject.\r\nSri Lanka has pledged to meet the United Nations\r\nMillennium Development Goals by the year 2015. We\r\nhave already achieved the targeted goals in primary\r\neducation and in infant and maternal mortality. We are\r\ncommitted to further promoting the political and\r\neconomic empowerment of women so that gender\r\nequality becomes a matter of human rights and social\r\njustice.\r\nOur National Child Protection Authority\r\nimplements many programmes to eliminate abuse and\r\nviolence against children and to ensure their protection\r\nas well as their right to freely enjoy lifes most\r\nprecious gift, childhood. Our success is due to the\r\noutcome of sustained efforts in policy planning and\r\nimplementation.\r\nThose benchmarks and other indicators\r\nmanifesting the high physical quality of life enjoyed by\r\nour people will be further elevated as we strive to meet\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals by 2015. However,\r\npoverty remains a major challenge for us. To eradicate\r\nthis scourge, we are now taking further steps through\r\nthe adoption of economic and social programmes, in\r\ncooperation with our bilateral and multilateral\r\ndevelopment partners.\r\nIf we look at the current world health situation,\r\nalthough smallpox has been eradicated and polio is on\r\nthe verge of being eliminated, there are other\r\ndiseases  often associated with poverty  that\r\ncontinue to take a heavy human toll, especially in\r\ndeveloping countries. Every year, 6 million children\r\ndie from malnutrition before their fifth birthday. More\r\nthan 50 per cent of people in Africa suffer from water-\r\nrelated diseases such as cholera. HIV/AIDS kills 6,000\r\npeople every day. Each year, more than 300 million\r\npeople are infected with malaria. New challenges, such\r\nas severe acute respiratory syndrome and avian\r\ninfluenza, indicate that national borders offer little\r\nprotection against such proliferating pandemics. In the\r\nface of unparalleled advances, both in technology and\r\nin human mobility, it is unconscionable to let some in\r\nour nations suffer from diseases that can be controlled,\r\nif not eliminated.\r\nIn my view, there are three evils plaguing our\r\nworld today that can have no place in the modern\r\nglobalizing era of the twenty-first century: poverty,\r\ndisease and terrorism. Today, these evils affect the\r\nsocial, cultural and economic well-being of a majority\r\nof humankind. No country can deal with them on its\r\nown. International cooperation is in our self-interest\r\nand needs to be mustered. We share the strong belief\r\nthat the United Nations, on the occasion of its sixtieth\r\nanniversary, should seriously undertake comprehensive\r\nreforms so that the Organization is fully equipped to\r\n4\r\nA/60/PV.10\r\nmeet new challenges, taking into account the current\r\nglobal realities.\r\nWe acknowledge with appreciation the valuable\r\ncontribution made by the Secretary-General and his\r\nteam to the ongoing reform process, which made\r\npossible the adoption of the outcome document\r\n(resolution 60/1) at the recent summit of the\r\nOrganization. We urge all Member States to work\r\ntogether to build on that framework in order to\r\noperationalize what has been agreed and to work\r\nfurther on what remains to be achieved.\r\nRecovery after the tsunami disaster taught us the\r\nvalue and potential of humanity acting in unison when\r\nfellow human beings are in distress. We now hope that\r\nthe same human spirit and common interests will\r\ncontinue to prevail in addressing the socio-economic\r\nand security challenges we face. Let us resolve to\r\ncommit ourselves collectively, on this solemn occasion\r\nof the sixtieth anniversary of the Organization, to act\r\ntogether in the interest of humankind in order that we\r\nmay strive to eliminate the three scourges of poverty,\r\ndisease and terrorism.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the\r\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the\r\nstatement she has just made.\r\nMs. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga,\r\nPresident of the Democratic Socialist Republic of\r\nSri Lanka, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: Before giving the floor to the\r\nnext speaker, I should like briefly to draw the attention\r\nof members to matters concerning the maintenance of\r\norder in the General Assembly Hall. There have been\r\nseveral instances of cellular telephones ringing in the\r\nHall while the meeting has been in progress. That\r\ninterferes, as members have noticed, with the orderly\r\nproceedings of the meeting. I therefore strongly urge\r\nmembers to turn off their cellular telephones or to keep\r\nthem in silent mode while they are in the General\r\nAssembly Hall. I also request that representatives\r\nmove quietly through the aisles as they enter and exit\r\nthe Hall so as not to disturb the representative who has\r\nthe floor and that they keep conversations to the level\r\nof a whisper. I rely on all those present to cooperate in\r\nmaintaining order and quiet in the Hall, not least in\r\nrespect for our speakers.\r\nAddress by Mr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, President\r\nof the Islamic Republic of Iran\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Islamic Republic of\r\nIran.\r\nMr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, President of the\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad,\r\nPresident of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and to invite\r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Ahmadinejad (spoke in Farsi; English\r\ntext provided by the delegation): Today, we have\r\ngathered here to exchange views about the world, its\r\nfuture and our common responsibilities towards it. It is\r\nobvious that the future of the world is intertwined with\r\nits current state and with the prevailing trends, which\r\nexhibit signs of hope and despair.\r\nOn the one hand, certain hopes and opportunities\r\nexist, and the General Assembly is convened on the\r\nbasis of those hopes. Today, human thought reflects\r\nsignificant commonalities that provide an appropriate\r\nfoundation upon which to build. With the passing of\r\nthe era of agnostic philosophies, humanity is once\r\nagain united in celebrating monotheism and belief in\r\nthe Creator as the originator of existence. That is the\r\ncommon thread that binds us all together. Faith will\r\nprove to be the solution to many of todays problems.\r\nThe truth will shine the light of faith and ethics on the\r\nlives of human beings; it will prevent them from\r\nengaging in aggression, coercion and injustice; and it\r\nwill guide them towards care and compassion for\r\nfellow beings.\r\nAnother hope is found in the common global\r\nappreciation of the sources of knowledge. Although\r\nreason, experience and science are among the valuable\r\nsources of knowledge, the darkness of the Middle Ages\r\nprevented major portions of the Western world from\r\nappreciating them. This reactionary tendency deprived\r\nmany of access to various scientific findings and\r\nknowledge and led to the exclusion of other sources of\r\nknowledge, namely God and knowledge based on\r\nrevelation from the life of human beings in the West \r\ndivine knowledge that was disseminated by such\r\nprophets as Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus and\r\n5\r\nA/60/PV.10\r\nMohammad. Today, agnostic thinking is on the decline\r\nand humanity is equally enamoured of religion,\r\nscience, knowledge and spirituality. This is an\r\nauspicious beginning.\r\nDivine prophets teach us about proper regard for\r\nthe exalted state of human beings on earth. The human\r\nbeing is blessed with dignity, manifested most\r\nimportantly in being the viceroy of the Almighty on\r\nearth. The Almighty placed humans on earth to develop\r\nit, to institutionalize justice, to overcome their egoistic\r\ntendencies and to praise no lord but the Almighty.\r\nFaith and good deeds can bring deliverance and the\r\ngood life, even in this world. Attaining this depend on\r\nhuman will, that is, the will of each and every one of\r\nus. We must heed the call of our common primordial\r\nnature and achieve the realization of this good life.\r\nOn the other hand, the prevalence of military\r\ndomination; increasing poverty; the growing gap\r\nbetween rich and poor countries; violence as a means\r\nto resolve crises; the spread of terrorism, especially\r\nState terrorism; the existence and proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction; the pervasive lack of\r\nhonesty in inter-State relations; and disregard for the\r\nequal rights of peoples and nations in international\r\nrelations constitute some of the challenges and threats\r\nfacing us.\r\nAlthough these challenges are very real, we\r\nbelieve we are not predestined to experience them. Our\r\ncommon will not only can change this course but, in\r\nfact, can lead us to a life filled with hope and\r\nprosperity. Divine revelation teaches us that\r\nThe Almighty changes the fate of no people\r\nunless they themselves show a will for change\r\n(The Holy Koran, XIII:11).\r\nHow can we influence the future of the world?\r\nWhen and how will peace, tranquillity and well-being\r\nfor all come about? These are the fundamental\r\nquestions before us.\r\nWe believe that a sustainable order  in which\r\npeace and tranquillity can flourish  can be realized\r\nonly on the basis of the two pillars of justice and\r\nspirituality. The more human society departs from\r\njustice and spirituality, the greater the insecurity it will\r\nface, so much so that a relatively small crisis  such\r\nas a natural disaster  can lead to various aberrations\r\nand inhumane behaviour.\r\nUnfortunately, the world is rife with\r\ndiscrimination and poverty. Discrimination produces\r\nhatred, war and terrorism. They all share the common\r\nroot of a lack of spirituality coupled with injustice.\r\nJustice is about equal rights; the equitable\r\ndistribution of resources in the territories of different\r\nStates; the equality of all before the law; and respect\r\nfor international agreements. Justice recognizes the\r\nright of all to tranquillity, peace and a dignified life.\r\nJustice rejects intimidation and double standards. As\r\nthe eminent daughter of the Prophet of Islam said,\r\nJustice brings tranquillity to our hearts.\r\nToday, the world longs for the establishment of\r\nsuch justice. If humanity heeds the call of its\r\nprimordial nature with firm resolve, justice will follow.\r\nThat is what the Almighty has promised and what all\r\npeople of goodwill from all religions are waiting for. If\r\nthe prevailing discourse of global relations becomes\r\none of justice and spirituality, then durable peace will\r\nbe guaranteed.\r\nConversely, if international relations are defined\r\nwithout justice or spirituality and are void of moral\r\nconsiderations, then mechanisms for promoting\r\nconfidence and peace will remain insufficient and\r\nineffective.\r\nIf some, relying on their superior military and\r\neconomic might, attempt to expand their rights and\r\nprivileges, they will be performing a great disservice to\r\nthe cause of peace and, in fact, will fuel the arms race\r\nand spread insecurity, fear and deception. If global\r\ntrends continue to serve the interests of small,\r\ninfluential groups, even the interests of the citizens of\r\npowerful countries will be jeopardized, as was seen\r\nduring recent crises and natural disasters such as the\r\nrecent tragedy of Hurricane Katrina.\r\nToday my nation calls on other nations and\r\nGovernments to move forward towards a durable\r\ntranquillity and peace based on justice and spirituality.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran was born of a\r\nmovement based on the pure, primordial nature of a\r\npeople who rose up to regain their dignity, esteem and\r\nhuman rights. The Islamic revolution toppled a regime\r\nwhich had been put in place through a coup and that\r\nwas being supported by those who claim to be\r\nadvocates of democracy and human rights. For 25\r\nyears they thwarted the aspirations of the nation to\r\ndevelopment and progress through the intimidation and\r\n6\r\nA/60/PV.10\r\ntorture of the population and submission and\r\nsubservience to outsiders.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran is the manifestation\r\nof true democracy in the region. The discourse of the\r\nIranian nation is focused on respect for the rights of\r\nhuman beings and on a quest for tranquillity, peace,\r\njustice and development for all through monotheism.\r\nFor eight years, Saddams regime imposed a\r\nmassive war of aggression and occupation on my\r\npeople. It employed the most heinous weapons of mass\r\ndestruction  including chemical weapons  against\r\nIranians and Iraqis alike. But who, in fact, armed\r\nSaddam with those weapons? What was the reaction of\r\nthose who now claim to fight against weapons of mass\r\ndestruction to the use of chemical weapons back then?\r\nThe world is witness to the fact that the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran, because of its humanitarian\r\nprinciples  even during the most trying of times and\r\nwhen it was sustaining the highest number of\r\ncasualties  never allowed itself to use such weapons.\r\nThousands of nuclear warheads stockpiled in various\r\nlocations, coupled with programmes to further develop\r\nthese inhuman weapons, have created a new\r\natmosphere of repression and the rule of the machines\r\nof war, threatening the international community and\r\neven the citizens of the countries that possess them.\r\nIronically, those that have actually used nuclear\r\nweapons and continue to produce, stockpile and\r\nextensively test such weapons; that have used depleted\r\nuranium bombs and bullets against tens, perhaps\r\nhundreds, of thousands of Iraqis and Kuwaitis, and\r\neven their own soldiers and those of their allies,\r\nafflicting them with incurable diseases; that blatantly\r\nviolate their obligations under the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT); that have\r\nrefrained from signing the Comprehensive Nuclear-\r\nTest-Ban Treaty (CTBT); and that have armed the\r\nZionist occupation regime with weapons of mass\r\ndestruction  they are not only refusing to remedy\r\ntheir past actions, but, in clear breach of the NPT, are\r\ntrying to prevent other countries from acquiring the\r\ntechnology necessary to produce nuclear energy for\r\npeaceful purposes.\r\nAll of these problems emanate from the fact that\r\nthe elements of justice and spirituality are missing in\r\nthe way powerful Governments conduct their affairs\r\nwith other nations.\r\nAfter 11 September, a particular radical group\r\nwas accused of terrorist activities, although it was\r\nnever explained how such huge intelligence-gathering\r\nand security organizations had failed to prevent such\r\nan extensive and well-planned operation.\r\nWhy have Powers that not so long ago were\r\nsupporting the activities of such groups in Afghanistan,\r\nthereby portraying themselves as supporters of human\r\nrights and of the Afghan people, overnight turned into\r\ntheir most fierce critics? Are we to believe that their\r\nbenefactors  those very same hegemonic Powers \r\nhave lost control? If so, would it not be better for those\r\nPowers to adopt an honest and transparent approach to\r\nthe international community, provide precise\r\ninformation about the main elements and their weapons\r\nand financial support system, and accept responsibility\r\nfor their inhuman actions against nations and countries,\r\nthereby assisting peoples and nations in addressing the\r\nroots of terrorism correctly, wisely and sincerely?\r\nWe must endeavour to achieve sustainable\r\ntranquillity and peace based on justice and spirituality.\r\nTerrorism and weapons of mass destruction are\r\ntwo major threats facing the international community.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran, as one of the main\r\nvictims of terrorism and chemical weapons, fully\r\nappreciates the difficulties involved in combating these\r\nmenaces. Today, the most serious challenge is that the\r\nculprits are assuming the role of the prosecutor. Even\r\nmore dangerous is that certain parties, relying on their\r\npower and wealth, are trying to impose a climate of\r\nintimidation and injustice on the world. They are\r\nbullying others, while using their huge media resources\r\nto portray themselves as defenders of freedom,\r\ndemocracy and human rights.\r\nPeople around the world are fully aware of what\r\nis happening in occupied Palestine. Women and\r\nchildren are being murdered and teenagers are being\r\ntaken prisoner. Houses are being demolished and farms\r\nare being burned down. Yet when the people of\r\nPalestine resist these conditions, they are accused of\r\nterrorism. At the same time, the occupier, which does\r\nnot abide by any principles, terror being part of its\r\nstated and regular policy, enjoys the support of the\r\npreviously mentioned Governments. Let me be still\r\nmore blunt. State terrorism is being supported by those\r\nwho claim to fight terrorism.\r\nHow can one talk about human rights and at the\r\nsame time blatantly deny many people the inalienable\r\n7\r\nA/60/PV.10\r\nright of access to science and technology, which have\r\napplications in the fields of medicine, industrial\r\nproduction and energy, and hinder their progress and\r\ndevelopment by means of force and intimidation? Can\r\nnations be deprived of scientific and technological\r\nprogress through the threat of use of force and on the\r\nbasis of mere allegations of possible military\r\ndiversion? We believe that all countries and nations are\r\nentitled to technological and scientific advancement in\r\nall fields, and particularly to the peaceful technology to\r\nproduce nuclear fuel. Such access cannot be restricted\r\nto a few, depriving most nations and thereby\r\nestablishing economic monopolies which are then used\r\nas an instrument to expand domination.\r\nWe have gathered here to defend human rights in\r\naccordance with the Charter of the United Nations and\r\nto prevent certain Powers from claiming that some\r\ncountries have more rights or that some countries do\r\nnot have the right to enjoy their legitimate rights.\r\nWe must not, at the beginning of the twenty-first\r\ncentury, revert to the logic of the Dark Ages and try\r\nonce again to deny societies access to scientific and\r\ntechnological advances. The United Nations must be\r\nthe symbol of democracy and of the equal rights of\r\nnations. If we talk about the equal rights of nations in\r\npolitical forums, we must talk of the same concept in\r\nthis forum as well. Similarly, if we talk about the right\r\nof sovereignty, then all nations must be allowed to\r\nexercise their rights on an equal footing and in a\r\ndemocratic process.\r\nThe United Nations will be able to be the\r\nstandard-bearer of democracy in the world when it,\r\nitself, is a manifestation of democratic process. I\r\nreiterate that sustainable tranquillity and peace can\r\nonly be built on justice and spirituality.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran is a symbol of true\r\ndemocracy. All officials, including the Leader,\r\nPresident and members of the Islamic Consultative\r\nAssembly, city and village councils are elected through\r\nthe vote of the citizens. The Islamic Republic of Iran\r\nhas held 27 national elections in 27 years. This\r\nshowcases a vibrant and dynamic society in which\r\npeople participate broadly in political life.\r\nBecause of its key importance and influence in\r\nthe important and strategic Middle East region, the\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran is committed to contributing\r\nactively to the promotion of peace and stability in that\r\nregion.\r\nThe Saddam and the Taliban regimes were both\r\nthe products of foreign Powers. The people of\r\nAfghanistan and of Iraq know very well who supported\r\nthose two regimes. Today, to establish peace and\r\nsecurity in the region, foreign occupation forces must\r\nleave and completely hand over the political and\r\neconomic sovereignty of those two countries to their\r\npeoples.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran will continue to\r\nprovide full and comprehensive support to the people\r\nof Iraq and Afghanistan and to their elected\r\nGovernments and will actively help them establish\r\norder and security. My country will continue to expand\r\nits sincere cooperation and interaction with them.\r\nIn Palestine, a sustainable peace will be possible\r\nthrough justice, an end to discrimination, an end to the\r\noccupation of Palestinian land, the return of all\r\nPalestinian refugees and the establishment of a\r\ndemocratic Palestinian State with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as\r\nits capital.\r\nToday, more than ever, nations need constructive,\r\npositive and honest cooperation and interaction in\r\norder to enjoy a dignified, tranquil and peaceful life\r\nbased on justice and spirituality. Let us enter into a\r\ncollective covenant to realize this legitimate aspiration\r\nof our nations.\r\nHere, I should like to talk briefly about the\r\napproach and initiative of the Islamic Republic of Iran\r\non the nuclear issue. Nuclear weapons and their\r\nproliferation, on the one hand, and attempts to impose\r\nan apartheid regime on access to peaceful nuclear\r\nenergy, on the other, are two major threats to\r\ninternational tranquillity and peace.\r\nKeeping in mind that in past years no serious\r\nefforts complemented by practical mechanisms have\r\nbeen made to move towards full disarmament and,\r\nmore specifically, to implement the decisions and\r\noutcomes of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) review conferences of 1995\r\nand 2000, I suggest that the General Assembly, as the\r\nmost inclusive United Nations organ, mandate an ad\r\nhoc committee to compile and submit a comprehensive\r\nreport on possible practical mechanisms and strategies\r\nfor complete disarmament. Such a committee should\r\nalso be asked to investigate how, in violation of the\r\nNPT, material, technology and equipment for nuclear\r\nweapons were transferred to the Zionist regime, and to\r\npropose practical measures for the establishment of a\r\n8\r\nA/60/PV.10\r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. Some\r\npowerful States practise a discriminatory approach\r\nagainst access by NPT States parties to material,\r\nequipment, and peaceful nuclear technology. In doing\r\nso, they intend to impose a nuclear apartheid. We are\r\nconcerned that once certain powerful States completely\r\ncontrol nuclear energy resources and technology, they\r\nwill deny access to other States and thus deepen the\r\ndivide between powerful countries and the rest of the\r\ninternational community. When that happens, we shall\r\nbe divided into light and dark countries.\r\nRegrettably, in the past 30 years, no effective\r\nmeasure has been implemented to facilitate the\r\nexercise of the legally recognized right of NPT States\r\nparties to have access to and to use peaceful nuclear\r\nenergy in accordance with article IV. Therefore, the\r\nGeneral Assembly should ask the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency  in accordance with article II of its\r\nStatute  to report on violations by specific countries\r\nthat have hindered the implementation of the above\r\narticle and also to produce practical strategies for its\r\nrenewed implementation.\r\nIt is particularly important to note that the\r\npeaceful use of nuclear energy without possession of\r\nthe nuclear fuel cycle is an empty proposition.\r\nCountries and peoples that rely for their fuel on\r\ncoercive powers and stop at nothing to further their\r\ninterests may indeed become totally dependent on\r\nnuclear power plants. No popularly elected,\r\nresponsible Government would consider such a\r\nsituation to be in the interest of its people. The history\r\nof dependence on oil in oil-rich countries under\r\ndomination is an experience that no independent\r\ncountry would be willing to repeat.\r\nThose hegemonic Powers that consider the\r\nscientific and technological progress of independent\r\nand free nations to be a challenge to their monopoly on\r\nthose important instruments of power and which do not\r\nwant to see such achievements in other countries, have\r\nmisrepresented Irans healthy and fully safeguarded\r\ntechnological endeavours in the nuclear field as a\r\npursuit of nuclear weapons. That is nothing but a\r\npropaganda ploy. The Islamic Republic of Iran is\r\npresenting in good faith its proposal for constructive\r\ninteraction and a just dialogue. However, if some try to\r\nimpose their will on the Iranian people by resorting to\r\na language of force and threats against Iran, we will\r\nreconsider our entire approach to the nuclear issue.\r\nAllow me, as the elected President of the Iranian\r\npeople, to outline the other main elements of my\r\ncountrys initiative regarding the nuclear issue.\r\nFirst, the Islamic Republic of Iran reaffirms its\r\npreviously and repeatedly stated position that, in\r\naccordance with our religious principles, the pursuit of\r\nnuclear weapons is prohibited.\r\nSecondly, the Islamic Republic of Iran believes\r\nthat it is necessary to revitalize the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and, as I\r\nproposed earlier, to create an ad hoc committee to\r\ncombat nuclear weapons and abolish the apartheid that\r\nexists in the field of peaceful nuclear technology.\r\nThirdly, the fuel cycle of the Islamic Republic of\r\nIran is not technically different from that of other\r\ncountries that have peaceful nuclear technology.\r\nTherefore, as a further confidence-building measure\r\nand in order to provide the greatest degree of\r\ntransparency, the Islamic Republic of Iran is prepared\r\nto engage in serious partnerships with the private and\r\npublic sectors of other countries in the implementation\r\nof a uranium enrichment programme in Iran. That\r\nrepresents the most far-reaching step  beyond all\r\nrequirements of the NPT  proposed by Iran as a\r\nfurther confidence-building measure.\r\nFourthly, in keeping with Irans inalienable right\r\nto have access to a nuclear fuel cycle, continued\r\ninteraction and technical and legal cooperation with the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency will be the\r\ncentrepiece of our nuclear policy. The initiation and the\r\ncontinuation of negotiations with other countries will\r\nbe carried out in the context of Irans interaction with\r\nthe Agency. With that in mind, I have directed the\r\nrelevant Iranian officials to compile the legal and\r\ntechnical details of Irans nuclear approach, based on\r\nthe following considerations.\r\nFirst, international precedent tells us that nuclear\r\nfuel delivery contracts are unreliable, and no legally\r\nbinding international document or instrument exists to\r\nguarantee the delivery of nuclear fuel. On many\r\noccasions such bilateral contracts have either been\r\nsuspended or stopped altogether for political reasons.\r\nTherefore, the Islamic Republic of Iran, in its pursuit\r\nof peaceful nuclear technology, considers it to be\r\nwithin its legitimate rights to receive objective\r\nguarantees for uranium enrichment in the nuclear fuel\r\ncycle.\r\n9\r\nA/60/PV.10\r\nSecondly, in its negotiations with the European\r\nUnion three, Iran has tried in earnest to demonstrate\r\nthe solid and legitimate foundations of its nuclear\r\nactivity in the context of the NPT and to establish\r\nmutual trust. The selection of our negotiating partners\r\nand the continuation of negotiations with the European\r\nUnion three will be commensurate with the\r\nrequirements of our cooperation with the Agency\r\nregarding the non-diversion of the process of uranium\r\nenrichment to non-peaceful purposes, within the\r\nframework of the NPT. In that context, several\r\nproposals have been presented that can be considered\r\nin the context of the negotiations.\r\nThirdly, the discriminatory approach with respect\r\nto the NPT, focusing on the obligations of States\r\nparties while disregarding their rights under the Treaty,\r\nshould cease.\r\nAs the President of the Islamic Republic of Iran, I\r\nassure the Assembly that my country will do\r\neverything in its power to contribute to global\r\ntranquillity and peace, based on the two values of\r\nspirituality and justice, and on the principle of equal\r\nrights of all peoples and nations. My country will\r\ninteract and cooperate constructively with the\r\ninternational community to face the challenges before\r\nus.\r\nFrom the beginning of time, humanity has longed\r\nfor the day when justice, peace, equality and\r\ncompassion would envelop the world. All of us can\r\ncontribute to the establishment of such a world. When\r\nthat day comes, the ultimate promise of all divine\r\nreligions will be fulfilled with the emergence of a\r\nperfect human being who is heir to all prophets and\r\npious men. He will lead the world to justice and\r\nabsolute peace.\r\nAlmighty Lord, I pray to you to hasten the\r\nappearance of your last repository  the promised one,\r\nthat perfect and pure human being, the one who will\r\nfill this world with justice and peace. O Lord, include\r\nus among his companions, followers and those who\r\nserve his cause.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, President of the\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Thabo Mbeki, President of the\r\nRepublic of South Africa\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of South\r\nAfrica.\r\nMr. Thabo Mbeki, President of the Republic of\r\nSouth Africa, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Thabo Mbeki, President of\r\nthe Republic of South Africa, and to invite him to\r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Mbeki: First, I would like to salute\r\nMr. Jean Ping, the outgoing President of the General\r\nAssembly, for the work he did to guide the General\r\nAssembly as the nations of the world considered the\r\nimmensely important matters that led to the elaboration\r\nof the outcome document that was adopted last night.\r\nI would also like to congratulate you, Sir, on your\r\nelection to preside over the sixtieth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. We are confident that you will lead\r\nthe Assembly well as it confronts the challenge of\r\nimplementing the decisions taken during the\r\nmillennium review summit and remains seized of other\r\nimportant matters that were not adequately addressed\r\nin the outcome document.\r\nShortly before we convened here for the\r\nmillennium review summit, an important meeting of\r\nChristian leaders took place in Washington, D.C. Those\r\nleaders issued a communiqué entitled A Call to\r\nPartnership, directed at our summit meeting. In part\r\nthe call says,\r\nAt the urgent call of church leaders in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere, we came together at the\r\nWashington National Cathedral as Christian\r\nleaders from diverse traditions and places, both\r\nrich and poor, in the South and the North, united\r\nin a common concern for those of us living in\r\npoverty. We see their faces; we hear their voices;\r\nthey are a part of us, and we are a part of them.\r\nAs the United Nations reaches its sixtieth\r\nanniversary, we give thanks for its work in\r\npeacemaking and global reconciliation,\r\nparticularly the historic commitment to eradicate\r\npoverty in the Millennium Declaration of 2000.\r\n10\r\nA/60/PV.10\r\nFive years have passed, and, despite the triumph\r\nof principle, there has been a failure in practice.\r\nIn this communiqué, we offer our partnership to\r\nthe leaders gathered at the World Summit at the\r\nUnited Nations in building a global movement to\r\nmake real the promises of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals as a crucial step towards a\r\nmore just world for all Gods children.\r\nWe believe that God calls us to place\r\npeople struggling with poverty at the centre of\r\nour concern. Globalization has brought\r\nunprecedented economic growth. At the same\r\ntime, one sixth of the worlds people still fight\r\ndaily for survival under the crushing burden of\r\nextreme poverty. The increasing concentration of\r\nwealth in our world, while so many suffer, is a\r\nscandal that impoverishes us all.\r\nWe believe that the spirit of partnership\r\nbetween rich and poor, exemplified in the MDGs,\r\nis a way the world can address poverty in all its\r\ndimensions. In particular, we support the goal of\r\na global partnership for development, and believe\r\nthat the Churches can make a unique contribution\r\nto that partnership.\r\nIf nothing else, the fact that the religious leaders\r\nwho issued that call gathered from many parts of the\r\nworld to agree on a message to our summit Meeting\r\nmust remind us that the masses  the people who\r\nelected us  entertain high expectations about the\r\nUnited Nations. They see this Organization as their\r\npre-eminent partner in the continuing struggle to build\r\na better and humane world.\r\nThey challenge those of us who have the\r\nprivilege to represent our States in the United Nations\r\nto build, strengthen and direct this world Organization\r\nso that it can, indeed, play its role as a pre-eminent\r\npartner of the peoples of the world in constructing a\r\nbetter and more humane world.\r\nAccordingly, I believe that we must view with the\r\ngreatest seriousness their conclusion that five years\r\nhave passed since we adopted the Millennium\r\nDeclaration and that, despite this triumph of principle,\r\nthere has been a failure in practice.\r\nSixty years ago, in the aftermath of the\r\ndestructive fury of the Second World War and the\r\nvillainous genocide committed during that war, the\r\nUnited Nations was formed, in the words of the\r\nCharter, to save succeeding generations from the\r\nscourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought\r\nuntold sorrow to mankind.\r\nResponding to the universal demand for human\r\nand peoples rights, the founders declared that they\r\nwere forming the United Nations to reaffirm faith in\r\nthe fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth\r\nof the human person, in the equal rights of men and\r\nwomen and of nations large and small and to\r\npromote social progress and better standards of life in\r\nlarger freedom.\r\nAs we gather here, in part to celebrate the sixtieth\r\nanniversary of an international Organization\r\nestablished to bring hope to the peoples of the world,\r\nwe cannot avoid asking some hard questions. That is\r\nnecessary if we are to live up to our obligation to\r\nensure that the United Nations discharges its\r\nresponsibilities, described by the religious leaders who\r\nmet at the Washington National Cathedral as\r\npeacemaking, global reconciliation and the eradication\r\nof poverty.\r\nWe must ask ourselves how well prepared the\r\nUnited Nations is today, 60 years after it was\r\nestablished, to save succeeding generations from the\r\nscourge of war; to protect and advance the fundamental\r\nhuman rights of all; to protect and advance the dignity\r\nand worth of each human person; to ensure equal rights\r\nbetween men and women; to ensure equal rights\r\nbetween nations large and small; and to promote social\r\nprogress and better standards of life in larger freedom.\r\nWe must ask  and answer honestly  whether\r\nwhat we do as the United Nations is properly described\r\nas a triumph of principle but a failure in practice, as the\r\nreligious leaders put it.\r\nThe reality is that, 60 years after the United\r\nNations was formed as a response to the appalling and\r\nghastly results of the crime of racism, we are still\r\nconfronted by the cancer of racism. Although the\r\nUnited Nations has adopted important decisions on that\r\nmatter, and convened the necessary conferences to\r\nunite the peoples of the world against racism, those\r\nwho continue to fall victim to that crime against\r\nhumanity would find it difficult to cite the instances\r\nwhen the United Nations came to their aid.\r\nSixty years after the United Nations was formed,\r\nthe indecencies of war and violent conflict continue to\r\nafflict innocent people, evidently because we, the\r\n11\r\nA/60/PV.10\r\nUnited Nations, lack the will to live up to the\r\ncommitment that was made when this Organization\r\nwas established.\r\nAfricans, who have been exposed to many violent\r\nconflicts since the United Nations was formed, are\r\nparticularly keen for this Organization to live up to its\r\nobligation to save succeeding African generations from\r\nthe scourge of war. Even as we speak, the United\r\nNations is faced with the urgent task of taking the\r\nnecessary action in Côte dIvoire to help to bring a\r\nlasting peace to that important African country,\r\nopening the way to its reunification, the holding of\r\ndemocratic elections and the promotion of social\r\nprogress and better standards of life in larger freedom,\r\nto use the words of the Charter.\r\nA similar challenge faces this Organization with\r\nregard to the restoration of lasting peace in Darfur in\r\nthe Sudan, building on the historic conclusion and\r\nimplementation of the Sudanese Comprehensive Peace\r\nAgreement, signed in Nairobi, Kenya, earlier this year.\r\nOnly 11 years ago, we experienced a terrible\r\ngenocide in Rwanda, and thousands were killed in the\r\ninternecine conflict that took place in the Balkans.\r\nThose who were exposed to the savagery would be\r\nfully justified in concluding that the United Nations\r\nhad betrayed its commitment to the peoples of the\r\nworld.\r\nI am certain that all of us are impatient to see an\r\nend to the conflicts in the Middle East, including Iraq,\r\nand in particular the restoration of the rights of the\r\npeople of Palestine, in the context of the successful\r\nimplementation of the road map.\r\nWhile we welcome recent positive developments\r\nin this regard, we must accept the reality that every day\r\nthat passes without the full implementation of the road\r\nmap only serves to point an accusing finger at us, the\r\nUnited Nations, accusing us of not having done\r\neverything we could to help secure the just and lasting\r\npeace that is the right of the Palestinian, the Israeli and\r\nthe Arab peoples.\r\nWe have all recognized the serious and urgent\r\nthreat posed by international terrorism to all our\r\nnations. We have all accepted the reality that we need a\r\nmultilateral response to that common threat. Yet we\r\nhave still not succeeded in arriving at a common\r\ndefinition of that threat or identified its fundamental\r\ncauses.\r\nThe issues of non-proliferation and the\r\ndisarmament of weapons of mass destruction are\r\nmatters of critical concern to all nations, both large and\r\nsmall. Yet we failed to address those matters in the\r\noutcome document adopted at the review summit last\r\nnight, even as the issue of nuclear weapons and their\r\nnon-proliferation is among the most prominent items in\r\nworld news and on the international agenda. None of\r\nus could justly claim that our failure as the United\r\nNations to take specific decisions on these matters\r\nserved to enhance global security in the face of the\r\nthreat of weapons of mass destruction.\r\nWith regard to the issue of Iran, we firmly believe\r\nthat negotiations should resume and that the matter be\r\nsettled within the framework of the provisions of the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\nand with the full participation of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency.\r\nThe gap between the rich and the poor is\r\nbecoming worse within and between countries, as\r\nobserved by the United Nations Development\r\nProgrammes 2005 Human Development Report, which\r\nstates that the gap between the average citizen in the\r\nrichest and in the poorest countries is wide and is\r\ngetting wider. It states that in 1990 the average\r\nAmerican was 38 times richer than the average\r\nTanzanian, while today the average American is 61\r\ntimes richer.\r\nThe same report states, on page 3,\r\nIn 2003, 18 countries with a combined\r\npopulation of 460 million people registered lower\r\nscores on the human development index (HDI)\r\nthan in 1990  an unprecedented reversal. In the\r\nmidst of an increasingly prosperous global\r\neconomy, 10.7 million children every year do not\r\nlive to see their fifth birthday, and more than 1\r\nbillion people survive in abject poverty on less\r\nthan a $1 a day.\r\nAccordingly, if we pause and scan the road\r\ntravelled to judge whether we have succeeded in saving\r\nthe world from the scourge of war; whether we have\r\nbuilt a world that has reaffirmed faith in fundamental\r\nhuman rights; whether we have created a world that\r\nhas restored the dignity and worth of the human\r\nperson  a world that has entrenched equal rights for\r\nmen and women and for nations, large and small  the\r\nanswer from the majority of the people of the world\r\nmay very well be a resounding No.\r\n12\r\nA/60/PV.10\r\nThe United Nations has adopted many decisions\r\nintended to help address the various global challenges\r\nthat have persisted over the 60 years of its existence.\r\nAccordingly, we have the necessary policies to address\r\nthe social, economic, political and other problems\r\nfacing humanity. We have also adopted comprehensive\r\nand clear programmes to give effect to those policies\r\nand have identified the resources required for their\r\nimplementation.\r\nThe questions we must answer are: why have we\r\nnot implemented these programmes, and what must be\r\ndone to correct the situation?\r\nThe process of globalization means that our\r\ncommon world is more integrated today than it was\r\nwhen the United Nations was formed 60 years ago.\r\nSimilarly, the interconnectedness of the issues of\r\npeace, security, development and human rights has\r\nnever been more pronounced than it is today. All this\r\nmeans that the imperatives that made it necessary and\r\ncorrect to establish the United Nations as part of a\r\ndesirable system of global governance are that much\r\nmore compelling today, and that the necessary reform\r\nof the Organization must take place to ensure that it\r\nreflects the new global realities since it was formed\r\nand that it is empowered to respond effectively to the\r\nurgent challenges that face all humanity.\r\nAnd yet, the painful paradox we face is that it\r\nseems obvious that, over the years, there has been a\r\ncontinuous erosion of the authority and prestige of the\r\nUnited Nations and a sustained drift towards its\r\nmarginalization in terms of playing its rightful role, as\r\nso clearly defined in the United Nations Charter. At its\r\nsixtieth session, the General Assembly has the heavy\r\nresponsibility to reassert the critical need for the\r\nUnited Nations to discharge its responsibilities as\r\nspelled out in that Charter. Experience over the last 60\r\nyears has shown that, to address the criticism levelled\r\nagainst the Organization by religious leaders  that\r\nthere has been a triumph of principle and a failure in\r\npractice  we must be ready to engage in a sustained\r\nstruggle to ensure that the vision contained in the\r\nUnited Nations Charter is actually translated into\r\nreality.\r\nAs we engage in this struggle, we should say, as\r\ndid the religious leaders who met at the Washington\r\nNational Cathedral, that we are united in a common\r\nconcern for those of us living in poverty: We see their\r\nfaces; we hear their voices; they are a part of us, and\r\nwe are a part of them.\r\nLet me close by reiterating our deepest\r\nsympathies and condolences to the Government and the\r\npeople of the United States in the wake of the death\r\nand destruction wreaked by Hurricane Katrina.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof South Africa for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Thabo Mbeki, President of the Republic of\r\nSouth Africa, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by His Majesty Sultan Haji Hassanal\r\nBolkiah Muizzaddin Waddaulah, Sultan and Yang\r\nDi Pertuan of Brunei Darussalam\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Sultan of Brunei Darussalam.\r\nHis Majesty Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah\r\nMuizzaddin  Waddaulah, Sultan and Yang Di\r\nPertuan of Brunei Darussalam, was escorted into\r\nthe General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Majesty Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah\r\nMuizzaddin  Waddaulah, Sultan and Yang Di Pertuan\r\nof Brunei Darussalam, and to invite him to address the\r\nAssembly.\r\nSultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah Muizzaddin\r\nWaddaulah: I would like to offer my congratulations\r\nto the President on his election. In doing so, I assure all\r\nour fellow members of Brunei Darussalams continued\r\nstrong support for the United Nations.\r\nMuch of the attention at almost every great\r\ninternational meeting for the past four years has been\r\ngiven to the inhuman acts of global terrorists.\r\nInevitably, this has focused on specific events. That is\r\nunderstandable, of course, and we in Brunei\r\nDarussalam again add our voices to the condemnation\r\nof all such actions. We offer our deepest condolences\r\nto the families of all who have suffered losses.\r\nNevertheless, as we meet our respected fellow\r\nMembers of the United Nations, we again state what\r\nwe have continuously said since the onset of the\r\ncurrent wave of global terrorism. These brutal attacks\r\nextend beyond personal grief and national\r\n13\r\nA/60/PV.10\r\ncondemnation. They are symptomatic of many grave\r\nthreats the people of the world face today. As such,\r\nthey constitute nothing less than an attack on world\r\norder.\r\nFor this reason, we believe it is high time the\r\nworld order asserted itself in modern terms. In other\r\nwords, a new, revitalized United Nations is called\r\nfor  not for us as Heads of State, or for our\r\ndiplomats, or for any of us who are privileged and have\r\nthe means, the education and the opportunity to live in\r\nhope and confidence. A new United Nations is needed\r\nby the ordinary citizens we are privileged to represent here.\r\nIf world order is indeed under attack, that means\r\nordinary people and their families are also under\r\nattack. In far too many ways, it is not merely an attack.\r\nIt is an all-out assault. It comes not merely from\r\ncriminal terrorists: it comes from many aspects of\r\nglobalization, from international crime, from new\r\ntechnology, from social and cultural disruption, from a\r\nrapidly degrading environment and from the grave\r\nthreats posed by the possible spread of fearful new\r\ndiseases. In real, immediate human terms, it comes\r\nfrom fear, from injustice, from a loss of absolute values\r\nand from sheer rage. It is revealed in feelings of\r\nhopelessness and an almost total loss of confidence.\r\nMany of us here, especially those from small\r\ndeveloping nations, are, therefore, convinced that\r\nworld order must be dramatically strengthened. As I\r\nstated at the High-level Plenary Meeting two days ago\r\n(see A/60/PV.6), there is no greater way to begin this\r\nprocess than for each of us to achieve the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). For this reason, we in\r\nBrunei Darussalam will do whatever we can to achieve\r\nthem in our own country and to help our neighbours do\r\nlikewise.\r\nIn setting the Millennium Goals, we recognized\r\nthat, in order to re-establish world order, the root\r\ncauses of anger, despair, injustice and hatred must be\r\naddressed. I would, therefore, once more like to\r\ncommend the Secretary-General and his staff and the\r\nUnited Nations agencies, both professional and\r\nvolunteer, for all they have done in the field to deepen\r\nour understanding of those causes. The causes have\r\nbecome clearly defined in all their urgency. They are\r\npolitical, social, cultural and economic. In each case,\r\nwe do not believe that solutions can be imposed. When\r\nthe international community is so gravely divided on\r\nmatters such as nuclear development, arms\r\nproliferation, globalization, the environment and social\r\ninjustice, this body must be the judge of whether\r\ninternational conduct is acceptable. Solutions to\r\ninternational problems must come from truly united\r\nnations acting in concert. In other words, the United\r\nNations must be an efficient world organization\r\ncommitted to tackling root causes and insisting on\r\ndialogue and negotiation as the sole means of settling\r\ndisputes, no matter how long it takes and no matter\r\nhow frustrating the process may be.\r\nThe global crisis arising from the search for the\r\nbest way to deal with modern, technology-fuelled\r\nterrorism highlights that need. For many years, we\r\nhave maintained that understanding root causes must\r\nbe a very important part of any long-term approach to\r\ntackling terrorist activities.\r\nOf course, every possible form of bilateral and\r\nmultilateral cooperation is needed to deal with the\r\ncriminals involved. But condemnation is not enough,\r\nand legislation is never sufficient. All attempts to\r\njustify acts of terrorism must be resolutely countered,\r\nnot by exchanges of opposing definitions of evil but by\r\ndetermination to eradicate all possible root causes,\r\nwhich some may wrongly see as justifying such acts.\r\nThat is very difficult. It requires consensus here\r\nat the United Nations on what constitutes injustice,\r\nespecially historical injustice, and on what constitutes\r\nunfairness. That, in turn, demands a new, reformed\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nWe are a small nation. Our interest lies in\r\nworking closely with all other Members. For that\r\nreason, we shall offer whatever help we can to building\r\nthe broadest possible consensus on all the many far-\r\nreaching decisions that the Organization is currently\r\ncalled upon to make.\r\nThe most important of those decisions at present\r\nconcerns the question of United Nations reform. Like\r\nmany of our fellow Members, we have long given our\r\nstrong support to reform. In recent months, we have\r\nheld discussions with many colleagues that go far\r\nbeyond matters of principle; they have dealt with\r\nspecific proposals. Most of them aim at redesigning the\r\nstructure of the Organization, including the Security\r\nCouncil. Our response has been the one we have\r\nalways offered. We will listen with respect. We will\r\nacknowledge the good faith of all our fellow Members,\r\nand we will help in any way we can to achieve the\r\nbroadest possible consensus. That, we think, is not a\r\n14\r\nA/60/PV.10\r\nway of avoiding the hard decisions that have to be\r\nmade. On the contrary, we believe it serves to\r\nrecognize how hard those decisions are and how\r\nimportant this body is to the world.\r\nThe consensus that was reached 60 years ago was\r\na strong one. It served the world well for many\r\ndecades. It now appears very clear that, although the\r\nstructure of the United Nations remains in place, the\r\nworld has changed enormously. A new consensus is\r\nbeing sought. Unlike the consensus reached at the end\r\nof the Second World War, it is not directed at the\r\nmeans to maintain peace; it is aimed at creating the\r\nconditions for lasting peace. We see that as the only\r\nway for the United Nations to block all forces of\r\nviolence and inhumanity by means of a strong and just\r\nworld order.\r\nWhen it is time for the Assembly to decide, we in\r\nBrunei Darussalam will consider all proposals in that light.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Sultan and Yang Di\r\nPertuan of Brunei Darussalam for his statement.\r\nHis Majesty Haji Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah\r\nMuizzaddin Waddaulah, Sultan and Yang Di\r\nPertuan of Brunei Darussalam, was escorted\r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by The Honourable Mwai Kibaki, President\r\nof the Republic of Kenya\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Kenya.\r\nThe Honourable Mwai Kibaki, President of the\r\nRepublic of Kenya, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency The Honourable Mwai Kibaki,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Kenya, and to invite him\r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Kibaki: It gives me great pleasure to\r\naddress the General Assembly on the occasion of my\r\nfirst visit to the United Nations as head of State. First, I\r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election to preside over\r\nthe sixtieth session of the General Assembly.\r\nI would also like to pay tribute to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his able stewardship of\r\nour Organization and the reform proposals he has put\r\nforward for our consideration. Since his appointment,\r\nthe Secretary-General has steered the United Nations\r\nwith tact and patience. His skill as a builder of\r\nconsensus has indeed been exemplary. We share his\r\nvision for the United Nations in the twenty-first\r\ncentury as outlined in his epic report entitled In larger\r\nfreedom (A/59/2005). I am confident that Member\r\nStates will seize this historic opportunity and deliver\r\non the promise of a better world for posterity.\r\nThe shift in the global distribution of power,\r\naccompanied by the emergence of new threats and\r\nchallenges, has dramatically changed the context\r\nwithin which the United Nations operates. The United\r\nNations of the future must still, however, remain true\r\nto the universal values that inspired its creation. Our\r\npeoples expect the United Nations to act as an agent of\r\nprogress. They look to the Organization to play an\r\neffective and leading role in improving their economic\r\nand social well-being.\r\nKenya embraces the principles of the Charter,\r\nwhich serve as a basic reference point for the reform of\r\nthe United Nations. Those principles are the core of its\r\ninner strength. We believe that the principle of\r\ndemocracy is as central to this Organization and its\r\nfuture health as it is to the prosperity of our own\r\nnations. Kenya deeply cherishes that principle and\r\nseeks its generous spread around the world and in this\r\ninstitution.\r\nGlobal problems require global solutions. The\r\nUnited Nations is the only vehicle that can help us\r\nattain those solutions and give legitimacy to our\r\nactions. The United Nations remains indispensable in\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security. It\r\nis pivotal to the attainment of sustainable development\r\nand the advancement of human rights. Let us work to\r\nstrengthen the United Nations to meet contemporary\r\nchallenges.\r\nImportant proposals for United Nations reform\r\nare already on the table. My Government embraces the\r\nholistic definition of collective security, which strongly\r\naffirms the connections between peace, development,\r\nhuman rights and the rule of law. Those goals cannot\r\nbe realized in isolation. As the Secretary-General\r\nobserved, we will not enjoy development without\r\nsecurity, we will not enjoy security without\r\ndevelopment, and we will not enjoy either without\r\nrespect for human rights (A/59/2005, para. 17). I am\r\nsure we all acknowledge those plain truths.\r\n15\r\nA/60/PV.10\r\nKenya firmly believes that reform of the United\r\nNations is a process, not an event. In view of the\r\nintegrated nature of the issues, we need to adopt a\r\ncomprehensive policy approach to United Nations\r\nreforms. We must maintain a broad vision driven by\r\ncollective effort for the ultimate benefit of the\r\ninternational system.\r\nI am happy to note that although some of the\r\nproposals have been adopted, we should now move\r\nquickly to implement them. I refer especially to the\r\nproposals that do not require amendment of the\r\nCharter. They include the adoption of a robust counter-\r\nterrorism strategy, strengthening peacekeeping,\r\ncreating a Peacebuilding Commission and Fund and the\r\nreform of the human rights system.\r\nI am also pleased to note the consensus on the\r\nstrengthening of the General Assembly, the Economic\r\nand Social Council and a strong relationship between\r\nthe United Nations and regional and subregional\r\norganizations.\r\nEnvironmental protection is a threat that is a\r\nmajor challenge in the attainment of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. This places the environment, more\r\nthan ever, at the core of sustainable development.\r\nInternational environmental governance is an integral\r\npart of realizing sustainable development. Kenya fully\r\nendorses the ongoing process of defining the elements\r\nof international environmental governance. This,\r\nhowever, should be done within the framework of the\r\nCartagena decision, which aims at strengthening the\r\nUnited Nations Environment Programme within its\r\ncurrent mandate through an enhanced financial and\r\nscientific base.\r\nWe should also recognize that no truly effective\r\nresponse can be made unless the international\r\ncommunity fully complies with its commitment to\r\nmake the means available as provided for in various\r\nmultilateral environmental agreements.\r\nKenya remains firmly committed to the United\r\nNations Programme of Action on Small Arms and\r\nLight Weapons and is gratified with the status of its\r\nimplementation, at both national and regional levels.\r\nDespite the progress made, small arms and other\r\nconventional weapons continue to end up in the hands\r\nof wrong non-State actors, with attendant adverse\r\nimplications on peace and security leading to political\r\ninstability in many countries. In order to curb this\r\ntrend, Kenya requests the Secretary-General to\r\nundertake a study into the possibility of a legal\r\ninstrument to control international transfers of\r\nconventional arms.\r\nKenya also supports proposals for the\r\nenhancement of peace-support operation capabilities of\r\nthe United Nations. Any mandate for peacekeeping\r\nforces should be clear and precise. Adequate resources\r\nmust be made available to the commanders in the field\r\nto enable them to execute their mandates effectively.\r\nIntervention in crisis situations must also be timely to\r\nprevent undue loss of life. Kenya welcomes vital\r\ncontributions to peace and security made by regional\r\norganizations forging predictable partnerships between\r\nthe United Nations and regional organizations.\r\nFurthermore, Kenya endorses the proposal to\r\nestablish a strategic military capacity to reinforce\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping and the creation of a\r\nstandby brigade for rapid deployment of the\r\nOrganizations civilian police in peacekeeping\r\noperations.\r\nWe strongly support the Secretary-Generals\r\nproposal to establish a Peacebuilding Commission and\r\nfund by 31 December 2005. We believe such a\r\npeacebuilding commission will contribute to the\r\nrealization of real peace in many regions. However, it\r\nis important that critical questions about form, function\r\nand decision-making authority be resolved.\r\nIn our own neighbourhood, the importance of\r\npost-conflict peacebuilding has become a bigger\r\npriority after the recent successes of the Sudan and\r\nSomalia mediation efforts, which Kenya chaired under\r\nthe auspices of the Intergovernmental Authority on\r\nDevelopment.\r\nKenya commends the international community\r\nfor the excellent response during the Oslo pledging\r\nconference towards reconstruction of southern Sudan.\r\nWe urge a similar response to support the Transitional\r\nFederal Government of Somalia in setting up and\r\nimplementing a national security, stabilization and\r\neconomic reconstruction strategy.\r\nWe also call upon the Security Council to play a\r\nmore positive proactive role in the search for a broad\r\nconsensus for peace and thus enhance the capacity of\r\nthe Transitional Federal Government to establish basic\r\ninstitutions.\r\nOn the reform of the Security Council, it is\r\nnecessary to make it far more equitable and\r\n16\r\nA/60/PV.10\r\nrepresentative of the United Nations global\r\nconstituency. The procedures and methods of work of\r\nthe Council should be changed to secure transparency\r\nand dialogue with the United Nations membership.\r\nFurthermore, the future composition of the\r\nSecurity Council should proceed on the basis of\r\nsovereign equality of States and equitable geographical\r\nrepresentation.\r\nKenya welcomes the proposal to develop a\r\nstronger relationship between the United Nations and\r\nregional and subregional organizations. For Africa,\r\nthere is abundant political will in our continent to make\r\nthe African Union succeed. I believe that external\r\nsupport, especially from the United Nations and the\r\ninternational community at large, would make the\r\nAfrican Union work better.\r\nThe establishment of an African Union Peace and\r\nSecurity Council and of the intervention force planned\r\nto be set up by 2009 are measures aimed at advancing\r\npolitical stability in Africa to underpin economic\r\ndevelopment. Already, the African Union has taken the\r\nlead in Burundi and in Darfur, in the Sudan, where\r\ndeployments of peacekeeping missions have preceded\r\ninternational action by the United Nations.\r\nThe recent pledges by the Group of Eight (G-8)\r\ncountries to double aid to Africa and grant 100-per-\r\ncent debt relief to 18 developing countries were\r\nwelcome. We hope they will honour their pledges and\r\ncommitments in conformity with the agreement forged\r\nat the 2002 Monterrey International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development. Support by the G-8 will\r\nhelp African countries achieve the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nKenya affirms the centrality of gender equality\r\nand recognizes the critical role that women must play\r\nin development. We also recognize that achievement of\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals depends on the\r\nempowerment of women. As part of our effort to fully\r\nattain this objective, my Government has adopted a\r\nnational policy on gender development. The aim is to\r\nintegrate women in decision-making through legal,\r\nregulatory and institutional reforms.\r\nI am convinced that, if we are to attain our\r\ncommon objective of revitalizing the United Nations,\r\nwe should embrace the vision presented by the\r\nSecretary-General in his package of reforms. This will\r\nrequire political will and leadership on our part. I\r\ntherefore urge Member States to seize this opportunity\r\nand endorse proposals on which there is broad\r\nconsensus. As we contemplate strengthening and\r\nrenewing our Organization, we should do so for\r\nposterity.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Kenya for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Mwai Kibaki, President of the Republic of\r\nKenya, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Nicanor Duarte Frutos, President of\r\nthe Republic of Paraguay\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Paraguay.\r\nMr. Nicanor Duarte Frutos, President of the\r\nRepublic of Paraguay, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Nicanor Duarte Frutos,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Paraguay, and to invite\r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Duarte Frutos (spoke in Spanish): At\r\nthe outset, I would like to express the condolences of\r\nthe people of Paraguay over the tragedy caused by\r\nHurricane Katrina. I express my Governments\r\nsolidarity with the victims and with the Government of\r\nthe United States, and I ask God to swiftly assuage the\r\ngrief of so many families.\r\nWe are gathered here to commemorate the\r\nsixtieth anniversary of the United Nations. Six decades\r\nis time enough to reflect on the historical process of\r\nthis Organization and, above all, on the debate\r\nconcerning the relevance of reforming it. This reform\r\nis absolutely crucial and must be directed not only to\r\nset up standards that would regulate the capacity of\r\nPowers to make war; it is of primary importance that\r\nthe reform promote equitable economic development,\r\nbecause in a selfish world, where the number of\r\nsocietys orphans grows daily, it will be very difficult\r\nto have global peace.\r\nChanges cannot be partial or superficial and must\r\nnot merely satisfy the hegemonistic ambitions of a few.\r\nWe need to govern globalization with democratically\r\n17\r\nA/60/PV.10\r\nagreed legal norms and bodies that, through their\r\ninherent legitimacy, would have the authority to ensure\r\ncompliance with their regulations.\r\nIt must be a desire for world balance, not\r\nfinancial clout within the Organization, that should\r\ndetermine the direction to be followed in the United\r\nNations; otherwise, the power of money will prevail\r\nover the power of justice and the rights of peoples,\r\nwhich would dangerously thwart the noble mission of\r\nthe United Nations. This means that reform cannot\r\ndeepen divisions; that would be illogical. The Charter\r\nmust reassert the role of unity among diverse nations\r\nwhich, in spite of their differences, must live together\r\nand share their resources and values, which give\r\ndignity to the lives of men and women and of our\r\npeoples.\r\nDevelopment in equity and democracy is the\r\nformula. But to reach this stage, we need more\r\ninternational trade and cooperation. Lately a wall is\r\nrising to block our exports, while cooperation is being\r\nwatered down  or the little cooperation that remains\r\nis undertaken unjustly or according to the mood of\r\nthose involved. The old promise taken on by the richest\r\nnations to devote 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic\r\nproduct (GDP) to less developed countries has not been\r\nrespected thus far, except for the honourable\r\nexceptions of Norway, Luxembourg, Denmark, Sweden\r\nand the Netherlands. But it is a hopeful sign that the\r\nPresident of the United States has said in this forum\r\n(see A/60/PV.2) that his Government is in a position to\r\neliminate all the subsidies that cause backwardness and\r\npoverty for peoples with emerging economies insofar\r\nas the other rich nations do likewise. That would be of\r\ngreat benefit to people who are experiencing shortages\r\ndue to the unfair international order that the President\r\nof the United States himself mentioned, so that our\r\npeoples democracy can be stable and sustainable.\r\nIt is important to point out that between 1990 and\r\n2003 the rich countries increased their per capita\r\nincome by $6,070, while during the same period, their\r\nassistance per capita fell to one dollar; this reflects the\r\ngreat stinginess that prevails in the current\r\nglobalization model. The United Nations has a primary\r\nrole to play in humanizing that model.\r\nThe subsidies granted by rich countries to their\r\nagricultural sectors, as well as the assistance that they\r\ngive to each other, are a cruel paradox. That assistance\r\namounts to a little more than $1 billion annually and\r\nthe subsidies to a little less. That global policy  weak\r\nin terms of cooperation and perverse in terms of\r\ntrade  will end by undermining the emerging\r\ndemocracies in developing countries.\r\nWe in Paraguay are deeply convinced of those\r\ntenets. Our wish is to cooperate so that our noble\r\npurposes will govern the new world order. In our\r\ndomestic affairs, we have managed to reverse a long\r\nprocess of deterioration to achieve macroeconomic\r\nstability and political institutionalization. We are\r\nworking to increase growth and to strengthen\r\ndemocracy through good governance, thereby tackling\r\nand resolving our social problems in a way we had\r\nnever done in the past.\r\nToday my country, Paraguay, is becoming a\r\nnation in a predictable situation and one worthy of\r\ninternational trust. We are not bound by any political or\r\neconomic dogma. Rather, we are seeking to liberate our\r\npeople from crude fanaticism, from ideological\r\nprejudices, from political violence and from fatalism,\r\nbecause we believe we are capable of forging our own\r\ndestiny in a world of greater brotherhood.\r\nIndeed, Paraguay is rich in development\r\npotential. We have abundant natural resources: land,\r\nwater and energy. And, even more important, we have\r\na young population that is highly motivated to grow, to\r\nlearn and to work. Even though our economy is still\r\nsmall, we are adopting policies and plans to expand our\r\nproduction, increase employment, improve domestic\r\npurchasing power and increase exports. We are moving\r\ntowards an economy that can compete in terms of both\r\nquality and innovation.\r\nOur country is among those States that lack direct\r\naccess to the sea. Tragically, Paraguay is landlocked,\r\nwhich is a considerable obstacle to our aspiration to\r\nbuild an economy based on production and\r\ninternational trade. For that reason, we need to create\r\nspecial lending arrangements for landlocked\r\ndeveloping countries, ensuring them differential\r\ntreatment in areas such as lower interest rates and\r\nlonger grace periods. Such measures could attenuate\r\nthe comparative disadvantages we feel as a result of\r\nour geographical situations.\r\nAnother dimension I would like to touch on is the\r\nimportance of new information and communication\r\ntechnologies and of biotechnological and other\r\nscientific research. The knowledge and use of those\r\nresources cannot be concentrated in the hands of the\r\n18\r\nA/60/PV.10\r\nfew. They must be made universally available.\r\nParaguay believes this to be a necessary prerequisite\r\nfor the growth of global competitiveness.\r\nTwo years ago my Government inherited a\r\nsituation of economic stagnation, recession, sterile\r\npolitical antagonism, violence, growing poverty and\r\nweak and unreliable public institutions that led to timid\r\nsocial policies that were a long way from addressing\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. Today we are\r\nrecovering political and macroeconomic stability,\r\ndemocratic governance and, above all, trust in the\r\nParaguayan State and in our business sector. We have\r\ngreat challenges ahead of us, but, with faith in the\r\ncapacity of our people, we are tackling them to build a\r\nmore just international order.\r\nThe major challenges in my country are tackling\r\nextreme poverty and health care, which affect the\r\nneediest sectors of the population: indigenous people\r\nand small farmers. To address those issues we have\r\npromoted a rapid increase in spending for social\r\nservices to put a stop to growing poverty. We are\r\nfinancing new programmes: a social protection\r\nnetwork for vulnerable groups, with financial subsidies\r\nlinked to school attendance; in the field of health care,\r\na nutrition programme for pregnant women and for\r\nboys and girls at risk for malnutrition; large-scale\r\nshipments of seeds for subsistence crops; the purchase\r\nof land for small farmers, with a view to ensuring\r\nsocial peace; free medical care for all children under\r\nthe age of five; concessional electricity rates; and a\r\nscholarship programme for students from the most\r\nvulnerable schools. With humility, but also with great\r\nfaith in the future and in the international community,\r\ndemocracy and freedom  we in Paraguay are\r\nbuilding a socially, fiscally and environmentally\r\nresponsible State.\r\nIn the international context, we join the appeal\r\nfor a more just and humane world order in which the\r\nless developed nations are not condemned for all time\r\nto discrimination, indifference and backwardness. In\r\norder to achieve those goals we have no alternative to\r\nan inclusive multilateralism that offers balance,\r\nrationality and justice in international relations.\r\nWe also condemn terrorism in all its forms. We\r\nbelieve that terrorism is a threat to civilized processes\r\nand to the imperatives of resolving conflicts and\r\nestablishing peaceful coexistence in the world in order\r\nto ensure the development and prosperity of our\r\npeoples.\r\nSimilarly, we reiterate, as we have done year after\r\nyear, our formal support for Taiwans inclusion in the\r\nUnited Nations, so that the brotherly and supportive\r\nRepublic of China can have a place and become an\r\nintegral part of our Organization as a full-fledged\r\nMember, in accordance with the principle of\r\nuniversality and the norms of international law.\r\nIn addition, my country is deeply concerned by\r\nthe instability and high prices in international oil\r\nmarkets, which militate against our hard-won\r\nmacroeconomic stability. Our country has not escaped\r\nthe harmful impact of that phenomenon, given the most\r\nunjust burden on society: inflation. We are making\r\nevery effort to control inflation, because we know that\r\nhigh oil prices have a negative impact on economic\r\ngrowth and poverty reduction. Today, our Government\r\nis significantly subsidizing the price of oil, thus\r\ndepriving the State of major financial resources for\r\nnecessary social programmes.\r\nI would like to say at this meeting that Paraguay\r\nis suffering from a misapplication of international\r\njustice. There is an attempt to prohibit payments to our\r\nState from financial transactions carried out by\r\nrepresentatives of a corrupt dictatorship which, with\r\nthe complicity of a group of international banks, wants\r\nto deprive us of resources that we desperately need for\r\nsocial peace in our country. We hope that the\r\nappropriate United Nations bodies will not permit the\r\npeoples of developing economies to be deprived of\r\nmajor resources through devious legal procedures. We\r\nhope for justice in this area from international\r\ninstitutions.\r\nThe United Nations must either change to lead\r\nand to take up the challenges of our time, or it will hide\r\nbehind a superficial change in order to survive and will\r\nbecome an accomplice in the regression of our peoples\r\nand the perpetuation of backwardness. This is a crucial\r\nmoment that we are experiencing as leaders of our\r\ncountries, sixty years after the creation of the United\r\nNations and five after the Millennium Development\r\nGoals. We find ourselves at a crossroads with two\r\npaths before us: one of injustice and indifference that\r\nleads to a world that is increasingly poor, unfair and\r\ninsecure, and the other the path of far-reaching change\r\nthat leads to peace and global well-being.\r\n19\r\nA/60/PV.10\r\nI would like to express my hope that this historic\r\nsession of the General Assembly will obtain the\r\ncommitments and actions required to reduce and\r\neliminate the suffering, abandonment and frustration of\r\nthousands of millions of people and that our efforts\r\nwill yield its expected fruits for the well-being of\r\nmankind.\r\nI trust that God will give us the necessary wisdom\r\nand strength required to lead our countries along the\r\npath of liberty, peace, development and justice.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Paraguay for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Nicanor Duarte Frutos, President of the\r\nRepublic of Paraguay, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Hifikepunye Pohamba, President of\r\nthe Republic of Namibia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Hifikepunye Pohamba,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Namibia.\r\nMr. Hifikepunye Pohamba, President of the\r\nRepublic of Namibia, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Hifikepunye Pohamba,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Namibia, and to invite him\r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Pohamba: I wish to congratulate you\r\nmost warmly, Mr. President, on your unanimous\r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at\r\nits sixtieth session and to assure you of my delegations\r\nfull support. May I also express our profound\r\nappreciation to your distinguished predecessor,\r\nMr. Jean Ping of Gabon, for the effective leadership he\r\nprovided during the fifty-ninth session.\r\nI am most delighted and indeed honoured to\r\naddress this Assembly for the first time as President of\r\nthe Republic of Namibia. I stand before you with the\r\ndemocratic mandate given to me by the people of\r\nNamibia during our presidential elections in November\r\n2004 and following my inauguration on 21 March\r\n2005.\r\nAt the same occasion, we celebrated 15 years of\r\nour national independence, which, as the Assembly\r\nwill recall, was brought about by a long and bitter\r\nstruggle waged by the people of Namibia under the\r\nleadership of the national liberation movement,\r\nSWAPO, with wide international support, and thus\r\nculminating in the implementation of Security Council\r\nresolution 435 (1978).\r\nI recall these important events in our history to\r\nunderline the fact that Namibias nationhood is directly\r\nlinked to the United Nations. In this regard, allow me,\r\ntherefore, on behalf of the Government and people of\r\nNamibia and indeed on my own behalf to express our\r\nsincere appreciation and gratitude to the men and\r\nwomen of the United Nations family, who stood side\r\nby side with us until final victory was achieved.\r\nAs we mark the sixtieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations, it is indeed proper and fitting to reflect on the\r\nachievements and setbacks of our Organization since\r\nits inception. In this exercise, we must be guided by an\r\nhonest and objective analysis of events along the path\r\nwe have travelled so far.\r\nIn this connection, I would like to take this\r\nopportunity to commend our Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, most sincerely for his tireless efforts\r\nto  strengthen the United Nations system through the\r\nproposed reforms. Indeed, the challenges we face today\r\nrequire renewed commitment and visionary leadership\r\nto ensure efficient and effective service delivery to all\r\nhumanity.\r\nWhen we address the crucial issue of the reform\r\nof the United Nations system, we must be guided by\r\nthe principles of democracy, equity, justice and fairness\r\nfor all. At the centre of this overdue exercise must be\r\nthe compelling need to serve all our people better,\r\nregardless of their race, religion or status of\r\ndevelopment.\r\nWith specific reference to the Security Council,\r\ngenuine democratization and reform can take place\r\nonly when all its members are accorded the same\r\nprivileges  including the veto power, which is\r\ncurrently enjoyed only by a few member States, who\r\nuse it for national self-interest. That creates resentment\r\nand mistrust from those who are negatively affected by\r\nthe abuse of veto power.\r\nIt is against this background that African States\r\nadopted the Harare Declaration in 1997, in which they\r\n20\r\nA/60/PV.10\r\ndemanded that the veto power be abolished. However,\r\nif the veto power is maintained, it is only logical that\r\nnew permanent member States who join the expanded\r\nSecurity Council must of necessity be accorded the\r\nsame rights and privileges. Otherwise, such reform will\r\nbe cosmetic at best, and meaningless at worst.\r\nOn this very crucial matter, Namibia fully stands\r\nby the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration,\r\nas reaffirmed by the Fourth Extraordinary Summit of\r\nthe African Union, held in Addis Ababa on 4 August\r\n2005. We collectively maintain that the African\r\ncontinent, which has been underrepresented for so\r\nlong, deserves two permanent seats with veto power\r\nand five non-permanent seats on the Council. This\r\ndemand is logical, reasonable and justifiable. We\r\ntherefore call on all regions to support Africas\r\nposition. It is indeed only when we stand together on\r\nfirm principle that we can effect real and meaningful\r\nchange in our only truly international Organization, the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nConcerning the General Assembly, Namibia holds\r\nthe strong view that that organ, which provides a\r\ngenuinely democratic and representative platform for\r\nall Member States to be heard, should play a critical\r\nrole in the entire reform process of our international\r\nOrganization. We are equally of the strong conviction\r\nthat the authority of the General Assembly should be\r\nreasserted, to ensure that its resolutions and decisions\r\nare binding and enforceable.\r\nIn this crucial process, our highest priority should\r\nbe our collective commitment to ensure sustainable\r\nsocial and economic development on a global scale. In\r\norder to achieve that goal, we must be guided by a\r\nstrong spirit of human solidarity and a shared sense of\r\njustice and fairness for all.\r\nFor many developing countries, implementation\r\nof the Millennium Development Goals is severely\r\nhampered by the lack of adequate resources,\r\ncompounded by other challenges, including the\r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic, malaria and tuberculosis, as well\r\nas other socio-economic difficulties. Against that\r\nbackground, the Economic and Social Council must be\r\nstrengthened and given sufficient resources, together\r\nwith the United Nations agencies, in order to take the\r\nlead in implementing effective human-centred country\r\nprogrammes.\r\nWe accept the fact that Governments in\r\ndeveloping countries have a responsibility to work\r\ntogether and to encourage the active participation of\r\nthe private sector, civil society and other stakeholders\r\nin bringing about sustainable social and economic\r\ndevelopment for all segments of our society.\r\nIt is equally important that Governments and\r\ninstitutions in the economically advanced countries\r\noffer genuine partnership by providing new and\r\nadditional resources, commensurate with their\r\ncommitments in line with the Millennium Development\r\nGoals. To that end, if the countries regarded as low-\r\nmiddle-income countries are to meet the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals by 2015, they will require\r\nincreased support from the international community,\r\nincluding market access as well as access to financial\r\nsources such as the International Development\r\nAssociation and official development assistance.\r\nOur ability to effectively eliminate threats to\r\ninternational peace and security will depend on the\r\nmanner in which we address the social and economic\r\nchallenges facing our peoples at the global level.\r\nIn our review, during the 2005 summit, of the\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals\r\nand of other decisions taken by major international\r\nconferences, it became clear that we still have a long\r\nway to go to honour our commitments. It is therefore\r\nimportant that we narrow our differences and form a\r\ncommon front with a common objective to better serve\r\nhumanity. We should therefore make collective and\r\neffective use of existing multilateral mechanisms,\r\nespecially the United Nations, in order to succeed in\r\neliminating current and future threats.\r\nThe process of decolonization has not yet been\r\ncompleted. The peoples of Palestine and of the Western\r\nSahara continue to suffer under foreign occupation and\r\nare denied the exercise of their inalienable rights to\r\nself-determination and national independence. It is our\r\ncollective responsibility to rectify that historical\r\ninjustice. In that regard, we call for the immediate and\r\nunconditional establishment of an independent State of\r\nPalestine and the full implementation of the United\r\nNations settlement plan for Western Sahara.\r\nI am equally concerned at the fact that the people\r\nof Cuba continue to suffer from the effects of the\r\nunilateral embargo imposed on them by the United\r\nStates of America. We call on the international\r\ncommunity to demand the unconditional lifting of that\r\nembargo.\r\n21\r\nA/60/PV.10\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to reiterate my\r\nGovernments hope that, when we accept our collective\r\nresponsibility, the United Nations can and will succeed\r\nin preserving international peace and security and\r\ntherefore guarantee equality and justice for all\r\nhumanity. We, the peoples of the United Nations, must\r\ndo what is required to bequeath to the next generations\r\na better future. To that end, the Government and the\r\npeople of Namibia pledge our total commitment.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Namibia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Hifikepunye Pohamba, President of the\r\nRepublic of Namibia, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Ivan Gaparovič, President of the\r\nSlovak Republic\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Slovak Republic.\r\nMr. Ivan Gaparovič, President of the Slovak\r\nRepublic, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Ivan Gaparovič, President of\r\nthe Slovak Republic, and to invite him to address the\r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Gaparovič: At the outset, allow me to\r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixtieth\r\nsession. I am confident that your experience in\r\nmultilateral diplomacy, coupled with a positive\r\napproach, will serve as a guarantee of success for the\r\noutcome of your decisions. Ahead of us lie demanding\r\ntasks related to the implementation of the reform\r\ndecisions that have been adopted. I wish to assure that\r\nyou can fully rely on Slovakias support in that regard.\r\nI wish also to convey our solidarity to the United\r\nStates citizens devastated by Hurricane Katrina, who\r\nare struggling to recover from the trauma of losing\r\ntheir loved ones and their homes. On behalf of the\r\npeople and the Government of Slovakia, I extend\r\nheartfelt sympathy to the families of the victims who\r\nperished in that natural disaster.\r\nWe are gathered here in this forum because the\r\nchallenges faced by humankind in the area of global\r\ndevelopment, security and protection of human rights\r\nbring us together in our search for common solutions\r\nthat call for clear political decisions. There is a general\r\nunderstanding that the United Nations, in its current\r\nshape and form, is not up to the challenges that lie\r\nahead of it in the twenty-first century. Accordingly, we\r\nmust follow through with the necessary changes so that\r\nthis Organization may continue to fulfil its role\r\nefficiently while keeping abreast of the growing needs\r\nand expectations of the international community.\r\nThe Secretary-General has submitted his plan,\r\nwhich contains a package of bold reform steps laying\r\ndown ways for the international community to deal\r\nwith current issues and upgrade the United Nations\r\nsystem. Since the very day on which it was published,\r\nSlovakia has believed that his plan provides an\r\nexcellent basis for our deliberations. We endorse the\r\npremise that progress in tackling the most important\r\nglobal problems can only be achieved if the issues of\r\ndevelopment, security and human rights are addressed\r\njointly. In particular, we welcome the fact that human\r\nrights are accorded the same priority as development\r\nand security, and we appreciate the relevant proposals\r\nto strengthen the international system for the protection\r\nof human rights.\r\nThe reform of the United Nations is not a matter\r\nto be dealt with by the Organization alone, as\r\nresponsibility for reaching concrete consensus on key\r\nissues lies primarily in the hands of the Governments\r\nof Member States. Reaching agreement that\r\naccommodates the interests of the entire world is no\r\neasy task. This years summit and its outcome\r\ndocument have forced us to look in the mirror. They\r\nhave shown us the amount of vision, wisdom and\r\ncourage that we were able and willing to bring to this\r\ntask, with a view to fundamentally reforming the\r\nsystem of multilateral cooperation in the interest of\r\nglobal development. The image we saw reflected in the\r\nmirror was not to everyones liking, but that is the\r\nnature of multilateral diplomacy. It is the result of\r\ncompromise, the art of the possible, which is both its\r\nstrong and its weak point. In that connection, I prefer\r\ntaking a forward-looking approach with regard to the\r\noutcome document, which contains messages and ideas\r\nthat deserve our support in the General Assembly. Let\r\nus try to go ahead with its implementation as best we\r\ncan.\r\n22\r\nA/60/PV.10\r\nDespite the considerable progress achieved \r\nprimarily in the fight against poverty and famine in\r\nAsia  all reports draw attention to  the extremely\r\nalarming and unacceptable downturn in several parts of\r\nAfrica. Slovakia came to the summit with the\r\nunderstanding that our first priority was to make\r\nprogress in achieving the Millennium Development\r\nGoals (MDGs). In my view, the outcome document\r\nprovides a solid basis for our future work in that\r\nregard.\r\nSlovakia has not been inactive in that respect.\r\nThe amount of public funds appropriated for foreign\r\naid has quadrupled since the year 2000, which speaks\r\nfor itself. In addition, having joined the European\r\nUnion in May 2004, Slovakia also joined the common\r\nEuropean development aid system. As a new member\r\nof the Union, Slovakia pledged to do its utmost to\r\nincrease its official development assistance to 0.17 per\r\ncent of gross domestic product by 2010, and to 0.33\r\nper cent by 2015.\r\nSlovakia is directly funding and implementing\r\nmore than 70 projects in the poor countries of Europe,\r\nAsia and Africa. That gives us the opportunity to\r\ndirectly pass on to developing countries the unique\r\nknowledge that we acquired during our own countrys\r\ntransition.\r\nIn addition to favouring an increase in aid,\r\nSlovakia also supports further reform of trade relations\r\nas well as debt relief for poor countries. I wish to\r\nhighlight the serious debt relief measures that Slovakia\r\ntook earlier this year, forgiving several hundred million\r\ndollars in debt owed by heavily indebted poor\r\ncountries.\r\nSlovakia welcomes efforts aimed at liberalizing\r\ntrade as a means to promote economic growth and\r\ndevelopment. We therefore join the call for an\r\nexpeditious completion of the World Trade\r\nOrganizations Doha round of negotiations.\r\nAt this point, I must mention that one of the most\r\nserious global threats is the escalation of terrorism. It is\r\ncommendable that the outcome document clearly\r\ndenounces this new plague of our time, which\r\nendangers the population of rich and poor countries\r\nalike. Slovakia has clearly opposed all forms of\r\nviolence and expressions of blind fanaticism and\r\nhatred. During the summit, in order to demonstrate\r\nSlovakias position, I personally signed the\r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of Acts\r\nof Nuclear Terrorism, which is the latest in a series of\r\nanti-terrorist international treaty instruments. Slovakia\r\nis also a signatory to all 12 United Nations anti-\r\nterrorism conventions. Slovakia strongly supports the\r\ncomprehensive strategy to fight terrorism presented by\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan at the Madrid\r\nConference in March 2005.\r\nI must say that Slovakia had expected that the\r\nsummit would have formulated a clear definition of\r\nterrorism, which is an important prerequisite for the\r\nadoption of a comprehensive anti-terrorism convention.\r\nWhile we did not achieve that, it is nevertheless\r\nimperative that we redouble our efforts to draft such a\r\nconvention in order that it can still be adopted during\r\nthis sixtieth session. The outcome document will serve\r\nas a good starting point for that effort.\r\nThe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\r\ncontinues to represent the most serious threat to global\r\nsecurity. It is therefore regrettable that the outcome\r\ndocument leaves us with more questions than answers.\r\nAs a member of the Board of Governors of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Slovakia\r\nrecognizes the right to the peaceful use of nuclear\r\nenergy without the possibility of misusing that\r\ntechnology to produce nuclear arms. We therefore\r\nbelieve that in order to prevent the proliferation of\r\nnuclear weapons it is crucial to strengthen the\r\nsupervisory competencies of the IAEA and to control\r\nmore effectively the stages in the nuclear fuel cycle\r\nthat involve uranium enrichment and plutonium\r\nprocessing. However, such restrictions must take\r\naccount of the right of countries that fully satisfy their\r\ntreaty obligations to obtain energy from nuclear power.\r\nSlovakia supported the proposal to set up a\r\nHuman Rights Council as a permanent principal body\r\nof the United Nations. The Human Rights Council\r\nshould follow up on all the positive and constructive\r\nfeatures of the existing Human Rights Commission.\r\nMembers of the Human Rights Council should be\r\nelected by a two-thirds majority of the General\r\nAssembly. The Slovak Republic is in favour of the\r\nCouncil being composed of a small number of\r\nmembers in order to give it the necessary flexibility in\r\nresponding to emerging problems. Slovakia supported\r\nthe proposal to elect members of the Council on a\r\nregional basis, and from countries that demonstrably\r\nmeet their commitments concerning the protection of\r\nhuman rights. Slovakia also encourages closer\r\n23\r\nA/60/PV.10\r\ninteractions between the Office of the High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights, the Human Rights\r\nCouncil and the Security Council. In that context, we\r\nwelcome the proposal in the summits outcome\r\ndocument to strengthen the Office of the High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights.\r\nWe were also pleased to note that, for the first\r\ntime, the outcome document contains a broader\r\ndefinition of the principle of the responsibility to\r\nprotect. Slovakia looks forward to further work in that\r\nregard. We believe that after Cambodia, Rwanda, the\r\nSudan and Srebrenica, we are slowly entering a stage\r\nwhere we take on more direct responsibility for dealing\r\nwith situations where genocide and war crimes are\r\ncommitted. The principle of sovereignty means that\r\nresponsibility for people lies with each sovereign\r\ncountry and its Government. However, if a particular\r\nGovernment fails to live up to that responsibility, the\r\ninternational community has the obligation to take all\r\nnecessary steps and use all available and necessary\r\nmeans to prevent a major humanitarian disaster.\r\nSlovakia was very much in favour of the proposal\r\nto set up a Peacebuilding Commission. Experience\r\nshows us that we must not rush to leave a country that\r\nhas just seen the end of a conflict and simply turn our\r\nbacks on the whole situation. Our recent history has\r\nprovided us several bad examples in that regard. We\r\nmust strengthen our efforts with a view to setting up an\r\neffective Peacebuilding Commission in the shortest\r\namount of time possible. The outcome document sets\r\nout clear parameters and a timeframe for its\r\nestablishment.\r\nI mentioned at the outset that it is essential to\r\nrealign the United Nations with the reality of our\r\nmodern era. In that regard, it is essential to further\r\nrevitalize the General Assembly. We must also reform\r\nthe Economic and Social Council so as to make it\r\ncapable of effectively implementing the development\r\nagenda of the United Nations.\r\nWith respect to reorganizing the Secretariat, we\r\nare in favour of increasing the flexibility, and\r\nstrengthening the authority of, the Secretary-General in\r\nhis managerial functions as the head of the\r\nOrganization, in order to enable him to keep abreast of\r\nthe current needs of the United Nations. He must be\r\ngiven the necessary resources to perform his role. At\r\nthe same time, it will be necessary to strengthen the\r\nindependence and powers of internal supervisory\r\nbodies in order to ensure more transparency and\r\naccountability inside the Organization. Of course, all\r\nthe reforms will require appropriate funding in order\r\nnot to dissipate the efforts that were necessary to reach\r\nconsensus.\r\nAmong the reforms that have enjoyed Slovakias\r\nlong-standing support is the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil. This is an issue on which, despite ongoing\r\nefforts, we were unable to reach a balanced agreement.\r\nWe need a more democratic and more representative\r\nSecurity Council that better reflects todays new\r\ngeopolitical situation. The Security Council should be\r\nenlarged in both categories of membership by adding\r\ncountries that play an important role in the global arena\r\nand in the United Nations framework. It is vital that an\r\nenlarged Council retain its effectiveness with regard to\r\ndecision-making.\r\nWe intend to actively support the transition\r\nprocess in Iraq with a view to creating a secure, stable,\r\nunited, prosperous and democratic country, in\r\naccordance with Security Council resolutions. As we\r\ndeclared at the International Conference on Iraq, held\r\non 22 June 2005 in Brussels, Slovakia has decided to\r\nforgive $1.13 billion of Iraqs debt as a tangible\r\ncontribution to that end. We are confident that the Iraqi\r\npeople will use the October referendum to show their\r\nsupport for the new Constitution, and that democratic\r\nparliamentary elections will follow.\r\nStabilizing the western Balkans remains a priority\r\non my countrys foreign policy agenda. Slovakia has\r\nthus far supported the engagement of the United\r\nNations in the region by participating in peacekeeping\r\nand stabilization missions in the Balkans. In our\r\nopinion, the pivotal issue with regard to the\r\nstabilization of the Western Balkans is the future status\r\nof Kosovo, which remains a potential element of\r\ninstability in the region. We denounce all acts of\r\nviolence and intolerance inside the province. We\r\nbelieve that the majority of Kosovars aspire to peace,\r\ndemocracy and development. In particular, we\r\nappreciate the activities of the Special Envoy of the\r\nSecretary-General, Kai Eide.\r\nSlovakia has been approved as the candidate of\r\nthe Group of Eastern European States for a non-\r\npermanent seat in the Security Council in the elections\r\nto be held at this session of the General Assembly.\r\nSlovakia has never been a member of the Security\r\nCouncil, although it has taken an active part in United\r\n24\r\nA/60/PV.10\r\nNations peacekeeping efforts through its participation\r\nin operations in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle\r\nEast.\r\nIf elected to membership in that important body,\r\nthe Slovak Republic will enter the Security Council at\r\na dynamic moment characterized by a changing global\r\nenvironment and by the search for a new security\r\nconsensus. New threats to security represent growing\r\nchallenges to the ability of the international system to\r\nmaintain international peace and security. That\r\ndevelopment will therefore also be a challenge for our\r\ncountry in its capacity as a member of the Security\r\nCouncil, in particular because it will test our readiness\r\nto shoulder greater commitment and responsibility for\r\nstability and security around the world. I want to assure\r\nthe Assembly that Slovakia is ready to take on this\r\nimportant assignment with honour and responsibility.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Slovak\r\nRepublic for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr Ivan Gaparovič, President of the Slovak\r\nRepublic, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, President of\r\nthe Transitional Federal Government of the Somali\r\nDemocratic Republic\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Transitional Federal\r\nGovernment of the Somali Democratic Republic.\r\nMr. Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, President of the\r\nTransitional Federal Government of the Somali\r\nDemocratic Republic, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed,\r\nPresident of the Transitional Federal Government of\r\nthe Somali Democratic Republic, and to invite him to\r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Ahmed: On behalf of the Republic of\r\nSomalia I am very pleased to address this summit here\r\nin New York marking the sixtieth anniversary of\r\nUnited Nations and the fifth anniversary of the\r\nMillennium Summit, which agreed on a number of\r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) to reduce\r\npoverty by 50 per cent by the year 2015. We believe\r\nthat the eight MDGs are desirable and lofty ones, and\r\nwe fully endorse them. Unfortunately, given the\r\ncircumstances of conflict in Somalia, we are unlikely\r\nto attain all of them. However, we are confident that\r\nsome progress will certainly be made.\r\nWith regard to the reform of the United Nations,\r\nSomalia has committed itself to the position taken by\r\nthe African Union (AU) at Sirte, Libya.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to reaffirm\r\nSomalias appreciation for, and approval of, the United\r\nNations 60 years of progressive work to maintain peace\r\nwhile concurrently achieving incremental progress\r\ntowards a more equitable and liveable world. The\r\nhistory of the United Nations involvement in Somalia\r\nis a good example of its invaluable role in helping the\r\nemerging nations of the world. Despite momentary\r\nsetbacks, the United Nations has taken a laudable role\r\nat each juncture of Somalias history, from colonialism\r\nto independence and throughout our nationhood.\r\nNothing better demonstrates the importance of\r\nthe United Nations than the nurturing role it played\r\nduring the sad days of our 15-year-long civil war.\r\nWhile assisting the destitute and providing safe\r\nsanctuary for an exodus of Somali refugees to\r\nneighbouring countries and elsewhere, the United\r\nNations had the political will to invoke the morally\r\ncompelling doctrine of humanitarian intervention,\r\nthereby successfully reversing a calamitous famine that\r\ncould potentially have wiped out millions of Somalis.\r\nMoreover, during the two years that the Somalia\r\nNational Reconciliation Conference met at Nairobi,\r\nKenya, the United Nations played a helpful role in\r\nsuccessfully finding a lasting and comprehensive\r\nsettlement to Somalias political crisis. The current\r\nTransitional Federal Government of Somalia is the\r\noutcome of that political settlement. Allow me to\r\nrestate here Somalias indebtedness and profound\r\nappreciation to those who selflessly helped us during\r\nthe Somali National Reconciliation Conference, as well\r\nas to those who continue to help us in our current\r\npursuit of a peaceful and well-governed Somalia.\r\nAmong others, special gratitude goes to the African\r\nUnion, the Intergovernmental Authority on\r\nDevelopment, the League of Arab States and the\r\nEuropean Union, as well as to the Government of\r\nKenya, for patiently and generously hosting and paying\r\nfor our long peace process.\r\n25\r\nA/60/PV.10\r\nWith regard to relocating to Somalia, the nascent\r\nTransitional Federal Government could not just sit by\r\nand wait until the international community acted. It\r\ntherefore took the daring unilateral initiative, on\r\n13 June 2005, to relocate itself from Nairobi to\r\nSomalia with minimal help. To the dismay of most\r\nsceptics, the massive relocation scheme was completed\r\nwithout any incident. The entire Government is now on\r\nSomali soil. It is my judgement that we owe a status\r\nreport to those who earnestly wanted to witness the rise\r\nof Somalia from the ashes. That report will also be\r\nuseful to those who may continue to doubt the\r\neffectiveness of the Transitional Federal Government\r\nin extricating Somalia from its current predicament of\r\nchaos and lawlessness.\r\nThe Government has continued to tackle the\r\ndaunting tasks inside Somalia at a much faster pace\r\nthan the international community could have\r\nanticipated. What is significant here is that the\r\nTransitional Federal Government is being helped by a\r\nhidden hand that most observers and political analysts\r\nof Somalia have typically regarded as a wild card or a\r\ntotally incalculable factor. They have never clearly\r\nunderstood the importance of correctly accounting for\r\nthe level of popular support that the new Somali\r\nGovernment enjoyed upon relocating to Somalia. The\r\nhigh popularity of the Transitional Federal Government\r\nwithin Somalia turned out to be so strong that the\r\nGovernment owes its very survival to the admiration\r\nand active support it receives from the local\r\npopulation. That factor alone has proven to be more\r\ncrucial to the survival of the Transitional Federal\r\nGovernment than any other form of assistance.\r\nWith the support of its citizens, the new\r\nGovernment has already proceeded to consolidate the\r\ngains and the outcome of the reconciliation process,\r\nwith the aim of addressing the formidable expectations\r\nof the Somali people. As a result, I can confidently\r\nreport to the Assembly today that our efforts at\r\nreclaiming Somalia from its lawlessness are already\r\nunder way and have already produced concrete results\r\non the ground.\r\nThe Government has made phenomenal progress\r\nin the little more than three months since its relocation.\r\nProgress has been made in the recruitment and training\r\nof a modest security force comprised of personnel from\r\nall of Somalias regions; in the extension of State\r\nauthority over much of Somalia; in winning the\r\nallegiance and support of regional leaders and the\r\nSomali public at large; in earning and assuming the\r\nmoral leadership of the nation through responsible\r\ngovernance and peaceful means; and in creating\r\noverarching political momentum that powerfully\r\naugurs for the sure attainment of durable peace and\r\ncontinuity in Somalia.\r\nContrary to the fears some may have had,\r\ntherefore, the advent of the Transitional Federal\r\nGovernment did not turn out to be some kind of cruel\r\nhoax or yet another false start for Somalia. The\r\nsensible actions undertaken by the new Government\r\ninside Somalia have already established its legitimacy\r\nand the kind of moral leadership it enjoys inside\r\nSomalia. The Government is serious and committed to\r\nthe basic social contract it made with its citizens,\r\nnamely, to guarantee peace and security to its people in\r\nreturn for the allegiance they have already conferred\r\nupon their Government.\r\nThere is clearly a unique chance for the\r\nTransitional Federal Government to restore normalcy,\r\nlegitimacy and lasting peace to Somalia. Regrettably,\r\nhowever, the situation is not tenable in the long term.\r\nThe challenges that are hampering the Governments\r\nefforts on the ground are all related to the indifference\r\nof the international community. We believe that the\r\ninternational community has a moral obligation to help\r\nthe new Somali Government in its quest for peace,\r\nstability, territorial integrity and unity in the country in\r\na manner consistent with the United Nations Charter.\r\nNow is the time when the international community\r\nmust assist Somalia in a strong and decisive manner by\r\naddressing the following three challenges.\r\nOne of the challenges for the new Government is\r\nthat most of the international community has yet to\r\nhonour its obligations with regard to ensuring a\r\npeaceful and well-governed Somalia. Even much of its\r\ninitial cheerful pledges to provide material and\r\nfinancial support to the Government have yet to reach\r\nus. Consequently, its actual role in our efforts on the\r\nground remain very confusing to us. We do not\r\nunderstand the new ambivalence of the international\r\ncommunity, which seems to have moderated its initial\r\nenthusiasm to offer Somalia a consolidated rapid\r\nassistance programme.\r\nIn order to address that situation, the international\r\ncommunity must help Somalia by providing the\r\nnecessary financial and political support for the rapid\r\nrehabilitation of infrastructures to house the new\r\n26\r\nA/60/PV.10\r\nGovernment, to provide for budgetary and other\r\nadministrative expenditures, and to tackle the security\r\nissues such as recruiting a national police force,\r\npacification programmes and the implementation of\r\ndemobilization, disarmament and reintegration\r\nprogrammes.\r\nAnother puzzling and more serious problem for\r\nthe new Government of Somalia is the United Nations\r\narms embargo on Somalia. The embargo directly\r\nundermines the Governments genuine efforts to form a\r\nnational security force  to which it has an inherent\r\nright in order to protect the public and keep the peace\r\nby enforcing law and order throughout Somalia. In\r\naddition, it discourages friendly countries that are\r\nwilling to offer help to Somalia from doing so,\r\nespecially in the areas of security and the rule of law.\r\nMoreover, the embargo has delayed the formal\r\ndeployment of the African peace support mission in\r\nSomalia, whose mandate is to protect the Government\r\nand its premises during its capacity-building stage as\r\nwell as to help the Government form and train national\r\nsecurity forces.\r\nIt does not make sense to help Somalis reach a\r\ncomprehensive political settlement of their long\r\nconflict while at the same time denying them the\r\nability to build the institutions through which they can\r\novercome lawlessness in their country. With the\r\ncreation of the new Government and its relocation to\r\nSomalia, the political conditions and realities that\r\nprompted the United Nations to impose an arms\r\nembargo no longer prevail. Whose interests and\r\npurposes does the embargo continue to serve now that\r\nthere is a legitimate Government functioning in\r\nSomalia? In the same vein, in reflecting on the absurd\r\nposition of a nation or Government whose capacity to\r\ninstitute its own law enforcement bodies is neutralized,\r\none wonders what the political or moral relevance of\r\nkeeping Somalia handcuffed by the old embargo can\r\npossibly be? To address that predicament we call on\r\nthe Security Council to assist the efforts of the\r\nTransitional Federal Government to stabilize the\r\ncountry by reviewing the merits of the arms embargo\r\non Somalia and promptly lifting it.\r\nFinally, the disintegration of the State and the\r\nabsence of law and order have led to widespread\r\ncriminal activity by individuals and groups for\r\nfinancial gain, including by war profiteers and\r\nterrorists. Those individuals and groups believe that the\r\nstatus quo in Somalia favours them, and they will\r\ntherefore do whatever they can to resist the return of\r\nlaw and order to Somalia, including by renewing active\r\nhostilities. To address that possible scenario the United\r\nNations must establish punitive and targeted sanctions\r\nagainst those who try to spoil Somalias chance for\r\nlasting peace by undermining the ongoing efforts to\r\npacify the country and by frustrating the effectiveness\r\nof the Government in upholding the primacy of the rule\r\nof law.\r\nThe cost of the prolonged Somali civil war is\r\nenormous in terms of its direct social, economic,\r\npolitical and environmental impacts. There is now\r\nclearly a rare chance for my country to overcome those\r\nnegative impacts. The performance of the Transitional\r\nFederal Government on the ground and the overall\r\npolitical environment in Somalia are very promising.\r\nBoth Africa and the region have been very forthcoming\r\nin helping Somalia. It is imperative that the rest of the\r\ninternational community extend its help to Somalia by\r\nadopting the three proposals just outlined, thereby\r\neffectively ending the plight of Somalia once and for\r\nall.\r\nAllow me here to make my personal appeal to the\r\nworld summit not to leave Somalia out in the cold in\r\nthis crucial period of its pacification and nation-\r\nbuilding. While many of the countries of the world are\r\nstruggling to meet their Millennium Development\r\nGoals, Somalia is struggling to stand on its feet. It\r\nwould be grave negligence on the part of the\r\ninternational community if it fails to fulfil its\r\nobligations towards Somalia in a timely and decisive\r\nmanner.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the\r\nTransitional Federal Government of the Somali\r\nDemocratic Republic for the statement he has just\r\nmade.\r\nMr. Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, President of the\r\nTransitional Federal Government of the Somali\r\nDemocratic Republic, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\n27\r\nA/60/PV.10\r\nAddress by Mr. Tabaré Vázquez, President of the\r\nEastern Republic of Uruguay\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Eastern Republic of\r\nUruguay.\r\nMr. Tabaré Vázquez, President of the Eastern\r\nRepublic of Uruguay, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Tabaré Vázquez, President\r\nof the Eastern Republic of Uruguay, and to invite him\r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Vázquez  (spoke in Spanish): I would\r\nlike to extend the sincerest condolences of the people\r\nand Government of the Eastern Republic of Uruguay to\r\nthe victims of Hurricane Katrina, as well as to all the\r\ncitizens of the world, men and women, old and young,\r\nwho are victims of natural disasters, of the fury of\r\nnature, which is showing us that it will no longer be\r\nabused by mankind.\r\nI come from Uruguay, a small South American\r\ncountry, whose main wealth is its vocation for peace,\r\nits drive for freedom and the democratic commitment\r\nthat its people have been forging for generations.\r\nI convey the greetings of the people and\r\nGovernment of Uruguay to this forum, which is the\r\nbroadest, most representative and most important\r\nforum in the world today. It is a greeting that is\r\ndemanding, committed and hopeful.\r\nThe greeting is demanding because we are living\r\nat a very particular time in the history of mankind. In\r\nfact, at very few moments in history have we seen\r\ncircumstances so rich in paradoxes and so poor in\r\nparadigms as the present one. Never before has\r\nmankind had at its disposal such scientific and\r\ntechnological progress and such a significant cultural\r\nheritage to guarantee a life in dignity. However, never\r\nbefore has mankind suffered so much inequality,\r\nintolerance and uncertainty.\r\nWe know that we have reached this point, but we\r\nare uncertain about where we are heading. We cannot\r\nbe passive witnesses to the situation; no one can wash\r\nhis hands of his own problems nor of problems that\r\nseem remote. We cannot resign ourselves to a future\r\nthat is an unchanging extension of the present. There is\r\nno reason whatsoever to give up the hope of a utopia,\r\nwithout which darkness could be our fate.\r\nOur greeting is committed because we all bear the\r\nresponsibility, which we cannot abdicate, of being the\r\nmasters of our own lives and the architects of our own\r\nfutures. This task is a road on which neither privileges\r\nnor condemnations are allowed; we are all travelling\r\non an equal footing. Nor does this road permit\r\nshortcuts. History is neither a gallery of national heroes\r\nnor a calendar of outstanding events: history is made\r\nby people day by day.\r\nIn this context, we upon whom our peoples have\r\nconferred the task of governing have a very demanding\r\nresponsibility ahead of us. And that is because\r\ngoverning means managing with efficiency and\r\ntransparency: it means articulating in a democratic\r\nfashion this rich and complex network that is society.\r\nBut to govern means also to envisage the future and to\r\ncall upon people to build that future among all and for\r\nall.\r\nOur greeting is hopeful as well. Although we do\r\nnot overlook the risks, the difficulties and the limits\r\nwithin the national, regional and global contexts, we\r\nbelieve in human beings, we believe in society. We\r\nbelieve in democracy as a means to govern but also as\r\na human impulse and as a state of society.\r\nAlthough I said this during our statement at the\r\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting which took place in this\r\nsame Hall a few hours ago, I wish to reiterate before\r\nthe Assembly that the Eastern Republic of Uruguay\r\nreaffirms the principles that have characterized its\r\nforeign policy.\r\nFirst is the firm commitment to peace,\r\nsovereignty, democracy and solidarity. When I speak\r\nabout peace, democracy, solidarity and freedom I\r\nwould like to recall that six days ago marked the thirty-\r\nsecond anniversary of the occasion when a man gave\r\nhis life defending peace, democracy and freedom. I\r\nwould like thus to pay tribute to Salvador Allende.\r\nThe second principle is the firm rejection of any\r\nkind of terrorism, violence and discrimination. The\r\nthird is the inalienable right of every State to safe and\r\nstable borders and to be completely free to exercise its\r\nsovereignty and self-determination, and fourth is\r\nrespect for international law as the best guarantee of\r\nthe sovereignty of peoples and their peaceful\r\ncoexistence.\r\n28\r\nA/60/PV.10\r\nThe fifth principle is non-alignment and non-\r\nintervention in affairs that come under the domestic\r\njurisdiction of States. Sixthly, we reaffirm\r\nmultilateralism as a means to strengthen international\r\nlaw, enhancing the role of the United Nations. Seventh,\r\nwe acknowledge the indivisibility of all human rights,\r\nbe they political, social, economic, civil or cultural,\r\nincluding those of a collective nature such as the right\r\nto development and to a safe environment.\r\nIn conformity with these principles, Uruguay first\r\nof all deems it necessary to move forward with the\r\nreforms that will allow the United Nations to fully\r\nfulfil its commitments. Because such reforms are of a\r\ncomplex nature, they should be undertaken with a\r\nsense of history and with political will, and without\r\nhegemonic intentions.\r\nSecondly, Uruguay renews its commitment to the\r\nMillennium Goals, which in our country means the\r\ndesign and implementation of a system of integrated\r\nand global social policies that address the poverty and\r\ndestitution suffered by almost one million Uruguayans\r\nand that, at the same time, are part of a strategy of\r\nchange and development.\r\nThirdly, Uruguay reiterates its will to continue\r\nparticipating in United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations and will contribute its efforts to improving\r\nthe security and the conditions of service of those\r\nmissions.\r\nWe also express our support for the Secretary-\r\nGenerals initiative to create a Peace Commission, to\r\nwhich, we believe, Uruguay could contribute,\r\ncontinuing its support for peacekeeping missions and\r\nthe expertise acquired in rebuilding devastated\r\ncountries.\r\nThere is no peace in intolerance and terrorism, no\r\nfreedom in poverty, and no democracy in inequality. It\r\nis crucial to reject every expression of violence, but\r\nbefore rejecting it, it must be avoided by attacking its\r\nroots.\r\nThis is quite simply because every human being,\r\nsimply by being human, has the right to live in dignity.\r\nSocieties where there is a contrast between an opulent\r\nfew and a neglected majority are not prosperous.\r\nSocieties where to be born is a problem, to be young is\r\nsuspect, to get an education and a job is a privilege and\r\nto grow old is a curse have no future. This is the way\r\nwe see it in Uruguay. We have learned this from those\r\ngenerations that preceded us in building a country that,\r\nthough it has its own unique features, is not atypical of\r\nnor alien to the Latin American context.\r\nWhile it is true that the first half of the last\r\ncentury was a favourable period for Uruguay, it is also\r\ntrue that  due to a combination of external\r\ncircumstances and domestic structural weaknesses \r\nthe last fifty years were a period of economic\r\ndeterioration, impoverishment and even an institutional\r\nbreakdown in 1973.\r\nWe Uruguayans regained democracy in 1985, and\r\nthe current Government, which took office exactly 200\r\ndays ago, is working hard to heal the wounds\r\ndictatorship caused through human rights violations.\r\nWe are not hostages to the past, but Uruguayan society\r\nneeds to know the truth about what happened to ensure\r\nthat never again will it happen  never again.\r\nNevertheless, with the commitments that we have\r\nassumed to Uruguayan society  whose will is our\r\nmandate  the Government of which I am head is\r\npromoting changes: changes which are necessary,\r\npossible, responsible and gradual, changes with\r\npolitical and social support, changes that do not\r\noverlook reality but do not give up on the dream of a\r\nUruguay with human development, with productive\r\neconomic growth and with a safe environment, a\r\nUruguay fully integrated into its own region and into\r\nthe international arena. We are not starting from\r\nscratch, but we have a lot to do to achieve this utopia,\r\nthe dream of which motivates us as a nation.\r\nIn conclusion, this is exactly what I wished to\r\nconvey to members on behalf of the Government and\r\nthe people of the Eastern Republic of Uruguay: far\r\naway, in the forgotten southern part of South America,\r\nthere is a country that does not resign itself to\r\ndifficulties, that is building its own destiny and that,\r\nfaithful to its tradition, wishes to join in building a\r\nbetter world, working alongside all our dear brethren,\r\nthe citizens of the world.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Eastern\r\nRepublic of Uruguay for the statement he has just\r\nmade.\r\nMr. Tabaré Vázquez, President of the Eastern\r\nRepublic of Uruguay, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\n29\r\nA/60/PV.10\r\nAddress by Mr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Equatorial\r\nGuinea.\r\nMr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, President\r\nof the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, was\r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema\r\nMbasogo, President of the Republic of Equatorial\r\nGuinea, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Obiang Nguema Mbasogo (spoke in\r\nSpanish): The Republic of Equatorial Guinea is\r\nparticipating in this debate with hope and optimism\r\nthat we will see the United Nations system\r\nstrengthened once again so that it can effectively carry\r\nout its mission as the centre of global equilibrium in\r\norder to attain the objectives established at its creation\r\nin 1945.\r\nIndeed, the United Nations was created to defend\r\nand promote the rights of persons and the dignity,\r\nfreedom and equality of human beings. The United\r\nNations was created to promote the equality of all\r\nnations, mutual respect, solidarity and the promotion of\r\ncooperation among States on an equal footing and for\r\nmutual benefit. Another of the objectives established\r\nwas to promote the global development of nations\r\nthrough a just and equitable economic system that\r\nwould protect the interests of all countries, rich or\r\npoor.\r\nThe United Nations must be given the\r\ninternational authority it needs to establish peace, order\r\nand stability in the world, serving as a centre of\r\nuniversal equilibrium with the capacity to resolve\r\nconflicts arising among States. Force must be used\r\nonly in conformity with the provisions of the Charter\r\nof the United Nations, with the prior consent of its\r\ncompetent bodies, because the undue use of force can\r\ndisrupt international peace and security in an\r\nunforeseeable manner.\r\nWe hope that the United Nations system will be\r\nthe inspiration for a democratic culture and for human\r\nrights, serving as a model and guide for the internal\r\norganization of its Members. We therefore support the\r\ncreation of a Human Rights Council that will be very\r\nclosely involved with human-rights-related issues in\r\neach country and that will have relevant competencies\r\nto support the affected countries with regard to the\r\ndecisions and recommendations of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council.\r\nThe democratization of societies and good\r\ngovernance are concepts universally accepted by\r\nStates. Therefore, there is no need to adopt coercive\r\nmechanisms against any State to ensure their\r\nimplementation. All that is needed is to assist and\r\nguide each State as to how it should assimilate\r\ndemocratic concepts in accordance with its economic,\r\nsocial and cultural realities.\r\nFor all those reasons, we believe that, 60 years\r\nafter the Organizations founding, the social and\r\npolitical circumstances that prevailed in 1945 have lost\r\ntheir validity because of the very dynamics of the\r\ndevelopment of modern societies. Today, we are in the\r\nbest possible position to rethink the responsibilities of\r\nthe United Nations and its Members in the light of the\r\naforementioned objectives, bearing in mind todays\r\ncircumstances and the experience accumulated in the\r\n60 years of its existence.\r\nWe recognize that the task is very difficult and\r\ncomplex, taking into account the various interests that\r\nconverge as we consider reforming the entire United\r\nNations system. That is why we congratulate you,\r\nMr. President, on the confidence that the international\r\ncommunity has placed in you and in your Government\r\nto moderate this important debate. We hope that your\r\nskill and professional experience will be put to good\r\nuse so that we can attain our objectives.\r\nWe believe that in this effort, we must give\r\npriority to the spirit of democracy and the interests of\r\nhumankind, because democracy, as the expression of\r\nthe popular will, and compliance with consensual\r\nnorms both involve respect for the collective will. We\r\nalso believe that the United Nations could not impose\r\norder and justice on a human community dominated by\r\nthe various cultural, economic and political interests of\r\nits Member States without recourse to the democratic\r\nprinciples to which all of us are bound. In that\r\nconnection, the Security Council, as the organ that\r\nmust demand universal compliance with its decisions,\r\nmust be the first to act under democratic criteria.\r\nFor my country, the needed reform of the\r\nSecurity Council does not involve an increase in its\r\nmembership or, even less, an expansion of the right of\r\n30\r\nA/60/PV.10\r\nthe veto. We must examine the reasons for the Security\r\nCouncils failure since its creation in 1945. In fact, if\r\nthere is something that should be done to reform the\r\nSecurity Council, it is to simply revoke the right of the\r\nveto enjoyed by some of its members as a concept that\r\nwas created only because of the conflict between two\r\nopposing ideological systems within the United\r\nNations system. The veto has never allowed the\r\nconsensus or majority sovereign expression of the\r\nSecurity Council; it has served only as a way in which\r\nto block the popular will so as to protect the interests\r\nof the Power exercising the veto.\r\nIn the present circumstances of a unipolar world,\r\nwe do not see the need to exercise the veto in this\r\nUnited Nations body. Many just resolutions have been\r\nvetoed despite the fact that they have sought the\r\ncommon good, and we have seen the negative results.\r\nIf the veto must be maintained in the Security Council\r\nbecause of interests, we ask that Africa also have that\r\nright, because, like any other regional group, that\r\ncontinent has many interests to defend.\r\nWhen the Security Council is democratized we\r\nask that its decisions be binding and that those who do\r\nnot comply with them be properly sanctioned. This\r\nwould give teeth to its decisions. Non-compliance with\r\nthe principles and resolutions adopted by United\r\nNations bodies creates impunity unless disciplinary\r\nmeasures are taken against those who are in breach of\r\nthem.\r\nIn this regard, Equatorial Guinea strongly regrets\r\nthe failure to take measures against the terrorists who\r\ntried to overthrow the established constitutional\r\nGovernment on 6 March 2004 despite identification of\r\nnationalities of the terrorists and despite Equatorial\r\nGuineas request to the Governments concerned.\r\nThe United Nations must clearly define the\r\nphenomenon of terrorism and in so doing avoid\r\nconfusion with what is interpreted as legitimate armed\r\nintervention. Humanitarian intervention cannot be\r\ncarried out on the basis of an individual interpretation,\r\nbut rather must be justified by the competent\r\ninstitutions of the United Nations system.\r\nQuestions related to organized transnational\r\ncrime, such as terrorism and mercenary activities, must\r\nbe the subject of a special session of the General\r\nAssembly to deal with criminal acts such as those of\r\n11 September in New York, 11 March in Madrid and\r\nevents in London, Russia, Morocco, Tanzania, Kenya\r\nand the mercenary attack in Equatorial Guinea and to\r\nadopt measures that can avert the loss of innocent life.\r\nIn Equatorial Guinea, the integration of women\r\ninto our development process is receiving the\r\nGovernments utmost attention through the design of\r\nliteracy programmes for them and their gradual\r\nintegration in economic activities and political\r\ninstitutions with a specific percentage reserved for\r\nwomen.\r\nLastly, we want environmental problems, whose\r\neffects are of unforeseeable magnitude in each State, to\r\nbe addressed with due sensitivity, respect and\r\nsolidarity, in the same way as questions of world peace\r\nand security.\r\nWe reaffirm that the primary responsibility for\r\npromoting sustainable development in each country\r\nresides directly with the Government concerned.\r\nMultilateral and bilateral assistance only complement\r\nthe efforts of States themselves and provide guidance\r\nfor what must be accomplished internally by each\r\ncountry.\r\nAmong these efforts, Equatorial Guinea supports\r\nthe Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative\r\nproposed by the United Kingdom. Nonetheless, we\r\nbelieve that transparency must be required not only of\r\nGovernments but also of the economic players that\r\ncontrol these industries. It is, therefore, necessary that\r\nan international monitoring body be established to\r\nintervene in the activities of both Governments and\r\neconomic enterprises.\r\nWe welcome the report submitted for the\r\nAssemblys consideration as it contains important\r\nrecommendations, above all regarding the development\r\nprogramme.\r\nI wish to conclude by calling for greater\r\nsolidarity and a spirit of commitment from all the\r\nMembers of the United Nations so that we can make\r\nthis Organization an ideological model that serves the\r\naspirations of present and future generations.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Equatorial Guinea for the statement he has just\r\nmade.\r\nMr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, President\r\nof the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, was\r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\n31\r\nA/60/PV.10\r\nItem 9 of the provisional agenda (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Begum Khaleda Zia, Prime Minister of\r\nthe Peoples Republic of Bangladesh\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Prime Minister of the Peoples Republic\r\nof Bangladesh.\r\nBegum Khaleda Zia, Prime Minister of the\r\nPeoples Republic of Bangladesh, was escorted to\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming Her Excellency Begum Khaleda Zia, Prime\r\nMinister of the Peoples Republic of Bangladesh, and\r\ninviting her to address the General Assembly.\r\nMs. Zia (Bangladesh) (spoke in Bangla; English\r\ntext provided by the delegation): I wish to congratulate\r\nyou, Mr. President, on your election. I am confident\r\nthat you will carry forward the able legacy left by your\r\npredecessor, Mr. Jean Ping. Our warm tribute is also\r\ndue to the Secretary-General as he strives to\r\nreinvigorate our Organization.\r\nWe meet in the wake of the High-level Plenary\r\nMeeting, where bold decisions were made to promote\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nOur problems transcend national boundaries. Solutions\r\nneed a global consensus. All of us must emphatically\r\nreaffirm the central role of the United Nations in the\r\ncooperative management of the worlds problems.\r\nWe are constitutionally committed to uphold the\r\nCharter and its legitimacy based on the rule of law. In a\r\nglobalizing world, no nation is an island. None can\r\nprosper alone. The United Nations remains the only\r\nbastion of peace, justice and development in the world.\r\nReform of the United Nations is vital. We must\r\nfocus on its effectiveness and ability to deliver quickly.\r\nIts agenda and mandate must be meaningful. Its\r\nadministration must be reformed. Its budget must be\r\npurged of waste. Its major organs need to be\r\nreconstituted and revitalized to serve purposeful\r\npriorities. Expansion of its major organs is necessary\r\nbut must be tailored to the efficacy of the Organization.\r\nThe dynamics of todays world have been created\r\nby immense forces of change. Among them are\r\nadvances in science and technology and widespread\r\nawareness of individual rights. The resulting\r\nglobalization and progression of humanitarian law have\r\ngiven rise to a world where the very concept of\r\nsovereignty is being challenged, where the dimensions\r\nof security are in a flux, where the nature of conflict\r\nhas seen a seismic shift and where social exclusion has\r\nadded complex uncertainty. The need for constructive\r\nengagement, dialogue, tolerance and understanding is\r\nimperative. Development and the rule of law must take\r\ncentre stage.\r\nNew challenges confront us today. While\r\nterrorists sow panic and xenophobia in our societies,\r\ndeprivation, hunger, disease and environmental\r\ndegradation continue to fuel insecurity and\r\ndestabilization. The recent bombings in London and\r\nEgypt shocked us all. They have hardened our resolve\r\nto face this menace unitedly. Bangladesh condemns\r\nterrorism in all its forms. We have acceded to all anti-\r\nterrorism conventions of the United Nations and\r\nrelevant regional organizations. We support the early\r\nconclusion of a comprehensive United Nations\r\nconvention on terrorism. I would like to underscore our\r\nconviction that terrorists do not belong to any one\r\ncountry or religion.\r\nIn Bangladesh, sustained efforts are being made\r\nto pursue the twin objectives of responsibility at home\r\nand a contribution abroad. Despite enormous\r\nconstraints, we have made good progress to advance\r\ndemocracy, development and human rights. We\r\nrecognize that those goals are linked with one another.\r\nWe have moved slowly but surely to shore up a\r\ndemocratic ethos. The late President Ziaur Rahman led\r\nBangladesh out of the morass of a failed democracy in\r\n1975. He introduced a multi-party system, freed the\r\npress and opened up the economy. In 1990, a popular\r\nuprising against an entrenched military dictatorship\r\nbrought the first real push towards sustained\r\ndemocracy. We have not looked back. Three\r\nconsecutive free and fair elections have been held\r\nunder a neutral caretaker Government. That unique\r\nconstitutional innovation has ensured the peaceful\r\ntransfer of power on an alternating basis. Democracy\r\nhas become firmly rooted in Bangladesh. A key\r\nelement of the last election, in 2001, was the\r\nparticipation of more than 70 per cent of the electorate.\r\nWomen voters outnumbered men. They voted not for\r\nsymbols but for issues.\r\n32\r\nA/60/PV.10\r\nA quiet revolution is under way in Bangladesh in\r\nthe field of development. The progress is visible on six\r\nkey fronts: stable growth of the gross domestic product\r\n(GDP) at a rate of 5 per cent or more for over two\r\ndecades; higher per capita income; food security;\r\nincreased resilience in the face of natural disasters;\r\nimprovement of the human development index; and\r\nbetter social and health outcomes. Our performance in\r\nthose areas compares favourably with the results in our\r\nown region and elsewhere. A set of pragmatic, targeted\r\npolicy approaches have made that progress possible.\r\nWe have completed a full-fledged poverty reduction\r\nstrategy paper through an extended consultative\r\nprocess. It sets out a road map to meet country-specific\r\nMDGs. The fundamental principle of the poverty\r\nreduction strategy paper is to promote employment-\r\ngenerating economic growth and to invest significantly\r\nin priority sectors such as education, health and social\r\nsafety-net programmes. It is a matter of some\r\nsatisfaction that Bangladesh has achieved two of the\r\nMDGs: the elimination of gender disparity in primary\r\nand secondary schools and access to safe drinking\r\nwater. We are close to achieving two more goals: the\r\nreduction of extreme poverty and under-five child\r\nmortality rates.\r\nBangladesh is committed to upholding the dignity\r\nof individuals and promoting human rights. Bangladesh\r\nis a party to all United Nations human rights\r\nconventions. We are moving steadily to strengthen\r\ngood governance through strong democratic\r\ninstitutions, establish the rule of law and eliminate\r\nintolerance in our society.\r\nDeeply entrenched pockets of poverty continue to\r\nexist around the world. The most vulnerable are the\r\nleast developed countries. Their products should be\r\ngranted immediate duty-free and quota-free access\r\nglobally. As reaffirmed at Monterrey, the specific\r\nallocation of 0.15 to 0.2 per cent of the GDP of\r\ndeveloped countries must be earmarked for official\r\ndevelopment assistance to least developed countries.\r\nFinancing for development is a critical issue.\r\nInnovative initiatives in that regard, which have been\r\nthe subject of discussion, need to be pursued in earnest.\r\nThe devastation caused by natural disasters\r\naffects all countries, rich and poor alike. How can we\r\nmeet the challenge of effective relief, rehabilitation and\r\nreconstruction, as well as pre-disaster warning and\r\npreparations? That continues to the responsibility of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nWe are profoundly shocked at the huge toll of\r\ndamage caused by Hurricane Katrina on the Gulf coast\r\nof the United States. Natural disasters do not\r\ndistinguish between rich and poor countries, and the\r\nhuman misery and suffering caused are the same. We,\r\nin Bangladesh, have weathered many severe floods and\r\ncyclones, and the toll in terms of life and property has\r\nbeen huge. We can therefore feel the torment that the\r\naffected people have undergone, and we offer our\r\nheartfelt sympathies. We know that the American\r\npeople can overcome the disaster and move on with\r\ntheir lives.\r\nAll countries, including Bangladesh, must seek\r\nways and means to contribute effectively to the United\r\nNations, whether through peacemaking, peacekeeping\r\nor peacebuilding. Active participation, innovative ideas\r\nand best practices in shoring up development together\r\ncan enhance our combined capacity to address the\r\nworlds problems, especially those that no one country\r\ncan tackle alone. We, in Bangladesh, are particularly\r\nproud of our contribution to peacekeeping on many\r\nsimultaneous fronts across the globe. In all, we have\r\ncontributed more than 39,000 troops to 24 missions\r\nand are currently among the largest contributors. Sixty-\r\nseven of our blue-helmeted soldiers have died in that\r\ncause. Our commitment to peacekeeping remains\r\nunflinching. We also fully support the establishment of\r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission.\r\nA priority concern for us is our close identity\r\nwith Africa. Through our peacekeeping efforts, we\r\nhave established special bonds of friendship. The New\r\nPartnership for Africas Development is particularly\r\nencouraging. We believe that South-South cooperation\r\nhas specific relevance in that context.\r\nBangladesh reaffirms its support for the early\r\nestablishment of a sovereign independent State in\r\nPalestine, in accordance with the relevant United\r\nNations resolutions. The road map for peace in the\r\nMiddle East needs to be implemented fully and\r\nurgently.\r\nWith respect to Iraq, we believe that the present\r\nsituation should be resolved by preserving the interests\r\nof the Iraqi people, in particular their territorial\r\nintegrity, and by ensuring the long-term peace, security\r\nand stability of the region.\r\nBangladeshs constitutional commitment to\r\ngeneral and complete disarmament is the reason for our\r\nprogressive support of international and regional\r\n33\r\nA/60/PV.10\r\ntreaties and agreements covering all the Atomic Bomb\r\nCasualty Commission (ABCC) weapons. We are a\r\nparty to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\r\nTreaty. We give precedence to human over weapons\r\nsecurity.\r\nEach year we come to the Assembly to reaffirm\r\nour faith in the United Nations. This sixtieth\r\nanniversary year is of profound significance. We must\r\nprovide a renewed mandate to the United Nations to\r\nmeet the challenges of the new millennium  to rid\r\nthe world of poverty and injustice, to usher in the rule\r\nof law, to promote the cause of development, to\r\neradicate terrorism and, above all, to promote peace\r\nand security. We can prevail only if we act responsibly\r\nand together. Support for the United Nations and its\r\nlegitimacy remains a paramount priority.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the\r\nPeoples Republic of Bangladesh for the statement she\r\nhas just made.\r\nBegum Khaleda Zia, Prime Minister of the\r\nPeoples Republic of Bangladesh, was escorted\r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Jean-Paul Proust, Secretary of State\r\nof the Principality of Monaco\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Secretary of State of the Principality of\r\nMonaco.\r\nMr. Jean-Paul Proust, Secretary of State of the\r\nPrincipality of Monaco, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Jean-Paul Proust,\r\nSecretary of State of the Principality of Monaco, and\r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Proust (Monaco) (spoke in French): In 1945,\r\nin the aftermath of a war that tore apart all the peoples\r\nof the world  a war during which the most basic\r\nhuman rights were violated  a few leading countries\r\ncame together at the San Francisco Conference, here in\r\nthe United States of America, and created the United\r\nNations. Collective security had to be restored, human\r\nrights had to be reinstated and our world needed to\r\nmove towards greater justice and freedom.\r\nMuch has been achieved over the past 60 years.\r\nToday, our Organization consists of 191 Member\r\nStates. We hope  and many heads of State or\r\nGovernment expressed this wish during the recent\r\nsummit  that we are beginning a new phase in the\r\nquest for collective security and respect for human\r\nrights and in the fight against poverty and disease,\r\nwhich continue to affect so many peoples.\r\nTo that end, the international community must be\r\nbetter represented, particularly in the Security Council.\r\nFurther progress must also be made through the\r\nestablishment of the Human Rights Council, the\r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals\r\n(MDGs) to combat poverty and the more efficient\r\nmanagement of the Organization.\r\nOnce again, on behalf of His Serene Highness\r\nPrince Albert II, I wish to pay tribute to the President\r\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session and\r\nto you, Sir, on your election to the presidency at the\r\nsixtieth session. I hope that, throughout our debates at\r\nthis session, the momentum for change will continue to\r\nbuild. I would also like to pay tribute to the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, who has pursued\r\nthose noble objectives with tenacity and farsightedness.\r\nThe Principality of Monaco fully endorses the\r\noutcome document, and will support its\r\nimplementation so that we can, together, achieve new\r\nprogress in the coming months.\r\nThe Government of the Principality of Monaco\r\nhas, over the past few years, reoriented its international\r\ncooperation policy in order to contribute more\r\neffectively to the achievement of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. Thus, the main focus of Monacos\r\ncooperation policies are those defined in the\r\nframework of the Millennium Development Goals: the\r\npreservation of the environment in the broad sense of\r\nthe term; the fight against poverty; and support for\r\neducation and health care.\r\nMonacos official development assistance (ODA)\r\nhas continued to increase, multiplying fivefold in the\r\npast 10 years  an effort that will continue in the years\r\nto come with a view to reaching the 0.7 per cent target\r\nas soon as possible. Likewise, we endorse the\r\nDeclaration on innovative sources of financing for\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThrough its voluntary contributions to the United\r\nNations and several other institutions and agencies,\r\n34\r\nA/60/PV.10\r\nincluding the United Nations Educational, Scientific\r\nand Cultural Organization, the World Health\r\nOrganization, the Joint United Nations Programme on\r\nHIV/AIDS, UNICEF, the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP) and the Office of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees, to name but\r\na few, the Principality sponsors activities aimed at\r\nassisting developing countries and the most\r\nunderprivileged populations.\r\nOver one third of our cooperation funding is\r\nprovided within the framework of multilateral\r\nassistance, and the increase over the past few years\r\nhas, of course, also benefited bilateral assistance.\r\nThe General Assembly proclaimed 2005 as the\r\nInternational Year of Microcredit in an effort to\r\npromote such programmes globally. The Principality\r\nhas, for many years, accorded special attention to\r\nmicrocredit, as part of our financing for development\r\nprogramme, in particular through its cooperation with\r\nUNDP. In this regard, funds provided by Monaco\r\nprovide support for small businesses in Africa that are\r\noperating under conditions of extreme poverty, with a\r\nview to improving the standard of living of the most\r\nvulnerable people, particularly women.\r\nOur cooperation efforts are directed mostly\r\ntowards the countries of the Mediterranean region and\r\nthe least developed countries in Africa, especially\r\nthose of sub-Saharan Africa, because we also believe\r\nthat we need to open up spaces for regional solidarity\r\nthroughout the world.\r\nThe Mediterranean is an ecoregion with which\r\nthe Principality has, historically, been closely involved.\r\nThe implementation of cooperation plans to protect the\r\nMediterranean environment, both coastal and marine,\r\nis therefore a priority.\r\nMonaco also provides assistance to a number of\r\nFrench-speaking countries in areas relating largely to\r\npoverty eradication, health care and education.\r\nWorking in complementarity with the Government,\r\nMonacos non-governmental organizations are also\r\ncommitted in those countries. I would like to\r\nunderscore that the Principality is ready to participate,\r\nto the best of its abilities and within its financial\r\nmeans, in initiatives in the areas of health care and\r\ntraining.\r\nDuring his recent address from this rostrum,\r\nPrince Albert II expressed great sadness in connection\r\nwith the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina in\r\nthe United States.\r\nAlmost one year ago, South-East Asia suffered an\r\nunprecedented natural disaster. The solidarity shown in\r\nthe aftermath of that tragedy and the effectiveness of\r\nthe response to it, on the part of not only humanitarian\r\nworkers but also civil society, make it clear that the\r\nresources and the capacity do exist to allow for shared\r\nresponsibility for the future welfare of the peoples to\r\nwhom the Charter is dedicated. The Principality of\r\nMonaco has mobilized` its efforts by undertaking a\r\ngreat many private and public activities in this respect.\r\nThe Principality of Monaco has always been a\r\nstaunch defender of humanitarian law. We support in\r\nprinciple and on the basis of our convictions any action\r\naimed at alleviating difficult situations resulting from\r\nnatural or manmade disasters.\r\nThe Principality of Monaco is a small State that\r\nenjoys a certain level of wealth. It cannot change the\r\nworld on its own, but it intends to set an example in the\r\nfield of cooperation.\r\nThe creation of the Human Rights Council and\r\nthe establishment of a Peacebuilding Commission will\r\nmark a turning point in the history of the Organization.\r\nEven more importantly, they represent a response to\r\ndevelopments in multilateral relations.\r\nIn keeping with the document just adopted, the\r\nGeneral Assembly will also have to strengthen the\r\nOffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights;\r\nestablish the rule of law assistance unit within the\r\nSecretariat; and work constructively to ensure that the\r\nemerging concept of responsibility to protect becomes\r\npositive law as soon as possible.\r\nIn this regard, I would insist on the imperative\r\nneed to put an end to impunity for crimes committed\r\nagainst children.\r\nThe defence of the rights and interests of children\r\nhas always been one of our major concerns. Indeed,\r\nany act of violence against a child is a violation of the\r\nlofty principles for which the United Nations stands. In\r\norder to build a world fit for children, in compliance\r\nwith the measures adopted during the special session of\r\nthe General Assembly on children, held in May 2002,\r\nthe Government of the Principality is deeply dedicated\r\nto promoting the concept that there should be no statute\r\nof limitations for the most serious violations of the\r\nrights of children, and that we should expand the\r\n35\r\nA/60/PV.10\r\npowers of national jurisdictions by providing them\r\nwith universal competence in that area.\r\nPrince Albert II, during his address to the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-ninth session, invited the\r\ninternational community to give thought to a plan to\r\naddress the impunity that continues to prevail with\r\nregard to the most heinous crimes committed against\r\nchildren.\r\nIn that context, the Principality has stressed the\r\npromotion of that concept in the resolution on the\r\nRights of the Child, adopted last year by the General\r\nAssembly, and it has reaffirmed its position during the\r\nsession of the Human Rights Commission held last\r\nApril in Geneva. It is the wish of the Principality to\r\npursue its undertaking with the support of the\r\ninternational community on those crucial matters.\r\nIn other respects, the Monegasque Government\r\nhas paid close attention and contributed financially to\r\nthe global study on violence against children led by\r\nProfessor Pinheiro, which will present its conclusions\r\nin October 2006. Likewise, the Principality actively\r\nparticipated, along with the European Council, in the\r\ntriennial programme of action  for the period 2005-\r\n2007  entitled Childhood and violence, whose\r\nconclusions, like that of the global study on violence\r\nagainst children, will enable us to make specific\r\nrecommendations to States. The Principality of\r\nMonaco will always support all international initiatives\r\naimed at enhancing the protection of children.\r\nRespect for the environment is also one of our\r\nconcerns. Mr. President, it was in your country,\r\nSweden, just over three decades ago that environmental\r\nlaw was born. The Stockholm Conference saw the\r\nemergence of a discipline that met a need: to address\r\nthe protection of natural resources and of our\r\nenvironment in an organized manner.\r\nFurthermore, we have decided to join the Kyoto\r\nProtocol, and we hope, in the tradition of the\r\nOceanographic Institute  created 100 years ago by\r\nPrince Albert I of Monaco  to make our contribution\r\nto studies on the future of our planet.\r\nHowever, the United Nations Environment\r\nProgramme is no longer the ideal forum to coordinate\r\naction and ensure its effectiveness because of the\r\nextremely rapid expansion of this field and given the\r\nmany conventions, protocols and agreements that have\r\nbeen adopted. That is why we support the idea of\r\ncreating a United Nations environmental body.\r\nGlobalization must not make us forget that we\r\ncome from different regions and cultures that should\r\nenrich one another and not be a source of clashes or of\r\nconflicts.\r\nWe believe in interaction between the United\r\nNations and regional organizations; one sets the\r\ngeneral rules, and the others facilitate their\r\nimplementation at the local level.\r\nThe reforms just adopted at the High-level\r\nPlenary Meeting strengthen the unique position of the\r\nGeneral Assembly as the guarantor of the systems\r\ncoherence.\r\nI can assure the Assembly that Monaco will\r\ncontinue resolutely to make its contribution, however\r\nmodest, to building a better world, with full respect for\r\nour differences.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the Secretary of\r\nState of the Principality of Monaco for the statement he\r\nhas just made.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Ibrahim al-Jaafari,\r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Iraq\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Prime Minister of the Republic of Iraq.\r\nMr. Ibrahim al-Jaafari, Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Iraq, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Ibrahim al-Jaafari,\r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Iraq, and inviting\r\nhim to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Al-Jaafari (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): I wish\r\nfirst of all to express my sincerest congratulations to\r\nyou, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. I wish you success in performing\r\nthis historic and humanitarian mission in the best\r\ninterests of humanity at large. I wish also to express\r\nmy appreciation to Mr. Jean Ping for his efforts in the\r\nframework of that same mission and goals during the\r\nprevious session of the Assembly.\r\nI come from Iraq, the cradle of civilization, a\r\nmeeting place for a variety of nationalities, religions,\r\ncreeds and political ideas. I come from a rich and\r\n36\r\nA/60/PV.10\r\nfertile land which has throughout its honourable past\r\ngiven the blood of its children, such as Al-Hussein and\r\nsubsequently Al-Sadr, to protect freedom and human\r\nrights.\r\nThis is a unique opportunity for me to make\r\nheard the strong voice of Iraq. The dictatorship that\r\nruled Iraq in the past tried to silence that voice by\r\nsowing death and destruction. Mass graves testify to\r\nthat. Today it is the terrorists who are trying to silence\r\nthat voice. I have come here to deliver to the Assembly\r\na message from my nation, to convey the real picture\r\nof the new Iraq that is emerging, the power of its\r\ndetermination and its profound love and feelings\r\ntowards all other nations.\r\nIraq is now dealing with various new realities.\r\nToday  released from the restraints of a 35-year\r\ndictatorship that imposed on Iraq one political,\r\nsecurity, media and economic option and engendered a\r\nreal Calvary of suffering for its people  Iraq is\r\nwitnessing a different, multifaceted reality. Throughout\r\nthat period of great suffering and while the world stood\r\nidly by, all kinds of crimes and suppression were\r\ncommitted against Iraqis, Iraqi wealth and resources,\r\nthe environment, education, the justice system, culture\r\nand civilization.\r\nWith the recent successful conclusion of our\r\npolitical journey  in record time and in spite of all\r\nthe obstacles and challenges facing it  the Iraqi\r\npeople can justly be proud of their country and identity\r\ntoday. Beginning with the elections on 30 January 2005\r\nand the formation of the Government on 3 May, and\r\ndespite all the challenges faced over the past three\r\nmonths, a draft constitution was written and will be\r\npresented to the Iraqi people for a vote on 15 October.\r\nThat referendum will allow the Iraqi people to express\r\nits will and allow it to constitutionally establish the\r\nrule of law and to create a State in which there is\r\nequality for all Iraqis.\r\nThe constitution will allow law and order, justice\r\nand equality for all Iraqis. Iraqi women will be able to\r\nparticipate actively in political life and will have their\r\nrights restored, including the same right that men have\r\nto pass on their nationality to their children. The\r\nconstitution grants religious freedom, freedom of\r\nspeech, and the right to federal and regional autonomy.\r\nWe are marching resolutely towards political\r\nstability and economic prosperity and regaining\r\nsecurity and stability. While there were 61 terrorist car\r\nbombings in July, that number dropped to nine in\r\nAugust and September. Likewise, the number of\r\nassassinations decreased from 225 to nine in the past\r\ntwo months.\r\nOn 9 September the Iraqi military attacked\r\nterrorist hubs in Talafar to restore security and stability\r\nthere. Our forces adhered to strict rules of conduct,\r\ndoing their best to protect innocent civilians in that\r\ntown. Feeling the force of that operation, the terrorists\r\nfled to commit more crimes  this time in the brave\r\nand heroic city of Khadimiya, where over 160 civilians\r\nwere killed on 14 September.\r\nThe Iraqi forces continue to build, to train and to\r\nbe equipped so that they can take control of all internal\r\nsecurity matters and do not have to depend on the\r\nmultinational forces for their security. However, even\r\nthough some Iraqi cities are already prepared for it, the\r\ntime has not come for the Iraqi forces to be completely\r\nindependent. When we are ready and self-sufficient, we\r\nwill ask the multinational forces to leave our cities.\r\nThe new political life in Iraq is committed to\r\nfreedom of the press, freedom of expression, the\r\nseparation of the legislative, executive, and judiciary\r\npowers and the reconstruction of Iraq, as well as to\r\nrealize the aspirations of the Iraqi people to\r\ndevelopment and progress. Oil production and exports\r\nhave increased along with the number of employment\r\nopportunities, income and trade exchange for Iraqis.\r\nMore is being accomplished in public services and in\r\nhealth care and ambitious projects are under way to\r\nreconstruct our infrastructure, especially in the areas of\r\nhome and road construction. Environmental bureaux\r\nhave now declared the Iraqi provinces to be free from\r\nradioactivity.\r\nI therefore seize this opportunity to urge creditor\r\nnations to help us by cancelling Iraqi debt or loans.\r\nThat debt was accumulated under the corrupt policies\r\nof the previous regime and the Iraqi people have had\r\nno hand in it.\r\nFor Iraq to recover its role in the international\r\ncommunity and to participate effectively in defending\r\ninternational peace and security and to combat the evil\r\nscourge of terrorism, it must be allowed to rebuild and\r\nto implement plans for the development, rehabilitation\r\nand the rebuilding of its infrastructure. I call on the\r\ndonor countries to meet their commitments undertaken\r\nat different international conferences, including in\r\n37\r\nA/60/PV.10\r\nMadrid, Brussels and, most recently, Jordan, to provide\r\nfinancial aid to Iraq.\r\nIraq would like to pay tribute to the constructive\r\nrole of the United Nations in its special efforts to help\r\nthe Iraqi people through the special envoy of the\r\nSecretary-General and the technical election assistance\r\nteam. While we highly appreciate those efforts, we are\r\nalso looking forward to having the United Nations\r\nreturn to Iraq and reopen its offices and agencies in\r\norder to support the reconstruction and development\r\nprocess.\r\nWe also call upon the international community to\r\nevaluate the need to adopt an international programme\r\nto protect and preserve the fine cultural and\r\narchaeological heritage and shrines of Iraq, whose\r\ncities are steeped in history, from Sumer and Babylon\r\nto the present.\r\nToday, Iraq is both a witness to and a victim of\r\nthe cruel, vicious and merciless attacks of international\r\nterrorists, who began their global campaign on\r\n11 September 2001. Alarm bells are ringing in different\r\ncapitals around the world  in Spain, Britain, Turkey,\r\nEgypt, Jordan, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia  as we\r\nhave all witnessed. Iraq was afflicted with that scourge\r\nunder Saddams regime, whose policy was to rule or\r\ndestroy people and property with all types of lethal\r\nweapons. Today the Iraqi people are paying the price of\r\ncountering terrorism, because it is their homes that are\r\non the frontlines of the battle. The world must support\r\nIraqis in fighting the war against terrorism and the\r\nremnants of the Baath regime so that it can move\r\ntowards democracy.\r\nIn order to deal effectively and radically with\r\nterrorism, we must agree on a definition of a number of\r\nelements that are closely related to it, including suicide\r\nand the culture of terrorism, the financing of terrorism,\r\nadvocacy and propaganda that attempt to legitimize\r\nterrorism, perpetrators of terrorist acts and State\r\nterrorism.\r\nNo country is free of terrorism today. Any\r\ncountry can be a victim of terrorism at any time. We all\r\nface this common threat. It brooks no boundaries; the\r\ngeography of terrorism envelopes all humanity. We\r\nmust therefore lend a hand to those who are paying the\r\nprice of terrorism and to its victims. Because of the\r\ninterdependence of nations, what happens in one\r\ncountry cannot fail to have repercussions in others.\r\nThere is also a need to draw a distinction between\r\nnatural disasters and terrorist disasters caused by man.\r\nThe former are often uncontrollable. When they occur\r\nthe entire world mobilizes to provide assistance to the\r\naffected countries, as we witnessed in the case of last\r\nDecembers Asian tsunami and the recent Hurricane\r\nKatrina in Louisiana. But the calamities of terrorism, if\r\nallowed, will be as devastating as natural disasters. We\r\nneed to raise awareness and work together to put an\r\nend to terrorism and to alleviate its destructive impact.\r\nIn this regard, we want to express our warmest\r\nthanks to the people of the United States and to all the\r\nother peoples who have supported us. We must join\r\nefforts to triumph over terrorism, because those who\r\nwin this victory will be able to help others as well. The\r\nIraqi people are in the forefront of the counter-\r\nterrorism struggle. Why do those countries that send\r\nsuicide bombers not send their young people to do\r\nhumanitarian work to contribute to the reconstruction\r\nof Iraq instead of sending them to kill children, to\r\ndestabilize Iraq and its security? Why do they not send\r\nfunds to invest in Iraq, so that the common interests of\r\nour peoples and theirs may be achieved and so that the\r\nstay of the multinational forces may be shortened?\r\nWhy do the news agencies in these countries not relay\r\nthe achievements of the new Iraq and convey the real\r\npicture of the terrorist offensive, which targets popular\r\nmarkets and civilian gatherings, instead of inciting\r\nmedia reports that distort facts and falsify realities?\r\nBut prior to that, we call upon neighbouring countries\r\nto stand by our people and prevent terrorists from\r\nentering Iraq, and to commit themselves to protecting\r\nour common borders for the safety and well-being of\r\nour peoples. We seek to establish the best possible\r\nrelations with all countries, especially neighbouring\r\nones, in order to promote the best interests of all and to\r\nsafeguard national sovereignty and protect it from any\r\nforeign interference.\r\nI would like now to touch on the most important\r\npolitical problems and the need for these problems to\r\nbe resolved peacefully in accordance with international\r\nagreements and treaties. We call for a fair and just\r\nsolution to the political problems in the Middle East,\r\nand in particular the Palestinian question, so that this\r\nregion and all regions of the world will be free from\r\nweapons of mass destruction and nuclear weapons. We\r\nalso must affirm the legitimate right of the Palestinian\r\npeople to establish a sovereign State, ensuring them a\r\nlife of dignity lived in freedom in a climate of peace in\r\ntheir own territory. We must all work to spread the\r\n38\r\nA/60/PV.10\r\nculture of love, peace and coexistence instead of the\r\nculture of hatred, war, vindictiveness and terrorism.\r\nIraq, whose children aspire to political,\r\neconomic, security and developmental reconstruction,\r\nwants fully to assume its responsibility, both regional\r\nand international, to safeguard peace and security\r\nthroughout the region and in the world. Iraq pays\r\ntribute to the United Nations, which has provided the\r\nworld with a broad umbrella to prevent wars and\r\nresolve conflicts. The world today is constantly\r\nchanging, and this requires dynamic changes in the\r\nstructure, decision-making and working methods of the\r\nUnited Nations so it can cope with new world realities\r\nand meet its obligations. Iraq is undergoing difficult\r\ntimes, but its aspirations are just and we therefore hope\r\nthat you will give Iraq your support and that you will\r\ndisplay solidarity with Iraq, especially as we are on the\r\nverge of adopting our permanent constitution, a\r\nconstitution that can ensure independence and a life of\r\ndemocracy, coexistence, love and tolerance for all.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Iraq for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Ibrahim al-Jaafari, Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Iraq, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I now call on Her Excellency\r\nMs. Laila Freivalds, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nSweden.\r\nMs. Freivalds (Sweden): A small boy on the run\r\nremains vividly in my mind today, a boy with eyes that\r\nhave seen more horror than most of us in this Hall have\r\never seen, a boy whom all of us have failed.\r\nThere are thousands of children like him in\r\nDarfur. I met him when I visited areas of fear,\r\nsuffering, hunger and senseless violence. We owe that\r\nboy in Darfur more: better performance; a stronger\r\nconnection between our declarations and our actions.\r\nWe have tools to prevent armed conflicts. We\r\nhave made many commitments to end oppression,\r\nradically reduce poverty and protect our environment.\r\nWe have cures for many of the diseases that continue to\r\nkill. The challenge before us is to use instruments for\r\npeace, development and human rights, and to transform\r\nour commitments into real action.\r\nCooperation across borders is not just a good\r\nidea  it is a must. And for the truly global\r\nchallenges, the United Nations is indispensable. Our\r\njoint commitment to the Charter of the United Nations\r\nis an excellent starting point But as new threats emerge\r\nand the world evolves, the United Nations must also\r\nadapt.\r\nWe need a multilateralism that is effective, with\r\ninstitutions that have teeth and a strong political will to\r\nmake them work. We need a multilateralism that is\r\nbased on common principles, not on the lowest\r\ncommon denominator of the day. We need a rule-based\r\ninternational order, applicable to all.\r\nThis is a crucial year for the United Nations. The\r\nSecretary-General has, with great courage and vision,\r\nled the way. The outcome of the summit sets the\r\ndirection. This session of the General Assembly has\r\nbeen given the responsibility of following up on\r\nimportant decisions. We must together achieve real\r\nresults in a number of areas. Let me highlight some of\r\nthe main challenges.\r\nThe first challenge is to make progress on the\r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). Millions of\r\npeople still suffer from extreme poverty. Important\r\nprogress has been made towards the goal of eradicating\r\npoverty, but we need to do better. All developed\r\ncountries should make timetables for reaching the\r\ntarget of 0.7 per cent of gross national income for\r\ninternational development assistance by the year 2015.\r\nSweden will reach its one per cent target next year.\r\nEqually important is that all countries live up to the\r\ncommitments on aid effectiveness, to our agreements\r\nfrom Monterrey and to our promises to find new ways\r\nof financing development.\r\nBetter progress in preventing maternal and child\r\nmortality is vital for reaching many of the MDGs. We\r\nmust renew our commitment of universal access to\r\nreproductive health care by 2015 and give more focus\r\nto sexual and reproductive health care and rights.\r\nMarket access for goods and services must be\r\nsubstantially improved for poor countries. Trade-\r\ndistorting subsidies need to be phased out. Sweden will\r\ncontinue to work for reduced agricultural subsidies and\r\nto press for speedy implementation of the development\r\ndimension of the Doha work programme.\r\nWhile the developed world can and should play a\r\nbigger part in order to reach the MDGs, the developing\r\ncountries bear the critical responsibility for their own\r\ndevelopment. The importance for the sustainability of\r\ndevelopment efforts of good governance, well-\r\n39\r\nA/60/PV.10\r\nfunctioning democratic institutions and full respect for\r\nhuman rights and the rule of law cannot be\r\nunderestimated.\r\nThe second challenge is to halt climate change.\r\nAwareness of the connection between the way we live\r\nour lives, particularly in the industrialized world, and\r\nits effects on the long-term survival of our planet is\r\ntoday greater than ever. But action is still much too\r\nlimited. It is deeply regrettable that no firm agreement\r\non the way forward was reached at the summit. All\r\nparties to the Kyoto Protocol and to the United Nations\r\nClimate Change Convention must continue to\r\nimplement their commitments. There is also a need to\r\nurgently initiate a process aimed at controlling climate\r\nchange beyond the year 2012.\r\nThe third challenge is to combat terrorism\r\ntogether. Terrorism has taken the lives of thousands of\r\ninnocent people. One of our most urgent priorities must\r\nbe to stop and prevent terrorism. It remains a threat to\r\nall of us. We need to address these threats together,\r\nwith a broad strategy, and with respect for human\r\nrights. The outcome of the summit has given us a\r\nplatform to build on. The United Nations should now\r\ntake the lead in developing a comprehensive counter-\r\nterrorism strategy based on the Secretary-Generals\r\nexcellent work. We must also conclude a\r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism,\r\nincluding a legal definition, during the sixtieth session\r\nof the General Assembly.\r\nThe fourth challenge is to better promote human\r\nrights. Human rights are violated throughout the world,\r\ncreating enormous suffering and affecting both security\r\nand development. Human rights must be mainstreamed\r\nin all United Nations work as a core task of the\r\nOrganization. Sweden welcomes the decision to create\r\na Human Rights Council. That Council will need a\r\nstrong mandate to address any human rights situation,\r\nrespond to urgent human rights violations and monitor\r\ncompliance by all States with their human rights\r\nobligations. We must all join in efforts to establish an\r\neffective and legitimate Human Rights Council during\r\nthe sixtieth session.\r\nThe summit made a strong commitment to our\r\ncommon responsibility to protect. We must now act\r\naccordingly. The world has a responsibility to react in\r\norder to prevent genocide, ethnic cleansing and crimes\r\nagainst humanity. The Security Council must be ready\r\nto take responsibility if and when a State cannot give\r\nits citizens the necessary protection. However, it is not\r\njust a question of acknowledging the obligation to act;\r\nit is also a question of being prepared to actually do so.\r\nThe fifth challenge is to implement commitments\r\non disarmament and non-proliferation. Weapons of\r\nmass destruction could kill all of us here, all at once.\r\nThey could wipe out villages, cities and entire\r\npopulations in seconds. Yet we still do not take the\r\nthreat seriously enough. It should have been made clear\r\nat the summit that disarmament commitments are to be\r\nimplemented and that non-proliferation undertakings\r\nare to be complied with. The countries in possession of\r\nnuclear weapons have a special responsibility to\r\ndisarm. At the summit, decisions should have been\r\ntaken to strengthen verification. There should have\r\nbeen commitments to make the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and other\r\narms conventions universal. Negotiation processes\r\nshould have been given a boost by the summit. None of\r\nthat actually happened.\r\nSweden looks forward to the recommendations of\r\nthe Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission, chaired\r\nby Mr. Hans Blix. The failure to address the threat\r\nposed by weapons of mass destruction leaves us with\r\nan immensely important task ahead.\r\nThe sixth challenge is to put the Peacebuilding\r\nCommission in place promptly. Far too many people in\r\nwar-torn countries have seen a fragile peace relapse\r\ninto new conflict. With the establishment of the\r\nPeacebuilding Commission, the United Nations is\r\nbetter equipped to build peace in war-torn societies and\r\nto prevent countries from relapsing into war. In order\r\nto be successful, the Commission needs to draw on\r\nlessons from international peace efforts. Regional\r\norganizations will have important contributions to\r\nmake. The Peacebuilding Commission needs a well-\r\nbalanced composition, including major donor\r\ncountries. Let us establish this Commission before the\r\nend of the year. Sweden is ready to do its part,\r\nincluding through the swift provision of financial\r\ncontributions.\r\nThe seventh challenge is to reform the Security\r\nCouncil and the Secretariat. United Nations reform will\r\nnot be complete without Security Council reform. If\r\nthe decisions of the Council are to be accepted as\r\nlegitimate and effectively implemented, the Council\r\nneeds to better represent the world of today. In\r\naddition, the Councils effectiveness must be\r\n40\r\nA/60/PV.10\r\nsafeguarded. There should be no extension of the right\r\nof veto, and the use of the veto should be limited. The\r\nreform of the United Nations also requires the reform\r\nof the Secretariat. The summit took several important\r\ndecisions on management reform. Those include a\r\nreview of internal rules, regulations and mandates and\r\nthe strengthening of the oversight system. But greater\r\nflexibility must be given to the Secretary-General in\r\nmanaging staff and resources. That would not only\r\nmake the Secretariat more efficient, but it would also\r\nenable Member States to focus more on strategic issues\r\nand make the Organization more dynamic.\r\nThe summit has provided essential momentum for\r\nmore effective multilateralism. The legacy of our\r\nefforts will continue to be determined during the\r\nsixtieth session of the General Assembly. During the\r\nmonths ahead the task can be completed  the task to\r\ncreate a United Nations capable of facing the\r\nchallenges of our time.\r\nIn conclusion, let me return to the subject with\r\nwhich I began: Darfur. The United Nations must, above\r\nall, serve the interests of the boy that I met there and of\r\nall the other children, as well as the husbands, the\r\nwives, the grandparents  men and women of this\r\nworld who lack security, hope and human dignity. That\r\nis our mission.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Nobutaka Machimura, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Japan.\r\nMr. Machimura (Japan): I should like, first and\r\nforemost, to convey, once again, my sincere sympathy\r\nin connection with the victims of the devastation\r\ncaused by Hurricane Katrina.\r\nAllow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your\r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at\r\nits sixtieth session. I would also like to pay high tribute\r\nto Mr. Jean Ping, your predecessor, for his\r\ndistinguished leadership.\r\nThe 60-year history of the United Nations has\r\nbeen a pathway towards a peaceful, prosperous and just\r\nworld. The path followed by Japan during that time has\r\nbeen, indeed, that of a nation striving for an honoured\r\nplace among peace-loving nations. Building upon the\r\ndetermination that it will never again follow the path to\r\nwar, Japan has pursued, and will continue to pursue,\r\ninternational peace and stability in partnership with the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nJapan needs an effective and efficient United\r\nNations and strongly endorses the outcome document\r\nof the summit. To that end, our leaders commitments,\r\nas expressed in the document, must be translated into\r\naction with the utmost urgency. Japan will spare no\r\neffort in that endeavour.\r\nThe new United Nations must be equipped with a\r\nbetter peacebuilding capacity. We expect the proposed\r\nPeacebuilding Commission to help to achieve that\r\nobjective. To that end, Japan will continue to play a\r\nconstructive role, making full use of its experience and\r\nresources.\r\nIn the Gaza Strip, the reconstruction effort after\r\nthe Israeli withdrawal has been crucial. Japan has\r\nimplemented more than $110 million worth of\r\nassistance since the beginning of this year, in the\r\nfervent hope that we will now see the resumption of\r\nthe road map.\r\nAs the largest donor to the Trust Fund for Iraqi\r\nreconstruction, Japan has devoted its energies to\r\nbringing together the international community in the\r\nreconstruction effort. Humanitarian and reconstruction\r\nassistance by Japans Self-Defence Forces and official\r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) are contributing in\r\ntandem to progress towards a peaceful and prosperous\r\nIraq. Japan has pledged ODA amounting to $5 billion,\r\nof which $1.5 billion in grant assistance has already\r\nbeen implemented.\r\nJapan has taken the lead in assisting the Afghan\r\nefforts for disarmament, demobilization and\r\nreintegration (DDR), in conjunction with the United\r\nNations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA).\r\nAs a result, about 63,000 ex-combatants are to\r\ncomplete the reintegration programme by the end of\r\nnext June. Japanese Self-Defence Forces vessels are\r\nengaged in activities in the Indian Ocean in support of\r\nthe countries fighting against terrorism. Japan has\r\nannounced that its contribution will total $1 billion by\r\nthe end of March 2006, including assistance in the field\r\nof security.\r\nIt is essential to ensure a sense of justice in a\r\nsociety struggling to recover from its suffering in the\r\naftermath of conflict. In the area of establishing the\r\nrule of law, Japan, in cooperation with the Government\r\nof Cambodia, has taken the lead in setting up a tribunal\r\nto try members of the Khmer Rouge, with a\r\ncontribution of over $20 million.\r\n41\r\nA/60/PV.10\r\nSixty summers have passed since Hiroshima and\r\nNagasaki suffered the indescribable horrors of nuclear\r\ndevastation. Japan again calls upon all Member States\r\nto renew their determination to bring about a peaceful\r\nworld free of nuclear weapons.\r\nTo that end, Japan will submit a draft resolution\r\nto the General Assembly presenting a concrete agenda\r\nto strengthen the disarmament and non-proliferation\r\nregime, including a call for the early entry into force of\r\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT).\r\nIn that regard, it is extremely regrettable that the 2005\r\nReview Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)\r\nconcluded without adopting a consensus document on\r\nsubstantive issues, and that the outcome document\r\nfound no consensus on disarmament and non-\r\nproliferation.\r\nThe Democratic Peoples Republic of Koreas\r\nnuclear programmes pose a serious challenge to the\r\ninternational non-proliferation regime, centring on the\r\nNPT, and constitute a direct threat to peace and\r\nstability in North-East Asia. Japan is committed to a\r\npeaceful resolution of the nuclear issue through the six-\r\nparty talks and strongly hopes that the Democratic\r\nPeoples Republic of Korea will accept the prompt and\r\nverifiable dismantlement of all its nuclear weapons and\r\nnuclear programmes at the current round of talks in\r\nBeijing. Japan will continue to make every effort to\r\nensure that the nuclear issue, along with the missile\r\nand abduction issues, is comprehensively resolved in\r\naccordance with the Pyongyang Declaration.\r\nJapan believes that the Iranian nuclear issue\r\nshould be resolved through negotiations by diplomatic\r\nmeans. To that end, Japan strongly urges Iran to\r\nimplement, in a spirit of sincerity, all the requirements\r\nset out in the relevant resolutions of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors,\r\nincluding the full suspension of uranium conversion\r\nactivities, and to return to the negotiating table with the\r\nthree European Union States.\r\nIn recent years, we have witnessed countless\r\ntragedies caused by terrorist acts. Japan, for its part,\r\nhas continued to provide assistance to countries in need\r\nof capacity-building in the area of counter-terrorism.\r\nTo consolidate the international legal framework, Japan\r\ncalls on Member States to join international counter-\r\nterrorism conventions and protocols, including the\r\nnewly adopted International Convention for the\r\nSuppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism.\r\nDevelopment provides a foundation for peace and\r\nstability. The new United Nations must serve as an\r\neffective Organization for the promotion of\r\ndevelopment. Having recovered from the devastation\r\nof the Second World War with global assistance, Japan\r\nis in a better position than any other country to\r\ndemonstrate the significance of ownership and\r\npartnership, poverty reduction through economic\r\ngrowth, and human security in promoting development.\r\nThe concept of human security  focusing on the\r\nprotection and empowerment of individuals  offers a\r\nmeaningful approach in a world striving for freedom\r\nand dignity. The concept also provides an important\r\nviewpoint with respect to the protection of human\r\nrights. I look forward to forthcoming discussions on\r\nthis concept in the General Assembly, to which leaders\r\ncommitted themselves in the outcome document.\r\nBased on its experiences as a recipient, and also a\r\ndonor for more than a half century, Japan has been\r\nkeen to make an impact on world development and\r\nthus has contributed one-fifth of world ODA over the\r\npast 10 years. Japan is resolved to continue its support\r\nfor achieving the Millennium Development Goals\r\n(MDGs). To that end, Japan intends to increase its\r\nODA volume by $10 billion over the next five years.\r\nFor the achievement of the MDGs, addressing the\r\nissues facing Africa is critically important. As Prime\r\nMinister Koizumi announced during the Asia-Africa\r\nsummit, Japan will double its ODA to Africa in the\r\nnext three years and host the fourth Tokyo\r\nInternational Conference on African Development\r\n(TICAD) meeting in 2008. In an effort to support\r\nAfricans own efforts to bring about peace and\r\nstability, Japan has devoted its energies to the\r\nconsolidation of peace in such countries as the Sudan,\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone,\r\nBurundi and Liberia.\r\nWith respect to the Sudan, Japan has decided to\r\ndisburse more than half of its pledged assistance of\r\n$100 million, with a contribution of personnel through\r\nthe United Nations Mission in the Sudan (UNMIS).\r\nFurthermore, to address the humanitarian crisis in\r\nAfrica and in other regions caused by infectious\r\ndiseases, Japan has announced $500 million in\r\nfinancial assistance in the coming years for the Global\r\nFund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Japan\r\n42\r\nA/60/PV.10\r\nwill contribute $5 billion over the next five years to the\r\nHealth and Development Initiative. Japan has also\r\ntaken steps to address the forgotten crises in Africa\r\nand will continue to focus on those issues.\r\nAt no other time in its history has an effective,\r\nefficient and credible United Nations been more\r\nneeded than today. The credibility of the United\r\nNations is at stake. The basic structure of the Security\r\nCouncil continues to reflect the world of 1945. Reform\r\nof the Security Council therefore remains key to\r\nachieving the overall renewal of the United Nations.\r\nThe fact that an overwhelming majority of Member\r\nStates  166 countries in all  called for Security\r\nCouncil reform during the previous session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly is a testament to the urgent need for\r\nreform.\r\nFor the first time in the 60-year history of the\r\nUnited Nations, during the last General Assembly\r\nsession we witnessed the submission of draft\r\nresolutions calling for fundamental change in the\r\ncomposition of the Security Council. Japan is proud to\r\nhave taken the lead in promoting Security Council\r\nreform. It is encouraging, as well, that a large number\r\nof leaders at the recent summit expressed their support\r\nfor reform.\r\nI believe that Japans path of striving for\r\ninternational peace speaks for itself, and should serve\r\nas the basis for a larger role for Japan as a permanent\r\nmember of a reformed Security Council. I can assure\r\nyou, Mr. President, that Japan will continue to make its\r\nutmost effort to realize the reform under your\r\nleadership. And I call on Member States to reach an\r\nearly decision at this session of the General Assembly.\r\nThe new United Nations requires an efficient and\r\neffective Secretariat, with a strong sense of integrity.\r\nJapan is deeply concerned about recent developments,\r\nincluding the failure over the oil-for-food programme.\r\nThe management and administration of the United\r\nNations system must be transparent and accountable to\r\nMember States and their citizens. In this regard, Japan\r\nwill promote and conduct more comprehensive\r\nperformance evaluation of United Nations activities.\r\nWith respect to the anachronistic enemy State\r\nclauses, I am pleased to note that the leaders resolved\r\nin the outcome document (resolution 60/1) to delete\r\nthese obsolete clauses from the Charter at the earliest\r\nopportunity.\r\nA comprehensive review is also needed in order\r\nto reach agreement on a scale of assessment structure\r\nthat is more equitable and fair. Japan will actively\r\nparticipate in the negotiations to be concluded by the\r\nend of next year. In the upcoming negotiation process,\r\nJapan will make its utmost effort to ensure that the\r\nstatus and responsibilities of a Member State are duly\r\ntaken into account in the scale of assessments.\r\nWe have embarked on a mission to renew the\r\nUnited Nations. A great deal of work lies ahead. I call\r\nupon all representatives in this Hall to dedicate\r\nthemselves to accomplishing this unfinished mission\r\nby the close of this commemorative session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nThe meeting rose at 7.50 p.m.\r\n"
