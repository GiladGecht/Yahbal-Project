(Sweden) \r\n \r\n \r\n The meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Alfredo Palacio, President of the \r\nRepublic of Ecuador \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Ecuador. \r\nMr. Alfredo Palacio, President of the Republic of \r\nEcuador, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Alfredo Palacio, President \r\nof the Republic of Ecuador, and to invite him to \r\naddress the General Assembly. \r\n President Palacio (spoke in Spanish): The people \r\nof Ecuador wish to express their deepest condolences \r\nand fraternal solidarity to the South-East Asian nations \r\naffected by the tsunami, as well as to all our brothers \r\nand sisters living in the southern United States who \r\nwere so severely affected by Hurricane Katrina. \r\n Faced with the danger of natural disasters, \r\nEcuador is committed to the implementation of the \r\nHyogo Framework for Action and to support the \r\nInternational El Niño Research Centre, based in \r\nGuayaquil. \r\n Today, the nations of the globe have come \r\ntogether to celebrate 60 years of human hopes, 60 years \r\nafter the proclamation of the founding Charter of the \r\nOrganization that represents every man, every woman, \r\nand every child. Six decades have passed since we \r\ninaugurated this institution and its essential objectives \r\nof human coexistence, peace and the international rule \r\nof law. After six decades we can rejoice with old \r\nNeruda, who lives on in our hearts, along with \r\nStravinsky, Garcia Marquez and Mother Teresa. Let us \r\ncelebrate, but let us also take stock of the dream yet to \r\nbe fulfilled. Sleeplessly, we face threats and challenges \r\nthat affect the survival of our species. When the second \r\nmillennium ended — quite unlike the first — our world \r\nwas not threatened by the terror-filled visions of the \r\napocalypse and the seven trumpets that would \r\ntransform a third of the world into blood, darkness, \r\nsmoke and locusts. However, our new millennium \r\nfaces the reality of increasing poverty in two thirds of \r\nthe planet. Water is becoming scarce, there are holes in \r\nthe ozone layer and, along with biodiversity, the \r\nAmazon is being destroyed. Entire nations are being \r\ndisinherited and condemned to roam the earth, mortal \r\nillnesses hover over humanity and terrorism lurks in \r\nevery corner. \r\n I have come from the middle of the world to \r\nspeak of faith in the renewal of the dream. Ecuador is a \r\nsmall nation in South America sharing an identity with \r\nalmost 400 million human beings living in an area of \r\n8 million square kilometres. We have more than one \r\nfourth of the fresh water of the world and immense \r\nenergy, mineral and food resources; we boast the \r\ngreatest tropical rain forest in the world and colossal \r\nmountains, deserts and prairies. Yet, our region remains \r\na realm of social injustice. \r\nA/60/PV.11  \r\n \r\n2 05-51226 \r\n \r\n The world order that governs us is not the one we \r\nwant. It is unjust, inefficient and inhuman. We must \r\ntherefore set in motion factors that were unimaginable \r\nin the middle of the twentieth century. The economy, \r\ninternational law and biology constitute a fundamental \r\ntriangle from which the future of the human being can \r\nbe projected. I set out for the Assembly the idea of \r\nbuilding a new world order based on this trilogy. \r\n First, with regard to international law, Ecuador \r\nreaffirms its commitment to the San Francisco Charter \r\nand the principles of non-intervention and the self-\r\ndetermination of peoples, the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes, and the rejection of all forms of colonialism, \r\ndiscrimination or segregation. In accordance with these \r\nprinciples my country believes in the need to \r\nstrengthen the Organization, transform it and \r\ndemocratize it. The United Nations must develop new \r\nmechanisms to protect the survival of our species and \r\nof all forms of life. \r\n Secondly, the economy must eliminate \r\nmarginalization and redress the unequal nature of \r\nopportunities, among both nations and individuals. \r\nThis is the conflict. In 1945, the vital need to establish \r\npolicies to promote a just and progressive distribution \r\nof surpluses was proclaimed. Nevertheless, 60 years \r\nlater we see ever more regressive patterns of \r\ndistribution and growing gaps at all levels, basically \r\nproduced by the tragedy inherent in the accumulation \r\nof foreign debt, which represents such a heavy burden \r\nfor developing nations. The burden of the debt has \r\npauperized our peoples. It has put a brake on \r\nproductive development and cancelled out the \r\naspiration of all to have access to food, health, shelter, \r\nsafety and education. The ethical mandate of our time \r\ndemands a change in the collective conscience of social \r\nwelfare. Heavily indebted middle-income countries \r\nmust organize their efforts to arrive at joint agreements \r\nwith the world’s creditors. \r\n Thirdly, the incorporation of biology into the new \r\ninternational order obliges the United Nations to \r\ntransfer its focus from man to biology. The presence of \r\nthis new factor — biology — brings with it the need to \r\nraise the level of ethics and international law to the \r\nhighest degree of respect for biodiversity and the \r\npreservation of all forms of life. Ecuador attaches \r\nparticular importance to this topic and is therefore \r\nconcerned at the controversial spraying of glyphosate \r\nas a herbicide to eliminate illegal crops along border \r\nareas between Colombia and Ecuador. Studies on this \r\nsubstance suffer from technical and methodological \r\nshortcomings. Ecuador therefore calls upon the United \r\nNations system to promote a comprehensive, reliable \r\nand credible study on the actual impact of this \r\nspraying. Ecuador considers that it is essential to apply \r\nthe precautionary principle that has been recognized in \r\nmany international agreements and other instruments, \r\nin particular the Rio Declaration on Environment and \r\nDevelopment. Consequently, Ecuador has asked its \r\nneighbouring Government of Colombia to suspend \r\naerial-spraying activities in a 10-kilometre strip north \r\nof our border. \r\n As I said in my statement during the High-level \r\nPlenary Meeting (see A/60/PV.5), in my country’s \r\nopinion the Millennium Development Goals constitute \r\na well-honed and effective tool for this century to carve \r\nout a path towards a more just humankind. I am firmly \r\nconvinced that ethical regulations to preserve the \r\nbiological heritage of the planet constitute the \r\nparamount goal for this third millennium. With \r\nconviction and resolve, my country has adopted a date \r\nfor its future: 2015. Copies of the reports on my \r\nGovernment endeavours to attain the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals are available in the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n I should now like to talk about migrants. \r\nGlobalization is creating urgent demands for the new \r\ncentury. One of these arises from the pain that is giving \r\nrise to a new exodus. Today the United Nations must \r\ntake over the role of a new Moses. It must lead the \r\npeople to their homeland and provide the bread to calm \r\nthe hunger of the wretched of the world. More than 175 \r\nmillion human beings have been forced to leave their \r\nhomeland in search of better days. Today migrants are \r\ntreated worse than capital or commercial goods: we are \r\nalways looking to provide freedom of transit for these. \r\nThe mere existence of this fact forces us to recognize \r\nthat for the hungry of the third world there is no liberty \r\nand even less the equality and fraternity symbolized \r\ntwo centuries ago by the French revolution. The link \r\nbetween the migrant issue and development is \r\nundeniable and must be handled in a transparent \r\nmanner based on a vision of shared responsibility on \r\nthe part of all nations involved. \r\n On migration routes we must overcome the police \r\nstigmatization of the undocumented. Regularization \r\nrequires that the rights of migrants be viewed as a \r\nfundamental human right and must be reflected in \r\nevery State’s population policy. The Government of \r\n A/60/PV.11\r\n \r\n05-51226 3 \r\n \r\nEcuador calls upon this forum to address the problem \r\nof migrants in terms of equality for all nationals. We \r\npropose that this problem be addressed at the high-\r\nlevel dialogue on international migration and \r\ndevelopment, to be held in 2006. \r\n We in the Government of Ecuador, aware of the \r\nneed for migration and its consequences to be treated \r\nin an integral and responsible manner, have approved a \r\nlaw revising our criminal code to define crimes of the \r\nsexual exploitation of minors and the trafficking of \r\npersons. In addition, we have placed before our \r\nNational Congress a new proposal to punish all forms \r\nof trafficking in human beings. \r\n I should like to talk about indigenous peoples and \r\npeoples of African descent. The International Decades \r\nof the World’s Indigenous People, proclaimed by the \r\nGeneral Assembly, have been a valuable opportunity to \r\nincrease awareness of the situation of our brothers and \r\nto promote respect for their identity and the chance to \r\nfind viable solutions to their problems. The biology of \r\nthe new world order requires recognition of their rights \r\nas protagonists of history and as leading actors in \r\nsociety. In the Ecuador of the last decade, indigenous \r\npeoples have been significant components of our social \r\nand political life. That is recognized in our \r\nConstitution and in International Labour Organization \r\n(ILO) Agreement 169.  \r\n In recent years, Ecuador has witnessed a serious \r\ndeterioration in its democratic institutions. Faced with \r\nthat situation, my Government has pledged to restore \r\nthe rule of law by means of profound political reform \r\nlegitimized through a referendum of the Ecuadorian \r\npeople. We are determined to firmly fight the \r\ncorruption that erodes democratic structures. Only \r\nthree days ago, on 15 September, my Government \r\ndeposited its instrument of ratification as the thirtieth \r\nState party to the United Nations Convention against \r\nCorruption, which made it possible for the Convention \r\nto enter into force. \r\n The voice of my people, the people of Ecuador, \r\nechoes the deep-throated clamour of Latin America. \r\nWe want to be part of a greater nation, South America, \r\na human assembly that can make its voice heard and \r\nfollow the path to genuine, just development \r\naccompanied by greater solidarity on behalf of the \r\nprinciples that we have recalled here. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Ecuador for the statement he has just made. \r\nMr. Alfredo Palacio, President of the Republic of \r\nEcuador, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by The Honourable Ludwig Scotty, M. P., \r\nPresident of the Republic of Nauru \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Nauru. \r\nThe Honourable Ludwig Scotty, M. P., President \r\nof the Republic of Nauru, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency The Honourable Ludwig \r\nScotty, M. P., President of the Republic of Nauru, and \r\nto invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Scotty: The outcome document \r\nadopted at the High-level Plenary Meeting (resolution \r\n60/1) serves as a map by which we navigate in seeking \r\nto improve the lives of the many peoples of the world; \r\nit may be imperfect, but it is our task as leaders to \r\nprovide a vision of a better world and to lead our \r\npeoples towards the achievement of that vision. The \r\noutcome document spells out this vision, and we \r\nshould use it much as one uses a map when navigating \r\nthe destiny of our respective nations.  \r\n In this respect, Nauru looks to the United Nations \r\nas the global leader in reaching this vision of a better \r\nworld: a world in which human rights are collectively \r\nrecognized and defended, terrorism in any form is \r\neliminated, peace and security is promoted and \r\nmaintained, and poverty is eradicated. We therefore \r\napplaud the effort to strengthen the work of the United \r\nNations through management reform. This should \r\nimprove the delivery of the global services that this \r\nOrganization is expected to provide. \r\n Equally important is the need to reform the \r\nSecurity Council, to recognize that international \r\ndevelopments since the establishment of that body \r\nmany decades ago now demand a more democratic \r\nrepresentation of the global family in an expanded \r\nSecurity Council. The earlier these reforms are \r\nimplemented, the earlier the work of the United \r\nA/60/PV.11  \r\n \r\n4 05-51226 \r\n \r\nNations can be further improved, with commensurate \r\nbenefit to the people whose interests we all serve. \r\n Nauru is in the unenviable position of having lost \r\nits earlier status as a donor country, with much of its \r\nwealth lost through mismanagement and, in particular, \r\ncorrupt leadership. We therefore speak with some \r\nexperience when we note with encouragement the \r\ndecision by the United Nations to implement \r\nmanagement and structural reforms to improve, \r\namongst other things, transparency and accountability \r\nfor the greater good of Member countries and the \r\npeoples we represent.  \r\n Nauru itself is undertaking significant economic \r\nand political reforms as it recommences the nation-\r\nbuilding process. These include the design of a national \r\ndevelopment strategy, the public consultative phase of \r\nwhich has just been concluded; it will be presented to \r\nthe donor community in November this year. We hope \r\nthat the international community can participate, not by \r\ndriving the development agenda for the people of \r\nNauru, but by accepting the vision of our people as that \r\nto be implemented by Nauru with the support of its \r\ndevelopment partners. The development agenda for \r\ndeveloping countries, particularly those with fragile \r\nand vulnerable economies, must be designed by those \r\non whose lives that agenda will have an impact and not \r\nby external parties that have a different agenda. \r\n We believe that the thorough consultative process \r\nwithin which the national development strategy is \r\nbeing designed is in itself an exercise in democracy. \r\nThe views expressed by government and non-\r\ngovernment agencies and by community, faith and \r\nother leaders, is testament to the strength of democracy \r\nin Nauru. To turn a blind eye to this process by driving \r\na development agenda not envisioned by the people is \r\nnot only dangerous to the development needs of the \r\npeople it should serve, but a threat to democracy itself. \r\nWe hope that the United Nations itself will have a \r\nleading role in assisting the rebuilding of Nauru and in \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. \r\nWe reiterate our call for a United Nations presence in \r\nNauru for this purpose. \r\n Nauru also calls upon the developed world to \r\nmatch its rhetoric with action when it comes to meeting \r\nthe development needs of the developing world, \r\nthrough development financing and/or debt relief. It is \r\nsimply not good enough to be targeting the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals by \r\n2015 without making available the resources to fund \r\nthat effort. The developed world has an obligation to \r\nshare its resources with the developing world by \r\nensuring it meets its own target of official development \r\nassistance expenditure of 0.7 per cent of gross \r\ndomestic product, and to achieve it promptly, if the \r\ndeveloping world is to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals within 10 years. \r\n The decision not to consider the question of the \r\npeople of Taiwan is a gross dereliction of duty by this \r\nAssembly. There are 23 million people on Taiwan who \r\nare being denied the right to be recognized and \r\nprotected by this Organization. The United Nations has \r\na role in assisting and facilitating constructive dialogue \r\nto ensure a future of peace for the people of Taiwan \r\nand the rest of that region. Peace and security in the \r\nTaiwan Strait is peace and security in the Asia-Pacific \r\nregion. I am very hopeful that Member States will \r\nrecognize and accept the appeal by the good people of \r\nTaiwan at the sixtieth session of the General Assembly.  \r\n God bless the Republic of Nauru and God bless \r\nthe United Nations and the peoples of the world. We \r\nshall proceed with God’s will first. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Nauru for the statement he has just made. \r\nThe Honourable Ludwig Scotty, M. P., President \r\nof the Republic of Nauru, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Robert Gabriel Mugabe, President of \r\nthe Republic of Zimbabwe \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe. \r\nMr. Robert Gabriel Mugabe, President of the \r\nRepublic of Zimbabwe, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Robert Gabriel Mugabe, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Zimbabwe, and to invite \r\nhim to address the General Assembly. \r\n President Mugabe: Allow me to extend to you, \r\nSir, our sincere congratulations on your assumption of \r\nthe presidency of the sixtieth session of the General \r\nAssembly and to express our confidence in your ability \r\n A/60/PV.11\r\n \r\n05-51226 5 \r\n \r\nto guide our work throughout the session. In the same \r\nbreath, let me also express our appreciation to your \r\npredecessor, Mr. Jean Ping, for managing successfully \r\nthe very difficult business of the fifty-ninth session. \r\n Although we began our last session with a \r\nweighty agenda, we were able to reach general \r\nagreement on a number of important issues in the area \r\nof development. We are yet to agree on other pressing \r\nissues, such as the reform of the Security Council and \r\nthe composition of a new Human Rights Council. \r\n For many years we have spoken in favour of an \r\napproach to international peace and security that is \r\nfirmly rooted in the principle of multilateralism and the \r\nprovisions of the Charter of the United Nations. We \r\nmaintain that any diversion from this approach is \r\nunacceptable, undesirable and devoid of legal \r\njustification. We are pleased to note that the majority \r\nof views expressed during the last session reinforced \r\nthat principle.  \r\n Our expectation is that the Security Council in its \r\ncurrent form, or in whatever character and composition \r\nit will eventually take, will, like all other bodies of the \r\nUnited Nations, limit itself to what is contained in its \r\nmandate. We do not subscribe to the suggestion that all \r\nproblems — social, cultural, economic and health, \r\namong others — are necessarily threats to international \r\npeace and security and should therefore be referred to \r\nthe Security Council.  \r\n Recently we witnessed the United Kingdom \r\nabusing its privilege and acting dishonestly as a \r\nmember of the Council by seeking to score cheap \r\npolitical points in its bilateral dispute with us. We were \r\ndragged on to the Council’s agenda over an issue that \r\nhas no relevance to the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security. Let me pay tribute to those \r\nmembers of the Security Council who saw through this \r\ncheap politicking and manipulation of procedures — \r\nwhich the same country, by the way, has vowed to \r\nresume as soon as the Council is appropriately chaired. \r\nIt is my hope that other Member countries will join us \r\nin rejecting this neocolonialist attempt and blatant \r\ninterference in the internal affairs of Zimbabwe. But \r\nthen, is it not obvious, that Britain under the regime of \r\nTony Blair has ceased to respect the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations? Witness its being a principal member \r\nof the illegal anti-Iraq coalition that went on a \r\ndevastating campaign in that country in complete \r\ndefiance of the United Nations Charter. Any State or \r\ngroup of States that commits such an act of aggression \r\non another, justifying it on blatant falsehoods, surely \r\nbecomes guilty of State terrorism.  \r\n Zimbabwe is a country at peace with itself and \r\nwith its neighbours and offers absolutely no threat to \r\ninternational peace and security. Is it not therefore \r\nsurprising that Britain and its Anglo-Saxon allies have \r\nembarked on a vicious campaign of first peddling \r\nblatant lies intended to tarnish it and then appealing to \r\nEurope and America for sanctions against it?  \r\n Those imperialist countries have unashamedly \r\nabused the power of the media by hypocritically \r\nportraying themselves as philanthropists and \r\ninternational saviours of victims of various calamities. \r\nYet they have remained silent about the shocking \r\ncircumstances of obvious State neglect surrounding the \r\ntragic Gulf coast disaster, where a whole community of \r\nmainly non-whites was deliberately abandoned to the \r\nravages of Hurricane Katrina as sacrificial lambs, and \r\nsacrificed to which god one cannot tell. Most of the \r\nvictims were blacks. And we are bound to ask what \r\ntransgressions we, the blacks of this world, have \r\ncommitted? Was it not enough punishment and \r\nsuffering in history that we were uprooted and made \r\nhelpless slaves, not only in new colonial outposts but \r\nalso domestically at home, through a vicious system of \r\ncolonialism that made us landless, propertyless and \r\nmere slaves and serfs in our own lands?  \r\n Must we again in this day of humanitarian ethics, \r\nthis day of the sacred principles of the equality of \r\nmankind and the rights of men and women, this day \r\nthat has seen us assemble here to save, enhance and \r\nprolong life, become victims of callous racial neglect? \r\nWe of Africa protest that in this day and age we should \r\ncontinue to be treated as lesser human beings than \r\nother races.  \r\n We reiterate our deep sympathies and \r\ncondolences over the massive loss of life that occurred \r\nin the Hurricane Katrina disaster. If, as we are told, \r\nmany who survived the wrath of Hurricane Katrina are \r\nstill dispersed, the question we ask ourselves is where \r\nthey are and for how long will they remain where they \r\nare. We ask further whether they will ever get back, \r\ntruly rehabilitated, to their original homes — properly \r\nrehabilitated also, homes which at present are mere \r\nwreckages. Where, I ask, are the Zimbabwe-famous \r\nUnited Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-\r\nHABITAT) and the Commission on Human Rights? \r\nA/60/PV.11  \r\n \r\n6 05-51226 \r\n \r\nWhy should they maintain an ominous silence? For \r\nhere is real homeless work for HABITAT and the \r\nCommission on Human Rights. This indeed is where \r\nthey rightly belong and not anywhere in Zimbabwe. We \r\ndo not need them there. \r\n With reference to the vexatious issue of the \r\nreform of the Security Council, we have made our \r\nviews known through the African Union. We seek fair \r\nand equal treatment as partners in this community of \r\nnations and pledge our commitment to work with \r\nothers in pursuit of that objective. \r\n The promotion of human rights is one of the \r\nmajor aims of the United Nations as enshrined in its \r\nCharter. As such, the subject rightly occupies space on \r\nthe agenda of each session of the General Assembly, \r\nincluding this one. We believe that the United Nations \r\nshould make every effort to promote and protect the \r\nfull enjoyment of human rights, including the right to \r\ndevelopment. Regrettably, we have seen over the years \r\na deliberate tendency to create a distorted hierarchy of \r\nrights, with the sole mischievous purpose of \r\noverplaying civil and political rights while \r\ndownplaying economic, social and cultural rights. That \r\nexplains why the whole human rights agenda, instead \r\nof being a cooperative exercise, has degenerated into a \r\nWestern-managed kangaroo court, always looking out \r\nfor “criminals”, as they call them, among developing \r\ncountries. Hence, we continue to argue that the human \r\nrights discourse needs to be rid of selectivity and \r\ndouble standards and to be approached without hidden \r\npolitical agendas. \r\n The African Union has indicated its support for \r\nthe establishment of a Human Rights Council that will \r\nbe subordinated to the General Assembly. Zimbabwe \r\nsubscribes fully to that position. We believe, however, \r\nthat a correctly sized and properly structured Council, \r\nwith equitable geographical representation, will be a \r\nmajor step in addressing the deficiencies of the current \r\nCommission on Human Rights. \r\n At the beginning of the last session (see \r\nA/59/PV.5) I informed the Assembly that despite the \r\nrecurrent droughts that we had experienced, Zimbabwe \r\nhad the capacity to cope with its situation of hunger \r\nand was thus not appealing for humanitarian \r\nintervention. In spite of that message, our detractors \r\nand ill-wishers have been projecting a false picture of \r\nmass starvation. There has been none of that. Recently, \r\nparticularly in the aftermath of our urban clean-up \r\noperation, popularly known at home as Operation \r\nMurambatsvina, or Operation Restore Order, the \r\nfamiliar noises re-echoed from the same malicious \r\nprophets of doom claiming that there was a \r\nhumanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe. Those unfounded \r\nalarms are aimed at deliberately tarnishing the image \r\nof Zimbabwe and projecting it as a failed State. We \r\nfind it strange and obviously anomalous that the \r\nGovernment of Zimbabwe should be maligned and \r\ncondemned for restoring order and the rule of law in its \r\nmunicipal areas. Our detractors fail to acknowledge \r\nthat Operation Restore Order soon gave way to a well-\r\nplanned, vast reconstruction programme through which \r\nproperly planned accommodation, factory shells and \r\nvending stalls are being constructed in many areas of \r\nthe country for our people. We have rejected the \r\nscandalous demand, as expressed in Special Envoy \r\nAnna Tibaijuka’s report, that we lower our urban \r\nhousing standards to allow for mud huts, bush latrines \r\nand pit toilets as suitable for our urban people and for \r\nAfricans generally. Nothing can be more insulting and \r\ndegrading of a people than that. Surely we do not need \r\ndevelopment in reverse. \r\n Let me conclude by making my message to our \r\ndetractors very simple and clear. The people of \r\nZimbabwe came through a protracted guerrilla struggle \r\nto establish themselves as a free — I emphasize \r\n“free” — and sovereign nation. We indeed went \r\nthrough long and bitter times to get our freedom and \r\nindependence, and to be where we are today. We \r\ncherish that hard-won freedom and independence, and \r\nno amount of coercion, political, economic or \r\notherwise, will make us a colony again. But we also \r\ncherish peace and development and good regional and \r\ninternational relations. Together with all other nations \r\nof good will, we will continue to work tirelessly for a \r\njust, peaceful and prosperous world. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Zimbabwe for the statement he has just made. \r\nMr. Robert Gabriel Mugabe, President of the \r\nRepublic of Zimbabwe, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Alejandro Toledo Manrique, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Peru \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Peru. \r\n A/60/PV.11\r\n \r\n05-51226 7 \r\n \r\nMr. Alejandro Toledo Manrique, President of the \r\nRepublic of Peru, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Alejandro Toledo \r\nManrique, President of the Republic of Peru, and to \r\ninvite him to address the General Assembly. \r\n President Manrique (spoke in Spanish): Allow \r\nme first, Sir, to congratulate you on your election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixtieth \r\nsession. \r\n I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to \r\nexpress from the very bottom of the Peruvian heart our \r\nsincere feeling of solidarity with the women and men \r\nof the United States who have suffered as a result of \r\nthe natural disasters in Mississippi, Alabama and other \r\nsouthern states. Their suffering is shared by us, just as \r\nwe would share suffering anywhere in the world. I am \r\nsure that the faith and hope of the people of the United \r\nStates will enable them to overcome this tragedy. \r\n A year ago in this forum (see A/59/PV.5) I spoke \r\nof the need to face, with vision and realism, the new \r\nchallenges now facing us, the developing countries in \r\nparticular. On the one hand, our countries are \r\nbecoming part of the globalization of production, trade, \r\nfinancial flows, the digital telecommunications \r\nrevolution, and the spread of values such as democracy \r\nand human rights. At the same time, however, the \r\nworld is fragmented by an increase in social inequities, \r\nthe proliferation of civil wars, the collapse of States, \r\ngenocide, terrorism, transnational crime and \r\nenvironmental degradation. These contradictory trends \r\nof globalization on the one hand and fragmentation on \r\nthe other, call into question the governance within \r\nStates and within the international system, and \r\nultimately call into question international collective \r\nsecurity itself. \r\n Peace and security and the stability of the global \r\nsystem are not related only to political, military and \r\nstrategic issues. Peace and security also have social \r\nand economic components. Poverty and exclusion \r\nconspire against peace, security and democracy. Social \r\nexclusion triggers violence and instability, renders \r\ndemocracy fragile and leads to national and \r\ninternational fragmentation.  \r\n That is why we must agree on action to confront \r\nthese contradictions. That is the main commitment that \r\nwe as States undertook at the recent High-level Plenary \r\nMeeting on the Millennium Goals, and that is what the \r\nUnited Nations and the multilateral system as a whole \r\nmust tackle next. That is why I am highlighting the two \r\nmain axes along which these commitments must \r\ndevelop. I refer to security on the one hand and \r\ndevelopment on the other. \r\n While each country is responsible for its own \r\ndevelopment, it must be recognized that development \r\nencounters obstacles at the international level that call \r\nfor new partnerships and new forms of association. \r\nThese must go beyond the assistance-based paradigm \r\ncharacterizing much so-called development assistance. \r\nAnd, more important, they must overcome the \r\nasymmetry that currently prevails in relations between \r\ndeveloped and developing countries. \r\n On the one hand, developing countries are being \r\nasked to commit to open their markets, to foreign \r\ninvestment regimes and to reforming their public \r\nadministrations. We agree with all of that. But there is \r\nno matching solid commitment that developed \r\ncountries will, as promised, allocate 0.7 per cent of \r\ntheir gross national product (GNP) for cooperation. \r\nNor — even less — do we see obstacles to foreign \r\ntrade being dismantled.  \r\n The new partnership for development has to \r\novercome adverse factors for developing countries and \r\neliminate obstacles such as rigid intellectual property \r\nstandards, the speculative volatility of global capital, \r\nthe lack of foreign investment, subsidies, the debt \r\nburden, and, above all, the absence of genuine special \r\nand differential treatment in trade negotiations for \r\ndeveloping countries.  \r\n This is not only about receiving assistance to \r\nreduce poverty; it is also about a new association for \r\ndevelopment that will make it possible to generate \r\nemployment and create wealth. Implementing this new \r\npartnership would fulfil Millennium Development Goal \r\n8 and the commitments made in the Monterrey \r\nConsensus. That is why it is necessary for the Doha \r\nround to be completed next year. That is tremendously \r\nimportant.  \r\n As the Millennium Declaration recognizes, a very \r\nimportant cross-cutting element in the partnership for \r\ndevelopment is assuring the sustainability of the \r\nenvironment. As proof of our commitment, I was proud \r\nA/60/PV.11  \r\n \r\n8 05-51226 \r\n \r\nsome days ago to deposit the instruments of ratification \r\nof the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic \r\nPollutants and the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior \r\nInformed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous \r\nChemicals and Pesticides in International Trade, both \r\nof which are intended to reduce the negative impact of \r\npollution. \r\n As it carries out its development agenda, the \r\ninternational system must strengthen collective security \r\nto confront threats such as terrorism, nuclear \r\nproliferation, and organized transnational crime. This \r\nyear again, we have been shaken by acts of terrorism \r\nperpetuated all over the world. Peru suffered from, and \r\ncombated, terror for many long years, and expresses its \r\nsolidarity with the victims of these criminal acts. We \r\nreiterate our firm condemnation of all acts of terrorism \r\nand restate our commitment, through mutual \r\ncooperation, to prevent, combat, punish and eradicate \r\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Peru \r\nappeals to the Assembly not to continue to delay the \r\nadoption of a comprehensive counter-terrorism \r\nconvention.  \r\n For my Government, international peace and \r\nsecurity is a prime objective, and we have adopted the \r\nfollowing measures in that context. First, Peru is \r\npromoting the limitation of defence spending at the \r\nregional level in order to release resources for social \r\ninvestment. The first decision I adopted on my \r\nGovernment’s first day in office was to cut back \r\nmilitary expenditure in my country by 23 per cent in \r\norder to allocate it to food, health, education and social \r\ninvestments. Progress in this field has been significant; \r\nthere are agreements with Chile, Colombia and \r\nEcuador to craft and implement standardized \r\nmethodologies to reduce our military spending. \r\n Secondly, Peru was an advocate of the creation of \r\nthe South American Zone of Peace and Cooperation \r\nand the Andean Zone of Peace, which have been \r\nrecognized in Assembly resolutions 57/13 and 59/54, \r\nrespectively. \r\n Thirdly, Peru participated actively in formulating \r\nthe Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and \r\nEradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light \r\nWeapons in All Its Aspects.  \r\n Fourthly, Peru is participating in peacekeeping \r\noperations by providing troops, staff officers, military \r\nobservers and equipment. To increase our contribution \r\nin this area, Peru has signed a memorandum of \r\nunderstanding under the United Nations Stand-by \r\nArrangements System, which includes army, air force \r\nand navy units. Currently, Peruvian Blue Helmets are \r\nparticipating in peacekeeping operations in Eritrea-\r\nEthiopia, Liberia, Côte d’Ivoire, Burundi, the Sudan \r\nand the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as \r\nin Cyprus and Haiti. We cherish peace. \r\n For all these reasons, Peru is a candidate for a \r\nnon-permanent seat on the Security Council for the \r\nterm 2006-2007 in the elections to be held during this \r\nsession of the General Assembly of the United Nations. \r\nI should like here to express Peru’s deep gratitude for \r\nthe majority support for our candidacy; we now enjoy \r\nthe widest possible support from Latin American and \r\nCaribbean countries as well as from our brother \r\ncountries in Africa and Asia, the Arab League States \r\nand countries of Europe and of Oceania. This generous \r\nsupport encourages us and strengthens our commitment \r\nto work with dedication and responsibility in the \r\nSecurity Council. We are grateful for this opportunity \r\nand the support offered by countries worldwide for our \r\ncandidature for a non-permanent seat on the Security \r\nCouncil for 2006-2007. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Peru for the statement he has just made. \r\nMr. Alejandro Toledo Manrique, President of the \r\nRepublic of Peru, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Levy Patrick Mwanawasa, President \r\nand Minister for Defence of the Republic of Zambia \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Zambia. \r\nMr. Levy Patrick Mwanawasa, President and \r\nMinister for Defence of the Republic of Zambia, \r\nwas escorted into the General Assembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Levy Patrick Mwanawasa, \r\nPresident and Minister for Defence of the Republic of \r\nZambia, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Mwanawasa: I am pleased to join those \r\nwho have spoken before me in congratulating you, Sir, on \r\nyour election to the presidency of the sixtieth session of \r\nthe General Assembly. For us in Zambia your election is \r\nespecially significant given the historic bond of friendship \r\n A/60/PV.11\r\n \r\n05-51226 9 \r\n \r\nthat exists between our countries. It was in our country \r\nthat your illustrious compatriot, then Secretary-General \r\nDag Hammarskjöld, lost his life in 1961 while on a \r\nmission for peace in the Congo.  \r\n I pay tribute to your predecessor, His Excellency \r\nMr. Jean Ping, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nRepublic of Gabon, who presided over the fifty-ninth \r\nsession, for his selfless commitment and devotion to \r\nthe search for consensus on the outcome document \r\nwhich the Assembly adopted two days ago (resolution \r\n60/1). My delegation’s appreciation also goes to the \r\nSecretary-General, His Excellency, Mr. Kofi Annan, \r\nfor his outstanding leadership and dedication to the \r\nwell-being of the Organization. \r\n Five years ago we committed ourselves to eight \r\nidentifiable Development Goals. Today we have \r\nrecommitted ourselves to uphold the principles and \r\nmeet the Goals set out in the historic Millennium \r\nDeclaration. We hope that the commitments we have \r\nundertaken will not remain mere empty words but that, \r\nthis time around, the international community will \r\nmake a concerted effort to implement them. In this \r\nregard we are inspired by the report of the High-level \r\nPanel on Threats, Challenges and Change (A/59/565). \r\nThose of us from Africa see the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral (A/59/2005) as an opportunity to realize the \r\ngoals set out in the Organization of African Unity’s \r\n1997 Harare Declaration, which called for the reform \r\nof the United Nations Security Council. \r\n My delegation supports the demand of the \r\nAfrican Union for two permanent seats on the Security \r\nCouncil, with all the privileges attached to such seats, \r\nincluding the right of veto. Our position is not meant to \r\nfrustrate the reform process. The African region \r\nconsiders the reform of the Organization as an \r\nopportunity to correct historical injustices that stand as \r\na dark cloud over our people. We would actually prefer \r\nthat the right of veto be removed from the United \r\nNations, as it is undemocratic. We are, however, aware \r\nthat some permanent members of the Security Council \r\nare reluctant to give up the veto power at the moment. \r\nIt is in this regard that Africa, like other regions, \r\ndeserves the right of veto, as the absence of that right \r\nwill only serve to perpetuate the marginalization of the \r\ncontinent. \r\n The position I have outlined does not in any way \r\nmean that Africa is against the expansion of the \r\nSecurity Council to include other important countries \r\nthat contribute to international peace and security. Let \r\nme reaffirm in this regard that Zambia supports the \r\nfour candidate States of Brazil, Germany, India and \r\nJapan for permanent membership of the Security \r\nCouncil with full privileges, including that of veto \r\npower. I am only stressing that Africa is entitled to, and \r\ndeserves the right of, permanent representation in the \r\nSecurity Council, with the right of veto, not only as a \r\nmatter of correcting an historical injustice against \r\nAfrica but also to uphold the democratic principles of \r\nregional equality. \r\n Two days ago we adopted the outcome document \r\nof the High-level Plenary Meeting of the General \r\nAssembly on the review of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). The High-level Plenary \r\nMeeting provided a rare opportunity for us to share \r\nexperiences in the implementation of the development \r\nagenda, in particular, and highlighted the need for \r\nenhanced international cooperation and coordination if \r\nwe are to achieve much-sought-after economic \r\ndevelopment. While the document does not contain \r\neverything we would have wanted to include, it \r\nnevertheless represents an important basis for \r\ncontinued dialogue during this session. \r\n Since 2001 Africa has been implementing the \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), \r\nwhose main objective is to enhance the capacity of \r\nAfrican countries to reduce the high incidence of \r\npoverty on the continent and to strengthen efforts to \r\nachieve sustainable economic development. While we \r\nacknowledge the support that the international \r\ncommunity has so far rendered to the realization of \r\nNEPAD’s objectives, it is also true that this support \r\nthat has proved to be insufficient. \r\n It is the view of my Government that while \r\nofficial development assistance (ODA) may help in the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals, \r\ntrade would help to sustain those gains. In this regard, \r\nZambia urges all stakeholders to bring to a speedy \r\nconclusion the Doha round of trade negotiations, which \r\nwill act as a catalyst towards achieving sustainable \r\ndevelopment. The external debt problem is still a major \r\nhindrance to development. The current unfavourable \r\nterms in agriculture and commodity trading make the \r\nproblem even more unbearable. \r\n My delegation commends the United Nations for \r\nsupporting the efforts of the African Union’s peace \r\ninitiatives on the continent. The Pan-African \r\nA/60/PV.11  \r\n \r\n10 05-51226 \r\n \r\nParliament and the Peace and Security Council are part \r\nof the infrastructure in support of peace and security. In \r\nthis regard, I wish to pledge Zambia’s continued \r\nsupport of the process. \r\n Zambia, as one of the core States of the Great \r\nLakes region, would like to associate itself with the \r\nremarkable progress that continues to be made in the \r\nareas of peace and security in the subregion since the \r\n17 November 2003 report of the Secretary-General to \r\nthe Security Council on preparations for an \r\ninternational conference on the Great Lakes region \r\n(S/2003/1099). We are encouraged by some positive \r\ndevelopments brought about so far through the process \r\nof regional ownership and international partnership and \r\nthe combined efforts of the United Nations, the African \r\nUnion, the Group of Friends and the subregional \r\nGovernments concerned. \r\n My Government will continue to play its part in \r\nthe fight against international terrorism. Zambia rejects \r\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We are \r\ndetermined to work with the rest of the international \r\ncommunity to implement the counter-terrorism \r\nstrategy.  \r\n Zambia is committed to promoting and respecting \r\nhuman rights, the rule of law and democracy. In \r\nZambia we believe that democracy is a universal value. \r\nWe believe therefore it is under conditions of \r\ndemocracy that all human rights are protected. \r\n Allow me to conclude my statement by referring \r\nto the efforts my Government is making to fight \r\ncorruption. The nation as a whole has realized that the \r\nstate of our economy could have been much better if \r\nall the resources available had been utilized properly. \r\nIn this regard, one cannot overemphasize the fact that \r\ncorruption erodes the incomes of households and \r\nbusinesses, thus defeating efforts to reduce poverty. I \r\nwish to explain that the Zambia Task Force on \r\nCorruption is an instrument for development that my \r\nGovernment hopes will enhance the capacity to utilize \r\npublic resources for purposes that benefit the nation as \r\na whole. More important, the attainment of the Heavily \r\nIndebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative completion \r\npoint by my country can, in large measure, be \r\nattributed to the success of the campaign against \r\ncorruption, which prompted the Government to \r\nintroduce stringent financial controls and transparent \r\nand accountable public expenditure measures. The \r\nUnited Nations should consider increasing its resources \r\nin the fight against corruption. \r\n As we mark the sixtieth anniversary of this, our \r\ngreat institution, we cannot but conclude that its \r\nimportance and continued relevance to mankind is \r\nbeyond question. It is in that context that we need to \r\nrevitalize it in order for it to fulfil the ideals for which \r\nit was established. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Zambia for the statement he has just made. I \r\nparticularly want to thank him for his words about \r\nformer Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld, who, 44 \r\nyears ago this very weekend, lost his life in an air crash \r\nin Zambia while on a mission for peace in the Congo. \r\nMr. Levy Patrick Mwanawasa, President and \r\nMinister for Defence of the Republic of Zambia, \r\nwas escorted from the General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Tassos Papadopoulos, President of \r\nthe Republic of Cyprus \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Cyprus. \r\nMr. Tassos Papadopoulos, President of the \r\nRepublic of Cyprus, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Tassos Papadopoulos, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Cyprus, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly. \r\n President Papadopoulos: Before proceeding \r\nwith my remarks, I wish to begin by indicating that my \r\ndelegation fully subscribes to the statement delivered \r\nby the presidency of the European Union.  \r\n At the outset, Sir, let me express my sincere \r\ncongratulations to you on your election to the \r\npresidency of this session of the General Assembly and \r\nmy sincere gratitude to Mr. Jean Ping, President at the \r\nfifty-ninth session, for his tireless efforts during a very \r\ncrucial year for the United Nations. \r\n With the end of the summit, we have entered a far \r\nmore crucial phase, that of the follow-up and \r\nimplementation of its outcome and the furtherance of \r\nthe progress achieved, especially in terms of those \r\ntargets which have been subject to an enforcement road \r\n A/60/PV.11\r\n \r\n05-51226 11 \r\n \r\nmap since the Millennium Summit. The realization of \r\nthe content of the summit outcome document \r\n(resolution 60/1) in conjunction with reforming the \r\nUnited Nations, may very well decide the \r\nOrganization’s relevance and standing in decades to \r\ncome and with it the fate of our attempts to render \r\neffective multilateralism the cornerstone of \r\ninternational order. Beyond the wide spectrum of \r\nissues covered in the summit’s outcome document, we \r\nmust not lose sight of those realities on which the \r\nUnited Nations must — and is expected to — remain \r\nprimarily focused. For these, we must go back to the \r\ngenesis of the Organization. In the wake of the Second \r\nWorld War, a vision emerged to establish a system of \r\ncollective security and institutionalized mechanisms \r\nthat would ensure the maximization of conflict \r\nprevention and the minimization of the duration and \r\nimpact of a conflict.  \r\n Not only has the new century inherited many of \r\nthe challenges and problems of the previous one, but \r\nnew scourges have emerged that jeopardize the \r\nlegitimacy and the very existence of our system of \r\ncollective security. These require an urgent response \r\nfrom the international community through an action-\r\noriented strategy encompassing the appropriate \r\ninstitutional framework, appropriate decision-making \r\nmechanisms and the efficient implementation of our \r\ncommitments. Fulfilling our pledges in a timely \r\nmanner is not a responsibility applicable only to \r\ntraditional security threats. Terrorism, transnational \r\ncrime and many other security deficits require our full \r\nattention in the form of elaborating result-oriented \r\naction plans. Regarding, for instance, weapons of mass \r\ndestruction, although we are aware of the inextricable \r\nlink between disarmament and non-proliferation, we \r\nhave not yet been able to strike the kind of balance that \r\nwould allow us to pursue them equally and \r\nsimultaneously. And while we have identified \r\nunderdevelopment and poverty as key enemies of \r\nstability, this realization is not yet adequately reflected \r\nin our actions.  \r\n The assessment of the current state of the world \r\nthrough the comprehensive report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the work of the Organization, which we \r\nhave before us in document A/60/1, leads to the \r\nconclusion that long-standing conflicts, with all their \r\nramifications, remain a primary source of concern for \r\nthe international community. Africa is a prime example \r\nof this. Today more than ever, and rightly so, it remains \r\nat the core of our mobilization. Our endeavour to make \r\na difference there in terms of conflict resolution, \r\npeacekeeping and peacebuilding and fighting poverty, \r\nunderdevelopment and deadly diseases will be the \r\nlitmus test of the effectiveness of our commitment to \r\nmeet the Millennium Goals. \r\n The Middle East is another test case. In recent \r\nweeks it has been proven that reciprocal gestures have \r\nthe capacity to construct common ground, even where \r\nthat does not seem on the surface to exist. Israel’s \r\nwithdrawal from Gaza and parts of the northern West \r\nBank is an important development that should lead to \r\nthe implementation of the Quartet’s road map. Israel’s \r\nparadigm of removing settlers is one to be followed by \r\nother occupying Powers using settlers as a means of \r\nwarfare. Even though the security situation is still \r\nfragile, and even though the political negotiation might \r\nnot always be moving forward, the parties are offered a \r\nclosed course in the form of the road map, which has \r\nthe potential to steadily lead to progress. Furthermore, \r\nwe firmly believe that the gathering momentum would \r\nbe aided by strict adherence to international law and \r\ninternational humanitarian law, including the 4 July \r\n2004 advisory opinion of the International Court of \r\nJustice on the construction of the barrier. \r\n Let me now turn to the Cyprus problem. Almost \r\n18 months have elapsed since the April 2004 referenda \r\non the Annan plan. Let me stress once more that in \r\nrejecting that plan the Greek Cypriots rejected neither \r\nfinding a solution that would reunify Cyprus nor the \r\nurgency of achieving this. They rejected that particular \r\nplan because it did not provide for and could not bring \r\nabout the reunification of the country, its society, its \r\neconomy and its institutions. During this time we have \r\nnot remained idle. Our priority has been to revisit the \r\ncontent, product and shortcomings of the last \r\nnegotiation process which led to the referenda. \r\nSimultaneously, emphasis was placed on dispelling \r\ncertain misconceptions that were solidified as a result \r\nof the last negotiation process. \r\n One such misconception was that our constant \r\nand keen pursuit of peace and of achieving the \r\nreunification of our country has been diminished or \r\nthat we have come to terms with the unacceptable \r\ndivision of our country which was imposed in 1974 by \r\nthe invasion and occupation of 37 per cent of our land. \r\nThe second misconception concerns the role of the \r\nUnited Nations in offering and continuing its good \r\noffices mission mandated to the Secretary-General by \r\nA/60/PV.11  \r\n \r\n12 05-51226 \r\n \r\nthe Security Council. The Secretary-General’s mandate \r\nfor the good offices mission has not come to an end but \r\nhas entered a new phase with the end of the referenda. \r\nRegardless of its level of activation at different times, \r\nthis mission is an ongoing and sustained process. \r\nThrough it we expect the Organization to broker a \r\nnegotiated settlement without any arbitration. The \r\nactive contribution of the European Union in this \r\nregard would be catalytic. Only an agreed settlement \r\nendorsed by the leadership of the two communities can \r\nbe put to referenda. The timetable for seeking a \r\nsolution should genuinely and exclusively be \r\ndetermined by the parameters of the Cyprus problem, \r\nand as such there should be no deadlines embedded in \r\nthe process that are dictated by exogenous elements. \r\nWe remain committed to holding negotiations under \r\nthe umbrella of the United Nations and to working for \r\nthe creation of those conditions that will render fruitful \r\nnegotiations feasible. In this context we have been \r\nimplementing substantial practical measures on the \r\nground with the aim of building confidence and \r\npromoting the economic development of the Turkish \r\nCypriots. We hope that enhancing cooperation between \r\nGreek and Turkish Cypriots will be conducive to \r\nmaking progress on different aspects of the Cyprus \r\nproblem, especially the elements composing its \r\nhumanitarian dimension such as the fate of missing \r\npersons and the welfare of those in enclaves. \r\n The divisive character of the most recent plan, \r\nwhich essentially led to its rejection, epitomized its \r\nremoteness from the essence of the problem. Another \r\nsource of great concern is the apparent willingness of \r\nactors involved in the process to concede a \r\ndisproportionately large number of politically driven \r\ndemands at the expense of those principles that should \r\ngovern the solution. It should be clarified that a \r\nsettlement should be formulated on the basis of the \r\nconcerns and expectations of the people of Cyprus as a \r\nwhole and should not aim at accommodating the \r\ninterests of foreign Powers on the island. The Cyprus \r\nproblem is at a critical juncture. Time may not be \r\nworking in favour of reaching a settlement, but we \r\nmust keep in mind that we cannot afford any more \r\nfailed attempts. We should be particularly cautious but \r\nresolute. Revival of the talks requires thorough \r\npreparation and an honest assessment that the prospect \r\nof success is at least credible. This in turn requires \r\nconfirmation that the Turkish political aims have now \r\nchanged and that Turkey has reconciled itself to the \r\nfact that achieving a settlement is synonymous with the \r\nconcept of a single, reunified State. \r\n We have always hoped that Turkey’s accession \r\ncourse to the European Union would radically shift its \r\nmentality, a prospect that would mark the single \r\nbiggest development in the Cyprus problem in decades. \r\nThe fulfilment of Turkey’s obligations emanating from \r\nits accession course to the European Union will ipso \r\njure rid the Cyprus problem of some of its most \r\nintractable components and facilitate a settlement. \r\nSimultaneously, the existence of the United Nations \r\nnegotiating framework cannot serve as a pretext for \r\npostponing or refusing to fulfil these obligations.  \r\n For our part, we remain committed to a bizonal, \r\nbicommunal federal Cyprus in line with what we \r\nconsider to be the pillars of the survival of this model \r\nof settlement — the high-level agreements, United \r\nNations resolutions, international law and the acquis \r\ncommunautaire. We anticipate that these will safeguard \r\nthe right of all Cypriots to preserve their fundamental \r\ninterests while simultaneously taking into account their \r\nmost basic concerns. \r\n Aside from procedure, the time has come to go \r\nback to basics and realize that as long as the basic \r\naspects of the problem are not truly tackled, progress \r\nwill be difficult. Without dealing with the core \r\ncomponents of the problem by putting an end to the \r\nmilitary occupation, the massive violations of human \r\nrights and the plight of the refugees and by effectively \r\naddressing the question of settlers deliberately and \r\nillegally transported to the occupied part of the island, \r\nthere can be no solution. At the same time, for progress \r\nto be realized on the ground all secessionist attempts \r\non Cyprus must be terminated immediately, in \r\naccordance with the relevant Security Council \r\nresolutions, and a single vision based on the unification \r\nof the island must prevail.  \r\n Unfortunately, however, we have not been \r\nmoving closer to these imperatives. Instead we have \r\nbeen witnessing for well over a year a tendency to \r\nentrench the faits accomplis on Cyprus, particularly \r\nthrough an outburst of illegal exploitation of Greek-\r\nCypriot-owned property in its occupied part. \r\n In establishing the new constitutional and \r\ninstitutional set-up we should avoid artificial structures \r\nthat will require an abnormally long transitional period \r\nto be absorbed by the people and the institutions at a \r\ngreat socio-economic cost. We visualize that seeking a \r\n A/60/PV.11\r\n \r\n05-51226 13 \r\n \r\nsettlement will increasingly centre on and fall under \r\nthe establishment of a functional, working democracy \r\nthat does not require exceptionally taxing efforts for \r\nbasic governance. We also visualize that with Cyprus’s \r\nmembership of the European Union taking solid root, a \r\nsettlement would encompass an integration of the \r\ncurrently occupied area to the characteristics of a \r\nEuropean society and the standards of the acquis \r\ncommunautaire in full harmony with the rest of the \r\nisland, and leading to a process of osmosis there. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Cyprus for the statement he has just made. \r\nMr. Tassos Papadopoulos, President of the \r\nRepublic of Cyprus, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Fradique Bandeira Melo de Menezes, \r\nPresident of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome \r\nand Principe \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Democratic Republic of \r\nSao Tome and Principe. \r\nMr. Fradique Bandeira Melo de Menezes, \r\nPresident of the Democratic Republic of Sao \r\nTome and Principe, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Fradique Bandeira Melo de \r\nMenezes, President of the Democratic Republic of Sao \r\nTome and Principe, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly. \r\n President De Menezes (spoke in Portuguese; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): First, Sir, I \r\nshould like to extend my sincere congratulations to you \r\non the occasion of your election to the presidency of \r\nthe sixtieth session of the General Assembly and to \r\nwish you the greatest success in conducting the work \r\nof the Assembly. I am also pleased to take this \r\nopportunity to offer my sincere thanks to your \r\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Jean Ping, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Gabonese Republic, for the \r\nconsiderable results produced during his term as \r\nPresident, especially towards the end of the session, \r\nwhen we reviewed matters related to the \r\nimplementation of the Millennium Goals and the \r\nreform of the United Nations. \r\n I should also like to take this opportunity to \r\nexpress our appreciation to the Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Kofi Annan, for his valuable efforts to bolster and \r\npropel the role of the United Nations in international \r\npeacekeeping, security and development. The report by \r\nMr. Kofi Annan (A/59/2005) and the recommendations \r\nset out in it provide us with important elements capable \r\nof leading to consensus on strategies that will help us \r\nto achieve the Millennium Goals and to make progress \r\non reforming the United Nations. \r\n I cannot fail to take advantage of this opportunity, \r\non behalf of the people of Sao Tome and Principe, to \r\nreiterate to the Government and the people of the \r\nUnited States of America and to the bereaved families \r\nour sincere condolences regarding the tragedy caused \r\nby Hurricane Katrina. These difficult times, being \r\nexperienced by a large part of the American people, \r\ncannot leave us indifferent, above all because we are \r\nfully aware of the role that the American people and its \r\nGovernment play in international solidarity and \r\ncooperation, constantly seeking peace and prosperity \r\nfor peoples in difficulty, and of their support and \r\nfinancing of this great Organization. \r\n From the early days of the signing of the Charter \r\nin 1945 in San Francisco, the United Nations has \r\nplayed a crucial role in undertaking many matters of a \r\npolitical, economic, social and humanitarian nature \r\nthroughout the world. Nevertheless, it seems to us that \r\nthe world now needs a stronger and more dynamic \r\nUnited Nations. The present session takes place in a \r\nvery complex international environment. Indeed, the \r\nclimate of permanent tension experienced in some \r\nparts of the world, the unbridled arms race, human \r\ntrafficking, cross-border organized crime, terrorism, \r\nsystematic violations of human rights, economic \r\ndepression and environmental degradation constitute \r\nimportant matters that are in need of the attention of \r\nthe United Nations now and in the years to come. In \r\nthe face of such challenges, Member States must \r\nmanifest a sense of wisdom and responsibility in order \r\nfor an international order based on peace, security and \r\ncooperation to prevail. \r\n Small island States met this year in Mauritius to \r\nevaluate the Barbados Programme of Action for the \r\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing \r\nStates. In Mauritius, States reaffirmed their \r\nA/60/PV.11  \r\n \r\n14 05-51226 \r\n \r\ncommitment to support the efforts of small island \r\ndeveloping States that would lead to sustainable \r\ndevelopment through a greater and more effective \r\nimplementation of the Barbados Programme of Action. \r\nDecisions and recommendations were adopted on \r\nclimate change, natural and environmental disasters, \r\nwater resources, waste management, tourism, energy, \r\ntransportation, biodiversity and marine and coastal \r\nresources. All the problems that affect small island \r\nStates, from global warming to ecosystem problems, \r\ncan be resolved only if the international community \r\nmakes an effort to effectively increase the resources \r\nthat will support the sustained development of small \r\nisland States. In this regard, we would like to take the \r\nopportunity to express our thanks both to the \r\ninternational community and to the Government of \r\nMauritius for the efforts made to organize the special \r\nconference. \r\n International security is based on the protection \r\nof the people and on education for capacity-building, \r\npromoting a community’s development. Nations that \r\ndo not pay attention those factors could be in a state of \r\npermanent tension, which is not conducive to progress. \r\nFor this reason HIV/AIDS, poverty, political crises, \r\nongoing violations of human rights, oppression and \r\noccupation constitute threats to human security.  \r\n Many of our countries continue to face challenges \r\nin combating HIV/AIDS and other illnesses. In some \r\nregions of Africa HIV/AIDS is devastating families, \r\ncultures and economies — entire societies. The cost of \r\ntreatment continues to be extremely high and our \r\neconomies are beginning to buckle under the effects of \r\nthe illness. If significant resources and additional \r\nscientific investment for research to seek a cure for \r\nHIV/AIDS are not forthcoming the development \r\nexpectations of Africa will be far from being met. \r\n Very recently the Republic of Angola was \r\nattacked by the worst outbreak ever of Marburg fever, \r\ncaused by a virus related to the Ebola virus. We are \r\nconcerned because Sao Tome and Principe, being an \r\nintegral part of the Central African States, cannot \r\nremove itself from that situation. We appeal to the \r\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) to strengthen the \r\ncapabilities of the countries of the subregion by \r\nholding seminars and providing training. This initiative \r\nwill help us to deal prophylactically with similar \r\nsituations that might arise. Likewise, malaria continues \r\nto be a serious public health problem for my country \r\ndespite its active involvement with existing \r\nprogrammes supported by several countries and \r\norganizations. \r\n The situation of insecurity primarily affects the \r\nmost vulnerable populations, especially refugees, \r\nchildren, women and the elderly. Terrorism is \r\ndestabilizing Governments, destroying lives and \r\nclaiming innocent victims. We are faced with a \r\nchallenge that requires reformulating our strategies to \r\ncombat it. It seems entirely appropriate to start with an \r\nunderstanding of the origins of the problem by \r\nidentifying its causes, and then to forge new \r\nconsensuses and improve the methods of combating the \r\nproblem and implementing Security Council resolution \r\n1373 (2001). However, the United Nations must take \r\nadditional action to benefit States which, like my own, \r\nare not in a position to fully comply with all the \r\nprovisions of that resolution. We need resources that \r\nwill contribute to the improvement, inter alia, of our \r\nsecurity, including control of our borders and territorial \r\nwaters. Here, strengthening our capability to fight the \r\nphenomenon of terrorism is a priority. \r\n In my capacity as President of the Community of \r\nPortuguese-Speaking Countries, I should like to refer \r\nto Guinea-Bissau, which has just successfully \r\nconcluded a long and difficult political transition. First, \r\nlet me congratulate the people and the authorities of \r\nthat country on their success. I commend the \r\ninternational community, and in particular the United \r\nNations and its Secretary-General, for its prompt \r\ncontribution, which bolstered the people’s action for \r\npeace, stability and development. Now, Guinea-Bissau \r\nfaces the giant task of promoting development and \r\nwell-being for its population. The international \r\ncommunity must therefore continue to provide its \r\ntraditional help so that legitimate expectations may not \r\nbe frustrated. \r\n The universality of the Organization requires that \r\nall nations must be represented. However, this \r\ncontinues not to be so despite several calls for it. As we \r\nreflect on reforming the United Nations, we must once \r\nagain take advantage of the opportunity from this \r\nrostrum to invite the international community to review \r\nthe problem of the need for the Republic of China on \r\nTaiwan to be represented in the Organization. In this \r\nregard, my country signed the letter contained in \r\ndocument A/60/192 requesting the inclusion of an item \r\nin the agenda of the present session entitled “Question \r\nof the representation of the 23 million people of \r\n A/60/PV.11\r\n \r\n05-51226 15 \r\n \r\nTaiwan in the United Nations”. Once again, we have \r\nlost an opportunity to correct this injustice. \r\n We are further concerned by the recent adoption \r\nby the People’s Republic of China of the so-called anti-\r\nsecession law, which, by increasing tension in the \r\nStrait of Taiwan, may compromise peace in the region. \r\nAware of the role of the United Nations, specifically \r\nunder the provisions of Articles 1 and 34 of the \r\nCharter, Sao Tome and Principe also joined in \r\nproposing the draft resolution annexed to document \r\nA/60/193. That document contains a letter requesting \r\nthe inclusion of a supplementary item in the agenda of \r\nthe present session entitled, “A proactive role for the \r\nUnited Nations in maintaining peace in the Taiwan \r\nStrait”. Neither proposal received the expected support. \r\n We are faced with an excellent opportunity to \r\ninfuse our Organization with greater dynamism and \r\nrationality, more action and less bureaucracy. Reform \r\nof the system is urgent. It is a high priority. To that \r\nend, we must all work without hesitation for the good \r\nof the world to which we belong. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\nMr. Fradique Bandeira Melo de Menezes, \r\nPresident of the Democratic Republic of Sao \r\nTome and Principe, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nItem 9 of the provisional agenda (continued) \r\n \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\n The President: I call now on His Excellency \r\nMr. Kassymzhomart K. Tokaev, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Republic of Kazakhstan. \r\n Mr. Tokaev (Kazakhstan): We can safely claim \r\nthat the United Nations summit that has just been \r\nconcluded will have far-reaching implications for our \r\nOrganization. Its outcome has prepared the ground for \r\nthe most radical reform in the entire history of the \r\nUnited Nations. An effective response by the family of \r\nnations to global challenges and threats is the ultimate \r\ngoal of these reforms. Kazakhstan expresses its \r\nconfidence that the United Nations, as a universal \r\nOrganization to which there is no alternative, is in a \r\nposition to achieve that goal. \r\n As a matter of principle, Kazakhstan supports \r\ncloser interdependence among the three main pillars of \r\nthe contemporary world: development, freedom and \r\npeace. Yet the issues of development should continue \r\nto be the focus of attention of the world community. \r\nThe Millennium Development Goals can be achieved \r\nonly through the active engagement of the entire \r\ninternational community on the basis of partnership \r\nand cooperation. Kazakhstan is committed to its \r\nundertakings with regard to the timely and effective \r\nattainment of the Millennium Development Goals. The \r\nrecently published report on Kazakhstan’s progress in \r\nimplementing the Millennium Development Goals \r\nreport in Kazakhstan reveals that as a result of \r\nsuccessful reforms my country is close to reaching \r\nimportant targets in this area.  \r\n Today Kazakhstan is confidently leading other \r\npost-Soviet States in all macroeconomic indicators. \r\nThe Government of Kazakhstan is implementing a \r\nlarge-scale programme to ensure further development \r\nin the social field. Human development is the focus of \r\nall these efforts. Kazakhstan is reaching a new level in \r\nthe area of sustainable development. The national \r\nGovernment is paying priority attention to poverty, \r\nwomen’s issues, employment, financial aid from the \r\nState to poor families, the development of small and \r\nmedium-sized businesses, and large-scale educational, \r\nhealth and environmental programmes.  \r\n We commend the United Nations and its \r\nspecialized agencies for their efforts to assist our \r\ncountry in addressing the effects of environmental \r\ndisasters in the area of the Aral Sea and in the \r\nSemipalatinsk region. The problems facing those \r\nregions are global in their scope as the environmental \r\nsituation there has negative effects on the habitat and \r\nlivelihood of people all over the world. We urge the \r\ninternational community to be involved actively. In \r\nparticular we ask it at this session of the General \r\nAssembly to support a draft resolution to be sponsored \r\nby Kazakhstan on the problems of the Semipalatinsk \r\nregion.  \r\n International trade is an important factor for \r\ndevelopment. Accession to the World Trade \r\nOrganization (WTO) is a priority for Kazakhstan. We \r\nconsider further liberalization of trade and WTO \r\nmembership as key elements of our country’s general \r\ndevelopment strategy. In 2003 Kazakhstan hosted the \r\nInternational Ministerial Conference on Transit \r\nTransport Cooperation. We attach great importance to \r\nA/60/PV.11  \r\n \r\n16 05-51226 \r\n \r\nthat forum and believe that the special needs of \r\nlandlocked developing countries should be fully taken \r\ninto account in accordance with the decisions and \r\nrecommendations emanating from the Almaty \r\nProgramme of Action. The integration of Kazakhstan \r\nand other Central Asian States into the world economy \r\nis of exceptional importance both for the social and \r\neconomic development of our region and for the world \r\neconomy in general. Our country is committed to \r\ncomprehensive cooperation with the other States of \r\nCentral Asia. That is our consistent policy, unswayed \r\nby political exigencies. \r\n Since the early years of its independence, \r\nKazakhstan has been pursuing a principled policy of \r\ndemilitarization and nuclear disarmament. We call for \r\nthe universalization of international instruments in that \r\narea. This year we marked the tenth anniversary of the \r\nremoval from the territory of Kazakhstan of all nuclear \r\ndevices left over from the former Soviet Union. \r\nKazakhstan has set a commendable example by \r\nvoluntarily eliminating its nuclear arsenal, the fourth \r\nlargest in the world, and shutting down the \r\nSemipalatinsk nuclear testing ground, the site of nearly \r\n500 nuclear explosions.  \r\n The global security system is in serious crisis \r\ntoday. The 2005 Review Conference of the Parties to \r\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons (NPT) failed to set up a balanced and \r\ncomprehensive mechanism that would facilitate the \r\nstrengthening of the international non-proliferation \r\nregime and the complete elimination of nuclear \r\nweapons.  \r\n Even more disturbing is the lack of clear \r\nrecommendations on non-proliferation and disarmament \r\nin the outcome document of the summit (resolution 60/1). \r\nWe believe that it is necessary to put in place a \r\nmechanism for international sanctions against States that \r\nviolate both the NPT Treaty and the non-proliferation \r\nregime in general. Otherwise we will not be able to \r\nprevent the continuous spread of nuclear weapons around \r\nthe world. Our country calls for the establishment and \r\nenhancement of controls over nuclear, chemical and \r\nbiological materials and their production technologies in \r\norder to prevent terrorists from getting hold of deadly \r\nweapons. \r\n Kazakhstan recognizes the special role of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). All of \r\nour country’s nuclear activities are being carried out in \r\naccordance with its standards and under its control. It \r\nis time to establish similar effective bodies within the \r\nframework of the international Conventions on \r\nchemical and biological weapons.  \r\n The international community should not relax \r\nefforts to combat illegal trafficking in conventional \r\narms. According to the United Nations, some 500 \r\nmillion small arms and light weapons are in circulation \r\nall over the world. We share the view of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, who has compared small arms to weapons of \r\nmass destruction, because, year after year, they kill \r\nhundreds of thousands of people all over the world, \r\nthus fostering a culture of violence and terror and \r\ntrampling on human rights. \r\n Kazakhstan categorically condemns terrorism in \r\nall its forms and manifestations and considers it to be \r\nthe most dangerous threat in today’s world. We are \r\nconvinced that economic and social underdevelopment, \r\npoverty and misery breed international terrorism. That \r\nis why speedy economic advancement of poor \r\ncountries is a priority task.  \r\n Yet the ideology of terrorism is a factor of no \r\nlesser importance. It is extremely dangerous that young \r\npeople are increasingly being sucked into the \r\nideological orbit of international terrorism. Fighting \r\nterrorism is a mission of paramount importance. For \r\nthat reason, close attention should be paid to the efforts \r\nto prevent recruitment for terrorist operations.  \r\n In that context, the international community must \r\nurgently take practical steps to curb the ongoing drug \r\ntrafficking across Central Asia. We cannot but be \r\nseriously concerned by the situation in Afghanistan. \r\nKazakhstan appreciates cooperation with the United \r\nNations Office on Drugs and Crime.  \r\n Enhanced regional cooperation in the struggle \r\nagainst international terrorism is also important. The \r\nShanghai Cooperation Organization sets a positive \r\nexample in that regard.  \r\n Kazakhstan believes that international \r\ncooperation in fighting terrorism should be pursued in \r\nstrict compliance with the norms of international law. \r\nWe support further universalization and enhancement \r\nof anti-terrorist treaty mechanisms. The signing by \r\nKazakhstan of the International Convention for the \r\nSuppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism is a practical \r\nreaffirmation of that position. We are looking forward \r\nto the early completion of a comprehensive convention \r\n A/60/PV.11\r\n \r\n05-51226 17 \r\n \r\nagainst international terrorism. At the same time, joint \r\npractical actions to curb that evil represent a key \r\nelement of the international community’s counter-\r\nterrorism activities. \r\n International peacekeeping operations conducted \r\nunder the umbrella of the United Nations remain an \r\neffective tool to prevent and settle crises and to ensure \r\nglobal and regional stability. The lack of an effective \r\nand comprehensive mechanism to address the root \r\ncauses of destructive conflicts is a serious problem of \r\npeacekeeping. Preventive action and post-conflict \r\npeacebuilding constitute important elements of a \r\ncomprehensive response by the United Nations to \r\nemerging crisis situations.  \r\n For Kazakhstan, the proposed Peacebuilding \r\nCommission is a step in the right direction. As its main \r\nmission it should strive to avert the recurrence of \r\nsituations in which the lack of a peacebuilding strategy \r\nresults in the escalation of internal conflicts and \r\nultimately in States further losing their capacity to \r\nperform their sovereign functions in an effective and \r\nresponsible way.  \r\n Our country is actively working on issues related \r\nto the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-\r\nbuilding Measures in Asia (CICA), which we treat as \r\nan important and useful forum for the exchange of \r\nviews on security issues in the Asian region. It is \r\nencouraging to see that the CICA process is gaining \r\nmomentum and has already become an important factor \r\nin today’s international relations. \r\n Kazakhstan believes that the rule of law should \r\nplay a leading role in international affairs today. \r\nIgnoring this principle is one of the main threats to \r\npeace and security. Continuing its consistent efforts to \r\naccede to international treaties concluded within the \r\nframework of the United Nations and to implement \r\ntheir provisions, Kazakhstan intends to ensure strict \r\ncompliance with the rule of law at both national and \r\ninternational levels.  \r\n We closely link our country’s development to \r\nbuilding a democratic society based on respect for the \r\nrights and freedoms of every individual. Kazakhstan \r\nsupports the strengthening of democratic institutions \r\nand the human rights mechanisms of the United \r\nNations designed to promote the rights and freedoms of \r\ncitizens and to ensure compliance with the principles \r\nof non-interference and the sovereign equality of \r\nStates.  \r\n Kazakhstan supports efforts to carry out a \r\ncomprehensive reform of the United Nations \r\nencompassing all its principal organs. We strongly \r\nbelieve that priority attention should be paid to the \r\nGeneral Assembly as the main deliberative, decision-\r\nmaking and representative body of the Organization. \r\nThe sensitive issue of reform of the Security Council \r\nshould be resolved on the basis of broad international \r\nagreement. We are convinced that the enlargement of \r\nthe Security Council in accordance with the principle \r\nof equitable geographical representation and taking \r\ninto account the contribution of States concerned \r\ntowards the development of the world economy and \r\nglobal security would serve the interests of many \r\nStates and would facilitate comprehensive reform of \r\nthe United Nations. \r\n The United Nations needs to improve \r\ncollaboration with regional organizations that make an \r\nimportant contribution to the collective security \r\nsystem. Kazakhstan has repeatedly proposed the \r\ncreation of a standing body under the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that would coordinate cooperation between \r\nregional arrangements. In this context we would \r\nwelcome the establishment of a standing committee on \r\nregional organizations.  \r\n We in Kazakhstan are convinced that in the \r\ntwenty-first century the consolidation of peace and \r\nsecurity is increasingly dependent on the development \r\nof dialogue and interaction between peoples of \r\ndiffering faces, cultures and civilizations. An interfaith \r\ndialogue is an integral part of the effort to promote the \r\nculture of peace and dialogue between civilizations and \r\nto advance the common values reflected in the \r\nMillennium Declaration. In this context, Kazakhstan is \r\ngrateful to the international community for its support \r\nof our country’s actions to promote an interfaith \r\ndialogue. The General Assembly has recognized \r\nKazakhstan’s positive role in this area through the \r\nadoption of a resolution. \r\n As demonstrated over the past 60 years, the \r\nUnited Nations was, still is, and I am sure will continue \r\nto be a link between our countries and peoples. The \r\nUnited Nations will not allow our planet to slide into \r\nchaos and unrest. It is within our power to strengthen \r\nthis link. Kazakhstan expresses confidence that the \r\nagreements reflected in the outcome document of the \r\nhistoric summit will serve the cause of bringing nations \r\ntogether in the face of existing challenges and threats, \r\nensuring the security, welfare and dignity of our \r\nA/60/PV.11  \r\n \r\n18 05-51226 \r\n \r\npeoples, and strengthening the Organization itself for \r\nthe sake of its noble goals. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Borys Tarasyuk, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Ukraine. \r\n Mr. Tarasyuk (Ukraine): At the outset I wish to \r\nexpress my congratulations to you, Sir, on your \r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixtieth session. Rest assured that you have the full \r\nsupport and cooperation of the Ukrainian delegation. \r\nLet me also pay tribute to your predecessor, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Jean Ping, for his tireless efforts in the \r\npreparation of the world summit. \r\n The world summit of 2005 has just come to its \r\nconclusion. Its outcome document (resolution 60/1) \r\nprovides us with clear guidelines. It is our common \r\ntask to implement ambitious goals for building a safer \r\nand more prosperous world.  \r\n In talking about implementation I wish to \r\nemphasize two key elements indispensable for the \r\nfollow-up activities of the United Nations and, indeed, \r\nfor the success of the global peace endeavour. They are \r\ncredibility and democracy — or rather, credibility \r\nbased on democracy. We know that the way ahead is \r\nbeset with serious threats and challenges. We have to \r\nmake sure that a lack of unity is not among those \r\nchallenges. Every nation likes to sing its own song. It \r\ntakes our fundamental values and a great deal of \r\nhuman wisdom to perform the role of a tuning fork in \r\nthe global chorus of so many different voices. The \r\ncredibility of the United Nations is indispensable if we \r\nare to accomplish our missions in the new millennium. \r\nEffectiveness, capacity, rapid response, financing for \r\ndevelopment and all the rest of it will come along with \r\ncredibility. \r\n Security Council reform is a vivid example of \r\nhow difficult it is to accommodate the interests of 191 \r\nnations. That reminds me of a joke about the \r\ndistribution of committee posts in the Ukrainian \r\nParliament. They say that we should have 450 \r\ncommittees — that is the number of members of \r\nParliament — in order to make everyone feel happy \r\nand important. Unfortunately, we cannot afford to \r\napply a similar approach in the case of the Security \r\nCouncil, since its powers exceed by far those of any \r\nother United Nations body. The official position of \r\nUkraine on the matter is clearly reflected in the \r\nstatement made by President Yushchenko during the \r\nsummit (see A/60/PV.6). Ukraine highly appreciates \r\nthe job done by the experts who have explored the \r\nvarious options for Security Council reform. We must \r\nnot abandon hope and should continue to seek \r\nconsensus. \r\n Ukraine has fully supported the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s bold initiative to reform the Organization \r\nand has actively participated in that process. We \r\nreiterate our support for strengthening the position of \r\nthe Secretary-General. In view of the forthcoming \r\nelection for Secretary-General in 2006 we would like \r\nto remind representatives that throughout the 60-year \r\nhistory of the United Nations it is only representatives \r\nof our Eastern European regional group that have never \r\noccupied that highest of posts. Therefore, we believe \r\nthat the Eastern European Group has priority in \r\nnominating a candidate. \r\n In building this statement around the words \r\n“credibility” and “democracy”, I cannot but stress the \r\nkey function of the Organization, which is to maintain \r\ninternational peace and security. The memory of \r\nRwanda, Srebrenica or, quite recently, Darfur should \r\nlead us to look for urgent remedies. One of these could \r\nlie in the “responsibility to protect” concept, which \r\nUkraine fully endorses. We must not remain passive \r\nobservers of genocide, crimes against humanity or \r\ngross and flagrant violations of human rights, as \r\nhappened in 1932-1933 when Ukrainians experienced \r\nthe great famine with devastating effects. The horrible \r\nmemory of that man-made calamity lives on today in \r\nevery Ukrainian family, including my own. Twenty \r\nthousand innocent souls a day, half a million a month, \r\n10 million altogether were taken as part of the death \r\ntoll of Stalin’s favoured ethnic policy. The Ukrainian \r\nGovernment will never tire until it makes the \r\ninternational community abandon hypocrisy and finally \r\nrecognize that act of genocide against the Ukrainian \r\nnation. It was therefore in earnest and with much hope \r\nthat Ukraine followed the deliberations on the new \r\nconcept.  \r\n Early warning, prevention and rapid response are \r\nkey to ensuring the success and durability of our \r\nconcerted action. An expert combination of diplomatic, \r\npolitical and assistance tools should suffice to avert \r\nfuture humanitarian disasters. But should such \r\nmeasures fail to stop atrocities, the Security Council \r\nmust be ready to act swiftly and resolutely, including \r\nwith the use of force, as a final resort. I should like to \r\nreiterate the position of Ukraine that, apart from self-\r\n A/60/PV.11\r\n \r\n05-51226 19 \r\n \r\ndefence as provided for in Article 51 of the Charter, \r\nonly the Security Council may legitimately take \r\ndecisions on the use of force.  \r\n Peace and stability go hand in hand with human \r\nrights, the rule of law and freedom of the media. The \r\ncredibility of Governments rests on those fundamental \r\nvalues. We were all aware of malfunctions in the \r\nCommission on Human Rights. Poor mechanisms led \r\nto poor results. The credibility of the entire \r\nOrganization was at stake. Therefore, Ukraine \r\nwelcomes the establishment of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. We firmly believe that this important \r\nachievement of the Organization will be reflected in \r\nthe new Council’s future activities, not only in the \r\nchange of name. Likewise, Ukraine supports the \r\nestablishment of the United Nations Democracy Fund. \r\n Another matter of significance that should \r\nenhance the credibility of the United Nations is the \r\ncreation of the Peacebuilding Commission. It is evident \r\nthat conflict resolution always requires a complex \r\napproach. The institutional gap between prevention, \r\nsettlement and post-conflict rehabilitation has finally to \r\nbe eliminated. \r\n To save time at this late hour, I shall not mention \r\nmany areas of cooperation and many regions of the \r\nworld that genuinely require our undiminished \r\nattention and action. Non-proliferation; hot and frozen \r\nconflicts; AIDS; the fight against poverty; the Middle \r\nEast; and Iraq: most often these are issues of the \r\ndemocracy of governance or the credibility of policies, \r\nor both.  \r\n To conclude, let me recall the phenomenon of the \r\nOrange Revolution in my country, for it was the \r\nquintessence of what our Organization stands for. It \r\nwas not a one-time act. It is a process. It is not country-\r\nspecific, but is part of the global heritage of \r\ndemocracy, an unselfish gift to all nations striving for \r\nfreedom around the globe. \r\n The meeting rose at 12.15 p.m. \r\n"
