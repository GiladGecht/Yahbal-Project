(Sweden)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Pierre Nkurunziza, President of\r\nthe Republic of Burundi\r\nThe President: The Assembly will hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Burundi.\r\nMr. Pierre Nkurunziza, President of the Republic\r\nof Burundi, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Pierre Nkurunziza,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Burundi, and to invite him\r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Nkurunziza (spoke in French): It is a\r\ndistinct honour to address this Assembly on the\r\noccasion of the sixtieth regular session of the General\r\nAssembly of the United Nations, an important\r\nmilestone in the life of our Organization. We would\r\nlike to take this opportunity to express our warm\r\ncongratulations to His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan,\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, for the skill\r\nand dynamism he has displayed in leading our\r\nOrganization. We would also like to pay tribute to his\r\ndedication to the cause of peace and to the interest he\r\nhas always paid to the people of Burundi during their\r\ndifficult times. Allow us also at this memorable time to\r\nexpress our profound gratitude to the Security Council\r\nof the United Nations for the resolute will it has\r\ndisplayed in accompanying the people of Burundi step\r\nby step in their search for peace.\r\nOur country has just entered an essential phase in\r\nits history. In political terms, after more than ten years\r\nof war and a lengthy period of transition, the main\r\nprotagonists in the conflict have agreed to bury the\r\nhatchet. Free, pluralist, fair and transparent elections\r\nwere the culmination of this long process. Indeed, it\r\nwas at the end of a genuine electoral marathon,\r\ninvolving local, legislative, senatorial and presidential\r\nelections, that the people of Burundi overwhelmingly\r\nchose the programme and candidates of my party, the\r\nCNDD-FDD (Conseil National pour la Défense de la\r\nDémocratie, Forces pour la Défense de la Démocratie),\r\nin calm and in dignity. This was an indisputable and\r\nundisputed victory recognized and acknowledged by\r\nall of the many foreign observers. The political parties\r\nhave also accepted the verdict of the ballot boxes.\r\nIn order to enable every opportunity for national\r\nharmony and establish democracy once again, we have\r\njust set up a Government of broad national union\r\nconsisting of all the elements of the Burundi people,\r\nwith its political, social, ethnic and regional diversity, a\r\nGovernment where women hold the significant\r\nposition they deserve.\r\nWe are especially pleased to note the genuine\r\nsocial and mental change represented by the entry of\r\nBurundian women into the political sphere. Today,\r\nwomen hold 35 per cent of posts in the executive\r\nbranch. Their presence is notable in all State\r\ninstitutions. For the first time in my country’s history,\r\n2\r\nA/60/PV.13\r\nthe National Assembly is presided over by a woman\r\nand two women are vice-presidents of the Senate. At\r\nthe Government level, one of the two vice-presidencies\r\nof the Republic is held by a woman. Women head\r\nseven of the 20 ministries, including in such important\r\nposts as justice, foreign relations and planning. Lastly,\r\nmany women are working in provincial and communal\r\nadministrations.\r\nOur Government cherishes the hope that this\r\ncontribution of women’s talents to managing the affairs\r\nof State will help to strengthen democracy by giving it\r\na warmer, more thoughtful and peaceful image.\r\nWe are also pleased that the democratic spirit of\r\ncohesion and unity in diversity which has breathed new\r\nlife into the political scene is also being felt in the\r\ninstitutions of defence and security. Indeed, yesterday’s\r\nantagonists — the former Burundian armed forces and\r\nthe armed groups arrayed against them — have been\r\nmerged into new forces, known as the National\r\nDefence Force and the National Police of Burundi, in\r\nwhich all the country’s players are represented. That\r\nfact is rare enough to warrant highlighting.\r\nAll of those profound changes have been made\r\npossible by the synergy between the concern of the\r\ninternational community, the courage and maturity of\r\nthe Burundian people, and the willingness to\r\ncompromise of the political class. We express our\r\nwarmest thanks to all the international partners that\r\naccompanied us on our long road to peace. In\r\nparticular, we would single out the regional initiative,\r\nthe United Nations Operation in Burundi, mediators\r\nMwalimu Julius Nyerere and President Mandela,\r\nfacilitator Jacob Zuma, the European Union, the United\r\nStates of America, the African Union and many\r\nfriendly countries, especially those that contributed\r\ntroops to the peacekeeping force as well as financial\r\nlogistic means.\r\nPeace in our country, like the lasting success of\r\nour democratic experience, is closely linked to the\r\nstability of the regional environment. We therefore\r\nwelcome the efforts to restore peace, stability and\r\nsustainable development in the Great Lakes region. We\r\nare closely following and actively participating in the\r\npreparations for the International Conference on the\r\nGreat Lakes Region, now being organized under\r\nUnited Nations and African Union auspices, with the\r\nsupport of the region’s Group of Friends.\r\nWe are one with our world village. Nothing that\r\noccurs there does not touch us. Threats to peace and\r\nsecurity sneer at borders. We call today for an urgent\r\npartnership to combat terrorism. In that context, the\r\ngeneral convention on international terrorism, once\r\nconcluded, will be an innovative legal instrument in\r\naddressing issues that have yet to be regulated.\r\nWe also need to stem the phenomenon of drug\r\ntrafficking, which — with its many corollaries,\r\nincluding child labour, the sex industry and illegal\r\nmigration — is transforming human beings into\r\ntwenty-first century commodities.\r\nCombating terrorism must include promoting a\r\nculture of peace. It would thus be useful to use the\r\nInternational Decade for the Culture of Peace to build\r\nthe defences of peace in the minds of men and women,\r\nparticularly through education, the media, faith-based\r\norganizations and cultural programmes aimed at\r\nchildren.\r\nTerrorism is also a denial of human rights. We\r\ntherefore welcome the decision to create the human\r\nrights council to promote respect for those rights. The\r\ncouncil will allow us to end the partisan bickering\r\nprevalent in the Commission on Human Rights.\r\nAs to the reform of the Security Council and\r\nother United Nations organs, our Government supports\r\nthe position of the African Union.\r\nWith respect to good governance, our\r\nGovernment is committed to taking appropriate\r\nmeasures to establish good governance in all its\r\naspects. We refer in particular to capacity-building, the\r\nmobilization of domestic resources and the\r\nimplementation of strategies to combat corruption,\r\nfraud and embezzlement. We will soon be unveiling a\r\nnew law and anti-corruption squad.\r\nWe are committed to fighting impunity, for we\r\nwant to strive for impartial justice, not only by\r\nbuilding our capacities in that sphere, but also by\r\nreforming the sectors involved in that issue. In that\r\ncontext, we request in particular the international\r\ncommunity’s assistance in the urgent establishment of\r\na truth and reconciliation commission.\r\nIn the socio-economic field, we hope that the\r\nestablishment of new elected, democratic institutions\r\nwill lay the groundwork for robust legitimacy and\r\neffectiveness in our reconstruction and socio-economic\r\ndevelopment strategies. We wish to prioritize the\r\n3\r\nA/60/PV.13\r\nrehabilitation of social and economic infrastructure\r\ndestroyed during the war and the reintegration of\r\nexpatriates, internally displaced persons, demobilized\r\nsoldiers and war victims.\r\nWe also intend to attach high priority to\r\neducation. Thus, when we came to power, we decided\r\nto provide free primary schooling to all children by the\r\nbeginning of the 2005-2006 school year. That priority\r\ngoal for education requires the development and\r\nimplementation of ambitious and urgent programmes to\r\ntrain qualified teachers, rebuild schools and obtain new\r\neducational materials.\r\nFor the period 2006-2008, we are planning for the\r\nconstruction of at least one primary school for each\r\ncensus area, totalling some 350 primary schools. That\r\nwill involve the construction of 800 classrooms in\r\n2006, the recruitment of 2,000 new teachers and the\r\nacquisition of teaching materials at an estimated cost of\r\n$15 million. In that same context, we will prioritize\r\nprofessional training, particularly in the agricultural,\r\nparamedical, technical and trade fields, in order to\r\nhasten the country’s reconstruction. By 2008, we\r\nexpect to build in each province a technical secondary\r\nschool with several departments and a capacity of at\r\nleast 1,000 pupils.\r\nIncreased financial resources will be necessary\r\nand we know that we can count on the assistance of the\r\ninternational community. In that regard, we support the\r\ninnovative proposal of the French Government to find\r\nnew sources of development financing by imposing a\r\nlevy on air tickets.\r\nMuch remains to be done in the area of health.\r\nOur Government has undertaken to develop a policy to\r\nmake significant improvements in universal access to\r\nhealth care, and to implement the national strategic\r\nplan to combat HIV/AIDS, an essential component of\r\nwhich is capacity-building in HIV/AIDS prevention\r\nand treatment.\r\nThe achievements of my country, particularly in\r\nthe political and security fields, are important steps in\r\nthe right direction. Nevertheless, they are only the start\r\nof a process that must be consolidated.\r\nIn particular, we will have to resume activities to\r\ncombat poverty and re-establish economic growth, two\r\nessential measures that will allow our people to reap\r\nthe dividends of peace.\r\nThe support of the entire population for the peace\r\nprocess and the programme for economic growth is\r\nessential. But how can the people feel that the new\r\npolicy includes them if their living conditions are not\r\nrapidly improved? That is why the support of the\r\ninternational community in this difficult period is of\r\nsupreme importance. We make an urgent appeal to the\r\ninternational community to ensure that the level and\r\nquality of their commitments will respond to the\r\ninsistent expectations of our population and to the new\r\ndemocratic changes.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of\r\nthe Republic of Burundi for the statement he has just\r\nmade.\r\nMr. Pierre Nkurunziza, President of the Republic\r\nof Burundi, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Marc Ravalomanana, President\r\nof the Republic of Madagascar\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of\r\nMadagascar.\r\nMr. Marc Ravalomanana, President of the\r\nRepublic of Madagascar, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations the President of the Republic of Madagascar,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Marc Ravalomanana, and to invite\r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Ravalomanana (spoke in French): No\r\none here took part in the first General Assembly in\r\n1945. We can only imagine how at the end of the\r\nSecond World War men and women full of hope were\r\nprompted by a firm resolve to change and make the\r\nworld better. They were right. The shortcomings and\r\nweaknesses of our Organization should not in any way\r\ndetract from the leading role of the United Nations in\r\nthe world.\r\nDo we today share the same spirit that inspired\r\nour predecessors? At the end of this General Assembly\r\nwill we feel that we have improved the world?\r\nWe welcome the draft outcome document. We\r\nalso welcome recent resolutions adopted by the\r\n4\r\nA/60/PV.13\r\nSecurity Council on counter-terrorism and conflict\r\nprevention, particularly in Africa. We support the early\r\nestablishment of a human rights council so as to\r\npromote democracy.\r\nHowever, the results of the summit meeting do\r\nnot fully correspond with Africa’s aspirations. What is\r\nlacking is that long-hoped-for impetus that would\r\nenable every Member State to express its views, give\r\nhope to our peoples, preserve the balance of nature and\r\nenable us to ensure the futures of all the world’s\r\nchildren. We need to further strengthen our efforts by\r\ntrying fresh approaches.\r\nFirst of all, it is high time to strengthen the role\r\nof the General Assembly. It is also time for Africa to\r\nbe better represented within United Nations bodies,\r\nand in particular on the Security Council. That is a\r\nmatter of justice, but it is also a necessity for the\r\ndevelopment of our continent. Having Africa’s voice\r\nheard on the international level and allowing it to share\r\nin responsibilities on a global level are marks of\r\nconcern and respect for our States and our peoples. Let\r\nus put an end to the exclusion of the African continent.\r\nWe want to make our full and complete contribution to\r\ndebates and decision-making on issues that concern\r\nhow our world works.\r\nThe discussions in recent months have focused on\r\ninstitutional reform at the United Nations. That is a\r\nvery important question. It is also important for Africa.\r\nBut we would ask you to expand the discussion so as to\r\nproperly define the role that the Organization should\r\nplay in world development. The United Nations should\r\nbe more than just a crisis management body — a body\r\nthat addresses poverty, disasters and emergencies. Let\r\nus convert it into a body that inspires us with hope. Let\r\nus work together for development, justice and equity.\r\nThe sixtieth anniversary of the United Nations\r\nshould mark the beginning of a new era in which we\r\nwill have the opportunity to build a more prosperous,\r\nmore just, more democratic and more environmentally\r\naware world — a world that is sounder, healthier, more\r\nresponsible and more united.\r\nWe need to work out strategies and plans that\r\narouse enthusiasm among nations and attract the\r\nfervent hopes of our peoples. We will only change the\r\nworld if we can secure the support of our populations.\r\nThe United Nations must devise and adopt the\r\nnecessary measures to establish a more balanced world.\r\nAll the crises, the wars, the questions of security and\r\nterrorism, the world’s epidemics — all of those have\r\nconcrete causes.\r\nThe Secretary-General rightly quoted one of the\r\nUnited Nations purposes from the preamble to the\r\nCharter: “to promote social progress and better\r\nstandards of life in larger freedom”. Our peoples want\r\nto have real opportunities. Quite rightly, they call for\r\nthe favourable conditions that will allow them to take\r\nadvantage of those opportunities.\r\nOur Organization is 60 years old. Much has been\r\nachieved in decolonization and peacekeeping, for\r\ninstance. Five years ago we defined the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. Now we must go still further. Let\r\nus devise a genuine global strategy for development, a\r\nstrategic partnership with a clear-cut vision and more\r\nambitious goals.\r\nAs regards Africa, what is lacking is a clear\r\nvision of its future. It can be seen that Africa is still a\r\npoor continent. Nonetheless, Africa has the potential to\r\nbe rich. The previous General Assembly provided me\r\nwith an opportunity to propose a “Marshall Plan for\r\nAfrica”. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom\r\nmade the same proposal and the President of the World\r\nBank, Mr. Paul Wolfowitz, has also spoken of a plan of\r\naction for Africa. Let us ask other donors to join in this\r\ninitiative.\r\nThe Marshall Plan for Africa should cover much\r\nmore than a call to cancel debt and increase financial\r\nsupport. It should take into account Africa’s potential\r\nand the right steps that are needed to realize it. It\r\nshould build a positive image of our continent and\r\ndetermine the role that it could play in economic,\r\npolitical, social and cultural spheres.\r\nGlobalization highlights the economic dimension\r\nof international relations. However, we need to invest\r\nmore in the social dimension of development by\r\nenhancing the role of the Economic and Social Council\r\nso as to meet the legitimate aspirations of our peoples.\r\nThe future of Africa lies, of course, with its\r\nchildren. The plan for Africa should describe how we\r\ncan approve the transfer of knowledge and how we can\r\nensure access for young Africans to the world’s\r\nknowledge and expertise, so that the intellectual\r\npotential of millions of people will not be wasted.\r\nWe need to increase literacy levels. We also need\r\nan educational system that meets international\r\n5\r\nA/60/PV.13\r\nstandards of quality and effectiveness — a system that\r\nwill foster creativity and help our peoples to realize\r\ntheir dreams; a system that will optimize our countries’\r\nhuman resources so as to enable us to play an\r\nimportant role in the world economy; a system which\r\nwill help to close the digital divide among nations.\r\nSaving African children also means feeding them.\r\nIn that respect, overcoming hunger in Africa is an\r\nurgent challenge, as millions of people will be affected\r\nby this crisis.\r\nMadagascar, as a new member of the Southern\r\nAfrican Development Community, urges the General\r\nAssembly to make that crisis its highest priority. We\r\nmust act rapidly and with resolve.\r\nLet us also improve the situation of women. They\r\ndeserve to play a more significant role in civil society\r\nand in the economic and political arena.\r\nI have personally been asked by the Water,\r\nSanitation and Hygiene (WASH) project to share their\r\nconcerns with you. Indeed, one of the most\r\nburdensome daily chores of African women is\r\nproviding a family with water. Access to drinking\r\nwater for all frees women from servitude and thus\r\npreserves their dignity. Moreover, the issue of water\r\nmanagement is inseparable from those of sanitation\r\nand hygiene. Water is a source of life and a great\r\neconomic asset. The development of hydroelectric\r\nenergy is one solution to Africa’s energy deficit. Let us\r\nnot forget that rational water management will enable\r\nus to achieve food self-sufficiency.\r\nSuch a Marshall Plan should include the\r\nprotection and development of natural resources, which\r\nare crucial to our continent. To that end, we have a\r\nvision, which we call “Madagascar, naturally”.\r\nTwo years ago in Durban, I announced our\r\ndecision to triple the extent of protected areas in the\r\ncountry so as to ensure the preservation of our rich and\r\nunique biodiversity. We took the decision to earmark 8\r\nper cent of funds stemming from the cancellation of\r\nexternal debt for the funding of our protected-area\r\nsystem.\r\nThe African continent already is involved in the\r\npreservation of natural resources for the world and will\r\nincrease its efforts in that area.\r\nLet us focus on agribusiness by creating more\r\nopportunities for processing our natural products and\r\nthus enhancing the value-added that they bring to our\r\ncountries. This is the approach that Madagascar is\r\ntaking now, with the support of donors. Let us foster\r\ninitiatives to establish a fair and equitable trading\r\nregime among nations, such as the reduction of trade\r\nbarriers.\r\nIn short, such a Marshall Plan should make it\r\nclear that the African continent can prosper by\r\nshouldering its responsibilities. We need to speak more\r\nof our assets than of our weaknesses. We need to speak\r\nof our potential rather than our lack of resources. The\r\nworld wants to invest in our potential. Let us find a\r\nfresh approach. Let us create a new image, a new, clear\r\nvision for Africa. It is only through such a vision,\r\nalong with a genuine global strategy for development,\r\nthat the Millennium Development Goals can be\r\nachieved.\r\nSuch an approach must incorporate the various\r\ninternational and bilateral programmes and projects\r\nwhose differing structures, objectives and content\r\nmake them complicated to manage and hinder the\r\nidentification of possible synergies. But it is incumbent\r\non us to ensure the effective coordination of\r\ndevelopment and thus adopt the concept of country\r\nownership. We in Madagascar have taken the initiative\r\nof setting up national programmes in which all donors’\r\nprojects are incorporated.\r\nThe world must heed the needs of Africa, but\r\nAfrica must also face up to its responsibilities by\r\nstrengthening democracy, good governance and the\r\nrule of law.\r\nThe discussions on the role and the structure of\r\nthe United Nations which have taken place in the\r\ncontext of the sixtieth anniversary offer us an\r\nexceptional opportunity. Let us create more equitable\r\nstructures that are better suited to today’s needs and\r\nrealities. Let us draw inspiration from the spirit of the\r\nfounding fathers of our Organization.\r\nLet us be nations united in spirit, with a global\r\nvision and strategy of development for a world that is\r\nnot only more dynamic but also more balanced, more\r\nequitable and more responsible. Let us work towards\r\nthat end.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of\r\nthe Republic of Madagascar for the statement he has\r\njust made.\r\n6\r\nA/60/PV.13\r\nMr. Marc Ravalomanana, President of the\r\nRepublic of Madagascar, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Emile Lahoud, President of the\r\nLebanese Republic\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Lebanese Republic.\r\nMr. Emile Lahoud, President of the Lebanese\r\nRepublic, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Emile Lahoud, President\r\nof the Lebanese Republic, and to invite him to address\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Lahoud: Mr. President, first of all, I\r\nwould like to congratulate you on your election as\r\nPresident of this session of the General Assembly and\r\nto thank your predecessor, Mr. Ping, for all his efforts\r\nduring his tenure. I would like also to thank the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for all his\r\nendeavours in seeking the preservation of this great\r\ninstitution’s integrity as well as world peace.\r\nThis year’s session of the General Assembly\r\ncomes days after a landmark meeting of world leaders\r\nat which they adopted a blueprint that aims to increase\r\nthe efficiency of the United Nations in the prosecution\r\nof human rights abuses and in the preservation of\r\nworld peace and security. Moreover, that instrument\r\ncalls on all to move forward with a much-needed,\r\ncomprehensive programme of reforms at the United\r\nNations, including in the Security Council.\r\nThis clearly demonstrates our faith in the primacy\r\nof the role of the United Nations in the preservation of\r\nworld peace, as the embodiment of our collective\r\ndesire and will, and as the legitimate body for crisis\r\nresolution within the framework of every individual\r\nState’s sovereignty.\r\nTruly, the only way out of this dangerous impasse\r\nis a return to a multipolar world order, based on the\r\nrule of international law and justice and on respect for\r\nevery nation’s sovereignty. Moreover, such a wise\r\napproach should be complemented by serious and\r\nconcerted efforts to fight poverty and oppression and,\r\nconsequently, the root causes of terror.\r\nThe core values of a democratic and just world\r\nare best served by enhancing the capabilities of the\r\nUnited Nations and its instruments, and by reinforcing\r\nin-house democratic values. This institution should\r\nremain the primary defender of such human values as\r\nfreedom, justice and peace.\r\nThe advances in telecommunications and\r\ninformation technologies, signature traits of\r\nglobalization, have led to a withering of geographical\r\nboundaries, along with a strengthening of multinational\r\ncorporations, and hence the need for a new approach to\r\ntackling our world’s problems in international\r\nrelations. The “crumbs” from the rich nations have\r\nbecome insufficient to satisfy the needs of a third\r\nworld seeking to extract itself from backwardness and\r\nto eradicate poverty and disease. Those ailments have\r\nspread beyond the boundaries of the great development\r\ndivide and serve as a stern wake-up call and a ticking\r\nbomb for us all to heed.\r\nThat is why it is imperative to call for a serious\r\nand urgent dialogue between North and South, for\r\nrapid and eased transfer of technological advances and\r\ncapital, and for bolstering the development of those\r\nnations that seek modernity. Moreover, it is crucial to\r\nencourage interaction and cooperation between\r\ndeveloping States through such forums as the summit\r\nthat was held in Brasilia last May, where Arab nations\r\nmet the nations of South America. Lebanon looks\r\nforward to the follow-up meetings of the Brasilia\r\nsummit, considering the importance of cooperation\r\nbetween those two important geographic blocs.\r\nAt this juncture, it is logical to ask whether\r\nextremism, terrorism and wanton violence against\r\ninnocent civilians are the by-products of the\r\nenvironment of seclusion and deprivation. In view of\r\nthe rapid spread of terrorism, we feel that the approach\r\nto countering the plague of terrorism remains\r\nsuperficial and unable to tackle the root causes of the\r\nplague.\r\nHaving suffered the awful consequences of that\r\nplague, Lebanon was always a bellwether in\r\ncondemning all terrorist acts around the world. That is\r\nbecause few nations have so endured and continue to\r\nendure the consequences of that evil. That is why we\r\nknow that an effective anti-terror campaign requires an\r\nenvironment of constructive cooperation worldwide,\r\nremote from politically motivated campaigns of\r\nvilification, and as a platform for a clear definition of\r\n7\r\nA/60/PV.13\r\nterrorism, remote from the wilful or unintended\r\nconflation of the inalienable right of people to fight\r\noccupation and acts of wanton terror.\r\nTherefore, and in order to conclusively win the\r\nwar on terror, the security approach should be\r\ncomplemented by mid- and long-term approaches\r\naimed at resolving political crises in order to deprive\r\nthe terrorists of all legitimacy. That is why tackling the\r\nproblems of oppression and occupation, along with\r\nbolstering development, education and the attainment\r\nof a better life, will surely lead to shrinking the human\r\npool that feeds extremism.\r\nFor decades now, the Middle East has witnessed\r\nconflicts and unresolved disputes and, as a\r\nconsequence, has been subject to the festering wounds\r\nof terrorism. Needless to say, the core of the problem\r\nremains the fact that Arab lands are still under\r\noccupation in spite of the many resolutions of\r\ninternational legitimacy, many adopted in this very\r\nedifice, calling for an end to occupation.\r\nThe immediate implementation of those\r\nresolutions, as well as General Assembly resolution\r\n194 (III) — which affirms the right of return of the\r\nPalestinian refugees to their lands confiscated by Israel\r\nand bars the resettlement of the uprooted Palestinians\r\nin their host countries — remains the only way to\r\ndefuse and to dry up the wells of extremism. That will\r\npave the way to a comprehensive, just and peaceful\r\nsettlement in our region, as foreseen in the 1991\r\nMadrid peace summit and the implementation of the\r\nland-for-peace principle.\r\nThose principles of peace were confirmed as a\r\nstrategic choice by all Arab leaders during the Beirut\r\nArab summit of 2002. Sadly, the initiative has yet to be\r\nseized upon to resolve regional conflicts and to achieve\r\na final and peaceful settlement in the Middle East.\r\nAwaiting the historic resolution of the conflict,\r\nLebanon commends the United Nations Relief and\r\nWorks Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East\r\nfor all that it does, and calls upon the international\r\ncommunity to bolster its capabilities in order to\r\nalleviate the hardships of the Palestinian refugees in\r\ntheir places of “temporary” residence.\r\nThe daily Israeli violations of Lebanon’s\r\nterritorial integrity and aggressions against the people\r\nof South Lebanon have made that important part of my\r\ncountry yet another point of tension in the Middle East.\r\nIsrael’s violation of the Blue Line and its continuing\r\noccupation of parts of my country, along with the\r\nimprisonment of scores of our citizens without any\r\nrecourse to due process, are in clear violation of\r\ninternational law, to say nothing of the lethal hardships\r\nfaced by our citizens in the freed areas of South\r\nLebanon due to the thousands of land mines planted by\r\nIsrael during its two-decade occupation of South\r\nLebanon.\r\nMy country continues to adhere to a\r\ncomprehensive and just peace settlement, to the\r\nprinciple of non-aggression, and to respect for human\r\nrights, and yearns for the implementation of all\r\ninternational resolutions towards those ends. In the\r\nmeantime, we cannot but value the role played by the\r\nUnited Nations in South Lebanon through the United\r\nNations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) — a role\r\nthat has been extended to and benefited Lebanon for\r\nalmost three decades. Our clinging to the UNIFIL\r\npresence emanates from our commitment to peace and\r\nsecurity, pending a final resolution of the conflicts in\r\nthe region.\r\nHere, I would like to avail myself of the\r\nopportunity to salute the UNIFIL forces active in South\r\nLebanon, to thank them for their sacrifices, and to bow\r\nin memory of the fallen peacekeepers.\r\nLebanon has long endured Israel’s wars and\r\noccupation, despite a Security Council resolution\r\ncalling for the immediate cessation of the occupation.\r\nAlas, Israel ignored that resolution for over two\r\ndecades. That gave birth to a staunchly national\r\nmovement of resistance and defence of Lebanon’s\r\nterritorial integrity, as guaranteed by the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations under the right to fight occupation.\r\nDespite the persistence of all the aforementioned\r\nconditions of occupation, violations and aggressions,\r\nand due to Lebanon’s adherence to all resolutions of\r\ninternational legitimacy — an adherence based on a\r\nclear understanding of the world community’s\r\ndemands — the Government of Lebanon launched an\r\ninternal dialogue between all Lebanese groups in order\r\nto maintain our unity, security and stability, and to\r\nreinforce our internal and international positions. We\r\nlook forward to maintaining that rapport with the world\r\ncommunity in order to achieve those noble goals.\r\nSince the historic reconciliation at Taef, Lebanon\r\nhas enjoyed over a decade of stability and tranquillity,\r\nquickly recapturing its regional pre-eminence and its\r\n8\r\nA/60/PV.13\r\npioneering role as a land of religious tolerance — an\r\nexample to follow in the dialogue of civilizations.\r\nMoreover, Lebanon has enjoyed an unprecedented\r\nlevel of economic revitalization and has been able to\r\nforge iron-clad unity in its armed forces and civil\r\ninstitutions.\r\nHowever, Lebanon has recently gone through\r\nsome horrific and fateful events, one of which — the\r\nassassination of Prime Minister Rafik Hariri —\r\nconstitutes the hardest blow in its modern history. That\r\nassassination caused great grief for our nation, and the\r\nrepercussions were felt throughout the world. We look\r\nforward to the timely and prompt disclosure of the\r\nInternational Inquiry Commission’s results of the\r\ninvestigation into that heinous act, and we thank the\r\nSecurity Council for consenting to Lebanon’s request\r\nto appoint such a Commission.\r\nMoreover, Lebanon appreciates the great efforts\r\nundertaken by the Inquiry Commission in its search for\r\nthe truth, and will afford the Commission all the\r\nsupport that it needs in order for us to prosecute the\r\nculprits to the full extent of the law. That underlines\r\nthe commitment of Lebanon and of the world\r\ncommunity in the fight against terrorism.\r\nDespite the abominable assassination of Prime\r\nMinister Rafik Hariri and the ensuing national malaise,\r\nwe were able to conduct exemplary parliamentary\r\nelections, which have been heralded by most observers\r\nas yet another landmark in the democratic history of\r\nLebanon.\r\nUnited Nations and international monitoring\r\nofficials testified that those elections were held in\r\naccordance with the highest standards. Consequently, a\r\nGovernment of national unity has been formed, which\r\nhas taken upon itself the task of immediately tackling\r\nLebanon’s internal and external affairs, within the\r\nframework of a serious dialogue aimed at achieving a\r\nnational consensus and the preservation of what we all\r\ndesire, namely, Lebanon’s stability and national unity.\r\nThe new Lebanese Government is determined to\r\nundertake a comprehensive plan of reform that will\r\nencompass all political, administrative and economic\r\naspects, and as a first step it has established a much-\r\nneeded consultative national body to formulate a new\r\nelectoral law that will live up to the recommendations\r\nof the European Union’s delegated commission.\r\nMoreover, the Lebanese Government looks\r\nforward to the valuable support of the United Nations,\r\nand conveys the gratitude of the people of Lebanon.\r\nFinally, we commend the precise follow-up provided\r\nby the World Bank and the International Monetary\r\nFund for the rebuilding of a solid national economy.\r\nFrom this rostrum, we set forth Lebanon’s\r\nstruggle for freedom, justice and the rule of law. It has\r\nbeen Lebanon’s fate to walk this path in a region of\r\nfestering, decades-long conflicts and disputes. As such,\r\nit has ended up paying an exorbitant price in wars,\r\noccupations and assassinations. But Lebanon has been\r\nrelentless in its devotion to what is good and right, and\r\nhas always been able to defeat the forces of sedition\r\nand destruction.\r\nToday, we owe our moment of triumph to our\r\nperseverance and to the international community’s\r\ncommitment to Lebanon. We ask that you take our\r\nhand, once again, as we cross the threshold from fear\r\nand war to hope and peace.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the\r\nLebanese Republic for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Emile Lahoud, President of the Lebanese\r\nRepublic, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nItem 9 of the provisional agenda (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by The Honourable Navinchandra\r\nRamgoolam, Prime Minister of the Republic of\r\nMauritius\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Prime Minister of the Republic of\r\nMauritius.\r\nThe Honourable Navinchandra Ramgoolam,\r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Mauritius, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Excellency The Honourable\r\nNavinchandra Ramgoolam, Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Mauritius, and inviting him to address the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\n9\r\nA/60/PV.13\r\nMr. Ramgoolam (Mauritius): I should like, on\r\nbehalf of my delegation and of the Government and the\r\npeople of the Republic of Mauritius, to congratulate\r\nyou, Sir, on your election as President of the General\r\nAssembly at its sixtieth session. We are confident that\r\nyou will be able to discharge the responsibilities\r\nentrusted to you. I want to assure you, as I did during\r\nour meeting this morning, of my delegation’s fullest\r\ncooperation during your tenure of office.\r\nI would also like to convey my delegation’s\r\ngratitude and appreciation to Mr. Jean Ping of Gabon\r\nfor the outstanding manner in which he conducted the\r\naffairs of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth\r\nsession. As Africans, we are proud of his exemplary\r\nstewardship.\r\nMy delegation also wishes to express its\r\nappreciation for the tireless and dedicated efforts of the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, in leading the\r\nOrganization in these challenging times.\r\nThe very first words of the United Nations\r\nCharter — “We the peoples of the United Nations” —\r\nare of overwhelming significance. They imply that\r\npeople should be the primary beneficiaries of every\r\nresolution that we adopt and every programme that we\r\nlaunch. As we engage in this debate, we should ask\r\nourselves whether we have, indeed, put the peoples at\r\nthe centre of all of our deliberations and activities.\r\nHave we done enough to ensure that ordinary people,\r\nmen and women, young and old, benefit from all our\r\ninitiatives and actions, collective as well as individual?\r\nLast Friday, by adopting the outcome document,\r\nleaders of the world renewed their pledge to save\r\nhumanity from the scourge of war, fear, disease, famine\r\nand poverty. The citizens of the world were witness to\r\nthe sober promises we made in it. They now wait, in\r\nearnest, to see concrete results. We are therefore\r\nrequired to muster the collective political will to\r\nmobilize the necessary resources to fulfil those\r\npledges.\r\nThe wealthy and powerful North should assist the\r\nless fortunate countries, which require assistance to\r\nhelp propel them into the orbit of irreversible\r\nsustainable social and economic growth. For its part,\r\nthe South must devote energy and show creativity as it\r\nengages in a common effort to attain social\r\ndevelopment and human security.\r\nThe spirit of teamwork and partnership which\r\nresulted in the successful outcome of the United\r\nNations world summit should allow us to adopt a fresh\r\nmindset that places the interests, security and welfare\r\nof our peoples at the centre of our socio-economic\r\npolicies. That cannot be done without promoting\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms.\r\nIn our efforts to pursue people-centred\r\ndevelopment, we must put a premium on tackling those\r\nnational and transnational issues that have a direct\r\nimpact on people’s welfare. Lifting peoples out of\r\nabject poverty and endowing them with appropriate\r\nmeans to lead productive lives is the best guarantee for\r\nlong-term sustained social stability, which, in turn, will\r\nensure prosperity and international peace. Poverty\r\nreduction and eradication must therefore remain at the\r\ncore of all development efforts towards a just and\r\nequitable order.\r\nIn keeping with our democratic tradition, just\r\nthree months ago, the people of my country voted,\r\noverwhelmingly, for a change of Government.\r\nImmediately upon assuming office, my Government\r\nhas formulated development strategies based on the\r\npremise that economic and social policies must\r\nsubserve the primacy of the people, in particular the\r\npoor. In fact, the fundamental principle of my\r\nGovernment’s policy is putting the people first. My\r\nGovernment believes that the fullest possible\r\nparticipation of the people in the development process\r\nis the best guarantee for the success of any growth\r\nstrategy.\r\nThe first set of social decisions taken by my\r\nGovernment, with that in mind, has been to expand the\r\nwelfare State to cover free transportation for students\r\nand the elderly as well as to restore old-age pensions\r\nfor all citizens. My Government\u0027s overriding objective\r\nis ultimately to make the economy work for the people,\r\nnot to make the people work for the economy.\r\nMy delegation believes that assisting developing\r\ncountries through increased official development\r\nassistance (ODA) is crucial; but it is only a palliative,\r\nnot a remedy. Aid without trade would be not only\r\nunsustainable but, indeed, self-defeating. Trade is, and\r\nwill always remain, the recognized engine of economic\r\ngrowth and development. Developing countries\r\ncontinue to face impediments in their efforts to attain\r\nsustained economic growth. Tariff and non-tariff\r\nbarriers in developed countries, combined with the\r\n10\r\nA/60/PV.13\r\nnon-implementation of commitments undertaken with\r\nrespect to development financing and debt alleviation\r\nfor developing countries, further aggravate the\r\nsituation. We call on the international community to\r\ndemonstrate the political will necessary to ensure that\r\nthe Doha development round truly takes into account\r\nthose concerns so as to achieve a fair and equitable\r\nglobal trading system for the benefits of our people.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the particular attention\r\ngiven by the world summit to the special needs of\r\nAfrica. While many countries throughout the world\r\nhave made significant progress in lifting their people\r\nout of poverty, for many others — mainly in\r\nsub-Saharan Africa — poverty, hunger, illiteracy,\r\ninfectious diseases and the incidence of HIV/AIDS,\r\nunemployment and environmental degradation\r\ncontinue to take a heavy toll. My delegation therefore\r\nappreciates the resolve of the international community\r\nto address those issues and emphasizes the need for\r\ntimely implementation of the relevant measures.\r\nDespite significant efforts that have resulted in\r\npeace in several parts of Africa, the continent\r\ncontinues to suffer from violent conflicts and\r\nhumanitarian crises. The plight of displaced people —\r\nespecially women and children — in those conflict\r\nsituations and in refugee camps needs to be urgently\r\naddressed. My delegation wishes to underscore the\r\nimportance of enhanced measures to protect vulnerable\r\ngroups, especially women and children, during and\r\nafter armed conflicts.\r\nIn our own region, Mauritius continues to remain\r\nactively engaged in the reconciliation process in the\r\nComoros. We are presently coordinating the\r\npreparations to host a donor round table for the\r\nComoros later this year. The importance of the meeting\r\ncannot be overstated. We urge the donor community to\r\ncontribute to this process for the benefit of the people\r\nof the Comoros.\r\nThe situation in the Middle East is seeing some\r\ntangible progress. We welcome the process of Israeli\r\ndisengagement from Gaza and the northern West Bank,\r\nand we commend the efforts of the President of the\r\nPalestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, to find a\r\npeaceful and lasting solution to the conflict. We urge\r\nboth the Israeli and the Palestinian peoples to continue\r\nthe much-needed confidence-building measures so as\r\nto achieve a just and lasting peace.\r\nWith regard to Iraq, where innocent civilians are\r\nfalling victim to violence on a daily basis, it is\r\nimperative that necessary support be provided to\r\nensure the creation of an environment in which the\r\nIraqi people can live in peace and security.\r\nI spoke extensively on terrorism in the statement\r\nI made on 15 September 2005 during the High-level\r\nPlenary Meeting. I wish to reaffirm my country\u0027s\r\ncommitment to fully cooperate with the international\r\ncommunity to fight the scourge of terrorism, which has\r\na direct and indirect effect on the lives of ordinary and\r\ninnocent people.\r\nAt a time when there is a global consensus\r\nregarding the need to build a more secure world, it is a\r\nmatter of the greatest regret that the 2005 Review\r\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons failed to\r\nachieve a conclusive outcome. The proliferation of\r\nnuclear weapons poses a grave risk of fissile material\r\nfalling into the wrong hands. That eventuality is too\r\nhorrendous to contemplate. The devastation that could\r\nbe caused by so-called low-yield nuclear weapons is\r\nunimaginable.\r\nMauritius advocates the eventual complete\r\nelimination of all nuclear weapons on the basis of a\r\ncomprehensive and non-discriminatory disarmament\r\nregime. To demonstrate once again its full commitment\r\nto non-proliferation and to international peace and\r\nsecurity, Mauritius recently signed the Additional\r\nProtocol of the International Atomic Energy Agency.\r\nMauritius welcomes the agreement reached in\r\nJune 2005 in New York on a politically binding\r\ninternational instrument on the tracing of small arms\r\nand light weapons, which will no doubt assist in\r\ncombating the illicit trade in such weapons. That\r\nrepresents a significant step in ensuring that our\r\npeoples live in a safer world.\r\nAs regards reform of the Security Council, I wish\r\nto refer to my statement on 15 September 2005\r\noutlining the position of Mauritius on that issue. We\r\nhave a unique opportunity for substantial reform; it\r\nmust not be squandered. It is imperative that Africa\r\nand India, the world\u0027s largest democracies, should find\r\ntheir rightful place in such reform. A reformed Security\r\nCouncil should reflect the present geopolitical realities\r\nto meet the aspirations of all our peoples.\r\n11\r\nA/60/PV.13\r\nThe United Nations is a vital forum in which\r\nStates, large and small, wealthy and less fortunate, can\r\nhave their voices heard. It also provides a framework\r\nfor collective action on the basis of consensus\r\npartnership and mutual understanding. I wish to\r\nreiterate the appeal I made, as Chair of the Alliance of\r\nSmall Island States, to our friends and partners at the\r\nspecial session on financing for development to\r\ncontinue to assist the small island developing States in\r\ntheir sustainable development efforts through the\r\nproper and effective implementation of the Mauritius\r\nStrategy.\r\nRegional cooperation is an important means for\r\ndeveloping and strengthening the economies of\r\ndeveloping countries. To that end, we have made\r\nmodest but encouraging progress with respect to\r\nregional integration. Mauritius pursues an active policy\r\nof integration through subregional organizations such\r\nas the Southern African Development Community, the\r\nCommon Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, the\r\nIndian Ocean Commission and the Indian Ocean Rim-\r\nAssociation for Regional Cooperation. While relations\r\nwith our traditional development and trade partners\r\ncontinue to feature prominently in the foreign policy of\r\nMauritius, we intend to take vigorous steps towards the\r\ndevelopment of strategic partnerships with member\r\nStates of the South Asian Association for Regional\r\nCooperation and of the Association of Southeast Asian\r\nNations, as well as with Latin American countries.\r\nAllow me to reiterate before the Assembly our\r\nlegitimate sovereignty claim over the Chagos\r\nArchipelago, including the island of Diego Garcia,\r\nwhich was detached by the United Kingdom from the\r\nterritory of Mauritius prior to our independence, in\r\nviolation of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) of\r\n1960 and resolution 2066 (XX)  of 1965. The people of\r\nthe Chagos Archipelago, who were evicted from the\r\nislands, are still struggling for their right to return to\r\ntheir birthplace. We reiterate our call to the United\r\nKingdom to pursue discussions with us for an early\r\nsettlement of this issue. Likewise, we  appeal to the\r\nFrench Government to expedite the process of\r\nresolving the issue of the sovereignty of Tromelin\r\nthrough dialogue in the spirit of friendship and trust\r\nthat has always characterized our relationship.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nHere, I should like to say a few words in French\r\nto show my country’s attachment to and respect for\r\ncultures and languages in all their diversity. Some of\r\nthose languages, including French, have been\r\nbequeathed to us by history.\r\nPeople have struggled throughout history to live\r\nbetter, but humankind continues to suffer. That remains\r\ntrue, unfortunately, for the developing countries, and\r\nthose of the African continent in particular. The dawn\r\nof the third millennium has seen the expansion of\r\nassistance projects, including the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, to improve the fate of the weak\r\nand impoverished. We are committed to reducing\r\nextreme poverty and hunger by 2015.\r\nThe International Organization of la\r\nFrancophonie, as announced in November 2004 at its\r\ntenth summit in Ouagadougou, is involved in that\r\nglobal struggle. We need to reinvent ourselves, get off\r\nthe beaten track, and find new ways to attain our\r\nobjectives as soon as possible. In that respect, we\r\nwelcome the contribution of the French-speaking\r\nfamily in that joint action.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nFrom this very rostrum 37 years ago, when\r\nMauritius acceded to United Nations membership in\r\n1968, Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, then Prime\r\nMinister and father of the Mauritian nation, firmly\r\nadvocated a secure, stable and just world:\r\n“[M]en of goodwill are constantly trying to find a\r\nformula by which the underprivileged can banish\r\ninequality and fear and aspire to a place in the\r\nsun.” (A/PV.1643, para. 100)\r\nToday, those aspirations are more valid than ever\r\nas the comity of nations engages in the quest for\r\nfreedom from want, freedom from fear and the freedom\r\nto live in dignity. Providing mankind with those\r\nfreedoms remains the primary goal of the United\r\nNations.\r\nIn that spirit, I wish to announce that my\r\nGovernment has made a commitment in the Clinton\r\nGlobal Initiative to organizing an international\r\nconference on poverty and development, which will be\r\nresults-oriented.\r\nToday, as we celebrate the sixtieth year of its\r\nexistence, let us strive to become what we were always\r\nmeant to be — a truly representative body of “We the\r\npeoples of the United Nations”, acting in defence of\r\ntheir welfare and the advancement of their interests\r\n12\r\nA/60/PV.13\r\nabove all else. That must remain our unflinching\r\nobjective, and Mauritius pledges to fully play its part\r\nin that noble endeavour.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Mauritius for the statement he has just\r\nmade.\r\nThe Honourable Navinchandra Ramgoolam,\r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Mauritius, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by The Honourable Ralph E.\r\nGonsalves, Prime Minister, Minister for\r\nFinance, Planning, Economic Development,\r\nLabour, Information, Grenadines and Legal\r\nAffairs of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Prime Minister, Minister for Finance,\r\nPlanning, Economic Development, Labour,\r\nInformation, Grenadines and Legal Affairs of Saint\r\nVincent and the Grenadines.\r\nThe Honourable Ralph E. Gonsalves, Prime\r\nMinister, Minister for Finance, Planning,\r\nEconomic Development, Labour, Information,\r\nGrenadines and Legal Affairs of Saint Vincent\r\nand the Grenadines, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Excellency The Honourable Ralph E.\r\nGonsalves, Prime Minister, Minister for Finance,\r\nPlanning, Economic Development, Labour,\r\nInformation, Grenadines and Legal Affairs of Saint\r\nVincent and the Grenadines, and inviting him to\r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nMr. Gonsalves (Saint Vincent and the\r\nGrenadines): The sixtieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations coincides with the commemoration of my\r\ncountry’s twenty-fifth year of independence. The\r\npreamble to the Constitution of Saint Vincent and the\r\nGrenadines reaffirms that our nation is founded on the\r\nbelief in the supremacy of God and the freedom and\r\ndignity of man. Our national motto, Pax et justitia —\r\nPeace and justice — symbolizes both our reality and\r\nour dream. The universal ideals which inspired the\r\nfounding fathers of the United Nations are those which\r\nprompted the lofty proclamations in my nation’s\r\nConstitution. The United Nations Charter taught us a\r\ntruth, as though engraved on a tablet of stone, that\r\nwhile some sleep to dream, we must dream to change\r\nthe world for the better.\r\nWe in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines accept\r\nunequivocally the fulcrum around which the outcome\r\ndocument of the High-level Plenary Meeting revolves,\r\nnamely, to create a more peaceful, prosperous and\r\ndemocratic world, and to undertake concrete measures\r\nto continue finding ways to implement the conclusions\r\nof the Millennium Summit and other major United\r\nNations gatherings so as to provide multilateral\r\nsolutions to the problems which touch and concern\r\ndevelopment, peace and collective security, human\r\nrights and the rule of law, and the strengthening of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nYet the outcome document, though certainly a\r\ncodified and presumably consensual package, falls\r\nshort of what is truly demanded by these extraordinary,\r\nchallenging times in the first decade of the twenty-first\r\ncentury. The larger and more powerful nations are\r\ngripped by an unreasonable fear which, in the process,\r\nconstrains them from being reasonably fair. Less\r\npowerful nation-States and those which are small and\r\nweak internationally often beat their collective chests\r\nwith an unbecoming self-righteous purity that restrains\r\nthem from knowing or understanding what impurity is,\r\neven within themselves.\r\nSo, an unwholesome stand-off results.\r\nMeanwhile, around us all, there is a carnival of misery,\r\na festival of guns. A Caribbean poet laureate tells us\r\nthat the faces of men and women are strained and\r\nanxious. Many, if not most persons, become\r\nsceptical — nay, cynical — of the grand efforts of the\r\nworld’s leaders. They search instead for an amazing\r\ngrace which makes the blind to see and the wretched to\r\nbe saved. Along the way, the majesty of faith becomes\r\nmetamorphosed, in too many of the world’s\r\ninhabitants, into a believer’s extremism. Man’s reason\r\ncannot quite fathom, this side of eternity, the evil\r\nwhich extremism breeds. That is an enduring\r\nconundrum of our times which, in this earthly city, we,\r\namidst all our limitations and weaknesses, must seek to\r\naddress appropriately with all our possibilities and\r\nstrengths, but without the baggage of economic,\r\nmilitary or cultural imperialism.\r\nEconomic imperialism muzzles the mouth with\r\nthe food that it eats to live and thus builds resentment\r\nin that very mouth that eats, and even more so among\r\nthose who receive no food to eat. Military imperialism\r\n13\r\nA/60/PV.13\r\nbegets armed resistance in which a triumph is but a\r\npause in its impermanence. Cultural imperialism\r\ndistorts the mind, but in that very distortion the seed of\r\nits rejection germinates, blossoms and bears a bitter\r\nand even chauvinistic fruit. The presumed solutions of\r\nthe powerful have been shown, historically, to be\r\nmirages. Surely, there must be a better way. Nelson\r\nMandela has taught us that. Together, we are the world;\r\nwe are the future. But of all time, only the future is\r\nours to desecrate; the present is the past, and the past is\r\nour fathers’ mischiefs.\r\nUnderlying all of this is a seemingly intractable\r\nsocio-economic product of modern globalization — the\r\ncontradiction between, on the one hand, a growing\r\ninequality in income distribution globally and, on the\r\nother, the increasing commonality of consumption\r\npatterns. Modern communications, including the\r\nrevolution in information technology, have connected\r\nthe world as never before. Yet, that very enhanced\r\nconnection breeds, justifiably, a great impatience\r\namong those who are most disadvantaged. Economic\r\nadjustment has to be made more swiftly. Time is of the\r\nessence, but that very swiftness engenders socio-\r\neconomic dislocation, which poses immense\r\ndifficulties for political management.\r\nThose profound challenges require a series of\r\nmeasures, including more official development\r\nassistance more speedily disbursed, a fair system of\r\ninternational trade, international peace based on tried\r\nand tested principles of international law, appropriate\r\nreformation of the United Nations and its associate\r\ninstitutions, and a more tolerant and educated\r\npopulation worldwide. But we must set about doing so\r\nimmediately with conviction, resolution, solidarity and\r\ndignity. The alternative is apocalypse now.\r\nNo difficulties, no hardships, no crises, can\r\njustify terrorism. Terrorism wounds the poor and\r\ndisadvantaged ever so much. Its barbarism must\r\ncontinue to be resisted by civilized peoples and nations\r\ninternationally. No space must be given to terrorism.\r\nA small multi-island nation like Saint Vincent and\r\nthe Grenadines has a bundle of special needs. We are,\r\ntherefore, encouraged by the collective recognition by\r\nall the Member States of the United Nations that\r\nspecial needs and vulnerabilities attend small island\r\ndeveloping States. We are heartened, too, by the\r\nreaffirmation of the Member States’ commitment to\r\naddress these special needs and vulnerabilities. There\r\nare reams of paper commitments in the Mauritius\r\nStrategy adopted by the International Meeting to\r\nReview the Implementation of the Programme of\r\nAction for the Sustainable Development of Small\r\nIsland Developing States, in the Barbados Programme\r\nof Action and in the outcome document of the twenty-\r\nsecond special session of the General Assembly.\r\nWe realize that the just-concluded United Nations\r\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting has undertaken to promote\r\ngreater international cooperation and partnership for\r\nthe implementation of the solemn commitments\r\nthrough, among other things, the mobilization of\r\ndomestic and international resources, the promotion of\r\ninternational trade as an engine for development and\r\nincreased international financial and technical\r\ncooperation.\r\nThese splendid commitments and undertakings,\r\nlike all words, must be made flesh if they are to signify\r\nanything. To be sure, heard melodies are sweet, but\r\nthose unheard will be sweeter in uplifting action. In\r\nthis regard, I reaffirm, without here repeating, all that I\r\nstated in my speech to this body last Friday,\r\n16 September, on the development agenda focused on\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals and a sustainable\r\ncondition beyond them for countries like my own.\r\nCertainly, a fair resolution to the banana trade impasse\r\nin Europe must be fashioned without condemning our\r\npoor banana farmers and workers to further penury and\r\nmisery.\r\nThe recent occurrences in Asia, the Caribbean\r\nand the southern United States of devastating storms\r\nand hurricanes, and in Africa, of terrible droughts,\r\ndemand a more coordinated and rational approach\r\ninternationally to issues of climate change, disaster\r\npreparedness, and post-disaster rehabilitation. By and\r\nlarge, there have been ad hoc national, as distinct from\r\ninternational, approaches. To the extent that\r\ninternational mechanisms exist for prompt and\r\nappropriate relief work, they are clearly inadequate for\r\nthe tasks at hand.\r\nThis is undoubtedly an area in which the United\r\nNations and one or more of its agencies or associate\r\ninstitutions ought to be able to make a significant\r\ndifference to the well being of real flesh-and-blood\r\npeople. After all, natural disasters respect no territorial\r\nboundaries or power blocs; calamities from nature have\r\na studied ideological neutrality. They are the same sad\r\nsongs heard from ancient times by emperor, vassals\r\n14\r\nA/60/PV.13\r\nand clown; and in modern times, increasingly by the\r\nrich and the poor. But they afflict the poor more\r\ndisastrously than any other group. This matter demands\r\nurgent international attention. The pain and anguish\r\nevoked by President George Bush in his most recent\r\nspeech on the Katrina disaster must surely move to\r\nconcerted international action even those who stand\r\namid the alien corn.\r\nA sustained, coordinated response is needed if we\r\nare to avoid an ignoble “disaster fatigue” that treats a\r\nnatural disaster in one country as a momentary\r\ndistraction from normalcy, as television images\r\ndetermine, until the next one arrives. Grenada is a case\r\nin point. It was laid waste in September 2004 by\r\nHurricane Ivan, but its recovery effort has been slowed\r\nby the focus on the more recent catastrophes from\r\nnature in South Asia, Niger and the southern United\r\nStates. Grenada still cries out for massive international\r\nassistance. We must help. There is still an enduring\r\nneed, even after the television cameras have gone\r\nelsewhere. This applies, too, in relation to man-made\r\ndisasters, such as in Darfur.\r\nThe ever-deteriorating state of affairs in our\r\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM) neighbour Haiti\r\ndemonstrates vividly the inherent dangers of meddling\r\nwith the democratic process. Since I spoke on the\r\nissue, more in sadness than in anger, one year ago, the\r\nsituation has disintegrated. The so-called Government,\r\nimplanted without any mandate from the people, has\r\nneither the political will nor the popular support to\r\nundertake the measures necessary to return that poor,\r\ntraumatized country to some semblance of normalcy.\r\nThere has been no serious effort at disarming the gangs\r\nthat roam the towns and countryside and practice mob\r\njustice. Political victimization continues apace with the\r\ncruel detention and violation of the human rights of\r\nformer Prime Minister Yvon Neptune, the most glaring\r\nexample; while, on the other side of the coin, the\r\ndecision of the Supreme Court to quash the sentences\r\nof 15 thugs from the Front for Advancement and\r\nProgress in Haiti (FRAPH), convicted of involvement\r\nin the 1994 Raboteau massacre, has all the elements of\r\npolitical motivation.\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines, with its\r\nCARICOM partners, is anxious to welcome Haiti back\r\ninto the organs of our regional body. But it would be a\r\nbetrayal of all that we hold dear to ignore the\r\ninterruption of democracy, the abuses of human rights\r\nand the breakdown of law and order merely to appease\r\nperfidious power. We support the work of the United\r\nNations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH),\r\nwhile believing that the United Nations forces have\r\nneither the manpower nor the resources required to\r\nperform the miracle that they have been entrusted to\r\nconjure.\r\nFrom time to time, one or more of our traditional\r\nfriends and allies have shown displeasure at one or\r\nmore of our decisions in the field of international\r\nrelations. Some appear not to appreciate the necessity\r\nand desirability of small States, such as Saint Vincent\r\nand the Grenadines, seeking, and oft-times finding,\r\nmore economic and political space to enhance their\r\ncapacity to address more efficaciously the harsh winds\r\nfrom the external political economy and to do so in the\r\ninterest of our people’s humanization. No one has\r\nanything to fear from us. None of our friends can\r\nreasonably ask us to adopt their enemies as our own. It\r\nis part of our quest to get adversaries to speak sensibly\r\nto one another and resolve their differences,\r\nparticularly if they are our neighbours. We pick fights\r\nwith no one; and we do not pick other people’s fights.\r\nOne of the best and most loyal friends over our\r\ncountry’s 25 years of independence has been the\r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan. Our relationship has\r\nbeen exemplary and is characterized by mutual respect,\r\nsolidarity and a desire for international peace, in\r\naccordance with the principles enshrined in the Charter\r\nof the United Nations. Taiwan, a magnificent political\r\nexpression of the Chinese civilization, has partnered\r\nbeautifully with Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, a\r\ncomponent of our Caribbean civilization. We\r\nunequivocally support the quest of Taiwan to be\r\nrepresented at the United Nations and other\r\ninternational bodies. It is unfair, unreasonable and\r\nirrational to exclude a country of 23 million persons,\r\nwith a thriving economy and a nobility of purpose,\r\nfrom the United Nations. Further, we urge the United\r\nNations to take the lead in promoting constructive\r\ndialogue and friendly engagement between the\r\nPeople’s Republic of China and the Republic of China\r\non Taiwan. Bellicose conduct across the Taiwan Strait\r\ncannot be condoned in a world striving for enhanced\r\npeace and collective security.\r\nLet me end by expressing the hope that the\r\nUnited Nations may achieve, in the next 60 years,\r\ngreater and greater success in its goals of bringing\r\nhope to the hopeless, providing food for the hungry\r\n15\r\nA/60/PV.13\r\nand spreading peace, stability and sustainability for\r\nnow and forever. Let this not be the road less travelled.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of Saint\r\nVincent and the Grenadines for the statement he has\r\njust made.\r\nThe Honourable Ralph E. Gonsalves, Prime\r\nMinister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines,\r\nwas escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Deputy Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bahrain.\r\nMr. Al-Khalifa (Bahrain) (spoke in Arabic): It is\r\nmy pleasure to congratulate you upon your election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly during its historic\r\nsixtieth session. I am fully confident that you will lead\r\nits deliberations towards a successful conclusion. I also\r\nwould like to express my appreciation for the\r\ncontribution of the Foreign Minister of Gabon during\r\nthe fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly. I\r\ncommend the efforts of the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, who has sought to make significant\r\nchanges to this Organization so as to make it better\r\nable to meet the demands of the twenty-first century, as\r\nenvisaged in his report and in his recommendations\r\nbefore this session.\r\nThe historical context of the creation of our\r\ncurrent international order, with its mechanisms and\r\ninstitutions, is a part of a world different from that of\r\ntoday. That world preceded both the cold war and\r\nsubsequent events, developments and changes in\r\nregional and international arenas. Our session this year\r\nis, in essence, an important moment in the progress of\r\ninternational collective efforts, prompting us today to\r\nseek a new vision and to find systems that are better\r\ndeveloped in both their means and structures, in order\r\nto address contemporary dangers and threats, as well as\r\nrapid world changes.\r\nThe world today is witnessing many changes that\r\nare due to the interdependence of States and to various\r\nfacts, balances and dangers around the world. As a\r\nresult, we are obliged to revisit the international\r\ncollective security system, to thoroughly study the\r\nconcepts and structures of the United Nations and to\r\nprovide creative initiatives to address such matters in\r\nthe twenty-first century spirit of modernity. His\r\nHighness Shaikh Salman bin Hamad bin Isa\r\nAl-Khalifa, the Crown Prince, underlined this issue in\r\nhis address on behalf of His Majesty King Hamad bin\r\nIsa Al-Khalifa, King of Bahrain, before the High-level\r\nMeeting of the General Assembly on 15 September\r\n2005.\r\nThese might be the urgent needs that prompted\r\nthe Secretary-General to crystallize all this in a series\r\nof initiatives and meetings at the beginning of the third\r\nmillennium, by announcing suggestions for the\r\nmillennium and its development goals. In his important\r\nreport to this session, entitled “In larger freedom”\r\n(A/59/2005), the Secretary-General explained his\r\nvision in a comprehensive and in-depth manner, along\r\nwith the bases and aims of the work of the international\r\norder of our world today. Based on this order we can\r\nmove towards a modern, capable and democratic\r\nsystem to achieve the three important types of freedom,\r\nnamely freedom to live in dignity, freedom from want,\r\nand freedom from fear. This comprehensive vision of\r\nthe Secretary-General on issues of international\r\nsecurity, development and human rights deserves\r\ncommendation and thorough and deep analysis in order\r\nto reach a broad international consensus.\r\nThe dangerous escalation today in terrorism and\r\nits culture, derived from hatred and fanaticism, are the\r\nmost serious dangers threatening the international\r\ncommunity everywhere. They require us to develop an\r\nintegrated strategy that halts terrorism and the culture\r\nof death and violence that terrorism advocates. This\r\nalso re-emphasizes the common responsibility of States\r\nand societies to find a means to address the root causes\r\nof terrorism.\r\nWe must state that an effective counter-terrorism\r\nstrategy has to balance the needs of human security and\r\nadherence to international human rights instruments\r\nand treaties, and has to close loopholes in treaties\r\ndealing with the phenomenon of terrorism.\r\nIn this context, the Kingdom of Bahrain has\r\ncontinued its domestic efforts and its efforts in the Gulf\r\nRegion with its partner Gulf Cooperation Council\r\ncountries to fight money-laundering and the financing\r\nof terrorism in the Middle East and North Africa\r\ngeographically, and on the security cooperation level,\r\npolitically and practically. In this regard, the Kingdom\r\nof Bahrain endorses and supports the proposal of the\r\nCustodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Abdulla\r\nBin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, King of the brotherly\r\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia, to establish an international\r\ncentre to fight terrorism. The Kingdom of Bahrain has\r\n16\r\nA/60/PV.13\r\nalso submitted its instruments of accession to the\r\nUnited Nations Secretariat in New York for many\r\nconventions relating to the fight against terrorism, in\r\naccordance with Security Council resolution 1373\r\n(2001).\r\nThe greatest security challenge in the Middle East\r\nis not simply to end terrorism and violence; it also\r\nincludes the absence of a just and comprehensive peace\r\nin the Arab-Israeli conflict, which is an ongoing source\r\nof confrontation and a threat to stability and which\r\nbrings despair to those who have legitimate hopes for a\r\nlife of dignity and regional economic progress.\r\nWe must not forget that the year 2005 has opened\r\na path that might lead to an opportunity for peace,\r\nthrough the positive internal developments on the\r\nPalestinian side and through Arab and international\r\nsupport for the new leadership of President Mahmood\r\nAbbas and his moves towards achieving peace,\r\nreducing tension, and promoting democracy.\r\nWe welcome the Israeli withdrawal from the\r\nGaza Strip and hope that this withdrawal will be a\r\nsignificant step towards a just and comprehensive\r\npeace in the area. We also hope that this withdrawal\r\nwill be a part of the road map plan.\r\nThe achievement of security, stability and peace\r\nin the Middle East requires an end to the Israeli\r\noccupation of all Arab territories and the full\r\nimplementation of all relevant United Nations\r\nresolutions, as reaffirmed by the Arab initiative\r\nadopted by the Arab Summit in Beirut in 2002. That\r\nwas reaffirmed once again by the latest Arab Summit\r\nheld this year in Algiers. A just and comprehensive\r\npeace cannot be achieved, except through the end of\r\nthe Israeli occupation of the Arab territories occupied\r\nsince 1967, including the Syrian Golan and the rest of\r\nthe Lebanese territories, through the return of\r\nPalestinian refugees and through the establishment of\r\nthe Palestinian State, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its\r\ncapital.\r\nNotwithstanding the democratic choice of the\r\nIraqi people in the elections last January and the\r\nappointment of a transitional Government and in spite\r\nof the steps taken during the political process and the\r\npreparation of the draft constitution, the situation in\r\nIraq today remains very delicate and sensitive. It\r\nrepresents a challenge to international and regional\r\nsecurity. It threatens not only the security of Iraq and\r\nthe region, but also Iraq’s unity, its territorial integrity,\r\ncohesion and the consensus of its people.\r\nOvercoming this dilemma can be achieved only\r\nthrough a strong historical national consensus on Iraq’s\r\nterritorial integrity and ethnic diversity, a\r\ncomprehensive political process and participation in\r\nshaping the future of Iraq. This national consensus\r\nalone is the guarantee for Iraq to overcome its current\r\npredicament and to move from this difficult ordeal to\r\nan era of stability, security and peace.\r\nIn this context, the Kingdom of Bahrain reaffirms\r\nits support for the Iraqi people and calls upon all to\r\ncontinue regional and international support for Iraq in\r\norder that it may fulfil its responsibilities towards its\r\npeople and the Arab nation as a whole.\r\nIn the context of regional security in the Gulf\r\nregion, the peaceful settlement, either through\r\nnegotiations or international arbitration, of the long\r\ndispute between the United Arab Emirates and its\r\nbrother, the Islamic Republic of Iran, regarding the\r\nthree Emirate islands, especially now that there is a\r\nnew Iranian leadership, will enable the Gulf region to\r\ndivert its efforts and natural resources to face the\r\nchallenges of development, security, peace and\r\ncooperation.\r\nIn the area of development and progress, the\r\nKingdom of Bahrain has followed a policy of\r\nopenness, reform and participation and democracy\r\nenhancement, moving towards social, cultural and civil\r\nmodernization that goes hand in hand with our culture,\r\ndeep-rooted traditions and values.\r\nIn the context of its efforts to fulfil the\r\nMillennium Development Goals, the Kingdom of\r\nBahrain has taken significant steps to enable women to\r\nassume positions of leadership in various walks of life,\r\nby launching a new national strategy to promote\r\nBahraini women. Accordingly, in putting forward its\r\ncandidature for the presidency of the forthcoming\r\nsixty-first session of the General Assembly, it has\r\nselected a capable person who represents Bahraini\r\nwomen, and who demonstrates experience, wisdom and\r\ndiplomatic skill. We hope that this nomination will\r\nreceive wide agreement among Member States.\r\nReaffirming its regional and international status\r\nas an economic, financial and banking centre and as\r\npart of its efforts to attract greater investment and\r\ncapital, create employment opportunities for its\r\n17\r\nA/60/PV.13\r\ncitizens and strengthen the national economy, the\r\nKingdom of Bahrain has embarked on many major\r\neconomic and investment projects that will strengthen\r\nand enhance the economic and trade position of\r\nBahrain at the regional and international levels.\r\nEfforts and initiatives have continued over many\r\ndecades to achieve a collective security system that\r\nwill free humanity from the dangers of destruction and\r\nannihilation by prohibiting the proliferation of nuclear\r\nweapons. However, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\r\nBan Treaty has not achieved its goals despite accession\r\nby the majority of countries of the world, including all\r\nArab countries. In this regard, we call upon the\r\ninternational community to establish a nuclear-weapon-\r\nfree zone in both the Middle East and the Gulf region.\r\nWe hope that sincere and concerted efforts will\r\ncontinue among Member States to reach a consensus\r\non the reform of the Organization.\r\nWe trust that the framework of the proposed\r\nexpansion of the Security Council will reflect the\r\nconsensus of Member States with a clear and realistic\r\nvision and will take into account the interests and\r\nexpectations of the Arab nations with their profound\r\ninfluence on the political stability, economy, peace and\r\nsecurity in the whole world.\r\nThe recommendations put forward by the\r\nSecretary-General in his report “In larger freedom”\r\n(A/59/2005) represent comprehensive and ambitious\r\nviews and aspirations in relation not only to the\r\nSecurity Council, which is entrusted by the Charter\r\nwith the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity, but also to establishing the basis for the entire\r\ninternational system.\r\nWe all look forward, during this session, to the\r\nopening of historic negotiations on the reforms of\r\nUnited Nations organs as well as on working methods.\r\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain supports the United Nations\r\nreform initiative and believes in the necessity of\r\ncontinued negotiations and discussions among Member\r\nStates in order to reach the results that we all aspire to.\r\nThe world today, this post-cold-war world, is not\r\nyet free of the scourge of war, and its people are still\r\nvulnerable to the consequences of terrorism and\r\nviolence.\r\nToday, we urgently need a more modern,\r\nstronger, reinvigorated and more credible Organization:\r\nan Organization that will bring all nations together and\r\nbalance their interests, resolve conflicts, build peace\r\nand security, uphold justice and the rule of law, oblige\r\nall to abide by the provisions of the Charter and\r\ninternational legal resolutions, adapt to the changes of\r\nthe twenty-first century and meet successfully its\r\nchallenges.\r\nWe look forward to a reformed United Nations,\r\nwhich we hope will come into existence soon.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency by Mr. Li Zhaoxing, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of China.\r\nMr. Li Zhaoxing (China) (spoke in Chinese):\r\nMay I begin by extending my congratulations on your\r\nelection as the President of the General Assembly at its\r\nsixtieth session. I am confident that under your\r\nguidance this session will achieve fruitful results. I also\r\nwish to take this opportunity to express my sincere\r\nrespects to Mr. Jean Ping, President at the previous\r\nsession, and to the Secretary-General.\r\nThis year marks the sixtieth anniversary of the\r\nend of the world war against fascism and the founding\r\nof the United Nations. Just a few days ago in this Hall,\r\nworld leaders solemnly adopted the outcome document\r\nof the High-level Plenary Meeting (resolution 60/1).\r\nNow, it falls to us to fulfil the important and pressing\r\ntask of working towards a harmonious world of lasting\r\npeace and common prosperity by translating that\r\ndocument into action and turning fine words into\r\nreality. This session should serve to promote peace,\r\nharmony and common development.\r\nWe want peaceful development. Progress of\r\nmankind needs a peaceful environment. Stability and\r\nsecurity of one country cannot be built on the\r\nturbulence or crisis of another. Only a new security\r\nconcept featuring mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality\r\nand coordination will enable us to develop in peace and\r\nsafeguard peace through development.\r\nWe want harmonious development. To build a\r\nbetter future is the long-cherished dream of mankind.\r\nAny development strategy should be guided by a long-\r\nterm and holistic perspective instead of immediate and\r\nsectoral benefits. Therefore, we should work together\r\nfor more democratic and law-based international\r\nrelations and a harmonious environment in which\r\ncountries respect one another, treat one another as\r\nequals, and in which different cultures can emulate and\r\ninterchange with each other.\r\n18\r\nA/60/PV.13\r\nWe want common development. No model of\r\ndevelopment that benefits only a few countries or a\r\nsmall group of people is acceptable or sustainable.\r\nCountries should cooperate with each other more\r\nclosely so that economic globalization may yield\r\nsuccessful results, benefit-sharing and common\r\nprosperity.\r\nThis session should serve to push forward\r\nreforms of the United Nations and strengthen its role.\r\nHaving weathered 60 years of vicissitudes, the United\r\nNations needs multifaceted and multidimensional\r\nreforms so as to be able to make a greater contribution\r\nto mankind’s noble cause of peace and development.\r\nThe position of the United Nations as the core of\r\nthe world collective security mechanism must be\r\nstrengthened so that it can perform its duty of\r\nsafeguarding peace in a more effective way. China\r\nsupports the efforts to enhance the Organization’s\r\ncapacity on conflict prevention, mediation and good\r\noffices. We also favour a greater role by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in this respect and the fostering of a preventive\r\nculture.\r\nWe support the efforts to strengthen United\r\nNations peacekeeping operations, particularly with\r\nregard to rapid deployment capacity and strategic\r\npreparedness, as well as the capacity to fully mobilize\r\nregional organizations and their resources under the\r\nleadership of the Security Council.\r\nChina supports the establishment of a\r\nPeacebuilding Commission to more effectively\r\ncoordinate United Nations efforts in the areas of\r\npeacekeeping, post-conflict rehabilitation and\r\ndevelopment. In that respect, the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil and other development assistance agencies\r\nshould have an important role to play in the\r\nCommission.\r\nIt has been our consistent position to oppose the\r\nuse or threat of force in international relations. We do\r\nnot support the reinterpretation or revision of the\r\nprovisions in the Charter of the United Nations related\r\nto the right of self-defence. Should an occasion arise\r\nthat calls for the use of force, it is the Security Council\r\nthat should make sound judgements and take prudent\r\ndecisions as to the merits of the situation.\r\nThe international community should continue to\r\npress ahead with the international process on arms\r\ncontrol, disarmament and non-proliferation; safeguard\r\nand enhance the authority and effectiveness of existing\r\nmultilateral treaties; give full scope to the role of the\r\nUnited Nations and other international organizations in\r\nthe area of non-proliferation; and seek solutions to\r\nrelated issues by political and diplomatic means.\r\nThe United Nations should be able to cope more\r\neffectively with non-traditional security threats. We\r\nwelcome the comprehensive strategy on counter-\r\nterrorism proposed by the Secretary-General, and we\r\nhope to see the early conclusion of a comprehensive\r\nconvention on international terrorism, taking full\r\naccount of the concerns of various parties, particularly\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nIn the effort to reduce and prevent large-scale\r\nhumanitarian crises, the international community\r\nshould strictly observe the United Nations Charter,\r\nrespect the opinions of the countries or organizations\r\nconcerned and, with the Security Council’s\r\nauthorization, explore, to the greatest extent possible,\r\npeaceful settlement within the United Nations\r\nframework. We oppose any rash intervention carried\r\nout on the basis of the claim that a nation is unable or\r\nunwilling to protect its own citizens.\r\nDevelopment should be a main focus of United\r\nNations reform. Although China is a low-income\r\ndeveloping country, it is prepared to contribute as\r\nmuch as it can to international cooperation for\r\ndevelopment. As President Hu Jintao announced at the\r\nsummit, China will take substantive steps in five areas.\r\nWe will join hands with all Members to advance\r\nreforms in the area of development so as to facilitate\r\nthe resolution of development issues. The United\r\nNations should put in place a fair and rational\r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) review\r\nframework to assess progress made in various\r\ncountries and to monitor follow-up of international\r\ncooperation and aid commitments. We support the\r\ncoordinating role of the Economic and Social Council\r\nin development-related areas.\r\nThe Doha Round should embody development in\r\nits focus, paying more attention and taking actions to\r\naddress the concerns of developing countries,\r\nparticularly with regard to agricultural produce and\r\nspecial and differential treatment. China has decided to\r\ngrant zero-tariff treatment to some commodities from\r\n39 least developed countries, which will cover the\r\nmajority of China’s imports from those countries.\r\n19\r\nA/60/PV.13\r\nChina is in favour of incorporating the prevention\r\nand treatment of HIV/AIDS and the building of the\r\npublic health sector into the development programmes\r\nand activities of various countries and of the United\r\nNations. We will be submitting at the current session a\r\ndraft resolution on strengthening global capacity-\r\nbuilding in the area of public health. In the next three\r\nyears, we plan to provide more aid and medicine to\r\ndeveloping countries for preventing and treating\r\nmalaria and other communicable diseases and to help\r\nthem establish and reform their public health systems\r\nand train medical personnel.\r\nThe international community — particularly\r\ndeveloped countries — should take substantive steps to\r\nhelp developing countries break the vicious circle of\r\ndebt. Such steps include substantial debt reduction and\r\nthe streamlining of debt relief procedures and\r\nrequirements. In the next two years, China will write\r\noff or otherwise cancel the overdue portions, as of the\r\nend of 2004, of interest-free or low-interest\r\nGovernment loans owed by all heavily indebted poor\r\ncountries having diplomatic relations with China.\r\nWe call on the United Nations to give priority to\r\nhelping developing countries to strengthen their\r\ncapacity-building. China will help developing\r\ncountries train 30,000 people for various professions in\r\nthe next three years.\r\nMy country also favours setting a timetable for\r\ndeveloped countries to allocate 0.7 per cent of their\r\ngross national income to official development\r\nassistance. New fund-raising methods should be\r\nexplored so as to put more funds into development.\r\nChina pledges $10 billion in concessional loans\r\nto developing countries in the next three years within\r\nthe framework of South-South cooperation.\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations grants the\r\nSecurity Council the primary responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. A\r\nhighly efficient, responsible and representative Council\r\nserves the long-term interests of the United Nations\r\nand the common interests of all its Member States.\r\nChina supports reform of the Security Council\r\naimed at strengthening its authority and efficiency and\r\nimproving its working methods. The representation of\r\ndeveloping countries, particularly African countries,\r\nshould be increased so that small and medium-sized\r\ncountries would have more say in the Council’s\r\ndecision-making. No reform proposal can work that\r\naddresses only the concerns of a few countries,\r\ndisregarding the interests of the majority of countries,\r\nand treats developing countries in Africa and in other\r\nparts of the world unfairly.\r\nChina supports the principle of cooperation based\r\non democratic consultation. As reform will affect the\r\nfuture of the United Nations and the interests of\r\nvarious parties, there should be no artificial timeframes\r\nor attempts to force decisions through a vote. Instead,\r\nMember States should seek consensus through dialogue\r\nand consultation and in accordance with the principle\r\nof democratic international relations.\r\nChina embraces the spirit of unity and\r\ncooperation. The United Nations family has 191\r\nMembers. Unity is the source of strength. We want\r\nunity, not division. As long as Member States respect\r\none another’s interests, accommodate one another’s\r\nconcerns and show pragmatism and flexibility, we will\r\nbe able to find a reform path that is acceptable to all.\r\nThe current session should focus on Africa.\r\nAfrican countries make up a quarter of the United\r\nNations membership, and their populations account for\r\n13 per cent of the world’s total population. If there is\r\nno stability in Africa, the world will have no peace. If\r\nAfrica remains poor, there will be no development for\r\nthe world. The outcome document of the summit calls\r\nfor efforts to meet the special needs of Africa. I believe\r\nthat that is correct and necessary.\r\nDespite the gratifying progress made in Africa in\r\nrecent years, conflicts in some of its regions have\r\npersisted. The Security Council should pay special\r\nattention to African problems and give them priority on\r\nits agenda. That means not only devoting more Council\r\nmeetings to African issues, but also, and more\r\nimportant, taking concrete actions to heed Africa’s\r\nvoice, respect its views and accommodate its concerns.\r\nChina applauds the mediation and good offices of\r\nthe African Union and other regional organizations\r\naimed at conflict settlement in Africa. We support\r\nclose cooperation between the Security Council and\r\nthose organizations by providing them with funds,\r\nlogistics and technical assistance to strengthen their\r\npeacekeeping and post-conflict reconstruction\r\ncapacities.\r\nAfrican countries face difficulties in the area of\r\ndevelopment, particularly in attaining the MDGs. More\r\n20\r\nA/60/PV.13\r\nthan 300 million people are still living under the\r\npoverty line. One third of all children are\r\nmalnourished. More than 30 million people are\r\nsuffering from HIV/AIDS. With less than 2 per cent of\r\nthe world’s economic aggregate, Africa is weighed\r\ndown by debts amounting to $300 billion. All of that\r\nposes a challenge to the conscience of mankind.\r\nThe international community should reach a\r\nglobal consensus on African development and help the\r\ncontinent to achieve the MDGs on schedule by\r\nimplementing the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment. Those who provide assistance must do\r\nso in all sincerity and respect the right of African\r\ncountries to make their own decisions. Assistance must\r\nalso have a clear aim: to meet the basic and long-term\r\nneeds of the African people. Assistance is by no means\r\ncharity or a gift; it is a response to the call for mutual\r\nbenefit and common development. Furthermore, it is\r\nour moral duty to help the needy and redress injustices.\r\nIn the twentieth century, Africa shook off\r\ncolonial rule and achieved national liberation. That was\r\nan epoch-making event. The twenty-first century will\r\nbring peace and development to Africa — it is\r\nhistorically inevitable. The Chinese people will\r\ncontinue to stand beside their African brothers and\r\nsisters on that journey of historic significance.\r\nThe recently concluded Six-Party Talks in Beijing\r\non the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue have reached an\r\nimportant consensus and issued a joint declaration,\r\nmarking an important step forward in the Talks and a\r\ncrystallization of the political will and diligence of the\r\nparties concerned. It also reflects the common\r\naspiration of the international community. Because it\r\nwas so hard-won, this result needs to be especially\r\nprized. We hope that the parties will continue to work\r\ntogether to promote further progress in the Six-Party\r\nTalks, resolve the nuclear issue on the Peninsula\r\nthrough dialogue and by peaceful means, ensure lasting\r\npeace and stability in the region and realize its\r\ncommon goals for development and prosperity. The\r\nChinese Government will continue to make a positive\r\ncontribution in that regard.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Felipe Pérez Roque, Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\nof Cuba.\r\nMr. Pérez Roque (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nActually, we have no reason to celebrate the sixtieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations. The chaotic,\r\nunequal and insecure world in which we are now living\r\nis not much of a tribute to those who gathered on\r\n26 June 1945 in San Francisco to found the United\r\nNations.\r\nFrom the conclusion of the Millennium Summit\r\nin 2000 until today, more of the world’s children have\r\ndied of preventable diseases than all of the victims of\r\nthe Second World War put together.\r\nThe aggression against Iraq was launched, not\r\njust without regard to, but even counter to the opinion\r\nof the international community. That happened just two\r\nand a half years after having solemnly proclaimed at\r\nthe Millennium Summit that “We are determined to\r\nestablish a just and lasting peace all over the world in\r\naccordance with the purposes and principles of the\r\nCharter” (resolution 55/2, para. 4). The General\r\nAssembly could not even meet to discuss it. The\r\nSecurity Council was ignored and then had to undergo\r\nthe humiliation of docilely accepting a predatory war\r\nthat had earlier been opposed by a majority of its\r\nmembers.\r\nThere is a clear explanation for the current state\r\nof affairs, which is that the order enshrined in the\r\nCharter pertained to a bipolar world and to a balance of\r\npower that no longer exists today. “We, the peoples” —\r\nas the Charter says — must bear the burden of a\r\nunipolar world, in which a single super-Power imposes\r\nits whims and selfish interests on the United Nations\r\nand the international community.\r\nTherefore, trying to get the United Nations to\r\nfunction in conformity with the principles and purposes\r\nenshrined in the Charter is make-believe. It is not\r\npossible. And it will not be possible as long as third\r\nworld countries, which make up the majority of the\r\nworld, fail to unite and fight together for their rights.\r\nWere the United States Government to comply\r\nwith Security Council resolution 1373 (2001), adopted\r\non 28 September 2001, and to the international\r\nconventions on terrorism, it would extradite the\r\nterrorist Luis Posada Carriles to Venezuela and release\r\nthe five young Cuban anti-terrorist fighters who have\r\nbeen subjected to cruel and unjust imprisonment for\r\nseven years.\r\nHad the United States Government allowed the\r\nUnited Nations to act in accordance with the Charter,\r\nthe Iraqi people would not have been invaded so that\r\nthey could be robbed of their petroleum, the Palestinian\r\n21\r\nA/60/PV.13\r\npeople would exercise sovereignty over their territory\r\nand Cuba would not continue to be blockaded. Nor\r\nwould there be billions of illiterate people or 900\r\nmillion starving human beings in the world.\r\nThat explains the failure of last week’s summit,\r\nwhich was convened to assess compliance with the\r\nmodest commitments entered into to fulfil the\r\nMillennium Development Goals and which ended as a\r\npitiful imitation of what should have been a serious and\r\ncommitted debate concerning the grave problems\r\ncurrently besetting humankind. It was a complete farce.\r\nIt was of no interest to the powerful. Their selfish and\r\nhegemonic interests run counter to the aspiration for a\r\nmore just and better world for all.\r\nThe scandalous pressures and blackmail brought\r\nto bear on Member States, after the United States\r\nAmbassador brandished the stick and attempted to\r\nimpose 750 amendments on the outcome document,\r\nwill go down in history as the most eloquent evidence\r\nthat a new world and a new United Nations must be\r\nbuilt, with respect for and recognition of the right to\r\npeace, sovereignty and development for all, without\r\ngenocidal wars, blockades or injustice. The final\r\nnegotiations, from which most United Nations\r\nMembers were excluded, and the outcome document\r\nthat was adopted, in which issues of vital interest for\r\nour peoples have been omitted, is a vivid illustration of\r\nwhat we are talking about.\r\nWhile we await the day in which that new world\r\nand the new United Nations can become a reality, we,\r\nthe peoples, will continue to fight and, through our\r\nresistance, win once again the rights currently denied\r\nto us.\r\nThe powerful only talk about interventions and\r\npreventive wars, about imposing draconian conditions\r\nor the most efficient ways to control the United\r\nNations, while attempting to legitimize concepts such\r\nas the so-called responsibility to protect, which could\r\nbe used one day to justify acts of aggression against\r\nour countries. Let us spell this out clearly: today there\r\nis no right to peace for the small.\r\nWe as Cubans understand this very well, and we\r\nrely on the solidarity of peoples, on our united front\r\nand on our weapons, which have never been used\r\nexcept to defend just causes. Our brothers and sisters in\r\nAfrica know this well.\r\nWe are not pessimists; we are revolutionaries. We\r\ndo not surrender or conform. Today, more resolutely\r\nthan ever, we affirm that “we, the peoples” will\r\novercome.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency\r\nDatuk Seri Syed Hamid Albar, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Malaysia.\r\nMr. Albar (Malaysia): Malaysia, as the Chairman\r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement and in its own name,\r\nwishes to convey our congratulations to you, Sir, on\r\nyour election as the President of the General Assembly\r\nat its sixtieth session. I am confident that, under your\r\nable stewardship, the work of the Assembly will reach\r\na successful conclusion. I wish to assure you of the\r\nfullest cooperation of the Non-Aligned Movement and\r\nof the Malaysian delegation.\r\nLet me also pay tribute to your predecessor,\r\nMr. Jean Ping, for his dedication and for the successful\r\nmanner in which he conducted the work of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-ninth session, which was an\r\nexceptionally challenging one. The consultations and\r\nnegotiations led to the successful adoption of the final\r\noutcome document at the world summit last Friday.\r\nSix decades ago, the peoples of the world,\r\nincluding those under oppression and colonialism,\r\ncelebrated the creation of the United Nations. The\r\nUnited Nations, as envisaged by its founders, was a\r\nbeacon of hope for the world following the death and\r\ndestruction wrought by the Second World War.\r\nMalaysia fully and consistently subscribes to the\r\ncentrality of the United Nations and thus to the\r\nmultilateral principles which have allowed the\r\nevolution of an international order predicated on rule-\r\nbased interaction among States, thus creating a\r\npredictable and stable international environment.\r\nWithout multilateralism, small or weak States could\r\nnot hope for a democratic international order within\r\nwhich they could aspire to independence, peace and\r\nstability, development and prosperity.\r\nToday, even as we meet here, multilateralism has\r\ncome under increasing threat. We believe that attempts\r\nto unilaterally rewrite or redefine the normative\r\nframework is a dangerous experiment. Without the\r\nstabilizing effect of such a framework, we would only\r\ncreate uncertainty and confusion in the international\r\norder.\r\n22\r\nA/60/PV.13\r\nThe challenge confronting humankind in our time\r\nis to address, comprehensively and collectively, the\r\nmultifaceted threats to our survival and well-being in\r\nthe areas of peace and security, poverty and\r\ndevelopment, human rights and democracy.\r\nIn that regard, the outcome document has sought\r\nto give a fresh lease on life to multilateralism, both in\r\nsubstance and in structure. As we continue our\r\ndiscussions to reshape and redirect the Organization,\r\nwe must ensure that the General Assembly remains the\r\ntrue embodiment of the will of the world community.\r\nAll of us must be committed to strengthening the\r\nGeneral Assembly so that it reflects the true voice of\r\ndemocracy, transparency and accountability. At this\r\njuncture, let me voice Malaysia’s support for the\r\nchecklist of items to be implemented during the current\r\nsession, as mapped out by the Secretary-General in his\r\naddress last Saturday. I hope that, by the time we meet\r\nagain next year, the Secretary-General’s report will be\r\nable to illustrate a marked improvement in the world\r\nsituation, in particular towards achieving the\r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015 and\r\nthe greater efficiency and effectiveness of the\r\nSecretariat.\r\nDriven by a common sense of purpose and\r\ndetermined political will, we must operationalize the\r\ncommitments we have undertaken at the major United\r\nNations conferences and summits of recent years. Our\r\nwords must be matched by our actions. This must\r\nrepresent the beginning of the collective redoubling of\r\nefforts that is necessary to secure a more peaceful and\r\njust world. Where we had been unable to push the\r\nagenda on certain issues, we must now pursue them as\r\npart of an ongoing process in the reform of the United\r\nNations. Where efforts to reach agreement have failed\r\naltogether, such as on the issue of disarmament and\r\nnon-proliferation, we must now focus our energies in\r\norder to keep the issues alive until we achieve\r\nconsensus.\r\nMalaysia is disappointed by the absence of any\r\nreference to disarmament and non-proliferation in the\r\noutcome document. I hope that this is not construed as\r\na loss of interest by the international community or as\r\nan indication that it has since fallen off our radar of\r\nconcern. Our collective call for nuclear-weapon States\r\nto effect complete and general disarmament as well as\r\nto ensure the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons\r\nmust not be compromised.\r\nIt is indeed regrettable that the 2005 Review\r\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) earlier this\r\nyear failed. That failure will intensify the adverse\r\nrepercussions on the disarmament regime,\r\npainstakingly negotiated since the end of the Second\r\nWorld War. We must therefore, at this session, reiterate\r\nand, indeed, reaffirm the importance of the full and\r\nnon-selective implementation of the three pillars of the\r\nNon-Proliferation Treaty, namely: nuclear\r\ndisarmament, nuclear non-proliferation and the\r\npeaceful use of nuclear technology.\r\nWe must also rededicate our efforts towards the\r\ntotal elimination of all weapons of mass destruction.\r\nThe world spent an estimated $1 trillion on global\r\nmilitary expenditures last year. Doubtless, much of that\r\nwent to strengthening the military arsenals of States\r\nthat feel constantly under threat; yet some of that must\r\nalso have been contributed by terrorists purchasing\r\narms for their condemnable acts. The sale of small\r\narms and light weapons has wrought untold suffering\r\non unsuspecting peoples everywhere. The international\r\ncommunity must collectively call on States to divert\r\nsuch military spending to achieving the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals and to strengthening the\r\ndevelopment infrastructure. This would go far towards\r\ncreating a just and equitable order, which in turn would\r\nlead to a safer world.\r\nSince the adoption of the MDGs five years ago,\r\nthe burdens and obstacles faced by developing\r\ncountries seem to have increased, with almost no\r\namelioration of the problems that already existed at the\r\ntime. Eight years ago, East Asia was battered by a\r\nfinancial crisis, which in turn had trans-regional\r\nrepercussions, adversely affecting the health of the\r\nglobal economy. Appeals by developing countries to\r\nreform the international financial architecture fell on\r\ndeaf ears. As a result, the international financial\r\narchitecture continues to be vulnerable to similar\r\ncrises.\r\nNow, even as that and other equally important\r\nproblems remain unresolved, we are faced with yet\r\nanother threat — a prolonged and sustained increase in\r\noil prices, which, even as we speak, threatens to\r\nimperil the global economy. Continuous increases in\r\noil prices are placing a disproportionate burden on\r\ndeveloping countries, thereby impoverishing them even\r\nfurther. It is morally reprehensible that the poor are\r\n23\r\nA/60/PV.13\r\nexpected to absorb the cost of instabilities of\r\nproduction. In many quarters of the global community,\r\nthe unbridled free market in particular is viewed as\r\nrapacious and unfeeling.\r\nIf the United Nations is to remain relevant to the\r\nworld at large, it must be able to discuss and decide on\r\nprecisely issues such as these, which not only have an\r\nimpact on our day-to-day lives but also have long-term\r\nimplications, including for peace and security. If wars\r\nin the past were fought over ideology, conflicts in the\r\nfuture will be due to competition for markets and\r\nscarce natural resources, blurring the lines between\r\neconomics, development and security. Accordingly, the\r\nUnited Nations must be prepared to address the\r\ninterrelated and cross-cutting issues that give rise to\r\nsuch conflicts.\r\nGlobalization, with its myriad challenges and\r\nopportunities, has left many in the developing\r\ncountries unable to compete in an open and free-market\r\nsystem. Following the current trajectory, the\r\ninternational economic system will continue to remain\r\nunjust, punishing the poor for being unable to\r\ninfluence, much less dictate, their destinies. Much\r\nremains to be done to equalize the field between the\r\nrich and the rest. Aid and debt cancellation, while they\r\nare welcome and reduce the burden on developing\r\ncountries, have in the long term only limited effect. It\r\nis trade that needs to be expanded and made more fair\r\nand equitable. We must press ahead towards a\r\nuniversal, rule-based, open, non-discriminatory, fair\r\nand equitable multilateral trading system. It is widely\r\nrecognized that trade has a multiplier effect and is able\r\nto lift poor communities towards becoming self-\r\nsustaining ones. Trade can create competitive markets\r\nthat benefit all.\r\nMalaysia condemns all acts, methods and\r\npractices of terrorism. As terrorism is a global\r\nphenomenon that transcends national boundaries,\r\nfighting terrorism demands effective international\r\naction in accordance with the Charter and universally\r\nrecognized principles of international relations and\r\ninternational law.\r\nIn countering terrorism, the use of conventional\r\nmilitary force alone is insufficient. To truly address the\r\nscourge and prevent its re-emergence elsewhere over\r\ntime, we must deal with the root causes of terrorism in\r\norder to provide a lasting solution that will deny those\r\ncommitting such acts of violence sympathy and keep\r\nthem from gaining new recruits. While countering their\r\nactions, we must at the same time win the hearts and\r\nminds of the people in order to ensure that our victory\r\nwill not be short-lived.\r\nNo one group acting alone will be able to achieve\r\ntotal success. Clearly, success requires a sense of\r\ncommon purpose. The portrayal of any particular\r\ngrouping of peoples as fanatical terrorists led by a\r\nreligion of war is, therefore, irresponsible and would\r\nderail any attempt at forging a common and united\r\nfront against terrorism. It is our collective duty to\r\nrespond effectively to the legitimate grievances of\r\naffected communities, wherever they may be, so as to\r\novercome their feelings of marginalization,\r\ndeprivation, oppression and injustice. The international\r\ncommunity as a whole must take a stand to stop actions\r\nthat contribute directly or indirectly to the perpetuation\r\nof injustice, oppression or aggression.\r\nMisunderstanding and fear of “the other” must be\r\nreplaced by respect, dialogue, understanding and\r\ntolerance. In this context, we can build a universal\r\nculture that respects diversity so that goodwill and\r\nharmony can thrive.\r\nThe interests and concerns of minority groups\r\nmust not be sidelined in favour of the majority.\r\nMinorities too have rights that must be protected by\r\ntheir Government. Over time, the grievances of\r\nminority groups over their being sidelined will\r\nnecessarily seek an outlet.\r\nThere is a national as well as an international\r\ndimension to the issue of peaceful and cooperative co-\r\nexistence. Understanding and respect between\r\nreligions, cultures and civilizations become necessary\r\nprerequisites for dialogue and the avoidance of\r\nconflicts. If Governments can succeed in instituting a\r\nculture of tolerance and moderation among people at\r\nthe domestic level, it will become easier for nation\r\nStates to cooperate in promoting tolerance and\r\nmoderation among nationalities and cultures at the\r\ninternational level. We must institute the precepts of\r\njustice, respect and understanding in our day-to-day\r\ndealings. This would, in turn, lead to fairness, goodwill\r\nand harmony in our relations.\r\nThe ideas of good governance, democracy and\r\naccountability to God and our peoples are not\r\nantithetical to Islam. They are clearly embodied in the\r\nKoran and the traditions of the Prophet Mohammed.\r\nFor our own part in Malaysia, we believe that the\r\n24\r\nA/60/PV.13\r\nobligation to act based on religious imperatives can be\r\ndirected towards good, progress and development. We\r\ncall this approach Islam Hadhari, literally civilizational\r\nIslam, which is an approach towards a progressive and\r\nhumanistic civilization that is consistent with the\r\nobjective of creating a stable international world order.\r\nThe approach that Malaysia has taken emphasizes\r\nthat progress, development, knowledge and good\r\ngovernance as enshrined in the teachings of Islam, are\r\ncompatible with modernity and yet are firmly rooted in\r\nthe ethical, moral and universal values that will\r\nguarantee the future of humankind. It is an approach\r\nthat values substance over form and promotes tolerance\r\nand understanding, moderation and peace, and\r\ncertainly, enlightenment.\r\nIn our preoccupation with the reform of the\r\nUnited Nations, we must not lose sight of the need to\r\naddress and resolve, on a priority basis, one of the most\r\nimportant outstanding issues confronting this\r\nOrganization: the question of Palestine. While we all\r\nwelcome the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, it should be\r\npart of the Road Map and should be quickly followed\r\nby similar measures in the West Bank. The issue of\r\nsettlements must not be left unresolved, including in\r\nand around Jerusalem, as well as the construction of\r\nthe Separation Wall, which has already been\r\npronounced illegal by the International Court of\r\nJustice. Such activities must cease forthwith. The\r\ninternational community, particularly the United\r\nNations, must continue to remain engaged with this\r\nissue until the goal of an independent and sovereign\r\nState of Palestine is realized.\r\nRich or poor, strong or weak, whatever our\r\nreligion or belief, one fact is inescapable: we inhabit\r\none world, our global village. Sixty years ago, the\r\nfounders of our universal Organization came together\r\nafter witnessing horrors hitherto unimaginable and said\r\nthat never again could human life be so wantonly\r\nextinguished. They also proclaimed that humankind\r\nwould forevermore work and live together in peace,\r\nharmony and common respect. On this historic\r\noccasion, my plea is that we return to those hopes and\r\nideals.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Rashid Abdullah Al-Noaimi, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the United Arab Emirates.\r\nMr. Al-Noaimi (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in\r\nArabic): It is my pleasure to take this opportunity to\r\ncongratulate you on your election to the Presidency of\r\nthis session, which coincides with the sixtieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations. We hope that this\r\nimportant session will provide a historic opportunity to\r\nreview and evaluate the achievements of this\r\nOrganization and to formulate a political and\r\ndevelopment vision on strengthening our common\r\naction and our ability to maintain international peace\r\nand security and achieve sustainable development.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates welcomes the\r\nOutcome Document of the High-level Plenary Meeting\r\nand considers it a positive step towards achieving the\r\nMDGs, especially those related to the four main fields,\r\nnamely development, peace and collective security,\r\nhuman rights, rule of law and the strengthening of the\r\nUnited Nations. At the same time, we hope that our\r\nconsultations on other unsolved issues will continue in\r\norder to reach an international consensus.\r\nIn that context, we wish to reaffirm our position\r\ncalling for the reform of the United Nations, including\r\nthe increase of permanent and non-permanent\r\nmembership of the Security Council, based on a system\r\nof equitable geographical distribution that ensures the\r\ntransparency of the Council’s working methods.\r\nWe emphasize the importance of reinforcing\r\ninternational commitment to the principles of\r\ninternational and humanitarian law and respect for the\r\nsovereignty of States, including their cultural and\r\nreligious diversity and traditions. We also underline the\r\nneed to respect the resolutions and recommendations of\r\ninternational legitimacy issued by world summits,\r\nincluding the Millennium Declaration.\r\nWe affirm that the challenges of the twenty-first\r\ncentury, including poverty, illiteracy, epidemics,\r\nenvironmental degradation, global terrorism, organized\r\ncrime and the proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, are by nature transnational and pose grave\r\nthreats to all humanity. Therefore, while we supported\r\nthe establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission,\r\nwhich will assist countries recovering from civil and\r\nregional wars, we call for the utilization of our human\r\ncultures and beliefs in joint efforts to address such\r\nchallenges, including the holding of an international\r\nconference on combating terrorism and its causes. Such\r\na conference must provide a clear definition of\r\nterrorism, based on the principles of the United Nations\r\nCharter and international law and norms, and must\r\ndistinguish between terrorism and the legitimate\r\n25\r\nA/60/PV.13\r\nstruggle of peoples against foreign occupation. At the\r\nsame time, we reaffirm our support for the proposal of\r\nthe brotherly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to establish an\r\ninternational centre to combat terrorism.\r\nFirmly convinced of the importance of adopting\r\npeaceful solutions in resolving disputes and issues of\r\nforeign occupation, particularly in the Middle East and\r\nthe Arab Gulf region, the United Arab Emirates calls\r\nupon the Islamic Republic of Iran to respond to its\r\npeaceful initiatives aimed at resolving the issue of\r\nIran’s occupation of the three islands of the United\r\nArab Emirates — Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu\r\nMusa — through bilateral negotiations or by referral to\r\nthe International Court of Justice.\r\nIn that context, we reaffirm that all actions taken\r\nby Iran since its illegal occupation of the three islands\r\nin 1971 are null and void, because they contradict the\r\nUnited Nations Charter, international law, the\r\nprinciples of good neighbourliness and the peaceful\r\ncoexistence of nations and confidence-building\r\nmeasures. In the light of the impact of that important\r\nand delicate issue on the security and the stability of\r\nthe Arab Gulf region and on the entire world, the\r\nUnited Arab Emirates, along with other countries of\r\nthe Gulf Cooperation Council, looks forward to the\r\nIranian Government’s review of its policy in that\r\nregard. We also hope that Iran will take a transparent\r\nand objective approach in its response to the repeated\r\npeaceful initiatives of the countries of the region,\r\nwhich call for the end of Iran’s occupation of the three\r\nislands belonging to the United Arab Emirates and the\r\ncreation of a positive regional environment conducive\r\nto the strengthening of cooperation, good\r\nneighbourliness and mutual advantage among the\r\nregion’s countries and to prosperity and stability for its\r\npeoples.\r\nWe are hopeful that the political transition\r\nprocess in Iraq will be completed and, in that respect,\r\nwe renew our support for all efforts made by the Iraqi\r\nGovernment to strengthen political dialogue among the\r\nvarious Iraqi factions, achieve national reconciliation\r\nand rebuild its national institutions so that Iraq can\r\nmaintain its unity, territorial sovereignty, independence\r\nand stability, and can play its natural role in the region\r\nand the world.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates welcomes Israel’s\r\nwithdrawal from the Gaza Strip and parts of the\r\nnorthern West Bank and hopes that the international\r\ncommunity will urge Israel to complete its withdrawal\r\nfrom the Arab and Palestinian territories occupied\r\nsince 1967, including the Syrian Golan and the\r\nLebanese Shaba’a farms, dismantle the separation wall\r\nand discontinue its settlement plans and activities, in\r\naccordance with the resolutions of international\r\nlegitimacy, the Arab peace initiative based on the land-\r\nfor-peace principle, and the Quartet’s road map.\r\nFurthermore, the international community must\r\nstrengthen its support of the Palestinian Authority and\r\nhelp it rebuild its national institutions and exploit its\r\nnatural and economic resources.\r\nWe also demand that Israel accede to the Treaty\r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and\r\nsubmit its nuclear facilities to the supervision of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, in accordance\r\nwith the relevant United Nations resolutions calling for\r\nthe establishment of a zone free of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, including nuclear weapons, in the Middle\r\nEast and the Arab Gulf region.\r\nIn spite of the progress made in science and\r\ninformation technology, the international community\r\ncontinues to face a growing economic gap between the\r\nNorth and the South. Therefore, we call for further\r\ninternational efforts to address that imbalance,\r\nincluding the greater participation of developing\r\ncountries in decision-making in economic and trade\r\nmatters, and for the commitment of industrialized\r\nStates to continue their support for development\r\nprogrammes in the developing countries in order to\r\ncreate a fair and just international economic\r\nenvironment in which all peoples enjoy the benefits of\r\nprosperity, well-being and development.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates has developed\r\nhumanitarian and financial assistance programmes to\r\nassist developing countries and countries affected by\r\nconflicts, civil and regional wars and natural disasters.\r\nThat assistance exceeds the percentage recommended\r\nby international conferences on development and the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. In that context, the\r\nUnited Arab Emirates has adopted multifaceted\r\ndevelopment policies and plans to keep pace with\r\ninternational economic and development changes.\r\nThose policies include human resources development,\r\nthe opening of the country’s markets to foreign trade\r\nand the enhancement of the private sector’s role in\r\nnational development.\r\n26\r\nA/60/PV.13\r\nIn conclusion, we hope that our deliberations at\r\nthis session will result in a positive outcome that\r\nstrengthens our joint efforts to realize our peoples’\r\nhope and ambition to live in a world in which security,\r\nstability, peace, freedom and justice prevail.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Jean-François Ndongou, Deputy Minister to the\r\nMinister of State, Minister for Foreign Affairs,\r\nCooperation and Francophonie of Gabon.\r\nMr. Ndongou (Gabon) (spoke in French):\r\nMr. President, your election to the presidency of this\r\nsession of the General Assembly is indisputably an\r\nhistoric moment, which Gabon appreciates fully, since\r\nyour country has succeeded Gabon in this post. Thus, I\r\nshould like to congratulate you most warmly on behalf\r\nof my delegation and assure you of Gabon’s support\r\nthroughout your term. I should also like to express my\r\ngratitude to the Secretary-General for his immense,\r\nbold and tireless actions in favour of the reinvigoration\r\nand the restoration of the prestige of the United\r\nNations system. Allow me also to pay well-deserved\r\ntribute to the President of the fifty-ninth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, His Excellency Mr. Jean Ping,\r\nMinister of State and Minister for Foreign Affairs,\r\nCooperation and Francophonie of the Republic of\r\nGabon, for his outstanding contribution to the reform\r\nof our Organization.\r\nThe important document adopted last Friday by\r\nthe High-level Meeting testifies to this reform effort. I\r\ntherefore welcome the fact that you have invited us to\r\nfocus our debate on the follow-up to the measures\r\nadopted by the world leaders last week.\r\nToday, 60 years after its creation, the United\r\nNations has stood the test of time. The dysfunctions\r\nnoted recently highlight the need to press ahead with\r\nessential institutional reform. In that connection, a\r\ncomment by Montesquieu comes to mind and I quote,\r\n“When a good thing has disadvantages, it is better to\r\ndo away with the disadvantages than with the thing\r\nitself.” The author of The Spirit of Laws was\r\nsuggesting that we need to make a distinction between\r\nideals and human endeavour.\r\nMore than an end in itself, the reform process\r\nmust, whenever necessary, make it possible to adapt\r\nthe United Nations to the demands of the times and to\r\nthe many complex mandates entrusted to it. In this\r\ncontext, we should pay particular attention to the\r\nGeneral Assembly. It is the most representative forum\r\nof the international community, a site par excellence\r\nfor cooperation, for negotiation and for sharing\r\nresponsibilities.\r\nThe United Nations is the seat of legitimacy and\r\nmoral authority at the international level and it\r\nparticipates in the ideal of shared destinies of nations\r\nand the peoples of the world. This is why Gabon\r\nreiterates yet again its support for initiatives aimed at a\r\nconsensus-based reform of the Security Council, as the\r\nCouncil’s expansion should derive from the dual need\r\nfor representativity and effectiveness.\r\nOnce reformed, the United Nations can deal\r\nbetter with the many challenges facing humankind\r\ntoday, such as HIV/AIDS, environmental degradation,\r\nterrorism, armed conflicts and poverty. The HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic, which affects rich and poor nations alike\r\nwithout distinction, is a serious threat to sparsely-\r\npopulated countries such as Gabon. More than ever,\r\ndeveloping countries call upon the international\r\ncommunity to display effective and active solidarity in\r\norder to limit the worst effects of this pandemic.\r\nSince vaccine experiments have not yet been\r\nconclusive, and the therapeutic trials are still\r\ninsufficient, efforts must be focused on prevention and\r\non access to antiretroviral drugs in accordance with the\r\nagreement concluded within the context of the World\r\nTrade Organization. Gabon itself has taken solid\r\ninitiatives, ranging from awareness campaigns to the\r\nimplementation of action plans such as the\r\nmultisectoral strategic plan to combat AIDS, in which\r\nthe First Lady of Gabon, Madame Edith Lucie Bongo\r\nOndimba, is personally involved. We welcome the fact\r\nthat the final document of the High-level Meeting\r\nreaffirmed the commitment of the international\r\ncommunity to fight HIV-AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis\r\nand other infectious diseases.\r\nIt is undeniable that the global challenges are\r\nnumerous and interdependent. Environmental\r\ndegradation has become one of the main threats to life\r\non earth. The consequences of climate change caused\r\nby human activity are at the root of natural disasters\r\nthat are unprecedented in scale. The future of\r\ngenerations to come is thus compromised. It is in this\r\ncontext that the concept of sustainable development,\r\nwhich means in fact intergenerational solidarity, must\r\nbe made systematic, so as to underlie both public and\r\nprivate policies.\r\n27\r\nA/60/PV.13\r\nCertainly, the Stockholm conference in 1972 that\r\nled to the establishment of the United Nations\r\nEnvironment Programme, the Rio Conference on\r\nEnvironment and Development in 1992 and the\r\nJohannesburg Conference in 2002 were important\r\nstages in the growing awareness of the international\r\ncommunity. But, we can and must do better. The\r\nFrench proposal aimed at creating a United Nations\r\norganization for the environment, in addition to\r\nexisting mechanisms, seems to us in this respect very\r\ntimely. We should ensure follow-up to this idea, as\r\nproposed by the final document of the High-level\r\nMeeting. Likewise, following an integrated approach,\r\nwe support the actions taken by the International\r\nOrganization of la Francophonie to promote the\r\nenvironment and sustainable development. The most\r\nrecent Summit of Heads of State of la Francophonie,\r\nwhich was held in Ouagadougou from 26 to\r\n27 November 2004, adopted a document along these\r\nlines entitled “A strategic ten-year framework for\r\nbiodiversity and the protection of the environment\r\nthroughout the francophone area”.\r\nThe common heritage of the environment must be\r\nthe subject of more ambitious and more generous\r\ninternational cooperation that seeks to reduce the gap\r\nbetween two sets of partners that often have\r\ncontradictory expectations, that is, on the one hand, the\r\ndeveloped countries, and, on the other, the developing\r\ncountries.\r\nWhat can we say about terrorism, that tentacled\r\ncreature, that inscrutable threat, whose ubiquity evades\r\nvigilance and even punitive measures? Friendly\r\ncountries have recently endured tragic experiences, and\r\nothers, unfortunately, have them nearly every day. It\r\nhas to be said that on 11 September 2001 terrorism\r\nsounded the death knell for any feeling of safety.\r\nOne of the notable points of the final documents\r\nof the High-level Meeting of last week is the firm and\r\nunambiguous condemnation of terrorism in all its\r\nforms and manifestations. This is notable progress that\r\nwill, I am sure, facilitate the efforts of the international\r\ncommunity aimed at adopting a comprehensive\r\nconvention on international terrorism, a task on which\r\nthe sixtieth session of the General Assembly must\r\nfocus and to which it must devote itself.\r\nWishing to support the efforts of the international\r\ncommunity to stem this scourge, the Head of State of\r\nGabon has just signed the International Convention for\r\nthe Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. “Peace\r\nwithin, peace with others and peace amongst others” is\r\na tradition on which Gabon prides itself, a tradition\r\nthat reflects the purposes and principles of the Charter\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nAt the beginning of the third millennium, many\r\nAfrican countries were still in the grip of instability\r\nand armed conflicts. To find a way out of that impasse\r\nand steer towards a more stable and prosperous Africa,\r\nAfrican heads of State and Government set up\r\nmechanisms within the African Union such as the\r\nPeace and Security Council, which seeks to manage\r\npolitical crises and intra-State conflicts. The objective\r\nof the African States is to equip themselves with the\r\nmeans to ensure their own security. It is clear that\r\nregional mechanisms cannot manage indefinitely\r\nwithout bilateral agreements, multilateral cooperation\r\nand other relevant alliances. In this respect, allow me\r\nto commend the active role taken by the United\r\nNations in maintaining peace in Africa, particularly in\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, Côte d’Ivoire\r\nand the Sudan.\r\nWe also note with satisfaction NATO’s\r\nwillingness to accept the unprecedented invitation of\r\nthe African Union, made by the Chairman of the\r\nCommission, Alpha Oumar Konaré.\r\nAllow me also to stress here the role played by\r\nGabon in all of these peace processes, which have\r\nresulted in a gradual improvement in the security\r\nsituation on the continent. The President of the\r\nRepublic of Gabon, El Hadj Omar Bongo Ondimba,\r\nhas been fully involved, along with his African peers,\r\nin the resolution of African crises — consistently\r\noffering his good offices and mediation services\r\nwhenever requested.\r\nGiven the current situation in the Sudan, with the\r\ntragic death of the Vice-President, John Garang, the\r\ninternational community as a whole must ensure that\r\nthe ceasefire agreement signed in January 2005\r\nholds — a necessary condition for the consolidation of\r\npeace and peacebuilding. I call on the parties\r\nconcerned to respect their commitments in order that\r\nthe peace process now under way may be concluded.\r\nWith respect to Central Africa, we welcome the\r\nrelative calm seen in countries that were recently in\r\ncrisis, particularly in the Central African Republic,\r\nBurundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. I\r\nshould like here to welcome the conclusion of the\r\n28\r\nA/60/PV.13\r\nelectoral process in Burundi and to express thanks for\r\nthe contribution made by the United Nations, the\r\nAfrican Union and South Africa.\r\nGabon, which made its own modest contribution\r\nto the process, humbly encourages all of the new\r\nleaders to display political clear-sightedness and\r\ntolerance, with a view to the achievement of lasting\r\npeace. Their decision to create a Peacebuilding\r\nCommission will no doubt help to enhance the United\r\nNations peacekeeping machinery.\r\nAs regards the economy, I need hardly recall that\r\ndebt represents a major handicap for our countries.\r\nIndeed, nearly a third of our financial resources are\r\ndevoted to debt servicing. Thus once again we would\r\ndraw the attention of the international community to\r\nthe specific situation involving the indebtedness of\r\nmiddle-income countries like Gabon.\r\nIndeed, Gabon remains the only country in sub-\r\nSaharan Africa classified as a high-level middle-\r\nincome country, thus making it ineligible for the\r\nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt\r\nInitiative, despite the political and economic reforms\r\nunder way for more than a decade. The current surge in\r\nthe price of oil — our State’s main budget resource —\r\nfurther fuels the illusion of a monetary surplus and\r\ndoes not really help us in the area of development\r\nfinancing, since the oil bonus basically goes to service\r\nexternal debt.\r\nIt is true that at the Gleneagles, United Kingdom,\r\nsummit last July, endorsing the London Declaration of\r\n11 June 2005, the G-8 countries and other donors\r\nundertook important commitments. Gabon, for its part,\r\nwould like to see those commitments translated into\r\naction, so as to increase the likelihood of achieving the\r\nMillennium Development Goals, to which my country\r\nis particularly committed.\r\nI also welcome the fact that the summit’s final\r\ndocument recognized the urgent need to redouble\r\nefforts to achieve development objectives agreed at the\r\ninternational level, including the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to express the hope\r\nthat the work of the General Assembly at its sixtieth\r\nsession will be crowned with success, so that together\r\nwe can work to bring about a community of peoples\r\nand nations living in peace, security and stability. May\r\nGod inspire our work.\r\nThe President: I commend speakers for their\r\ndiscipline in abiding by the time limit for speeches.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1 p.m.\r\n"
