(Sweden)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Bingu Wa Mutharika, President of\r\nthe Republic of Malawi\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Malawi.\r\nMr. Bingu Wa Mutharika, President of the\r\nRepublic of Malawi, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Bingu Wa Mutharika,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Malawi, and to invite him\r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Mutharika: I wish at the outset to\r\ncongratulate you on your election as President of the\r\nsixtieth session of the United Nations General\r\nAssembly and also for the excellent manner in which\r\nyou and your Bureau are steering the work of this\r\nsession. I would like to assure you of my delegation’s\r\nfull support. I further commend His Excellency\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, our Secretary-General, for the\r\ndynamic and sterling leadership of the United Nations.\r\nThe theme of this session is germane to the\r\nproposals for reform of the Organization. There is the\r\nimperative of taking stock of its strengths and weaknesses\r\nso that we can create a better future. Within the context of\r\nthis theme, the Secretary-General, through his report\r\nentitled “In larger freedom”, has made important\r\nproposals that will make the United Nations more\r\neffective and credible. The proposals aim at enabling the\r\nUnited Nations to provide the required leadership in the\r\nimplementation of the global development agenda and\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).\r\nMy country, Malawi, has followed closely the\r\ndebate on the report. I feel that, from the diverse\r\nopinions that have been expressed, a consensus is\r\nemerging on the need to implement United Nations\r\nreforms and make the Organization respond more\r\neffectively to the challenge of change.\r\nLet me, however, express the view that, in\r\naddition to the reform of the Security Council, there\r\nare other equally important reforms of the United\r\nNations that are critical to the realization of the global\r\ndevelopment agenda. I will turn to these later. For the\r\nmoment, it is critical that we remain focused so that all\r\nelements of the reform receive our undivided attention.\r\nMr. President, let me assure you that Malawi\r\nappreciates the role played by the international\r\ncommunity and the United Nations in the efforts to\r\neradicate poverty and promote development and\r\nprosperity for all. The just-ended High-level Plenary\r\nMeeting is one such initiative that offers great hopes\r\nfor the way forward. However, previous experience has\r\ntaught us that a lot is generally said and promised\r\nwithin the United Nations, but little or nothing is\r\ndelivered. It is my earnest hope that the outcome of\r\nthis session will not turn out to be another talk show.\r\nMalawi faces serious problems in instituting an\r\neffective system of political and economic governance.\r\n2\r\nA/60/PV.14\r\nMy country continues to face critical challenges in\r\ndetermining our political agenda, which in turn affect\r\nour development efforts. We still face extreme poverty,\r\nfood shortages, hunger and malnutrition. HIV/AIDS\r\ncontinues to claim more lives. Malaria is still killing\r\nmillions each year.\r\nOver and above these problems, we face\r\nmounting domestic and external debt, an unfair and\r\ninequitable global trading system and the prevalence of\r\nconflicts and political instability. We therefore feel that\r\nfor any United Nations reforms to be meaningful, we\r\nneed assistance in the areas of good governance.\r\nIn Malawi, we are promoting good governance by\r\npursuing sound macro-economic policies, reduction in\r\npublic expenditure, bench-marking the activities and\r\nperformance of the civil service and fighting corruption\r\nat all levels. We have also instituted effective reforms\r\nof the private sector, and through dialogue the business\r\ncommunity is now responding positively to economic\r\nand social reforms. In many of these reforms, I can say\r\nthat we have made a good beginning.\r\nIt is for this reason that my Government\r\nwelcomed the establishment of the African Peer\r\nReview Mechanism under the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) of the African Union.\r\nOur accession to the African Peer Review Mechanism\r\nis a manifestation of our desire to adopt policies and\r\npractices that emphasize accountability and\r\ntransparency in public sector management.\r\nMalawi has made efforts to implement the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. Our report, entitled\r\n“Malawi and the Millennium Development Goals:\r\nchallenges and achievements”, has been circulated.\r\nHowever, my country is facing severe constraints in\r\nimplementing the MDGs because we are allocating a\r\nsignificant amount of limited resources to servicing\r\nexternal debt and for managing the HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic, at the cost of the social and economic\r\ntransformation necessary to fight poverty.\r\nMalawi, therefore, supports the proposal to find\r\ncomprehensive and durable solutions to the external\r\ndebt problem. In this regard, we welcome the recent\r\nproposal by the G-8 to cancel 100 per cent of\r\noutstanding debt owed by 18 countries, including 14\r\nfrom Africa. I would like to appeal to all creditors to\r\nfollow this noble example, because debt cancellation\r\nhas the potential to assist the poor countries in\r\nachieving the MDGs and, hence, attaining national\r\neconomic recovery and economic transformation.\r\nAnother challenge for Malawi is that my country\r\nfinds it hard to be integrated into the global trading\r\nsystem, partly due to the lack of products that meet\r\nhigh quality standards, but also due to an unfair and\r\ninequitable global trading system. We therefore join the\r\nappeal for the speedy completion of the World Trade\r\nOrganization Doha Round of multilateral trade\r\nnegotiations in order to assist poor countries, such as\r\nMalawi, to benefit from global trade. Furthermore,\r\nthere is need to provide immediate duty-free and\r\nquota-free market access for all exports from the least\r\ndeveloped countries, including the elimination of all\r\nnon-tariff barriers, such as trade distorting subsidies\r\nand domestic support, especially in agriculture, by\r\ndeveloped countries.\r\nIn the African perspective, development efforts\r\nhave also been heavily undermined by the prevalence\r\nof conflicts and political instability in many parts of\r\nthe continent. Realizing this, we in Africa have taken\r\nbold and far-reaching initiatives to promote peace and\r\nsecurity on the continent. For instance, my own\r\ncountry, Malawi, has participated in peacekeeping\r\nactivities in Liberia, the Sudan and the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo.\r\nI commend the role played by the United Nations\r\nSecurity Council and the G-8 in supporting the African\r\nUnion’s initiatives in conflict resolution and\r\nmanagement. I also wish to draw the attention of this\r\nAssembly to the fact that peacekeeping in Africa\r\nconstitutes the bulk of the Security Council’s work. I\r\ntherefore earnestly believe that the role of the United\r\nNations in Africa can be enhanced by encouraging\r\nAfrica’s representation in the Security Council. In that\r\nregard, Africa’s call for the expansion of the Security\r\nCouncil should be supported by the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic poses serious social\r\nand economic challenges to Africa. However, the\r\nGeneral Assembly may be interested to know that\r\nMalawi is one of the few success stories in managing\r\nthe HIV/AIDS pandemic. The people of Malawi have\r\nwelcomed the provision of voluntary counselling and\r\nof free anti-retroviral drugs. For instance, since the\r\nmiddle of last year, we have established more than 30\r\nanti-retroviral clinics throughout the country and have\r\ntreated many people. We expect that by this time next\r\n3\r\nA/60/PV.14\r\nyear, we will have been able to treat more than 80,000\r\npeople.\r\nI therefore welcome the call at the High-level\r\nPlenary Meeting to provide, as a priority, assistance for\r\nHIV/AIDS prevention, care and treatment in African\r\ncountries on a grant basis. I also welcome the emphasis\r\nplaced on the need to encourage pharmaceutical\r\ncompanies to make anti-retroviral drugs affordable and\r\naccessible in Africa. My Government appeals for more\r\nfunding to enable us to adopt a holistic approach that\r\ntakes into account the medical, economic, political and\r\nsocial impacts of HIV/AIDS on the implementation of\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals.\r\nI take this opportunity to commend all countries\r\nthat continue to make contributions to the Global Fund\r\nto Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. The Fund\r\nhas enabled Malawi to introduce free anti-retroviral\r\ntreatment programme for those infected by HIV/AIDS.\r\nIn terms of agriculture and food security, Malawi\r\nhas not fared well this year. My country is facing\r\nsevere food shortages owing to the drought that we\r\nhave had since January this year. As a result of a very\r\npoor harvest, we shall require approximately 270,000\r\nmetric tons to feed some 4.2 million people who will\r\nbe in need of food until the next harvest season,\r\nsometime in April or May next year. I therefore appeal\r\nto the world community to help us to obtain more food\r\nsources for our people.\r\nI am grateful for the pledges of relief food\r\nassistance made by our cooperating partners such as\r\nthe World Food Programme, the British Government,\r\nthe European Union, the Japanese Government, the\r\nUnited States Government, the Belgian Government\r\nand the Norwegian Government. We are also grateful\r\nto the Secretary-General for the special appeal he has\r\nmade for Southern Africa.\r\nI am pleased to announce that the people of\r\nMalawi are also doing something to feed themselves.\r\nWe have made provision in our budget to buy food for\r\nour people. We have also established a Feed-the-Nation\r\nFund, through which people in Malawi from all walks\r\nof life are making voluntary donations to purchase\r\nfood for the poorest of the poor. The response has been\r\noverwhelming.\r\nWith a view to a medium- to long-term solution,\r\nwe have adopted concrete policies aimed at reducing\r\nour dependence on rain-fed agriculture. We have\r\nestablished a full ministry responsible for water\r\ndevelopment and irrigation. We look forward to\r\ntechnical assistance from those countries that have\r\nexpertise in the area of irrigation.\r\nTurning to the subject of United Nations reform, I\r\nwish to bring to the attention of the General Assembly\r\nan important aspect of reform of the Organization,\r\nconcerning the determination of eligibility for United\r\nNations membership. As members are aware, the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights guarantees the\r\nright of all the world’s peoples to belong to the United\r\nNations and that no country should be denied\r\nmembership in the Organization. Malawi believes that\r\nthe United Nations was founded on the principle of\r\ninclusivity in its membership.\r\nThat is why we in Malawi call for the admission\r\nof the Republic of China (Taiwan) as a Member of the\r\nUnited Nations. That request is made on the premise\r\nthat, following the collapse of communism in Eastern\r\nEurope and in the Soviet Union, the new States that\r\nemerged therefrom expressed their desire to become\r\nsovereign and independent Members of the United\r\nNations. They were granted membership. That was a\r\npolitical decision. In the same way, when the Socialist\r\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia broke up into the\r\nseparate States of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia,\r\nMacedonia, Serbia and Montenegro and Slovenia, each\r\nState was admitted into the United Nations. That also\r\nwas a political decision. Czechoslovakia broke up into\r\nthe Czech Republic and Slovakia, and each of those\r\nStates was admitted into the United Nations. In South-\r\nEast Asia, Singapore pulled out of the Federation of\r\nMalaya and became a Member of the United Nations.\r\nLater, East Timor broke away from Indonesia and was\r\nalso admitted as a Member. Those were political\r\ndecisions.\r\nThe Government of Malawi is therefore puzzled\r\nthat the Republic of China (Taiwan), which took a\r\nsimilar political decision, is denied membership in the\r\nUnited Nations. How can the United Nations stand for\r\nequity and justice when it is denying membership to\r\nmore than 23 million people who contribute\r\nsignificantly to global trade and development? How\r\ncan the United Nations justify its denial of membership\r\nto Taiwan when, in fact, the countries listed above\r\nwere admitted? Why is Taiwan being discriminated\r\nagainst in the United Nations?\r\n4\r\nA/60/PV.14\r\nUnless those questions are honestly answered,\r\nobservers will conclude that the United Nations is\r\napplying a double standard. The Government of\r\nMalawi believes that the United Nations should use the\r\nsame standard to grant membership to the Republic of\r\nChina. I therefore appeal to the United Nations,\r\nthrough you, Mr. President, to extend membership to\r\nthe Taiwanese people in the same way as it has done\r\nfor countries of Eastern Europe and South-East Asia.\r\nThat would enable the dynamic and resourceful people\r\nof Taiwan to play their rightful role in global affairs,\r\nindustrialization, trade and development. I believe that\r\nthe admission of the Republic of China (Taiwan) into\r\nthe United Nations would also bring credibility to the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights.\r\nLong live the United Nations!\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Malawi for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Bingu Wa Mutharika, President of the\r\nRepublic of Malawi, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Al Hadji Yahya A. J. J. Jammeh,\r\nPresident of the Republic of the Gambia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of the\r\nGambia.\r\nAl Hadji Yahya A. J. J. Jammeh, President of the\r\nRepublic of the Gambia, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Al Hadji Yahya A. J. J.\r\nJammeh, President of the Republic of the Gambia, and\r\nto invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Jammeh: Let me begin by\r\ncongratulating you, Sir, on your election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixtieth\r\nsession. I have no doubt that, with your skills and vast\r\nexperience, you will guide our deliberations to a\r\nsuccessful conclusion. Let me also commend my dear\r\nfriend His Excellency Mr. Jean Ping, the outgoing\r\nPresident of the General Assembly, for the excellent\r\nmanner in which he directed the affairs of the fifty-\r\nninth session. In addition, I commend the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his leadership, especially in advancing the\r\nUnited Nations reform and revitalization agenda. My\r\ncountry has full confidence in his integrity and\r\ncompetence, which he has demonstrated over the years,\r\nboth as a staff member and at the helm of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nAs we celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the\r\nOrganization, we must pause and take stock of the\r\nrecord of our collective response to the many different\r\nglobal challenges that mankind has had to face. From a\r\nmembership of only 50 States at its inception, the\r\nOrganization has grown to 191 Members today. That\r\nrapid expansion, together with the sophistication that\r\nthe United Nations has acquired over the years, calls\r\nfor an assessment of its strengths and weaknesses with\r\na view to making it more effective. It is no secret that\r\nthe voice of the General Assembly has grown weaker\r\nover the years, that the credibility of our human rights\r\nprocedures and mechanisms has been reduced, that\r\ndemocracy, accountability and transparency in the\r\nSecurity Council have become blurred and that the\r\nEconomic and Social Council needs to be more\r\nrelevant and effective.\r\nOn several occasions since 1945, we have\r\nwitnessed instances of genocide, war crimes and\r\ncrimes against humanity, as well as the proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction. Civil strife and terrorism\r\nare undermining human and State security. Poverty,\r\nhunger and diseases still decimate countless\r\ncommunities, while our capacity to respond to\r\nhumanitarian crises needs to be reassessed and\r\nrevitalized.\r\nThis is the backdrop of the challenges we as an\r\norganization face. They do not represent failure; they\r\nsimply underscore that more needs to be done to make\r\nthe world a safer and better place for all of mankind.\r\nTherefore, as we celebrate our achievements, let\r\nus rededicate ourselves to remaining true to our\r\nmission and also fashion a new vision that captures the\r\nrealities of our world in the twenty-first century. In this\r\nconnection, my delegation would like to express its\r\ngratitude to the Secretary-General for the\r\ncomprehensive reform agenda he has laid out in his\r\nreport “In larger freedom: towards development,\r\nsecurity and human rights for all” (A/59/2005). We\r\nagree that the world needs to be steered towards a\r\ngreater focus on those larger freedoms.\r\nThe majority of the world’s people today are in\r\nchains — the chains of poverty and underdevelopment.\r\n5\r\nA/60/PV.14\r\nFor them, development means freedom from want,\r\nfreedom from fear and hunger and, above all, freedom\r\nto live in dignity. Reforming the United Nations so that\r\nit is better poised to more effectively address\r\nhumankind’s quest for these larger freedoms, is a real\r\nnecessity for the greater relevance and impact of our\r\nOrganization.\r\nIndeed, the following objectives should be our\r\ncollective focus for the next decade: absolute poverty\r\nand its attendant woes such as diseases, hunger and\r\nilliteracy must be eliminated from the face of the earth;\r\nthe proliferation of nuclear and other weapons of mass\r\ndestruction must be halted and a total ban on nuclear\r\nweapons should be imposed on all States; peace must\r\nbe allowed to reign throughout the world; there must\r\nbe greater tolerance and mutual respect in dealing with\r\neach other’s differences; the world’s ecosystems and\r\nnatural resources must be judiciously conserved and\r\nutilized; political systems must work to achieve greater\r\ncooperation; multilateralism should replace unilateralism\r\nin dealing with conflicts, disputes or disagreements\r\nbetween Member States, and reconciliation should\r\nreplace confrontation and conflict.\r\nIf, in the next decade, we succeed in achieving\r\nthose objectives, we will have provided for ourselves\r\nthose larger freedoms that we crave today.\r\nWhile we must focus on those long-term\r\nobjectives, we must also not lose sight of the\r\nimperatives of our time. We must continue working in\r\nconcert towards the realization of global peace,\r\nassigning highest priority to those conflict situations\r\nthat pose the greatest threat to the peace of the whole\r\nworld. In this, we must begin with the Middle East.\r\nWithout a just solution to the Palestinian-Israeli\r\nconflict peace will continue to elude the Middle East\r\nwith consequences that will affect the whole world. My\r\ndelegation supports the vision of a two-State solution,\r\nwith Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace\r\nand security. We also welcome Israel’s withdrawal\r\nfrom Gaza and the West Bank as a step towards a\r\ncomplete withdrawal from the rest of the occupied\r\nPalestinian territory.\r\nThe unstable situation in Iraq is causing\r\nundesirable ripples all over the world. The situation is,\r\nby no means, unconnected with the soaring price of oil,\r\nwhich is causing serious problems in the global\r\neconomy and threatening the economic gains made by\r\nmany developing countries. The sooner stability is\r\nbrought to the region, the better it will be for that\r\ncountry and the rest of the world.\r\nWe are encouraged by the positive contributions\r\nof the United Nations and the African Union towards\r\nthe peaceful resolution of conflicts in Africa.\r\nIn Guinea-Bissau, another milestone has been\r\nreached with the election of President Nino Vieira.\r\nAfter many years of trials and tribulation, the people of\r\nGuinea-Bissau have finally placed the country on a\r\nsolid path to recovery, peace and development. As\r\nChair of the Friends of Guinea-Bissau at the United\r\nNations, as well as a member of the Ad hoc Advisory\r\nGroup on Guinea-Bissau, my delegation calls for an\r\nearly convening of a donors conference to show\r\nsolidarity with the people of Guinea-Bissau and a\r\ncommitment to lasting peace in that country.\r\nEqually in Burundi, the democratic transition has\r\nbeen completed with the recent election of President\r\nPierre Nkurunziza. We extend to him and the people of\r\nBurundi, our heartiest congratulations and best wishes\r\nfor a new era of peace, stability and development.\r\nThis year has witnessed major strides towards\r\nsustainable peace in the Sudan. My delegation\r\ncommends the Government of the Sudan and the\r\nSudanese People’s Liberation Movement for their\r\ncommitment to that historic accord meant to bring\r\nlasting peace to the country. We are encouraged by the\r\nsteps they have taken so far to implement the accord,\r\nand it is my fervent hope that their collective\r\nleadership will continue tirelessly to pursue the Sudan\r\nof their dreams. We sympathize with all the Sudanese\r\npeople on the tragic death of their leader and Vice-\r\nPresident, Mr. John Garang, who did so much to\r\nadvance the peace process. We are confident that his\r\nsuccessor will continue in his footsteps until all the\r\npending issues are peacefully resolved.\r\nAn underlying factor in all of these conflicts is\r\nthe proliferation of small arms and light weapons. We\r\nmust commit ourselves to denying non-State actors,\r\nterrorists and organized criminal networks the\r\nacquisition of these weapons of mass terror. We shall\r\nhave an opportunity to further refine our response to\r\nthis scourge during the 2006 review of the United\r\nNations Programme of Action on Small Arms.\r\nOur Organization must be the ultimate defender\r\nof the rule of international law, to which all States in\r\nthe comity of nations must adhere. Any attempt to\r\n6\r\nA/60/PV.14\r\nweaken or undermine our rules-based international\r\nsystem should be rejected without compromise. An\r\ninstitution like the International Criminal Court, with a\r\nmandate to end impunity, deserves all the support it\r\ncan garner from the international community. The\r\nRome Statute is a beacon of hope to all of humanity,\r\nand my delegation appeals to those States that have not\r\nyet done so, to consider speedily becoming party to it.\r\nMy delegation strongly condemns the application\r\nof unilateral coercive measures as a means of settling\r\ndisputes. These measures have an adverse impact on\r\nthe lives of innocent people, who lack any means of\r\nrecourse or redress. We therefore call for the complete\r\nand immediate lifting of the sanctions imposed on Cuba.\r\nAs we clamour for reform and renewal of our\r\nOrganization, we should widen our horizons and\r\nundertake a sober and dispassionate reassessment of\r\nour policy towards the Republic of Taiwan. The\r\nconcerns of the 23 million hard-working and peace-\r\nloving people of that great country continue to be\r\nignored. The Republic of Taiwan is a democratic,\r\nsovereign State. Its democratically elected Government\r\ndefends the interests of the people of Taiwan in the\r\nworld. The Taiwanese people display the same concern\r\nwe all do about global problems such as international\r\npeace and security, HIV/AIDS, the spread of disease,\r\nenvironmental pollution, and all the other issues that\r\nengage us at the United Nations. Yet, they are not here\r\nat the table with us, contributing their share in the\r\nsearch for solutions to the problems that confront\r\nhumankind today. We therefore call on all the peace-\r\nloving nations of the world to support the participation\r\nof the Republic of Taiwan in all the affairs of the\r\nUnited Nations as a full Member without delay. The\r\ntwenty-first-century United Nations should include all\r\npeople the world over without political discrimination.\r\nThe United Nations should also be committed to that\r\ngoal: a twenty-first-century, reformed United Nations\r\nthat includes the people of the Republic of Taiwan.\r\nTheir plight is more sharply amplified by our present\r\npreoccupation with the conflicts raging today that pose\r\na serious threat to international peace and security.\r\nThe reform agenda has been with us for decades\r\nnow. Finally, this year, a number of reports, including\r\none by the Secretary-General himself, seem to have\r\nspurred all of us to action.\r\nMy delegation fully supports the proposed reform\r\nof the Economic and Social Council and endorses the\r\nestablishment of the Peacebuilding Commission. In\r\nthat regard, we hope that the wealth of experience\r\nwhich the United Nations has gathered over the years,\r\nespecially in dealing with countries emerging from\r\nconflict, will be brought to bear in elaborating the\r\nstructure, functions and mandate of the Commission.\r\nWe equally support the proposed reform of the\r\nCommission on Human Rights. However, we should\r\nremember that human rights are everyone’s concern\r\nand their enforcement is not the prerogative of a select\r\nfew. A smaller human rights body would reinforce that\r\nnotion and entrench the credibility crisis that the\r\ncurrent Commission suffers from. While the\r\nCommission may have structural deficiencies, it is its\r\nworking methods that we must focus on in order to\r\neliminate bias, subjectivity and selectivity.\r\nRevitalizing the General Assembly is equally\r\nlong overdue. It is time for the Assembly to be more\r\nassertive within the mandate accorded it by the Charter.\r\nThe reform of our Organization would be\r\nincomplete without Security Council reform. The\r\ncurrent size and composition of the Council makes a\r\nmockery of the larger membership of the United\r\nNations and the realities of the world today. No amount\r\nof politics or procrastination can silence Africa’s\r\nlegitimate quest for full representation on the Security\r\nCouncil. International peace and security are\r\neveryone’s business. Without reform and a thorough\r\nreview of the Council’s working methods, the\r\nlegitimacy of the decisions it takes will be increasingly\r\nquestionable.\r\nWe shall also have to look into the issue of the\r\nveto once again. The purpose for which the veto was\r\ninstituted and the grounds on which it was assigned 60\r\nyears ago are no longer valid in today’s world. In fact,\r\nAfrica’s position on the veto, which my delegation\r\nwholeheartedly supports, is that it should be abolished.\r\nIn fact, veto power should be given only to the General\r\nAssembly, to be exercised by a majority vote. If that is\r\ndone, the United Nations and the world will be able to\r\nboast of a universal democratic system that will usher\r\nin a new and more peaceful world order.\r\nThe Security Council as presently constituted is\r\nnot conducive to the maintenance of world peace and\r\nsecurity. If it cannot be reformed, it should be\r\nabolished and its mandate assigned to the General\r\nAssembly with decisions taken by a majority vote. In\r\nthat event, any action taken by the United Nations in a\r\n7\r\nA/60/PV.14\r\ngiven situation would be taken on behalf of all of us.\r\nThat would put a definitive end to unilateralism in\r\nresolving international disputes and issues.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof the Gambia for the statement he has just made.\r\nAl Hadji Yahya A. J. J. Jammeh, President of the\r\nRepublic of the Gambia, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Boniface Alexandre, Interim\r\nPresident of the Republic of Haiti\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Interim President of the Republic of\r\nHaiti.\r\nMr. Boniface Alexandre, Interim President of the\r\nRepublic of Haiti, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Boniface Alexandre,\r\nInterim President of the Republic of Haiti, and to invite\r\nhim to address the General Assembly.\r\nPresident Alexandre (spoke in French): At the\r\nvery outset of my remarks, both on my own behalf and\r\non behalf of the Haitian nation, I would like to express\r\nour sincerest congratulations to you, Sir, on your\r\nunanimous election to the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly at the sixtieth session. Your wealth of\r\nexperience in matters of security, human rights and\r\ndevelopment augur well for the success of our\r\ndiscussions.\r\nI would also like to pay tribute to Jean Ping,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Gabon, whose\r\nmoderation, sense of compromise and restraint won\r\nhim universal respect and esteem during the previous\r\nsession.\r\nMay I also express my sincere gratitude to the\r\nSecretary-General for his tireless efforts in the cause of\r\npeace, democracy and development. That triad —\r\npeace, democracy and development — is now the new\r\nname for progress made by peoples and for stability in\r\nthe world.\r\nIt is in that context that, for more than a year\r\nnow, the Organization has deployed the United Nations\r\nStabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), which is\r\nhelping to improve the security climate in the country.\r\nWe requested the Mission because of our firm belief in\r\ninternational solidarity. We would like to take this\r\nopportunity to thank all those countries that have\r\ndisplayed their friendship to Haiti by contributing in\r\none way or another to the deployment of MINUSTAH.\r\nFrom this rostrum, I would like to express my\r\nsincerest sympathy for the afflicted populations of the\r\nsouthern part of the United States of America that have\r\nbeen so tragically affected by the passage of Hurricane\r\nKatrina in August, one of the most devastating\r\nhurricanes ever to strike our continent. We would like\r\nonce again to express to the Government and people of\r\nthe United States our deepest compassion and our\r\nprofound solidarity in these trying times.\r\nOur Organization is now 60 years old. The\r\ncelebration of that anniversary will be a splendid\r\nextension of the High-level Plenary Meeting of heads\r\nof State or Government, which was intended as an\r\ninitial stocktaking of the implementation of the\r\ncommitments undertaken in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration.\r\nThe Government of Haiti supports the spirit of\r\nthe text adopted on 16 September, which broadly\r\nreviews the minimum objectives that the international\r\ncommunity intends to achieve by 2015. Likewise, the\r\nRepublic of Haiti supports all steps taken to increase\r\ndevelopment assistance through the use of funds of\r\nsolidarity at the international level.\r\nThe Government of Haiti attaches the greatest\r\nimportance to the proposal of the French Republic to\r\ncreate stable and lasting financing through innovative\r\nmechanisms in order to prevent and cure the major\r\npandemics of our time. I am pleased to note that many\r\nof the world’s leaders have received that proposal with\r\nthe greatest interest.\r\nWe also welcome various other initiatives,\r\nincluding the United Kingdom proposal for an\r\nInternational Financial Facility, which arranges for\r\nborrowing on the financial markets to increase\r\nassistance to the poorest countries, in particular for the\r\nfight against HIV/AIDS. It deserves our consideration.\r\nHowever, those efforts may not achieve their\r\nobjectives if a comprehensive solution to the debt\r\nproblem of the countries of the South is not found. It\r\nwould be a positive contribution to international\r\nsecurity to solve the debt problem by cancelling the\r\n8\r\nA/60/PV.14\r\ndebts of the least developed countries and helping\r\nthose countries overcome their financial difficulties by\r\nassisting their development. The Republic of Haiti\r\nunreservedly supports all negotiated, effective,\r\ncomprehensive and lasting initiatives of the United\r\nNations aimed at solving the distressing debt problem\r\nof the peoples of the poor countries.\r\nOn the sixtieth anniversary of our Organization,\r\nwe should heed the many calls for the reform of the\r\nUnited Nations. Certainly, significant progress is being\r\nmade, in particular the proposal to transform the\r\nCommission on Human Rights into a Human Rights\r\nCouncil. Chapter XIII of the Charter should be\r\nremoved, along with the references to trusteeship\r\ncontained in Chapter XII.\r\nWith respect to the Security Council, the\r\nRepublic of Haiti supports paragraph 153 of the\r\noutcome document, which proposes the early reform of\r\nthe Security Council in order to make it more broadly\r\nrepresentative, efficient and transparent and thus to\r\nfurther enhance the Council’s effectiveness and the\r\nlegitimacy degree of implementation of its decisions.\r\nIn that regard, I reaffirm the position of Haiti, as\r\nexpressed by Prime Minister Gérard Latortue, in favour\r\nof correcting the historical error of not having a\r\nrepresentative of the Latin American and Caribbean\r\nregion among the permanent members of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nThe Republic of Haiti is at the crossroads. In a\r\nfew weeks, general elections will be held throughout\r\nthe country to select the nation’s elected\r\nrepresentatives at all levels. The elections are\r\nthoroughly inclusive. All sectors and all political\r\nparties without exception are participating. Admittedly,\r\nthe road to completing the process has been difficult,\r\nmarked by the outbreak of violence and feverish\r\nmoments. Rediscovering freedom is not easy. During\r\nlong months, the country has lived in a situation\r\nbordering on chaos, in which armed bands have held\r\nmany of the capital’s neighbourhoods hostage and\r\ncommitted the worst atrocities. Fortunately, they have\r\nbeen, for the most part, held in check by the combined\r\nefforts of the Haitian National Police and the United\r\nNations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH).\r\nCalm is gradually returning. I am convinced that\r\nthe electoral campaign will take place in a peaceful\r\nclimate, in spite of the large number of presidential\r\ncandidates. At present, the horizon is brightening\r\nperceptibly, despite the desperate acts of ruthless\r\ngangs. Also, a national dialogue has been launched\r\ninvolving all relevant sectors of the country. The\r\npreparatory committee established for the purpose will\r\nshortly issue its report.\r\nIn that context, the Government and the people of\r\nHaiti are grateful to the United Nations and friendly\r\ncountries of all continents for their solidarity with Haiti\r\nand for their interest in the successful outcome of the\r\npresent elections. Nothing can now stop the march\r\ntowards pluralist and democratic elections, to be held\r\nin a climate of security ensured by the Haitian National\r\nPolice, with the support of MINUSTAH.\r\nHaiti’s chronic political instability and serious\r\nsocio-economic problems have compelled a great\r\nnumber of our fellow citizens to migrate to\r\nneighbouring shores considered to be more hospitable.\r\nHowever, tensions are now arising among a certain\r\nfringe sector of the local population of the host\r\ncountries. We request the leaders of those countries to\r\ndeal with that issue urgently in order to stop radicals\r\nfrom taking advantage of the situation and committing\r\nabuses against expatriate Haitians. For our part, we are\r\nopen to all negotiations aimed at restoring calm and\r\nfinding solutions in accordance with international\r\ntreaties and rights related to immigration.\r\nAt this decisive moment of the transition, we\r\nrenew our appeal to the international community to\r\nvisit us to observe the holding of the elections. We\r\nwant transparent elections in which the candidates\r\nelected will not be challenged. We are grateful to the\r\nUnited Nations for the support that it is providing to\r\nHaiti during this critical period.\r\nI reiterate the solemn appeal that I made from this\r\nrostrum one year ago to the international community\r\nnot to leave Haiti isolated, so that, on 7 February 2006,\r\nI can hand over power to a new, freely elected\r\nPresident, thereby placing Haiti once and for all in the\r\ncommunity and comity of democratic nations; so that\r\nthe Government which emerges from the elections can\r\nget down to the challenging task of economic\r\nreconstruction and social progress — with, of course,\r\nthe resolute support and unflagging solidarity of the\r\ninternational community; so that Haiti can emerge from\r\nunderdevelopment and extreme poverty, which provide\r\nfertile ground for all dictatorships; and so that the\r\ncountry can finally recover its unity and its soul.\r\n9\r\nA/60/PV.14\r\nIn that spirit of solidarity and authentic\r\ncooperation — which is, after all, the raison d’être of\r\nthe United Nations — the Republic of Haiti will work\r\nto achieve, between now and 2015, the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, to which all countries aspire.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the Interim\r\nPresident of the Republic of Haiti for the statement he\r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Boniface Alexandre, Interim President of the\r\nRepublic of Haiti, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nItem 9 of the provisional agenda (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by The Honourable Maatia Toafa,\r\nPrime Minister, Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\nand Labour of Tuvalu\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs and Labour of Tuvalu.\r\nThe Honourable Maatia Toafa, Prime Minister\r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs and Labour of\r\nTuvalu, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Excellency The Honourable Maatia\r\nToafa, Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\nand Labour of Tuvalu, and inviting him to address the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMr. Toafa (Tuvalu): The people of Tuvalu, on\r\nwhose behalf I have the honour to speak, join me in\r\nextending our warmest congratulations to the United\r\nNations on the occasion of its sixtieth anniversary.\r\nI wish to put on record our profound gratitude to\r\nevery single member of this great body for the\r\nimmense achievements of the United Nations. The\r\nOrganization’s noble values and principles have indeed\r\nensured that even small and isolated nations such as\r\nTuvalu can enjoy the goals of self-determination and\r\nstatehood with dignity and hope. We are proud to be a\r\nmember of this great family of Nations.\r\nWe also wish to join others in congratulating you,\r\nSir, on your election to the presidency, and to assure\r\nyou of our full support and cooperation.\r\nLast week the world — our families and our\r\nchildren — heard from us that the time for stating\r\nprinciples and defining problems and actions on the\r\ncomplex challenges of development, security and\r\nhuman rights has long passed. It is now time to take\r\naction. But how the rhetoric gets translated into actions\r\nto improve standards of living for each nation, and for\r\nour families, for women and children in our\r\ncommunities and villages, in an equitable and fair\r\nmanner, is now the main challenge. The United Nations\r\nmust play the central role in managing that process.\r\nTuvalu is greatly encouraged by the prevailing\r\ngoodwill to fulfil the many international development\r\ntargets. The commitments made, by the European\r\nUnion and others, to meet the United Nations target of\r\n0.7 per cent of gross national product for official\r\ndevelopment assistance is very welcome. We also\r\nwelcome new and innovative initiatives on financing\r\nand good governance, including the global Democracy\r\nFund, the French initiative and others. The\r\ncommitment of the United States of America to its\r\nMillennium Challenge Account initiative is also very\r\nwelcome.\r\nAs a small island developing State and a least\r\ndeveloped country which has consistently taken a\r\nprudent and responsible approach to its own national\r\ndevelopment, Tuvalu is very encouraged, in particular,\r\nby the renewed recognition by the international\r\ncommunity of the special vulnerabilities of small island\r\ndeveloping States, of the needs of least developed\r\ncountries and of the imperative to address them.\r\nIncreased international cooperation to ensure the\r\nfull and effective implementation of the Mauritius\r\nStrategy for small island developing States and the\r\nBrussels Programme of Action, particularly with\r\nregard to the provision of adequate financing, capacity-\r\nbuilding and technology development and transfer, is\r\ncritical to supporting the poverty reduction and\r\nsustainable development efforts of the least developed\r\ncountries and small island developing States like\r\nTuvalu. There is now a clear need to establish clear\r\nvessels of connectivity from international\r\ncommitments to national strategies, plans and actions\r\non the ground.\r\nIn this regard, I am pleased to announce the\r\nlaunch, last Friday here in New York, of Te Kakeega II —\r\nTuvalu’s national sustainable development strategies\r\nfor 2005-2015 — a commitment to action by the\r\n10\r\nA/60/PV.14\r\nGovernment and all stakeholders, including non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and island communities.\r\nWe sincerely appreciate the support of our friends\r\nin New York, bilateral partners and United Nations\r\nagencies, and we look forward to working closely with\r\nthe international community in advancing appropriate\r\npartnerships as a result of those strategies. In the same\r\nvein, the important role played by regional bodies,\r\nespecially those in the Pacific region, such as the\r\nCouncil of Regional Organizations for the Pacific, in\r\nsupporting national efforts ought to be given\r\nrecognition and support. We therefore strongly support\r\nthe remarks by Samoa and Papua New Guinea on the\r\nimportance of regional arrangements, such as the\r\nPacific Plan.\r\nSecurity challenges continue to create worldwide\r\nhavoc, fear and uncertainty. Terrorist acts the world\r\nover, including the recent bombings in London and\r\nelsewhere have proven the continued existence of\r\nforces bent on undermining the United Nations\r\nfounding goals of freedom, peace and security. They\r\nhave also underscored the urgency with which we, the\r\nUnited Nations, must collectively combat these forces.\r\nTuvalu is fully committed to joining the fight\r\nagainst international terrorism, as required by Security\r\nCouncil resolutions. But we would need to seek the\r\nassistance of the United Nations and the international\r\ncommunity to help us fulfil the requirements,\r\nparticularly on reporting, of these resolutions and of\r\nthe international anti-terrorism conventions.\r\nThe threat of the impact of climate change, sea\r\nlevel rise and variability on the entire global\r\nenvironment continues to be a matter of serious\r\nsecurity concern to all. For small island and low-lying\r\ncoastal countries like Tuvalu the situation is\r\ndevastating, threatening lives, human rights and our\r\nlong-term survival. The impacts are real and already\r\nhappening. They demand urgent actions by the\r\ninternational community. As correctly underscored by\r\nthe Secretary-General in his report, “In larger\r\nfreedom”, “Without action, [small island developing\r\nStates] will pay a bitter price for the actions of others”\r\n(A/59/2005, para. 60). There cannot be a more true\r\nassertion.\r\nWhile we are all deeply touched by the human\r\nloss and destruction suffered from Hurricane Katrina\r\non the Gulf Coast of the United States of America three\r\nweeks ago, the world will be better advised to take\r\nsuch timely warnings seriously. Tuvalu strongly\r\nbelieves we must urgently address adaptation and\r\nmitigation actions against climate change in line with\r\nthe objectives of the United Nations Framework\r\nConvention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol\r\ntargets to reduce greenhouse gases and advance the\r\ndevelopment and use of renewable sources of energy.\r\nOn the latter subject, it would be remiss of\r\nTuvalu not to again sincerely acknowledge the coming\r\ninto force of the Kyoto Protocol early this year and to\r\nurge all industrialized countries who have not done so\r\nto ratify it as soon as possible. Not to do so will be to\r\nsign on Tuvalu’s death warrant.\r\nThe time is also ripe to initiate dialogue on a\r\nmore comprehensive approach for future actions\r\nagainst climate change where all major emitters of\r\ngreenhouse gases will need to participate. The eleventh\r\nsession of the Conference of Parties to the United\r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to\r\nbe held at Montreal in November, must advance\r\ndecisions on critical issues on future actions against\r\nclimate change.\r\nUnless actions are taken seriously, all efforts for\r\ndevelopment, security and human rights for those most\r\nvulnerable to the impacts of climate change will be\r\nseverely compromised. We appeal to those with the\r\ncapacity to do so to have a heart for islands like\r\nTuvalu, as well as for the rest of mankind.\r\nOn enhancing the relevancy and the role of the\r\nUnited Nations, we would like to reiterate our strong\r\nsupport for the reforms for the United Nations, in\r\nparticular the expansion of the permanent membership\r\nand working methods of the Security Council. In this\r\nvein we also reiterate our support for the consideration\r\nof Japan, Germany, India and Brazil for permanent\r\nseats on an expanded Council. We strongly feel that the\r\nmomentum so far achieved on the issue must be taken\r\nadvantage of to finally resolve the proposed reforms by\r\nthe end of December 2005, at the latest. We also\r\nbelieve more equitable representation of the\r\ndeveloping countries for the non-permanent seats of\r\nthe Council is vital and long overdue.\r\nTuvalu recognizes the seriousness of the\r\nHIV/AIDS epidemic on the social and economic\r\ndevelopment and security of Tuvalu and other Pacific\r\nisland countries. Given our exposure and the level of\r\nmobility of our communities, particularly our seafarers\r\nwho serve on merchant ships worldwide, there is an\r\n11\r\nA/60/PV.14\r\nurgent need for assistance from the international\r\ncommunity, such as that provided under the Global\r\nFund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, to\r\nhelp us raise awareness in Tuvalu to combat the threats\r\nof the epidemic. We need technical and financial\r\nassistance for these efforts.\r\nIn terms of natural resources, Tuvalu is really a\r\nbig ocean, small island country. The Pacific Ocean that\r\nsurrounds our islands provides the vital source of our\r\nlivelihoods and economic and social development.\r\nIncreasingly, however, we are becoming concerned\r\nwith the real threats of illegal, unreported and\r\nunregulated fishing and of pollution to the oceans from\r\nwaste, particularly from the trans-shipment of highly\r\nradioactive and toxic materials in our region. We\r\nwould need to seek the understanding of the\r\ninternational community to help us save our oceans and\r\nsupport fully the Pacific Islands Regional Ocean Policy\r\nadopted in 2002.\r\nAn important source of financial flows to\r\ndeveloping countries, particularly also to small island\r\ndeveloping nations such as Tuvalu, is migrant workers’\r\nremittances from developed countries. Indeed remittances\r\nfrom our overseas workers, and particularly Tuvaluan\r\nseafarers serving abroad, provide a substantive source\r\nof income so vital for social and economic\r\ndevelopment in Tuvalu.\r\nTuvalu fully supports the affording of urgent\r\nattention to the issue of migrant workers’ rights,\r\nincluding the maintenance of competency on\r\ninternational standards and migrant workers’ safety and\r\nsecurity, in the international agenda, in order to ensure\r\nsustaining this vital source of capital for small island\r\ndeveloping States.\r\nAn issue of continuing concerns to Tuvalu is the\r\nquestion of the representation in the United Nations.\r\nRegrettably, this august body cannot be said to be\r\nuniversal without the rightful representation of the 23\r\nmillion people of the Republic of China on Taiwan.\r\nTuvalu feels that recognizing the political and\r\ndemocratic developments in Taiwan, the active and\r\nresponsible participation of Taiwan in world affairs,\r\nespecially in trade, commerce, health, and international\r\ndevelopment, without representation in the United\r\nNations is unjust and morally wrong. This state of\r\naffairs needs to be corrected. We seek a proper review\r\nby the United Nations of this important issue, as well\r\nas the escalation of tension in the Taiwan Strait\r\nfollowing the enactment by the People’s Republic of\r\nChina of its “anti-secession law”.\r\nIn conclusion, we want to reiterate that efforts\r\naimed at the sustainable development of small island\r\ndeveloping States like Tuvalu, will be of no meaning\r\nunless the issue of climate change and sea level is\r\naddressed decisively, and with urgency. Tuvalu’s\r\ninterest is not self serving. The more serious\r\nconsequences of not acting now on climate change, as\r\nwe are already witnessing the world over, will be felt\r\neverywhere.\r\nIt is our fervent hope that out of this common\r\nhouse of our United Nations family, there will emerge\r\nbetter understanding and goodwill for the long lasting\r\nsecurity and survival of Tuvalu and the whole world.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Labour of Tuvalu for\r\nhis statement.\r\nThe Honourable Maatia Toafa, Prime Minister\r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs and Labour of\r\nTuvalu, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by The Honourable Pakalitha Bethuel\r\nMosisili, Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nDefence and Public Service of the Kingdom of\r\nLesotho\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Prime Minister and Minister for Defence\r\nand Public Service of the Kingdom of Lesotho.\r\nThe Honourable Pakalitha Bethuel Mosisili,\r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Defence and\r\nPublic Service of the Kingdom of Lesotho, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Excellency Pakalitha Bethuel Mosisili,\r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Defence and Public\r\nService of the Kingdom of Lesotho, and inviting him to\r\naddress the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Mosisili (Lesotho): My delegation associates\r\nitself with the compliments extended to you, Sir, on\r\nyour election to the presidency of this session and to\r\nyour predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Jean Ping of\r\nGabon.\r\nThe United Nations was born 60 years ago when\r\nthe brutality of war impressed itself on all as far\r\n12\r\nA/60/PV.14\r\nbeyond human comprehension and tolerance. The\r\nOrganization became a source of hope, founded as it\r\nwas on the inalienable, interlinked and mutually\r\ninterdependent pillars of development, human rights\r\nand security.\r\nMember States of this Organization have\r\nincreasingly yearned for its reform in order to make it\r\nmore democratic and responsive to the needs of all\r\nnations, rich and poor, big and small, strong and weak.\r\nWe should recall that the last reform of the United\r\nNations was in 1963, a good four decades ago. Against\r\nthis background, my delegation pays tribute to the\r\nSecretary-General for his report entitled “In larger\r\nfreedom: towards development, security and human\r\nrights for all” (A/59/2005). That report formed the\r\nbasis for discussions by Member States as they\r\nprepared for the five-year review of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration and for this sixtieth session of the General\r\nAssembly. It raises critical issues regarding the reform\r\nof this world body to enable it to meet the challenges\r\nand threats of the twenty-first century — a daunting\r\ntask indeed.\r\nHowever, we have noted with regret that some\r\nMember States have relegated to the back burner\r\ncritical issues of development, giving priority instead\r\nto security issues, particularly the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council. As a result of this trend, we foresee\r\nan emerging, untenable and, indeed, unwarranted\r\nsituation with the potential to divide regions and/or\r\ncontinents and to adversely affect cordial relations\r\nbetween States.\r\nIn order to move in unison, the international\r\ncommunity should strive to advance the global\r\ndevelopment, human rights and security agendas\r\nsimultaneously. All agree that the HIV and AIDS\r\npandemic has emerged as a major threat to\r\ndevelopment, reversing, as it does, all the gains that\r\nhave been made so far. We all also agree that the\r\nravages of extreme poverty continue to haunt us.\r\nNeedless to say, extreme poverty constitutes a violation\r\nof human dignity. Armed conflicts also hamper\r\ndevelopment. Africa presents a classical example of\r\nhow those menaces compromise not only peace and\r\nsecurity, but also development, thus militating against\r\nrespect for human rights.\r\nIndeed, it is no coincidence that development has\r\nbeen one of the key objectives of most, if not all, major\r\nUnited Nations conferences and summits in the\r\neconomic, social and related fields. Hence, my\r\ndelegation welcomes the efforts of those donor\r\ncountries that have achieved the 0.7 per cent target of\r\ngross national income as official development\r\nassistance (ODA), with 0.2 per cent of gross national\r\nincome for the least developed countries. We also\r\nwelcome initiatives by some countries to set up\r\ntimetables for fulfilling their ODA targets. However,\r\nwe reiterate our appeal that developed countries abide\r\nby their commitments to help developing countries in\r\nall the relevant areas. They have to accelerate and\r\nincrease the flows of ODA and foreign direct\r\ninvestment. They also have to adopt appropriate\r\nmeasures to fully integrate small and vulnerable\r\neconomies into the multilateral trading system, cancel\r\ndebt, transfer technology, render financial and\r\ntechnical assistance and provide capacity-building\r\nprogrammes for developing countries.\r\nOn this auspicious occasion, my delegation\r\nexpresses sincere appreciation for all initiatives\r\nrecently taken to address the needs of developing\r\ncountries, especially the debt cancellation extended by\r\nthe G-8 countries to highly indebted poor countries.\r\nHowever, we appeal for debt cancellation for all least\r\ndeveloped countries in order to enable them to redirect\r\ntheir meagre resources to national development\r\nprogrammes. It is an irrefutable fact that a substantial\r\npercentage of the national budgets of least developed\r\ncountries that do not fall within the Heavily Indebted\r\nPoor Countries Debt (HIPC) Initiative category is\r\nconsumed by servicing their debts.\r\nLesotho supports the launching of a series of\r\n“quick wins”, as recommended by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his report, as this would go a long way\r\ntowards broadening commitment to the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) and promoting economic\r\ngrowth in many developing countries. In our view, the\r\ncriteria for the selection of countries for the\r\nimplementation of the “quick wins” should be fair and\r\ntransparent.\r\nTerrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction to non-State actors, the existence of nuclear\r\nweapons, and armed conflict top the list of global\r\nsecurity issues. There is, therefore, an urgent need to\r\nconclude a comprehensive convention on terrorism.\r\nMy delegation hopes that the General Assembly will\r\nsoon initiate negotiations on an international\r\ninstrument to prevent the proliferation of weapons of\r\nmass destruction to non-State actors. We regret the fact\r\n13\r\nA/60/PV.14\r\nthat the 2005 Review Conference of the Parties to the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\n(NPT) was not able to reach consensus. However, we\r\nwish to emphasize the need for all States parties to\r\nadhere to the three pillars of the Treaty — namely,\r\ndisarmament, non-proliferation and peaceful uses of\r\nnuclear energy. We also wish to encourage the nuclear-\r\nweapon States that have not yet ratified or acceded to\r\nthe NPT and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\r\nTreaty to become parties to those important treaties.\r\nThe notorious use of small arms and light\r\nweapons in armed conflicts is well documented.\r\nLesotho therefore regrets the inability on the part of the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on small arms to adopt a\r\nlegally binding document. We also attach great\r\nimportance to the issue of prevention of internal armed\r\nconflicts by the international community. While we\r\nsupport the moral obligation behind the proposed new\r\nconcept of the “responsibility to protect”, we suggest\r\nthat the issue should be subjected to further\r\nconsideration by Member States, guided by the\r\nfundamental principles enshrined in the United Nations\r\nCharter. Needless to say, the sanctity of Article 51 of\r\nthe Charter should be preserved.\r\nThe Kingdom of Lesotho considers it the\r\nresponsibility of the international community, with the\r\nUnited Nations playing the central role, to put in place\r\neffective measures aimed at preventing genocide,\r\nethnic cleansing and the atrocities perpetrated on\r\nwomen and children caught up in armed conflict.\r\nConsequently, my delegation considers the enhanced\r\nrole of the major organs of the United Nations,\r\nparticularly the General Assembly, to be of paramount\r\nimportance. One of the major constraints of the United\r\nNations is that it lacks a mechanism designed to avoid\r\nState collapse and the slide into war, or to assist\r\ncountries in their transition from war to peace. It is\r\nwithin this context that Lesotho supports the proposed\r\nestablishment of a Peacebuilding Commission.\r\nIn the area of human rights, we support the\r\nelevation of the Commission on Human Rights to a\r\nHuman Rights Council, a body that would be apolitical\r\nand insist on the protection both of civil and political\r\nrights and of economic, social and cultural rights. For\r\nmy delegation, the flaws of the Commission lay mostly\r\nin its focus and not necessarily in its size.\r\nIt is in this twenty-first century that peace,\r\nsecurity, the right to self-determination, respect for all\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms must be\r\nguaranteed as the norm rather than the exception.\r\nHence, our call for the right to self-determination of\r\nthe Palestinian people and complete withdrawal from\r\ntheir occupied territories, the independence of the\r\nSaharawi people, the lifting of the unilateral economic\r\nembargo against the people of Cuba and the end to\r\narmed conflicts, particularly in Africa. These matters\r\nmust be addressed and resolved urgently,\r\ncomprehensively and honestly, without fear or favour,\r\nand without malice to anybody.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Defence and Public Service of the\r\nKingdom of Lesotho for the statement he has just\r\nmade.\r\nThe Honourable Pakalitha Bethuel Mosisili,\r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Defence and\r\nPublic Service of the Kingdom of Lesotho, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Deputy Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nLuxembourg, His Excellency Mr. Jean Asselborn.\r\nMr. Asselborn (spoke in French): Just a few days\r\nago, in this same Hall, the follow-up High-level\r\nMeeting was held on the Millennium, bringing together\r\nan unprecedented number of high political leaders from\r\nall over the world. After a process of discussion and\r\nnegotiation, both lengthy and thorough, we adopted\r\nwhat should serve as our road map for the period to\r\ncome. The final document should not only inspire but\r\nalso give specific direction to, the actions of the\r\ninternational community in the United Nations.\r\nWhile not all our expectations or ambitions were\r\nrealized in that document and considerable gaps cry\r\nout to be filled — I am thinking particularly of the\r\ncrucial areas of disarmament and non-proliferation —\r\nwe must, nevertheless, welcome the fact that around\r\nthe central pillars of the United Nations, namely,\r\ndevelopment, peace and human rights, broad agreement\r\nhas crystallized and a new international agenda has in\r\nfact emerged.\r\nIt is particularly appropriate and propitious that\r\nthe current regular session of the General Assembly\r\nhas opened immediately following on the important\r\nHigh-level Meeting. While we may feel that the\r\nfoundation was laid during that important event, what\r\n14\r\nA/60/PV.14\r\nwe have to do now is to complete what has been\r\nundertaken, consolidate the sections of walls that have\r\nbeen erected and build those parts that have only been\r\nsketched out — and here I am thinking particularly of\r\nthe Human Rights Council — and provide our project\r\nwith a sound roof.\r\nRenewal of multilateralism in the context of the\r\nspecial conditions at the beginning of this century and\r\nthe reform of the United Nations must be conducted\r\nwith determination, driven by a real sense of urgency\r\nin the light of the significance of the task that awaits us\r\nand the crucial matters at stake for billions of men and\r\nwomen.\r\nKnowing as I do, Sir, your personal commitment,\r\nyour dynamism and your numerous qualities, I am\r\nconvinced that you will direct the work of the sixtieth\r\nregular session of the General Assembly in such a way\r\nso as to ensure that we can, all together, carry out the\r\nurgent mandate entrusted to us by the High-level\r\nMeeting and, more particularly, by our peoples, who\r\nhave placed their hopes on a revamped and\r\nstrengthened United Nations system. It is in this spirit\r\nthat my country is prepared to subscribe with\r\nconviction to the accountability pact proposed by our\r\nSecretary-General, whom I would, once again, like to\r\ncongratulate for what he has been doing at the head of\r\nour Organization.\r\nI would note with satisfaction your intention, Sir,\r\nto present a detailed and operational workplan in order\r\nto organize our work as effectively as possible so that\r\nwe can complete the tasks awaiting us according to a\r\nfixed timetable. We have to provide concrete evidence\r\nthat our Assembly will not go back to business as usual\r\nonce the spotlights have been switched off.\r\nFor all those — and I am one of them — who\r\nbelieve that our Assembly, a veritable parliament of the\r\nnations of the world, has a paramount role to play in\r\nthe emergence of a strong political consensus at the\r\nworld level, the quick adoption of specific operational\r\ndecisions should deal a sound rebuff to all those\r\nCassandras, all those cynics and all those who uphold\r\nthe status quo that opposes change.\r\nIn his opening statement at the sixtieth regular\r\nsession of the General Assembly, our Secretary-\r\nGeneral clearly defined the mission that awaits us in\r\nthe coming months. Among the subjects that claim our\r\nattention, I would focus on the following: human\r\nrights, in order to strengthen the impact of this\r\nessential dimension in all the activities of the United\r\nNations, particularly through the immediate creation of\r\na Human Rights Council on the basis of the positive\r\ngroundwork laid in the preparatory work of the High-\r\nlevel Meeting; the establishment of the Peacebuilding\r\nCommission, an innovative body; the reform of the\r\nmain bodies of our Organization, including the urgent\r\nneed to enlarge the Security Council in both categories\r\nof membership in order to make the Council more\r\nrepresentative of the realities at the beginning of the\r\ntwenty-first century and to make it more transparent\r\nand more effective; giving concrete form to the idea of\r\n“the responsibility to protect”, whose confirmation in\r\nthe final document is one of the main breakthroughs of\r\nthe recent High-level Meeting; and finally, the reform\r\nof the administrative and financial management of the\r\nUnited Nations in order to consolidate the effectiveness\r\nand integrity of the Organization.\r\nLet me also devote a few minutes to the question\r\nof development. Development remains the main\r\npolitical and moral issue of our time. It must be noted\r\nthat progress towards the Millennium Development\r\nGoals has been uneven and some backward movement\r\nmust be acknowledged, particularly in sub-Saharan\r\nAfrica. The recently published Human Development\r\nReport notes that\r\n“In the midst of an increasingly prosperous\r\nglobal economy, 10.7 million children every year\r\ndo not live to see their fifth birthday, and more\r\nthan 1 billion people survive in abject poverty on\r\nless than $1 per day. The HIV/AIDS pandemic\r\nhas inflicted the single greatest reversal in human\r\ndevelopment. In 2003, the pandemic claimed 3\r\nmillion lives and left another five million people\r\ninfected.” (Human Development Report 2005, p. 1)\r\nIn view of these alarming facts, setting up and\r\ncreating a genuine partnership for development, based\r\non the groundwork of the Monterrey Conference and\r\non the basis of shared responsibility borne by both the\r\ndonor countries and the recipient countries, remains a\r\nmatter of priority. The countries of the South must take\r\ntheir own development in hand by defining detailed\r\nnational strategies that are effective and directed\r\ntowards good governance and combating corruption.\r\nThe countries of the North must fulfil their\r\ncommitments in matters of trade, debt reduction and\r\nenhancing the quality of aid and good practices.\r\nParticular emphasis should be laid on increasing\r\n15\r\nA/60/PV.14\r\nfinancial flows for development. In this connection,\r\nwhen Luxembourg occupied the presidency of the\r\nEuropean Union during the first half of this year, the\r\nmember States of the European Union took the historic\r\ndecision to commit themselves on a precise timetable\r\nto make a considerable increase of their official\r\ndevelopment aid (ODA) in order to achieve the target\r\nof 0.7 per cent of their gross national products by 2015\r\nat the latest. Four of the five countries, including my\r\nown, that have achieved or gone beyond 0.7 per\r\ncent — a target reconfirmed by the High-level\r\nMeeting — are member States of the European Union.\r\nThe Government of Luxembourg has confirmed its\r\nintention to increase its ODA contribution in the years\r\nto come to one per cent of its gross national income.\r\nUnfortunately, too often the fruits of development\r\nare erased by natural or man-made disasters. In the\r\nSudan, in the Great Lakes region and elsewhere, this\r\ntruth is demonstrated daily. There can be no\r\ndevelopment without security. There can be no security\r\nwithout development.\r\nThat is why I particularly welcome the agreement\r\nreached during the summit on the establishment of a\r\nPeacebuilding Commission. That should make it\r\npossible for us to contemplate the tremendous\r\nproblems of transition confronting the countries\r\nemerging from conflict from an overall viewpoint,\r\nbringing together the dimensions of crisis management,\r\nhumanitarian aid, reconstruction of State structures and\r\nlocal and legal structures and providing essential\r\npublic goods and services, while at the same time re-\r\nlaunching the process of economic and social\r\ndevelopment.\r\nOn the basis of the mandate given by the summit,\r\nLuxembourg actively supports the reform of the\r\nCentral Emergency Revolving Fund, which should take\r\nshape in coming months so that this renovated Fund\r\ncan become fully operational by the beginning of 2006.\r\nMy country has already announced, just a few days ago\r\nhere in New York, that it would be making a\r\ncontribution of $4 million to the capital of this Fund,\r\nand other States have also confirmed large\r\ncontributions.\r\nIf development is, according to the well-known\r\nformula, the new name of peace, we cannot fail,\r\nnevertheless, to note that numerous international\r\nconflicts and intra-State conflicts and hotbeds of\r\ntension continue to dot the face of the world.\r\nPeace and stability in the Middle East continue to\r\nbe at the forefront of our concerns.\r\nThe current President of the Council of the\r\nEuropean Union, my friend Jack Straw, recalled two\r\ndays ago from this rostrum the spirit in which the\r\nnegotiations on the nuclear issue were conducted with\r\nIran in recent months. Cooperation and respect for\r\ninternational norms and treaties, rather than\r\ndiscrimination or a desire to create dependency, were\r\nwhat motivated us in this case. In the Paris Agreement\r\nIran subscribed to a total suspension of all activities\r\nconnected with enrichment and all reprocessing\r\nactivities. It is that commitment that made it possible\r\nto develop political and economic cooperation with the\r\nEuropean Union. It is that commitment — which, I\r\nhardly need to recall, has been ratified by the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency — that I today\r\ncall upon Iran to respect.\r\nIn this context, I should also like to welcome the\r\nagreement that was reached just today with the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea to abandon all\r\nnuclear programmes and to rejoin the Nuclear Non-\r\nProliferation Treaty (NPT). This is excellent news.\r\nOn 22 June 2005, more than 80 countries and\r\norganizations met in Brussels at the International\r\nConference on Iraq, sponsored jointly by the European\r\nUnion and the United States, with the presence of our\r\nSecretary-General, and expressed their support for the\r\nIraqi Transitional Government and its political,\r\neconomic and security priorities. That important\r\nConference made it possible, in particular, for the\r\nStates members of the European Union to reaffirm\r\ntheir unanimous and united support for a secure, stable,\r\nunified, prosperous, democratic Iraq, respectful of\r\nhuman rights, which will benefit fully from the\r\nexercise of its sovereignty, cooperate constructively\r\nwith its neighbours and with the international\r\ncommunity, and end violence in that country. And it is\r\nour Organization that, more than ever, must be a\r\ndriving force, play a leading role, in that context.\r\nThe Near East has only rarely been the scene of\r\npositive developments. This is why I should like\r\nparticularly and expressly to welcome the political\r\ncourage of the leaders of the two sides regarding the\r\nsuccessful withdrawal from Gaza and certain parts of\r\nthe north of the West Bank. Now we should take\r\nadvantage of that positive dynamic to launch a genuine\r\npeace prospect based on the road map, which continues\r\n16\r\nA/60/PV.14\r\nto be the essential framework in this matter. The\r\nconditions to promote the emergence of a climate of\r\npeace were recalled by the European Council on 16 and\r\n17 June 2005. In particular, the fact that the Palestinian\r\nAuthority is taking control of Gaza now provides it\r\nwith an opportunity to demonstrate its institutional and\r\nadministrative maturity, particularly as regards\r\nmaintaining law and order and combating terrorism.\r\nThe cessation of all acts of violence by the parties is\r\nalso an essential requirement.\r\nRegarding the crucial question of Israeli\r\ncolonization activities in the occupied territories, the\r\nEuropean Council noted that “the policy of\r\ncolonization is an obstacle to peace and threatens\r\nmaking virtually impossible any solution based on the\r\ncoexistence of two States”. In the same context, the\r\nEuropean Council expressed concern at the\r\ncontinuation of the building of the separation barrier in\r\nthe occupied Palestinian territory, including East\r\nJerusalem and its surrounding areas, which contradicts\r\nthe pertinent provisions of international law. At the\r\nsame time, of course, the Council recognized the right\r\nof Israel to protect its citizens against attacks.\r\nLet us assume that the next meeting of the\r\nQuartet, which will be held in New York tomorrow,\r\nwill find political formulas that will make it possible to\r\ncontinue the positive dynamic of disengagement from\r\nGaza and will clear the way for a just and lasting peace\r\nin this divided part of our world.\r\nAs very often happens, patches of clouds and\r\nglimmers of hope are mingled when we analyse the\r\ninternational situation, but one thing remains constant,\r\nand that is the central role of the United Nations in the\r\nsearch for international peace and security. Sixty years\r\nafter the signing of the San Francisco Charter, we have\r\nall met together here to confirm our contract of\r\nconfidence with this Organization, the United Nations,\r\nwhich is our common heritage — a United Nations\r\nrenovated and reformed, synchronized with the threats\r\nand challenges of our times and able to respond to the\r\nexpectations of the peoples of the world. As a\r\nsignatory to the Charter in 1945, Luxembourg, as far as\r\nit is concerned, is ready to renew this pledge of\r\nconfidence with enthusiasm, confidence and\r\ndetermination.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Dermot Ahern, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Ireland.\r\nMr. Ahern (Ireland): Sixty years ago, our\r\npredecessors, having adopted the United Nations\r\nCharter, made sure that the United Nations\r\nimmediately got down to work. We need to act now\r\nwith the same urgency.\r\nIn the face of the profound challenges that\r\nconfront the world — some of long standing, some\r\nnew — our heads of State and Government last week\r\nagreed on a far-reaching agenda for change. Although\r\nthe summit did not achieve all that we had hoped for, it\r\nis still a major step forward.\r\nIt is now time for follow-up. On Saturday the\r\nSecretary-General proposed an accountability pact. He\r\nundertook to deliver on his obligations but said that\r\nwe, the Member States, must deliver on ours. That\r\nrequires real political leadership all round. I here\r\ncommit Ireland to playing its part.\r\nThe United Nations has no Member more loyal\r\nthan Ireland. But we realize that the United Nations\r\nneeds to change, just as the world around it has\r\nchanged. This has to be our focus over the next year.\r\nAnd what we do affects not just us here in this Hall,\r\nbut billions of our fellow human beings.\r\nFor the first time in its history, the human race\r\nhas the capacity to end extreme poverty. The summit\r\nhas endorsed the Millennium Development Goals\r\n(MDGs) as the benchmark of progress towards that\r\nobjective. Ireland will play its full part. Last week, my\r\nPrime Minister committed Ireland to reaching the 0.7\r\ntarget by 2012. By that year we will be spending up to\r\n1.5 billion euros annually. Moreover, our aid will\r\nremain completely untied and directed towards the\r\nvery poorest. Africa is, and will continue to be, the\r\nprimary focus of Ireland’s aid programme.\r\nOver the past year, we have been tragically\r\nreminded of human vulnerability in the face of natural\r\ndisasters. Their causes may be beyond our control, but\r\nhow we react is in our own hands. Ireland will place an\r\neven stronger emphasis on emergency and\r\nhumanitarian relief. In particular, we are urgently\r\nexamining how we ourselves can improve our own\r\ncapacity to deliver effective civilian protection in such\r\ncases.\r\nConflict resolution is a vital part of the United Nations\r\nmission. It is not enough to end war. We must win the\r\npeace. Without coherent peacebuilding strategies,\r\nvulnerable countries may not escape the cycle of\r\n17\r\nA/60/PV.14\r\nviolence. From the start, my country has been a leading\r\nproponent of the Peacebuilding Commission. Now that\r\nit has been agreed, let us work hard to get it up and\r\nrunning by the beginning of 2006.\r\nAt the summit, there was agreement on the vital\r\nprinciple that the international community should take\r\naction to prevent genocide, war crimes, ethnic\r\ncleansing and crimes against humanity when the\r\nresponsible Governments fail to do so. I hope and pray\r\nthat such eventualities will never again come to pass.\r\nBut if they do, we must act in a way which honours\r\nthat solemn commitment. We have failed grievously in\r\nthe past and must never do so again.\r\nThe summit has committed us to strengthening\r\nthe United Nations human rights machinery. I strongly\r\nwelcome the decision to double the budget of the\r\nOffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.\r\nAnd the decision to establish a Human Rights Council\r\nwas very positive. Now the General Assembly must\r\nmove swiftly to flesh out the modalities and the\r\nstructure. It must be composed and operate in a way\r\nwhich avoids the failings of the past. But the best\r\nfeatures of the Commission on Human Rights, such as\r\nits engagement with civil society, must be retained.\r\nIreland particularly values the work of human rights\r\ndefenders in calling Governments to account, and that\r\nmust continue.\r\nOnce more, we meet in the shadow of terrorism.\r\nSo many recent and terrible acts remind us that no\r\ncountry is immune, as Ireland knows from its own long\r\nand bitter experiences. We should agree on the\r\ncomprehensive convention on combating terrorism\r\nwithout delay during this session of the General\r\nAssembly. And all existing specific conventions must\r\nbe fully implemented, and practical cooperation made\r\nmore effective.\r\nThe threat of terrorism requires a robust security\r\nresponse. But that response must be intelligent,\r\ncalibrated and proportionate. It must respect human\r\nrights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law. And\r\nalthough no cause can ever justify terrorism, the\r\npolitical and social conditions within which it breeds\r\nmust also be addressed.\r\nWe cannot ignore the threat posed to our security\r\nby weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear\r\nweapons. Ireland was deeply disappointed at the failure\r\nof the recent Review Conference of the Parties to the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\n(NPT). We were equally disappointed at the inability of\r\nthe summit to make any progress on that absolutely\r\nvital issue. But we cannot afford to give up hope. The\r\nlogic in favour of the twin and mutually reinforcing\r\ngoals of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation\r\nremains compelling.\r\nI welcome what appear to be positive\r\ndevelopments with regard to the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea and salute the leadership of its\r\nneighbours and the United States in the negotiating\r\nprocess.\r\nUnder the NPT, countries have every right to\r\nchoose the option of civilian nuclear power. But it is\r\nessential that they do so in full accordance with the\r\nNPT and under the supervision of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA). International\r\nconfidence in their exclusively peaceful intent is also\r\nvital and, where damaged, must be rebuilt in a clear\r\nand fully verifiable way. With our other European\r\nUnion partners, Ireland fully supports the efforts of the\r\nEuropean Union three to achieve that outcome with\r\nregard to Iran.\r\nWe must continue to reform the structures of the\r\nUnited Nations. The need to align the Security Council\r\nwith today’s realities is widely acknowledged. This\r\nremains an important piece of unfinished business. We\r\nmust fulfil our commitment to revitalize the Assembly.\r\nAnd we need to take a serious look at how the\r\nEconomic and Social Council can better fulfil its role.\r\nThe Secretary-General has made clear his\r\ncommitment to delivering on management reform\r\nwithin the Organization, as was requested by the\r\nsummit. Very substantial progress on this question\r\nmust be made during the present session.\r\nI would now like to touch on a number of issues\r\nof specific concern to Ireland.\r\nIn relation to the Middle East and Iraq, the\r\nachievement of a lasting peace in the Middle East is of\r\ngreat importance to the entire world. Here, too,\r\npolitical will is the crucial ingredient. The initial\r\ndifficult phase of Israel’s disengagement from\r\nsettlements in Gaza has taken place peacefully. The\r\ncourage and the commitment of Prime Minister Sharon\r\nand his Government have been commendable. Much,\r\nhowever, remains to be done.\r\nI welcome the determination of President Abbas\r\nand his colleagues to take full advantage of the\r\n18\r\nA/60/PV.14\r\nopportunity presented by the withdrawal. They must,\r\nwith our help, maintain their efforts to ensure peace,\r\nsecurity and the rule of law. And disengagement will\r\ntruly be a success only if Gaza becomes economically\r\nviable, with free trade and free movement. This is\r\nclearly in Israel’s interests, as well as in those of the\r\nPalestinians.\r\nDisengagement is an important advance. It cannot\r\nbe the end, but rather a step towards the full\r\nimplementation of the Quartet’s road map. With the\r\nsupport and the assistance of the international\r\ncommunity, both sides must press forward and renew\r\nmomentum towards a permanent peace. It is also vital\r\nthat, in particular in relation to the West Bank — as my\r\ndelegation has spelled out in detail on many\r\noccasions — Israel desist completely from further steps\r\nwhich could jeopardize the viability of a two-State\r\nsolution.\r\nWith respect to Iraq, the people of Iraq face\r\nappalling challenges from terrorism. Despite that, they\r\nhave courageously taken steps towards the restoration\r\nof full democracy and the control of their own destiny.\r\nThe final decision on the adoption of the draft\r\nconstitution now rests with the people themselves in\r\nnext month’s referendum. The international community\r\nmust do whatever it can to ensure that the vote takes\r\nplace in a democratic and peaceful way. We have seen\r\nelsewhere that, no matter how difficult and imperfect\r\nprogress may be, with political will and the support of\r\nthe international community, it is possible to move\r\nforward, away from conflict.\r\nThe elections yesterday in Afghanistan are a\r\nfurther welcome milestone in its transition.\r\nI also commend the excellent progress made in\r\nAceh. I am proud that Irish soldiers are among those\r\ntaking part in the monitoring mission run by the\r\nEuropean Union and the Association of Southeast\r\nAsian Nations (ASEAN).\r\nSadly, in Burma-Myanmar, human rights and\r\ndemocracy continue to be denied. That is most acutely\r\nsymbolized by the continued detention of the heroic\r\nAung San Suu Kyi. The cumulative length of her\r\ndetention now approaches ten years. Her ordeal is not\r\nforgotten by the people of Ireland. I urge ASEAN, in\r\nparticular, to demonstrate effective regional leadership\r\nand to heighten pressure on the regime to release her\r\nand move along the path of reform.\r\nAs I said earlier, Ireland is particularly committed\r\nto Africa. We contribute substantially to development\r\nand conflict resolution, and we will continue to\r\nincrease that contribution. But external help can do\r\nonly so much. In the resolution of various political\r\ncrises affecting the continent, the key requirement is,\r\nagain, political leadership and vision.\r\nWe welcome the recent signing of the\r\nComprehensive Peace Agreement in the Sudan, which\r\nmust now be fully implemented. I am encouraged that,\r\ndespite the tragic and untimely death of Vice-President\r\nGarang, both sides have reaffirmed their commitment\r\nto the Agreement.\r\nHowever, the situation in Darfur continues to be\r\ndeeply worrying. My Government fully supports the\r\nAfrican Union’s mission to improve security there. We\r\nlook forward to early progress in the International\r\nCriminal Court investigation into human rights\r\nviolations. The Government of the Sudan and the\r\nparties in Darfur must renew their efforts to conclude a\r\ncomprehensive peace agreement by December, and the\r\ninternational community must continue to support\r\nefforts led by the United Nations to provide\r\nhumanitarian assistance.\r\nI welcome recent progress in the Great Lakes\r\nregion, in particular in Burundi, where the elected\r\nrepresentatives have shown generosity of spirit and\r\ncourage. I look forward to parallel progress in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. Ireland will\r\ncontribute to support for the electoral process there.\r\nBut I am seriously concerned at the situation in\r\nZimbabwe. The downward spiral, which, above all,\r\nhurts the ordinary people of that nation, must be\r\nreversed. The Zimbabwean Government should start by\r\naccepting the recommendations of the Secretary\r\nGeneral’s Special Envoy.\r\nTurning to a topic closer to home, in the Northern\r\nIreland peace process it is also time for renewed\r\nleadership. There is a real prospect of the full\r\nimplementation of the Good Friday Agreement —\r\nwhich was put together in 1998 and voted by the\r\npeople of Ireland — and the sustained operation of its\r\ninstitutions. The British and Irish Governments are\r\npartners in that endeavour, and we look for others to\r\njoin us in delivering their promises.\r\nThe Irish Republican Army took a major and\r\ncourageous step forward in July. We now expect early\r\n19\r\nA/60/PV.14\r\nmovement to deliver fully, in a verified and convincing\r\nway, on its commitment to decommissioning. There is\r\nno room for fudge and, equally, no room for any\r\ncontinuation of paramilitarism or criminality. Sinn Fein\r\nshould also show leadership in moving to support the\r\nPolice Service of Northern Ireland and to take their\r\nplace in the governance of policing. The Police Service\r\nis showing professionalism, courage and even-\r\nhandedness. The completion of the policing project\r\nwould represent a profound move towards peace and\r\npolitical stability, and I call upon Sinn Fein, in\r\nparticular, to take the hard decisions needed.\r\nEqually, leadership is needed from within the\r\nUnionist community. When the IRA’s commitments are\r\nfully delivered and verified, then the way will be clear\r\nfor renewed political discussions by all parties on the\r\nreactivation of the Northern Ireland institutions. The\r\nUnionist parties say they are prepared to share power,\r\nwhen it is clear that the threat of violence has been\r\nremoved once and for all. It should soon be time for\r\nthem to demonstrate that good faith.\r\nI also look to the Unionist community to show\r\ndetermination in condemning and doing all it can to\r\ndiscourage the continuation of the appalling\r\nlawlessness, which has in recent times so badly\r\naffected both loyalist communities and their vulnerable\r\nnationalist neighbours. The need for political\r\nleadership is so urgent precisely because the prospect\r\nof decisive progress is so real and so alluring.\r\nFollowing the summit, we have a collective\r\nresponsibility to grasp the opportunity to reinvigorate\r\nthe United Nations. If we fail, our peoples today and in\r\nthe future will not judge us kindly.\r\nIreland gives its full backing to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s proposals for change. I personally was\r\nhonoured to act as one of his envoys, because, like\r\nhim, we recognized that the United Nations was at a\r\nfork in the road. At the summit, we chose to start down\r\nthe right track, but there is a long way to travel. I\r\npledge again that over the year ahead Ireland will\r\nremain at the forefront of the drive for reform and\r\nrenewal.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Abdelwaheb Abdallah, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Tunisia.\r\nMr. Abdallah (Tunisia) (spoke in Arabic): It is\r\nmy distinct pleasure to express to you and to your\r\nfriendly country, the Kingdom of Sweden, my most\r\nsincere congratulations on your election to the\r\npresidency at this sixtieth session of the General\r\nAssembly and to wish you every success in your\r\nmission.\r\nI also express to your predecessor Mr. Jean Ping,\r\nmy deep appreciation for his excellent management of\r\nthe proceedings of the previous session.\r\nAllow me to take this opportunity to convey my\r\nthanks and appreciation to the Secretary-General,\r\ncommending his diligent efforts in assisting the\r\nOrganization to play its role and achieve its noble\r\nobjectives of maintaining peace and security and\r\nfurthering development in the world.\r\nTunisia, which celebrates, along with other\r\nmembers of the international community the sixtieth\r\nanniversary of the establishment of the United Nations,\r\nreiterates its constant commitment to the noble\r\nprinciples of the Charter and reaffirms its\r\ndetermination to continue to contribute, so that the\r\nOrganization may be as effective as possible.\r\nOur world today is witnessing rapid and\r\nsuccessive developments, often marked by an increase\r\nof tensions and the widening of the development gap\r\nbetween the North and the South. This requires that we\r\nintensify our consultations and coordination on the\r\nquestion of reforming the United Nations and\r\ndeveloping its institutions, in accordance with a\r\ncomprehensive vision based on enhancing solidarity,\r\nmutual assistance and partnership among peoples so\r\nthat our Organization will be able to deal with current\r\ninternational issues efficiently.\r\nMany of those issues still constitute a source of\r\nconcern for the international community, because of\r\ntheir impact on security and stability, and foremost\r\namong them is the Middle East problem.\r\nIn keeping with its commitment, and that of its\r\nPresident, His Excellency President Zine El Abidine\r\nBen Ali, to peace as a strategic choice, Tunisia has\r\ncontributed to all efforts and initiatives aimed at\r\nreaching a just, comprehensive and durable settlement\r\nto the Palestinian question. We reiterate our call to all\r\nparties, more particularly to the Quartet, to take\r\nadvantage of recent positive developments in the\r\nregion in order to resume peace negotiations, thus\r\nallowing the Palestinian people to recover their\r\nlegitimate national rights and establish their own\r\n20\r\nA/60/PV.14\r\nindependent State on their land as well as bringing\r\nsecurity, stability and prosperity to all peoples of the\r\nregion.\r\nWe feel that achieving just, comprehensive and\r\ndurable peace in the Middle East requires the recovery\r\nby sisterly Syria and Lebanon of all their occupied\r\nterritories.\r\nWe also express the hope that sisterly Iraq will\r\ncomplete its political process and strengthen its\r\nconstitutional institutions in accordance with the\r\naspirations of the Iraqi people, within a context of\r\nsecurity, stability and national unity.\r\nTunisia welcomes the important steps taken by the\r\nSudanese Government towards national reconciliation,\r\nin keeping with the aspirations of the Sudanese people\r\nto the consolidation of security and stability in that\r\ncountry.\r\nTunisia is sparing no effort, along with the other\r\nsisterly Arab countries, in laying the foundations for a\r\nnew phase of joint Arab action, promoting cooperation\r\nin all the political, economic and cultural fields, and\r\nreinforcing the process of development and\r\nmodernization, in line with the proposals made and\r\ndecisions taken by the Arab Summit in May 2004,\r\nwhich Tunisia had the honour to host.\r\nWe are also keen on consolidating the bonds of\r\nfraternity and cooperation with all fellow Arab\r\nMaghreb countries and completing the process of\r\nbuilding the Arab Maghreb Union, thus meeting the\r\naspirations of the peoples of the Maghreb to\r\ndevelopment and complementarity.\r\nAlthough it has witnessed a number of positive\r\ndevelopments, the African continent continues to suffer\r\nfrom the persistence of tensions and conflicts in many\r\nof its regions. Additional efforts are required in order\r\nto take further steps towards their settlement. Bringing\r\nto completion the establishment of the basic structures\r\nof the African Union would enable African countries to\r\nmove ahead in promoting cooperation and reinforcing\r\nthe foundations of security and stability in the\r\ncontinent. This, in turn, will encourage development in\r\nAfrican countries and facilitate their integration into\r\nthe world economy.\r\nAt the Euro-Mediterranean level, Tunisia is\r\nentering a new phase in its relations with the European\r\nUnion, a phase marked by a determination to further\r\npromote, develop and enlarge the scope of partnership\r\nwith that Union on the basis of cooperation, solidarity,\r\ncomplementarity and mutual respect, in line with the\r\npurposes and principles adopted at the Barcelona\r\nConference as we prepare to celebrate the tenth\r\nanniversary of its Declaration.\r\nTunisia is also endeavouring to strengthen ties of\r\nfriendship and enlarge the scope of cooperation with\r\nthe countries of the American and Asian continents in\r\norder to establish a solidarity-based partnership that\r\nwill lay the foundations for a new stage in these\r\nrelations. That would serve the interests of all parties,\r\nbring their peoples closer to one another and contribute\r\nto consolidating the foundations of stability, peace and\r\nprosperity in the world.\r\nThe intensification of violence and terrorism,\r\ndespite the joint efforts undertaken for many years to\r\nconfront that grave scourge, deepens our conviction\r\nthat the most effective way to deal with terrorism is by\r\nunifying our methods for tackling it, thereby\r\nstrengthening the capacity of the international\r\ncommunity to confront terrorism and eradicate its root\r\ncauses.\r\nIn that regard, His Excellency President Zine El\r\nAbidine Ben Ali proposed the convening of an\r\ninternational conference under United Nations auspices\r\naimed at establishing a binding international code of\r\nconduct on combating terrorism.\r\nProceeding from its steadfast adherence to the\r\nprinciples of solidarity and dialogue among peoples\r\nand its continuing endeavours to strengthen stability\r\nand development in the world, Tunisia will take an\r\nactive role in achieving the objectives spelled out in\r\nthe Millennium Declaration and in finding appropriate\r\nsolutions to the international issues we face today.\r\nIn that regard, we would mention the General\r\nAssembly’s adoption of the Tunisian proposal for the\r\nestablishment of a World Solidarity Fund. The\r\ninternational community must now provide the\r\nnecessary financial resources so that the Fund can\r\nlaunch its activities and achieve its noble objectives of\r\nreducing poverty and famine, particularly in some\r\nregions of Africa.\r\nTunisia calls for the strengthening of world\r\nsolidarity, the benefits of which were most recently\r\nmanifested in the international efforts to alleviate the\r\nenormous damage caused by both the tsunami disaster\r\nand hurricane Katrina.\r\n21\r\nA/60/PV.14\r\nAs we prepare to host the second phase of the\r\nWorld Summit on the Information Society — held in\r\nresponse to a Tunisian proposal dating back to 1998 —\r\nTunisia is looking forward to the high-level\r\ninternational participation of Governments, the private\r\nsector and civil society in that important global event\r\nin order to give it the best possible chance of success.\r\nA successful outcome will help to establish a\r\nsolidarity-based digital culture that allows developing\r\ncountries to benefit from the vast prospects offered by\r\ninformation and communication technologies and to\r\nmake the best use of them in their development plans.\r\nFurthermore, Tunisia wishes to express its thanks\r\nand appreciation to all Member States and to the\r\ninternational and regional organizations that have\r\ncontributed to the success of its international initiative\r\nto proclaim 2005 the International Year of Sport and\r\nPhysical Education in the service of peace, security and\r\ndevelopment in the world.\r\nTunisia will continue to make an effective\r\ncontribution to strengthening the culture of dialogue\r\nand the values of tolerance and cultural communication\r\namong civilizations and among all the world’s\r\ncountries and peoples, and to work against fanaticism\r\nand isolationism. We once again underline the\r\nimportance of those values in spreading security, peace\r\nand stability throughout the world, thus freeing\r\nhumanity to direct its efforts towards comprehensive\r\nand sustainable development in a spirit of optimism\r\nand confidence in a better future.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Petros Molyviatis, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nGreece.\r\nMr. Molyviatis (Greece): Let me begin,\r\nMr. President, by congratulating you upon your\r\nelection as President of the General Assembly and\r\nassure you of my country’s unwavering support for\r\nyour endeavours. Your previous experience at the\r\nUnited Nations ensures that under your guidance the\r\nAssembly will continue to promote the values and\r\nprinciples of our Organization.\r\nI also wish to extend our sincere thanks to the\r\noutgoing President, Mr. Ping. His tireless efforts in all\r\nfields, particularly in the preparations for the High-\r\nlevel Plenary Meeting, have been exemplary.\r\nGreece fully subscribes to the statement delivered\r\nearlier by the Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom\r\non behalf of the European Union, as well as to the\r\nEuropean Union priorities presented to the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nI would also like to express our appreciation to\r\nthe Secretary-General for his relentless efforts to\r\npromote peace and security and to safeguard the moral\r\nauthority and the pre-eminent role of our United\r\nNations.\r\nAt the beginning of the twenty-first century, we\r\ncontinue to face many threats and challenges that\r\nundermine the basic values and principles of our\r\nsocieties and test our will and determination to abide\r\nby the obligations and restraints inherent in those\r\nvalues and principles. Only through concerted\r\ncollective action, dialogue and mutual understanding\r\ncan we confront them and pave the way for a better and\r\nbrighter future.\r\nTerrorism has emerged as the most important\r\nchallenge of our times, creating an atmosphere of\r\ncollective fear, intolerance and a never-ending cycle of\r\nviolence. Throughout history, violence has never\r\nproven to be an answer to our problems. Peace,\r\nstability and security can only be achieved through\r\ntolerance, acceptance and the realization that our\r\ncommon interests far outweigh our differences. There\r\nis no justification whatsoever for terrorism. It is high\r\ntime for an urgent collective effort to put an immediate\r\nend to that modern scourge.\r\nNatural disasters, like the tsunami in Asia and the\r\nrecent hurricane in the southern part of the United\r\nStates — with so many victims and unimaginable\r\ndestruction — also demonstrate sufficiently the\r\nimportance of international cooperation and the urgent\r\nneed for human solidarity.\r\nI am fully aware of the importance of economic\r\ndevelopment for a considerable part of the world.\r\nSecurity and sustainable development go hand in hand.\r\nOur collective commitment and efforts are needed to\r\ncorrect the imbalances and disparities in the world. It is\r\nonly a matter of time before extreme poverty, hunger\r\nand the catastrophic impact of widespread diseases will\r\nlead to strife, internal or external. The foremost\r\nexample of that is in Africa, where the vicious cycle of\r\npoverty, conflict and HIV/AIDS produces an explosive\r\ncombination ripping apart the fabric of their societies\r\nand threatening them with unprecedented and dire\r\nconsequences.\r\n22\r\nA/60/PV.14\r\nMultilateral cooperation is the only way to a\r\nbetter world. The international multilateral system\r\nmust be enhanced and strengthened. Greece fully\r\nparticipates in the policies formulated by the European\r\nUnion and the various international organizations that\r\ncontribute to the economic development of all areas of\r\nthe world in order to redress existing imbalances.\r\nWe appreciate the value of cultural diversity in a\r\nworld unfortunately so often divided by discrimination.\r\nWe believe in dialogue among cultures, among people\r\nand among societies. We fully support the peaceful\r\nresolution of all our disputes on the basis of\r\ninternational law and the United Nations Charter. We\r\nare deeply committed to the United Nations and what it\r\nrepresents and to effective multilateralism and the pre-\r\neminence of international law.\r\nLooking at Greece’s immediate neighbourhood,\r\nthe Balkans, we realize that it has not yet been fully\r\ntransformed into a region of peace, stability and\r\nprosperity.\r\nIn Kosovo, the trauma created by the repression\r\nof the past and the inter-ethnic violence that plagued\r\nthe region for so long has yet to be healed. There is a\r\nneed for a settlement that is in conformity with\r\ninternational legality, as expressed by the United\r\nNations, and with European standards and values — a\r\nsettlement which will enhance regional stability.\r\nWe remain convinced that European integration is\r\nthe only way to find permanent solutions to existing\r\nproblems and challenges in the area. At the same time,\r\nregional cooperation must be strengthened so as to\r\neffectively address the problems of the neighbourhood.\r\nGreece, which holds the chairmanship-in-office of the\r\nSouth-East European Cooperation Process, is\r\ndetermined to strengthen the institutional aspects of\r\nthat process and to develop it into the real voice of the\r\nregion.\r\nI deeply regret that the Cyprus problem remains\r\nunresolved. In the 31 years of military occupation of\r\nmore than one third of the territory of Cyprus, Greece\r\nhas strongly supported every attempt and initiative by\r\nthe United Nations to achieve a comprehensive\r\nsettlement of the Cyprus problem.\r\nIn the light of the outcome of last year’s\r\nreferendums, which should be fully respected, any new\r\ninitiative will have to be carefully prepared so as to\r\nensure real chances for success. For our part, we are\r\nready to work towards building the necessary common\r\nground, which will render possible the re-launching of\r\nmeaningful negotiations.\r\nOur ultimate goal remains an agreed solution\r\nbetween the two parties. We remain steadfastly\r\ncommitted to reaching a just and viable solution for the\r\nreunification of the island following negotiations on\r\nthe basis of the Secretary-General’s plan and the\r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions, and in\r\nconformity with European Union principles and acquis.\r\nIn this endeavour, Greece will spare no effort.\r\nThe climate of our bilateral relations with Turkey\r\nover recent years has been constantly improving. We\r\nhave made vigorous efforts to put our relations on a\r\nnew, solid track. Significant progress has been\r\nachieved in several areas of our bilateral cooperation,\r\nand Turkey’s European Union perspective will further\r\nbroaden the scope of our relations.\r\nThe latest developments in the Middle East allow\r\nus to maintain a certain level of reserved optimism.\r\nThe Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and parts of the\r\nnorthern West Bank does, indeed, constitute an\r\nimportant milestone. This is a momentous opportunity\r\nto revitalize the road map and to move the process a\r\nstep closer to achieving a fair, lasting and\r\ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East.\r\nThe road map remains the framework for the\r\nachievement of a just and lasting peace. Both parties\r\nshould concentrate on fulfilling their respective\r\nobligations and commitments and refrain from any and\r\nall unilateral actions which threaten to prejudge the\r\noutcome of final status negotiations and undermine\r\nefforts at building confidence on the ground.\r\nOur shared goal remains the realization of a two-\r\nState solution: Israel and a democratic, viable and\r\nterritorially contiguous State of Palestine, living side\r\nby side in peace and security.\r\nWith regard to Iraq, Greece underlines the\r\nimportance of its territorial integrity and unity in the\r\nframework of a federal system. We remain particularly\r\nconcerned, however, about the ongoing violence,\r\nwhich makes it imperative to follow the timetable of\r\nthe political process that will lead the country to\r\nnormalcy, which is of vital importance for peace and\r\nstability in the entire region. We fully support Iraq in\r\nthis difficult mission.\r\n23\r\nA/60/PV.14\r\nMy country has a long, historic relationship with\r\nthe African continent and its peoples. We have\r\nwitnessed with great concern the series of conflict\r\nsituations that have been plaguing Africa for many\r\nyears. We are following developments in all cases and\r\nare trying to make positive contributions, whether in\r\nthe Sudan, in the Democratic Republic of Congo or\r\nother countries of West Africa, in the settlement of the\r\ndispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea, and elsewhere.\r\nThe emerging pivotal role of the African Union in\r\ndealing with African crises has our full support and\r\ndeep appreciation.\r\nLast Friday, we adopted a historic declaration,\r\nwhich constitutes a new and important step in the\r\ndirection of enforcing collective security and\r\nstrengthening the United Nations capacity to deal with\r\nthe new challenges and threats that our societies are\r\nfacing today. Our efforts should now focus on the\r\nimplementation of the commitments made, so that\r\ngenerations to come can live in a better and more\r\nsecure world.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Portugal and former President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMr. Freitas do Amaral (Portugal) (spoke in\r\nPortuguese; English text provided by the delegation): I\r\nam returning to the Assembly Hall after 10 years. In\r\nSeptember 1995, I had the honour of being elected\r\nPresident of the General Assembly. I well know,\r\ntherefore, what a difficult task it is, and I congratulate\r\nyou, Mr. President, Ambassador Jan Eliasson, on your\r\nrecent election. I wish you every success in discharging\r\nyour lofty functions. I would also like to compliment\r\nthe outgoing President, Mr. Ping, on the exceptional\r\nwork that he did during the previous session.\r\nI offer my best wishes to the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan. My country greatly values the\r\nexcellent work that he has done so far, and the\r\nPortuguese Government wishes to express its solidarity\r\nwith him in connection with the difficult times that has\r\nbeen through, as well as its continued support for the\r\nenormous tasks and challenges that lie ahead.\r\nWe share some of the disappointment felt by the\r\nSecretary-General regarding the failure to approve\r\nmany of the proposed reforms of the Organization that\r\nhe set out in his excellent report, “In larger freedom”.\r\nThe entire process started 10 years ago, in 1995-96,\r\nunder my presidency, and I can assure the Assembly\r\nthat one year later, when I left office, there were\r\nalready many consensus-based solutions that could\r\nhave been approved. But insufficient use was made of\r\nthe 10 years that have since passed.\r\nWe are left with the conviction that progress\r\ntowards sound reform will be viable only if it\r\nmaintains, as its reference, the objectives set out in the\r\nproposals of the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan.\r\nWhat is sound reform of the United Nations? In\r\nmy opinion, such reform would fulfil, at least, the\r\nfollowing five prerequisites.\r\nFirst, such reforms must respect and reaffirm the\r\nfundamental principles and values of the Charter.\r\nSecondly, they must create better conditions for the\r\nmaintenance and re-establishment of peace,\r\nguaranteeing security and dealing with the offenders in\r\neither case. Thirdly, they must include strong measures\r\nin support of development so as to improve the living\r\nconditions of the world’s poorest countries and reduce\r\nthe enormous gap that exists between the countries of\r\nthe North and those of the South.\r\nFourthly, such reforms must promote democracy,\r\nhuman rights and the rule of law, internationally, as\r\nwell as within each State. Fifthly, they must establish a\r\nbasis and the necessary conditions for a better\r\nunderstanding among peoples, for a dialogue among\r\ncivilizations, for an understanding of cultural and\r\nreligious diversity, and for a spirit of tolerance,\r\ncooperation and friendship among nations,\r\nGovernments and individuals.\r\nIn addition to those five prerequisites, there is\r\nstill a need to consider reorganizing the Secretariat,\r\nwhich is an important instrument for attaining the\r\nobjectives of the United Nations. Make no mistake: I\r\nhave enough personal experience to be able to state\r\nthat the staff of this Organization is, generally\r\nspeaking, highly competent, dedicated and\r\nprofessional. But we must all understand that, in a\r\nlarge Organization such as this one, like in any other,\r\nthere will always be a need for constant modernization.\r\nLast week the United Nations reform was set in\r\nmotion. We must continue to work hard, year after\r\nyear, phase by phase, with the energy and the spirit of\r\ncompromise that is the hallmark of diplomacy and\r\nwhich must therefore not be absent from the “temple of\r\ndiplomacy” that is the United Nations.\r\n24\r\nA/60/PV.14\r\nFirst and foremost, the tasks to be accomplished\r\nin the coming months — which have Portugal’s\r\nunreserved support — will be to do what is necessary\r\nto make the Peacebuilding Commission operational; to\r\nimplement the already approved concept of the\r\n“responsibility to protect”; and to establish the new\r\nHuman Rights Council.\r\nDevelopment is an urgent task that cannot be\r\npostponed. The poorest countries call for justice, and\r\nthey deserve it; the richest countries insist on a code of\r\nethics, and they must therefore fulfil the duties that\r\nderive from it.\r\nIn that regard, Portugal fully endorses the vision\r\nexpressed and reaffirmed by the United Nations which\r\naccords priority to development — understood to be\r\ncomprehensive development, as expressed in the\r\nMillennium Development Goals — and which is\r\nclosely linked to security and the rule of law.\r\nDemocracy and security constitute the sine qua non\r\ncondition for effective, sustained and equitable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn terms of official development assistance,\r\nPortugal hopes to reach the agreed target of 0.51 per\r\ncent of gross domestic product in 2010, in order to\r\npave the way to achieving the ambitious goal of 0.7 per\r\ncent in 2015.\r\nThe efforts of Portugal have been mainly — but\r\nnot exclusively — directed towards the least developed\r\ncountries, and sub-Saharan Africa in particular.\r\nWe therefore reaffirm the need to pay active and\r\ncommitted attention to the special needs of Africa. In\r\nthat way, we will fulfil effectively the commitments\r\nundertaken to strengthen cooperation with the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development and with\r\nregional and subregional organizations.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General rightly\r\nreminds us that every country is primarily responsible\r\nfor its own development, in a framework of good\r\ngovernance, which is a prerequisite in this context.\r\nBasically, it is a matter of implementing the\r\neighth Millennium Goal: to create a global partnership for\r\ndevelopment, whose importance in promoting a more\r\nequitable and just world I would like to stress here.\r\nThat is why I have no hesitation in stating that we\r\nmust remain actively committed to the implementation\r\nof the Millennium Development Goals, including\r\nstrengthening action in priority areas. Our common\r\nfuture is at stake, and I would like to take this\r\nopportunity to announce that Portugal has decided to\r\ncontribute to the United Nations Democracy Fund.\r\nFor Portugal, environmental concerns are a clear\r\npriority; addressing them must promote, not detract\r\nfrom, development. In that domain, we will actively\r\nparticipate in international efforts to combat climate\r\nchange, honouring our commitments and limiting\r\ngreenhouse-gas emissions, so that the European Union\r\ncan attain the goals agreed in the context of the Kyoto\r\nProtocol. We hope that the next Conference, to be held\r\nin Montreal, will mark the launching of a negotiating\r\nprocess on climate-related issues for the post-2012\r\nperiod.\r\nOne of the most serious threats to peace and\r\nsecurity today is terrorism. It must be fought with\r\nresolve, within the framework of the rule of law and\r\nwith respect for human rights. There can be no doubt\r\nthat one of the aims of terrorists is to weaken and\r\ndistort even the most elementary of the universal\r\nvalues adopted by States and their peoples. Because we\r\nare fighting back in self-defence, they say that our\r\nactions — theirs and ours — are morally equivalent.\r\nPortugal strongly rejects that view.\r\nThere can be no ambiguity in fighting terrorism.\r\nWe must be clear on this and state, quite bluntly, that\r\nall acts that aim to kill or seriously injure civilians or\r\nnon-combatants are acts of terrorism.\r\nWe believe that the United Nations provides a\r\nframework of reference for combating terrorism, and\r\nwe therefore urge that a global convention on terrorism\r\nbe adopted. Similarly, we welcome the counter-\r\nterrorism strategy drawn up by the Secretary-General,\r\nand we appeal for its effective implementation.\r\nIn that context, Portugal will sign the\r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of Acts\r\nof Nuclear Terrorism during this session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nWe must recognize that the largest cluster of\r\nthreats to international peace and security today lies in\r\nthe broader Middle East. Regardless of countries’\r\npositions on the Iraq war, it is now essential to do all\r\nwe can, based on the clear existing mandates of the\r\nUnited Nations, to see that peace, democracy and\r\nhuman rights triumph. That could take a number of\r\nyears, as in Afghanistan.\r\n25\r\nA/60/PV.14\r\nRegarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, it is\r\nimportant that, taking advantage of the current positive\r\nmomentum, we hold serious negotiations aimed at\r\nreaching bilateral and multilateral agreements. The\r\nroad map cannot be forgotten or indefinitely\r\npostponed. Just as Israel has an unquestionable right to\r\nlive in peace within secure borders, the Palestinian\r\nState also has an unquestionable right to exist. Only\r\nthrough what is called the two-State policy can there be\r\npeace in the Middle East.\r\nAs for Iran, I should like to stress and support the\r\nefforts of the European Union to avert, through\r\nnegotiations, another dangerous case of nuclear\r\nproliferation. The international community as a whole\r\nand the Iranian people themselves owe a great deal to\r\nthe intelligent approach of the European Union in this\r\nmatter. We are, and will continue to be, united in\r\nsolidarity. Negotiations must continue.\r\nPortugal is committed to strengthening\r\ncooperation among regions and civilizations in order to\r\npromote international peace and stability. Accordingly,\r\nthe high-level political dialogue between Europe and\r\nAfrica must be further strengthened, including through\r\nthe convening of the Europe-Africa summit, towards\r\nwhich Portugal has been working tirelessly.\r\nI reiterate Portugal’s appeal to all interested\r\nparties to join in our effort to re-launch the Cairo\r\nprocess, which we believe could be instrumental in\r\nestablishing that strategic partnership.\r\nI also wish to publicly place on record my\r\ncountry’s support for Spain’s Alliance of Civilizations\r\ninitiative. The European-African dialogue is also a\r\ndialogue among civilizations, as is the Ibero-American\r\nprocess, to which Portugal, Spain, Andorra and the Latin\r\nAmerican countries are committed. That process will be\r\nformalized at the Salamanca Summit in October.\r\nOver the past nine years, the dialogue among the\r\neight States members of the Community of Portuguese-\r\nSpeaking Countries — which represents 200 million\r\npeople living in four continents — has been intensified,\r\nwith great success. Portugal participates in the dialogue\r\nwith countries from Europe, Africa, Latin America and\r\nAsia, a dialogue that it would like to see broadened as\r\nan indispensable tool for civilizations to live in peace\r\nand not be at war.\r\nI would like to conclude by reaffirming\r\nPortugal’s faith in the centrality, legitimacy and\r\nindispensable role of the United Nations. While not\r\nforgetting our setbacks, but learning from them so that\r\nthey are not repeated, we should bear in mind our\r\nmany successes. Timor-Leste, which is here with us\r\ntoday as a full Member State, is one example of a\r\nUnited Nations success story.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to remember the wise\r\nwords of our second Secretary-General, Dag\r\nHammarskjöld, who said:\r\n(spoke in English)\r\n“The pursuit of peace and progress cannot end in\r\na few years in either victory or defeat. The\r\npursuit of peace and progress, with its trials and\r\nits errors, its successes and its setbacks, can never\r\nbe relaxed and never abandoned.”\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. K. Natwar Singh, Minister for External\r\nAffairs of India.\r\nMr. Singh (India): Your election, Sir, as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixtieth\r\nsession comes at a significant moment in the history of\r\nthe United Nations. The outcome document adopted by\r\nour heads of State or Government shortly after the\r\nbeginning of the session represents the culmination of\r\na long process. It started with the report of the High-\r\nlevel Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change. It\r\ncontinued with the Secretary-General’s “In larger\r\nfreedom” report, and the efforts of your distinguished\r\npredecessor to synthesize those ideas for the\r\nconsideration of Member States. We thank all of those\r\ninvolved for their dedicated efforts.\r\nWe are united in our commitment to\r\nmultilateralism; that is a good foundation for our\r\nfurther efforts. All countries, especially those from the\r\ndeveloping world, played a significant role in the\r\nnegotiations on the outcome document. Much was\r\nachieved; much has been left out. There are\r\nfoundations on which we have to build, but there are\r\nalso shortcomings which we need to correct in the\r\nprocess of implementation. A notable omission is the\r\ntheme of disarmament. Our struggle for multilaterally\r\nnegotiated, universal and verifiable nuclear\r\ndisarmament, in a time-bound manner, must continue\r\nwith vigour. The outcome document must serve as a\r\nroad map, with its main elements acting as signposts in\r\nour discussions over the coming months under your\r\nstewardship, Mr. President.\r\n26\r\nA/60/PV.14\r\nYou, Sir, have suggested a very appropriate theme\r\nfor the general debate: “For a stronger and more\r\neffective United Nations: follow-up to and\r\nimplementation of the High-Level Meeting in\r\nSeptember 2005”. We believe that that captures the\r\nspirit and essence of all that we, co-partners in the\r\nUnited Nations, wish to achieve.\r\nIndia is the world’s largest democracy. There is\r\nno historical precedent for a democracy of over 1\r\nbillion people. It is a tremendous undertaking. It is also\r\nan exciting and inspiring one. We are breaking new\r\nground. The fact that Indian democracy works is a\r\npolitical miracle. The credit goes to the Indian voters.\r\nThey ensure that India remains secular, democratic and\r\npluralistic.\r\nWe also believe that we need to do much more to\r\ninculcate respect for and acceptance of pluralism. I am\r\nreminded of what Mahatma Gandhi, the father of our\r\nnation, said:\r\n“I do not want my house to be walled in on all\r\nsides and my windows to be stuffed. I want the\r\ncultures of all the lands to be blown about my\r\nhouse as freely as possible. But I refuse to be\r\nblown off my feet by any.”\r\nHumankind is now learning, to some extent, to\r\ncope with the menace of terrorism. We all know that\r\nthat evil is increasingly directed at innocent civilians.\r\nIt invites the strongest condemnation. We all agree that\r\nthere can be no justification for terrorism in any form.\r\nWhether we are considering terrorism or non-\r\nproliferation, unless there is a non-selective, uniform\r\nand sustained approach, the objectives of the\r\ninternational community cannot be achieved. The\r\noutcome document reflects the joint resolve of the\r\ninternational community to fight terrorism. In our\r\njudgement, there is no institutional setting that is more\r\ncapable than the United Nations of providing cohesion\r\nand vigour to those efforts.\r\nAs a victim of terrorism over the past two\r\ndecades, India understands, and is fully supportive of,\r\nthe need for United Nations action on counter-\r\nterrorism. A key aspect of the implementation of the\r\noutcome document will be the development and\r\nadoption by the General Assembly of a strong counter-\r\nterrorism agenda to supplement the existing General\r\nAssembly and Security Council resolutions on that\r\nissue. As an initiator of the draft comprehensive\r\nconvention on international terrorism, India welcomes,\r\nand is fully committed to, the decision taken by heads\r\nof State or Government to conclude negotiations on the\r\nconvention during this session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nThe main purpose of the summit last week was to\r\nreview the implementation of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration. Unfortunately, most developing countries\r\nwill not be able to achieve the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, given current growth rates and\r\nlevels of international support. We must strengthen\r\nefforts at both the national and the international levels\r\nto take us closer to the development targets set out in\r\nthe Millennium document.\r\nThe Millennium Development Goals embody a\r\nquantifiable vision of human dignity and solidarity, as\r\nwell as of important economic and social rights. Yet,\r\nimportant objectives, such as employment, critical for\r\ndeveloping countries, are excluded. India’s use of\r\ninnovative financial instruments for rural\r\ninfrastructural investment, as well as our Rural\r\nEmployment Guarantee Bill — recently passed in\r\nParliament — I believe may be of interest to other\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nMost of us had much higher expectations of the\r\nsummit in the area of development, particularly in\r\nagreeing on a definite timetable for the achievement of\r\nthe 0.7 per cent target for official development\r\nassistance. Unfortunately, that has not been achieved,\r\nand we have gone down to 0.5 per cent. That is equally\r\ntrue of innovative sources of financing because\r\ndeveloping countries cannot break out of the cycle of\r\npoverty without enhanced resource flows and the\r\napplication of science and technology to meet their\r\ndevelopmental challenges.\r\nAs India’s own economy develops — at about 8\r\nper cent per year — and its technological advancement\r\ncomes of age, we are expanding our economic and\r\ntechnical cooperation with the developing countries,\r\nreinforcing our political solidarity. We have extensive\r\nprogrammes in Africa and elsewhere in the developing\r\nworld. We are also happy to have contributed to the\r\nSouth Fund for Development and Humanitarian\r\nAssistance. The India-Brazil-South Africa Facility for\r\nAlleviation of Poverty and Hunger is a good example\r\nof South-South cooperation.\r\nIndia has written off the debts of all the highly\r\nindebted poor countries. Given India’s long-term\r\nassociation with and commitment to Africa, we\r\n27\r\nA/60/PV.14\r\nwelcome the recognition given by the High-level\r\nPlenary Meeting to the need to urgently address the\r\nspecial needs of our African brothers and sisters. On its\r\npart, India has undertaken several initiatives in\r\npartnership with Africa. The Techno-Economic\r\nApproach for Africa-India Movement initiative is\r\ndesigned to promote technology transfer to West\r\nAfrica. The pivotal role of scientific knowledge and\r\ntechnology for economic development cannot be\r\noverstated. India stands ready to share its experience\r\nwith the developing countries of Africa and elsewhere.\r\nTo bridge the digital divide within a country\r\nitself, which sometimes becomes as problematic as it is\r\nat the international level, wireless local loop\r\ntechnology developed in India, which eliminates\r\nexpensive equipment and copper lines, has already\r\nbeen used in several countries in Africa. India has put\r\ntogether a connectivity mission in Africa, using fiber\r\noptics and dedicated satellite. It will support tele-\r\neducation, telemedicine, e-commerce and e-\r\ngovernance, infotainment, resource mapping and\r\nmeteorological services. India is also earmarking $1.5\r\nbillion for lines of credit to assist developing countries,\r\nin particular those in Africa, in fighting HIV/AIDS and\r\nother pandemics.\r\nThe international community needs to address\r\nintellectual property regimes that seek to deny\r\ntechnologies rather than facilitating their transfer to the\r\ndeveloping countries, including in the areas of\r\nenvironment and public health.\r\nAlthough both the Millennium Declaration and\r\nthe outcome document have spoken of exploiting the\r\nbeneficial aspects of globalization, we are yet to agree\r\non and implement the modalities for such a process.\r\nMaking the process of globalization fairer and more\r\nequitable remains one of the main challenges of our\r\ntime. At present, the accumulation of wealth is\r\naccompanied by the accumulation of poverty. Ruskin,\r\nthe nineteenth century British author, in his book Unto\r\nthis Last — a favourite of Mahatma Gandhi —\r\ndescribed such wealth as “the gilded index of a far-\r\nreaching ruin, a wrecker’s pile of coin gleaned from a\r\nbeach to which he has beguiled an argosy.” Poverty is\r\nsometimes attributed to lack of entrepreneurship. The\r\npoor of the world prove their entrepreneurship every\r\nday by ensuring their families’ physical survival.\r\nRegrettably, the summit has not given a clear and\r\ncomprehensive direction to the World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO) Doha Round of trade\r\nnegotiations. Formulas are not an end in themselves;\r\nthe end has to be a decrease in poverty and an increase\r\nin employment. Therefore, equal treatment cannot be\r\nforced on unequal partners. Special and differential\r\ntreatment remains an integral component of all trade\r\nnegotiations, including agriculture and non-agricultural\r\nmarket access. India, as a member of the G-20, will\r\ncontinue to promote in the WTO and elsewhere the\r\ninterests of all developing countries, including the\r\nsmall island developing States, the least developed, the\r\nlandlocked and the highly indebted poor countries.\r\nAn achievement of the developing countries in\r\nthe Group of 77 is their hard-fought and reasonably\r\nsuccessful struggle for progress on systemic issues\r\ncritical to good international economic governance. We\r\nhave to build on that to ensure the reform of Bretton\r\nWoods institutions and the restoration of the central\r\nrole of the United Nations in setting the international\r\neconomic agenda.\r\nA change in the composition of the Security\r\nCouncil is an imperative. The G-4 framework\r\nresolution has made United Nations reform a central\r\nissue that can no longer be ignored or disregarded.\r\nThere is a democracy deficit, as the Secretary-General\r\nalso said in July, in the governance of the United\r\nNations. There is not much point in speaking of\r\ninclusiveness, transparency and democracy and leaving\r\nthe Security Council as a glaring exception to those\r\nprinciples. Measures taken so far to revitalize the\r\nGeneral Assembly are simply not enough. Only by\r\nelecting permanent members committed to rendering\r\nunto the General Assembly what is the General\r\nAssembly’s can that be done. That is essential for a\r\nworld order in which decisions are optimal and\r\ntherefore acceptable, and the use of force minimal.\r\nJawaharlal Nehru, India’s first Prime Minister,\r\naptly stated: “Above all, we have to participate in the\r\ngrowing structure of a world order. We cannot rely on\r\nothers to do it on our behalf.” One cannot argue in\r\nfavour of democracy in the rest of the world and leave\r\nthe Security Council undemocratic. Effectiveness is a\r\nfunction of right decisions with broad support.\r\nNegotiations on the outcome document and many\r\nsubsequent statements have demonstrated that, if more\r\ncould not be achieved on the development aspects of\r\ntrade in the document, it is because the Security\r\nCouncil has not been made representative. If\r\ninstitutional reform has been faltering and many are\r\n28\r\nA/60/PV.14\r\ndoubtful of securing a just solution, it is because the\r\nSecurity Council does not reflect the world of today. It\r\nreflects the world of 1945.\r\nThe unsatisfactory progress on other issues shows\r\nthat critics of Security Council expansion in both the\r\ncategories were profoundly mistaken. Security Council\r\nreform, far from hindering progress, was actually\r\nhelping it. In its absence, fears of intervention have\r\nprevented agreement on a human rights council and\r\nother issues. Therefore, Security Council reform\r\nremains more necessary than ever and should\r\npreferably, as the Secretary-General has said, be\r\ncompleted by the end of the year. That should be our\r\nmain priority; I doubt if it is. Security Council reform\r\nis not about any country’s prestige or power, but about\r\ntransforming the balance of power in the world. Our\r\nexperience in India from the freedom movement to\r\npresent times shows that diversity is a source of\r\nstrength and effectiveness. The same would be true of a\r\nreformed Security Council. We would continue also to\r\nengage actively in the strengthening of the Economic\r\nand Social Council, the restructuring of the Secretariat\r\nand the setting-up of peacebuilding commission.\r\nAs we observe the sixtieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations, I am reminded once again of the words\r\nof India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, who\r\nsaid at this very forum 45 years ago:\r\n“During these past fifteen years the United\r\nNations has often been criticized for its structure\r\nand for some of its activities. These criticisms\r\nhave had some justification behind them, but\r\nlooking at the broad picture I think that we can\r\ndefinitely say that the United Nations has amply\r\njustified its existence and repeatedly prevented\r\nour recurrent crises from developing into war. It\r\nhas played a great role, and it is a little difficult\r\nnow to think of this troubled world without the\r\nUnited Nations.” (A/PV.882, para. 110)\r\nIn the life of individuals as well as of institutions,\r\nthe completion of 60 years is a significant moment for\r\nstocktaking — certainly in my part of the world. Even\r\nas we reflect upon the functioning of this institution\r\nsince its inception in 1945, all of us gathered here look\r\nforward to the realization of new hopes, aspirations\r\nand, indeed, to a rejuvenated United Nations which is\r\nfully geared to meet the myriad challenges of our times\r\nand effectively contribute to the well-being and\r\ndevelopment of humanity at large and to manage\r\nchange.\r\nThe vision which we have for a better world is\r\nbest described in the words of a great son of India, the\r\ngreat poet Rabindranath Tagore, who was the first\r\nAsian to be awarded the Nobel Prize in literature. I\r\nshall end my statement by quoting a very famous text\r\nof his:\r\n“Where the mind is without fear and the head is\r\nheld high\r\nWhere knowledge is free\r\nWhere the world has not been broken up into\r\nfragments by narrow domestic walls\r\nWhere words come out from the depth of truth\r\nWhere tireless striving stretches its arms towards\r\nperfection\r\nWhere the clear stream of reason has not lost its\r\nway\r\nInto the dreary desert sand of dead habit\r\nWhere the mind is led forward by thee\r\nInto ever-widening thought and action\r\nInto that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my\r\ncountry awake.”\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Hassan Wirajuda, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Indonesia.\r\nMr. Wirajuda (Indonesia): We live in an age of\r\nunpredictable threats, against which there may be no\r\nairtight security measures. Tragedy could strike in the\r\nform of a deadly epidemic. It could be the handiwork\r\nof terrorists, like the attacks against New York City on\r\n11 September 2001 or the Bali bombings of 2002. It\r\ncould be a convulsion of nature, like the tsunami that\r\ndemolished the Indonesian province of Aceh and\r\nnearby Indian Ocean Rim areas, or the storm tide that\r\ndrowned New Orleans and much of Louisiana recently.\r\nOn the tragedy of New Orleans, we extend our\r\ndeepest condolences to the American people.\r\nWe Indonesians know too well the enormous\r\nsuffering that a natural catastrophe can bring. In Aceh\r\nalone, the tsunami of 26 December 2004 killed outright\r\nsome 130,000 individuals. It destroyed 220,000 homes\r\nand displaced 572,000 individuals. Some 100,000\r\npersons are still missing and presumed dead. The death\r\ntoll would have been higher were it not for the quick\r\nand vigorous response of the international community\r\nand the United Nations. For that, the Indonesian people\r\n29\r\nA/60/PV.14\r\nare deeply grateful. The outpouring of sympathy and\r\nsolidarity, as well as humanitarian assistance from all\r\nover the world, deeply touched us.\r\nEleven days after the tragedy, we hosted in\r\nJakarta a special summit of the Association of\r\nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN) on the aftermath of\r\nthe earthquake and tsunami. At that summit, world\r\nleaders and the United Nations Secretary-General, as\r\nwell as representatives of multilateral institutions,\r\nworked out a system of coordination and division of\r\nlabour in attending to the stricken countries. Pledges\r\nwere made of urgently needed assistance. A decision\r\nwas reached to develop a multi-nodal early warning\r\nsystem covering the Indian Ocean Rim countries.\r\nWithin ASEAN, an agreement to establish stand-by\r\narrangements to mitigate natural disasters was\r\nconcluded last July. Those efforts were reflected in\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 59/233, initiated by\r\nASEAN and sponsored by more than 130 United\r\nNations Members.\r\nThe reconstruction and rehabilitation of Aceh got\r\noff to an early start as the emergency relief phase was\r\ncompleted ahead of schedule. A master plan for\r\nreconstruction and rehabilitation was then devised. An\r\nagency for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of\r\nAceh was established and given broad powers.\r\nThrough the World Bank’s Multi-Donor Trust Fund\r\nand bilateral mechanisms with donors, we have\r\ninstituted a strict system that guarantees transparency\r\nand accountability in the disbursement of funds.\r\nRehabilitation and development, however, cannot\r\nrun smoothly without peace. And for many years there\r\nhas been no peace. Before the tsunami, Aceh saw three\r\ndecades of armed conflict caused by perceived\r\neconomic injustices. Many Acehnese felt that they\r\nwere not being given a fair deal by the central\r\nGovernment. As the conflict raged and took a heavy\r\ntoll on human life, a vicious cycle was at work:\r\nviolence impoverished the people, and in their poverty\r\nmany resorted to violence.\r\nIn the spirit of reform and in a democratic\r\nenvironment, efforts to address the problem of Aceh\r\nthrough dialogue and reconciliation were initiated in\r\n2000. Those efforts led to the signing of a final\r\nagreement in Helsinki last month. That was the silver\r\nlining in the cloud of 26 December; it opened the eyes\r\nof both sides to the hopelessness of the situation\r\nwithout peace.\r\nIt helps that there is international support for the\r\npeace process. At our invitation, the European Union\r\nand ASEAN contributing countries have provided\r\nmonitors for the implementation of the peace\r\nagreement. In a way, it has created a precedent for the\r\ncollaboration of two regional organizations in\r\npeacebuilding.\r\nThe decommissioning and destruction of rebel\r\nweapons are working according to the peace\r\nagreement. The former rebels are back in the fold of\r\nthe unitary Republic of Indonesia and are fighting on\r\nthe same side as the Government in the struggle against\r\npoverty.\r\nPeace and development in Aceh are the fruits of\r\nreform and democratization, which are pervading all of\r\nIndonesia. Starting this year, all local officials,\r\ngovernors, regents and mayors are directly elected by\r\nthe people. Whereas the former rebel leaders once\r\nsought power through the bullet, they can now seek\r\ntheir legitimate aspirations through the ballot.\r\nSince 1998, we have enhanced our political\r\ninstitutions through constitutional amendments. We\r\nhave overhauled our legal system, and we are adopting\r\nhigh standards of good governance in the corporate and\r\npublic sector. We have pursued vigorous campaigns\r\nagainst corruption.\r\nWe are now pursuing an economic strategy that is\r\npro-growth, pro-poor and pro-job. We are\r\nstrengthening the export sector, promoting investments\r\nto create jobs and speeding up rural economic\r\ndevelopment. In a few weeks, we will put in place a\r\nsocial safety net that will cushion the impact of high\r\noil prices on the poor. We are on target with our\r\nMillennium Development Goals on poverty reduction.\r\nWherever there is social unrest in Indonesia, we\r\nbring justice and foster dialogue and reconciliation, as\r\nwe did in Aceh.\r\nIn the same spirit of reconciliation, Indonesia and\r\nneighbouring Timor-Leste have reached out to each\r\nother so that both nations might together close a\r\npainful chapter in our shared history. Together, we\r\nhave established a commission of truth and friendship,\r\ntasked to bring about exposure of the truth and\r\nacknowledgement of responsibility for the human\r\nrights violations committed prior to and immediately\r\nafter the popular consultations held in Timor-Leste in\r\n1999. The commission started its work last August.\r\n30\r\nA/60/PV.14\r\nThe fledgling democracies of the two countries stand a\r\nbetter of chance of succeeding if they work together in\r\na spirit of reconciliation, friendship and cooperation,\r\ncomplementing the prosecutorial justice that has been\r\ncarried out in Indonesia and Timor-Leste.\r\nWith our other closest neighbours in South-East\r\nAsia, we are striving hard to become an ASEAN\r\ncommunity that is at peace with itself and all others —\r\na prosperous ASEAN living in harmony within the\r\ncommunity of caring societies that we have long\r\nenvisioned. We hope to see ASEAN play a pivotal role\r\nin the evolution of a new equilibrium in the Asia-\r\nPacific region that will consolidate the peaceful\r\nengagement of regional Powers with one another.\r\nToday, ASEAN already serves as the driving force\r\ntowards the development of an East Asian economic\r\ncommunity.\r\nWe Indonesians love to build bridges. Last April,\r\nwe served as host to the representatives of 106 Asian\r\nand African countries, many of them heads of State or\r\nGovernment, for the Asian-African Summit of 2005.\r\nDuring that historic Summit, we put in place the\r\ncornerstone for a bridge of cooperation across the\r\nIndian Ocean — the New Asian-African Strategic\r\nPartnership — on behalf of the 4.6 billion people of the\r\ntwo continents. Through the Partnership, both\r\ncontinents will intensify their political solidarity,\r\neconomic cooperation and socio-cultural relations,\r\nincluding technical cooperation and human resources\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe establishment of the Partnership was the\r\nmost meaningful way in which we could observe the\r\nGolden Jubilee of the 1955 Asian-African Conference\r\nheld in Bandung, which heralded the emergence of\r\nmany new sovereign nations from the shadow of\r\ncolonialism. In those formative years of ours, we\r\nsought to reform international relations through the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nToday, we feel called upon to seek reform of the\r\nUnited Nations itself, for we are faced with the\r\nformidable challenges of development, security and\r\nhuman rights — three challenges that are interlinked\r\nand interdependent and that cannot be addressed\r\nseparately. We therefore need a United Nations that is\r\nmore effective and efficient and more democratic and\r\naccountable to its Members — an Organization with a\r\nbalanced focus on those three challenges.\r\nWe need a reformed Security Council that is more\r\ndemocratically representative. As the Asia-Pacific\r\nregion is home to more than half of the human race and\r\nis the cradle of ancient civilizations and religions, we\r\nin Indonesia feel that it should have more seats on the\r\nCouncil. Moreover, we must do away with the right of\r\nthe veto.\r\nWe cannot afford to exclude global disarmament\r\nand non-proliferation from our agenda. We are not rid\r\nof the danger of nuclear annihilation. At the same time,\r\ndeveloping countries must be allowed to engage in the\r\npeaceful use of nuclear energy to hasten their\r\ndevelopment.\r\nWe need a Peacebuilding Commission to help\r\ncountries in conflict make the transition from war to\r\ndurable peace. The Commission must work in\r\ncoordination with the Security Council and the\r\nEconomic and Social Council, under the mandate of\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nWith regard to the fight against terrorism, we\r\nhope that a comprehensive convention can be\r\nconcluded soon. International cooperation to address\r\nthis problem should include efforts to deal with its root\r\ncauses. We also hold that no human right may be\r\nsacrificed and that no international law may be violated\r\nin the fight against terrorism.\r\nWe in Indonesia believe that interfaith dialogue\r\nand cooperation to empower moderate voices can\r\nsignificantly reduce violent radicalism. That is why we\r\nhave sponsored and hosted Asia-Pacific and Asian-\r\nEuropean dialogues on interfaith cooperation.\r\nWe urge that the Economic and Social Council be\r\nempowered to effectively review and coordinate\r\ninternational cooperation for development.\r\nThe envisaged Human Rights Council must\r\nuphold human rights as universal, indivisible and\r\ninterdependent. It should be free from politicization\r\nand double standards; instead, it should promote\r\ndialogue as well as concrete cooperation. It should be a\r\nsubsidiary body to the General Assembly.\r\nFinally, no effort aimed at United Nations reform\r\ncan be complete unless it affirms and makes a reality\r\nthe central role of the General Assembly as the main\r\ndeliberative body of the United Nations.\r\nIt may not be realistic to hope that these reforms\r\nwill be realized this week or in the months to come. We\r\n31\r\nA/60/PV.14\r\nthe Members of the United Nations are not sufficiently\r\nin concert to achieve an early breakthrough. But we\r\nwho desire reform must keep faith and persevere.\r\nFor three decades, armed conflict smouldered in\r\nAceh, until it became clear to both sides that the only\r\nway out of a tragic situation was the way of peace. For\r\nmore than three decades, Indonesian reformists\r\nstruggled against the crushing weight of an\r\nauthoritarian regime, until it became clear that our only\r\nway out of the Asian crisis was through democratic\r\nreform.\r\nWe do not know when the moment of truth will\r\ncome for the United Nations. We hope that it will\r\ncome, not in the wake of a crisis, but at the dawning of\r\na more enlightened time. Above all, we must never\r\nlose hope in the Organization’s capacity for reform, its\r\nperfectibility. We must keep on working — even harder\r\nthan before. Then, when the moment of truth comes,\r\nwe will be ready to seize the opportunity.\r\nThe President: I am sure we all agree that there\r\nis special reason to think about the country that was\r\nhardest hit by the tsunami, with 130,000 drowned and\r\n100,000 missing. I wanted to say that because I believe\r\nwe all felt a sense of solidarity and compassion in that\r\nconnection.\r\nI now call on His Excellency Mr. Dimitrij Rupel,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Slovenia.\r\nMr. Rupel (Slovenia) (spoke in Slovenian;\r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): Allow me at\r\nthe outset to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixtieth\r\nsession. I would like to express to you the full support\r\nof the Republic of Slovenia as you carry out that\r\nextremely important and responsible task. May you\r\nhave much vision, courage and resolve as you preside\r\nover the General Assembly during this anniversary year.\r\nMr. Sardenberg (Brazil), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nAt the same time, Sir, I would like to express our\r\nsincere recognition and gratitude for the efforts of your\r\npredecessor, Mr. Jean Ping, President at the fifty-ninth\r\nsession of the General Assembly. His determined\r\nleadership, his insight into the current issues of the\r\nmodern world and his enduring courage enabled him to\r\nguide the General Assembly in its sixtieth year, which\r\npromises to be a year of the greatest significance for\r\nthe future of the Organization.\r\nWe have assembled here to consider together in\r\ngood faith how we should respond to the challenges of\r\nmodern times and how our Organization should be\r\nadapted to the needs of the twenty-first century. We are\r\nhere to act on the basis of our best understanding and\r\nour belief in the achievements of creative development\r\nfor the well-being of the people of the modern world,\r\nto quote, Sir, your illustrious compatriot, Dag\r\nHammarskjöld.\r\nThe outcome document contains numerous\r\nmeaningful and useful ideas. That document’s purpose\r\nis to enhance the effectiveness of the United Nations\r\nand consolidate its mission in the modern world. The\r\nreform of the Organization is of the utmost importance\r\nand was initiated at the right moment. This is a time of\r\nchange for several international organizations and\r\ninstitutions. All are certainly aware of the current\r\ntransformation of the European Union and the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.\r\nSuch changes are difficult. We encounter obstacles\r\nsuch as the rejection of the European Constitutional\r\nTreaty in two referendums.\r\nThe effectiveness of the machinery and the\r\nmission of the United Nations should also be improved\r\nthrough the creation of the Human Rights Council and\r\nthe fight against terrorism. There were many\r\ndiscussions and diverging views on those two questions\r\nin relation to the outcome document. However, we\r\ncannot be successful if we have difficulty even\r\ndefining terrorism or establishing the Human Rights\r\nCouncil. There is some indecisiveness in the outcome\r\ndocument in that respect. With respect to terrorism, the\r\ndocument speaks of dialogue and understanding among\r\ncivilizations. With respect to the Human Rights\r\nCouncil, the outcome document proposes holding\r\nfurther negotiations to establish, among other things,\r\nits mandate and working methods.\r\nIn today’s world, change and certainty are closely\r\nconnected and interdependent. Attaining a balance\r\nbetween them involves values, rules, laws and the\r\ninstitutions of human dignity, equality and democracy —\r\nin short, human rights.\r\nThe fact is, we live in a globalized and\r\ninterdependent world in which we all are responsible\r\nfor our security. It is significant that the outcome\r\ndocument warns that there can be no development\r\nwithout security and no security without development,\r\nand that both development and security depend to a\r\n32\r\nA/60/PV.14\r\ngreat degree on respect for human rights, the rule of\r\nlaw and democracy.\r\nMany efforts have been made to address the\r\nsources of suffering in the world. United Nations\r\nMember States must continue to support efforts to\r\nattain the Millennium Development Goals. Twenty-five\r\nEuropean Union (EU) member States committed\r\nthemselves to the target of allocating 0.7 per cent of\r\ntheir gross domestic product (GDP) to official\r\ndevelopment assistance by 2015. In that context,\r\nSlovenia, one of the 10 new EU members and a new\r\ndonor, committed itself to attaining the target of 0.33\r\nper cent of GDP for development aid. We underline the\r\nneed for the long-term commitment and responsibility\r\nof all countries in order to attain the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nWe are continuously surprised at the changing\r\nnature of the threats facing each and every country.\r\nThe concept of security includes both State security\r\nand the security of the individual. Thus, it is important\r\nto effectively address various issues, in particular\r\ndisarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of\r\nmass destruction, as well as the problem of the\r\nproliferation of illegal small arms and light weapons,\r\nwhich affects numerous countries. We are rather\r\ndisappointed that the outcome document does not\r\ninclude provisions on non-proliferation and\r\ndisarmament, and we hope that work on those issues\r\nwill continue after the summit.\r\nTerrorist attacks on innocent people\r\nfundamentally contradict the value systems of modern\r\ncountries, in particular human rights, as formulated and\r\nstated in international conventions and declarations.\r\nTerrorist attacks are a violation of human rights, which\r\nare the foundation of modern societies; they represent\r\nan assault on the very essence of those societies and\r\nthus negate their very modernity. This negation is\r\nconnected with the complex and paradoxical nature of\r\nthe concept of modernity. It seems that the fundamental\r\nfrustration caused by this complex and paradoxical\r\nnature drives terrorists to commit radical actions.\r\nTerrorism cannot tolerate the complex and paradoxical\r\ncharacter of modern societies.\r\nMeasures in the fight against terrorism are aimed\r\nat those whose actions deny and reject human rights as\r\na fundamental value of modern societies. By\r\nexamining terrorists’ attitudes and the meaning of\r\nterrorism, we should be able to define terrorism. An\r\nagreed definition of terrorism would provide clarity\r\nand help better ensure human rights. The more fully\r\nhuman rights are protected, the more successful we\r\nwill be in our fight against terrorism. Human rights\r\nwill be more fully protected when terrorism is without\r\nprotection. Tolerating or justifying terrorism\r\nundermines human rights.\r\nThat does not mean, however, that we can fail to\r\nrespect human rights in waging our fight against\r\nterrorism. It is precisely universal respect for human\r\nrights and fundamental freedoms, including in the fight\r\nagainst terrorism, that will ensure the success of that\r\nfight and preserve the democratic and free principles of\r\nthose societies which are being targeted by terrorists.\r\nSlovenia welcomes the affirmation of the\r\nprinciple of the responsibility to protect. By endorsing\r\nthat principle, world leaders have made a conceptual\r\nbreakthrough in the prevention of future tragedies like\r\nthose of Srebrenica, Rwanda and Darfur. For the first\r\ntime, we have recognized our national and collective\r\nresponsibility to act in cases of genocide and ethnic\r\ncleansing, war crimes and crimes against humanity.\r\nSlovenia considers the responsibility to protect to be an\r\nintegral part of national responsibility to protect a\r\ncountry’s people against atrocities. It is our\r\nunderstanding that the Security Council shares the\r\nresponsibility to protect and that the use of the veto in\r\nthe Council is fundamentally incompatible with that\r\nresponsibility.\r\nWe welcome the establishment of a Democracy\r\nFund and intend to contribute to it. We strongly support\r\na strengthened role for the Office of the High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights. The strengthened\r\nrole of the Office, to be financed from the United\r\nNations regular budget, is good news for the realization\r\nof human rights on the ground.\r\nThe level of agreement on the Human Rights\r\nCouncil is a disappointment. Numerous countries\r\nwanted and expected more. Unfortunately, for the\r\nmoment, we are left without the necessary vision of a\r\nnew Council, even though, in the preparations for the\r\nsummit, we formulated good proposals for the\r\nCouncil’s structure and mandate.\r\nSlovenia wants a standing Council that is a\r\nprincipal organ of the United Nations, able to deal with\r\nall human rights concerns in all countries at all times.\r\nWe want a Council that better addresses rights and\r\nfreedoms, without double standards. We want a\r\n33\r\nA/60/PV.14\r\nCouncil that could convene and act in every instance of\r\nmassive violation of human rights. We want a Council\r\nable to make recommendations to other organs and\r\nagencies of the United Nations system so that human\r\nrights are truly integrated in all areas of the\r\nOrganization. Finally, we want a Council that reflects\r\nthe diversity of the modern world and that gives a\r\nproper voice to civil society through non-governmental\r\norganizations. In the course of the sixtieth session of\r\nthe General Assembly, Slovenia will continue to\r\nactively support the establishment of a strong and\r\nefficient new Human Rights Council.\r\nI have already mentioned the dialogue of\r\ncivilizations. That dialogue should be based on\r\nuniversal, fundamental values. No differentiation\r\nbetween “us” and “them” should be tolerated. Human\r\nrights and fundamental freedoms are the manifestation\r\nof our common fundamental values. They are the best\r\nanswer for ensuring a dignified life in our globalized,\r\nfast-paced and increasingly unsafe world. On the basis\r\nof our wealth of traditions and history and creative\r\ndiversity, all individuals should be informed of and be\r\nable to realize their rights and freedoms, as this is the\r\nbest long-term foundation for peace and development.\r\nEducating people about human rights and dignity is a\r\nprerequisite for this goal, and we are thrilled to see that\r\nthe need for such education is properly reflected in the\r\noutcome document. As a member State of the Human\r\nSecurity Network we are pleased that the issue of\r\nhuman security has been included in the outcome\r\ndocument of the High-level Plenary Meeting and will\r\ncontinue to be discussed in the General Assembly.\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and\r\nregional organizations deserves our priority attention in\r\nfuture. As experiences from a variety of geographic\r\nenvironments and conditions have shown — in\r\nparticular in South-Eastern Europe and Africa —\r\nsynergetic cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nregional organizations can be very effective.\r\nAs Chairman-in-Office of the Organization for\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), I call for\r\nthe elaboration of a binding framework for permanent\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and that\r\nimportant regional organization as soon as possible.\r\nFor 30 years now, OSCE has proved effective in very\r\nsensitive regions of the world. This year marks the\r\nthirtieth anniversary of the Helsinki Final Act, which\r\nestablished OSCE. Thirty years ago, the integration of\r\nEast and West began. Today, our main duty is to\r\nintegrate civilizations. One of the areas that should be\r\nfurther developed is strengthening dialogue among\r\ncivilizations. It may be that the supreme importance of\r\nour outcome document rests on that dialogue.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His\r\nExcellency Mr. Norman José Caldera Cardenal,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Nicaragua.\r\nMr. Caldera Cardenal (Nicaragua) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): The struggle for democracy being waged by\r\nNicaragua has transcended our borders, arousing\r\nfeelings of solidarity and support in different parts of\r\nthe world. The Nicaraguan people raised their voice\r\nand they were heard by Central America. From there,\r\nwith the added strength of the seven fraternal countries\r\nthat joined it, that voice resounded throughout the\r\nAndean Community, Mexico, the United States of\r\nAmerica, Canada, the Rio Group, the Organization of\r\nAmerican States (OAS), the European Union and\r\nJapan, to mention only the most recent cases. Indeed,\r\nthe echo of that voice has reverberated at the United\r\nNations in various reports and resolutions.\r\nFrom this rostrum in the General Assembly Hall,\r\nI would like to convey to Member States the deep\r\ngratitude of the Nicaraguan people for the solidarity\r\nthey have shown to us.\r\nWe come to the sixtieth session of the General\r\nAssembly at a turning point for our future, for we are\r\nin the throes of a struggle for democracy, a struggle to\r\nkeep us from returning to our dark days and make them\r\na thing of the past. Like the peoples of other United\r\nNations Members who have fought for their freedom,\r\nthousands of Nicaraguans have died for it, victims of a\r\nperverse pendulum that swung from authoritarianism to\r\ntotalitarianism. The lessons learned in those years left\r\nus a legacy that acknowledges the supreme value of\r\nfreedom, democracy and, above all, peace.\r\nOver the past four years, we have been striving\r\nfor national revitalization and institutional overhaul\r\nbased on transparency, freedom, the rule of law, social\r\nequality and individual initiative.\r\nTo carry out that Herculean task, we needed to\r\novercome the errors of the past. That is why, with\r\nsupport from the rest of our continent, we have\r\nengaged in a frontal attack on corruption and impunity.\r\nWe have also attempted to restore independence and\r\nintegrity to our institutions, held hostage by private and\r\npartisan interests. Those efforts include the legal\r\n34\r\nA/60/PV.14\r\nsphere, where the absolute impartiality and objectivity\r\nof judges and magistrates, as well as an inclusive\r\nelectoral system capable of ensuring respect for a\r\npopular vote cast in freedom, are imperative. It also\r\nrequires that institutions act in the service of the higher\r\ninterests of the nation and do not become weapons in\r\npolitical vendettas, used in campaigns to intimidate\r\npublic officials in the executive branch.\r\nThe forces conniving to oppose democracy\r\nresponded by escalating the breakdown in the\r\nconstitutional order and the legitimate exercise of\r\npower. They then attempted to upset the balance of\r\npower, an essential principal of representative\r\ndemocracy in the inter-American system. The\r\nopposition attempted to execute a new type of coup\r\nd’état, corrupting State institutions by using them as\r\ninstruments of political coercion. Instead of accepting\r\nthe separation of powers, they appropriated the\r\ndistribution of power, attempting to modify the powers\r\nof the President retroactively without consulting the\r\nNicaraguan people. Only the Nicaraguan people can\r\nconfer national sovereignty and presidential power, as\r\nthey did at the polls in November 2001.\r\nIn the light of those threats to democracy, we\r\nhave harnessed all our available resources under\r\nnational legislation and international law. The Central\r\nAmerican Court of Justice, the judicial arm of the\r\nCentral American Integration System and rooted in\r\ndemocratic values, handed down a far-reaching\r\ndecision on 29 March 2005 recognizing the separation\r\nof powers as a democratic principle. Under the Inter-\r\nAmerican Democratic Charter, we also turned to the\r\nOrganization of American States, which affirmed that\r\nthe disturbing turn of events in Nicaragua was\r\ncompromising the balance of power and the\r\nGovernment’s legitimate exercise of power.\r\nTo overcome that situation, President Enrique\r\nBolaños has expressed his continuing willingness to\r\nlaunch a broad national dialogue with all sectors. This\r\ndoes not mean, however — as the forces attempting to\r\ndestroy our institutions have claimed — a dialogue\r\naimed at surrendering democracy. Nor should it be a\r\ndialogue in which a gun is held to the President’s head\r\nto force him to make concessions that would lead to a\r\nnew type of dictatorship in Nicaragua — one never\r\nbefore seen in the history of Latin America — one that\r\nwould bring back the trials and tribulations of earlier\r\nyears and put an end to freedom and dash the\r\ndemocratic hopes of the Nicaraguan people and all\r\nnations. On the contrary, as the Organization of\r\nAmerican States itself has said in its resolutions, it is a\r\ndialogue aimed at seeking democratic solutions, free\r\nfrom pressure, threats and coercion, and aimed at the\r\ncessation of any actions that could exacerbate the crisis\r\nand prevent the restoration of the balance of power.\r\nWe deplore the murder of journalists in any part\r\nof the world. In particular, we are concerned by the\r\nmurders of three Nicaraguan journalists that took place\r\nover the past three years. We are concerned not only\r\nbecause the criminals cut short precious human lives,\r\nbut also because the murders came at the height of the\r\nelectoral campaign and constituted an attempt to\r\nterrorize our journalists and suppress freedom of\r\nexpression in our young democracy. By attacking\r\nfreedom of expression, they are harming the\r\ndemocratic processes. Those forces are well aware that\r\nfreedom of expression is the voice of democracy.\r\nFreedom of expression protects all the other\r\nfundamental rights; without it, freedom loses its\r\nsustenance and democracy is orphaned.\r\nWe will continue doing our utmost to punish the\r\nguilty and break up all networks of terror and\r\nintimidation.\r\nWe are aware of the importance of the upcoming\r\nelectoral processes for democracy in Nicaragua. Under\r\nthe present circumstances, we must guarantee the\r\nNicaraguan people that every vote will be duly\r\nregistered, counted and respected, and that their sacred\r\nright to elect their authorities in conditions of absolute\r\nfreedom will not be violated. As a result, we have\r\nasked the Secretary-General for technical assistance\r\nfrom the United Nations specialized agencies to help\r\nus hold elections and strengthen our democracy,\r\ncomplementing the work being carried out by the\r\nOrganization of American States with assistance of the\r\nEuropean Union.\r\nDespite the energy, resources and efforts diverted\r\nfrom development in order to preserve democracy,\r\nNicaragua has made major strides towards fulfilling the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. Destabilizing actions\r\nhave not stopped the Nicaraguan people from\r\nbeginning to enjoy the first fruits of the war against\r\ncorruption and to benefit from an honest and\r\ntransparent civil service that has succeeded in\r\nattracting foreign investment and winning the\r\nconfidence of the international community.\r\n35\r\nA/60/PV.14\r\nThe latest gauge of President Bolaños’s success\r\nin enabling more and more Nicaraguans to lead a\r\ndecent life can be found in the Human Development\r\nReport 2005, which states that we have progressed\r\nfrom the 118th to the 112th position. The best medium-\r\nterm strategy for sustainable poverty reduction is to\r\ngain access to new markets and make international\r\ntrade the driving force of growth, combining economic\r\ngrowth with social development in order to develop our\r\nhuman capital.\r\nThe Government of Nicaragua is promoting\r\nratification of the Central American Free Trade\r\nAgreement between Central America, the Dominican\r\nRepublic and the United States of America, which\r\nseeks to strengthen our economy, integrate us into the\r\nworld and raise our population’s standard of living,\r\nparticularly that of the poorest sectors.\r\nWe welcomed with hope the words of President\r\nBush in his statement to this Assembly:\r\n“A successful Doha Round will reduce and\r\neliminate tariffs and other barriers on farm and\r\nindustrial goods. It will end unfair agricultural\r\nsubsidies ... Under Doha, every nation will gain —\r\nand the developing world stands to gain the\r\nmost.” (A/60/PV.2, p. 8)\r\nMay that be the case.\r\nI am pleased to announce that in accordance with\r\nthe request made by the heads of State and Government\r\nof the Central American Integration System to\r\nPresident Vicente Fox of Mexico on 12 September, we\r\nare today sending his Government the information that\r\nwill make it possible to explore innovative finance\r\nmechanisms to help our countries deal with the crisis\r\ncaused by the international price of oil.\r\nPoverty is a multi-dimensional phenomenon\r\nassociated with economic and structural problems. The\r\nreduction of unemployment and social inequality and\r\nthe expansion of social investment are determining\r\nfactors for human development: in other words,\r\nsustainable economic growth within a democratic\r\nframework based on social and gender equality.\r\nThe Government of Nicaragua is carrying out\r\nsocial programmes to protect the rights and satisfy the\r\nbasic needs of the most vulnerable sectors of\r\nNicaraguan society — women, children, young people,\r\nthe elderly and persons with disabilities. This\r\nprotection extends to Nicaraguans abroad.\r\nWe reaffirm our priority commitment to\r\npromoting respect for the dignity of all our migrants,\r\nwho, with their work and their efforts, contribute to\r\nsocio-economic development, that of their host country\r\nand that of their home country.\r\nA duty of justice and solidarity moves Nicaragua\r\nto raise its voice in support of the just and legitimate\r\naspiration of the Republic of China on Taiwan to\r\nbecome a member of the universal forum of the United\r\nNations. The more than 20 million nationals of that\r\ncountry deserve to be regarded as an integral part of\r\nthe peoples of the United Nations.\r\nNicaragua is grateful to the Central American\r\nIntegration System for endorsing our candidacy for a\r\nnon-permanent seat on the Security Council for the\r\n2006-2007 term, reflecting the right of countries with\r\nsmall economies to be represented on an equal footing.\r\nAt a time of reform of the Organization, Nicaragua is\r\nalso grateful for the significant support it has received\r\nthus far and affirms its resolve to continue seeking the\r\nsupport of all Member States.\r\nWe hope to be elected and to share our experience\r\nin areas such as peacekeeping and peacebuilding and to\r\nsupport the just aspiration of developing countries to\r\nparticipate fully in decisions concerning security, with\r\nall the responsibility, benefits and consequences that\r\nthat implies.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His\r\nExcellency Mr. Ali Rodríguez Araque, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Bolivarian Republic of\r\nVenezuela.\r\nMr. Rodríguez Araque (Venezuela) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): At the end of the first five years of the third\r\nmillennium, this Organization must go through a phase\r\nof maturity after sixty years of life, enough time to\r\nhave formed a collective understanding of the major\r\nproblems still facing mankind and to find the most\r\neffective ways to address them. Recent facts show that\r\nthis is the reality that we shall have to deal with for\r\nsome time in the future.\r\nThere are many challenges facing the United\r\nNations, both internal and global problems. By way of\r\nillustration, I should like to refer to two of those\r\nchallenges: one internal, namely, the much-needed\r\ndemocratization of this Organization and the other\r\nexternal, the problem of poverty, which is the most\r\nimportant, growing and alarming problem of\r\n36\r\nA/60/PV.14\r\ncontemporary society. I should like to invite all\r\ndelegations to give these two problems careful thought.\r\nDemocracy, at the current stage of human\r\ndevelopment, is the highest form of political\r\norganization. Democracy, owing to its very nature and\r\nas a vital condition, implies the equal exercise of rights\r\nas the ideal way to reach the best possible living\r\nconditions. What is valid for one country taken\r\nindividually applies even more to organizations in\r\nwhich many sovereign nations are represented, all with\r\nequal rights.\r\nThe United Nations is the most emblematic case\r\nin the modern society of nations. As a result, it should\r\nbe the true embodiment and example of the equal\r\nexercise of democratic rights. If we agree on this basic\r\nprinciple, one question immediately comes to mind: is\r\nthis Organization a democratic institution? Are its\r\npractices useful, as we have seen in very recent\r\ndecisions adopted by a small number of Members in a\r\ndocument presented in the first meeting? Is this a\r\nuseful example of a transparent democratic exercise on\r\nthe part of the sovereign nations represented here?\r\nThe answer, regrettably, is a resounding “no”. On\r\nthe contrary, what we have seen is a dangerous process\r\nin which oligarchies are being built, where a small\r\ngroup of countries usurp the right to take decisions\r\nwithout taking into account the vast majority of\r\ncountries that ultimately represent the overwhelming\r\nmajority of the global population. This is what usually\r\nhappens with matters affecting the fate of billions of\r\nhuman beings.\r\nFor those reasons, when we talk about reform, the\r\nfirst thing to do is to define the nature of this reform,\r\nwhich can have no other goal than the democratization\r\nof this Organization. That means giving decision-\r\nmaking power in fundamental matters to the General\r\nAssembly and ending once and for all the\r\nOrganization’s oligarchic and, very often, autocratic\r\npractices, which diminish its authority in the eyes of\r\nthe world.\r\nIn our humble but firm opinion, this is the major\r\nchallenge the Organization faces internally. Its very\r\nexistence depends on the successful resolution of this\r\nissue. We have no doubt about that, and let us not\r\ndoubt it.\r\nIn the external sphere, the most important\r\nchallenge lies in the agonizing escalation that daily\r\ntraps millions of human beings living in poverty.\r\nPoverty — as we have heard here in many statements —\r\nis the result of an unjust system of distribution of the\r\nearthly goods of men that therefore denies men any\r\nspiritual value. It is an unfair system of distribution\r\nthat stems from a distorted matrix whose dominant\r\nforce is a ruthless thirst for profit and in which\r\ngrowing wealth is based on the expansion and\r\ndeepening of poverty. This is the reality that we see\r\nday after day, not only, to the surprise of many, in the\r\nso-called poor countries, but also in countries where\r\nopulence is obscenely on display, every second,\r\nthrough the mass media, attracting millions of people\r\nwho are trying to improve their living conditions, only\r\nto crash into a wall raised by those who preach market\r\nfreedom and the free movement of capital but who do\r\nnot tolerate the movement of human beings except\r\nwhen they are needed as a labour force to further\r\nexpand their wealth.\r\nThis is the painful truth that the tragedy of\r\nKatrina has revealed. It is a painful reality that has\r\nprofoundly shaken all of those for whom nothing about\r\nhuman beings is strange, wherever it may occur.\r\nThese problems should have become the focal\r\npoints of the entire document that was approved in a\r\nstrange “consensus” — a word I do not hesitate to\r\nplace between quotation marks. Little attention has\r\nbeen paid to this drama. But the drama is there; it is\r\nboiling across the world. That generates instability,\r\nbecause if there is one thing that human society is not\r\nmade for, it is suicide. It seeks desperate forms of\r\nsurvival, and that is why, as the great Peruvian Cesar\r\nVallejo said once, it lights its captive torch and prays\r\nangrily. These are days of suffering but also days of\r\nanger in many parts of the world, and that generates\r\ninstability. If we want stability in the world, let us\r\napply social justice, a new system of distribution\r\namong regions and a new system of solidarity for\r\ndistribution within nations that cannot be limited to\r\ncharity or assistance often delivered under humiliating\r\nconditions.\r\nThere are many ideas that bring us to this\r\nmeeting, I am sure. On some of the most important\r\nproblems we have already defined our position in\r\nprevious statements. We will continue doing so in this\r\nsession. For the time being, we would simply add a\r\nbasic item: how difficult it is to realize man’s\r\ndemocratic dream when man finds himself prevented\r\nfrom satisfying his most basic conditions for a life of\r\n37\r\nA/60/PV.14\r\ndignity: health, nutrition, a roof over his head and the\r\nopportunity to enjoy basic rights.\r\nWe trust in the wisdom of the peoples and the\r\nnew leadership that through its voice speaks for silent\r\nmillions. We trust in the struggle of those who, as the\r\ngreat Martí said, have thrown in their lot with the poor\r\nof the earth. Thus some day, in the not-so-distant\r\nfuture, we will find ourselves in a better world, with a\r\nlife worth living and a United Nations strengthened by\r\nthe essential values of men and women of dignity, who\r\nare the majority on this planet.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His\r\nExcellency Mr. Mohammed Abdulla Al-Rumaihi,\r\nDeputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Qatar.\r\nMr. Al-Rumaihi (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): It\r\ngives me great pleasure at the outset to extend to you,\r\nMr. President, our congratulations upon your election\r\nto the presidency of this sixtieth session of the General\r\nAssembly. We wish you every success in discharging\r\nyour functions. I would also like to extend thanks and\r\nappreciation to your predecessor, His Excellency\r\nMr. Jean Ping, for his valuable efforts in conducting\r\nthe work of the Assembly’s fifty-ninth session,\r\nespecially his efforts to reach a consensus on the final\r\ndocument of the world summit of 2005.\r\nI would also like to thank His Excellency\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations, for his tireless efforts to strengthen the role of\r\nour international Organization.\r\nWorld leaders who met at United Nations\r\nHeadquarters to follow up on the outcome of the\r\nMillennium Summit and the coordinated and integrated\r\nimplementation and follow-up of the outcomes of the\r\nmajor United Nations conferences and summits in the\r\nsocial, economic and related fields have managed to\r\nadopt a document that calls for implementing reforms\r\nin the United Nations and for taking bolder collective\r\nsteps to combat poverty, achieve development,\r\nestablish international security and uphold human\r\nrights.\r\nThe world today is experiencing extremely\r\ndifficult economic conditions which pose a real threat\r\nto the process of social and economic development in\r\nthe developing countries, especially the least developed\r\ncountries, and pose a major threat to the development\r\nof their peoples. That situation is the result of such\r\nfactors as a decline in official development assistance;\r\nunfair international terms of trade; the imposition of\r\nrestrictions on the access of their exports to world\r\nmarkets; unfair prices for their commodity exports; a\r\nheavy external debt burden; and the adverse effects of\r\nglobalization.\r\nDespite the progress made in many fields of\r\ninternational cooperation, the problems of hunger,\r\npoverty and such diseases as AIDS, malaria and\r\ntuberculosis have taken on horrific dimensions and\r\ncontinue to pose major challenges to the international\r\ncommunity. Unless the latter makes concerted efforts\r\nto accelerate equitable development in the developing\r\ncountries, especially the least developed countries, the\r\nMillennium Goal of halving poverty by 2015 will\r\nremain elusive.\r\nThe international community, by resolving, at the\r\nMillennium Summit, to declare war on poverty by\r\nlaunching an ongoing campaign to make the right to\r\ndevelopment a reality for all peoples, has made an\r\nimplicit commitment to creating a social, economic and\r\npolitical environment in the developing countries,\r\nespecially the least developed countries, that would be\r\nmore favourable to the translation into concrete reality\r\nof the right to development for all of their peoples.\r\nThat would provide cohesion and equitable social\r\nintegration for their societies as well as a real\r\nopportunity to eradicate poverty, enabling them to\r\nenjoy full, productive and gainful employment. The\r\ninternational community also resolved at the\r\nMillennium Summit to seek to achieve a fair and just\r\nglobalization that embraces everyone, in order to spare\r\nthe developing countries, especially the least developed\r\ncountries, the danger of being marginalized within the\r\ninternational economy.\r\nAt the Millennium Summit, world leaders\r\naffirmed that international cooperation was the most\r\nimportant factor in making the world a better place to\r\nlive in. They also affirmed that free trade,\r\nliberalization of the economy and interdependence are\r\nthe best means to accelerate equitable economic\r\ndevelopment in the developing countries.\r\nThe international community is at a critical stage\r\nof the negotiations related to the Doha Development\r\nAgenda. Those negotiations made concrete progress\r\nlast year in some difficult and controversial areas.\r\nAgreement was reached on the launching of\r\nnegotiations regarding the question of trade\r\nconcessions, one of the four questions which were left,\r\n38\r\nA/60/PV.14\r\nby agreement, outside the scope of the Doha\r\nProgramme of Action: investment, competition, trade\r\nand environment and trade concessions. However, that\r\nagreement by the developed countries was, regrettably,\r\nconditional on the non-holding of negotiations on the\r\nother three questions.\r\nWe are looking forward to the achievement of\r\nsolid, ambitious progress at the sixth World Trade\r\nOrganization Conference in Hong Kong, and we hope\r\nthat we will be able to conclude negotiations in 2006.\r\nThe developing countries have fulfilled their\r\npledges, and we hope that the upcoming negotiations\r\nregarding the implementation of the outcome of this\r\nsummit will translate into reality the global partnership\r\nfor the achievement of the internationally agreed\r\ndevelopment goals. We hope that the right to\r\ndevelopment will become a living reality and that the\r\ndeveloped countries will honour their pledges,\r\nincluding increasing official development assistance to\r\n0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product, and will\r\naccelerate the process of forgiving the external debt of\r\nall poor countries.\r\nWe have often stated that peace in the Middle\r\nEast can be achieved only through the implementation\r\nof the resolutions of the Security Council and of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. All of those resolutions recognize\r\nthe legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, foremost\r\namong which is the right to self-determination and to\r\nthe establishment of their independent State on their\r\nnational soil, with Al-Quds as its capital; withdrawal\r\nfrom the occupied Golan Heights up to the border of\r\n4 June 1967; and full withdrawal from the rest of the\r\nLebanese territories still under occupation.\r\nOn that basis, the international mediation process\r\nproduced the road map, which affirms the principle of\r\nland for peace and calls for the withdrawal of Israel\r\nfrom the occupied territories and the establishment of\r\nthe State of Palestine.\r\nThe Arab summit, meeting in Beirut in March\r\n2002, endorsed an international initiative calling for\r\nthe normalization of relations between the Arab States\r\nand Israel in return for Israel’s withdrawal to the 1967\r\nborder.\r\nThe Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip is an\r\nimportant and positive first step, which, we hope, will\r\nbe followed by similar steps in all the Palestinian\r\nterritories and the other occupied Arab territories, in\r\naccordance with internationally binding resolutions and\r\nthe relevant initiatives and agreements, in order to\r\nbring about stability, security and a comprehensive and\r\njust peace for all States and peoples of the region.\r\nI cannot fail to mention the difficult conditions\r\nexperienced by the fraternal Iraqi people. We hope that\r\nthe new constitution will embody the hopes and\r\naspirations of the Iraqi people and contribute to the\r\nestablishment of security and stability in the country.\r\nWe hope also that it will take into consideration the\r\ninterests of all segments of the Iraqi population, that all\r\nthe people will feel that they all are part of the\r\nestablished system, and that the unity and the national\r\nidentity of Iraq will be preserved.\r\nBelieving as it does in the great importance of the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\n(NPT) to international peace and security, the State of\r\nQatar has acceded to the Treaty and calls from this\r\nrostrum on all States to do so. It also seeks to transform\r\nthe Middle East region into a zone that is totally free\r\nfrom all kinds of weapons of mass destruction.\r\nMy country has unambiguously condemned\r\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. It has also\r\nsupported all Security Council resolutions related to\r\nthe question of terrorism, and it has cooperated with\r\nthe international community in implementing those\r\nagreements. However, we feel that success in\r\neradicating that phenomenon requires that we deal with\r\nits underlying causes, including the social, economic\r\nand political aspects that provide a fertile breeding\r\nground for terrorism.\r\nWe also support the idea of convening an\r\ninternational conference on terrorism and of drawing\r\nup an international strategy to combat it. In that\r\ncontext, we feel that defining terrorism and clearly\r\ndistinguishing it from the struggle waged by peoples in\r\nexercise of their legitimate right to defend their\r\nfreedom and enjoy self-determination must be the most\r\nimportant norm and enjoy international consensus.\r\nThis is a right that is enshrined in all international\r\nnorms and practices.\r\nOur world today more than ever needs a\r\ncomprehensive authority and frame of reference that is\r\nqualified to perform its role as an international\r\ninstrument; one that seeks to achieve international\r\ncooperation in resolving international problems of a\r\nsocial and economic nature, as well as consolidating\r\nsecurity and stability, maintaining international peace,\r\n39\r\nA/60/PV.14\r\nand enhancing respect for human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms for all. Moreover, we must\r\nearnestly seek to respect this global diversity, protect it\r\nand allow it to prosper.\r\nHence, we feel that the proposal to establish a\r\nstanding Human Rights Council, with a smaller\r\nmembership, to be elected by a two-thirds majority\r\nonly, merits further study in serious intergovernmental\r\nnegotiations, with a view to achieving consensus on the\r\nestablishment of the proposed Council, its membership,\r\nits mandate, and the organ destined to be its parent\r\nbody, which we hope will be the General Assembly.\r\nWe must commit ourselves to human rights, as\r\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter, and we must\r\nfully comply with internationally recognized human\r\nrights standards.\r\nThe question of expanding the Security Council\r\nand the concept of collective security require further\r\nstudy and intergovernmental negotiations so as to\r\narrive at a consensus on these important questions.\r\nIn this context, we support the Secretary-General\r\non the question of reforming the United Nations\r\nSecretariat for the reasons indicated in his report\r\nentitled “In Larger Freedom”. However, we feel that\r\nany proposals to reform the Secretariat are extremely\r\nimportant and must be the subject of careful study,\r\ndiscussion and negotiation by the General Assembly.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the general debate for this meeting.\r\nSeveral representatives have indicated their wish\r\nto exercise the right of reply. May I remind members\r\nthat statements in exercise of the right of reply are\r\nlimited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and five\r\nminutes for the possible second intervention and\r\nshould be made by delegations from their seats.\r\nI shall now call on those representatives who\r\nwish to speak in exercise of the right of reply.\r\nMr. Williams (United Kingdom): I am taking the\r\nfloor in right of reply to the remarks made yesterday by\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Rafael Bielsa, Minister for Foreign\r\nRelations, International Trade and Worship of the\r\nArgentine Republic, on the sovereignty of the Falkland\r\nIslands.\r\nThe United Kingdom’s position on this issue is\r\nwell known and was last set out in detail by the United\r\nKingdom’s Permanent Representative to the United\r\nNations, Sir Emyr Jones Parry, in a written right of\r\nreply to the statement by His Excellency President\r\nNéstor Carlos Kirchner of the Argentine Republic in\r\nthe High-level Plenary Meeting of the General\r\nAssembly on 14 September 2005.\r\nThe United Kingdom has no doubts about its\r\nsovereignty over the Falkland Islands. There can be no\r\nnegotiations on the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands\r\nunless and until such time as the islanders so wish.\r\nMr. Alaei (Islamic Republic of Iran): This\r\nmorning the Foreign Minister of the United Arab\r\nEmirates made some unacceptable claims against the\r\nterritorial integrity of my country.\r\nAs we have clearly and repeatedly placed on\r\nrecord our position on this issue on previous occasions,\r\nI do not need to go into detail. The Islamic Republic of\r\nIran is fully committed to its international obligations,\r\nespecially those arising from the Memorandum of\r\nUnderstanding of 1971. We firmly believe that\r\nmisunderstandings over the interpretation or\r\napplication of that Memorandum of Understanding, if\r\nany, should be addressed with goodwill and through\r\nmutually agreed mechanisms in order to find an\r\nacceptable solution.\r\nMeanwhile, my Government has always\r\nwelcomed the interaction and exchange of views\r\nbetween officials of Iran and the United Arab Emirates\r\non issues of interest and concern to both our countries.\r\nWe believe that dialogue between our two\r\nGovernments can play a determining role in removing\r\nany existing misunderstandings.\r\nMr. Desmoures (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nWith respect to what has been said by the\r\nrepresentative of the United Kingdom on the question\r\nof the Malvinas Islands, the delegation of Argentina\r\nreiterates in full the statement that was made yesterday\r\nby the Minister for Foreign Affairs, International Trade\r\nand Worship of Argentina before this Assembly. In this\r\nrespect, let it be recalled that, as was determined by the\r\nUnited Nations on several occasions, the form of\r\nputting an end to the dispute over the sovereignty,\r\nreferring to the question of the Malvinas Islands, is\r\nonly through bilateral negotiations between the\r\nGovernments of the Argentine Republic and the United\r\nKingdom.\r\nArgentina reiterates its willingness to undertake\r\nsuch negotiations.\r\n40\r\nA/60/PV.14\r\nMr. Al-Mazroui (United Arab Emirates) (spoke\r\nin Arabic): With regard to the statement made by the\r\nrepresentative of the Islamic Republic of Iran on Iran’s\r\noccupation of the three islands of the United Arab\r\nEmirates, I would merely state that the United Arab\r\nEmirates, which has repeatedly expressed its principled\r\nand firm position on this national issue, wishes to\r\nexpress its extreme disappointment over the false\r\nclaims made by the Iranian representative. Those\r\nclaims reflect the illegitimate behaviour of the Iranian\r\nGovernment, which ignores all the historical, legal and\r\ndemographic facts that prove these three islands — the\r\nGreater Tunb, the Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa — fall\r\nunder the sovereignty of the United Arab Emirates.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates would like to reiterate\r\nthat the Iranian presence in these United Arab Emirates\r\nislands since 1971 is an illegal military occupation and\r\nin form and content violates the tenets of all\r\ninternational relations, the United Nations Charter and\r\nrelevant international law. It must therefore be\r\nremoved.\r\nI also wish to reiterate the words of our Foreign\r\nMinister in a speech today, who called on the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran to reconsider the policy of occupying\r\nthe islands and to respond in a serious manner to the\r\npeace initiatives that have been proposed by the\r\nGovernment of the United Arab Emirates in order to\r\nsettle this issue peacefully, either through bilateral and\r\nconstructive, peaceful negotiations that would remedy\r\nthe reasons for this crisis, or by referring it to the\r\nInternational Court of Justice and abiding by the\r\nCourt’s legal decision in order to guarantee a just,\r\ncomprehensive and lasting solution; this would\r\nstrengthen good-neighbourly ties and cooperation\r\nbetween our two countries and peoples and consolidate\r\nstability, security, peace and development in the\r\nArabian Gulf area.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the\r\nspeakers in their exercise of the right of reply.\r\nOrganization of work\r\nThe Acting President: I would like to inform\r\nmembers that the meeting of the General Assembly to\r\nconsider the first report of the General Committee,\r\ndocument A/60/250, originally scheduled for this\r\nevening, has been postponed until tomorrow,\r\n20 September, in the evening, immediately following\r\nthe adjournment of the general debate. The reason —\r\nas representatives may guess — is that there have been\r\nsome problems with the electrical circuits in the\r\nbuilding, which has led to computers and telephones\r\nnot working. Because of the logistical problems\r\nfollowing that breakdown, the General Committee\r\nmeeting will be postponed. Perhaps representatives\r\nwill convey that information to their colleagues who\r\nare working on the General Committee.\r\nThe meeting rose at 7.20 p.m.\r\n"
