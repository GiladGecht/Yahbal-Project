(Sweden)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Anote Tong, President of the\r\nRepublic of Kiribati\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Kiribati.\r\nMr. Anote Tong, President of the Republic of\r\nKiribati, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Anote Tong, President of\r\nthe Republic of Kiribati, and to invite him to address\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Tong: Please accept my\r\ncongratulations, Sir, on your election to the presidency,\r\nand my assurances that Kiribati will support you during\r\nyour term of office. I would also like to take this\r\nopportunity to thank the outgoing President, Mr. Jean\r\nPing, for his able and effective leadership during the\r\nfifty-ninth session.\r\nDuring last week’s High-level Plenary Meeting,\r\nwe discussed, among other issues, the future of this\r\nOrganization and what we expect from it. We heard about\r\nthe achievements made by our Organization over the past\r\n60 years. We express our gratitude to all nations for the\r\ncooperation and support that led to those achievements.\r\nI would like to congratulate the Secretary-General as\r\nwell as his staff, for his leadership of our Organization\r\nat these difficult and trying times.\r\nWe also heard about the shortcomings of our\r\nOrganization. While we recognize and fully endorse\r\nthe need for reform in the Organization, we are\r\nconcerned that many of the shortcomings in terms of\r\nthe promotion of sustainable development in Member\r\nnations, in particular in the small island developing\r\nStates, are the result of our inability to deliver on\r\ncommitments made in the past.\r\nIndividual Member nations have the prime\r\nresponsibility for achieving sustainable development\r\nwithin their borders, but with globalization and the\r\nincreasing interdependency of our world, individual\r\nnations cannot achieve sustainable development acting\r\nalone. To attain sustainable development in small\r\nisland developing States, the need for external\r\ncooperation and support is understandably more\r\npronounced.\r\nHaving taken stock of progress over the past 60\r\nyears, the challenge now is to consider measures by\r\nwhich we can collectively and through the United\r\nNations address the needs and concerns highlighted\r\nduring the High-level Plenary Meeting. Of particular\r\nconcern are the special needs of the least developed\r\ncountries and small island developing States.\r\nWhile Kiribati may be categorized as a least\r\ndeveloped country and a small island developing State,\r\nthe people of Kiribati have a genuine desire to develop\r\nthemselves and at the same time to develop their\r\ncountry. As their elected representatives, we have a\r\nclear mandate and duty to make our best efforts to meet\r\ntheir development aspirations.\r\n2\r\nA/60/PV.15\r\nPopulation issues are a major challenge in our\r\ndevelopment efforts. Concerted efforts to promote\r\neffective family planning have been given greater\r\nfocus in our national development strategies. The\r\ngrowing number of unemployed youth brings with it\r\nnew social issues. We are committed to directing the\r\nenergy of our youth to productive and worthwhile\r\npursuits. Employment opportunities abroad for both\r\nmen and women, such as the arrangements in place\r\nwith foreign shipping companies, fishing companies\r\nand cruise operators, will be expanded and new\r\nopportunities explored. The New Zealand Government’s\r\nPacific Access Category scheme is a very welcome\r\nmodel that merits closer scrutiny by other countries.\r\nThe spiralling cost of fuel is an issue of grave\r\nconcern to us. The impact of rising fuel costs has been\r\nhardest on the least developed countries, which are also\r\nthe least able to afford it. Therefore, the need to\r\naccelerate the development of alternative sources of\r\nenergy, including clean and renewable energy, is now\r\ngreater than it ever was.\r\nWe firmly believe that our fishery resources can\r\nprovide us with the basis for achieving a sustainable\r\nfuture, but in order to be able to do so, we shall need\r\nthe assistance of our development partners in providing\r\nthe necessary incentives through the provision of credit\r\nschemes to those investors who are able and willing to\r\ndevelop onshore facilities within resource-owning\r\ncountries.\r\nBut before we can achieve that, and if we are to\r\nachieve our Millennium Development Goals, we shall\r\ncontinue to be reliant on the official development\r\nassistance target of 0.7 per cent of gross national\r\nincome being met.\r\nEnvironmental issues and, in particular, climate\r\nchange and sea-level rise are security issues for\r\ncountries comprising low-lying coral atolls, such as\r\nKiribati. A global and concerted effort, including\r\nstronger political commitment, is required to achieve\r\nthe objectives of the United Nations Framework\r\nConvention on Climate Change.\r\nWe are appreciative of the support we have\r\nreceived and continue to receive in developing\r\nadaptation measures to climate change and sea-level\r\nrise. We nevertheless acknowledge the need now to\r\nseriously consider the option of having to relocate our\r\npeoples when necessary — an option that can be\r\nmeaningfully addressed only within this forum.\r\nKiribati fully endorses the need for\r\ncomprehensive reform in the United Nations. The\r\nenvironment in which the Organization now operates is\r\nso very different from that of 1945. Reform must take\r\nplace to ensure that the Organization continues to be a\r\nrelevant institution for its Member countries.\r\nTerrorism threatens all. Kiribati condemns\r\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations and we\r\nsupport the global fight against terrorism. We have\r\nnoted with increasing alarm the globalization of terror.\r\nWe cannot afford to be complacent about terrorism and\r\nwill contribute, within our resource constraints, to the\r\nwar against terror. We seek support from those able and\r\nwilling in the implementation and enforcement of\r\ncounter-terrorism legislation we have passed in\r\ncompliance with our obligations as a member of the\r\nglobal community.\r\nKiribati has contributed to the Regional\r\nAssistance Mission to the Solomon Islands. We will\r\ncontinue to contribute to that regional effort as long as\r\nthere is need. Kiribati is also interested in contributing\r\ncivilian police to peacekeeping missions of the United\r\nNations.\r\nKiribati supports an expansion of the permanent\r\nand non-permanent membership of the Security Council.\r\nIn our view, those countries, such as Japan, that are\r\nsignificant contributors to United Nations programmes\r\npromoting peace, security and development merit a\r\npermanent seat on the Security Council.\r\nAs we consider reform of the United Nations and\r\nas we celebrate 60 years of the United Nations, we\r\nbelieve that now is also the time to consider the issue\r\nof Taiwan and its 23 million people. Taiwan is a\r\ncountry where democracy thrives, where the rule of\r\nlaw prevails and where human rights are respected.\r\nTaiwan has also remained able and willing to make\r\nsignificant contributions to the collaborative efforts to\r\nsecure global peace, security and prosperity.\r\nWe also believe that, whatever the views are on\r\nthe question of whether Taiwan is a domestic issue or\r\nnot, there can be no justification for supporting\r\nthreatening initiatives, such as the so called anti-\r\nsecession law, which could have such far-reaching\r\neffects on regional and global stability.\r\nI am confident that, under your leadership, Sir,\r\nwe will work with unity of purpose and perhaps with\r\nless posturing to address the challenges before us.\r\n3\r\nA/60/PV.15\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Kiribati for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Anote Tong, President of the Republic of\r\nKiribati, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nItem 9 of the provisional agenda (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Carlos Gomes, Jr., Prime\r\nMinister of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Prime Minister of the Republic of\r\nGuinea-Bissau.\r\nMr. Carlos Gomes, Jr., Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Guinea-Bissau, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Carlos Gomes, Jr.,\r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, and\r\ninviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Gomes (Guinea-Bissau) (spoke in\r\nPortuguese; interpretation from the French text\r\nfurnished by the delegation): Allow me at the outset to\r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election to preside over\r\nthe General Assembly at its sixtieth session. Given\r\nyour role at this critical moment, Guinea-Bissau, in its\r\ncapacity as a Vice-President at this session, will spare\r\nno effort in supporting you in your work.\r\nI also extend my warmest congratulations to your\r\npredecessor, Mr. Jean Ping, Minister of State and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the sisterly Republic of\r\nGabon, on the commitment and skill he demonstrated\r\nduring his presidency of the General Assembly at its\r\nfifty-ninth session.\r\nI also congratulate the Secretary-General, Mr.\r\nKofi Annan, on his excellent work at the head of our\r\nOrganization to strengthen its credibility, promote\r\nessential international solidarity, and achieve consensus\r\non major issues relating to security, counter-terrorism,\r\ndevelopment and human rights.\r\nThe world awaits the dawn of a new order, which\r\nwill require a more realistic and democratic international\r\npolitical framework, global commitment, and the\r\ncollective will of all Member States to meet the\r\nchallenges facing humankind in the context of\r\nincreasing interdependence. We endorse the\r\nconclusions and recommendations contained in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report, and I reiterate my country’s\r\nreadiness to contribute to all global agreements that\r\nwill allow us to meet the current challenges of\r\ndevelopment, security, the fight against international\r\nterrorism, respect for human rights, and institutional\r\nreform of the United Nations, in particular that of the\r\nSecurity Council, where Africa should enjoy the\r\nlegitimate right to hold two permanent seats.\r\nTo carry out these reforms, it is important that\r\nthere be political will, based on the collective action of\r\nStates, which is the foundation of this international\r\nsystem. I cannot overemphasize the fact that\r\ncooperation which could lead to this collective action\r\nwill be possible only if the policies of our countries\r\ntake account of the needs of our own citizens, as well\r\nas the needs of others, because we are part of the same\r\nhuman family, forced to live together on this same\r\nplanet, and we have an obligation to share it and\r\nprotect it.\r\nIn this regard, I would express my concern vis-à-\r\nvis the phenomenon of globalization. We are aware of\r\nthe enormous potential and advantages of a well-\r\nmanaged globalization and all that it has to offer in the\r\neconomic, financial, commercial, technological and\r\ncommunication fields. However, it is equally\r\nimportant, at this stage of globalization, to recognize\r\nthat it has not been sufficiently inclusive. Exclusion\r\nand marginalization in international relations are the\r\nnegative effects of globalization. These are factors that\r\ncontribute to the existence and proliferation of conflicts\r\n— situations which require properly-coordinated, global\r\nresponses, as well as multilateral frameworks for\r\ndialogue, agreement and effective interaction.\r\nInter-State conflict, civil wars, organized crime,\r\nterrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction and the illicit trafficking in small arms and\r\nlight weapons are phenomena which threaten\r\ninternational security. But such threats are not limited\r\nsolely to these spheres. They also involve poverty,\r\npandemics and natural disasters affecting the planet.\r\nThe growing link between security and\r\ndevelopment is proof that the gesture of solidarity\r\ndesired with regard to financing for development of the\r\npoor is needed more than ever. This responsible and\r\n4\r\nA/60/PV.15\r\npositive attitude is one of the main pillars in our efforts\r\nto pursue the Millennium Development Goals, a\r\nchallenge which mankind cannot fail to meet. I hope\r\nthat there will be sufficient political will so that the\r\nnew partnership for development which we wish to see\r\nestablished among States in the very near future will\r\ndispel any doubts and fulfil the hopes raised during the\r\ninternationally-organized conferences within the\r\nframework of the United Nations in the economic,\r\nfinancial and social and related spheres.\r\nThe outcome document we have just adopted at\r\nthe conclusion of the recent High-level Plenary\r\nMeeting is still insufficient, but it is forward-looking.\r\nWe must underscore the fact that discussions,\r\nagreements and negotiations need to be pursued in a\r\ntransparent fashion in order to achieve desired results\r\nby all Member States.\r\nAfrica has rightfully been the recent subject of\r\nincreased attention on the part of the international\r\ncommunity. I am pleased to express our satisfaction at\r\nthe decision recently adopted at the Summit of the G-8\r\nregarding debt cancellation for some African countries,\r\nand the possibility of extending this measure to other\r\npoor countries, including my country, Guinea-Bissau.\r\nOn 1 October, Guinea-Bissau will continue and\r\nconclude the process of complete return to\r\nconstitutional normalcy through presidential elections.\r\nThe success of this political transitional period that\r\nbegan in September 2003 is the fruitful result of\r\nbalanced relations among institutions of the Republic,\r\nbased on the separation of powers and characterized by\r\ngood governance.\r\nWe must recognize that this has not always been\r\neasy, and quite often we have faced situations which go\r\nbeyond our national capacity to resolve. The\r\nframework for constant cooperation and agreement\r\nwith the international community has been an\r\nimportant instrument in following up the socio-\r\neconomic situation and the political internal process.\r\nWe wish to express our thanks to the Member States of\r\nthe Economic Community of West African States, the\r\nEuropean Union, the international community and\r\nPortuguese-speaking countries for contributing to the\r\npolitical transitional process in our country. Without\r\nthis support for Guinea-Bissau it would have been\r\ndifficult for us to face the numerous constraints during\r\nthe transitional phase.\r\nThe role played by the United Nations system —\r\nthe Economic and Social Council’s ad hoc group and\r\nthe Group of Friends of Guinea-Bissau in particular —\r\ndeserves special mention and our most heartfelt thanks.\r\nThe support of the international community has\r\nbeen very important in the success of the transitional\r\nperiod in Guinea-Bissau. However, more decisive\r\naction is required to meet the challenges of\r\nreconstruction and the rebuilding of the infrastructure\r\nin my country, to improve the economy and create\r\nminimal conditions for governability and to strengthen\r\nthe foundation of a democratic State, which we wish to\r\nsee in Guinea-Bissau. These factors are essential for\r\npeace and for political and social stability.\r\nOnce again, I would call from this rostrum for the\r\nsupport of the international community in the\r\nNovember Donor Round-Table Conference with\r\npartners in peace for development in order to adopt\r\ntogether a document on the national strategy to reduce\r\npoverty. This goal is in line with the concerns of the\r\nUnited Nations aimed at more effective assistance to\r\ncountries in post-conflict situations, contained in the\r\nproposal to create a Peacebuilding Commission, which\r\nwe fully support.\r\nWe recognize respect for the rules of democracy,\r\nfor human rights and good economic and financial\r\ngovernance. We feel that they are the foundation for\r\nthe rule of law. We reaffirm the commitment of my\r\nGovernment, in strict compliance with our constitution,\r\nto work in close cooperation with all institutions of the\r\nRepublic to create conditions aimed at promoting\r\nnational reconciliation, peace and domestic political\r\nstability, to consolidate our relations of friendship,\r\nbrotherhood and solidarity with our neighbours and to\r\nrestore a climate of trust, credibility and effective,\r\nlasting partnership with the entire international\r\ncommunity for socio-economic development in our\r\ncountry.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Guinea-Bissau for the statement he has\r\njust made.\r\nMr. Carlos Gomes, Jr., Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Guinea-Bissau, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Somsavat Lengsavad, Deputy Prime Minister and\r\n5\r\nA/60/PV.15\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Lao People’s\r\nDemocratic Republic.\r\nMr. Lengsavad (Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic) (spoke in Laotian; English text provided by the\r\ndelegation): At the outset I would like to congratulate\r\nyou upon your unanimous election as President of the\r\nsixtieth session of the General Assembly. I am confident\r\nthat with your experience and diplomatic skills you will\r\nguide our deliberations to a successful outcome. I\r\nwould also like to convey our great appreciation to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Jean Ping, President of the fifty-ninth\r\nsession of the Assembly, for the efficient manner in\r\nwhich he presided over our work as well as for the fine\r\naccomplishments recorded during the session.\r\nSixty years after its creation, the United Nations,\r\nour only multilateral Organization, is at a crossroads.\r\nWhen the Organization was established, the promotion\r\nof peace and security, as well as that of economic and\r\nsocial development, were its main objectives. It was\r\nthen conceived to save succeeding generations from\r\nthe scourge of war and insecurity, to reduce and\r\neradicate poverty and to move towards economic\r\nprosperity for all.\r\nToday, the world is still filled with conflicts,\r\nviolence, insecurity, hunger, poverty and despair. We\r\nhave therefore every reason to act collectively to\r\nreform and strengthen this multilateral institution to\r\nenable it to effectively address the many complex\r\nchallenges the world is now facing.\r\nIn this reform process, revitalizing the General\r\nAssembly has now become one of the crucial issues for\r\nconsideration by Member States. In our opinion, the\r\nAssembly, which comprises all the Members of the\r\nUnited Nations, should continue to play a central role\r\nas the chief deliberative, policy-making and\r\nrepresentative organ. It should serve as a forum for\r\nhigh-level policy statements, as well as for the\r\nconsideration, of, inter alia, agenda items of special\r\npolitical importance or urgency. In order to strengthen\r\nthe role and authority of the General Assembly,\r\nMember States should stress the need to fully respect\r\nand restore the balance between the principal organs of\r\nthe United Nations, within their respective purviews\r\nand mandates, in accordance with the Charter.\r\nAt the Millennium Summit in 2000, the leaders of\r\nthe States Members of the United Nations resolved to\r\nstrive for the elimination of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, particularly nuclear weapons. In this\r\nregard, we regret that the seventh Review Conference\r\nof the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT), held in New York from 2 to\r\n27 May 2005, was unable to reach consensus on the\r\nsubstantive questions relating to the three pillars of the\r\nTreaty. The Lao People’s Democratic Republic is of the\r\nview that all States parties should remain committed to\r\nthe NPT and believes that it should continue to have\r\ncornerstone status in the context of global disarmament\r\nand the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\r\nThe world economy continues to be characterized\r\nby slow and uneven growth and instability.\r\nGlobalization may offer a great many opportunities to a\r\nnumber of countries. However, it also presents\r\nnumerous challenges and risks for the developing\r\nworld, particularly the most vulnerable groups, namely,\r\nthe least developed countries and the landlocked\r\ndeveloping countries. In reality, the process of\r\nglobalization among and within countries has not\r\nproduced equal benefits. The gap between the\r\ndeveloped and developing world is widening, and we\r\nare all greatly concerned about increased poverty in\r\nmany developing countries.\r\nIn order for developing countries to reap the\r\nbenefits of globalization, an enabling external\r\neconomic environment for development is required. To\r\nthat end, we should all strive to achieve greater\r\ncoherence among the international trading, monetary\r\nand financial systems.\r\nAmong the most vulnerable groups, the\r\nlandlocked developing countries deserve special\r\nattention. The Almaty Programme of Action, which\r\nwas adopted in 2003, was a landmark document that\r\nset out five priority areas. The São Paulo Consensus,\r\nwhich was adopted in 2004 by the eleventh United\r\nNations Conference on Trade and Development,\r\nrecognized, among other things, that the landlocked\r\ndeveloping countries were small and vulnerable\r\neconomies. Those documents, together with the\r\nrelevant General Assembly resolutions, constitute a\r\nsignificant achievement on which the Group of\r\nLandlocked Developing Countries is building in order\r\nto move forward in promoting its legitimate cause. In\r\nmy capacity as Chairman of that Group, I appeal to the\r\ninternational community for sympathy and support for\r\nour endeavours.\r\nIn order to strengthen unity and solidarity among\r\nthe countries of the South, and as a follow-up to the\r\n6\r\nA/60/PV.15\r\nimplementation of the Havana Programme of Action,\r\nadopted by the first South Summit in 2000, the second\r\nSouth Summit of the Group of 77 and China was held\r\nin Doha, Qatar, from 12 to 16 June 2005. The Doha\r\nDeclaration and Plan of Action, which were adopted at\r\nthe second South Summit, called for a more energetic\r\neffort to deepen and revitalize South-South\r\ncooperation, with a view to enhancing sustained\r\neconomic growth and the sustainable development of\r\nthe countries of the South.\r\nLast April in Jakarta, Indonesia, the Asian-African\r\nSummit was held with the objective of reinvigorating the\r\nspirit of the 1955 Bandung Conference and of charting\r\nfuture cooperation between the two continents towards\r\na new Asian-African strategic partnership. That\r\npartnership, which was inaugurated at the Summit,\r\nconstitutes an important building block for the further\r\nstrengthening of South-South cooperation.\r\nI would like commend Mr. Kofi Annan, the\r\nSecretary-General, for his tireless efforts to ensure the\r\nsuccess of the High-level Plenary Meeting of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. The Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic highly values the outcome document adopted\r\nby our heads of State or Government, in which they\r\nreaffirmed the Millennium Declaration and their\r\ncommitment to implementing effectively and fully the\r\nBrussels Programme of Action for the Least Developed\r\nCountries and the Almaty Programme of Action:\r\nAddressing the Special Needs of Landlocked\r\nDeveloping Countries within a New Global Framework\r\nfor Transit Transport Cooperation for Landlocked and\r\nTransit Developing Countries.\r\nGiven the aspirations of the overwhelming\r\nmajority of Member States, the second South Summit,\r\nheld in Doha, called upon the Government of the\r\nUnited States to put an end to the economic,\r\ncommercial and financial embargo against Cuba,\r\nwhich, in addition to being unilateral and contrary to\r\nthe Charter, international law and the principle of good\r\nneighbourliness, is the cause of enormous material loss\r\nand economic damage to the people of Cuba.\r\nOn the Korean Peninsula, we welcome the recent\r\nresumption of the six-party talks, which have yielded\r\nimportant progress. The Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic expresses the hope that the concerned parties\r\nwill further deploy joint efforts and undertake concrete\r\nactions based on the principles and commitments\r\ncontained in the Joint Declaration of 19 September\r\n2005 on the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free\r\nKorean Peninsula, thus contributing to the promotion\r\nof peace, security, stability and development\r\ncooperation in the wider Asia-Pacific region.\r\nIn the Middle East, although the situation remains\r\ndifficult and complex, a degree of progress has been\r\nmade that ought to be further promoted. In order to\r\nachieve a comprehensive and lasting peace in the\r\nregion, the question of Palestine in all its aspects\r\nshould be resolved in accordance with international law\r\nand relevant United Nations resolutions. In this regard,\r\nthe Lao People’s Democratic Republic reaffirms its\r\nunwavering support for the legitimate struggle of the\r\nPalestinian people, under the leadership of the\r\nPalestine Liberation Organization, to exercise their\r\nright to self-determination, including their right to\r\nestablish an independent State of Palestine living side\r\nby side with Israel.\r\nThe situation in Iraq continues to be a matter of\r\nconcern to the international community. It is our\r\nsincere hope that durable peace, security and stability\r\ncan soon be secured in that country, paving the way for\r\nthe Iraqi people to be truly the masters of their own\r\nfuture and destiny.\r\nThe year 2005 marks the thirtieth anniversary of\r\nthe proclamation of the Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic, a historic event of great significance in the\r\npolitical life of the nation. In general, the national\r\neconomy is continuing to grow at a sustained pace. The\r\nrate of growth reached 7.2 per cent in the period 2004-\r\n2005. Foreign investment is on the increase, political\r\nstability, social tranquillity and security are assured\r\nand the living conditions of the people are continuing\r\nto improve. The multi-ethnic Lao people, while\r\nenjoying fundamental rights, including the right to\r\nbelieve or not to believe in any religion, stand firmly\r\nunited in nation-building. Furthermore, the Lao People’s\r\nDemocratic Republic remains committed to implementing\r\na policy aimed at establishing a State based on the rule\r\nof law so as to ensure freedom, democracy and the\r\nlegitimate interests of its citizens, as well as of foreign\r\nresidents and other foreigners living and working in the\r\nLao People’s Democratic Republic.\r\nExternally, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic\r\nhas vigorously participated in multifaceted regional\r\nand international activities aimed at fostering peace,\r\nstability, friendship and the promotion of development\r\ncooperation. One of the greatest events for the Lao\r\n7\r\nA/60/PV.15\r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic was the historic hosting\r\nof the tenth Summit of the Association of Southeast\r\nAsian Nations (ASEAN) in November 2004, which\r\nwas followed by the successful holding, from 24 to 29\r\nJuly 2005, of the thirty-eighth ASEAN Ministerial\r\nMeeting, the post-ministerial conferences and the\r\ntwelfth ASEAN Regional Forum. Those events reflect\r\nthe great sense of responsibility of the multi-ethnic Lao\r\npeople as a whole in the discharge of the country’s\r\nchairmanship of ASEAN during the past 12 months.\r\nFurthermore, those accomplishments have\r\nsignificantly contributed to narrowing the development\r\ngaps within ASEAN member countries and fostering\r\nthe realization of an ASEAN community. That\r\ncommunity has three pillars: the ASEAN Security\r\nCommunity, the ASEAN Economic Community and\r\nthe ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community, all of which\r\nare closely intertwined and mutually reinforcing for the\r\npurpose of ensuring durable peace, stability and shared\r\nprosperity in the region.\r\nMr. Gillerman (Israel), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nASEAN hopes that friendly countries and the\r\nUnited Nations will become more involved in the\r\nimplementation of the Vientiane Action Programme and\r\nthe ASEAN Development Fund for regional economic\r\nintegration, particularly in the areas of human resource\r\ndevelopment, infrastructure, information technology\r\nand energy development.\r\nPeace cannot be achieved without development,\r\nand development in turn cannot be realized without\r\ncooperation among nations, with the United Nations\r\nplaying an important catalytic role.\r\nThe United Nations — the sole multilateral,\r\nuniversal Organization — cannot be strengthened,\r\nhowever, if it does not embrace, in equal measure, the\r\nconcerns of all, including the small, vulnerable, and\r\nweak States, which make up the majority of its\r\nMembers. In that respect, we should all remind\r\nourselves that not only will our words and the\r\nprinciples we espouse be judged by future generations,\r\nbut so, too, will the actions that we undertake to bring\r\nabout development for the whole of humanity.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His\r\nExcellency Mr. Silvan Shalom, Deputy Prime Minister\r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs of Israel.\r\nMr. Shalom (Israel): It is my unique pleasure to\r\npraise His Excellency Ambassador Dan Gillerman, my\r\nemissary to the United Nations, who is in the Chair at\r\npresent, upon his election to the post of Vice-President\r\nat this session of the General Assembly, and to wish\r\nhim much success.\r\nThese are optimistic times in the Middle East.\r\nThe iron wall that has defined Israel’s relations with\r\nmost of the Arab and Muslim world for generations, is\r\ncoming down. Israel’s contacts with Arab and Muslim\r\nStates are growing at a rate never seen before.\r\nCountries like Pakistan and others that in the past\r\nrefused to acknowledge our shared humanity, today\r\nextend their hands in friendship and recognition.\r\nRelations with key Muslim States, such as Turkey, are\r\nflourishing, while our peaceful ties with both Egypt\r\nand Jordan are constantly improving.\r\nHere in New York this week, I have had the\r\nhonour of meeting with more than 10 of my colleagues\r\nfrom the Arab and Muslim world — a number\r\nunthinkable just two years ago. Those meetings have\r\nbeen friendly, as is only fitting for countries that are\r\nnot in conflict — either territorially, or economically.\r\nIsrael welcomes this new readiness for contact, and we\r\nencourage our neighbours to build on the foundations\r\nthat we are now laying. Contacts between Israel and its\r\nArab and Muslim neighbours are good for the region,\r\nand good for peace.\r\nWe all share a common interest in building a\r\nregion of tolerance and cooperation — a region where\r\nthe moderates have the initiative, not the extremists,\r\nwhose violence has set the agenda for so long. Indeed,\r\nthose who genuinely wish to help the Palestinians and\r\nto bring them the benefits of peace and prosperity must\r\nrealize that building contacts and cooperation with\r\nIsrael is a crucial element in that process.\r\nPossibilities for cooperation abound. In fields as\r\ndiverse as agriculture, health, the environment,\r\ntransportation and electricity, the potential benefits of\r\nMiddle East regional cooperation are immense. Such\r\ncooperation can bring tangible and immediate\r\neconomic benefits, as Israel’s improving relations with\r\nJordan and Egypt have shown.\r\nUnfortunately, many of our ties with the Arab and\r\nMuslim world are still deep in the shadows, hidden\r\nfrom the public eye. Today, I call on my Arab and\r\nMuslim colleagues to bring our contacts out into the\r\nlight of day, so that our peoples may understand our\r\n8\r\nA/60/PV.15\r\nshared desire to work with each other to bring peace\r\nand prosperity to our region. I call on the leaders of the\r\nArab and Muslim world, to join us in speaking to our\r\npopulations of peace rather than conflict, of reasons to\r\ncooperate, rather than reasons to boycott.\r\nIn November of this year, I will sit alongside my\r\nArab and Muslim colleagues at two international\r\ngatherings: the World Summit on the Information\r\nSociety, in Tunisia; and the summit of the Euro-\r\nMediterranean Partnership, in Barcelona. I call upon\r\nthe international community and my Arab and Muslim\r\ncounterparts to work together with us to ensure that\r\nthose meetings result in concrete projects that will help\r\nreinforce our peace efforts on the ground.\r\nThis is also the time for the international\r\ncommunity to renew its investment in the future of the\r\nMiddle East by reviving the multilateral track of the\r\nMiddle East peace talks.\r\nJust one week ago, Israel completed the\r\nevacuation of all Israeli communities in the Gaza Strip.\r\nEntire families — many of whom had lived and tilled\r\nthose lands for three generations — were called upon\r\nby their Government to leave and to begin their lives\r\nanew. Today, there are no more Israelis in Gaza. Israeli\r\nmilitary rule is now over. Responsibility for the affairs\r\nof Gaza and its residents is now in Palestinian hands.\r\nIsrael’s actions have opened the door to a new future,\r\nand we invite our neighbours to walk with us together\r\nthrough that door.\r\nWe are committed to the road map, and we wish\r\nto get back to its full implementation. To do that, we\r\nneed a partner. A partner who is committed, as we are,\r\nto the peaceful resolution of our differences, and to the\r\ndemocratic and universal principles on which peace is\r\nfounded.\r\nIsrael attaches great importance to the Palestinian\r\nassumption of responsibility. In it lies the key to\r\nprogress towards peace. The transfer of responsibility\r\nfor Gaza provides the Palestinian side with the chance\r\nto take their fate into their own hands; an opportunity\r\nnot just to say that they want to govern, but to show\r\nthat they are ready and able to do so. Gaza, we hope, will\r\nserve as a model for how the Palestinian Authority can\r\nbuild a functioning, democratic and peaceful society.\r\nRecognizing the significance of this moment,\r\nIsrael is taking great pains to ensure that Palestinian\r\nleader Mahmoud Abbas is given every opportunity to\r\nestablish his authority. We want to promote conditions\r\nthat will benefit ordinary Palestinians, without posing a\r\nsecurity threat to Israel.\r\nIsrael has expressed its strong support for\r\ninternational aid and assistance for the social and\r\neconomic development of Gaza, and we are committed\r\nto facilitating those efforts. Constructive international\r\nengagement is crucial to the Palestinian Authority’s\r\nsuccess. The international community’s priority now\r\nmust be ensuring that the Palestinian Authority and its\r\ninstitutions can deliver the services and outcomes their\r\npeople and ours expect and deserve.\r\nEconomic reconstruction, of course, is not\r\nenough. The Palestinian Authority must also deliver on\r\nits commitment to end the campaign of terror against\r\nIsrael. For Israel, security is an issue on which we will\r\nnever compromise. We insist on the end of terror and\r\nthe dismantlement of its infrastructure, for the safety of\r\nour citizens, and so that our peace efforts can succeed.\r\nTurning Gaza into a model of success requires\r\nthat the Palestinian Authority act to promote and\r\nprotect democracy from its enemies. Here, as with\r\nsecurity, there is no room for discounts. Simply\r\nholding elections is no guarantee of moderation and\r\nresponsible government.\r\nTwo days ago in Gaza, the terrorist organization\r\nHamas held a rally of 10,000 armed men dedicated to a\r\nholy war against Israel. Like Al-Qaida and the other\r\norganizations in the global network of terror, Hamas\r\nseeks to destroy everything that the international\r\ncommunity and the moderates in our region seek to\r\nbuild: tolerance, democracy and peace. Hamas is\r\nresponsible for the deliberate murder of hundreds of\r\nIsraeli civilians, amongst them scores of women and\r\nchildren. Israel cannot and will not grant legitimacy to\r\nsuch an organization. We will not cooperate with its\r\ndesire to participate in the forthcoming Palestinian\r\nelections. And we call on the international community\r\nto make clear its own opposition to the inclusion of\r\nsuch terrorists in the democratic process. If Gaza is\r\nindeed to be the positive model we all wish to see, then\r\nit is those who promote dialogue, not violence, who\r\nmust be empowered.\r\nThe central threat to global security and to\r\nrenewed momentum towards dialogue and peace in the\r\nMiddle East today is Iran and its nuclear ambitions. As\r\nthe speech before this Assembly by the newly elected\r\npresident of Iran so clearly demonstrated, Iran’s fanatic\r\n9\r\nA/60/PV.15\r\nregime remains determined to proceed with its nuclear\r\nweapons programme. Israel welcomes the efforts of the\r\ninternational community — in particular France, Britain\r\nand Germany, backed by the United States — to deny Iran\r\nthe ability to terrorize the world with nuclear weapons.\r\nThe Board of Governors of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency is meeting at this very moment\r\nin Vienna to discuss this urgent matter. I call on them\r\nto stop this evil regime from acquiring nuclear\r\nweapons. The security and stability of the entire globe\r\nis at stake. This is why it is essential and urgent that\r\nthe Security Council take action. The international\r\ncommunity must rally as one and use all the means at\r\nits disposal to stop Iran before it goes nuclear. We must\r\nnot allow the fate of mankind to rest in the hands of the\r\ntyrants of Tehran.\r\nIn January of this year, this Assembly convened\r\nin special session to commemorate the Holocaust and\r\npay tribute to the brave soldiers and nations who freed\r\nEuropean Jewry and the world from the calamity of\r\nthat darkest nightmare. Israel commends the\r\ncommunity of nations for standing up in unison on this\r\nanniversary in commitment to the cry “never again”.\r\nWe commend the Secretary-General’s and this\r\nAssembly’s recognition that Holocaust remembrance\r\nmust be a universal commitment. Ultimately, it is only\r\nthe determined defence of the universal values of\r\ntolerance and the sanctity of each human life that will\r\nprotect us from tyranny and extremism.\r\nIn this spirit, Israel calls on the General\r\nAssembly to adopt a resolution initiated by Israel and\r\nother like-minded countries commemorating the\r\nHolocaust and calling for global educational efforts to\r\nensure that its lessons are learnt. Especially today, the\r\nday the world’s greatest Nazi-hunter, Simon\r\nWiesenthal, has passed away, we are reminded that the\r\nHolocaust is passing from human memory to history.\r\nAs the generation of survivors leaves us, who will tell\r\ntheir story, if not us?\r\nThe special session to commemorate the\r\nHolocaust is only one example, of the welcome shift in\r\nthe attitude of this institution towards Israel. Our recent\r\nelection as Vice-President of this Assembly is another.\r\nI wish to commend the Secretary-General for his\r\nunique contribution to this positive trend. Israel’s\r\nrelations with the United Nations are better today than\r\nthey have ever been. Nevertheless, they are still far\r\nfrom what they should be.\r\nI call on all the States gathered here to examine\r\nhow they too can contribute to promoting a more\r\nbalanced and constructive United Nations approach to\r\nIsrael. The United Nations cannot be true to its own\r\nlofty and universal principles, if it continues to waste\r\nscarce resources and serve as a forum of hostility and\r\nprejudice against one of its own.\r\nThe United Nations was born of the noble vision\r\nto bring the ideals of peace, security and human rights\r\nto all peoples. Sadly, reality of the United Nations\r\nremains far removed from the United Nations ideal.\r\nMajor reform is urgent and crucial. Israel joins our\r\nfellow Member States and their peoples in the desire to\r\nsee the United Nations fulfil the vision of its founders;\r\nto see the United Nations serving as a force for good in\r\nmeeting the many challenges of our age.\r\nIsrael seeks to take its rightful place as a country\r\nwith full and equal rights in this institution. We seek to\r\nrealize our full potential to contribute to the global\r\nagenda. This is why I have decided to present for the\r\nfirst time Israel’s candidacy for membership on the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nIt was the wisest leader of ancient Israel, King\r\nSolomon, who wrote, in the book of Ecclesiastes, “For\r\neverything there is a season: a time to weep and a time\r\nto laugh; … a time to love and a time to hate; a time\r\nfor war and a time for peace.” This is a time for peace.\r\nA time for the leaders of the world to work together to\r\nbring the blessings of opportunity, peace and prosperity\r\nto all humanity.\r\nAs the Jewish New Year dawns upon us, I extend\r\non behalf of the Jewish people greetings of peace and\r\nbrotherhood to our Muslim and Arab neighbours and to\r\nall nations.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Sheikh Mohammad Al-Sabah Al-Salem Al-\r\nSabah, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the State of\r\nKuwait.\r\nSheikh Mohammad Al-Sabah Al-Salem Al-\r\nSabah (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): A few days ago,\r\nthis Hall was the venue of an unprecedented landmark,\r\na historic gathering of a large number of heads of State\r\nor Government who converged to review and assess\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals,\r\nto renew their commitment to the United Nations and\r\nthe principles of its Charter and to underline their faith\r\n10\r\nA/60/PV.15\r\nand conviction in the valuable contribution of the\r\ninternational Organization which, by promoting the\r\nprinciples of peace, security and prosperity, is building\r\na better world — a world free of the problems and\r\nchallenges currently afflicting the international\r\ncommunity and forming a threat to world peace and\r\nsecurity. Those problems and challenges include\r\nterrorism, poverty, hunger, the proliferation of weapons\r\nof mass destruction, the spread of contagious diseases,\r\nenvironmental degradation and the persistent and\r\nflagrant violation of human rights. The international\r\ngathering was an acknowledgement that multilateralism\r\nis the only viable option for addressing those issues\r\nand challenges, whose implications and dangers\r\ntranscend geographical borders. Therefore, because of\r\ntheir nature, no country can confront them alone.\r\nAlthough Kuwait welcomes the adoption of the\r\noutcome document (resolution 60/1) of the High-level\r\nPlenary Meeting, we express our disappointment that it\r\ndid not include the issues of disarmament and non-\r\nproliferation. We hope that the international community\r\nwill reach a consensus regarding the importance of full\r\nand non-selective implementation of all disarmament\r\ntreaties, particularly the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation\r\nof Nuclear Weapons, whose three main pillars are nuclear\r\ndisarmament, non-proliferation and the peaceful uses of\r\nnuclear energy. The international community must\r\nredouble its efforts to totally eliminate all weapons of\r\nmass destruction. We hope that the commitments and\r\nobligations agreed upon will be duly implemented.\r\nKuwait, for its part, will fulfil its obligations and\r\ncomply with all relevant international conventions,\r\ntreaties and United Nations resolutions. We hope that\r\nthe next few years will see significant strides in the\r\nefforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals\r\nby 2015 and that our joint efforts will result in the\r\nstreamlining of international cooperation and\r\ncoordination mechanisms.\r\nIn that context, Kuwait wishes to commend the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his efforts and\r\ninitiatives to reform the Secretariat with a view to\r\nenhancing its accountability and transparency and\r\nimproving the performance of United Nations staff in\r\norder to meet the demands of the constantly changing\r\ninternational environment. Kuwait is actively\r\nparticipating in the ongoing consultations on the reform\r\nof United Nations organs such as the General Assembly,\r\nthe Economic and Social Council and the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nWe hope that a consensus will eventually be\r\nreached on Security Council reform that will achieve\r\nour common goal: improving the Council’s role and\r\neffectiveness, so that it can fulfil its Charter mandate,\r\nwhich is the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity. Council reform should also ensure broader\r\nrepresentation of regional groups, including in\r\nparticular Arab and Islamic representation, which\r\nwould make Council resolutions more transparent and\r\neffective.\r\nThe phenomenon of terrorism has become a\r\ndirect and immediate threat to international peace and\r\nsecurity. Its dangers have spread to affect many\r\ncountries throughout the world. The 11 September\r\n2001 attacks in the United States of America, the\r\nevents currently unfolding in Iraq and the recent\r\nbombings in London and Sharm el-Sheikh have\r\nprovided indisputable proof that terrorism neither is\r\nassociated with, nor specifically targets, a particular\r\nrace, religion or culture. Therefore, the responsibility\r\nfor combating terrorism is collective and must be\r\nshouldered by all Member States without exception.\r\nWhile the State of Kuwait reaffirms its principled\r\nposition rejecting terrorism in all its forms and\r\nmanifestations, we wish to emphasize the need to\r\ncombat terrorism within a framework of international\r\nlegitimacy that recognizes the legitimate rights of\r\npeoples and brings about justice and stability. We also\r\nstress the importance of commitment and adherence by\r\nMember States to the 12 international conventions on\r\nterrorism, as well as to the International Convention\r\nfor the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism,\r\nwhich Kuwait signed last Friday. We believe that that\r\nis the ideal way to eliminate this phenomenon, to curb\r\nits effects and to tackle its root causes.\r\nIn that regard, the State of Kuwait reaffirms its\r\nsupport for the proposal put forward by the Custodian\r\nof the Two Holy Mosques, King Abdullah Bin\r\nAbdulaziz Al-Saud of the fraternal Kingdom of Saudi\r\nArabia, to establish an international centre to fight\r\nterrorism. We believe that such a centre would put in\r\nplace an effective mechanism for collecting and\r\nexchanging information on this phenomenon.\r\nIraq continues to find itself in a critically difficult\r\nsituation of instability and insecurity because of the\r\nalmost daily terrorist attacks mounted by terrorist\r\ngroups, including the vanquished fleeing remnants\r\nloyal to the former Iraqi regime. Those terrorist attacks\r\n11\r\nA/60/PV.15\r\nlargely impede the efforts of the Iraqi Government to\r\nrebuild in the wake of the devastation left by the\r\nformer regime as a result of its hostile policies towards\r\nits own people and neighbouring countries.\r\nThe State of Kuwait continues to lend support to\r\nour brothers in Iraq with a view to rehabilitating and\r\nrebuilding their country. Our approach stems from our\r\nbelief that stability in Iraq is ultimately in the interest\r\nof stability in this vital region of the world and would\r\nhave positive implications for its security and progress.\r\nWe are fully confident that the fraternal people of Iraq\r\nwill eventually overcome this difficult period in their\r\nhistory and that they will persist in building democratic\r\ninstitutions, in adopting the text of their new\r\nconstitution and in laying the ground for the\r\nforthcoming legislative elections.\r\nIn the same vein, we wish to stress Kuwait’s\r\ncommitment to the unity, sovereignty and political\r\nindependence of Iraq. The State of Kuwait looks\r\nforward to establishing solid fraternal relations with\r\nthe new Iraq on the basis of mutual respect, good-\r\nneighbourliness and adherence to bilateral agreements,\r\nto the relevant United Nations resolutions and to the\r\nresolutions of international legitimacy, as they\r\nconstitute the fundamental pillars of the new and future\r\nrelationship between the two brotherly countries.\r\nFurthermore, we welcome the Iraqi Government’s\r\ndetermination to try the leaders of the former regime\r\nfor all the crimes against humanity that they have\r\ncommitted against the people of Iraq. The trials should\r\nalso cover the crimes committed against the Kuwaiti\r\npeople, including the invasion of the State of Kuwait\r\nand the killing of Kuwaiti prisoners and third-country\r\nnationals.\r\nKuwait reaffirms its full support for the struggle\r\nof the Palestinian people to attain all their legitimate\r\npolitical rights. Kuwait demands that Israel move\r\nforward in fulfilling all its commitments and\r\nobligations under the relevant United Nations\r\nresolutions, primarily Security Council resolutions 242\r\n(1967), 338 (1973) and 1515 (2003), in accordance\r\nwith the principle of land for peace and the provisions\r\nof the Arab peace initiative, the bilateral accords it\r\nsigned with the Palestinian Authority within the\r\nframework of the peace process, and the road map,\r\nwith all its provisions and obligations. Israel must also\r\nend its policy of oppressing the Palestinian people,\r\ndismantle the separation wall and release all\r\nPalestinian detainees.\r\nThe State of Kuwait views the Israeli withdrawal\r\nfrom the Gaza Strip as a first step to be followed by\r\nadditional measures to be taken by Israel to end the\r\noccupation, in compliance with the relevant United\r\nNations resolutions and in preparation for the\r\nestablishment of an independent Palestinian State on\r\nPalestinian national soil, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its\r\ncapital. Kuwait hopes that the Israeli withdrawal will\r\nlead to the resumption of peace efforts in the region to\r\nensure full Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Syrian\r\nArab Golan to the borderline of 4 June 1967 and its\r\nwithdrawal from the rest of the Arab territory in\r\nsouthern Lebanon. Thereafter, a settlement should be\r\nreached through negotiations among all parties\r\nconcerned to establish a just, comprehensive and\r\nlasting peace in the region — a peace that would be\r\nenhanced by making the Middle East region, including\r\nthe Gulf region, a zone free of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction.\r\nIn view of Kuwait’s keen interest in the\r\nmaintenance of security and stability in the Gulf region\r\nand given our close ties with the brotherly United Arab\r\nEmirates and with the friendly Islamic Republic of\r\nIran, we support the position of the member States of\r\nthe Gulf Cooperation Council regarding the three\r\nislands of the United Arab Emirates. It is our hope that\r\nthe two countries will agree on a negotiation\r\nmechanism to resolve their dispute over the three\r\nislands, in accordance with the principles and norms of\r\ninternational law and good neighbourly relations.\r\nIt is our sincere hope that the resolutions on the\r\npromotion of sustainable development adopted at\r\nnumerous international meetings and conferences\r\nconvened by the United Nations and other\r\norganizations, as well as those goals in the High-level\r\nPlenary Meeting’s outcome document, will lay the\r\ngroundwork for a new partnership between the\r\ndeveloped and the developing nations, thus\r\ncontributing to the stability and the growth of\r\neconomic relations among those States. We also hope\r\nthat those resolutions will help create a balanced and\r\nfair international trading system in which each party\r\nassumes its responsibilities.\r\nTo create that kind of partnership, the economic\r\nstructures of the developing countries need to be\r\nstrengthened and the developed countries should fulfil\r\n12\r\nA/60/PV.15\r\ntheir pledges to provide financial and technical\r\nassistance and alleviate and cancel the debts of the\r\npoorest countries. They should also remove trade\r\nrestrictions and tariffs on products made in poor\r\ncountries and give those countries access to\r\ntechnology, enabling them to fully participate in the\r\nnew economic system. All these measures would help\r\nput their peoples on the right track to development and\r\nprosperity.\r\nIn that context, the State of Kuwait is proud to\r\nhave honoured all its international obligations. It will\r\ncontinue to support economic development\r\nprogrammes in developing countries through the\r\nKuwait Fund for Economic Development. For the\r\nrecord, the Fund has so far extended $12 billion in\r\ndevelopment assistance to more than 100 countries in\r\nvarious regions of the world. Kuwait will also strive to\r\nensure the stability of global oil markets, with a view\r\nto maintaining the pace of development and economic\r\ngrowth for all.\r\nAs we observe the sixtieth anniversary of the\r\nestablishment of the United Nations, Kuwait remains\r\nhopeful, confident and optimistic about the role of the\r\nUnited Nations and its capability to deal with\r\ninternational issues that pose a threat to world peace\r\nand security.\r\nTo that noble end, the international community\r\nmust rally behind the United Nations and forge ahead\r\nat an even faster pace. We look forward to sincere and\r\nmeaningful cooperation and partnership to tackle the\r\ncurrent challenges. Furthermore, we must strive to\r\ncreate a future characterized by the values and ideals of\r\nfreedom, justice and equality which, together, underpin\r\nsecurity and stability across the world.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Mohamed Bedjaoui, Minister of State and Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Algeria.\r\nMr. Bedjaoui (Algeria) (spoke in French): At\r\nthis crucial moment, when it is debating questions vital\r\nto the United Nations and all humanity, the General\r\nAssembly has unanimously decided to elect you, Mr.\r\nPresident, to preside over the deliberations of its\r\nsixtieth session. I therefore congratulate you very\r\nwarmly and offer you my best wishes for success. I\r\nalso congratulate your predecessor, Mr. Jean Ping, and\r\nthank the Secretary-General for his efforts for peace,\r\ndevelopment and agreement among nations.\r\nOur world has been radically transformed since\r\nthe end of the cold war — that sombre period that still\r\nhas continuing effects. New threats have appeared,\r\nwhile other, older ones remain. New kinds of\r\nchallenges loom, even as the international community\r\nis falling behind in finding appropriate responses to\r\nexisting challenges, which are getting worse. New\r\nconflicts are erupting violently today, while the\r\ninternational community still struggles with the\r\nflashpoints that appeared following the Second World\r\nWar, as well as those that arose out of the ensuing\r\nprocess of decolonization.\r\nHumanitarian disasters, whether man-made or\r\nnatural, and the problems of refugees, famine, the\r\nAIDS pandemic and malaria, exacerbated by persistent\r\nunderdevelopment have contributed more than ever to\r\nstretch beyond strictly military issues our definition of\r\ncollective security, which our Organization, since its\r\nbirth, has been asked to promote. The mission to\r\nprotect remains today an unattainable goal.\r\nA vital threat seen daily throughout the world is\r\nthe growing threat of international terrorism, which\r\nrespects no borders and violates the most fundamental\r\nhuman rights. It is not enough to vigorously denounce\r\nthe killing of innocent victims. To combat terrorism,\r\nwe must oppose it with relentless determination. In that\r\ncontext, there is no alternative to resolute international\r\ncooperation that recognizes, above all, that an effective\r\nresponse to transnational terrorism is necessarily a\r\ncollective effort.\r\nAlgeria believes it urgent to implement existing\r\nagreements on the fight against terrorism and to\r\nconclude a comprehensive convention on terrorism that\r\ncan overcome the difficulties in reaching an agreed\r\ndefinition of terrorism while not providing pretexts for\r\nthe oppression of peoples seeking to realize their\r\nlegitimate rights. Active cooperation has been long\r\nawaited, but it is not sufficient.\r\nBilateral, regional and multilateral cooperation\r\nmust be expanded and improved as we strengthen\r\ninternational legal instruments, such as the\r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of Acts\r\nof Nuclear Terrorism, adopted last April.\r\nAt the same time, given the justifiable revulsion\r\nterrorism provokes, we must guard against attributing\r\nsuch acts to any religion or civilization. On the\r\ncontrary, we must emphasize that the aspiration to\r\npeace and the search for agreement and exchange\r\n13\r\nA/60/PV.15\r\namong peoples are values common to the various\r\ncivilizations we represent. That leads us to express our\r\ncomplete rejection of terrorism and spurs our collective\r\nreaction against it.\r\nWe cannot hide our concern at growing\r\nintolerance and the echoes we sometimes hear of\r\npseudo-theories and false analyses that show ever less\r\nrestraint in directly blaming Islam, which, for the\r\noverwhelming majority of a billion believers, is a\r\nreligion that calls for fraternity, solidarity and\r\ntolerance. To blame Islam — as some small but\r\ninfluential groups do — is to forget that before\r\nterrorism was recognized as an international\r\nphenomenon, it also struck, in particular, at Muslims\r\nwho had rejected the perpetrators and denied their\r\nclaims that they represented all Muslims.\r\nI strongly reaffirm that those criminals have placed\r\nthemselves outside Islam and have no claim to it. I say\r\nthis on behalf of a country that has suffered a decade of\r\nterrorism and which has found precisely in its religion\r\nthe endurance and the will to triumph over barbarism,\r\nstaunch its wounds, renew its hope and take the path of\r\nreconciliation and brotherhood, which are at the very\r\nheart of the community of people and its leaders, as we\r\napproach the national referendum of 29 September.\r\nAlthough the situation today confirms some of\r\nour earlier doubts and concerns, our only concern now\r\nis to see the people of Iraq — the heirs to an ancient\r\ncivilization that is admired by the whole world —\r\nreturn to peace and stability through the recovery of its\r\nfull and complete sovereignty over a territory whose\r\nintegrity is best preserved by exorcising the divisive\r\ndemons generated by the present circumstances.\r\nThe Arab world is today the site of promising\r\ndevelopments for the development of democracy and\r\neconomic prosperity for its people. It would be wrong\r\nto see in these developments merely a response to\r\nexternal pressure. First and foremost, it comes from\r\npeoples wishing to participate, finally and actively, in\r\ntheir future, and who are eager to make their specific\r\ncontribution to the conduct of affairs in a world where\r\nnothing that happens should be alien to them.\r\nThis desire for reform brought the Arab heads of\r\nState together in Algiers, last March for a summit\r\nmeeting, over which we were honoured to preside.\r\nReaffirming that desire, the leaders made firm\r\ncommitments and we have proceeded to implement\r\nthem.\r\nAs diverse as the Arab countries may be in their\r\npolitical, economic and social realities, we still have\r\nthe same aspiration, which is bearing us towards a\r\nfuture of peace and progress to be shared by all if\r\npossible. In other words, we are fully aware that no\r\npeace and no sustainable economic momentum can be\r\nbuilt in the Middle East unless the Palestinian people\r\nrecover their full and complete sovereignty in the\r\noccupied territories, including Al-Quds Al-Sharif,\r\ncapital of their independent State.\r\nIt is a positive thing that the risks of nuclear\r\nproliferation have received heightened international\r\nattention in the last few years. The seventh Conference\r\nto review the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty held\r\nlast May should have provided us with a special\r\noccasion to develop and adopt appropriate measures to\r\ndeal with the problem on a consensual basis. However,\r\nwe must note that our expectation was not met,\r\nparticularly with respect to the 13 measures on nuclear\r\ndisarmament agreed to at the preceding Conference.\r\nAlgeria, which has adopted and supported the\r\nAdditional Protocol on the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA) safeguards regime, also fully\r\nsupports total and complete disarmament, as well as\r\nthe total elimination of weapons of mass destruction.\r\nBut we cannot conceal our concern that an exception to\r\nthe treaty that has been tolerated, even allowed, in a\r\nregion as riven by conflict as the Middle East only\r\nfurther underscores the discriminatory approach that\r\nprevails with respect to non-proliferation.\r\nThe African landscape has been profoundly\r\ntransformed since the formation of the African Union\r\nand the launching of the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD). So it is with new energy that\r\nAfrica, having established its Peace and Security\r\nCouncil, has decided to tackle the conflicts that afflict\r\nit and to take up the resolute promotion of their final\r\nsettlement. Anyone who looks at Africa objectively\r\ncannot ignore the endemic diseases, all of the visible\r\nand latent crises, the natural and man-made disasters,\r\nthe famine and illiteracy. But today’s Africa, we must\r\nnote, has never had so many democratically elected\r\nregimes and so many economies undergoing promising\r\nreforms. Much still needs to be done, and the African\r\ncountries are the first to recognize that.\r\nOut of a sense of solidarity and also out of self-\r\ninterest, developed countries should accompany Africa\r\nin its determination to make a radical change in its\r\ncircumstances so as to allow the African continent to\r\n14\r\nA/60/PV.15\r\nbecome part of the world economy, gain prosperity and\r\nmake its contribution to the prosperity of the world in\r\ngeneral. This cannot be done unless we take specific\r\nactions that have been amply identified by NEPAD, by\r\nthe Commission for Africa established by Tony Blair\r\nand by the report of the Secretary-General of our\r\nOrganization.\r\nAs you know, the main points are to erase the\r\ndebt and raise official development assistance (ODA)\r\nfrom the current $25 billion to $50 billion and then to\r\n$75 billion between now and 2010, to establish an\r\ninternational finance facility and to raise ODA from the\r\ndeveloped countries to 0.7 per cent of their gross\r\ndomestic product by 2015.\r\nIt is also in Africa, near Algeria, that we still see\r\none of the last remaining uncompleted processes of\r\ndecolonization. I am referring to the conflict in the\r\nWestern Sahara, where Morocco and the Polisario\r\nFront are adversaries. The United Nations has\r\nidentified this territory as being non-autonomous, and\r\nit is a situation that is actionable under the Declaration\r\non the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries\r\nand Peoples. There is a peace plan that has been\r\napproved unanimously by the Security Council, calling\r\nfor a framework and modalities for a final settlement\r\nthrough a free consultation of the Saharawi people\r\nregarding their destiny.\r\nMy country believes that the Baker Plan is the\r\nonly framework able to lead to a settlement of the\r\nconflict, which pits Moroccans against the Polisario.\r\nAlgeria fully supports the efforts of the United Nations to\r\nthis end. We are pleased in this respect to see Mr. Peter\r\nvan Walsum appointed as Personal Envoy of the\r\nSecretary-General and we assure him of our support in his\r\nmission, just as we do the new Special Representative of\r\nthe Secretary-General for the Western Sahara.\r\nResolving the conflict in the Western Sahara in\r\nkeeping with norms of international legality and within\r\nthe framework of the United Nations would have the\r\npositive effect of giving critical momentum to the\r\nbuilding of the Greater Arab Maghreb, which Algeria\r\nhas always called for.\r\nWe can only agree with the Secretary-General\r\nwhen he puts development at the centre of his concept\r\nof a new international economic order and gives it\r\npriority attention within the United Nations agenda. A\r\nfew days ago, Member States evaluated progress made\r\nsince the September 2000 adoption of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), and we must admit that\r\nthe results are not that encouraging, the case of Africa\r\nbeing rather instructive. With regard to the\r\nimplementation of the eight goals of the 2000\r\nDeclaration, we would say that some of them, such as\r\npoverty reduction, have been deferred to a dangerously\r\nremote future.\r\nThe requirement of adapting to new international\r\nrealities makes reform an obligation for our\r\nOrganization. Such reform must be thoroughgoing and\r\nbalanced and serve and preserve the interests of as\r\nmany as possible. We cannot just have specific\r\namendments for the ambitions of a small number of\r\nMembers, legitimate though those ambitions may be.\r\nThe reforms to be undertaken must, above all, satisfy\r\nthe majority and serve the collective interests and\r\ncommon aspirations of all.\r\nThe special attention given to the expansion of\r\nthe Security Council is certainly justified, given the\r\ndominant role played by the Council in maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security, but we must not let\r\nthis cause us to lose sight of the legitimate demands of\r\nAfrica, nor of the need to maintain balance among the\r\nvarious bodies. Given the fact that most of the African\r\ncountries were excluded from the Conference for the\r\nUnited Nations at San Francisco because they were\r\ncolonies, it would be paradoxical, anachronistic and\r\nineffective if developing countries were now invited to\r\nvalidate reform proposals that ignore their interests and\r\nconcerns.\r\nIn this exercise that we are undertaking under the\r\nwatchful eye of our peoples, let us work together and\r\nembrace a common vision that will ensure a future of\r\npeace and prosperity shared by the Member States that\r\nthe United Nations has the duty to guarantee.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Miguel Ángel Moratinos Cuyaubé, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and Cooperation of Spain.\r\nMr. Moratinos Cuyaubé (Spain) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): Sixty years ago at San Francisco, the United\r\nNations Charter was adopted. It was an event that set\r\nthe path for the future of nations and peoples. It was an\r\nevent at which intelligence was resolutely dedicated to\r\npeace and justice, and willpower was used for the\r\ncommon interest.\r\nWith the adoption of the outcome document by\r\nthe High-level Plenary Meeting, a process of\r\n15\r\nA/60/PV.15\r\nparamount importance has been set in motion, one in\r\nwhich you, Sir, can count on the full support of the\r\ndelegation of Spain. I wish to pay tribute to the\r\nsustained effort of your predecessor, Mr. Jean Ping, and\r\nto reiterate to our Secretary-General my admiration for\r\nhis personal and diplomatic skills.\r\nThere can be no doubt that the United Nations\r\nhas taken a step forward as a result of the High-level\r\nPlenary Meeting. We have achieved progress in\r\nessential areas. Spain is satisfied with the outcome\r\nbecause we have stressed the importance of assisting\r\nvictims of terrorism. The Alliance of Civilizations\r\ninitiative has been well received. The summit recalled\r\nthe need to continue assisting middle-income countries\r\nand supported the search for new sources of financing\r\nfor implementation of the Action against Hunger and\r\nPoverty initiative.\r\nI would like to mention here that an initiative on\r\nUnited Nations reform was unanimously adopted by\r\nthe Spanish Parliament on 13 September 2005, urging\r\nthe Government to achieve a number of objectives that\r\nare now reflected in the outcome document of the\r\nrecent High-level Meeting. We recognized in that\r\ndocument that development, peace and security and\r\nhuman rights constitute the three basic interdependent\r\nand interrelated pillars of the United Nations system\r\nand are the foundation for our collective security and\r\nwell-being. In our globalized world, we can solve\r\ninternational problems, and deal with new challenges\r\nand risks only through concerted action based on\r\nsolidarity.\r\nAmong those collective actions, the fight against\r\nterrorism is an absolute priority for Spain. The General\r\nAssembly should adopt a global strategy that includes\r\nthe goal of creating an international fund for victims.\r\nSpain has just signed the International Convention for\r\nthe Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, and in\r\nthe Sixth Committee Spain is determined to promote\r\nthe adoption of a comprehensive convention on\r\ninternational terrorism before the end of this sixtieth\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nThe summit concluded that tolerance, respect,\r\ndialogue and cooperation amongst different cultures,\r\ncivilizations and peoples are essential elements for the\r\npromotion of international peace and security. This is\r\nprecisely the conviction that inspired the President of\r\nthe Government of Spain to propose the Alliance of\r\nCivilizations initiative at the previous General\r\nAssembly. The Secretary-General’s High-level Group\r\nto guide the initiative will hold its first meeting in my\r\ncountry this autumn. This initiative, co-sponsored by\r\nthe President of the Government of Spain and the\r\nPrime Minister of Turkey, is more necessary today than\r\never. It is imperative to put an end to the negative drift\r\nin mutual perceptions that is being fomented and used\r\nby extremist groups.\r\nIt is also urgent to find innovative and additional\r\nsources of financing for development. For that reason,\r\nSpain, along with five other countries, is promoting the\r\nAction against Hunger and Poverty initiative with the\r\naim of identifying innovative and additional sources of\r\nfinancing for development. In this regard, Spain\r\nactively participates in the cancellation of debt to\r\nbenefit the heavily indebted poor countries and is\r\npreparing a plan to swap debt for public investment in\r\nkey human development areas in Latin America.\r\nLet me reiterate Spain’s firm commitment to\r\npeacekeeping operations, which translates into\r\nsubstantial contributions of our armed and security\r\nforces wherever needed, especially in the Balkans,\r\nHaiti and Afghanistan. I would like to underline the\r\nhigh degree of commitment and professionalism shown\r\nby Spanish peacekeeping forces and recall with pride\r\nthose who have sacrificed their lives for international\r\npeace and security. The creation of a Peacebuilding\r\nCommission is another outstanding achievement of this\r\nsummit. Spain, as an important contributor to the\r\nUnited Nations budget and to its peacekeeping\r\noperations, is ready to participate actively in the work\r\nof this commission.\r\nSince its inception this Organization has been\r\ndetermined to provide the international community\r\nwith a binding legal framework for the protection and\r\npromotion of human rights. Spain shares this goal. We\r\nhave strengthened our cooperation with the Office of\r\nthe High Commissioner for Human Rights, and we\r\nhave increased our contribution to its budget. We are\r\nalso pleased with the establishment of a Human Rights\r\nCouncil and are fully prepared to contribute actively to\r\nthe work of this new council. Over the past year,\r\nimportant legislative developments have occurred in\r\nmy country, and we have taken significant steps to\r\npromote real equality among citizens in areas such as\r\ngender violence and discrimination on grounds of\r\nsexual orientation. The Government has also tackled\r\nthe situation of immigrant workers through the\r\n16\r\nA/60/PV.15\r\nimplementation of a broad-ranging legalization\r\nprocess.\r\nWe firmly support the reform process aimed at\r\nstrengthening the effectiveness of the United Nations,\r\nwhich will ensure the concrete implementation of its\r\nresolutions. It is of little use to improve existing\r\nstructures, if there is no enforcement of compliance\r\nwith decisions. The United Nations must regain its\r\ncredibility. We believe that the reform, especially that\r\nof the Security Council, must be the result of a broad\r\nagreement among all of us.\r\nI agree with the Secretary-General that our\r\ngreatest failure has to do with non-proliferation and\r\ndisarmament. For Spain, nuclear proliferation\r\nrepresents a serious risk for international peace and\r\nsecurity. We are concerned about the illicit trade in\r\nsmall arms and light weapons, and we support the\r\npreparation of an international arms trade treaty.\r\nI cannot but mention here, once again this year,\r\nthe question of Gibraltar and the need to put an end to\r\nthis dispute through the implementation of the repeated\r\nmandates of the General Assembly that have urged\r\nSpain and the United Kingdom to continue their\r\nbilateral negotiations, with a view to reaching a\r\ndefinitive solution to the decolonization process, in\r\naccordance with the relevant United Nations\r\nresolutions. Spain is willing to work in a constructive\r\nspirit; this spirit is reflected in the creation of a\r\ntrilateral dialogue forum, the aim of which is to\r\nproduce an atmosphere of mutual trust and cooperation\r\nfor the benefit and prosperity of Gibraltar and the\r\nregion as a whole.\r\nNext month, Spain will host the fifteenth Ibero-\r\nAmerican Summit in Salamanca. It will be a meeting\r\nthat will constitute a turning point in the creation of a\r\ntrue Ibero-American forum, with the\r\ninstitutionalization of its secretariat and the\r\nmanifestation of a stronger will to contribute to\r\neffective multilateralism.\r\nSpain pays particular attention to its relations\r\nwith its neighbours in the Maghreb region. Through an\r\nactive and comprehensive policy, Spain wishes to\r\nreinforce its cooperation with those countries, firmly\r\nsupporting political stability, respect for human rights\r\nand those reforms that are put in place to consolidate\r\nthe rule of law and economic and social development.\r\nIn this regard, Spain firmly believes that the\r\nWestern Sahara conflict, which has lasted for almost 30\r\nyears, requires priority attention. The international\r\ncommunity must contribute to overcome the stalemate\r\nand offer, within the framework of the United Nations,\r\na just and definitive political solution, in accordance\r\nwith international law. To that end, Spain is developing\r\nan active diplomacy and believes that steps taken, such\r\nas the recent appointments by the Secretary-General of\r\nhis Personal Envoy and of the Special Representative\r\nfor the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in\r\nWestern Sahara, will provide the opportunity to\r\nrelaunch the process.\r\nIn the Middle East, the disengagement from\r\nGaza, carried out with great skill and with great\r\neffectiveness by the Israeli Government, may\r\nconstitute a powerful driving force in the peace\r\nprocess. It is only right to congratulate the Government\r\nof Israel for its decision. I also extend my\r\ncongratulations to the Palestinian National Authority\r\nfor having significantly contributed to the entire\r\noperation, so that it was completed in a peaceful\r\nmanner. Now that the disengagement has been\r\nsatisfactorily completed, the road map must again\r\nbecome the central framework for the peace process.\r\nMoreover, the time has come to increase our aid\r\nto Africa and to support African countries in their\r\nefforts aimed at integration, peace and progress.\r\nThe summit outcome document is a good starting\r\npoint to continue working towards achieving the\r\nagreements that still elude us. We cannot allow\r\ninaction, lack of ambition or shortsightedness to\r\nprevent the successful conclusion of the task ahead.\r\nSixty years ago the signatories of the United Nations\r\nCharter translated into an agreement a thought that was\r\nas solid as it was simple: we can either walk together\r\ntowards peace, or we will never find it. A year ago,\r\nbefore this Assembly, the President of the Spanish\r\nGovernment recalled that the history of humanity does\r\nnot give us many reasons to be optimistic. Let us work\r\nwith imagination and commitment to turn this\r\nOrganization into an expression of common will, an\r\nOrganization legitimized by its effectiveness and its\r\nuniversal character. Let us work so that some day we\r\nwill feel proud as human beings. We are the United\r\nNations, and the people of the world expect us to act as\r\nsuch in the face of the challenges and opportunities\r\nafforded to us in these times of change.\r\n17\r\nA/60/PV.15\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to Her\r\nExcellency Mrs. Micheline Calmy-Rey, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Switzerland.\r\nMrs. Calmy-Rey (Switzerland) (spoke in\r\nFrench): I would like to congratulate you,\r\nMr. Eliasson, on your election to the presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and to assure you of my country’s\r\nfull support during this sixtieth session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nReform will be a central theme at the Assembly’s\r\nsixtieth session. Allow me to focus on four institutional\r\nreforms, by which Switzerland sets great store. They\r\nare, first of all, the creation of a Human Rights\r\nCouncil; secondly, reform of the Security Council;\r\nthirdly, the Peacebuilding Commission; and, fourthly,\r\ninternal management of the United Nations.\r\nThe creation of a Human Rights Council is\r\ncrucial. The Commission on Human Rights in its\r\npresent form suffers from various defects. We deplore\r\nits weak capacity to respond to grave human rights\r\nviolations. We also regret its overly selective character\r\nand the application of double standards, which\r\nundermine its authority.\r\nSwitzerland welcomes the decision made by the\r\nMember States at the summit to replace the\r\nCommission on Human Rights with a Human Rights\r\nCouncil. However, we regret that it has not been\r\npossible, even at this stage, to establish some of the\r\nworking methods on which there was wide agreement.\r\nFor Switzerland, this Human Rights Council\r\nshould be a principal organ of the United Nations or\r\nshould at least be directly subordinate to the General\r\nAssembly. It should convene periodically, be based in\r\nGeneva and should work in close cooperation with the\r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nHuman Rights. It should be of a size that guarantees\r\nboth its legitimacy and the capacity to work effectively.\r\nFinally, to ensure real added value, it should incorporate\r\nthose instruments that constitute the strength of the\r\npresent Commission without reproducing its defects.\r\nThe profile and working methods of the Human\r\nRights Council should be established promptly. We\r\nhave given ourselves until the end of the sixtieth\r\nsession of the General Assembly to do this, but the\r\nideal solution would be to complete the work before\r\nthe next session of the Commission on Human Rights,\r\nwhich starts next March.\r\nWe now need a clearer picture of the process\r\nwhich the President of the General Assembly intends to\r\nconduct. We assure him of our strong support in this\r\ntask. Switzerland hopes that the future Human Rights\r\nCouncil can start its work soon, and it invites all States\r\nto strive towards this goal.\r\nSwitzerland has also been actively involved in the\r\nreform of the Security Council, an organ that embodies\r\nboth the strengths and the weaknesses of the United\r\nNations. No one can deny that the composition of the\r\nSecurity Council should better reflect contemporary\r\ngeopolitical realities. Enlargement of the Security\r\nCouncil will make it more representative and will\r\nstrengthen the authority of its decisions. However,\r\nenlargement of the Security Council, which has been\r\nthe subject of intensive debate over the past few\r\nmonths, is only one aspect of the reform that needs to\r\nbe made. It should not overshadow another\r\nindispensable part of the reform: the need to improve\r\nthe Council’s working methods.\r\nFor most countries, opportunities to sit on the\r\nSecurity Council are few and limited in time. A serious\r\nreform of the Council’s working methods would have\r\nan immediate and beneficial effect for all Member\r\nStates. New and more detailed rules should be adopted\r\nin a General Assembly resolution and then written into\r\nthe Security Council’s rules of procedure.\r\nReform of the Security Council’s working\r\nmethods must achieve several goals: it should increase\r\nthe possibilities for participation by States that are not\r\nmembers of the Council; it should ensure greater\r\naccountability of the Council to all the Member States\r\nof the United Nations; and, finally, it should improve\r\ntransparency and find new ways for the Council to hear\r\nother points of view.\r\nEfficiency is a fourth criterion that needs to be\r\ntaken into account. Improvements in the working methods\r\nof the Security Council must be geared towards\r\nstrengthening its capacity to efficiently exercise its\r\nresponsibilities for international peacekeeping and\r\nsecurity.\r\nIn May Switzerland presented a series of specific\r\nrecommendations that were well received by many\r\nMember States. I would like to focus on three specific\r\nproposals.\r\nFirst, in accordance with the principle of the\r\nresponsibility to protect, the right of veto must not be\r\n18\r\nA/60/PV.15\r\nexercised in cases of genocide, ethnic cleansing or\r\nother grave and large-scale violations of international\r\nhumanitarian law or human rights. I believe that that\r\nprinciple is sufficiently clear not to require further\r\nelaboration.\r\nSecondly, the Security Council should refrain, as\r\nfar as possible, from exercising legislative functions.\r\nThe task of codifying and developing international law\r\nshould remain the primary responsibility of the General\r\nAssembly, which includes all Member States. The\r\nCouncil is authorized by the United Nations Charter to\r\ntake emergency measures to maintain international\r\npeace and security. However, that authorization cannot\r\nbe interpreted as including the power to impose\r\nlegislative obligations, that is, obligations that are\r\ngeneral in scope, abstract and have no time limits.\r\nThirdly, on the subject of Security Council\r\nsanctions, the procedures for establishing and revising\r\nthe lists of targeted individuals and entities must be\r\nimproved. It is unacceptable that people who are\r\nsubject to sanctions that affect their basic rights are\r\ndenied all right of appeal. In particular, it is important\r\nto ensure the right to be heard, which is a fundamental\r\nhuman right.\r\nSwitzerland, together with other countries,\r\nintends to present a draft resolution on improving the\r\nworking methods of the Security Council.\r\nAnother important institutional reform decided at\r\nthe summit is the creation of a Peacebuilding\r\nCommission. Switzerland has contributed its ideas to\r\nthat project over the past few months. It welcomes the\r\ncreation of that body, which will address a key area of\r\nUnited Nations activities and fill a clear institutional\r\ngap.\r\nOnce a conflict has ended, the main players —\r\ninstitutions, States and civil society — must work\r\ntogether to rebuild the country. The principal mission\r\nof the Peacebuilding Commission will be to bring those\r\nplayers from the fields of peacekeeping, humanitarian\r\naid, and development together to define joint strategies\r\nfor future action.\r\nThe Commission will include representatives of\r\nthe Security Council and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil, as well as representatives of the principal\r\nfinancial donors and troop contributors. Switzerland\r\nbelieves that the main United Nations institutions\r\nconcerned should also take part in the deliberations.\r\nFor instance, it would be useful to include the\r\nChairman of the United Nations Development Group,\r\nthe Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs\r\nand the High Commissioner for Human Rights. It\r\nwould also be useful to bring on board, as needed,\r\nexperts from civil society, the academic world or the\r\nprivate sector.\r\nFurthermore, in the composition of the\r\nCommission, we need to ensure gender parity.\r\nPeacekeeping, humanitarian action and\r\ndevelopment are parallel activities and should not be\r\nrigidly divided into successive phases. In drafting its\r\nmandate, we should ensure that the Commission has\r\nthe ability to advise all the institutional actors\r\nconcerned at any step of the peace and reconstruction\r\nprocess.\r\nWe cannot speak of improving the efficiency of\r\nthe Security Council without discussing the\r\nimprovements that have to be made in the internal\r\nmanagement of the United Nations. The Summit\r\nOutcome document sets out the most urgently needed\r\nmeasures. They must be implemented without delay.\r\nIn that context, the three following factors must\r\nbe taken into account: first, the political competence\r\nand responsibility to decide the budget belong to the\r\nGeneral Assembly; secondly, the Secretary-General’s\r\nmanagement authority must be extended; and, thirdly,\r\nthe internal oversight bodies must be strengthened.\r\nThe scandals that have tarnished the image of the\r\nUnited Nations in recent months underscore the urgent\r\nneed to strengthen the means as well as the financial\r\nand operational independence of the Office of Internal\r\nOversight Services. Furthermore, given the increasing\r\ncomplexity of their task, we must strengthen\r\ncooperation between the various oversight bodies,\r\nwhich are spread across the United Nations system. We\r\ninvite the Member States to support the enlargement of\r\nthe mandate of the Office of Internal Oversight\r\nServices, so that it is able to respond to requests for\r\nassistance from the specialized agencies.\r\nEspecially close to my heart is the importance of\r\ncombating cases of abuse and sexual exploitation\r\ncommitted in the context of United Nations peace\r\noperations. Such abuses are a grave violation of human\r\nrights and of the values that the Organization espouses.\r\nThey damage the credibility of the Organization and\r\nhinder the accomplishment of its missions on the\r\n19\r\nA/60/PV.15\r\nground. Switzerland advocates zero tolerance on this\r\nquestion. We strongly support the measures that have\r\nrecently been taken, in particular an increase in the\r\nnumber of resident investigators deployed on the\r\nground under the authority of the Office of Internal\r\nOversight Services.\r\nLast autumn, we embarked together on a major\r\nundertaking: adapting the multilateral system so that it\r\ncan address the new problems and challenges of the\r\ntwenty-first century, with a strengthened and more\r\nefficient United Nations at its centre. All reform\r\nrequires a subtle mix of ambition, realism and patience.\r\nWe have come part of the way. The basic itinerary was\r\nset at the summit. We must now pursue the path of\r\nreform, give shape to our early decisions, and resolve\r\npersisting differences. That has to be one of the main\r\nobjectives of the sixtieth session of the General\r\nAssembly, which has just begun.\r\nThe President: I now call on Her Excellency\r\nMrs. Aïchatou Mindaoudou, Minister for Foreign Affairs,\r\nCooperation and African Integration of the Niger.\r\nMrs. Mindaoudou (Niger) (spoke in French): I\r\nam very pleased, Mr. President, on behalf of the\r\ndelegation of the Niger, to express our warmest\r\ncongratulations on your election to the presidency of\r\nthe sixtieth session of the General Assembly. In\r\nelecting you, we recognize your outstanding qualities\r\nas a diplomat and as an active player on the ground —\r\nqualities that augur well for the success of the present\r\nsession. Rest assured, Sir, that you will have the full\r\nsupport of my delegation. We wish you every success\r\nin accomplishing your task.\r\nTo your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Jean\r\nPing, I wish to express our appreciation and our\r\ngratitude for the wisdom, skill and insight with which\r\nhe guided the work of our previous session and\r\nprepared for the High-level Plenary Meeting.\r\nTo Secretary-General Kofi Annan, I wish to pay a\r\nwell-deserved tribute for the decisive role he has\r\nplayed at the head of our Organization. We pledge our\r\nunswerving support for his efforts to reform the United\r\nNations system and adapt it to the concerns of today.\r\nNeed we recall the historic nature of our session?\r\nIt is taking place exactly 10 years after the Declaration\r\nand Platform for Action were adopted by the Fourth\r\nWorld Conference on Women in Beijing and the\r\nProgramme of Action was adopted by the World\r\nSummit for Social Development in Copenhagen. The\r\nSecretary-General, in his important report entitled “In\r\nlarger freedom: towards development, security and human\r\nrights for all” (A/59/2005), made a comprehensive\r\ndiagnosis of the multiform and interdependent threats\r\nand challenges facing the world and, at the same time,\r\nmade interesting recommendations to deal with them.\r\nEqually historic is the outcome document (resolution\r\n60/1) of the High-level Plenary Meeting, which we just\r\nadopted. It is a source of great hope in our arduous\r\nefforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nAmong those threats and challenges, to which I shall\r\nrefer again presently, are terrorism, the inequalities of\r\nthe international economic and trade system, and\r\nviolations of human rights.\r\nTerrorism continues to rage throughout the world,\r\nseriously threatening international peace and security.\r\nThe recent attacks in London and Sharm el-Sheikh\r\nattest eloquently to that fact. The fight against this\r\nscourge must therefore be strengthened and carried out\r\nover the long term, but within the framework of\r\ninternational law. In that regard, we believe it is crucial\r\nto accelerate the process of elaborating an international\r\nconvention to fight terrorism. Such a convention\r\nshould define the concept clearly to avoid ambiguity.\r\nMoreover, the fight against terrorism cannot be\r\neffective and fruitful without appropriate international\r\ncooperation. It is because of such cooperation — which\r\nhas enabled us to strengthen the capacities of our defence\r\nand security forces — that my country has recently had\r\nconsiderable success in combating this phenomenon.\r\nPeace and security also require the adoption of\r\neffective measures against the proliferation of weapons\r\nin general. Here, I welcome the initiative of the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States — which\r\nthe Niger currently chairs — aimed at establishing a\r\nlegally binding instrument: its moratorium on the\r\nmanufacture, import and export of weapons. That\r\napproach has led us to regret the failure at the most\r\nrecent review conference of the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\r\nToday, international peace and security are being\r\nsorely tested by a steadily rising number of conflicts,\r\nsome of which seem to be endless quagmires because\r\nof their persistence and recurrence. In West Africa,\r\nalthough some hotbeds of tension are in the process of\r\nbeing defused — such as in Sierra Leone, Liberia and\r\nGuinea-Bissau — the subregion is still not completely\r\n20\r\nA/60/PV.15\r\nfree of insecurity and instability. We hope for positive\r\ndevelopments in Côte d’Ivoire that will permit a swift\r\nreturn to normalcy in that country, formerly a harbour\r\nof peace and prosperity.\r\nIn Western Sahara, the Niger reaffirms its support\r\nfor the Secretary-General’s efforts to bring about a just\r\nand lasting settlement of the conflict in accordance\r\nwith the relevant United Nations resolutions.\r\nIn Burundi, we welcome the positive outcome of\r\nthe peace process culminating in the legislative and\r\npresidential elections.\r\nPeace must not only be re-established and\r\nmaintained; it must also be consolidated. In that regard,\r\nthe Secretary-General’s proposal concerning the\r\ncreation of a Peacebuilding Commission is of capital\r\nimportance, in that it will enable many countries\r\nemerging from conflict to break the vicious circle of\r\nviolence and devastation.\r\nConcerning the Middle East, my country wishes\r\nto reaffirm once again that settlement of the Israeli-\r\nPalestinian conflict necessarily depends upon the\r\nrealization of the rights of the Palestinian people,\r\nincluding the creation of an independent, sovereign and\r\nviable State. In that regard, Israel’s withdrawal from\r\nthe Gaza Strip is a positive step that, we hope, will\r\npermit the resumption of negotiations within the\r\nframework of the road map.\r\nWith regard to Jammu and Kashmir, we remain\r\nconvinced that the relevant United Nations resolutions\r\nmust be implemented to enable the Kashmiri people to\r\nexercise their right to self-determination. That should\r\nfurther reduce the tensions between India and Pakistan.\r\nThe Niger, a member of the contact group of the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference on that issue,\r\nencourages the two parties to move forward in their\r\ntalks aimed at a definitive settlement of this problem.\r\nThis year, as we assess the progress made in\r\nhonouring the commitments made at the Millennium\r\nSummit, the outcome document of the High-level\r\nPlenary Meeting, which we just adopted, once again\r\nemphasizes the interdependence of States and\r\nhighlights the need for increased solidarity. To that\r\nend, solidarity and international cooperation must,\r\nmore than ever before, go beyond professions of faith\r\nif they are to be more effective. In any event, solidarity\r\nmust no longer be infinitely variable, as is\r\nunfortunately the case today.\r\nThe Niger, recently the victim of an acute food\r\ncrisis, would like international solidarity to be\r\nrethought so that we can invest in the future by\r\nimplementing lasting solutions that will ensure\r\npermanent food security for our people. Without a\r\nrethought solidarity, many African countries, including\r\nmine, may unfortunately never be able to achieve the\r\nMillennium Development Goals by 2015. That would\r\nrequire an increase in official development assistance,\r\nfrom both a qualitative and a quantitative perspective.\r\nIn that regard, we welcome the decision of those\r\ndeveloped countries that have elaborated a timetable\r\nenabling them to achieve the set objective of 0.7 per\r\ncent of their gross domestic product by 2015. A\r\nrethought solidarity would also require the\r\nestablishment of innovative financing sources that\r\nwould not place an excessive burden on developing\r\ncountries.\r\nWe welcome the recent decisions taken by\r\npartners, particularly the Group of Eight and the\r\nEuropean Union. We urge the international community\r\nand the United Nations to further strengthen their\r\ncooperation with the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment and with new initiatives for Africa,\r\nincluding the Blair Commission’s International\r\nFinance, Facility, President Bush’s Millennium\r\nChallenge Account and the Chirac-Lula initiative.\r\nWith regard to international trade, we hope that\r\nthe multilateral negotiations under way will lead to\r\nmutually advantageous results by 2006, as planned.\r\nHowever, in the interest of mutual and shared\r\ndevelopment, there must be an end to all agricultural\r\nsubsidies on exports. In that regard, the Hong Kong\r\nMinisterial Conference planned for December is a\r\ncrucial event for us that, once again, should be\r\nattended with this rethought solidarity in mind,\r\nparticularly with regard to the poorest countries.\r\nConcerning institutional reform of the United\r\nNations, my country wishes to pay tribute to the far-\r\nsightedness of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\r\nin identifying the stakes of such reform and in making\r\nhis interesting and important recommendations.\r\nThe Niger is fully committed to the role played\r\nby Africa in the international arena. That collective\r\ncommitment has led us to forge a common position on\r\nUnited Nations reform, which my country\r\nwholeheartedly supports. In fact, our continent, whose\r\nimportance is more apparent every day, must pursue\r\n21\r\nA/60/PV.15\r\nwith determination and in unity its fight for the\r\ndemocratization of international relations.\r\nThe United Nations is the only world body with\r\nthe mandate of addressing issues of security,\r\ndevelopment and human rights. To be equal to that\r\nimmense and delicate mission, it must be fair,\r\nrepresentative and democratic. It must also base its\r\nactions on multilateralism and consultation,\r\nparticularly within the General Assembly.\r\nThe long-awaited reform of the Security Council\r\nmust be pursued in transparency so that a renewed\r\nUnited Nations can be more democratic and more\r\nrepresentative of today’s world.\r\nThe Economic and Social Council, for its part,\r\nmust be the forum for coordinating and drafting\r\nstrategies so that the excellent opportunities created in\r\nthis increasingly globalized world will also be\r\naccessible to the poorest countries.\r\nThe establishment of a Peacebuilding\r\nCommission has filled a significant void, because it\r\nconstitutes a formerly non-existent link between\r\nsecurity and development.\r\nWe welcome the creation of the Human Rights\r\nCouncil, based on the principles of universality and\r\nnon-exclusion. These are the prerequisites for\r\nstrengthening and improving our shared House.\r\nThe President: I give the floor to His Excellency\r\nMr. Juli Minoves-Triquell, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs, Culture and Cooperation of the Principality of\r\nAndorra.\r\nMr. Minoves-Triquell (Andorra) (spoke in\r\nCatalan; English translation provided by the\r\ndelegation): At the beginning of the third millennium,\r\nfaster means of travel that began in the nineteenth\r\ncentury with railroad technology are today hurtling us\r\naround the globe at even faster speeds. Dramatic\r\nchanges are taking place at all levels and in all modes\r\nof communication. From the train, to the automobile\r\nand to the airplane, even in space travel, speed is\r\nerasing spatial barriers. The telegraph, the telephone,\r\nthe Internet, cell phones, video conferencing: speed is\r\naltering the way we communicate with one another.\r\nIn this new age, immensely significant\r\ndevelopments can take place as more quickly than the\r\nmind can follow them. But as the philosopher Paul\r\nVirillio warns us, with every new technology comes\r\nthe potential for a new accident and with increasing\r\nspeed comes the threat of ever more horrendous\r\ncatastrophes. Natural disasters have become magnified\r\nnot only by increases in population, but by the growing\r\ndangers of environmental pollution.\r\nSixty years after the founding of the United\r\nNations, we live in a faster world, where we have to be\r\nable to react to events almost immediately. We have to\r\nensure that even with the feeling of heightened risk\r\nthat we live with at the beginning of the twenty-first\r\ncentury — whether this be due to natural phenomena,\r\nadvances in technology, the threat of terrorism or the\r\nfrittering away of resources — our will to act is not in\r\nany way diminished. The bar is set very high, but our\r\ncapacity to act together as a whole can be just as great.\r\nAnother period of technological innovation also\r\naffected dramatic changes in the speed and mode of\r\ncommunication — the printing press. Let us reflect for\r\na moment about the effects of those changes and what\r\nwe might learn from them. The printing press fostered\r\na rapid exchange of information that was readily\r\navailable to large numbers of people and could not be\r\ncensored or controlled, although some institutions tried\r\nvery hard to enact such controls. Out of this explosion\r\nof information came the glory of a scientific revolution\r\nbut also the sixteenth-century wars of religion and\r\nEurope’s first world war, the Thirty Years War of the\r\nfirst half of the seventeenth century. The promise of\r\neventual mastery over the natural world was coupled\r\nwith violent attempts to dominate the minds and souls\r\nof man.\r\nIn many ways, our own information revolution\r\nhas had a similar effect on developments. On the one\r\nhand, we have reason to hope that the problems facing\r\nthe world can be solved by technology; on the other\r\nhand, technology has contributed to the rise of\r\nextremism and provided the means to unleash violence\r\nof hitherto unknown proportions.\r\nThe radical enlightenment, which first began in\r\nthe Netherlands, a small country but one known for its\r\ntolerance and liberty of creative thought, offered new\r\nsolutions to the turmoil and sectarian violence of the\r\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries. It developed a\r\nmode of critique that could be separated from religious\r\ntruth, and, for the first time in the history of the West, a\r\nfully modern ethical system. What forms might a\r\nradical twenty-first century enlightenment take? I\r\nwould rather hope that we will see a new sense of\r\n22\r\nA/60/PV.15\r\nhuman values, a recognition that we are united not only\r\nby our presence in a shrinking world but as members of\r\nthe human race.\r\nWe are fully aware that even as this explosion in\r\ntechnology seems to link all countries in the embrace\r\nof a globalized media culture, it feeds old\r\nparochialisms, nationalism and ethnic strife. The gap\r\nbetween rich and poor, the have and have-not\r\ncountries, seems ever wider, even as our\r\ninterconnectedness grows in trade and in labour. But\r\nwith visions of first-world excess beamed into every\r\ncomer of the globe, can anyone be surprised that anger\r\ntowards the West increases? Poverty, discrimination,\r\nwar, hunger and disease — this is the daily lot for a\r\ngreat part of humanity. We see the images every day.\r\nWe cannot ignore nor can we fear these realities. We\r\nhave to face them with real development policies\r\ncoupled with good governance and a just system for\r\ntrade and dialogue. The Millennium Development\r\nGoals are our collective responsibility.\r\nThe legacy of the Renaissance nation State\r\nremains a powerful concept. Our love for our\r\nrespective countries and all that this represents to us is\r\na defining aspect of our identities. So how is it possible\r\nto overcome the fundamental paradox of this\r\nOrganization — to link the pride of our national\r\nstatehood, which is the source of our material, cultural\r\nand ethnic differences, to the idea of unity, of being\r\n“united”.\r\nIn part, the answer seems to lie in the potential\r\nfor rebalancing the global economy, but it also requires\r\na reawakening of those dulled sensibilities that\r\nseparate rich from poor, the advantaged from the\r\ndisadvantaged, the free from the oppressed. The\r\nMillennium Declaration was a necessary step forward,\r\nand the current tensions over reform should not distract\r\nthis body from its ultimate mission.\r\nWhether we are speeding towards challenges that\r\nwill take the form of natural or man-made catastrophes,\r\nwe can be assured that their effects will no longer be\r\ncontained within national borders. We must prepare to\r\nrespond to them with a strength and resolve that also\r\nknows no bounds.\r\nBefore, I spoke of a small country, the\r\nNetherlands, and of its history. Andorra is also a small\r\ncountry that believes in tolerance and respect for our\r\nfellow man. Our stable relations with our neighbours,\r\nAndorra’s tradition as a safe haven during European\r\nwars and conflicts, our parliamentary tradition that\r\nstretches back to 1419 and our geopolitical realities, all\r\nmake us believe in and defend the virtues and values of\r\ndialogue, pacifism and development, which are at one\r\nwith those of the United Nations.\r\nIn twelve years of international life, my country\r\nhas adopted some 130 international conventions and\r\nhas stated its firm belief in international law, as in the\r\ncreation of the International Criminal Court. We will\r\ncontinue in this task, reaffirming our commitment to\r\nmultilateralism, and by sending to Parliament for\r\nratification the conventions on terrorism and human\r\nrights. We also give our support to the creation of a\r\nCouncil of Human Rights, and we will follow closely\r\nthe progress made on a new convention in the struggle\r\nagainst terrorism.\r\nThe United Nations represents a legacy from a\r\nperiod of conflict which culminated in the Second\r\nWorld War, the Cold War, and the nuclear stalemate\r\nthat followed. While we recognize its imperfections,\r\nwe must not forget to acknowledge the wisdom of its\r\nguiding principles: peace between all nations, universal\r\nhuman rights, and the development of states.\r\nWe live in a time when the power of a single\r\nnation is fast becoming an historical illusion. Let us\r\nwork towards a new enlightenment, the unity of the\r\nUnited Nations. It is time to work together for the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Talbak Nazarov, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Tajikistan.\r\nMr. Nazarov (Tajikistan) (spoke in Russian): The\r\nrecently convened High-level Plenary Meeting at the\r\nlevel of heads of State or Government can rightly be\r\nreferred to as the major historical event of the\r\nbeginning of the new millennium. It is important that,\r\nat the summit, the international community not only\r\nreiterated previously undertaken commitments but also\r\ntook new, concrete decisions for their practical\r\nimplementation. Most importantly, world leaders\r\nclearly stated that there is no alternative to the United\r\nNations as an international Organization that can\r\ncoordinate efforts to address the challenges faced by\r\nhumankind.\r\nThrough the common political will of world\r\nleaders, a unique opportunity has arisen to strengthen\r\njoint efforts towards peaceful and sustainable social\r\n23\r\nA/60/PV.15\r\nand economic development and the achievement of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs); to progress\r\ntowards the eradication of poverty and disease; to\r\novercome humanitarian crises; and to provide a better\r\nworld for present and future generations.\r\nFurther progress requires united, concerted and\r\nconsistent action on the part of the international\r\ncommunity as a whole. There is no doubt that the\r\nUnited Nations must play a key role in mobilizing and\r\ncoordinating such efforts. We share the view that it is\r\nnecessary to strengthen the Organization and its\r\nspecialized agencies, including through the urgent\r\nreform of the Secretariat and of other United Nations\r\nbodies.\r\nTajikistan welcomes the outcome of the\r\nSeptember summit and is prepared to meet all the\r\ncommitments and implement all the decisions outlined\r\nin its outcome document. We view them as a pledge by\r\nthe international community to devote the necessary\r\nattention to human development challenges and, to that\r\nend, to channel additional financial resources to\r\ncountries in extreme need, such as Tajikistan.\r\nThe Millennium Development Goals must remain\r\nthe focus of our efforts. There is no doubt that, at the\r\nnational level, the pace of, and priorities in, the\r\nimplementation of the MDGs must be adapted to the\r\nconditions prevailing in particular countries, each of\r\nwhich has its own way of doing things and its own\r\nparticular characteristics.\r\nTajikistan aims to achieve maximum progress in\r\nthe implementation of the Millennium Development\r\nGoals. Despite the difficulties we face, we have made\r\nreal progress towards attaining them. According to the\r\nWorld Bank, noticeable positive changes have occurred\r\nin the area of poverty reduction: in recent years the\r\nnumber of people living below the poverty line has\r\ndecreased by 16 per cent.\r\nIt is clear that progress has been made in ensuring\r\nfood security, which is among the key priorities in\r\nTajikistan. The Government’s objectives include the\r\ndevelopment of agriculture and the creation within it of\r\na viable private sector, and, at a minimum, a threefold\r\nincrease in the income of rural households.\r\nWe fully agree with the conclusions reached in\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals Needs Assessment\r\nreport submitted to the Secretary-General by a team of\r\nexperts led by Jeffrey Sachs, which state that Tajikistan\r\nhas a unique opportunity to achieve the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, in the context of their major\r\nparameters, by 2015. Successful achievement of the\r\nenvisaged targets will allow Tajikistan to become, in\r\nCentral Asia, an example of an emerging democracy\r\ncharacterized by equality and prosperity.\r\nTajikistan is currently at a turning point in its\r\ndevelopment. The armed conflict was resolved within a\r\nshort period of time, and the complex peacebuilding\r\nphase, which is being successfully implemented with\r\nUnited Nations support, is approaching its conclusion.\r\nOver the last five years, with the involvement of the\r\nUnited Nations Office in Tajikistan, the country has\r\nsuccessfully travelled the difficult road of national\r\nreconciliation, enhancing its stability, establishing\r\ndemocratic institutions, promoting the rule of law and\r\nensuring respect for human rights.\r\nStability and the implementation of first-\r\ngeneration reforms have brought about a speedy\r\nincrease in gross domestic product, with an annual\r\nincrease of 9.3 per cent over the past five years. The\r\nrehabilitation of the country’s economy is progressing.\r\nAt the same time, the Republic’s authorities have a\r\nclear idea of the scale and complexity of the problems\r\nfacing the country and are fully aware of their\r\nresponsibilities in addressing social and economic\r\nproblems, and they are undertaking every possible\r\nmeasure for their resolution.\r\nTajikistan is one the first countries in the world to\r\nhave generated, with the assistance of the United\r\nNations, an estimate of the overall costs and resources\r\nrequired for the implementation of the MDGs. The\r\nMillennium Development Goals Needs Assessment\r\nidentified the fundamental structural and institutional\r\nreforms needed in Tajikistan to create an enabling\r\nenvironment for achieving the MDGs; policy priorities\r\nin respective sectors; and financial schemes for funding\r\nthe development of rural areas, the educational and\r\nhealth systems, the water supply and sanitation\r\ninfrastructures, and the environment.\r\nAccording to The Millennium Development\r\nGoals Needs Assessment, Tajikistan will need about\r\n$13 billion over the next 10 years to achieve the\r\nrequired progress in the implementation of the MDGs.\r\nHowever, the Millennium Development Goals\r\nNeeds Assessment is only the first concrete measure.\r\nBased on that document, a National Strategy for\r\nDevelopment for 2006-2008 and a more detailed\r\n24\r\nA/60/PV.15\r\nStrategy for Poverty Reduction for 2006-2008 are\r\ncurrently being elaborated in Tajikistan. These\r\nmeasures, undertaken by the Government of Tajikistan,\r\nfully accord with the decisions of the summit on the\r\nelaboration of national strategies for development.\r\nTajikistan’s social and economic development\r\nwill depend largely on the international community’s\r\napproach to addressing existing challenges, including\r\npoverty eradication; development financing; the\r\ncreation of an equitable system of world trade; the\r\nalleviation of the consequences of natural disasters;\r\nand the resolution of demographic problems. That is\r\nwhy the summit’s decisions on such a crucial issue as\r\ndevelopment financing are of pivotal importance for\r\nTajikistan.\r\nAllow me briefly to touch on some key issues.\r\nI turn first to needs related to official assistance\r\nfor development. In cooperation with United Nations\r\nexperts, we assessed our needs in this area in a detailed\r\nand transparent manner. Currently, our financial\r\nrequirements for sustainable development considerably\r\nexceed the available federal and external resources. Of\r\nthe $930 million that international donors have\r\ncommitted to allocate to Tajikistan during the period\r\n2003-2005, only 40 per cent has actually been\r\nprovided. We call on the international community to\r\ndouble, at a minimum, existing aid for the\r\nimplementation of the MDGs.\r\nReducing the burden of foreign debt is of special\r\nimportance for us, since the funds released can be\r\ninvested in development. Due to the efforts undertaken\r\nby the Government to reduce the burden of servicing\r\nforeign debt, some progress has been achieved in the\r\nrestructuring of bilateral debts in recent years.\r\nHowever, in the near future, the debt burden will\r\nremain heavy. According to estimates, this year debt\r\nwill equal more than 40 per cent of gross domestic\r\nproduct, and it will continue to pose a threat to the\r\nmacro-economic stability of the country and to plans\r\nfor development.\r\nThe economy and trade in Tajikistan depend to a\r\nlarge extent on favourable conditions in the world\r\nmarket. Tajikistan hopes for the successful completion\r\nof the Doha round of trade negotiations within the\r\nWorld Trade Organization, in order that it may fully\r\nrealize its potential in the field of development and so\r\nthat progress can be made towards an open and\r\nequitable system of world trade.\r\nLack of access to the sea and remoteness from\r\nworld markets significantly increase transit\r\ntransportation expenditures, make it harder for the\r\ncountry to participate in world trade and directly affect\r\nthe poverty rate in the country. In that context, the\r\npromotion of regional cooperation, primarily with\r\nneighbouring countries, is a key factor for the\r\nachievement of the MDGs in Tajikistan.\r\nOur region faces specific problems, given that the\r\nestablishment of an environment conducive to\r\ndeveloping trade relations and the promotion of\r\neconomic relations as a whole depends, in many\r\nrespects, on the success of the stabilization and\r\npeacebuilding processes in neighbouring Afghanistan.\r\nWith respect to the country’s post-conflict\r\nrehabilitation, it is clear that, at the regional level,\r\nactive involvement by the States of Central Asia\r\nneighbouring Afghanistan in its development will be\r\nkey to the success of the efforts undertaken there.\r\nIn this connection, Tajikistan believes that it is\r\nabsolutely essential that Afghanistan share in the\r\nmultifaceted process of regional cooperation. We\r\nexpect our region’s leading international partners to\r\nprovide appropriate support for that process. Indeed,\r\nthat issue could be considered by the new United\r\nNations Peacebuilding Commission.\r\nAlthough we rely on international assistance, the\r\nGovernment of Tajikistan is making increased efforts\r\nto utilize the country’s own capacity to the fullest\r\nextent. Tajikistan’s water resources offer enormous\r\nadvantages in terms of the implementation of the\r\nMDGs. Unfortunately, less than 5 per cent of their\r\npotential is currently being exploited.\r\nRational and fair management of water resources\r\nwill contribute directly to progress towards the MDGs\r\nby helping to address challenges related to, inter alia,\r\nfood security, employment, sanitation, the reduction of\r\ndisease and increased school attendance. Our common\r\ngoal is to develop a qualitatively new pattern of\r\nsustainable water resource management and to address\r\nwater economy challenges at the national, regional and\r\ninternational levels by bringing together international\r\ncommunity support and national efforts, while ensuring\r\nthat the countries themselves and even subregions\r\nfacing water supply problems play the leading role.\r\nWe expect all countries and all of the specialized\r\nagencies of the United Nations to take an active part in\r\nevents relating to the International Decade for Action\r\n25\r\nA/60/PV.15\r\n“Water for Life”, the success of which will depend on\r\njoint activities being undertaken. That should make a\r\ncommon, tangible contribution to the future of\r\nhumankind.\r\nAs a country that has lived through civil conflict,\r\nTajikistan considers progress in the implementation of\r\nthe MDGs to be of special significance. The successful\r\nsocial and economic development of the country is the\r\nkey to preventing a recurrence of such conflict. Our\r\nexperience teaches us that creating conditions that can\r\nprevent the resumption of conflict and strengthen the\r\nprocess of advancing social and economic development\r\nin countries that have lived through such conflict must\r\nbe among the key goals of the international\r\ncommunity. In this connection, we fully share the\r\nconviction that the United Nations must focus on\r\novercoming and preventing conflict and on post-\r\nconflict rehabilitation and development. We hope that\r\nthe new United Nations Peacebuilding Commission\r\nwill expand the capacity of the international\r\ncommunity to respond to the needs of post-conflict\r\ncountries and allow a direct link to be made between\r\nsecurity and development. The Economic and Social\r\nCouncil is called upon to play its role in that process.\r\nTajikistan, which suffered in its struggle for\r\nindependence, has resolutely set out on the democratic\r\nroad towards development, and will not turn back. The\r\ninternational community, first and foremost the United\r\nNations, has made an enormous contribution in that\r\nregard, and for many years we have benefited from its\r\ngenerous assistance and selfless support.\r\nWe are convinced that the United Nations should\r\nremain the key body for regulating international\r\nrelations in the new millennium. We are working on\r\nthe assumption that the consolidating function of the\r\nUnited Nations should be enhanced. The reform of the\r\nOrganization should be rational, and the renewed\r\nUnited Nations itself should be strong and capable of\r\nresponding to world events in a swift and proper\r\nmanner so that it can effectively counteract the many\r\nglobal challenges and threats of a new generation.\r\nTajikistan will make its own contribution in that area\r\nwith a view to strengthening the United Nations and\r\nenhancing its role in the modern world.\r\nThe President: I give the floor to His Excellency\r\nMr. Jorge Briz Abularach, Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\nof Guatemala.\r\nMr. Briz Abularach (Guatemala) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): As a founding Member of the United\r\nNations, Guatemala would like to reaffirm, before the\r\nGeneral Assembly, its faith in and commitment to\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms, the sovereign\r\nequality of States and participatory, transparent and\r\ndemocratic multilateralism. The United Nations\r\ncontinues to be the best tool available to humanity in\r\nits endeavour to accomplish that goal.\r\nThe goals that the Charter signatories set for\r\nthemselves six decades ago have lost none of their\r\nvalidity. Indeed, the attainment of those goals remains\r\na major challenge for humanity. The goal of\r\nmaintaining international peace and security presents\r\nnew challenges. Its relationship with sustainable\r\ndevelopment and the fight against poverty serves as a\r\nparadigm in that regard. We are confronting new\r\nthreats that make it harder to ensure good governance\r\nand undermine democracy, such as trafficking in\r\npersons, weapons and drugs, as well as terrorism.\r\nSmall and vulnerable countries, such as mine, are\r\nparticularly affected by those problems.\r\nWe have been trying together to cope with such\r\nnew challenges for some time, but only recently have\r\nwe been able to reflect on them and reach a number of\r\nagreements that we trust will enable us to reform the\r\nOrganization with a view to address these challenges,\r\nas a whole, more efficiently and with renewed\r\nambition.\r\nWe support the appeal made by Secretary-General\r\nat the beginning of the general debate for an\r\n“accountability pact” to ensure that the Secretariat and\r\nGovernments are effectively held to account and\r\nmonitored.\r\nGuatemala will continue to participate actively in\r\nefforts to set up the Peacebuilding Commission. Our\r\nown national experience will enable us to contribute\r\nactively to those efforts.\r\nWe will also contribute to the effort to achieve\r\nthe speedy conclusion of a comprehensive convention\r\nagainst international terrorism and to the\r\nimplementation of an integral strategy aimed at the\r\nsuppression of that scourge.\r\nWe attach equal importance to the creation of a\r\nstanding Human Rights Council, the composition of\r\nwhich is to be agreed upon during this session, with a\r\nview to properly focusing, depoliticizing and making\r\n26\r\nA/60/PV.15\r\nmore effective the discharge of our responsibility to\r\nensure the full observance of human rights. We\r\nresolutely support the strengthening of the Office of\r\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Human\r\nRights, which should be provided with the resources\r\nnecessary for it to carry out its work effectively.\r\nSimilarly, we have no hesitation in supporting the\r\nresponsibility to protect.\r\nWe consider it essential to make decisive\r\nprogress in the areas of disarmament and nuclear non-\r\nproliferation by means of initiatives such as that put\r\nforward by Norway, Australia, Chile, Indonesia, the\r\nUnited Kingdom, Romania and South Africa, which\r\nGuatemala supports.\r\nAs regards the principal organs, we support the\r\nstrengthening and revitalization of the General\r\nAssembly, whose task is to provide political guidance\r\nin connection with the work of the Organization. We\r\nmust restore to the Economic and Social Council its\r\nleading role in the area of sustainable development,\r\nand continue to enhance its cooperation with the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nWe urge the broadest support by Member States\r\nfor the reform of the Security Council. It is essential\r\nthat that reform effort be comprehensive and that it\r\ninclude a review of the Council’s methods of work and\r\nof the procedures by which decisions are taken, the\r\npurpose being to strengthen the Council and to make it\r\nmore legitimate, ensuring that it reflects present-day\r\nrealities and represents developing countries. We are\r\nsympathetic to the aspirations of Brazil, Germany,\r\nIndia and Japan to become permanent members of the\r\nCouncil, as well as to the call for additional\r\nrepresentation for Africa.\r\nWhen addressing the Assembly one year ago,\r\nOscar Berger Perdomo, the President of Guatemala,\r\nsought to express the feelings of our country at that\r\ncrucial time in its history. I am pleased on this occasion\r\nto share with the Assembly some of the advances we\r\nhave made since then.\r\nNot only were the Peace Agreements integrated\r\ninto the Government plan, but the framework law on\r\nthose Agreements was enacted. Social dialogue has\r\nbeen pursued in all areas of Government action. A 43\r\nper cent reduction in the strength of the army was\r\nachieved, and there was progress in modernizing and\r\nprofessionalizing it. In line with this, the Guatemalan\r\narmy has increased its participation in United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations and is now in Haiti and the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nPublic expenditure is concentrated in the social\r\narea and in infrastructure, for which 60 per cent of the\r\n2006 national budget is earmarked. A secretariat for\r\nfood and nutritional security has been created, while a\r\nState policy in those matters has been drawn up, with a\r\nparticipatory and sustainable focus. Significant\r\nactivities are being carried out at the national level and\r\njointly with other Central American countries to\r\ncombat common crime and transnational organized crime.\r\nA programme for economic and social reactivation\r\ncontinues to be implemented with enthusiasm, a\r\ncadastral law was recently enacted and a competition\r\npolicy, adopted by consensus with the participation of\r\ncivil society, will be presented next week.\r\nThe fight against poverty and social exclusion\r\ncontinues to occupy a central position in all the\r\nactivities of the Government and is carried out in a\r\nmanner that fully respects the ethnic, cultural and\r\nlinguistic diversity of the country. Recently, we\r\nestablished a national policy for indigenous peoples,\r\nwhich was presented by the Nobel Peace Prize laureate\r\nand Ambassador for the Guatemalan Peace\r\nAgreements, Rigoberta Menchu.\r\nAppropriate legal proceedings continue to be\r\ntaken against persons guilty of acts of corruption. Full\r\ntransparency continues to be ensured in the area of\r\nGovernment procurement.\r\nOur commitment to the full observance of human\r\nrights is being maintained at the national level. Inter-\r\nagency activities are being carried out under the\r\nrecently adopted national human rights programme.\r\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Human\r\nRights has established an office in Guatemala, the\r\nfunctions of which are to provide advice to the\r\nGovernment, State entities and civil society in order to\r\nstrengthen the promotion and protection of human\r\nrights in our nation.\r\nNevertheless, the advances made are increasingly\r\nbeing compromised by an inordinate increase in the\r\nprice of fossil fuels, which has an extremely negative\r\neffect on countries whose open economies, like that of\r\nGuatemala, are net importers of oil. Our oil bill is\r\nabsorbing an increasing percentage of the foreign\r\nexchange generated by exports of goods and services.\r\nAt the same time, we have had to cope with\r\nconsiderable increases in the cost of transportation and\r\n27\r\nA/60/PV.15\r\nof electricity, with their multiplier effect on productive\r\nsectors and the price of basic consumer goods. The\r\neffects of all this at the level of the economy as a\r\nwhole and at the macroeconomic level threaten to slow\r\ndown the expansion of our economy. For our part, we\r\nare doing all we can to conserve energy and develop\r\nalternatives to hydrocarbons. We appeal to the\r\ninternational community to cooperate with us in\r\nmitigating the impact of this situation.\r\nGuatemala is taking actions to strengthen\r\ndemocracy at the national level by consolidating a\r\nregime that is democratic, participatory and inclusive.\r\nOur commitment to democracy in the world is\r\nunshakeable. That is why we are participating actively\r\nin forums that seek to promote and defend those rights,\r\nand we also support the Democracy Fund.\r\nMy country’s foreign policy has as its main\r\nobjectives achieving better inclusion of Guatemala in\r\nthe world, strengthening multilateralism and regional\r\nintegration. We have strengthened our ties with\r\ncountries and groups of countries with which we have\r\nrelations and are united by institutionalized\r\nmechanisms of cooperation; moreover, we have\r\nestablished new strategic associations with countries\r\nand groups of countries in South America, the\r\nCaribbean, Asia and Africa.\r\nConsiderable advances have been made this year\r\nin regional integration. Progress has been made in the\r\njoint assessment carried out with the European Union\r\nto launch negotiations in 2006 for an association and\r\nfree trade agreement between both regions.\r\nThe Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) with\r\nthe United States, which includes the Central American\r\ncountries and the Dominican Republic, offers great\r\nopportunities to our country for the generation of\r\nemployment, increased investment and legal certainty.\r\nHowever, as we enter CAFTA-DR, the credit rating and\r\nexport promotion agencies of the developed countries\r\nhave assigned us a risk rating less favourable than what\r\nwe consider it should be. Along with other\r\nconsequences, that situation unfairly increases the cost\r\nof credit for us. Guatemala has one of the best debt-\r\nservicing records in Latin America, one of the world’s\r\nbest external debt indicators, well-established working\r\nrelations with all multilateral agencies, sustained\r\neconomic growth for more than 15 years, a stable\r\ncurrency, a single-digit rate of inflation and a high\r\nlevel of monetary reserves.\r\nStrategically, Guatemala has advanced in the\r\nnegotiation of trade agreements with Colombia, the\r\nRepublic of China in Taiwan, the Russian Federation,\r\nBelize, MERCOSUR, CARICOM, the Andean Group,\r\nChile, Canada, Egypt and Israel.\r\nAnother fundamental pillar of Guatemala’s\r\nforeign policy is caring for the needs of Guatemalan\r\nmigrants. The Government endeavours to solve their\r\nproblems and to ensure that their human rights are\r\nrespected, taking actions for that purpose at the\r\nnational and international levels. We appeal to\r\nrecipient nations, particularly the United States, to\r\nfacilitate the regulation of the status of Guatemalan\r\nmigrants in their countries. For those reasons, we\r\ncontinue to cooperate at the international level with all\r\nefforts aimed at resolving the problems that migrants\r\nface. We welcome the recognition contained in the\r\n2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1) on the\r\nlink between international migration and development.\r\nGuatemala will continue to take the necessary\r\nsteps to put an end to poverty in the country and to\r\nattain sustainable development. Prioritization of public\r\nexpenditure at the national level is not sufficient for the\r\nmagnitude of the actions we are setting out to\r\naccomplish. We consider it imperative to ensure the\r\nsuccess of the Sixth Ministerial Conference of the\r\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO). By definition, the\r\nDoha Round should place development at the heart of\r\nits negotiations, and we trust that, when we meet in\r\nHong Kong in December, we shall take decisions that\r\nby and large are consistent with the aspirations of\r\ndeveloping countries. We need to have a level playing\r\nfield in trade and agricultural commodities, and we\r\nneed wider access to the markets of the most dynamic\r\neconomies in the world for our goods and services, as\r\nwell as to expand and diversify our product base.\r\nWe welcome the offer made by President Bush in\r\nthis Hall to speed up the elimination of all tariffs and\r\nsubsidies that distort free trade in the world. We urge\r\ndonor countries, development agencies and the\r\ninternational financial system to increase their\r\nfinancial and technical cooperation with medium and\r\nlow-income countries, with a moderate debt level, one\r\nof which is my country, Guatemala.\r\nI wish to stress in particular our concern for the\r\nsituation of the 23 million inhabitants of the Republic\r\nof China in Taiwan, whose aspirations for\r\nrepresentation in international organizations remain\r\n28\r\nA/60/PV.15\r\nunfulfilled. Guatemala, which is committed to the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security as well\r\nas to the peaceful settlement of disputes, appeals to the\r\ncountries bordering the Taiwan Strait to refrain from\r\nany threat or use of force and urges them to resolve\r\ntheir differences through dialogue.\r\nWe also express our hope that the difficult\r\nsituation in the Middle East will have a satisfactory\r\noutcome, in conformity with Security Council resolutions\r\n242 (1967), 338 (1973), 1397 (2002) and 1402 (2002).\r\nWe are heartened in that regard by the efforts and\r\nprogress made in the Middle East peace process, and\r\nparticularly by the dialogue begun between the parties,\r\nthe implementation of the road map, and the\r\nimplementation of the disengagement plan.\r\nOne cannot avoid recalling here, during this\r\nanniversary of our Organization, the millions of\r\npersons who perished during the Second World War\r\nand the Holocaust as a result of the power of\r\ntotalitarianism. Our presence here also recalls us to the\r\nstruggle to recover democracy, freedom and the dignity\r\nof the human being.\r\nHope was born from the liberation of men,\r\nwomen, boys and girls from the concentration camps,\r\nthe end of the war and the adoption of the Charter in\r\nSan Francisco. We cannot disappoint those hopes or\r\nreturn to the past. The United Nations must deliver on\r\nits promises and continue to offer humanity an\r\nopportunity.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Zarifou Ayeva, Minister of State,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and African Integration of\r\nTogo.\r\nMr. Ayeva (Togo) (spoke in French): At the\r\noutset, allow me, on behalf of the people and\r\nGovernment of Togo and on my own behalf, to extend\r\nour warmest congratulations to you, Sir, on your\r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at\r\nits sixtieth session. I also assure you of the support and\r\ncooperation of the Togolese delegation, confident as I\r\nam that your experience and outstanding qualities will\r\nprove to be a major asset in ensuring that our work at\r\nthis session will be commensurate with the great stakes\r\nand global challenges that we must meet together.\r\nI also convey to your predecessor, Mr. Jean Ping,\r\nour deep appreciation for the immense work he\r\nundertook with marvellous enthusiasm throughout his\r\nmandate. With commitment and insight, the qualities of\r\na seasoned diplomat in service to his country, Gabon,\r\nand to Africa, he effectively guided the work of the\r\npreceding session, including the debates held in recent\r\ndays on the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nI also take this opportunity to pay vibrant tribute\r\nto the Secretary-General, our brother Kofi Annan,\r\nwhose commitment to the United Nations and to the\r\ngreat causes and noble ideals it embodies has allowed\r\nus to register critical progress in improving the quality\r\nand effectiveness of the United Nations operations. I\r\npledge him my country’s full support in the ongoing\r\nmission we have entrusted to him, which he has carried\r\nout with competence, serenity, resolve and humanism.\r\nThe United Nations is now at a crossroads. The\r\nchallenges that continue to face the world — in\r\nparticular the ongoing conflicts that are ravaging many\r\ncountries and regions around the world; the pandemics,\r\nfloods and natural disasters; the terrible dangers that\r\nthreaten the environment and the ecosystem; famine in\r\nvarious places, particularly in Africa, caused by\r\ndrought and climate change; and the growing gulf\r\nbetween the wealthy countries and those afflicted by\r\nunderdevelopment — require greater solidarity, the\r\nurgent reform of our Organization, and the adaptation\r\nof its bodies and operations to the new international\r\ncontext.\r\nMy country, Togo, will therefore firmly support\r\nthe United Nations reform process, as outlined in the\r\nreport of the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges\r\nand Change, entitled “A more secure world: our shared\r\nresponsibility” (A/59/565). Indeed, we absolutely must\r\nreaffirm certain fundamental principles and ideals that\r\nguided the founding fathers of the United Nations. We\r\nmust devise strategies and working methods that are\r\nbolder and better adapted to the scope and seriousness\r\nof problems that cannot be effectively resolved except\r\nin the framework of this Organization, a symbol of\r\nsolidarity and brotherhood among States and peoples.\r\nWe need to pursue and step up our fight against\r\npoverty and hunger, the lack of education, gender\r\ninequality, child mortality, disease, environmental\r\ndegradation, and devastating and lethal conflicts.\r\nI take this opportunity, on behalf of the\r\nGovernment and people of Togo, to convey our deep\r\ngratitude and thanks to the community of States\r\nrepresented here for its many expressions of support\r\nand sympathy for our country after the unexpected\r\n29\r\nA/60/PV.15\r\ndemise of President Gnassingbé Eyadema and in the\r\ncontext of Togo’s difficulties in the wake of his death.\r\nVery fortunately, Togo has emerged from that\r\nperiod of unrest and instability. Calm and serenity now\r\nreign and promise a new era of hope for our country. In\r\nfact, in spite of the tension and violence that marked\r\nthe electoral process, Togo has continued since then to\r\nmake tangible progress in peacefully reorganizing its\r\nsocial and political life. The representatives of all\r\npolitical persuasions and civil society have together\r\nestablished a Government of national unity. Moreover,\r\nin accordance with our desire for openness and\r\ndialogue, we have launched consultations with the\r\nTogolese political class and civil society in order to\r\nreach a broad consensus and mobilization in managing\r\nthe process of national reconciliation and in efforts to\r\nensure the return and reintegration of refugees. The\r\nconsultations also mark the onset of a political\r\ndialogue that will allow us, through joint effort, to\r\nagree on electoral reform, the reorganization of\r\nregulatory bodies and institutions, and the stages and\r\nschedule of legislative elections.\r\nSafeguarding human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms, enshrining the values and practices of\r\ndemocracy, and strengthening the rule of law and good\r\ngovernance are at the heart of the 22 commitments that\r\nmy country approved on 14 April 2004 with the\r\nEuropean Union. They are also at the very core of our\r\naction and of the demands and expectations of my\r\nfellow citizens. Immediately following the\r\nestablishment of the Government, we therefore adopted\r\nbold measures and initiatives in various sectors.\r\nA special independent national commission of\r\ninquiry was created to investigate the violence and\r\nvandalism committed during the electoral process.\r\nSimilarly, Togolese authorities at all levels have fully\r\ncooperated with the United Nations fact-find mission\r\nmandated to look into the violence and allegations of\r\nhuman rights violations committed between 5 February\r\nand 5 May 2005. The mission’s conclusions and\r\nrecommendations, which I believe will be useful and\r\npromising, will be considered in a spirit of open-\r\nmindedness and with a view to correcting potential\r\nareas of weakness so that we may never again\r\nexperience acts of violence in future elections in Togo.\r\nIn an effort to restore calm and reduce tension, all\r\npersons detained for their suspected involvement and\r\nresponsibility in acts of violence, atrocities, pillaging\r\nof property and ransacking of buildings during the\r\nelections have been released. Also, with a view to\r\nstrengthening citizens’ confidence in the Republic’s\r\ninstitutions, we have just launched a wide-ranging\r\nprogramme to reform the justice system.\r\nToday, we reaffirm that democracy spurs the\r\nharmonious and sustainable socio-economic\r\ndevelopment of Togo. In that respect, effectiveness and\r\ntransparency in the management of the affairs of the\r\ncapital and respect for human rights are important\r\nresponsibilities of the Government of Togo.\r\nHowever, it is clear that the young democracy of\r\nTogo needs the international community’s support in\r\norder to help democracy to take firm root and to\r\nstrengthen peace and stability in West Africa. I take\r\nthis opportunity to express once again the gratitude of\r\nthe people of Togo to the African Union and the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States for their\r\nassistance to Togo during such a crucial period.\r\nBuilding a State where the rule of law prevails is\r\na long-term effort; it is achieved gradually and requires\r\nconsolidation at each step. That is true for all great\r\ndemocracies. I therefore call on all our development\r\npartners to support Togo in its steadfast and\r\nirreversible march towards a democratic, law-based\r\nState in which all Togolese can fully exercise their\r\nfundamental rights and can act, think and create in\r\ncomplete freedom.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to underline once\r\nagain the merits of international solidarity, in particular\r\nbetween the prosperous countries and the developing\r\ncountries. In fact, we live in an increasingly\r\ninterdependent world that faces multiple threats and\r\nchallenges. Those threats spare no State, large or small,\r\nand make it imperative that we take coordinated and\r\nunited action, in particular in those situations that\r\njeopardize international peace and security.\r\nAfrica, in particular, remains a zone of conflicts\r\nand instability, and this exacerbates the feelings of\r\nhelplessness and distress among our peoples. We\r\nwelcome the engagement and the support of the\r\ninternational community, in particular in Côte d’Ivoire,\r\nthe Horn of Africa and the Great Lakes region.\r\nWe welcome encouraging signs in the peace\r\nprocess in Burundi. However, we call on the United\r\nNations and the international community to remain\r\nvigilant and active in helping the brotherly people of\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, whose country\r\n30\r\nA/60/PV.15\r\nis moving towards stability and the completion of its\r\nelectoral process.\r\nCôte d’Ivoire must quickly return to the path of\r\npeace and harmony in order to pursue a leading role in\r\nthe efforts for political and economic integration in\r\nWest Africa.\r\nBut we believe that it would be wise to take\r\ntimely action to address the causes of those conflicts,\r\nrather than intervene at a later date to deal with the\r\noften devastating consequences. We should therefore\r\nreflect together on how to address the root causes of\r\nthose situations.\r\nThat leads me to make two suggestions for the\r\nAssembly to ponder.\r\nFirst, regarding institutions, Africa must put in\r\nplace democratic institutions of a new kind, founded on\r\nthe value of dialogue and the ongoing search for\r\ncompromise and consensus, closer to our tradition of\r\ndiscussion than to the imposition of the majority\r\ndecision.\r\nSecond, we need to strengthen the management\r\ncapabilities of States whose administration is still weak\r\nin order to improve the quality and the effectiveness of\r\nthe public and administrative services, thus putting the\r\nState at the service of its citizens.\r\nI hope that our Organization will strengthen its\r\naction to make national administrations more effective\r\nand more accessible for citizens. By doing so, the\r\nUnited Nations would further realize its vocation as an\r\nirreplaceable forum for dialogue and solidarity in the\r\nservice of humanity, the well-being of peoples and the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.\r\n"
