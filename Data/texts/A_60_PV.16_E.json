(Sweden)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nItem 9 of the provisional agenda (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: Before calling on the first\r\nspeaker, I wish to thank the Government of Iceland for\r\nthe gift of this beautiful gavel, made from the wood of\r\na pear tree.\r\nI call on Her Excellency Ms. Ursula Plassnik,\r\nFederal Minister for Foreign Affairs of Austria.\r\nMs. Plassnik (Austria): We Austrians unfailingly\r\nkeep the United Nations in high esteem. Let me try to\r\nexplain why.\r\nAustria became a Member of the United Nations\r\nin December 1955. That was only half a year after our\r\nfull sovereignty had been restored through a treaty\r\nconcluded with the United States, the Soviet Union, the\r\nUnited Kingdom and France, called the Austrian State\r\nTreaty.\r\nFifty years ago, becoming part of the family of\r\nnations was a powerful motive for us. We could build\r\non your trust. We could rely on your help. We later\r\nsolved complex problems such as the question of\r\nSüdtirol with you, our partners in the United Nations.\r\nAnd we have since been eager to return to others in\r\nneed the help extended to us.\r\nMore than anything else, it is our own experience\r\nthat nurtures our confidence in the potential of the\r\nUnited Nations as a promoter of peace and a beacon of\r\nhope for so many who face the dire challenges and\r\nthreats to our societies — be they armed conflict or\r\nhunger, terrorism or environmental disaster. We need\r\nthe United Nations to be relevant, responsive and\r\nreliable — today and in the years to come.\r\nMr. Win (Myanmar), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe reform process initiated by Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan and reflected in the World Summit\r\nOutcome document will further enhance that potential.\r\nWe may not have achieved all we were striving for, but\r\nlet us not disregard the progress made, for it will — if\r\nacted upon — make a difference to people in need of\r\nour support, in need of our protection.\r\nPromoting peace is the United Nations very\r\nraison d’être. Since Austria joined the United Nations,\r\nsome 54,000 Austrian peacekeepers have participated\r\nin more than 50 missions all over the world. Currently,\r\n1,200 of them are deployed in missions from Kosovo\r\nto the Golan Heights and from Afghanistan to Aceh\r\nand the Sudan.\r\nIt is also in the light of their practical experience\r\nthat we welcome the new peacebuilding commission. It\r\nwill provide specific support to people having to cope\r\nwith the manifold challenges along the path from war\r\nto real peace. I wish to say one word on women in that\r\ncontext. Creating confidence in post-conflict societies\r\nrequires the active participation and deliberate\r\ninvolvement of women. They must become key\r\npartners in our peacekeeping and peacebuilding efforts.\r\n2\r\nA/60/PV.16\r\nThe European Union, as the major donor to post-conflict\r\nreconstruction and development, will substantially\r\ncontribute to the peacebuilding commission’s work. It\r\nshould therefore have a place in the commission.\r\nFor us and many people all over the world, the\r\nmost serious failure of the present reform effort was\r\nthe lack of agreement on effective and verifiable\r\nmeasures against nuclear proliferation and for\r\ndisarmament. We must strengthen the multilateral\r\nverification mechanisms and enable the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency to make best use of its\r\ncapacity. We must not abandon our efforts to find\r\ncommon ground on those most challenging tasks.\r\nIn this vulnerable world, we need to foster trust\r\nbetween communities and peoples and help to identify\r\nshared values. Austria thus strongly supports every\r\nform of dialogue among civilizations, religions and\r\ncultures. In particular, we need to reach out to the\r\nIslamic world, both internationally and inside our\r\nsocieties. As a concrete contribution, Austria will host\r\nan international conference in November on Islam in a\r\npluralistic world.\r\nAnywhere in the world, individuals will be able\r\nto live and unfold in larger freedom only when their\r\nfundamental needs of development, security and\r\nhuman rights are met. We need to address those\r\nrequirements in a comprehensive and integrated manner.\r\nWe are grateful to Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who\r\nso remarkably raised awareness on that matter.\r\nThe Millennium Development Goals contain\r\nspecific promises of solidarity. Austria therefore\r\nwelcomes our continued common commitments, in\r\nparticular to poverty eradication and the global\r\npartnership for sustainable development. In\r\ncontributing to the funding effort, we will raise our\r\nofficial development assistance to 0.51 per cent of our\r\ngross national income by 2010.\r\nPromoting human security is an ever more\r\ndemanding task. Our decisions on the “responsibility to\r\nprotect” are a courageous step forward in international\r\nrelations, but more importantly, they are an offer of\r\nhope to those most vulnerable to genocide, war crimes,\r\nethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. We must\r\nnot let them down. In the words of Simon Wiesenthal,\r\nwho sadly passed away last night in Vienna, what\r\nconnects 2,000 years of genocide is “too much power\r\nin too few hands”. Ten years ago, at this Assembly,\r\nSimon Wiesenthal proposed to organize a worldwide\r\nconference aimed at reducing hate. He said that\r\n“technology without hatred can be so beneficial for\r\nmankind, but in conjunction with hatred it leads to\r\ndisaster” (A/50/PV.66, p. 9). Reality has since\r\nillustrated the profound relevance of that proposal.\r\nIn our globalized world, the concept of\r\nneighbourhood has taken on a new meaning. In the eye\r\nof disaster, we are all neighbours, no matter how far or\r\nclose. As the tsunami and recent hurricanes have taught\r\nus, there is an emerging sense of shared destiny and\r\nresponsibility no longer limited to geographical\r\nvicinity. Let me on this occasion express our gratitude\r\nto all those private donors who set a mark of living\r\nsolidarity.\r\nAustria’s clear commitment to effective\r\nmultilateralism is at the very heart of our work in the\r\nEuropean Union and the United Nations. It is in that\r\nspirit that we are a candidate for Security Council\r\nmembership in 2009-2010.\r\nPromoting the rule of law is the key to an\r\nenvironment of trust within our societies. It enables\r\nindividuals to enjoy a self-determined life. For many,\r\nthe rule of law is synonymous with normality and\r\npredictability in their private and professional lives.\r\nWe therefore welcome the proposed establishment of a\r\nrule of law assistance unit in the Secretariat to advise\r\nStates in their efforts towards the rule of law.\r\nOne of the main achievements of the summit was\r\nthe decision to establish a human rights council, even if\r\nthe concrete set-up remains to be defined. In our view,\r\nwe need a standing body with the ability to address\r\nurgent human rights issues swiftly and efficiently. That\r\nis no mere management question. What is at stake is\r\nthe new Council’s capacity to make a difference for\r\nthose in need. It is now crucial that negotiations start\r\nwithout delay in order to seize the momentum of the\r\nreform.\r\nHuman rights are also a matter of education. In\r\nthe framework of the Human Security Network,\r\nAustria has therefore developed a human rights manual\r\nthat has been translated into all United Nations\r\nlanguages. It is used in training programmes in Austria\r\nand abroad and we encourage our partners to make use\r\nof that instrument.\r\nStrengthening human rights and the rule of law\r\nwill increase security. That is true for societies at large,\r\nbut it is also true for the smallest communities and\r\n3\r\nA/60/PV.16\r\nindividual households. Full respect for the rights of\r\nwomen and children is therefore indispensable in the\r\nworld of increased justice and equality we strive for.\r\nToo many women are victims of violence. We therefore\r\nwelcome the study currently being prepared by the\r\nSecretary-General on all forms of violence against\r\nwomen.\r\nMuch remains to be done. The Doha Development\r\nRound has to promote improved market access. In our\r\nefforts to protect the environment, we have to enhance\r\nthe use of renewable energy and reduce the emission of\r\ngreenhouse gases. We also need to finalize the\r\ncomprehensive anti-terrorism convention, as agreed at the\r\nworld summit, and adopt and implement the counter-\r\nterrorism strategy proposed by the Secretary-General.\r\nReal freedom is within reach if we, through the\r\nUnited Nations, join our forces to promote peace,\r\nsecurity and justice — not only freedom from want and\r\nfreedom from fear, but eventually freedom to live in\r\ndignity for both women and men across the globe.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Mohamed Benaissa, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and Cooperation of Morocco.\r\nMr. Benaissa (Morocco) (spoke in Arabic): I\r\nshould like to begin by congratulating Ambassador Jan\r\nEliasson, on behalf of the delegation of Morocco, on\r\nhis election to the presidency of the General Assembly\r\nat this historic session and by wishing him success in\r\nhis noble task. I should also like to express to his\r\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Jean Ping, Foreign\r\nMinister of the brotherly State of Gabon, our sincere\r\nthanks and profound appreciation for his efforts as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly during the fifty-\r\nninth session and for the patience and dedication that\r\nhe showed in his excellent conduct of the preparatory\r\nwork for the High-level Plenary Meeting, thereby\r\nensuring the success of the summit, which marked the\r\nsixtieth anniversary of our Organization.\r\nI should also like to pay tribute to the\r\nSecretary-General, Kofi Annan, for his commendable\r\nefforts to improve the structure of the Organization and\r\nenhance its working methods and effectiveness.\r\nLast week’s summit meeting was a key event in\r\nthe history of the United Nations and marked a turning\r\npoint in the Organization’s activities, not just because\r\nof the impressive number of very distinguished\r\nparticipants, but also because of the importance of the\r\noutcome document (resolution 60/1), which was\r\nadopted as a result of the contribution of all members.\r\nIn this regard, the Kingdom of Morocco supports\r\nthe proposals submitted by the Secretary-General with\r\na view to ensuring follow-up of the outcomes of the\r\nvarious international conferences on development\r\nissues. Although it failed to meet our expectations, the\r\nsummit outcome document nevertheless reiterated our\r\ninternational commitments; it paves the way for\r\nstrengthening the role and effectiveness of the\r\nOrganization and adapting it to meet the new\r\nchallenges posed by global developments.\r\nThe Kingdom of Morocco would like to reaffirm\r\nits readiness to contribute to the implementation of the\r\nrecommendations of the summit and to participate in\r\nthe international effort to achieve the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). My country has\r\nundertaken a number of proactive national initiatives\r\nrelating to ensuring respect for human rights and the\r\nestablishment of an integrated and modern society in\r\nwhich women play an active role in development.\r\nMany of these are set out in the National Initiative for\r\nHuman Development, announced by His Majesty King\r\nMohammed VI on 18 May. That initiative reflects\r\nMorocco’s willingness to create a development model\r\nbased on a successful association of modernity,\r\ndemocratization and economic openness. That model is\r\nalso aimed at achieving a sustained improvement in our\r\nhuman development index, within a spirit of collective\r\nparticipation, solidarity, equal opportunity, the\r\ndissemination of knowledge and the provision of basic\r\nsocial services.\r\nThe end of the era of ideological division and the\r\nrise of a new world order has called the attention of the\r\ninternational community to new challenges posed by\r\nthe scourges of terrorism, hunger, poverty,\r\nbackwardness, illiteracy and pandemic disease, as well\r\nas the increasing number of refugees fleeing from the\r\ndisasters of war and destruction and the growing\r\nnumber of ethnic, tribal and religious conflicts and\r\nseparatist trends.\r\nSince the events of 11 September 2001, the\r\ninternational community has grown increasingly aware\r\nof the threat of terrorism and of the need to combat it\r\nby all available means and to address its root causes\r\nand underlying motives.\r\nThe Kingdom of Morocco, which has itself been\r\nsubjected to the scourge of terrorism, has participated\r\n4\r\nA/60/PV.16\r\nin efforts to combat it through the elaboration of legal\r\ninstruments and practical arrangements at the national,\r\nregional and international levels. During this session,\r\nthe Kingdom of Morocco will continue to contribute to\r\nefforts to adopt a comprehensive convention against\r\nterrorism, thereby complementing its participation in\r\nthe elaboration of the International Convention for the\r\nSuppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism.\r\nAs for development challenges, our African\r\ncontinent is the only region that will not be able to\r\nachieve the MDGs within the specified time frame\r\nunless the international community provides full\r\nsupport. In this regard, African countries acknowledge\r\nthat they must rely, first and foremost, on their own\r\nhuman and material resources. However, Africa’s\r\neconomic take-off can be achieved only through an\r\nefficient and realistic partnership involving all the\r\nparties concerned, including donor countries and\r\ninternational and regional organizations. That\r\npartnership must be founded on an integrated and\r\nsustained process that benefits the existing North-\r\nSouth and South-South cooperation mechanisms.\r\nConvinced of the necessity to collectively combat\r\nthe ills that are besetting our African continent,\r\nMorocco has always taken the lead in supporting and\r\nencouraging any initiative aimed at freeing the African\r\npeoples from their stark predicament. Thus, on more\r\nthan one occasion, the Kingdom of Morocco has\r\nvoiced full support for the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development as an integrated and\r\ncomprehensive action plan designed to solve the\r\npersistent economic and social problems that have\r\nplagued our continent since the era of independence.\r\nOn the other hand, Morocco has always shown its\r\nreadiness to contribute to conflict resolution in Africa\r\nby bringing together belligerent parties and by\r\nstrengthening the ties of brotherhood and good\r\nneighbourliness among the States of western Africa, as\r\nwell as through the participation of the Royal Armed\r\nForces of Morocco in peacekeeping operations\r\nconducted under the auspices of the United Nations in\r\nAfrica.\r\nThe Kingdom of Morocco welcomes the decision\r\nby the Group of Eight to cancel the debt of least\r\ndeveloped African countries. I would also like to recall\r\nthat His Majesty King Mohammed VI was among the\r\nfirst to initiate such a move. During the first European\r\nUnion-Africa Summit, which was held in Cairo, His\r\nMajesty announced the cancellation of the debt of least\r\ndeveloped African countries, opened Morocco’s market\r\nto their products and granted them customs\r\nexemptions.\r\nThe success of Africa’s economic take-off\r\nremains contingent upon the success of regional\r\nintegration throughout the continent. The Kingdom of\r\nMorocco therefore believes that the reactivation of the\r\nMaghreb Arab Union is a political imperative, an\r\neconomic necessity and a historical reality that\r\nresponds to the aspirations of the peoples of the region\r\nand reflects the expectations of our partners, especially\r\nthose in the Mediterranean region, with whom we are\r\nstriving to reinforce our partnership as we prepare to\r\ncelebrate the tenth anniversary of the Barcelona\r\nprocess.\r\nFor those reasons, Morocco is working to\r\nreactivate the Union’s machinery and to remove any\r\nobstacles that might hinder its relaunching on a sound,\r\nconstructive and meaningful basis. In this context,\r\nMorocco would like to reaffirm its steadfast\r\ncommitment to working closely with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and his Personal Envoy and Special\r\nRepresentative, as well as with all parties concerned, in\r\norder to break the current stalemate and reach a\r\nnegotiated political solution to the artificial conflict\r\nwith respect to the Moroccan Sahara. Because of its\r\ngeostrategic nature, that conflict between two brotherly\r\nneighbouring countries, Morocco and Algeria, requires\r\nthe involvement of our brethren in Algeria in a serious\r\nand constructive dialogue with a view to putting an end\r\nto it once and for all.\r\nHis Majesty King Mohammed VI, in his most\r\nrecent Throne Day speech, affirmed Morocco’s\r\nwillingness “to engage in serious negotiations with a\r\nview to reaching a final solution that would win United\r\nNations support and grant the inhabitants of the\r\nsouthern provinces autonomy within the sovereignty of\r\nthe Kingdom and its territorial and national integrity”.\r\nPending the involvement of all parties in that\r\nnegotiation process, it remains urgent to follow up on\r\nthe humanitarian aspect of the problem by disclosing\r\nthe fate of all Moroccan missing persons and prisoners.\r\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross was\r\nunable to establish contacts with those persons or to\r\ndiscover their place of detention. In addition, the\r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees should be allowed to undertake a fair and\r\n5\r\nA/60/PV.16\r\nfree census of Moroccan citizens being held in the\r\nTindouf camps in Algeria, who should be freed and\r\nallowed to exercise their right to return to their\r\nhomeland.\r\nThe Arab region, which continues to experience\r\nrecurrent crises as well as new ones equally violent and\r\nfierce, looks to the Organization and to other\r\ninternational and regional actors for their assistance in\r\nsolving them. In that regard, we hope that the ray of\r\noptimism that shone recently in the Middle East,\r\nprompting us to engage in cautious optimism, will be\r\nsupported by serious and brave measures that will\r\nrevive the peace process and put it back on track. The\r\nKingdom of Morocco welcomed the withdrawal from\r\nthe Gaza Strip and considers it an important and\r\npositive decision on the path towards full\r\nimplementation of the road map.\r\nMorocco, which has always striven tirelessly and\r\neffectively to keep open the channels of\r\ncommunication and dialogue among the peoples of the\r\nMiddle East, reaffirms its active commitment to\r\npromoting a peaceful solution to the Arab-Israeli\r\nconflict that will lead to the establishment of a final,\r\nlasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East\r\nthrough the reactivation of the road map, the\r\nguaranteed establishment of a free Palestinian State\r\nwith Al-Quds as its capital, and the withdrawal of\r\nIsrael from the occupied Syrian and Lebanese\r\nterritories.\r\nHis Majesty King Mohammed VI, Chairman of\r\nthe Al-Quds Committee, has reaffirmed his resolve to\r\ncontinue to actively pursue and support all peace\r\nefforts and to work to preserve the Arab and Islamic\r\nidentity of Al-Quds Al-Sharif and its status as a place\r\nof coexistence and tolerance among the three revealed\r\nreligions.\r\nWith regard to the situation in the brotherly State\r\nof Iraq, the Kingdom of Morocco, although\r\nappreciating highly the continuous and intensive\r\nefforts to re-establish stability, peace and\r\nreconstruction in Iraq, and although following the\r\nrecent political progress with great interest, affirms\r\nthat the participation of all constituents of Iraqi society\r\nis needed to build the democratic institutions of the\r\nnew Iraqi State and to preserve its national unity.\r\nMoreover, the international community must help the\r\nIraqi people to overcome the ongoing crisis by creating\r\nthe conditions necessary for peace and stability.\r\nReforming the United Nations to enable it to meet\r\nthe challenges of the twenty-first century, restructuring\r\nits organs and bodies and updating their mandates will\r\nrequire not only that its working methods be improved,\r\nbut also that the Organization regain its natural and\r\nleading role as a framework for constructive dialogue\r\nand as a forum for creative interaction among the\r\nvarious intellectual currents and religious and cultural\r\ntrends.\r\nIn that context, Morocco commends the\r\nSecretary-General for his decision to appoint a High-\r\nlevel Group for the Alliance of Civilizations and to\r\nestablish a new cultural world order based on tolerance\r\nand coexistence. We support diversity and unity of\r\nvisions and goals as contributions to meeting the\r\nchallenges of the new millennium.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His\r\nExcellency Mr. David Oddsson, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs and External Trade of Iceland.\r\nMr. Oddsson (Iceland): I would like to join those\r\nwho have expressed thanks to the Secretary-General\r\nfor his efforts in recent years to address the very\r\nserious issues facing the international community.\r\nIceland had high expectations for the results of\r\nlast week’s summit, which were met only partly in its\r\noutcome document (resolution 60/1). Much further\r\nwork is needed. While most of the key values in the\r\nCharter were reaffirmed, it is Iceland’s view that\r\nhuman rights and the accountability of States to their\r\ncitizens were insufficiently dealt with.\r\nThe United Nations Charter guarantees equality\r\namong nations and provides a basis on which they can\r\nlive together as good neighbours. However, the Charter\r\nnot only addresses how relations should be conducted\r\namong Governments; it also specifies how\r\nGovernments should conduct themselves towards their\r\npeoples. That is what the Secretary-General has called\r\nthe accountability of States to their citizens.\r\nIceland supports the Secretary-General’s strong\r\nstatement on the responsibility borne by the\r\ninternational community in cases of massive human\r\nrights abuses or genocide. The United Nations has\r\nmade significant progress in that respect by recognizing\r\nthe existence of an international responsibility to protect.\r\nThe Security Council and other institutions have thus\r\nbeen given a clear mandate — indeed, a clear duty —\r\nto act where crimes against humanity are committed.\r\n6\r\nA/60/PV.16\r\nDemocracy and respect for universal human\r\nrights are of central importance to security and\r\ndevelopment. Iceland supports the establishment of the\r\nUnited Nations Democracy Fund and will contribute to\r\nit. We are also strongly in favour of reforming the\r\npresent human rights machinery. The Commission on\r\nHuman Rights is dysfunctional and devoid of\r\ncredibility; deliberations on human rights have suffered\r\naccordingly. Moreover, the credibility of the entire\r\nUnited Nations Organization is threatened. There now\r\nexists a summit mandate to establish a Human Rights\r\nCouncil, which will be responsible for promoting\r\nuniversal respect for the protection of all human rights\r\nand fundamental freedoms. For Iceland, the ideal\r\nHuman Rights Council would be smaller than the\r\nCommission and would be in session all year so that it\r\ncould respond to emergencies. The composition of the\r\nnew Council will be fundamental to its effectiveness. It\r\nmust not include major human rights abusers.\r\nAt the summit, Member States committed\r\nthemselves to making every possible effort to conclude\r\na comprehensive convention on international terrorism.\r\nSuch a convention must unconditionally condemn\r\nterrorism. If it is to be fully effective, it must include a\r\nlegal definition of terrorist acts.\r\nUnfortunately, the threat of terrorism, combined\r\nwith that of weapons of mass destruction, is not dealt\r\nwith in the outcome document, which fails to address\r\nthe proliferation of such weapons. Proliferation is a\r\nprofound danger which the United Nations cannot\r\nignore but must confront in a decisive manner.\r\nIceland welcomes the emphasis placed by the\r\ndocument on investing in prevention, peacemaking,\r\npeacekeeping and peacebuilding. We welcome in\r\nparticular the proposal to create a Peacebuilding\r\nCommission and a Support Office within the\r\nSecretariat. Iceland is willing to take part, along with\r\nother Member States, in ensuring that both are up and\r\nrunning by the end of the year.\r\nI must express disappointment at the fact that the\r\ngroup of four proposal for reforming the Security\r\nCouncil has not yet received the support it deserves.\r\nWhile not perfect, it remains the most practical basis\r\nfor reforming the Council. That approach therefore\r\ncontinues to have Iceland’s firm support. The Council\r\nmust reflect the world as it is and be representative.\r\nIceland has previously, in this very forum, expressed\r\nits interest in participating actively in the work of the\r\nCouncil in the years 2009 and 2010.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration provides a platform\r\nto address poverty in the developing countries.\r\nDeveloped countries have committed themselves to\r\nproviding the necessary support in the form of official\r\ndevelopment assistance. It is no less important for\r\ndeveloping countries to create a transparent and\r\naccountable environment that respects good\r\ngovernance and the rule of law, in order to attract\r\ndomestic and foreign investment, which fosters the\r\ngrowth of a vibrant private sector. It is also important\r\nfor developed and developing countries to ensure a\r\nsuccessful outcome of the current World Trade\r\nOrganization negotiations.\r\nThe Government of Iceland has acknowledged\r\nthe great challenge posed by the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. Accordingly, it will continue\r\nsubstantially to increase Iceland’s official development\r\nassistance in the coming years.\r\nIceland is committed to reform of the United\r\nNations and to finding common ways of dealing with\r\nthreats to international security. The outcome\r\ndocument has serious shortcomings, and the risk\r\nremains that the United Nations could be further\r\nweakened. Member States must ensure that the process\r\ncontinues and that it will, in the coming weeks and\r\nmonths, deliver on the fundamental issues at hand in\r\nthe interests of peace and prosperity in the world.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to Her\r\nExcellency Mrs. Ilinka Mitreva, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.\r\nMrs. Mitreva (The former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia): It gives me great pleasure to address this\r\nforum and to share with the General Assembly my\r\nGovernment’s views on issues of the highest relevance\r\nto our Organization. But first of all, let me express our\r\nsolidarity and heartfelt condolences in connection with\r\nthe loss of life and the damage caused by Hurricane\r\nKatrina in our host country — the United States of\r\nAmerica.\r\nI wish to congratulate Mr. Jan Eliasson of\r\nSweden on his election to the post of President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixtieth session. I am sure that\r\nunder his able guidance we will make substantial\r\nprogress in implementing the decisions adopted just a\r\nfew days ago by the heads of State. At the same time,\r\n7\r\nA/60/PV.16\r\nlet me congratulate Mr. Jean Ping of Gabon, President\r\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session, for a\r\njob well done. I would like also to commend Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan for his skilful leadership of the\r\nOrganization in what has turned out to be a very\r\ndifficult year.\r\nThe High-level Meeting and the outcome\r\ndocument reaffirmed our commitment to the core\r\nvalues and principles of the United Nations Charter\r\nand to effective multilateralism, and it identified areas\r\nfor future action. The summit has also provided us with\r\na unique opportunity to explore new ways to adapt the\r\nUnited Nations to new realities.\r\nThe Organization was created 60 years ago.\r\nHowever, the vision of its founders — to bring about a\r\nmore secure, democratic and developed world — needs\r\nto be pursued more vigorously today. As a wise man\r\nonce said, we should be both speakers of words and\r\ndoers of deeds. I am happy that we all agree that we\r\nneed a reformed, more effective and more credible\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe high-level segment made a fair assessment of\r\nthe progress achieved in the implementation of the\r\nMillennium Declaration and of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), as well as of the\r\noutcomes of the major United Nations conferences and\r\nsummits.\r\nThe assessment by the world leaders was both\r\nrealistic and upbeat. They boldly assessed the status of\r\ncurrent and longstanding problems — extreme poverty,\r\nhunger, disease, the HIV pandemic, child mortality,\r\nenvironmental degradation, lack of good governance,\r\ndisregard for human rights and the rule of law — and\r\nshowed strength and resolve in defining steps and\r\nactions to be taken or reinforced in order to meet our\r\ntargets, and they were cautiously optimistic about the\r\ndeadlines to be met.\r\nToday we live in a world in which our peoples,\r\nnations and Governments depend on each other. We\r\nmust recognize that in this interdependent and\r\nglobalized world, all threats are threats to us all. No\r\none is immune to them, nor does any single State have\r\na cure.\r\nBut how should we proceed? I believe that many\r\nof us share the view that, in fact, we already have a\r\nmultiplicity of documents and agreed positions, as well\r\nas many political commitments and adopted\r\ndeclarations. Much has been achieved by the United\r\nNations, and we are proud of that. My own country has\r\nalso benefited from United Nations efforts — the\r\nUnited Nations engagement in the first-ever preventive\r\ndeployment mission. That was a good example of the\r\neffectiveness of joint efforts and cooperation.\r\nHowever, turning to the main questions, we have\r\nfound that we are still lagging behind on some of the\r\nissues to which have so strongly committed ourselves.\r\nOne of the avenues for moving forward involves\r\nimplementation and visibility. These are not new\r\nwords. Many promising United Nations ideas and\r\nprojects have been sidelined due to inappropriate\r\nfollow-up and inadequate implementation measures, or\r\nsimply due to insufficient support and funding by the\r\nMember States. We should avoid such pitfalls.\r\nThe sooner the effects of the implementation of\r\nour decisions become visible, the greater international\r\npublic support will be, and the greater the chances of\r\ncreating a better world for us and for generations to\r\ncome. But we should not shy away from sharing that\r\nresponsibility with all those who can assist us, with\r\nthose who have the capacity to help promote and\r\nimplement our goals. There are many positive\r\nexamples in recent memory, beginning with the greater\r\ninvolvement of regional organizations, the civil sector,\r\nnon-governmental organizations, the private sector, and\r\nso on. Let us make greater use of them. We can only\r\nbenefit.\r\nOn this occasion, I will not dwell in detail on the\r\nprocesses of United Nations reform and the\r\nstrengthening of the Organization. President\r\nCrvenkovski elaborated Macedonia’s position on those\r\nissues here last week.\r\nMacedonia also aligns itself with the European\r\nUnion statement. Nevertheless, allow me to say a few\r\nwords on some current United Nations reform issues of\r\nparticular interest to us. Macedonia supports the view\r\nthat human rights, the rule of law and democracy\r\nshould be given a prominent place in the United\r\nNations reform proposals. Freedom from fear could be\r\nsaid to sum up the whole philosophy of human rights,\r\nas former Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld put it.\r\nIt has long been a strong position of my country\r\nthat respect for those principles, coupled with\r\ndevelopment, is the best conflict-prevention measure\r\nand a vital precondition for peace and prosperity. For\r\nthat reason, we see great merit in establishing a\r\n8\r\nA/60/PV.16\r\npeacebuilding commission. I trust that a balanced\r\ngender representation on the commission will only lead\r\nto its better functioning and give added value to\r\npeacebuilding. Furthermore, the establishment of the\r\nhuman rights council must be seen as a powerful tool\r\nto regain the values and principles originally envisaged\r\nby the creation of the United Nations.\r\nWe are very satisfied that the concept of\r\n“responsibility to protect” has found its well-deserved\r\nplace for the first time in a United Nations document\r\nand welcome its endorsement.\r\nThe democracy fund is a noble idea which\r\ndeserves our full creative engagement.\r\nTerrorism has turned into the plague of modern\r\ntimes. Since the last session of the General Assembly,\r\nmany atrocious terrorist attacks have taken place\r\nthroughout the world. Our firm commitment to fighting\r\nterrorism should engender more joint activities and\r\nactions. Our struggle must be based on full respect for\r\nhuman rights because it is human rights that terrorists\r\nare afraid of and seek to undermine. We need further\r\nconsolidation of the global anti-terrorist coalition and\r\nstrengthened cooperation with regional organizations.\r\nThe United Nations is at the core of activities in\r\nthe area of counter-terrorism. The Republic of\r\nMacedonia supports the elaboration of the United\r\nNations comprehensive counter-terrorism strategy, as\r\noutlined by the Secretary-General in Madrid. I would\r\nlike to appeal to the Member States to agree on the\r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism.\r\nThis year, we took a significant step by adopting the\r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of Acts\r\nof Nuclear Terrorism, which we signed on 16\r\nSeptember. The victims of recent acts of terrorism\r\npainfully remind us to move forward.\r\nFrom the very beginning, the Republic of\r\nMacedonia has been a part of the international anti-\r\nterrorist coalitions in Iraq and Afghanistan. Peace and\r\ndemocracy-building in those two countries remain among\r\nthe key challenges to the international community and to\r\nthe Iraqis and Afghans themselves. I would like once\r\nagain to reiterate our support for their efforts to rebuild\r\ntheir countries and to create better lives for their people.\r\nToday, my country, Macedonia, is a functional,\r\nmulti-ethnic democracy. Over the past three years, we\r\nhave launched and carried out a large number of reform\r\nprojects. Our hard work has brought us closer to the\r\nEuro-Atlantic structures. We have developed genuine\r\npartnerships with the Union and the alliance. We\r\nexpect the European Commission to give a positive\r\nevaluation of our achievements and Macedonia to be\r\ngranted the status of candidate at the December 2005\r\nsummit. I firmly believe that the time has come for our\r\nEuropean perspective to turn into a European reality. As\r\nfor the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, we expect the\r\ninvitation to join at the next enlargement summit.\r\nThe Government has recently announced its\r\neconomic programme, primarily aimed at increasing\r\neconomic growth and reducing unemployment. At the\r\nsame time, it has intensified the development of a\r\nclimate favourable to foreign investment and safe\r\nbusiness conduct. As a critical complement to\r\neconomic reforms, Macedonia is also focused on\r\nreform of the judiciary and the fight against organized\r\ncrime and corruption. We have set a goal to do better.\r\nThe reforms are not easy, but we are firm in our\r\nresolve to implement them.\r\nRegional cooperation has become a major\r\ncharacteristic of the foreign policies of all countries in\r\nSouth-East Europe. We have been patiently building a\r\nnew spirit of cooperation, while at the same time\r\nlearning the true meaning of developing relations based\r\non mutual trust and solidarity. That includes our\r\nbilateral relations, as well as a large number of regional\r\ninitiatives. Recognizing that reality and the need to\r\ncooperate and to build good-neighbourly relations and\r\nmutual confidence was not an easy undertaking, but it\r\nis the only way ahead. We take pride in seeing the\r\nregion move forward. The Republic of Macedonia will\r\ncontinue even more vigorously to pursue such policy.\r\nThere is no alternative to dialogue and all outstanding\r\nregional issues should be resolved in that manner.\r\nIn closing, I am confident that our deliberations\r\nwill contribute to better and faster follow-up of the\r\ncommitments agreed at the High-level Plenary\r\nMeeting. I believe that we can soon come up with\r\nimplementation mechanisms that will give life to what\r\nwas conceived by our leaders. There were many\r\ndebates, some of them very contradictory, showing\r\nhow different we are. But diversity should not prevent\r\nus from having a common vision and goals for a better\r\nfuture. That is why we are here at the United Nations.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ahmed Ould Sid’Ahmed, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Mauritania.\r\n9\r\nA/60/PV.16\r\nMr. Ahmed (Mauritania) (spoke in Arabic): On\r\nbehalf of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, I am\r\npleased to extend to Mr. Eliasson my wholehearted\r\ncongratulations on his election to the presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixtieth session. We are\r\nconvinced that his wealth of experience and immense\r\ntalent will allow him to address the international and\r\nregional issues on our agenda with confidence and\r\nensure the success of this session, which coincides with\r\nthe sixtieth anniversary of our Organization.\r\nI cannot fail to seize this opportunity to pay\r\ntribute to his predecessor, Mr. Jean Ping, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Gabon, for his gifted and patient\r\nperformance at the helm of the General Assembly at\r\nthe fifty-ninth session and for his tireless efforts to\r\nestablish the appropriate conditions for the holding of\r\nthe session and the High-level Plenary Meeting that\r\npreceded it.\r\nI should also like warmly to congratulate\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan and his colleagues on\r\ntheir intense and consistent mediation and efforts to\r\nensure the convening of this session and the\r\nachievement of the Organization’s lofty objectives.\r\nI also hail the major efforts made during the\r\nintersessional period at the high-level dialogue begun\r\nin New York in late June on financing for development\r\nand at the Economic and Social Council session on\r\nnational achievements and steps towards the attainment\r\nof the Millennium Development Goals and to\r\nimplement the outcomes of the international\r\nconferences held from 1992 to 2002.\r\nAttaining the objectives of development, security\r\nand stability hinges on how effectively we deal with\r\nthe issues of violence and terrorism. The global nature\r\nof the phenomenon of terrorism requires that the\r\nquestion be dealt with in a global manner, through the\r\ncomplementarity of the cultures of nations and a\r\nrejection of confrontation and conflict. It is also\r\nimportant not to forget the considerable growth gap\r\nthat exists between poor and rich countries, particularly\r\nsince the social, scientific and technical lag is one of\r\nthe major causes of tension and one that nurtures\r\nterrorism and violence in the world. In Mauritania, we\r\ncondemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,\r\nand we view it as a phenomenon that is alien to our\r\nsociety and our Islamic values of tolerance. We reject\r\nviolence and extremism and call for mutual\r\nunderstanding, dialogue and tolerance.\r\nIt is clear that we must quickly begin a political\r\ndialogue, which is the only means to end the conflict in\r\nthe Middle East and to restore calm there. In this\r\ncontext, my country believes that the Israeli\r\nwithdrawal from Gaza and a few cities of the West\r\nBank constitutes an important step towards the\r\nimplementation of the road map and the Arab peace\r\ninitiatives. Through those initiatives Arab States have\r\nproposed to Israel a comprehensive peace and normal\r\nrelations in exchange for total withdrawal from all\r\nPalestinian territories and from Syrian and Lebanese\r\nterritories, a return to the 4 June 1967 borders, the\r\nestablishment of a Palestinian State with East\r\nJerusalem as its capital, and a negotiated, just\r\nsettlement of the problem of Palestinian refugees.\r\nWe are following with interest the developments\r\nof the situation in Iraq and are anxious to preserve\r\nIraq’s territorial unity, the unity of its people, its\r\nsovereignty, independence and non-interference in its\r\ninternal problems, in order to overcome the problems\r\nand ensure security, stability and the re-construction of\r\nthe State, while supporting the transitional\r\nGovernment.\r\nWe are following with equal interest the\r\ndevelopment of the situation in the Sudan, and we give\r\nour blessing to the Agreement between the\r\nGovernment of Sudan and the Sudanese People’s\r\nLiberation Army. We support the commendable efforts\r\nof the Sudanese Government, in coordination with the\r\nAfrican Union, the Arab League and the United\r\nNations, to tackle humanitarian, security and political\r\nquestions related to the Darfur crisis.\r\nRegarding Western Sahara, Mauritania supports\r\nthe efforts of the United Nations and its Secretary-\r\nGeneral to find a definitive solution to assure stability\r\nin the region, a solution that has the support of all\r\nparties.\r\nMauritania today is on the eve of an era that\r\nbegan with an initiative taken by the Military Council\r\nfor Justice and Democracy on 3 August 2005, which\r\nwas hailed by the entire Mauritanian people. It put an\r\nend to totalitarian practices that caused suffering and\r\nled to dangerous derailments that threatened the future\r\nof the country over the last two decades. This initiative\r\nrests on the commitment of the Council to the\r\nMauritanian people to create the right conditions for\r\nthe emergence of an honest and transparent democracy\r\nand to allow civil society and all legal political actors\r\n10\r\nA/60/PV.16\r\nto participate in this endeavour with full freedom. The\r\nMilitary Council will not exercise its powers beyond\r\nthe period necessary to prepare for and set up genuine\r\ndemocratic institutions, and that period will not extend\r\nbeyond two years. The Military Council for Justice and\r\nDemocracy solemnly reaffirms respect for all of\r\nMauritania’s international commitments and instruments.\r\nIn crystallizing this initiative, the Military\r\nCouncil for Justice and Democracy has defined the\r\npriorities of the transitional Government. It has\r\nestablished three ministerial committees entrusted with\r\nthe task of defining the modalities to guarantee proper\r\nelections, working together with political parties and\r\ncivil society organizations to establish an equitable\r\nlegal system, in consultation with the national bar\r\nassociation. The aim of these efforts is to propose all\r\nmeasures necessary for the emergence of a genuine\r\nsystem of good governance, in which the private sector\r\nand civil society participate.\r\nIn order to ensure justice and national\r\nreconciliation and to enable all people to participate\r\nfreely and actively in political life, a comprehensive\r\nand absolute amnesty was proclaimed on 2 September\r\n2005 for all Mauritanians condemned for political\r\ncrimes and misdemeanours. At this point in time, no\r\nMauritanian is being prosecuted for any political crime\r\ndomestically or abroad.\r\nFor the first time, the mass media are open to all\r\npolitical parties and civil society institutions. A\r\nconstitutional law was enacted prohibiting the\r\nPresident and members of the Military Council for\r\nJustice and Democracy, the Prime Minister and\r\nmembers of the Transitional Government from\r\nstanding in the forthcoming elections or supporting any\r\npolitical candidate or party. An independent elections\r\ncommittee was formed to supervise elections, seeking\r\nhelp from any nation willing to help. It is in this\r\ncontext that Mauritania presented a memorandum to\r\nthe United Nations regarding provision of assistance to\r\ninternational observers invited by the Mauritanian\r\nGovernment to provide technical and logistical\r\nassistance for the elections. This is with a view to\r\nconducting a constitutional referendum, which will be\r\norganized by July 2006 at the latest, as well as\r\nlegislative and presidential elections to be held before\r\n6 August 2007. The referendums and elections would\r\nbe held in accordance with the commitment made by\r\nthe Military Council for Justice and Democracy with\r\nthe Transitional Government, in order to provide the\r\nappropriate conditions for a transparent and open\r\ndemocracy and to facilitate the establishment of\r\ninstitutions that will be truly representative and\r\ndiverse.\r\nMauritania is eager to contribute to the\r\ndevelopment of cooperation and solidarity in the\r\nregional context. It is in that context that we would like\r\nto reaffirm our total support for the Arab Maghreb,\r\nwhich remains an incontrovertible strategic choice and\r\nan ambitious project for the people of the region in\r\ntheir aspirations to greater complementarity and\r\nsolidarity.\r\nWith regard to the African continent, we would\r\nlike to reiterate the importance we attach to our\r\nfriendship and brotherly relations with all countries of\r\nthe continent. We would like to further strengthen\r\ncultural dialogue, communications and relations, which\r\nwe have pledged to do within the Five-plus-Five\r\nframework and the Barcelona process, the tenth\r\nanniversary of which we shall celebrate this year.\r\nGiven ongoing world changes, we would like to\r\nsee the role and functions of the General Assembly\r\nenhanced and to see its decisions implemented. That\r\nholds true for other organs of the United Nations, in\r\nparticular the Economic and Social Council.\r\nThe Security Council needs to be strengthened,\r\nand to be made more representative by including\r\nmembers from Africa, Latin America and other regional\r\ngroups, such as the Arab Group, as well as other\r\nindustrialized States such as Germany and Japan. Finally,\r\nthe working methods of the Council and its performance\r\nneed to be improved so that it can achieve its mandate\r\nof maintaining international peace and security.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His\r\nExcellency Mr. Per Stig Moeller, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Denmark.\r\nMr. Moeller (Denmark): The conclusion of the\r\nsummit last week marks the beginning of another busy\r\nyear for the General Assembly and the Member States\r\nof the United Nations. The summit gave us an\r\nambitious new agenda and in the spirit of\r\nmultilateralism we must do our utmost to meet the\r\ngoals it set out. Denmark intends to pull up its sleeves\r\nand contribute to that undertaking and I encourage\r\nothers to do the same.\r\nIn his impressive report “In larger freedom”\r\n(A/59/2005), issued in March, the Secretary-General\r\n11\r\nA/60/PV.16\r\ngave us the best possible basis for the necessary and\r\nprofound changes the Organization must undergo. The\r\nspirit of the new interrelated reform agenda is captured\r\nin the report’s observation that “… we will not enjoy\r\ndevelopment without security, we will not enjoy\r\nsecurity without development, and we will not enjoy\r\neither without respect for human rights” (A/59/2005,\r\npara. 17). With those words the Secretary-General\r\nidentified the three pillars of the United Nations in the\r\ntwenty-first century: security, development and human\r\nrights.\r\nThe custodian of international peace and security\r\nis the Security Council. In October last year, members\r\nelected Denmark as a non-permanent member of the\r\nSecurity Council. We have — to the best of our\r\nabilities — sought to translate the trust bestowed upon\r\nus into action: Denmark holds the Chair of the Counter-\r\nTerrorism Committee; we work for improvements in\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping by pursuing a holistic\r\napproach to the concept of peacebuilding; we advocate\r\nbetter protection for women and children; and we\r\nsupport a stronger emphasis on the rule of law and the\r\nneed to end impunity.\r\nThe Security Council must clearly demonstrate its\r\nwill to enforce the decisions taken by it. If not, the\r\nCouncil loses credibility, and the international\r\ncommunity loses its only forceful multilateral\r\ninstrument.\r\nTargeted sanctions are an important instrument\r\nfor achieving compliance with decisions of the\r\nSecurity Council and for compliance with international\r\nlaw in general. We must continue an intensive dialogue\r\non how best to implement sanctions and how to follow\r\nthem up to ensure the desired outcome. The approach\r\nmust always include both carrot and stick — incentive\r\nand punishment.\r\nThe United Nations plays a central role in efforts\r\nto fight terrorism and we support the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s outline for a comprehensive United Nations\r\ncounter-terrorism strategy that will engage the whole\r\nUnited Nations system in the fight against terrorism.\r\nWe will take an active part in its further development\r\nand implementation. We also welcome the new\r\nresolution on terrorism adopted by the Security\r\nCouncil (Security Council resolution 1624 (2005)).\r\nAs Chair of the Counter-Terrorism Committee,\r\nDenmark regards itself as having a special\r\nresponsibility in that field. We have given priority to\r\nenhanced cooperation between the relevant Security\r\nCouncil subsidiary organs dealing with terrorism, and\r\nwe will continue to do so. We have also engaged in\r\ndialogue with parts of the United Nations family not\r\npreviously involved in the fight against terrorism. The\r\naim of that dialogue is to identify their role in helping\r\nStates that would like to engage more actively in the\r\nfight against terrorism, but which lack the capacity to\r\ndo so. We will continue our efforts to strengthen the\r\nsynergies between relevant United Nations actors to\r\nfurther strengthen the counter-terrorism capability of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nOur efforts to fight international terrorism must\r\nbe carried out with full respect for human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms. It is imperative to strike the\r\nright balance between, on the one hand, preventive and\r\nswift action against terrorists and, on the other,\r\nadequate safeguards for the individual, and not least\r\nfor those who have been unjustly listed.\r\nThe summit has sent an important political\r\nmessage about the dedication of Member States to fight\r\nterrorism, even if it was not as strong as we had\r\nwished. We must now make every effort, at the present\r\nsession of the General Assembly, to reach agreement\r\non a comprehensive convention on international\r\nterrorism. Any further stalling on that important issue\r\nwill send the wrong message.\r\nThe single most frightening scenario today is that\r\nof weapons of mass destruction in the hands of non-\r\nState actors. Such possession constitutes a danger to\r\ncivilizations all over the world. Nobody can claim to\r\nbe safe today. Everybody must acknowledge the danger\r\nand refrain from activities that increase the threat. We\r\nneed a concerted effort in the field of non-proliferation\r\nand disarmament. The failure of the non-proliferation\r\ntreaty review conference, held this spring, to produce\r\nan agreement and the lack of new commitments at the\r\nsummit must not lead to resignation, but rather must\r\nspur us to redouble our efforts.\r\nAt the same, time concerted action is needed to\r\nend illicit traffic in small arms and light weapons,\r\nwhich kill 500,000 people every year. Arms transfers\r\nmust be transparent. Denmark strongly supports the\r\nadoption of an international arms trade treaty. Such a\r\ntreaty must be legally binding, include all weapons and\r\nbe United Nations-based.\r\nDenmark favours a holistic approach to\r\npeacebuilding. We believe the United Nations is well\r\n12\r\nA/60/PV.16\r\nplaced to coordinate international efforts to assist\r\ncountries emerging from conflict. Therefore, we have\r\nactively supported the establishment of the\r\nPeacebuilding Commission. This new body will add\r\nvalue to the work done by various actors including the\r\nfunds and programmes of the United Nations. I urge\r\nMember States to ensure that the Commission will be\r\noperational by the end of the year, as requested by the\r\nsummit.\r\nIt is a fact that conflicts in Africa continue to\r\nloom large on the Security Council’s agenda. The\r\nslogan “African solutions to African problems” must\r\nnot lead to indifference from donors. We must increase\r\nour assistance to regional capacity-building and, at the\r\nsame time, be prepared to provide the necessary human\r\nand financial resources for conflict prevention and\r\npeacebuilding efforts. To that end, Denmark is\r\nsponsoring a major capacity-building programme in\r\nAfrica in close cooperation with the African Union and\r\nthe Economic Community of West African States.\r\nThe summit confirmed our dedication to fulfil the\r\nMillennium Development Goals through considerable\r\ndonor commitments, as well as the need to pay\r\nparticular attention to countries in Africa that are\r\nlagging far behind. Denmark will remain well above\r\nthe 0.7 aid target and urges all donor countries to\r\nimplement the goals decided by the summit. The\r\nresponsibility, however, does not rest with donor\r\ncountries alone. In order to ensure sustainable\r\ndevelopment the world’s poor countries must prioritize\r\nhuman development and respect for human rights,\r\ntackle national inequalities and curb corruption.\r\nIn a closely interrelated and interdependent\r\nworld, our collective security and prosperity depend\r\ncritically on the success of our fight against poverty.\r\nWe must continue to look for new ways to enforce\r\ninternational law and protect those in need. Promoting\r\nthe rule of law must be one of the main objectives\r\nwhen devising peacebuilding strategies in Africa and\r\nwhen addressing democratic deficits elsewhere.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nIndeed, prosperity and security will occur only if\r\nand when we decide to respect and promote human\r\nrights. It is our obligation to address and to act on\r\nhuman rights violations wherever they occur, and we\r\nmust do so in a spirit of cooperation and\r\nunderstanding. It is our common duty to measure every\r\nMember State’s actual performance against the\r\nuniversal standards of human rights, including when\r\nthat means naming and even shaming. Otherwise, we\r\nrisk undermining important norms of human decency\r\nand behaviour. All Governments must remember that\r\nthey are in office for the people and not for themselves.\r\nFor those reasons, Denmark strongly supports the\r\nestablishment of the Human Rights Council as a\r\npermanent, principal organ of the United Nations, as\r\nwell as the overall strengthening of the entire United\r\nNations human rights machinery, including the Office\r\nof the United Nations High Commissioner for Human\r\nRights. Sixty years after the creation of this Organization,\r\nwe should give human rights the necessary attention and\r\npriority in order to meet the expectations of the people,\r\nwhom we are meant to serve.\r\nThe grave crimes against humanity committed in\r\nDarfur serve as a reminder to the international\r\ncommunity. Impunity is unacceptable. Some argue that\r\nwe face a dilemma every time a country emerges from\r\nconflict. They argue that the pursuit of justice clashes\r\nwith the pursuit of peace. However, peace and justice\r\nare not contradictory but, in fact, complementary. The\r\nprecedent created by the referral of the Darfur situation\r\nto the International Criminal Court is promising. It is a\r\nmajor step forward in the fight against impunity and\r\nbodes well for the pursuit of international justice.\r\nLastly, let me briefly address the call by the\r\nSecretary-General and Member States, including\r\nDenmark, for management reform. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral must be given the necessary discretionary\r\npowers, accompanied by accountability and\r\nindependent oversight. We need to modernize the way\r\nwe work so as to enable the Organization to meet its\r\nshare of the priorities set out at the summit.\r\nThe coming months will be crucial. The outcome\r\nof the summit must be implemented. We will be faced\r\nwith many difficult but important tasks. They will have\r\nto be solved in a true spirit of international\r\ncooperation. We must strengthen this great institution.\r\nIt has a vital role to play in the world of today.\r\nDenmark will spare no effort in doing its share.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Jean-Paul Ngoupande, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs, Regional Integration and\r\nFrancophonie of the Central African Republic.\r\nMr. Ngoupande (Central African Republic)\r\n(spoke in French): I should like first of all to express\r\n13\r\nA/60/PV.16\r\nheartfelt congratulations to you, Sir, on behalf of my\r\ndelegation and on my own behalf, on your election to\r\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its sixtieth\r\nsession. We wish you every success in the discharge of\r\nyour important functions. Your election to the\r\npresidency is, of course a reflection of your great\r\npersonal qualities and experience. But it is also a\r\ntribute to your country, Sweden, which has always\r\nbeen committed to United Nations activities, in\r\nparticular development assistance.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to express to\r\nyour predecessor, Mr. Jean Ping, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Gabon, my deep admiration for his\r\noutstanding work as President, including the\r\nconsiderable efforts that he made throughout his term\r\nof office with a view to ensuring the success of the\r\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting, which took place from\r\n14 to 16 September. As an African and as a\r\nrepresentative of a country member of the Economic\r\nCommunity of Central African States, I cannot but feel\r\ngreat pride in his achievements.\r\nJust a few days ago, a major event took place\r\nhere at the United Nations — an event comparable to\r\nthe Millennium Summit, in which leaders from all over\r\nthe world took part.\r\nI am sure that we all remember how the President\r\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session\r\ninvited us to focus our discussion on the theme, “A\r\nstronger and more effective Organization: follow-up to\r\nand implementation of the High-level Plenary Meeting\r\nin September 2005”.\r\nOn Friday, 16 September, late in the evening, a\r\ncompromise document was adopted, which was\r\nacceptable to my delegation, even though it did not\r\nrespond to all the concerns expressed in the courageous\r\nreport of the Secretary-General, to whom, once again,\r\nmy country would like to pay a well-deserved tribute.\r\nSome of the bold proposals that he made, in particular\r\nthose relating to the need to reform the Organization,\r\nseem to us still to be entirely relevant, since they\r\nwould make the United Nations stronger and more\r\neffective by adapting it to the challenges of twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nThe delegation of the Central African Republic\r\nbelieves that the debate on the reform of the\r\nOrganization, in particular the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil, is far from over. This is not simply a matter of\r\njustice for all those who were not present in San\r\nFrancisco 60 years ago when the Organization was\r\ncreated. The African continent, which really began to\r\nmake itself heard internationally from 1960 onwards,\r\nrightly claims its place within the Security Council on\r\nan equitable basis. We can rest assured that the young\r\npeople of Africa are paying attention to the activities of\r\nthe United Nations and to our discussions here, and\r\nthey find it increasingly difficult to understand why our\r\ncontinent is the only one not to have a permanent seat\r\nin that body, which is responsible for taking the most\r\nimportant decisions affecting peace and security\r\nthroughout the world, including in Africa.\r\nIn a statement made from this rostrum on\r\nThursday, 15 September 2005, during the debate in the\r\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting, His Excellency\r\nMr. François Bozizé, President of the Central African\r\nRepublic, underlined the extent to which we, the small\r\ndeveloping countries, in particular those that have gone\r\nthrough or that are currently going through major\r\nconflicts or political crises, need a strong and effective\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe recent history of our country makes clear the\r\nextent to which international solidarity, coordinated by\r\nthe United Nations and its specialized agencies,\r\nsucceeded in helping us to get back on our feet. After\r\nalmost a decade of chaos, on 15 March 2003 an\r\nupsurge of patriotism enabled us to make a consensus-\r\nbased transition, and we have benefited from the\r\nsupport, advice and expertise, as well as the financial\r\nand material assistance, of all of our external partners.\r\nFor two years, we were assisted by the United\r\nNations Peacebuilding Support Office in the Central\r\nAfrican Republic, the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme and other specialized agencies, and by our\r\nbilateral and multilateral partners, including France,\r\nChina, the United States of America, the European\r\nUnion, the International Organization of la\r\nFrancophonie and, of course, our high-ranking African\r\ncolleagues, among them the countries of the Central\r\nAfrican Economic and Monetary Community, under\r\nthe chairmanship of El Hadj Omar Bongo Ondimba,\r\nPresident of Gabon.\r\nTherefore, the success of our consensus-based\r\ntransition is to a large extent the success of\r\ninternational solidarity as mobilized by the United\r\nNations. Of course, the national will, expressed first\r\nand foremost by the citizens of the Central African\r\nRepublic at all levels — who are weary of violence and\r\n14\r\nA/60/PV.16\r\nchaos and yearn for peace — and supported by our\r\npolitical elite as reflected in governmental actions by\r\nPresident Bozizé himself, this national will has been\r\nthe prime factor enabling us to bring our transitional\r\nperiod and electoral process to a successful conclusion.\r\nIn this sense, and rightly so, the international\r\ncommunity has paid unanimous tribute to the wisdom\r\nof the Central Africans, who have chosen to return to\r\npeace and national concord.\r\nBut international solidarity was a necessary\r\ncondition that led us successfully to a consensus-based\r\ntransition and a successful electoral process. That is\r\nwhy, on behalf of President François Bozizé and the\r\nCentral African Government and people, I should like\r\nto reiterate to all of our partners an expression of our\r\ngratitude.\r\nAs the head of State said in his statement on\r\nThursday, 15 September 2005, the Central African\r\nRepublic is starting on a second stage in its process of\r\nreturn to peace and security, and that is the stage of\r\nreconstruction. This is a tremendous challenge in a\r\ncountry that was ruined and subject to chaos for many\r\nyears. As Central Africans, we are well aware of our\r\nprime responsibility, of our collective responsibility as\r\na nation, for the disaster that our country lived through.\r\nIf only for that reason, the bulk of the efforts and\r\nsacrifices to be made in the reconstruction must fall to\r\nus. We are fully convinced of that. But we must\r\nhonestly admit that in the face of the enormity and\r\ncomplexity of the tasks involved in reconstruction, the\r\nneed for solidarity is still great. In saying that, we wish\r\nsimply to recall precedents where the international\r\ncommunity understood that the best way to avoid a\r\nstep backwards was to support reconstruction in a\r\nstrong way. The real victory over violence and disorder\r\nis achieved when extreme poverty, which is the prime\r\ncause of the frustrations that lead to confrontation, is\r\nrolled back. Successful elections and democratic\r\ninstitutions that begin to function and cope with the\r\ncountry’s problems are certainly an important advance\r\nalong the lengthy and difficult path toward peace and\r\nstability. But all this remains basically precarious, as\r\nlong as the legitimate expectations of the population\r\nare not satisfied and their hope to benefit from the\r\ndividends of peace is not realized. How can this be\r\ndone in a country that has been bled white, that does\r\nnot even have the minimum required for life, and on\r\nwhich donors impose the same conditions as they do on\r\ncountries that are functioning normally? How, when a\r\ncountry is painfully emerging from a long period of\r\nchaos, can it find the resources to repay the debt so that\r\nit can hope to benefit from additional economic\r\nassistance?\r\nThese issues and others face the international\r\ncommunity as part of its responsibility for managing\r\nthe emergence from crisis. This raises the question of\r\nthe ways and means of consolidating peace to emerge\r\nfrom a period of chaos in order to avoid the risk of a\r\nreturn to square one. The Secretary-General very\r\nrightly underlined this in his report. The outcome\r\ndocument of the High-level Plenary Meeting also\r\nmentions that. The creation of a Peace-building\r\nCommission is, therefore, very timely. This is a sign\r\nthat there is uncertainty in conflict management, as to\r\ndischarge a sick person when convalescence is only\r\njust beginning often leads to a relapse. It would be a\r\ngood thing if this uncertainty could be removed. The\r\nmoving appeal made by the President of the\r\nTransitional Government of Somalia strengthens us in\r\nour belief that the best way to avoid relapses, which\r\nare very difficult and costly to manage, is to provide\r\nstrong support for reconstruction.\r\nWhenever a country that has plunged into the\r\nabyss starts to raise its head again, it is a victory for the\r\nwhole of humanity, and humanity cannot stand by\r\nwhile one of its members drowns, however small it is.\r\nEmergence from a crisis stands, therefore, as a new\r\nchallenge for the United Nations. It is a matter of\r\ncreating the conditions under which a country that is\r\nstarting on the return to peace and stability can avoid\r\ntumbling back into a state of chaos. The solution\r\ninvolves, in our opinion, an additional demonstration\r\nof solidarity and generosity from its development\r\npartners to support the efforts of the convalescing\r\nsociety.\r\nOur country is convinced that a lasting return to\r\npeace involves the participation of people at all levels\r\nof Central African society. The quest for peace and\r\nstability is not only the concern of professional\r\npoliticians. Of course, it is important that politicians\r\nwork tirelessly to develop arrangements that are in\r\nkeeping with the national interest and that they avoid\r\nany radicalization of their political positions in order to\r\ngive peace a chance. This is the behaviour Central\r\nAfrican politicians have exhibited and it explains to a\r\nlarge extent the peaceful outcome of the consensus-\r\nbased transitional process and the successful electoral\r\nprocess.\r\n15\r\nA/60/PV.16\r\nBut this is not enough to consolidate peace.\r\nThose who pay the highest price for the failures of\r\npolitics must also have their say. Young people,\r\nwomen, peasants, urban employees, private\r\nentrepreneurs and the media all have a great interest in\r\nbeing closely involved in efforts and actions aimed at\r\npeacebuilding and we should therefore pay tribute to\r\nthe model of cooperation initiated by the United\r\nNations in the Great Lakes region of Africa. This\r\ncooperation, which regularly brings together the heads\r\nof State and their ministers as well as various segments\r\nof civil society, ensures that discussions related to the\r\nquest for peace involve non-politicians as well. This\r\ninitiative, moreover, has the merit of bringing to the\r\ntable other countries, either closely or less closely\r\ninvolved in the Great Lakes problems. In fact, no crisis\r\nis limited to just one country, there are direct or\r\nindirect effects on neighbours. That is why the\r\ntremendous work done by Professor Ibrahima Fall\r\nshould be encouraged and supported.\r\nAs far as the Central African Republic is\r\nconcerned, the priorities of the Government of\r\nNational Reconciliation formed after the election were\r\nclearly identified in the Declaration of General Policy\r\npresented to the National Assembly in early August by\r\nPrime Minister Elie Dote. There are three focal points\r\nfor the short and medium term. First, the re-\r\nestablishment of security throughout the whole\r\ncountry; secondly, the control and stabilization of\r\npublic finances; and thirdly, the rehabilitation and\r\nrelaunching of various sectors of the national economy,\r\nsuch as the mining industries, lumber, agriculture and\r\nlivestock.\r\nWith regard to the first point, it goes without\r\nsaying that no progress is possible without eradicating\r\nthe endemic insecurity caused by armed bands,\r\nespecially those who set up roadblocks. Reconstruction\r\nof the security and defence forces, which has already\r\nbegun, and the re-equipment of those forces are matters\r\nthat the Government is working to resolve. Subregional\r\ncooperation is also an important asset, with the active\r\npresence of the multinational force of the Economic\r\nand Monetary Community of Central Africa and\r\noperations carried out by forces from the Central\r\nAfrican Republic, Cameroon and Chad along their\r\nshared borders. In this connection we should pay\r\ntribute to the initiative taken by the United Nations\r\nPeacebuilding Support Office in Bangui, which\r\norganized a meeting of subregional diplomats and\r\ndefence experts in Yaoundé, from 26 to 27 August. We\r\nshould also pay tribute to the contribution of France,\r\nwhich is providing the multinational force of the\r\nEconomic and Monetary Community of Central Africa\r\nwith valuable logistical support.\r\nBeyond short-term considerations, the major\r\nlong-term challenges facing the Central African\r\nRepublic are those of health and education. Education\r\nand health care are among the principal objectives of\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. The Central\r\nAfrican Republic hopes to achieve those Goals by\r\n2015. We know that lasting development cannot be\r\nestablished without strengthening our national\r\ncapacities.\r\nHaving suffered in various ways in recent years,\r\nthe people of the Central African Republic sincerely\r\naspire to peace and stability. They are determined to\r\nstrive and sacrifice in order to leave the painful past\r\nbehind. They need the understanding and support of\r\ntheir partners, chief among which is the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Fabio Berardi, Minister for Foreign and\r\nPolitical Affairs of San Marino.\r\nMr. Berardi (San Marino) (spoke in Italian;\r\nEnglish text furnished by the delegation): On behalf of\r\nthe Government of the Republic of San Marino, I wish\r\nto congratulate Ambassador Jan Eliasson on his\r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its\r\nsixtieth session. I also wish to express to the outgoing\r\nPresident, Mr. Jean Ping, our deepest gratitude for his\r\ncommitment and determination in fulfilling his\r\nmandate.\r\nAt the outset, I would also like to express my\r\nappreciation for the result of the outcome document. I\r\nam confident that, with a clear mandate for our heads\r\nof State and Government, we will be able to reach our\r\ngoals.\r\nThe United Nations is at an extremely important\r\nand critical juncture. Indeed, the challenge of United\r\nNations reform has become inevitable and necessary in\r\nlaying the foundations of its future activity. It is now\r\nall too clear that the reform will involve its major\r\nbodies, working methods and management of human\r\nand economic resources. The United Nations structure\r\nwill be modified with the aim of showing the entire\r\nworld that the Organization is an efficient and\r\n16\r\nA/60/PV.16\r\ndemocratic body that can guarantee peace and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe reform, which will lead to tension and\r\nrequire sacrifices, will be criticized by a number of\r\nStates, as is the case with all difficult compromises.\r\nThe process will be long and encounter numerous\r\nobstacles, but it is necessary and indispensable.\r\nSan Marino believes that the reform process\r\nalready under way will not stop. However, changes will\r\nhave to be wide-ranging and take account of the need\r\nto face important issues, such as the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council. Most importantly, the reform will\r\nhave to be supported by the widest possible consensus\r\nand based on two principles: democracy and\r\ntransparency. We hope the enlargement will take into\r\naccount the widest possible geographical and regional\r\nrepresentation and that the solution’s methods and\r\nideas will not be forcibly imposed or privilege the\r\ninterests of only a few countries. We endorse the\r\nprinciples of “Uniting for consensus” and are ready to\r\nconsider any proposal that does not create fractures and\r\ncan establish a new and lasting balance.\r\nFor San Marino, the United Nations must be\r\nbased upon democracy, which gives it its legitimacy\r\nand moral strength. Streamlining structures and\r\nprocedures is also necessary to greater effectiveness,\r\nbecause it is in the field, among people, that the United\r\nNations really fulfils its mission. Indeed, it is the\r\npeople who determine the importance of this\r\nOrganization in the improvement of their lives.\r\nWith regard to some essential aspects presently\r\nunder discussion, San Marino feels that the proposed\r\ncreation of a human rights council may not solve the\r\nbasic problem of the Commission on Human Rights,\r\nwhich is politicization. However, San Marino is of the\r\nview that human rights protection deserves the same\r\nconsideration given by the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil to social and economic aspects and by the\r\nSecurity Council to peace and security.\r\nThe human rights council should be directly\r\naccountable to the General Assembly and have a\r\nbroad-based composition allowing for the adequate\r\nparticipation of small and medium-sized countries.\r\nMoreover, the specific competencies of the new\r\ncouncil vis-à-vis the Third Committee should be\r\nestablished in order to avoid duplication of activities\r\nand inefficiencies.\r\nThe proposed peacebuilding commission is an\r\nexcellent institutional response to post-conflict\r\nsituations. The commission should play an important\r\nrole not only in the resolution, but also in the\r\nprevention of conflicts. Moreover, it should find ad hoc\r\nsolutions for countries in transition from\r\ntotalitarianism or institutional anarchy to democracy.\r\nIn our view, the commission should submit\r\nrecommendations to the Security Council on measures\r\nto be adopted to guarantee consistency in peace\r\ninterventions, economic recovery processes, the\r\nrebuilding of national institutions and public\r\nadministration, and the strengthening of democracy\r\nand the rule of law. Moreover, we believe that the\r\nCommission should be composed of members of the\r\nSecurity Council and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil, as well as of countries directly involved in\r\nspecific situations.\r\nJust a few days ago, the majority of the world\r\nleaders gathered in this very Hall to discuss what has\r\nbeen done so far to achieve the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. Over the past five years,\r\ndevelopment assistance activities have fallen short of\r\nexpectations. We sincerely hope that the recently\r\nconcluded summit will promote and encourage stronger\r\ncommitment by all developed and developing\r\ncountries.\r\nSan Marino has followed very attentively the\r\nreform process initiated by the Secretary-General and\r\nhas actively participated in the discussions of the\r\nPanel’s report and of the Secretary-General’s report\r\nentitled “In larger freedom”, as well as in the\r\nnegotiations of the outcome document of the General\r\nAssembly. We would have liked the latter document to\r\ncontain more incisive and comprehensive proposals.\r\nSan Marino is aware that development is the sine\r\nqua non condition for achieving the Millennium Goals.\r\nToday, in the twenty-first century, more than a billion\r\npeople still live on less than a dollar a day and 30,000\r\nchildren die every day from hunger. Those figures\r\ncannot leave us indifferent. Only by eradicating\r\npoverty, underdevelopment and epidemics, and by\r\nforgiving the crushing debt of developing countries,\r\nwill collective well-being be achieved.\r\nPeace and security are intimately linked to the\r\nMillennium Goals, as they are essential for a country to\r\nimprove its economic and human conditions. Peace and\r\nsecurity cannot be separated from concerns about\r\n17\r\nA/60/PV.16\r\nterrorism, as evidenced by the numerous recent\r\ncowardly attacks. Terrorism must not divert the\r\ninternational community from its commitment to\r\npromoting democratization, the culture of peace and\r\nrespect for religions, ethnic groups and different\r\ncultures.\r\nAll States must share the responsibility for\r\nfighting terrorism and cooperate at the regional and\r\ninternational levels to implement specific and effective\r\npreventive measures. Every State must adopt the\r\nnecessary legislation to break the vicious cycle of\r\nterrorism and to prevent its financing through\r\neconomic and banking cooperation.\r\nThe principle of “the responsibility to protect” is\r\nan extremely interesting concept. That idea, however,\r\ncan be accepted only if understood not as a violation of\r\nnational sovereignty, but as a duty of all States vis-à-\r\nvis countries plagued by massacres, genocide and\r\nhumanitarian crises.\r\nSan Marino is closely following developments in\r\nthe peace process in the Middle East. The decision of\r\nthe Israeli Government to remove its settlers from the\r\nGaza Strip and the West Bank has been one of the most\r\nsignificant steps in the implementation of the road map\r\nand Prime Minister Sharon has showed great courage\r\nand determination, despite all domestic difficulties, in\r\ntaking such a decision.\r\nSan Marino shares the hope of the international\r\ncommunity that the Palestinian Government will also\r\nfully respect its commitments and, by completely\r\nrejecting terrorism perpetrated by extremist groups,\r\nwill maintain and strengthen the dialogue and\r\nconstructive relations responsibly established with the\r\nIsraeli Government.\r\nWe welcome with great satisfaction the recent\r\nelections held in the new Afghanistan, now on its way\r\nto democracy and with a higher degree of freedom, as\r\nwell as the elections and approval of the new\r\nConstitution in Iraq, which we hope may lead to a real\r\ninstitutional, social and cultural rebirth of that country.\r\nWe cannot fail to address and stress the situation\r\nof women and children in our discussions on the\r\nconcerns to be addressed at the beginning of this\r\nMillennium and on the development of humankind.\r\nChildren, in particular, are most vulnerable to war and\r\nfamine and bear the brunt of adult actions and\r\ndecisions. Bombings and conflicts, malnutrition,\r\npoverty, treatable diseases, child labour and sexual\r\nabuse cause them great suffering and death. If people\r\nwere merely to stop and think of those children, many\r\nof the worst events in the world could be avoided.\r\nThis year, my country has undertaken a number\r\nof humanitarian initiatives in favour of children,\r\nmainly in Africa, with the support of our institutions.\r\nLet me mention, in that regard, the recent unanimous\r\ndecision of my Parliament in favour of programmes\r\nimproving childhood conditions in Uganda.\r\nPoverty and hunger are the prison in which many\r\nwomen eke out their existence, victims of injustice and\r\ndiscrimination. Our inability to free those women,\r\ndespite all the means available, is one of the major\r\nscandals of our day. At a time of economic well-being\r\nand progress, though not widespread, complicity with\r\nthat injustice through negligence or incapacity is\r\nunacceptable. The mass media now at our disposal do\r\nnot allow us to ignore that situation. The\r\nimplementation of Beijing and Beijing+5 is crucial to\r\ndemolishing the walls of that prison and to\r\nguaranteeing respect and development for the women\r\nof the twenty-first century.\r\nLast year, San Marino ratified the Convention on\r\nthe Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against\r\nWomen and, last June, Parliament approved accession\r\nto its Optional Protocol. I deposited our instruments of\r\naccession upon my arrival here in New York.\r\nMoreover, San Marino is tirelessly committed to\r\nsupporting women’s complete integration into and\r\nequality in its society.\r\nOn this occasion, I would express the hope that\r\nthe international community will strengthen its efforts\r\nto protect the environment and prevent natural\r\ndisasters. To that end, international cooperation is of\r\nthe utmost importance, and the Kyoto Protocol is a\r\nparticularly important instrument for our country.\r\nOn that subject, I wish to reiterate my country’s\r\ncondolences and solidarity to the people tragically\r\nstruck by natural disasters, such as those in South-East\r\nAsia some months ago and, more recently, along the\r\ncoasts of the Gulf of Mexico in the United States of\r\nAmerica.\r\nThe Millennium Development Goals, peace\r\nprocesses, fighting injustice and our many other great\r\nchallenges may seem impossible to face, but\r\nhumankind has the necessary resources and\r\n18\r\nA/60/PV.16\r\ninstruments to achieve those objectives and the United\r\nNations is one of the major tools at our disposal. I am\r\nconfident that the Organization will be up to that noble\r\ntask. To that end, I express my most sincere wishes to\r\nyou, Sir, to the Secretary-General and to all colleagues,\r\ndiplomats and officials who believe in the ideals of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Aboudou Soefo, Minister of State,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, Minister for Cooperation\r\nand Francophonie of the Comoros.\r\nMr. Soefo (Comoros) (spoke in French): Taking\r\nthe floor for the first time before this Assembly, it is\r\nmy genuine pleasure warmly to congratulate you, Sir,\r\non your election to the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly at its sixtieth session. Your election was a\r\npersonal honour to you and a recognition of the\r\ndiplomatic skills that we all acknowledge. It also\r\nenhances the prestigious image of your country. Please\r\nrest assured of the support of the Union of the\r\nComoros as you complete your exalted mission.\r\nYour predecessor, Mr. Jean Ping, deserves our full\r\nadmiration and congratulations on the effectiveness and\r\ndevotion with which he led the work of the fifty-ninth\r\nsession.\r\nI also wish to reiterate our confidence in\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan and above all to express\r\nour gratitude for his tireless commitment to establishing\r\na more just, peaceful and prosperous world.\r\nOur world faces challenges and threats that\r\njeopardize our security and prosperity. And yet, we\r\nhave also seen unprecedented technological and\r\nscientific development. That disparity highlights the\r\nstark reversal of our human values and of the basic\r\nprinciples of promoting peace, respect for human\r\ndignity and international solidarity.\r\nIs there any need to list the modern scourges that\r\nhave engulfed every region of the world: extremism,\r\nterrorism, ethnic cleansing and others? In addition to\r\nthat stark assessment of the state of the world — a\r\nresult of the failure of the human conscience — we\r\nhave also been struck by natural disasters, including\r\nfloods, hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions,\r\ntidal waves and, sadly, many others.\r\nTo cite just the most recent example, Hurricane\r\nKatrina, which devastated Louisiana, is a striking\r\nillustration of that phenomenon. Through me, the\r\nGovernment of the Union of the Comoros offers its\r\ndeep sympathy to the United States of America\r\nauthorities and the entire American people.\r\nLike the victims of natural disasters, the victims\r\nof violence and human injustice have no recourse other\r\nthan this Organization, entrusted with the most noble\r\nmission of defending and preserving their dignity. But\r\nthe Organization will need a new impetus to spur\r\ninternational action worthy of the expectations of our\r\npeoples.\r\nWe must therefore redefine our vision of world\r\nsecurity. We must keep the human being at the heart of\r\nour considerations and take every parameter of human\r\nsecurity into account. Indeed, there can be no lasting\r\npeace while poverty, disease, despair, war and\r\noppression persist. In a word, there can be no peace if\r\nwe are insecure about our daily lives and the future.\r\nThere is an ineluctable link between peace and the\r\ndevelopment to which we all aspire. We must therefore\r\nset ourselves a code of good behaviour and create a life\r\nin which the law reigns supreme.\r\nWe must reinvigorate and re-energize the United\r\nNations in order effectively to prepare it to face the\r\nproblems of the modern world. At the same time, the\r\ncomposition of its bodies should be as representative as\r\npossible so as to enshrine and embody its universality\r\nand safeguard the sovereign equality of States,\r\nespecially the smallest among them. As the supreme\r\nglobal institution, the United Nations should also\r\noperate on the basis of rules and norms recognized and\r\napproved by all, which will strengthen its credibility.\r\nOnly thus will we will truly be able to solve the\r\nproblems of terrorism, addressing them at their roots,\r\nand express our sympathy for and solidarity with those\r\nwho have devoted their entire lives to fighting\r\nexclusion and injustice.\r\nAt this very moment, I have a deeply considered\r\nthought for all those who have fought for noble causes\r\nthroughout the world. The brotherly people of\r\nPalestine offers a perfect illustration thereof. Indeed,\r\nthe aspirations of the Palestinian people are those of a\r\nnation reclaiming its dignity and security. In the\r\ninterests of all the peoples of the Middle East, the\r\npeace process must continue, because building and\r\nmaintaining peace is essential to our world. It is critical\r\nthat a Palestinian State be established and allowed to\r\nlive in peace, security and stability with the State of\r\nIsrael and its other neighbours.\r\n19\r\nA/60/PV.16\r\nMy country welcomes Israel’s withdrawal from\r\nthe Gaza Strip, a decisive step in the quest for a timely,\r\njust and equitable solution to that long drawn-out\r\nproblem. We are convinced that this gesture augurs\r\nwell for the region and peoples concerned.\r\nAs for Iraq, adequate conditions must be\r\nestablished to promote genuine progress towards\r\npeace, which will guarantee the stability necessary to\r\nthe country’s socio-economic development.\r\nThe situation in Asia also deserves the focused\r\nattention of the international community. The stalemate\r\nin the issue of the Chinese province of Taiwan, to cite\r\njust one instance, is not conducive to the promotion of\r\nstability in that part of the world. That is why, in its\r\nconcern for the ongoing prevalence of law in\r\ninternational relations, and in order to guarantee\r\nrespect for the national unity of countries, the Union of\r\nthe Comoros urges the General Assembly to heed the\r\nlegitimate claims of the Government of the People’s\r\nRepublic of China over the Chinese province of\r\nTaiwan.\r\nWith regard to Africa, we welcome the imminent\r\nsettlement of certain crises, including in the Republic\r\nof the Sudan, where current developments are opening\r\nthe prospects for effective national reconciliation. The\r\nGovernment of the Union of the Comoros encourages\r\nthe Sudanese parties to persevere along that path.\r\nAs to other crises that remain unresolved, we\r\nurge the international community to play a lead role in\r\nfinding solutions. Indeed, stability remains a\r\nparamount condition for the success of Africa’s\r\neconomic development efforts through the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development and other\r\nregional and international initiatives seeking the same\r\ngoal. Likewise, those efforts will remain inconclusive\r\nso long as HIV/AIDS, malaria, drepanocytosis and\r\nother diseases continue to rage in our countries. Other\r\nthreats include drought, famine, locust infestations,\r\nextreme poverty and the debt burden stifling the\r\neconomies of our countries. We therefore commend the\r\ninitiative of convening a summit to assess the\r\nMillennium Development Goals, which should allow\r\nfor the adoption of new arrangements for the\r\nachievement of the Goals by 2015.\r\nEnvironmental problems affect all States and are\r\na source of genuine concern to us all. Unbridled\r\npollution, the destruction of the ozone layer,\r\ndeforestation, rising sea levels — in a word, the\r\nceaseless deterioration of the environment — require\r\nus all to heighten our awareness of those global threats.\r\nAnd yet, while such problems may affect any\r\nnumber of States, we should recall that some — the\r\nsmall island developing States in particular — have\r\nspecific characteristics that must be taken into\r\nconsideration and addressed with greater attention. The\r\nUnion of the Comoros itself recently suffered a\r\nvolcanic eruption that severely damaged our\r\nenvironment. Such continuous threats to our countries\r\ncall for the timely establishment of mechanisms to\r\nprevent and manage natural disasters.\r\nWe welcome regional initiatives, including those\r\nundertaken by the Indian Ocean Commission, to better\r\nmanage such situations and we urge the international\r\ncommunity also to provide us with its invaluable\r\nassistance. I take this opportunity to thank the\r\nGovernment of France, the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme, and all other friendly\r\ncountries and specialized agencies of the United\r\nNations that have greatly helped us to grapple with and\r\nmanage that disaster.\r\nI spoke earlier of the inequalities prevalent in our\r\nworld. They are manifest at many levels, to be sure, but\r\nthe socio-economic aspect is the most glaring. Long\r\nmarginalized in world decision-making, our countries\r\nof the South continue to suffer the consequences of our\r\neconomic fragility. The rules of the game in world\r\ntrade exclude us de facto from the playing field.\r\nMoreover, the paucity of new information and\r\ncommunications technologies in the South is a striking\r\nreminder of the vast abyss in that field between our\r\ncountries and those of the North.\r\nDebt continues to burden many countries of the\r\nSouth, despite the fact that, thanks to a sudden surge of\r\ngenerosity and, above all, responsibility on the part of\r\nthe wealthy countries, some saw their situation\r\nrevisited and improved by the cancellation of their\r\ndebt. That only highlights the urgency of the need to\r\nassess the economic and financial situation of the\r\ncountries of the South in order for them to be\r\ngenuinely integrated into the dynamic of globalization.\r\nIf the disparities in and slow pace of the\r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals in\r\ngeneral are to be redressed, a world partnership is\r\nneeded. In that context, special attention must be paid\r\nto the least privileged social strata, including by\r\n20\r\nA/60/PV.16\r\nproviding access to financial services through the\r\npromotion of microfinancing and microcredit.\r\nFurthermore, we must address and objectively\r\nanalyse the issue of debt. We must prioritize the\r\ncancellation of the public debt of the heavily indebted\r\npoor countries, the least developed countries, and the\r\nlow- and medium-income developing countries.\r\nFinally, international action should promote a fair,\r\nregulated, open and non-discriminatory trading system,\r\nnotably by facilitating the developing countries’\r\naccession to the World Trade Organization.\r\nThe United Nations is an irreplaceable forum. As\r\nthe crucible of our warning cries and our hopes for a\r\nbetter world, it remains the perfect framework for\r\ndiscussing the world situation and for opening a\r\nwindow on the situation in each of our countries.\r\nWith respect to the Union of the Comoros, I am\r\npleased to announce from this rostrum that we have\r\ncompleted our establishment of new institutions, which\r\nare now operational. We thank everyone for their\r\nimportant contributions to that end. We now have the\r\ntwo-fold duty to consolidate the valuable achievements\r\nof national reconciliation and to promote our country’s\r\nsocio-economic development.\r\nWith our development partners, we are therefore\r\nstriving to reinvigorate our cooperation and redirect it\r\ntowards the well-being of our people. In the same vein,\r\nthe achievement of the Millennium Development Goals\r\nis a priority of the Government of the Union of the\r\nComoros.\r\nFurthermore, my country completed a staff-\r\nmonitored programme of the International Monetary\r\nFund in January 2005 and is working to streamline its\r\npublic finances with a view to concluding a Facility for\r\nPoverty Reduction and Growth programme with the\r\nBretton Woods institutions so as to mobilize the\r\nfinancial resources necessary to implementing its\r\ndevelopment priorities.\r\nIn that respect, the Comoros authorities are also\r\nattempting to implement a recommendation from the\r\ninternational community to convene a donors\r\nconference on our behalf. I therefore have the pleasure\r\nof informing the Assembly that such a meeting, critical\r\nto my country’s economic and social future, will be\r\nheld on 8 December in the Republic of Mauritius under\r\nthe auspices of the African Union. On behalf of my\r\ncountry, I call on the international community to help\r\nus to ensure the gathering’s success.\r\nI also take this pleasant opportunity warmly to\r\nthank the Republic of Mauritius for its generous offer\r\nto host that important conference. In particular, we thank\r\nMauritian Prime Minister Navinchandra Ramgoolam for\r\nhis readiness to co-preside the conference.\r\nIn the same vein, on behalf of the Government of\r\nthe Union of the Comoros, I pay a well-deserved\r\ntribute to the Republic of South Africa for its ongoing\r\nsupport for the Comoros and for having successfully\r\ncoordinated the efforts of the African Union and of\r\nregional countries to achieve national reconciliation in\r\nmy country. The people of the Comoros sincerely and\r\nhappily welcome the tireless interest of Mr. Thabo\r\nMbeki, President of the Republic of South Africa, in\r\nthe future of our country and his willingness to co-\r\npreside the donors conference.\r\nI cannot conclude without raising here the issue\r\nof the Comorian island of Mayotte. Following a series\r\nof consultations held between French and Comorian\r\nauthorities in their common concern to find a solution\r\nthat will preserve the friendship and cooperation\r\nbetween the two countries, safeguard the interests of\r\nboth States and satisfy the aspirations of the entire\r\npopulation of the archipelago, a new process has been\r\nlaunched. It will promote direct dialogue between the\r\ntwo parties with a view to finding a solution that\r\nprotects everyone’s interests in accordance with the\r\nlaw.\r\nThe Comorian Government has invested a great\r\ndeal of hope in the new dynamic. It believes that it can\r\ntrust the French Republic to strive for a joint and\r\nhonourable resolution of the situation. I therefore take\r\nthis opportunity to reaffirm my sincere thanks to all the\r\nfriends of the Comoros, who have never failed in their\r\nsupport, their encouragement and their solidarity with\r\nmy country in the quest for a solution to the issue in\r\nline with the law. I also wish to assure them, on behalf\r\nof the Government of the Union of the Comoros, that\r\nthey will always be kept up-to-date on developments in\r\nthe issue and, whenever necessary, involved in the\r\nprocess.\r\nWorking for peace means fighting all that fuels\r\nextremism and every source of frustration. Working for\r\npeace also means investing all necessary resources in\r\ndevelopment, without which humankind has no dignity.\r\nThe health of our world depends on our Organization.\r\n21\r\nA/60/PV.16\r\nLet us strive for its renewal, for more peace, for\r\nhappiness and for greater human dignity. Let us strive\r\nfor equal opportunity for all.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Bernard Rudolf Bot, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Netherlands.\r\nMr. Bot (Netherlands): It is my firm opinion that\r\nwe achieved important results at our summit. We\r\ncreated a peacebuilding commission and agreed to\r\nestablish a human rights council. We have good\r\nlanguage on development, including unanimous\r\nagreement on the Millennium Development Goals, and\r\nwe agreed on the responsibility to protect. We made\r\nprogress towards consensus on the fight against\r\nterrorism and agreed on some essential management\r\nand reform issues.\r\nSome have expressed disappointment about the\r\nresults of the summit and, indeed, not all of our\r\nambitions were achieved. Does that imply that it is\r\nwrong to be ambitious? Of course not. In a world\r\nsociety of 191 Member States, we must accept that the\r\nend result of negotiations will always reflect a\r\ncompromise between different ambitions, and that we\r\nhave to be tolerant of each other’s diverse views and\r\ninterests.\r\nAs regards my own country’s expectations, it is a\r\nmatter of concern that we did not agree on any\r\nmeasures to counter the proliferation of weapons of\r\nmass destruction — one of the greatest threats to\r\nhumankind. We had also hoped for more specific\r\nagreement on the modalities for the human rights\r\ncouncil and would have preferred clear parameters for\r\nthe use of force, as well as solid language on the\r\nInternational Criminal Court. And the Netherlands\r\nwould have liked to give the Secretary-General more\r\nscope to carry out his management responsibilities.\r\nBut all in all, we have made clear progress. So let\r\nus now agree to remain ambitious, to move forward\r\nwith implementing the programme we have agreed, and\r\nto allow the United Nations to deliver on our promises.\r\nI look forward to the outline of work the President of\r\nthis Assembly has announced, and I fully support the\r\naccountability pact with which the Secretary-General\r\nhas challenged us.\r\nWe have also achieved something else, something\r\nless apparent but equally important. We have\r\nreaffirmed our political and moral support for a\r\nfundamental underlying principle, namely, that we\r\nneed to build bridges through dialogue and cooperation\r\nand that we have to promote respect and tolerance. And\r\nwe all share the conviction that, in promoting respect\r\nand tolerance across the globe, the United Nations has\r\na central role to play.\r\nAccording to a well-known saying, there is only\r\none thing we cannot tolerate, and that is intolerance.\r\nIndeed, the struggle to protect tolerance from\r\nintolerance is one of the great challenges of our time.\r\nIt is in the interest of all States to take up the\r\nfight against radical ideologies that turn people into\r\nterrorists. Terrorism, as we all know, is a cross-border\r\nthreat. People of all persuasions and beliefs are its\r\ninnocent victims. And so we must respond collectively,\r\nboth to terrorism and to the radical ideologies that feed\r\nand breed it. Rwanda and the wars in the former\r\nYugoslavia are sharp reminders of how the political use\r\nof intolerant and racist rhetoric can even lead to\r\ngenocide or ethnic cleansing.\r\nStill, I do not believe there is or will be a clash of\r\ncivilizations. But there is a clash between the tolerant\r\nand the intolerant within and across our societies,\r\nwithin and across our civilizations.\r\nThat is why it is now so important to take on the\r\nradical ideologies that foster violent extremism.\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1624 (2005), calling on all\r\nStates to prohibit, by law, incitement to commit a\r\nterrorist act or acts, sends an important message to the\r\nhate-mongers.\r\nMr. Sambu (Guinea-Bissau), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nTo fight an effective battle against violent\r\nextremism and terrorism, we must strike a careful\r\nbalance between judicial and police measures, on the\r\none hand, and meaningful dialogue on the other. Let us\r\nlearn from each other in that respect. I believe that peer\r\nreview in the human rights council could, in future,\r\nhelp us all to maintain that careful balance.\r\nLet us invest in a global culture of tolerance and\r\nmutual respect. We must not look at cultural, religious\r\nand ideological differences as unbridgeable divides\r\nseparating adversaries. Instead, we should join forces\r\nfor a global society in which the quest for greater unity\r\ngoes hand in hand with respect for diversity.\r\n22\r\nA/60/PV.16\r\nThe best way for societies to protect tolerance is\r\nfor them to treasure their identity and, at the same\r\ntime, dare to reassess the validity of their prevailing\r\nnorms and standards. Recent events in the Netherlands,\r\nfor example, have confronted our society with the\r\nquestion of how to protect our centuries-old tradition\r\nof tolerance from those who would abuse it to sow\r\nhatred and division. That process of reflection is an\r\nongoing one, but part of the answer is to constantly\r\nremind ourselves that it is wrong to hold an entire\r\ncommunity accountable for the deeds of individuals.\r\nLet us all vow to protect tolerance from\r\nintolerance. Let us invest in mutual respect and try to\r\nchange the mindset of those who propagate intolerance\r\nand violent extremism. That will require permanent\r\ndialogue, with a central role for the United Nations, the\r\nonly truly global platform we possess.\r\nSerious dialogue can also help to clear up\r\nmisunderstandings. One of the most striking\r\nmisunderstandings concerns the nature of secularism,\r\nby which I mean the separation of State and religious\r\ninstitutions. That separation protects the freedom of all\r\ncitizens of all religious backgrounds, as well as of\r\npeople who do not practice any religion. In the\r\nNetherlands, as elsewhere, politicians and political\r\nparties may be inspired by religion, as long as the\r\ninstitutions remain separate.\r\nThat is precisely why, in my country and across\r\nthe European continent, there is a place for Islam, just\r\nas there is a place for other religions. There is a place\r\nfor any form of Islam that allows believers to be both\r\nMuslims and citizens of a democratic society.\r\nCitizenship means more than just holding a\r\npassport. True citizenship calls for an active\r\ncontribution to the society of which one is a part. It\r\nalso calls for a society that is open to the many and\r\nvaried contributions of all its citizens. Radical\r\nideologies that push people to isolate themselves from\r\nthe rest of society and to reject or even attack the spirit\r\nof democracy will run up against our determined\r\nrefusal to give even one inch, in my country and, I\r\nhope, everywhere. For intolerance is a global, cross-\r\nborder phenomenon, which is why we so urgently need\r\nthe United Nations at our side.\r\nUnited Nations reform will mean making good on\r\nour promises. It will require determined\r\nimplementation of the plans and proposals we have\r\nagreed on. If we are serious about our effort to build a\r\nmore humane, dignified and just world, United Nations\r\nreform must also strengthen the protection of tolerance\r\nfrom intolerance.\r\nIn our fast-changing world, people long for safety\r\nand certainty, and that is understandable. But leaders\r\nall over the world have a duty to explain that narrow\r\nworldviews, with no place for differences, can offer no\r\ngenuine protection. Without respect for diversity, there\r\ncan be no unity.\r\nIf we want to protect tolerance from intolerance,\r\nwe should look critically at what we teach our children.\r\nHow can we expect them to become tolerant adults if\r\nthey learn in school to despise people of other faiths\r\nand ethnicities? It is not enough for Governments to do\r\npolite business with other Governments; they should,\r\nat the same time, not allow hotbeds of intolerance to\r\nexist in their societies.\r\nThere is an old saying that we reap what we sow.\r\nIf we wish to reap a harvest of tolerance and mutual\r\nrespect, and foster a sense of common purpose, then\r\nwe must set to work now. Let us begin sowing the\r\nseeds of tolerance and mutual respect here at the\r\nUnited Nations, the world’s main crossroads of\r\ncivilizations.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now\r\ngive the floor to Her Excellency Mrs. Fatoumata Kaba-\r\nSidibé, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Guinea.\r\nMrs. Kaba-Sidibé (Guinea) (spoke in French):\r\nAllow me at the outset, on behalf of my delegation,\r\nwarmly to congratulate Mr. Eliasson on his outstanding\r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at\r\nits sixtieth session. My country, Guinea, assures him of\r\nits full cooperation as he carries out his important\r\nmission.\r\nI also pay well-deserved tribute to his\r\npredecessor, Mr. Jean Ping, for the competence,\r\neffectiveness and devotion with which he led the work\r\nof the fifty-ninth session.\r\nI am also pleased to convey to Secretary-General\r\nKofi Annan the deep appreciation, encouragement and\r\nsupport of Mr. Lansana Conté, President of the\r\nRepublic, for his tireless and praiseworthy work.\r\nThe summit meeting at this session of the General\r\nAssembly has substantially stiffened our common\r\nresolve to promote international peace and security, the\r\nrule of law and the right to development. The\r\n23\r\nA/60/PV.16\r\nassessment of the implementation of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals and the renewed commitment of\r\nStates Members to achieving them are cause for hope.\r\nThe Republic of Guinea nevertheless remains\r\nconvinced that if we are better to meet the threats and\r\nchallenges we face, we must resolutely pursue the\r\nreforms necessary to revitalize our Organization.\r\nIn the name of peace and security, the concerted\r\nand decisive action of the United Nations system and\r\nof regional and subregional organizations, the African\r\nUnion in particular, has made significant progress in\r\nrecent months.\r\nIn West Africa, and especially in the Mano River\r\nbasin, hopes for peace are gradually growing after\r\nyears of turbulence and tragedy.\r\nIn Liberia, the political and institutional rebirth\r\nunder way is encouraging, although many obstacles\r\nstill hinder national reconciliation and the country’s\r\neconomic revival. It is essential that, in order to\r\npreserve their legitimacy and fairness, we do\r\neverything possible to prevent October’s elections from\r\nbeing manipulated by the forces of destabilization. We\r\ntherefore call on the international community to give\r\nthat country the assistance necessary to seeing the\r\ntransition through and launching its own\r\nreconstruction.\r\nIn Sierra Leone, the process of national\r\nreconciliation is continuing, thereby promoting\r\npeacebuilding and development. My delegation\r\nbelieves that adequate financing for the Special Court\r\nfor Sierra Leone and the transfer of all persons\r\npresumed guilty of serious crimes under international\r\nlaw are prerequisites for putting an end to impunity and\r\nconsolidate subregional stability.\r\nAs concerns Guinea-Bissau, my country\r\nwelcomes the smooth holding of the presidential\r\nelections, which herald a positive new era that will be\r\nconducive to national reconciliation and a return to\r\nconstitutional order.\r\nIn Côte d’Ivoire, the signing of the Pretoria\r\nAgreement on 6 April 2005 has given rise to real hopes\r\nthat the crisis can be resolved. However, recent\r\ndevelopments are a source of concern to us. Our\r\nGovernment calls on all parties concerned to spare no\r\neffort to promote a political settlement of the conflict,\r\nsince peace and stability in the subregion hinge on this.\r\nIn Burundi, major progress has been made in the\r\npeace process, particularly through the holding of\r\nlegislative and presidential elections in free, fair and\r\npeaceful conditions. Guinea welcomes this and calls on\r\nour brothers in Burundi to continue on the path to\r\nnational reconciliation and reconstruction.\r\nIn the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where\r\nthe transitional period is at a decisive stage, problems\r\npersist in the eastern part of the country. My country\r\nencourages all parties to abide by the relevant\r\nprovisions of the comprehensive agreement.\r\nIn the Sudan, despite the sad death of Vice-\r\nPresident Garang, the establishment of a national unity\r\nGovernment and the political will shown by the various\r\nprotagonists will help to defuse tensions.\r\nGuinea urges all parties in Darfur to pursue the\r\nnegotiations that have begun under the auspices of the\r\nAfrican Union with a view to achieving a\r\ncomprehensive, consensus-based solution.\r\nIn the Horn of Africa, Somalia has reached a\r\ndecisive stage with the creation of a Transitional\r\nFederal Government. My delegation makes an urgent\r\nappeal to the various factions to engage in negotiations\r\nwith the Government in order to reach a\r\ncomprehensive peace agreement.\r\nRegarding the Ethiopia-Eritrea dispute, we call\r\non both parties fully to respect the Algiers Accord and\r\nto implement the Boundary Commission’s decision.\r\nAs to the situation in the Western Sahara, Guinea\r\nsupports a negotiated and mutually acceptable solution.\r\nIt encourages the parties concerned to enhance their\r\ncooperation with the Special Representative of the\r\nSecretary-General.\r\nConcerning the Middle East, our Government\r\nwelcomes Israel’s withdrawal from the Gaza Strip.\r\nHowever, we remain concerned by the occupation of\r\nthe West Bank, the continued illegal construction of the\r\nseparation wall and the continuing detention of\r\nPalestinian political prisoners.\r\nThat is why we appeal to the two parties to\r\nrespect the relevant resolutions of the General\r\nAssembly and of the Security Council, as well as the\r\nQuartet road map. This is the only way to bring about\r\nthe creation of two States — Palestine and Israel —\r\nliving side by side in safety and security within secure\r\nand recognized boundaries.\r\n24\r\nA/60/PV.16\r\nIn Iraq, despite the holding of legislative\r\nelections that led to the establishment of a transitional\r\nGovernment, we cannot but deplore the current climate\r\nof daily violence. We agree that everything should be\r\ndone to help the country’s leaders to consolidate the\r\npolitical transition, put an end to indiscriminate\r\nviolence and build a united, democratic and prosperous\r\nIraq.\r\nWith regard to Asia, our Government reaffirms its\r\nbelief in the principle of one China. We also attach\r\nimportance to the peaceful and independent\r\nreunification of the two Koreas as well as to ongoing\r\nefforts to maintain peace, security and stability on the\r\nKorean peninsula.\r\nMy delegation notes with profound concern the\r\nresurgence of terrorist activities throughout the world.\r\nWe strongly condemn terrorism in all its forms and in\r\nall its manifestations, for it constitutes one of the most\r\nserious threats to international peace and security. We\r\nexpress solidarity with all States that have fallen victim\r\nto it.\r\nTo eradicate that scourge, my delegation\r\nreaffirms the need to tackle with determination its root\r\ncauses, including injustice, exclusion, poverty and the\r\nintensification of social divisions.\r\nWe welcome the adoption by the Assembly on\r\n13 April 2005 of the resolution on the International\r\nConvention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear\r\nTerrorism, and we urge Member States to reach\r\nagreement on a comprehensive convention on\r\nterrorism.\r\nThe seventh Review Conference of the Parties to\r\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons and the Second Biennial Meeting of States to\r\nConsider the Implementation of the Programme of\r\nAction to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit\r\nTrade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its\r\nAspects, which were held, respectively, in May and\r\nJuly 2005, shows the concern of States parties to do\r\nmore to address disarmament-related problems.\r\nHowever, we note and deplore the fact that the\r\nStates parties to the Treaty have not yet succeeded in\r\nreaching consensus on questions of substance. Hence\r\nwe urge all States to continue negotiations in order to\r\nstrengthen the international non-proliferation regime.\r\nWith regard to combating the proliferation and\r\nillicit trade in small arms and light weapons, Guinea\r\nhas resolutely undertaken to eradicate that scourge and\r\nwelcomes the adoption of a draft instrument for the\r\ntracing of such weapons.\r\nWe invite the donor community to provide\r\nappropriate support for the implementation of the\r\nsubregional programme of the Economic Community\r\nof West African States (ECOWAS). The initiative to\r\ntransform the ECOWAS moratorium into a binding\r\nlegal instrument merits due consideration by Member\r\nStates.\r\nAware of the importance that peoples attach to\r\ndevelopment goals, of the latter’s interdependence and\r\nof what is at stake, the Government of Guinea has\r\nadopted a national poverty-reduction strategy whose\r\nimplementation has, regrettably, been compromised by\r\nexternal factors linked to rebel attacks, a massive\r\ninflux of refugees and regional instability.\r\nMy delegation appeals urgently to all\r\ndevelopment partners to support Guinea in its efforts to\r\nimplement that strategy, which remains the most\r\ncertain way of achieving the Millennium Development\r\nGoals. In that connection, we welcome the recent\r\nprogress made in the framework of poverty reduction,\r\nparticularly the commitment of the G-8 to double\r\nofficial development assistance (ODA) over the next\r\nfew years and immediate debt cancellation for the 18\r\nmost indebted poor countries. We commend and\r\nendorse all other initiatives designed to increase funds\r\nfor ODA. We express the hope that the Gleneagles\r\ninitiative, which represents an important step forward\r\nin the right direction, will be translated into reality and\r\nwill be extended to all least developed countries.\r\nFurthermore, in the context of the current World\r\nTrade Organization trade negotiations, we urge\r\nMember States to show a spirit of compromise and\r\ndiligence in order to overcome their differences and\r\ncome to an understanding on a consensus programme\r\nfor the implementation of the Doha Development\r\nAgenda before the sixth Hong Kong Ministerial\r\nConference. What is at stake is the very future of the\r\nmultilateral trading system.\r\nOur work is taking place following the High-level\r\nPlenary Meeting, as a consequence of which our\r\nleaders have adopted an outcome document to guide\r\nour actions. The decisions and commitments taken at\r\nthe summit clearly indicate that a new era has begun.\r\nThe time for promises has passed, and we must now\r\ntranslate our commitments into concrete action in a\r\n25\r\nA/60/PV.16\r\nspirit of true solidarity between developed and\r\ndeveloping countries, on the basis of a far-reaching\r\nreform of our Organization.\r\nBy so doing, we will leave to future generations,\r\nto which we owe a debt, the right tools to lead\r\nhumankind towards a better future.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I give\r\nthe floor to His Excellency Mr. José Ramos-Horta,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Timor-\r\nLeste.\r\nMr. Ramos-Horta (Timor-Leste): Because of the\r\nconstraints on our time, I shall omit several paragraphs\r\nof my statement, the full text of which has been\r\ndistributed to delegations.\r\nThe President, the Prime Minister and the people\r\nof Timor-Leste have conveyed to the people and the\r\nGovernment of the United States our profound\r\nsympathy for the people of the Gulf states, in particular\r\nthe people of the city of New Orleans, who were the\r\nvictims of Hurricane Katrina. President George W.\r\nBush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice have\r\nspoken touching words of gratitude in recognition of\r\nthe outpouring of sympathy from so many nations. We\r\nmust remember that the United States Administration\r\nand the American people were among the first and\r\nmost generous to respond to the tsunami tragedy that\r\nbefell the peoples living on the borders of the Indian\r\nOcean on 26 December last year.\r\nOnly a little more than three years ago, the\r\nSecretary-General, Kofi Annan, handed over power to\r\nour elected President. Since then, we have made real\r\nprogress in nation-building, peacebuilding, economic\r\ndevelopment, national reconciliation and enhancing\r\nrelations with our neighbours. Timor-Leste has acceded\r\nto the seven main international human rights\r\ninstruments, and my Government is committed to\r\nfulfilling its obligations. We were among the first in\r\nthe world to pioneer a streamlined treaty reporting\r\nprocedure. We are currently drafting our first reports,\r\nand all Government agencies are participating in that\r\nexercise. The internal political and security situation,\r\nincluding our porous common land borders, is peaceful\r\nand stable. A recent report of the World Bank,\r\ncommenting on the general situation of peace and\r\nstability in my country, stated,\r\n“Most countries emerging from conflict ... relapse\r\ninto violence within five years. Timor-Leste has\r\navoided that fate, maintained peace and political\r\nstability, and established security”.\r\nAs a result of the unexpectedly high prices of oil\r\nand gas, Timor-Leste today enjoys a surplus, which has\r\nenabled our Government to increase our public\r\nexpenditure by 30 per cent during the current fiscal\r\nyear. That increase will benefit mostly the rural\r\npopulation and the poorest. In addition, we are proud to\r\nreport that 36 per cent of our national budget is\r\nallocated to education and health.\r\nWe have fostered the best possible relationships\r\nwith our neighbours. At of the end of July, we became\r\nthe twenty-fifth member of the Regional Forum of the\r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN); our\r\nnext goal is ASEAN membership. We enjoy special\r\nobserver status in the Pacific Islands Forum. Without\r\nthe active involvement of our regional and\r\ninternational friends, the leadership and coordinating\r\nrole of the United Nations and the engagement of its\r\nmany agencies, of the Bretton Woods institutions and\r\nof the Asian Development Bank, we would not have\r\nbeen able to achieve the impressive progress we have\r\nmade thus far.\r\nWith regard to truth and reconciliation, I shall\r\nnow address the issue of justice. In an effort to uncover\r\nthe truth about the events of 1999, the Governments of\r\nTimor-Leste and Indonesia have established a joint\r\ncommission on truth and friendship. The commission is\r\nmandated to examine serious acts of violence that\r\noccurred in the period before, during and after the 30\r\nAugust 1999 popular consultations sponsored by the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nWe are accused in some quarters of being too\r\npreoccupied with forging close relations with\r\nIndonesia, to the detriment of justice for past abuses,\r\nand in doing so of encouraging impunity. To our\r\naccusers, we say the following. We are mindful of the\r\nneed to accord dignity and respect to the victims of\r\npast abuses, and we believe that in the pursuit of\r\njustice we must be sensitive to the need to establish a\r\nbalance between comprehensive justice and national\r\nreconciliation in order to avoid perpetuating the\r\ndivisions of the past and risking the exacerbation of\r\nexisting cleavages in our society. We believe that our\r\nfirst obligation, as a responsible member of the\r\ninternational community, is to build a peaceful, stable,\r\ndemocratic and prosperous country. By consolidating\r\nnation-building, internal peace and stability and\r\n26\r\nA/60/PV.16\r\nunshackling our people from poverty, we can\r\ncontribute to wider peace and stability.\r\nIf one were to read the aforementioned World\r\nBank report on the developments in my country, one\r\nwould reach the same upbeat conclusion about the\r\nimpressive gains that we have attained in only three\r\nyears. Let me share with members some additional\r\nfindings:\r\n“Timor-Leste, the world’s newest nation,\r\nwas created out of ashes ... Given that the country\r\nstarted from scratch both physically and\r\ninstitutionally, Timor-Leste has done remarkably\r\nwell”.\r\nWe have developed a model Petroleum Fund legal\r\nand policy regime, which we took directly to the\r\npeople and to the National Parliament for approval. We\r\ndo not want Timor-Leste to fall prey to the developing\r\nnations’ so-called resource curse, whereby God-given\r\nresources are squandered. The key principle is that\r\nonly the sustainable income from our petroleum wealth\r\nwill be available for current expenditure. Commenting\r\non our Petroleum Fund, the World Bank said that\r\nTimor-Leste\r\n“has adopted a state-of-the-art legal framework\r\nfor on- and off-shore petroleum production and\r\ntaxation and a draft savings policy and associated\r\nPetroleum Fund Act consistent with the\r\nExtractive Industries Transparency Initiative\r\n(EITI) ... having embraced transparency\r\nprinciples even before EITI existed ... True to\r\nstated principles, the Government has adhered to\r\na provisional savings policy for petroleum\r\nrevenues ahead of the adoption of the permanent\r\nsavings policy”.\r\nI should now like to touch upon the theme of\r\nUnited Nations reform. As we observe the current news\r\ncoverage surrounding the oil-for-food scandal, with the\r\nUnited Nations painted as the villain, we are certainly\r\ndisappointed that the Organization we idealize is\r\ntainted by allegations of corruption.\r\nIn peacekeeping and conflict prevention, we must\r\nremember that while the Secretary-General has the\r\nresponsibility to alert the Security Council to ongoing\r\nor potential conflicts that may threaten international\r\npeace and security, the ultimate decision to act rests\r\nwith the Security Council, in particular the five\r\npermanent members. The role of the United Nations in\r\nthe world has not, however, been limited to\r\npeacekeeping; it has provided facilities and an\r\nenvironment for informal meetings between parties in\r\nconflict, it has mediated hostage situations or border\r\ndisputes, and it has mobilized resources and\r\ncoordinated assistance to war-torn countries or to\r\ncommunities affected by natural disasters.\r\nWhile we all agree that our collective\r\nOrganization has failed at times, those shortcomings\r\nand failures should not obscure its virtues and\r\nsuccesses. The United Nations can become more\r\neffective if regional bodies do their share in addressing\r\nthe challenges in their respective regions.\r\nMuch has been said and written about the need\r\nfor a thorough review of the United Nations system,\r\nand much of the debate has been focused on the\r\nSecurity Council, overshadowing all other issues,\r\nincluding the much-needed reform of the General\r\nAssembly itself. Reform is also urgent in regard to the\r\nexisting human rights system. The proliferation of\r\ntreaty bodies and agenda items results in a morass of\r\nduplication, waste, inefficiency and loss of focus.\r\nThe General Assembly remains the prime organ\r\nof the United Nations that brings together all nations,\r\nrich and poor, large and small. The endless and\r\nrepetitive yearly general debate and agenda must be\r\nreviewed in order to shorten it and make it more\r\nfocused.\r\nI now turn to the Commission on Human Rights.\r\nNo country or group has a monopoly on selectivity. We\r\nare all good practitioners, focusing our attention on\r\nissues that are often remote from our shores or that do\r\nnot collide with friendships, alliances or interests.\r\nTimor-Leste fully endorses the establishment of a\r\nHuman Rights Council and is prepared to serve in such\r\na body if we are asked to do so.\r\nTimor-Leste strongly supports the creation of a\r\nPeacebuilding Commission, which will play a critical\r\nrole in post-conflict situations. The merits are sui\r\ngeneris. In view of our unique and rich experience,\r\nTimor-Leste would be pleased to serve on that new\r\nbody if our friends believe we can be useful there.\r\nThere is agreement that the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil must be reformed. It seems to duplicate or add\r\nlittle value to its subsidiary bodies. We do not support\r\nexpanding the Council’s mandate to include managing\r\nUnited Nations post-conflict activities.\r\n27\r\nA/60/PV.16\r\nA permanent member of the Security Council\r\nshould not limit its peacekeeping contributions to\r\neloquent rhetoric while refraining from providing the\r\ntroops necessary to back up its words. We are all\r\ncapable of delivering eloquent speeches with apparent\r\nmoral force, but we do not all have the same political\r\nwill, courage or raw power to match our words.\r\nAspiring Security Council members, permanent and\r\nnon-permanent alike, should be countries with stable and\r\nopen political systems and with effective credible national\r\nleaderships that inspire trust and respect in their\r\nrespective regions and throughout the world as a whole.\r\nMy Government holds the view that regional\r\nbalance remains a sine-qua-non principle as should\r\nrepresentation of civilizations. Asia, which contains\r\nhalf of the world’s population, is grossly\r\nunderrepresented in the United Nations system and will\r\nremain so, even with the possible addition of India and\r\nJapan. Timor-Leste supports the G-4 initiative, because\r\nwe believe that the four countries concerned fulfil\r\nevery reasonable qualifying criterion for permanent\r\nmembership in the Security Council.\r\nTimor-Leste, which has an overwhelmingly\r\nCatholic majority population, is proud to have been the\r\nfirst country to draw the attention of this body to the\r\nneed to insure that the Muslim world be adequately\r\nrepresented in an expanded Security Council. We\r\ncontinue to believe that Indonesia, the world’s largest\r\nMuslim country, with the third largest population in\r\nour region and the third largest Asian democracy, is\r\nuniquely suited for permanent member status.\r\nI wish now to touch on an issue that has been\r\nvery much in the news in the last few months: Japan\r\nand its neighbours. Timor-Leste understands the\r\nreservations of certain countries that do not wish to see\r\ntoo large a Security Council; we understand the\r\nreluctance of some of the current permanent five to\r\nabandon or share privileges with new ones. We\r\nunderstand that countries that were invaded and\r\ncolonized by Japan during the Second World War are\r\nnot receptive to their former aggressor. Timor-Leste,\r\ntoo, was occupied by Japan during the Second World\r\nWar. But we also remember how the proud Japanese\r\npeople were made to pay an extraordinary price for\r\ntheir Second World War sins. Hiroshima stands as the\r\nliving reminder of that horrible price.\r\nJapanese leaders were brought to trial at the\r\nInternational Military Tribunal for the Far East and\r\npaid for their crimes. A defeated Japan was effectively\r\noccupied and administered by the victorious American\r\nPower. This benign occupier charted the course of the\r\nnew Japan, which today is a world economic Power, a\r\npeaceful and vibrant democracy that has made\r\nenormous contributions to the well-being of developing\r\ncountries and the United Nations system.\r\nAllow me now to share with the Assembly my\r\nGovernment’s concern on some key international\r\nissues — the Middle East, Afghanistan and Iraq.\r\nFirst, we commend Israeli Prime Minister Ariel\r\nSharon for his courage in disengaging from Gaza. We\r\nhope that this is only a first step towards the full\r\nimplementation of the road map leading to the\r\nestablishment of a democratic Palestinian State. The\r\nnew Palestinian leaders and people deserve equal\r\npraise for their moderation and statesmanship, patience\r\nand tolerance.\r\nIn Iraq and Afghanistan, local extremist elements\r\nand foreign mercenaries continue their campaign of\r\nterror to reverse the democratic gains made by the\r\npeople of the two countries. The international\r\ncommunity and, in particular, the neighbouring\r\ncountries, have a special duty to provide all necessary\r\nsupport to the brave peoples of Afghanistan and Iraq in\r\ntheir struggle to consolidate their hard-won freedoms;\r\nthe neighbouring countries must do more to prevent\r\ntheir territories from being used as springboards for the\r\ninfiltration of mercenaries and weapons into\r\nAfghanistan and Iraq.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now\r\ncall on The Honourable Laurie Chan, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Solomon Islands.\r\nMr. Chan (Solomon Islands): I bring warm\r\ngreetings, Sir, from the Government and people of\r\nSolomon Islands, and I wish to congratulate the\r\nPresident on his election to lead the General Assembly\r\nat its sixtieth session. I would like to assure him of\r\nSolomon Islands’ support and cooperation during his\r\nterm in office as he guides the work of the Assembly\r\nover the next 12 months.\r\nMy delegation would also like to commend and\r\nregister its deep appreciation to his predecessor, our\r\ncolleague, the Honourable Jean Ping, Foreign Minister\r\nof Gabon, for his invaluable contribution and able\r\nleadership of the proceedings of fifty-ninth session of\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\n28\r\nA/60/PV.16\r\nSolomon Islands also extends its gratitude to\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan for his vision,\r\ndedication and leadership in making the United\r\nNations relevant and responsive to today’s threats.\r\nThis Organization rose out of the ashes of the\r\nSecond World War with the sole purpose of ensuring\r\nthat never again would the world allow crimes against\r\nhumanity to flourish. Sixty years on, genocide,\r\nterrorism, HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and hunger\r\ncontinue to claim millions of lives annually. According\r\nto a recent World Health Organization report,\r\npreventable disease, such as malaria, claims more lives\r\nthan today’s conflicts put together. Of 300 to 500\r\nmillion clinical cases annually, 1.5 to 2.7 million lives\r\nare lost. In this connection, Solomon Islands suffers\r\nhigher rates of malaria and maternal mortality than any\r\nother country in the Pacific region. My delegation is\r\npleased to see the summit agree on the establishment\r\nand implementation of “quick win” initiatives, such as\r\nfree distribution of treated bed nets and antimalarial\r\nmedicines. But more needs to be done; a\r\ncomprehensive malaria eradication programme on\r\npublic and environmental health must be initiated and\r\nimplemented simultaneously.\r\nDespite these overwhelming facts, the world\r\ncontinues to spend even more on military programmes\r\nand equipment. The lack of progress on disarmament\r\nand non-proliferation, with the continuing threat of\r\nterrorism, begs the question as to whether the world\r\nhas indeed become safer, more stable and protected, as\r\nthe founders of the United Nations Charter envisioned.\r\nIt further raises the question whether international\r\nframeworks and cooperation agreements have, in fact,\r\ncontained today’s threats.\r\nSolomon Islands condemns terrorism in all its\r\nforms. In this regard, we are embarking on a legislative\r\nprocess, with New Zealand’s support, to increase our\r\nnational capacity in enhancing regional security\r\narrangements through the Nasonini Declaration on\r\nRegional Security and the Honiara Declaration on Law\r\nEnforcement Cooperation, particularly as concerns\r\nthreats posed by international terrorism and\r\ntransnational crimes.\r\nIn keeping with this year’s theme, “For a stronger\r\nand more effective United Nations: the follow-up and\r\nimplementation of the High-level Plenary Meeting in\r\nSeptember 2005”, we are faced with the challenge of\r\ncontinuing the reform process. As my Prime Minister\r\npointed out last week during the high-level summit, we\r\nmust not solve today’s problems with yesterday’s\r\nsolutions, but rather with a new vision that will build a\r\nstronger multilateral system to confront threats and\r\nchallenges in the twenty-first century. Solomon Islands\r\nnotes and supports the Summit Outcome (resolution\r\n60/1) as a starting point for change.\r\nCurrent reforms to rejuvenate the multilateral\r\nsystem must occur at three levels — international,\r\nregional and national. The forthcoming Doha process,\r\nbeginning in December of this year, will provide\r\nanother opportunity for the international community to\r\nequitably spread the fruits of globalization, take to task\r\nthe imbalance that exists within the economic\r\ninternational system and address the challenges of\r\nvulnerable and fragile States. The Doha development\r\nagenda must accord stable and predictable market\r\naccess to all least developed countries’ products,\r\ntechnology transfer and human resources development.\r\nFor Solomon Islands to share the fruits of the\r\nmultilateral trading system in a meaningful way, it\r\nmust first address the domestic bottlenecks that impede\r\nits full participation, such as supply-side restraints and\r\nother “behind-the-door” complementary policies that\r\nare not conducive to a business-friendly environment.\r\nThe Brussels Declaration and the Programme for\r\nAction for the Least Developed Countries will be\r\nreviewed beginning next year. The lack of\r\nimplementation of the Brussels Programme speaks of\r\nthe international community’s commitment to 700\r\nmillion of the world’s most vulnerable persons.\r\nSolomon Islands is off track in terms of meeting its\r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) obligation;\r\nhowever, as a least developed country in the Asia/\r\nPacific region, it is committed to meeting its MDGs\r\nand seeks international support and attention in this\r\nendeavour. Poverty has no boundaries, and we\r\nacknowledge and support the Jakarta Declaration. For\r\nthe MDGs and other benefits to be realized and\r\nsustained, Solomon Islands will need to grow its\r\neconomy. Solomon Islands also calls for a greater in-\r\ncountry presence on the part of the United Nations to\r\nwork in partnership with us to meet the Goals.\r\nSolomon Islands supports the proposal to\r\nestablish the Peacebuilding Commission. The\r\nCommission will play a difficult and important role in\r\nassisting countries that are emerging from conflict\r\nsituations to reintegrate, reconstruct and rebuild State\r\ninstitutions in order to maintain peace, security and\r\n29\r\nA/60/PV.16\r\neconomic stability. In that light, the Regional\r\nAssistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI) is\r\na shining example from which the Commission could\r\ndraw lessons. It has demonstrated that, with courage\r\nand determination, the principles and institutions of\r\ndemocracy and human rights can be safeguarded and\r\nprotected. A two-pronged approach of law and order\r\ncomplemented by economic security and carried out in\r\nthe spirit of true partnership will create an opportunity\r\nfor peace to prosper. Solomon Islands also welcomes\r\nthe Assembly’s endorsement of the concept of the\r\nresponsibility to protect populations from genocide, war\r\ncrimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity, as\r\ncontained in the summit’s outcome document.\r\nSolomon Islands would like to express its deep\r\nappreciation to Australia, New Zealand and our good\r\nfriends and neighbours, the Pacific Island countries for\r\ntheir continued support and contribution to Regional\r\nAssistance Mission. We could not have done it without\r\nthem, and I thank them.\r\nSolomon Islands needs to progress beyond the\r\ninitial crisis of law and order, but the challenge\r\nremains to nurture the country and build an economy to\r\nsustain it. Per capita income in Solomon Islands has\r\ncurrently dropped to more than 20 per cent below the\r\n1995 level. To repair that situation, Solomon Islands\r\nmust address harmful past policies of economic\r\nmismanagement, a lack of fiscal discipline, faulty\r\ngovernance and capacity constraints at all levels.\r\nSolomon Islands is well endowed with natural\r\nresources and a young population that can form the\r\nbasis of a good labour supply, but it lacks both human\r\ncapital and physical capital, with poor infrastructure to\r\nlift productivity and deliver sustainable growth that is\r\nbroad-based, rurally focused and people-centred.\r\nThat is why the Government is initiating a\r\nstrategy to attract and build capital. The strategy hinges\r\non establishing a stable macroeconomic environment,\r\ncreating simple business-friendly tax and regulatory\r\nregimes and improving infrastructure and good\r\ngovernance. With respect to establishing a credible\r\nfiscal policy, we have returned the budget to surpluses.\r\nRevenues have been enhanced. Expenditures have been\r\ntightened and prioritized. Monetary policies are being\r\nfine-tuned and aligned. State-owned enterprises\r\ncontinue to be reformed, with steps taken to remove\r\nbarriers and improve efficient shipping networks,\r\nwhich are critical for island nations. Those initiatives\r\nwill be coupled with a new draft investment law, a\r\ncredible budget for 2006 and the introduction of a fair\r\nand simple tax reform bill, which will be submitted to\r\nthe Parliament at its next sitting.\r\nDebt levels remain crippling, amounting to more\r\nthan 100 per cent of the gross domestic product of the\r\nSolomon Islands. Talks with creditors have begun to\r\nestablish a workable debt strategy. The innovative\r\napproach advocated by the Philippines of a debt-for-\r\nequity swap to finance MDG projects is worth looking\r\ninto.\r\nCapacity-building in governance that is free from\r\ncorruption is vital for rural development, health and\r\neducation. Leadership and governance, which are\r\ncritical for stability and economic development, are\r\nbeing improved by clarifying rules and expectations\r\nand by adopting an outcome-oriented approach. That\r\nwill improve the transparency of public processes and\r\nthe effectiveness of institutions.\r\nSolomon Islands acknowledges the contributions\r\nof Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Japan,\r\nthe European Union, Taiwan, the Asian Development\r\nBank and the World Bank, among other donor partners,\r\nin support of Government initiatives to rebuild our\r\nfragile and shattered State. Solomon Islands must\r\nconsolidate the gains achieved in the past two years on\r\nthe security and economic fronts and move forward\r\nconstructively. Much is yet to be done.\r\nOn climate change, the world continues to\r\nexperience changing weather patterns and has seen an\r\nincrease in the frequency and intensity of natural\r\ndisasters. Small island developing States (SIDS), such\r\nas Solomon Islands, are more vulnerable and\r\nsusceptible to natural disasters, and we call for the\r\ninternational community to renew its focus on, and\r\nconcrete commitment to, the issue of climate change,\r\nin line with the summit’s outcome document. My\r\ndelegation welcomes the entry into force of the Kyoto\r\nProtocol in February this year and calls on those\r\ncountries that have not yet ratified the Protocol to do\r\nso at their earliest convenience.\r\nIn the light of the Asian tsunami of last\r\nDecember, it would be cost-effective for the world to\r\ninvest in mitigation measures, in particular renewable\r\nenergy resources. The Hyogo strategy of the Kobe\r\nConference and the Mauritius Strategy of January this\r\nyear provide an excellent starting point. Sadly,\r\nhowever, the Group of Eight meeting on climate\r\n30\r\nA/60/PV.16\r\nchange did not take decisive action. For that reason,\r\nSolomon Islands, as a member of the Alliance of Small\r\nIsland States, urges the Group of Eight to reconsider\r\nthe issue, because the environment has an impact on\r\nthe physical survival of small island developing States.\r\nCloser to home, Solomon Islands wishes to\r\nacknowledge the completion of the United Nations\r\nObserver Mission in Bougainville, Papua New Guinea,\r\nwith the successful election in Papua New Guinea’s\r\nnewly autonomous province of Bougainville. We wish\r\nour closest Melanesian neighbour every success in\r\nbuilding on the political gains made so far, and we\r\nassure Bougainville of our commitment to all bilateral\r\ncooperative arrangements. Solomon Islands also\r\nacknowledges Papua New Guinea’s ongoing bilateral\r\nassistance to Solomon Islands.\r\nWith respect to Security Council reform,\r\nSolomon Islands believes that the membership of the\r\nCouncil should reflect the political and economic\r\nrealities of our time. In that regard, Solomon Islands\r\nsupports the expansion of the Security Council and\r\nfeels that a country such as Japan, which has strong\r\nbilateral links with Solomon Islands, should be\r\naccorded a permanent seat on the Council. Japan’s\r\ninclusion will contribute to bridging the divide between\r\nthe multilateral institutions and Member States.\r\nThis year marks the tenth anniversary of the\r\nBeijing Platform for Action. The results have been\r\nmixed. Solomon Islands believes that improving the\r\nwelfare of women is an indispensable requirement for\r\nsustainable security. At the regional level, issues\r\nrelating to the empowerment of women are being\r\nincorporated into the Pacific Plan, which will be\r\ndiscussed by Pacific Islands Forum leaders in October\r\nthis year.\r\nThe United Nations was founded on the principle\r\nof maintaining international peace and security. Over\r\nthe years, some threats continue to receive more\r\nattention than others. The Anti-Secession Law enacted\r\nby the People’s Republic of China in March this year\r\nhas threatened peace and security on the Taiwan Strait.\r\nThe situation creates a security vacuum that, if left\r\nunattended, will continue to fester and will put in\r\nquestion the credibility of this premier multilateral\r\ninstitution. There is no mechanism to address such threats\r\nwithin the parameters of the United Nations Charter.\r\nSolomon Islands therefore renews its call to have\r\nthe issue debated in the General Assembly. The time\r\nhas now come for this body to allow Taiwan, a major\r\nplayer in the international economic system, to take its\r\nrightful place in the United Nations. The Assembly\r\ncannot continue to ignore the plight of the 23 million\r\npeople of Taiwan. Solomon Islands regrets the manner\r\nin which the Assembly has dealt with the issue,\r\nallowing certain countries to dictate the agenda.\r\nWith respect to the reform of the Secretariat,\r\nSolomon Islands would like to see the Secretariat\r\nreflect the diversity of its membership. The current\r\nrecruitment process of having external, rather than in-\r\ncountry, examinations has deterred potential applicants\r\nfrom small island developing States from applying,\r\ngiven the associated expenses.\r\nIn conclusion, Solomon Islands supports\r\nmultilateralism, and I assure the President of our\r\nongoing support for United Nations reform.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now\r\ncall on Her Excellency Mrs. Salome Zourabichvili,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Georgia.\r\nMrs. Zourabichvili (Georgia) (spoke in French):\r\nI should first like to congratulate Mr. Jan Eliasson on\r\nhis election as President at the sixtieth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. I assure him of my delegation’s full\r\nsupport for the important work to be accomplished at\r\nthis session. I would also like to extend my gratitude to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Jean Ping for his tireless efforts\r\nand vision for change he has demonstrated so amply\r\nduring his presidency.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nOur Organization is now at a turning point in its\r\nhistory. Sixty years after its founding, having confronted\r\nmany challenges, faced many threats, been defied by so\r\nmany conflicts, the United Nations is now entering the\r\ntwenty-first century with the obligation to reform itself.\r\nThe bipolar world has come to an end, and new\r\nthreats of a global nature have emerged: international\r\nterrorism, conflicts of a different breed, development\r\nand global environmental challenges. I want here to\r\nrenew to the delegation of the United States of\r\nAmerica a message of solidarity from the Georgian\r\npeople in the face of the New Orleans tragedy. Our\r\nOrganization has no other choice but to adapt, to find\r\nnew instruments and to establish a renewed credibility,\r\nwhich can only be based on a proven efficiency, results\r\nand visible effects. Words do not suffice; deeds are\r\nexpected from us all.\r\n31\r\nA/60/PV.16\r\nWe consider the outcome document adopted by\r\nthe 2005 High-level Plenary Meeting as a substantial\r\nstep in the right direction. This document deals with all\r\nthe real issues that, as we all know, are going to define\r\ntomorrow’s world and affect our Organization’s fate.\r\nWhether we are talking about eradication of\r\npoverty, consolidation of peace and security, protection\r\nof human rights, protection of displaced persons, need\r\nfor an effective system of peacekeeping and for a\r\ncoherent approach to peacebuilding, negative effects of\r\ntransnational crime, responsibility to protect\r\npopulations from ethnic cleansing or whether we\r\nreaffirm the absolute necessity of a dialogue among\r\ncultures and civilizations, all these challenges are of\r\ndirect relevance for my country.\r\nFor Georgia, these threats are not words, these\r\nills are not theory, they are daily realities and directly\r\nexperienced tragedies. Our support for an effective\r\nreform is not a rhetorical stand. Our vital interests are\r\nat stake; the future of my country is at stake. Georgia is\r\ndirectly experimenting on its soil the consequences of\r\nso-called frozen conflicts. Frozen conflicts lead to the\r\nfreezing of the economic development of these\r\nseparatist regions. They freeze the democratic\r\ndevelopment of the society in those regions. They\r\nisolate them and close them, transforming them into\r\noutlaws, “black holes” where all kinds of trafficking\r\nand criminal activities, possibly including terrorist\r\nactivities, could develop outside our control or any\r\nform of control, outside any law.\r\nFrozen conflicts, as well as active conflicts, call\r\nfor the development of a real capacity of the United\r\nNations for effective involvement through instruments\r\nof peacebuilding. For many years the United Nations\r\nhas been dealing with the Abkhazian conflict, but\r\nunfortunately it has not managed to obtain effective\r\nresults. It has proved unable to this day to deploy the\r\nsmall police component that was decided upon, unable\r\nto implement fully its own resolutions, unable to\r\ndeploy an effective peacekeeping capability, unable to\r\nmonitor the human rights violations that are occurring\r\ndaily and frequently.\r\nGradually, despite the United Nations, despite\r\nregular meetings of the Security Council, and despite\r\nthe Secretary-General’s Group of Friends of Georgia, a\r\nregime of apartheid prevails under which Georgians are\r\nexcluded and forbidden to go back to their land and\r\ntheir homes, and a process of covert annexation is\r\ntaking place. Thus, Abkhazia will be a litmus test of\r\nthe renewed efficiency of our Organization, of its\r\ncapacity to monitor effectively, to manage\r\npeacekeeping operations without having to delegate its\r\nresponsibilities to third parties and to enact finally\r\nstrategies of effective peacebuilding.\r\nIn the case of the South Ossetian conflict in\r\nGeorgia, we have a similar situation. The President of\r\nGeorgia has presented two mutually reinforcing peace\r\nproposals within a year. One proposal introduced last\r\nyear before this Assembly set out the three phases for\r\nending the conflict: demilitarization, economic\r\nrehabilitation and political dialogue. In December\r\n2004, it was complemented by a full-fledged proposal\r\non a status of broad autonomy, prepared together with\r\nthe Council of Europe’s Commission for Democracy\r\nthrough Law (the Venice Commission) and presented\r\nto the Council of Europe. But peace plans are not\r\nenough. We now need a mechanism through which the\r\ninternational community will effectively support\r\ninitiatives and policies that are directed towards\r\npeaceful resolution of conflicts.\r\nFor all these reasons, we are taking the outlines\r\nof the new document very seriously and want to see it\r\nfully developed and implemented. We welcome and\r\nsupport the creation of an initial operating capability\r\nfor a standing police capacity. This is a very right step\r\nin the very right direction. We welcome the creation of\r\na Human Rights Council. This new body should be\r\nmore representative, should comply with the highest\r\nstandards of objectivity and should avoid double\r\nstandards as well as omissions or silences. An effective\r\nmonitoring system should be put into place. The\r\nstrengthening of the Office of the Commissioner for\r\nHuman Rights is also a step in the right direction.\r\nWe welcome the creation of a Peacebuilding\r\nCommission that will develop integrated strategies for\r\npost-conflict rehabilitation and recovery. We also need\r\na more effective framework for moving smoothly from\r\npeacemaking to peacebuilding, while developing an\r\nall-inclusive and coherent strategy within which the\r\nUnited Nations will fully assume its responsibilities.\r\nThe new Peacebuilding Commission should be fully\r\nrepresentative of the countries that have been or are the\r\nmost directly affected by conflicts. Also, given the\r\nspecial fate of women and children in conflict and\r\npost-conflict situations, gender representation should\r\nbe given additional attention. “Representation is\r\nessential”, “Knowledge is key” — as we, female foreign\r\n32\r\nA/60/PV.16\r\nministers, have mentioned in our letter to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the President of the General Assembly.\r\nFinally, Georgia supports the reform and\r\nrevitalization of the Security Council — a more\r\neffective and efficient, more democratic, more\r\ntransparent body is called for. Georgia supports the\r\nenlargement proposals in order to give non-permanent\r\nmembers a better chance to contribute to major\r\ndecisions. Transparency and improved decision-making\r\nprocedures are a must. Georgia is convinced that if\r\nthere is an adequate political will, the relevant\r\nagreement on a reformed Security Council can be\r\nreached at the present session of the General Assembly.\r\nThis is our wish. Moreover, this is a necessity. Our\r\ncredibility is at stake.\r\nToday not only the United Nations but all the\r\nmajor international organizations are going through a\r\ndifficult process of adjustment, of renewal and\r\nreappraisal. That is the case of the Organization for\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe, the European\r\nUnion, the Council of Europe and the Commonwealth\r\nof Independent States. Some will survive and grow\r\nstronger. Some will have to yield ground to other\r\nforums that are more flexible, less bureaucratic and\r\nmore in line with today’s realities.\r\nThe United Nations has today started an\r\ninvaluable process of readjustment and rejuvenation. If\r\nour work is successful, this process will go to its term.\r\nThe United Nations will cease to be a mere forum\r\nfor calling for peaceful solutions; it will become the\r\ninstrument the world needs, the instrument for\r\nresolving the conflicts that tarnish the image of today’s\r\nglobal world, the instrument for effectively responding\r\nto the newer global threats that endanger our\r\ndevelopment and our stability.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now\r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Klaus Scharioth,\r\nDeputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany.\r\nMr. Scharioth (Germany) (spoke in German;\r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): Please accept\r\nmy congratulations, Sir, on your election to the\r\npresidency of this historic sixtieth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. I wish you every success. I would\r\nalso like to express my sincere thanks to the outgoing\r\nPresident for his dedicated work at the fifty-ninth\r\nsession. I endorse the statement of the European Union\r\n(EU) presidency.\r\nThe debate at last week’s summit highlighted one\r\nimportant point, namely, that peace, development,\r\nsecurity and human rights are inseparably linked. One\r\ncannot address human rights and security without also\r\naddressing development. All of those issues are at the\r\nvery heart of our policies.\r\nPeople are waiting for our solutions to the\r\npressing problems of development. We must achieve\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. Of that we are\r\nacutely aware, both in Germany and in Europe. The EU\r\nplan to reach the 0.7 per cent official development\r\nassistance goal by 2015, and the Group of Eight (G-8)\r\ncommitments made at Gleneagles, substantially\r\nstrengthen the financial basis of our work.\r\nWe are also willing to forge new paths by making\r\nuse of innovative financing mechanisms.\r\nAt the same time, frameworks establishing fair\r\nconditions for international trade are a prerequisite if\r\npoorer States are to share the benefits of globalization.\r\nThe EU is leading the way with its “Everything But\r\nArms” initiative, which grants the least developed\r\ncountries duty-free and quota-free market access. In\r\nthat context, we must do all we can to make the\r\nMinisterial Conference of the World Trade\r\nOrganization, to be held in Hong Kong in December, a\r\nsuccess. Only in that way can we bring the Doha round\r\nnegotiations to a successful conclusion.\r\nWe also know that excessive indebtedness curbs\r\ngrowth and development. The realignment of the\r\nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt\r\nInitiative after 1999 has considerably reduced the\r\nindebtedness of some 27 States. Germany has to date\r\nforgiven €6.5 billion of debt and has earmarked a\r\nfurther €4 billion for the continuation of the HIPC\r\ninitiative.\r\nDebt relief is, however, dependent on all creditors\r\nspreading the burden fairly among themselves. We are\r\nalarmed by the fact that commercial and State creditors\r\noutside the Paris Club are doing less and less to live up\r\nto their responsibilities. I would like to seize this\r\nopportunity to call for your support at the forthcoming\r\nannual meeting of the Bretton Woods institutions, for\r\nthe G-8 proposal and for an extensive cancellation of\r\ndebts — including multilateral debts — for the\r\ncountries concerned.\r\nAll of the foregoing emphasizes the great\r\nimportance we attach to the global partnership for\r\n33\r\nA/60/PV.16\r\ndevelopment. That partnership is not, however, a one-\r\nway street. It also requires a commitment by partner\r\nStates to put in place the conditions for\r\ndevelopment — that is, democracy, good governance,\r\nrespect for human rights and anti-corruption measures.\r\nClimate protection and development are also\r\nclosely intertwined. Of course, everyone must have\r\naccess to energy. Nevertheless, all States must do their\r\npart to prevent the ominous advance of climate change.\r\nIn late November the parties to the United Nations\r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change and the\r\nKyoto Protocol will meet in Montreal. There, we will\r\nhave the opportunity to adopt effective mechanisms to\r\nreduce emissions of greenhouse gases beyond 2012.\r\nThat is precisely the policy pursued by the Kyoto\r\nProtocol, and it is a policy we will adhere to.\r\nThis year two natural catastrophes — the tsunami\r\nin the Indian Ocean and Hurricane Katrina in the\r\nUnited States of America — have clearly demonstrated\r\njust how vulnerable our societies are to natural\r\ndisasters. We have all learned just how important\r\ndisaster prevention is. As host to the Third\r\nInternational Conference on Early Warning, which will\r\nbe held in Bonn in March 2006, Germany hopes to\r\ncontribute to making better use of and improving early\r\nwarning mechanisms and thereby limiting the scale of\r\nthe damage caused by such disasters. Here I would like\r\nto take this opportunity to reiterate our invitation to all\r\nMember States to join us in making the Bonn\r\nConference a success.\r\nFor years, United Nations engagement has been\r\nhailed all over the world as a welcome sign of\r\nprotection and assistance, of peace and reconstruction.\r\nLast Sunday saw the first free parliamentary elections\r\nin Afghanistan under the new Constitution. The\r\nGovernment of Afghanistan, with a full complement of\r\ndemocratically legitimated institutions, is now\r\nprepared to assume responsibility for the further\r\nreconstruction of the country. By going to the polls,\r\nmillions of women and men in Afghanistan have\r\nproved that they have opted for democracy. Our thanks\r\ngo to the United Nations, which worked hard to make\r\nthose elections possible.\r\nIn his latest report on Afghanistan (A/60/224) the\r\nSecretary-General announced that the United Nations\r\nwill remain committed to assisting the country after the\r\nelections. I heartily endorse that commitment; such\r\nhelp is indispensable. For even if the Bonn process,\r\nlaunched four years ago, has now been brought to a\r\nsuccessful conclusion, the international community\r\nwill still need to stand by Afghanistan. Germany, too,\r\nwill continue to do its utmost to support the country.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nTen years after the conclusion of the Dayton\r\nAgreement, and six years after the end of the Kosovo\r\nconflict, the situation in the Western Balkans has\r\nimproved tangibly. Nonetheless, major progress is still\r\nrequired in the political, legal and economic fields. The\r\npeople of that region must genuinely come to terms\r\nwith their past, and the parties to the conflict must be\r\nreconciled. In that connection, we call for full\r\ncooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal\r\nfor the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague.\r\nThe Middle East still faces great challenges. As\r\nits neighbours, we in Europe have a strategic interest in\r\npeace and stability in the region. We are convinced that\r\nonly through reform, the strengthening of democracy\r\nand the rule of law can lasting stability be guaranteed.\r\nThe free and fair parliamentary elections in Palestine\r\nand Lebanon are encouraging signs of change.\r\nThe Middle East peace process has also gained\r\nnew momentum over past months. We emphatically\r\nwelcome the Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip\r\nand the northern part of the West Bank. Now it is vital\r\nthat Israelis, Palestinians and the international\r\ncommunity do all they can to lay the foundations for\r\npolitical and economic stability in the Gaza Strip.\r\nEfforts should be focused on a two-State solution based\r\non the road map. The objective remains a viable\r\nPalestinian State, living side by side with Israel within\r\nsecure and recognized borders.\r\nThe international community is united in its\r\ndetermination to help Iraq establish democracy and the\r\nrule of law. We want all Iraqis to be able to live free\r\nfrom fear and material hardship. The forces of terror\r\nand violence must not and shall not be permitted to win\r\nthe upper hand. The Middle East needs a stable,\r\nprosperous Iraq.\r\nHere, too, the United Nations is making its\r\ncontribution towards the process of political transition\r\nand reconstruction. That is why we have provided\r\nconsiderable financial assistance for the protection\r\nforce whose presence allows the United Nations to\r\nwork in Iraq. It is also why Germany has, at Iraq’s\r\nrequest, advised that country on constitutional issues.\r\n34\r\nA/60/PV.16\r\nThe Iranian nuclear programme continues to be a\r\nmajor cause of concern. Past violations of international\r\nobligations, a lack of transparency in its actions, and\r\ninsufficient cooperation with subsequent investigations\r\nhave destroyed any confidence that the programme is\r\nfor exclusively peaceful purposes. With support from\r\nthe EU High Representative, Germany, France and the\r\nUnited Kingdom have worked with Iran on finding a\r\nway to restore confidence. Those efforts have received\r\nbroad support from the international community.\r\nTehran’s continued disregard of International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency decisions, however, is further\r\nweakening that confidence and the gains made to date\r\nare being put at risk for no good reason. We should\r\nemphasize that our concerns do not relate to Iran’s\r\nright to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.\r\nThis has never been and will not be put in\r\nquestion. Our concerns do not relate to Iran’s right to\r\nuse nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. That has\r\nnever been and will not be called into question.\r\nWe remain prepared to work on solutions which\r\ninclude objective guarantees that the Iranian nuclear\r\nprogramme can serve only peaceful ends. I appeal to\r\nIran to refrain from taking unilateral measures and to\r\nreturn to the negotiating table.\r\nThere is general agreement that the proliferation\r\nof weapons of mass destruction is now more than ever\r\na life-threatening risk to us all. It is thus all the more\r\nregrettable that no consensus could be reached on the\r\ninclusion in the outcome document of a chapter on\r\nnon-proliferation and disarmament. If we want to\r\nprevent the proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, in particular of nuclear weapons, all States\r\nmust fulfil their obligations. At the same time, new\r\nmomentum must be brought to the process of nuclear\r\ndisarmament.\r\nIn that context, I welcome the latest progress made\r\nby the six-party talks towards resolving the nuclear\r\ncrisis on the Korean peninsula. It is a vital first step.\r\nAfrica is in many ways a touchstone for and an\r\nexample of an effective multilateral system. The close\r\ncooperation of the United Nations with the African\r\nUnion, as well as with the Economic Community of\r\nWest African States (ECOWAS), has had a beneficial\r\nimpact in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Côte d’Ivoire and,\r\nrecently, in Burundi. The United Nations is also\r\nplaying an equally important role in efforts to stabilize\r\nthe Great Lakes region.\r\nFollowing the death of John Garang, the peace\r\nprocess in the Sudan requires an even greater\r\ncommitment by all parties to implement the historic\r\nNairobi peace agreement. The United Nations Mission\r\nin the Sudan (UNMIS), to which Germany has\r\ncontributed personnel, is making a major contribution.\r\nHowever, we must not neglect other crisis areas, in\r\nparticular Darfur. The African Union mission in Darfur\r\nhas helped to stabilize the security situation in the area\r\nwhere it is stationed.\r\nThe variety of problems facing us — poverty, social\r\npolarization, global population growth, inadequate water\r\nsupplies and global climate change, to name only the\r\nmost pressing — serves to highlight the need for\r\nconcerted action. We must prepare the United Nations\r\nfor the challenges of the twenty-first century.\r\nOver the past 12 months, reform of the United\r\nNations has been intensively debated. Member States,\r\nthe High-level Panel and the Secretary-General himself\r\nhave provided valuable input. Some of their proposals\r\nare contained in the outcome document adopted at last\r\nweek’s world summit.\r\nHowever, only when we have managed to\r\nimplement those proposals will we be able to speak of\r\ntrue achievement. To be a success, the process requires\r\nthe active participation of all Member States.\r\nThe tasks that the summit has set the General\r\nAssembly must be tackled with speed and focus. At\r\nthis session, the General Assembly must make a\r\nbreakthrough towards the adoption of the\r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism.\r\nIt must also work on the creation of a Peacebuilding\r\nCommission.\r\nSustainable peace requires more than merely\r\nrestoring security. The post-conflict peacebuilding\r\nphase is particularly crucial. The sooner reconstruction\r\ncan begin, and the better coordinated the peacemaking\r\nand post-conflict recovery efforts are, the better the\r\nchances of lasting stabilization. The summit took a\r\nvital step in that direction by deciding to establish the\r\nPeacebuilding Commission by the end of the year.\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan, in his report\r\nentitled “In larger freedom”, states that:\r\n“No security agenda and no drive for\r\ndevelopment will be successful unless they are\r\nbased on … respect for human dignity”.\r\n(A/59/2005, para. 128)\r\n35\r\nA/60/PV.16\r\nIf we wish to lend greater weight to the\r\nprotection and promotion of human rights, we must\r\nalso strengthen the relevant United Nations bodies and\r\nmechanisms.\r\nGermany therefore welcomes the decision taken\r\nby the summit to create a Human Rights Council which\r\nwill replace the Commission on Human Rights. The\r\nGeneral Assembly must now move fast to define the\r\nmandate and structures of the Human Rights Council.\r\nIt must ensure that the new body enjoys greater\r\nlegitimacy than its predecessor and that its working\r\nmethods are more effective, especially when it comes\r\nto responding to acute crises.\r\nAllow me a last word. A glance at the trouble\r\nspots around the world makes it clear that we, the\r\ninternational community, face far more conflicts in the\r\nSouth than we do in the North. Key decisions on\r\nsettling those conflicts are taken in the Security\r\nCouncil which, under the Charter of the United\r\nNations, has primary responsibility for the maintenance\r\nof peace. Its composition, however, still reflects the\r\nworld of 1945 and not that of the twenty-first century.\r\nAdjusting and expanding the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council by adding both permanent and non-\r\npermanent members thus remains essential. Any reform\r\nof the United Nations that does not include reform of the\r\nSecurity Council is not worthy of the name.\r\nThe Security Council is in danger of losing its\r\nauthority and legitimacy as long as entire continents\r\nand major contributors are not adequately represented.\r\nGermany and its partners Brazil, India and Japan\r\ntherefore have submitted a proposal on reform of the\r\nCouncil. It is the only proposal that includes a\r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council and its\r\nworking methods. We are convinced that it is the only\r\nproposal capable of obtaining the necessary two-thirds\r\nmajority in the General Assembly.\r\nReform of the Security Council is an\r\nindispensable part of the overhaul of the United\r\nNations. In last week’s summit document, we all\r\npledged to swiftly advance those reforms. We do not\r\nneed only progress; we need results. The time is ripe\r\nfor radical reform. Let us use this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly to finally resolve this issue, which is\r\nso vital to the future of the United Nations.\r\nThe President: I give the floor to His Excellency\r\nMr. Oskaras Jusys, Secretary for Foreign Affairs of\r\nLithuania.\r\nMr. Jusys (Lithuania): Lithuania welcomes this\r\neffort — the most extensive and ambitious ever made —\r\nto renew the United Nations. We must ensure that the\r\nsummit commitments we all have undertaken are\r\nimplemented and that they produce real and tangible\r\nresults, in order to improve the Organization’s capacity\r\nto act adequately, effectively, expeditiously and in the\r\nbest interests of us all. Their implementation should\r\nalso enable us to give hope to the vulnerable and the\r\ndestitute and to make the world a better place for all.\r\nWe welcome the affirmation by the outcome\r\ndocument of the inextricable link between\r\ndevelopment, security and human rights. That, in our\r\nview, is a sine qua non for all our future actions. We\r\nwelcome the reaffirmation of the commitments regarding\r\nthe implementation of the Millennium Development\r\nGoals. As a member State of the European Union, we\r\nare proud of the Union’s commitment to double its\r\noverall aid level by the year 2010, including a\r\nconsiderable increase in aid to Africa.\r\nWe support the establishment of a Democracy\r\nFund for countries seeking to establish or strengthen\r\ntheir democratic practices. In our view, that Fund will\r\ncontribute to maximizing the impact of development\r\nassistance by focusing on the improvement of\r\ngovernance standards. Transparent and democratic\r\ngovernance practices can make quite a difference in the\r\nperformance of countries that are otherwise quite\r\nsimilar in terms of their natural resources and social\r\nstructure.\r\nWe emphasize the role of international trade in\r\npromoting economic growth and development and thus\r\nin fighting poverty. We therefore add our voice to calls\r\nfor a rapid, ambitious and development-oriented\r\ncompletion of the Doha trade round.\r\nFurthermore, Lithuania is convinced that all\r\ndevelopment and all relevant related strategies should\r\nhave a built-in element of environmental sustainability.\r\nWe welcome the language of the outcome document to\r\nthat effect but believe that we should go further.\r\nIn particular, we underline the importance of\r\ngoing beyond Kyoto by initiating negotiations on the\r\ndevelopment of a more inclusive and equitable\r\ninternational framework for climate change beyond the\r\nyear 2012.\r\nLithuania welcomes the strong and unconditional\r\ncondemnation of terrorism in the outcome document.\r\n36\r\nA/60/PV.16\r\nWe call on the General Assembly to complete, at its\r\nsixtieth session, work on a comprehensive convention\r\non terrorism and on a global counter-terrorism strategy,\r\nas proposed by the Secretary-General earlier this year.\r\nWe strongly welcome the endorsement of\r\n“responsibility to protect” populations from genocide,\r\nwar crimes and ethnic cleansing. This is of\r\nfundamental importance; it is an important step that\r\ngives us hope that we shall no longer look away nor\r\nstand idly by as entire populations are being killed.\r\nLithuania fully supports the proposals regarding\r\nUnited Nations management reform. We hope the\r\nblueprint to be submitted by the Secretary-General will\r\nnot fall victim to endless debates by Member States\r\nbut, rather, lead to tangible changes, improving the\r\nOrganization’s accountability, transparency, efficiency\r\nand professionalism, while assuring the highest ethical\r\nstandards.\r\nToo often in the past, we have seen nations\r\nemerging from conflict lapse into disruption and chaos,\r\nthus destabilizing entire regions. We therefore call for\r\nrapid progress in making the Peacebuilding\r\nCommission fully operational before the end of this\r\nyear.\r\nWhile expressing our satisfaction with the\r\nagreement to double resources for the Office of the\r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights, we urge all\r\nnations to take conclusive decisions in the coming\r\nmonths on the basis of the wording agreed to by the\r\nvast majority of countries in establishing a robust and\r\neffective Human Rights Council.\r\nAt the same time, we have to admit that the\r\noutcome document is lacking considerably in some\r\nareas. We are well aware that the reform process is not\r\na one-time event. As we proceed along the path of\r\nUnited Nations reform, we must make sure these areas\r\nare not left out.\r\nFirst, there is the issue of impunity. The fight\r\nagainst impunity and the rendering of justice must be\r\npart and parcel of our common efforts to improve the\r\nhuman rights situation worldwide. We stress our\r\nsupport for the International Criminal Court, as well as\r\nthe existing ad hoc and mixed criminal tribunals and\r\nother mechanisms for international justice.\r\nSecondly, there is the question of Security\r\nCouncil reform which cannot be delayed further,\r\nespecially if we really care about restoring the\r\nauthority and credibility of the United Nations. The\r\nCouncil’s working methods must be improved to\r\nprovide greater input from non-member States. Its\r\nmembership must be expanded in both the permanent\r\nand non-permanent categories, with due consideration\r\nbeing paid to equitable geographical representation and\r\nthe recent emergence of new international actors and\r\ncontributors. Lithuania has long supported the\r\ncandidacies of Germany and Japan as permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council. We appreciate the\r\naspirations of India and Brazil to undertake the\r\nhonourable responsibility of permanent membership,\r\nand we agree that Africa’s representation in both\r\ncategories of membership is long overdue.\r\nAfter 11 years of debate on the issue of Security\r\nCouncil reform, it is time to admit that we are unlikely\r\nto produce new arguments without repeating ourselves\r\nindefinitely. Lithuania, therefore, calls on all Member\r\nStates to assume their responsibilities and to take\r\naction.\r\nFinally, let me touch upon the failure to agree, in\r\nthe outcome document, on the issues of non-\r\nproliferation and disarmament. This is the major failure\r\nof our summit, especially in the light of the unfortunate\r\nconclusion of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty\r\nReview Conference earlier this year. We must honour\r\nour earlier agreements and obligations, restore\r\nconsensus and invest all our efforts in search of\r\nagreement on this crucial issue. We therefore call on all\r\nnations to rally around the initiative put forward by\r\nNorway and a group of like-minded countries; we\r\nbelieve this initiative could become a basis of viable\r\nconsensus and future cooperative action.\r\nLast December, we witnessed an unprecedented\r\noutburst of solidarity with the Asian tsunami victims.\r\nThese past few weeks, our hearts were with the people\r\nof the United States, whose citizens saw their lives\r\nshattered and whole communities destroyed by\r\nHurricane Katrina. We offered whatever assistance we\r\ncould to those affected and we extend our condolences\r\nto all those who have suffered from this enormous\r\ndevastation.\r\nIn moments of grief and sorrow, we are one. Pain\r\nhas no nationality, no religion, no race. Similarly, we\r\nshould all be one in our solidarity. We should not have\r\nto wait for new cataclysms and large-scale tragedies in\r\norder to agree on the need to build a renewed United\r\nNations for the new century. As Secretary-General\r\n37\r\nA/60/PV.16\r\nKofi Annan has repeatedly noted, in this globalized,\r\ninterrelated world, it is the collective interest that is\r\noften in our best national interest.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nthe general debate for this meeting. I shall now call on\r\nthose representatives who wish to speak in exercise of\r\nthe right of reply.\r\nMay I remind members that, in accordance with\r\nGeneral Assembly decision 34/401, statements in\r\nexercise of the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes\r\nfor the first intervention and to five minutes for the\r\nsecond and should be made by delegations from their\r\nseats.\r\nMr. Williams (United Kingdom): I would like to\r\nrespond to the remarks made today by the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Spain about Gibraltar. The British\r\nGovernment welcomes and shares Spain’s willingness\r\nto work in a constructive spirit. We agree that issues\r\nrelating to Gibraltar can only be resolved through\r\ndialogue and, therefore, welcome the newly established\r\ntrilateral forum on Gibraltar, to which all parties,\r\nincluding Gibraltar, can express their views.\r\nOur aim remains to build a better future for the\r\npeople of Gibraltar and, in doing that, the United\r\nKingdom Government stands by its long-term\r\ncommitment to the people of Gibraltar to respect their\r\nwishes.\r\nMr. Sadeghi (Islamic Republic of Iran): Today\r\nthe General Assembly heard a number of\r\nunsubstantiated allegations about my country from the\r\nrepresentative of the Israeli regime, a regime that has\r\nbeen based on violence, occupation, corruption, state\r\nterrorism and bloodshed.\r\nIsrael, throughout its entire dark history, and ever\r\nsince its inception, has suffered profoundly from a lack\r\nof legitimacy. So it is not surprising that the\r\nrepresentative of such a regime — ruled constantly by\r\nthose who are culprits in various crimes against\r\nhumanity and war crimes — makes such baseless,\r\nfabricated propaganda the remedy for its illegitimacy.\r\nIt is an open secret that Israel has continuously\r\nand purposely violated many international laws and\r\nnorms, as well as dozens of United Nations resolutions\r\nto which the response of this illegitimate and\r\nirresponsible regime has been nothing but complete\r\ndefiance. In this context, particular reference can be\r\nmade to the mischievous policy of the Israeli regime on\r\nthe nuclear issue, which is a showcase of its\r\nconcealment and unabated pursuance of a nuclear\r\narsenal during the past decades. It is indisputable that\r\nsuch an ill-intentioned policy has been threatening the\r\npeace and security of the volatile Middle East region\r\nfor years. In fact, the Israeli nuclear danger and its\r\nmissile capability, coupled with its wicked behaviour\r\nand satanic intentions, present a real threat, not only to\r\nregional peace and security but also to the whole\r\nworld.\r\nTherefore, this threat needs to be urgently and\r\ndecisively addressed by the international community.\r\nIndeed, this regime should face a united front and be\r\nkept under continuous pressure to relinquish its nuclear\r\nprogramme and to place all its nuclear facilities under\r\ninternational monitoring. It is worth mentioning that\r\nthe only existing obstacle to the establishment of a\r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East is the\r\nnon-adherence of this regime to the Nuclear Non-\r\nProliferation Treaty (NPT) and its continued,\r\nclandestine operation of unsafe guarded nuclear\r\nfacilities, with the help and technological assistance\r\nfrom a certain State. This regime has paid no attention\r\nto the constant international call in different forums,\r\nparticularly in the 2000 NPT Review Conference\r\nwhich, by name, called upon this regime to accede to\r\nthe NPT immediately and without any conditions.\r\nMoreover, the said regime has never been a party\r\nto the international instruments on weapons of mass\r\ndestruction — namely, the Chemical Weapons\r\nConvention (CWC), the Biological Weapons\r\nConvention (BWC) and the NPT.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran, as a party to the\r\nCWC, BWC and NPT, is committed to all provisions of\r\nthose instruments and, while remaining transparent\r\nthrough making declarations and accepting\r\ninternational monitoring and inspection by the\r\ncompetent international bodies, in particular the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, has always stated\r\nthat it would not abandon its right to peaceful uses of\r\nnuclear technology due to politically motivated\r\naccusations.\r\nThe baseless allegations and the statement of the\r\nrepresentative of the Zionist regime in the Assembly\r\ntoday demonstrate clearly that those who are putting\r\nmy country under growing, unreasonable and unfair\r\npressure are in fact trying to serve the interests of the\r\nillegitimate Israeli regime. We believe that the\r\n38\r\nA/60/PV.16\r\ninternational community is well aware of that ploy and\r\nwill therefore not give in to pressure aimed at\r\nprotecting the illegal policies and practices of the\r\nZionist regime and its illegitimate interests.\r\nMr. Gillerman (Israel): I just wanted — and I\r\nfeel pretty confident that I am doing it on behalf of\r\nmany in this Hall — to express our appreciation for a\r\nlecture on human rights, world terror and nuclear\r\nproliferation from one of the world’s greatest experts in\r\nthat field.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.50 p.m.\r\n"
