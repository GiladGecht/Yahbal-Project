(Sweden)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Momodu Koroma, Minister for Foreign Affairs and\r\nInternational Cooperation of the Republic of Sierra\r\nLeone.\r\nMr. Koroma (Sierra Leone): The delegation of\r\nthe Republic of Sierra Leone wishes to express its\r\nprofound appreciation for the significant contribution\r\nof the President of the General Assembly at its fifty-\r\nninth session to the work of the Assembly and to\r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the\r\nleadership of this body at its sixtieth session. You and\r\nyour predecessor will always have a special place in\r\nthe history of the United Nations as Presidents of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at the height of the Organization’s\r\nreform process.\r\nThe United Nations was founded on the principle\r\nof multilateral cooperation for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. For 60 years, it has\r\nbeen the focus of its Members — rich and poor, big\r\nand small — for carrying out that critical\r\nresponsibility. Today, for many of its Members, the\r\nOrganization is the great hope, not only for the\r\nachievement of peace and security, but also for the\r\nattainment of every objective of human aspiration,\r\nparticularly development, human rights, freedom and\r\ndemocracy.\r\nThe United Nations was designed to serve the\r\nworld of the aftermath of the Second World War — a\r\nworld different in many ways from today’s world. That\r\nis why my delegation has welcomed with total\r\ncommitment reforms in the United Nations system to\r\nreflect the realities of today’s world, and we will\r\ncontinue to participate fully in the reform process.\r\nWe welcome the outcome document (resolution\r\n60/1) of last week’s summit and applaud the\r\nnegotiations that led to its adoption by consensus. The\r\nsuccess of those negotiations indicate that, in spite of\r\nour differences and individual sovereign interests,\r\nMember States recognize that we have more things in\r\ncommon than things that divide us and that, for a better\r\nworld, common interests must enjoy precedence over\r\nindividual interests.\r\nThe rhetoric that has accompanied the outcome\r\ndocument has been impressive and reassuring,\r\nespecially for developing countries and countries in\r\nconflict or emerging from conflict. If those soothing\r\nstatements are matched by action, this year’s United\r\nNations summit and General Assembly session will\r\nhave a landmark effect on the Organization and on the\r\nworld. We are optimistic that it will.\r\nThis is the last Assembly session before the\r\ncompletion of the withdrawal of the United Nations\r\nMission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) at the end of\r\nDecember. UNAMSIL has achieved successes that are\r\nunique in the history of United Nations peacekeeping\r\nefforts. Sierra Leoneans will forever remember the\r\npositive difference that the Mission made in their\r\n2\r\nA/60/PV.23\r\ncountry’s crisis and in their lives. For that, we can\r\nnever sufficiently thank the United Nations and the\r\nentire international community for coming to our\r\nrescue and for standing by us when we could not stand\r\nalone. In particular, we are profoundly grateful to\r\ncountries that contributed troops to UNAMSIL and\r\ncountries that financially supported the Mission.\r\nWith a tremendous feeling of relief, we welcome\r\nthe proposal to constitute an integrated United Nations\r\noffice to succeed UNAMSIL, with the objective of\r\nsupporting Sierra Leone in continuing to address\r\ncritical areas of concern, including the causes of the\r\nconflict, consolidating the peace, human rights,\r\ndevelopment, legal, judicial and governance reforms,\r\nthe rule of law and security. That measure has allayed\r\nthe fears of Sierra Leoneans that UNAMSIL’s\r\ndeparture would create a security vacuum and would\r\nmark the end of programmes associated with the\r\nMission. We eagerly look forward to yet another\r\nsuccess in the United Nations peacekeeping experiment\r\nin Sierra Leone.\r\nToday, the Organization is preparing to transform\r\nits peacekeeping functions in Sierra Leone to meet\r\nsome of the post-conflict needs of the country. That is\r\na landmark decision that could serve as a model for\r\neffective coordination of strategies and programmes\r\namong the United Nations, its agencies and\r\nprogrammes, and organizations and development\r\npartners in countries emerging from conflict.\r\nWe note with interest that the architecture and\r\nplans for the operation of the new integrated office\r\nwere based on close and extensive cooperation among\r\nrelevant parties of the United Nations Secretariat and\r\nvarious United Nations agencies and organizations that\r\nconstituted the country team. Sierra Leone hopes that\r\nthat process of consultation and cooperation will\r\ncontinue. We urge the United Nations Mission to work\r\nclosely with existing national institutions and with\r\nother initiatives that we have set up over the past five\r\nyears to tackle post-conflict problems. We have no\r\ndoubt that the new office will provide a “guinea pig”\r\nfor the work of the proposed United Nations\r\nPeacebuilding Commission, to which we will spare no\r\neffort to lend support.\r\nAs members are aware, it is not enough to\r\nestablish these short-term yet essential post-conflict\r\nbridges; what we desperately need is the mobilization\r\nof resources, including those required for capacity-\r\nbuilding for sustainable economic and social\r\ndevelopment. The objective is not merely to ensure that\r\nSierra Leone and other countries emerging from\r\nconflict do not slide back into conflict; rather, the\r\nultimate objective must be to ensure that Sierra\r\nLeoneans do not remain in abject poverty.\r\nThe creation of the Peacebuilding Commission\r\nwill be in consonance with the views expressed by my\r\ncountry’s President five years ago when, from this\r\nrostrum at the Millennium Summit, he spoke about the\r\nimperative of adaptation by the United Nations. He\r\npleaded with the Organization to continue to adapt and\r\nequip itself to deal with the perennial problems and\r\nnew manifestations of human insecurity and\r\nunderdevelopment. He also spoke about some of the\r\nways in which Sierra Leone had tested the capacity of\r\nthe United Nations to adapt itself to respond to local\r\nand global challenges.\r\nThe three main elements — development, peace\r\nand security and human rights — highlighted in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report entitled “In larger freedom”\r\n(A/59/2005) and in the outcome document (resolution\r\n60/1) of last week’s High-level Plenary Meeting are all\r\ninterrelated. However, as the document states,\r\ndevelopment is a central goal by itself. That is why no\r\none should be surprised at the importance that Sierra\r\nLeone — a poor country emerging from a devastating\r\nconflict — attaches to the development cluster of the\r\noutcome document, including the section on ways in\r\nwhich to meet the special needs of Africa.\r\nThe people of Sierra Leone continue to attach\r\nimportance to the Millennium Development Goals\r\n(MDGs) and to the commitments our heads of State or\r\nGovernment made in the Assembly five years ago. The\r\nprincipal purpose of the just-concluded High-level\r\nPlenary Meeting was to renew our determination to\r\nfulfil those commitments.\r\nThe General Assembly would be interested to\r\nknow that the food security objective of ensuring by\r\nthe year 2007 that no Sierra Leonean goes to bed\r\nhungry is consistent with, and directly linked to, the\r\nMDGs; so are the objectives embodied in our Poverty\r\nReduction Strategy Paper. We are determined to\r\ncontinue to work with our development partners to\r\nachieve those objectives.\r\nFor the overwhelming majority of us, “freedom\r\nfrom want” means the collective national and\r\ninternational responsibility to eradicate extreme\r\n3\r\nA/60/PV.23\r\npoverty, the collective responsibility to ensure that\r\npeople in all regions of the world enjoy, first and\r\nforemost, their human right to food, basic health care,\r\neducation, clean water and other amenities that sustain\r\nlife. As we see it, “freedom from fear” means the\r\ncollective responsibility of all States to remove and\r\neliminate threats to the safety and security of people\r\neverywhere, such as the illicit traffic and use of small\r\narms and the accumulation of nuclear and other\r\nweapons of mass destruction. “Freedom from want”\r\nand “freedom from fear” also imply the responsibility\r\nto accept without reservation the relationship between\r\ndisarmament and development.\r\nFurthermore, “freedom to live in dignity” implies\r\nthe collective responsibility of all States to ensure that\r\ntheir peoples are treated with dignity. This includes the\r\nprotection of all the economic, social, cultural, political\r\nand civil rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration\r\nof Human Rights. In our view, that responsibility\r\nimplies cooperation and assistance where necessary to\r\nenhance the capacity for prevention and protection. In\r\nthis connection, Sierra Leone is grateful for the\r\nassistance it continues to receive from the United\r\nNations in the field of human rights.\r\nSierra Leone has continued to make giant strides\r\nin all areas of human endeavour since the end of armed\r\nconflict in 2002. Since then, presidential,\r\nparliamentary and local elections — the latter ushering\r\nin a revival of local government that had been dormant\r\nfor nearly 30 years — have been held in conformity\r\nwith democratic principles and practice. We are now\r\npreparing for the 2007 presidential and parliamentary\r\nelections to consolidate further our gains in the\r\ndemocratic process.\r\nSierra Leone believes that children are the best\r\ninvestment to ensure a bright future for our country.\r\nConsequently, we hold the view that development and\r\nrespect for human rights start with them and that the\r\nMillennium Development Goals are a critical tool for\r\nachieving those goals. That is why we have increased\r\nthe space devoted to education, as indicated by\r\nenrolment figures that have jumped from 659,503 in\r\nthe 2001-2002 academic year to 1,158,399 in 2003-\r\n2004 — this in a country whose total population is\r\n5 million.\r\nWe believe that the sound administration of\r\njustice, in particular strict adherence to the rule of law\r\nand human rights, is indispensable to attaining durable\r\npeace and political stability. Accordingly, the\r\nGovernment has re-established civil authority\r\nthroughout Sierra Leone through the reopening and\r\nstrengthening of judicial and law enforcement\r\ninstitutions, and we are in the process of establishing a\r\nnational human rights commission.\r\nTwo transitional institutions, the Truth and\r\nReconciliation Commission, which has just published\r\nits report, and the Special Court, have contributed\r\nimmensely to the peace process. It is the Government’s\r\nintention to implement the Commission’s\r\nrecommendations, to which we attach great importance\r\nas a crucial instrument of durable peace.\r\nLet me take this opportunity to appeal to the\r\nUnited Nations, the international community and our\r\nfriends to support the Special Court to enable it to\r\naccomplish its mandate.\r\nThere is no doubt that the United Nations and the\r\ninternational community have made important strides\r\nin addressing impunity. However, it is our belief that\r\nthe international community should do more than\r\nsupport the international tribunals, truth and\r\nreconciliation commissions and other mechanisms of a\r\ntransitional justice system. It is our fervent hope that\r\nthe process of peace and reconciliation in Sierra Leone\r\nwill not end with the report of the Truth and\r\nReconciliation Commission or the end of the work of\r\nthe Special Court. Reconciliation would be incomplete\r\nwithout addressing the special needs of the victims of\r\nthe heinous crimes that were perpetrated on civilians\r\nduring the armed conflict.\r\nI solemnly appeal to the international community\r\nto assist us in supporting victims of war crimes and\r\ncrimes against humanity. Within its limited resources,\r\nthe Government has made every effort to address the\r\nspecial needs of the victims of the heinous crimes\r\ncommitted during the 11-year rebel armed conflict. But\r\nwe need international support for these victims\r\nthrough, for instance, the Special Fund for War Victims\r\nenvisaged under the 1999 Lomé Peace Agreement and\r\nthe National Commission for War-Affected Children.\r\nThis address would be incomplete without\r\nreference to the security situation in the West African\r\nsubregion. While Sierra Leone is enjoying relative\r\npeace and stability and the capacity of its security\r\nforces continues to be enhanced by the International\r\nMilitary Advisory and Training Team, there is still an\r\nair of uncertainty in the neighbourhood and the\r\n4\r\nA/60/PV.23\r\nsubregion. Because of the porosity of the borders and\r\nthe historically fluid nature of the conflict in the\r\nsubregion, we will feel safe and secure only in a\r\nconflict-free region.\r\nIn the light of this, I would like to appeal to the\r\nUnited Nations, the international community and our\r\nfriends to continue to support measures to resolve the\r\nconflicts that have plagued the subregion for so long\r\nand diverted scarce resources and energy from\r\ndevelopment. But let me remind members about the\r\nimperative of recognizing the fact that the achievement\r\nof lasting peace requires wholesome measure for the\r\nentire subregion. In particular, we recommend a\r\nsubregional approach by the United Nations, the\r\nAfrican Union, the European Union, the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States and other interested\r\nparties to post-conflict activities, including\r\ndisarmament, demobilization and reintegration,\r\nsecurity-sector reform and post-conflict peacebuilding.\r\nFinally, at the time of the debate of the sixtieth\r\nsession of the General Assembly, we should be\r\nreminded that the United Nations is and should remain\r\nat the centre of efforts to harmonize activities to attain\r\nits common objectives. This Organization belongs to us\r\nall and operates in the larger interest of all its\r\nmembers. Let this sixtieth anniversary be a time for\r\nrecommitment to the principles and purposes of the\r\nCharter, a time for renewed determination to build on\r\nthe successes of this great Organization.\r\nThe President: I now have the honour of giving\r\nthe floor to His Excellency Mr. Mamadou Bamba,\r\nMinister of State and Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nthe Republic of Côte d’Ivoire.\r\nMr. Bamba (Côte d’Ivoire) (spoke in French):\r\nOn behalf of my delegation, I wish to express my\r\nsincere congratulations on your election as President of\r\nthe sixtieth session of the General Assembly. May I\r\nwish you and the members of the Bureau full success\r\nand assure you of my delegation’s full support and\r\ncooperation.\r\nI would like to pay tribute to your predecessor,\r\nMr. Jean Ping, who during his mandate substantially\r\ncontributed greatly to reviving discussion of United\r\nNations reform and activities for development and\r\ninternational cooperation. I would also like to\r\ncongratulate warmly the Secretary-General for his\r\ncourageous initiatives to give our Organization new\r\nmomentum and further the fundamental ideals and\r\nprinciples of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Hachani (Tunisia), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThis session is of special importance for the\r\nMember States and the Organization itself because it\r\ntakes place at a time when States are asked to speak\r\nabout thorough-going reforms of the Organization in\r\norder to permit it to deal with the triple challenge of\r\ndevelopment, peace and security and the promotion\r\nand defence of human rights. The summit just held on\r\nprogress in achieving the Millennium Development\r\nGoals (MDGs) was not as successful as we had hoped\r\nit would be. We can be gratified, however, that we\r\nwere able, despite the difficulties, to adopt a final\r\ndocument reaffirming the Goals and the Monterrey\r\nConsensus on Financing for Development, adopted in\r\n2002. For the first time, we were also able to condemn\r\nall acts of terrorism, regardless of motive, of who\r\ncommits them and of where they are committed. My\r\ndelegation hopes that we will, during this sixtieth\r\nsession, be able to adopt a general, comprehensive\r\nconvention on international terrorism and set up a\r\nHuman Rights Council.\r\nEfforts to achieve greater justice in international\r\neconomic relations have not been as successful as we\r\nhad hoped. The gap between the developed and\r\ndeveloping countries is widening. The economies of\r\nthe developing countries are deteriorating and, in some\r\ncases, their citizens are becoming pauperized on a\r\nbroad scale. The countries of the third world are being\r\nthwarted in their efforts to develop, labouring under the\r\nweight of indebtedness, the volatility in commodity\r\nprices, barriers to access to the markets of developed\r\ncountries, inadequate official development assistance\r\nand scarce financial resources, not to mention the\r\nconflicts and various pandemics afflicting our\r\npopulations. I would like to point out that indebtedness\r\nis a form of bondage and indebted economies are\r\neconomies that function under constraints. Finding a\r\ndurable, innovative and daring solution to this problem\r\nis one of the prerequisites for any resumption of\r\ngrowth, not only in heavily indebted countries, but in\r\nmost developing countries. This is why my delegation\r\nwelcomes the recent decision to cancel the debt of 18\r\ndeveloping countries, while we deplore, as other\r\ndelegations have, the limited scope of that decision. We\r\nwould like it to be extended to all African countries.\r\n5\r\nA/60/PV.23\r\nThe effective liberalization of international trade\r\ncan generate sufficient resources for African\r\neconomies and thus fund various education, health and\r\ninfrastructure programmes. Unfortunately, customs and\r\ntrade barriers that bear down on African exports, as\r\nwell as subsidies to agriculture in the Western\r\ncountries, cancel out the development efforts of the\r\nAfrican countries that are already labouring under the\r\nburden of debt. Debt alone consumes four times more\r\nbudget resources than those we need for education and\r\nhealth. That is why I would like to associate my\r\ncountry’s voice with the call for justice and equity in\r\nseeking sustainable solutions to problems arising from\r\nthe multilateral trade system. Here, I draw particular\r\nattention to access for our products to developed\r\nmarkets and the subsidies and other forms of domestic\r\nsupport granted by the wealthy countries to their\r\nfarmers, which impair the competitiveness of our\r\nproducts on world markets.\r\nThe great challenges facing the world cannot be\r\nmet unless we do it in the overall context of sustained\r\nsolidarity. That is why Côte d’Ivoire is glad to see new\r\ninitiatives put forward by Member States to mobilize\r\nadditional funds or increase funds aimed at fostering\r\ndevelopment in poor countries. We congratulate the\r\nproponents of those initiatives. We would like, inter\r\nalia, to mention the allocation of special drawing rights\r\nand coordinated measures to encourage voluntary\r\nprivate contributions, the international financial facility\r\npresented by the British Government, which has been\r\nsupported by some developed countries, and a\r\nreduction in the price of transferring funds from\r\nmigrants to their countries of origin. In some States,\r\nthose remittances constitute 65 per cent of all\r\ndevelopment assistance. We would also like to mention\r\nthe contribution of a solidarity surcharge on air tickets\r\nin favour of sustained development, a proposal\r\npresented by Germany, Brazil, Chile and France in\r\nSeptember 2004 that seeks to combat hunger, poverty\r\nand fund sustainable development, in particular as\r\nregards combating HIV/AIDS and other pandemics.\r\nWe hope that such new sources of financing along\r\nwith, and as a complement to, traditional financing\r\nresources will effectively contribute to combating\r\npoverty in the world and bring us closer to attaining the\r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs).\r\nAttaining the MDGs is a source of hope for the\r\nCôte d’Ivoire, which has for some years now been\r\ntrying to emerge from the socio-political crisis that has\r\nravaged our country. In the first national Ivorian report\r\non the MDGs, which was issued in 2003 based on the\r\ndata provided in regard to each of the eight\r\ndevelopment goals, it clearly appears that the Goals\r\nwill be difficult to achieve by 2015 if the international\r\ncommunity does not continue to provide financial\r\nsupport, including the cancelling of our considerable\r\nforeign debt. So, I would like to reiterate the appeal of\r\nthe Government of National Reconciliation to the\r\nUnited Nations and to development partners, both\r\nbilateral and multilateral, to help us more in facing the\r\nnew challenges of rebuilding the country, in particular,\r\nreintegrating internally displaced persons and\r\nrehabilitating our infrastructure, be they educational,\r\nhealth-related, cultural, or environmental.\r\nNo country can develop and protect its population\r\nfrom need, if it cannot take effective measures against\r\nthe diseases devastating it, such as malaria,\r\ntuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and other contagious diseases,\r\nwhich pose a serious threat to the entire world,\r\nparticularly the poor countries, and which represent\r\nobstacles to the realization of development goals. That\r\nis why my delegation feels that the international\r\ncommunity should intensify and coordinate its efforts\r\naimed at providing access to generic medicines for\r\npatients in developing countries, including\r\nantiretrovirals. When the time comes, Côte d’Ivoire\r\nwill fully support the world initiative to be launched in\r\n2006 aimed at strengthening the health systems in\r\ndeveloping countries by 2010.\r\nAs regards human rights, my delegation is\r\ngratified by efforts made by the United Nations to\r\nbring about respect for the human person and to\r\ncombat impunity in Côte d’Ivoire. We particularly\r\nappreciate the visit by the High Commissioner for\r\nHuman Rights last July, the visits by various\r\ncommissions to investigate the situation and the visits\r\nby Special Rapporteurs. The Government is still\r\nwaiting to hear the results of the latest international\r\ninvestigation, carried out by the United Nations from\r\nJuly through September 2004, covering important\r\nissues such as impunity, serious violations of human\r\nrights, international humanitarian law and mercenaries.\r\nTrafficking in children has become an increasing\r\nproblem in Africa and particularly in the countries of\r\nWest Africa. West African leaders are aware that only\r\nby fighting together against this shameful trafficking\r\nwill they be able to overcome it. That is why, in\r\naddition to the bilateral agreements already established\r\n6\r\nA/60/PV.23\r\nand at the initiative of Côte d’Ivoire, nine West African\r\nStates, meeting on 27 July 2005 in Abidjan, adopted a\r\nmultilateral cooperation agreement to combat\r\ntrafficking in children in West Africa. This multilateral\r\nlegal instrument contains binding obligations on all the\r\nStates Parties and specific obligations for countries of\r\norigin and destination of children who are the victims\r\nof child trafficking.\r\nAs regards the resolution of conflicts on the\r\nAfrican continent, there has been notable progress\r\nthroughout the year. We are encouraged by positive\r\ndevelopments in Sudan, Burundi, Liberia, Sierra Leone\r\nand the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which\r\nincludes, in some cases, the satisfactory holding of\r\nelections. Nevertheless, despite progress in conflict\r\nsettlement, we must remain aware of the fact that the\r\nsituations, generally speaking, remain fragile. The\r\ninternational community must therefore act more\r\nresolutely to help countries in conflict tackle the\r\ngenuine causes of the conflict, while combating\r\npoverty, consolidating democratic institutions and\r\npromoting those countries’ economic and social\r\ndevelopment.\r\nWhile we can legitimately rejoice at the\r\nresolution of certain conflicts, we must note that,\r\ndeplorably, certain situations are still far from settled.\r\nThis is the case in my country, which has not yet found\r\nthe road to peace, despite the many efforts made by the\r\ninternational community through various initiatives\r\nover the past three years, in particular the Linas-\r\nMarcoussis, Accra and Pretoria Agreements. The\r\nUnited Nations, through the Security Council, has\r\ninvested a great deal of energy in strengthening the\r\npeace and reconciliation process in my country. We\r\nwelcome all the measures taken thus far by the\r\nSecurity Council and are particularly encouraged by\r\nthe fact that more blue helmets have been sent and that\r\nMr. Antonio Monteiro has been appointed as the\r\nUnited Nations High Representative for the elections in\r\nCôte d’Ivoire.\r\nI would like to avail myself of this opportunity to\r\nthank the international community, in particular\r\nPresident Thabo Mbeki of South Africa and other\r\nregional and subregional heads of State and\r\norganizations, for their readiness to help and for their\r\nuntiring efforts to bring about a peaceful solution to the\r\nIvorian crisis. As I stand here before you, the process\r\nis practically at a deadlock and the presidential election\r\nplanned for 30 October will not be held on that date.\r\nHolding free, fair and transparent elections within\r\na reasonable time frame remains the main objective to\r\nbe attained if we are to have sustainable peace in Côte\r\nd’Ivoire. Nevertheless, the following priority tasks\r\nmust first be carried out: disarming and dismantling of\r\nmilitias throughout the country; the disarmament,\r\ndemobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants,\r\nfollowing an initial pre-assembly; the restoration of\r\nState administration throughout the national territory;\r\nthe identification of electors and the establishment of\r\nelectoral rolls — and, in that connection, the soon-to-\r\nbe-operational Independent Electoral Commission is a\r\nbright note; and the provision of funds for\r\ndisarmament, demobilization and reintegration and the\r\nelectoral process.\r\nDespite the current stagnation in the peace and\r\nreconciliation process, the Ivorian Government\r\nimplores the international community not to be\r\novercome by disappointment, discouragement or\r\nirritation. We invite it to participate more intensively\r\nand resolutely in finding solutions to the fundamental\r\nproblems of the crisis, which, alone, can guarantee the\r\nreturn of a lasting and stable peace in my country and\r\nreconcile all our sons and daughters.\r\nIn that regard, the Security Council must remain\r\nactively seized of the case of Côte d’Ivoire, which\r\nmust be kept on its agenda. In the same connection, the\r\nUnited Nations should, in my delegation’s opinion,\r\nseriously consider imposing sanctions on all persons\r\nwho are guilty of serious human rights violations,\r\ninciting hatred and violence, obstructing the peace\r\nprocess or violating the arms embargo throughout the\r\ncountry.\r\nThe Ivorian people need peace. We realize that\r\nthis is primarily the responsibility of the Ivorian people\r\nthemselves. Nevertheless, without the steadfast support\r\nof the international community, peace will be difficult\r\nto achieve. Therefore, I call upon our common\r\nOrganization to shoulder its responsibilities and\r\nbecome even more involved and more active in our\r\nnational peace and reconciliation process. That is its\r\nmandate and the goal of its commitment under Chapter\r\nVII of the Charter.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Allam-Mi Ahmad, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs and African Integration of the\r\nRepublic of Chad.\r\n7\r\nA/60/PV.23\r\nMr. Ahmad (Chad) (spoke in French): On behalf\r\nof my delegation and on my own behalf I would like to\r\nextend our warm congratulations to President Eliasson\r\non his election to the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly at its sixtieth session and to ensure him of\r\nour cooperation in carrying out his noble mission. I\r\nwould also like to congratulate his predecessor, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Jean Ping, who guided our work with\r\ntact, skill and competence throughout his term, in spite\r\nof the delicate and complex issues that were on the\r\nagenda during the fifty-ninth session.\r\nIt is clear that the results that we have reached in\r\nrecent years, both in terms of peacekeeping and in our\r\napproach to development issues, have been made\r\npossible by the commendable commitment and\r\ndevotion of each and every Member, at all levels of\r\nengagement and responsibility. I would specifically\r\nlike to underscore the valuable contribution of\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan, to whom I pay a well\r\ndeserved tribute.\r\nIn his report, entitled “In larger freedom: towards\r\ndevelopment, security and human rights for all”\r\n(A/59/2005), our Secretary-General submitted specific\r\nproposals that we rightfully believe are appropriate\r\nsolutions to our shared concerns. Effective\r\nimplementation of those measures will enhance the\r\neffectiveness and credibility of the United Nations and\r\nwill help us to meet the myriad challenges facing\r\ntoday’s world.\r\nA few days ago the heads of State and\r\nGovernment reviewed the international situation from\r\nthe standpoint of the Millennium Declaration adopted\r\nin 2000 and the implementation of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. The conclusions clearly indicate\r\nthe magnitude of the task that still remains to be\r\naccomplished, despite the efforts made by Member\r\nStates and their national constituents. Those\r\nconclusions, which corroborate the analysis of the\r\nSecretary-General, tell us that times have changed and\r\nthat the world — while it still bears scars from the\r\npast — has already entered into the future. Today, we\r\nare seeing the unparalleled impoverishment of many\r\ncountries and peoples, as well as the emergence of new\r\nabhorrent phenomena, such as terrorism and\r\ntransboundary crime, not to mention the pandemic of\r\nHIV/AIDS and the resurgence of other communicable\r\ndiseases. Given those formidable developments, it is\r\nabsolutely necessary to build a new international\r\nsociety that is more caring, more just and better\r\nmanaged, with the United Nations at its centre.\r\nFor its part, the Government of Chad, since the\r\nestablishment of democracy in 1990, has planned and\r\nimplemented a vast programme of institutional\r\ntransformation that promotes social and economic\r\ndevelopment, peace and security, both domestic and\r\nexternal. Moreover, we held a constitutional\r\nreferendum in June to amend a number of\r\nprovisions — a clear demonstration of our concern to\r\nadapt our institutions to present-day demands, as well\r\nas an opportunity for our people to renew their\r\nconfidence in those institutions.\r\nWhile our country has achieved sufficient\r\nstability within, that is not true of our borders. We are\r\nsuffering from the impacts of an insecurity that is\r\nprevalent among our neighbours, particularly in the\r\nCentral African Republic and the Sudan, with which\r\nChad shares very long borders. Therefore, prompted by\r\nour border security concerns, we have undertaken\r\nmediation initiatives to reconcile the belligerents. For\r\nthose reasons, the Government of Chad took the\r\ninitiative to bring together the parties to the conflict in\r\nDarfur, at Abéché, Chad, in September 2003, to make\r\nthem listen to reason. Since then, the Government has\r\nworked continually and actively towards helping to\r\nreach a negotiated solution to that conflict, with\r\nsupport from the African Union and representatives of\r\nthe international community. Moreover, in spite of his\r\nheavy schedule, President Idriss Deby has become\r\npersonally involved in trying to bring about a pacific\r\nsettlement to that fratricidal conflict.\r\nChad’s mediation led to the conclusion of the\r\nN’Djamena and the Abuja agreements in Nigeria,\r\nwhere talks are still under way to find a comprehensive\r\npolitical agreement and to put an end once and for all\r\nto the crisis that has gone on for far too long. Chad will\r\ncontinue to act as a mediator so that one day the\r\nwestern region of the Sudan can at long last regain its\r\ncalm and stability.\r\nWe deplore the violations of the ceasefire that are\r\ncurrently taking place in Darfur and hope that they will\r\ncease. We must welcome the formation of the new\r\nGovernment of the Sudan and we are hoping that that\r\nwill be an opportunity for an acceleration of the peace\r\nprocess of Abuja.\r\nIn Chad, we are duty-bound to work with our\r\nbrothers in the Sudan, with whom we have historical\r\n8\r\nA/60/PV.23\r\nand geographic ties. But we should not lose sight of the\r\nimpacts and consequences of the conflict, which have\r\ntaken a heavy toll, in particular on the border\r\npopulations. For instance, Chad took a fully sovereign\r\ndecision to welcome more than 200,000 Sudanese\r\nrefugees and is providing many forms of support to\r\nother humanitarian institutions that are operating in the\r\naffected zone. Indeed, the disruption of trade, the\r\ndeterioration of major roads by humanitarian convoys\r\nand all the other costs eat up our meagre resources and\r\nare the most common source of political unrest among\r\nour own people, who feel that they have been\r\nabandoned. Given the scarcity of our resources and the\r\nimmense needs of refugees and populations in refugee\r\nareas, the Government of Chad is counting on\r\nsubstantial assistance from the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nThe positive developments in the situation in the\r\nCentral African Republic are facilitating the restoration\r\nof constitutional order in that brotherly country.\r\nHowever, the incidence of crime spilling across that\r\ncountry’s common borders with Chad and Cameroon is\r\nincreasing. That phenomenon has caused a new flow of\r\nCentral African refugees into Chad and they live in\r\nvery difficult conditions. We call upon the international\r\ncommunity to devote greater attention to their plight.\r\nWe welcome the initiative taken in that regard by\r\nthe United Nations Peacebuilding Support Office in the\r\nCentral African Republic, which brought together\r\nrepresentatives of Cameroon, Chad and the Central\r\nAfrican Republic at Yaoundé on 26 and 27 August to\r\nconsider the phenomenon of insecurity on their\r\ncommon borders and to find solutions to it.\r\nOf course, the insecurity on our borders should\r\nnot cause us to lose sight of other crises in Africa and\r\nthroughout the world. In Africa, we welcome the\r\ndevelopments in Guinea-Bissau, Burundi and Liberia,\r\nto mention only those brotherly countries.\r\nUndoubtedly, the issue of their reconstruction will have\r\nan important place on the agendas of those countries,\r\nof the African Union and of the rest of the world.\r\nOn the other hand, the situation in Côte d’Ivoire\r\ncontinues to concern us. President Mbeki’s mediation\r\nhas not been able to lead — as had been hoped — to\r\nthe immediate holding of presidential elections. We\r\nurge our Ivorian brethren to engage in dialogue.\r\nIn the Middle East, the persistence of the Israeli-\r\nArab conflict continues to poison relations in the\r\nsubregion, even while the withdrawal from the Gaza\r\nStrip is a tangible element in recent developments. We\r\nare convinced that it is only through dialogue that a\r\njust and lasting solution to that conflict can be found.\r\nWith regard to the disagreement between the\r\nPeople’s Republic of China and Taiwan, we appreciate\r\nTaiwan’s tireless efforts to reach a peaceful solution.\r\nThe international community must encourage the two\r\nparties to accept each other. The readmission of Taiwan\r\ninto the United Nations, which we believe to be a\r\nlegitimate demand of that country, would be the point\r\nof departure for such acceptance.\r\nThe interdependence of the concepts of\r\ndevelopment, peace and security is the basis of our\r\ncountry’s support for the Millennium Development\r\nGoals (MDGs). The Millennium Declaration was\r\nundoubtedly a strong signal from the partnership of\r\nrich and poor countries in favour of a fairer, more\r\nbalanced and more united world. In itself, it is a great\r\nendeavour that could lead to the consolidation of\r\nglobal efforts.\r\nMy country has set for itself the same objectives\r\nin its development strategies, plans and programmes as\r\nare found in the Millennium Declaration, particularly\r\nour national poverty reduction strategy and our\r\nnational strategy for good governance. Undoubtedly,\r\nfor most of our countries, achieving the MDGs is not\r\nvery likely, particularly in the areas of promoting peace\r\nand security, good governance and economic and social\r\nreforms.\r\nThere is in Chad, however, a consensus regarding\r\nthe need for sustained progress on those issues and in\r\nother areas related to social, economic and political\r\nlife. The Government of Chad is, therefore, focusing in\r\nparticular on activities relating to the protection of\r\nchildren, the promotion of maternal health, the\r\neducation of girls and the social and professional\r\nintegration of underprivileged groups, particularly\r\nwomen, the elderly and the disabled. In that\r\nconnection, there is no doubt that the partnership\r\nbetween civil society and the private sector is being\r\nstrongly encouraged.\r\nI am not unaware that many delegations may\r\nwonder about the current situation with regard to\r\nsocio-economic development in Chad following the\r\nexploitation of oil there. The fact that Chad joined the\r\nsmall circle of oil exporting countries two years ago,\r\nalthough it caused some euphoria in my country, has\r\n9\r\nA/60/PV.23\r\nnot attracted the expected financial resources.\r\nUnfortunately, Chad, under the agreements linking it to\r\nthe oil consortium, benefits from only a small\r\nproportion of the revenues resulting from its oil. We\r\ncontinue to need the cooperation and assistance of\r\nfriendly countries to supplement our resources, which\r\nstill fall short of our needs. Such cooperation is\r\nessential if we are to carry out our development and\r\nanti-poverty programmes.\r\nAs members are aware, my country’s\r\ndevelopment depends partly on the cotton crop, which\r\nunfortunately is in a state of crisis that is becoming\r\nendemic. That crop, which provides a living for much\r\nof Chad’s population, is dangerously threatened by the\r\nprotectionist practices of developed countries. In fact,\r\nour cotton producers are victims of the subsidy policies\r\nof countries that are supposed to comply with the rules\r\nof international trade. Measures must be taken to limit\r\nthe effects of the market economy, which is\r\nincreasingly restricting our weak economies. We\r\nbelieve that well-regulated economic trade would\r\nensure sustainable development for the least advanced\r\ncountries and would help to build confidence among\r\nStates.\r\nWe are uncertain of reaching a political solution\r\nto the cotton problem, despite the hopes placed in\r\ncontinued multilateral trade negotiations within the\r\nframework of the Doha Round. It is no longer certain\r\nthat developed countries will agree to abandon their\r\nsubsidy practices and implement radical changes in the\r\ncurrent system to meet the expectations of African\r\ncotton growers. That would leave no choice but to\r\nresort to political and legal action under the provisions\r\nof the statutes and rules of the World Trade\r\nOrganization with a view to regulating the cotton\r\nmarket through measures to compensate the losses\r\nsuffered by our producers.\r\nMost Member States had hoped that this sixtieth\r\nsession of the General Assembly would finally achieve\r\nthe democratization of the United Nations. That does\r\nnot yet seem to be the case. But we must not lose\r\nmomentum, and we must continue to work to ensure\r\nthat that objective is attained in the near future. The\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly and of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council and the transformation of\r\nthe Commission on Human Rights into an important\r\nUnited Nations body, as suggested by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, would enable the Organization to be more\r\neffective. In such a restructuring, which remains\r\nrelevant, the issue of Security Council expansion is of\r\ninterest to Member States, particularly those of\r\nAfrica — and quite rightly, because we know that since\r\nthe creation of the United Nations in 1945, no African\r\nState has had a seat on the Council as a permanent\r\nmember with the right of the veto. That injustice\r\nseriously mars the credibility of the United Nations,\r\nand it is time to rectify it.\r\nOur position regarding a new configuration for\r\nthe Security Council remains that which has been\r\nreaffirmed many times by the African Union. It reflects\r\nour firm will to participate in the efforts of the\r\ninternational community under United Nations\r\nauspices aimed at ensuring the maintenance of peace\r\nand security, which are guarantees for sustainable\r\neconomic and social development.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency The Honourable Godfrey Smith,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, Defence and National\r\nEmergency Management Organization of Belize.\r\nMr. Smith (Belize): We congratulate the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly on the assumption\r\nof his office. His extensive experience in multilateral\r\naffairs will undoubtedly be an invaluable asset in our\r\nwork.\r\nThe 2005 world summit has clearly demonstrated\r\nthat, in five years, we have not given poverty\r\neradication the highest priority on our international\r\nagenda.\r\nIt is clear that in too many countries the\r\nMillennium Development Goals will not be realized; in\r\nsome, the situation is worse than five years ago. How\r\nthen do we assure the marginalized people of our world\r\nthat we are serious about achieving the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals by the year 2015? The only way is\r\nby showing that there is the global political will to use\r\nthe outcome document as a platform for action.\r\nIn his report “In larger freedom”, Kofi Annan\r\nstressed that the priority objectives of the United\r\nNations over the coming years should be to secure for\r\npeople “freedom from want” and “freedom from fear”.\r\nWhat is often not recognized is that a person who is not\r\nfree from want can only live in fear.\r\nThe greatest evil — the most effective and\r\nconsuming terrorism of our age — is the terrorism of\r\nabject poverty. It is a poverty in which millions of\r\npeople live in terror because they know that sooner, not\r\n10\r\nA/60/PV.23\r\nlater, they might die from hunger or from preventable\r\ndiseases.\r\nEvery day in our region of Central America and\r\nthe Caribbean, our people face threats to their human\r\nsecurity: from AIDS, drug trafficking, trafficking in\r\nhuman persons, crushing poverty and growing\r\ninequality.\r\nA new security approach is therefore required to\r\ncontain these threats. We must promote the\r\nhumanization of security rather than embark on efforts\r\nto militarize globalization. We must focus on stopping\r\nthe deaths that occur every day, most often from\r\npreventable causes. Global security cannot be built on\r\na minefield of poverty and disease.\r\nPrioritizing human security does not mean\r\nneglecting national sovereignty or State security. As\r\npart of our national security strategy, we remain\r\ncommitted to fostering a culture of peace and the\r\npeaceful resolution of conflicts.\r\nIn the Middle East, we are encouraged by the\r\nIsraeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. We join others\r\nin calling upon the Government of Israel to continue\r\nthe withdrawal from all Palestinian territories. We look\r\nforward to the implementation of its commitments in\r\naccordance with the road map that will lead to the\r\nrealization of two independent States, Palestine and\r\nIsrael, coexisting side by side in peace and security.\r\nThe 23 million people on Taiwan also deserve to\r\nlive in peace and security. We therefore continue to\r\nurge the United Nations to take up the plea of Taiwan\r\nto participate in this world body. Taiwan has earned its\r\nplace among the community of nations.\r\nBelize continues to be plagued by an\r\nanachronistic claim to its territory from our neighbour\r\nGuatemala. But, encouragingly, earlier this month\r\nBelize and Guatemala signed a new agreement under\r\nthe auspices of the Organization of American States.\r\nUnder that agreement, if we are unable to resolve the\r\ndispute through negotiations, the Secretary-General of\r\nthe Organization of American States can then\r\nrecommend that we submit our differences to an\r\ninternational juridical body. We therefore hope that we\r\ncan ensure the early and final resolution of this dispute,\r\nso that we can cooperate more effectively to combat\r\nour common problems of poverty and underdevelopment.\r\nWe all recognize that there can be no security\r\nwithout development. The world summit outcome\r\ndocument maintains the vision of development\r\nelaborated in the Millennium Declaration, the\r\nMonterrey Consensus, the Johannesburg Plan of\r\nImplementation and other outcomes, including the\r\nMauritius Strategy.\r\nIf we are to make measurable progress in\r\ndevelopment, we must urgently implement the global\r\npartnership for development. That global partnership\r\ninvolves returning development issues to the forefront\r\nof trade negotiations. Without a deeper commitment\r\nfrom developed countries to trade regimes that are\r\nmore just, the future of the sugar and banana industries\r\nin countries such as Belize hangs in the balance. We\r\nmust therefore spare no effort to ensure that the latest\r\nDoha development round concludes on terms\r\nfavourable to developing countries like Belize.\r\nAs a coastal nation with a significant population\r\nin low-lying areas, my country emphasizes the need for\r\nnew action to ensure environmental sustainability,\r\nparticularly as it relates to climate change. We agree\r\nwith the Secretary-General that:\r\n“One of the greatest environmental and\r\ndevelopment challenges in the twenty-first\r\ncentury will be that of controlling and coping\r\nwith climate change.” (A/59/2005, para. 60)\r\nThe increased temperatures occasioned by\r\nclimate change are likely to lead to greater frequency\r\nof life-threatening weather systems. The most\r\nvulnerable to these changes will be small island\r\ndeveloping States and coastal nations like Belize. It is\r\ntherefore incumbent upon the international community\r\nto improve the framework for action to cope with\r\nclimate change. The eleventh session of the Conference\r\nof the Parties to the United Nations Framework\r\nConvention on Climate Change is an opportunity to\r\nforge wider and more inclusive cooperation to address\r\nthat grave danger.\r\nSo much of what we hope to achieve depends on\r\na United Nations that is effective and credible. Some\r\nrecent reports point to systemic problems throughout\r\nthe United Nations Organization. These, in our view,\r\nprovide evidence of an Organization that is flawed —\r\nnot one that is irrelevant. Belize therefore continues to\r\nview the United Nations as an indispensable\r\nOrganization. It is the only global Organization that\r\nhas the capacity to meaningfully foster peace, security\r\nand sustainable development for the peoples of our\r\nworld.\r\n11\r\nA/60/PV.23\r\nBut the United Nations must reinvent itself to\r\nmeet the needs of today’s geopolitics and unique global\r\nchallenges. The General Assembly and the Economic\r\nand Social Council must be revitalized and\r\nstrengthened. Similarly, the Security Council must be\r\nreformed to make it more accountable, inclusive and\r\nrepresentative of the current membership of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe establishment of the Peacebuilding\r\nCommission and of the Human Rights Council are\r\nimportant, but we must define ways in which these\r\nbodies can reinforce the work of the other principal\r\norgans of the United Nations.\r\nIn the five years that have elapsed since the year\r\n2000, our collective lack of political will has resulted\r\nin the loss of millions of children, women and men to\r\nhunger, disease, HIV/AIDS and other preventable\r\ncauses. But we can halt and reverse that trend. We must\r\ngive a reformed United Nations, as the ultimate\r\nexpression of multilateralism, the means to carry out\r\nits mandate, as set out in Article I of the Charter: “To\r\nachieve international cooperation in solving international\r\nproblems of an economic, social, cultural or\r\nhumanitarian character”.\r\nOur world is besieged by such problems. We can\r\ncarry out this mandate by implementing all the\r\ncommitments we have made since the year 2000, or we\r\ncan ignore them and condemn many millions more to\r\nlive in misery or die in pain. The choice is ours.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Rogatien Biaou, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs and African Integration of Benin.\r\nMr. Biaou (Benin) (spoke in French): Allow me\r\nfirst of all to pay tribute to Mr. Jean Ping, who guided\r\nthe work of the fifty-ninth session of the General\r\nAssembly with great energy. He had the tremendous\r\nresponsibility of negotiating the United Nations\r\nreforms adopted by our heads of State or Government\r\non Friday, 16 September. We commend him on his\r\ncourage, his faith in the future of the United Nations\r\nand the wisdom and vision with which he discharged\r\nhis functions.\r\nThe tasks facing Mr. Jan Eliasson are inspiring\r\nand crucially important. His presidency marks the\r\nbeginning of the implementation phase of the major\r\ndecisions taken by our heads of State or Government\r\non reform. We are grateful to him for focusing the\r\nwork of the sixtieth session on this topic.\r\nMy delegation has another good reason to be\r\npleased at seeing Mr. Eliasson presiding over our work:\r\nthe importance his country attaches to development\r\nissues and its very sizeable contribution to the efforts\r\nof the international community to eliminate poverty\r\nthroughout the world. Our two countries, Benin and\r\nSweden, successfully co-chaired the General\r\nAssembly’s Open-ended Working Group on an Agenda\r\nfor Development. All of this bodes well for this\r\nsession.\r\nThe eradication of poverty tops the priority list of\r\nthe Benin Government. In this context, we negotiated\r\nand adopted, with the Bretton Woods institutions, a\r\nPoverty Reduction Strategy Paper. Its effective\r\nimplementation, jointly with our Government’s plan of\r\naction and our national studies on long-term prospects,\r\nentitled “Benin 2005: ALAFIA”, should set into\r\nmotion progress that will bring about the achievement\r\nof the Millennium Development Goals. However, it\r\nwill still be necessary for the efforts carried out with\r\nour bilateral and multilateral development partners to\r\nconverge to improve the situation in the seven critical\r\nareas for making aid to least developed countries\r\neffective. These are: substantially reducing the external\r\ndebt burden of least developed countries so they can\r\ndevote greater domestic resources to eliminating\r\npoverty; strengthening institutional capacity to attract\r\nforeign direct investment and develop free enterprise;\r\ndiversifying the destinations of foreign direct\r\ninvestment; promoting public sector/private sector\r\npartnership in least developed countries to promote\r\nrural development; strengthening the impact of\r\nremittances from our diaspora; the promotion of South-\r\nSouth investment to improve the availability of\r\nproducts on markets; and, strengthening the potential\r\nof microcredit to eliminate poverty.\r\nWe are gratified at the decision taken in\r\nGleneagles, Scotland, by the Group of Eight (G-8) to\r\ncompletely cancel the debt of 18 highly indebted poor\r\ncountries, 13 of which are least developed countries.\r\nWe urgently appeal to donor countries to seriously\r\nconsider the possibility of extending the benefit of this\r\nnew positive measure to all least developed countries.\r\nThe Coordinating Bureau of the Least Developed\r\nCountries, which my country has had the honour of\r\nchairing since 2002, will continue consulting with\r\n12\r\nA/60/PV.23\r\ninternational financial institutions and development\r\npartners in close cooperation with the High\r\nRepresentative for the Least Developed Countries,\r\nLandlocked Developing Countries and Small Island\r\nDeveloping States, to bring about meaningful progress\r\nin all these areas. This is the context of the ministerial\r\nconference of the least developed countries on\r\nremittances from migrant workers. The conference will\r\nbe held in Cotonou, Benin, in February 2006, not in\r\nOctober 2005 as originally planned. In the context of\r\nthis conference, the 50 least developed countries are\r\nplanning to set up an international monitoring body for\r\nfunds transfers by migrant workers; it will be open to\r\nall States. We urge all United Nations Member States\r\nto support this initiative, which is intended to\r\nstrengthen the impact of these transferred resources on\r\nthe development of recipient countries.\r\nIn addition to these considerations that directly\r\naffect the least developed countries, there is an urgent\r\nneed to promote and give appropriate weight to the\r\ndevelopment agenda within the context of multilateral\r\ntrade negotiations in the World Trade Organization and\r\nto translate into deeds the firm commitments by the\r\ncountries concerned on the elimination of agricultural\r\nsubsidies, in particular those for cotton, to which my\r\ncountry attaches particular importance. Such a measure\r\nwould remove a considerable handicap on developing\r\ncountries’ efforts to fully take advantage of their\r\ncomparative advantages in order to become fully\r\nintegrated into the world economy. We reaffirm that it\r\nis indispensable that access to world markets be\r\ncoupled with measures to strengthen the supply of\r\nproducts from developing countries through adequate\r\nsupport for the local processing of commodities.\r\nNo initiative, no measure, no activity and no\r\ndecision in the field of development can be successful\r\nwithout peace. It is of particular concern that, on\r\nessential matters such as disarmament and non-\r\nproliferation of nuclear weapons, the United Nations\r\ncannot forge the required consensus to secure the long-\r\nterm survival of our planet in view of the potential for\r\nself-destruction that has built up. These questions\r\nshould be considered calmly, with the higher interests\r\nof humankind in mind, setting aside the particular\r\ninterest of any country in pursuing some hypothetical\r\npower that would reduce security for each and every\r\none of us.\r\nBenin has no objection to the peaceful use of\r\nnuclear power to serve the energy needs of the planet,\r\nbut it feels that any effort to divert peaceful\r\nprogrammes to military programmes runs counter to a\r\nvision of collective security based on promoting\r\ndisarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of\r\nmass destruction.\r\nOur heads of State or Government decided to\r\nconfirm the Security Council’s key role as the organ\r\nwith primary responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. We urge all members\r\nof the Assembly to commit themselves to ensuring that\r\nthe Security Council is expanded to make it more\r\nrepresentative and better able to counter old and new\r\nthreats to international peace and security.\r\nIn the 60 years of existence of the United\r\nNations, the Security Council has with varying degrees\r\nof success, worked to manage and settle armed\r\nconflicts. It has been able to respond to breaches of\r\ninternational peace and security, but it has not always\r\nbeen able to take action to stop or reverse events that\r\nhave led to an explosion of violence or armed conflict.\r\nGiven the loss of human life and the massive\r\ndestruction of property as a result of current threats, it\r\nis high time for the Security Council to attach higher\r\npriority to conflict prevention, in the spirit of Article\r\n34 of the Charter, which states that\r\n“The Security Council may investigate any\r\ndispute, or any situation which might lead to\r\ninternational friction or give rise to a dispute, in\r\norder to determine whether the continuance of the\r\ndispute or situation is likely to endanger the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security”.\r\nIf we look at the spirit and the letter of this\r\nprovision, the Security Council is definitely competent\r\nto analyse and monitor situations involving the risk of\r\nconflict or a breach of the peace anywhere in the world\r\nand to become actively involved in managing crises\r\nbefore conflict breaks out or threats materialize. It is in\r\nthat light that we must view Security Council\r\nresolution 1625 (2005), adopted at the 14 September\r\n2005 Council summit at the initiative of the three\r\nAfrican members of the Security Council, led by my\r\ncountry, Benin.\r\nIn the context of Security Council reform, the\r\nGeneral Assembly should consider the subject of a\r\nproactive approach and reflect on how to structure\r\nsupport mechanisms in order to enable the Council to\r\neffectively play its role in the prevention of conflicts\r\nand of threats to international peace and security.\r\n13\r\nA/60/PV.23\r\nPeace remains an invaluable and incalculable\r\ngood. We share the concerns expressed recently by the\r\nSecretary-General at the launch of his Alliance of\r\nCivilizations initiative. That constructive initiative\r\nshould be made part of the framework of activities to\r\ncounter threats to our world, including terrorism,\r\nwhose predominant religious ties lend credence to\r\ntheories of a clash of civilizations leading to certain\r\nchaos. Benin supports the Alliance of Civilizations\r\ninitiative, which aims to restore peace in our hearts and\r\namong religions so that weapons will fall silent and our\r\npeoples will be able to express their aspirations for\r\npeace.\r\nWe join the quest for peace of those peoples who\r\nlack peace today. We express our solidarity with\r\npeoples suffering armed conflicts in Africa, the Middle\r\nEast, Asia, Latin America and Europe. The\r\nOrganization must redouble its efforts to help them\r\nprocure national concord, understanding and cohesion.\r\nIn that context, we are pursuing a thoroughgoing\r\ncampaign against the recruitment and the use of\r\nchildren in armed conflicts. Now that the Security\r\nCouncil has adopted its resolution 1612 (2005), the\r\nGeneral Assembly, for its part, should establish an\r\nopen-ended working group to consider proposals for\r\nactions to redefine that scourge as a crime against\r\nhumanity instead of a war crime. We are counting on\r\neveryone’s support to make that initiative a reality.\r\nIn the Middle East, the withdrawal of the\r\noccupying Power from the Gaza Strip and part of the\r\nWest Bank brings us closer, fortunately, to our common\r\nvision of an independent State of Palestine living side\r\nby side with the State of Israel within secure and\r\ninternationally recognized borders. We believe that the\r\nQuartet’s road map can lead the Israeli and Palestinian\r\npeoples to that goal. We call upon their leaders to\r\nremain committed to the route of peace.\r\nWe ask the same of Iraqi leaders and urge them to\r\nspare no effort to ensure that all Iraqi communities\r\nparticipate in the transition process leading to the\r\nrestoration of peace and the strengthening of the\r\ncountry’s unity. We make the same appeal to\r\nAfghanistan, Liberia and Côte d’Ivoire, among others.\r\nIn the same spirit of dialogue, we welcome the\r\nsignificant progress made in resolving the conflicts of\r\nWest Africa through the cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Economic Community of West\r\nAfrican States aimed at promoting dynamic\r\npeacebuilding processes for the gradual return of\r\nnormality in the countries affected by conflict and for\r\npreventing the spread of conflict, through an\r\nintegrated, regional approach.\r\nWe invite all Ivorian parties to overcome their\r\ndifferences of view and give peace and stability a\r\nchance in the West African subregion. The holding of\r\nthe International Conference on the Great Lakes\r\nRegion and the remarkable success achieved by the\r\ntransition processes in the Central African Republic\r\nand Burundi have restored the prospects of the entire\r\nregion. We encourage the countries concerned to reach\r\na regional agreement for peace, security, good\r\ngovernance and development in the framework of the\r\nsecond regional summit, to be held in Nairobi, and to\r\nscrupulously implement that agreement in order to\r\npromote peace, stability and prosperity in the region.\r\nThose regional initiatives require enhanced\r\nassistance from the international community if the\r\ntransition in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is\r\nto be a success. In that context, Benin intends to pursue\r\nits policy of active participation in peacekeeping\r\noperations. Our country stands ready to increase its\r\ncontribution to the international community’s efforts in\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo in order to\r\nsupport the democratic transition process under way.\r\nIn East Africa, the United Nations and the\r\nAfrican Union have formed an unprecedented\r\npartnership to restore peace in the Sudan and put an\r\nend to the humanitarian crisis in Darfur, in the spirit of\r\nChapter VIII of the Charter. Such a partnership is\r\nessential also in Somalia. In that context, it is in the\r\ninterest of the United Nations to assist the African\r\nUnion in establishing and organizing its peacekeeping\r\ncapacities, in particular by strengthening the structures\r\nfor planning and for training national and subregional\r\ncontingents of the African standby force.\r\nAnother essential element to which we attach\r\ngreat importance, and which we hope to see realized\r\npromptly, relates to the decision taken by our heads of\r\nState or Government on the establishment of a standing\r\npolice force. The establishment of such a force should\r\ntake into consideration the need for linguistic balance\r\nin accordance with short-term and medium-term\r\ndeployment needs. The modalities of the force’s\r\ncomposition should be defined promptly. To that end,\r\nwe propose carrying out a rapid evaluation of present\r\nworldwide human resources and of Member States’\r\n14\r\nA/60/PV.23\r\ncapacity to train police officers. A rational process in\r\nthat area would consist of taking best advantage of\r\nthose capacities and giving all Member States an equal\r\nopportunity for participation in the new force.\r\nBeyond peacemaking action, the need to help\r\ncountries emerging from armed conflict remain on the\r\npath of peace and overcome the risk of relapse\r\nconstitutes a real challenge to which we have\r\nadequately responded through our reflections on the\r\nrole of the United Nations. That is the reason behind\r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission. The consensus on this\r\nquestion does honour to the Organization. The\r\nCommission must become operational as soon as\r\npossible to strengthen action to assist countries that\r\nhave undertaken particularly difficult democratic\r\ntransitions, such as Burundi, the Central African\r\nRepublic and Guinea-Bissau, if their Governments\r\nrequest such assistance.\r\nCountries facing an ongoing state of social\r\nemergency can improve their chances for lasting\r\nstability only if the international community mobilizes\r\nthe necessary resources to help restore a minimum of\r\nnormality by ensuring that those States can exercise\r\ntheir sovereign rights in the areas of security and the\r\nprovision of essential social services such as health\r\ncare, child education, transport and access to financial\r\nresources.\r\nThe success of disarmament, demobilization and\r\nreintegration programmes in all their aspects is\r\ndecisive for making a peace process irreversible and\r\nfor guarding against the risk of the spread of conflict\r\ncaused by the dispersion of former combatants that\r\nhave not successfully reintegrated into productive civil\r\nsociety. The international community must ensure that\r\nthe reintegration component of those programmes also\r\nreceives adequate financing.\r\nIn the same context, the Human Rights Council\r\nmust take its place in the machinery of the United\r\nNations. Its mandate, size, structure and operational\r\nprocedures must take into account the requirements of\r\nrepresentativity, credibility and effectiveness by\r\ndrawing all lessons from the experience and the\r\npractices of the Commission on Human Rights, which\r\nit is intended to replace. In that regard, the new\r\nCouncil must become the preferred instrument for\r\nidentifying cases in which the international community\r\nshould exercise its responsibility to protect\r\npopulations. In that regard, the Human Rights Council\r\nalso has a crucial role to play as an early-warning\r\nstructure within the United Nations system and as a\r\nkey element of its conflict-prevention machinery.\r\nWe cannot conclude without underlining our full\r\nsupport for the excellent idea of the Government of\r\nSweden to create a network of heads of State and other\r\nworld leaders to monitor effective implementation of\r\nUnited Nations reform.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now\r\ncall on Her Excellency Mrs. Rita Kieber-Beck,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Principality of\r\nLiechtenstein.\r\nMrs. Kieber-Beck (Liechtenstein): One week\r\nago, the world summit sent a message of hope for\r\npeace, development and human rights for all, and took\r\na number of steps towards institutional reform at the\r\nUnited Nations. The summit meeting has achieved\r\nmuch. It has also left a lot undone and has not met our\r\nexpectations in several areas. We agree with the\r\nGeneral Assembly President’s assessment that only the\r\nwork we do over the next few months will allow us a\r\nfinal assessment of the value of the outcome document.\r\nThe summit certainly did not achieve the\r\ncomprehensive breakthrough we had hoped for. We\r\ntherefore look forward to working under the\r\nPresident’s guidance on the follow-up and\r\nimplementation and welcome the fact that he has\r\nstarted this process immediately. Institutional change\r\nmust be the focus of our attention over the next few\r\nmonths, both through the creation of new bodies and\r\nthe adaptation of existing ones. We will give particular\r\nattention to the Human Rights Council, the Security\r\nCouncil, the General Assembly and the Secretariat.\r\nWe shared the general relief at the last-minute\r\nagreement on the outcome document, since a lack of\r\nsuch agreement would have been disastrous. We had\r\ncreated expectations that were much higher than what\r\nwe could have possibly achieved, at a time when the\r\nUnited Nations seemed more in need of reform than\r\never before. The reputation and the worldwide image\r\nof the United Nations is clearly not what it used to\r\nbe — the oil-for-food scandal, cases of sexual\r\nexploitation by United Nations peacekeepers, inaction\r\nin the face of mass crimes and humanitarian crises\r\nhave overshadowed the many success stories that this\r\nOrganization has to tell.\r\n15\r\nA/60/PV.23\r\nIt is important to move on from the oil-for-food\r\nscandal. Moving on, however, must not mean that we\r\nignore, yet again, the fact that the massive abuse and\r\nmismanagement revealed in the Volcker reports are but\r\none expression of what is a systemic problem. Too\r\nmuch went wrong in the oil-for-food programme, and\r\neverybody involved failed in their responsibilities in\r\none way or another, including the Security Council. No\r\nbureaucracy can be changed overnight, as we all know\r\nfrom our national experience; but it is clear that only a\r\nmore accountable Secretariat, one that works without\r\nundue pressure from us, the Member States, can restore\r\nthe confidence of the peoples it is meant to serve.\r\nAccountability must also be a key principle for\r\nthe intergovernmental bodies and thus guide us in our\r\nwork on the relevant reforms. We are concerned at the\r\nincreasingly skewed institutional balance within the\r\nOrganization. The Security Council has clearly taken\r\non a role that goes far beyond the central place it was\r\ngiven under the Charter. Indeed, its activities are\r\nincreasingly venturing into the domains reserved for\r\nthe General Assembly, in particular.\r\nThis entails a twofold risk. On the one hand,\r\nmany countries increasingly feel a lack of ownership of\r\nthe Organization, although collective ownership based\r\non the principle of sovereign equality is one of the\r\ncornerstones of the Organization. On the other hand,\r\nthe Security Council is at risk of being paralysed by the\r\nsheer amount of issues on its agenda. The answer to\r\nthis challenge is clear: we need a stronger General\r\nAssembly that asserts its central role and carries out its\r\nfunctions effectively. In parallel, the Security Council\r\nmust become more transparent and accountable in\r\norder to truly carry out its functions on behalf of the\r\nentire membership.\r\nThe lack of a solution to the complex issue of\r\nSecurity Council reform is a disappointment to many.\r\nEnlargement and a more representative Council are\r\nclear necessities, and we will do our part to achieve an\r\nearly solution, with the strongest possible political\r\nsupport. In addition, and not less importantly, we must\r\nalso improve the working methods of the Security\r\nCouncil, as stated in the World Summit Outcome\r\n(resolution 60/1). Transparency, accountability and\r\nstronger involvement of States that are not members of\r\nthe Council are of decisive importance to enable it to\r\ntruly act on behalf of the membership, as mandated by\r\nthe Charter. We will work hard for early and concrete\r\nresults, since effective changes in the daily workings of\r\nthe Council would benefit the entire membership.\r\nWe routinely repeat our annual call for a stronger\r\nGeneral Assembly. Small steps are taken every year,\r\nand all of them are important. It appears to us,\r\nhowever, that the most essential efforts to revitalize the\r\nGeneral Assembly do not come from measures\r\ncontained in General Assembly resolutions. Rather,\r\nMember States must ensure that the Assembly is seized\r\nwith truly relevant topics that are treated efficiently\r\nand effectively. We may deplore the migration of topics\r\nto the Security Council that we think should be dealt\r\nwith instead by the General Assembly. This trend,\r\nhowever, will continue unabated unless the Assembly\r\nproves to be a central decision-making body that takes\r\nits responsibilities seriously. The Assembly is what we,\r\nas Member States, want it to be. A genuine and\r\nsustained effort is, therefore, required from all of us.\r\nWe continue to fully support the early\r\nestablishment of a Human Rights Council to replace\r\nthe Commission on Human Rights. Like others, we\r\nwere disappointed at the meagre substance on this\r\ntopic that found its way into the outcome document.\r\nThe Organization needs a standing body that\r\neffectively promotes human rights worldwide, swiftly\r\nresponds to gross and systematic violations of human\r\nrights and reflects the importance of human rights for\r\nthis Organization. Close cooperation with a\r\nstrengthened Office of the High Commissioner for\r\nHuman Rights will be essential. The Council must not\r\nduplicate the work carried out by other bodies, in\r\nparticular the General Assembly. It must, therefore, not\r\nbe a remake of the Commission on Human Rights with\r\na new label. We look forward to working with the\r\npresidency towards an early solution that would add\r\nconcrete value for the protection and promotion of\r\nhuman rights.\r\nMr. Loizaga (Paraguay), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nWe consider the recognition of the “responsibility\r\nto protect” as one of the most positive elements in the\r\noutcome document. The main obligation for its\r\nimplementation naturally falls to the Security Council.\r\nThe Council has to ensure that disgraceful inaction,\r\nsuch as in the case of the genocide in Rwanda, cannot\r\never occur again. When the lives of innocent civilians\r\nare at stake, such a responsibility must not be\r\ncompromised by political considerations. Collective\r\n16\r\nA/60/PV.23\r\naction to prevent and respond to genocide, crimes\r\nagainst humanity and war crimes must, therefore, not\r\nbe made impossible by a veto or threat of veto by one\r\nof the permanent members of the Council. We hope\r\nthat the Council will stand up to the challenge raised\r\nby the summit. The membership as a whole clearly has\r\na shared obligation in this respect.\r\nOur achievement in the Summit Outcome on the\r\n“responsibility to protect” stands in stark contrast to\r\nour silence on the importance of fighting impunity for\r\nthe worst crimes of international concern. More\r\nprogress has been made in this area in the past few\r\nyears than in almost any other area of international\r\nrelations. Transitional justice is now an inevitable\r\nelement of any serious effort to help societies in post-\r\nconflict situations. There is now a close and well-\r\nestablished relationship between the International\r\nCriminal Court and the United Nations, in particular\r\nafter the Security Council decision to mandate the\r\nCourt to investigate the crimes in Darfur. We trust that\r\nefforts to fight impunity will remain a high priority for\r\nthe Organization, recognizing the central role of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court in that respect.\r\nWhile it may be premature to pronounce a final\r\njudgement on the value of the outcome document, one\r\nthing can be said with certainty: that document is a\r\nreflection of what is agreeable five years after the\r\nMillennium Summit. It is remarkable how uneven\r\nprogress has been in several areas. Major advances,\r\nsuch as the decision to fill an institutional void by\r\ncreating a Peacebuilding Commission, are\r\naccompanied by major failures, such as the absence of\r\nany agreement in the area of disarmament and non-\r\nproliferation. We have no choice but to build on the\r\npositive elements of the Summit Outcome and to find\r\nearly solutions to institutional questions, in particular.\r\nProgress in those areas should help us to intensify our\r\nwork and eventually to find agreement on unresolved\r\nquestions in vital areas such as disarmament and non-\r\nproliferation. In this way, we can make the summit a\r\nturning point in the history of the United Nations.\r\nTwo years ago, the Secretary-General said that\r\nwe had reached a fork in the road; that observation was\r\nrepeated many times during the process leading up to\r\nthe summit. So where are we today? Looking back at\r\nwhat we have achieved, it seems that we have taken the\r\nadvice of Yogi Berra, one of the great legends of the\r\nCity of New York, who said: “When you come to a\r\nfork in the road, take it!”\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Lyonpo Khandu\r\nWangchuk, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nKingdom of Bhutan.\r\nMr. Wangchuk (Bhutan): Allow me to begin by\r\nextending my delegation’s warmest congratulations to\r\nthe President upon his assumption of the office of the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixtieth\r\nsession. We have full confidence in his ability to guide\r\nour deliberations to a successful conclusion. I also pay\r\ntribute to his predecessor, Mr. Jean Ping, for skilfully\r\nconducting the work of the fifty-ninth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and for his efforts in preparing the\r\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting, held from 14 to\r\n16 September 2005.\r\nIt is appropriate that the theme for the sixtieth\r\nsession of the General Assembly is “For a stronger and\r\nmore effective United Nations: the follow-up and\r\nimplementation of the High-level Plenary Meeting in\r\nSeptember 2005”.\r\nIndeed, this session has the responsibility to\r\nimplement the decisions of the High-level Plenary\r\nMeeting. Our leaders have clearly pronounced that the\r\ngoals and objectives of the Millennium Summit and\r\nother United Nations conferences and summits\r\nrepresent the minimum required to deal with the issues\r\nand challenges of our time. Their message is that 2005\r\nshould be a year for concrete action to deliver on those\r\ngoals and objectives. We must, therefore, summon\r\npolitical will and assume moral responsibility to work\r\ntruly for the benefit of our peoples on whose behalf we\r\ngather at the United Nations year after year.\r\nIn the report “In larger freedom: towards\r\ndevelopment, security and human rights for all”\r\n(A/59/2005), the Secretary-General argues that the\r\nprinciples and purposes of the United Nations\r\ncontained in the Charter remain as valid and relevant\r\ntoday as they were in 1945 and that what is now\r\nrequired is for practice and organization to move with\r\nthe times. My delegation fully agrees with that view.\r\nOur work must always be guided by the Charter, but\r\nour approach must adapt to changing circumstances\r\nand challenges. In doing so, we must move beyond\r\nnarrow national perspectives and interests and treat all\r\nissues in a balanced and holistic manner.\r\nAs I stated at the High-level Plenary Meeting last\r\nweek, my delegation supports all initiatives to\r\nstrengthen the United Nations and its institutions. Of\r\n17\r\nA/60/PV.23\r\nsignificant interest to my delegation is the\r\nstrengthening of this Assembly, which is the only\r\nuniversal body in the United Nations. There is a clear\r\nconsensus within the membership on the need for\r\nurgent and wide-ranging reform of the United Nations,\r\nalthough differences remain on the nature and extent of\r\nreform. The 2005 World Summit Outcome has\r\nentrusted the sixtieth session with implementation of\r\ncertain reform decisions and at the same time with\r\ncarrying out further discussions and negotiations in\r\nareas where consensus has not been reached. We must\r\ncontinue with our efforts to find consensus in those\r\nareas.\r\nAmong the issues that are unresolved is the\r\nreform of the Security Council. We have debated this\r\nissue for well over a decade, but have not yet reached a\r\ndecision. My country continues to call for early action\r\nto enlarge the permanent and non-permanent\r\nmembership of the Security Council and to improve its\r\nworking methods. In this context, we reiterate our\r\nsupport to include Brazil, Germany, India and Japan as\r\npermanent members. Those countries have\r\ndemonstrated their capacity and will to contribute to\r\nworld peace and security. We also believe that Africa\r\nshould be adequately represented by permanent\r\nmembership on the Council.\r\nDevelopment is the most immediate and pressing\r\nissue for the vast majority of Member States. No other\r\nissue can be as central as development when millions\r\nlive in deprivation and despair; and global peace and\r\nsecurity cannot be truly achieved without advancing\r\ndevelopment. In fact, partnership in other areas cannot\r\nbe sustained without genuine international cooperation\r\nin development.\r\nThe shortfalls in our commitments to the\r\nMillennium Summit and other major United Nations\r\nconferences and summits are all too clear. More needs\r\nto be done urgently to address the hurdles of\r\ndevelopment, which range from finance to debt, trade,\r\nglobal governance and systemic issues, the\r\nenvironment and science and technology.\r\nAdequate and predictable sources of financing are\r\ncrucial for the success of development efforts. We\r\ntherefore welcome ideas for innovative sources of\r\nfunding and calls for increased official development\r\nassistance (ODA). In this regard, my delegation would\r\nlike to commend those countries that have achieved or\r\nexceeded the ODA target of 0.7 per cent of gross\r\nnational product (GNP). We welcome the timetable\r\nestablished by some countries to achieve the ODA\r\ntarget by 2015 and urge others to do so expeditiously.\r\nWe also urge that 0.2 per cent of GNP be allocated to\r\nleast developed countries to enable them to achieve the\r\ngoals and objectives of the Brussels Programme of\r\nAction and the Millennium Development Goals\r\n(MDGs). The recent decision of the Group of 8 (G-8)\r\nto cancel the external debt of 18 highly indebted poor\r\ncountries, including 13 least developed countries, is a\r\nwelcome move. My delegation is hopeful that the same\r\nconsideration will be given to all least developed\r\ncountries.\r\nAs a small, least developed and landlocked\r\ncountry, Bhutan sees official development assistance as\r\nits primary source of financing for development. In this\r\nregard, my delegation would like to place on record its\r\ndeep appreciation of the bilateral and multilateral\r\npartners that are actively supporting our development\r\nefforts. Despite a significant increase in its own\r\nresources, my country will have to rely on ODA for\r\nsome time in its efforts to realize the MDGs as well as\r\nfor overall development.\r\nThe continued support of the international\r\ncommunity for our development efforts is crucial at the\r\npresent juncture. Decades of gradual but deliberate\r\nchange in the system of governance of the country,\r\nspearheaded by His Majesty King Jigme Singye\r\nWangchuck, are entering a critical phase. A draft\r\nconstitution for the country is currently under\r\ndiscussion. Its adoption in the near future will\r\ntransform the country into a parliamentary democracy.\r\nFor this system of governance to succeed, it is\r\nimperative that the country be able to maintain the\r\ncurrent level of progress in the social, economic and\r\nother fields.\r\nMy country attaches great importance to the\r\nconservation and protection of the environment, as\r\nhuman life is fundamentally dependent on natural\r\nsystems and resources. There cannot be sustainable\r\ndevelopment without environmental sustainability. We\r\nmust commit ourselves to meeting the goals of, inter\r\nalia, the World Summit on Sustainable Development,\r\nAgenda 21 and the Kyoto Protocol. In Bhutan, we have\r\nmade serious efforts to integrate the principles and\r\npractices of environmental sustainability into our\r\ndevelopment policies and programmes. As a result of\r\nour conservation efforts, Bhutan has successfully\r\nmaintained 72.5 per cent of its land area under forest\r\n18\r\nA/60/PV.23\r\ncover. Our modest achievement in this area was duly\r\nrecognized by the United Nations Environment\r\nProgramme (UNEP) in April 2005 when it awarded to\r\nHis Majesty the King and the people of Bhutan a\r\nUNEP Champions of the Earth 2005 award.\r\nMy country fully supports the establishment of a\r\nworldwide early warning system for all natural\r\nhazards. Situated in a very fragile mountain ecosystem,\r\nBhutan is prone to glacial floods and other natural\r\ndisasters, including earthquakes. The solidarity that the\r\ninternational community demonstrated last year when\r\nmany countries in the Indian Ocean rim were\r\ndevastated by the tsunami was exemplary and is worth\r\nreplicating in other areas.\r\nTerrorism is a pernicious threat to peace and\r\nsecurity. It cannot be justified under any\r\ncircumstances. It is imperative for the international\r\ncommunity to act resolutely to root out this menace.\r\nWe condemn terrorism in all its forms and\r\nmanifestations. Bhutan supports all efforts to conclude\r\na comprehensive convention on international terrorism\r\nand other initiatives. Small and poor developing\r\ncountries are particularly vulnerable and are in need of\r\ninternational support to fight terrorism. They are also\r\nvulnerable to transnational crime and need assistance\r\nto deal with it.\r\nInternational migration is on the increase today.\r\nMigration offers opportunities and at the same time\r\npresents serious challenges to both source and recipient\r\ncountries. Associated with it is the problem of illegal\r\nimmigration, which presents serious challenges,\r\nparticularly to small countries such as my own. It is\r\ntherefore important for a high-level dialogue on\r\ninternational migration and development to be held by\r\nthe General Assembly in 2006 to address all issues\r\nassociated with migration.\r\nMy delegation supports the Secretary-General’s\r\ncontinuing efforts to organize annual multilateral treaty\r\nevents in conjunction with General Assembly sessions.\r\nIn this context, we are pleased to report to the\r\nAssembly that Bhutan acceded to the following treaties\r\nlast week: the United Nations Convention against\r\nCorruption; the Optional Protocol to the Convention on\r\nthe Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children\r\nin Armed Conflict; and the Optional Protocol to the\r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child on the Sale of\r\nChildren, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography.\r\nBhutan, as a responsible Member State, fully\r\nupholds all relevant international treaties and\r\nconventions. However, our desire to accede to them is\r\nconsistently constrained by lack of capacity to deal\r\nwith the range of issues they contain and by the\r\ndifficulties of meeting reporting and other obligations.\r\nThis is a serious hurdle faced by many small countries,\r\nespecially least developed countries. There is a genuine\r\nneed to look at ways to simplify reporting and other\r\nobligations and to provide technical and financial\r\nassistance to countries in need.\r\nWe must heed the call of the Secretary-General\r\nwho has said,\r\n“Our action must be as urgent as the need,\r\nand on the same scale. ... Only by acting\r\ndecisively now can we both confront the pressing\r\nsecurity challenges and win a decisive victory in\r\nthe global battle against poverty by 2015”.\r\n(A/59/2005, para. 23)\r\nWe believe that the time to act is now. We must not let\r\nthe opportunity slip. I wish the General Assembly\r\ncontinued success at this session.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ngive the floor to Her Excellency Ms. Rosemary Banks,\r\nchairperson of the delegation of New Zealand.\r\nMs. Banks (New Zealand): Sixty years ago,\r\nPrime Minister Peter Fraser of New Zealand told\r\nrepresentatives to the San Francisco Conference that its\r\nsole aim should be\r\n“the setting up of a world organization that will\r\nreally work, and that will be the background for\r\nan orderly progress towards security, prosperity\r\nand happiness for all the people of all nations”.\r\nThe new organization would only work, he said, if its\r\nmembers were determined to stand by their\r\ncommitments and principles.\r\nToday the essential concept of the United Nations\r\nremains robust. We can be justly proud of its\r\nachievements in many areas including humanitarian\r\nassistance, development and peacekeeping. But we\r\nhave collectively underperformed in others, sometimes\r\nwith tragic results.\r\nOur task this sixtieth anniversary is twofold: first,\r\nto recommit ourselves as Member States to the\r\nenduring vision and values of the Charter and,\r\n19\r\nA/60/PV.23\r\nsecondly, to retool the United Nations machinery to\r\nmeet the challenges of the twenty-first century.\r\nThe Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1) provides\r\nthe blueprint for the way forward. New Zealand would\r\nhave liked more progress in a number of areas, such as\r\nmore detailed agreement on the establishment of the\r\nHuman Rights Council and more authority to the\r\nSecretary-General to manage resources in return for\r\ngreater accountability. We deeply regret the failure to\r\nendorse further disarmament and non-proliferation\r\nmeasures.\r\nBut we are encouraged by the many significant\r\nadvances, including recognition of the need for more\r\nand better aid, establishment of the Peacebuilding\r\nCommission, a doubling of resources for the Office of\r\nthe Commissioner for Human Rights and the\r\nrecognition of our shared “responsibility to protect”.\r\nWe have as our theme for the General Assembly\r\nimplementation of our summit undertakings. We share\r\naccountability for getting the job done. I shall confine\r\nmy comments here to the results of the summit.\r\nNew Zealand is pleased with the Summit\r\nOutcome as it relates to development. It represents a\r\nshared commitment by all Member States to the\r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) and\r\nrecognizes the important partnership between\r\ndeveloped and developing countries in the effective use\r\nof aid.\r\nThis year New Zealand has increased its\r\ndevelopment assistance by 23 per cent. Our official\r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) programme has a focus\r\non poverty elimination, with a core, but not exclusive,\r\nfocus on the Pacific. We strive to address aid\r\neffectiveness, the particular problems faced by small\r\nisland developing States, HIV/AIDS, the empowerment\r\nof women, sexual and reproductive health and rights,\r\neducation for all, sustainable development and trade\r\naccess.\r\nOn trade, we look forward to an ambitious\r\noutcome across all aspects of the Doha Development\r\nAgenda, including in agriculture, improved market\r\naccess, the elimination of export subsidies and\r\nsubstantial reductions in trade distorting domestic\r\nsupport. Improving the coherence of trade policies and\r\ndevelopment initiatives remains a critical element in\r\nachieving the MDGs.\r\nNew Zealand welcomes the decision to establish\r\na Peacebuilding Commission to help break the cycle of\r\nconflict by better coordinating long-term international\r\nrecovery efforts and ensuring sustained political\r\nattention to those who need it. We must now move\r\nswiftly to get the Commission up and running by\r\nDecember this year. We look to the General Assembly\r\nPresident to take a lead in holding consultations to\r\nachieve this. The core elements of the framework have\r\nalready been discussed at length and in detail. With\r\ngood will and determination, we can surely arrive at\r\nagreement within the next few weeks on a package.\r\nThis should ensure balanced membership and flexible\r\nreporting arrangements. We would caution against\r\nraising the bar for assistance too high, and we hope\r\nthat all States in need of help will be able to approach\r\nthe Commission.\r\nOur leaders have spoken with one voice and\r\nunequivocally to condemn all forms of terrorism. We\r\nmust build on this and honour our undertaking to\r\nconclude negotiations on the comprehensive\r\nconvention on international terrorism at this session.\r\nNew Zealand will continue to work closely with our\r\nfriends in the Pacific region to improve our collective\r\nabilities to identify, prevent or respond to terrorist\r\nthreats. Consolidating reporting requirements created\r\nby Security Council resolutions would, we believe, be\r\none step towards enhancing the counter-terrorism\r\nprogramme of the United Nations. We think it very\r\nimportant that Member States should now support the\r\nSecretary-General’s counter-terrorism strategy.\r\nOne of the most far-reaching achievements of the\r\nsummit, as many countries have acknowledged, is our\r\ncollective acceptance that there is a responsibility to\r\nprotect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic\r\ncleansing and crimes against humanity. We must now\r\nall be prepared to assist the United Nations in\r\nestablishing the early warning capability referred to in\r\nour outcome document. It is vital that, when the need\r\narises, we give effect to our resolve and follow the\r\nprinciples we have agreed upon.\r\nIn this context, New Zealand wishes to reaffirm\r\nits commitment to ending impunity for those\r\nresponsible for the most serious crimes of concern to\r\nthe international community. Adoption of the Rome\r\nStatute of the International Criminal Court was an\r\nhistoric moment for the United Nations and one that\r\ndemonstrated the breadth and depth of political will to\r\nend impunity and to secure the rule of law.\r\n20\r\nA/60/PV.23\r\nThe absence of any reference to a commitment to\r\nend impunity or of any acknowledgement of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court’s central contribution to\r\nthis goal is one of several telling silences in our\r\nsummit outcome.\r\nWe are particularly pleased that leaders have\r\nrecognized the need to conclude, during this session,\r\nnegotiations on the draft protocol to the Convention on\r\nthe Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel.\r\nThis will be a major priority for New Zealand. We call\r\non all Member States to contribute constructively to\r\nthis process, so that we can reach agreement on a\r\nprotocol and demonstrate our full support for the work\r\nof United Nations personnel in the field.\r\nNew Zealand welcomes the emphasis on human\r\nrights in the outcome document. That the budget of the\r\nOffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights is\r\nto be doubled and her Office strengthened is an\r\noverdue recognition of the gap between expectations of\r\ndelivery and resourcing.\r\nWhile progress has been made through the\r\nsummit decision to establish a Human Rights Council,\r\nwe regret that the opportunity was lost to reach\r\nagreement on details of the Council’s mandate and\r\noperation, despite the support of a great majority of\r\nMembers for such a package. A small minority cannot\r\nbe allowed to veto the establishment of the Council.\r\nOver the next weeks we must redouble our efforts\r\nto translate that broad support into specifics on what\r\nthe Council will look like and on its mandate. We shall\r\nlook to the President to set a work programme that will\r\naim for agreement on the details.\r\nOur second human rights priority for the sixtieth\r\nsession is to see negotiations completed on the draft\r\nconvention on the rights of persons with disabilities.\r\nThe constructive and collegial spirit of delegations in\r\nthe Ad Hoc Committee on the rights of persons with\r\ndisabilities has been extraordinary. New Zealand is\r\nconfident that it will be possible to conclude the\r\nnegotiations in 2006 if the Ad Hoc Committee is\r\nenabled to meet for three weeks next January.\r\nOur ability to strengthen the United Nations\r\nacross the board in development, security and human\r\nrights will be enhanced by implementing summit\r\nundertakings on Secretariat and management reform.\r\nWe need particularly to improve the managerial\r\neffectiveness and accountability of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. He should be given, as he has requested, the\r\ntools that he needs to manage the Secretariat.\r\nWe strongly support the review of all budgetary\r\nand human resource rules and regulations and the\r\nreview of mandates. We support also the increased\r\nfocus on ensuring ethical conduct on the part of all\r\nUnited Nations personnel. We believe a system-wide\r\ncode of ethics and an independent ethics office would\r\nfacilitate that. New Zealand also welcomes the\r\ncommitment to strengthening the United Nations\r\nOffice of Internal Oversight Services.\r\nThe outcome document calls for early reform of\r\nthe Security Council, and the General Assembly is to\r\nreview progress on this issue by the end of the year.\r\nNew Zealand continues to believe that the Security\r\nCouncil needs to be more effective and more\r\nrepresentative for the twenty-first century, although we\r\nhave no illusions about the difficulties of reaching\r\nagreement on this.\r\nWe should in the meantime renew our efforts to\r\nimprove the working methods of the Security Council.\r\nFor those many Member States who rarely, if ever,\r\noccupy a non-permanent seat on the Council, there\r\nshould be other ways to participate in Council\r\ndecisions and contribute to discussions.\r\nWe, as Member States, have shown in finalizing\r\nthe summit outcome a mixture of courage and\r\ncreativity on the one hand and of stubbornness and\r\nhesitation on the other. The implementation period\r\nahead gives us a second chance to make good on those\r\nmoments when we allowed agreements to slip through\r\nour fingers. We put our trust in our President to set up\r\nthe structures for ongoing work and to be the catalyst\r\nto motivate and energize us.\r\nIn closing, I would like to acknowledge the much\r\nvalued contribution that former President Ping made\r\nover the last year, and we thank him.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency The Honourable Lorin Robert,\r\nDeputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Federated\r\nStates of Micronesia.\r\nMr. Robert (Federated States of Micronesia): I\r\ntake this opportunity to congratulate President Eliasson\r\non his election to lead our deliberations during this\r\nvery important session of the General Assembly. I\r\nwould also like to pay tribute to our outgoing President\r\nof the fifty-ninth session, His Excellency Mr. Jean\r\n21\r\nA/60/PV.23\r\nPing, and our Secretary-General for their tireless\r\nefforts and very considerable contributions to the\r\nsuccessful outcome of the High-level Plenary Meeting\r\nthat concluded just a week ago.\r\nThis year, at this historic session, we\r\ncommemorate a milestone in the rich history of the\r\nOrganization as we celebrate its sixtieth anniversary.\r\nFor us in Micronesia, the occasion also marks the\r\nfifteenth anniversary of our joining the United Nations.\r\nWe are proud and motivated to be part of this great\r\nOrganization.\r\nOur celebrations, however, should have a noble\r\npurpose beyond honouring the past and the present.\r\nThis occasion should give focus to the long road ahead\r\nof us. Inspired by the accomplishments of the past 60\r\nyears, we must forge ahead with strong determination,\r\nconfidence and vigour to meet the challenges that the\r\nfuture holds for the Organization.\r\nThe Federated States of Micronesia does not\r\npretend to believe that the problems that we are called\r\nupon to tackle are easy; they are not. But while we\r\nhave differences of opinion as to how they may be\r\neffectively addressed, my delegation is encouraged by\r\nthe broad consensus that was reached during the high-\r\nlevel panel meetings last week that the reform of the\r\nUnited Nations and the attainment of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) must be addressed one\r\nway or another and sooner rather than later. No doubt\r\nthe consensus was forged in the conviction that the\r\nUnited Nations, with all its shortcomings, still\r\nrepresents the best hope for humankind to solve its\r\nproblems at the multilateral level. If that is the case, as\r\nmy country firmly believes it is, the Organization must\r\nbe reformed to reflect present day realities and to\r\neffectively and efficiently achieve its enduring\r\nobjectives as enshrined in the Charter. For the sake of\r\nour Organization’s credibility, for its long-term\r\nsustainability, and for the millions of people around the\r\nglobe that pin their hopes on the United Nations, the\r\nOrganization must be reformed. My delegation fully\r\nsupports the call that has been made within the General\r\nAssembly Hall for its comprehensive reform.\r\nConsequently, let us give full consideration to the\r\nreform of the Security Council. The challenges of the\r\ntwenty-first century demand that we should do so. With\r\nthe indulgence of members, I do not wish to go into\r\ndetails here, as the position of my Government on the\r\nissue has already been made known on several\r\noccasions. I would only reiterate our call for the\r\ninclusion of Japan and Germany, among the developed\r\ncountries, as permanent members of the Council,\r\nbecause we believe they will contribute greatly to the\r\nmaintenance of peace and security. For those\r\naforementioned reasons, we also support the inclusion\r\nof India, a developing country, as a permanent member\r\nof the Security Council. Moreover, we will support the\r\ninclusion of other developing countries from other\r\nregions, if that reflects the choice of those regions. We\r\nurge Member States to take bold and decisive action on\r\nthis issue.\r\nThe time has come for the “enemy State” clauses\r\nin the United Nations Charter to be removed. They\r\nhave long become obsolete. The outcome document\r\nrightfully reflects that fact.\r\nThe sixtieth General Assembly could not have\r\nbeen more timely. It can take up the noble but\r\nincomplete task of reinforcing and facilitating the full\r\nimplementation of the outcome of last week’s summit.\r\nWe have little choice but to complete that which was\r\nleft unfinished.\r\nConsistent with the broader agenda of the\r\ndebates, we wish to reiterate the great importance that\r\nwe attach to the second phase of the World Summit on\r\nthe Information Society (WSIS) to be held in Tunisia in\r\nNovember. For my country, whose population is\r\ndispersed on many islands scattered over a vast area of\r\nthe Pacific, access to affordable and reliable\r\ninformation and communication technologies (ICTs) is\r\ncritical to the socio-economic advancement of its\r\npeople. But harnessing the power of ICTs does not\r\nbenefit only a few. In the end, it is a win-win\r\nproposition for us all — for developing and developed\r\ncountries alike. The responsible use and effective\r\ndissemination of meaningful information is the key to\r\nemancipation from human ignorance and is therefore\r\nessential to socio-economic progress. It follows that\r\nthe means of collecting, evaluating, and transmitting\r\ninformation must be shared and placed at the service of\r\nhumankind. It is for that reason that my country\r\ncontinues to add its voice to those of other countries in\r\nurging universal cooperation in the WSIS process. It is\r\na step forward along the road to achieving the MDGs.\r\nWithout it, the MDGs will mean little.\r\nIt is for the same reason that my Government\r\nsupports the Community of Democracies and\r\nparticipates in its activities. In our view,\r\n22\r\nA/60/PV.23\r\ndemocratization of the institutions of governance and\r\ntransparency in public policymaking — with due\r\nregard to local conditions — are inseparable from\r\neconomic progress and collective security. After all,\r\nthe work of the Community does not contradict but\r\nfurther reinforces the MDGs and, in a larger sense, the\r\ntime-honoured objectives incorporated in the Charter\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nIt does not take a great deal of wisdom to realize\r\nthat, as a small island developing State, my country is\r\nvulnerable to the extremely adverse impact of global\r\nclimate change. For the 15 years we have been a\r\nMember of the United Nations, we have been vocal\r\nhere and elsewhere on the issue of climate change and\r\nits adverse impact on small island developing States.\r\nFor us, it is an issue of security and survival. I reiterate\r\nour appeal to those countries that have not yet ratified\r\nthe Kyoto Protocol to do so immediately and without\r\nfurther delay.\r\nA week ago during the High-level Plenary\r\nMeeting, President Joseph Urusemal, like other\r\nMicronesian Presidents before him, called attention to\r\nthe daunting challenges facing our country and other\r\nsmall island developing States in pursuing sustainable\r\ndevelopment and achieving the MDGs. I reaffirm their\r\ncalls here once again, and stress the urgent need for the\r\ninternational community to fully and effectively\r\nimplement the Mauritius Strategy for the further\r\nImplementation of the Programme of Action for the\r\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates. The Strategy provides a way forward for these\r\ncountries and plays a crucial role in our ability to\r\nachieve sustainable development and meet the MDGs.\r\nAs if the plethora of challenges I have spoken of\r\nare not daunting enough for my country, the escalating\r\ncost of fuel and its negative impact on our efforts to\r\nmeet development goals and pursue sustainable\r\ndevelopment is a major cause of concern. That crisis\r\nbrings to the fore the need identified by small island\r\ndeveloping States for accelerated research and\r\ndevelopment and a sharing of technologies in the areas\r\nof renewable and alternative sources of energy. We\r\nappeal to the international community to assist us in\r\nthose areas.\r\nI take this opportunity today to reiterate the call\r\nmade by my President during the High-level Plenary\r\nMeeting to further strengthen cooperation and linkages\r\nbetween the United Nations and countries of the\r\nPacific, like mine. The need for the physical presence\r\nof the United Nations system and its sustained\r\nengagement in our development process is now more\r\ncompelling than ever. We cannot accept the notion that\r\nour country is undeserving of the substantive presence\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nOver the past few months we have seen\r\nencouraging signs in the Middle East. The historic\r\ndisengagement of Israel from the Gaza Strip and parts\r\nof the West Bank is a step in the right direction and\r\nshould be commended. My Government appreciates the\r\npolitical obstacles faced by the two parties and\r\nencourages them to stay the course towards a peaceful\r\nsettlement of what has been a long, complex and\r\nunpleasant experience. We call upon both parties to\r\nspare no effort to actively pursue peaceful negotiations.\r\nThey should not be satisfied until the day comes when\r\nIsraeli and Palestinian children can play side by side\r\nand live in peace, without fear.\r\nAs a young country that graduated from the\r\ntrusteeship regime of this Organization, my country\r\nplaces high hopes in the United Nations. At 60, the\r\nUnited Nations should not to be contemplating\r\nretirement. Instead, the time has come for this great\r\nOrganization to strengthen and rededicate itself in\r\norder to effectively and efficiently meet the challenges\r\nof the new millennium.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Phesheya\r\nMbongeni Dlamini, chairman of the delegation of the\r\nKingdom of Swaziland.\r\nMr. Dlamini (Swaziland): It is an honour and\r\nprivilege for me to present my country’s statement, as\r\ncommanded by His Majesty King Mswati III.\r\nI am happy to convey the greetings and best\r\nwishes of His Majesty King Mswati III, Her Majesty\r\nthe Queen Mother, and the entire Swazi nation.\r\nOn behalf of my delegation, I wish to\r\ncongratulate Mr. Eliasson on his election as President\r\nof the General Assembly at its sixtieth session. The\r\nKingdom of Swaziland is confident that his diplomatic\r\nskills and vast experience in international affairs will\r\nguide the work of the General Assembly to a\r\nsuccessful conclusion as it faces the daunting task of\r\nreform and change.\r\nWe wish also to recognize the work done by his\r\npredecessor, Mr. Jean Ping, Minister of Foreign Affairs\r\n23\r\nA/60/PV.23\r\nof Gabon, who ably steered the last session so as to set\r\nthe stage for change in the year 2005. He hands over\r\nthe leadership of this body at a crucial time — a time\r\nwhen we have to take concrete and firm action to effect\r\nsuch change. We wish him well and every success in\r\nhis future endeavours.\r\nThis is a momentous occasion, as we are\r\ncelebrating the sixtieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations at a time when we are charting a course and\r\nadopting clear guidelines for adapting the Organization\r\nto the effective role it must play in the new century. We\r\nhave also taken on the responsibility and challenge of\r\nensuring that the United Nations of the twenty-first\r\ncentury can make real improvements in the lives of the\r\npeoples of the world.\r\nGiven the contributions of the United Nations to\r\nworld peace, economic and social development and the\r\nobservance of human rights, we are reaffirming our\r\nfaith in the Organization, and we will continue to work\r\nto achieve the objectives of the Charter through the\r\nstrengthening and revitalization of the United Nations\r\nsystem.\r\nIn the last five years, the international community\r\nhas witnessed a mixed bag of successes, trials and\r\ntribulations whose consequences have been felt across\r\nthe globe. The scale of some of these man-made\r\nproblems and natural disasters — such as terrorism,\r\nwar, the tsunami and Hurricane Katrina — was\r\nunprecedented.\r\nIt is because of some of these incidents that, for\r\nthe first time in its existence, the United Nations has\r\nbeen challenged in its pivotal role of maintaining\r\nglobal peace, security and safety. Fortunately, the\r\nUnited Nations has remained undeterred, and that is\r\ndue in particular to the astute leadership of our\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, whose diplomatic\r\nskills and efforts to unite — tested as they have\r\nbeen — have managed to keep the Organization\r\nfocused as it deals with the critical issues confronting\r\nthe international community today.\r\nFor those reasons, the Kingdom of Swaziland\r\nbelieves that this session presents an opportunity for us\r\nto advance further the reform process in order not only\r\nto make the Organization efficient and effective, but\r\nalso to ensure that the programmes of action adopted at\r\npast global conferences are fully implemented.\r\nWe therefore welcome the decisions taken at the\r\nrecently concluded Millennium Development Goals\r\n(MDGs) review summit. These will indeed set us on\r\ncourse to have a significant impact on each and every\r\ncountry’s socio-political and economic development.\r\nOur quest for a safer and secure world continues\r\nto be challenged. The recent spate of terrorist\r\nbombings in various parts of the world is a clear\r\nindication that we have to fight that growing scourge\r\nwith urgency. The adoption of the 13 conventions\r\ncovering different aspects of terrorism demonstrates\r\nour unwavering commitment to this course.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland supports the\r\nSecretary-General’s call for the drafting of a\r\ncomprehensive instrument that will enable us to\r\ncollectively and effectively fight terrorism.\r\nTensions and conflicts within and among States,\r\nwhich are detrimental to development and productivity,\r\ncontinue to affect many parts of the world. Such\r\nconflicts are fuelled by the ever-growing illicit trade in\r\nsmall arms and light weapons, which cause the death\r\nand displacement of thousands of innocent people\r\nevery year.\r\nIn that regard, the Kingdom of Swaziland\r\nsupports United Nations efforts to enhance\r\ninternational cooperation to prevent, combat and\r\neradicate the illicit trade in small arms and light\r\nweapons. We further call for stern action to be taken\r\nagainst the mass production of such arms and weapons,\r\nin the same manner as we would deal with drug\r\nproducers.\r\nIn this age of globalization, collective action will\r\nbe necessary given that no single nation can find its\r\nown solutions to the challenges that we face. In that\r\ncontext, we welcome the various initiatives currently\r\nunder way that are aimed at engaging regional\r\norganizations to do their part in responding to\r\nchallenges within their regions.\r\nThese partnerships have been taking shape, and it\r\nis now up to us to give them substance by establishing\r\nappropriate frameworks, harmonizing methods and\r\npooling capacities and resources for our work.\r\nWe in Africa consider cooperation between the\r\nAfrican Union and the United Nations as being of great\r\nvalue. For example, peacekeeping and peacebuilding\r\nmissions continue to enhance peace initiatives in our\r\nregion. However, I would like to stress here that\r\n24\r\nA/60/PV.23\r\npeacekeeping operations must go hand in hand with\r\nhumanitarian efforts, with all of the urgency such\r\nsituations require.\r\nAfrican leaders have demonstrated their political\r\nwill, but they lack the resources to resolve crises in\r\nAfrica. It is for that reason that we appeal to the\r\ninternational community to increase its support for the\r\nAfrican Union, so as to enhance its capacity and\r\nresponse mechanism.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland supports the call for\r\nan integrated approach to conflict resolution on our\r\ncontinent, and we also support the idea that the African\r\nUnion is the organ best suited to mobilizing the efforts\r\nof its members, and, most important of all, to\r\nundertaking preventive action before a situation\r\ndeteriorates.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland remains concerned,\r\nhowever, by the conflict in the Middle East, which\r\ncontinues to threaten international peace and security.\r\nWe believe that the road map holds the key to a\r\npositive outcome on the matter and urge the Quartet to\r\ncontinue its efforts to bridge the differences between\r\nthe parties.\r\nWhile welcoming the positive efforts by the\r\nGovernment of Israel to withdraw from some parts of\r\nthe occupied territories, we would urge both parties to\r\nmake a commitment to a comprehensive cessation of\r\nall violence, particularly that aimed at civilians, or else\r\nreal progress will remain elusive. We remain hopeful\r\nthat a solution to the conflict is imminent and continue\r\nto urge both parties to remain pragmatic and\r\nconstructive in their quest for a solution.\r\nThe recent MDG follow-up summit succeeded in\r\nhighlighting the plight of Africa with unprecedented\r\nclarity. The paradox of Africa is the extreme and\r\nincreasing poverty of its people, who face many\r\nproblems, including ill health, in a land so richly\r\nendowed with natural resources. This has become\r\nincreasingly visible over the past decade, while we\r\nhave seen evidence of a decline in poverty in other\r\nparts of the world.\r\nIn much of Africa, one of the major causes and\r\nconsequences of poverty is disease, mainly malaria and\r\nHIV/AIDS. These diseases continue to compromise the\r\nhealth situation in African countries, halting and even\r\nreversing health gains achieved in earlier years. The\r\npoor are caught in a complex poverty trap in which low\r\nincome leads to low consumption, which in turn results\r\nin low capacity and low productivity.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland believes that there\r\nare relatively affordable technologies in our modern\r\nworld that can mitigate the effect of disease on the\r\npoor. Experience has shown that proven strategies and\r\nhealth interventions can effectively and dramatically\r\nreduce the toll of these killer diseases. Fortunately, the\r\nMDGs point the way forward.\r\nWe believe that the creation of a world solidarity\r\nfund to eradicate extreme poverty and an accord within\r\nthe framework of the World Trade Organization on\r\npatents are imperative and would be steps in the right\r\ndirection, so that our countries can provide medicines\r\nto all.\r\nHealth is a strong entry point for poverty\r\nreduction, and alleviating the disease burden on the\r\npoor will contribute to the improvement of their social\r\nstatus.\r\nThis year also marks another milestone in the\r\ncalendar of the movement for gender equality and the\r\nadvancement of women: the 10-year review of the\r\nBeijing Declaration and Platform for Action. In 1995\r\nwomen gathered in Beijing and took a giant step\r\nforward. At that point, gender equality came to be\r\nrecognized as a critical element of development and\r\npeace for each and every country. Some progress has\r\nbeen made. For example, many more girls are now\r\nenrolled in primary education. Investing in women is\r\nparamount for ensuring sustainable development.\r\nDuring this session, we must strive to meet the\r\nchallenge that the Charter, established 60 years ago,\r\narticulated: the equal rights of men and women.\r\nAs we note this progress, we acknowledge the\r\nnewer challenges that have emerged, such as the effects\r\nof the HIV/AIDS pandemic on both women and girls.\r\nThe HIV/AIDS scourge continues to plague our\r\ncommunities in Africa. The pandemic is as much a\r\nmedical crisis as it is an economic, social and political\r\ncrisis. With no cure insight, it will continue to deplete\r\nthe essential financial and human resources so critical\r\nfor development. For its part, my Government has been\r\ncollaborating with local communities to find home-\r\ngrown solutions to this problem. We continue to be\r\ngrateful to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,\r\nTuberculosis and Malaria and other international\r\nagencies for the assistance and support they continue to\r\nprovide us in our fight against this killer disease.\r\n25\r\nA/60/PV.23\r\nThere is no doubt that developing countries are\r\ndetermined to fight poverty by creating jobs for our\r\npeople. As we play our part in the mobilization of\r\ndomestic resources, I would like to appeal to the\r\ndeveloped world to meet its commitments by\r\nsupporting us. Effective assistance by the international\r\ncommunity to enhance the quality of economic choices\r\nis necessary, as is firm commitment without\r\nconditionalities.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland believes that the\r\nDoha Development Agenda needs to be seriously\r\nadvanced, with industrialized countries addressing the\r\nneeds of developing countries. We call for better access\r\nto markets, in particular preferential markets with\r\nlowered tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade with\r\nindustrialized countries.\r\nOn the question of reform of the United Nations,\r\nthe Kingdom of Swaziland supports the wide range of\r\nproposals put forward to revitalize our Organization in\r\nits management of our affairs. We are of the view that\r\nthe role of the General Assembly must be significantly\r\nstrengthened to enable it to fulfil the tasks originally\r\nassigned to it by the Charter. The General Assembly, as\r\nthe most democratic and representative body of the\r\nUnited Nations, should seize this opportunity to take\r\nthe lead and thus demonstrate that it can express the\r\npolitical will of the people of the world.\r\nIn this regard, the Economic and Social Council\r\ntoo should be strengthened and given decision-making\r\npowers to implement the United Nations development\r\nagenda. We also believe that the Council should\r\ncontinue to be the overall coordinator of all\r\ndevelopment activities, including the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nAs we discuss greater representation and wider\r\nparticipation in the United Nations system, and as we\r\ncelebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the Organization,\r\nallow me to remind all of us gathered here that the\r\nmore than 23 million people of the Republic of China\r\nremain hopeful that their voice in quest of participation\r\nin the very important United Nations system will soon\r\nbe heard and positively responded to, so that they too\r\ncan make their valuable contributions to the\r\nmanagement and prosperity of world affairs. In the\r\nmeantime, it is our continued hope that the existing\r\nissues between the parties will be resolved peacefully.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Alisher Vohidov,\r\nChairman of the delegation of the Republic of\r\nUzbekistan.\r\nMr. Vohidov (Uzbekistan) (spoke in Russian):\r\nFirst of all, let me take this opportunity to congratulate\r\nMr. Jan Eliasson on his election to the high position of\r\nPresident of the General Assembly and to wish him\r\nevery success in guiding the work of the session. I\r\nwould also like to thank his predecessor, Mr. Jean Ping,\r\nfor his able leadership as the President of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-ninth session.\r\nIt is obvious that the years-long process of\r\nreorganizing the entire system of international\r\nrelations, in particular reform of the United Nations,\r\nhas been unreasonably delayed. The 2005 summit was\r\nan important stage in exploring mutually acceptable\r\nformulas and in adopting goals whose implementation\r\nwill lead us to the achievement of development and\r\nsecurity.\r\nSome of the decisions taken at the summit were\r\nmedium-term and others long-term in nature. But, in\r\nour view, our primary task is to ensure their full\r\nimplementation and not to allow inertia to impede this,\r\nas has been the case in the process of implementing the\r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nStrengthening the capacity of the United Nations\r\nto achieve its goals in the three areas of development,\r\nsecurity and human rights requires appropriate and\r\nactive adaptation of the entire United Nations system.\r\nIn this connection we consider it important to make the\r\nfollowing comments. First, regardless of how\r\nimportant it is to reform and modernize the United\r\nNations, there is, at present, no alternative to the\r\nOrganization.\r\nSecondly, further delay in reform of the most\r\nimportant bodies of the Organization will negatively\r\nimpact its role in the modern world. There is a real\r\ndanger that if the United Nations fails to take action, its\r\ncoordinating role will gradually pass to other\r\ninternational structures, which lack the degree of broad\r\nrepresentation that the United Nations enjoys.\r\nThirdly, the reform of three main bodies of the\r\nUnited Nations — the General Assembly, the Security\r\nCouncil and the Economic and Social Council —\r\nshould provide balance in their work. In that regard, we\r\nconsider it to be in our common interest that Security\r\nCouncil reform not be prolonged. It should be carried\r\n26\r\nA/60/PV.23\r\nout during the main part of the sixtieth session, before\r\nthe year is out.\r\nFourthly, regional approaches should be given\r\npriority in dealing with development, security and\r\nhuman rights issues. The effectiveness of the principle\r\nof moving from regional to global approaches has\r\nalready been proved on many occasions.\r\nAt present, Uzbekistan is implementing its\r\nnational goals for economic development. It is carrying\r\nout economic reforms and taking measures to\r\nstrengthen regional economic cooperation. However,\r\nany national efforts need to be supported by\r\ninternational economic structures. It is important that\r\ngenuine conditions for an equal and fair international\r\neconomic order be established. International donors\r\nmust provide their full support for regional\r\ncooperation, and interested developing countries, in\r\nturn, need to make that kind of cooperation an integral\r\npart of their national strategy.\r\nWe believe it important for the concerned\r\nregional commissions of the United Nations — the\r\nEconomic Commission for Europe and the Economic\r\nand Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific — to\r\nstrengthen their work to assist economic development\r\nin Central Asia, with a view to the greater and broader\r\ninvolvement of the countries of the region in\r\ninternational economic relations and investment\r\ncooperation. We are of the view that the international\r\ncommunity, including the United Nations, should pay\r\nserious attention to the question of creating a Central\r\nAsian common market capable of ensuring the rational\r\nand effective use of the rich potential and resources of\r\nthe region.\r\nUzbekistan supports all efforts to ensure\r\nsustainable development. Member States should pool\r\ntheir efforts to tackle problems of environmental\r\ndegradation, shortages of water resources and drinking\r\nwater and the deterioration of environmental\r\nconditions in cities and industrial zones. The global\r\nenvironmental agenda also calls for the pressing issues\r\nof desertification, biodiversity and climate change to\r\nbe addressed.\r\nActs of terrorism carried out in many regions of\r\nthe world, including Central Asia, have once again\r\nreminded us of the need for a critical assessment of the\r\npractice of international cooperation, including within\r\nthe United Nations, to counter that plague of the\r\ntwenty-first century, which threatens rich and poor\r\nStates alike. It is unacceptable to further delay taking\r\nmeasures against those international centres of\r\nterrorism and extremism that — under the guise of\r\nespousing universal human values — in fact develop\r\nand disseminate ideologies of fanaticism. In that\r\nconnection, we welcome the Security Council’s most\r\nrecent counter-terrorism resolution — resolution 1624\r\n(2005) of 14 September 2005 — on the suppression of\r\nincitement to terrorist acts. At the same time, we\r\nbelieve it is crucial not to allow double standards in the\r\nimplementation of that instrument. Those\r\nconsiderations should also be concerns in the process\r\nof drafting a universal convention on international\r\nterrorism.\r\nA powerful accomplice of international terrorism\r\nis drug trafficking. Unfortunately, no actual progress\r\nhas been seen in reducing drug production in\r\nAfghanistan. On that issue, we need to move urgently\r\nfrom words to action. In that connection, we are\r\ncounting on the international community’s firm support\r\nfor Uzbekistan’s initiative to establish a Central Asian\r\nregional information and coordination centre to counter\r\ntransboundary crimes related to drug trafficking.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nTogether with the pressing problems of\r\ndevelopment and security there is the issue of human\r\nrights. That issue is central to forging a new path in\r\ninternational relations, and to United Nations reform,\r\nin particular. In his report, “In larger freedom”\r\n(A/59/2005), the Secretary-General notes that\r\ninternational treaties adopted over the past six decades\r\nform an impressive normative basis for ensuring full\r\ninternational acknowledgement and respect for human\r\nrights and freedoms. There is no doubt that protection\r\nof human rights needs to be one of the core tasks for\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nUzbekistan is a party to all the major\r\ninternational human rights instruments and it is\r\nsteadily moving towards democracy and the formation\r\nof a civil society. One important step in that direction\r\nwas the decision to abolish the death penalty in the\r\ncountry, as proposed by Uzbekistan’s President Islam\r\nKarimov.\r\nWe are convinced that reform of the United\r\nNations human rights system needs to be carried out\r\nstep by step, consistently, and taking into account the\r\nconcerns of all interested parties. Along with political\r\nrights, it is necessary to strengthen other human rights,\r\n27\r\nA/60/PV.23\r\nincluding socio-economic and environmental rights.\r\nWe reiterate our position that it is unacceptable to\r\npoliticize the issue of human rights or to be selective in\r\nreviewing human rights situations, even more so when\r\nUnited Nations bodies or mechanisms are involved.\r\nThe establishment of a stable and long-lasting\r\npeace in Afghanistan is of strategic value for\r\nUzbekistan. In that context, we welcome the\r\nparliamentary elections that were held in Afghanistan\r\non 18 September. That event has become another\r\nimportant step towards restoring statehood to\r\nAfghanistan. Uzbekistan supports the efforts aimed at\r\nthe prompt stabilization of the situation in Afghanistan.\r\nConsidering Afghanistan to be a part of the Central\r\nAsian region, we encourage its active participation in\r\nregional integration processes. Uzbekistan is providing\r\nbroad support to the Afghan people, as well as to\r\nrelevant mechanisms of the United Nations and other\r\ninternational organizations, to aid the reconstruction\r\nprocess in that country.\r\nFive years after the Millennium Summit, Member\r\nStates have adopted an historic decision to launch\r\nreform and renovate the mechanisms of the United\r\nNations. We have a unique opportunity to carry out\r\nmore far-reaching reforms to adapt the Organization to\r\nnew realities. The aim of those reforms is to ensure the\r\nwell-being and prosperity of all our peoples. Today the\r\ntime has come to make decisions and take action. Any\r\nprotraction of the process could seriously paralyse the\r\nsystem of international relations, allow current threats\r\nand challenges to become irreversible, and lead to a\r\nsituation in which the international community is\r\nunable to take timely and appropriate measures.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate the\r\nreadiness of Uzbekistan to cooperate actively with\r\nother States in creating more effective and just United\r\nNations.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Vsevolod Grigore, Permanent Representative of\r\nthe Republic of Moldova.\r\nMr. Grigore (Republic of Moldova): At the\r\noutset, I should like to congratulate you, Sir, on your\r\nelection as President of the sixtieth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. My delegation is confident that\r\nyour knowledge and vast professional experience will\r\nensure strong and competent leadership of the\r\nAssembly.\r\nLet me also pay well-deserved tribute to your\r\npredecessor, Mr. Jean Ping, whose tireless efforts\r\nguided Member States through the difficult\r\nnegotiations that resulted in the adoption of the\r\noutcome document of the High-level Plenary Meeting.\r\nA few days ago, speaking from this rostrum,\r\nPresident Vladimir Voronin of the Republic of\r\nMoldova reaffirmed my country’s unwavering support\r\nfor the United Nations and its commitment to work\r\ntogether with other Member States to renew and\r\nstrengthen the United Nations system. We need an\r\neffective United Nations, a richly diverse organization\r\nthat is united in its resolve and able to address the\r\nchallenges and threats confronting the contemporary\r\nworld.\r\nThe 2005 World Summit Outcome provides a fair\r\nassessment of the threats and challenges facing us in\r\nthe areas of peace, security, development and human\r\nrights and rightly emphasizes their interconnected\r\nnature. World leaders agreed on a number of concrete\r\nactions and steps that need to be undertaken in all those\r\nareas. Those measures might not meet everyone’s\r\nexpectations, but they reflect a degree of consensus\r\nthat is both challenging and inspiring.\r\nSince one of the world summit’s aims was to\r\nassess implementation of the Millennium Declaration,\r\nit is heartening to see the strong and unambiguous\r\ncommitment of donor and developing countries to\r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015.\r\nThe measures outlined in the areas of financing\r\nfor development, debt cancellation, trade promotion,\r\ninvestment and other specific areas of development\r\nneed to be fully implemented. Developed and\r\ndeveloping countries must build their declared global\r\npartnership for development on the basis of mutual\r\ntrust and respect, while the effectiveness and quality of\r\naid can be ensured through a balance of appropriate\r\nfinancing, good governance and sound policies.\r\nIn the area of peace and security, the Republic of\r\nMoldova welcomes the unequivocal condemnation of\r\nterrorism and supports the call to conclude and agree\r\non, during the current session of the General Assembly,\r\na comprehensive convention on international terrorism\r\ncontaining a legal definition of terrorism. During the\r\n2005 summit, the Republic of Moldova signed the\r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of Acts\r\nof Nuclear Terrorism, which is further proof of our\r\nongoing commitment to multilateral efforts aimed at\r\n28\r\nA/60/PV.23\r\nstrengthening the United Nations counter-terrorism\r\nlegal framework.\r\nMy country welcomes the decision to create a\r\nPeacebuilding Commission, which it considers to be\r\none of the main achievements of the summit. As\r\nenvisioned, that body has the potential to bring much-\r\nneeded coherence to our strategies for post-conflict\r\npeacebuilding and recovery, provided that we succeed\r\nin making it operational by the end of this year.\r\nUnfortunately, the outcome document pays far\r\nless attention to conflict prevention and conflict\r\nresolution, especially with regard to internal conflicts.\r\nMany regional organizations have been entrusted,\r\nunder the provisions of Chapter VIII of the Charter,\r\nwith dealing with a number of conflicts that are at the\r\ncentre of the Security Council’s attention. But, as the\r\nreport of the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges\r\nand Change (A/59/565) rightly pointed out, the efforts\r\nof regional organizations do not absolve the United\r\nNations of its primary responsibilities for peace and\r\nsecurity. The United Nations needs to reach out more\r\nsystematically to those regional organizations, and\r\nsteps should be taken to increase their accountability,\r\nparticularly in the case of protracted or frozen\r\nconflicts, where a situation does not improve or even\r\nworsens over the years.\r\nWe would also like to recall the High-level\r\nPanel’s proposals aimed at enhancing the capabilities\r\nand the role of the United Nations in conflict\r\nmediation, which were set aside in the discussions.\r\nOne of those proposals was to give the Department of\r\nPolitical Affairs additional resources and to restructure\r\nit in order to provide more consistent and professional\r\nmediation support. No conflict in the world should be\r\nleft without the attention of the United Nations,\r\nregardless of whether it is on the Security Council’s\r\nagenda or not.\r\nLike many Member States, we regret the failure\r\nto reach agreement on a section on non-proliferation\r\nand disarmament in the summit outcome document.\r\nBut that must not preclude further common efforts to\r\nbuild consensus around the global nuclear non-\r\nproliferation regime and the pursuit of nuclear\r\ndisarmament.\r\nWe appreciate the outcome document’s support\r\nfor the implementation of the Programme of Action to\r\nPrevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in\r\nSmall Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. But\r\nto make a real difference, Member States should\r\nexpedite and conclude negotiations on legally binding\r\nagreements on the marking and tracing of small arms\r\nand light weapons, as well as their brokering and\r\ntransfer.\r\nThe Republic of Moldova fully endorses the\r\ncommitment to create a Human Rights Council. We\r\nlook forward to speedy and productive negotiations on\r\nthe Council’s mandate, size, membership and working\r\nprocedures. We have high expectations of that standing\r\nbody’s ability to protect and even enforce respect for\r\nfundamental human rights, especially in cases of\r\nhumanitarian crimes and violations in conflict zones\r\noutside the control of sovereign States. My country\r\nalso supports the decision to strengthen the Office of\r\nthe High Commissioner for Human Rights and its field\r\noffices.\r\nAs a country that has placed the concepts of\r\ndemocracy and rule of law at its core since gaining\r\nindependence, the Republic of Moldova welcomes the\r\nreaffirmation of democracy as a universal value in the\r\noutcome document and the creation of the new\r\nDemocracy Fund.\r\nThe success of United Nations reform depends on\r\nthe ability of Member States to implement measures\r\nthat revitalize the General Assembly and enhance the\r\neffectiveness of the Economic and Social Council and\r\nthe Secretariat. Although the issue of the enlargement\r\nof the Security Council proved to be highly divisive, an\r\nenormous amount of work has been done to explore\r\ndifferent options. We all agree that the expanded\r\nCouncil should be representative, efficient and\r\ntransparent. We should continue to seek consensus\r\nbased on those principles.\r\nThe triangle of development, peace and freedom\r\nis of direct relevance to the Republic of Moldova. Our\r\nyoung democracy is struggling with the difficulties of\r\ntransition and suffers — as it has for more than 13\r\nyears — from a protracted, unsolved conflict inspired\r\nand supported from abroad. It sees the fundamental\r\nfreedoms of a significant number of its citizens\r\nviolated by an aggressive separatist regime.\r\nAs representatives of my country have stressed in\r\nthe Assembly over the years, settling the internal\r\nconflict in the Transnistrian region of the Republic of\r\nMoldova is our greatest priority. Separatism is not only\r\nthe main threat to our country’s peace and security; it\r\nis also the main obstacle to the further consolidation of\r\n29\r\nA/60/PV.23\r\nthe independence and the statehood of the Republic of\r\nMoldova and a hindrance to its economic development.\r\nThe reintegration of the country, with respect for the\r\nprinciple of territorial integrity and sovereignty, is a\r\nprerequisite for a stable and prosperous Republic of\r\nMoldova able to achieve its internal and external\r\nstrategic objectives.\r\nThe Republic of Moldova has worked faithfully\r\nand constructively towards that end for many years,\r\nlooking for a peaceful, just and lasting solution to\r\npolitical conflict and fostering dialogue with the self-\r\nappointed Transnistrian leaders, with the help of\r\nmediating countries and the Organization for Security\r\nand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Unfortunately, all\r\nefforts have been in vain and have only demonstrated\r\nthe ineffectiveness of the old format. With support and\r\nencouragement from abroad, the separatist leaders have\r\nbeen using the negotiation process to claim legitimacy\r\nfor themselves as the representatives of the will of the\r\ninhabitants of the Transnistrian region of the Republic\r\nof Moldova, and have promoted the idea of a pseudo-\r\nState, for which there are no ethnic, religious or other\r\nplausible grounds. In the meantime, the region has\r\nbecome a centre of illegal and criminal economic\r\nactivity, trafficking, arms production and proliferation\r\nand a threat to the stability and security of that part of\r\nthe European continent. The region’s multinational\r\npopulation lives under constant pressure from the\r\nseparatist regime’s propaganda and under the\r\nsurveillance of its security structures. The people of the\r\nregion are constantly being intimidated and harassed.\r\nThat situation cannot go on indefinitely. There is\r\na growing sense of urgency in Moldovan society,\r\nexpressed in the unprecedented consensus and the\r\nresolve of all political parties with respect to the ways\r\nand means of settling the conflict. Political momentum\r\nis growing, as Ukraine has advanced a new plan for a\r\nsettlement. Following that development, the Parliament\r\nof the Republic of Moldova passed several laws related\r\nto the Ukrainian plan, including the law on\r\nfundamental regulations of the special legal status of\r\nsettlements on the left bank of the Nistru River —\r\nTransnistria — of 22 July, 2005.\r\nThe Republic of Moldova has been calling for a\r\nnumber of concrete actions to create the conditions for\r\na lasting solution to the conflict, including the\r\nfollowing elements.\r\nFirst, our Government has called for the\r\ncomplete, unconditional and transparent withdrawal of\r\nforeign troops and munitions from the territory of\r\nMoldova, in accordance with the relevant decisions of\r\nthe OSCE Istanbul Summit. The foreign military\r\npresence is used as external pressure and provides a\r\npolitical shield for the separatist authorities.\r\nSecondly, it has called for the establishment of\r\ntransparent and effective control over the Transnistrian\r\nsegment of the Moldovan-Ukrainian border. We highly\r\nappreciate the decision of the European Union to assist\r\nin monitoring that border segment, which should help\r\ncurb illegal commercial activities and all trafficking. In\r\nthat context, we support the early signing of the\r\nmemorandum of understanding on the European\r\nCommission Border Assistance Mission to the\r\nRepublic of Moldova and Ukraine, and we express our\r\nsatisfaction at the readiness of the Ukrainian\r\nauthorities to cooperate in that respect.\r\nThirdly, the Government has called for the\r\ndemocratization and demilitarization of the\r\nTransnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova\r\nthrough the development of civil society, political\r\nparties and a free press, as well as through respect for\r\nhuman rights and freedoms, the disarmament and\r\ndismantlement of illegal military units, militias and\r\nsecurity structures. Only after creating a vibrant and\r\npolitically open society — a process that should be\r\ncarried out under the close monitoring of the\r\ninternational community — can one envisage the\r\npossibility of free and democratic elections in\r\nTransnistria to establish genuine, responsible\r\nrepresentatives of the population of the region.\r\nThe Republic of Moldova has been pleading for a\r\nnew negotiating format by connecting the European\r\nUnion and the United States. New inputs, ideas and\r\npractical contributions are needed to move the process\r\nforward. The same is true of the current peacekeeping\r\nmechanism, which is far from meeting the recognized\r\nstandards of an unbiased attitude and should be\r\nreplaced by an international mechanism of military and\r\ncivil observers under an OSCE mandate.\r\nThe reintegration of the country would give new\r\nimpetus to our efforts for sustained economic\r\ndevelopment. The country’s strong economic\r\nperformance, reflected in its stable and sustained\r\neconomic growth over the past four years, as well as\r\nthe quality of our country’s poverty reduction and\r\n30\r\nA/60/PV.23\r\neconomic growth strategy paper and the Government’s\r\nsteady commitment to fully implementing it,\r\ndemonstrate that the Republic of Moldova is on the\r\nright track to increasing the well-being of our citizens\r\nand improving the country’s socio-economic\r\nindicators, including through achievement of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nThe Republic of Moldova has irreversibly chosen\r\nthe path of European integration as the strategic\r\nobjective of its foreign policy. We are aware of the full\r\nextent of changes, reforms and improvements we have\r\nto achieve internally to meet the rigorous European\r\nstandards for economic development, good\r\ngovernance, democracy, political freedom and human\r\nrights. Our optimism with respect to Moldova’s\r\nsuccessful achievement of its aspirations is rooted in\r\nthe firm will of the entire society to mobilize our\r\nresources to achieve that objective.\r\nSuccessful and complete implementation of the\r\nEU-Moldova Action Plan will give us the opportunity\r\nto rise to a new level of contractual relations with the\r\nEuropean Union, as set out in that document. It will\r\nalso be decisive for achieving further internal reforms\r\nand general progress in the country. The recent first\r\nevaluation of the implementation of the EU-Moldova\r\nAction Plan showed encouraging results and steady\r\nprogress. The Government is committed to the full\r\nimplementation of that comprehensive document,\r\nwhich will open, we hope, a clear European\r\nperspective for our country.\r\nMy country is ready to work tirelessly to make\r\nour Organization stronger, more efficient and able to\r\nfulfil the ambitious goals set by our leaders at the 2005\r\nworld summit. Only through collective action carried\r\nout in a spirit of global partnership will we be able to\r\ncreate a better, more secure world for the generations\r\nto come.\r\nThe President: I now call His Excellency\r\nMr. Crispin Gregoire, chairman of the delegation of the\r\nCommonwealth of Dominica.\r\nMr. Gregoire (Dominica): Mr. President, please\r\nallow me, on behalf of the Government of the\r\nCommonwealth of Dominica, to extend our\r\ncongratulations to you on your assumption of the\r\npresidency at the sixtieth session of the General\r\nAssembly. My delegation is confident that, with your\r\nexperience and diplomatic skills, you will preside over\r\nthe Assembly with the effectiveness and the dedication\r\nrequired to take us through the agenda of the sixtieth\r\nsession. We extend to your predecessor, Mr. Jean Ping\r\nof Gabon, our sincere appreciation for his stewardship\r\nof the fifty-ninth session and for his tireless efforts to\r\nguide the preparation of the outcome document. Our\r\nwarm tribute is also due to the Secretary-General for\r\nhis unqualified dedication to this institution.\r\nAllow me at the outset to convey our deepest\r\nsympathies and condolences to the Government and the\r\npeople of the United States of America in the wake of\r\nthe deaths and widespread destruction caused by\r\nHurricane Katrina. We remain concerned about the\r\npotential devastation that Hurricane Rita is likely to\r\nunleash in coming days.\r\nOne week ago, world leaders gathered here at the\r\nhistoric High-level Plenary Meeting and demonstrated\r\ntheir collective political will to overcome the many\r\nchallenges facing the world. They charted a clear\r\ndirection for a future of peace and prosperity for all\r\nhumankind. They reaffirmed their commitment to\r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals\r\n(MDGs), underscored the continuing relevance of the\r\nUnited Nations and its indispensable role in the\r\ncollective management of the many problems faced by\r\nthe global community, and provided clear\r\nrecommendations for the reform of the Organization.\r\nThe outcome document, while falling short of our\r\nexpectations, presents a platform for multilateral\r\nsolutions to the broad range of global problems related\r\nto development, peace and security, human rights, the\r\nrule of law and the reinvigoration of the United\r\nNations. The Commonwealth of Dominica is\r\ncommitted to the Millennium Development Goals and\r\nembraces the renewed pledge to save humanity from\r\nthe scourge of war, disease, famine and poverty. We\r\nwill work with all Member States to ensure a future\r\nbased on hope and prosperity instead of one of despair\r\nfor the poor and the marginalized of this world. We\r\nnow have before us the monumental task of ensuring\r\nimplementation and tangible outcomes.\r\nFulfilling that task, which our esteemed leaders\r\nhave accorded to us, requires the determined will of all\r\nMember States. It will also require a commitment to\r\nthe collective will and a retreat from preoccupation\r\nwith self-interest and narrow national agendas. If\r\nnothing else, the sixtieth session should go down in\r\nhistory as the session at which we, the Member States,\r\nrenewed our commitment to the ideal that inspired the\r\n31\r\nA/60/PV.23\r\nvisionary founders: building a peaceful and prosperous\r\nworld in which all peoples live together in harmony,\r\nfree from want and fear.\r\nDominica, a small island developing State,\r\nwelcomes the particular attention given in the outcome\r\ndocument to the special needs and vulnerabilities of\r\nsmall island developing States. It is a source of great\r\nencouragement to us that the Member States of the\r\nUnited Nations have demonstrated an appreciation of\r\nthe challenges that confront all small island developing\r\nStates.\r\nThe Mauritius Strategy for the Further\r\nImplementation of the Barbados Programme of Action\r\nis a realistic and attainable blueprint that underscores\r\nthe pivotal areas for interventions to build the capacity\r\nof small island developing States to confront their\r\nvarious sustainable development challenges. We\r\nappreciate the support of our friends and development\r\npartners and appeal for their continuing commitment to\r\nthe proper and effective implementation of the\r\nMauritius Strategy.\r\nProgress in the development arena will require\r\nstrong political will for the implementation of the\r\ncommitments we have undertaken and which we\r\nreaffirmed together in the outcome document of the\r\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting. These concern primarily\r\nthe implementation of the Millennium Development\r\nGoals and the revitalization of the international\r\npartnership for development, with the attendant\r\nmobilization of financial resources, as well as the\r\nfulfilment of the commitment made by many\r\ndeveloped countries to reach the target of 0.7 per cent\r\nof their gross national product for official development\r\nassistance by 2015. Dominica takes this opportunity to\r\nexpress its appreciation to those countries that affirmed\r\ntheir intention to fulfil their obligations in that regard.\r\nMy delegation feels strongly that the consensus\r\nwe reached in the High-level Plenary Meeting\r\nrepresents a good foundation for a greater consensus\r\ntowards achieving the development priorities of the\r\ndeveloping countries. The United Nations must play a\r\npivotal role in ensuring that the issues of trade, debt\r\nrelief, investment and industrial modernization receive\r\nthe highest priority if the global objective is to raise the\r\nstandard of living of the people of the developing\r\ncountries.\r\nWe congratulate the Group of Eight for the\r\ncommitment adopted at the Gleneagles Summit, giving\r\nmuch-needed debt relief to 18 heavily indebted poor\r\ncountries. However, a similar initiative is now required\r\nfor small island developing States and middle income\r\ndeveloping countries that are being strangled by heavy\r\ndebt burdens and the simultaneous erosion of their\r\npreferential trading arrangements.\r\nSouth-South cooperation has been growing over\r\nthe last two decades, and through that mechanism\r\nmany avenues have opened for enhanced trade\r\nrelations and cooperation in the transfer of know-how\r\nand technology. Dominica welcomes the establishment\r\nof the South Fund for Development and Humanitarian\r\nAssistance and the generous initial pledges of the\r\nGovernments of Qatar, India and China to this Fund.\r\nEqually deserving of commendation is Venezuela’s\r\ninitiative in the Caribbean, called Petrocaribe, which\r\nwill help Caribbean countries to respond to the\r\nchallenges posed by the high price of oil.\r\nAid without trade cannot be a viable proposition\r\nfor small island States like Dominica. We are fully\r\ncognizant that only trade can be the engine of growth\r\nand development. Dominica and other banana-\r\nproducing States in the Caribbean have had difficulties\r\nresponding to the stance of multinational corporations\r\nfrom the United States and allied Latin American\r\ncountries that have challenged the preferential access\r\nfor our bananas in the European Union. We hope that\r\nreason will prevail, as we count on a fair resolution of\r\nthe present banana trade impasse in Europe. Only a\r\npositive outcome will avert a future of persistent\r\npoverty for banana farmers and workers in the\r\nCaribbean.\r\nLet me reiterate that small, vulnerable island\r\nStates like Dominica need time to adjust to the\r\ntransition to a fully liberalized global trading regime.\r\nDominica has made admirable progress towards\r\nrealization of the MDGs, but such gains could simply\r\nvanish like a thief in the night if we lose the\r\npreferential access to the European market for our\r\nbananas in 2006. For this reason we appeal to the\r\ninternational community to demonstrate the necessary\r\npolitical will to ensure that the Doha Development\r\nRound takes these concerns into account in the quest\r\nfor a fair and equitable trading system for the benefit\r\nof all our people.\r\nThe frequency of devastating storms in Asia, the\r\nCaribbean and the southern United States and long\r\nperiods of drought in Africa require a more coordinated\r\n32\r\nA/60/PV.23\r\nand organized international response. The United\r\nNations needs to significantly enhance its capacity to\r\nrespond in a timely manner to disasters in the more\r\nvulnerable developing countries. Last year many\r\nCaribbean countries were battered by hurricanes, and\r\nthe Eastern Caribbean nation of Grenada was in the\r\nunfortunate situation of facing the onslaught of two\r\nmajor hurricanes in one calendar year. Grenada still\r\nneeds additional assistance from the international\r\ncommunity, and we appeal to all Member States to lend\r\nsuch assistance.\r\nDominica has had its share of hurricane\r\ndevastation. Late last year we experienced devastation\r\nfrom a series of earthquakes which inflicted significant\r\ndamage on our fragile infrastructure. We continue to be\r\nvigilant and have put in place a national disaster\r\nstrategy to mitigate the adverse effects of such\r\ndisasters on our population. My delegation once again\r\nreiterates the appeal made last year in this Hall by\r\nPrime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit for the creation of a\r\nglobal insurance fund to assist countries devastated by\r\nnatural disasters. We call on the international\r\ncommunity to fully implement the Hyogo Framework\r\nfor Action 2005-2015, adopted at this year’s World\r\nConference on Disaster Reduction.\r\nClimate change is wreaking havoc on small\r\nisland developing States. It is time for all Member\r\nStates to accept that climate change and global\r\nwarming are real and that they are caused by human\r\nactivity. All Member States must implement the\r\nprovisions of the Kyoto Protocol.\r\nMy delegation is concerned about the continuing\r\ninstability in Haiti. We support the role of the United\r\nNations Stabilization Mission in Haiti, but we\r\nappreciate that its limited size and resources are\r\ninadequate to respond to the complicated political\r\nsituation in which Haiti finds itself. Caribbean\r\nCommunity and Common Market (CARICOM) States\r\nhave already committed technical assistance for the\r\nelections and are cognizant that elections alone will not\r\nbring stability to Haiti. Stability will require the\r\naccelerated disbursement of pledged financial\r\nresources, more rapid implementation of social and\r\neconomic project activities, and peacebuilding\r\ninitiatives.\r\nTerrorism remains a great threat to peace and\r\nsecurity at the national, regional and international\r\nlevels. Dominica condemns all acts, methods and\r\npractices of terrorism. The recent attacks in London\r\nand in Egypt underscore the danger of terrorism, which\r\ntranscends national boundaries and does not\r\ndistinguish between peoples, cultures or religions.\r\nDominica is making a great effort to comply with the\r\nobligations of the various counter-terrorism\r\nconventions and pledges its support for the conclusion\r\nof the comprehensive convention on international\r\nterrorism.\r\nMy delegation regrets the failure of the outcome\r\ndocument to address non-proliferation and\r\ndisarmament in the area of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. Relative stability in today’s world should\r\nnot make us complacent and lead us to compromise on\r\nthe need for total disarmament. Our continuing lack of\r\naction on this issue has not served to enhance global\r\nsecurity with respect to the threat posed by these\r\nweapons.\r\nSmall arms and light weapons pose a great\r\nchallenge to the maintenance of peace and security in\r\nthe Caribbean region. Narcotics trafficking has brought\r\nwith it increased circulation of small arms and light\r\nweapons, which has led to a sharp increase in crime\r\nand fatal injuries. Dominica therefore welcomes the\r\nagreement on an international instrument that would\r\nenable States to identify and trace illicit small arms and\r\nlight weapons in a timely and reliable manner. What is\r\nstill needed, however, is a legally binding international\r\ninstrument that will regulate, control and monitor the\r\nillicit trade in small arms, including their transfer to\r\nnon-State actors.\r\nDominica is appreciative of the recognition\r\naccorded to indigenous people in the outcome\r\ndocument. As part of our commitment to the Second\r\nInternational Decade of the World’s Indigenous People,\r\nmy delegation will work with other Member States\r\ntowards the submission to the General Assembly of a\r\ndraft declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples.\r\nThe future of the United Nations depends on full\r\nimplementation of an institutional reform agenda that\r\naddresses revitalization of the General Assembly,\r\nreform of the Security Council and improved\r\ngovernance in the Secretariat. General Assembly\r\nrevitalization must result in the strengthening of the\r\nAssembly’s vital role as the chief deliberative,\r\npolicymaking and implementation-monitoring body of\r\nthe United Nations. The Secretariat needs to urgently\r\naddress eroding public confidence through timely\r\n33\r\nA/60/PV.23\r\nimplementation of the proposals for improvement in its\r\nmanagement and oversight. Reform of the Security\r\nCouncil must be pursued to enhance the Council’s\r\naccountability, transparency and efficiency. Such\r\nreform must, at a minimum, ensure that the Council’s\r\nmembership is more representative and remedy the\r\ncontinuing imbalance in the representation of Africa in\r\nthe permanent membership.\r\nWe welcome the initiative to establish a\r\nDemocracy Fund. Consistent with our support for the\r\npromotion of fundamental human freedoms and values,\r\nwe support the establishment of a Human Rights\r\nCouncil. We also support the proposed Peacebuilding\r\nCommission as an advisory body.\r\nLet me conclude by saying that we have a loaded\r\nagenda for the next decade, and that there are\r\nnumerous challenges ahead. We wish to emphasize that\r\nthat agenda can be realized only through multilateral\r\naction. As we look ahead to 2015, we have the\r\nhonourable duty to make the United Nations truly serve\r\nthe people of this global village. We have the\r\nobligation to ensure that we the peoples of the United\r\nNations can truly live our lives in larger freedom.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Martin Belinga-Eboutou, chairman of the\r\ndelegation of the Republic of Cameroon.\r\nMr. Belinga-Eboutou (Cameroon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): I am particularly pleased to express to you,\r\nSir, Cameroon’s heartfelt congratulations on your\r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at\r\nits sixtieth session. I wish you every success in\r\ncarrying out your noble mandate and assure you of my\r\ndelegation’s full cooperation. I pay a warm tribute to\r\nyour predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Jean Ping,\r\nMinister of State and Minister for Foreign Affairs,\r\nCooperation and Francophonie of the Gabonese\r\nRepublic. His great talent, consummate negotiating\r\nskill and competence contributed decisively to the\r\nsuccess of the work of the fifty-ninth session. To the\r\nSecretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, I\r\nonce again express Cameroon’s full appreciation for\r\nhis tireless efforts and dedication in the service of the\r\nOrganization and its ideals.\r\nAt your wise suggestion, Mr. President, the main\r\ntheme of our debate is the implementation and follow-\r\nup of the outcome document (resolution 60/1) of the\r\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly.\r\nThat reflects the great importance of this debate —\r\nimportance clearly shown by the strong participation in\r\nit. My country is pleased to add its voice to those of the\r\nrepresentatives of 184 other countries, who have\r\nalready spoken during this exercise.\r\nCameroon fully supports the outcome document\r\nadopted at the end of that historic summit. Some would\r\nhave preferred that it be stronger, others that it be more\r\nproactive. Cameroon believes it is a balanced and\r\nrealistic document with regard to all the major global\r\nconcerns now considered to be priorities. Furthermore,\r\nit is a document that reflects a new consensus on the\r\nrole of the United Nations and its place in today’s\r\ninternational system.\r\nOur heads of State or Government took stock of\r\nthe main challenges of our time and of the priority\r\nactions that we must take together to build a genuine\r\nglobal partnership for development and to ensure\r\nlasting collective peace and security. They also set out\r\nguidelines to be followed over the next decade to\r\ncomplete the whole United Nations renewal process\r\nand the effective achievement of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). The time has come to\r\nmove from words to action. Indeed, it is only by\r\nimplementing those commitments that we can measure\r\ntheir value, force and relevance.\r\nIt is indisputable that the world has made\r\nconsiderable progress in implementing some of the\r\nMDGs. But there is another undeniable fact that is far\r\nless encouraging: the situation in Africa. Africa is the\r\nworld’s only region that, with 10 years until the\r\ndeadline, is alarmingly behind in implementing the\r\nMDGs. If it does not receive substantial external\r\nassistance very soon, most of the Goals will not be\r\nattained by 2015. Most of them may remain a mirage\r\nfor a long time.\r\nWe are aware that the current economic growth\r\nrate in our countries averages approximately 3 per cent\r\n. That is not sufficient to create the macroeconomic\r\nconditions necessary to achieve the MDGs. Today —\r\nparticularly in sub-Saharan Africa — without large-\r\nscale job creation, revenue creation, a massive inflow\r\nof private capital or official development assistance, an\r\neffective global and sustainable solution to the nagging\r\nissue of debt, and equitable participation in world\r\ntrade, our efforts will be doomed to failure.\r\nFor their part, the Governments of African\r\ncountries, who have the primary responsibility for their\r\nown development, are implementing national poverty\r\n34\r\nA/60/PV.23\r\nreduction strategies in keeping with the need to achieve\r\nthe MDGs. With specific regard to Cameroon, the\r\nGovernment is tackling that with determination.\r\nFurthermore, the implementation of its Poverty\r\nReduction Strategy Paper is supported by the donor\r\ncommunity.\r\nMy country has begun to review its strategy to\r\nensure that it is fully in line with the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. It is also implementing, with the\r\nsame determination, its national programme of\r\ngovernance. Thus, the Government of Cameroon has\r\nstepped up its efforts to combat corruption and has\r\ncommitted itself to a more transparent and effective\r\nmanagement of public finances.\r\nMy country would have liked to see more\r\nambitious and courageous commitments adopted\r\ntogether with a specific timetable for the development\r\nof Africa. Nevertheless, if the commitments made by\r\nworld leaders in the outcome document are speedily\r\nimplemented, Africa would make considerable\r\nprogress in implementing most of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals and could even — depending on\r\nthe adequate mobilization of national and external\r\nresources and the political will to take action —\r\nachieve all those goals by the agreed date.\r\nDuring a recent crisis, the United Nations was\r\nnearly shaken to its very foundations. During those\r\nevents, our sometimes differing views about our\r\nsystem of peace and collective security became openly\r\napparent. Fortunately, given the need to overcome all\r\nthe global threats that weigh on our collective security,\r\nthe summit reached a healthy consensus on the\r\nessential nature of joint actions that we need to take for\r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes, counteracting\r\nterrorism and the maintenance and consolidation of\r\npeace.\r\nNonetheless, the process of revitalizing the\r\nOrganization will remain incomplete until we are able\r\nto agree on the enlargement of the Security Council.\r\nMay I recall that, as the President of Cameroon, His\r\nExcellence Mr. Paul Biya, declared on 14 September,\r\nCameroon remains faithful to the African position on\r\nreform of the Security Council. This reform is\r\nnecessary and must take place soon, bringing nations\r\ntogether rather than dividing them. This is the firm\r\nconviction of Cameroon, and my country will continue,\r\nhowever long it takes, to work with other States to\r\novercome our differences and forge a solid consensus\r\nin order to achieve this very important reform.\r\nRecourse to law for the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes has, necessarily, as a corollary, the obligation\r\nto implement fully, willingly and in good faith the\r\ndecisions of the International Court of Justice. This is\r\nhow we understand the reference made in the outcome\r\ndocument concerning “the obligation of States to settle\r\ntheir disputes by peaceful means in accordance with\r\nChapter VI of the Charter, including, when appropriate,\r\nby the use of the International Court of Justice”\r\n(resolution 60/1, para. 73).\r\nImplementation of a decision of a court through\r\npositive negotiations is based first and foremost on a\r\npeaceful course of action, specifically on the basis of a\r\ndeep commitment to the values and principles\r\nenshrined in the Charter. In no case may that be\r\ninterpreted as an open possibility to renounce even\r\npartially the fundamental elements of that decision.\r\nVery much to the contrary.\r\nThe outcome document of the High-level Plenary\r\nMeeting allows for coordinating the activities of the\r\nprincipal bodies of the Organization within the\r\nframework of their mandate under the Charter for the\r\nprevention of armed conflicts and settlement of\r\ndisputes. Cameroon therefore believes it desirable that\r\nwe should find ways to ensure that Member States,\r\nthrough the Security Council and in the General\r\nAssembly, are informed formally of the status of\r\nimplementation of judgements handed down by the\r\nInternational Court of Justice, as they are of the\r\nCourt’s annual activities.\r\nThe Secretary-General could thus inform the\r\nSecurity Council regularly and in detail and report to\r\nMember States as is done in his report to the General\r\nAssembly on the activities of the Organization.\r\nGood practices in this area would take root and\r\ninspire us all. In that way, we would be able to identify\r\npotential sources of conflict at a very early stage\r\nthrough difficulties identified and to make timely\r\nrecommendations to prevent them.\r\nCameroon, which looks forward to the rapid\r\ncreation of the Peacebuilding Commission and the\r\nHuman Rights Council, counts on your wisdom to\r\nensure that the negotiating process that will lead to\r\ntheir creation will be open, transparent and inclusive.\r\n35\r\nA/60/PV.23\r\nDuring the present session, which coincides with\r\nthe Organization’s sixtieth anniversary, we should be\r\ninspired by the visionary dynamism provided by the\r\nheads of State and Government. This is a new\r\nopportunity, perhaps one of the best opportunities,\r\nalong with the Millennium Summit, to make a decisive\r\ncontribution to improving the human condition and\r\nachieving an ideal world where all women, men and\r\nchildren live free from fear, hunger and disease.\r\nIt is our responsibility here and now to fulfil the\r\ngenerous promises made by our leaders to humanity a\r\nweek ago. Let us do so without making excuses,\r\nwithout seeking loopholes. Let us do it now.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nthe general debate. Several representatives have\r\nrequested to exercise the right of reply. May I remind\r\nmembers that statements in the exercise of the right of\r\nreply are limited to 10 minutes for the first intervention\r\nand to five minutes for a second intervention and\r\nshould be made by delegations from their seats. I call\r\non the representative of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.\r\nMr. Irhiam (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in\r\nArabic): Let me congratulate you, Mr. President, on\r\nyour vast experience and competence in presiding over\r\nour discussions, and I wish you every success. I would\r\nalso like to point to the excellent relations between the\r\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya and friendly Sweden.\r\nThe Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of\r\nForeign Affairs of Bulgaria mentioned the situation of\r\nthe Libyan children who were deliberately and\r\ngrievously afflicted by the Bulgarian nurses and the\r\nPalestinian physician with the AIDS virus. He also\r\nreferred to the protection of human rights.\r\nIt is true that describing the deaths of a few\r\nchildren and the injuries of many as a tragedy does not\r\nfully reflect the suffering of their families and loved\r\nones. It is more than a tragedy — it is a major disaster\r\nin every possible meaning of the word. It is a disaster\r\nunprecedented in the annals of human history. Thus, if\r\nwe are to truly protect human rights, the rights of\r\nLibyan children must first and foremost be protected,\r\nalong with those of their families and relatives, but not\r\nthose of the Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian\r\nphysician. The disaster has affected not only Benghazi\r\ncity, but all of the decent, generous people of Libya,\r\nwho were deeply shocked by that horrible tragedy.\r\nThe President of Bulgaria and other foreign\r\nofficials who were visiting Libya at the time saw the\r\nextent of the tragedy. They were informed of the legal\r\nprocedures established to deal with the accused. The\r\ntrials were fair and transparent, and included the\r\nparticipation of Bulgarian representatives and several\r\nrepresentatives of diplomatic missions in Libya. The\r\ntrial lasted several months and resulted in a just\r\nconviction. The results of the appeal to the Supreme\r\nCourt are pending.\r\nI would recall that international conferences\r\norganized under United Nations auspices have\r\nconsistently reaffirmed the supremacy of law and that\r\nthere can be no good governance without respect for\r\nthe law and the judiciary.\r\nMr. Ileka (Democratic Republic of the Congo)\r\n(spoke in French): Two days ago, the General\r\nAssembly heard Mr. Sam Kutesa, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Republic of Uganda, describe at length\r\nhis country’s view of the situation in the Great Lakes\r\nregion and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. My\r\ndelegation deeply regrets the fact that Mr. Kutesa’s\r\ncomments were disrespectful, discourteous and totally\r\nunacceptable.\r\nThe representative of a country that has produced\r\nand continues to produce the most Ubu-like dictators\r\nthat our region has ever seen has nothing to teach\r\nanyone. By calling into question the sacrosanct\r\nprinciple of the inviolability of borders since\r\ndecolonization, Mr. Kutesa merely revealed what we\r\nall knew already: his country’s irredentist designs on\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo with the purely\r\nmercantilist aim of making a grab for the eastern\r\nprovinces of my country. The objective of the Ugandan\r\nauthorities, which has been denounced here at the\r\nUnited Nations, is to dismember Africa for the\r\npurposes of attaining economic domination and control\r\nof significant sources of raw materials in Congolese\r\nterritory, which have considerable reserves of raw\r\nmaterials and strategic minerals.\r\nThe Ugandan sponsors of the pillaging of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo’s natural resources\r\nand other wealth are well known. Their names figure\r\nprominently in every report of the relevant United\r\nNations expert groups.\r\nMr. Kutesa’s statement also demonstrated his\r\ncountry’s lack of sincerity and involvement in the\r\npeaceful settlement of the crisis in the Great Lakes\r\n36\r\nA/60/PV.23\r\nregion. Uganda seems to be seeking a new pretext to\r\njustify its negative and harmful interference in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. Coming at a time\r\nwhen, thanks to the concerted efforts of the countries\r\nof Central Africa, most of the countries of the Great\r\nLakes region, the African Union, the United Nations\r\nand interested bilateral partners, a happy end to what\r\nmight be called the first African world war is at hand,\r\nMr. Kutesa’s remarks were most unfortunate.\r\nThe wise Mr. Kutesa has revolutionized\r\ninternational law with his introduction of the concept\r\nof so-called provisional immunity. Nevertheless, in our\r\nview, all Ugandan nationals who have Congolese blood\r\non their hands and whose armed groups pursue a policy\r\nof terrorism against our civilian populations will\r\nultimately have to answer for their actions before either\r\nthe International Criminal Court or ad hoc tribunals.\r\nMoreover, Uganda’s Congolese puppets — the\r\nvery people Mr. Kutesa wishes to see integrated into\r\nthe armed forces of the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo — are, like Colonel Kakolele Bwambale,\r\ncomfortably ensconced in Kampala. These are rebel\r\nofficers who had been nominated in the context of the\r\nintegration of the armed forces command; they include\r\nleaders of armed groups in Ituri and mere warlords.\r\nThey have all gone to Uganda to seek the support of\r\nthe official authorities and to organize themselves in\r\npreparation to attack the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo and roil the transition process there.\r\nAll those Congolese puppets and their Ugandan\r\nmasters are also responsible for terrible large-scale\r\nmassacres of men, women and children; they practice\r\nsummary and extrajudicial executions and systematic\r\nrape; engage in major violations of human rights and\r\ninternational humanitarian law; and deliberately and\r\ncriminally spread HIV/AIDS. Fortunately, with the\r\nhelp of the international community, those Congolese\r\npuppets and Ugandan bandits will not be with us much\r\nlonger.\r\nMr. Kutesa dared to refer to the difficulty of\r\ndisarming the so-called negative forces. I would recall\r\nhere that, at the height of Uganda’s aggression, when it\r\noccupied more than half of our territory, it was\r\nincapable of arresting even one Ugandan rebel.\r\nMoreover, the supposedly powerful Uganda army was\r\nignominiously defeated on three occasions, most\r\nnotably in the martyr city of Kisangani.\r\nClearly, everyone in the Great Lakes region has\r\nsuffered that futile and senseless war for too long. Our\r\nentire population hopes for peace in which we can\r\nrenew the relationships of friendship, trust and\r\npeaceful coexistence of the past. I assure the Assembly\r\nthat the Democratic Republic of the Congo is firmly\r\ncommitted to the peace process because it is in our\r\ninterests and in the interests of the entire Great Lakes\r\nregion.\r\nIn conclusion, my country believes that, in order\r\nto persuade Uganda sincerely to embark on the road to\r\npeace, the international community, represented by all\r\nMember States present here, must impose a\r\ncomprehensive embargo on the sale of arms and\r\nsuspend bilateral and multilateral assistance to that\r\ncountry in order to cut the link between that assistance\r\nand the conflict, which is being fought to perpetuate\r\nthe illegal exploitation of our country’s natural\r\nresources and other wealth. We must take care,\r\nhowever, not to penalize the Ugandan people.\r\nThe international community should also adopt\r\nprotective measures, including the freezing of assets\r\nand a travel ban for high-ranking officials of the\r\nUgandan oligarchy. The international community\r\nshould call on Uganda to respect the various\r\ncommitments it has made in all freedom, be they in the\r\nframework of existing United Nations mechanisms or\r\nthe quartet under United States leadership.\r\nMr. Mammadov (Azerbaijan): I am taking the\r\nfloor to respond to the Armenian representative’s\r\nmisstatement in reply to the statement made by the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan on\r\n18 September.\r\nContrary to the Armenian representative’s\r\npresentation — or, rather, misrepresentation — the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan did not refer\r\nto the territories surrounding the Nagorny Karabakh\r\nregion of Azerbaijan, but to the occupied territories of\r\nAzerbaijan. Azerbaijan has never resorted to military\r\naggression. Armenia, having failed to achieve its\r\npolitical goal of obtaining the secession of Nagorny\r\nKarabakh from Azerbaijan, started the expulsion of\r\nAzerbaijanis from Armenia and resorted, subsequently,\r\nto military aggression in order to acquire, forcibly, the\r\nterritory of the Nagorny Karabakh region of Azerbaijan\r\nand to institute ethnic cleansing in the occupied\r\nAzerbaijani territories. The culmination of those acts of\r\n37\r\nA/60/PV.23\r\nsavagery was the Khojaly massacre — the brutal\r\nslaughter of about 700 innocent civilians.\r\nLike the Security Council, the Parliamentary\r\nAssembly of the Council of Europe — in a resolution\r\nadopted this January, the text of which is annexed to\r\ndocument A/59/689 — specifically established the fact\r\nof the Armenian occupation of the territories of\r\nAzerbaijan. That resolution unequivocally reconfirmed\r\nthat Nagorny Karabakh is an integral part of\r\nAzerbaijan, decisively called for respect for the\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and\r\nits internationally recognized borders, underlined the\r\ninadmissibility of the use of force for the acquisition of\r\nterritory and resolutely demanded an immediate,\r\ncomplete and unconditional withdrawal of all\r\noccupying forces from all occupied areas of Azerbaijan\r\nand the establishment of conditions for the safe return\r\nof displaced persons to their places of permanent\r\nresidence.\r\nThe fact-finding mission of the Organization for\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) that was\r\ndispatched to the occupied territories of Azerbaijan —\r\nthe report of which the Armenian representative also\r\nmisinterpreted — was made feasible by the General\r\nAssembly’s just and fair approach in response to the\r\ngrave concern expressed by Azerbaijan. The fact-\r\nfinding mission confirmed the fact of the Armenian\r\nsettlement of the occupied territories of Azerbaijan, the\r\nregional population of which had been completely\r\nexpelled. In their conclusions and recommendations, as\r\ncontained in annex I to document A/59/747, the Co-\r\nChairmen of the OSCE Minsk Group requested that\r\nany further settlement of the occupied territories of\r\nAzerbaijan should be discouraged and urged that\r\nchanges be avoided in the demographic structure of the\r\nregion, which would make difficult any further efforts\r\nto achieve a negotiated settlement of the conflict in and\r\naround the Nagorny Karabakh region of the Republic\r\nof Azerbaijan.\r\nOut of goodwill, Azerbaijan suggested the use of\r\nthe so-called Lachin corridor as a road of peace by\r\nboth sides in both directions. The rejection of the road\r\nof peace is further proof of the destructive Armenian\r\nposition. However, Azerbaijan still hopes that the\r\nArmenian side will not miss this chance to advance the\r\nnegotiation process, with the assistance of the OSCE\r\nMinsk Group Co-Chairmen, in accordance with the key\r\nunderstanding reached within the Prague process.\r\nThe President: The general debate of the General\r\nAssembly has now concluded. On behalf of the\r\nAssembly, I should like to thank all of the speakers for\r\ntheir contributions.\r\nThe theme of the debate was the follow-up to and\r\nimplementation of the 2005 World Summit Outcome.\r\nOver the past seven days we have heard many\r\nthoughtful and constructive interventions on that\r\nsubject. As at the world summit, speaker after speaker\r\nstressed the need to make faster and more substantial\r\nprogress towards the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nTime after time, as Members may recall, speakers\r\nemphasized the fact that the battle against poverty is\r\none that we must all fight — and win — together. The\r\nstrong message is that the political momentum for\r\ndevelopment — life and dignity for all — which has\r\ngrown this year, must be maintained and strengthened.\r\nIn recognition of that, we should explore ways in\r\nwhich we can speed up progress on development in a\r\nway that complements the work of other parts of the\r\nUnited Nations and other international economic and\r\nsocial bodies.\r\nThere were other widely shared concerns\r\nexpressed in this debate. Many emphasized the\r\nnecessity to make progress in establishing the\r\nPeacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights\r\nCouncil and in moving management reform forward.\r\nTerrorism and the responsibility to protect populations\r\nfrom genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and\r\ncrimes against humanity were also highlighted. Many\r\nexpressed disappointment that a text on disarmament\r\nand non-proliferation was not included in the Summit\r\nOutcome document.\r\nHowever, we should note and welcome the\r\nwidespread recognition that development, security and\r\nrespect for human rights are interconnected and that\r\nthe peoples of the world — our peoples — need and\r\nwant a reformed and rejuvenated United Nations.\r\nUnderstandably, there has not been consensus on\r\nhow every item on our agenda should be taken\r\nforward. But there has also been a widely held view\r\nthat the General Assembly now needs to move quickly\r\non follow-up and implementation, so that the political\r\nenergy generated through the outcome document\r\nnegotiations, the summit and the general debate is not\r\nlost.\r\n38\r\nA/60/PV.23\r\nOver the next few days, I will reflect carefully on\r\nthe points made during the debate. I will also make\r\nmyself available next week to meet Member States,\r\neither individually or in groups, to hear more of their\r\nviews on priorities and ways of working. I would\r\nencourage any Member State which has further\r\nthoughts on follow-up and implementation to contact\r\nme or my Office as early as possible next week.\r\nTaking into account the views expressed, I intend\r\nto write to all Member States before the end of next\r\nweek outlining the proposed way forward. Shortly\r\nthereafter, I plan to convene an open meeting to\r\ninvolve all Member States in the final consolidation of\r\nthe proposed programme of work.\r\nOnce that process of consultation is completed,\r\nwork on follow-up will have to begin without delay. As\r\nI said when I opened the debate on 17 September, the\r\nworld will be watching us closely. The extent to which\r\nwe — all of us in the Assembly — can muster a spirit\r\nof urgency and common purpose in the coming days\r\nand weeks will ultimately determine whether the world\r\nsummit will go down in history as a missed\r\nopportunity for the United Nations or, as I hope, the\r\nstart of the most substantial reform programme in the\r\nhistory of the Organization.\r\nWe will need to work efficiently, with civility,\r\ndiscipline and a readiness to compromise for the\r\ngreater good. I want to assure members that I intend to\r\nconduct this work with transparency, fairness and\r\nrespect for the General Assembly’s central and crucial\r\nrole in these negotiations. It is here, and only here, that\r\nnegotiations will take place and decisions will be\r\nmade. I look forward to working with all members in\r\nthat spirit as we shoulder our historic responsibility\r\ntogether.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the General\r\nAssembly to conclude its consideration of agenda item\r\n8? I see no objection.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 7.05 p.m.\r\n"
