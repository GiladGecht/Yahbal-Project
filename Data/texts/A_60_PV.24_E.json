(Sweden)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 110 (continued)\r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization (A/60/1)\r\nThe President: Members will recall that the\r\nSecretary-General presented his report to the General\r\nAssembly at the 9th plenary meeting, held on\r\n17 September 2005.\r\nMr. Neil (Jamaica): I wish to begin by thanking\r\nthe Secretary-General for his report on the work of the\r\nOrganization over the past year (A/60/1). It gives us a\r\nwide survey of the many activities in which the United\r\nNations is engaged and illustrates its extended reach\r\nand coverage in promoting international cooperation.\r\nThe report reveals significant variations across the\r\nvarious fields in relation to both performance and\r\nresults. There have been successes as well as setbacks\r\nin a year of mixed fortunes for the Organization.\r\nOn behalf of the Group of 77 and China, I will\r\naddress the report’s coverage of United Nations\r\nactivities in international economic cooperation, which\r\nwe consider to be a major priority for the Organization.\r\nPoverty, hunger, disease and their attendant maladies\r\nare conditions that call for concerted action — not just\r\nfrom instincts of human solidarity, but because they are\r\ncentral to achieving the overall goals of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe past year was one in which major reviews\r\nwere undertaken of progress in a number of different\r\nfields. In February, the Commission for Social\r\nDevelopment carried out its 10-year review of the\r\nsocial development agenda set out in Copenhagen and\r\nat the twenty-fourth special session of the General\r\nAssembly. The review of the Beijing Platform followed\r\nshortly afterward, at the March meeting of the\r\nCommission on the Status of Women. Both outcomes\r\nshowed a mixed picture and registered a clear message\r\non the need to complete the unfinished agenda on\r\npoverty reduction, social integration, full employment,\r\ngender equality and the empowerment of women.\r\nDuring the thirteenth session of the Commission\r\non Sustainable Development, in April, we recognized\r\nthe critical importance of concrete actions on issues of\r\nwater, sanitation and human settlements. Important and\r\npractical policy options were identified and now await\r\nsupport and sponsorship.\r\nThe focus on assessing progress towards the\r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) after five\r\nyears occupied much of the attention of the General\r\nAssembly for most of the year. Reports and studies\r\nwere presented which highlighted the importance of\r\nurgent action, especially in those regions that have\r\nmade limited progress. The Millennium Project report\r\n(A/59/727), published in January, contained many\r\nimpressive proposals that, regrettably, did not survive\r\nthe negotiations for inclusion in the outcome document\r\nof the High-level Plenary Meeting (resolution 60/1).\r\nWe also recognized that, beyond the MDGs, there is\r\n2\r\nA/60/PV.24\r\nwider scope for development cooperation. The\r\nSecretary-General’s report correctly points out that,\r\nwhile the MDGs provide a compelling platform for\r\nmobilizing the international community, there is a\r\nbroader development agenda that needs to be\r\nadvanced, particularly in trade, finance and monetary\r\naffairs and the transfer of technology. These issues\r\nwere not dealt with as forcefully as we would have\r\nliked in the 2005 World Summit Outcome. They will\r\nhave to be given priority in the overall implementation\r\nof the commitments undertaken with respect to\r\ndevelopment in the future direction of international\r\neconomic cooperation.\r\nEfforts within the United Nations system to\r\npromote economic growth and development are based\r\non a shared commitment anchored on the principle of\r\ncommon but differentiated responsibilities among\r\ndeveloped and developing countries. The most urgent\r\ntask is to promote implementation of commitments\r\nthrough strengthening the global partnership; through\r\nthe adoption of policies that enhance opportunities for\r\ngrowth for developing countries; through the removal\r\nof inequities in the international system that are\r\nconstraints to development; and through greater\r\ndemocratic participation for all States in international\r\neconomic decision-making. In the Organization’s\r\nprogress on these matters over the past year, the record\r\nhas not been impressive. It is of utmost importance that\r\nthe United Nations system gear itself to accomplish\r\nthese objectives.\r\nWe have to think of ways to strengthen the role of\r\nthe United Nations in promoting the implementation of\r\ndevelopment commitments by development partners\r\nand development institutions. We believe that the\r\nEconomic and Social Council, which was assigned\r\nseveral responsibilities to promote policy dialogue and\r\ndevelopment cooperation in the recently adopted 2005\r\nWorld Summit Outcome, has a critical role to play in\r\nguiding a bold and focused implementation process to\r\nfulfil these commitments.\r\nMajor efforts need to be applied in the area of the\r\nimplementation of commitments on the transfer of\r\nresources. Important steps have been taken by the\r\nEuropean Union on official development assistance\r\n(ODA) timetables, and by the Group of Eight on debt,\r\nwhich should have a significant impact on resource\r\nflows. The international community should build on\r\nthese positive steps and maintain momentum on\r\nresource mobilization.\r\nIn the operational activities of the United Nations\r\nfor development, we support the Secretary-General’s\r\nemphasis on increasing the level of inter-agency\r\ncoordination in the delivery of technical cooperation,\r\nbut we are concerned about the inadequacy of\r\noversight arrangements and about the tendency towards\r\nconcentration on governance and human rights. What\r\nis needed is a broader approach to capacity-building,\r\none which encourages assistance and support to\r\nprojects that directly address poverty alleviation, such\r\nas those driving increased employment generation and\r\nthe development of infrastructure.\r\nAt the global level, greater efforts need to be\r\nmade to improve the United Nations role in the\r\ninterface with the Bretton Woods institutions in order\r\nto have greater influence on the formulation of global\r\neconomic policies. The current arrangement for the\r\nspring high-level meeting with the Economic and\r\nSocial Council needs to be expanded in its scope,\r\nduration and substantive result. It is essential that we\r\nmove beyond the current format in order to give this\r\nmechanism the possibility for greater impact.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report also draws\r\nattention to the wave of humanitarian emergencies\r\nexperienced during the past year. The increased\r\nfrequency of hurricanes in the Caribbean and the Gulf\r\nof Mexico, the swarm of locusts in Africa and the\r\ntsunami in the Indian Ocean were among the most\r\ndevastating. The great outpouring of international\r\nsupport for relief to countries affected by the tsunami\r\nwas unprecedented in its scale and served to alleviate\r\nthe human and economic costs to affected developing\r\ncountries. Unfortunately, other crises less spectacular\r\nand lesser in scale suffered from neglect and lack of\r\nmedia attention.\r\nWe wish to commend and acknowledge the work\r\nof the United Nations, which in all these circumstances\r\nhas been sustained and effective. The United Nations\r\nOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\r\nand its leadership deserve our praise for their advocacy\r\nin generating international support and for their own\r\ncontribution in the conduct of relief operations. We\r\nendorse the Secretary-General’s appeal for an increase\r\nin funding, which continues to be below the level\r\nrequired to deal effectively with the consequences of\r\nnatural disasters. We welcome the moves to expand the\r\nCentral Emergency Revolving Fund and the\r\ncommitment of donors. The increased attention to\r\nnatural disaster management called for at the national\r\n3\r\nA/60/PV.24\r\nand international levels is clearly justified. Much of the\r\ndevastation has affected developing countries already\r\nbesieged by economic problems, making it more\r\ndifficult for them to cope with severe hardships and to\r\nadvance development efforts. We need to work\r\nexpeditiously and with a sense of urgency towards the\r\nearly establishment of a worldwide early warning\r\nsystem for all natural hazards.\r\nIn the course of the past year, much attention was\r\nfocused on administrative and management issues\r\nresulting from allegations of improprieties, which gave\r\nrise to investigations conducted in some operations.\r\nAllegations of misconduct and corrupt practices gave\r\nrise to great concern and adverse publicity in sections\r\nof the news media. We are satisfied that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral took prompt action to ensure a thorough and\r\nfair investigation, especially in relation to the\r\nmanagement of the oil-for-food programme. The\r\nrevelation of irregularities in the conduct of the\r\nprogramme obviously would justify the need for\r\nimproved arrangements for accountability and\r\noversight. It is vital that independent auditing and\r\noversight arrangements ensure that ethical standards\r\nare maintained, that there is full accountability, that\r\nthere is transparency in United Nations operations and\r\nthat efficiency and the avoidance of waste are ensured.\r\nIt seems clear that what is needed now is not a\r\nrush into hasty action and the installation of new\r\nmechanisms to satisfy pressures generated through\r\nsections of the news media. There should be a\r\ncomprehensive review of governance arrangements and\r\nproposals submitted to the General Assembly for\r\nconsideration, on the basis of which carefully thought-\r\nout remedies can be applied to meet the exacting\r\nstandards of efficiency and ethical conduct we require\r\nin the operations of the United Nations. We should, at\r\nthe same time, recognize reforms that have already\r\nbeen achieved. The Secretary-General has pointed out\r\nin his report that most of the reform elements\r\npreviously proposed have been implemented, resulting\r\nin clear benefits, including a revised budgetary process\r\nwith a shorter, efficient cycle of planning and\r\nbudgeting, a reduction in the quantity of reports and\r\nbetter utilization of conference services.\r\nWe note also that the Secretary-General has\r\nembarked on internal management reforms, and we\r\nparticularly welcome his initiatives for more\r\ntransparency in the system for the appointment of\r\nsenior officials and heads of agencies. We hope that\r\nthis policy will be extended to all appointments at the\r\nappropriate levels of senior management.\r\nIn relation to the process under the Capital\r\nMaster Plan, the situation has become difficult due to\r\ncomplications in the availability of temporary\r\naccommodation, and the alternatives do not appear to\r\nbe very favourable. In addition, as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral points out, some of the underlying\r\nexpectations for advancing the project as approved in\r\n2004 have not been fulfilled. This is especially so with\r\nregard to the financing arrangements and the terms and\r\nconditions of the loan offer from the host country,\r\nwhich need serious reflection by Member States.\r\nOn the overall question of resources, we share the\r\nSecretary-General’s concern over the fragility of the\r\nfinancial situation of the United Nations. The problem\r\nof unpaid assessments continues to deplete resources,\r\nwhich, in turn, requires resorting to cross-borrowing to\r\nfinance existing programmes. The Group of 77 and\r\nChina reaffirms that the solution lies in the hands of\r\nMember States, which should honour their legal\r\nobligations to pay their assessed contributions to the\r\nUnited Nations in full, on time and without conditions.\r\nIncreased security arrangements for the\r\nSecretariat were carried out during the past year,\r\nincluding the establishment of a Department of Safety\r\nand Security which came into effect in January. This\r\nwas in response to the increasing concern over security\r\naffecting the United Nations staff at Headquarters and\r\nin different parts of the world. We support\r\narrangements for ensuring that the staff of the United\r\nNations receives adequate protection, especially where\r\nconditions are most volatile. However, we expect\r\nappropriate security arrangements to be determined on\r\nthe basis of some principles of differentiation and\r\nstringent security arrangements not to unduly limit the\r\nengagement of the United Nations staff in dealing with\r\nproblems on the ground. It is important that, at the\r\npeople level, the United Nations presence be more than\r\na symbol and that visible engagement take place,\r\nespecially in relation to the implementation of social\r\nand economic programmes.\r\nIn reporting on partnerships, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has emphasized the importance of forging\r\nlinks and broadening the involvement of civil society,\r\nbusiness groupings and other entities in the work of the\r\nUnited Nations. This should be encouraged, but with a\r\nrecognition of the need to respect the\r\n4\r\nA/60/PV.24\r\nintergovernmental nature of the Organization and the\r\nneed to ensure that all initiatives in relation to\r\nparticipation and joint efforts with non-governmental\r\norganizations fall within accepted guidelines and do\r\nnot compromise or undermine the rights and interests\r\nof Member States.\r\nIn conclusion, the Secretary-General’s report on\r\nthe past year shows a mixed record and underlines the\r\nneed to strengthen the United Nations and the system\r\nof international cooperation. It is obvious that the\r\nOrganization will have to adapt to changing conditions\r\nand that reform should be made where reform is\r\nneeded. It is important in that process that we\r\nrecognize the importance of inclusiveness and\r\ntransparency in any decision-making and ensure that\r\nthe results reflect the wide interests of what is a diverse\r\ncommunity of nations. This is best accomplished by\r\ndue consideration of all proposals for reform, in a\r\nprocess within the established procedures and\r\nmechanisms of the General Assembly.\r\nIn achieving our goals we will continue to rely on\r\na Secretariat which is politically neutral and objective\r\nin the implementation of mandates and which is\r\ncommitted to the principles of international service,\r\nworking under the direction of the intergovernmental\r\nbodies of the Organization. This should always remain\r\nparamount.\r\nMr. Akram (Pakistan): We thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his comprehensive report on the work of\r\nthe Organization (A/60/1). It gives a broad overview of\r\nthe activities of the United Nations, as well as of the\r\nmajor challenges that confront the world today.\r\nThe performance and effectiveness of the United\r\nNations depend on several crucial factors: first, the\r\nquality of its human resources; secondly, the financial\r\nresources provided to support its activities; thirdly, the\r\nauthority vested in the Organization by Member States;\r\nand fourthly — and most important — the political will\r\nof Member States to support the mandated programmes\r\nand activities of the United Nations. Viewed in that\r\ncontext, and considering the recognized constraints, the\r\nperformance of the United Nations and its family of\r\norganizations must be judged to be largely satisfactory.\r\nWe welcome the progress registered towards\r\nachieving peace in Afghanistan, the Sudan, Iraq and,\r\nlately, in the Korean peninsula. We see better prospects\r\nfor peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine and\r\nthe Jammu and Kashmir dispute. We remain concerned,\r\nhowever, over the persistence of other crises and\r\nconflicts in Asia and Africa, where innocent lives are\r\nbeing lost daily. We condemn the recent terrorist\r\nattacks in the United Kingdom, Egypt, Iraq and other\r\nregions of the world.\r\nPakistan commends the Secretary-General for his\r\nconsistent efforts to provide and promote solutions to\r\nthose issues. We particularly appreciate his initiative to\r\nlaunch the process of United Nations reform. The 2005\r\nworld summit affirmed that the United Nations must be\r\nenabled to play a central role in addressing the\r\nmultifaceted and interconnected challenges and threats\r\nconfronting the world today.\r\nPakistan supported the adoption of the outcome\r\ndocument (resolution 60/1). It reflects the existing\r\nconsensus on a range of issues. However, like many\r\nothers, we are disappointed with the results. We could\r\nhave achieved more perhaps if the agenda had not been\r\nso extensive, if the debate on Security Council reform\r\nhad not sapped energy from the preparatory process,\r\nand if negotiations on the document had been\r\ncommenced earlier, as we had suggested. However, the\r\nreal challenge now is to ensure effective\r\nimplementation and follow-up of those decisions. My\r\nForeign Minister has already outlined Pakistan’s\r\ngeneral approach on various issues where action will\r\nbe required at this session (see A/60/PV.18).\r\nToday, I would like to offer some remarks on the\r\nimplementation process. Pakistan regards the outcome\r\ndocument as the beginning, not the end, of the United\r\nNations reform process. Implementation of decisions\r\nand commitments made should be balanced, with\r\npriority being accorded to development.\r\nImplementation involves not only building new\r\ninstitutions or reforming existing ones, but also\r\nreviewing and ensuring the implementation of the\r\npolicies and commitments that Member States have\r\nundertaken in the outcome document. The\r\nimplementation process should be located within the\r\nGeneral Assembly, not in groups or forums outside the\r\nUnited Nations. It should be Member-driven, with\r\nsupport, as required, from the Secretariat. And the\r\nprocess should be open, transparent and inclusive.\r\nThe implementation process will have to traverse\r\nfour stages. First, decisions to be followed up must be\r\nidentified. Secondly, proposals must be submitted and\r\ncirculated. Thirdly, outcomes need to be negotiated by\r\nconsensus. In that regard, voting should be avoided,\r\n5\r\nA/60/PV.24\r\nsince it would open a Pandora’s box of divisive votes\r\non various issues. Finally, the status of implementation\r\nhas to be reviewed, perhaps at the end of December\r\nand early next year, and again just before the end of the\r\nsixtieth session.\r\nWe will support efforts to take action on the\r\nHuman Rights Council, the Peacebuilding\r\nCommission, a counter-terrorism strategy and\r\nconvention and management reform. But, there must be\r\npriority action on development. Development remains\r\nthe highest priority for the vast majority of Member\r\nStates. We fully endorse the statement just made by the\r\nPermanent Representative of Jamaica on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China.\r\nThe outcome document embodies welcome\r\nrecommendations on official development assistance\r\ntargets, debt relief, enhancing and improving aid and\r\naddressing the special needs of Africa. Developing\r\ncountries — and others — are, however, not fully\r\nsatisfied with the outcome in several areas, such as\r\ntrade, investment flows and global governance. Lack of\r\nprogress on the implementation of development\r\ncommitments would, therefore, further accentuate\r\nexisting misgivings.\r\nA bold and focused implementation process to\r\nfulfil commitments undertaken on development issues\r\nis thus absolutely critical. The United Nations, and the\r\nGeneral Assembly, cannot abdicate the responsibility\r\nto secure fulfilment of the development goals and\r\ncommitments that have been undertaken. It is therefore\r\nimperative to put in place an effective mechanism to\r\npromote and monitor the implementation of the agreed\r\ngoals and commitments on development by States, by\r\ndevelopment partners and by the concerned\r\ninstitutions, including the Bretton Woods institutions.\r\nPakistan will shortly circulate a paper on the\r\nimplementation of development decisions.\r\nThe 2005 summit assigned several\r\nresponsibilities to the Economic and Social Council in\r\npromoting policy dialogue, development cooperation,\r\npost-conflict development, and coordination within the\r\nUnited Nations system. The Council should also play\r\nan important role in promoting and monitoring the\r\nimplementation of the Development Goals.\r\nSecurity Council reform should not be allowed to\r\nonce again divert attention from other areas. The\r\nSeptember deadline precipitated a confrontation. We\r\nhope that the December deadline will not be pressed\r\nand will not provoke a similar confrontation. Efforts\r\nshould be made, through quiet consultations, to explore\r\na possible consensus. For that, time will be necessary.\r\nWe are confident, Mr. President, that under your\r\nable leadership Member States will succeed in\r\nimplementing the agenda that the September summit\r\nhas set for us. We assure you of our fullest cooperation\r\nin that endeavour.\r\nMr. Hannesson (Iceland): Mr. President, we\r\ncongratulate you on your election and wish you well in\r\nthe important work ahead. Your speech on\r\n23 September, at the end of the general debate (see\r\nA/60/PV.23), bears witness to your dedication to the\r\nOrganization and what it stands for. We thank the\r\nSecretary-General for the comprehensive report on the\r\nwork of the Organization (A/60/1). It is now up to us,\r\nthe Member States, to make concrete efforts to\r\nimplement and follow up the decisions made at the\r\nsummit so that its outcome will become a real success.\r\nLooking back over the past year in which the\r\nlevel of United Nations peacekeeping operations\r\nreached a historic high, we welcome the emphasis our\r\nleaders placed on investing in prevention,\r\npeacemaking, peacekeeping and peacebuilding. We\r\nwelcome in particular the creation of a peacebuilding\r\ncommission and a support office within the Secretariat.\r\nWe must ensure that both are up and running by the\r\nend of the year.\r\nWe fully concur with the Secretary-General in his\r\nreport on the extent to which terrorism is a threat to\r\neverything the United Nations stands for. We support\r\nthe thrust of the five-point strategy previously outlined\r\nby the Secretary-General. If the struggle against\r\nterrorism is to be successful, it is essential for us to\r\nagree on definitions and means for prevention and to\r\nconclude a comprehensive convention against terrorism\r\nbefore the end of this session of the General Assembly.\r\nUnfortunately, no progress on non-proliferation\r\nwas reached in May this year at the Review Conference\r\nof the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons and we failed at the major summit to\r\naddress that issue. Proliferation is a profound danger,\r\nwhich the United Nations must confront in a decisive\r\nmanner. If we continue on the present path of\r\nstalemate, the threat of terrorism, combined with\r\nweapons of mass destruction, will only grow.\r\n6\r\nA/60/PV.24\r\nWe thank the Secretary-General for his valuable\r\ncontribution to development by placing it at the centre\r\nof the ongoing reform. The two major reports on\r\ndevelopment — that by Professor Sachs and the\r\nSecretary’s-General report “In larger freedom” —\r\nillustrate the clear link between development and\r\nsecurity, which underlines further the need to address\r\nthose issues in tandem.\r\nThe Government of Iceland has acknowledged\r\nthe great challenge posed by the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals and will increase efforts to assist\r\nthe developing countries in reaching these Goals. Each\r\ncountry must, however, take primary responsibility for\r\nits own economic and social development, and a key\r\nelement of successful long-term development is good\r\ngovernance and the rule of law. A developing country\r\nthat creates a transparent and accountable environment\r\nthat respects good governance and the rule of law will\r\nattract domestic and foreign investment, which will\r\nfoster the growth of a vibrant private sector.\r\nInternational trade liberalization is a key pillar\r\nfor the private sector and a successful conclusion of the\r\nDoha development agenda is important for the\r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals. A\r\nfair, open and equitable multilateral trade system\r\nwould allow developing countries to take full part in\r\nthe globalized economy and thus contribute\r\nsignificantly to increasing the resources available in\r\nthe developing countries to combat poverty.\r\nWe welcome the fact that the Office of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights has\r\nplaced greater emphasis on strengthening national\r\nsystems for human rights protection. We also welcome\r\nother new developments in the same direction. There\r\nis, however, an urgent need to reform the human rights\r\nmachinery of the United Nations.\r\nPlease allow me to quote the Icelandic Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs, speaking at the general debate of\r\nthis Assembly:\r\n“The Commission on Human Rights is\r\ndysfunctional and devoid of credibility;\r\ndeliberations on human rights have suffered\r\naccordingly. Moreover, the credibility of the\r\nentire United Nations Organization is\r\nthreatened… For Iceland, the ideal human rights\r\ncouncil would be smaller than the Commission\r\nand would be in session all year so that it can\r\nrespond to emergencies. The composition of the\r\nnew council will be fundamental to its\r\neffectiveness. It must not include major human\r\nrights abusers.” (see A/60/PV.16)\r\nWe have a mandate from the major summit to\r\nestablish a human rights council and it is up to us to\r\nget it up and running as soon as possible and not later\r\nthan before this session of the General Assembly ends.\r\nIt is essential that the Secretariat be equipped to\r\ndeal with the challenges that we, the Member States,\r\nhave thrust upon it. I would like at this point to praise\r\nthe Secretariat, under the inspirational leadership of the\r\nSecretary-General and a number of other top officials,\r\nfor its committed and professional work in many areas.\r\nBut, as in any large organization, adjustments are\r\nneeded, new skills need to be brought in, and a more\r\nrapid renewal of staff may be required than can be\r\nachieved by natural turnover. That may entail some\r\nexpense in the short term, but with dividends in the\r\nlong run.\r\nIt is for the Member States to ensure that we are\r\nnot imposing too many tasks on the Secretariat and\r\nspreading resources too thinly. Iceland therefore stands\r\nfully behind the Secretary-General in his efforts to\r\nmodernize the management and to strengthen the\r\nOrganization. We must live up to the promises we\r\nmade at the major summit by providing the United\r\nNations with adequate resources to enable it to\r\nimplement its mandates and achieve its objectives.\r\nLet me conclude by congratulating the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and his staff on the work they have undertaken\r\nin this historic and hectic year of action, often under\r\ndifficult circumstances.\r\nSir Emyr Jones Parry (United Kingdom): I have\r\nthe honour to speak on behalf of the European Union\r\nand those countries that have aligned themselves with\r\nthis statement.\r\nThe European Union thanks the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his comprehensive report on the work of\r\nthe Organization during one of its busiest years — a\r\nyear culminating in the achievements and decisions of\r\nthe world summit. The summit outcome is a clear\r\nmandate for change, addressing the challenges that the\r\nworld has long faced.\r\nI would now like to respond to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral by describing how the European Union hopes\r\nthe summit will equip the United Nations better to\r\n7\r\nA/60/PV.24\r\nmeet the challenges outlined in the main sections of his\r\nreport.\r\nFirst, I would refer to peace and security. Not\r\nonly are development, security and human rights each\r\nimperative in their own right; they are mutually\r\nreinforcing. We have seen time and time again how\r\nconflict and instability in developing countries have\r\ndestroyed fragile social, environmental and economic\r\nprogress. The threats of terrorism and proliferation\r\nendanger the stable global environment within which\r\ntrade flourishes and economies grow.\r\nThe summit agreement to establish a\r\npeacebuilding commission will make a major\r\ncontribution to a better coordinated international\r\nresponse to the needs of countries emerging from\r\nconflict. It will help prevent conflicts from restarting\r\nand encourage countries to make the transition from\r\nviolent instability to peaceful, sustained development.\r\nThe European Union is committed to seeing the\r\nCommission established by the end of this year.\r\nIncreasingly, conflict and violence take place\r\nbeyond the boundaries of conventional war. No\r\ncontinent is safe from the threat of terror. International\r\nterrorism requires an international response. We pay\r\nthe price for each others’ vulnerabilities.\r\nThe United Nations has already done much to set\r\ninternational standards against terrorism and to\r\nencourage and help States to meet them. The European\r\nUnion welcomes the summit outcome’s clear\r\ncondemnation of terrorism and the undertaking to\r\nconclude a comprehensive convention on international\r\nterrorism during this sixtieth session. The European\r\nUnion firmly believes that the targeting and deliberate\r\nkilling of civilians and non-combatants cannot be\r\njustified or legitimized by any cause or grievance.\r\nThe European Union regrets the summit’s failure\r\nto reach agreement on measures for non-proliferation\r\nand disarmament. In his speech to the Review\r\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral gave stark warning of the catastrophic global\r\nimpact of any such use. We should heed his words.\r\nSecondly, with respect to development, the\r\nSummit provided the foundation for strengthening the\r\nglobal partnership between developed and developing\r\ncountries, as set out at Monterrey. The European Union\r\nhas set a timetable to reach new levels of official\r\ndevelopment assistance. By 2010, this will account for\r\n0.56 per cent of the Union’s collective gross national\r\nincome — an annual additional 20 billion euros. By\r\n2015, it will reach 0.7 per cent. EU member States\r\nrecently agreed to support the G-8 agreement to write\r\noff debt. In addition, the summit recognized the value\r\nof developing innovative sources of financing. Such\r\nscaled-up financing is vital in our joint endeavour to\r\nreach the Millennium Development Goals by 2015.\r\nSub-Saharan Africa is not on target to reach many\r\nof the MDGs until something like 100 years from now.\r\nIn some areas — including hunger and sanitation —\r\nthe situation is actually deteriorating. At least 50 per\r\ncent, therefore, of the increase in the European Union’s\r\naid resources will go to Africa; in plain terms, that\r\nrepresents a doubling of EU assistance to Africa over\r\nthe next five years. Of course, all of us need to live up\r\nto and meet the commitments that we have taken on.\r\nMore aid on its own will not be enough. The real\r\nengines for making poverty history will be the\r\ndeveloping countries themselves. Making sure that aid\r\nis used better and more effectively is as important as\r\nincreasing it. We need to drive up standards of\r\ngovernance and help the poorest people, for whom\r\nsupport is most crucial. This means developing\r\ncountries adopting ambitious national development\r\nstrategies, creating and reinforcing good governance\r\nstructures, fostering a positive environment for\r\neconomic growth, and helping the private sector\r\nflourish. We welcome the strong and comprehensive\r\ncommitments made in that regard by the African\r\ncountries through the African Union and the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD)\r\ninitiative.\r\nAs for trade, the EU believes that, through the\r\nDoha round, the international community must deliver\r\nreal gains. With a comprehensive, pro-development\r\nagenda combining trade liberalization with rule-\r\nmaking and complementary aid for both trade and\r\ntrade-related assistance, the Doha round can bring\r\nbenefits to all trading partners and in particular, and\r\ncrucially, to developing countries. We therefore need to\r\nmake all the efforts necessary to produce a successful\r\nconclusion to the Doha round, and in particular to\r\nensure that the opportunity of the Hong Kong\r\nMinisterial Meeting is not missed.\r\nWe need to ensure that development, in rich and\r\npoor countries alike, is sustainable. The Union\r\n8\r\nA/60/PV.24\r\ntherefore welcomes the summit’s recognition of the\r\nneed to meet the commitments and obligations\r\nundertaken in the Framework Convention on Climate\r\nChange, which we consider to be the appropriate forum\r\nfor negotiating future action on climate change. The\r\nUnion is firmly committed to urgent global action to\r\nmitigate climate change — a serious, long-term\r\nchallenge for every part of the world. The EU\r\nwelcomes the summit’s decision to explore the\r\npossibility of a more coherent framework and more\r\nefficient environmental activities in the United Nations\r\nsystem, including through a more integrated structure.\r\nThirdly, improving international architecture for\r\nhumanitarian response and operational activities is\r\nlong overdue. The response to the appalling tsunami in\r\nthe Indian Ocean in December demonstrated the\r\nwillingness of Governments, civil society and the\r\nprivate sector to respond rapidly and generously to an\r\nunprecedented crisis. But the Sudan, northern Uganda\r\nand the Democratic Republic of the Congo continue to\r\nillustrate the fact that we must do better. At an\r\noperational level, the Union is determined to see\r\nimprovements in the predictability of humanitarian\r\nfunding and capacity and standby arrangements, inter\r\nalia through the modernization of the Central\r\nEmergency Revolving Fund.\r\nThe current reforms to operational activities,\r\nwhich will bring the various United Nations agencies\r\nand programmes working in one country together\r\nunder a single leader and common management, are\r\ngood. We look forward to the Secretary-General’s\r\nfurther work on strengthening the management and\r\ncoordination of operational activities to make an even\r\nmore effective contribution to the achievement of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nFourthly, with respect to the international legal\r\norder and human rights, over 50 years the United\r\nNations has had remarkable success. It has built a\r\nframework of international human rights law and set\r\nclear standards by which all States are to be judged.\r\nBut in setting standards, we have neglected for too\r\nlong their implementation. When standards have been\r\nbreached, we have not always done enough. The Union\r\ntherefore welcomes the unprecedented recognition of\r\nthe international community’s responsibility to protect\r\npopulations from the threat of genocide, war crimes,\r\nethnic cleansing or crimes against humanity.\r\nThe summit took two other important steps\r\ntowards creating more effective human rights\r\nmachinery within the United Nations: the decision to\r\nestablish a Human Rights Council and the commitment\r\nto reinforce the role of, and double the resources\r\navailable to, the Office of the High Commissioner on\r\nHuman Rights. Protection and promotion of human\r\nrights has been reinforced as the third pillar of the\r\nwork of the United Nations, alongside development\r\nand peace and security. The EU will work to complete\r\nas soon as possible, during this sixtieth session,\r\nnegotiations on the mandate, modalities, functions,\r\nsize, composition, membership, and working methods\r\nof the new Council.\r\nThe Union reiterates its strong support for the\r\nInternational Criminal Court. We welcome the fact that\r\nthe Security Council decided to refer the situation in\r\nDarfur since 1 July 2002 to the Court. That will help\r\ncontribute to our common objective of ending impunity\r\nand establishing the rule of law in post-conflict or\r\ncrisis situations.\r\nTurning now to Secretariat and management\r\nreform, the European Union welcomes the decisions on\r\nmanagement reform taken at the summit and intends to\r\npursue their implementation vigorously during this\r\nsession. There needs to be a modernized approach to\r\nmanagement in the United Nations based on\r\nstrengthened accountability, greater transparency and\r\nmore efficient working practices. It is vital that the\r\nresources of the United Nations be channelled to the\r\nareas of greatest need, where they will have the\r\ngreatest impact. The European Union therefore\r\nwelcomes the summit decision on the review of\r\nmandates. The Secretary-General, for his part, needs\r\nthe authority and flexibility to carry out his managerial\r\nresponsibilities and to be able to redeploy resources\r\nfrom lower- to higher-priority areas.\r\nThe EU underscores its support for stronger\r\nUnited Nations-wide coherence, starting with the\r\nimplementation of the measures identified at the\r\nsummit to promote coherence of policy, operational\r\nactivities, humanitarian assistance and environmental\r\nactivities.\r\nThe EU is committed to ensuring the availability\r\nof adequate resources for the United Nations while\r\nadhering to our longstanding principles of budgetary\r\ndiscipline. We will therefore seek to adopt an\r\nappropriate budget for 2006-07 that will enable the\r\n9\r\nA/60/PV.24\r\nUnited Nations to deliver meaningful results in all its\r\nactivities, including new mandates agreed by the\r\nsummit. Given the need for urgent renovation and the\r\nneed to make the Headquarters in New York safe, we\r\nneed agreement on a comprehensive capital master\r\nplan during this session.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to thank the\r\nSecretary-General and all the staff for the work they\r\nhave done this year, often in difficult and dangerous\r\ncircumstances. We hope that the actions and decisions\r\nwe take here in the General Assembly to follow up on\r\nour collective decisions at the summit will strengthen\r\nthe Organization and enable it to achieve its objectives\r\nmore fully. If that happens, this year will indeed mark a\r\nmilestone in the history of the United Nations.\r\nMrs. Holguín (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): I\r\nwish to express our best wishes to you, Sir, in your\r\nendeavours as President of the sixtieth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. We thank the Secretary-General for\r\nthe presentation of his report. Once again, the report\r\nillustrates the Organization’s enormous responsibility\r\nin responding to thousands of people who see in it the\r\npossibility of improving their level of development,\r\nwell-being and respect for their rights, along with the\r\nOrganization’s important contribution to peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nWe support the statement made by the\r\nAmbassador of Jamaica on behalf of the Group of 77\r\nand China. Allow me, instead of discussing reform, to\r\nfocus on the subject of the Colombia as mentioned in\r\nthe report. Colombia wishes to highlight the work of\r\nthe United Nations in our country and the assistance\r\nthe United Nations has provided. We are a country that\r\nbelieves in the assistance of the United Nations, and\r\nwe demonstrate our faith through our openness,\r\ngenerosity and transparency with the Organization. We\r\nare grateful to the Secretary-General for his efforts to\r\npromote peace in Colombia.\r\nColombia is a country with a complex reality, not\r\nalways easy to understand, where every Colombian\r\nfamily has suffered in one way or another from the\r\nrepercussions of violence. As a country, we are\r\nconvinced that only we can find solutions to our\r\nproblems. The Colombian people have risen against\r\nadversity. We are people that do not give up or fall\r\nvictim to intimidation.\r\nProgress made in reducing violence in Colombia\r\nhas been significant and the world acknowledges that.\r\nThe Colombian Government has devoted great efforts\r\nto ensuring that the Colombian people can live without\r\nfear of kidnapping, massacre or attacks by violent\r\ngroups. We have improved, but we still have a long\r\nroad to travel in order that Colombians may one day\r\nlive in peace and without fear.\r\nIn paragraphs 27, 149 and 156 of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report, there are inaccuracies in references to\r\nthe situation in Colombia. The report states that the\r\nsituation has not improved. That is far from the truth.\r\nConcerning displacement, once again we face the\r\nproblem of differences between United Nations figures\r\nand the official figures, which reflect the real numbers.\r\nWhile the report speaks of two million displaced, the\r\nofficial figures show one and a half million.\r\nColombia has a comprehensive programme of\r\nassistance for displaced persons and is conscious of the\r\nwork it needs to do in order to meet the needs of its\r\npeople. Colombia has been making progress, as is\r\nevidenced by the improvements of recent years. In\r\n2004, displacement decreased by 29 per cent in\r\ncomparison with 2003. This is insufficient, and the\r\nGovernment knows that, but the result is positive.\r\nVoluntary return is taking place in strict accordance\r\nwith the principles of security and dignity and is one of\r\nthe Government’s priorities, in which it has invested\r\nmore than $400 million during the past year in\r\nassistance to displaced persons. We should remember\r\nthat Colombia is one of the few countries in the world\r\nthat has incorporated the guidelines on displacement\r\ninto its national legislation.\r\nThe report states that violence has increased,\r\nespecially against the indigenous population. The\r\nfigures and facts show the opposite. Between 2003 and\r\n2004, attacks against indigenous populations were\r\nreduced by 59 per cent. Between 2004 and now, they\r\nhave decreased by an additional 55 per cent. Granted,\r\nthis is insufficient, but it is positive.\r\nThe Government of Colombia has concentrated\r\nits efforts on protecting the lives and physical integrity\r\nof people threatened by the criminal acts of illegal\r\narmed groups, groups that are financed by the drug\r\ntrade.\r\nWe would like to request the Secretariat to review\r\nthe data and assertions contained in the three\r\nparagraphs that mention Colombia and to recognize the\r\npositive improvements that Colombia has made during\r\nrecent years. It is important to recognize the efforts of\r\n10\r\nA/60/PV.24\r\nStates and their capacity to meet the needs of their\r\npeople.\r\nWe find it important to highlight the 2004 report\r\nof the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB),\r\nwhich recognizes the significant achievements made in\r\nColombia and South America in the fight against the\r\nglobal problem of illicit drugs. For the third\r\nconsecutive year, the total area used for growing\r\ncocaine crops has been reduced. Regional and bilateral\r\ncooperation efforts have been strengthened. There has\r\nbeen an increase in drug seizures and in the capture of\r\ncriminals involved in drug trafficking. It is a shame\r\nthat the Secretary-General’s report does not mention\r\nthese accomplishments. In my country, drug trafficking\r\nis the main source of the financing of violence.\r\nLikewise, the INCB report stresses once again\r\nhow illicit drug traffic has links to organized crime.\r\nFor this reason, it is very important for the United\r\nNations and the entire world to recognize what is stated\r\nin paragraph 69 of the Secretary-General’s report,\r\n“... the increasing links between terrorism and drug\r\ntrafficking ...” We believe that by fighting transnational\r\norganized crime, which includes the global problem of\r\nillicit drugs, we are also fighting the financial sources\r\nof terrorism.\r\nWe wonder how many countries could redirect\r\nthe funds they channel towards combating terrorism,\r\ncrime and narcotics and use it for development and the\r\nimprovement of its people. In this regard, we would\r\nlike to recognize the work of the United Nations Office\r\non Drugs and Crime, which cooperates with Member\r\nStates through direct technical assistance to put into\r\npractice international standards on combating money\r\nlaundering and the financing of terrorism. This Office\r\nis visionary in promoting programmes of alternative\r\ncrops in support of programmes for the complete\r\neradication of illicit drugs. Likewise, we would like to\r\nrecognize the efforts of the Counter-Terrorism\r\nCommittee Executive Directorate.\r\nTo conclude, I would like to state that the\r\nchallenges of today’s world, instead of leading us to\r\ncharacterize and judge, should bring us together to\r\ncooperate and unite our best efforts and resources in\r\norder to overcome those challenges and achieve the\r\nwell-being that we dream for our peoples.\r\nMr. Denisov (Russian Federation) (spoke in\r\nRussian): The Secretary-General correctly notes in his\r\nreport on the work of the Organization that the United\r\nNations, despite its imperfections, embodies the hope\r\nof the mankind for a peaceful and just world order. The\r\nUnited Nations, the most representative\r\nintergovernmental body with a universal mandate,\r\ncontinues to play an indispensable coordinating role in\r\nglobal affairs.\r\nLast year, a record number of peacekeepers were\r\nsent to the regions where there are still many conflicts.\r\nThe United Nations focused considerable effort on\r\npromoting sustainable development, including the\r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals\r\nand the search for responses to global threats and\r\nchallenges, such as natural disasters, pandemics of new\r\ndiseases, eradication of poverty, and so forth.\r\nWe have participated in heated discussions on the\r\nrole of the Organization in today’s world. The 2005\r\nWorld Summit outcome document, despite difficult\r\nconsultations on the draft, confirmed that the members\r\nof the international community share views on today’s\r\nkey issues. It was exceptionally important that world\r\nleaders reaffirmed their commitment to ensuring\r\ninternational security on the basis of a comprehensive\r\ncollective approach, including military, political,\r\neconomic, humanitarian and human rights aspects, and\r\nin strict compliance with the Charter of the United\r\nNations.\r\nSpeaking at the High-level Plenary Meeting of\r\nthe General Assembly (see A/60/PV.5), Russian\r\nPresident Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin stressed the\r\nneed to address United Nations issues with utmost care\r\nwhile persistently and patiently continuing the process\r\nof the reform of the Organization. The outcome\r\ndocument (resolution 60/1) is a broadly acceptable\r\nbasis for further concerted action to enhance the\r\neffectiveness of the United Nations as the central\r\nmultilateral institution.\r\nThe summit failed to reach final decisions on all\r\nquestions. In many areas work will go on. One of the\r\nnear-term priorities in this work is the creation of the\r\nPeacebuilding Commission, which should help the\r\nSecurity Council and, if necessary, other United\r\nNations bodies too, in their efforts to ensure the swift\r\nrecovery of countries emerging from crisis and to\r\ncreate guarantees that these conflicts will not be\r\nresumed.\r\nThere is much to be done in the area of promoting\r\nsustainable development and the eradication of\r\npoverty, epidemics, hunger and illiteracy. The summit\r\n11\r\nA/60/PV.24\r\nendorsed a large-scale programme for achieving the\r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs); Russia\r\nsupports initiatives that seek to attain the Goals and\r\nwill continue to make a contribution towards resolving\r\nthese pressing questions.\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General regarding\r\nthe importance of endeavours to achieve the MDGs in\r\nthe context of a broader development agenda based on\r\nthe integration of economic, social and environmental\r\ngoals, in accordance with the decisions taken by\r\nlandmark United Nations conferences and summits. We\r\nsupport the steps taken by the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil in this area. We share the report’s objective of\r\nenhancing the effectiveness of United Nations\r\nparticipation in implementation of the Monterrey\r\nConsensus, inter alia through continuing the practice of\r\nannual meetings between the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil, the Bretton Woods institutions, the World\r\nTrade Organization and the United Nations Conference\r\non Trade and Development, and through the High-level\r\nDialogue on Financing for Development.\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General’s conclusion\r\nregarding the need to increase the Organization’s\r\ncounter-terrorism efforts. We believe that the United\r\nNations, and the Security Council, should become a\r\nheadquarters for combating international terrorism.\r\nRussia is prepared to continue to promote the\r\nstrengthening of the central role of the United Nations\r\nin this area. An important new step was taken with the\r\nadoption, at the 14 September Security Council\r\nsummit, of Council resolution 1624 (2005). Now, not\r\njust terrorists, their accomplices and financial backers,\r\nbut also those who instigate terrorist acts, have been\r\nproclaimed outlaws. This Security Council decision\r\nshould put an end to attempts to use the mass media to\r\nspread terrorist ideas and to justify terrorism. We echo\r\nthe appeal of the Secretary-General to make every\r\neffort to agree as soon as possible on a draft\r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism.\r\nWe think that, if the political will is there, this\r\nchallenge can be met at this session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nThe outcome document stresses that priority\r\nattention should also be given to formulating a\r\ncomprehensive counter-terrorism strategy, which\r\nshould become one of the main building blocks of the\r\ncollective security system. The five elements proposed\r\nby the Secretary-General for this strategy require\r\nthorough discussion and some clarification. A difficult\r\nstage lies ahead when Member States come to\r\nfinalizing the concept. Moreover, we cannot postpone\r\nthe creation of a consolidated sanctions list of terrorists\r\nand terrorist organizations, regardless of whether or not\r\nthey are associated with Al-Qaida or the Taliban.\r\nWork needs to be continued on improving the\r\narsenal of United Nations human rights instruments.\r\nFor Russia, respect for human rights is of great\r\nimportance, and that is why we supported the idea of\r\nestablishing the Human Rights Council. At the same\r\ntime, as rightly noted in the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, the reaction to this proposal to establish a new\r\nhuman rights body reflected a broad range of views.\r\nThat was apparent also during the talks leading up to\r\nthe summit. Accordingly, it is vital to act on the\r\ninitiative of a number of countries, including Russia, to\r\nset up an open-ended working group to formulate the\r\nmain parameters of this future Council during the\r\nsixtieth session of the General Assembly, on the basis\r\nof the principles of transparency, non-selectivity and\r\ndue regard for the views of all Member States.\r\nWe support the efforts to ensure the protection of\r\ncivilians in armed conflicts. However, we believe that\r\nthe wording of the relevant sections of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report should have been given more\r\nresponsible consideration, with due regard to the fact\r\nthat conflict situations should be described on the sole\r\nbasis of the provisions of the Geneva Conventions and\r\ntheir Additional Protocols. In this context, we would\r\nlike to stress again the need to use the correct\r\ngeographical names.\r\nUnited Nations multilateral mechanisms should\r\nplay a leading role also in resolving questions of\r\ndisarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of\r\nmass destruction, on the basis of strict compliance with\r\nthe international conventions in this area. The lack of\r\nany substantive section on this issue in the outcome\r\ndocument is a vivid reflection of the differences of\r\nview that still exist. However, it is to the credit of the\r\nUnited Nations that Security Council resolution 1540\r\n(2004) and the International Convention for the\r\nSuppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism were\r\nadopted. Their implementation would help prevent\r\nweapons of mass destruction from falling into the\r\nhands of terrorists.\r\nToday, it is becoming particularly urgent to\r\nprevent an arms race in outer space. The time has come\r\nto develop transparency and build confidence in\r\n12\r\nA/60/PV.24\r\nmatters related to outer space. During the current\r\nsession of the General Assembly Russia will be putting\r\nforward some initiatives on the subject.\r\nWe attach exceptional importance to improving\r\nthe management of the Organization. The summit\r\noutcome aims to ensure the effective functioning of the\r\nSecretariat. We need to have in our hands real tools for\r\nassessing the work of the Secretariat in accordance\r\nwith the priorities set by the Member States. We look\r\nforward to concrete proposals from the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on how to create a well-organized and efficient\r\nsystem that ensures accountability on the part of the\r\nSecretariat, as well as other recommendations called\r\nfor in the outcome document. The proposals of the\r\nSecretary-General must be considered in accordance\r\nwith established procedures in the General Assembly.\r\nThe Russian Federation will participate actively\r\nand constructively in collective efforts to act on\r\ndecisions approved by world leaders and goals\r\nidentified by them, including on further reform of the\r\nOrganization. This work has to go on in an open and\r\ntransparent manner, without artificially imposed\r\ndeadlines for decision-making. It is crucial to ensure\r\nthe broadest possible agreement, and, ideally, to have\r\nconsensus on key issues of reforming and\r\nstrengthening the United Nations, which will to a large\r\nextent determine our common ability to manage\r\nprocesses that are occurring throughout the world in\r\nthis era of globalization, as well as our capacity to\r\ncounter effectively the attendant threats and challenges.\r\nWe are convinced that there is no alternative to this\r\napproach.\r\nMr. De Rivero (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): For\r\nobvious reasons having to do with its drafting and\r\npublication deadlines, the Secretary-General’s report\r\n(A/60/1) does not make any judgements on the outcome\r\nof the greatest summit of world nations ever convened\r\nat United Nations Headquarters. My delegation\r\ntherefore believes that the Assembly is right, as it\r\ndiscusses the report of the Secretary-General, to refer\r\nanalytically to the summit outcome, since the rushed\r\ndeadlines and high-pressure atmosphere involved in\r\nobtaining a final document did not make it possible to\r\ncalmly assess the results of the High-level Meeting.\r\nIn general, what is stressed by the news media —\r\nwhich shape world public opinion — is that the\r\nsummit’s results fell short of expectations. They are\r\nnot wrong. Indeed, the outcome document does fall\r\nshort of the reform proposals set out by the High-level\r\nPanel on Threats, Challenges and Change and by the\r\nSecretary-General. What is important now is to ask\r\nourselves: why did that happen?\r\nThe truth is that the reform proposals were\r\nextremely interesting, but also extremely ambitious,\r\ngiven the political realities of a world that is\r\nglobalizing but, at the same time, fragmenting. Today\r\nthe world is being globally integrated by trade,\r\nfinancial flows and the digital telecommunications\r\nrevolution but, at the same time, is culturally\r\nfragmenting as a result of differing perceptions of what\r\ninternational security is, of how to achieve\r\ndevelopment and, above all, of the relationship\r\nbetween human rights and the State.\r\nThis cultural fragmentation is also reflected\r\nwithin the United Nations. The Members of the\r\nOrganization have differing perceptions of those\r\nissues. The only common denominator uniting them is,\r\nin the last analysis, the literal interpretation of the\r\nCharter.\r\nIn fact, there is no one concept of international\r\nsecurity that is shared by United Nations Member\r\nStates. For some, international security involves a\r\nmainly strategic and military approach; for others,\r\ninternational security has essential socio-economic\r\ncomponents; and for still others, security includes the\r\nnew concept of human security.\r\nNor do Member States share the same concept of\r\ndevelopment. Some States confuse development with\r\nthe minimal expectations of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals and believe that halving extreme\r\npoverty is a Development Goal that can be achieved\r\nthrough international assistance. Other States believe\r\nthat development is achieved more through trade than\r\nthrough assistance. Still other States — those very few\r\nthat have experience because they have made progress\r\ntowards development — believe that development\r\ninvolves a genuine scientific-technological revolution\r\nthat will liberate countries from basic, low-technology\r\nproduction and exportation.\r\nNor do Member States of the Organization share\r\nthe same cultural concept of human rights, democracy\r\nor the State. Although United Nations resolutions state\r\nthat human rights are indivisible, the truth is that, for\r\nsome States, human rights are essentially civil and\r\npolitical rights, whereas for others, basic human rights\r\nare economic, social and cultural rights. For many\r\n13\r\nA/60/PV.24\r\ncountries, the State is the supreme value; for others, the\r\nState is merely a servant of the citizen. Finally, there\r\nare countries that believe that religion and the State\r\nmust be totally separate, while others do not accept\r\nsuch separation.\r\nGiven those differing cultural perceptions, the\r\nreform proposals were extremely ambitious. To\r\napprove them, the majority of Member States would\r\nhave had to share the same cultural perceptions of\r\ninternational security, development, the State and\r\nhuman rights. That is the main reason why the outcome\r\nfell short of expectations. The interesting and\r\nambitious reform proposals did not take into account\r\nthe cultural fragmentation that exists today despite\r\nglobalization.\r\nNotwithstanding that poor outcome, some\r\nreforms survived without much substance, such as the\r\nresponsibility to protect, the Human Rights Council,\r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission and the Democracy\r\nFund. We must work on those issues in the future and,\r\nabove all, reactivate the Millennium Development\r\nGoals.\r\nUndoubtedly, where the outcome document fell\r\nshort of all the expectations of the media and of the\r\nentire international community was in the area of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. Demonstrating that is\r\nthe fact that the Human Development Report 2005,\r\nissued almost at the end of the outcome document\r\nnegotiations, stated that the main Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals were not being implemented and\r\ncalled for a programme of action to achieve them.\r\nDespite that, the outcome document did not take the\r\nHuman Development Report’s warning into account.\r\nThus, it does not establish any effective action plan for\r\nreactivating the Millennium Development Goals. That\r\nis one of the most disillusioning and disturbing results\r\nof the outcome document.\r\nThat is disturbing because the main Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goal — halving extreme poverty by\r\n2015 — is only a minimalist Goal, a kind of damage\r\ncontrol. Reducing extreme poverty is not the same\r\nthing as making progress towards development.\r\nDevelopment is much more than reducing extreme\r\npoverty; it involves a technological revolution, the\r\ncreation of a middle class and the rule of law.\r\nThe experience of this truncated reform, which\r\nhas had negative repercussions on the image of the\r\nUnited Nations, should serve to convince us that the\r\nUnited Nations is not easy to reform, especially\r\nthrough ambitious proposals and revolutionary change,\r\nhowever rational they may be. Where we do need to be\r\nambitious is in reforming the Secretariat’s functioning.\r\nSuch reform can be accomplished swiftly. In contrast,\r\nwhen it comes to political reform, we should not be so\r\nambitious. From now on, we must think of the Charter\r\nas, politically, the lowest common denominator uniting\r\nus in a world that is globalizing but culturally\r\nfragmenting — a world where there are no common\r\nstrategic, political, economic or cultural perceptions.\r\nThe key word for political reform of the United\r\nNations is “prudence”, because our failure to reform\r\nwill only create a bad image that will give ammunition\r\nto the Organization’s enemies. United Nations reform\r\nmust be carried out realistically — that is to say,\r\nincrementally. Evolution, more than revolution, is what\r\nwe need in the future.\r\nAt the end of the day, the United Nations\r\ncontinues to be the essential multilateral world\r\nOrganization. However much cultural fragmentation\r\nmay exist, the United Nations is the only institution in\r\nwhich we can face the major challenges of the twenty-\r\nfirst century, from infectious diseases to the collapse of\r\nStates, from terrorism to climate change. It is the only\r\nlegitimate instrument of global governance that we\r\nhave. Therefore, we must persist in striving more\r\ndiligently to identify what unites us, because the trend\r\ntowards cultural fragmentation in a globalized world is\r\nthe great challenge facing our institution.\r\nMr. Kumalo (South Africa): Let me begin, Sir,\r\nby expressing my delegation’s appreciation of your\r\nwork as President of the sixtieth session of the General\r\nAssembly. We are indeed privileged to have a person\r\nwith your leadership skills guiding our work.\r\nWe also wish to thank the Secretary-General for\r\nhis report on the work of the Organization (A/60/1).\r\nThe report shows that, 60 years after it was created, the\r\nUnited Nations continues to undertake important work\r\nin many fields touching the lives of ordinary people in\r\nmany different parts of the world. For that reason, we\r\nassociate ourselves with the statement made by\r\nJamaica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nOur present debate is timely, following the 2005\r\nworld summit, where heads of State or Government\r\nreviewed progress made since the adoption of the\r\nMillennium Declaration. The summit recognized the\r\ninterlinked threats and challenges that face the world\r\n14\r\nA/60/PV.24\r\ntoday, the need for concrete action on development,\r\nsecurity and human rights and the critical need for\r\ninstitutional reform. The summit reaffirmed the\r\nimportance of the United Nations as a central part of\r\nthe system of global governance required to address\r\nthe challenges facing the world today. It also showed,\r\nhowever, that there is an urgent need for the\r\nOrganization to be reformed and revitalized to reflect\r\ntoday’s global realities if it is to be empowered to\r\naddress the threats and challenges we now face.\r\nWe believe that the challenge for the sixtieth\r\nsession is, therefore, to focus on the implementation of\r\nthe 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1). We\r\nneed to maintain the momentum of the summit and\r\nensure that we meet the mandates agreed upon by our\r\nheads of State or Government. It is important that the\r\npolitical momentum for development generated by the\r\nsummit be maintained. The summit outcome and the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General show that many\r\ncountries still face major obstacles in their efforts to\r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nFurthermore, the review has shown that many of the\r\ncountries that are not on track to meet the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals are in Africa. We are therefore\r\npleased that the summit proposed specific actions that\r\nneed to be undertaken to address the special needs of\r\nAfrica.\r\nThe major United Nations conferences and\r\nsummits of the past decade that focused on the\r\neconomic and social fields played an important role in\r\ngalvanizing support for development. We would have\r\npreferred it if the international community had used the\r\nopportunity provided by the recently concluded world\r\nsummit to commit to the full implementation of all the\r\noutcomes of the past conferences and summits, in\r\nparticular the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, the Monterrey Conference on Financing\r\nfor Development and the World Conference against\r\nRacism. We hope that the fact that the outcome\r\ndocument was not definitive on this matter does not\r\nprovide a loophole for those who choose to have\r\nselective amnesia about our long-standing\r\ncommitments.\r\nDuring the past year, we also had an opportunity\r\nto review the implementation of the Copenhagen and\r\nBeijing conferences. We welcome the reaffirmation by\r\nour Governments of their will and commitment to\r\ncontinue implementing the Copenhagen Declaration\r\nand the Programme of Action, in particular to eradicate\r\npoverty, promote full and productive employment and\r\nfoster social integration to achieve stable, safe and just\r\nsocieties for all. The implementation of the\r\nCopenhagen commitments and the achievement of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals should be viewed as\r\nmutually reinforcing. It was in that same context that\r\nan annual draft resolution on the implementation of the\r\nsocial objectives of the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment was introduced by the Group of 77 and\r\nChina in the agenda of the Commission for Social\r\nDevelopment.\r\nGender equality and women’s empowerment are\r\nessential components of the achievement of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. Without women’s\r\nequal access to and full participation in power\r\nstructures and decision-making, the goals of gender\r\nbalance and equality, development and peace cannot be\r\nachieved. It is therefore unfortunate that the summit\r\noutcome document did not contain a stronger\r\nreaffirmation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform\r\nfor Action and the outcome of the twenty-third special\r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nOne of the important decisions of the summit was\r\nthat the Peacebuilding Commission should be\r\nestablished and be made operational by the end of\r\nDecember 2005. The report of the Secretary-General\r\ndemonstrates the importance of the work of the United\r\nNations in conflict prevention and peacemaking. We\r\nbelieve that the Peacebuilding Commission will be\r\ncrucial in supporting those efforts, so that the\r\ninternational community will have a long-term\r\nperspective on post-conflict reconstruction and\r\ndevelopment. We call on Member States to reach an\r\nagreement as soon as possible to make the\r\nPeacebuilding Commission operational.\r\nThe summit also reaffirmed the importance of\r\nhuman rights, democracy and the rule of law. South\r\nAfrica will work constructively with other delegations\r\nto ensure that the Human Rights Council is established\r\nduring the current session of the General Assembly. As\r\nmy delegation has always stated, all human rights —\r\nincluding the right to development — are important\r\nboth to the poor and to the rich, the developing and the\r\ndeveloped countries. For the Human Rights Council to\r\nbe effective it will have to be different from the\r\nCommission on Human Rights and avoid politicization\r\nthrough selectivity and double standards. We believe\r\nthat it is indeed possible to form a body that can earn\r\nthe confidence of all Member States.\r\n15\r\nA/60/PV.24\r\nWith regard to disarmament and non-proliferation\r\nissues, we have witnessed a succession of setbacks\r\nbeginning with the failures of the United Nations\r\nDisarmament Commission and the Review Conference\r\nof States Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation\r\nof Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Recently, the summit\r\noutcome document also failed to propose a way\r\nforward on these issues. Nonetheless, those obstacles\r\nshould in no way weaken our resolve to work towards\r\nthe full implementation of all obligations,\r\ncommitments and undertakings made at previous NPT\r\nReview Conferences.\r\nSouth Africa continues to be concerned about the\r\nthreat posed by weapons of mass destruction, not only\r\nto individual States, but also to the international\r\ncommunity as whole. Regrettably, current endeavours\r\nto address those concerns continue to be characterized\r\nby actions that paralyse the multilateral instruments\r\nestablished to address them. South Africa believes that\r\nthe only effective way of addressing those concerns is\r\nthrough the established instruments in the field of\r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation. Universal\r\nadherence to, full implementation of and compliance\r\nwith those international agreements and the complete\r\nelimination of all weapons of mass destruction\r\nconstitute the only guarantee against the threat or use\r\nof those weapons.\r\nWhile the Conference on Disarmament continues\r\nto demonstrate its inability to begin negotiations, and\r\nthe entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-\r\nTest-Ban Treaty continues to be delayed owing to non-\r\nratification by States required to do so, South Africa\r\nstill views those disarmament measures as a way to\r\naccomplish the goal of nuclear disarmament and\r\nnuclear non-proliferation.\r\nSouth Africa welcomes the conclusion of the\r\nwork of the Open-ended Working Group to negotiate\r\nan International Instrument to Enable States to Identify\r\nand Trace in a Timely and Reliable Manner Illicit\r\nSmall Arms and Light Weapons. My delegation\r\nattaches great importance to the United Nations\r\nProgramme of Action on Small Arms and calls for the\r\nearly implementation of that instrument.\r\nWith regard to the issue of anti-personnel\r\nlandmines, South Africa attaches great importance to\r\nstrong regional, subregional and national\r\ncommitments. The Common African Position on Anti-\r\nPersonnel Landmines is a powerful message of the\r\npriority that the African region attaches to the\r\nimplementation of those issues.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General demonstrates\r\nthat the capacity of the United Nations is enhanced by\r\nits cooperation with regional organizations. Regional\r\norganizations, such as the African Union, have shown\r\ntheir commitment to resolving long-standing conflicts.\r\nWe also recognize that the activities of regional\r\norganizations are sometimes limited by the lack of\r\nresources and logistical capabilities. It was for that\r\nreason that South Africa supported the proposal that\r\nthe General Assembly consider financing some of\r\nthose operations from the regular budget on an\r\nexceptional basis, and we regret that this could not be\r\nagreed. We would also like to emphasize that the\r\nincreased role of regional organizations should not\r\nabsolve the United Nations of its Charter responsibility\r\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nThe Secretariat in recent months has faced\r\nnumerous calls for greater efficiency, improved\r\naccountability and better management. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral has instituted several measures aimed at\r\nreforming the Organization, enhancing the safety of its\r\nstaff, and making it more responsive to the entire\r\nmembership. We recognize those efforts and reiterate\r\nour commitment to ensuring that reform will culminate\r\nin a strengthened United Nations. At the same time,\r\nhowever, we believe that it is imperative that Member\r\nStates also acknowledge that we have a responsibility\r\nto ensure that the Organization receives adequate\r\nresources to implement the increasing number of\r\nmandates assigned to it and to enable it to meet the\r\nchallenges effectively and efficiently.\r\nWe further believe that, during the sixtieth\r\nsession, we should recommit ourselves to our Charter\r\nobligation to bear the financial expenses of the United\r\nNations and to paying our assessments in full, on time\r\nand without condition. We note from the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report that the Organization in 2005 faced\r\ncash shortages in several active peacekeeping\r\noperations, the International Tribunals and the regular\r\nbudget, due to non-payment of assessed contributions,\r\nwhich were threatening the viability of those\r\noperations. That dire financial situation is regrettably\r\nalso making it unfeasible for the United Nations to\r\nmeet its obligation to reimburse troop-contributing\r\ncountries and to return credits to Member States. Only\r\nthrough our collective action will we be able to break\r\nthat vicious cycle.\r\n16\r\nA/60/PV.24\r\nIn closing, Sir, we look forward to your\r\nleadership and guidance on how we are to follow up on\r\nthe implementation of the outcome document. We wish\r\nto assure you that our delegation is ready to give you\r\nall the support that you may need.\r\nMrs. Laohaphan (Thailand): As I am taking the\r\nfloor for the first time, allow me to extend my warmest\r\ncongratulations to you, Sir, on having been elected to\r\nyour important post. My delegation has full confidence\r\nin your leadership and stands ready to work closely\r\nwith you and other members of the Bureau.\r\nI also wish to take this opportunity to express my\r\nappreciation to Mr. Jean Ping, the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. Having\r\nserved as one of his facilitators during the consultation\r\nprocess for the outcome of the summit, I have come to\r\ngenuinely appreciate President Ping’s leadership,\r\ncourage and integrity.\r\nLet me begin by thanking the Secretary-General\r\nfor his comprehensive report on the work of the\r\nOrganization, as contained in document A/60/1. I also\r\nthank him for his tireless efforts in strengthening the\r\nwork of the United Nations, both at Headquarters and\r\nin the field. I also wish at the outset to pay tribute to\r\nthe men and women who are serving the noble cause of\r\nthe Organization in all corners of the world.\r\nThis past year, we have many reasons to be\r\nthankful: the end of the North-South conflict in Sudan,\r\ndemocratic elections in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the\r\nrecent commitments on official development assistance\r\nand debt cancellation by the European Union and the\r\nG-8, to name but a few.\r\nYet, at the same time, many situations remain to\r\nbe resolved: the increasing threat of terrorism; the\r\nprevalence of such infectious diseases as HIV/AIDS,\r\nmalaria and bird flu; and the unprecedented\r\noccurrences of natural disasters affecting people both\r\nin the North and the South. Now more than ever, the\r\nUnited Nations is called upon to act.\r\nThroughout the last session of the General\r\nAssembly, we spent most of our time discussing how to\r\nbring changes to the Organization to enable it to\r\nrespond more effectively to the challenges of our time.\r\nLess than two weeks ago, our leaders adopted the\r\noutcome document of the summit, the result of our year\r\nof hard work and long days and nights of discussions.\r\nWe should spare no effort in translating those words\r\ninto actions. While Member States are committed to\r\ndoing our part, I was also heartened to hear from the\r\nSecretary-General at the opening of the general debate\r\nthat he intended to follow through on every action\r\nasked of him, and he asked Member States to pledge to\r\nan accountability pact to live up to what the summit\r\noutcome requires of us. My delegation supports the\r\nSecretary-General in upholding that accountability pact\r\nand we will work actively at the national, bilateral,\r\nregional and international levels to ensure the effective\r\nimplementation of the summit outcome, and in\r\nparticular to make our best efforts to enable all\r\ncountries to achieve the Millennium Development\r\nGoals by 2015.\r\nLooking at the report of the Organization\r\nprepared by the Secretary-General, we should ask\r\nourselves in all fairness whether we are asking too\r\nmuch of the United Nations. The United Nations is\r\nasked to maintain peace and security, to promote\r\nhuman rights, to meet humanitarian commitments, and\r\nto develop and uphold the international legal order.\r\nNone of those tasks will be easily accomplished.\r\nIn that regard, I wish to reiterate the point I made\r\nlast year in this Hall that we must provide the United\r\nNations with timely and adequate tools and resources\r\nto perform its work efficiently. With approximately\r\n70,000 peacekeepers deployed worldwide, the United\r\nNations needs tremendous resources to build and\r\nmaintain peace. With hunger, famine and starvation\r\nprevalent in all corners of the world, notably in Africa,\r\nthe United Nations task is simply enormous. With\r\nnatural disasters that have proved to be as threatening\r\nas man-made ones — including here in the United\r\nStates, where we have witnessed the plight and\r\nsuffering of the victims of Hurricane Katrina — the\r\nUnited Nations role and involvement are increasingly\r\ncalled for.\r\nCertainly, the United Nations cannot accomplish\r\nall those tasks without sufficient resources. Member\r\nStates need to pay their contribution in full and without\r\ndelay. Voluntary contributions should also be increased\r\nand, where possible, not earmarked.\r\nWhile the work of the United Nations is\r\nobviously enormous and far-reaching, my delegation\r\nwishes to highlight specifically our concern over the\r\nincidence and severity of natural disasters and the\r\nextent to which they come to affect our lives. The\r\nSecretary-General’s report cites dramatic figures\r\n17\r\nA/60/PV.24\r\nconcerning the victims of natural disasters. During the\r\nperiod from April 2004 to April 2005, 246,000 people\r\nwere killed by natural disasters and 157 million were\r\ninjured, displaced or adversely affected. An estimated\r\n$100 billion-worth of property damage also occurred.\r\nThat is an upward and quite discomforting trend.\r\nMr. Diarra (Mali), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nHaving been hit by the Indian Ocean tsunami last\r\nDecember, Thailand fully understands the plight of the\r\nvictims of these natural disasters and believes that\r\nmore must be done to enhance preventive measures and\r\nto strengthen our efforts in disaster management, as\r\nwell as in recovery, rehabilitation and development in\r\nthe post-disaster phase. The United Nations Office for\r\nthe Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)\r\nneeds to be strengthened. United Nations agencies and\r\nprogrammes involved need to be coordinated so that\r\nthey can respond more efficiently to natural disasters\r\nand avoid duplicating work and overlapping in the use\r\nof resources.\r\nIn this regard, we are pleased to see that the\r\nsummit outcome (resolution 60/1) urged support for\r\nthe efforts of countries, and developing countries in\r\nparticular, to strengthen their capacities at all levels in\r\norder to prepare for and respond rapidly to natural\r\ndisasters and to mitigate their impact. We hope that this\r\nexpression of support will be translated into concrete\r\nactions and measures at the national, regional and\r\ninternational levels. Likewise, we support improving\r\nthe Central Emergency Revolving Fund and the use of\r\nemergency standby capacities, under the auspices of\r\nthe United Nations, for a timely response to\r\nhumanitarian emergencies.\r\nThe year ahead of us will be an exciting one. Our\r\nleaders have asked us to try to reach agreement during\r\nthis session of the General Assembly to conclude a\r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism.\r\nWhile the matter has long been on the table, we are\r\nnow working with a sense of urgency and commitment\r\ntowards ridding the world of terrorist acts. My\r\ndelegation anticipates that we can all put our\r\ndifferences behind us and work actively in a spirit of\r\ncooperation towards this common goal.\r\nMy delegation also looks forward to further\r\ndiscussion during this session of the General Assembly\r\non how to strengthen the work of the United Nations.\r\nOver the coming year, under the guidance of the\r\nPresident, my delegation hopes that we will be able to\r\nrealize our many aspirations for institutional reform.\r\nThe Peacebuilding Commission, when set up, will help\r\nto ensure effective peacebuilding and sustainable\r\npeace, and, over the long run, it will save tremendous\r\ncosts in peacekeeping operations. The Human Rights\r\nCouncil, we hope, will address the problem of\r\npoliticization that has long been embedded within the\r\nCommission on Human Rights.\r\nLast but not least, Secretariat and management\r\nreform will be instrumental in guiding all the work to\r\nbe undertaken. We hope that Member States will work\r\nclosely together with the Secretary-General and the\r\nmanagement to see how we can give flexibility to the\r\nSecretary-General yet, at the same time, ensure that the\r\nviews and concerns of Member States are fully taken\r\ninto consideration. My delegation pledges to render the\r\nPresident our full cooperation and support.\r\nMr. Jenie (Indonesia): Once again we have\r\nassembled to review and discuss the work done by the\r\nUnited Nations over the last year to attain the\r\nobjectives of the Charter. In this regard, I want to\r\nexpress my appreciation for the efforts of the\r\nSecretary-General to provide us with a comprehensive\r\nreport on the work of the Organization (A/60/1).\r\nBefore continuing, allow me first to associate my\r\ndelegation with the statement made by the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Jamaica, who spoke on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report comes after the\r\nhistoric High-level Plenary Meeting of the General\r\nAssembly. One may be inclined to think that there is\r\nnothing important left to be said. But the report of the\r\nSecretary-General indicates otherwise. Therefore, the\r\nreport deserves our full and careful consideration.\r\nBearing that in mind, there are values that must not be\r\ncompromised in any way. Our efforts to maintain\r\ninternational peace and security, to achieve\r\ninternational cooperation in solving global problems\r\nand to promote respect for human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms, without any distinctions, must\r\nremain high on the global agenda.\r\nThe report makes it clear that there are many\r\nsocial, economic and political issues that should\r\nengage our attention as we move forward. Moreover, it\r\nis a timely reminder that there is a larger development\r\nagenda in need of our attention by making reference to\r\nthe many important conferences and summits in the\r\n18\r\nA/60/PV.24\r\neconomic and social fields, the outcomes of which are\r\nyet to be fully implemented.\r\nAgainst this background, the outcomes of major\r\nUnited Nations conferences and summits must be\r\nfaithfully carried out. Financing for development must\r\nflow to developing countries, whose exports must gain\r\naccess to markets based on a universal, rule-based,\r\nopen, non-discriminatory and equitable international\r\ntrading system. The best solution for the problem of\r\ndebt affecting developing countries must be found.\r\nInternational cooperation through partnership on\r\nsustainable development must be enhanced.\r\nAs the report notes, the frequency with which\r\nnatural disasters are occurring and their increasingly\r\ndevastating impact on nations is one area of concern\r\nthat needs our serious attention. In this context,\r\nIndonesia wishes once again to express its gratitude for\r\nthe unprecedented and unswerving support from the\r\ninternational community and United Nations\r\nspecialized agencies in the aftermath of the tsunami\r\nlast December. Indonesia looks forward to the Special\r\nEnvoy for Tsunami Recovery, former President Bill\r\nClinton, playing his essential role; he will maintain\r\nsustained global attention and cooperation in the\r\nprocess of rehabilitation and reconstruction of the\r\naffected areas. I would also like to express my\r\ndelegation’s deepest sympathy on the plight and\r\nsuffering of the victims of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\r\nMoreover, Indonesia fully supports the\r\nimplementation of agreements on global climate\r\nchange, based on the principle of common but\r\ndifferentiated responsibilities. Without a doubt,\r\nstronger efforts must be made to encourage all\r\ncountries to ratify the Kyoto Protocol.\r\nWe share the concern that the disempowerment of\r\nwomen and discrimination against people living with\r\nHIV have led to social exclusion and have contributed\r\nto a worsening of the AIDS epidemic. It is therefore\r\nour common responsibility to address these unfortunate\r\nfacts. We are deeply concerned that the target of\r\nproviding three million people living with HIV/AIDS\r\nin developing and middle-income countries with life-\r\nprolonging antiretroviral treatment by the end of 2005\r\nwill, unfortunately, not be achieved. Extra efforts are\r\nurgently needed to further accelerate the achievement\r\nof the next target.\r\nIn dealing with development, the report makes no\r\nmention of South-South cooperation. Because of its\r\npositive impact on the global development process,\r\nSouth-South cooperation as a complement to North-\r\nSouth cooperation deserves our continued support.\r\nOn the subject of achieving peace and security,\r\nthe report, predictably, identifies both progress and\r\nsetbacks for the United Nations and the world in the\r\nyear under review. In this regard, Indonesia’s foreign\r\npolicy is always to promote peace. Wherever possible,\r\nwe foster dialogue and reconciliation.\r\nIn this same spirit of reconciliation, Indonesia\r\nand Timor-Leste, an important neighbouring State,\r\nhave reached out to each other so that both nations may\r\ntogether bring about closure to a difficult episode in\r\nour shared history. Indonesia and Timor-Leste together\r\nhave established a Truth and Friendship Commission,\r\ndesigned to expose the truth concerning the human\r\nrights violations committed prior to and immediately\r\nafter the popular consultations in Timor-Leste in 1999.\r\nThe Commission started working last August. We\r\nare convinced that this is the way to go because it not\r\nonly seeks the truth, but also supports reconciliation in\r\nfull conformity with the principles on which the\r\nbilateral relationship is being developed, namely,\r\nforward-looking and reconciliatory.\r\nA matter of particular interest to Indonesia is the\r\nreport’s reference to the Indonesian province of Aceh.\r\nIn it, the Secretary-General expresses the hope that the\r\npeace talks between the Government of Indonesia and\r\nthe Free Aceh Movement will succeed. We are pleased\r\nto point out that the Government of Indonesia signed a\r\nfinal peace agreement with the Movement last month,\r\nwhich is now being implemented.\r\nMonitoring mechanisms that involve the\r\nEuropean Union and the Association of Southeast\r\nAsian Nations have been put in place. The\r\ndecommissioning of the armed wing of the Free Aceh\r\nMovement has made significant progress, as has the\r\nwithdrawal of non-organic Indonesian armed forces\r\nfrom the province, in accordance with the peace pact.\r\nPeace and development in Aceh are in fact the fruits of\r\nthe reform and democratization that are pervading all\r\nof Indonesia.\r\nThe report observes that, during the year, new\r\nchallenges and threats heightened international concern\r\nabout weapons of mass destruction, an uncanny\r\npresaging of the High-level Plenary Meeting outcome\r\n19\r\nA/60/PV.24\r\ndocument, which speaks volumes about that subject by\r\nnot saying a word.\r\nMonths before, the Review Conference of the\r\nParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons in May 2005 failed to reach\r\nagreement on any substantive issues, an unfortunate\r\nlandmark which attracted the attention of the\r\nSecretary-General, who notes that a golden opportunity\r\nwas lost to address the most pressing problems of both\r\nnon-proliferation and disarmament more broadly. On\r\nthat point, we are also reminded that the Conference on\r\nDisarmament and the Disarmament Commission\r\nlamentably remain deadlocked, a point that Member\r\nStates must address speedily.\r\nLet me make one more point on peace and\r\nsecurity, because it strongly represents a point in which\r\nwe deeply believe. On the subject of terrorism, the\r\nSecretary-General cautions that no cause or belief\r\njustifies terror and indiscriminate violence against\r\ncivilians. Calling for international cooperation to\r\ndefeat terrorism, he stresses that this menace “is not\r\nthe product of any particular religion or ideology, nor\r\nis it directed only at certain countries or people”\r\n(A/60/1, para. 3). That underlines the imperative of\r\naddressing the root causes of terrorism. We would\r\nrecommend the use of interfaith dialogue and\r\ncooperation as one means of empowering moderates\r\nand as a useful tool to combat terrorism and promote\r\nunderstanding, tolerance and peace in general.\r\nWith regard to the strengthening of the\r\nOrganization, Indonesia looks forward to further\r\ndiscussions on all issues pertaining to management and\r\nSecretariat reform, in accordance with the relevant\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution and within the\r\nappropriate committee. We fully recognize the need for\r\ngreater transparency, accountability and efficiency, but\r\nhope that those changes will not affect the priorities of\r\ndeveloping countries in different fields.\r\nConcerning the staff buy-out, Indonesia is of the\r\nview that more detailed information should be\r\nprovided to justify such action and to indicate what the\r\nlikely costs will be, and we hope that it will not create\r\nimbalances in geographical representation.\r\nMr. Hamidon (Malaysia): Let me begin by\r\nexpressing my delegation’s appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General for his comprehensive and incisive\r\nreport on the work of the Organization, as contained in\r\ndocument A/60/1. My delegation wishes to associate\r\nitself with the statement made by the representative of\r\nJamaica on behalf of the G-77 and China.\r\nOver the last two weeks, this Assembly has been\r\nengaged in the High-level Plenary Meeting and the\r\ngeneral debate, and the world summit has adopted the\r\noutcome document. This is a momentous time that\r\nMember States should seize, and they should not lose\r\nmomentum in bringing about the necessary reform of\r\nthe United Nations. In that regard, I wish to underline\r\nMalaysia’s position that the reform of the United\r\nNations system to enhance its effectiveness must also\r\nlead to the promotion and strengthening of\r\nmultilateralism.\r\nAs described by the Secretary-General in his\r\nreport, this past year has witnessed both progress and\r\nsetbacks for the Organization and the world in many\r\nareas, in particular in the fields of international peace\r\nand security, as well as in international economic\r\ncooperation and development. While we support\r\nadequate attention being given to issues related to\r\ninternational peace and security, we are particularly\r\nconcerned that not much progress has been registered\r\nin the field of international economic cooperation and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nMalaysia feels strongly that special attention\r\nmust be paid to efforts to achieve the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. We are concerned about the fact\r\nthat, at the current rate of progress, the Goals are\r\nexpected to be realized only in 2147, rather than the\r\ninitial target year of 2015. In our efforts to achieve the\r\nMillennium Development Goals, we should continue to\r\nbe mindful of the current as well as the emerging\r\nchallenges facing us. Clearly, the biggest challenges\r\nfacing the developing countries are poverty eradication\r\nand financing for development. There are over one\r\nbillion people — one in every six people around the\r\nworld — who live in extreme poverty, subsisting on\r\nless than $1 a day.\r\nThe situation regarding financing for\r\ndevelopment is equally worrisome, if not critical. More\r\nthan 30 years ago, the richest countries committed\r\nthemselves to providing 0.7 per cent of their gross\r\nnational income as official development assistance,\r\nparticularly for the poorest countries. However, the\r\namount given has amounted to a mere 0.25 per cent of\r\nthe combined gross national income of countries that\r\nare members of the Development Assistance\r\nCommittee of the Organization for Economic\r\n20\r\nA/60/PV.24\r\nCooperation and Development. In that regard,\r\nMalaysia welcomes the adoption by the European\r\nUnion of clear timelines for reaching the 0.7 per cent\r\ntarget.\r\nApart from that, the international financial\r\narchitecture should also be reformed. Eight years ago,\r\nEast Asia was battered by a financial crisis, which in\r\nturn had transregional repercussions threatening the\r\nhealth of the global economy. A current issue that\r\ncould also threaten to imperil the global economy, and\r\nwhich this Organization should address, is the\r\nprolonged and sustained increase in oil prices. That\r\nburden is disproportionately borne by developing\r\ncountries and impoverishing them further. It is\r\nreprehensible that the poor are expected to absorb the\r\ncost of instabilities of production.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report elaborates on\r\nconflict situations in many parts of the world. In that\r\nregard, United Nations peacekeeping operations have\r\ncontinually proven to be an indispensable tool for the\r\nmaintenance of peace and security, in the context of\r\nboth inter-State and intra-State conflicts. The increase\r\nin the number of peacebuilding and peacekeeping\r\nmissions in the past year has also placed greater strain\r\non the Organization’s resources and its capacity to\r\nplan, deploy and manage those missions. My\r\ndelegation would like to urge Member States to\r\npositively respond to the call for sustained political\r\nsupport and for an increase in their financial\r\ncommitment to ensuring the success of those missions.\r\nPeacebuilding is another important component in\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nWe have seen all too clearly in the past that countries\r\nunder stress or recovering from conflict have slid back\r\ninto anarchy and failure. It is in that vein that Malaysia\r\nsupports the establishment of the peacebuilding\r\ncommission, which could play a pivotal role in\r\nassisting countries emerging from conflict in their\r\neconomic development and institution of the rule of\r\nlaw. The peacebuilding commission to be formed\r\nshould be under the aegis of this Assembly and deal\r\nwith post-conflict situations.\r\nNor should the United Nations not lose sight of\r\none long-standing problem which has been confronting\r\nthe Organization since its inception: the question of\r\nPalestine. Malaysia welcomes the Israeli withdrawal\r\nfrom Gaza. But this should be part of the road map\r\nprocess and should be quickly followed by similar\r\nmeasures in the West Bank. Israel should also cease all\r\nsettlement activities, including in and around\r\nJerusalem, as well as the construction of the separation\r\nwall, which has been pronounced illegal by the\r\nInternational Court of Justice. The United Nations\r\nmust remain engaged in efforts for the establishment of\r\nan independent and sovereign Palestinian State with\r\nJerusalem as its capital.\r\nMalaysia condemns terrorism in all its forms and\r\nmanifestations, committed by whomever, wherever and\r\nfor whatever purpose, as it constitutes one of the most\r\nserious threats to international peace and security. We\r\nhave faced and fought terrorism in the past. We were\r\nsuccessful in defeating the terrorist threat, not by the\r\nuse of conventional military force alone, but also by\r\nwinning the hearts and minds of the people. That is\r\nwhy Malaysia has been calling for an understanding of\r\nthe root causes of terrorism so that we can address the\r\nissue more effectively. My delegation also\r\ndistinguishes between acts of terrorism and the right of\r\npeople fighting for self-determination, and holds that\r\nterrorism should not be associated with any particular\r\nrace or religion.\r\nIn our efforts to address the multiplicity of\r\ninternational security threats, we should be reminded\r\nthat the norms and principles of international law\r\nshould not be set aside. The larger membership of the\r\nOrganization has a vital stake in ensuring that those\r\nefforts are undertaken in a collective spirit, ensuring\r\nthe centrality of the multilateral process.\r\nMultilateralism is still the best option for dealing with\r\nthe threats and challenges confronting the world today:\r\nensuring peace and security in relations between\r\nnations, combating terrorism, protecting human rights\r\nand enforcing compliance with international law.\r\nOne issue related to the peace and security\r\nagenda that was conspicuously missing from the\r\nsummit outcome document is disarmament and non-\r\nproliferation. We are deeply concerned, following the\r\nfailure of the May 2005 Review Conference of the\r\nParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) to adopt a final consensus\r\ndocument, that the world summit also failed to adopt\r\neven a single paragraph on disarmament and non-\r\nproliferation. In this regard, the General Assembly\r\nneeds to clearly signal to the wider public that this\r\nbody is seized of this critical issue, as weapons of mass\r\ndestruction pose the greatest threat to human existence.\r\nWe must also bear in mind that we need to address\r\n21\r\nA/60/PV.24\r\nissues of nuclear disarmament, non-proliferation and\r\nthe peaceful uses of nuclear technology — the three\r\npillars of the NPT — in a balanced manner. The\r\nAssembly should also give greater attention to\r\naddressing the threat of the proliferation of small arms\r\nand light weapons.\r\nThe threats and challenges referred to in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report are numerous and\r\nmultifaceted. The summit outcome document, although\r\nfar from perfect, outlines the reforms that this\r\nOrganization could undertake to meet those threats and\r\nchallenges. In order to carry out the reform, we need to\r\nenhance the effective management of and modernize\r\nthe Organization. It is important for Member States to\r\nbear in mind that, without adequate resources, the\r\nprocess will not succeed. The General Assembly, as the\r\nmost representative body of the Organization, must be\r\nat the forefront of the reform process. It must continue\r\nto be empowered and reinvigorated so that it can play a\r\nsubstantive role. It must act as the main deliberative\r\nand policy-making body of the United Nations.\r\nIn addition to calling for the reform of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the summit also called for the\r\nreform of the entire United Nations system. To that\r\nend, we need to be actively engaged in transparent,\r\nconstructive consultations in working towards\r\nacceptable decisions on the establishment of the\r\nHuman Rights Council and the Peacebuilding\r\nCommission, as well as on the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil, the Economic and Social Council and the\r\nSecretariat.\r\nThis is a momentous period for the United\r\nNations. I would like to recall the words of the\r\nPresident, at the closing of the general debate a few\r\ndays ago (see A/60/PV.23), that the coming days and\r\nweeks will determine whether the world summit goes\r\ndown in history as a missed chance for the United\r\nNations or as the start of the most substantial reform\r\nprogramme in the history of the Organization. My\r\ndelegation hopes for the latter, and we fully support\r\nMr. Eliasson in his effort to move the process forward.\r\nMr. Yushkevich (Belarus) (spoke in Russian):\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization (A/60/1), as well as the discussions that\r\ntook place during the recent summit, show once again\r\nthat humankind and our Organization are deeply\r\nconcerned about a number of complex global problems.\r\nCan we explain the lack of significant progress in\r\nresolving such problems by any deficiency in the\r\nhuman intellect? Human beings have plumbed the\r\nmysteries of the world, resolved complex technical\r\nproblems and created virtual worlds, yet people are\r\ncontinuing to die in the real world as a result of hunger,\r\ndisease and violence. This is not so much a question of\r\nour level of knowledge — or even of the reform of the\r\nOrganization — as of the spiritual State of humankind\r\nand its ability to enter a new stage of evolution.\r\nHow can we talk about improvement if we can\r\nreconcile ourselves to such anachronistic phenomena\r\nas neo-slavery and human trafficking? We are\r\nconvinced that such evils cannot be eradicated if there\r\nis still a lucrative market for them. We propose that a\r\nlist be drawn up of the sources of that problem and of\r\npossible mechanisms to eliminate it. Until those who\r\npurchase human beings are brought to justice, any\r\nefforts to eliminate the problem will remain futile and\r\nwill be seen by the victims of the slave trade as\r\nhypocritical. Robust action to counter all forms of\r\nhuman trafficking should be taken in the context of a\r\nglobal movement: a partnership, under the auspices of\r\nthe United Nations, to combat slavery and trafficking\r\nin persons in the twenty-first century.\r\nWe would like to commend a number of\r\nconstructive initiatives, including the proposal made by\r\nthe group of developing countries to enhance the\r\ncoordinating role of the United Nations in conducting\r\ninternational research into alternative sources of\r\nenergy.\r\nBelarus is prepared to join in the partnership\r\ninitiated by the United States aimed at pooling\r\ninternational efforts for a rapid response in the event of\r\nan avian flu pandemic. Clearly, the right solution to\r\nglobal problems will require coordinated and — most\r\nimportant — voluntary efforts on the part of all States.\r\nSuch consolidation is virtually impossible in a unipolar\r\nworld order, with its one-sided concept of good and\r\nevil. Certain Western countries view the worsening\r\nconflicts in this era of globalization as a “clash of\r\ncivilizations”, and they intend to eliminate the effects\r\nof processes that do not benefit them by establishing\r\nstandard models of ideology and statehood. Countries\r\nthat want to follow their own path of social\r\ndevelopment are subjected to harassment and labelling,\r\nand are proclaimed to be “rogue States”.\r\nWe are convinced that it will do no good to\r\ndisregard the diversity of approaches to progressive\r\n22\r\nA/60/PV.24\r\ndevelopment by imposing another’s will on peoples\r\nthat have chosen their own path of peaceful\r\ndevelopment based on historical, social and cultural\r\nvalues and traditions. We regret the politicization of\r\nmany United Nations activities, in particular in the area\r\nof human rights.\r\nThe Commission on Human Rights is becoming\r\nan instrument to exert political pressure on sovereign\r\nStates through the manipulation of the human rights\r\nagenda. The practice of adopting country resolutions\r\nhas proven to be ineffective. It sows hatred and distrust\r\namong countries and impedes open and constructive\r\ncooperation. The new human rights body should accord\r\npriority attention to global thematic human rights\r\nissues in the context of combating poverty, racist and\r\nnationalist movements and terrorism.\r\nThe reform of the human rights organs should be\r\nbased on the principle of transparency, non-selectivity,\r\nand the sovereign equality of all States Members of the\r\nUnited Nations. The creation of a human rights council\r\nas a kind of select club will therefore merely increase\r\nthe use of double or arbitrary standards against States\r\nthat are in the wrong. It will not help to protect human\r\nrights by strengthening cooperation in national efforts,\r\nbut will simply become a forum for settling accounts\r\nwith countries that have the temerity to conduct their\r\nown independent external policies.\r\nThe tendency to mainstream Western standards is\r\nbecoming clear. The report of Mr. Sach’s Task Force\r\ncontains politicized recommendations, inter alia, about\r\nthe inadvisability of providing technical assistance to\r\nunworthy countries. We believe it important to\r\nemphasize the need to maintain generally recognized\r\nprinciples in the United Nations operational activities\r\nfor development in order to strengthen partnership and\r\nmutual trust with the developing countries.\r\nBelarus views this past year as an extremely\r\nintense phase of the Organization’s work. If all of our\r\nexpectations of attaining our goals have not been met,\r\nwe must do even more to further coordinate our efforts\r\nto find new mechanisms for resolving strategic\r\nproblems. The best and only forum for such work\r\nremains the United Nations.\r\nMr. Sen (India): I would like to assure the full\r\nsupport of our delegation to the presidency in its\r\nendeavours to tackle the follow-up and implementation\r\nof the 2005 outcome document approved recently by\r\nour heads of State and Government.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General on the work\r\nof the Organization predates the summit and, in a\r\nsense, the outcome document is a comment on the\r\nreport, and the statements of our heads of State and\r\nGovernment and foreign ministers constitute comments\r\non the outcome document. To restrict comments to the\r\nreport would therefore be an exercise in futility, a\r\nputting-back of the clock.\r\nI would therefore briefly make some general\r\nobservations on how we see our continuing work. In\r\nthe first place, one of the lessons of the process leading\r\nto the outcome document is the need for a transparent,\r\nopen-ended process in which the broadest possible\r\nagreement is sought through open debate.\r\nOne of the examples of such an agreement that,\r\nunfortunately, does not find a place in the outcome\r\ndocument concerns trade and other important aspects\r\nof development. One cannot long continue to square\r\nthe circle. One cannot go on talking of the cancellation\r\nof debts, but restrict it to money from the International\r\nMonetary Fund (IMF) and include recycled aid and\r\ndebt; of growth without raising investment and savings\r\nrates through meeting official development assistance\r\ntargets and using innovative sources of financing; of\r\nforeign direct investment where even physical\r\ninfrastructure does not exist and public sector\r\ninvestment is required; of sustainable development\r\nwithout the transfer of resources or environmentally\r\nfriendly technology; of the development dimension of\r\nthe Doha Round without the principle of special and\r\ndifferential treatment; or of achieving the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals without achieving Goal 8.\r\nThere was broad agreement between the G-77\r\nand the European Union on giving a clear political\r\ndirection to the World Trade Organization ministerial\r\nmeeting in December. That remains a vital necessity.\r\nThat the United Nations has to give such direction and\r\nthat such direction is heeded is shown by the impact of\r\nthe outcome document on the Fund and Bank. The\r\nDevelopment Committee of the IMF and World Bank,\r\nin its latest communiqué of 25 September, refers to the\r\ndocument in urging developed countries to make\r\nconcrete efforts to fulfil the 0.7 per cent official\r\ndevelopment assistance target and also considers\r\n“enhancing the voice of the developing and transition\r\ncountries in our institutions to be of vital importance”.\r\nIt promises to build political consensus in the context\r\nof the IMF quota review. Similarly, it is vital that\r\nmonitoring the progress made in the implementation of\r\n23\r\nA/60/PV.24\r\nMillennium Development Goal 8 by developed\r\ncountries become an integral part of the monitoring of\r\nthe Goals as a whole. Therefore, country-level reports\r\nby developed countries with regard to progress on\r\ncommitments to developing countries remain\r\nimportant.\r\nIndia has an extensive bilateral programme of\r\neconomic and scientific cooperation with Africa\r\nthrough grants and credits that also encompass the vital\r\nareas of infrastructure and public health. We would\r\nwelcome, through the United Nations system, the\r\nmobilization of greater resources and coalitions of the\r\nwilling not to wage war, but to come together in joint\r\ninitiatives in the areas of agriculture — especially dry-\r\nland farming — water management and public health.\r\nSimilar efforts, taking special needs into account,\r\nwould be required in the case of the least developed\r\ncountries, the land-locked developing countries and the\r\nimplementation of the Mauritius strategy for the small\r\nisland developing States.\r\nThe outcome document has given an impulse to\r\nthe development of a strong counter-terrorism agenda.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s address to the International\r\nSummit on Democracy, Terrorism and Security in\r\nMadrid this year remains relevant. The question of\r\ndefining an offence is a matter of precisely legal\r\nlanguage and is already reflected in the text of the draft\r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism\r\nbeing considered by the Sixth Committee. The\r\nobjective here is a criminal law instrument that would\r\nfacilitate judicial cooperation, mutual assistance and\r\nextradition.\r\nThe General Assembly has to deal with that issue\r\nor else the Security Council will continue to do so.\r\nEither the General Assembly will have to adopt a\r\nmultilateral negotiated document or leave the Security\r\nCouncil to continue to deal with it in a partial,\r\npiecemeal manner governed by the political\r\nimperatives of the moment. We are near a compromise\r\nsolution that would enable agreement on the important\r\narticle 18 of the convention. The General Assembly\r\nhas the central role in codifying international law. As\r\nJennings said, we should not fall prey to “flights of\r\nerroneous fancy from the Nuremberg tribunal” and\r\nbelieve thereby that “we are developing international\r\nlaw”.\r\nThe facts speak for themselves. It is precisely the\r\ndebate on Security Council reform that gave synergy to\r\nthe process of reform. The omissions on development\r\nand the lack of sufficient progress on Security Council\r\nreform led to some of the energy and colour being\r\ndrained from the discussion of institutional reform and\r\nwhat followed. The reason is obvious. For any\r\nsatisfactory progress to be achieved, one has to address\r\nthe question of the distribution of economic power —\r\nthat is, development — and equally of political power\r\nof which, in the United Nations, the Security Council is\r\nthe locus.\r\nWe look forward to working together on the\r\npeacebuilding commission, the human rights council\r\nand reform of the Secretariat. In a post-conflict\r\nsettlement in which the party defeated could not be\r\nconsidered to be an imminent threat to peace and\r\nsecurity, the Security Council has, following resolution\r\n687 (1991), imposed de facto treaty obligations on\r\nStates without their consent. Therefore, if we are not to\r\nrepeat history, whether it be in the human rights\r\ncouncil or, in this particular context, the peacebuilding\r\ncommission, we will have to decide with a sense of\r\nhistory the questions of who sets up the body and to\r\nwhom it reports, since those are quite obviously not\r\nsimple or innocent questions.\r\nTo overcome the marginalization of the\r\ndeveloping countries, their empowerment through\r\nreform of the Security Council remains imperative. We\r\nwould continue to work with like-minded and other\r\ncountries to reach the broadest possible agreement on\r\nan expansion of the permanent and non-permanent\r\ncategories, to respect deadlines, and to bring the reform\r\nprocess to an early and successful conclusion.\r\nThere has been considerable progress in\r\nimplementing reforms in the Secretariat. Insofar as\r\nreview of mandates is concerned, this is clearly a\r\nlegislative prerogative which we hope the relevant\r\nintergovernmental bodies will complete expeditiously.\r\nWe look forward to proposals from the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on ethics and accountability, on which I\r\nunderstand he has taken action, as well as on the\r\nstrengthening of the capacity and independence of the\r\noversight structures of the Organization. What is\r\nrequired is not simply to fill a breach with new\r\nstructures and posts, but systems and sustained\r\nmanagerial attention to their enforcement.\r\nThe Capital Master Plan for United Nations\r\nHeadquarters in New York is an issue that has, sadly\r\nenough, been mired in what the Secretary-General\r\n24\r\nA/60/PV.24\r\nterms political and financial dynamics. This has\r\nadversely affected the issues of both financing and\r\nswing space. We await a comprehensive report from\r\nthe Secretary-General during the current General\r\nAssembly session in order urgently to take the required\r\ndecisions on this issue.\r\nMr. Wali (Nigeria): I wish to express the\r\nappreciation of the delegation of Nigeria to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan for his report on the work of the\r\nOrganization, contained in document A/60/1. The\r\nreport highlights some of the challenges confronting\r\nthe international community. These include conflict\r\nprevention and resolution, terrorism, natural disasters,\r\ndisease control, disarmament and arms control, poverty\r\nand sustainable development. The report, which\r\nreviews constructive and enduring solutions to\r\nfundamental global problems, also offers\r\nrecommendations and highlights the complexity of the\r\ntasks confronting humanity.\r\nIt is in this context that Nigeria views with\r\nconcern the persistence of conflicts in many regions of\r\nthe world. We therefore commend the efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations, through the Security Council, for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. While\r\nthe United Nations has achieved some measure of\r\nsuccess, we still need to do more to usher in durable\r\npeace and stability in conflict- ravaged areas.\r\nNigeria also commends the efforts of the\r\nSecretary-General in his continued use of preventive\r\ndiplomacy, peacemaking and peacebuilding, as well as\r\nof special envoys, in the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. Here, to some extent, we have been\r\nable to achieve the targets set in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, despite the rather discouraging surge in\r\nthe global demand for peacekeeping operations.\r\nWe note with satisfaction that regional\r\norganizations have become essential partners of the\r\nUnited Nations in the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security through the establishment of\r\ninstitutional cooperation for conflict prevention,\r\nmanagement and resolution. In this connection, we\r\ncommend the successful sixth high-level meeting\r\nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations\r\nheld in New York in July 2005, and urge that such\r\nmeetings continue.\r\nWe commend the effective cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the African Union, the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS) and the Intergovernmental Authority of\r\nDevelopment (IGAD) in peacekeeping, peacemaking\r\nand preventive diplomacy, particularly in Côte d’Ivoire\r\nand the Darfur region in the Sudan.\r\nAs the world continues to suffer devastating\r\nconsequences of terrorist acts, Nigeria reaffirms its\r\ncondemnation of international terrorism. We pledge our\r\ncooperation with other members of the international\r\ncommunity, through bilateral and multilateral efforts,\r\nto combat this menace in all its forms. We support the\r\nSecretary-General’s five-point strategy to combat\r\nterrorism set out at the International Summit on\r\nDemocracy, Terrorism and Security, which was held in\r\nMadrid in March 2005. We look forward to the\r\ninternational community’s conclusion of a\r\ncomprehensive convention against terrorism.\r\nThe illicit trade in small arms and light weapons\r\ncontinues to be of serious concern to the international\r\ncommunity, and particularly to developing countries,\r\nsince it contributes to conflicts and political instability.\r\nThe excessive accumulation and easy availability of\r\nsmall arms and light weapons hinders peacebuilding\r\nand threatens human security. We are disappointed at\r\nreported cases of non-compliance with nuclear non-\r\nproliferation commitments and an ambivalent\r\ncommitment to disarmament. We therefore encourage\r\nearly revitalization of multilateral instruments to\r\nprevent proliferation and promote disarmament.\r\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic continues to pose grave\r\nchallenges to our development efforts. We appreciate\r\nthe efforts of the United Nations and the contributions\r\nof the international community in combating this\r\nscourge, particularly in Africa. We note the assistance\r\nof the Secretary-General’s Special Envoys for\r\nHIV/AIDS in promoting key issues and advocating an\r\nexpanded response to HIV/AIDS, especially in Africa.\r\nNigeria notes the deliberations and decisions\r\ntaken by our leaders very recently on the\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals\r\n(MDGs). It has always been our view that the MDGs\r\nmust be pursued as part of a larger development agenda\r\nthat encompasses addressing the needs of all\r\ndeveloping countries, as well as seeking to reduce\r\npoverty and inequality. We endorse the\r\nrecommendation that social integration and issues that\r\nrequire long-term approaches must be addressed\r\nequally. These include the differential impact of\r\n25\r\nA/60/PV.24\r\nglobalization and increasing the participation of\r\ndeveloping countries in global economic governance.\r\nNigeria reaffirms its support for the priority\r\naccorded by the United Nations to the special needs of\r\nAfrica and notes with satisfaction that recognition was\r\ngiven to this subject in the outcome document. For too\r\nlong, Africa has remained the backwater of\r\ndevelopment. But with the ascendancy of a new crop of\r\nleaders committed to the fundamental transformation\r\nof African societies, we are confident that the social\r\nand economic circumstances of African peoples will be\r\nprogressively improved. Our sense of optimism is\r\nbuoyed by the continuing efforts of the United Nations\r\nto facilitate the implementation of the New Partnership\r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD), as well as specific\r\nmeasures taken or contemplated by our development\r\npartners.\r\nNigeria reaffirms its commitment to General\r\nAssembly resolution 58/295, which outlined specific\r\nmeasures to strengthen the security and safety of the\r\nUnited Nations system, including field security\r\narrangements at all duty stations worldwide. We\r\nconsider measures to unify the separate security\r\nstructures into the Department of Safety and Security\r\nas well placed.\r\nWe have noted the implementation of the various\r\nreform proposals, as contained in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s 2002 report entitled “Strengthening the\r\nUnited Nations: an agenda for further change”\r\n(A/57/387). Some of the positive effects of these\r\nreforms include a revised programme budget for 2004-\r\n2005; shorter, more efficient cycle planning and\r\nbudgeting for the biennium 2006-2007, a reduction in\r\nthe quantity of reports and meetings and greater\r\nintegration of human rights elements into the work of\r\nUnited Nations country teams.\r\nWe support the Secretary-General’s proposals to\r\nstrengthen Secretariat capacity through the improved\r\nperformance of senior management and by enhancing\r\noversight, accountability and transparency; we hope\r\nthat this will be sustained. We recall that our heads of\r\nState or Government, at the end of the High-level\r\nPlenary Meeting, expressed similar expectations.\r\nThe Nigerian delegation, therefore, is ready to\r\nengage in discussions with Member State delegations,\r\nwith a view to elaborating the various reform\r\ninitiatives. It is essential in this regard that the\r\nrequested reports be submitted to the General\r\nAssembly early, through the normal process, so as to\r\nenable us to build on the momentum generated by the\r\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting.\r\nThe United Nations Charter and other sources of\r\ninternational law have established the framework under\r\nwhich justice and respect for the obligations arising\r\nfrom treaties can be maintained. Our affirmation of\r\nrespect for the Charter and international law should be\r\nreflected in our actions and in a commitment to\r\nmultilateralism. We note that the rule of law is\r\nbecoming more widely accepted and that States are\r\nincreasingly employing treaties to regulate their\r\nrelations.\r\nIn conclusion, Nigeria again commends the\r\nSecretary-General for his leadership, vision and\r\nexample in strengthening the effectiveness of the\r\nOrganization. We have no doubt that the\r\nimplementation of the various initiatives he proposed,\r\nand which were adopted at the summit, will help to\r\ntransform the United Nations into the Organization of\r\nour dreams, reinforce trust and confidence in its\r\nefficiency, and facilitate the attainment of the lofty\r\ngoals reflected in its Charter and restated in the\r\noutcome document. In that pursuit, I wish to pledge\r\nNigeria’s continued cooperation.\r\nMr. Laurin (Canada): On behalf of Canada,\r\nAustralia and New Zealand, I would like to thank the\r\nSecretary-General for his report (A/60/1). As he notes,\r\nthe past year has seen both progress and setbacks for\r\nthe international community. The 2005 World Summit\r\nOutcome (resolution 60/1) reflects that reality, and\r\nprovides a starting point from which we must build in\r\norder to ensure that the sixtieth anniversary is truly a\r\nyear of reform.\r\nWe are pleased with many of the achievements\r\nthat the 2005 World Summit Outcome represents,\r\nincluding the reaffirmation of core values and\r\nprinciples, cooperation to address global health threats,\r\nthe reaffirmation of the Monterrey Consensus and\r\nstrong commitment to achieving the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. We are pleased that the\r\ndevelopment outcomes recognize the need for good\r\ngovernance and anti-corruption measures in developing\r\ncountries and the crucial role of trade liberalization in\r\nstimulating sustainable development. We are heartened\r\nby progress towards the establishment of the\r\nPeacebuilding Commission and the decision to create a\r\nnew Human Rights Council, which constitute major\r\n26\r\nA/60/PV.24\r\ninstitutional reforms in their own right. And we are\r\nparticularly pleased that the membership was able to\r\nagree on strong language on the responsibility to\r\nprotect, which articulates for the first time universal\r\nacceptance of our collective responsibility to protect\r\npopulations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic\r\ncleansing and crimes against humanity.\r\nWhile the achievements are significant, the\r\nomissions are also striking. We particularly regret the\r\ncomplete absence of agreed text in the areas of\r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation and on the\r\nInternational Criminal Court, and the weak language\r\non women’s human rights and equality. We are also\r\ndisappointed that States were unable to agree upon a\r\nstronger political declaration on terrorism.\r\nCanada, Australia and New Zealand strongly\r\nsupport summit progress on administrative and\r\nmanagement reform. We urge the Secretary-General to\r\nshoulder his responsibility and make proposals during\r\nthe sixtieth session — indeed, this autumn — on the\r\nkey issues identified for action, notably, review of\r\nUnited Nations human resources and financial policies\r\nand regulations, the review of long-term mandates and\r\nmeasures to enhance ethical conduct and strengthen\r\nindependent oversight and accountability. Taken\r\ntogether, that package can modernize what we do and\r\nhow we do it, while bolstering the credibility of the\r\nOrganization and public confidence in it.\r\nIn the weeks ahead, we must all work together to\r\nensure that the positive momentum of the summit is\r\nnot lost, but is rather harnessed in support of\r\nimplementation. In that regard, it is particularly\r\nimportant that we move quickly to finalize the\r\nestablishment of the Peacebuilding Commission, so\r\nthat it can commence its work no later than 1 January\r\n2006, as mandated by our leaders. Similarly, we\r\nencourage the President of the General Assembly to\r\nmove quickly to launch a process that will lead to the\r\nestablishment of an effective and credible Human\r\nRights Council, one that provides for the specific input\r\nand participation of civil society groups. We believe\r\nwork on those major institutional innovations and other\r\nsummit initiatives can and should proceed in parallel,\r\nso that no initiative is advanced at the cost of another.\r\nAs we move forward, Canada, Australia and New\r\nZealand believe that it is essential that the agreements\r\noutlined in the outcome document serve as the\r\nfoundation for our work, and that attempts to reopen or\r\nrenegotiate core summit decisions be rejected.\r\nAustralia, New Zealand and Canada look forward\r\nto working with all members to ensure that we realize\r\nthe aspirations embodied in the summit outcome\r\ndocument.\r\nMr. Mérorès (Haiti) (spoke in French): Allow\r\nme to commend Mr. Jan Eliasson on the way in which\r\nhe is conducting our work. I would like to assure him\r\nof the full cooperation of the Haitian delegation. I also\r\nwish to thank Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his\r\nreport on the work of the Organization (A/60/1). Once\r\nagain, I pay tribute to his tireless efforts and his\r\nresolute commitment to work to build a fairer world. In\r\nthat regard, we associate ourselves with the statement\r\nmade earlier today by Jamaica on behalf of the Group\r\nof 77 and China.\r\nThe comprehensive report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral is fully in line with the achievement of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals and the promotion of\r\nsustained economic growth and sustainable\r\ndevelopment. It appraises the progress made in the\r\nareas of development, security, human rights and\r\nUnited Nations reform.\r\nIn the area of the maintenance of peace and\r\nsecurity, certain significant progress has been made,\r\nparticularly in Africa, in the Middle East and in Asia.\r\nThe United Nations must pursue its efforts in order to\r\nresolve other conflicts in various parts of the world.\r\nIn that regard, I would like to pay tribute to the\r\nvery important work done by the United Nations\r\nStabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), which,\r\ntogether with the Haitian National Police, is striving to\r\ncreate a secure and stable environment in the country.\r\nThose efforts will make it possible for the\r\nconstitutional and political process to move forward.\r\nDespite certain isolated acts on the part of armed\r\ngroups, the security situation in my country has\r\ngradually improved. Preparations are under way for the\r\nholding of presidential and legislative elections by the\r\nend of 2005. The Transitional Government will do its\r\nutmost, with the assistance of the international\r\ncommunity and MINUSTAH, to ensure that the\r\nelections take place with full transparency and in the\r\nbest possible security conditions. On 7 February 2006 a\r\ndemocratically elected Government will be invested\r\nwith full powers.\r\n27\r\nA/60/PV.24\r\nHaiti will continue to rely on the support of the\r\ninternational community in order to strengthen its\r\ndemocratic institutions, because it has been precisely\r\nour shortcomings in that area that has cost us so much\r\ndisruption in recent decades.\r\nHow can we live free from fear if the threat of\r\nterrorism is always with us? We must pool our efforts\r\nto find the best strategies to enable us to tackle and\r\ndefeat that scourge. The unspeakable terrorist acts\r\nperpetrated in many places around the world this year\r\nhave highlighted the serious nature of the scourge for\r\nthe whole international community.\r\nIn the area of disarmament, concern persists in\r\nthe international community. The 2005 Review\r\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons, held in May, failed\r\nto reach substantive agreement. It would be disastrous\r\nfor the international community if terrorist\r\norganizations were to possess weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. Therefore it is essential to revitalize the\r\nmultilateral instruments designed to promote\r\ndisarmament and prevent nuclear proliferation.\r\nPoverty, hunger, preventable and curable\r\ndiseases, illiteracy, drugs and natural disasters are other\r\nthreats and challenges facing today’s world. The\r\ninternational community must further commit itself to\r\na tireless struggle to achieve a safer, freer and fairer\r\nworld, marked by genuine solidarity.\r\nOn 16 September, in the 2005 World Summit\r\nOutcome (resolution 60/1), our leaders reaffirmed the\r\nMillennium Declaration adopted on the threshold of\r\nthe twenty-first century. Five years after the\r\nMillennium Declaration of 2000, they reviewed\r\nprogress made in implementing the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. The finding was that one of the\r\nmajor and most pressing goals set for 2015, the\r\nreduction of extreme poverty, would not be achieved\r\nwithout major readjustments.\r\nThe reduction of extreme poverty is a shared\r\nresponsibility. On the one hand, the developing\r\ncountries must draft national strategies aimed at\r\nachieving the targets set out in the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. On the other hand, the developed\r\ncountries must honour their commitments. They\r\npromised to increase official development assistance to\r\n0.7 per cent of their GDP by 2015. In July 2005 during\r\nthe G-8 summit, the wealthy countries promised to\r\nincrease their annual assistance by 50 thousand million\r\ndollars by 2010.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the commitment made\r\nrecently at London by the G-8 to cancel the multilateral\r\ndebt of the 18 most indebted countries. Likewise, we\r\nappeal to the wealthy countries to consider establishing\r\na moratorium on the debt of several very poor\r\ncountries that were not included on that initial list,\r\nsuch as my country. These countries urgently need to\r\nreduce pressure on their budgets, which are financed\r\nfrom meagre resources.\r\nThe burden of servicing debt and the payment of\r\narrears have a suffocating effect on the economies of\r\ndeveloping countries. They prevent the financing of\r\npublic development projects and programmes,\r\nespecially social programmes. A moratorium would\r\nallow the reduction of unemployment, calm the\r\nsituation and decrease social tension.\r\nThere should also be an open, predictable and\r\nnon-discriminatory financial and trade system. The\r\nestablishment of strategies that guarantee decent labour\r\nconditions, provide for access to inexpensive\r\nmedicines and spread new information and\r\ncommunication technologies are also needed.\r\nA true global partnership would help the\r\ndeveloping countries and promote development at the\r\nglobal level. Our countries would benefit from world\r\ngrowth resulting from a spirit of fair trade where the\r\nadvances of some are not made at the expense of\r\nothers. The result would be more stable economic\r\ngrowth, better capable of supporting development.\r\nThere can be no development without security\r\nand respect for human rights. The Secretary-General\r\nunderstood this well in his report entitled “In larger\r\nfreedom: towards development, security and human\r\nrights for all” (A/59/2005).\r\nHaiti wishes to reiterate its commitment to our\r\nOrganization’s ideals and principles, to universality\r\nand to the goals of peace and development through\r\ninternational cooperation. Haiti shares the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nSince the beginning of the political transition\r\nnow under way, the Government of Haiti has been\r\nworking hand in hand with the international\r\ncommunity for the establishment of the rule of law, a\r\nprerequisite for socio-economic development.\r\n28\r\nA/60/PV.24\r\nThe role played by a renewed and strengthened\r\nUnited Nations is indispensable. The Security Council\r\nmust reflect the international reality of the twenty-first\r\ncentury by including Member States capable of\r\nassuming peacekeeping responsibilities. The\r\ndeveloping countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America\r\nand the Caribbean must be represented there with\r\npermanent seats. Today’s reality and the multiple limits\r\nof our world require the Security Council to open its\r\nmembership to others. Unilateral policies no longer\r\nhave a reason to exist.\r\nNonetheless, the debate concerning expansion of\r\nthe Council must not take precedence over other\r\nimportant issues concerning reform of the United\r\nNations as a whole, namely the reform of the General\r\nAssembly and the Economic and Social Council and\r\nthe creation of a Human Rights Council as a central\r\nbody and the Peacebuilding Commission.\r\nAt the time of its sixtieth anniversary, the United\r\nNations must play an indispensable role in accordance\r\nwith the Charter in peacekeeping, international security\r\nand the settlement of conflicts and, above all, serve the\r\ngoal of sustainable development, the other name for\r\npeace.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.55 p.m.\r\n"
