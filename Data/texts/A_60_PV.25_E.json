(Sweden)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 110 (continued)\r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization (A/60/1)\r\nMr. Kazykhanov (Kazakhstan): At the outset, I\r\nwould like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General for\r\nhis comprehensive report on the work of the\r\nOrganization, which covers the multifaceted activities\r\nof all United Nations institutions. Indeed, this has been\r\na most challenging, crucial and fruitful year in United\r\nNations history. The Secretary-General and the\r\nOrganization have taken bold and practical steps in\r\nseveral important areas — namely, security,\r\ndevelopment and human rights, as well as institutional\r\nreforms.\r\nTwo weeks ago, we all witnessed the historic\r\nUnited Nations summit. Its outcome document, in the\r\nwords of the Secretary-General, is “a good instrument\r\nto streamline the United Nations to meet the many new\r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century”. Now, we must\r\ntake coordinated action to fully utilize these new\r\nopportunities.\r\nKazakhstan stresses an urgent need to deal with\r\nglobal challenges to disarmament and non-\r\nproliferation. As we all know, the 2005 Review\r\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons failed to set up a\r\nbalanced and comprehensive mechanism that would\r\nstrengthen the international non-proliferation regime\r\nand facilitate the attainment of the goal of the complete\r\nelimination of nuclear weapons. More disturbing,\r\nhowever, is the lack of clear recommendations on the\r\nburning issues of non-proliferation and disarmament in\r\nthe outcome document of the 2005 United Nations\r\nsummit.\r\nToday, challenges and threats, including those\r\ninvolving the uncontrolled spread of nuclear weapons\r\nand the risk of their finding a way into the hands of\r\nterrorists, have grown manyfold. The elimination of\r\nsuch threats requires joint, well-coordinated and\r\neffective action at all levels. We believe that\r\ninternational cooperation in fighting terrorism should\r\nbe pursued in strict compliance with the norms of\r\ninternational law, and we look forward to the early\r\ncompletion of a comprehensive convention against\r\ninternational terrorism.\r\nWe support further the universalization and\r\nenhancement of anti-terrorist treaty mechanisms. The\r\nsigning by Kazakhstan of the International Convention\r\nfor the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism is a\r\npractical reaffirmation of that position.\r\nIn January 2005, Kazakhstan hosted a meeting of\r\nthe Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) of the\r\nSecurity Council. We consider it very significant that\r\nthe CTC meeting was convened jointly with the\r\nCommonwealth of Independent States in the heart of\r\nthe Eurasian continent. Counter-terrorism activities in\r\nour region are closely linked with efforts to prevent the\r\ntrafficking of drugs, arms and human beings. Most of\r\nthe region’s organizations pay special attention to the\r\n2\r\nA/60/PV.25\r\ndevelopment of cooperation in counter-terrorism\r\nactivities. We believe that that the experience we have\r\ngained in the process might prove useful for the CTC.\r\nFor Kazakhstan, the proposed Peacebuilding\r\nCommission is a step in the right direction. As its main\r\nmission, it should strive to avert the recurrence of\r\nsituations when the lack of a peacebuilding strategy\r\nresults in the escalation of internal conflicts and,\r\nultimately, in the further loss by States of their capacity\r\nto perform their sovereign functions effectively and\r\nresponsibly.\r\nOur country is actively working on issues related\r\nto the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-\r\nBuilding Measures in Asia (CICA). CICA is a venue\r\nfor an exchange of views on Asian security. It is\r\nencouraging to see that the CICA process is gaining\r\nmomentum and has, indeed, become an important tool\r\nof preventive diplomacy.\r\nAchievement of the Millennium Development\r\nGoals (MDGs) should become a central element of the\r\ninternational community’s efforts to put an end to\r\npoverty, conflict, instability and terrorism. Economic\r\nand social development, as well as international\r\ncooperation, must become key elements in the\r\npreventive approach to collective security. The second\r\nnational report on the MDGs, recently released in close\r\ncooperation with the Government of the Republic of\r\nKazakhstan, indicates that our nation has already\r\nachieved a number of goals, especially as regards\r\nuniversal education, the eradication of poverty and\r\ngender promotion. We are also close to reaching\r\nimportant targets in some other areas.\r\nWe commend the United Nations and its\r\nspecialized agencies for their assistance in addressing\r\nthe effects of environmental disasters in the Aral Sea\r\narea and in the Semipalatinsk region. Problems in those\r\nregions are global in scope, as they have a negative\r\neffect on the health and livelihood of people in other\r\nregions of the globe. In this context, we request the\r\ninternational community to support a draft resolution at\r\nthe current session of the General Assembly on the\r\nSemipalatinsk region, sponsored by Kazakhstan.\r\nWe believe that the special needs of landlocked\r\ndeveloping countries should be taken fully into\r\naccount, as outlined in the Almaty Programme of\r\nAction. For that reason, Kazakhstan is satisfied that the\r\noutcome document of the 2005 United Nations summit\r\ncontains provisions on improved transit transport\r\ncapacity of landlocked countries and their access to\r\nworld markets. In order to stimulate the\r\nimplementation process of the Almaty Programme of\r\nAction, the Government of Kazakhstan, together with\r\nthe Office of the High Representative for the Least\r\nDeveloped Countries, Landlocked Developing\r\nCountries and Small Island Developing States, held a\r\nHigh-level Meeting on the Role of International,\r\nRegional and Subregional Organizations for the\r\nImplementation of the Almaty Programme of Action,\r\nin Almaty last March. We consider it to be a significant\r\ncontribution to the implementation of this Programme\r\nthrough strengthened partnerships of all parties\r\nconcerned, including international, regional and\r\nsubregional organizations.\r\nKazakhstan believes that the rule of law is of\r\nparamount importance in international relations. We\r\nclosely link Kazakhstan’s development to the further\r\ndemocratization of our society, based on respect for the\r\nrights and freedoms of every individual. Therefore,\r\nKazakhstan supports the strengthening of United\r\nNations democratic institutions and human rights\r\nmachinery. We sincerely hope that these changes are\r\ndesigned to promote the rights and freedoms of citizens\r\nand to ensure compliance with the principles of non-\r\ninterference and sovereign equality of States.\r\nWhile supporting the reform process, we strongly\r\nbelieve that priority should be given to the General\r\nAssembly as the main deliberative, decision-making\r\nand representative body of our Organization.\r\nMy delegation would like to reiterate that such a\r\nsensitive issue as the reform of the Security Council\r\nshould be resolved on the basis of the broadest possible\r\nagreement. We are convinced that the enlargement of\r\nthe Security Council, in accordance with the principle\r\nof equitable geographical representation and on the\r\nbasis of the contributions of States concerned towards\r\ndevelopment of the world economy and global security,\r\nserves the interests of Member States.\r\nKazakhstan welcomes the establishment of a\r\nstanding committee on regional organizations. We hope\r\nthat improved collaboration of the United Nations with\r\nregional organizations will contribute to the collective\r\nsecurity system.\r\nInter-faith dialogue is an integral part of efforts to\r\npromote the culture of peace and dialogue among\r\ncivilizations and to advance the common values\r\noutlined in the Millennium Declaration. We believe\r\n3\r\nA/60/PV.25\r\nthat the informal meeting on interreligious dialogue\r\nand cooperation for peace, held within the framework\r\nof the 2005 summit in New York and cosponsored by\r\nKazakhstan, made a substantial contribution to\r\nenhanced interfaith dialogue.\r\nWe are grateful to the international community\r\nfor lending support to our country’s initiatives in this\r\narea. Kazakhstan has initiated a Congress of Leaders of\r\nWorld and Traditional Religions. The second Congress\r\nof Leaders of World and Traditional Religions is to be\r\nheld next year in Astana. We will discuss the topic of\r\nreligions, society and international security.\r\nKazakhstan expects representatives of other emerging\r\nforums, such as the Alliance of Civilizations, to take\r\npart in the Congress.\r\nOur people know that development, security and\r\nhuman rights, the three main pillars of today’s world,\r\nare not abstract concepts. We realize that eventual\r\nsuccess in attaining our objectives will be assured\r\nthrough the mobilization of resources and\r\nmaximization of support from all members of the\r\ninternational community. Kazakhstan is actively and\r\nresponsibly involved in all major United Nations\r\nactivities and in recent years has begun to shoulder\r\nmore responsibility by making voluntary financial\r\ncontributions to United Nations funds and programmes.\r\nMr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese): I\r\nwould like to begin by thanking the Secretary-General\r\nfor his report on the work of the United Nations. The\r\nreport reviews the work over the past year and contains\r\nan array of recommendations on ways to address the\r\nchallenges facing us today. I would like to focus on\r\nthree points in connection with the recent summit.\r\nFirst, on the implementation of the outcome\r\ndocument of the summit, this year marks the sixtieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations. The outcome\r\ndocument, which the summit adopted two weeks ago,\r\nreflects a common understanding on the part of all\r\nsides and points out the direction for the future work of\r\nthe United Nations. Currently, the most important task\r\nis to implement the outcome document effectively, so\r\nas to translate the words into reality. This is a daunting\r\nchallenge that requires the full cooperation of all. The\r\noutcome document involves many aspects. Therefore,\r\nits implementation should proceed on all fronts but\r\nshould also follow an order of priorities. While the\r\nfocus should be on certain issues, efforts in other areas\r\nshould proceed in parallel.\r\nWe believe that, in the implementation of the\r\noutcome document, development should occupy the\r\nprimary and core position. Maximum efforts should be\r\nmade to meet the needs of developing countries,\r\nespecially African countries, in order to inject new\r\nvitality into development efforts and to enable\r\ndeveloping countries to derive genuine benefit from the\r\nsummit.\r\nChina supports the rapid establishment of the\r\nPeacebuilding Commission and believes that it should\r\nbegin functioning as soon as possible in order to set up\r\nan effective link among the United Nations efforts in\r\nthe areas of peacekeeping, post-conflict reconstruction\r\nand development. The agreement to establish this\r\nCommission is a major achievement of the summit. It\r\nwill play a positive role in peaceful reconstruction in\r\nconflict areas. We call for the completion of this task\r\nas soon as possible.\r\nTerrorism is a common threat to all countries. We\r\nsupport an early completion of the negotiations on a\r\ncomprehensive convention against terrorism and stand\r\nready to work actively with all countries toward this\r\nend.\r\nAs for the reform of the Secretariat, we look\r\nforward to the relevant report, which is to be submitted\r\nby the Secretary-General. The necessary reform of the\r\ninternal management of the Secretariat will be\r\nconducive to the improvement of our Organization’s\r\nefficiency, so as to make it better able to serve the\r\ninterests of Member States. Reform measures should\r\naim both at enhancing the managerial capability of the\r\nSecretariat and at ensuring that the rights of Member\r\nStates are safeguarded. We hope that discussions will\r\ncontinue on the report of the Secretary-General in an\r\neffort to achieve consensus.\r\nThe summit agreed to the establishment of a\r\nHuman Rights Council. However, great divergences\r\nremain over its specific model, size and composition.\r\nThe causes for these divergences have to do with the\r\npoliticization of human rights issues and with double\r\nstandards. We hope that in the coming consultations,\r\nStates can take a constructive approach to reduce\r\ndifferences, increase common understanding and find\r\nappropriate solutions.\r\nThere remain divergences of views on some\r\nspecific issues in the outcome document. It is\r\nimpossible for differences of principle to be resolved\r\nany time soon. It is of key importance that all sides\r\n4\r\nA/60/PV.25\r\naccommodate the concerns of others and press on with\r\npatient consultations.\r\nSecondly, regarding peace and security, this past\r\nyear has, as the report says, witnessed both progress\r\nand setbacks, not just for the United Nations but also\r\nfor the world. The United Nations continues to play an\r\nimportant role in helping to solve the questions of Iraq,\r\nthe Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\r\nCôte d’Ivoire, Afghanistan and Haiti. Success has been\r\nachieved in Sierra Leone, Bougainville and Timor\r\nLeste. However, in many regions, attempts to resolve\r\ntensions have led to stalemates, and there have even\r\nbeen relapses.\r\nThe political transitional process in Iraq has\r\nentered a key stage, with progress in developing the\r\nconstitution. The parties concerned should\r\nexpeditiously improve the security situation in Iraq,\r\nenhance the representativity and inclusiveness of the\r\nIraqi political process and help the Iraqi people\r\nreconstruct their country. The United Nations should\r\nplay an active role in the preparations for the general\r\nelections and in the promotion of national\r\nreconciliation.\r\nThe peace process in the Middle East has recently\r\nwitnessed positive developments. With the cooperation\r\nof the Palestinian side, Israel has successfully\r\ncompleted its withdrawal from Gaza and areas in the\r\nWest Bank. This is of positive significance for the\r\nadvancement of the talks between the parties and the\r\nresolution of the conflict. We hope that both parties\r\nwill seize this opportune moment and put the Israeli\r\nand Palestinian peace process back on the track of the\r\nroad map as soon as possible.\r\nMr. Akram (Pakistan), Vice President, took the\r\nchair.\r\nDuring the past year, United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations encountered challenges on an\r\nunprecedented scale. All countries, especially\r\ndeveloped countries, should provide greater political\r\nsupport to the United Nations, in terms of troops and\r\nresources, so that its peacekeeping operations can be\r\ncarried out effectively.\r\nChina supports efforts by the United Nations to\r\nenhance its rapid deployment and strategic\r\npreparations capacity and endorses efforts under the\r\nguidance of the Security Council to fully mobilize the\r\nresources of the regional organizations concerned.\r\nThirdly, on the question of development, the\r\nSecretary-General again emphasizes in his report the\r\nimportance of development. As he says in his report,\r\n“Our generation is the first to have the knowledge\r\nand resources to eradicate extreme poverty, so\r\nthere is no longer any excuse for leaving over a\r\nbillion of our fellow human beings in that state.”\r\n(A/60/1, para. 4)\r\nAchieving the Millennium Development Goals\r\n(MDGs) is a solemn commitment made by all countries\r\nat the summit and doing so is the embodiment of the\r\nhope that hundreds of millions of people have placed in\r\nthe United Nations. Today there is an urgent need to\r\nfurther deepen reforms in order to make the\r\ninternational economic system and rules more fair and\r\njust and more reflective of the concerns of developing\r\ncountries, so as to push the economic globalization\r\nprocess in the direction of balance, universal benefit\r\nand win-win situations.\r\nIt is therefore necessary to create a favourable\r\nfinancial and trade environment for developing\r\ncountries, reduce their debt burdens and strengthen\r\ntheir capacity to participate in international economic\r\naffairs so that they can truly benefit from economic\r\nglobalization. At the same time, developing countries\r\nshould pool their efforts, choose development models\r\nin the light of their national conditions, strengthen\r\nSouth-South cooperation and gradually improve their\r\ndisadvantageous position with respect to economic\r\nglobalization. A broad consensus has already been\r\nreached on the need to strengthen multilateralism in the\r\nrole of the United Nations — a point that was\r\nreaffirmed in the outcome document.\r\nAfter 60 years of trials and tribulations, the\r\nimportance of the role of the United Nations in peace\r\nand development is self-evident. The tsunami that\r\noccurred in the Indian Ocean in December 2004 was a\r\ncalamity of unprecedented proportions, affecting\r\n14 countries on two continents. Recently, one hurricane\r\nafter another hit the southern United States, causing\r\ndestruction and casualties that exceeded predictions.\r\nHowever, in both cases, Governments, international\r\norganizations, including United Nations agencies, and\r\nmembers of civil society provided assistance to the\r\nbest of their ability and swiftly mobilized resources on\r\na massive scale to provide humanitarian relief. That\r\nproves that the international community has the ability\r\n5\r\nA/60/PV.25\r\nto take collective actions promptly and effectively to\r\naddress major challenges.\r\nThe future role of the United Nations will depend\r\non collective efforts and contributions to\r\nmultilateralism by all parties and on efforts to honour\r\nthe commitments made at the summit to United\r\nNations reform. Only thus can the United Nations\r\nimprove its effectiveness, strengthen its leading role in\r\ninternational affairs and consolidate its capacity to\r\naddress all manner of threats and challenges.\r\nMr. Sardenberg (Brazil): The discussion of the\r\nSecretary-General’s report on the work of the\r\nOrganization (A/60/1) provides us, on a yearly basis,\r\nwith a highly valuable opportunity to take stock of\r\ndevelopments affecting the international situation and\r\nof United Nations actions to deal with them. The\r\nSecretary-General’s report once again provides the\r\nGeneral Assembly with a comprehensive and very\r\ncarefully crafted account of challenges met, tasks\r\naccomplished and goals remaining to be achieved in\r\nour collective endeavour. Through it, he shares with us\r\nhis keen perception of current realities, of threats\r\ncurrently before us and of how best to deal with them\r\ncollectively and in the most effective and least\r\nindividually taxing manner.\r\nThis particular session of the General Assembly\r\nis, in a way, the culmination of that process. A few\r\nweeks ago, our political leaders gathered here at the\r\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting and agreed on a set of\r\ngoals aimed at the promotion of economic and social\r\ndevelopment and at the institutional reform of the\r\nOrganization. In many cases, agreements were reached\r\non the basis of broad principles, and they will have to\r\nbe fleshed out by the General Assembly during the\r\ncourse of the substantive debate of this session.\r\nEven though the final results of the High-level\r\nPlenary Meeting were not as far-reaching as the\r\nmajority of Member States had expected, its outcome\r\ndocument (resolution 60/1) serves as a minimum\r\nplatform for our continued efforts to promote the\r\nmuch-needed reform and strengthening of the\r\nOrganization. That will require us to adopt a\r\npronouncedly forward-looking approach to the work of\r\nthis session.\r\nIn terms of development, the international\r\ncommunity has recognized that its current efforts have\r\nbeen insufficient and that there is a pressing need to\r\nredouble those efforts in order to achieve the\r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) by the agreed\r\ndeadline of 2015. A substantial increase in official\r\ndevelopment assistance is essential, and innovative\r\nsources of financing for development are urgently\r\nneeded.\r\nAs President Da Silva said in his statement before\r\nthe High-level Plenary Meeting,\r\n“We must take immediate and courageous steps.\r\nThe resources available for fighting poverty and\r\nhunger must be significantly expanded; we need\r\nto provide development opportunities to poor\r\ncountries” (A/60/PV.5, p. 16).\r\nHe went on to say that developed countries must\r\nrealize that that additional effort is not only fair, but\r\nabsolutely necessary.\r\nThat necessity is further underscored by the\r\nperception — now universally acknowledged — that\r\nthe question of development is intrinsically linked to\r\ninternational peace and security. More must be done to\r\npromote and facilitate cooperation among developing\r\ncountries themselves. South-South cooperation does\r\nnot replace the traditional forms of North-South\r\ncooperation, but rather complements it. South-South\r\ncooperation modalities often result in more adequate\r\nsolutions to challenges related to development, as such\r\nchallenges tend to be faced by most developing\r\ncountries. However, more resources will be needed to\r\nensure that South-South cooperation — which is\r\nalready a growing field — can be sufficiently expanded\r\nto ensure a scale that allows for the attainment of the\r\nMDGs.\r\nIn striving to promote social and economic\r\ndevelopment, we must also focus our attention on\r\ncooperation in the field of science and technology, as\r\nprovided for in the outcome document. International\r\nactions in that field must be aimed at ensuring\r\nimproved access to scientific knowledge and the\r\ntransfer to developing countries of technologies that\r\nare financially accessible and adapted to their\r\ncircumstances, particularly in the case of the least\r\ndeveloped countries. Brazil is now considering\r\norganizing a Brazil-Africa technological forum, open\r\nto the participation of Governments, civil society, the\r\nprivate sector and financial institutions, aimed at\r\npromoting cooperation projects in the areas of science,\r\ntechnology and education.\r\n6\r\nA/60/PV.25\r\nWith regard to the promotion of peace and\r\nsecurity, one threat that affects the international\r\ncommunity in its entirety is the scourge of terrorism.\r\nThese unjustifiable acts victimize innocent civilians in\r\nrich and poor countries alike, not only directly —\r\nthrough the death and devastation caused by the attacks\r\nthemselves — but also indirectly, by threatening to\r\nundermine the achievements of our societies in the\r\npromotion and protection of human rights.\r\nOur delegation supports the Secretary-General’s\r\nefforts to finalize a common strategy to deal with this\r\nmenace in full accordance with internationally agreed\r\nprinciples and standards of human rights law and\r\ninternational humanitarian law. We also remain hopeful\r\nthat the General Assembly will be able to come to an\r\nagreement on a comprehensive convention against\r\nterrorism, even if the precise definition of terrorism\r\ncontinues to elude us.\r\nA major task before us will be to carry out the\r\nprocess of institutional reform. In the outcome\r\ndocument, our leaders provided for the establishment\r\nof a Peacebuilding Commission in order to fill the\r\ninstitutional void that currently exists between the\r\nperspective of peace and security and the perspective\r\nof development in dealing with situations. The two\r\nperspectives are, of course, interrelated. Now we must\r\nset up the Commission’s standing organizational\r\ncommittee and elect its members in order to meet the\r\ndeadline to make the Commission operational by the\r\nend of this year. In considering the composition of that\r\ncommittee, the General Assembly must be careful not\r\nto curtail the participation of countries from the\r\ndeveloping world, particularly as we have already been\r\nplaying an increasing role in the field.\r\nOur political leaders also resolved to create a\r\nHuman Rights Council and have tasked us, under the\r\nable guidance of the President of the General\r\nAssembly, to engage in open, transparent and inclusive\r\nnegotiations to establish its mandate, modalities,\r\nfunctions, size, composition, membership, working\r\nmethods and procedures. As a measure to reinforce the\r\nstructures and mechanisms of the Organization in the\r\nhuman rights field, it is imperative that that Council be\r\nestablished on the basis of the principles of\r\nuniversality, dialogue and non-selectivity. In this\r\nrespect, we should also be careful not to set up a\r\nCouncil so small that it might compromise the ability\r\nto ensure balanced and adequate representation of all\r\nlegal systems or the presence of countries of the\r\ndeveloping world, where the issue of human rights is\r\nof keen interest to Governments and public alike.\r\nWe must also reinforce, adapt and update the\r\nOrganization’s current structures. Brazil is deeply\r\ninterested in the process of the revitalization of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. More than ever, the Assembly is\r\nneeded to provide leadership and political guidance to\r\nthe Organization as a whole. In successfully carrying\r\nout the tasks set for it by the Plenary Meeting, the\r\nAssembly will, in fact, be re-establishing its centrality\r\nin the work of the Organization.\r\nThe Economic and Social Council must regain its\r\ndynamism and influential role. It must be a forum for\r\ndiscussion and for the identification of common ground\r\namong the objectives of sustainable development, the\r\neradication of hunger and poverty, good governance\r\nand the reduction of inequalities, which are\r\nexacerbated by the process of globalization. As is\r\nrecognized in paragraph 53 of the outcome document\r\n(resolution 60), early reform of the Security Council is\r\n“an essential element of our overall effort to reform the\r\nUnited Nations”. We are all convinced of the need to\r\nmake the Council more representative and democratic.\r\nAs the Brazilian Foreign Minister, Ambassador\r\nCelso Amorim, stated in the 9th meeting, at the\r\nopening of the general debate:\r\n“At this historic juncture, no Security Council\r\nreform effort will be meaningful unless it\r\ncontemplates an increase in the number of\r\npermanent and non-permanent seats, with\r\ndeveloping countries from Africa, Latin America\r\nand Asia included in both categories. We cannot\r\naccept the perpetuation of imbalances that run\r\ncontrary to the very spirit of multilateralism.”\r\nWe trust that all those who are genuinely\r\ninterested in a true reform of the Organization — the\r\noverwhelming majority of the membership — will\r\ncontinue to strive for such an expansion of the Security\r\nCouncil. It is clear to all that no reform of the United\r\nNations will be complete without it.\r\nWith regard to management reform, we are\r\nconvinced that the Secretariat must be efficient,\r\neffective and accountable. Its staff should work in a\r\nculture of transparency, accountability and integrity, as\r\nwell as in accordance with the provisions of Article\r\n100 of the Charter. In the recruitment of staff, due\r\nregard must be paid to the principle of equitable\r\n7\r\nA/60/PV.25\r\ngeographical distribution at all levels. Coordination\r\nwithin the United Nations system in the fight against\r\nhunger and poverty — the first Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goal — must be urgently improved.\r\nProcurement policies must effectively incorporate, in a\r\nmore balanced way, suppliers from all regions,\r\nespecially developing countries. Brazil also supports\r\nthe strengthening of oversight in the United Nations by\r\nensuring the operational independence of the Office of\r\nInternal Oversight Services.\r\nFinally, we must point out that one major lacunas\r\nin the final outcome document is, of course, the\r\nomission of disarmament and non-proliferation.\r\nDespite the lack of agreement that led to such a\r\nregrettable result, we must emphasize that both items\r\nremain a high priority for Brazil and for the\r\ninternational community, and that they will require\r\ncontinued attention on the part of the Organization.\r\nProviding guidance in that respect is an additional\r\npressing challenge for the General Assembly at its\r\nsixtieth session.\r\nMr. İlkin (Turkey): I would like at the outset to\r\nthank the Secretary-General for his comprehensive\r\nreport on the work of the Organization (A/60/1) and to\r\ncommend him for his excellent work.\r\nI would also like to congratulate the President of\r\nthe General Assembly at its sixtieth session and to\r\nexpress my determination to work closely with him for\r\nthe realization of the Assembly’s goals. He has, indeed,\r\nthe full confidence and support of my mission.\r\nSince Turkey has aligned itself with the European\r\nUnion (EU) statement made this morning, I will limit\r\nmyself to making certain remarks to one particular\r\nsubject — terrorism.\r\nFirst of all, we believe that the targeting and\r\ndeliberate killing not only of civilians and non-\r\ncombatants but also military and security personnel\r\ncannot be justified or legitimized by any cause or\r\ngrievance. I would like to underline that once again. As\r\nwe have witnessed time and again, terrorism is a threat\r\nto the very existence of individuals, nations and human\r\ncivilization as a whole. Terrorism is a means of\r\noppression, which humiliates the individual and\r\nobstructs the development of humanity. It is a gross\r\nviolation of human rights, first and foremost the right\r\nto life. Thus, all terrorist acts, methods and practices\r\nshould be condemned as criminal and as unjustifiable\r\nunder any circumstances, regardless of their\r\nmotivation. No considerations whatsoever can be\r\ninvoked to justify terrorist acts.\r\nTurkey, as a country which has suffered from\r\nterrorism, has long pointed out the critical nature of the\r\nproblem and alerted the international community to\r\nthat scourge. Terrorism is the common problem of the\r\nwhole international community; no nation can consider\r\nitself immune.\r\nTurkey fully adheres to the Secretary-General’s\r\nfive-pillar strategy to combat terrorism. We also\r\nwelcome the clear condemnation of terrorism in the\r\nSummit Outcome (resolution 60/1). We are ready to\r\nwork with others to conclude, during the sixtieth\r\nsession, a comprehensive convention on international\r\nterrorism.\r\nMr. Acharya (Nepal): I wish to express my\r\nsincere appreciation for the manner in which the\r\nPresident has been conducting our work. His statement\r\nat the conclusion of the general debate aptly reflected\r\nthe mood of the deliberations of the Assembly.\r\nI would like to express our sincere thanks to the\r\nSecretary-General for his report on the work of the\r\nOrganization (A/60/1). The report is comprehensive\r\nand deals with a wide range of issues, including peace\r\nand security, development, the reform of the United\r\nNations and its management, and other international\r\nissues that are of great interest to all of us.\r\nMany of those important issues were reflected in\r\nthe outcome document of the recently concluded High-\r\nlevel Plenary Meeting, although many remain to be\r\nnegotiated further. The outcome document, although\r\nnot 100 per cent perfect, correctly reflects the hope and\r\naspirations of humanity for peace, security and\r\ndevelopment, and reiterates our commitment to\r\nachieving those goals in a time-bound manner.\r\nThe international community must provide its\r\ncontinued support to countries with special needs, such\r\nas the least developed and landlocked countries, so as\r\nto help them to achieve the Millennium Development\r\nGoals (MDGs). Such support can start with sincere\r\nimplementation of agreed commitments and the further\r\nextension of development assistance, market access\r\nand debt relief to those countries.\r\nThe outcome document categorically states that\r\nterrorism is the most serious threat to international\r\npeace and security. Nepal joins the international\r\ncommunity’s condemnation of terrorism in all its forms\r\n8\r\nA/60/PV.25\r\nand manifestations, committed by whomever, wherever\r\nand for whatever purposes, as reflected in the outcome\r\ndocument.\r\nA victim of senseless terror for more than a\r\ndecade now, Nepal favours combating terrorism\r\nresolutely, collectively and comprehensively. We\r\nsupport the early conclusion of a comprehensive\r\nconvention on international terrorism.\r\nWe appreciate the Secretary-General’s continued\r\ninterest and concern at Nepal’s current difficult\r\nsituation. In that context, our attention is drawn to a\r\nreference in the report of the Secretary-General about\r\nconstitutional rule in Nepal. We wish to clarify that the\r\nreport’s specific reference to constitutional rule does\r\nnot reflect factual reality. His Majesty the King is the\r\ncustodian of the 1990 Constitution of the Kingdom of\r\nNepal. The constitution is alive and active. The steps\r\nHis Majesty took on 1 February and later were guided\r\nby the constitutional obligation of His Majesty the\r\nKing as head of State to ensure the security and the\r\nintegrity of the nation and to create an atmosphere\r\nconducive to re-energizing multiparty democracy and\r\nthe rule of law, which had been frustrated by ongoing\r\nviolence, terrorism and corruption.\r\nNepal is committed to the protection and the\r\npromotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms.\r\nWe reaffirm our resolute commitment to the\r\nimplementation of human rights instruments and\r\ninternational humanitarian law. The establishment of\r\nan office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights\r\nin Nepal reflects our desire to protect human rights in\r\naccordance with our international legal obligations,\r\nalthough our respect for human rights is rooted in our\r\nlongstanding moral values and culture.\r\nWe welcome the international community’s\r\nhumanitarian assistance for internally displaced\r\npersons in Nepal.\r\nNepal welcomes the decision to establish a\r\nPeacebuilding Commission to help countries\r\nrecovering from conflict. We would like the\r\nCommission to have equitable representation from\r\ntroop-contributing countries and its working methods\r\nto be specified in clearer terms.\r\nWe are proud to recall our continuous\r\nparticipation in United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations since 1958. Our peacekeepers have earned\r\ncommendation from the international community for\r\ntheir dedication, discipline and professionalism.\r\nThis year, Nepal is celebrating its fiftieth year of\r\nmembership in the United Nations. Nepal expresses its\r\nsincere appreciation to the United Nations for its\r\ninvaluable contributions to our socio-economic\r\ndevelopment.\r\nWe believe that the package of reforms that are\r\nreflected in the Secretary-General’s report and which\r\nare to be agreed by the Assembly will help give the\r\nUnited Nations the required strength to meet the\r\nchallenges of our times.\r\nMr. Toro Jiménez (Bolivarian Republic of\r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): The delegation of the\r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela wishes to take the\r\nfloor of the General Assembly to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report on the work of the Organization\r\n(A/60/1).\r\nWe also take this opportunity to express our\r\nsupport for the statement made by the delegation of\r\nJamaica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nWe want to affirm our country’s support and\r\ncooperation in connection with the efforts and the work\r\nof the United Nations. Today, the plans to reform the\r\nUnited Nations harbour a grave threat to the future of\r\nthe Organization because of the proposals of those that\r\nview the United Nations as an instrument in the\r\nexclusive service of the interests of the United States\r\nand its allies. They see the United Nations as a piece of\r\nthe new neo-colonial order they wish to establish in the\r\nworld, allowing them to reorganize and divide up\r\nmarkets and areas of influence and thus achieve\r\nimperial hegemony, making good use of hollowed out\r\nmultilateral institutions that turn their back on the\r\npeople and work against their interests. That scheme\r\nwould exacerbate the already profound world\r\nimbalance as they introduced new mechanisms of\r\ninterference and repression — in particular by\r\nstrengthening the Security Council — to be used to\r\nundermine the sovereign authority of Member States of\r\nthe United Nations on the pretext of fighting terrorism.\r\nVenezuela believes that the United Nations\r\nshould be the principal democratic organization of a\r\ndemocratic international society that is supported in its\r\nsocio-economic development. We believe that\r\nmultilateralism should provide the instrument and the\r\nforum for creating a multipolar, independent and\r\n9\r\nA/60/PV.25\r\npeaceful world of solidarity. Our international action\r\nshould be guided by the overriding imperative of\r\npromoting international cooperation aimed at\r\nstrengthening South-South cooperation, with the\r\nfundamental goal of combating poverty and social\r\nexclusion, which impede the self-determination of our\r\npeoples and pose a grave threat to the democratic\r\nstability of States.\r\nVenezuela believes that those goals can be\r\nachieved only through concrete economic and social\r\npolicies for the inclusion and empowerment of the\r\npeople and through wise, democratic government that\r\nis closely aligned with the people, who should have a\r\nparticipatory, leading role in all collective political\r\ndecisions at all levels. Implementing such policies\r\nrequires the massive mobilization of resources for\r\ndevelopment, coordination among developing countries\r\nand concerted efforts between the developing and the\r\ndeveloped countries, because developed countries bear\r\nthe greater share of responsibility for creating a new\r\nworld whose highest priority is economic progress and\r\nsocial justice. Taking measures to eradicate poverty —\r\nand thus redress an age-old injustice — will lay the\r\nfoundation for a human and just new world order.\r\nNothing could lie further from the sincere call for the\r\nOrganization to take up the noble, humanitarian task\r\nthat we have described, and to which we are all\r\ncommitted, than the dark panorama of the present\r\nUnited Nations reform and the final result of the High-\r\nlevel Plenary Meeting.\r\nWe are referring to the outcome document that\r\nwas presented in the Assembly and which is defective\r\nowing to its violation of the universal law of respect\r\nfor due process. For that reason, my delegation\r\nreaffirms our President’s reservations with respect to a\r\ndocument that our Republic considers null and void in\r\nthe context of the upcoming negotiations, as he noted\r\nin the Assembly.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General on the work\r\nof the Organization poorly reflects the devastating state\r\nof the world and the universal Organization, which is\r\ncalled upon to enforce respect for the fundamental\r\nvalues of its Charter in the face of the corrosive action\r\nthat is destroying, day by day and in an accelerating\r\nfashion, human beings, living organisms, the seas,\r\nwater and productive land — all of which support the\r\nlife of humankind on Earth. That corrosive action\r\nseems to be sweeping us, with no hope of escape,\r\ntowards a vortex of destruction.\r\nRegrettably, when we contemplate that situation\r\nwe are overwhelmed by sadness that an Organization\r\nsuch as the United Nations should be so submissive, so\r\nbowed under the weight of its own complacency, that it\r\napplauds its own ignominious situation along the path\r\nto the scaffold.\r\nVenezuela has made substantial efforts to combat\r\npoverty — as is plain for all to see if they look with\r\nunbiased eyes — despite anti-national, subversive acts\r\nthat from 2002 onwards have been aimed at\r\nundermining the democratic stability of my country\r\nand continue to be perpetrated with the financial\r\nsupport of non-governmental organizations assisted by\r\nthe United States Government.\r\nIn that connection, the Bolivarian Republic of\r\nVenezuela would like to place on record that we do not\r\nagree with the way in which the United Nations\r\nindicators and methods are crafted to handle and\r\nevaluate statistical data that measure implementation of\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). We do\r\nnot agree as to the form, the manner or the substance in\r\nwhich the information was presented in the report of\r\nthe Secretary-General. We do not agree with the\r\nmonetarist bias of indicators to measure poverty that\r\nare linked to the dollar and that do not allow us to\r\nquantify the outcome of public policies that address\r\nthat topic in a comprehensive manner.\r\nIn the same vein, there is no way of describing\r\nthe scope of social policies, specifically missions, nor\r\nthe role that they play to achieve sustainable, humane\r\nand endogenous development that contributes to the\r\nattainment of the MDGs. We protest the handling of\r\nstatistics and the methodological perspective that does\r\nnot make it possible to consider the specific, concrete\r\nsocio-political realities of Venezuela, or any other\r\ncountry.\r\nIn our case, the events since December 2001 —\r\nfrom the coup d’état of April 2002 to the defeat of the\r\nattempted takeover launched by the oil interests in\r\n2003 — were a fundamental element that reversed\r\nwhat was until then the positive trends in the country\r\ntowards achieving the MDGs. We compare our\r\nsituation to that of Asia since the tsunami and wonder\r\nif the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and\r\nthe Pacific, in its next report, should not refer to that\r\nhistorical reality, which will certainly damage social\r\nand economic growth in the affected countries during\r\nthe period under consideration. For our country, the\r\n10\r\nA/60/PV.25\r\nevents of the years 2002 and 2003 were equivalent to a\r\ntsunami.\r\nFinally, we would like to say that the proposal to\r\nset up a new Human Rights Council with the idea of a\r\nsimplistic transition from the current Human Rights\r\nCommission is not going to solve existing problems.\r\nWhat we have before us is not a problem of\r\nsemantics — of terms, structures or procedures. Any\r\nreforms proposed for the current Human Rights\r\nCommission should essentially be designed to bring\r\nabout profound political changes and, of course, should\r\nexpand its membership.\r\nMr. Belinga Eboutou (Cameroon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): First of all, I would like to thank the\r\nSecretary-General for his excellent analytical report on\r\nthe work of the Organization. That report gives us a\r\nvery in-depth overview and a great deal of information\r\non all facets of United Nations activity. Of course, my\r\ndelegation joins in the statement made by Jamaica on\r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China. The report, along\r\nwith the outcome document adopted at the end of the\r\nrecent High-level Plenary Meeting, will be of the\r\ngreatest usefulness in our deliberations.\r\nIn the area of the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security, the Secretary-General points out\r\nthat during the past year most situations in that domain\r\nhave improved. However, he also points out that others\r\nhave unfortunately deteriorated. United Nations action,\r\nalong with the political determination of the parties to\r\na conflict to fulfil their commitments, and that of\r\ninterested actors who have used all of their influence to\r\nresolve the situation, has been decisive in improving\r\nthe climate of peace. My delegation agrees with that\r\nanalysis. I would like to commend all United Nations\r\nactivities undertaken throughout the world to prevent\r\nconflicts and to restore, maintain and consolidate\r\npeace. In that connection, we encourage parties to\r\nongoing conflicts to demonstrate the political will to\r\nsettle their differences peacefully and to make use of\r\nthe good offices of the United Nations.\r\nCameroon welcomes the electoral assistance\r\ngiven by the United Nations to Africa. As the\r\nSecretary-General noted, the holding of credible\r\nelections has today become an essential element in the\r\nrestoration and consolidation of peace, as well as in the\r\nprevention of conflicts. Cameroon encourages the\r\nOrganization to continue working along those lines and\r\nfor its part will continue to support the inclusion of\r\nelectoral support in the mandates of peacekeeping\r\noperations and in political agreements concluded in\r\ncountries in conflict or those emerging from conflict\r\nthat are in political transition.\r\nMore specifically with regard to peacekeeping\r\noperations, my delegation is in favour of strengthening\r\nAfrican capacity in that sphere, including through\r\ncooperation with regional organizations. Such\r\ncapacity-building should necessarily include provision\r\nfor the establishment of African contingents and the\r\nimprovement of their ability to respond rapidly on the\r\nground. Indeed, Africa’s autonomy in the area of\r\npeacekeeping is a necessity. It is part of the list of\r\nspecial needs of Africa in the areas of peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nIn the area of cooperation for development, the\r\nSecretary-General advocates, with regard to Africa’s\r\nspecial needs, international support for the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). The\r\nSecretary-General’s report, which makes\r\nrecommendations on the way to mobilize such support,\r\nwill be considered during the current session and my\r\ndelegation will make substantive comments on the item\r\nat that time.\r\nNEPAD will be a powerful engine for\r\ndevelopment in Africa if African debt on the condition\r\nthat debt is alleviated or even cancelled, that assistance\r\nincreases considerably, and that growth and the combat\r\nagainst poverty are stimulated through equitable\r\nparticipation in world trade.\r\nCameroon welcomed with satisfaction the\r\nconfirmation of the cancellation of 100 per cent of the\r\ndebt owed to the International Monetary Fund, the\r\nWorld Bank and the African Development Bank by a\r\nnumber of heavily indebted poor countries. We believe\r\nthat this measure is a promising one that should be\r\nextended speedily to additional countries. In that\r\nconnection, we have high hopes for the meeting to be\r\nheld this weekend in London.\r\nMy delegation has taken due note of the contents\r\nof paragraph 25 of the report of the Secretary-General\r\non the work of the Organization. In that paragraph, the\r\nSecretary-General deals with the implementation of the\r\n10 October 2002 ruling by the International Court of\r\nJustice regarding the territorial dispute between\r\nCameroon and Nigeria. I should like to express my\r\ncountry’s appreciation and gratitude to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his good offices and for the ongoing\r\n11\r\nA/60/PV.25\r\ninterest he has shown in the implementation of that\r\ndecision. I should like to take this opportunity to\r\nreaffirm Cameroon’s resolute determination — which,\r\nin fact, is noted in the report, to “moving the process\r\nforward in accordance with the ruling of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice”.\r\nWe welcome the Secretary-General’s decision to\r\nreport on his work with regard to this dispute in the\r\npart of his report devoted to conflict prevention and to\r\nthe restoration of peace.\r\nCameroon wishes to reiterate the proposal it\r\nmade in this very Hall on 23 September 2005, during\r\nthe general debate. My country, as members will recall,\r\nemphasized the need fully to inform Member States,\r\nthe Security Council and the General Assembly of the\r\nstatus of the implementation of the rulings handed\r\ndown by the International Court of Justice, just as\r\nthose organs are informed of the Court’s annual\r\nactivities.\r\nImplementation of the rulings of the International\r\nCourt of Justice — for which it is not responsible —\r\nremains of pivotal importance to international peace\r\nand security, because a dispute does not end, and is not\r\nconsidered to have ended, until the Court’s ruling has\r\nbeen fully implemented.\r\nThe situation resulting from the non-\r\nimplementation, for an extended period, of a ruling can\r\njeopardize international peace and security. That is\r\nwhy my country believes that the Secretary-General\r\nmust regularly inform, in detail, the Security Council\r\nof the status of decisions handed down by the Court\r\nand inform Member States in his report to the General\r\nAssembly on the work of the Organization, whether or\r\n not the Organization is directly involved in the\r\nimplementation process.\r\nWe believe that all States should be informed of\r\nwhat is being done to achieve peace so that they can\r\nassist the protagonists involved by lending support and\r\nadvice.\r\nMr. President, we hope that our request will be\r\nincluded among the conclusions that you will be\r\ndrawing from this debate. If, indeed, responsibility for\r\ninternational peace and security falls on each and every\r\nMember State, the implementation of the Court’s\r\nrulings — rulings which contribute to it — are just as\r\nimportant.\r\nIn conclusion, Cameroon supports the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s appeal to reflect, at this sixtieth anniversary\r\nof the United Nations, on ways in which we could\r\nbetter discharge our duties and responsibilities. We\r\nremain convinced that, without the support and\r\ncooperation of Member States, the United Nations will\r\nnot be in a position to face the challenges of this new\r\ncentury or to meet the expectations of peoples in the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that the\r\nGeneral Assembly takes note of the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization\r\ncontained in document A/60/1?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is the\r\nwish of the General Assembly to conclude its\r\nconsideration of agenda item 110?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 4.20 p.m.\r\n"
