(Sweden)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.15 p.m.\r\nBombing in Bali\r\nThe President: Before turning to the business of\r\nthe day, I would like to take a moment to pay tribute to\r\nthose affected by the abhorrent terrorist attacks that\r\noccurred on the Indonesian island of Bali on Saturday.\r\nOn behalf of the Assembly I offer our deepest\r\nsympathy to the people and Government of Indonesia\r\nand to the friends and families of those affected, of all\r\nnationalities. I should also take this opportunity to\r\nextend our sympathy to the victims of other recent\r\nterrorist attacks, wherever they have been committed.\r\nAgenda item 7 (continued)\r\nOrganization of work, adoption of the agenda and\r\nallocation of items: request for the inclusion of an\r\nadditional item\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/60/231)\r\nThe President: The General Assembly will now\r\ntake up a request submitted by the Secretary-General in\r\ndocument A/60/231 relating to the election of judges of\r\nthe International Tribunal for the Prosecution of\r\nPersons Responsible for Serious Violations of\r\nInternational Humanitarian Law Committed in the\r\nTerritory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991.\r\nIn his note the Secretary-General informs the\r\nGeneral Assembly that he has requested both the\r\nSecurity Council and the Assembly to authorize the\r\nassignment of Judge Christine Van Den Wyngaert to\r\nserve as of 3 October 2005 on the Mrksic case before\r\nthe International Tribunal.\r\nConsequently, it will be necessary at the current\r\nsession to take a decision to allow Judge Van Den\r\nWyngaert to serve as of 3 October 2005 on the Mrksic\r\ncase.\r\nIn this connection, the Secretary-General has the\r\nhonour to request, pursuant to rule 15 of the rules of\r\nprocedure of the General Assembly, the inclusion in\r\nthe agenda of the sixtieth session of the Assembly of\r\nan additional item entitled “Election of judges of the\r\nInternational Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons\r\nResponsible for Serious Violations of International\r\nHumanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the\r\nFormer Yugoslavia since 1991”.\r\nOwing to the important and urgent nature of the\r\nitem, and in the absence of objection, may I take it that\r\nthe General Assembly agrees that the relevant\r\nprovision of rule 40 of the rules of procedure, which\r\nwould require a meeting of the General Committee on\r\nthe question of the inclusion of this item in the agenda,\r\ncould be waived?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: May I take it that the General\r\nAssembly, on the proposal of the Secretary-General,\r\nwishes to include in the agenda of the current session\r\nan additional item entitled “Election of judges of the\r\nInternational Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons\r\nResponsible for Serious Violations of International\r\nHumanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the\r\n2\r\nA/60/PV.26\r\nFormer Yugoslavia since 1991” under heading I,\r\n“Organizational, administrative and other matters”?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: The item is therefore included in\r\nthe agenda as item 157.\r\nIn his note, the Secretary-General further requests\r\nthat the item be considered directly in plenary meeting.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly, as requested\r\nby the Secretary-General, wishes to consider this item\r\ndirectly in plenary meeting?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I should now like to consult\r\nmembers with regard to proceeding immediately to the\r\nconsideration of agenda item 157. In this connection, I\r\ndraw the Assembly’s attention to the relevant provision\r\nof rule 15 of the rules of procedure of the General\r\nAssembly, which reads as follows:\r\n“No additional item may, unless the General\r\nAssembly decides otherwise by a two-thirds\r\nmajority of the members present and voting, be\r\nconsidered until seven days have elapsed since it\r\nwas placed on the agenda and until a committee\r\nhas reported upon the question concerned.”\r\nIn the absence of an objection, I shall take it that\r\nthe Assembly agrees to proceed immediately to the\r\nconsideration of agenda item 157.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 157\r\nElection of judges of the International Tribunal for\r\nthe Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious\r\nViolations of International Humanitarian Law\r\nCommitted in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia\r\nsince 1991\r\nLetter from the Secretary-General (A/60/362)\r\nLetter from the President of the Security\r\nCouncil (A/60/402)\r\nThe President: As indicated in the note by the\r\nSecretary-General contained in document A/60/231,\r\nthe Secretary-General informs the Assembly that Judge\r\nVan Den Wyngaert’s term of office as a member of the\r\npool of ad litem judges had come to an end on 11 June\r\n2005. She was authorized, however, by Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1581 (2005) and by a decision of\r\nthe General Assembly taken at its 80th plenary\r\nmeeting, on 20 January 2005, to continue her functions\r\nas an ad litem judge in the Limaj case beyond that date.\r\nOn 19 November 2004, Judge Van Den Wyngaert had\r\nbeen elected a permanent judge of the International\r\nTribunal with a term beginning on 17 November 2005.\r\nConsequently, the approval of the Security\r\nCouncil and the General Assembly is needed to allow\r\nJudge Van Den Wyngaert to serve as of 3 October 2005\r\non the Mrksic case, given that she has been authorized\r\nto continue her functions only as an ad litem judge in\r\nthe Limaj case and that she will begin her elected four-\r\nyear term as a permanent judge of the International\r\nTribunal only on 17 November 2005. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral therefore proposes that the General Assembly\r\nand the Security Council authorize the assignment of\r\nJudge Van Den Wyngaert to serve as of 3 October 2005\r\non the Mrksic case before the International Tribunal.\r\nIn the letter addressed to the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly contained in document A/60/402,\r\nthe President of the Security Council transmits the text\r\nof Council resolution 1629 (2005) of 30 September\r\n2005, whereby the Council, inter alia:\r\n“Decides that notwithstanding Article 12 of\r\nthe Statute of the International Tribunal for the\r\nFormer Yugoslavia and notwithstanding that\r\nJudge Christine Van Den Wyngaert’s elected term\r\nas a permanent judge of the Tribunal will in\r\naccordance with Article 13 bis of the Tribunal’s\r\nStatute only begin on 17 November 2005, she be\r\nassigned as a permanent judge to the Mrksic et al.\r\ncase which is due to commence on 3 October\r\n2005.”\r\nIf there is no objection, I propose that the Assembly\r\ndecide to endorse the recommendation of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that was endorsed by the Security Council in its\r\nresolution 1629 (2005) of 30 September 2005.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: May I take it that it is the wish of\r\nthe General Assembly to conclude its consideration of\r\nagenda item 157?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I invite members to remain\r\nseated, as immediately following the adjournment of\r\nthis meeting the General Assembly will hold its first\r\ninformal meeting of the plenary to discuss the follow-\r\nup and implementation of the 2005 World Summit\r\nOutcome.\r\nThe meeting rose at 3.20 p.m.\r\n"
