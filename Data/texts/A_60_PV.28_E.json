(Sweden)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.15 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 62 (continued)\r\nSocial development, including questions relating to\r\nthe world social situation and to youth, ageing,\r\ndisabled persons and the family\r\nTwo plenary meetings devoted to the evaluation\r\nof the progress made in the implementation of\r\nthe World Programme of Action for Youth to\r\nthe Year 2000 and Beyond\r\nReports of the Secretary-General (A/60/61,\r\nA/60/133 and Corr.1, and A/60/156)\r\nDraft resolution (A/60/L.2)\r\nMs. Mouro (Portugal) (spoke in French): On\r\nbehalf of the Portuguese Government, I have been\r\ndesignated to represent Portuguese youth during this\r\nspecial meeting of the General Assembly devoted to\r\nyouth.\r\nI wish to associate myself with the statement\r\nmade by the youth representative of the United\r\nKingdom on behalf of the European Union.\r\nIn recent years much work has been done to\r\nreaffirm youth policies, particularly as concerns the\r\nobjectives set out in the World Programme of Action\r\nfor Youth, including the Millennium Development\r\nGoals (MDGs). As citizens of the world, we want to\r\nexpress our ideas and feelings and to create the\r\nnecessary conditions for the participation of young\r\npeople in society.\r\nWe believe that we need more than just\r\nrecognition. Young people represent an important\r\nsocial group and should enjoy the right to participate\r\nand state their views on all aspects of society relevant\r\nto them. It is not enough to have a youth policy. Young\r\npeople must to be involved in the formulation and\r\nimplementation of the policies that affect them,\r\nincluding through credible, accountable, autonomous\r\nand independent youth organizations.\r\nThe promotion of the protection of, and respect\r\nfor, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all\r\nyoung people form the basis of our national youth\r\npolicy. It is of utmost importance that human rights be\r\nimplemented and safeguarded in order to improve\r\nyoung peoples lives as well as ensure their civil,\r\npolitical, economic, social and cultural rights.\r\nWith regard to the implementation of the World\r\nProgramme of Action for Youth, the Portuguese\r\nGovernment, together with the National Youth Council,\r\nhas developed developing a series of activities and\r\nprojects aimed at the Programmes implementation. We\r\nheld a seminar on Young people and sexuality,\r\nwhose conclusions reiterated the importance and\r\nurgency of campaigns to inform young people about\r\nsexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS, as well\r\nas unplanned pregnancy.\r\nWe have recently relaunched our Different but\r\nequal campaign, which addresses the problems of\r\n2\r\nA/60/PV.28\r\nxenophobia, racism and cultural and gender\r\ndiscrimination.\r\nSustainable development is also a key issue for\r\nus. We have published a book on the topic that has\r\nbeen distributed in schools throughout the country and\r\nhas been made available to all youth institutions. That\r\nbook will serve as a tool to raise the awareness of, and\r\nsensitize Portuguese youth to, that issue.\r\nThe Portuguese youth policy takes a cross-\r\nsectoral approach and encompasses important areas\r\naffecting young peoples lives. In recent years, the\r\nPortuguese Government, in close cooperation with the\r\nNational Youth Council, supported the holding of\r\nsignificant international youth meetings, particularly\r\nthe World Youth Festival; the first World Conference\r\nof Ministers Responsible for Youth, which issued the\r\nLisbon Declaration; the Community of Portuguese-\r\nspeaking Countries Youth Conference; and the most\r\nrecent consultative meeting on the 10-year review of\r\nthe World Programme of Action for Youth, held at\r\nCoimbra last January, which issued a number of\r\nrecommendations on the Programme of Action.\r\nDuring the Coimbra meeting, we had the\r\nopportunity, for the first time, to engage in a genuine\r\nexchange of views between United Nations agencies\r\nand youth organizations on the implementation of the\r\nProgramme.\r\nAt the international level, our National Youth\r\nCouncil has been cooperating with the Community of\r\nPortuguese-speaking Countries on two objectives. The\r\nfirst relates to the mobility of young Portuguese\r\nspeakers, and the second is a project aimed at\r\ninforming, warning and educating young people about\r\nHIV/AIDS.\r\nWe have done a great deal over the past 10 years\r\nto promote and implement the World Programme of\r\nAction, but much more must be done. We will continue\r\nto do our share to achieve the goals that are our\r\ncommon responsibility.\r\nThe participation of young people in decision-\r\nmaking processes is one of the key priority areas of the\r\nUnited Nations agenda on youth. We therefore urge\r\nnational Governments to continue to include youth\r\nrepresentatives in their national delegations to\r\nimportant international events, including sessions of\r\nthe General Assembly and of the Commission for\r\nSocial Development.\r\nYouth representatives can take home to their\r\nrespective countries knowledge that can then be\r\ntransmitted to other young people, thereby creating an\r\nopportunity to motivate increasing numbers of young\r\npeople to become involved in the shaping of their\r\nfuture.\r\nYouth representatives can also make significant\r\ninputs to discussions held in the context of various\r\ninstitutions. We will continue our work and remain\r\ncommitted to working with international institutions.\r\nWe are cooperating with, among others, the European\r\nYouth Forum.\r\nWe reaffirm the commitments we have\r\nundertaken in the context of the World Programme of\r\nAction for Youth and its five priorities. We remain\r\ncommitted to the Millennium Development Goals, and\r\nwe ask the United Nations to assist Member States and\r\nyouth organizations in the implementation of a\r\ncomprehensive, cross-sectoral youth policy capable of\r\nreaching young people everywhere.\r\nYoung people must be considered part of the\r\nsolution, and not a problem.\r\nThe President: Before giving the floor to the\r\nnext speaker, I should like to inform members that\r\nthere are a large number of speakers on our list for this\r\nmeeting. In order to accommodate all the speakers, and\r\ntaking into account that we must allow time for the\r\nconsideration of draft resolution A/60/L.2, and for the\r\nexercise of the right of reply, I strongly urge speakers\r\nto limit their statements to four minutes.\r\nMs. Taracena Secaira (Guatemala) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): I should like at the outset to reiterate what\r\nwas expressed by the representative of Argentina on\r\nbehalf of the Rio Group, who explained the situation of\r\nyoung people in the region. To evaluate the situation of\r\nthe worlds young people is to evaluate the future of\r\nthe world. It is to analyse where we are and where we\r\nwant to go, because todays young people represent the\r\nfuture of humanity and of the world.\r\nIf, as stated in the report of the Secretary-General\r\n(A/60/61), young people represent 18 per cent of the\r\nworld\u0027s population and 85 per cent of them live in\r\ndeveloping countries, the future is in our hands. That is\r\na great responsibility not only for our own countries,\r\nbut for everyone. It is a challenge that is not only\r\nnational, but global.\r\n3\r\nA/60/PV.28\r\nGuatemala has understood that very well. That is\r\nwhy, two years ago, we launched the national youth\r\npolicy, aimed at the comprehensive and sustainable\r\ndevelopment of the Guatemalan young people\r\nparticipating in it. Although young people represent 70\r\nper cent of my countrys current population, they did\r\nnot have access to comprehensive strategies or\r\nprogrammes until now.\r\nThis is the first national youth policy that has\r\nbeen established in Guatemala. We are proud to have\r\ndeveloped it with broad participation by\r\nrepresentatives of my countrys diverse ethnic and\r\nlinguistic groups and with the assistance of an\r\ninteragency coordination effort. Participating in its\r\ncreation were 10 ministries; three State secretariats; the\r\nSupreme Court of Justice; 48 youth representatives of\r\nthe linguistic communities of the Mayan, Garifuna and\r\nXinca peoples, as proposed by the Mayan Language\r\nAcademy of Guatemala; the Council of the Xinca\r\nPeople and the Organization of Black Guatemalans; 12\r\nyouth representatives of the political parties; and 311\r\ncivil society organizations active in areas pertaining to\r\nyouth  all of them under the coordination of the\r\nNational Youth Council of Guatemala.\r\nThrough the policy, we seek to implement the\r\nprinciples of solidarity and inclusion of President\r\nOscar Berger Perdomos governmental plan for 2004-\r\n2008  whose agenda accords priority to young\r\npeople and to the World Programme of Action for\r\nYouth to the Year 2000 and Beyond  and to assist in\r\nthe achievement of the Millennium Development\r\nGoals. We are aware that we can achieve the Goals\r\nonly if all sectors of society are involved.\r\nThe policys purpose is to direct the efforts of the\r\nState towards improving young peoples quality of life,\r\npromoting their comprehensive development and\r\nbroadening their opportunities to build unity in\r\ndiversity and to become good citizens. We need young\r\npeople to take responsibility for facilitating and\r\nmaking the transition from lacking access to\r\nopportunities to fully exercising their rights and\r\ncitizenship.\r\nThe national youth policy is based on four\r\nprinciples: the principle of human rights, in which\r\nyoung people are seen as having individual and\r\ncollective civil, political, cultural, economic and social\r\nrights; the principle of multiculturalism, which\r\nrecognizes the diversity of the peoples and cultures that\r\ntogether form one nation and that build unity out of\r\ndiversity, knowledge, understanding and mutual\r\nrespect among the various cultures and civilizations\r\nthat are a basic characteristic of my country; the\r\nprinciple of sustainability, which sets out basic\r\nguidelines for sustainable development, as they relate\r\nto economic organization, the relationship with the\r\nnatural environment, social and political organization\r\nand cultural aspects; and the principle of\r\nintergenerational cooperation, which fosters relations\r\nof solidarity, cooperation and mutual respect among\r\nvarious age groups, recognizing that each group has\r\nimportant values to share with and teach to other\r\ngenerations.\r\nThe national youth policy focuses on six areas:\r\ngender, the life cycle, comprehensiveness and\r\ninclusion, the family, the multisectoral approach and\r\nterritoriality. It also has 11 components, including\r\ncitizen participation, multiculturalism, community\r\nsecurity and justice, scientific and technological\r\neducation and development, integral and differentiated\r\nhealth care, employment and work, and starting a\r\nbusiness and competitiveness.\r\nWe are pleased that the draft resolution on which\r\nwe will take a decision at this meeting will emphasize\r\nthe importance of employment and work. Our young\r\npeople need decent work that will remove them from\r\nthe risks and dangers of idleness, which include\r\nfrustration, vagrancy, drug abuse, HIV/AIDS infection,\r\ngang membership, violence and delinquency.\r\nI cannot fail to emphasize that during the process\r\nof elaborating Guatemalas national youth policy, a\r\ngender perspective was incorporated as a norm for\r\nparticipation, requiring equal numbers of women and\r\nmen from all participating organizations. Guatemalan\r\nyoung people thus provided us with a valuable lesson\r\nthat should be taken into account by the rest of society.\r\nNor can I fail to mention the national and international\r\ncooperative entities that took part in this process,\r\nincluding the Guatemalan Indigenous Development\r\nFund, the United Nations Population Fund, UNICEF,\r\nthe German Agency for Technical Cooperation and the\r\nIberoamerican Youth Organization. Many thanks go to\r\nall of them.\r\nFinally, I must tell the Assembly how much I\r\nregret having been the one to make this statement in\r\nthis Hall, because my Government would have\r\npreferred that a representative of Guatemalan youth\r\n4\r\nA/60/PV.28\r\ncould have come. But the problem was a lack of\r\nresources, not a lack of willingness. That is why we\r\nsupport the initiative to create a United Nations youth\r\nfund that would facilitate economic assistance for\r\nyouth representatives of developing countries and give\r\nthem the opportunity to participate in all United\r\nNations forums directly concerning them. However, I\r\nam very proud to have been able to share with\r\nmembers what young people are doing in Guatemala.\r\nThe President: I note the representatives plea\r\nfor facilities to make it possible for young people to\r\nattend functions of this nature.\r\nMr. Chaimongkol (Thailand): At the outset, my\r\ndelegation would like to extend a very warm welcome\r\nto all the youth representatives, whose young faces\r\nremind us of the very purpose of our gathering here\r\ntoday. In fact, the General Assembly can benefit\r\ngreatly by listening to them, as our young partners in\r\nworking for the future.\r\nThe world we live in today is very different from\r\nthat of 1995 when the World Programme of Action for\r\nYouth to the Year 2000 and Beyond was adopted.\r\nTherefore, it is timely for us all to take stock of that\r\ninstruments implementation during the past decade\r\nand to assess its actual impact on the lives of young\r\npersons, who make up approximately one fifth of the\r\nworlds population. The occasion also provides us with\r\nan opportunity to highlight new challenges that many\r\nyoung people around the world are facing  often in\r\nsilence or with their voices unheard.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the Secretary-Generals\r\nWorld Youth Report 2005 (A/60/61), and his report on\r\nthe global analysis and evaluation of national action\r\nplans on youth employment (A/60/133). Both of those\r\nreports are comprehensive and can serve as suitable\r\nstarting points for further discussions on the situation\r\nof youth today. In addition, my delegation welcomes\r\nthe Secretary-Generals report, Making commitments\r\nmatter: young peoples input to the 10-year review of\r\nthe World Programme of Action for Youth to the Year\r\n2000 and Beyond (A/60/156), as well as the informal\r\ninteractive round table organized on that theme \r\nYoung People: Making Commitments Matter  held\r\non 5 October, both of which provide us with useful\r\nyouth perspectives on various issues of direct concern\r\nto young people themselves.\r\nAlthough it is evident that progress on youth\r\ndevelopment has been made on many fronts, many\r\nchallenges still remain. On the economic front, it was\r\nreported that 515 million young people  or nearly 45\r\nper cent of youth worldwide  live on less than $2 a\r\nday, with almost half of that population living on less\r\nthan $1 a day. While it is acknowledged that education\r\nis one of the keys to alleviating poverty, it must also be\r\nemphasized that poverty is a major obstacle to\r\neducation. A young person whose basic needs for food,\r\nclothing and shelter are not met cannot reasonably be\r\nexpected to attend school or pursue education. In many\r\npoverty-stricken families young persons are taken out\r\nof school to help support their families. Therefore, it is\r\nnecessary to effectively tackle poverty at the same time\r\nthat we enhance access to all levels of education. By\r\nthe same token, I do strongly believe that education\r\nwill open up opportunities for all.\r\nMr. Kyaw Tint Swe (Myanmar), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nYouth employment can serve as a tool for\r\ndevelopment. However, young persons in many parts\r\nof the world still face unemployment and\r\nunderemployment. That fact inevitably hinders the\r\ndevelopment process and increases the vulnerability of\r\nyouth to other kinds of social and political problems,\r\nincluding drug addiction and trafficking, human\r\nsmuggling and trafficking, and recruitment into armed\r\nconflicts. For that reason, youth need to be empowered\r\nso that they can obtain knowledge and skills that meet\r\nthe employment needs of the marketplace. At the same\r\ntime, it is incumbent upon Governments to create\r\ndecent employment opportunities for young persons. In\r\nthat respect, my delegation welcomes the inclusion of\r\nthe issue of youth employment in the World Summit\r\nOutcome. We owe it to all young persons to put the\r\ncommitments our leaders have collectively undertaken\r\ninto practice.\r\nIn 2002, Thailand adopted a national policy and\r\n10-year plan of action on children and youth to\r\npromote the role of the family in supporting and\r\nbuilding the capacity of young persons. In addition,\r\nvarious organizations that promote youth development\r\nhave been supported and encouraged to coordinate\r\ntheir activities. Most importantly, the national policy\r\nand plan of action aim to empower young persons\r\nthemselves with the relevant skills and knowledge so\r\nthat they can make informed choices and decisions on\r\nmatters relating to their own lives, as well as to society\r\nas a whole.\r\n5\r\nA/60/PV.28\r\nYouth is a critical period in life. It is when we\r\nmake that important transition from childhood into\r\nadulthood. Young persons are full of aspirations,\r\nenergy, and potential. They can contribute to all\r\naspects of societys development. It is therefore crucial\r\nthat we do not squander this opportunity to invest in\r\nthe future. We must ensure that the basic needs and\r\nrights of the worlds youth are guaranteed, so that they\r\nmay attain their aspirations, fully utilize their energy,\r\nand fulfil their potential. The ways and means may\r\nvary according to the situations of each society, but our\r\nobjective must be the same: to empower our youth, so\r\nthat they may contribute to creating a more peaceful,\r\nprosperous and democratic world.\r\nMs. Meena (United Republic of Tanzania): I am\r\nhonoured to read a statement on behalf of the young\r\npeople of the United Republic of Tanzania, and I am\r\ngrateful that the Government of the United Republic of\r\nTanzania for giving us this opportunity to be heard. We\r\nalso thank the United Nations for giving youth\r\ndelegates the opportunity to participate and request all\r\nGovernments to continue to send youth delegates to\r\nfuture United Nations meetings.\r\nYouth constitute almost a third of the total\r\npopulation of the United Republic of Tanzania, and\r\ncomprise 65 per cent of the labour force. We are thus a\r\nforce to be reckoned with: we need to be heard in all\r\ndecision-making processes, and to have youth issues\r\nmainstreamed into national development policies,\r\nstrategies and programmes.\r\nThe Government of Tanzania has taken several\r\nmeasures to improve the situation of youth. However,\r\nmany challenges still remain. Our country is still poor.\r\nIt is confronted both with a heavy debt burden and a\r\ndifficult struggle against diseases such as HIV/AIDS\r\nand malaria that affect a large segment of the youth\r\npopulation. Assisting the capacity of the Government\r\nto implement the Millennium Development Goals and\r\nthe World Programme of Action on Youth is, in the\r\nend, to support our youth.\r\nThe majority of my fellow young people live in\r\nrural areas. Addressing the inequities and imbalances\r\nin development opportunities between rural and urban\r\nareas has to be given priority in order to curb the\r\nproblem of rural-to-urban immigration. In view of a\r\ngrowing trend in this area, we are observing rapid\r\ngrowth in the urban informal sector and an increase in\r\nthe incidence of hazardous employment and crime.\r\nProductive and decent work for young people has to be\r\naddressed as a strategy in poverty reduction and\r\nsustainable development. There is thus also a need to\r\nfoster day-to-day growth of the informal sector through\r\nentrepreneurship development, infrastructure\r\ndevelopment and provision of capital.\r\nWe agree with the observation that globalization\r\ncreates both opportunities and challenges. We need to\r\nbe able to enhance our effective participation as well as\r\nincrease our capacities to take advantage of\r\nopportunities in the national and global economies. If\r\nthe quality of education in our countries is not\r\nimproved and the digital divide not bridged, youth in\r\nthe developing countries will continue to be spectators\r\nand will remain excluded from the economy.\r\nAs young people, we recognize that we too have\r\nresponsibilities to be good citizens, to respect the rule\r\nof law in our societies and to contribute to the welfare\r\nof our communities. It is important for us to be\r\norganized and strive to participate fully in the social,\r\neconomic, cultural and political life of our nations. To\r\ndo so, we need mentoring and support.\r\nI wish to conclude by stating that political will\r\nand commitment at the highest level nationally and\r\ninternationally are of primary importance in creating an\r\nenabling environment for youth empowerment. We\r\nurge our societies and Governments to consider us as\r\nassets, not as problems. Please give us space and\r\nopportunities.\r\nMr. Kitaoka (Japan): Ten years after the\r\nadoption of the World Programme of Action for Youth\r\nto the Year 2000 and Beyond, there have been\r\nsignificant developments in the priority areas of the\r\nProgramme. However, the current generation of young\r\npeople is facing even more complicated challenges\r\nthan those envisaged 10 years ago.\r\nJapanese society has been undergoing a rapid\r\ntransformation from its traditionally homogeneous\r\nnature to one that is more individualistic, due partly to\r\nthe globalization of the economy, as well as to the\r\nadvent of information technology, which has resulted\r\nin increased use of the Internet and of cellular phones.\r\nIn addition, a changing demographic structure has\r\ncreated more single-person households and one-child\r\nfamilies as a result of our lower birth rate and ageing\r\npopulation. In order to promote sound development for\r\nthe young people who will lead the nation and\r\n6\r\nA/60/PV.28\r\ncontribute to international society in the twenty-first\r\ncentury, it is important to appropriately take into\r\naccount todays social environment and take drastic\r\naction to that end as we formulate national youth\r\ndevelopment policy.\r\nWhile Japan has the good fortune of having a\r\nhigh educational level, a side effect of this has been\r\nthat we have fallen slightly behind in our commitment\r\nto a national youth development policy. In June 2003,\r\nhowever, a headquarters for youth development was set\r\nup within a cabinet office. In December 2003  six\r\nmonths later  a national youth development policy,\r\nwhich articulates both basic principles and long-term\r\nGovernment policies, was adopted.\r\nTaking the World Programme of Action fully into\r\nconsideration, Japan also has been adopting measures\r\nfor the development of youth in order to foster such\r\nhuman qualities as independence, responsibility,\r\nsolidarity and tolerance, and to promote awareness of\r\nhuman rights and the notion of living in a global\r\nsociety.\r\nWhile actively committing itself to the\r\nformulation and implementation of a national youth\r\npolicy, Japan is also firmly engaged in international\r\ncooperation and supports youth in developing countries\r\nby providing development assistance, as well as by\r\nengaging in international exchanges and volunteer\r\nactivities. For example, Japan has vigorously provided\r\nassistance in the field of education by building\r\neducational institutions, accepting teachers for training\r\nand dispatching experts, as well as by providing\r\neducational materials and classroom equipment.\r\nIn conclusion, the delegation of Japan strongly\r\nhopes that the review we are conducting at this meeting\r\nwill contribute further to addressing the challenges\r\nfacing youth and renewing the determination of every\r\nMember State to attain the goals of the World\r\nProgramme of Action for Youth. At this tenth\r\nanniversary of the World Programme of Action, I\r\nwould like to quote from the address of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to the World Conference of Ministers\r\nResponsible for Youth in 1998:\r\n... no one is born a good citizen; no nation is\r\nborn a democracy. Rather, both are processes that\r\ncontinue to evolve over a lifetime. Young people\r\nmust be included from birth. A society that cuts\r\nitself off from its youth severs its lifeline.\r\nMr. Ali (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): My delegation\r\nwishes to express its pleasure at participating in the\r\nwork of this special session of the General Assembly,\r\nconvened on the tenth anniversary of the adoption of\r\nthe World Programme of Action for Youth to the Year\r\n2000 and Beyond. The convening of this session to\r\nreview the efforts made and the progress achieved as\r\nregards the World Program of Action for Youth is clear\r\nevidence and a great affirmation of the growing\r\nconcern paid by the international Organization and its\r\nMembers to young people and of the space it sets aside\r\nin its programmes and plans for their concerns and\r\nvarious issues. Such importance was made necessary\r\nby the focus of attention being attracted by this\r\nsegment of society, the young people who are pioneers\r\nin building nations and achieving renaissance,\r\ndevelopment and prosperity. This special session is to\r\nconsider a renewal of the pledge to the youth that their\r\nagenda, their aspirations and the challenges they face\r\nwill remain at the forefront of the priorities,\r\nprogrammes and concerns of the United Nations.\r\nAllow me here to pay tribute to the contents of\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General, which adopted an\r\nintegrated, comprehensive approach to the concerns of\r\nyouth and the challenges facing them. The report also\r\nmonitored the efforts made nationally and\r\ninternationally with a view to achieving such\r\nobjectives. The five new concerns indicated\r\nsupplement the priorities of the World Programme of\r\nAction so as to keep up with new developments and\r\nchanges in the world arena. We welcome these five\r\nconcerns; they are of great interest to us.\r\nIn this context, we also welcome the resolution\r\nsubmitted this morning, and we affirm our full\r\nreadiness to tackle such concerns through youth\r\nprogrammes, plans and policies, with resolve, will and\r\nsheer determination.\r\nOur appreciation also goes to the Secretariat units\r\nworking in this field for their efforts and solid\r\npreparation that culminated in holding this important\r\nmeeting and the activities leading up to it.\r\nThe concerns, issues and aspirations of Sudanese\r\nyouth occupy a high priority in our Governments plans\r\nand programmes as an expression of our firm belief in\r\nthe vital role of youth in progress and construction.\r\nHere, we would like to refer briefly to increasing\r\nefforts to adopt the concerns and issues of youth,\r\nforemost of which are the major achievements\r\n7\r\nA/60/PV.28\r\nresulting from the higher education revolution. That\r\nrevolution increased the annual enrolment in\r\nuniversities from 12,000 in 1995 to 25,000 in the year\r\n2000. This year, the number of male and female\r\nstudents who were accepted in the various higher\r\neducation institutions has exceeded 40,000. Various\r\nuniversities and institutions of higher learning have\r\nexperienced a major breakthrough with the number of\r\nuniversities increasing from only five in 1995 to more\r\nthan 40 in 2005.\r\nIn the context of combating unemployment,\r\ntraining youth in various crafts and professions and\r\nproviding opportunities and means of production, the\r\nState has adopted a major project upon the initiative of\r\nand in coordination with the Union for National Youth,\r\none of the largest youth organizations in the Sudan.\r\nThis project, entitled Choosing the means of\r\nlivelihood, is being undertaken under the generous\r\nauspices of His Excellency the President; and its\r\nimplementation has reached an advance stage.\r\nThere are efforts to eradicate technological\r\nilliteracy by creating information centres and providing\r\ncomputers and creating youth and sports clubs. Youth\r\nhave undertaken pioneer projects to defeat malaria and\r\nto create awareness of the adverse effects of drugs.\r\nThey have also set up environmental and conservation\r\nprogrammes.\r\nThe signing of the Sudan Comprehensive Peace\r\nAgreement put an end to the war in the South and\r\nthrew the doors wide open to a promising future of\r\ngood tidings and hope for all Sudanese people. This\r\nbrings hope for development, stability and prosperity.\r\nAs is their wont, youth have been at the forefront in\r\nimplementing programmes for the culture of peace and\r\nconfidence-building and strengthening and in leading\r\nreconstruction and restoring normalcy.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to take this\r\nopportunity to convey to this World Youth Meeting the\r\ngreetings and appreciation of Sudanese youth and their\r\naspirations for a productive partnership with all youth\r\naround the world in order to promote the peace efforts\r\nin the Sudan through reconstruction, the promise of\r\npeace, development, prosperity and well-being.\r\nMr. Gill (India): At the outset, please allow me to\r\nexpress our deep appreciation to the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly for his introductory remarks. I\r\nwould also like to thank him for providing us this\r\nopportunity to review the progress made at the plenary\r\nlevel in implementation of the World Programme of\r\nAction for Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond.\r\nMy delegation wishes to take this opportunity to\r\nreaffirm its support for the initiatives taken by the\r\nUnited Nations for all-round development of youth so\r\nthat they become key agents for social change,\r\neconomic development and technological innovation.\r\nIndia is an ancient civilization but a young\r\nsociety. Nearly 56 per cent of the population is below\r\nthe age of 24. India has been cognizant of the\r\nsignificant role of youth in national reconstruction and\r\nsocial change. Accordingly, national youth policies\r\nhave been developed for composite and all-round\r\ndevelopment to enable them to develop a wider\r\nnational perspective and to keep them strong in heart,\r\nbody and mind. The thrust of our national youth policy\r\ncentres on youth empowerment in different spheres of\r\nnational life. The youth development programmes\r\ndevised in India over the years have focussed on\r\npersonality development, qualities of citizenship,\r\nenhanced commitment to community service, social\r\njustice, self-reliance, national integration and\r\nhumanism.\r\nThe Prime Minister of India, Mr. Manmohan\r\nSingh, has referred to youth as the building blocks of\r\nour nation. He has drawn attention to the fact that the\r\nattitudes and outlook of youth on life and society play\r\na determining role in shaping our destiny and our\r\nfuture.\r\nRecognizing the importance of providing\r\nopportunities to the youth in particular, the\r\nGovernment of India has oriented its employment\r\nguarantee programmes to accommodate and provide\r\nfor the aspirations of the growing numbers of young\r\npeople that access the job market every year. There is a\r\nspecial emphasis on those who are disadvantaged, such\r\nas poor and rural youth. The National Rural\r\nEmployment Act, passed by the Indian Parliament in\r\nAugust this year, for the first time makes the right to\r\nwork a fundamental right. The Rural Employment\r\nGuarantee scheme, thus created, provides 100 days of\r\nassured employment every year to every rural\r\nhousehold. The training of rural youth for self-\r\nemployment scheme is designed to specifically train\r\nrural youth in skills to enable them to take up self-\r\nemployment. The scheme stipulates that at least 40 per\r\ncent of the beneficiaries should be women and 50 per\r\ncent from socially backward groups.\r\n8\r\nA/60/PV.28\r\nElementary education is now a fundamental right\r\nin India. The Government has resolved to increase\r\npublic spending in education to at least six per cent of\r\nthe gross domestic product (GDP). At least half of this\r\namount would be spent in the development of primary\r\nand secondary education. To pursue universal\r\nelementary education on a priority basis, Sarva Shiksha\r\nAbhiya, Indias universal elementary education\r\nscheme, was launched in 1998, covering the entire\r\ncountry. Education above the secondary level has a\r\nsignificant vocational training component so as to\r\nenable youth to acquire skills that would augment\r\navenues for employment. Nehru Yuva Kendras,\r\nnational youth clubs, have spearheaded the youth\r\nmovement in the country.\r\nThe health needs of the youth are at the core of\r\ndevelopment of the health infrastructure in India. A\r\nholistic approach has been adopted, encompassing\r\ngeneral, mental, physical and spiritual health of the\r\nyoung. Among the priority areas, HIV/AIDS is no\r\nlonger treated as just a health issue, but as a most\r\nserious socio-economic development issue.\r\nGovernment spending on health has been increased,\r\nand it will be raised to two to three per cent of GDP\r\nover the next year.\r\nMy delegation would like to propose a special\r\nfocus on youth employment in the work of the United\r\nNations. In that regard, we welcome the efforts of the\r\nSecretary-General to promote the Youth Employment\r\nNetwork and look forward to working with other\r\ndelegations to ensure that the Network can be\r\ndeveloped in the coming months.\r\nThe challenges ahead of us for the all-round\r\ndevelopment of youth are daunting. But to be sure,\r\nwith effective national and international efforts, they\r\ncan be overcome. Issues related to youth should be\r\nseen in the context of social and economic\r\ndevelopment in the age of the information revolution\r\nand globalization.\r\nThe Secretary-Generals report provides an\r\nincisive analysis on five new concerns related to youth:\r\nglobalization, information and communication\r\ntechnology, HIV/AIDS and young people, youth and\r\narmed conflict and intergenerational problems. My\r\ndelegation will work with other delegations for the\r\ninclusion of those concerns in the World Programme of\r\nAction for Youth.\r\nMr. Puja (Indonesia): My delegation is grateful\r\nfor the comprehensive reports of the Secretary-General\r\npertaining to progress in implementing the World\r\nProgramme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and\r\nBeyond (A/60/61, A/60/133, A/60/156). Our meeting is\r\nan opportune moment to review what has been\r\naccomplished and the obstacles encountered in\r\nimplementing the World Programme since it was\r\nadopted 10 years ago.\r\nMy delegation notes significant progress made in\r\na number of priority areas of the Programme of Action.\r\nHowever, progress has been uneven in those areas,\r\nincluding at the country level, which should be cause\r\nfor concern. Further, Indonesia has noted that a number\r\nof complex challenges affecting youth have emerged\r\nsince the inception of the Programme of Action in\r\n1995.\r\nIn line with the priority areas of the Programme\r\nof Action, the Indonesian Government, under the\r\nleadership of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, is\r\nusing a triple-track strategy of pro-growth, pro-\r\nemployment and pro-poor measures that strongly\r\nreflect a people-centred development approach. That\r\nstrategy includes measures to achieve greater\r\nsustainable economic growth through a combination of\r\nstrong exports and increased domestic and foreign\r\ninvestment; stimulate the performance of employment-\r\ngenerating sectors; and promote the development of the\r\nrural economy and agriculture to alleviate poverty.\r\nWith that strategy, we aim, by 2009, to reduce the\r\nunemployment rate from 9.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent\r\nand to cut the poverty rate by half, to 8.1 percent. We\r\nalso seek to attain a 6.6 per cent annual growth rate for\r\nthe next five years, to be achieved through\r\nmacroeconomic stability, fiscal sustainability and\r\nfinancial sector reforms. Additional resources will be\r\nallocated for social sector programmes and\r\ninfrastructure development.\r\nAn integral part of the triple-track strategy is our\r\npro-employment policy, which plays a significant role\r\nin the well-being of youth in Indonesia. As a lead\r\ncountry in the Secretary-Generals initiative of the\r\nYouth Employment Network, Indonesia, in cooperation\r\nwith the United Nations Department of Economic and\r\nSocial Affairs, convened a regional workshop on youth\r\nin poverty in South-East Asia from 2 to 4 August 2004\r\nin Yogyakarta, involving participants at the\r\nGovernment and expert levels from Cambodia,\r\n9\r\nA/60/PV.28\r\nIndonesia, Laos, Myanmar, the Philippines and Viet\r\nNam. The workshop resulted in a number of significant\r\ninputs for the preparation of a review and action plans\r\non youth employment, which is under our\r\nconsideration at the present session.\r\nWith the support of the International Labour\r\nOrganization, Indonesia has adopted its youth\r\nemployment action plan for 2004-2007, which rests on\r\nfour pillars: providing quality basic education to\r\nprepare youth for work, creating quality jobs for young\r\nmen and women through formal sector job creation,\r\nfostering entrepreneurship and ensuring equal\r\nopportunities for young men and women.\r\nIn implementing that action plan, the Government\r\nof Indonesia has been working closely with local\r\ngovernment to build a solid foundation to speed efforts\r\nto address youth employment. The Government of\r\nIndonesia started the programme by conducting various\r\nawareness-raising campaigns.\r\nSince its launch last year, progress on the\r\nimplementation of the action plan has not slackened.\r\nFor example, Indonesias awareness-raising campaigns\r\nhave focused on changing traditional perceptions of\r\ngender roles and the division of responsibilities\r\nbetween women and men. That is being addressed\r\nthrough the revision of national curricula and national\r\neducation in general.\r\nOther initiatives exploring opportunities in\r\nemerging sectors such as tourism, mass media, health\r\nand education, environmental conservation, the service\r\nsector and information and communication technology\r\nare also being implemented. Indonesia fully recognizes\r\nthat information and communication technology\r\nrepresents a key driving force for growth and job\r\ncreation in other sectors. Meanwhile, the agro-industry\r\nsector is being improved in order to strengthen urban-\r\nrural linkages, which are critical for job creation,\r\npoverty reduction and combating hunger.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reaffirm\r\nIndonesias commitment to the World Programme of\r\nAction for Youth. While Indonesia appreciates the\r\nongoing support and cooperation provided by the\r\nrelevant United Nations agencies, it looks forward to\r\ntheir further support for the five new areas of concern\r\npertaining to youth.\r\nMs. Garant (Canada) (spoke in French): Thank\r\nyou for this opportunity to speak on behalf of the youth\r\nof Canada. It is a great honour for me and my\r\ndelegation to be here today to celebrate the tenth\r\nanniversary of the World Programme of Action for\r\nYouth to the Year 2000 and Beyond. But it is much\r\nmore than a celebration. It is also a time to reflect on\r\nwhat has been done, what is being done and what\r\nshould be done for young people around the world.\r\nHow the global community responds to those\r\nchallenges will determine how well its young citizens\r\nwill be able to fulfil their potential.\r\nCanada recognizes the need to invest in its youth.\r\nSuch investments have contributed to Canadas\r\ndiversity, as well as to one of the highest standards of\r\nliving in the world.\r\nAs my youth colleague Mathew Whynott likes to\r\nsay, the young people of this world are the future, but\r\nwe also have to remember that they are the present.\r\nCanada therefore views the policies and programmes\r\nwe initiate for youth today as a means to help us with\r\nthe demographic challenges of tomorrow. With an\r\nageing workforce, we must maximize the participation\r\nand well-being of all Canadians.\r\nIn 2003, there were more than 4 million\r\nCanadians between the ages of 15 and 24, representing\r\n14 per cent of our total population. Approximately\r\n4 per cent of those youth are aboriginal or indigenous,\r\nand they often live in rural and isolated areas and face\r\nserious socio-economic challenges, especially related\r\nto the lack of education and skills. Immigrants and\r\nmembers of visible minority communities, who make\r\nup 28 per cent of Canadian youth, tend to live in major\r\nurban centres and face linguistic and cultural\r\nchallenges. While half of our youth are in post-\r\nsecondary education, many without advanced\r\neducation will face problems when entering a\r\nworkforce where almost all jobs are now highly\r\nskilled. Those issues are of major concern for Canada\r\nas it faces the impending retirement of its baby\r\nboomers and feels the increasing impacts of\r\nglobalization.\r\nLiteracy is a crucial concern. Consider only one\r\nstatistic: those with the lowest literacy have an\r\nunemployment rate of 26 per cent as compared with\r\n4 per cent for those with the highest. Recent\r\nimmigrants now take seven or eight years to catch up\r\nto the literacy levels of Canadians in their same age\r\ngroup. As a result, they may face long-term incomes up\r\nto 20 per cent less than those born in Canada. A recent\r\n10\r\nA/60/PV.28\r\nreport by Statistics Canada has revealed that a mere\r\n1 per cent increase in the average literacy rate in\r\nCanada will lead to an increase of $18.4 billion in the\r\ngross domestic product. It will drive prosperity,\r\ncultural inclusion, and social advancement.\r\nEconomic growth is another outcome of\r\nprioritizing education. With literacy and proper skills\r\ntraining, a young person can go on to obtain a secure\r\njob that will contribute to the economic advancement\r\nof his or her community.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nThe Youth Employment Strategy is the\r\nGovernment of Canadas commitment to helping young\r\npeople, particularly those facing barriers to\r\nemployment. That strategy was initially introduced in\r\n1997 to address some of the challenges faced by youth\r\nin making a successful transition from school to work.\r\nIn 2003 it was realigned to focus on the value and need\r\nfor skills, work experience and information to make\r\nsure that youth were ready to compete in the labour\r\nmarket of the twenty-first century, including through\r\nthe acquisition of further education and skills\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe Government of Canada is actively involved\r\nin engaging youth through consultations. For example,\r\nyouth were consulted on a Government online\r\ninitiative that resulted in the youth.gc.ca website,\r\ndesigned specifically for young Canadians. I happen to\r\nbe living proof of how the Government of Canada\r\npartners with its youth: I was chosen as a United\r\nNations delegate for this weeks meetings through an\r\nonline essay writing competition. There is a strong\r\nsupport for young Canadians to take an active role in\r\npolicymaking through online and in-person\r\nconsultations and that support continues to grow.\r\nAs we move into the future and as globalization\r\nprogresses, Canada recognizes the international\r\nchallenge of addressing the welfare of youth. And\r\nwhile we address youth issues nationally, international\r\nlinks must not be ignored. The Canadian International\r\nDevelopment Agency supports an array of initiatives to\r\nensure equitable, inclusive and sustainable\r\ndevelopment, as well as pragmatic improvements in the\r\nlives of people around the world, including youth. The\r\nAgency engages Canadians abroad in missions that\r\nwork to meet the goals of the World Programme of\r\nAction for Youth in the area of education. Canadian\r\ninternational efforts focus on four main areas. The first\r\nis improving the quality, safety and relevance of basic\r\neducation, so that student enrolment and motivation\r\nremain high. The second area of focus is removing\r\nbarriers to resolve gender inequality in education and\r\nstrengthening the programming in girls education.\r\nAnother focus is providing education on HIV/AIDS\r\nprevention and supporting the better integration of such\r\nprogrammes in the curricula. The fourth element\r\nprovides education for girls and boys in conflict, post-\r\nconflict or emergency situations to introduce stability\r\nand protection in emergency settings. That work allows\r\nCanada to contribute to the efforts of countries around\r\nthe world.\r\nClearly, much needs to be done to ensure the\r\nwell-being of the worlds youth. We will continue to\r\nwork towards improving the outcomes for youth in\r\nCanada and around the world. We ask for the\r\nrecognition and involvement of youth; we ask for\r\ntolerance and understanding; and we ask for\r\nimplementation. It is time for action. We all know what\r\nto do. Now, please let us do it.\r\nMr. Lim (Singapore): It gives me great pleasure\r\nto participate in this meeting of the General Assembly\r\ndevoted to a discussion of youth issues, and\r\nparticularly to an evaluation of progress made in\r\nimplementing the World Programme of Action for\r\nYouth to the Year 2000 and Beyond.\r\nIn the concluding recommendations of his World\r\nYouth Report 2005, the Secretary-General stated that\r\nyoung people should be seen as essential partners for\r\nbuilding a society of the future. He affirmed that\r\nGovernments should continuously evaluate their youth\r\npolicies and involve young people in that evaluation,\r\nand that including youth in policymaking would\r\nincrease the commitment of young people to the\r\npolicies that affect them and create greater\r\nopportunities for cooperation and true youth\r\nparticipation.\r\nThose statements are consonant with Singapores\r\nown recent policies to better engage our youth in\r\nshaping our countrys future. Indeed, at his swearing-in\r\naddress on 12 August 2004, our Prime Minister made a\r\nsimilar call to young Singaporeans to step forward to\r\nmake a difference to themselves, to their fellow\r\ncitizens and to Singapore.\r\nYouth forms the basis of a countrys future; their\r\naspirations and endeavours will provide the momentum\r\nto propel countries forward.\r\n11\r\nA/60/PV.28\r\nTo better engage our youth, our Ministry of\r\nCommunity Development and Sports underwent a\r\nstructural and name change in 2004 to become the\r\nMinistry of Community Development, Youth and\r\nSports. Singapore also adopted a youth strategy based\r\non the three elements. First, we must assist youth to\r\ndevelop a stake in society by creating opportunities for\r\nthem to positively influence their environment.\r\nSecondly, we should ensure that youth have a say in\r\nnational affairs by involving them in the process of\r\nconsultation. Thirdly, we need to provide youth with\r\nthe support they need to develop and participate\r\nmeaningfully in society, through facilitation,\r\nmentorship and other assistance mechanisms.\r\nThe Singapore Government initiated an intensive\r\nsix-week youth consultation exercise from August to\r\nSeptember 2004. More than 2,000 young Singaporeans\r\nfrom both Singapore and overseas were invited to share\r\ntheir aspirations for themselves and for Singapore, and\r\nto help shape the Governments new agenda for youth.\r\nThey spoke passionately about their beliefs and shared\r\ntheir ideas readily. More than 100 young participants\r\nlater volunteered to follow up on the suggestions raised\r\nduring the consultation exercise. They formed working\r\ngroups, proposed a further 91 recommendations and\r\nchampioned issues that had emerged as key concerns\r\nduring the consultations.\r\nThe working group process enabled the\r\nSingapore Government to take one step further, moving\r\nbeyond public consultation to collaborative action. Our\r\nyoung people assumed leadership over the process and\r\nover some of the ideas that are now being\r\nimplemented. Those include a festival, Shine,\r\norganized by young people for young people, that\r\ncelebrates the talents of our youth; an Internet portal,\r\nyouth.sg, as a first-stop virtual meeting place and\r\nresource centre for youth to start their own community\r\nprojects; a 1.2 hectare youth community hub designed,\r\ndeveloped and operated by youth in the heart of the\r\ncity for youth cultural and community activities; and a\r\nyoung changemakers programme for young\r\nSingaporeans to assess and award seed grants to\r\ncommunity projects proposed by their peers.\r\nIt is also important for our youth to understand\r\nand appreciate the realities of the world beyond their\r\nimmediate communities. In that regard, the Singapore\r\nGovernment has also undertaken efforts to initiate\r\nregional and international youth exchanges to connect\r\nSingapores youth to the world and to prepare them to\r\nbe world-ready. Through such strategic linkups, youth\r\nleaders of participating youth organizations have the\r\nopportunity to share best practices in areas of youth\r\nsector development with their peers overseas. It is that\r\ntype of informal and intuitive mutual understanding\r\nthat will pave the way for closer ties between young\r\npeople across countries.\r\nYouth is a key resource for society. If we build on\r\nthe potential of our youth, communities will develop\r\nand grow stronger. The future awaits us, and it lies in\r\nthe hands of our young people.\r\nMr. Abel (Brazil) (spoke in Spanish): I should\r\nlike at the outset to acknowledge the young people of\r\nBrazil and my colleagues from the National Youth\r\nSecretariat, who are joining in our work via the\r\nInternet.\r\nTen years have passed since the adoption of the\r\nWorld Programme of Action for Youth to the Year\r\n2000 and Beyond. We all have a great deal to celebrate,\r\nbut there is still a long way to go before we can\r\nguarantee future generations the right to enjoy a better\r\nworld  a world of real opportunity, justice and\r\nsolidarity.\r\nBrazil has 34 million young people, making up\r\n20 per cent of the population. It is the young people\r\nwho suffer most from the harsh reality of social\r\ninequality in our country and throughout the world.\r\nEfforts in the context of the World Programme of\r\nAction for Youth have come together with actions\r\ntaken by the Government and the people of Brazil to\r\nset out integrated policies to improve the living\r\nconditions of our young people.\r\nBrazil declared 2005 to be the National Year for\r\nYouth, and I would like to outline some of the actions\r\nthat have been taken for the benefit of young people. In\r\nFebruary, the Government of Brazil established the\r\nNational Youth Secretariat, under the auspices of the\r\ngeneral secretariat of the presidency of the Republic.\r\nWe also established a general counsel for youth  a\r\nspecial forum for intergenerational dialogue and the\r\nelaboration of policies aimed at young people.\r\nFurthermore, a national programme for young people,\r\nentitled Projovem, has been launched, with a budget\r\nof more than $100 million. The goal of that programme\r\nis to make up the significant educational deficit in our\r\ncountry, as well as to prepare young people for the\r\nlabour market. By the end of 2005, more than 200,000\r\nyoung people will have benefited from that\r\n12\r\nA/60/PV.28\r\nprogramme. We are convinced that that initiative, as\r\nwell as our First Job Programme, will soon bear fruit.\r\nBrazil had the privilege of hosting the Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean Youth Leadership Summit,\r\norganized by the United Nations Development Fund,\r\nwhich brought together young leaders from the region\r\nto discuss the Millennium Development Goals from a\r\nyouth perspective.\r\nThanks to our national HIV/AIDS policy, which\r\naddresses prevention, assistance and treatment and\r\nguarantees universal access to antiretroviral\r\nmedication, without discrimination and with respect for\r\nhuman rights, the rate of infection in the general\r\npopulation is very low. Furthermore, our schools health\r\nand prevention programme provides information on\r\nHIV to all students and distributes condoms free of\r\ncharge.\r\nWith regard to girls and young women, policy\r\npriorities focus on gender-related violence and the\r\npromotion of sexual and reproductive health. To that\r\nend, action is being coordinated among various\r\nGovernment agencies and civil society.\r\nThe Brazilian Government is firmly committed to\r\ncombating hunger and poverty. In that context, Brazil\r\nreaffirms the commitment that it made in 2004 as one\r\nof the leading countries of the Youth Employment\r\nNetwork. We commend the Secretary-General for his\r\ninitiative aimed at enabling young people to get a\r\nfoothold in the labour market, thereby contributing to\r\nthe reduction of social inequalities.\r\nBrazil is carrying out activities in all areas of the\r\nWorld Programme of Action for Youth. The dialogue\r\nbetween the Government and civil society is extremely\r\nimportant in that process. We are convinced that public\r\npolicies for youth are among the most important means\r\nof achieving comprehensive development, not only in\r\nour country, but also throughout the world.\r\nMr. Bhattarai (Nepal): We are meeting here\r\ntoday to evaluate the progress made in the\r\nimplementation of the 15 priority areas in the World\r\nProgramme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and\r\nBeyond.\r\nFive years ago, our leaders promised the people\r\nof the United Nations that they would improve their\r\nquality of life through the implementation of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). The\r\nestablishment of the United Nations Youth Fund and\r\nthe launching of the Youth Employment Network\r\nencouraged the promotion of national action plans for\r\nyouth employment.\r\nThe outcome document contains commitments to\r\nthe goals of full and productive employment and\r\ndecent work for all, including for women and young\r\npeople. Those documents provide a road map for social\r\nand economic development  an explicit commitment\r\nto tackle inequalities in income, opportunity and\r\npower, to promote social integration and to address the\r\nissue of the social protection and welfare of children,\r\nyouth, the elderly and disabled persons.\r\nYoung people represent the future. Youth is a\r\ntime both of opportunity and of challenge. Thanks to\r\nseveral development forums, the case for investing in\r\nyoung people has been made clearer, and today youth\r\nhas come to occupy the centre stage of international\r\ndevelopment. An investment in youth is an investment\r\nin the future. In order to harness the potential of youth,\r\nand thereby enrich society, we must give young\r\npeople  particularly those from marginalized and\r\ndisadvantaged communities  a say and a share at the\r\ngrass-roots level in the development process, ensuring\r\nthat they play a full role in shaping a bright and secure\r\nfuture for all of us. A committed and aware young\r\nperson is an asset to the community and the country.\r\nThe fact that some countries are poor while\r\nothers are prosperous poses a great threat to\r\ninternational peace and security. Poverty is a curse and\r\na scar for any society. People living in poverty are\r\nvulnerable and voiceless. Traffickers and terrorists\r\nrecruit them by offering tempting rewards. People\r\nwithout income or security fall prey to crime and\r\nviolence, and often get trapped in protracted conflict.\r\nThe economic and social costs become pervasive.\r\nWe must address the severe inequalities and\r\ninequities, and put in place programmes to provide\r\nemployment opportunities and ensure institutional and\r\npolicy development, as well as civil society initiatives\r\nfor the education and health of children. Youth\r\nempowerment is necessary in order to combat the\r\nvulnerability of young people to the influence of\r\nfundamentalism, radicalism, insurgency and terrorism.\r\nNepal has been the victim of senseless violence\r\nperpetrated by terrorists, which has taken a great toll in\r\nterms of lives, and has had an adverse impact on young\r\npeople and prevented them from engaging in\r\nconstructive processes. Nepals current development\r\n13\r\nA/60/PV.28\r\nplan includes a policy reform package, which\r\naddresses, among other issues, social inclusion,\r\nempowerment, gender mainstreaming, education and\r\nhealth for all, income-generating activities, the\r\nprohibition of socio-cultural discriminatory practices,\r\ntargeted and time-bound development programmes and\r\nparticipatory governance. Our utmost priority at the\r\nmoment is to restore peace and order, put development\r\nefforts back on track and provide opportunities for all\r\nto realize their potential. Nepal looks forward to\r\nworking with the international community to engage\r\nyoung people, develop their capacity, tap their\r\nknowledge and skills and promote and support their\r\nparticipation in economic and social life through an\r\nintegrated package of measures.\r\nIn this increasingly interconnected and\r\ninterdependent world, creating a sustained global\r\npartnership with young people is a must for any\r\nprogramme to succeed. Development policies should\r\ntherefore be supportive of growth, poverty reduction\r\nand the creation of decent work for all.\r\nFor this to happen, there must be urgent action on\r\nvarious international commitments and sustained\r\nglobal partnership for providing resources, trade\r\nopportunities and debt relief measures to least\r\ndeveloped countries, taking into account their special\r\nneeds and vulnerability. It is equally important to have\r\nthe multidimensional strategy to fight the closely\r\nlinked problems of poverty and terrorism at the\r\nnational, regional and global levels without any\r\nselective standards.\r\nLet us join hands to channel the power of youth\r\ninto a precious resource for development.\r\nMr. Le Luong Minh (Viet Nam): My delegation\r\nwelcomes the convening of this plenary meeting of the\r\nGeneral Assembly devoted to the evaluation of the\r\nprogress made in the implementation of the World\r\nProgramme for Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond.\r\nThe round table held yesterday as a forum for the\r\nexpression and exchange of youth perspectives was a\r\nmeaningful and useful event. We were pleased to see a\r\nyoung delegate from Viet Nam participating in\r\nyesterdays round table as a presenter for the Asia-\r\nPacific region.\r\nOf the 80 million people of Viet Nam, 16 million\r\nare young people between the ages of 15 and 24; that is\r\nnearly 20 per cent of the countrys population. Viewing\r\nyoung people as the countrys future, the Government\r\nof Viet Nam attaches great importance to addressing\r\nyouth issues, including the 10 priority areas of the\r\nWorld Programme of Action, which are interdependent\r\nand interlinked. In this statement I will touch upon\r\nthree of them.\r\nFirst, as regards youth and employment, in our\r\nNational Youth Development Strategy to the Year\r\n2010, which was approved by the Government in 2003,\r\nunemployment was identified as the biggest difficulty\r\ncurrently facing our young people. Many efforts,\r\nincluding policies, programmes and concrete measures,\r\nhave been undertaken to address this problem.\r\nVulnerable groups among young people, such as first-\r\ntime job seekers, unskilled workers and young women,\r\nreceive special attention in various job orientation and\r\ntraining activities. The Governments pro-poor policies\r\nand programmes provide for easier access to\r\nmicrocredits by young people, especially those living\r\nin poorer areas, so that they can start their own\r\nbusinesses. The Viet Nam Association of Young\r\nEntrepreneurs provides assistance to young people in\r\nstarting up and running their businesses. As nearly\r\n1.4 million young job seekers enter the labour market\r\nannually, our Government has set a target of creating\r\n1.5 million new jobs each year.\r\nThe second area is youth and education. In order\r\nto secure a better chance at finding full and productive\r\nemployment, it is imperative that young people receive\r\nadequate education and training. To this end, achieving\r\nMillennium Development Goal (MDG) 2, universal\r\nprimary education, is a must. During the 2003-2004\r\nschool year, the net primary enrolment rate was\r\n94.4 per cent, while the completion rate rose to\r\n99.82 per cent. If the current annual growth rate of\r\n0.5 per cent is maintained, we will achieve universal\r\nprimary education by 2015.\r\nWe have set a range of targets as contained in the\r\nDevelopment Strategy for Training and Education for\r\n2001-2010, the National Action Plan of Education for\r\nAll for 2003-2015, the National Targeted Programme\r\non Education and Training for 2001-2010 and the five-\r\nyear and annual socio-economic development plans.\r\nPublic resources allocated to education and training\r\nhave constantly increased.\r\nThe third area is youth and poverty. The focus on\r\nemployment and education, among other areas of\r\npriority, is a central part of our poverty reduction\r\n14\r\nA/60/PV.28\r\nstrategy. Although the proportion of young people in\r\npoverty is lower than the national average in Viet\r\nNam  18 per cent compared to 24 per cent  we\r\nattach great importance to poverty reduction for young\r\npeople. Our national targets include a 50 per cent\r\nreduction in the number of people living below the\r\npoverty line during the period 2001-2010. To achieve\r\nthis, special attention is given to rural and remote areas\r\nand to minority groups.\r\nThe first survey assessment of Vietnamese youth\r\nwas launched in August of this year. The survey noted\r\nin its chapter 1 that The majority of Vietnamese\r\nyoung people are hardworking, strongly connected to\r\ntheir families, optimistic about the future and generally\r\nsatisfied with their employment situation. It has also\r\nbeen observed that Viet Nam, with its high rates of\r\nliteracy and numeracy, long experience with mass\r\norganizations and ability to mobilize people down to\r\nthe village level, has sufficient absorptive capacity to\r\ncontinue moving forward in developing programmes\r\nand strategies for reducing poverty.\r\nAt this plenary meeting we are evaluating our\r\nindividual national implementation of the World\r\nProgramme of Action. There is an important aspect of\r\nthis process of implementing the Programme that also\r\nneeds to be emphasized: cooperation and assistance\r\namong countries and among young people from\r\ndifferent countries in terms of experience-sharing,\r\ntechnical and financial assistance, training, et cetera.\r\nSuch cooperation and assistance should and can be\r\ncarried out at both regional and international levels.\r\nIn conclusion, young people are not only the\r\nbeneficiaries of the aforementioned policies,\r\nprogrammes and targets. They are also the driving\r\nforce in implementing those policies, programmes and\r\ntargets. Investing in our youth means, as always,\r\ninvesting in our future.\r\nMs. Damsgaard-Larsen (Denmark): As a youth\r\ndelegate in the Danish delegation to the sixtieth session\r\nof the General Assembly, and as a representative of the\r\nDanish Youth Council, it is a great honour and a\r\nprivilege for me to address the Assembly. It is a great\r\nprivilege because, in general, young people  and in\r\nparticular young women  have a hard time getting\r\ntheir voices heard. Too often, decision-makers base\r\ntheir decisions on experiences that are not shared by all\r\nyoung people, and therefore the decisions do not\r\nalways take into consideration our increasingly\r\nglobalized world.\r\nToo often, young people are not included in\r\ndecisions that impact on their lives at both the national\r\nand the international levels. Those decisions could be\r\nimproved or made more sustainable by including the\r\nperspectives of young people. Too often, young people\r\nare perceived to be associated with problems instead of\r\nsolutions. In order to be solved, those problems need\r\nthe involvement of young people.\r\nPlease, have confidence in young people. It is\r\ntrue that young people are indeed overrepresented in\r\nstatistics related to negative issues. I would like to\r\ncomment on two of those issues, HIV and terrorism.\r\nHalf the worlds HIV victims are infected before they\r\nturn 25, and disgruntled young men and women are in\r\nthe frontline of terrorism and armed conflict. If we\r\nwant to meet those and other major challenges, we\r\nmust involve young people. Nothing will be achieved\r\nfor young people without the participation of young\r\npeople.\r\nWhen it comes to the battle against AIDS, it is\r\nabsolutely pivotal to encourage young people to follow\r\nthe ABC strategy: abstain, be faithful or use condoms.\r\nAs noted with respect to the Millennium Development\r\nGoals, only by sharply reducing the rate of HIV-\r\nprevalence among young people will we be able to stop\r\nthe pandemic.\r\nWith respect to counter-terrorism measures, they\r\nshould not be just about weapons. Equally important is\r\nshielding young people from totalitarian ideas by\r\nproviding them with positive experiences of democracy\r\nand cultural tolerance.\r\nWe will not be able to achieve the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals or our shared vision of a more\r\npeaceful planet unless young people are genuinely\r\nrecognized and utilized as a resource in society. We can\r\ndo much more nationally, as well as internationally, to\r\ninvolve young people in solving major problems in our\r\nglobal community.\r\nFirst, it is important to compile detailed statistics\r\nand data on problems concerning young people. In that\r\nrespect, the World Bank deserves credit for making\r\nyoung people the theme of its World Development\r\nReport 2007 and for consulting young people about\r\nwhich problems to include in the Report. The Bank has\r\nset an example.\r\n15\r\nA/60/PV.28\r\nSecondly, obligations already agreed should be\r\nmet. The ideas set out in the World Programme of\r\nAction for Youth have yet to be fulfilled. Ten years\r\nafter the Programmes adoption, a lot still needs to be\r\ndone, and too many Member States have not given the\r\nProgramme the attention it deserves.\r\nThirdly, we lack a comprehensive strategy for\r\ninvolving young people in the struggle to achieve the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. Investing in young\r\npeople is a prudent choice. There is a strong link\r\nbetween investing in young people and fulfilment of\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals.\r\nAnd finally, there needs to be a stronger focus on\r\nyoung peoples global awareness and their\r\nunderstanding of global issues. More education on\r\nglobal issues is needed to combat intolerance and\r\npromote international solidarity.\r\nWe ask for the recognition and the involvement\r\nof youth. We ask for tolerance and understanding, and\r\nwe ask for implementation.\r\nNumerous agreements have been signed to make\r\npoverty past history, provide education for all, promote\r\nthe rights of the child and so on  agreements with\r\ngreat visions and ideas for a better world, agreements\r\nthat call for action.\r\nWe need to make an extraordinary effort, if the\r\nvisions expressed in agreements already signed are to\r\nbecome a reality. Increasing the involvement of young\r\npeople will fuel much-needed implementation. It is\r\nquite interesting to note that the abbreviation of the\r\nWorld Programme of Action for Youth is WPAY,\r\nwhich in English is pronounced we pay, because I\r\nam certain that young people are willing to contribute.\r\nBut if young people are to be encouraged to do so, they\r\nneed to be involved in the decisions that define the\r\nsolutions they will have to pay for. It is time for action.\r\nWe all know what to do. Now, please let us do it.\r\nMr. Kariyawasam (Sri Lanka): The World\r\nProgramme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and\r\nBeyond, adopted by the General Assembly in 1995 in\r\nresolution 50/81, gives us guidance for the formulation\r\nof our vision and policies for youth. It contains\r\nsignificant benchmarks and targets to be realized to\r\nmake youth a central focus of national and\r\ninternational development agendas.\r\nThe vision for youth beyond 2000 that the World\r\nProgramme of Action has fostered is designed to\r\nfacilitate coherent and coordinated actions at multiple\r\nlevels of Government and the international community.\r\nIts emphasis on the adoption of a multi-stakeholder\r\napproach, making youth key players, seeks to give\r\nyouth a significant, participatory role and voice in\r\nnational and local-level decision-making processes.\r\nToday, 10 years after the Programmes adoption,\r\nwe are meeting to review the situation of youth and the\r\nachievements made in implementing the World\r\nProgramme of Action. In doing so, however, we must\r\nnot ignore the factors that dominate the global issues of\r\ntoday but which were not discernible at the time of the\r\nProgrammes adoption. Since that time, the world has\r\nchanged in many ways that no one envisaged, and new\r\nobstacles and challenges have arisen as a result.\r\nConsiderable obstacles remain on achieving\r\ndecent standards of social development. A notable\r\nconstraint is the increased strain on precious resources,\r\nwhich are increasingly being diverted to meet new and\r\nemerging threats to peace, security, democracy and the\r\nrule of law. Other negative developments include the\r\ngrowing loss of domestic policy leverage as a result of\r\nglobalization, the falling volume of the international\r\ntrade of middle-income and less developed countries,\r\nincreasing oil prices, the widening digital divide and\r\nthe globalization of terror.\r\nAll those factors continue to severely affect many\r\ndeveloping countries, especially middle-income and\r\nless developed countries. As a result, those countries\r\nhave a severely limited ability to mobilize domestic\r\nresources, meaning that less attention can be given to\r\nvital sectors. The continued reduction in the quality of\r\nforeign aid, coupled with the growing strain on\r\ndomestic resources, has only deepened the perception\r\nof inequality and inequity within societies. That stark,\r\nongoing reality affects young people, who are so vital\r\nfor the continued development of our societies.\r\nAnother contemporary phenomenon affecting\r\nyouth in developing countries such as mine is large-\r\nscale migration abroad, as young people look for work\r\nand better living conditions. While that phenomenon\r\nhelps both the receiving and sending countries, it has\r\nalso created new challenges. In that regard, we are\r\nheartened that the outcome document of the recently\r\nconcluded summit has referred to the issue of\r\nmigration and that the next session of the General\r\nAssembly will discuss the issue of migration and\r\ndevelopment. Since the phenomenon of migration\r\n16\r\nA/60/PV.28\r\nprimarily affects youth and their aspirations, it is\r\nessential that all United Nations agencies make every\r\neffort to mainstream the issue of migration in all its\r\naspects.\r\nI shall now say a few words about the progress\r\nmade in implementing the World Programme of Action\r\nfor Youth in Sri Lanka.\r\nIn Sri Lanka the Ministry of Youth Affairs and\r\nSports has taken several steps to promote youth\r\nactivities. Those include the promotion of youth clubs,\r\nthe establishment of technical and vocational training\r\ncentres and the organization of cultural exchanges and\r\nintegration activities. Training activities are conducted\r\nin various fields to improve the skills and abilities of\r\nyoung people who leave school and guide them\r\ntowards decent employment. Sports and recreation\r\nfacilities contribute to nurturing a healthy generation of\r\nyouth and create opportunities for the better utilization\r\nof time.\r\nAs a country with good social indicators, Sri\r\nLanka has always given high priority to programmes\r\nrelated to youth and has taken into account the views\r\nand concerns of young people in formulating national\r\npolicies and strategies, especially with respect to\r\neducation and employment. The national action plans\r\nof Sri Lanka have focused on enhancing the quality of\r\neducation and on providing equal opportunities for\r\nemployment. Youth participation in sub-national and\r\nnational decision-making processes has always been\r\nencouraged as a matter of national policy.\r\nFor many years throughout our 2,500-year\r\nrecorded history, and especially since the provision of\r\nuniversal franchise for our people in 1931, we have\r\nbeen mindful that it is young people that make or break\r\na society. Hence, we are committed to the welfare of\r\nyouth in order to ensure the well-being of our society.\r\nMr. Peretin (Croatia): My name is Matej Peretin,\r\nand I am a youth delegate and a member of the\r\nCroatian delegation to the sixtieth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. I am 14 years old and a first-year\r\nstudent at the Petar Preradović grammar school in\r\nSlatina, a town in northern Croatia. I was recently\r\nelected President of the Local Youth Council of\r\nSlatina, which operates within the framework of the\r\nCroatian National Youth Council.\r\nCroatia has aligned itself with the statement of\r\nthe European Union delivered by the United Kingdom.\r\nI wish to take this opportunity to describe how young\r\npeople in Croatia have implemented, at the local level,\r\nthe recommendations of the World Programme of\r\nAction for Youth and the relevant parts of the\r\nMillennium Goals.\r\nCroatia has had a national youth policy since\r\n2000. Among the key priorities of this policy are the\r\nparticipation of youth in decision-making, non-formal\r\neducation and youth employment. Consistent with the\r\ncall of the World Programme of Action for Youth for\r\nfull and effective participation of youth in the life of\r\nsociety and in decision-making, a National Youth\r\nCouncil was initiated and registered in Croatia in 2001.\r\nThe Council operates as a national civil society\r\norganization, open to all young people in Croatia\r\nbetween the ages of 15 and 29.\r\nThe Croatian National Youth Council has signed\r\na social partnership agreement with the Croatian\r\nGovernment, and the Government has approved the\r\nCouncil as a member of the State working group for\r\nthe elaboration of a national programme of action for\r\nyouth. In 2001, the President of the Council was\r\ninvited to participate in the Croatian Presidents expert\r\ngroup for youth.\r\nThe Council has also represented the interests of\r\nCroatian youth at a number of international events,\r\nincluding, inter alia, the fourth session of the World\r\nYouth Forum, held in Dakar; the International Labour\r\nOrganization Global Employment Forum; and the\r\nWorld Summit on the Information Society, held in\r\nGeneva. In 2005, the Council was awarded the World\r\nYouth Award by the World Assembly of Youth as one\r\nof the three most effective national youth councils\r\nglobally. The Secretary-General of the Croatian\r\nNational Youth Council serves as the Vice-President of\r\nthe World Assembly of Youth.\r\nThe network of local youth councils in Croatia\r\nrelies significantly upon information and\r\ncommunications technology. I invite delegates to visit\r\nthe Croatian National Youth Council booth near\r\nConference Room 4 here at United Nations\r\nHeadquarters to learn more about the Councils\r\ngovernance and activities.\r\nThe Croatian delegation invites youth delegates\r\nand Governments of Member States to re-commit\r\nthemselves to the implementation of the World\r\nProgramme of Action for Youth. In this regard, we\r\nencourage Member States that have not yet done so to\r\n17\r\nA/60/PV.28\r\nconsider adopting a full and effective youth\r\nparticipation agenda at all levels of Government in\r\nrelation to the social, economic and political processes\r\nthat concern young people. In Croatia, we have found\r\nthat direct elections for local youth councils have been\r\nimportant in strengthening legitimacy. In addition,\r\ncooperation between local civil society organizations,\r\ngovernmental bodies and the private sector can be\r\nhelpful in developing funding schemes for employment\r\nand educational opportunities for youth.\r\nFinally, allow me to draw the Assemblys\r\nattention to a Croatian initiative. In 2002, we began\r\nnegotiations on the establishment of a Croatian Youth\r\nBank, focused on job creation for young people. In the\r\nsame year, youth representatives from around the world\r\ngathered in Croatia and expressed their will to be\r\nincluded in the process of establishing a world youth\r\nbank. In 2002, a special resolution on a world youth\r\nbank was adopted by most representatives of national\r\nyouth councils across the globe. The World Youth\r\nBank Network, an international non-governmental\r\norganization that is the preparatory body for the\r\nestablishment of a world youth bank, is now operating\r\nfrom its administrative headquarters in Zagreb. It is my\r\npleasure to invite all participants to join us tomorrow at\r\nthe World Youth Bank Project side event, which will\r\nfocus on a potential strategy to address the global\r\nproblem of the high level of youth unemployment.\r\nMembers can also learn more about this project on the\r\nWorld Wide Web at www.w-yb.org.\r\nFinally, allow me to express the intention of the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Croatia to continue to\r\nattach special importance to the implementation of the\r\nWorld Programme of Action for Youth.\r\nMs. Hennouda (Algeria) (spoke in French): It is\r\nan honour for me to represent my country at this youth\r\nforum. We particularly welcome the presence of young\r\npeople at the United Nations today, as well as the\r\naspirations they are expressing.\r\nThe reports we are hearing today as we consider\r\nthe implementation of the World Programme of Action\r\nfor Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond, adopted 10\r\nyears ago, give us a glimpse of the development of\r\nyouth and assess the Programmes 10 priority areas so\r\nthat we can fill the gaps. We note with satisfaction the\r\nincreased awareness by States of the importance of\r\nyoung peoples potential and of involving them in the\r\ndecision-making process. We also welcome national\r\nefforts to ensure gender equality, and we encourage\r\nStates to continue making progress on education and\r\nliteracy.\r\nHowever, continuing youth unemployment, the\r\nconsequences of drug use and HIV/AIDS arouse our\r\nanxiety and concern, since they threaten the lives and\r\nenvironment of our young people.\r\nThe World Youth Report 2005 (A/60/61) draws\r\nour attention, in particular, to the impact of\r\nglobalization and of the information and\r\ncommunications technology, which are described as\r\nadditional issues of concern which youth and their\r\nleaders must face.\r\nCertainly, globalization continues to give rise to\r\nambivalent feelings, on the one hand because of its\r\nability to create wealth and improve the material well-\r\nbeing of our societies, but, on the other, because of the\r\nphenomenon of exclusion that it creates. How can we\r\ndiminish this exclusion? How can we move towards\r\noverall prosperity? How can we benefit from\r\nglobalization, create jobs for young people and\r\neradicate poverty? How can we ensure that information\r\nand telecommunications technology becomes a means\r\nfor rapprochement, mutual understanding and the\r\nstrengthening of links among young people throughout\r\nthe world?\r\nToday, we must find solutions to those questions\r\nin order to attain the goals we set at the time of the\r\nadoption of the World Programme of Action for Youth.\r\nOur Governments have the tasks of understanding\r\nglobalization in order to better harness it, generating\r\ninnovative ideas for job creation, steering young\r\npeople away from drugs and protecting them from\r\nHIV/AIDS. To succeed, Governments must deal with\r\nthose challenges together with young people by\r\ndirectly involving them in the identification of their\r\nproblems and the search for solutions.\r\nAlgeria attaches great importance to young\r\npeople, who constitute three quarters of the countrys\r\npopulation. The countrys public authorities, conscious\r\nof that reality, are making significant efforts to\r\nintegrate that force for development into society,\r\nregardless of gender.\r\nThe Government has made a strategic and\r\nproductive investment in education. All categories of\r\npublic education institutions are free at all levels.\r\nPublic education is mandatory and provided for all, and\r\n18\r\nA/60/PV.28\r\nwe have achieved a 93.6 per cent rate of school\r\nattendance among young people. The Government has\r\ndealt with the issue of youth not enrolled in school\r\nthrough special measures to ensure their social and\r\nprofessional integration.\r\nThe national employment policy, which occupies\r\nan important place in overall Government policy, is\r\nsupported by a national strategy aimed at fighting\r\npoverty and exclusion. The Government of my country\r\nhas implemented alternative employment measures\r\nessentially managed by a network of agencies\r\nspecialized in promoting youth employment.\r\nThe unemployment rate has been reduced thanks\r\nto innovative measures such as microcredits, the\r\npromotion of entrepreneurship, labour-intensive work\r\nof public utility, pre-employment contracts, local\r\nsalaried employee initiatives and compensation for\r\nactivities of general benefit. Many young people have\r\nbeen able to acquire professional experience and\r\npractical knowledge making them employable.\r\nDetermined to pursue its efforts and respond to\r\nthe expectations of young people, Algeria has just\r\ncarried out a study on their aspirations, resulting in a\r\ndatabase on young people  girls and boys  of all\r\nprofessional categories, ages and education levels, with\r\nrespect to their needs and aspirations in the numerous\r\nareas of their life such as their relationships with\r\nfamily, school and teachers, the street, youth\r\nestablishments, health, languages, the role of women,\r\nsports, leisure activities, information and\r\ncommunication technologies, politics and the future.\r\nThat study has shown that, while progress has\r\nbeen made in various areas of concern to young people,\r\ndomestic and international challenges, which are now\r\ninterlinked, remain to be tackled. In response to\r\nglobalization, the information society and\r\ncommunication technologies, at the domestic level we\r\nmust promote leisure activities for young people as a\r\nmeans of social integration, provide quality education,\r\nensure the highest level of professional qualifications\r\namong youth, create an environment favourable to our\r\nintellectual elite so as to halt their emigration, and\r\nensure sustainable employment.\r\nTo achieve those goals, my country will once\r\nagain consult young people to collect their opinions on\r\nthe proposed solutions. We are convinced that the\r\nrecommendations contained in the reports of the\r\nSecretary-General will provide relevant guidelines for\r\nour countrys success in its mission.\r\nThe Acting President: I should like to inform the\r\nAssembly that the representatives of Lesotho and\r\nNicaragua have requested to participate in this\r\nmeeting. As the list of speakers was closed at 11 a.m.\r\nthis morning, may I ask the Assembly whether there is\r\nany objection to the inclusion of those delegations in\r\nthe list of speakers?\r\nI see none. Lesotho and Nicaragua are therefore\r\nincluded in the list of speakers.\r\nI remind speakers that we now have 16 speakers\r\non our list for this meeting. Given the time limit and in\r\norder to accommodate all speakers for this meeting, I\r\nurge speakers to limit their statements to four minutes.\r\nMs. Mchiela (Malawi): Let me begin by aligning\r\nmy delegation with the statement made by\r\nMozambique on behalf of the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community (SADC). I would also like to\r\ncongratulate the Secretary-General for his\r\ncomprehensive report contained in document A/60/61.\r\nThe World Youth Report 2005 states that sub-\r\nSaharan Africa is home to large numbers of young\r\npeople living in extreme poverty. It has been proven\r\nthat when the health, education and employment needs\r\nof the youth are addressed in earnest, the result is\r\npoverty reduction, economic growth and human\r\ndevelopment. The international community has the\r\nmoral obligation to match its youth-related\r\nprogrammes with the requisite resources.\r\nMalawi attaches great importance to youth\r\nparticipation. We believe that the involvement of youth\r\nin decisions that affect society is beneficial from both a\r\npolicy-making and a youth development perspective.\r\nWe have learned over time that failure to acknowledge\r\nthe particular challenges that youth face or to involve\r\nthem in devising solutions leads to failure in reducing\r\noverall poverty levels. In recognition of that fact, the\r\npoverty reduction and economic growth strategies put\r\nin place by the Malawian Government have\r\nincorporated youth programmes.\r\nMalawi has a national youth policy that guides\r\nyouth development programmes and services with the\r\nfull participation of young people at all levels. That has\r\nled to a mushrooming of youth clubs and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations.\r\n19\r\nA/60/PV.28\r\nThrough its national AIDS commission, Malawi\r\ncontinues to implement programmes focusing on\r\nsupport, treatment and care for those infected and\r\naffected by HIV/AIDS. In addition, the national plan of\r\naction for orphans and other vulnerable children was\r\nlaunched to deal with the unprecedented number of\r\norphans and strengthen the capacity of families and\r\ncommunities to provide adequate care and support for\r\nthose affected. A life-skills programme targeting youth\r\nis an important component of the action plan.\r\nConvinced that empowering youth through\r\neducation will enable them to have equal access to\r\nparticipation in the national development agenda,\r\nMalawi implemented universal free primary education\r\nunder the national Education for All programme.\r\nThrough that programme, the enrolment of pupils in\r\nprimary schools increased tremendously. However,\r\naccess to secondary and tertiary education remains a\r\nserious challenge for all children, particularly orphans\r\nand youth from poor families, owing to the lack of\r\nfunds for school fees and other educational support.\r\nOne initiative in that respect is the provision of student\r\ngrants. Nevertheless, the number of beneficiaries is far\r\ninferior to the demand coming from of needy youth.\r\nMr. Gaspar Martins (Angola), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nMalawi has implemented several initiatives to\r\nprotect youth at risk of being abused. They include\r\nvocational skills training for self-help, training in\r\nentrepreneurship, the review of laws on child justice,\r\ncare and protection and the training of social workers.\r\nFurther, the Government has introduced measures such\r\nas the creation of a revolving fund for loans to youth to\r\ngive young people access to financial capital to a set up\r\nsmall businesses.\r\nLeisure activities are an important aspect of\r\nyouth development. Malawi continues to establish\r\nyouth centres in urban and rural areas. The aim of\r\nthose centres is to engage youth in extra-curricular\r\nactivities for their physical growth and mental\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn conclusion, Malawi is committed to keeping\r\nyouth issues high on its development agenda. I would\r\nalso like to stress the critical importance of\r\ninternational cooperation if developing countries such\r\nas Malawi are to fulfil the Millennium Development\r\nGoals and the priority areas of the World Programme\r\nof Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond.\r\nMr. García González (El Salvador) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): El Salvador fully endorses the statement of\r\nthe Rio Group on this item.\r\nThe Government of El Salvador was committed\r\nto sending a high-level representative to this meeting to\r\nreview the 10 years of the World Programme of Action\r\nfor Youth: the Secretary of Youth, who holds a national\r\noffice created in 2004 with the fundamental objective\r\nof ensuring the active participation of young people in\r\ndecisions of national interest and on issues that directly\r\naffect youth.\r\nHowever, two natural disasters of great\r\ndestructive power  the eruption of the Ilamatepec\r\nvolcano and the flooding caused by Tropical Storm\r\nStan  have caused the death of 62 Salvadorans and\r\nthe evacuation of 53,930 others throughout the country\r\nover the last three days, compelling our Government to\r\ndeclare a state of national emergency and to suspend\r\nofficial engagements scheduled for the present so that\r\nGovernment officials can attend first and foremost to\r\nthe emergency.\r\nGiven the negative impact of those natural\r\ndisasters on the sustainable development of our\r\ncountry, and given the vulnerability of young people,\r\namong other social groups, to natural disasters, we\r\nbelieve that we should focus our statement on the\r\nintrinsic links between hunger, poverty, the\r\nenvironment and situations of risk for young people, in\r\nparticular the violence caused by the activities of youth\r\ngangs. Those issues fall within the three main clusters\r\nof issues proposed by the Secretary-General in his\r\nWorld Youth Report 2005 (A/60/61).\r\nAs President Elías Antonio Saca González noted\r\nin his address to the Assembly at the sixtieth session\r\n(see A/60/PV.12), in spite of our countrys determined\r\ncommitment to achieve the Millennium Development\r\nGoals, in particular the reduction of poverty and the\r\nfight against hunger, the negative impact on\r\ndevelopment caused by external factors such as costly\r\nfuel and natural disasters of the kind striking our\r\ncountry in recent weeks is cause for concern.\r\nMy country notes that those factors require a\r\nsignificant share of our human and financial resources,\r\ncompelling us to redirect to those emergencies\r\nresources that could have been used in strategic areas\r\nof development. Thus, there is a clear link between the\r\nfight against poverty and hunger on the one hand and,\r\non the other, the protection of the environment and the\r\n20\r\nA/60/PV.28\r\nreduction of vulnerabilities related to outstanding\r\ndevelopment issues.\r\nYoung people constitute the largest segment of\r\nthe population of El Salvador. Thus, the policies and\r\nactions currently being implemented to tackle\r\ndevelopment challenges directly affect young people.\r\nEl Salvador responded by appointing a Secretary of\r\nYouth, whose department is working, with broad\r\nparticipation, on a national youth policy.\r\nThat policy covers various objectives related to\r\nyoung people, such as improving their quality of life\r\nand their development at all levels and attending to the\r\nneeds of vulnerable and marginalized sectors of youth.\r\nTo achieve those objectives, concrete action is being\r\ntaken in five main areas: promoting the independence\r\nof young people, promoting their well-being,\r\ndeveloping awareness of their civic responsibilities,\r\nsupporting the development of the creativity of youth\r\nand creating opportunities for vulnerable and\r\nmarginalized youth.\r\nAs well, it is necessary to coordinate the various\r\nefforts and initiatives of the Office of the Secretary of\r\nYouth, public institutions and non-governmental and\r\nprivate-sector organizations involved in the promotion\r\nof youth issues, as well as those of youth organizations\r\nand movements, which are a focus and the\r\nbeneficiaries of that national policy.\r\nIt is important to stress that the Government of\r\nEl Salvador considers that young people represent not\r\nonly the future hope of the country but also a source of\r\ngreat potential for the present. A sign of that\r\ncommitment was the appointment of the Secretary of\r\nYouth, whose main tasks include the promotion of\r\nsport as a way to turn youth, and the general\r\npopulation, away from vice and idleness.\r\nAllow me to conclude by recognizing the fact that\r\nin a globalized world, in which information\r\ntechnologies play an important role in highlighting\r\nareas of common interest for young people, it is\r\nincreasingly clear that international cooperation,\r\nrespect for the purposes and the principles of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations and solidarity constitute\r\nthe cornerstone for constructive progress in creating a\r\nsociety for all ages.\r\nMs. Taj El Dine (Bolivarian Republic of\r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of the\r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela, we express our\r\ngratitude for the holding of these meetings. We endorse\r\nthe statement made by the representative of Argentina\r\non behalf of the Rio Group.\r\nFirst, we note that with everything that has been\r\ndone over the past 10 years, the only result we have\r\nachieved is that the worlds young people continue to\r\nsuffer from hunger, poverty, unemployment and a lack\r\nof education, all of which are products of the dominant\r\neconomic system. In other words, they are the result of\r\nthe policies of the United States of America and its\r\nallies, which implement policies against the interests of\r\nthe entire world, with the single objective of increasing\r\nexploitation and legitimizing and safeguarding its\r\ndomination of the worlds markets, resources and\r\npeoples.\r\nBy contrast, the Bolivarian Republic of\r\nVenezuela has implemented a set of social measures\r\nwithin the framework of a holistic State social policy to\r\npromote economic and social development from a\r\nhumanist perspective. In that context, our Government\r\nhas been implementing a series of social programmes,\r\ncalled missions, aimed at integrating young people, in\r\nparticular marginalized young people, into the social\r\ndevelopment of the country. Among them are the\r\nRobinson, Ribas and Sucre missions. The Robinson\r\nmission has succeeded in teaching more than 1.5\r\nmillion people to read and write. In a few days, our\r\ncountry will be declared an illiteracy-free zone. More\r\nthan 600,000 young people have graduated thanks to\r\nthe Ribas mission. For economic reasons, those young\r\npeople had never had the opportunity to pursue their\r\nsecondary education, and have now done so without\r\ncost. Our Government even gives them a grant to carry\r\nout their studies. The Sucre mission is open to young\r\npeople from the Ribas mission and to marginalized\r\nyoung people so that they can enter university.\r\nIn addition, young people in Venezuela are\r\ninvolved in the political life of the State. For example,\r\ncitizens having reached the age of 21 can run for office\r\nas members of the National Assembly.\r\nAll those initiatives aim to fulfil the\r\nconstitutional principle of a genuinely participatory\r\nand activist democracy, of the people, for the people\r\nand with the people.\r\nIn our countries, young people have a notable\r\nrole in the fight against imperialism. In Venezuela, we\r\nare aware of the fact that young people of the entire\r\nworld have been affected by the consequences of the\r\n21\r\nA/60/PV.28\r\nneo-liberal policies of the International Monetary\r\nFund, the World Bank, the World Trade Organization\r\nand the Group of Eight. The gap between the rich and\r\nthe poor is widening. Exploitation, hunger,\r\nunemployment, inadequate health care, poverty and\r\ndestitution continue to grow as a result of imperialist\r\neconomic and military policies that have catastrophic\r\neffects for millions of people throughout the world,\r\nincluding youth.\r\nOur message is that we, the young, must fight\r\nagainst hunger and war and fight for peace, social\r\njustice, the self-determination of peoples and a world\r\nfree of nuclear weapons. We must fight for our roots.\r\nWe must fight for our traditions and cultures  in\r\nshort, for our dignity. That is our foremost duty as\r\nyoung people. We must ensure that the world\r\nrecognizes the value of those aspirations. It is also our\r\nduty to ensure that humankind survives the destruction\r\nthat threatens our environment.\r\nI recall once more the words of President Hugo\r\nRafael Chávez Frías: neither our arms nor our souls\r\nshall rest until humankind has been saved.\r\nMr. Gómez Robledo (Mexico) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): It is a great honour for Mexico to participate\r\nin this meeting to assess progress in the\r\nimplementation of the World Programme of Action for\r\nYouth to the Year 2000 and Beyond, which has seen\r\nthe significant participation of young people from\r\naround the world. It would difficult to imagine\r\nimplementing the World Programme of Action or\r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals without\r\nthe participation of young people. These meetings have\r\nshown that.\r\nMexico associates itself with the statement made\r\nby the delegation of Argentina on behalf of the Rio\r\nGroup. We shall take this opportunity to share some of\r\nour experiences with implementation of the World\r\nProgramme of Action.\r\nFollowing the Programmes adoption, the bodies\r\nresponsible for formulating and implementing\r\nMexicos youth policies underwent a profound change.\r\nThe Government formulated a youth strategy based on\r\na recognition of the importance of the needs of youth,\r\nin particular economic issues, social inclusion, equity\r\nand respect for the diversity of youth, and affirming the\r\nprinciple of the full participation of youth in decision-\r\nmaking.\r\nIn accordance with that vision, the Mexican\r\nYouth Institute was created as a governmental body\r\ncharged with designing and implementing a national\r\npolicy for the full integration of youth in the countrys\r\ndevelopment. With the Institutes coordination, the first\r\nnational youth programme was established, its is a\r\ncombined effort among young people, society and the\r\nGovernment. The national youth programme has three\r\nkey goals: to promote the enhancement of the quality\r\nof life and well-being of young people, to generate\r\nareas of opportunity for the development of collective\r\nand individual abilities and to create equitable\r\nconditions for marginalized youth.\r\nThe participation of young people is a component\r\nof the national youth programme, because of their\r\ncapacity for action and because such participation is\r\nneeded for an effective assessment of their situation, as\r\nthey are actors in national development. Recognizing\r\nthe importance of their participation, the programme\r\nalso aims to create conditions in which young people\r\ncan engage in development activities, taking into\r\nconsideration the countrys varied conditions and\r\npluralism.\r\nThe Mexican Youth Institutes various\r\nprogrammes seek to fully integrate young people into\r\npublic life. Through dialogue mechanisms with a\r\nvariety of sectors, the Institute promotes conditions for\r\nyoung peoples access to opportunities for\r\ncomprehensive development, the enhancement of\r\nquality of life and more complete participation in areas\r\nrelated to their aspirations and demands. In that way,\r\nthe programmes have helped develop the participation\r\nof young people in civic life and promote a positive\r\nvision of youth, which, in turn, enables them to achieve\r\nbetter social integration.\r\nThrough that formula of dialogue and\r\nparticipation, the youth of Mexico have been made\r\naware that Government stands by their side. The\r\nGovernment of the Republic consults them on the\r\nformulation of policies of concern to youth, such as\r\nthose related to the implementation of the World\r\nProgramme of Action. Our legislature recently held a\r\nfirst Model United Nations in the Congress. It brought\r\ntogether young people from all over the country and\r\nprovided a valuable forum for understanding their\r\nconcerns on important issues.\r\nThat effort is also reflected in the inclusion today,\r\nfor the first time, of two young people in the delegation\r\n22\r\nA/60/PV.28\r\nof Mexico for this session of the General Assembly,\r\nwhich is a source of great satisfaction. Let us hope that\r\nthis is only the beginning of an ongoing practice.\r\nThe new generation of Mexican youth is aware of\r\nthe varied and multicultural nature of Mexican society.\r\nThe Government is committed to implementing the\r\nWorld Programme of Action. Our progress in the 10\r\npriority areas of the Programme has been shared with\r\nother countries of our region and was presented as a\r\ncontribution to the report of the Secretary-General\r\n(A/60/61).\r\nWe support the inclusion of the five additional\r\npriority areas set out in draft resolution A/60/L.2. We\r\nare committed to continue taking the relevant measures\r\nto assess the situation of youth with respect to those\r\nareas and taking the corresponding action.\r\nMr. Samkharadze (Georgia): First, I would like\r\nto express my gratitude to the United Nations, the\r\nworlds most important organization, and to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan for giving young people of many\r\ncountries the opportunity to speak before the Assembly\r\non youth problems and how to solve them.\r\nThe Anti-drug Society, of which I am President,\r\nis a non-governmental organization in Georgia that has\r\nbeen fighting drugs since 1999. Student organizations\r\nfrom various institutions of higher education have\r\njoined our young anti-narcotics coalition. Working\r\njointly, we are trying to crack down on the problem by\r\narranging seminars, exhibitions and sports events.\r\nI would like to draw the attention of the\r\nAssembly to several issues of concern to the peoples of\r\nthe world, especially young people.\r\nToday we are witnessing a critical trend: the\r\nnumber of young drug addicts is increasing rapidly.\r\nThis is becoming a global problem with terrible\r\nconsequences, because most drug addicts become\r\nsocially unstable and often turn to crime.\r\nUnfortunately, such young people are not willing, nor\r\ndo they have ability, to become full members of society\r\nor to be useful to it. We can even say that they are\r\nbeing lost as individuals and lost as citizens.\r\nNarcotics and terrorism are interrelated, because\r\nnarcotics are the main source of financing for\r\nterrorism. Also important is the harm done to\r\neconomies, as countries are incurring losses of billions\r\nof dollars. Unfortunately, drug addicts often do not\r\nknow that the money they pay for another dose of\r\nnarcotics helps terrorists buy ultra-modern weapons\r\nand ammunition. In my opinion, this important aspect\r\nof the question merits particular attention. That money\r\nhelps many terrorist organizations worldwide and\r\nenables terrorists to commit terrible acts almost every\r\nday, the world over. We young people must see that our\r\npeers think about this.\r\nThe ecological damage that the world is facing is\r\nno less important. Hundreds of thousands of acres of\r\nforests are cut down to produce drugs. Various\r\nchemicals and other dangerous substances from illegal\r\nlaboratories are polluting lakes, rivers and seas and are\r\nharming both flora and fauna.\r\nAnother factor is psychological damage. Of\r\ncourse, this is by no means a complete list, but each of\r\nthose issues includes elements with the potential for\r\ncausing a major disaster. I think that this is an\r\ninarguable fact.\r\nPolitical, economic, psychological and social\r\nsciences have given us a broad range of knowledge\r\nover the ages. It is important to organize the\r\ninformation into a kind of system and to analyse it\r\nproperly. Only in that way will we be able to\r\nunderstand the facts.\r\nThe twenty-first century is a time of integrated\r\nthinking. I should like to take this unique opportunity\r\nto recall the events of 11 September 2001. I still cannot\r\nfind a suitable definition for that destructive event, and\r\nI think I never will. One thing is obvious: an evil was\r\ndone that cannot be undone.\r\nIn my opinion, the attack of 11 September was\r\nnot just an attack on a particular building, country or\r\npeople. It was an attack on the idea of democracy\r\nitself.\r\nI want to address the youth of the world and ask\r\nthem to unite in a resolute fight against drug addiction.\r\nWe must not feed the monster which threatens us with\r\ndestruction. We must explain the unpleasant truth to\r\nour peers: that with the money paid for each dose of\r\ndrugs, which adds up to hundreds of billions of dollars\r\nthroughout the world, terrorists do not build shelters\r\nfor homeless children, hospitals or houses of worship;\r\nthey use that money for their sick, vandalistic aims.\r\nI am asking the Assembly to unite in the fight\r\nagainst drug addiction. We do not want the future to be\r\nin the hands of unstable individuals, which would be a\r\n23\r\nA/60/PV.28\r\ncatastrophe and jeopardize the stability and the\r\ndemocratic development of humankind.\r\nMs. Amati (San Marino): Youth is our future. I\r\ndecided to begin my brief statement with this motto\r\nbecause I believe that these four words sum up what\r\nthe Republic of San Marino, together with the United\r\nNations, believes.\r\nThe world we live in has changed completely in\r\nrecent decades, as we have achieved the important goal\r\nof globalization. My generation is particularly\r\nfortunate, because we have a chance to relate to other\r\nyoung people from all over the world. We can share\r\nour culture with them, and at the same time we get to\r\nlearn about theirs.\r\nI am very glad to have the chance to attend\r\ntodays plenary meeting, dedicated to us, the youth of\r\nthe world. The United Nations is the arena where we\r\ncan best discuss our future.\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan has stated that\r\neducation is a human right. We could not agree more.\r\nThe importance of education is multifaceted; it is the\r\nfoundation of a more advanced and developed society.\r\nOne of most important actions we can take in\r\nfavour of young people and of the advancement of our\r\nsocieties is to give our young people a good, sound\r\neducation which will serve them well in future.\r\nThe Republic of San Marino believes that\r\neducation must have first place on our scale of\r\npriorities. In order to provide a good education to\r\nyoung citizens, our Government not only invests\r\neconomic resources in education but provides honour\r\nstudents with financial aid.\r\nEducation is based on both study and culture.\r\nCulture is what one gets from ones family, what one\r\nlearns in ones country and from ones country;\r\nbasically, it is ones history; everyone has his or her\r\nown.\r\nIn our culture, in San Marino, the family plays a\r\nkey role in forming new generations. The relationship\r\nbetween young family members and their elders is very\r\nstrong and allows young people to learn, from\r\nchildhood on, valuable lessons about aspects of their\r\nbackground  lessons that will help them in future.\r\nThat is why I would like to encourage everyone\r\npresent today to re-evaluate the needs of young people\r\nand to consider what their elders can give to them.\r\nThe Acting President: Brief, to the point and\r\nbeautiful, like San Marino.\r\nMr. Rustom (Syrian Arab Republic): I should\r\nlike to shed some light on the status of Syrian young\r\npeople and on the challenges facing them in the third\r\nmillennium.\r\nSyria has a very young population; young people\r\naged 15 to 25 constitute about 25 per cent of the total\r\npopulation. Moreover, the relatively high population\r\ngrowth rate  24.5 births per 1,000  is leading to an\r\nincrease in the number of young people as a percentage\r\nof the total population. Furthermore, the number of\r\nstudents has increased, leading to higher public\r\nexpenditures in the area of education, from 7.6 per cent\r\nin 1983 to 15 per cent in 2002.\r\nThis large number of young people is a great\r\nasset to the nation, but it also creates a number of\r\nchallenges, which the Government has worked hard to\r\nface.\r\nThe Government of the Syrian Arab Republic has\r\nconsistently focused on education. It has ensured\r\neducation for all by making it compulsory and free.\r\nEducational curricula are revised and modified\r\nregularly. For instance, counselling has been included\r\nin the educational curriculum since 2001, as well as\r\nforeign languages and information technology. In order\r\nto eradicate the stereotyped image of women, curricula\r\nwere modified to include new concepts, such as gender\r\nequality. In addition, Syria has provided the necessary\r\ninfrastructure to expand Internet service country-wide\r\nin order to encourage distance learning.\r\nIn the field of information technology (IT) and\r\ncommunications, Syria has developed a strategy for the\r\nrelevant technologies. In that connection, many\r\nmechanisms have been put in place, such as the Syrian\r\nHigher Education and Research Network and, in 2002,\r\nthe Virtual Learning University. Moreover, in 2004,\r\nReefNet was launched in three villages through\r\ncooperation between the Ministry of Communications\r\nand Technology and the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme.\r\nThe Ministry of Health, in cooperation with the\r\nWorld Health Organization (WHO), launched the\r\nAdolescent Health Programme in 2002, which targets\r\nthe 10-19 age group, about 4.5 million inhabitants. The\r\nProgramme aims to promote adolescent health\r\nstandards through health education on health-related\r\n24\r\nA/60/PV.28\r\nissues in general, and on reproductive health in\r\nparticular.\r\nAs for youth and HIV/AIDS, the Ministry of\r\nHealth has adopted the National Programme for AIDS\r\nControl, which puts in place measures to prevent HIV\r\ninfection and sexually transmitted diseases. Statistics\r\nreveal that the number of patients with HIV/AIDS\r\nreached 272 in 2002.\r\nDrug abuse is not widespread among Syrian\r\nyoung people. The rate of addiction among the total\r\npopulation is 127 per million, and the incidence among\r\nyoung people under the age of 18 is even smaller. That\r\nis due to many factors  religious, social, familial and\r\nmoral.\r\nWith regard to tobacco control, Syria ratified the\r\nWorld Health Organizations Framework Convention\r\non Tobacco Control in 2003. The average number of\r\ncigarettes smoked by young people in Syria is about\r\n3 per day.\r\nSyria recently became a State party to the Youth\r\nEmployment Network. The Syrian strategy on the\r\nemployment of youth is going to be managed and\r\nimplemented at all stages through community\r\ninteraction, including partners from all sectors  the\r\npublic, private and civil society. That strategy, which\r\ntargets young people aged 18 to 25, aims to\r\nrehabilitate, qualify, train, and, subsequently, help\r\nyoung people to enter the labour market.\r\nSyria has oriented all its development plans\r\ntowards achieving the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nWith regard to young people and work in the\r\nprivate sector, many projects have been established,\r\nincluding the BIDAYA programme, whose mission is\r\nto work with young people and provide access to\r\nfinancial support for those with a viable business\r\nproposition who are unable to find help elsewhere. The\r\nword bidaya means beginning in Arabic. It is also\r\nan acronym for Boosting and Inspiring Dynamic\r\nYouth Achievement. The programme will provide\r\nsuccessful applicants with volunteer business mentors\r\nand full access to the organizations local and national\r\nbusiness support network.\r\nAnother programme for young people, the Syrian\r\nYoung Entrepreneurs Association, was the brainchild\r\nof enthusiastic and dedicated young businesspeople\r\nwho felt that they should make a contribution to the\r\nenhancement of the countrys business community by\r\ntapping the resources of its most dynamic constituents,\r\nyoung people. The Syrian Young Entrepreneurs\r\nAssociation is a non-governmental/non-profit\r\norganization that strives to inspire a strong\r\nentrepreneurial mindset and skills among Syrias\r\npromising young people. It aims to enhance their\r\nprofessional and personal competencies in the national\r\nand global economy. Moreover, the programme seeks\r\nto provide a clearinghouse for local and expatriate\r\nexperiences, thereby ensuring a prosperous future for\r\nSyria.\r\nSyrias juvenile delinquency law of 1974\r\nconsiders delinquent juveniles to be victims. In 2004,\r\nthe Ministry of the Interior, in cooperation with\r\nUNICEF, held three training workshops for officers\r\nand agents of the criminal security service and the\r\npolice force on how to interrogate and deal with\r\njuveniles.\r\nFinally, I would like to refer to the role of the\r\nSyrian Commission for Family Affairs and its\r\ncontribution to the welfare of young people. The\r\nCommission has shouldered the responsibility for\r\ndeveloping the Syrian Arab Republics national\r\nstrategy for young people, by, inter alia, establishing\r\nthe Youth National Committee, whose members\r\nrepresent all the ministries and State institutions\r\nworking on youth-related issues, in addition to non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and programmes focusing\r\non young people. In general, when performing its tasks\r\nthe Commission takes into consideration issues related\r\nto gender, people with special needs and refugees.\r\nFinally, I would like to express our appreciation\r\nfor the initiative taken by the United Nations to listen\r\nto the voices of Member States young people, as well\r\nas to improve its plans to secure a better future for\r\nhumankind.\r\nMr. Atsou (Togo) (spoke in French): It is an\r\nhonour for me to speak on behalf of roughly half of the\r\nfive million inhabitants of Togo, who are young\r\npeople, in order to convey to the General Assembly the\r\nefforts Togo has made to implement the World\r\nProgramme of Action for Youth.\r\nAllow me to welcome the presence among us of\r\nother delegations, as well as the ongoing efforts they\r\nare making to ensure that young people are able to\r\nparticipate in society.\r\n25\r\nA/60/PV.28\r\nFollowing summit-level conferences organized by\r\nthe United Nations, humankind has become aware of\r\nthe need to address the issue of development\r\ncomprehensively. Greater consideration of the matter\r\nhas made it possible for us to understand the role and\r\ninvaluable contribution of young people in the process\r\nof building a global economy that meets the needs of\r\nall, as well as their capacity and willingness to\r\ncontribute to the lives of their societies. The world as a\r\nwhole has also become aware of the risks to which\r\nyoung people are exposed.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration and the World\r\nProgramme of Action for Youth, which was adopted by\r\nMember States 10 years ago, are the results of that\r\nawareness. Those tools were conceived with the goal\r\nof ameliorating the difficult problems that rob young\r\npeople of any chance for development, namely, hunger,\r\npoverty, unemployment, juvenile delinquency, drug\r\naddiction, HIV/AIDS, gender-based discrimination,\r\nconflict and marginalization. Those obstacles, among\r\nothers, have impeded us from attaining the desired\r\nresults. With regard to Togo, there are two main\r\nreasons for the lack of progress in implementing the\r\ncommitments of the World Programme of Action for\r\nYouth.\r\nOn the one hand, despite the Governments good\r\nwill and that of young peoples groups and other\r\nactors, the lack of financial resources  a\r\ncharacteristic of most developing States  has been\r\nthe major limitation to every policy aimed at\r\nimproving the living standards of young people.\r\nMoreover, Togo has suffered for more than 13 years \r\nand continues to suffer today  from the breakdown in\r\nassistance from its main development partners.\r\nOn the other hand, in the context of an\r\nunfavourable economic environment, the structural\r\nadjustment measures recommended by the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions have contributed to a suspension of\r\nrecruitment in the public sector. Adding to that the low\r\nrate at which the private sector is able to absorb young\r\npeople seeking work and the political crisis in the\r\ncountry, it is easy to understand why Togos young\r\npeople are facing the problems of unemployment,\r\npoverty and the other scourges I have mentioned.\r\nNevertheless, Togos young people are today pleased to\r\nsee that all indicators point to a promising new future.\r\nPresident Faure Essozimna Gnassingbé has\r\nplaced the problems of young people at the centre of\r\nhis programme to structure society on the basis of 20\r\ncommitments. Providing decent employment for young\r\npeople, extending credit to young entrepreneurs, giving\r\nuniversities the logistical and human resources needed\r\nto provide good training for young people, and full and\r\neffective participation by youth in the political,\r\neconomic and social life of the country, are among the\r\nmain policies of the programme established by Togos\r\nPresident.\r\nThe Governments meaningful policy of\r\naccording close attention to the problems of young\r\npeople has led to the establishment of the first-ever\r\nState secretariat devoted solely to improving\r\nconditions for young people. This is a tool that\r\nhenceforth will make it possible for us to be the\r\nleading actors in the transformation of society. In\r\naddition, the programme of action put forth by the\r\nNational Union Government, which was made public\r\non 4 July 2005, sends a strong signal testifying to the\r\nresolute determination of the Government of Togo to\r\nplace the improvement of the living conditions of its\r\nyoung people at the centre of its concerns.\r\nLess than 100 days since the establishment of the\r\nNational Union Government, the hopes aroused by that\r\nevent have already been justified vis-à-vis the 10\r\npriority areas targeted by the World Programme of\r\nAction for Youth. In the interests of time, I shall limit\r\nmyself to pointing out only some of the efforts\r\nundertaken in a few areas.\r\nWith regard to education, the section in the\r\nGovernment of Togos programme of action devoted to\r\nsocial development includes significant steps that\r\nshould guarantee a quality education for all of Togos\r\nyoung people. Special emphasis has been placed on the\r\nsituation of teachers, who are mostly young people\r\nthemselves. The Government has committed itself to\r\nensure quality education, not only by giving teachers\r\nappropriate quality training, but also by providing them\r\nworking conditions conducive to giving young pupils\r\nsound instruction and providing free primary education\r\nin order to reach the goal of ensuring schooling for all\r\nby 2015. For their part, students will be encouraged to\r\nexcel by the granting of prizes.\r\nIn the areas of employment, poverty and hunger,\r\nthe Government of Togo has taken several steps by\r\nwhich young people will become the most important\r\nstakeholders in the building of the Togolese economy.\r\nIn that connection, the Prime Minister stated that Togo\r\n26\r\nA/60/PV.28\r\nwould do everything necessary with regard to\r\nemployment in order to ensure that the greatest number\r\nof young people possible will be able to benefit from\r\nemployment as soon as possible. They will be the first\r\nbeneficiaries of the employment and self-employment\r\nprogramme to be established by the Government. They\r\nwill also be active participants in the reconstruction\r\nand consolidation work we are going to undertake.\r\nPutting the Governments words into action, only\r\nsome 45 days following the unveiling of its\r\nprogramme, a first wave of 1,700 young teachers were\r\nrecruited into the civil service. That will be followed\r\nby a second wave in the weeks to come.\r\nThe provision of grants to young people, which\r\nwas also announced in the programme, will allow us to\r\npromote self-employment through the establishment of\r\nsmall- and medium-sized business. That will make it\r\npossible to reduce considerably the number of the\r\nunemployed, thereby also addressing the complicated\r\nissue of poverty. For their part, young peoples groups\r\nand non-governmental organizations (NGO) working in\r\nTogo will also contribute to the extent they are able.\r\nIn that connection, I would like to commend the\r\nefforts of NGOs to halt the social crisis. Despite that,\r\nhowever, their efforts to improve the living conditions\r\nof young people through sustainable development have\r\nbeen very limited for many years.\r\nWe would therefore like to use the forum\r\nprovided by the General Assembly to launch, on behalf\r\nof Togos young people, a resounding and solemn\r\nappeal aimed at all organizations, associations and\r\nother development partners to trust our country and to\r\nextend their assistance to our young people, as well as\r\nto our Government and our NGOs, in order that we\r\nmay overcome the challenges of poverty and hunger\r\nand the other scourges that particularly afflict young\r\npeople.\r\nMr. Ampem (Ghana): May I express my\r\ngratitude for the opportunity to address the General\r\nAssembly on behalf of the young people of Ghana.\r\nMay I also congratulate the United Nations on the\r\noccasion of the tenth anniversary of the World\r\nProgramme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and\r\nBeyond and on the successes in overcoming the\r\nchallenges regarding its implementation thus far.\r\nGhana as a country has drawn much inspiration\r\nfrom the World Programme of Action for Youth since\r\nits adoption in 1995, and has been taking bold steps\r\ntowards the development of Ghanaian young people. A\r\nrevised national youth policy, which was developed on\r\nthe basis of the 10 priority areas identified in the World\r\nProgramme of Action for Youth, is under active\r\nconsideration. Youth organizations under the\r\ncoordination of the Ghana National Youth Council\r\nhave also developed a national youth charter to express\r\nour priorities as Ghanaian young people. It should be\r\ngiven attention by all.\r\nIn order to further reduce unemployment among\r\nyoung people in the country, the Government has\r\nestablished the National Youth Fund, which is aimed at\r\nassisting the countrys young people with funding to\r\nestablish small-scale enterprises.\r\nAnother modest achievement thus far worth\r\nmentioning is the introduction of free primary\r\neducation in the country, which we hope will increase\r\nenrolment.\r\nLike many others in the African region, but\r\nunlike their counterparts in developed countries,\r\nGhanaian young people benefit the least from todays\r\nglobalization. Issues regarding unfair trade and\r\ncompetition must be seriously addressed if we are\r\ngenuinely committed to the full integration of the\r\nworlds economies and societies, as defined by the\r\nWorld Programme of Action for Youth.\r\nWe also ask for well-coordinated and intensive\r\nexchange programmes between young peoples\r\norganizations in the North and the South in order to\r\nfacilitate the exchange of ideas and the spread of\r\ninnovation. May I take this opportunity to commend\r\nthe National Council of Swedish Youth Organizations\r\n(LSU) for taking a bold initiative in that regard. A case\r\nin point is the cooperation between the LSU and the\r\nNational Union of Ghana Students.\r\nGhana strongly supports the call for youth-led\r\ndevelopment, but would like to advise that we not lose\r\nsight of the need to tap the rich experiences gained by\r\nolder generations over the years. There should be a\r\nblend of youthful zeal and the experiences of older\r\npersons.\r\nIt is gratifying to note that the international\r\ncommunity is committed to solving the problem of\r\nyouth unemployment in the world. We wish to propose\r\nthat we ensure that the lions share of the resources\r\nmeant to achieve that are directed to regions of the\r\n27\r\nA/60/PV.28\r\nworld where there is a larger percentage of young\r\npeople  such as Asia and Africa  and where youth\r\nunemployment is also the highest.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to emphasize that the\r\nsuccessful implementation of the World Programme of\r\nAction for Youth and the Millennium Development\r\nGoals will depend to a large extent upon the vibrancy\r\nof our civil societies. Developing nations must\r\ntherefore be encouraged and assisted to develop their\r\ncivil societies and non-governmental organizations,\r\nparticularly those related to youth development.\r\nMs. Al-Hajri (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): I would\r\nlike to express to the President the gratitude of the\r\ndelegation of Qatar for having organized this tenth\r\nanniversary meeting on the World Programme of\r\nAction for Youth for the Year 2000 and Beyond, as\r\nwell as on the Millennium Development Goals that\r\nwere adopted after the Programme. Efforts have been\r\nmade at the regional, national and international levels;\r\nhowever, there is still much to be done to reach the\r\nProgrammes goals.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General entitled\r\nWorld Youth Report 2005 (A/60/61) presents the\r\nissues and invites us to work hard to find expeditious\r\nand appropriate solutions. The report states that there\r\nare over 720 million young people living on two\r\ndollars a day or less. Many must also deal with drug\r\nproblems and diseases such as AIDS. The gap between\r\nyoung people in developed and developing countries is\r\nvery wide. We must try to bridge that gap, especially as\r\nregards the areas of educational technology and\r\ndevelopment, given their effects on young people.\r\nThe State of Qatar has been working on all levels\r\nto ensure a prosperous future for young people. Our\r\nofficial efforts, as well as those of the private sector\r\nand civil society institutions, have been geared towards\r\nimproving the lives of young people. Our Supreme\r\nCouncil for Family Affairs, in particular the\r\nDepartment for Youth, has developed a national\r\nstrategy for youth.\r\nEducation in Qatar is guaranteed to all students,\r\nand it is compulsory at the primary and secondary\r\nlevels. We are now focusing our efforts on providing\r\nhigh quality education at all stages, especially at the\r\nuniversity level. We have established an education city,\r\nwhere our major universities operate branches. We\r\nhave also focused our efforts on establishing scientific\r\nresearch centres. We have set up centres open to\r\nstudents at all levels, where students practice elections\r\nand learn about democracy. We have also integrated\r\ndisabled persons into teaching programmes.\r\nIn order to create employment opportunities,\r\nthere is coordination between the Government and the\r\nprivate sector to employ young people.\r\nGiven that the scourge of drugs is an international\r\nphenomenon, we have worked to protect young people\r\nfrom the dangers of drugs. We have also worked with\r\ninternational institutions to cooperate in this area. Our\r\nSupreme Council for Family Affairs is working with\r\nthe Centro Italiano di Solidaritá and with United\r\nNations bodies to create opportunities for young\r\npeople.\r\nThe efforts of the State of Qatar are not limited to\r\nits own young people. We have also worked with\r\ninternational organizations to help friendly and\r\nfraternal countries. That work includes a project under\r\nthe auspices of the spouse of His Highness Sheikh\r\nHamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani and in cooperation with\r\nUNESCO to assist Iraqi universities. Qatar has\r\nallocated $15 million for that purpose.\r\nOur universities are also open to all young people\r\nfrom around the world.\r\nWe must make every effort to ensure a prosperous\r\nfuture for young people everywhere. The United\r\nNations system should contribute advisory and training\r\nservices to improve the capacities of our young people.\r\nMr. Al-Ghannam (Saudi Arabia) (spoke in\r\nArabic): On behalf of the young people of the\r\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia, I would like to thank the\r\nSecretariat for organizing this international debate to\r\nassess the progress made in the implementation of the\r\nWorld Programme of Action for Youth and to provide\r\nan opportunity for young people to raise questions with\r\nregard to their prospects and aspirations, as well as to\r\ntake part in the search for solutions.\r\nAllow me to draw the Assemblys attention to a\r\nsignal and very positive pioneering experience of Saudi\r\nyoung people  who make up more than two thirds of\r\nSaudi society  that took place under the auspices of\r\nthe King Abdul Aziz Centre for National Dialogue.\r\nThat Centre works to foster a culture of dialogue\r\nin society that discusses issues of national interest at\r\nall levels and proposes recommendations for action.\r\n28\r\nA/60/PV.28\r\nThe Centre has made issues impacting young people a\r\nnational priority.\r\nA national meeting was held in Saudi Arabia\r\nunder the theme Questions of youth: realities and\r\naspirations. Twenty-six preparatory workshops were\r\nheld prior to the meeting, in which 650 young men and\r\nwomen participated, representing young people aged\r\n16 to 25 in groups of 25 men and 25 women from each\r\nprovince. The goals of the workshops were to promote\r\ndialogue among young people, identify and discuss\r\nissues and ideas specific to them and, lastly, to\r\nconsider proposals and work programmes to be\r\nsubmitted to decision-makers. Many people took part\r\nin those workshops, including scientists, intellectual\r\nand educated people of both genders and a great\r\nnumber of young men and women. Saudis participating\r\nin the workshops had an opportunity to ask many\r\nquestions and to discuss issues of interest, including\r\ncontinuation of constructive dialogue.\r\nIn conclusion, those efforts have begun to bear\r\nfruit. They represent an initiative that is led by Saudi\r\nArabias young people themselves. They are our hope\r\nand we rely heavily on them.\r\nMr. Treminio Rivera (Nicaragua) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): I would like to say that I share the pain of the\r\npeople and Government of El Salvador in connection\r\nwith the difficulties caused by the hurricane. I hope\r\nthat they will be able to overcome those problems.\r\nNicaragua is not only a country of lakes and\r\nvolcanoes; it is also a country full of young people.\r\nOver 70 per cent of the population of Nicaragua is\r\nunder the age of 30. The group of those aged 18 to 30\r\nnow represents 23 per cent of the population. However,\r\nby 2015 that group will double to make up 47 per cent\r\nof the population, and the group of those aged 0 to 15,\r\nwhich now makes up 46.5 per cent, will shrink by half.\r\nThat means that the Government of Nicaragua should\r\ninvest in young people today more than ever before.\r\nHowever, doing so would clearly not be just for the\r\nsake of providing replacements for the workforce. It\r\nwould also be to try to ensure that Nicaraguan young\r\npeople can become more independent, develop their\r\ncapacities and enjoy a higher level of participation in\r\nsociety.\r\nWhen we began to draft social policy for young\r\npeople in Nicaragua, we tried to ensure that we did so\r\nwhile making those policies part of other national\r\nsocial policies and, ultimately, overall State policy.\r\nAllow me to touch on the positive and negative\r\naspects of the situation of young people in Nicaragua\r\nin recent years. Young people in Nicaragua lived\r\nthrough a war in which more than 50,000 of them died.\r\nToday, as before, we continue to have many problems.\r\nThe very high rate of teen pregnancy has resulted\r\nin an equally high maternal mortality rate among\r\nyoung women. People of working age in the 25-to-49-\r\nyear age bracket have only 7.1 years of schooling on\r\naverage  that is to say, they do not even have the 12\r\nyears of schooling normally recommended by the\r\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization. Adolescents have on average 5.1 years of\r\nschooling. Thus, given the situation facing young\r\nNicaraguans, the Government of Nicaragua has over\r\nthe past three and half years developed a youth action\r\nprogramme aimed at addressing those problems. It is\r\nendeavouring to elaborate future policies to prevent\r\nand treat HIV/AIDS, and it will work with the Ministry\r\nof Health to see to it that people living with HIV/AIDS\r\nhave access to antiretroviral treatment. The Ministry of\r\nEducation also must undertake training and educational\r\nprojects aimed at limiting the pandemic.\r\nNext year we will be carrying out the first youth\r\nsurvey, which will give us an initial baseline as to the\r\nactual situation of youth and thereby help us adapt our\r\nintervention planning aimed at young people.\r\nAccess to information and telecommunications\r\ntechnologies is also a challenge for our Government.\r\nThat is why we have begun to develop neighbourhood\r\ntelecommunications centres, thereby narrowing the\r\ninformation gap between young people who have\r\naccess to such information and those who do not.\r\nNo less important are sex education programmes,\r\naimed at reducing the number of teen pregnancies and\r\nat bringing the Nicaraguan people, especially young\r\npeople, to a point where the demographic growth rate\r\nis lower than the rate of economic growth.\r\nClearly, however, none of the efforts being made\r\nby the Government of Nicaragua will come to fruition\r\nif we cannot resolve the structural problems facing our\r\ncountry and developing countries in particular. One\r\nimportant challenge is to reduce external debt with\r\nrespect to bilateral agencies and to certain countries.\r\nAnother important goal is to ensure sustainable\r\neconomic growth over the next 25 years at an annual\r\nrate of 7 per cent, which will enable us to implement\r\n29\r\nA/60/PV.28\r\nstate policies that will well and truly resolve the\r\nproblems facing Nicaraguas young people.\r\nI should like to join those who have expressed\r\ntheir congratulations to the Ibero-American Youth\r\nOrganization. Indeed, on 10 and 11 October, we will be\r\nsigning the Convention on the Rights of Young People\r\nin Latin America in Badajoz, Spain.\r\nI should like to conclude my statement with some\r\nthoughts that summarize what youth, and education for\r\nyouth, means to my Government:\r\nIf your projects are for one year, plant\r\nseeds. If they are for 10 years, plant a tree. If\r\nyour projects are for 100 years, then educate the\r\npeople. That is because if you plant seeds, you\r\nwill get one crop. If you plant a tree, you will get\r\n10. But if you educate the people, you will have\r\ncrops forever.\r\nThe Acting President: I should like to inform the\r\nAssembly that the representative of Haiti has asked to\r\nparticipate in this meeting. Inasmuch as the list of\r\nspeakers was closed at 11 a.m. today, may I ask the\r\nAssembly whether there is any objection to this\r\ninclusion of that delegation in the list of speakers.\r\nI see no objection.\r\nMs. Louis (Haiti) (spoke in French): When I\r\nlearned that I had been appointed by the Secretary of\r\nState for Youth to represent Haitian youth at the\r\nGeneral Assembly, I hesitated, because on the one hand\r\nI know how complex and multifaceted the needs of\r\nyouth are, and, on the other, I was unsure about the\r\nfollow-up to such an event. But, aware that this is an\r\nappropriate forum for voicing the claims of our young\r\npeople, we have come here in the hope that they will\r\nbe heard and taken into account.\r\nHaitian youth is living and developing in an\r\nenvironment of constant deterioration. It is deprived of\r\nall socio-economic and institutional opportunities, and\r\nit cannot flourish at the cultural level. Infrastructure for\r\neducation, health care, professional training, public\r\nhygiene and recreation is lacking, which hinders the\r\ndevelopment of the collective social conscience that is\r\nnecessary if we are to transform the existing socio-\r\neconomic structure into a modern and effective\r\nproduction mechanism.\r\nDespite our Governments efforts vis-à-vis\r\nHaitian youth, we have been unable to devise a policy\r\naimed at promoting the physical and intellectual\r\ndevelopment of young people  even less so with\r\nregard to socio-professional development, which could\r\npromote a transition to independence.\r\nTen years after the elaboration of the Programme\r\nof Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond, and\r\ndespite the many recommendations made for youth, the\r\nsituation of young Haitians has not improved. For\r\nseveral decades now, the number of young people in\r\nHaiti has been growing. Demographically speaking, it\r\nis clear that they now represent a significant percentage\r\nof our population. In 1997, those aged 15 to 24 years\r\nrepresented 30 per cent of the population. As the\r\ngrowth rate is nearly 2 per cent annually, just imagine\r\nwhat the employment situation is today.\r\nAccording to a 1995 United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme report, the unemployment\r\nrate was then at 65 per cent. The socio-political crisis,\r\nwhich grew worse in 2002, is affecting various sectors\r\nof the economy and is having a devastating impact on\r\nsocial indicators. We believe that unemployment will\r\ncontinue so long as the political crisis is not resolved\r\nand so long as there is not greater involvement on the\r\npart of young people in the context of a national youth\r\npolicy that takes account of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals and of the actual needs of youth.\r\nHIV/AIDS is one of the greatest challenges of the\r\ntwenty-first century. As in the rest of the world, it is\r\nhaving major repercussions for Haitian youth. The\r\nmost affected are young people aged 15 to 24, and\r\nthose figures are continuing to rise. The situation is\r\nhaving a negative impact on the development process\r\nin the country. Furthermore, young people who are\r\ntrying to protect themselves from possible HIV/AIDS\r\ninfection are having a difficult time getting access to\r\ninformation, counselling, screening and treatment.\r\nIn the light of those conditions, it is evident that\r\nthe limited labour market has no place for urban or\r\nrural youth. That largely explains the phenomenon of\r\nboat people prevalent among young people. Young\r\npeople are driven to migrate. They take to the seas on\r\nflimsy watercraft in search of new horizons. Among\r\nthem are young people from rural areas who do not\r\nhave access to education or plots of land and others\r\nwho had bad luck on their high school exams, along\r\nwith all other types of young people, coming from all\r\nover the country in search of better economic\r\nprospects. The great majority of those potential\r\n30\r\nA/60/PV.28\r\nimmigrants end up living in the shanty towns of Port-\r\nau-Prince, where they become involved in criminal\r\nactivity and are used to foment the climate of\r\ninsecurity that has existed in the country for several\r\nyears, since the departure of former President Aristide.\r\nWith regard to unemployment and the\r\nprecariousness of education and social life, Haitian\r\nyouth are now considering the best type of programme\r\nto adopt for our circumstances. One thing is certain:\r\nthe policies proposed for industrialized countries are\r\nnot applicable in our situation. We therefore propose\r\nthat the United Nations support our Government in the\r\nfollowing manner.\r\nStudies should be designed and carried out on the\r\nsocio-economic situation of young people in order to\r\ncreate programmes that take their real needs into\r\naccount. The international community should support\r\nthe Government of Haiti in implementing a programme\r\nfor the social, cultural and intellectual development of\r\nyoung people. A space should be created within the\r\nUnited Nations for youth representatives from various\r\ncountries to meet and discuss their problems and the\r\nsolutions. In Haiti, the Secretary of State for Youth\r\nshould be replaced with a Ministry for Youth in order\r\nto make actions for youth more effective. I hope those\r\nrecommendations will receive consideration.\r\nMr. Matlosa (Lesotho): I am honoured to have\r\nthis opportunity to address the Assembly.\r\nLesotho is one of the poorest nations in the world\r\nand has the third highest HIV/AIDS prevalence rate in\r\nthe world. The epidemics magnitude threatens the very\r\nexistence of our nation and makes the fight to carry out\r\nthe World Programme of Action for Youth all the more\r\ndifficult, if not outright impossible. Youth must wage\r\nwar against the epidemic, but that war will be unlike\r\nany other war that youth have fought before. The\r\nenemy has crept unnoticed into communities and\r\nhouseholds, and the silent killer is waging war from\r\nwithin.\r\nThrough the World Programme of Action for\r\nYouth, the United Nations must urgently elaborate a\r\nstrategy for its battle plan, seek the assistance of allies,\r\nrecruit, train and equip troops and allocate enough\r\nresources to engage and destroy the enemy. The United\r\nNations remains our strongest ally in this war. It should\r\nalso allocate more resources to that war and remain\r\ndetermined in helping youth emerge victorious.\r\nFrom my statement, it is clear that HIV/AIDS is\r\none of the biggest obstacles to achieving our goals in\r\nthe World Programme of Action for Youth, as well as\r\nthe overall development of the youth. While Lesotho\r\nhas made tremendous progress in its efforts to provide\r\nthe fundamental elements needed to improve\r\nlivelihoods, young people face considerable\r\ndevelopment challenges, primarily due to the\r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic. In a country with one of the\r\nhighest infection rates, now estimated at approximately\r\n30 per cent, the youth of Lesotho are facing an\r\nunprecedented challenge. The pandemic, combined\r\nwith deep-rooted poverty and food insecurity, is\r\ncausing a new kind of vulnerability, affecting almost\r\nevery young person in Lesotho. The consequence is a\r\ngradual undermining of the social and economic fabric\r\nthat makes up the society of Lesotho. The pandemic\r\nhas a great effect on youth, weakening family and\r\nsocial coping mechanisms.\r\nYouth are in crisis. That complex crisis can be\r\nseen in its negative impact on youth development, and\r\nin particular on the realization of the World Programme\r\nof Action for Youth. However, the socio-political\r\nclimate now prevailing in most developing countries\r\nprovides a real opportunity to effectively address youth\r\ndevelopment challenges such as the HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic, poverty and hunger, unemployment,\r\nglobalization and gender equality.\r\nFor us in the developing countries, the idea of\r\nachieving the goals of the World Programme of Action\r\nfor Youth is just a dream. Our dream can be made a\r\nreality through further support and investment from the\r\nUnited Nations and developed countries.\r\nToday, we young people live in a world that you\r\nadults and our forefathers have made. Tomorrow, you\r\nwill live in a world that we will make. When you make\r\ndecisions, think of the world in which you would like\r\nto live in the future. Our crisis can be turned into an\r\nopportunity. Young people, let us all rally to the battle\r\ncry and make a difference.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the observer\r\nof the Observer State of the Holy See.\r\nMr. Dionísio (Holy See): My delegation is\r\npleased to participate in this important discussion on\r\nthe World Programme of Action for Youth. It was once\r\nsaid, flippantly, that youth is wasted on the young.\r\nNevertheless, the Holy See is pleased that the United\r\n31\r\nA/60/PV.28\r\nNations continues to have high regard for the\r\nimportance of young people.\r\nRecently, at a gathering of hundreds of thousands\r\nof young people in Cologne, Germany, Pope Benedict\r\nXVI echoed the sentiments of young people around the\r\nworld when he said, We are concerned for the state of\r\nthe world and we are asking, where do I find standards\r\nto live by and what are the criteria that govern\r\nresponsible cooperation in building the present and the\r\nfuture of our world?\r\nYoung people aspire to be great. But to achieve\r\ngreatness, they must be mindful of others, especially\r\nthose in need. Nor can they achieve greatness alone.\r\nThey need the leadership and the resources of\r\nGovernments, the interest and the cooperation of non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and the goodwill and hard\r\nwork of all people.\r\nIn the light of that concern, my delegation has\r\ncarefully followed developments since the launch 10\r\nyears ago of the World Programme of Action for\r\nYouth. Its 10 priority areas for action touched upon\r\nsignificant issues and themes that affect the lives of\r\nyoung people and our world.\r\nThe Secretary-Generals World Youth Report\r\n2005 (A/60/61) returns to troubling elements that still\r\naffect young peoples lives today. Addressing one of\r\nthose concerns, my delegation reaffirms its position on\r\nthe use of the expression sexual and reproductive\r\nhealth, as contained in the report. My delegation\r\nunderstands the concept as the holistic promotion of\r\nthe health of women, men, youth and children. It does\r\nnot consider abortion or access to abortion to be a\r\ndimension of that term.\r\nThe Holy See also continues to be fully\r\ncommitted to the role of youth in the context of the\r\nglobal economy, poverty, education and employment.\r\nThere are currently more than 196,000 Catholic\r\nprimary and secondary schools worldwide, attended by\r\nmore than 51 million children and young people.\r\nFurthermore, there are almost 1,000 Catholic\r\nuniversities, colleges and other institutes, educating\r\nmore than 4 million young adults. Young people are\r\nbeing helped to receive the education they deserve and\r\nare encouraged to give back to others. Education is the\r\ngift that continues to give.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nWith respect to youth in relation to society, the\r\nenvironment, leisure and participation, the Catholic\r\nChurch, through the activities of thousands of youth\r\ngroups throughout the world, promotes the importance\r\nof caring for oneself, for the environment and for ones\r\npeers.\r\nAlmost 12,000 Catholic hospitals and other\r\nhealth-care and preventive medicine institutions\r\nthroughout the world are working to address problems\r\nrelated to youth at risk, including health issues, drugs,\r\ndelinquency and discrimination against girls and young\r\nwomen. Trained local professionals working in such\r\ninstitutions support the principle that all human life is\r\nsacred, and that each person has worth. The young are\r\ncared for as precious and vulnerable members of\r\nsociety.\r\nThe ability to accomplish specific goals in the 10\r\npriority areas comes down to commitment. The round-\r\ntable discussions on young people called it making\r\ncommitments that matter. We know that we live in a\r\ncomplex and complicated world, and many young\r\npeople know that such a commitment requires three\r\nthings: recognizing needs, especially in the poorest\r\ncountries of our world; planning a response; and\r\nfollowing through.\r\nThe Holy See encourages the United Nations to\r\ncontinue to identify the needs of the worlds young\r\npeople, especially the poorest and weakest of them. It\r\nfurther recommits itself to working together with the\r\ninternational community to develop realistic,\r\nappropriate, immediate and long-term responses.\r\nBuilding a better world is a lifelong process.\r\nOftentimes, it is a very long journey. But young people\r\nrecognize that their journey is just beginning. And,\r\nprecisely because they are young, they are still at the\r\ninitial stages of paving a path for success in the future.\r\nEvery person of every age matters as we work\r\ntogether to build a world in which young people can\r\nfeel safe and happy.\r\nThe President: In accordance with General\r\nAssembly resolution 3369 (XXX) of 10 October 1975,\r\nI call on the observer for the Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference.\r\nMr. Husain (Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference): It is a privilege for me to address the\r\nGeneral Assembly on the occasion of its review of the\r\nprogress made in the implementation of the World\r\n32\r\nA/60/PV.28\r\nProgramme of Action for Youth, which the Assembly\r\nadopted 10 years ago.\r\nThe Organization of the Islamic Conference\r\n(OIC) expresses its full support for the initiatives being\r\nundertaken by Governments and intergovernmental and\r\nnon-governmental organizations worldwide for the\r\nobservance of the tenth anniversary of the adoption of\r\nthe World Programme of Action for Youth. In doing so,\r\nwe recall with pride and pleasure the role and active\r\nparticipation of OIC member States in the drafting and\r\nadoption of the Programme of Action and in its\r\nimplementation at the national, regional and global\r\nlevels.\r\nThe results of those planned endeavours are now\r\nbefore us, meticulously detailed in the Secretary-\r\nGenerals report (A/60/61) and described in our debate\r\nby speakers from all over the world, including from\r\nOIC member States.\r\nWhat is emerging from this invaluable\r\ninterchange of ideas and experiences is the fact that,\r\nwhile advances have been made to varying degrees in\r\nthe 10 priority areas on which the Programme of\r\nAction focuses, the expectations raised in 1995 have\r\nnot been met. In 2005, over 200 million young people\r\nare living in poverty; 130 million are illiterate; 88\r\nmillion are unemployed; and  something that was\r\nnot, perhaps, fully foreseen 10 years ago  10 million\r\nyoung people are now living with HIV/AIDS.\r\nWe have no option but to share the Secretary-\r\nGenerals view that, given such stark and startling\r\nrealities, the case for renewing our commitment to the\r\ngoals of the World Programme of Action could not be\r\nclearer. In fact, there is a stronger case now for\r\naugmenting the 10 priority issues of 1995 by another\r\nfive, as identified in the World Youth Report 2003\r\n(E/CN.5/2003/4), and subsequently noted by the\r\nAssembly in resolution 58/133.\r\nWe would like to take this opportunity to bring to\r\nthe Assemblys attention some of the developments\r\nthat are under way in the OIC in support of the\r\ninterests of youth. First, the Islamic Conference Youth\r\nForum for Dialogue and Cooperation has been\r\nestablished. The Forum, whose headquarters are in\r\nIstanbul, will, among other things, become a credible\r\nsource of information and advice on national youth\r\npolicy issues, coordinate the activities of national\r\nyouth organizations in OIC member States and Muslim\r\ncommunities in non-member States, and assist with\r\ncapacity-building measures, including the training of\r\nyouth leaders in advocacy and organizational roles.\r\nThose two examples should give representatives a\r\nsense of the OICs commitment to the welfare and\r\ndevelopment of youth. Those commitments do not\r\nexist in isolation, but reflect the emphasis placed by\r\nour organization on the promotion of Islamic family\r\nvalues and, in that context, on efforts to address the\r\nneeds of the various elements of the family, including\r\nmen, women, children and youth.\r\nIn conclusion, we believe that, with renewed\r\nstrength, the family  the basic social unit of\r\nsociety  should provide the tools for the development\r\nof a morally upright and economically stable, healthy\r\nand viable society. It should also create an environment\r\nfor harmonious and productive lives to be lived by all\r\nmembers of the human family, including youth, on\r\nwhose shoulders will fall the responsibility of creating\r\nthe global village, which is our destination in the new\r\nmillennium, which we recently entered.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nthe debate at this meeting devoted to the evaluation of\r\nthe progress made in the implementation of the World\r\nProgramme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and\r\nBeyond.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft\r\nresolution A/60/L.2, entitled Policies and programmes\r\ninvolving youth, as orally revised.\r\nThe list of additional sponsors  like the original\r\nlist of sponsors  is impressive. The following\r\ncountries have added their names to the list of sponsors\r\nof draft resolution A/60/L.2: Algeria, Botswana,\r\nBurkina Faso, Cape Verde, China, the Congo, Djibouti,\r\nFiji, Gabon, Israel, Jamaica, Malawi, Panama, Papua\r\nNew Guinea, Sierra Leone, Ukraine and the United\r\nRepublic of Tanzania.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/60/L.2, as orally revised?\r\nDraft resolution A/60/L.2, as orally revised, was\r\nadopted (resolution 60/2).\r\nThe President: Before giving the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,\r\nwho wishes to speak in explanation of position on the\r\nresolution just adopted, may I remind delegations that\r\nexplanations of vote or position are limited to 10\r\n33\r\nA/60/PV.28\r\nminutes and should be made by delegations from their\r\nseats.\r\nMs. García-Matos (Bolivarian Republic of\r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): The Bolivarian\r\nRepublic of Venezuela wishes to express its strong\r\nreservation with regard to paragraph 7 of draft\r\nresolution A/60/L.2. We totally disagree with the\r\ncontents of that paragraph, which mentions the\r\noutcome document (resolution 60/1) of the High-level\r\nPlenary Meeting of the sixtieth session of the General\r\nAssembly. We consider that document to be null and\r\nvoid and as having no effect for the Republic.\r\nThe President: We have heard the only speaker\r\nin explanation of position.\r\nI shall now call on those representatives who\r\nwish to speak in exercise of the right of reply. May I\r\nremind members that statements in exercise of the right\r\nof reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first\r\nintervention and to five minutes for the second and\r\nshould be made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMs. Shestack (United States of America): The\r\nUnited States is exercising its right of reply in response\r\nto the statement made this morning by the\r\nrepresentative of Cuba.\r\nThe United States trade embargo against Cuba is\r\na bilateral issue that should not come before the\r\nGeneral Assembly. In bringing attention to that issue,\r\nCuba is simply attempting to blame the communist\r\nregimes failed economic policies on the United States\r\nand to divert attention from its human rights record.\r\nLet us remember that the United States is the\r\nsingle largest source of humanitarian assistance to\r\nCuba. Let there be no doubt: if Cubans are jobless or\r\nhungry, it is because of the failings of the current\r\nGovernment. That Government has shown no interest\r\nwhatsoever in implementing any economic or political\r\nreform that would lead to democratic change and a\r\nfree-market economy. That kind of economic\r\nmismanagement is the reason why a country that 45\r\nyears ago had a per capita income equal to that of\r\nSpain is now one of Latin Americas most\r\neconomically desperate.\r\nThe Cuban Government is not a victim, as it\r\ncontends. Rather, it is a tyrant aggressively punishing\r\nanyone who dares to have a differing opinion. Castro\r\nhas steadfastly refused to allow any kind of political\r\nopening, and he continues to deny Cubans human\r\nrights and fundamental freedoms as set forth in the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. We, for one,\r\ncannot support an economic opening with a country\r\nwith such an abysmal record on economic and political\r\nissues.\r\nMs. Thomas (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): Cuba is\r\nnot trying to blame the United States. Actually, the\r\nUnited States is only blaming itself; it does not need\r\nour help. It is blaming itself by not complying with the\r\nresolutions adopted by the General Assembly over the\r\npast 13 years calling for a lifting of the blockade. It is\r\nblaming itself when it adopts extraterritorial laws\r\nagainst Cuba hardening the blockade even more and\r\nwhen it applies them so brutally.\r\nThe prosperous Cuba of before 1 January 1959\r\nthat the representative of the United States is talking\r\nabout was a Cuba of 2 million illiterate people \r\n40 per cent of the population. It was a Cuba of half a\r\nmillion unschooled children, 10,000 unemployed\r\nschoolteachers and a jobless rate of 24 per cent, with\r\nyoung people the majority of the unemployed. It was a\r\nCuba of drunken American marines on the streets of\r\nHavana, defiling our national monuments, and of\r\nFulgencio Batista, killing and torturing students with\r\nthe tacit complicity of American leaders.\r\nThe United States delegation is trying to convince\r\nthose in this Hall that the blockade is nothing more\r\nthan a Cuban excuse for our problems. It is trying to be\r\nmy countrys judge and prosecutor, using the argument\r\nthat we supposedly lack democracy and violate human\r\nrights. Not only does it ignore Cubas globally\r\nrecognized progress in the social arena and in caring\r\nfor young people and children, but it is lying once\r\nagain to the members of the Assembly when it tries to\r\npresent the economic, commercial and financial\r\nblockade against Cuba as a bilateral issue.\r\nOnly a racist, fascist, arrogant, haughty and,\r\nindeed, disturbed mentality such as that of the current\r\nPresident of the United States, Mr. Bush, could\r\nmaintain the criminal blockade against Cuba. In\r\npractice, the blockade policy amounts to an actual\r\neconomic war waged by the United States against my\r\ncountry for more than 40 years without any limits,\r\nwhether ethical, moral or related to State obligations\r\nunder international law governed by the United\r\nNations.\r\nNever has a country been subjected so\r\ncontinuously to the danger represented by such a\r\n34\r\nA/60/PV.28\r\npowerful neighbour, which, historically, has tried to\r\ndominate and annex us for more than two centuries.\r\nThe United States has run out of pretexts for explaining\r\nthe maintenance of the criminal blockade and other\r\nanti-Cuban measures. That is why it clings to the issue\r\nof our supposed violations of human rights. That is the\r\nfig leaf with which it covers itself.\r\nThe world knows that for the past 46 years, Cuba\r\nhas been a thorn in the side of the worlds only super-\r\nPower, the United States. When it becomes irritated, it\r\nsets in motion a campaign of disinformation, blackmail\r\nand pressure. However, the thorn  personified in\r\nFidel Castro  remains intact and is increasingly\r\nrobust.\r\nEveryone here is aware that what the United\r\nStates delegation is trying to do on behalf of its\r\nGovernment is to stigmatize Cuba for our unyielding\r\nrebellion against the unjust imperialist world order; for\r\nour staunch defence of our independence and\r\nsovereignty; for our decision to make our own way\r\nwithout accepting external interference; for the\r\nexample set by our truly participatory and popular\r\ndemocracy; for the example set by our achievements,\r\nincluding our education and health rates, our full\r\nemployment and our social justice for all, despite the\r\ncruel and prolonged blockade that our people have had\r\nfor so long to endure; and for the example we set by\r\nproviding solidarity and sharing what we have with\r\nthose who have nothing in this world.\r\nThe Government of United States has not the\r\nslightest moral qualification to speak about Cuba or\r\nany other country represented in this Hall. The\r\nGovernment that is accusing Cuba today is the one that\r\nhas sent thousands of its young people to die in wars\r\nlaunched under lying pretexts now internationally\r\nrecognized as such. It is the Government that\r\ndirected  indeed, participated in  the bombing of\r\ncities. The Government that is accusing Cuba today is\r\nthe one that was unable to take measures in time to\r\nprevent the disaster caused in New Orleans by\r\nHurricane Katrina.\r\nIn Cuba, we learned long ago to raise dignity as\r\nhigh as palm trees, and there will be no turning back.\r\nCuba will not rest in its struggle, will not surrender,\r\nwill never make concessions, will never fail to speak\r\nup. We will always stand alongside those who are not\r\nresigned, those who put their faith in the value of ideas\r\nand principles, those who do not give up the dream of\r\nachieving full justice for all in a better world.\r\nThe President: I should now like to say a few\r\nfinal words as President of the General Assembly.\r\nYesterday and today have been marked by a\r\nstrong presence of both the present and the future in\r\nthis Hall. I refer not only to those who are here\r\nrepresenting youth organizations in their own\r\ncountries, and, of course, to the representatives of\r\nGovernments. In that regard, I particularly commend\r\nthe delegation of Togo for its most faithful\r\nparticipation in the discussions. It is welcome to see so\r\nmany participants still here at almost 7 p.m. That is a\r\ngood sign, and I am grateful.\r\nParticipants have also brought to the United\r\nNations the presence and situation of young people\r\nthroughout the world, who are so vulnerable in\r\nconflicts, who are vulnerable to disease and who are\r\nexposed to poverty, at a time when so many moral\r\nexcesses are making children victims, for example as\r\nchild soldiers. We also face the trafficking of human\r\nbeings, which is, as we know, a modern form of\r\nslavery.\r\nWe have brought into these rooms not only young\r\npeople representing youth but also the realities of the\r\nsituation of many young people in the world. This is\r\nimportant and indeed very rejuvenating for this\r\nOrganization at a time of reform and looking to the\r\nfuture.\r\nWe need to strengthen multilateralism; we need to\r\nstrengthen international cooperation; we need to\r\nstrengthen international solidarity. Young people have\r\na very important role to play in this regard. I hope that\r\nthey will take back to their countries a message of\r\ninternational cooperation, a message of strengthening\r\nthis Organization and a message of international\r\nsolidarity. I also hope that they have created networks\r\namong themselves. Relations among human beings are\r\nextremely important, even in diplomacy. And I hope\r\nthat this network will bring our young participants\r\ntogether even after they leave these halls.\r\nWith these words, I thank all participants for\r\nmaking this a very special two-day part of the General\r\nAssembly at the beginning of my presidency. I wish\r\nthem a good return to their countries, countries that\r\nthey have represented so well, and the best of luck for\r\nthe future.\r\n35\r\nA/60/PV.28\r\nThe General Assembly has thus concluded its\r\nmeetings devoted to evaluation of the progress made in\r\nthe implementation of the World Programme of Action\r\nfor Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond and this stage\r\nof its consideration of agenda item 62.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President: I should like to inform members\r\nthat document A/INF/60/3/Rev.1, containing a revised\r\nprogramme of work and schedule of plenary meetings\r\nfor the months of October, November and December,\r\nwas issued this morning. May I remind members that\r\nthe lists of speakers for items listed in document\r\nA/INF/60/3/Rev.1 are open.\r\nIn addition, I wish to announce the following\r\nactivities. The 2005 United Nations Pledging\r\nConference for Development Activities and the\r\nPledging Conference for the World Food Programme\r\nwill be held on Friday morning, 11 November. The\r\nannouncement of voluntary contributions to the 2005\r\nprogrammes of the United Nations Relief and Works\r\nAgency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East will\r\ntake place on Monday morning, 5 December. Members\r\nare requested to consult the Journal for further details\r\nconcerning those activities.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.55 p.m.\r\n"
