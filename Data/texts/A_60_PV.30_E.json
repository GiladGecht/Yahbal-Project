(Sweden)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.15 p.m.\r\nAgenda items 76 and 77\r\nReport of the International Criminal Tribunal for the\r\nProsecution of Persons Responsible for Genocide and\r\nOther Serious Violations of International\r\nHumanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of\r\nRwanda and Rwandan Citizens Responsible for\r\nGenocide and Other Such Violations Committed in\r\nthe Territory of Neighbouring States between\r\n1 January and 31 December 1994\r\nNote by the Secretary-General transmitting the\r\ntenth annual report of the International\r\nCriminal Tribunal (A/60/229)\r\nReport of the International Tribunal for the\r\nProsecution of Persons Responsible for Serious\r\nViolations of International Humanitarian Law\r\nCommitted in the Territory of the Former\r\nYugoslavia since 1991\r\nNote by the Secretary-General transmitting\r\nthe twelfth annual report of the International\r\nTribunal (A/60/267)\r\nThe President: May I take it that the Assembly\r\ntakes note of the tenth annual report of the\r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: May I take it that the Assembly\r\ntakes note of the twelfth annual report of the\r\nInternational Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I now call on Mr. Erik Møse,\r\nPresident of the International Criminal Tribunal for\r\nRwanda.\r\nMr. Møse: It is a great honour to address the\r\nmembers of the General Assembly in order to present\r\nthe tenth annual report of the International Criminal\r\nTribunal for Rwanda (ICTR).\r\nThe work of the ICTR is progressing well.\r\nDuring the period under review, the Trial Chambers\r\nhave rendered three further trial judgements. This\r\nbrings the total number of persons convicted or\r\nacquitted by the ICTR since its first trials started in\r\n1997 to 25 persons. Another judgement is expected\r\nsoon.\r\nDuring the reporting period, the ICTR\r\ncommenced five new trials involving seven accused.\r\nAdditionally, I am pleased to inform the Assembly that\r\na further two new trials have started since the annual\r\nreport was submitted. Therefore, 10 trials are now in\r\nprogress which involve 26 additional accused. To date,\r\njudgement has therefore been rendered, or trials are\r\nongoing, in respect of a total of 52 alleged leaders\r\nduring the events of 1994.\r\nThe ICTR Appeals Chamber also has a very\r\nheavy workload. During the reporting period, it\r\n2\r\nA/60/PV.30\r\ndelivered four appeal judgements in respect of five\r\npersons.\r\nLet me briefly recall the three Trial Chamber\r\njudgements rendered during the period under review.\r\nOn 15 July 2004, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, a\r\nformer Minister of Finance, was convicted of genocide\r\nand crimes against humanity and sentenced to\r\nimprisonment for the remainder of his life. That trial\r\nlasted for only 29 trial days, and judgement was\r\nrendered 10 and a half months after its start.\r\nMikaeli Muhimana, a conseiller, was also\r\nconvicted of genocide and crimes against humanity and\r\nsentenced to life imprisonment on 28 April 2005 after\r\n34 trial days.\r\nFinally, Vincent Rutaganira, also a conseiller,\r\nwas sentenced to six years imprisonment on 14 March\r\n2005 for extermination as a crime against humanity. He\r\nwas the fourth to plead guilty at the ICTR.\r\nI will now comment on our trials in progress. As\r\nmembers of the Assembly are aware, our five multi-\r\naccused trials represent our main challenge because of\r\ntheir volume, complexity and the time needed to\r\ncomplete them. It is therefore important to note that\r\nthree of them are at an advanced stage. There has been\r\nconsiderable progress during the presentation of the\r\ndefence cases in the Butare trial and the Military I\r\ncase. In the Government trial, involving four\r\nGovernment ministers, the prosecution closed its case\r\nin June 2005. The defence case is due to commence on\r\n1 November 2005. The progress made in these three\r\nmulti-accused trials represents significant steps in the\r\nimplementation of the ICTR Completion Strategy.\r\nIn the other two multi-accused trials, the\r\nprosecution is presenting its evidence. In the Military\r\nII case, I am now pleased to report that over half of the\r\nprosecution witnesses have been heard. Another\r\nwelcome development is that the problems in the\r\nKaremera et al. case have been resolved. You will\r\nrecall that the Appeals Chamber decided that this trial,\r\nwhich originally included four accused, should start de\r\nnovo. The trial of one of them, Mr. Rwamakuba,\r\nrecommenced on 9 June 2005, and the prosecution\r\nclosed its case in early September. The defence case\r\nwill start in a few weeks. The trial of the other three\r\naccused recommenced in September of this year.\r\nThere have also been developments in the single-\r\naccused cases. As mentioned in our annual report, the\r\nprosecution closed its case in Seromba in January\r\n2005, following the testimony of 15 witnesses in the\r\ncourse of 25 trial days. Change of defence counsel has\r\ndelayed the commencement of the defence case, which\r\nwill start by the end of October of this year. In the trial\r\nof Muvunyi, the defence case starts in November 2005.\r\nAs mentioned, we began two new single-accused\r\ncases after the submission of the annual report. The\r\nMpambara trial started on 19 September. The\r\nprosecution has already closed its case in under two\r\nweeks, pending cross-examination of one prosecution\r\nwitness. The Chamber heard 10 prosecution witnesses,\r\nmaking it the shortest prosecution case in the history of\r\nthe Tribunal. The defence case will began in January\r\n2006. And last Monday, 3 October 2005, the\r\nZigiranyirazo trial started.\r\nThese developments confirm the Tribunals\r\ncapacity to complete single-accused cases within a\r\nlimited number of trial days. It also illustrates the high\r\nlevel of judicial activity in Arusha. This week, between\r\n14 and 18 accused are being transported to and from\r\nthe courtroom, depending on the daily schedule. All\r\ncourtrooms are being used to maximum capacity by the\r\n18 trial judges. Sixteen indictees are awaiting trial in\r\nour detention centre; their cases will commence as\r\nsoon as trial capacity allows.\r\nIn order to ensure maximum judicial output, there\r\nis a need to strike the right balance between the multi-\r\naccused and single-accused trials. Limited courtroom\r\nspace makes this task difficult and requires careful\r\nlong-term planning. Single-accused trials are normally\r\nslotted in when there are breaks in the voluminous\r\ntrials  so-called twin-tracking  or else they are\r\nheard in morning and afternoon shifts simultaneously\r\nwith other trials.\r\nThe ICTRs fourth courtroom must be seen in this\r\nperspective. It was constructed within a month and was\r\nin use on 1 March 2005, the day of its inauguration.\r\nThis additional courtroom, financed through voluntary\r\ncontributions, has facilitated the steady progress of our\r\ncases and is an important element of our Completion\r\nStrategy.\r\nIn our Completion Strategy, we have estimated\r\nthat, on the basis of the information presently\r\navailable, the Tribunal will have completed cases\r\ninvolving 65 to 70 persons by 2008. On the basis of\r\nthose projections, I am pleased to confirm that the\r\n3\r\nA/60/PV.30\r\nICTR is on track to complete our trials by the deadline\r\nset by the Security Council in resolution 1503 (2003).\r\nThe Prosecutor continues to concentrate on those\r\npersons alleged to have been in positions of leadership\r\nand who bear the gravest responsibility for the crimes\r\ncommitted. The Investigations Division completed\r\ninvestigations on new targets within the deadline of\r\n31 December 2004. Of the 16 suspects that were being\r\ninvestigated, the Prosecutor decided to indict eight.\r\nSince the submission of the annual report, Chambers\r\nhave confirmed all eight indictments. This brings the\r\ntotal number of genocide indictees presently at large to\r\n20.\r\nOn 23 February 2005, the Prosecutor handed over\r\nthe dossiers of 15 suspects to the Rwandan authorities.\r\nOn 26 July 2005, the case files of a further 10\r\nindividuals who have likewise not been indicted by the\r\nICTR were delivered to Rwandan authorities. The\r\nProsecutor also intends to transfer some ICTR\r\nindictees to national jurisdictions for trial. The decision\r\nto transfer cases to national jurisdictions will be taken\r\nby the Trial Chambers on a case-by-case basis, once\r\nrequests for transfer are received from the prosecution.\r\nThe Prosecution has entered negotiations with certain\r\nStates to ensure national prosecution of some ICTR\r\nindictees. One country has already agreed to prosecute\r\na suspect and efforts are continuing to get other\r\ncountries to follow suit. Member States will contribute\r\nto the implementation of our Completion Strategy by\r\naccepting transfers of ICTR cases for trial.\r\nThe Prosecution has stepped up its tracking\r\nactivities and has visited a number of African countries\r\nwhere some fugitives are suspected of residing. The\r\nProsecutor has strongly encouraged national authorities\r\nto provide more significant cooperation in the tracking\r\nand arrest of those persons. Member States are\r\nrequested to assist with the apprehension of fugitives.\r\nLast year, I described the problems caused by the\r\nrecruitment freeze, which came about because some\r\nMember States had not paid their contributions to the\r\nICTR. It is essential to avoid a new freeze. In order to\r\nrespect the time frames laid down by the Security\r\nCouncil, the Tribunals must continue to receive the\r\nnecessary resources.\r\nThe Registry continues to support the judicial\r\nprocess by servicing the other branches of the Tribunal.\r\nHere I have to refer to the annual report for details, and\r\nlet me simply stress the important work by all sections,\r\nincluding the Court Management Section, the Witness\r\nSection, the Language Services Section, and the\r\nDefence Counsel Section. In this connection, let me\r\nemphasize that the important work of the defence\r\nteams is highly appreciated.\r\nThe Outreach Programme continues to be a\r\npriority, with the Information Centre in Kigali being its\r\nfocal point. The annual report describes this work. Let\r\nme reiterate that a prioritized activity is also to receive\r\nRwandans at the Tribunal. Recently, prominent\r\nRwandan judges visited Arusha, and groups of\r\nuniversity students arrive frequently. The Tribunal\r\ncontinues to appreciate the cooperation of the Rwandan\r\nauthorities. There is a steady flow of witnesses from\r\nKigali and Arusha. It is essential that both the\r\nProsecution and the Defence receive the necessary\r\nassistance in terms of witnesses and documents.\r\nLet me add that any allegations concerning\r\nintimidation of prosecution or defence witnesses are\r\ntaken very seriously by the Tribunal and are\r\ninvestigated in order to get to the truth of the matter.\r\nOn behalf of the Tribunal, let me conclude by\r\nexpressing our deep appreciation to the General\r\nAssembly and the Secretary-General for their\r\ncontinued support of the ICTR.\r\nThe President: I now call on Mr. Theodor\r\nMeron, President of the International Tribunal for the\r\nFormer Yugoslavia, to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Meron: I am sincerely honoured to address\r\nthis Assembly again. Today, it is with great pleasure\r\nthat I present the twelfth annual report of the\r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former\r\nYugoslavia (ICTY). Before I do so, I wish to thank the\r\nMember States of the United Nations for the critical\r\nsupport they have long afforded the Tribunal. Such\r\nsteadfast support has allowed the historic vision of our\r\nTribunal to become a tangible and compelling force in\r\nthe quest for peace, justice and reconciliation in the\r\nregion of the former Yugoslavia.\r\nSince I last reported to the Assembly one year\r\nago, we have continued to work vigorously towards\r\naccomplishing our vital mission. I am pleased to report\r\nin this regard that we remain diligent in our vigorous\r\npursuit of our mission and continue to make\r\nnoteworthy strides despite significant difficulties. This\r\nyear, the Trial Chambers and the Appeals Chamber\r\nhave heard and disposed of a record number of cases.\r\n4\r\nA/60/PV.30\r\nDuring the reporting period, the Tribunals Trial\r\nChambers, which continue to work at full capacity,\r\nhave been involved in 37 cases. The Appeals Chamber\r\ndecided five appeals from judgement, as well as 23\r\ninterlocutory appeals. Notably, four cases have also\r\nbeen referred to national jurisdictions, and three of\r\nthose decisions are now under appeal.\r\nNonetheless, we are not content to rest on our\r\nlaurels. We continue to look to new and creative\r\nmethods that might increase the efficiency of our\r\nproceedings and reduce the costs of our operations\r\nwithout sacrificing the quality of our work. Indeed, the\r\nyear under review provided several important internal\r\nreforms to ensure compliance with Security Council\r\nresolutions 1503 (2003) and 1534 (2004), which\r\ntogether outline the Tribunals Completion Strategy.\r\nIn my last assessment to the Security Council\r\ncovering the period from May to June 2005, I\r\nestimated that by 2009 the Tribunal could complete the\r\ntrials of all accused in our custody at that time. I also\r\nwarned that further growth of the trial docket would\r\nmake achieving that ambitious target entirely\r\ndependent on at least some cases being disposed of by\r\nguilty pleas.\r\nWe have implemented a number of changes to\r\nensure that we continue to proceed at maximum\r\ncapacity. Of particular salience, several procedural\r\nrules have been amended, markedly expediting our\r\nprocedures without sacrificing the defendants due\r\nprocess rights.\r\nIn the face of an increase in new indictments, the\r\narrival of new indictees and fugitives and only one new\r\nguilty plea, we have re-doubled our efforts, not only to\r\nproceed with speed and deliberation, but also to see\r\nthat justice is done for both victims and accused alike,\r\nthat due process is honoured and that accused are\r\nafforded fair trials consonant with the highest standards\r\nof international justice.\r\nRight now, three novel multiple defendant trials\r\nare at the pre-trial stage at the Tribunal. By prosecuting\r\nseveral cases determined by the Tribunal to be based\r\non the same factual scenarios under the same umbrella\r\nof a larger, single prosecution, multiple defendant trials\r\nare designed to increase the efficiency of the Tribunal\r\nwhile maintaining judicial fairness to the accused.\r\nJoinder has already been granted by a Trial Chamber in\r\nthe first of these landmark cases, allowing eight\r\nSrebrenica defendants from six different cases to be\r\nprosecuted under the purview of one bench; this would\r\nbe nine if fugitive Tolimir is apprehended. The other\r\ntwo multiple defendant trials on the Tribunals docket\r\ninvolve six and seven defendants, respectively; this\r\nwould be eight if fugitive Djordjević is apprehended.\r\nWe have also scrutinized our practices and\r\nprocedures in search of ways to ensure that the\r\nTribunal fulfils its mandate. In this regard, I am\r\npleased to report to you today that all sections of the\r\nTribunal are coordinating their efforts to increase\r\nefficiency and to ensure that the Tribunals resources\r\nare focused on the prosecution of the most senior\r\nofficials accused of the most serious crimes.\r\nI have also established two judicial Working\r\nGroups, one to examine ways of speeding up trials and\r\nanother to examine how to speed up appeals. The\r\nworking group on trials, chaired by Judge Bonomy, has\r\nbeen considering proposals to streamline pre-trial and\r\ntrial procedures and to procure additional courtroom\r\nspace. The working group on appeals, currently chaired\r\nby Judge Mumba, has been examining rules governing\r\nthe admissibility of additional evidence at the appellate\r\nstage and is exploring various time-saving procedures\r\nfor translating decisions and judgements for appellants.\r\nThe appeals working group presented a number of\r\nproposals to the plenary of judges, following which\r\nrecommendations have been made to the Rules\r\nCommittee. The Rule amendments propose reducing\r\nbriefing times for sentencing appeals, separating\r\nadditional evidence motions from the filing of the\r\nmerit appeals to avoid successive additional evidence\r\nmotions and increasing the power of the pre-appeal\r\njudge to dispose of routine motions without hearing the\r\nopposing party, unless prejudiced by the motion.\r\nThis year, we have also improved communication\r\nbetween the Association of Defence Counsel and the\r\nTribunal in an effort to boost efficiency in proceedings.\r\nIn addition, a pilot electronic Court (e-Court) system\r\nwas introduced in February. This system, which\r\nintegrates all case-related documents into a central\r\nelectronic database, will increase the accessibility of\r\ninformation while expediting proceedings. In another\r\npositive development, this year witnessed the adoption\r\nof Security Council resolution 1597 (2005), which\r\nallows for the re-nomination and the re-election of\r\nformer and present ad litem Judges, thus enhancing\r\ncontinuity and expertise. On 24 August 2005, elections\r\nwere held, and we now have an elected pool of 27\r\nexperienced jurists who are willing to serve the\r\n5\r\nA/60/PV.30\r\nTribunal as ad litem Judges. We are beginning to draw\r\nthe first ad litem Judges to complete our benches, as\r\nnecessary.\r\nIn addition to carrying out our own reforms, we\r\nhave strongly supported rule of law reforms in the\r\nformer Yugoslav republics that strengthen their ability\r\nto bring to justice perpetrators of crimes within the\r\nICTYs jurisdiction.\r\nOn this front, I am pleased to report that the State\r\nCourt of Bosnia and Herzegovina opened its War\r\nCrimes Chamber on 9 March 2005. That is truly a\r\nhistoric accomplishment for the people of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina and for the international community as a\r\nwhole. It was achieved through the coordinated efforts\r\nof the Government and the people of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, the High Representative for Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, the Tribunal, donor Governments and the\r\ninternational community. Despite serious difficulties,\r\nthose extraordinary efforts saw the War Crimes\r\nChamber up and running in a remarkably short period\r\nof time.\r\nAs part of its Completion Strategy, the Tribunal\r\nhas begun referring cases involving intermediate- and\r\nlower-ranking accused to that Chamber. Thus far, the\r\nProsecutor has filed 12 referral motions involving 20\r\naccused. To date, six of those motions have been heard\r\nand one has been withdrawn. The Referral Bench has\r\ngranted five motions: four for transfer to Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovinas War Crimes Chamber and one for\r\ntransfer to the Republic of Croatia. One motion has\r\nbeen denied. Four of the decisions transferring cases\r\nhave been appealed, and the Appeals Chamber has\r\naffirmed one of the transfers.\r\nThe Tribunal continues to lay further legal and\r\nlogistical groundwork for the transfer of lower- and\r\nintermediate-level prosecutions to national\r\njurisdictions. We have supported initiatives to build\r\nlocal capacity through the training of judges and\r\nprosecutors in Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro, and\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina. Partly as a result, local\r\nprofessionalism and local capacity to handle such\r\ncomplex cases is steadily increasing. The Tribunal has\r\nalso distributed key materials translated into the main\r\nlanguages of the region, and it continues to develop\r\nclose relations with legal professionals, the non-\r\ngovernmental organization community, local media and\r\nGovernments.\r\nCrucially, in the past year the ICTY has\r\naugmented its efforts to persuade the States of the\r\nformer Yugoslavia to actively search for and arrest\r\nindicted individuals who remain at large. During the\r\nreporting period, 24 accused were transferred or\r\nsurrendered to The Hague. That leaves us with only\r\nseven fugitives who have yet to be apprehended,\r\nalthough we remain gravely concerned that included\r\namong those seven are three of the most important\r\nindictees: Radovan Karadić, Ratko Mladić and Ante\r\nGotovina.\r\nWe ask for the full cooperation of all Member\r\nStates as we seek to bring to justice the perpetrators of\r\nthe atrocities that scarred the Balkans in the 1990s,\r\ndevastating hundreds of thousands of lives. The nations\r\nrepresented here today must recognize the risks posed\r\nto international justice if those fugitives escape the\r\nreach of the Tribunal. It is plain: a dark shadow will be\r\ncast over the Tribunals historic accomplishments if\r\nsenior-level accused are not brought to justice at The\r\nHague. We must work together to guard against that\r\nthreat to the legacy of the Tribunal and to international\r\njustice.\r\nThis past July marked the tenth anniversary of the\r\nhorrific Srebrenica massacres, in which about 7,900\r\nMuslim men and boys were summarily executed in\r\nwhat has been recognized by the Tribunal as a\r\ngenocide. I was honoured to speak at the moving\r\nceremony at the memorial for the victims on 11 July\r\n2005. The suspected engineers of that genocide,\r\nKaradić and Mladić, have been evading justice now\r\nfor a decade. It is hard to dispute the European\r\nParliaments July resolution stating that the capture,\r\ntransfer and condemnation of those guilty of war\r\ncrimes is a minimum act of recognition for the\r\nthousands of war crimes victims in Srebrenica and\r\nelsewhere. Against such a horrifying backdrop,\r\napprehending and trying those three senior-level\r\naccused is the very least that we can do.\r\nFull cooperation from the States in the region is\r\nparamount if we are to secure the arrest of the\r\nremaining fugitives. States cooperation has improved\r\nin some cases in the past year. There has been a\r\ndramatic increase in the number of indictees\r\ntransferred to the Tribunal  24 since the end of last\r\nyear  thanks to the efforts of the authorities of both\r\nSerbia and Montenegro and the Republika Srpska.\r\nHowever, the Serbian Government has not executed\r\nother arrest warrants transmitted to it by the Tribunal.\r\n6\r\nA/60/PV.30\r\nFive of the seven accused remaining at large, including\r\nMladić, are believed to be in Serbia and Montenegro or\r\nthe Republika Srpska.\r\nOverall, the Republika Srpskas level of\r\ncooperation with the Tribunal remains insufficient, as it\r\nhas provided no information on Karadić and Mladić,\r\nand has failed to transfer wartime documentation to\r\nThe Hague. Croatias level of cooperation remains\r\nsatisfactory in most areas, with the marked exception\r\nof that countrys failure to apprehend and render\r\nGotovina to The Hague.\r\nFinally, it goes without saying that when and if\r\nthe fugitives move across borders to avoid arrest, the\r\nauthorities of the State to which they move will be\r\nsimilarly obliged to pursue, arrest and transfer those\r\nfugitives to The Hague without delay.\r\nBy now I hope it is clear that over the past year\r\nthe Tribunal has been working at full throttle. One of\r\nthe chief factors affecting the Tribunals ability to\r\noperate at full capacity and with increased efficiency\r\nwas the General Assemblys lifting of the hiring freeze\r\nin January 2005. As I reported last year, the 2004\r\nfreeze jeopardized the Tribunals ability to complete its\r\nmission. With the lifting of the freeze and the passage\r\nof resolution 59/274, which provided much-needed\r\nappropriations, we were able to replace the requisite\r\nstaff and to continue apace. In order to avoid a\r\nrepetition of such difficulties, I call on all States to pay\r\ntheir assessed contributions in a timely manner.\r\nIn one sense, the citizens of the former\r\nYugoslavia are fortunate compared with the citizens of\r\nother war-torn regions: they have the Tribunal. The\r\nTribunal has not only made a fundamental and lasting\r\ncontribution by bringing justice to thousands in the\r\nregion, but it has also established an essential historical\r\nrecord of the atrocities resulting from the war. The\r\nTribunals assignment of personal criminal\r\nresponsibility to those who abused their positions of\r\nleadership and power helps to dispel the view that\r\ncertain rogue nations and ethnic groups must forever\r\nbear the stain of their leaders misdeeds. The Tribunals\r\nachievements have also generated increased respect for\r\nthe rule of law, which has sparked judicial reforms\r\nthroughout the region. Justice is an essential element of\r\nnational reconciliation, and thus peace and justice go\r\nhand in hand. Due largely to the Tribunal, the States of\r\nthe former Yugoslavia now have the opportunity to\r\nconstruct a lasting peace.\r\nThe benefits of the Tribunal are, moreover, felt\r\nfar beyond the Balkan region. The ICTYs work has\r\nfurther challenged the notorious tradition of impunity\r\nfor senior officials who commit the most serious\r\ninternational crimes. During its 11 years of existence,\r\nthe Tribunal has also shown that transparent\r\ninternational justice is viable. We have built an\r\nimpressive and unprecedented body of jurisprudence\r\nboth on substantive international humanitarian and\r\ncriminal law, and, especially, on criminal procedure \r\na subject on which there was little precedent from\r\nNuremberg. Our judgments on procedural and\r\nsubstantive law now supply the foundation for all\r\ninternational criminal courts, and our success serves as\r\na model for national prosecutions of those who commit\r\nwartime atrocities. Our leading decisions on\r\ninternational humanitarian law will provide essential\r\nguidance for the tribunals in the former Yugoslavia,\r\nand our staff members are sharing their valuable\r\nexperience by training staff for those nascent courts.\r\nOur jurisprudence will likewise contribute to the\r\nsuccess of other national and international courts\r\ndesigned to enforce international humanitarian law,\r\nincluding the Special Court for Sierra Leone and the\r\nInternational Criminal Court, both of which have used\r\nour Tribunal as a model. Lastly, understanding of\r\ninternational humanitarian and criminal law and human\r\nrights law has increased dramatically as the world has\r\nfollowed the proceedings at The Hague.\r\nAs with many things of great value, however,\r\nthere is a cost. The cases on the Tribunals docket are\r\nby definition large and complex, and hence our\r\nproceedings are necessarily lengthy and costly. Often,\r\nthe crimes charged  connected to entire military\r\ncampaigns  occurred over the course of months or\r\nyears and across many locations, and involved several\r\ndefendants. With many counts in some indictments,\r\ndozens or hundreds of witnesses, thousands of pages of\r\ndocuments  most of which have to be translated from\r\nregional languages into English and French, the\r\nTribunals working languages  the trials are\r\nextremely complex. Member States continued\r\nfinancial support is the key to our success. And, I\r\nsubmit, the funds required to complete the Tribunals\r\nmission are a small price to pay for the significant\r\nrewards to be gained from the Tribunals work. As\r\nZaid Al-Hadidi, former representative of Jordan to the\r\nUnited Nations, has wisely pointed out, peace is far\r\nmore cost-effective than war. Indeed, the yearly cost of\r\noperating the Tribunal is less than one twentieth the\r\n7\r\nA/60/PV.30\r\nyearly cost of the peacekeeping operations in the\r\nformer Yugoslavia during the war. With the full support\r\nof all Member States, we look forward to completing\r\nour landmark mission and providing a model for\r\ncriminal tribunals yet to come.\r\nAs the Tribunal moves 10 years beyond the\r\natrocities at Srebrenica, the continued support of the\r\ninternational community is more important than ever in\r\norder to demonstrate to the world that such crimes will\r\nnot be tolerated and will not go unpunished. The work\r\nof the Tribunal will ensure that those most responsible\r\nfor such serious international crimes will, as we move\r\nbriskly towards the Tribunals completion, continue to\r\nreceive the very highest standards of international\r\njustice. Our leading decisions will continue to provide\r\nessential guidance for the fair and effective prosecution\r\nof those who commit wartime atrocities.\r\nFinally, I would like to report that my tenure as\r\nPresident of the ICTY will end in mid-November,\r\nthough I will continue on as an Appeals Chamber\r\njudge. This thus marks my final appearance before the\r\nAssembly in the capacity of President of the Tribunal.\r\nIt has truly been a great honour and privilege to lead\r\nthat great institution. Please allow me the opportunity\r\nto express all my sincere gratitude for members\r\ncontinued support of the Tribunal and, indeed, of\r\ninternational justice and the fight against impunity.\r\nThe President: I want to thank the President of\r\nthe International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia\r\nfor his long service to the Tribunal and to the\r\ninternational community and for preserving the values\r\nof justice in the world.\r\nMr. Watson (United Kingdom): I have the\r\nhonour to speak on behalf of the European Union. The\r\nacceding countries Bulgaria and Romania, the\r\ncandidate countries Croatia and Turkey, the European\r\nFree Trade Association country Iceland, member of the\r\nEuropean Economic Area, and Ukraine align\r\nthemselves with this statement.\r\nFirst of all we would like to thank Judge Møse,\r\nPresident of the International Criminal Tribunal for\r\nRwanda (ICTR) and Judge Meron, President of the\r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former\r\nYugoslavia (ICTY), for their briefings. We also thank\r\nJudge Meron for his distinguished service during his\r\nterm as President.\r\nThe European Union believes strongly in the\r\nprinciple of no impunity for the most serious crimes of\r\nconcern to the international community. Both the ICTR\r\nand the ICTY were established to hold individuals\r\naccountable for such crimes. Peace, justice and the rule\r\nof law are inextricably linked, and both Tribunals have\r\nmade very important contributions towards\r\nreconciliation and peacebuilding in the countries that\r\nthey have served. The European Union reaffirms its\r\nfull support for the ICTR and the ICTY, and commends\r\ntheir entire staff in their efforts to bring justice to\r\nvictims of the most shocking crimes.\r\nWe thank the ICTR for its concise tenth annual\r\nreport (A/60/229) and the ICTY for its comprehensive\r\ntwelfth annual report (A/60/267), although we regret\r\nthat the latters length impeded a more timely\r\ndistribution. We welcome the developments and\r\nimprovements achieved over the past 12 months.\r\nThe ICTR has delivered three trial judgements,\r\nbringing the total to 19 judgements involving 25\r\naccused since 1997. A further 25 persons are currently\r\non trial. The Appeals Chamber has delivered four\r\njudgements in respect of five persons. Appeals in a\r\nfurther 10 trial judgements and one application for\r\nreview of the trial judgement are pending. Five new\r\ntrials have been started during the reporting period. We\r\nare grateful for the further update on progress today.\r\nThe ICTR submitted its revised Completion Strategy\r\n(S/2005/336, enclosure) to the Security Council in\r\nMay, and we welcome the construction of the fourth\r\ncourtroom as an important element in that strategy.\r\nUnfortunately, we have had little time to study\r\nthe ICTY report. But we know that a large number of\r\nindictees have arrived at the ICTY. We recognize that\r\nthe increased numbers awaiting trial in The Hague will\r\nimpact on the timely implementation of the Completion\r\nStrategy, but hope that that can be kept to a minimum.\r\nWe welcome the completion of pre-indictment\r\ninvestigations and the submission of final indictments.\r\nThe EU also warmly welcomes the establishment of\r\nworking groups of judges on speeding up trials and\r\nappeals, and looks forward to hearing more about the\r\nimplementation of the recommendations of those\r\ngroups.\r\nThe European Union welcomes the commitment\r\nof the Presidents of both Tribunals to their completion\r\nstrategies. The Tribunals should indeed make every\r\neffort to respect the deadlines set out in Security\r\n8\r\nA/60/PV.30\r\nCouncil resolutions 1503 (2003) and 1534 (2004). In\r\nreturn, the international community also has a\r\ncommitment. Sufficient resources, cooperation,\r\nassistance and the support of Member States are\r\nessential to the work of the Tribunals.\r\nThe European Union welcomes the considerable\r\nimprovement in the cooperation of States with the\r\nTribunals over the past 12 months. It is crucial that\r\nStates cooperate with requests for access to archives\r\nand documents, in securing the appearance in court of\r\nprosecution witnesses and in the arrest and transfer of\r\nindictees still at large. We reiterate the need to\r\nintensify efforts to arrest and transfer Radovan\r\nKaradzic, Ratko Mladic and Ante Gotovina to the\r\nICTY and Félicien Kabuga to the ICTR for trial. The\r\ncontinuous, full cooperation of Rwanda and its\r\nneighbours and the countries of the western Balkans\r\nwith the respective Tribunals remains essential.\r\nMs. Bahemuka (Kenya), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe EU welcomes the efforts made by both\r\nTribunals to transfer cases to domestic jurisdictions\r\nand their activities in the area of national capacity-\r\nbuilding. We welcome the opening of the Special\r\nChamber for war crimes prosecutions in the State\r\nCourt of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 9 March 2005 and\r\nthe first transfer of a case from the ICTY on\r\n29 September. The EU restates its appeal to the\r\nTribunals to ensure that the necessary standards of fair\r\ntrial, independence and full respect for human rights\r\nare complied with in national trials.\r\nFinally, we would like to reassure the Tribunals\r\nof the full support of the EU and to thank all members\r\nof the Tribunals and their Chambers, Appeals\r\nChambers and Registries, as well as the Offices of the\r\nProsecutors, for their contribution to peace, justice and\r\nthe rule of law and for the legacy they will leave for\r\nthe future development of international criminal law.\r\nMr. Rosli (Malaysia): I should like to thank\r\nJudge Erik Møse, President of the International\r\nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), and Judge\r\nTheodore Meron, President of the International\r\nCriminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY),\r\nfor presenting the reports of the two Tribunals\r\n(A/60/229, A/60/267) and for their excellent leadership\r\nof the Tribunals during the respective reporting\r\nperiods. The reports provide a comprehensive review\r\nof the progress of the work of the Tribunals as well as\r\nthe difficulties encountered by them. We commend\r\nboth Presidents and all members of the Chambers, the\r\nOffices of the Prosecutors and the Registries of both\r\nTribunals for the progress achieved so far.\r\nMalaysia continues to strongly believe in the\r\nimportance of upholding the principles of justice and\r\nequality, which international humanitarian law stands\r\nfor. We regard adherence to the rule of law to be a\r\nnecessary basis for upholding those principles. The\r\nTribunals were established, among other things, to\r\nbring to justice persons allegedly responsible for\r\nviolations of international humanitarian law and to\r\ncontribute to the restoration of peace by promoting\r\nreconciliation in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.\r\nSince their creation, the Tribunals have played a\r\nsignificant role in clearly demonstrating that genocide\r\nand other serious violations of international\r\nhumanitarian law will not be tolerated. The Tribunals\r\nwere created to ensure that the perpetrators of genocide\r\nand other serious violations of international\r\nhumanitarian law will not get away with impunity.\r\nThe work of the Tribunals is of immense\r\nimportance in bringing to justice the perpetrators of\r\natrocities and in the development of international\r\njustice and international law. There is no doubt that the\r\ndecisions of the Tribunals have contributed to the\r\nprogressive and constructive development of case law\r\nin the spheres of general international law and\r\ninternational humanitarian law, with respect to various\r\nquestions of procedure and competence, as well as with\r\nrespect to substantive issues of considerable\r\nimportance. The Tribunals have pioneered advocacy\r\nfor victim-oriented restitutive justice in international\r\ncriminal law.\r\nMalaysia is pleased to note that both the ICTY\r\nand the ICTR have put considerable effort into\r\nimplementation of their Completion Strategies, as set\r\nout in Security Council resolutions 1503 (2003) and\r\n1534 (2004), which require both Tribunals to take all\r\npossible measures to complete investigations by the\r\nend of 2004, complete all trial activities at first\r\ninstance by the end of 2008 and complete all work in\r\n2010. We are also pleased to note that both Tribunals\r\nhave continued to make substantial reforms to improve\r\ntheir administrative capacity while working towards\r\nthe timely implementation of the Completion Strategy.\r\nThe appointment of ad litem judges has allowed\r\nthe Tribunals to increase their judicial productivity and\r\n9\r\nA/60/PV.30\r\nmeet the demands of the rise in cases. The Tribunals\r\nmust be in a position to undertake their tasks\r\nefficiently so that detainees are spared undue delay in\r\nthe completion of their trials. With the appointment of\r\nthe ad litem judges, the Tribunals should be able to\r\nmeet their target of completing all trials by 2008. My\r\ndelegation is pleased to note that a Malaysian national\r\nis contributing to the process through his service as an\r\nad litem judge.\r\nI would now like to comment first on the\r\nactivities of the ICTR. Malaysia is pleased to note from\r\nthe report that the ICTR is on course to complete its\r\ntrials by 2008. The Presidents efforts in the scheduling\r\nand planning of trials to best utilize time and resources\r\nshould be commended. We are pleased to see that since\r\nhis appointment in 2003, the Prosecutor has stepped up\r\nefforts to streamline cases, as required by the\r\nCompletion Strategy, and transfer cases to national\r\nauthorities. Malaysia also notes that the construction of\r\nthe fourth courtroom has helped speed up the trials and\r\nremains a crucial element of the Tribunals Completion\r\nStrategy.\r\nIn addition, it is critical to the success of the\r\nTribunal that the people of the region be informed of\r\nits work and comprehend its significance. We\r\nappreciate the perseverance of the Registrar in\r\npromoting greater awareness of the Tribunal and in\r\nengaging the interest and the support of the local\r\npopulation, States of the region and the international\r\ncommunity through capacity-building programmes. We\r\nencourage him to continue his efforts.\r\nTurning to the ICTY, my delegation notes with\r\nappreciation that the Tribunal has undergone structural\r\nand operational reform during the reporting period.\r\nThe most significant internal reform was the\r\namendment of rules 98 bis and 73 (D) to enable the\r\nTribunal to shorten the time frame by allowing oral\r\narguments instead of written briefs and to conserve the\r\nresources of the Tribunal. Malaysia is pleased to note\r\nthat the Tribunal is using technology for its\r\nmodernization. The implementation of the e-Court\r\nsystem has contributed to speeding up trials and\r\nappeals.\r\nMalaysia notes that part of the lasting legacy of\r\nthe ICTY will be the strengthened criminal justice\r\nsystem in Bosnia and Herzegovina. To that end, the\r\nestablishment of the Special Chamber for war crimes\r\nprosecutions is crucial for enabling the ICTY to\r\ncomplete its trial work by 2008. The establishment of\r\nthe Chamber is testament to the growing and improved\r\ncooperation with the national authorities. Although the\r\nChamber will allow for the transfer of cases of lower-\r\nlevel prosecutions to national jurisdiction, more work\r\nwill be required to ensure that they are completed in a\r\ntimely manner.\r\nIt has been more than a decade since the Tribunal\r\nwas established. Malaysia is pleased to note that it has\r\nbeen making tremendous progress in completing the\r\ncases before it. However, we are concerned that 10\r\npublicly indicted persons remain at large, including\r\nmajor indicted war criminals, in particular Radovan\r\nKaradzic and Ratko Mladic. We strongly hope that the\r\nmatter will be addressed as expeditiously as possible.\r\nMalaysia shares the concern expressed in the report at\r\nthe fact that such major figures remaining at large, with\r\nimpunity, would not only prevent the Tribunal from\r\ncompleting its work within the time frame but would\r\nalso undermine the successful cooperation with the\r\nnational authorities.\r\nThe work of the ICTY and the ICTR has greatly\r\ncontributed to the field of post-conflict justice  not\r\nonly in furthering international criminal jurisprudence\r\non matters such as individual responsibility and in\r\nconnection with the ability to exercise jurisdiction over\r\ncrimes committed during internal conflicts, but also in\r\nterms of procedural refinements. In reiterating its\r\nfullest support for both Tribunals, Malaysia calls once\r\nagain on the international community to give full and\r\nsustained support to the Tribunals in the\r\nimplementation of their mandate and objectives. A\r\nsustained commitment by the major Powers is also\r\ncrucial. The delivery of justice is important for a\r\nsustainable peace-building process. Without justice,\r\nthere will be no peace.\r\nMr. Haneda (Japan): At the outset, I would like\r\nto thank the Presidents of the Tribunals, Judge Theodor\r\nMeron and Judge Erik Møse, for presenting their\r\nannual reports to the General Assembly. I also thank\r\nJudge Meron for his dedicated service as the President\r\nof the Tribunal.\r\nJapan appreciates the fact that the Prosecutors of\r\nthe two Tribunals completed their investigative work\r\nby the end of 2004 and submitted the indictments of\r\nsenior indictees in accordance with the completion\r\nstrategies. We strongly hope that both the ICTY and the\r\nICTR will continue to make the utmost effort to\r\n10\r\nA/60/PV.30\r\npromote the efficient and effective conduct of their\r\ntrial activities and to improve their management\r\ncapacity in order to ensure the completion of all trials\r\nby the end of 2010.\r\nAllow me to make a few comments on the work\r\nof the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia\r\n(ICTY).\r\nFirst of all, we welcome the election of the 27 ad\r\nlitem judges by the General Assembly on 24 August\r\nthis year, and we look forward to their contribution, in\r\ncooperation with the 16 permanent judges elected last\r\nautumn and to be appointed on 17 November, to\r\nbringing about justice in the region of the former\r\nYugoslavia and to achieving the Completion Strategy\r\nof the ICTY.\r\nJapan notes that Stankovic has been transferred\r\nfrom the ICTY to the war crimes chamber of the Court\r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina, which represents the first\r\ntransfer of an ICTY accused to the domestic courts. It\r\nis a remarkable step forward towards the establishment\r\nof the rule of law in the region that mid- to low-level\r\naccused are going to be tried in a national jurisdiction.\r\nWe hope that the judicial capacity of States in the\r\nregion will be strengthened and that the transfer of\r\nmid- to low-level defendants to domestic courts will be\r\nfurther enhanced, ensuring that international standards\r\nof due process and the rights of defendants are\r\nobserved.\r\nThose achievements notwithstanding, Japan\r\nremains concerned that those responsible for the most\r\nserious violations of international humanitarian law\r\nKaradzic, Mladic and Gotovina  have yet to be\r\narrested. Japan reiterates that the full commitment of\r\nneighbouring States is essential for the arrest and\r\nextradition of those fugitives.\r\nNext, let me turn to the work of the International\r\nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR).\r\nJapan requests that the ICTR continue its efforts\r\nto conduct trials in as effective a manner as possible, in\r\norder to realize the prospect set out in its annual report\r\nthat the first phase of the trials will be completed by\r\n2008, and then finish implementing the entire\r\nCompletion Strategy.\r\nAs stated in the ICTRs annual report, it is\r\nevidence of the progress made towards bringing about\r\njustice and the end of impunity that guilt and innocence\r\nhave been determined with respect to the alleged\r\nformer leaders, who probably would not have been\r\nbrought before a court but for the establishment of the\r\nICTR. We note with appreciation that the transfer of\r\ncases to domestic courts is proceeding satisfactorily, as\r\ndemonstrated by the fact that the Prosecutor had\r\ntransferred the files of 15 suspects to Rwanda by\r\n30 June 2005. In that regard, we reiterate our call for\r\nfurther cooperation by neighbouring States.\r\nTaking into account the intentions of both\r\nTribunals to complete the first phase of trials by the\r\nend of 2008, in accordance with their completion\r\nstrategies, it is high time for further consideration to be\r\ngiven to future schedules, that is, the precise\r\nscheduling of appeals cases. Scheduling well in\r\nadvance and better coordination between the two\r\nTribunals will be required to avoid placing too heavy a\r\nburden on the Appeal Chambers of the Tribunal.\r\nWe call for the utmost cooperation and effort on\r\nthe part of all staff of the Tribunals, neighbouring\r\nStates and the international community so that a great\r\npurpose can be fulfilled, namely bringing to justice all\r\nthose responsible for the serious violations of\r\ninternational humanitarian law that were committed in\r\nthe two regions.\r\nFinally, let me say once again that Japan carefully\r\nexamines the regular reports of the ICTY and the ICTR\r\nto the Security Council and to the General Assembly\r\non their efforts and on the progress being made\r\ntowards the fulfilment of their completion strategies.\r\nMr. Andrianarivelo-Razafy (Madagascar)\r\n(spoke in French): The delegation of Madagascar\r\nwould like to thank the President of the International\r\nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the President\r\nof the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda,\r\nrespectively, for their informative and relevant\r\nstatements.\r\nThe establishment of the two Tribunals was of\r\nhistorical importance, as they were the first courts to\r\ncondemn crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity\r\nand indescribable atrocities. They were pioneers\r\nbecause their work contributed to the adoption of the\r\nRome Statute creating the International Criminal\r\nCourt, a standing court whose ultimate aim is to put an\r\nend to impunity.\r\nMy delegation has reviewed with interest\r\ndocuments A/60/267 and A/60/229 and would like to\r\npay tribute to the staff of the two Tribunals for the\r\n11\r\nA/60/PV.30\r\nuntiring efforts they made to speedily alleviate the\r\nburden of work of the courts and to fulfil the heavy and\r\ndemanding responsibilities that they must shoulder as\r\npart of the Completion Strategy.\r\nWith regard to the International Criminal\r\nTribunal for Rwanda, my country notes with\r\nsatisfaction the measures undertaken to speed up the\r\ntrials currently under way before the Trial Chambers.\r\nThe Tribunal is now working at full throttle\r\nthanks to the implementation of the Completion\r\nStrategy, which involves the scheduling and planning\r\nof present and future trials; an increase in the number\r\nof judges through the creation of a pool of ad litem\r\njudges, pursuant to Security Council resolutions\r\n1431 (2002) and 1512 (2003); the establishment of a\r\ntrial committee whose aim is to facilitate the\r\npreparation of new cases; and the creation of a\r\nTranslation Working Group charged with considering\r\nways and means to facilitate the translation of\r\ndocuments, so as to avoid delays in the conduct of\r\ncases.\r\nWe are confident that the inauguration of a fourth\r\ncourtroom, which has been operational since 1 March\r\n2005, will contribute to alleviating the Courts heavy\r\nburden of work. We would like to take this opportunity\r\nto thank the Governments of Great Britain and of\r\nNorway for their generous contribution, which made it\r\npossible to build the hearing room in record time.\r\nIn the 10 years of its existence, the ICTR has\r\ncarried out the trials of 50 persons, including highly\r\nplaced individuals. In accordance with Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1503 (2003), the Prosecutors\r\nOffice has completed its inquiries into the alleged\r\nperpetrators of the crime of genocide. In our view, that\r\nis an encouraging sign of improvement in the work of\r\nthe ICTR.\r\nI would like to underscore that the true role of\r\ninternational tribunals is to seek out and pass\r\njudgement on the masterminds of the most serious\r\ncrimes, such as genocide, as well as on the principal\r\nactors and senior-level perpetrators  the leaders \r\nleaving judgement in the case of their subordinates to\r\nvarious national courts. Transferring intermediate- or\r\nlower-level accused to competent domestic courts and\r\nproviding active support for the strengthening of\r\njudicial capacities and the training of the personnel of\r\ndomestic courts are also key elements in the strategy.\r\nThe two Tribunals have a historic responsibility,\r\nparticularly with regard to conflict prevention. They\r\nare responsible for defending humanitarian values and\r\ncontributing to the restoration and maintenance of\r\npeace in regions of the world where atrocious crimes\r\nhave taken place.\r\nIn accordance with the time frame set out in\r\nresolutions 1503 (2003) and 1534 (2004), both\r\nTribunals are currently in the Completion Strategy\r\nphase. In that context, we support the\r\nrecommendations contained in document A/60/229 that\r\nthe international community provide the Tribunals with\r\nsufficient human, financial and material resources to\r\nenable them to carry out their respective mandates in\r\nan effective manner. Furthermore, the full cooperation\r\nof national authorities is of great importance, because\r\ninternational criminal justice and national criminal\r\njustice are complementary.\r\nFinally, we urge all Member States to cooperate\r\nclosely with the two Tribunals with a view to\r\novercoming problems relating to the arrest and transfer\r\nto them of accused and criminals still at large.\r\nMy delegation would like to take this opportunity\r\nto express its heartfelt gratitude to Judge Theodor\r\nMeron, President of the International Criminal Tribunal\r\nfor the Former Yugoslavia, for his worthy contribution\r\nto the work of that institution.\r\nMr. Løvald (Norway): I would like to begin by\r\nexpressing Norways full recognition of the\r\nachievements and high standards of the International\r\nCriminal Tribunals for Rwanda and for the Former\r\nYugoslavia, as reflected in the various well-reasoned\r\njudgements and in the reports before us. We would like\r\nto thank the Presidents of both Tribunals for the\r\ndetailed annual reports, which in our view accurately\r\nreflect the sustained progress made during the period\r\nunder review.\r\nThe work of the Tribunals has played a crucial\r\nrole in advancing the cause of justice in Rwanda and\r\nthe former Yugoslavia. As we have consistently\r\nmaintained, the Tribunals also have a broader\r\nsignificance. They represent effective mechanisms for\r\nthe enforcement of international criminal law and will\r\nleave a legacy of international jurisprudence that can\r\nguide other courts, including those at the national\r\nlevel, as well as the International Criminal Court, and\r\nprevent the commission of the worst crimes of\r\ninternational concern. As such, they are contributing to\r\n12\r\nA/60/PV.30\r\nthe development of international criminal justice and to\r\nthe fight against impunity for mass atrocities in\r\ngeneral.\r\nWe commend both Tribunals for their efforts to\r\nput the completion strategies, approved by the Security\r\nCouncil, into effect. The Tribunals have increased their\r\nadministrative efficiency significantly, and both appear\r\nto be on schedule. According to the report of the\r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR),\r\nthe Tribunal is on course to complete all trials in the\r\nfirst instance, involving 65 to 70 persons, by 2008.\r\nThe financial situation of the Tribunals, however,\r\nremains worrying. It could threaten the implementation\r\nof the Completion Strategies. It is therefore of the\r\nutmost importance that all States honour their financial\r\ncommitments and pay their assessed contributions on\r\ntime.\r\nWe are pleased to note that both the Rwanda\r\nTribunal and the Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia\r\nhave continued to operate at full capacity during the\r\nperiod under review.\r\nNorway welcomes the establishment of the fourth\r\ncourtroom at the ICTR, which will help to further\r\nincrease the Tribunals capacity. The Tribunal is now\r\nrunning trials in the four courtrooms simultaneously.\r\nNorways financial contribution, together with that of\r\nthe United Kingdom, to the construction of that\r\ncourtroom is a testimony to our continuing strong\r\nsupport for the Tribunal.\r\nIn implementing the Completion Strategies, both\r\nTribunals have rightly resolved to concentrate on the\r\nmost senior leaders suspected of bearing the greatest\r\nresponsibility for the crimes within the jurisdiction of\r\nthe Tribunals. At the same time, the Tribunals have\r\nfocused on transferring cases involving intermediate-\r\nand low-level offenders to national jurisdictions, where\r\npossible. It is important that they receive the full\r\nsupport and cooperation of the international\r\ncommunity. Norway has implemented legal procedures\r\nthat will enable us to fully cooperate with and assist\r\nthe Tribunal. We urge other States to do the same.\r\nWe are encouraged by the establishment of the\r\nWar Crimes Chamber of the State of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina. During the period under review, there has\r\nbeen an increasing number of persons awaiting trial at\r\nthe International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia\r\n(ICTY), which could severely impact on the timely\r\nimplementation of the Completion Strategy. Since\r\nNovember 2004, 22 new indictees have arrived at the\r\nICTY. The new War Crimes Chamber will contribute to\r\nthe success of the Completion Strategy. Norway has\r\ntherefore contributed financially to the establishment\r\nof the Chamber.\r\nThe Tribunals increased cooperation with States,\r\nrelevant institutions and non-governmental\r\norganizations is partly a result of the expanded\r\nactivities and continuous development of the\r\nTribunals outreach programmes. Norway commends\r\nthe Tribunals for their efforts to assist in strengthening\r\nnational jurisdictions in their handling of cases and to\r\nprovide accurate information about their activities in\r\norder to raise awareness of and increase support for\r\ntheir work.\r\nNorway reiterates the need to intensify efforts to\r\narrest and transfer to the Tribunals for trial the main\r\nfugitive indictees, as identified by the Security\r\nCouncil. The main mission of the Tribunals will not be\r\nfulfilled unless the highest-ranking indictees are\r\nbrought to justice.\r\nAll States must honour their international\r\nobligation to cooperate with regard to requests for full\r\nand effective assistance to the Tribunals. That also\r\napplies with regard to witnesses, giving financial and\r\nmaterial support and, not least, providing practical\r\nassistance in the enforcement of sentences. We\r\nencourage States to prove their continued commitment\r\nto the work of the Tribunals through concrete action in\r\nthose crucial fields. We will stand by our long-term\r\ncommitment to the successful completion of the\r\nmissions assigned to the two Tribunals by the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nMr. Manongi (United Republic of Tanzania): We\r\nwould like to thank the President of the International\r\nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), Judge Eric\r\nMøse, and the President of the International Criminal\r\nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, Judge Theodor\r\nMeron, for their respective briefings.\r\nThe pursuit of justice in the wake of genocide and\r\nserious violations of human rights in Rwanda and in\r\nthe former Yugoslavia is an undertaking by the two\r\nTribunals on our behalf and in our interests. For us,\r\ntheir work deserves our utmost collective support.\r\nWe commend the ICTR for the pace of its\r\nprosecutions and dedication to its Completion Strategy.\r\n13\r\nA/60/PV.30\r\nWe recognize that this planning is dependent on the\r\nassistance and cooperation of States being requested to\r\nassist with apprehending the indictees who remain at\r\nlarge.\r\nIn the interest of justice and stability, not only in\r\nRwanda but also in the Great Lakes region,\r\napprehending and extraditing those under indictment\r\nneed to be given greater attention. This is in keeping\r\nwith the obligation by all Member States to support the\r\nTribunal in discharging its mandate. We should do\r\nnothing that might subvert the 2008 completion target\r\nthat the Tribunal has set for itself.\r\nWe welcome the completion of the fourth\r\ncourtroom and are grateful that it has contributed to the\r\nTribunals efficiency as well as to its Completion\r\nStrategy. We thank the Governments of Norway and\r\nthe United Kingdom whose voluntary contributions\r\nmade the courtroom construction possible.\r\nWe are particularly encouraged by the effort\r\nbeing undertaken by the Prosecutor under rule 11 bis to\r\nexplore how and under what conditions some indictees\r\nmight be transferred to Rwanda for prosecution. This is\r\na reaffirmation of the strengthening of and confidence\r\nin the judicial system in Rwanda. It is also an\r\nimportant contribution to the mutual trust between the\r\nGovernment of Rwanda and the Tribunal. It is in this\r\nspirit that we welcome the transfer of 15 dossiers of\r\nunindicted suspects to the Government of Rwanda. The\r\nsuspects, of course, remain innocent until proven\r\nguilty.\r\nTanzania continues to support measures by the\r\nTribunal to disseminate information concerning its\r\nwork internationally and, more importantly, in\r\nRwanda. If Rwanda is to achieve healing and\r\nreconciliation, forgiveness and reconciliation must\r\ncome from within. We see the Tribunals Outreach\r\nProgramme as being effective in that regard and,\r\ntherefore, it needs greater support as part of the\r\nCompletion Strategy.\r\nWe wish to underscore that the Tribunals\r\nCompletion Strategy is premised on the prosecution of\r\nhigh-ranking officials and those bearing gravest\r\nresponsibility for the crimes committed during the\r\ngenocide. We therefore join in calling on other Member\r\nStates to accept the transfer of the remaining lower-\r\nstatus cases to their respective national jurisdictions for\r\nprosecution.\r\nIt is our firm belief, in support of the Tribunals\r\nfor Rwanda and for the former Yugoslavia, that those\r\nindicted by the courts must be brought to justice if the\r\naffected countries and regions are to see stability. It is\r\nalso our conviction that the success of the two\r\nTribunals is attributable to the continued financial\r\nsupport from the international community. We appeal\r\nagain to Member States to pay their assessed\r\ncontributions to the Tribunals. They have proven that\r\nthey are now more efficient and need our strong\r\nsupport to fulfil their Completion Strategies. The\r\nprovision of adequate financial resources is critical. We\r\nshould not fail them.\r\nMr. Kaludjerovic (Serbia and Montenegro): In\r\nthe wake of the catastrophic earthquake that caused\r\nextensive loss of life and material damage in Pakistan,\r\nIndia and Afghanistan, I would like to convey the\r\ndeepest condolences of my Government to the people\r\nand Governments of those countries.\r\nAt the outset I would like to thank the President\r\nof the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former\r\nYugoslavia (ICTY), Judge Theodor Meron, for his\r\ncomprehensive annual report.\r\nI am pleased to be able to inform the Assembly\r\nthat Serbia and Montenegro has recently opened\r\nnegotiations on the Stabilization and Association\r\nAgreement with the European Union, which\r\ndemonstrates our firm commitment to build upon the\r\nbest traditions and achievements in strengthening our\r\nsociety and relations with our neighbours. This step\r\nwill undoubtedly bring us closer to the ultimate goal:\r\nEuro-Atlantic integration.\r\nIn that respect, the authorities of Serbia and\r\nMontenegro and the Government of Serbia continue in\r\ntheir efforts to honour their international obligations\r\ntowards the ICTY. The Completion Strategy of our\r\ncooperation with the Hague Tribunal is  and we are\r\ncompletely aware of that  of a vital interest to Serbia\r\nand Montenegro. There is no other solution and there is\r\nno alternative to full and unconditional cooperation.\r\nCooperation with the ICTY can be considered in\r\nseveral aspects: apprehension and transfer of fugitives,\r\ngranting of waivers to Government officials, turning\r\nover documents, dialogue and exchange of visits,\r\nregional cooperation and the ICTY Completion\r\nStrategy.\r\n14\r\nA/60/PV.30\r\nSerbia and Montenegro is continuously taking all\r\nnecessary measures to facilitate the voluntary surrender\r\nand arrest of the remaining fugitives believed to be\r\nwithin its territory. The number of indictees transferred\r\nfrom Serbia and Montenegro to the Tribunal rose to 37.\r\nThose transfers serve, inter alia, as an example of\r\nefficient cooperation based on reliable information\r\nprovided in a timely manner.\r\nAt the same time, the authorities of Serbia and\r\nMontenegro are demonstrating their firm commitment\r\nto fulfil their international obligations by exerting\r\ncontinuous efforts to find and, if possible, apprehend\r\nsix remaining fugitives that, according to the Office of\r\nthe Prosecutor, are transiting through or residing in the\r\nterritory of Serbia and Montenegro. The number of\r\nrequests for the assistance of the Office of the\r\nProsecutor has exceeded 940. Those requests are being\r\nprocessed in a prompt and timely manner, with fewer\r\nthan 2 to 3 per cent still pending or unanswered longer\r\nthan two months.\r\nThe Council of Ministers of Serbia and\r\nMontenegro and the Government of the Republic of\r\nSerbia have so far granted waivers regarding official\r\nand military secrets to 350 members of the army and\r\npolice, as well as Government officials. In this area of\r\ncooperation, Serbia and Montenegro is providing\r\neffective assistance to the Office of the Prosecutor and\r\nthe ICTY in tracking down, interviewing and taking\r\ntestimony from witnesses and suspects.\r\nSo far, the Office of the Prosecutor has been\r\nprovided with several thousand documents, including\r\nclassified papers. These documents have been made\r\navailable to the Office of the Prosecutor much more\r\nquickly during the period covered by the report than\r\npreviously. Serbia and Montenegro now provides the\r\nOffice with all documents at its disposal.\r\nAs a sign of intensified cooperation with the\r\nICTY, the top-level exchange of visits between\r\nBelgrade and The Hague has become a regular\r\npractice. Those visits have significantly contributed to\r\nthe exchange of relevant information and the re-\r\nestablishment of an atmosphere of mutual trust and\r\nopenness. Furthermore, the parliament of the Republic\r\nof Serbia adopted a new criminal code on\r\n29 September 2005 contain many provisions that\r\nfacilitate cooperation with the ICTY.\r\nDuring a recent visit to Belgrade, the Chief\r\nProsecutor emphasized that she was satisfied with the\r\ncooperation of the competent authorities of Serbia and\r\nMontenegro and the Republic of Serbia. I am also\r\npleased to say that during her visit to Podgorica, the\r\nChief Prosecutor expressed her satisfaction at the full\r\ncooperation of the authorities of the Republic of\r\nMontenegro with the Tribunal.\r\nAn important form of two-way cooperation,\r\nperhaps the most important one, is the referral of cases\r\nin accordance with rule l1 bis of the Rules of\r\nProcedure and Evidence of the Tribunal. Even today,\r\nmention was made of the importance of the Tribunals\r\nCompletion Strategy, and the referral of cases is one of\r\nthe most important elements of the Completion\r\nStrategy. I would like to reiterate that we are ready for\r\nthe referral of cases and willing and capable of\r\nconducting fair and impartial trials against perpetrators\r\nof war crimes.\r\nThe proceedings before the Council for War\r\nCrimes in Belgrade regarding the Ovcara case have\r\nbeen assessed by all relevant international observers as\r\nvery successful and in line with international standards.\r\nI am confident that efficient cooperation will be\r\ncontinued and even promoted in the future. I would\r\nlike to emphasize in particular that it would have meant\r\na great deal to us had the Tribunal referred to Belgrade\r\nthe Mrksic, Sljivancanin and Radic case for the crimes\r\ncommitted in Ovcara. We believe that the referral of\r\nthis case to our judiciary would have been yet another\r\npowerful confirmation of the great progress achieved\r\nin cooperation over the past year.\r\nSerbia and Montenegros authorities have done\r\neverything to strengthen regional cooperation, first of\r\nall, by strengthening police cooperation and\r\ncooperation among prosecutors offices in the region.\r\nProsecutors from Serbia and Montenegro, Croatia and\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina have met several times to\r\nexplore and discuss further cooperation regarding the\r\nprosecution of war crimes. The Prosecutor of the\r\nRepublic of Serbia has signed a memorandum of\r\nunderstanding with his counterparts from Croatia and\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina. A similar memorandum is to\r\nbe signed later this year with Macedonia. The State\r\nPublic Prosecutor of the Republic of Montenegro also\r\nsigned a memorandum of understanding with Croatia\r\nand Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nWe welcome the agreement between the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(OSCE) and the ICTY allowing the existing OSCE\r\n15\r\nA/60/PV.30\r\nmissions in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and\r\nSerbia and Montenegro to monitor the war crimes trials\r\ntransferred by the Tribunal to the national courts. We\r\nare grateful to the OSCE, the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme, the Council of Europe and\r\nthose countries assisting the Republic of Serbia and the\r\nRepublic of Montenegro in amending their criminal\r\nlegislation to accord with ICTY standards and\r\nproviding training to prosecutors and judges dealing\r\nwith the war crimes trials. In order to improve our\r\ncapacity to prosecute war crimes, we are looking\r\nforward to further training opportunities.\r\nThe authorities of Serbia and Montenegro support\r\nthe European Union Council of Ministers common\r\nposition on measures for the effective implementation\r\nof the ICTY mandate relating to the freezing of the\r\nfunds of fugitives. The National Council for\r\nCooperation with the ICTY has directed the competent\r\nauthorities to explore the possibilities of implementing\r\nrespective measures in Serbia and Montenegros legal\r\nsystem. The law on freezing the assets of fugitives is\r\ncurrently before the Union Parliament. In the\r\nmeantime, the Belgrade District Court has imposed an\r\ninterim measure freezing fugitives funds and assets.\r\nWe are fully aware that complete reconciliation in\r\nthe territory of former Yugoslavia is not possible unless\r\nthe ICTY fulfils its mandate. Therefore, Serbia and\r\nMontenegro is ready to make its full contribution to the\r\nwork of the ICTY and bring to justice all those\r\nresponsible for war crimes committed in the territory\r\nof the former Yugoslavia, including Ratko Mladic.\r\nStrong action aimed at meeting our international\r\nobligations vis-à-vis the ICTY, which we consider in\r\nour national interest and vitally important to our\r\njoining Euro-Atlantic integration, will be continued.\r\nThe results achieved so far are the best proof of that.\r\nMs. Mladineo (Croatia): Croatia welcomes the\r\nReport of the International Criminal Tribunal for the\r\nFormer Yugoslavia (ICTY) to this sixtieth session of\r\nthe General Assembly. We have aligned ourselves with\r\nthe statement made on behalf of the European Union\r\nby the United Kingdom.\r\nI would like to extend my thanks to Judge Meron\r\nfor his detailed report and for all his efforts to have the\r\nTribunal fulfil its mandate in an efficient and effective\r\nmanner. May I also take this opportunity to pay tribute\r\nto him for his enormous contribution to the work and\r\nadministration of the Tribunal.\r\nAs representatives of my country have frequently\r\nnoted, Croatia was one of the leading advocates for the\r\nestablishment of the Tribunal, which has played a\r\nspecial part in achieving justice for the victims of the\r\nconflicts upon the territories which fall within its\r\njurisdiction. Croatia has always maintained a strong\r\ninterest in its success.\r\nThere are two issues which I shall address in this\r\nstatement: Croatias cooperation with the Tribunal and\r\nprogress towards implementation of its Completion\r\nStrategy.\r\nThe Tribunals Completion Strategy, which was\r\nintroduced by the then-President of the Tribunal, was\r\nendorsed by the Security Council in August 2003. The\r\nStrategy involves a three-step process encompassing\r\nthe completion of investigations, trials and appeals\r\nwithin agreed timelines. The first of the benchmarks,\r\nnamely, the completion of investigations, concluded at\r\nthe end of 2004. We note that the report shows that the\r\nachievement of this benchmark has begun to be\r\nreflected in the staffing and budget of the Tribunal.\r\nApart from the conduct of trials, a vital part of\r\nthe Completion Strategy is the work the Tribunal is\r\nundertaking with the national courts of the countries\r\nconcerned. We commend those efforts, which will,\r\namong other things, strengthen the maturity of their\r\ncourts and legal systems.\r\nWork has been done to build the capacity of\r\njudges and lawyers in Croatia in readiness for the\r\ntransfer to national jurisdiction of certain cases for\r\nprosecution. Four courts have been designated by the\r\nCroatian authorities to hear war crimes cases, and one\r\nsuch case, involving two accused, has recently been\r\ntransferred.\r\nWe are pleased that the report generally\r\ncomments objectively on the Tribunals cooperation\r\nwith the Croatian Government in regard to requests for\r\nassistance, particularly on cooperation with the Office\r\nof the State Prosecutor. However, the report predates\r\nrecent important events relating to Croatias\r\ncooperation with the Tribunal, including the latest vital\r\nassessment of the Chief Prosecutor.\r\nSince April 2005, Croatian authorities have been\r\nimplementing an action plan for cooperation with the\r\nTribunal, in particular with regard to the last\r\noutstanding issue, that of fugitive Ante Gotovina.\r\nVigorous, comprehensive and persistent measures and\r\n16\r\nA/60/PV.30\r\nactions were taken to fully implement the commitments\r\nof the action plan, the key aim of which was for\r\nCroatias authorities to do their utmost to locate,\r\napprehend and transfer the fugitive Gotovina to the\r\nTribunal. An important prerequisite was to ensure the\r\nstreamlined efficiency of the security apparatus. The\r\nTribunal has been kept continuously updated on all\r\nactivities related to the implementation of the action\r\nplan.\r\nThe Croatian Government is convinced that all\r\nrelevant authorities mandated for cooperation with the\r\nTribunal have been doing everything possible to locate,\r\narrest and transfer the fugitive. In their statements\r\nfollowing the meeting with the Chief Prosecutor Carla\r\nDel Ponte in Zagreb on 30 September 2005, both the\r\nPresident and the Prime Minister of Croatia guaranteed\r\nCroatias continuing full cooperation and commitment\r\nto resolve this issue. In his address to the European\r\nUnion Ministerial Council meeting on 3 October 2005,\r\nafter the decision of the European Union to open\r\naccession negotiations with Croatia, the Prime Minister\r\nreiterated that position.\r\nFull cooperation with the Tribunal is also\r\ndemonstrated by the timely and comprehensive\r\nresponse to its requests regarding documents and\r\nwitnesses. Judicial cooperation also continues\r\nsmoothly. Efforts aimed at curbing the political and\r\noperational support and assistance to the fugitive have\r\nshown progress. The process of monitoring and\r\ninvestigation is thorough and result-oriented. The State\r\nAttorneys Office is leading Croatias overall\r\ncooperation with the Tribunal. It also has particular\r\nresponsibility for the implementation of the action\r\nplan.\r\nThe Chief Prosecutor, in her latest assessment for\r\nthe European Union Task Force, on 3 October 2004,\r\nthat Croatia has been fully cooperating.\r\nAs has been said on many occasions by my Prime\r\nMinister, Croatia remains committed to continue\r\nimplementing its action plan until the Gotovina matter\r\nis resolved. The Government views this as an\r\nindivisible part of its broader commitment to the rule\r\nof law. The commencement of negotiations with the\r\nEuropean Union can only strengthen this resolve and\r\nassist the Government in the reforms that lie ahead. In\r\nthis context, we firmly support the work of the\r\nTribunal and its efforts to fulfil its mandate.\r\nMr. Kamanzi (Rwanda): We would like to thank\r\nthe President of the International Criminal Tribunal for\r\nRwanda (ICTR), Judge Erik Møse, for presenting the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General in document A/60/229.\r\nWe commend the President, the Prosecutor and the\r\nRegistrar of the Tribunal for their work over the past\r\nyear to ensure the successful completion of its work by\r\n2008.\r\nRwanda remains hopeful that the Tribunal will\r\ndeliver justice against those who bear the greatest\r\nresponsibility for the 1994 genocide. We pledge our\r\ncontinued support to ensure that the Tribunals work\r\nruns as smoothly as possible.\r\nAccording to the report before us, the trials of 25\r\npersons have been completed, while the cases for a\r\nfurther 25 are in progress and 16 are awaiting trial, of\r\nwhich five have been identified for transfer to national\r\ncourts. A further 14 indicted persons are still at large,\r\nfour of whom the Prosecutor intends to transfer to\r\nnational courts. Eight other cases have been\r\ninvestigated and submitted for confirmation, of which\r\nfour will be transferred to national jurisdictions for\r\ntrial. On the basis of this information, the Tribunal\r\nexpects to have completed trials involving 65 to 70\r\npersons by 2008.\r\nWhile we welcome the assessment of the\r\nexpected output of the Tribunal by 2008, we regretfully\r\nrecall that, a few years ago, the Tribunal had targeted\r\nfor trial as many as 200 suspects who bear the greatest\r\nresponsibility for the genocide. This figure was revised\r\ndownward over the years, until today, we are talking of\r\nonly 65 to 70, less than one quarter of the original\r\nfigure. It is our assessment that, while the number of\r\npersons targeted for prosecution has gone down,\r\nserious accusations remain against some of the\r\nsuspects who are no longer being considered targets for\r\nprosecution. Even as to those still targeted for\r\nprosecution, many remain at large and are being\r\nprovided with a safe haven from international justice\r\nby Member States of this Organization. We appeal to\r\nthe Prosecutor and the Security Council to enforce the\r\nrelevant provisions of the Tribunals Statute to ensure\r\nthat all States cooperate and hand over these fugitives.\r\nWe appeal to the Council to seriously consider this\r\nmatter, with a view to ensuring that no suspect evades\r\njustice.\r\nAs we have said many times before, the\r\nTribunals Completion Strategy should not be seen as\r\n17\r\nA/60/PV.30\r\nan exit strategy for the international communitys\r\nobligations to bring all suspects of the crime of\r\ngenocide to trial at the ICTR, in Rwanda or elsewhere.\r\nThe serious nature of the crime of genocide requires\r\nthat we ensure that there is no impunity.\r\nAs the Tribunal progresses towards the\r\ncompletion of its work, we should reflect on the impact\r\nit has had on justice and reconciliation in Rwanda, the\r\nprinciple reasons for which it was established in the\r\nfirst place. We believe that the impact of the Tribunal\r\non these processes in Rwanda has been constrained\r\nbecause of the geographical distance between Arusha\r\nand Rwanda and the management and ethical problems\r\nthat plagued the Tribunal in its earlier life. It would be\r\nmost unfortunate for the Tribunal to complete its work\r\nwithout impacting Rwandans, as had been envisaged\r\nwhen it was established.\r\nIn this regard, we therefore welcome the decision\r\nto transfer at least 15 cases for trial in Rwanda. It is a\r\nwidely accepted principle that trials should always take\r\nplace as close as possible to where the crimes were\r\ncommitted. The crimes before the ICTR were\r\ncommitted in Rwanda. It is my Governments belief\r\nthat all trials targeted for transfer should take place in\r\nRwanda. This would address the problem of the impact\r\nof the ICTR on Rwanda and advance the cause of\r\njustice, while also combating impunity, as justice will\r\nnot only be done, but will also be seen to be done by\r\nRwandans in Rwanda. We also believe that a transfer\r\nof trials would promote national reconciliation and\r\nhealing.\r\nMy Government has taken the necessary\r\nmeasures to provide the international community its\r\nassurance that the death penalty will not be exercised\r\nin any of the transferred cases. I wish to renew this\r\ncommitment to the General Assembly and to state that\r\nthis issue should no longer impede progress in the\r\ntransfer process.\r\nIn view of the plans to transfer cases for\r\nprosecution by national jurisdictions, it is imperative\r\nthat the Tribunal take appropriate action to support and\r\nstrengthen Rwandas capacity-building efforts so that\r\nthe process can run smoothly. Capacity-building will\r\nalso ensure a sustainable legacy for the Tribunals\r\nwork. We therefore welcome the work of the Registry,\r\nas outlined in paragraphs 63 and 64 of the report, but\r\nwe encourage the Tribunal to intensify these efforts,\r\nparticularly through recruitment of Rwandan lawyers\r\nand through mentoring and attachment programmes.\r\nWe also believe that it is critical that sentences be\r\nserved inside Rwanda. This is another point that the\r\nRwanda Government has advocated since 1994. Both\r\ncommon sense and natural justice require that\r\nsentences be served where the crimes were committed.\r\nThis would also advance the cause of justice, combat\r\nimpunity and promote national reconciliation. We\r\nappeal to the Tribunal to speed up the process of\r\nadministering sentences in Rwanda, since the detention\r\nfacility that meets United Nations standards was\r\ncompleted more than a year ago.\r\nWe appeal to the Registry to be more imaginative\r\nin implementing its outreach programmes. A greater\r\neffort should be made to reach rural communities,\r\nwhere the impact of the genocide was the most\r\ndevastating. In this regard, a greater effort should also\r\nbe placed on working with local district authorities in\r\ndeveloping programmes that are suited to communities.\r\nFurther, we would like to put on record my\r\nGovernments appreciation to the leadership of the\r\nTribunal for the continued improvement in its\r\nperformance. We also commend the redeployment of\r\nthe witness management coordinator from Arusha to\r\nKigali to assist witnesses. We commend the\r\ninternational community for its support to the Tribunal,\r\nparticularly the Governments of Norway and the\r\nUnited Kingdom, which financed, through voluntary\r\ncontributions, the construction of a fourth courtroom\r\nthat was inaugurated in March of this year.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in this debate on this agenda item.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the General\r\nAssembly to conclude its consideration of agenda\r\nitems 76 and 77?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 5 p.m.\r\n"
