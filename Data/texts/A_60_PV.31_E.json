(Sweden)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.\r\nAgenda items 66 and 47\r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development:\r\nprogress in implementation and international\r\nsupport\r\n(a) New Partnership for Africa’s Development:\r\nprogress in implementation and international\r\nsupport\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/60/178)\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/60/85)\r\n(b) Causes of conflict and the promotion of durable\r\npeace and sustainable development in Africa\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/60/182)\r\n2001-2010: Decade to Roll Back Malaria in\r\nDeveloping Countries, Particularly in Africa\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/60/208)\r\nThe President: I regret the change of meeting\r\nplace. It seems as if nature is playing a role here,\r\nsending a message about the Capital Master Plan.\r\nToday the General Assembly will consider\r\nagenda items 66 and 47 in a joint debate.\r\nThe meeting of the General Assembly has been\r\ncalled to provide an opportunity for debate on two\r\nmatters, on the 2001-2010 Decade to Roll Back\r\nMalaria in Developing Countries, particularly in\r\nAfrica, and on progress in implementation and\r\ninternational support for the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD).\r\nOur deliberations are based on a number of\r\nhelpful papers from the Secretary-General, including\r\nthe report of his Advisory Panel on International\r\nSupport for NEPAD (see A/60/85). I particularly\r\ncommend the Panel for rooting its work in the realities\r\nof the lives of the poor. We should all bear in mind that\r\n“Success cannot be measured in the number of\r\nconsultations, meetings and plans alone” and “The\r\nlives of people must change as a result of African and\r\ninternational support for NEPAD”.\r\nOn malaria, there has been welcome progress in\r\nrecent years. First of all, the number of treated bed nets\r\ndistributed has increased massively during the past\r\nthree years, and tenfold in more than a dozen African\r\ncountries. That is a good example of aid working and\r\nof its making a very concrete difference in the lives of\r\nthe poor. Secondly, the first African factory producing\r\nlong-lasting bed nets opened in late 2004. Thirdly,\r\nsince 2001, 53 countries have begun using more\r\neffective malaria drugs, with support from World\r\nHealth Organization (WHO) and donors. In that\r\nconnection, there is a worldwide effort under way to\r\nensure that there are sufficient amounts of the raw\r\nmaterial available to meet growing demand. Fourthly,\r\n2\r\nA/60/PV.31\r\nthere has been increased political momentum behind\r\nthe international fight against malaria, not least\r\nbecause of leadership shown by African leaders.\r\nLastly, there have been a number of recent pledges to\r\nincrease bilateral and multilateral funding to tackle\r\nmalaria.\r\nBut the tragic fact remains that every 30 seconds\r\na child somewhere in Africa dies of malaria. Malaria\r\nremains the biggest killer of children under age five in\r\nAfrica. All this happens despite the fact that we know\r\nhow to prevent and treat malaria, and we know how to\r\ndo it cheaply. So, if we are to lift this unnecessary and\r\nunacceptable burden of disease from the world’s\r\npoorest, we need a strong partnership backed up by\r\nrenewed financial and political commitment.\r\nTurning to NEPAD, I believe 2005 has been a\r\nyear of increased momentum for the cause of\r\ndevelopment, and for Africa in particular. This was\r\nevident at the world summit, where leader after leader\r\nfrom all over the world stressed the importance of\r\ntackling poverty.\r\nAs a result of the various reports, commissions\r\nand summits throughout the year, real progress has\r\nbeen made. We now have a clearer sense than ever\r\nbefore of what needs to be done to achieve the\r\nMillennium Development Goals, and we must keep up\r\nthat momentum. But I also know that, particularly in\r\nmuch of sub-Saharan Africa, there must be a rapid\r\nacceleration of efforts if the goals are to be met.\r\nWe have seen some welcome new commitments,\r\nboth from developing countries and donors. The Group\r\nof Eight Summit in Gleneagles made substantial\r\ncommitments on aid volumes and debt. African Union\r\nleaders (AU), at their Summit meeting in Sirte, Libya,\r\nmade strong commitments on governance and on\r\ncreating an environment conducive to investment and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThanks in no small part to the African-owned\r\nagenda that NEPAD lays out, Africa is creating for\r\nitself a time of opportunity, the like of which we have\r\nnot seen for a generation. In 1998, 14 African countries\r\nwere in a state of armed conflict or strife. Now the\r\nnumber engaged in major conflict is down to three —\r\nstill three too many, of course. The African Union is\r\ntaking an ever more active role in peace and security.\r\nAnd there is no better signal of Africa’s determination\r\nto take responsibility for its development than the news\r\nthat 23 African countries have signed up with the\r\nAfrican Peer Review Mechanism, with AU leaders in\r\nSirte urging all member States to join as quickly as\r\npossible.\r\nHaving made this progress, there is now a\r\nfourfold challenge before us, in my view.\r\nFirst, we must ensure that the commitments made\r\nthis year are implemented. Implementation is a crucial\r\nword to the credibility of both this Organization and\r\nthe work we do in this Organization. I was pleased to\r\nlearn that the Africa Partnership Forum meeting in\r\nLondon on 4 and 5 October 2005 agreed that there\r\nshould be one Joint Action Plan covering both donor\r\nand African commitments, and that progress on the\r\nAction Plan would be reviewed each year beginning in\r\nOctober 2006.\r\nSecondly, the world must ensure that the final\r\nchallenge of 2005 is accomplished — namely,\r\nachieving an outcome in the trade talks in Hong Kong\r\nin December, which will advance the cause of\r\ndevelopment in Africa and beyond.\r\nThirdly, we must ensure that the momentum\r\ngenerated this year is maintained and built upon. All\r\nthose who have a role to play — African Governments\r\nand countries, regional organizations, donors, the\r\ninternational financial institutions, civil society, the\r\nprivate sector — must step up to the challenge. Here at\r\nthe United Nations, it simply will not do for us to say\r\nthat we have now “done development” at the World\r\nSummit, and that we will come back to it at another\r\nReview in five years’ time. We must keep development\r\nhigh on the General Assembly’s agenda this year.\r\nA top priority is to get the Peacebuilding\r\nCommission established by the end of the year, so that\r\nthe international community is able to give those\r\nAfrican States emerging from conflict the support they\r\ndeserve. You will also know that the President of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council, Ambassador Akram, has\r\nimportant plans on development, not least the special\r\nevent to be held later this month on the food crisis in\r\nAfrica.\r\nFourthly, you, as members of the General\r\nAssembly, must ensure that the world hears the full\r\nstory about what is happening in Africa. Yes, there are\r\nstill enormous unmet needs. HIV/AIDS and\r\ntuberculosis, alongside malaria, continue to take a\r\nmassive, deadly toll. There are too many Africans\r\nwhose lives are blighted by poverty, insecurity or a\r\n3\r\nA/60/PV.31\r\nlack of human dignity. But — and I stress this — we\r\nmust also avoid a sense of helplessness and despair\r\nabout Africa. The more you can get the message out\r\nabout the many good things you are doing to tackle\r\ncorruption, improve governance, attract investment and\r\nhelp your people lift themselves out of poverty, the\r\nstronger the chorus will be that demands that you get\r\nthe support you need and deserve.\r\nWe will now move on to the list of speakers. We\r\nhave an improvised podium here in this chamber.\r\nSpeakers will have to adapt the microphone to their\r\nheight.\r\nMr. Andjaba (Namibia): On behalf of the\r\nAfrican Group, I wish to express our deep appreciation\r\nto the Secretary-General for his third consolidated\r\nreport on progress in the implementation of and\r\ninternational support for the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD), as contained in\r\ndocument A/60/178, and his report on the causes of\r\nconflict and the promotion of durable peace and\r\nsustainable development in Africa, in document\r\nA/60/182. The two issues are inextricably linked\r\nbecause no meaningful development can take place in a\r\nsituation of violent conflict and insecurity. Therefore,\r\nwhile we welcome the fact that, at present, only three\r\nAfrican countries are engaged in major conflict, we\r\ncontinue to be deeply disturbed by the lingering civil\r\nstrife in other parts of Africa, which are causing death\r\nand destruction and laying waste vast swathes of\r\nproductive land on the continent. It is no source of joy\r\nto us that “most African countries enjoy relatively\r\nstable political conditions” (A/60/182, para. 4) under\r\ndemocratic Governments.\r\nIndeed, we want all African countries to enjoy\r\nfirmly rooted democratic governance under the rule of\r\nlaw, which alone can create the conditions conducive\r\nto the renaissance to which the continent has\r\ncommitted itself through the NEPAD initiative. The\r\nAfrican Group believes that the many challenges and\r\nthreats facing our continent demand a wider\r\nengagement from the international community as a\r\nwhole.\r\nAfrica recognizes that the consolidation of\r\ndevelopment will be hampered by internecine conflicts\r\nthat decimate populations, plunder precious natural\r\nresources and destroy already limited infrastructure.\r\nConsequently, the urgency to consolidate the necessary\r\nconditions for durable peace and development\r\nthroughout the African continent cannot be overstated.\r\nAs noted in the Secretary-General’s report under\r\nreference, the two major threats to durable peace and\r\nsustainable development in Africa are internal conflict\r\nincluding civil war, genocide and other large-scale\r\natrocities — and economic and social threats, including\r\npoverty, infectious diseases and environmental\r\ndegradation.\r\nWith regard to internal conflicts and other large-\r\nscale atrocities, the report of the Secretary-General is\r\nquite accurate in pointing out some of the crucial\r\nchallenges facing the security environment in Africa,\r\nsuch as illicit trafficking in small arms and light\r\nweapons, mercenaries, the illegal exploitation of\r\nnatural resources, youth unemployment, the problem of\r\nrefugees, and diseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria and\r\ntuberculosis.\r\nThe challenges are also enormous in maintaining\r\ninternational attention in areas where peace remains\r\nfragile unless sustained through a multidimensional\r\napproach to peace, thus minimizing the risk of relapse\r\ninto conflict. The African Group believes that the time\r\nis ripe for a structured cooperation between the African\r\nUnion (AU) and the United Nations in order to assist\r\nthe ongoing efforts to develop an African-led agenda\r\non post-conflict peacebuilding, addressing the nexus\r\nbetween security, development and the humanitarian\r\ndimensions of peace in Africa.\r\nTo that end, we note with satisfaction the\r\nstrengthening of the capacity of the AU to intervene\r\nand mediate in conflicts on the continent through the\r\nestablishment of the African Peace Facility, funded\r\ninitially by the European Union, to support AU peace\r\noperations and capacity-building. We also welcome the\r\nprovision by the G-8 countries of direct bilateral\r\ntechnical assistance and financial support to the AU, as\r\nwell as to some subregional organizations, such as the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States and the\r\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development, to\r\nsupport their conflict-prevention and crisis-\r\nmanagement efforts.\r\nThose laudable initiatives have been endorsed in\r\nthe 2005 summit outcome document. We firmly call for\r\nthe urgent and comprehensive implementation by all\r\nsides of the commitments made on conflict prevention,\r\npeacekeeping and post-conflict peacebuilding and\r\nreconstruction. It is our belief that the early\r\noperationalization of the peacebuilding commission\r\n4\r\nA/60/PV.31\r\nwould be helpful in post-conflict reconstruction in\r\nAfrica.\r\nThe elimination of economic and social threats to\r\ndurable peace and sustainable development in Africa is\r\nat the very heart of the NEPAD initiative. As stated in\r\nthe Secretary-General’s report, “NEPAD aims to\r\ngenerate broad-based and equitable growth that allows\r\nAfrica to reduce poverty and integrate better into the\r\nworld economy” (A/60/178, para. 5) — a task that is\r\ncomplex and painstaking.\r\nThe complex and painstaking nature of the\r\nprocess involved in turning NEPAD objectives into\r\npractical achievements comes through quite clearly in\r\nthe discussion of the various sectors of the NEPAD\r\nprogramme in the report of the Secretary-General.\r\nAfrican countries have made progress through the\r\nShort-term Action Plan in infrastructure development,\r\ncovering facilitation studies and investment and\r\ncapacity-building projects.\r\nIt is evident from the current report that lack of\r\ntechnical capacity is a major impediment that requires\r\nurgent, time-bound remedial measures to accelerate the\r\ncapacity-building programmes and thereby move the\r\ninfrastructure-building agenda forward. In that\r\nconnection, we call for the speedy implementation of\r\nthe commitment undertaken by the international\r\ncommunity in the 2005 summit outcome document to\r\nsupport the building of an international infrastructure\r\nconsortium involving the African Union, the World\r\nBank and the African Development Bank, with NEPAD\r\nas the main framework, to facilitate public and private\r\ninfrastructure investment in Africa.\r\nWe welcome the launching of the NEPAD\r\ne-schools demonstration project, which is a critical\r\nelement of the NEPAD e-schools initiative, and call for\r\nthe provision of more resources to expand the initiative\r\nto more African countries.\r\nWe share the view expressed in the report that\r\nmost of the elements of disease-based programmes in\r\nAfrica need a functional health service for effective\r\ndelivery. The lack of skilled human resources in the\r\nhealth sector in Africa is a very vexed question. On the\r\none hand, African Governments, constrained by limited\r\nresources, are unable to train adequate health workers,\r\nwhile on the other, the few that have been trained with\r\nscarce resources are leaving in large numbers to seek\r\nmore lucrative conditions abroad, thereby worsening\r\nan already bad situation. It is thus imperative to\r\nsupport the health systems in Africa.\r\nIt is encouraging to note that the articulation of\r\nthe road map for the implementation of the\r\nComprehensive Africa Agriculture Development\r\nProgramme was the most important development\r\nduring the year. In that regard, we note with\r\nappreciation the decision by our development partners,\r\nespecially the United States of America through its\r\nInitiative to End Hunger in Africa, to allocate\r\n$47 million for 2005, in support of the implementation\r\nof the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development\r\nProgramme. Our gratitude also goes to the Department\r\nfor International Development of the United Kingdom\r\nand the International Fund for Agricultural\r\nDevelopment for other initiatives in support of the\r\nProgramme.\r\nAfrican countries have committed themselves to\r\nthe promotion of democracy and good governance,\r\nincluding economic governance, as espoused by the\r\nAfrican leaders, including in the African Peer Review\r\nMechanism. We note that 23 countries have signed on\r\nto the African Peer Review Mechanism, and the Peer\r\nReview Panel has completed country reviews for\r\nGhana and Rwanda and presented its report to the\r\nAfrican Peer Review Forum in Abuja for discussion.\r\nWe commend all countries and institutions that have\r\ncontributed to the African Peer Review Mechanism\r\ntrust fund and call on the international community to\r\ncontinue providing financial resources and technical\r\nassistance to the process. The completion of the review\r\nprocess for countries that have signed up will give\r\nadded impetus to the African Peer Review Mechanism\r\nand may encourage other countries wishing to do so to\r\njoin the process.\r\nThe international community made an\r\nunequivocal commitment in the 2005 summit outcome\r\ndocument (resolution 60/1) to provide coherent support\r\nfor NEPAD programmes, including by mobilizing\r\ninternal and external financial resources and by\r\nfacilitating approval of such programmes by the\r\nmultilateral financial institutions. We hope that these\r\ncommitments will be speedily implemented in support\r\nof the continent’s development.\r\nConcerning official development assistance\r\n(ODA), we warmly welcome the recent decisions taken\r\nby our partners, including the G-8 and the European\r\nUnion, in support of Africa’s development efforts,\r\n5\r\nA/60/PV.31\r\nincluding commitments that will lead to an increase in\r\nODA to Africa of $25 billion per year by 2010, as part\r\nof the drive to achieve the Millennium Development\r\nGoals (MDGs) by 2015.\r\nWe wish, however, to re-emphasize the fact that\r\ndeclared pledges by themselves will not effect the\r\ndesired changes. Delivery of the pledged support\r\nthrough new and additional resources in a sustained,\r\neffective and timely manner is crucial in order not to\r\nhinder the pace of implementation of development\r\npriorities in Africa. We further call for the\r\nimplementation of the internationally agreed target of\r\n0.7 per cent of gross national income (GNI) to\r\ndeveloping countries, with 0.15 to 0.20 per cent of GNI\r\nto the least developed countries.\r\nIt is important that developed countries ensure\r\naid predictability and aid effectiveness through the\r\nimplementation of the Paris Declaration on Aid\r\nEffectiveness. Coordination of delivery of aid\r\nconsistent with national priorities will be essential for\r\nAfrica if it is to meet the MDGs by 2015. The same\r\napplies to budgetary support to facilitate the\r\nachievement of the MDGs.\r\nIn the 2005 summit outcome document, the\r\ninternational community also committed itself to\r\npromote a comprehensive and durable solution to the\r\nexternal debt problem of African countries, including\r\nthrough the cancellation of 100 per cent of multilateral\r\ndebt for highly indebted poor countries (HIPCs),\r\nconsistent with the G-8 proposal, and, on a case-by-\r\ncase basis, significant debt relief for heavily indebted\r\nnon-HIPC African countries which have unsustainable\r\ndebt burdens. We are, however, concerned that many\r\nAfrican countries remain burdened by debt, and we call\r\nfor urgent measures to address the debt crisis of those\r\ncountries.\r\nIn this regard, we are greatly encouraged by the\r\nagreement reached in Washington on 25 September\r\n2005 by the Development Committee and the\r\nInternational Monetary and Financial Committee of the\r\nBoard of Governors of the International Monetary\r\nFund to endorse the G-8 proposal to cancel 100 per\r\ncent of multilateral debt owed by 18 eligible HIPCs, 14\r\nof which are in Africa. We call for the speedy\r\nimplementation of that decision, as well as for a clear\r\nframework of implementation from the African\r\nDevelopment Bank. We recognize that the agreement\r\ndoes not cover bilateral debt and debt owed to other\r\nmultilateral credit institutions, and we call for\r\nmeasures to address those issues in order to address the\r\ndebt burden in Africa comprehensively.\r\nAs rightly stated in the Secretary-General’s report\r\n(A/60/178), while debt relief and increased ODA\r\ncoupled with policy reforms are important to meeting\r\nAfrica’s needs in the short to medium term, equitable\r\ntrade holds the key to its long-term growth and\r\ndevelopment. And yet it is in this area that the least\r\nprogress has been made. Much lip service has been\r\npaid by the world community to trade liberalization\r\nand expeditious work towards implementing the\r\ndevelopment dimensions of the Doha Work Programme\r\nand to integrating African countries fully into the\r\ninternational trading system.\r\nAs we approach the Hong Kong Ministerial\r\nConference of the World Trade Organization (WTO),\r\nscheduled for December of this year, we call on all\r\nWTO members, particularly the industrialized\r\ncountries, to show leadership and the much-needed\r\npolitical will to move the development agenda forward.\r\nFair trade, as argued in the report, not only requires\r\nmarket access, but also the strengthening of the\r\ncapacity of African countries to export. In this\r\nconnection, we endorse the recommendation that\r\ninitiatives such as the trade-for-aid agenda, aimed at\r\nbuilding Africa’s capacity to compete in international\r\ntrade, should be promoted and expanded.\r\nWe recognize the potential of South-South\r\ncooperation in promoting economic growth and\r\ndevelopment. The challenge, however, is to translate\r\nthis potential into practical activities and programmes\r\nthat can yield results within specific time frames,\r\nincluding through the implementation of initiatives\r\nsuch as the Tokyo International Conference on African\r\nDevelopment-NEPAD Joint Policy Framework for the\r\nPromotion of Trade and Investment between Africa and\r\nAsia and the New Asian-African Strategic Partnership.\r\nHowever, we remain of the view that South-South\r\ncooperation should complement and not replace North-\r\nSouth cooperation.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report notes that the\r\nUnited Nations system, through its funds, programmes\r\nand specialized agencies, has been in the forefront of\r\nthe advocacy and harnessing of international support\r\nfor Africa’s development efforts in general and NEPAD\r\nin particular. We call on the United Nations funds,\r\nprogrammes and specialized agencies to further\r\n6\r\nA/60/PV.31\r\nimprove the coordination of their support for NEPAD\r\nand the achievement of the MDGs in order to avoid\r\nduplication of activities and to maximize the use of\r\navailable resources. As we embark on the\r\nimplementation phase of the summit outcome, we look\r\nto the United Nations system to continue to offer its\r\ninvaluable institutional support to the NEPAD\r\nprogramme, the African Union and individual African\r\ncountries, as together we pursue the challenging goal\r\nof development in Africa.\r\nTo conclude, the African Group wishes to stress\r\nthe importance of mutual accountability in the\r\npartnership for development that Africa is striving to\r\nestablish with the international community, as\r\nrecognized in the collaborative work done by the\r\nEconomic Commission for Africa and the Organization\r\nfor Economic Cooperation and Development on the\r\nmutual review of aid effectiveness in Africa. We share\r\nthe view expressed in the biennial report issued by\r\nthose two institutions that, at a time when large\r\nincreases in aid to Africa are contemplated, both\r\ndonors’ and recipient African countries’ systems for aid\r\ndelivery and management should be strengthened. The\r\nAfrican Group is convinced that mutual accountability\r\nwill ensure improved development performance and\r\nsustained aid increases.\r\nMr. Thomson (United Kingdom): I have the\r\nhonour to speak on behalf of the 25 European Union\r\nmember States. Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey, Croatia,\r\nAlbania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the former Yugoslav\r\nRepublic of Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro,\r\nUkraine and the Republic of Moldova align themselves\r\nwith this statement.\r\nFirst of all, I am speaking personally but I think I\r\nspeak for my European Union colleagues as well. I\r\nwelcome your introductory statement to this debate,\r\nMr. President, and in particular the four points you\r\nunderlined: the importance of implementing of the\r\ncommitments made this year, the importance of\r\nbuilding on the momentum achieved this year, the\r\nimportance of relaying to the world the full story of\r\nAfrica and the importance of the outcome of the Hong\r\nKong trade talks, to which I shall turn in a moment.\r\nOn all these points, the European Union (EU) is\r\ncommitted to playing a leading role in helping to meet\r\nthe special needs of Africa. I want to use the debate\r\nthis morning to identify some of the ways in which the\r\nEuropean Union hopes that the African development\r\nagenda can be taken forward over the coming months\r\nand implemented.\r\nThe 2005 World Summit outcome document\r\nunderlines the commitment of the global community to\r\nthe achievement of the Millennium Development Goals\r\n(MDGs). It also provides the Africa Partnership Forum\r\nwith the principles of a joint framework to ensure\r\ndelivery of international and African commitments to\r\nthe continent. These advances represent a partnership\r\nbetween all of us. And both of these developments\r\nprovide us with a substantive basis on which to build\r\nfurther, including by creating an environment\r\nconducive to the development of the whole African\r\ncontinent. As our heads of State and Government\r\nagreed, peace and security, development and human\r\nrights are interlinked and mutually reinforcing.\r\nAs I said, I want to start with trade, a powerful\r\nengine for development and for achieving the MDGs.\r\nThe European Union looks forward to working closely\r\nwith partners towards success in the Doha\r\nDevelopment Agenda, in particular in the run-up to the\r\ncrucial WTO Ministerial Meeting in Hong Kong in\r\nDecember. We believe that it will be possible — and\r\ncrucial — for substantial progress to be made in Hong\r\nKong so as to bring the Doha Round to an early and\r\nsuccessful conclusion in all areas of negotiation. With\r\na comprehensive, pro-development agenda —\r\ncombining trade liberalization with rule-making and\r\ncomplementary aid for trade and trade-related\r\nassistance — the Doha Round can bring benefits to all\r\ntrading partners and in particular to developing\r\ncountries. We also believe that it is important to make\r\nprogress in the area of regional integration, which\r\naccounts for a substantial element of the income\r\ngenerated by trade.\r\nPreferential market access remains important, in\r\nparticular for the poorest countries, many of which are\r\nin Africa. The European Union market remains the\r\nmost open, and the most important, for developing-\r\ncountry exports globally. Since 2001, our Everything\r\nBut Arms scheme has provided duty-free and quota-\r\nfree market access to all least developed countries\r\nexports. And the Cotonou Agreement provides\r\npreferential market access to the European Union by\r\nAfrican, Caribbean and Pacific countries. Since 1980,\r\ntrade between the European Union and developing\r\ncountries has more than tripled and one fifth of all\r\ndeveloping country exports now go to the European\r\nUnion. As much as 97 per cent of African, Caribbean\r\n7\r\nA/60/PV.31\r\nand Pacific countries’ exports to the European Union\r\nenter duty free, and tariff escalation is virtually non-\r\nexistent.\r\nBut as the previous speaker, the Ambassador of\r\nNamibia, has just reminded us, Africa also needs\r\ngreater support for trade capacity-building in order to\r\nmaximize the opportunities created. The European\r\nUnion is already the world’s biggest provider of trade-\r\nrelated assistance. To help developing countries fully\r\nexploit market access opportunities, the European\r\nCommunity this summer pledged to increase such\r\nassistance to 1 billion euros per year.\r\nLet me turn to aid now. The European Union\r\ncurrently provides almost half of all the money spent to\r\nhelp developing countries. As part of a comprehensive\r\napproach to our international assistance, the European\r\nUnion is committed to providing more and better aid,\r\nmultilateral debt relief and complementary innovative\r\nsources of finance in order to help meet the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. At present, four out\r\nof the five countries that exceed the United Nations\r\ntarget for official development assistance (ODA) of\r\n0.7 per cent of GNP are members of the European\r\nUnion. In June of this year, as the representative of\r\nNamibia recalled, the European Union adopted a new\r\ncollective target of 0.56 per cent by 2010 and an\r\nundertaking to achieve a 0.7 per cent target by 2015,\r\nwith a 0.33 per cent target for European Union member\r\nStates who joined the Union after 2002. This landmark\r\nagreement should double European Union aid from\r\ncurrent levels to over $80 billion by 2010. At least half\r\nof this aid will go to Africa.\r\nTo ensure that this huge increase in funds is used\r\neffectively, the European Council will agree to a new\r\nAfrica strategy by December of this year. This will be a\r\nstrategy of the whole European Union: the Union, its\r\ninstitutions and the member States. It will apply to the\r\nwhole of Africa, not just to Africa south of the Sahara.\r\nThe primary aim will be the achievement of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals right across Africa. It\r\nwill encompass development, security and human\r\nrights. It will be based on the principles of African\r\nownership, equality and mutual accountability. And it\r\nwill launch a new European Union/Africa strategic\r\npartnership, setting the course of the relationship for\r\nthe long term.\r\nIn order to deliver a better deal for the citizens of\r\nAfrica, a key theme of this strategy will be support and\r\nhelp to develop strong African institutions. This will\r\ninclude a package of financial and practical help to\r\nbuild the capacity of the African Union, the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) and\r\nAfrica’s subregional and national institutions.\r\nIn particular, we support the African Peer Review\r\nMechanism and its Secretariat Trust Fund, enabling\r\nAfrican States to monitor each other’s performance.\r\nWe hope to see this process moving forward in 2006.\r\nWe are providing European Union electoral\r\nobservation missions to monitor elections in Africa and\r\nto help promote the adoption of ever-better electoral\r\nstandards and practice. We will support the African\r\nUnion in its endeavours to strengthen better\r\ngovernance, regional integration and poverty reduction\r\nin Africa through its economic and social programmes,\r\nincluding NEPAD. We will support efforts to enhance\r\nthe capacity of the African Union and regional\r\neconomic communities by providing programme\r\nsupport, in cooperation with other donors. We will\r\nwork to promote and protect all human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms by strengthening European\r\nUnion/African cooperation within the international\r\nhuman rights system and by supporting the machinery\r\nfor the protection of human rights. We will work for\r\nimplementation of the rule of law, as a basis for respect\r\nfor human rights, democracy and development, by\r\nproviding support for institution-building.\r\nFurthermore, in order to ensure that Africa’s\r\nwealth benefits its people, the European Union will\r\ncontinue to support, both politically and financially,\r\nAfrican States that tackle corruption. The European\r\nUnion-Africa Strategy will ensure that aid will flow\r\nincreasingly towards well-governed countries, while\r\npaying attention to all vulnerable States. And all EU\r\nmember States will commit to early ratification of the\r\nUnited Nations Convention against Corruption and to\r\nthe enactment of laws to return stolen assets.\r\nHIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria account for\r\n6 million deaths each year in the developing world.\r\nThis morning, you yourself, Mr. President, powerfully\r\nunderlined the impact of malaria in particular. We must\r\nall work urgently to address the impact of those major\r\ncommunicable diseases through strengthened health\r\nsystems that facilitate an integrated approach of\r\nprevention, treatment, care and research. All these\r\nrequire greater resources if Africa is to achieve the\r\nMDGs. The EU Programme for Action, announced\r\nearlier this year, outlines our future strategy for\r\n8\r\nA/60/PV.31\r\ncombating HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. We\r\nare committed to the goal of universal access to\r\nprevention, treatment and care by 2010.\r\nThe European Union is a major contributor to the\r\ndevelopment and effective implementation of\r\nevidence-based malaria control programmes and to\r\nwork on increasing the affordability of antimalarial\r\nmedicines. The EU is supporting research for better\r\nmalaria drugs and an effective vaccine. Some EU\r\nmember States are currently working with partners to\r\ndevelop an advance market commitment for a malaria\r\nvaccine. And the EU is a strong supporter of the Roll\r\nBack Malaria Partnership and of the work of the World\r\nHealth Organization, both of which are vital to scaling\r\nup the international response to malaria.\r\nEuropean Union member States and the European\r\nCommission were founding members of the Global\r\nFund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. To\r\ndate, we have pledged $4.5 billion — more than half of\r\nall the money pledged to the Fund. Almost two thirds\r\nof the Fund’s money goes to sub-Saharan Africa.\r\nOur Namibian colleague reminded us that\r\nmeaningful development cannot take place in an\r\nenvironment of violence and insecurity. The European\r\nUnion welcomes African resolve to tackle the problems\r\nof insecurity and instability on the continent. Over the\r\npast few years, the African Union has sought to\r\ntransform and develop the African security architecture\r\nthrough the establishment of its Peace and Security\r\nCouncil, and plans for a panel of the wise and a\r\ncontinental early-warning system, as well as through\r\nprogress towards an African standby force. That\r\ncommitment was reinforced at the African Union\r\nsummit in Sirte this year, where leaders committed, as\r\nmembers will recall, to:\r\n“addressing conflict and political instability on\r\nthe continent, with the aim of achieving a\r\nconflict-free Africa by 2010 by prioritizing and\r\nallocating more resources to conflict prevention\r\nand post-conflict reconstruction and\r\npeacebuilding ...”\r\nThe European Union is fully committed to those\r\nefforts and to playing a full part in the 10-year plan for\r\ncapacity-building with the African Union that was\r\ncalled for by the world summit just a few weeks ago.\r\nThe European Union will continue its dialogue with the\r\nAfrican Union with a view to establishing institutional\r\nlinkages and defining a comprehensive operational\r\nagenda, particularly on peace and security. In that\r\ncontext, the timely holding of a second EU-Africa\r\nsummit, as foreseen in the Cairo Declaration, remains\r\nan important objective of the EU-Africa dialogue. The\r\nEuropean Union also welcomes commitments made by\r\nthe Group of Eight to support African capacities for\r\npeace and security.\r\nOne of the European Union’s main tools for\r\nsupporting African efforts in peace and security is the\r\nAfrican Peace Facility, a €250 million instrument to\r\nfinance African-led peace support operations in Africa.\r\nIt is operated and staffed by Africans, and it will help\r\nto build longer-term capacity in the African Union and\r\nin subregional African institutions to prevent, manage\r\nand resolve crises. So far, the Peace Facility has\r\nsupported the African Union leadership in Darfur by\r\nproviding more than €92 million to the African Union\r\nMission in the Sudan. The European Union has also\r\nprovided €6 million to the African Union’s Peace and\r\nSecurity Department for its capacity-building plans.\r\nAnd we are currently considering how we might\r\ncontinue to provide support to African-led missions in\r\nthe future through the African Peace Facility.\r\nBut, of course, the partnership between the\r\nEuropean Union and the African Union on peace and\r\nsecurity should not be only about money. In the future,\r\nthe EU and the AU also hope to increase cooperation in\r\nareas such as planning and management capacity and\r\ninformation-sharing on doctrine and standards and\r\nlogistical support. In that context, it is worth noting the\r\nEuropean Union’s support for the Sudan and the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo in the framework of\r\nthe European Security and Defence Policy. The EU\r\nwill also continue working with African and other\r\ninternational partners to check the flow of unregulated\r\narms on the continent. In addition, there is a need to\r\nensure that European Union and African Union\r\ncapacities can coordinate and mesh with the capacities\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nIt would not be right to end my statement,\r\nMr. President, without underlining the importance of\r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission; you have done so\r\nyourself. For Africa and Europe, the Peacebuilding\r\nCommission is one of the biggest prizes to come out of\r\nthe summit and a major priority. The experience of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council’s ad hoc advisory groups\r\non African countries emerging from conflict has\r\ndemonstrated the central role that post-conflict\r\npeacebuilding plays in ensuring a smooth transition to\r\n9\r\nA/60/PV.31\r\nstability and development. For too long, the\r\ninternational community’s efforts at peacebuilding, in\r\nAfrica as elsewhere, have been marked by piecemeal\r\nand uncoordinated interventions that often lack\r\nnational ownership. The result is the famous statistic\r\nthat approximately half of post-conflict countries\r\nrelapse into conflict within a decade. We have a moral,\r\npolitical and economic duty to improve our approach\r\nand to help those countries establish a lasting,\r\nsustainable peace.\r\nThe Peacebuilding Commission will be the forum\r\nfor all relevant actors in peacebuilding, so that\r\ncoordination and delivery can be genuinely improved.\r\nIt will keep the political spotlight on fragile countries\r\nas they make the transition to development, and it will\r\nbe a means to help mobilize sustained funding for\r\npeacebuilding. We must push forward and agree on the\r\nmodalities of the Peacebuilding Commission quickly\r\nso that it can be ready to work by 31 December 2005,\r\nas we pledged at the summit. We must do this, not least\r\nfor Africa’s sake.\r\nMore generally, the whole United Nations system\r\nshould play an important role in supporting African\r\ndevelopment to achieve the MDGs and to create\r\nsecurity and sustainability throughout the continent.\r\nThat includes agency work at the country level as well\r\nas the activities of the principal organs, including the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council. A\r\nreformed Economic and Social Council also has an\r\nimportant role to play, particularly in promoting and\r\nmonitoring the implementation of internationally\r\nagreed development goals, including the MDGs.\r\nThe European Union is proud of its record of\r\npartnership with Africa. We will continue to work\r\ntirelessly with our friends and partners to achieve the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. We remain convinced\r\nthat the MDGs, while ambitious, are achievable. We\r\nare putting in place both the resources and the strategy\r\nneeded to realize that ambition and we look forward to\r\nthe day when this challenge is met right across the\r\nAfrican continent.\r\nMr. Neil (Jamaica): I would like, on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China, to thank you Mr. President, for\r\nyour opening statement this morning, which has set the\r\ntone and established the focus for this debate.\r\nI would also like to thank the Secretary-General\r\nfor his third consolidated report on progress in\r\nimplementation of and international support for the\r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD),\r\ncontained in document A/60/178. For the Group of 77\r\nand China, the discussion this morning is a necessary\r\ncontinuation of the focus this year on the special needs\r\nof Africa. These are critical times for the people of the\r\ncontinent, but we are seeing signs of hope.\r\nSeveral reports considered during the course of\r\nthis year, in particular the Millennium Project report\r\nand the report of the Commission for Africa, focused\r\non ways to generate new momentum for development\r\nin Africa. Important decisions have been taken and\r\nspecific commitments made to mobilize resources for\r\nAfrica’s development. If those are pursued and\r\nfulfilled, the prospects for the future will be brighter.\r\nWe can see from the Secretary-General’s report\r\nthat there have been positive developments in the\r\nimplementation of NEPAD. The report provides\r\ndetailed examples of the progress made in the areas of\r\nagriculture, health, education, infrastructure and\r\ninformation and communications technology. We are\r\nconvinced that there is great scope for building on\r\nthose gains.\r\nProgress continues to be constrained, however, by\r\nseveral factors. The first concerns the issue of\r\nresources. The needs are substantial for the building of\r\nthe social and economic infrastructure. For example,\r\nparagraph 15 of the Secretary-General’s report draws\r\nattention to the lack of skilled human resources in the\r\nhealth sector and the particular challenge that that\r\nposes for African countries, where health professionals\r\nare leaving for better opportunities in developed\r\ncountries. The solution to that ever-growing problem\r\nrequires coordinated action on the part of both the\r\nAfrican and the recipient States.\r\nSimilarly, in view of the devastating impact of\r\nHIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis on the socio-\r\neconomic development of the continent, substantial\r\nresources are needed to support efforts to respond\r\neffectively to those pandemics. The 2005 World\r\nSummit Outcome reaffirms some important avenues\r\nthrough which that can be advanced so as to ensure\r\nincreased bilateral and multilateral assistance to\r\nstrengthen African health systems. We continue to call\r\nfor a more affordable and accessible supply of drugs to\r\nbe made available to Africa.\r\nWith respect to official development assistance\r\n(ODA), the trend has been towards an increase in the\r\nvolume of ODA to Africa since 2002. The recent\r\n10\r\nA/60/PV.31\r\nEuropean Union (EU) commitment to establishing\r\ntimetables to meet the target of 0.7 per cent target of\r\ngross national income for ODA to developing countries\r\nand to the doubling of aid to Africa by 2010 are\r\npositive developments, which we welcome. There is,\r\nhowever, still cause for concern. Paragraph 38 of the\r\nSecretary-General’s report identifies the need for more\r\nresources to be channelled to the leading programmes\r\nand sectors of NEPAD and for greater attention to be\r\ngiven to increasing budgetary support for development.\r\nContinuing efforts to improve the quality and\r\neffectiveness of aid are also needed, with the full\r\ninvolvement of both donor and recipient countries.\r\nAnother area requiring special attention is that of\r\nforeign direct investment (FDI) flows to Africa.\r\nDespite increases in FDI globally from $15 billion in\r\n2003 to $20 billion in 2004, Africa’s share in global\r\nforeign direct investment flows remains only 3 per\r\ncent. We believe that there is a need for more creative\r\ninitiatives and greater efforts in capacity-building and\r\ninfrastructural development in order to increase FDI to\r\nAfrican countries. We look forward to good results\r\nfrom the ongoing discussion on the proposal to create\r\nan investment climate facility for Africa, which has\r\nbeen endorsed by the NEPAD secretariat and major\r\nmultilateral and bilateral donor agencies.\r\nOn debt, the position of the Group of 77 and\r\nChina is well known. Debt-relief initiatives should be\r\nadditional to ODA resources for development purposes\r\nand should be all-encompassing, so that all heavily\r\nindebted developing countries can benefit\r\nappropriately.\r\nWith respect to trade, the forthcoming World\r\nTrade Organization Ministerial Meeting provides an\r\nimportant opportunity for significant decisions to be\r\ntaken to reform the world trading system so as to\r\nprovide better opportunities for trade to contribute to\r\nAfrica’s long-term growth and development. We expect\r\nevery effort to be made so that the development\r\ndimensions of the Doha work programme can be truly\r\nrealized.\r\nWith regard to the role of the United Nations,\r\nparagraph 56 of the Secretary-General’s report\r\ncorrectly points to the need for greater coordination\r\nwithin the United Nations system in supporting the\r\nimplementation of NEPAD. That is one area in which\r\ngreater efforts will have to be made. We therefore\r\nsupport the proposals advanced to improve\r\ncoordination between the United Nations and the\r\nAfrican Union in order to enhance collaboration and\r\ncoherence within the United Nations system in support\r\nof NEPAD.\r\nOur commitments made in support of NEPAD\r\nshould be honoured. The report identifies this as one of\r\nthe major challenges in ensuring the timely and\r\neffective implementation of NEPAD in a manner which\r\nwill generate significant results for Africa. In the\r\nprocess, we particularly wish to caution against the\r\nimposition of restrictive conditionalities in economic\r\ncooperation programmes. The design of such\r\nprogrammes should be in accordance with the priorities\r\nand strategies determined by each State, and suitably\r\nadapted to each particular institutional and cultural\r\nenvironment. It is important that those are applied on\r\nthe basis of national ownership in order for maximum\r\nbenefit to flow in the process of implementation.\r\nThe President: I would like to say once again\r\nthat I regret that we have had to make provisional\r\narrangements to hold our meeting in this chamber. If\r\nrepresentatives prefer to speak from their seats, they\r\nmay do so; I leave it up to them to choose. This is\r\nbecause of the weather conditions and the obvious need\r\nfor the United Nations building to be refurbished. I ask\r\nfor the understanding of members.\r\nMr. Talbot (Guyana): I would like to join\r\nprevious speakers in thanking you, Mr. President, for\r\nyour thoughtful statement at the beginning of our\r\ndebate. It will serve as a useful reference point in our\r\ndeliberations.\r\nI am especially honoured to speak in today’s\r\ndebate on the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) on behalf of the States\r\nmembers of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM).\r\nCARICOM aligns itself fully with the statement just\r\ndelivered by the Permanent Representative of Jamaica\r\non behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nCARICOM views the adoption of the New\r\nPartnership as a reflection of Africa’s determination to\r\nharness its own resources to extricate its people from\r\npoverty, underdevelopment and marginalization. We\r\nare convinced that the Partnership offers a viable and\r\nauthoritative framework not only for the mobilization\r\nof efforts by Africans themselves, but also for the\r\nmobilization of effective support on the part of the\r\ninternational community.\r\n11\r\nA/60/PV.31\r\nCARICOM member States are heartened by the\r\nleadership that African countries have shown both in\r\nlaying the foundations for long-term development and\r\nin creating conditions for durable peace and security in\r\nthat continent. The African Union (AU) has been a\r\npositive force for change on the continent and has been\r\na credible partner to the international community in\r\npromoting the aspirations of human progress\r\nworldwide.\r\nWe follow with great interest the creative efforts\r\nof the AU in the development of new institutional\r\narrangements to accelerate integration in the continent\r\nand to enable Africa to play its rightful role in the\r\nworld. We share a common commitment with the AU\r\nto good governance in managing the affairs of our\r\npeoples. Those efforts, in our view, deserve the\r\nunstinting support of the international community.\r\nCARICOM congratulates the African Union on its\r\nachievements and pledges its continued support and\r\ncooperation in that regard.\r\nThe long-standing ties of solidarity and\r\ncooperation between Africa and the Caribbean received\r\na welcome boost by the decision of the African Union\r\nto include its diaspora as the sixth region and to\r\ninvolve the representatives of the Caribbean diaspora\r\nin deliberations in the Economic, Social and Cultural\r\nCouncil and the civil society advisory group. Pursuant\r\nto that decision, during March of this year the\r\nGovernments of Jamaica and South Africa co-\r\nsponsored a conference under the theme “Towards\r\nunity and united action by Africans and the African\r\ndiaspora in the Caribbean for a better world”. The\r\nconference, which was attended by all CARICOM\r\nmember States, with representatives from both the\r\npublic sector and civil society, recommended the\r\nfurther development of a concrete mechanism for the\r\ninstitutionalization of the relationships between the AU\r\nand CARICOM, identified specific areas for\r\ncollaboration and the building of linkages between\r\ncountries in Africa and the Caribbean, called for\r\ncollaboration among civil society, and agreed that\r\nCARICOM and the AU would explore ways to harness\r\ninternational diplomacy to promote our mutual\r\nobjectives in the United Nations and the World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO). The outcome of the conference\r\nreceived the endorsement of CARICOM heads at their\r\ntwenty-sixth annual meeting, held earlier this year in\r\nSaint Lucia, marking the beginning of a promising new\r\nchapter in the relations between our two regions at all\r\nlevels.\r\nLet me now comment briefly on the third\r\nconsolidated report on progress in implementation of\r\nand international support for the New Partnership, as\r\ncontained in document A/60/178. The report, in our\r\nview, provides a hopeful overview of developments\r\nover the past year. It notes that 2005 has been marked\r\nby important regional actions and greater international\r\nresponse in support of Africa’s development.\r\nCARICOM welcomes the promising developments on\r\nthe continent in certain sectoral areas, such as\r\ninfrastructure, information and communication\r\ntechnology, health, education, environment and\r\ntourism, and agriculture, led by African countries and\r\norganizations. In respect of agriculture, the elaboration\r\nof the road map for the Comprehensive Africa\r\nAgriculture Development Programme, acknowledged\r\nas the most important development in that area over the\r\npast year, harbours the potential for the promotion of a\r\n“green revolution” on the continent and the\r\nstrengthening of the underpinnings of its long-term\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThose encouraging achievements\r\nnotwithstanding, many obstacles stand in the way of\r\nthe attainment of NEPAD objectives and of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals on the continent. The\r\nreport calls attention to a number of the many\r\nchallenges and constraints that continue to beset the\r\nimplementation of the New Partnership. The\r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic, along with other communicable\r\ndiseases, is still taking a heavy toll on the human\r\ncapital and the social and economic infrastructure of\r\nAfrica. Africa’s heavy debt burden remains a major\r\ndrain on its development potential. The continent lacks\r\nthe financial resources needed to generate the requisite\r\nlevels of growth to reduce poverty. Africa’s share of\r\nglobal trade continues to be marginal, and while the\r\nregion has recently witnessed positive developments in\r\nattracting foreign direct investment, those gains need to\r\nbe consolidated through a facilitative international\r\nframework of support for efforts on the continent to\r\ncreate an environment conducive to investment.\r\nThat state of affairs represents a major challenge\r\nnot only for Africa, but for the international\r\ncommunity as a whole. It underlines the critical\r\nimportance of a long-term engagement on the part both\r\nof Africa and of its development partners in order to\r\nassure the full realization of the objectives of NEPAD.\r\n12\r\nA/60/PV.31\r\nRecent initiatives by the international community\r\noffer hope that such an engagement can indeed\r\nmaterialize, to the mutual benefit of Africa and its\r\ndevelopment partners. We welcome the recent G-8\r\nAfrica Action Plan, which promises debt relief,\r\nincreased aid flows, a commitment to improving global\r\nmarket access for African exports, and an agreement to\r\nprovide medical assistance to the continent.\r\nCommitments made by developed partners to achieve\r\nthe 0.7 per cent official development assistance target\r\nby 2015 are also welcome. We remain hopeful that\r\nthose commitments will be implemented with due\r\ndispatch.\r\nWe note, however, that even as those measures\r\nare put into effect, there are developments in a number\r\nof areas, such as the marketing of commodities,\r\nincluding sugar and cotton, which may negatively\r\nimpact the future of many countries both in Africa and\r\nthe Caribbean. We therefore call for renewed\r\ninternational attention to the need for coherence in\r\ndevelopment, trade and finance policies to avert the\r\nerosion of development gains and the aggravation of\r\npoverty in developing countries. We also look to the\r\nWTO meeting in Hong Kong as an important test of the\r\ncommitment to placing development at the heart of\r\nmultilateral trade negotiations.\r\nIn the final analysis, while the primary\r\nresponsibility for the promotion of durable peace and\r\nsustainable development in Africa rests with Africans\r\nthemselves, the fortunes of the continent will depend\r\nnot only on the actions of Africans, but also on the\r\nactions of the international community, which have the\r\npotential either to support or to undermine the gains\r\nmade in recent years. The 2005 world summit outcome\r\nhas pledged the international community to coherent\r\nsupport for NEPAD implementation and to specific\r\nmeasures in favour of African countries. The\r\nimplementation of those commitments must now\r\nengage our urgent attention.\r\nFor its part, CARICOM, linked to Africa by\r\nfraternal ties and solidarity in historic struggles,\r\nremains committed to playing a positive and\r\nconstructive role in support of the aspirations\r\nembodied in the New Partnership.\r\nMr. Maema (Lesotho): I have the honour to\r\nspeak on behalf of the members of the Southern\r\nAfrican Development Community (SADC): Angola,\r\nBotswana, the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\r\nLesotho, Madagascar, Mauritius, Malawi,\r\nMozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, the\r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.\r\nAt the outset, we wish to congratulate you, Sir, on\r\nyour election to preside over the General Assembly at\r\nits sixtieth session. We are confident that your vast\r\nexperience and able leadership will lead us to a\r\nsuccessful session. SADC pledges its support and\r\ncooperation. SADC fully aligns itself with the\r\nstatement made by Namibia on behalf of the African\r\nGroup, which outlines the significant strides Africa, in\r\npartnership with the international community, is\r\nmaking in the implementation of the New Partnership\r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD).\r\nSADC welcomes the Secretary General’s third\r\nconsolidated report on progress in implementation of\r\nand international support for NEPAD, in document\r\nA/60/178, as well as the report on the causes of\r\nconflict and promotion of durable peace and\r\nsustainable development in Africa, in document\r\nA/60/182. Both reports highlight the progress made so\r\nfar towards realizing Africa’s aspirations to eradicating\r\npoverty and attaining sustained economic growth,\r\nsustainable development and durable peace. Perhaps\r\nmore importantly, the reports call for more concerted\r\ninternational efforts to address the growing challenges\r\nand constraints that continue to undermine\r\ndevelopment in Africa.\r\nFour years ago, Africa adopted NEPAD as a\r\nregional policy framework to guide the continent in its\r\nquest for economic prosperity and stability. NEPAD is\r\nanchored in the fundamental principles of African\r\nownership, leadership and accountability, as well as\r\ngood governance and the maintenance of peace and\r\nsecurity. NEPAD envisages a strong partnership with\r\nthe international community built on mutual goodwill,\r\nrespect and solidarity, a programme which this body\r\nhas recognized as a framework through which the\r\ninternational community should assist Africa.\r\nWe recognized then, as we do today, that national\r\nGovernments and regional economic communities have\r\ncritical roles to play in the realization and\r\nimplementation of the NEPAD initiative. In that\r\nrespect, allow me to highlight the efforts that SADC is\r\nmaking to harmonize its development priorities with\r\nNEPAD through the Regional Indicative Strategic\r\nDevelopment Plan (RISDP), particularly in the areas of\r\nthe Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development\r\n13\r\nA/60/PV.31\r\nProgramme (CAADP) and the environment; education\r\nand health; science and technology; infrastructure\r\ndevelopment and tourism; resource mobilization,\r\ncapacity-building, gender mainstreaming and civil\r\nsociety participation; and democracy, peace, security\r\nand governance. To that end, priority has been\r\naccorded to the harmonization of policies and\r\ncoordination of the implementation of key programmes\r\nin the area of social and human development, in line\r\nwith RISDP, the Millennium Development Goals, and,\r\nindeed, NEPAD.\r\nFurthermore, since 2004, the SADC and NEPAD\r\nsecretariats have scaled up their coordination of and\r\nparticipation in NEPAD-related development activities\r\nand their mobilization of resources to expedite the\r\nimplementation of projects. That relationship will no\r\ndoubt go a long way towards contributing to greater\r\ncoherence and synchronization of priorities and plans,\r\nas well as enabling the possibility of sharing expertise\r\nand resources in critical areas.\r\nSADC has a common agenda geared towards the\r\npromotion and attainment of sustainable development,\r\npeace, stability and democracy. We have long\r\nrecognized that good political, economic and corporate\r\ngovernance is an essential prerequisite of sustainable\r\ndevelopment. In that regard, we are pleased to note that\r\nhalf of the SADC member States have acceded to the\r\nAfrican Peer Review Mechanism. Those are important\r\ntenets to which both SADC and NEPAD fully\r\nsubscribe.\r\nSADC will therefore continue to strive to\r\npromote strong synergies between its development\r\nprogrammes and NEPAD by working together and\r\npursuing projects that will have direct economic and\r\nsocial benefits for SADC countries; contribute to\r\npoverty eradication and human development; have\r\neconomy-of-scale gains where regionally coordinated\r\ninvestments or operations will result in substantial cost\r\nsavings and employment benefits; unlock the economic\r\npotential of less developed areas and countries to\r\npromote balanced and equitable development;\r\ncontribute to SADC’s integration into the regional,\r\ncontinental and global economy; contribute to market\r\nintegration specially facilitating free movement of\r\ngoods, services and factors of production; and\r\ncontribute to sustainable development and gender\r\nequality.\r\nEfforts to source funds to implement\r\ndevelopment projects within the NEPAD framework\r\nhave been scaled up by the NEPAD and SADC\r\nsecretariats. In that context, intensive consultations are\r\nongoing to speed up the implementation of the Short-\r\nterm Action Plan for infrastructure and the CAADP.\r\nMoreover, in the NEPAD Short-term Action Plan,\r\nSADC has also identified the need to upgrade transport\r\ninfrastructure along some key regional corridors.\r\nSADC continues to contend with the HIV/AIDS\r\nscourge, which is threatening to reverse all the\r\ndevelopment gains we have made over the years. In\r\n2004, the Joint United Nations Programme on\r\nHIV/AIDS estimated that one third of the global\r\ncommunity living with HIV is in SADC countries. We\r\nhave, however, given top priority to combating the\r\npandemic, as well as other communicable diseases,\r\nsuch as malaria and tuberculosis, that are decimating\r\nour productive populations. To overcome those\r\nafflictions in the long run, we will continue to count on\r\nthe support of our development partners.\r\nSADC welcomes the recent pledges of increased\r\nsupport by the international community, as well as the\r\nrecent efforts to scale up official development\r\nassistance by realizing the 0.7 per cent target. In that\r\nregard, we commend the European Union for setting up\r\ntimetables for achieving that long overdue target. We\r\nequally laud and welcome the initiative of the G-8 to\r\ncancel 100 per cent of the debt of the highly indebted\r\npoor countries, 14 of which are in Africa.\r\nThe Secretary-General has noted in his report that\r\nsignificant progress has been made in the\r\nimplementation of the NEPAD initiative. That is\r\nlargely due to the impressive support of our\r\ndevelopment partners, to which SADC and, indeed, the\r\nrest of Africa owe a debt of gratitude. However, the\r\nSecretary-General also highlighted the ever-pressing\r\nchallenges of inadequate official development\r\nassistance, the growing debt burden, the unfair and\r\ninequitable global trade regime, and very low foreign\r\ndirect investment flows to Africa.\r\nIt should be a matter of great concern to all of us\r\nthat Africa continues to have the lowest share of global\r\nforeign direct investment flows. Equally worrying is\r\nAfrica’s unsustainable debt burden. For instance, the\r\nSADC countries have a total debt stock of $78.1\r\nbillion, with an annual total debt service amounting to\r\n$6.8 billion. Unless progress is made in those areas, the\r\n14\r\nA/60/PV.31\r\nimplementation of NEPAD and the realization of other\r\ninternationally agreed development goals will remain\r\nelusive. It is therefore imperative to ensure that all\r\ncommitments made are realized expeditiously if Africa\r\nis to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and\r\nsuccessfully implement its national development\r\nstrategies, including poverty reduction strategy papers\r\nand all programmes and projects embodied in the\r\nNEPAD initiative.\r\nIn conclusion, the Secretary-General in his report\r\npoints out that\r\n“[T]his is a moment of opportunity for making\r\nprogress in Africa’s development for which\r\nNEPAD is the main policy framework. The\r\ncentral challenge is to grasp the opportunity and\r\nmaintain the momentum” (A/60/178, para. 59).\r\nSADC can only concur with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that at no point in the past has an African\r\nregional policy framework held such immense promise,\r\nexhibited such enormous potential for development,\r\nand generated so much hope and international support.\r\nWe can only do well if we heed the Secretary-General’s\r\ncounsel and not lose the important momentum at this\r\ncritical juncture.\r\nMr. Hamidon (Malaysia): The States members of\r\nthe Association of South-East Asian Nations\r\n(ASEAN) — Brunei Darussalam, the Kingdom of\r\nCambodia, the Republic of Indonesia, the Lao People’s\r\nDemocratic Republic, the Union of Myanmar, the\r\nRepublic of the Philippines, the Republic of Singapore,\r\nThailand, the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and\r\nMalaysia — wish to associate themselves with the\r\nstatement made by the Permanent Representative of\r\nJamaica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nASEAN wishes to thank the Secretary-General\r\nfor his comprehensive and thorough report on progress\r\nin the implementation of and international support for\r\nthe New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD), as contained in document A/60/178.\r\nSince the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment was launched four years ago, there has\r\nbeen a transformation of the African peoples’ forward\r\nmovement towards greater integration and unity. The\r\nAfrican countries’ determination to maintain a positive\r\nmomentum, despite the many and complex challenges,\r\nis truly admirable. We are aware from the report of the\r\nSecretary-General that the African countries have taken\r\naction on many fronts, including in infrastructure\r\ndevelopment, information and communication\r\ntechnology, health, education, agriculture and many\r\nother important areas. The international community has\r\nmade a pledge to meet the special needs of Africa.\r\nWith the appropriate international response, African\r\ncountries would have a greater chance of achieving the\r\nMillennium Development Goals and of better\r\nintegrating themselves into the world economy. In that\r\nconnection, ASEAN hopes that partnerships for\r\nAfrica’s development can be further strengthened.\r\nThe partnership between Asia and Africa is long-\r\nstanding and was further strengthened at the inaugural\r\nAsia-Africa Conference in Bandung in 1955. That\r\nhistoric occasion gave rise to a unique spirit of kinship\r\nand solidarity known as the “Bandung spirit” among\r\nthe countries of the two regions. The 2005 Asia-Africa\r\nSummit and the golden jubilee of the Asia-Africa\r\nConference of 1955, held earlier this year in Indonesia,\r\nrevived the commitment of the two continents to build\r\na world resting on the principles of peace, security,\r\nstability and prosperity. A bridge spanning the Indian\r\nOcean, connecting the continents of Asia and Africa, is\r\nnow being built through the New Asia-Africa Strategic\r\nPartnership (NAASP).\r\nThere is much common ground between NEPAD\r\nand NAASP, as the challenges being addressed by\r\nAfrica are similar to those faced by other developing\r\ncountries in the Asia-Pacific region, including ASEAN.\r\nPoverty still exists in rural and urban areas. Both\r\nregions also face the pandemic of HIV/AIDS and other\r\ncommunicable diseases, such as tuberculosis and\r\nmalaria. The destructive forces of natural disasters\r\nhave also affected our lives. With such similarities, it is\r\nonly natural that Asia and Africa should work together.\r\nIn that regard, as a subregional organization, ASEAN\r\nwould very much like to have greater dialogue and\r\ncooperation in the full materialization of NEPAD, as\r\nwell as NAASP. Such a dialogue has been ongoing,\r\nincluding through the Tokyo International Conference\r\non African Development (TICAD) and the Asia-Africa\r\nSub-Regional Organizations Conference, in which\r\nASEAN has been actively participating.\r\nI would like to reiterate ASEAN’s commitment to\r\nthe successful implementation of NEPAD and NAASP,\r\nwhich are complementary efforts, and we hope that the\r\ninternational community will continue to give its full\r\nsupport to them.\r\n15\r\nA/60/PV.31\r\nI shall now make a statement on behalf of my\r\nown country, Malaysia.\r\nMalaysia wishes to take this opportunity to\r\nextend its best wishes to Mr. Ibrahim Agboola\r\nGambari, Under-Secretary-General/Special Adviser on\r\nAfrica, on his new assignment as Under-Secretary-\r\nGeneral in the Department of Political Affairs,\r\neffective 1 July 2005. We are confident that the\r\nSecretary-General will expeditiously appoint a\r\ncandidate of equal calibre to the post of Special\r\nAdviser on Africa, as the portfolio — which entails the\r\npromotion of international support for NEPAD and the\r\ndevelopment of Africa — is indeed very important.\r\nAs we have previously enunciated in the past,\r\nMalaysia views NEPAD as a courageous and bold\r\nundertaking by the African countries to prevent their\r\nfurther marginalization from the process of\r\nglobalization. In their efforts to integrate with the\r\nglobal economy, African countries themselves must\r\nhave the ownership of their development programmes,\r\nin partnership with the relevant international agencies.\r\nIn that regard, we consider NEPAD to be the most\r\nviable socio-economic blueprint for bringing sustained\r\neconomic growth that would, in turn, contribute to the\r\nstrengthening of democracy and enable the greater\r\nenjoyment of human rights by all the peoples of the\r\ncontinent.\r\nMalaysia welcomed and strongly supported the\r\nefforts to bring development into Africa through\r\nNEPAD. We commend the African countries for\r\nsupporting and adopting the initiative in their\r\ndevelopment agenda. We also applaud the leaders of\r\nAfrica for their continuing commitment and steadfast\r\ndetermination to take bold steps in promoting\r\nsustainable economic growth and social development,\r\nreducing poverty, and achieving food security and\r\npolitical stability in their respective countries. I wish to\r\nrecall that the Non-Aligned Movement, too, at its\r\ntwelfth conference of heads of State or Government in\r\nKuala Lumpur in February 2003, commended the\r\nestablishment of NEPAD and supported its full\r\nimplementation.\r\nWe are all aware that Africa faces numerous,\r\nmultifaceted and complex issues that are challenging\r\nand must be dealt with in a comprehensive, integrated\r\nand coordinated manner. The continent still lags behind\r\nthe target of six per cent growth in gross national\r\nproduct per annum, as established by the United\r\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in\r\nthe 1990s. It has been noted that Africa will require an\r\naverage annual economic growth of seven per cent to\r\nenable it to reduce by half the number of people living\r\nin poverty in the continent by 2015. That can be\r\nachieved only with external assistance, particularly\r\nfrom the developed countries, in terms of providing\r\nfinancial resources and foreign direct investment and\r\nopening up markets for exports from African countries.\r\nIn that connection, we share the view of the\r\nSecretary-General that NEPAD cannot succeed without\r\na significant increase in support from the international\r\ncommunity and that unleashing Africa’s potential for\r\ndevelopment requires harnessing the creativity and\r\ndynamism of private initiative in a range of areas,\r\nincluding agriculture, industry, science and technology,\r\nand infrastructure development. In that regard,\r\nMalaysia welcomes the agreement by the Group of 8 to\r\ncancel the debt of the 18 poorest countries, the\r\nmajority of which are in Africa. We are also pleased\r\nwith the adoption by the European Union of a set of\r\nclear timelines for reaching the 0.7 per cent target of its\r\ngross national income as official development\r\nassistance, and to double its aid to more than $80\r\nbillion a year by 2010.\r\nMalaysia is of the view that the establishment of\r\nthe African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) could\r\ncontribute further to efforts to achieve the goals set\r\nunder NEPAD. In that regard, we hope further\r\ninitiatives can be undertaken to encourage and enable\r\nAfrican countries to accede to the APRM. We also\r\nacknowledge the important contributions and roles of\r\nthe African Union, the Economic Community of West\r\nAfrican States, the Economic Community of Central\r\nAfrican States, the Intergovernmental Authority on\r\nDevelopment and the Southern African Development\r\nCommunity.\r\nMalaysia is pleased with its existing state of\r\nrelations and the level of cooperation with Africa.\r\nNonetheless, we would continue to explore additional\r\nways and means to further promote cooperation with\r\ncountries in the continent. Malaysia’s trade and\r\neconomic links with Africa have grown at a\r\nsatisfactory rate. In 2002, our trade with Africa totalled\r\n$1.353 billion. Last year, in 2004, it rose to $2.215\r\nbillion, an increase of 64 per cent within a span of two\r\nyears. Malaysia will continue to encourage its private\r\nsector to promote and further enhance its close\r\n16\r\nA/60/PV.31\r\neconomic ties with its counterparts in the African\r\ncountries for our mutual benefit.\r\nSince 1980, within the framework of the\r\nMalaysian Technical Cooperation Programme,\r\nMalaysia has offered technical cooperation in areas in\r\nwhich it has comparative advantage in term of\r\nexperience and expertise to 46 African countries.\r\nMalaysia considers this programme as its modest but\r\nuseful contribution to Africa in the context of South-\r\nSouth cooperation. We have also engaged African\r\npartners, at both the governmental and private sector\r\nlevels, through the annual Langkawi International\r\nDialogue and the Southern African International\r\nDialogue, convened under the auspices of the\r\nCommonwealth Partnership for Technology\r\nManagement. Malaysia participated as an observer in\r\nthe Third Tokyo International Conference on African\r\nDevelopment and looks forward to actively\r\nparticipating again in TICAD IV in Japan in 2008.\r\nMalaysia also supports the New Asian-African\r\nStrategic Partnership adopted at the 2005 Asian-\r\nAfrican Summit in Jakarta.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reaffirm Malaysia’s\r\ncommitment to cooperating with our African brothers\r\nand sisters in their collective efforts towards achieving\r\npeace, sustainable development and prosperity in their\r\ncountries. Malaysia reiterates that it will do its utmost,\r\nwithin its limited means and capacity, to join others in\r\nassisting Africa, a continent that holds tremendous\r\nresources and potential, in developing its own capacity\r\nto fully integrate into the world economy.\r\nMr. Abdelaziz (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): At the\r\noutset, let me express our appreciation for the reports\r\nof the Secretary-General on the agenda items under\r\ndiscussion. We endorse the statements made by the\r\nrepresentative of Jamaica on behalf of the Group of 77\r\nand China and by the representative of Namibia on\r\nbehalf of the Group of African States. We also thank\r\nyou, Sir, for your opening statement at this meeting,\r\nwhich made a unique contribution to our debate.\r\nThe outcome document of the recent High-level\r\nPlenary Meeting stresses the need to strengthen\r\ninternational support for Africa so that it can meet its\r\nspecial needs. The heads of State and Government\r\nparticularly emphasized the central role of the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), the\r\nideal framework in which the international community\r\nand the United Nations can mobilize efforts to assist\r\nthe African countries to build a better future for\r\ncoming generations.\r\nEgypt attaches particular importance to that\r\ninitiative because it is based on realities in Africa and\r\non a comprehensive vision of the challenges and\r\nproblems the continent is facing. It is also based on the\r\nachievement of a genuine international development\r\npartnership in which Africa and the developed States\r\ncan work in earnest to attain African and global\r\ndevelopment objectives.\r\nEgypt has taken several leading measures at\r\nvarious levels to support NEPAD. Egypt hosted the\r\nthirteenth summit of the NEPAD Heads of State and\r\nGovernment Implementation Committee in Sharm\r\nel-Sheikh in April. We feel that there is an urgent need\r\nto activate the African Peer Review Mechanism\r\n(APRM) in order to help Africa to strengthen\r\ndemocracy, good governance and respect for human\r\nrights, and Egypt has therefore made a voluntary\r\ncontribution of $1 million to the APRM Trust Fund, in\r\naddition to its regular annual contribution of $100,000.\r\nWith respect to health, HIV/AIDS, malaria,\r\ntuberculosis and other diseases, President Mubarak has\r\nundertaken to establish an African centre to combat\r\nHIV/AIDS and endemic diseases, in the context of\r\nEgypt’s commitment to strengthening African\r\ncapacities to attain the priority goals of the Millennium\r\nSummit by enhancing South-South cooperation and by\r\ndrawing on international expertise and assistance.\r\nWork has already begun on the creation of the centre in\r\nEgypt, in accordance with the decision taken at a\r\nmeeting of the African ministers of health in Egypt last\r\nJune.\r\nWith respect to market access and agriculture,\r\nEgypt hosted a regional meeting for North Africa to\r\ndraw up projects to be implemented in the context of\r\nthe Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development\r\nProgramme. It also hosted a meeting of African\r\nministers of trade to consider ways to enhance Africa’s\r\naccess to international markets, as set out in the Cairo\r\nDeclaration elaborating Africa’s unified position vis-à-\r\nvis the agenda of the World Trade Organization\r\nplanning meeting to be held in Hong Kong in\r\nDecember.\r\nWe would stress in particular the need for the\r\ninternational community to fulfil its commitments to\r\nAfrica by mobilizing financial resources to implement\r\nAfrican projects. We warmly welcome the constructive\r\n17\r\nA/60/PV.31\r\ndiscussions that took place in the context of the recent\r\nNEPAD forum on the financing and implementation of\r\nAfrican projects, held in London. We hope that an\r\nagreement can be reached as soon as possible on\r\nfunding African projects, reflecting the various\r\ncommitments of the developed countries to our\r\ncontinent.\r\nMeeting at Gleneagles, the industrialized nations\r\nof the G-8 pledged to cancel the debts of 18 least\r\ndeveloped countries, 14 of which are in Africa. While\r\nthat initiative was highly important, we hope that it\r\nwill be broadened ever further to cover the wider area\r\nof the foreign debt burden that weighs heavily on all\r\nthe indebted countries of Africa, including the\r\nmedium-income States.\r\nFurthermore, the commitment of the developed\r\ncountries must not be limited to the relief of external\r\ndebt. We hope that they will open their markets to\r\nAfrica’s products and help it to increase production and\r\ndiversify its exports. We also hope that they will\r\nstabilize basic commodity prices and raise their official\r\ndevelopment assistance to the internationally agreed\r\nlevels. Finally, we hope to cooperate with the\r\ndeveloped countries in implementing the agreements\r\nreached in the Millennium Declaration Goals,\r\nparticularly the Millennium Development Goals, as\r\nthey pertain to meeting Africa’s needs at all levels.\r\nEgypt wishes to underline its endorsement of the\r\nconclusions of the report of the Secretary-General on\r\nthe causes of conflict in Africa (A/60/182). The report\r\npresents a unique vision of the achievements,\r\nchallenges and threats in the area of peace and security\r\non the African continent, as well as regional and\r\ninternational initiatives taken in that regard.\r\nToday’s debate comes at a crucial moment, as we\r\nare working to act on the decisions, recommendations\r\nand commitments made at September’s High-level\r\nPlenary Meeting, as contained in the 2005 World\r\nSummit Outcome (resolution 60/1). The outcome\r\ndocument included commitments to strengthen African\r\npeacekeeping and peacebuilding capacities through the\r\ngrowing structure of the African Union, in addition to\r\nthe establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission.\r\nWe stress the need for a multidimensional approach to\r\nthe concept of peace and security and its profound\r\ninter-relationship with the achievement of sustainable\r\ndevelopment in the African continent. In that respect,\r\nwe underline the complementary roles of the General\r\nAssembly, the Security Council, the Economic and\r\nSocial Council, regional organizations, international\r\nfinancial institutions and the funds and programmes of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nFollowing the establishment of priorities and\r\nstrategies by African Governments, we hope that a\r\ndecision on creating the Peacebuilding Commission\r\ncan be reached by the end of the year. We call for more\r\ninstitutional cooperation between NEPAD and the\r\nUnited Nations, in particular because NEPAD,\r\nfollowing guidelines laid down by the African Union,\r\nis developing a strategic policy framework for dealing\r\nwith the challenges of the post-conflict phase and\r\nreconstruction. The Peacebuilding Commission should\r\ntake into account African points of view and priorities\r\nwith respect to peacebuilding on the continent.\r\nWe welcome the report’s thorough description of\r\npriorities on the African continent, in particular the\r\ncontinuing negative impact of the illegal exploitation\r\nof natural resources in conflict areas. Egypt calls on\r\nthe Security Council to give particular attention to that\r\nproblem when dealing with the causes of  armed\r\nconflicts in Africa, because it is well known that the\r\nillegal exploitation of natural resources in conflict\r\nareas is a main cause of the persistence of armed\r\nconflicts. Furthermore, the problem is linked to the\r\nillegal trade in small arms and light weapons.\r\nFinally, the report transmitted by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his note (A/60/208) makes clear that\r\nattaining the Millennium Development Goal of halting\r\nmalaria by 2015 requires greater financial resources on\r\nthe domestic and international levels. In fact, with\r\n$3 billion spent annually on combating malaria, it is\r\nvery important to develop vaccines and diversified\r\ntreatments, given the disease’s resistance to current\r\nantimalarial treatments. We believe that more medical\r\nresearch is required for new therapies and vaccines to\r\ncombat potential new strains of malaria. Governments\r\nand pharmaceutical companies should increase\r\ninvestment in order to provide affordable treatments to\r\npeople in developing countries.\r\nIt is not impossible to eliminate malaria. In 1998,\r\nEgypt successfully moved out of the category of\r\ncountries in which malaria is endemic, thanks to\r\nstrenuous and persistent efforts to fully eliminate the\r\ndisease except for a few cases coming from outside the\r\ncountry. The Egyptian programme to eliminate malaria\r\nhas been a success in all respects. For that reason,\r\n18\r\nA/60/PV.31\r\nEgypt would like to share its experience with interested\r\ncountries in Africa and elsewhere.\r\nMs. Núñez Mordoche (Cuba) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): At the outset, my delegation wishes to\r\nassociate itself with the statement made by the\r\nAmbassador of Jamaica on behalf of the Group of 77\r\nand China.\r\nMany identify the African continent with idyllic\r\npostcards of safaris on its great prairies or with the\r\nmuch-repeated images of the ills afflicting that\r\ncontinent, as if nothing else was worth mentioning and\r\nas if its men and women did not exist. It is as if the\r\nancestral wisdom of Africa’s peoples did not deserve\r\ncareful study and preservation.\r\nFor Cubans, Africa is not a legend from some\r\ndistant time and place. For Cubans, Africa is an\r\nessential part of what we are and what we hope to build\r\nin the future. Thus, it is absurd to speak of the Cuban\r\nnation merely from a Eurocentric perspective.\r\nDuring the colonial period, 1.3 million black\r\nslaves were uprooted from their homelands to work in\r\nthe plantations of the Spanish society of that time.\r\nThey came from different ethnic groups: the Lukumí,\r\nCarabalí, Congo, Ganga, Mandingo, Mina, Bibi and\r\nYoruba. To be sure, the colonizers amassed huge\r\nfortunes, thanks to the toil of those peoples, but they\r\ncould not prevent the slaves from passing on their\r\nlanguages to us, along with their religious beliefs, their\r\nmusic and their temperament. Cuba changed forever.\r\nSimilar situations occurred throughout almost the\r\nentire American continent and the West Indies. The\r\nroute of slavery was an integral part of the flagrant\r\nexploitation and the impoverishment of Africa. Today,\r\nmany try to ignore, justify and, even worse, erase that\r\nsad episode of modern history.\r\nMuch has been said of the current conditions in\r\nAfrica and the accumulated needs of the region. Many\r\nof those who claim to be concerned about the region\r\nhave not shown much interest in changing the essential\r\nproblem, after centuries of exploitation and plundering.\r\nAs long as the current political and economic\r\norder prevails — in which a few consume almost\r\neverything and the majority of the planet’s population\r\nis left excluded from the so-called benefits of neo-\r\nliberal globalization — Africa will remain\r\nmarginalized, and the legacy of colonialism will never\r\ncome to an end.\r\nIf the Governments of the region continue to be\r\ntold to implement failed structural adjustment policies,\r\nAfrica will continue to finance the opulence of rich\r\ncountries. The developed countries will make new\r\npromises of official development assistance and will\r\nperhaps fulfil some of those promises, but they will\r\nkeep collecting hundreds of times the amount of the\r\npromised assistance as service on external debt. Today,\r\nAfrica spends four times as much on debt servicing as\r\nit does on education and health care combined.\r\nCuba firmly believes in the ability of African\r\nleaders to find solutions for the conflict situations that\r\nhave a devastating effect on the economic and social\r\nadvancement of the region and create an additional\r\nobstacle to achieving the Millennium Development\r\nGoals. The steps taken recently in that direction\r\nthrough the hard work of the African Union are proof\r\nof this. Cuba will continue to support the African\r\nUnion and all other regional cooperation mechanisms\r\nas they work to find their own solutions to the\r\nproblems of Africa. There have been many regional\r\nefforts to that end, and more than anything else they\r\nrequire from the United Nations an integrated focus on\r\nthe resolution of problems related to Africa’s peace,\r\nsecurity and development.\r\nRegional efforts require the cessation of foreign\r\ninterference, the total elimination of mercenary\r\nactivities and an end to disputes among transnational\r\ncorporations to control the vast mineral resources of\r\nthe continent, so that the profits from their sale are\r\nfinally used to eradicate definitively poverty, improve\r\nhealth conditions and guarantee education for all the\r\ninhabitants of the continent.\r\nA cardinal principle of Cuba’s foreign policy is\r\nthe principled practice of internationalism and\r\nsolidarity with other peoples of the world. Cuba did not\r\ndesert Africans in their struggle against colonialism,\r\nand we never asked for anything in return. When the\r\napartheid regime was defeated, the Cubans took home\r\nonly the mortal remains of our fighters.\r\nOur policy of collaboration with African\r\ncountries, implemented since the early years of the\r\nCuban revolution, is carried out through diplomatic\r\nrelations with 52 of the countries of the region, our 30\r\naccredited diplomatic missions in the area, and the 22\r\nAfrican missions based in Havana. In addition, we\r\nhave maintained a policy of defending African interests\r\nin all international forums.\r\n19\r\nA/60/PV.31\r\nCuba has given material reality to its selfless\r\nsolidarity and cooperation to almost all the countries of\r\nthe region. The main sectors of interaction are health\r\ncare, education, sports, agriculture, fisheries,\r\nconstruction, water resources and physical planning. To\r\ndate, some 30,000 young African students have been\r\ngraduated from Cuban educational institutions.\r\nThe Cuban proposal, presented at the twenty-\r\nsixth special session of the General Assembly, on\r\nHIV/AIDS, to provide medical personnel to help fight\r\nthe serious effects of the pandemic, still stands. It\r\nwould be enough if those with larger financial\r\nresources decided to contribute to a programme of\r\ntriangular cooperation, the results of which would be\r\nimmediately noticeable.\r\nMr. Toro Jiménez (Bolivarian Republic of\r\nVenezuela), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nOur African experience shows that, more than\r\nmoney, what is needed is serious political will to\r\nimprove cooperation, addressing the priorities\r\nidentified by local authorities and showing respect for\r\nthe traditions and cultures of the beneficiaries of\r\ncooperation.\r\nCuba is making efforts despite being a country of\r\nscarce resources and having been subjected to a strict\r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo for more\r\nthan four decades.\r\nThe people of Africa have a right to peace, a just\r\ninternational order and sustainable development. They\r\ndo not need paternalism; they need training of human\r\ncapital and access to markets and technologies. They\r\ndo not need hypocritical lessons on what is in their best\r\ninterest. Africa deserves, above all, solidarity and\r\nrespect.\r\nMr. Hachani (Tunisia) (spoke in French): My\r\ndelegation aligns itself with the statements made by\r\nJamaica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China and by\r\nNamibia on behalf of the African Group.\r\nBy dedicating part of its recommendations to the\r\nspecific needs of Africa, the outcome document of the\r\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting (resolution 60/1)\r\nconfirmed the priority attached to Africa by the\r\ninternational community and the United Nations\r\nsystem. It also affirmed the urgent need to put this\r\nconsensus into practice at various levels by setting up a\r\ngenuine partnership for development for Africa, which\r\nhas long been weakened by the horrors of armed\r\nconflict, instability and poverty and pandemics.\r\nThe emphasis placed on malaria during today’s\r\ndebate is very significant in this connection. The final\r\ndocument calls for the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) — a comprehensive and\r\nintegrated programme to promote Africa’s\r\ndevelopment and the basis for cooperation with its\r\npartners — to be provided with the financial, material\r\nand institutional means required for it to effectively\r\nfunction. Yet despite the determination of the African\r\ncountries and the commitment of their partners, the\r\nimplementation of this important African programme\r\nrequires greater mobilization on the part of the\r\ninternational community and better coordination of its\r\nmeans of intervention.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s third consolidated report\r\non progress in implementation and international\r\nsupport for NEPAD (A/60/178) particularly emphasizes\r\nthis and advocates strengthening national and regional\r\ncapacities in the area of the implementation of NEPAD\r\nto ensure that coordination and coherence exist\r\nbetween national development plans and NEPAD\r\npriorities. My delegation shares that view, but we\r\nbelieve that the process of macroeconomic reform and\r\nhuman development requires financial, human and\r\ntechnical resources currently well beyond the means of\r\nmany African countries. Hence the structural need for\r\noutside help commensurate with these needs.\r\nIn this connection, Tunisia welcomes the\r\nconclusions of the Committee for Programme and\r\nCoordination (see A/60/16) regarding a renewed United\r\nNations commitment to provide effective and\r\ncoordinated assistance to the various NEPAD\r\nprogrammes and to identifying innovative approaches\r\nfor funding its priorities.\r\nAfrica is undoubtedly the region most affected by\r\nthe contrasts of the contemporary world. Despite its\r\ndetermination to become self-sufficient by adopting\r\nplans for restructuring and upgrading, despite its\r\nprogress on settling conflicts that have long stood in\r\nthe way of development in numerous countries, and\r\ndespite its high priority on the world agenda, Africa is\r\nlagging far behind in the timetable for the achievement\r\nof the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nThere can be no doubt that the development\r\nprocess depends to a great extent on the international\r\neconomic and financial context. Consequently, creating\r\n20\r\nA/60/PV.31\r\nan environment conducive to the development of\r\nAfrica — which is also a pillar of the process of\r\nimplementation of the NEPAD priorities — is a\r\nprerequisite for achieving stable and permanent\r\nbalance in the regional and subregional political and\r\neconomic order. That would enable Africa to speed up\r\nthe process of integration into the world economy and\r\nto gradually do away with the sources and hotbeds of\r\nconflict. The interaction between development and\r\nsecurity has been clearly proven. Peace will always\r\nremain fragile and subject to reverses without a\r\npropitious economic environment and real\r\ndevelopment prospects.\r\nIn this context, we should welcome the efforts\r\nmade by the African Union, particularly the\r\nestablishment of the Peace and Security Council, for\r\nthe prevention, management and settlement of conflict\r\nand post-conflict situations are among the prerequisites\r\nfor implementation of the MDGs and the NEPAD\r\npriorities. Likewise, for the Peace and Security Council\r\nto be able to discharge its mandate, it is essential to\r\ncontinue to provide better institutional harmonization\r\nof its actions with those of the United Nations. The\r\nimplementation of the decision to create a\r\nPeacebuilding Commission will undoubtedly provide a\r\nvery valuable instrument in that connection.\r\nFinally, we hope that the Office of the Special\r\nAdvisor to the Secretary-General on Africa,\r\nresponsible among other things for relations with\r\nNEPAD, will continue to grow in strength.\r\nMr. Suresh Kurup (India): We thank the\r\nSecretary-General for the third consolidated report on\r\nthe progress in implementation and international\r\nsupport of the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) and other reports prepared for\r\nthis item. We associate ourselves with the statement\r\nmade by the representative of Jamaica on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77.\r\nCrafting partnerships among the African\r\ncountries and between Africa and the rest of the\r\ninternational community lies at the core of NEPAD.\r\nWith its abundance of natural resources and the\r\ntremendous capacity of its peoples to be agents of\r\nchange, Africa holds the key to its own development.\r\nWe are convinced that success in achieving the\r\nobjectives of NEPAD will depend on an African-led\r\nand Africa-developed agenda. The issues and\r\nchallenges facing Africa, and their solutions, are best\r\nknown to African countries themselves. They have\r\ndemonstrated their commitment to advancing the\r\nimplementation of NEPAD through a number of\r\nmeasures. Africa needs concerted international support\r\nfor the solutions that it has identified.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General’s Advisory\r\nPanel on International Support for NEPAD (A/60/85)\r\nemphasizes the need to move from rhetoric to action. It\r\ncautions that special initiatives in support of African\r\ndevelopment have failed in the past to live up to the\r\npromises made or to their potential. During the past ten\r\nmonths, we have had the opportunity to discuss the\r\nspecial needs of Africa in the context of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report “In larger freedom” (A/59/2005), and\r\nearlier during discussions of the Millennium Project\r\nreport. The Advisory Panel has observed that these and\r\nother documents have stressed that significant\r\nadditional financial assistance over an extended period\r\nof time will be needed to meet Africa’s human needs\r\nand development goals. The Panel, while noting that\r\nhumanitarian assistance has been critical in saving\r\nlives, urges development partners to provide assistance\r\non a long-term basis, rather than responding only when\r\na crisis arises.\r\nThe General Assembly, in its resolution 59/250,\r\nentitled “Triennial comprehensive policy review of\r\noperational activities for development of the United\r\nNations system”, has also highlighted the need for the\r\nearly provision of development assistance even as the\r\ninternational community begins to provide\r\nhumanitarian assistance. The international community\r\nneeds to remain engaged during the period of transition\r\nfrom relief to development.\r\nThe report of the Advisory Panel has put forward\r\nsome ideas, emphasizing, inter alia, the need for\r\ninvestment in Africa’s human resources; development\r\nof its private sector, apart from increases in aid levels;\r\ndebt relief; completion of the Doha round of\r\nmultilateral trade negotiations; and improvement in the\r\nquality and coordination of support provided by the\r\nUnited Nations. Through a variety of initiatives, India\r\nhas consistently endeavoured to be a friend and partner\r\nof Africa in its developmental efforts in many of the\r\nareas identified by the Advisory Panel.\r\nIt has been India’s objective to impart a\r\nsubstantive economic content to our relationship with\r\nAfrica. Despite limited resources, India has, over the\r\nyears, made contributions to several Africa-specific\r\n21\r\nA/60/PV.31\r\nfunds and programmes. The Indian Technical and\r\nEconomic Cooperation Programme has over many\r\ndecades provided a framework for enhancing\r\ncooperation between India and African countries. A\r\nlarge number of African students have shared in the\r\nbenefits of the Indian education system. India’s\r\ncontribution of $200 million for engagement with\r\nNEPAD projects and the formation of a new group —\r\nTEAM-9, the Techno-Economic Approach for Africa-\r\nIndia Movement — are specific examples of India’s\r\ncontribution to solidarity with Africa and of South-\r\nSouth cooperation. Over the last six months, projects\r\namounting to some $84.3 million have been approved\r\nwithin the framework of the NEPAD line of credit, and\r\nseveral projects, supported by India under the TEAM-9\r\nprogramme, have also been approved.\r\nThe Advisory Panel has highlighted the\r\nimportance of trade and investments in Africa. Over\r\nthe last few years, economic and commercial ties have\r\ngrown between India and Africa and trade has risen\r\nsharply. India imports substantially from Africa, and\r\nIndian joint ventures in Africa cover a range of\r\nproducts. India also has fairly extensive investments in\r\na number of countries in Africa.\r\nIndia has started work on a connectivity mission\r\nin Africa which will support tele-education, tele-\r\nmedicine, e-commerce, e-governance, info-tainment,\r\nresource-mapping and meteorological services. A\r\nseamless and integrated satellite, fibre optics and\r\nwireless network to be provided by India will connect\r\nfive universities, 51 learning centres, 10 super-\r\nspeciality hospitals and 53 patient-end locations in\r\nrural areas all over Africa and will provide\r\nvideoconferencing facilities connecting all 53 heads of\r\nState and Government in Africa. The Pan-African\r\nNetwork Project has been formally endorsed by the\r\nAfrican Union (AU), and it is expected that a\r\nmemorandum of understanding between the\r\nGovernment of India and the AU will be signed during\r\nthe visit of a high-level AU team to India, from 25 to\r\n29 October 2005. This is a landmark project that will\r\nassist our friends in Africa in meeting Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) in education and health\r\ncare.\r\nIndia and Africa have a common fight against\r\npoverty and disease. India is putting together a\r\nsubstantial initiative to assist in Africa’s fight against\r\nHIV/AIDS and other pandemics. We hope to encourage\r\nIndian pharmaceutical companies to establish\r\nproduction facilities in Africa to cater to the increasing\r\nrequirement for affordable medicines, especially for\r\nantiretroviral drugs. There is need for the international\r\ncommunity to urgently provide resources for an\r\nexpanded and comprehensive response to HIV/AIDS\r\nand other diseases.\r\nFrom 1960 to 1973, African Governments\r\npursued activist policies in protecting industries and\r\ndefending livelihoods, but the 1973 oil crisis led to\r\nserious indebtedness, worsened by the International\r\nMonetary Fund’s structural adjustment policies. The\r\nresults are visible today in the challenges faced by sub-\r\nSaharan Africa. The Millennium Project report\r\nhighlighted the problems of sub-Saharan Africa and the\r\npoverty trap — that is, low tax returns, low saving\r\nrates and the like. Debt-constrained structural\r\nadjustment policies compounded the problem through a\r\ndecline in agricultural investment. The region got the\r\nworst of both worlds because of the agricultural\r\npolicies of developed countries that were underpinned\r\nby enormous subsidies.\r\nThe fulcrum of international economic endeavour\r\nis Millennium Development Goal 8, as well as\r\nparagraphs 42, 44 and 62 of the Monterrey Consensus.\r\nDelivery on these issues is essential for fulfilling the\r\nobjectives of NEPAD. Achievement of the MDGs in a\r\nsustained manner, leading to real economic\r\ntransformation, is hardly possible without more and\r\neffective debt relief, a fundamental reform of\r\ninternational economic and monetary institutions and a\r\nsuccessful realization of the development agenda of the\r\nDoha round.\r\nAgainst this backdrop, India has consistently\r\nsupported proposals in the United Nations to convert\r\ninto grants all remaining official bilateral debt of the\r\npoorest African countries and has supported the Highly\r\nIndebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative. India\r\ndid its part by writing off the debt owed by African\r\ncountries under the HIPC Initiative and by\r\nrestructuring commercial debt. The debt problems\r\nfaced by many low- and middle-income developing\r\ncountries continue to severely constrain their ability to\r\naccelerate economic development and to achieve the\r\nMDGs.\r\nWe welcome the G-8 proposal for irrevocable\r\ndebt cancellation for the HIPC countries, a proposal\r\nthat has generated high expectations in eligible\r\ncountries. The modalities for the implementation of\r\n22\r\nA/60/PV.31\r\nthis initiative need to be further clarified, notably on\r\nadditional resources, the possible inclusion of\r\nadditional beneficiary countries, and policy\r\nconditionalities such as privatization and trade\r\nliberalization, which have in some cases been\r\ndetrimental to development.\r\nWe note from the Secretary-General’s report that\r\nmany recent trends in Africa have been positive, that\r\nthe number of major conflicts has been reduced and\r\nthat most African countries enjoy relatively stable\r\npolitical conditions, with the majority having\r\ndemocratically elected Governments. We hope that\r\nthese developments will provide the basis for an\r\nenvironment conducive to economic growth and\r\ndevelopment. An important factor in addressing the\r\ncauses of conflict and contributing to durable peace\r\nand sustainable development in Africa, cited by the\r\nSecretary-General’s report, is the commitment of the\r\ninternational community, including United Nations\r\norganizations, to allocate increased financial, human\r\nand technical resources.\r\nFor its part, India has participated in almost every\r\npeacekeeping mission in Africa and has over 5,000\r\npeacekeepers now serving in Africa. In this context, we\r\nhave supported the establishment of a Peacebuilding\r\nCommission that aims to address the special needs of\r\ncountries emerging from conflict towards recovery,\r\nreintegration and reconstruction. We look forward to its\r\nbecoming functional by the end of this year.\r\nThe 2005 World Summit Outcome document\r\n(resolution 60/1) welcomed the substantial progress\r\nmade by the African countries in fulfilling their\r\ncommitments and emphasized the need to carry\r\nforward the implementation of NEPAD. Through that\r\ndocument, our leaders expressed their resolve to\r\nstrengthen cooperation with NEPAD by providing\r\ncoherent support for the programmes drawn up by\r\nAfrican leaders within that framework. The outcome\r\ndocument contains several substantive proposals. We\r\nhope to see appropriate follow-up mechanisms put in\r\nplace in pursuit of those proposals.\r\nIndia’s solidarity with Africa in the struggle\r\nagainst colonialism and apartheid, its peacekeeping\r\noperations in Africa since the 1960s and its economic\r\nand scientific collaboration with Africa today are\r\naimed not just at maintaining peace and territorial\r\nintegrity, but at empowering Africa economically and\r\npolitically, in  both national and international political\r\nand economic decision-making. It is hoped that the\r\nbest will not be sacrificed to the good. While\r\nmaintaining the principle of non-discrimination, we\r\nshould recall that, historically, no struggles for\r\nempowerment have ever achieved success in one fell\r\nswoop, but rather through a process of negotiations and\r\nover time. Any alternative may run the risk of\r\nprolonging the state of lack of full empowerment.\r\nMr. Chulkov (Russian Federation) (spoke in\r\nRussian): I should like at the outset to take this\r\nopportunity to express once again, on behalf of the\r\nRussian delegation, our deep condolences to the\r\npeoples of Pakistan, India and Afghanistan affected by\r\nthe catastrophic earthquake of 8 October. We would\r\nalso like to express our solidarity with the\r\nGovernments of those countries. Along with a number\r\nof other countries, the Russian Federation responded to\r\nthe tragedy without delay by sending search and rescue\r\nteams, doctors, special equipment, and humanitarian\r\naid to the areas of disaster.\r\nTurning now to the agenda items under\r\ndiscussion today, I should like to say, first of all, that\r\nthe Russian Federation notes with satisfaction the\r\nprogress made in recent years towards settling conflicts\r\nin Africa, especially in Sierra Leone, Burundi, Sudan,\r\nLiberia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. At\r\nthe same time, the general situation on the continent is\r\nstill far from stable. We consider the strengthening of\r\nstability in Africa to be a priority for the international\r\ncommunity in order to build, under the auspices of the\r\nUnited Nations, a global system to counter the threats\r\nand challenges of the modern world. We will not\r\nachieve the harmonious and sustainable development\r\nof international relations if the African continent\r\nremains a hotbed of instability.\r\nWe stand for close interaction between the United\r\nNations, African regional and subregional entities and\r\nindividual States so as to develop harmonized and\r\nintegrated approaches to the settlement of conflicts in\r\nthe region, which should be based on predominance of\r\npolitical and diplomatic methods and strict compliance\r\nwith the peacekeeping norms and principles set out in\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. This has been\r\nconfirmed by the adoption at the 14 September\r\nSecurity Council summit of Council resolution 1625\r\n(2005), on strengthening the effectiveness of the\r\nSecurity Council’s role in conflict prevention,\r\nparticularly in Africa, sponsored by the Group of\r\nAfrican States.\r\n23\r\nA/60/PV.31\r\nIn keeping with its status as a permanent member\r\nof the Security Council, Russia has been making a\r\nsignificant contribution to peacekeeping activities on\r\nthe continent, including the development of a strategy\r\nfor settling specific armed conflicts and defining the\r\nmandates of the relevant peacekeeping operations\r\nwithin the Security Council. Russian military personnel\r\nand law-enforcement officers — as of now totalling\r\nsome 220 persons — are involved in almost all United\r\nNations peacekeeping operations in Africa.\r\nRussia is also conducting training for African\r\npeacekeepers. At present, we are considering the\r\npossibility of broadening our cooperation in this area\r\nwith the African countries. We intend to continue to\r\npromote stability in Africa in every possible way and\r\nto assist African countries in building their own anti-\r\ncrisis capacity.\r\nWe support the new approach in United Nations\r\npeacekeeping practice of ensuring close interaction\r\namong the United Nations missions deployed in\r\nneighbouring African States. It is of critical importance\r\nthat this be well coordinated. Here, however, we should\r\nbe particularly careful: coordinated activities of the\r\nUnited Nations forces should be sanctioned of the\r\nSecurity Council and be based on the principles of full\r\nrespect for the sovereignty of individual States and the\r\nconsent of the troop-contributing countries; they\r\nshould not go beyond the mandates defined for each\r\nindividual mission.\r\nIn the context of the efforts to stabilize post-\r\nconflict situations in Africa, we recognize the\r\nconsiderable potential of the future Peacebuilding\r\nCommission. We hope that Member States will swiftly\r\nreach agreement on all the issues related to its\r\nactivities. We are convinced that, above all, active\r\nparticipation of the African States themselves is\r\nrequired to ensure a more durable peace on the\r\ncontinent. It is important to take measures against\r\nillegal armed groups; to strengthen good-neighbourly\r\nrelations; to enhance cooperation on ensuring the\r\nsecurity of borders and their impenetrability with\r\nrespect to the spilling over of conflicts, arms and\r\nmercenaries; and to eradicate mass violations of\r\ninternational humanitarian law and eliminate impunity\r\nfor crimes against humanity. We appreciate the efforts\r\nmade by the African community in this area, and we\r\nwelcome the vigorous activities of the Peace and\r\nSecurity Council of the African Union, including those\r\naimed at establishing an African standby force.\r\nThe Russian Federation attaches great importance\r\nto international cooperation in promoting the\r\ndevelopment of African countries, which we view\r\nthrough the prism of their achieving the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals through implementation of the\r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD).\r\nWe are pleased to note that the work within the social\r\nand economic dimensions of NEPAD is gathering pace,\r\nas demonstrated by the fruitful ongoing efforts made\r\nby African countries to develop infrastructure,\r\nmodernize agriculture and education and fight the\r\nspread of infectious diseases. Our country, a\r\nresponsible member of the international community, is\r\ncontributing to speeding those processes by acting\r\nsimultaneously on several tracks.\r\nAs a member of the Group of Eight, Russia\r\nactively participates in the implementation of the\r\nGroup’s Africa Action Plan, which aims at promoting\r\nwork within NEPAD, and Russia continues to pay great\r\nattention to resolving urgent issues of the social and\r\neconomic development of the African continent.\r\nDebt relief for the countries of the region remains\r\na major focus of our assistance to Africa, including\r\nthrough the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)\r\nDebt Initiative. So far, Russia has cancelled or pledged\r\nto cancel $11.3 billion of the debt of African countries,\r\nincluding more then $2 billion through the HIPC\r\nInitiative. In 2003-2004, Russia contributed an\r\nadditional $10 million to the Initiative Trust Fund. For\r\n2005-2006, it decided to pay an additional $15 million\r\nto the Fund, and the first instalment — $5 million —\r\nhas already been transferred.\r\nIn the context of the Paris Club, Russia has\r\npledged to cancel more than $1 billion of the debt of\r\nEthiopia. We continue our work on settling the debt of\r\nAfrican countries on a bilateral basis. Russia has\r\nsigned relevant agreements with Sao Tome and\r\nPrincipe, Burundi and Nigeria and has held\r\nnegotiations with Zambia, Angola, Ethiopia, the\r\nRepublic of the Congo and Chad.\r\nRussia has decided to contribute approximately\r\n$60 million to the 14th Replenishment of the\r\nInternational Development Association for 2006-2014.\r\nSub-Saharan African countries will receive some\r\n49 per cent of that amount.\r\nOur country continues to provide a preferential\r\ncustoms tariff regime for goods produced in African\r\ncountries. That promotes the expansion of our trade\r\n24\r\nA/60/PV.31\r\nwith African countries, which totalled $638 million in\r\nthe first nine months of 2004, an increase of\r\napproximately 25 per cent over the same period in\r\n2003.\r\nWe believe that investment in human resources is\r\nan important element of aid to the continent. That is\r\nwhy we assist African countries in the training of their\r\nnational staff. Every year, Russia provides over 700\r\nState-funded scholarships.\r\nRussia has become a more active donor country\r\nin providing emergency humanitarian aid. In 2004, we\r\nprovided bilateral humanitarian aid to Morocco and\r\nMali. Our partnerships with multilateral donors,\r\nprimarily the World Food Programme, is developing\r\nvigorously. Starting this year, Russia will make regular\r\ncontributions to the Programme’s humanitarian\r\nactivities.\r\nWe are aware of the urgency of the problems\r\nrelated to the spread of malaria in Africa. We approach\r\nthe issue not only from the medical point of view but\r\nalso from the standpoint of its negative impact on the\r\nsocial and economic development of the continent.\r\nThat is why we favour stepping up international efforts\r\nagreed within the United Nations to reduce the spread\r\nof that pandemic in Africa.\r\nIn accordance with that position, we have made\r\nmultifaceted health care aid to the continent an\r\nessential component of our assistance. In addition to\r\nour previous commitments to make voluntary\r\ncontributions of $20 million to the Global Fund to\r\nFight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the\r\nGovernment of the Russian Federation has decided to\r\ndouble that sum by raising our consolidated payment to\r\n$40 million by 2008. So far, we have transferred\r\n$15 million of that amount to the Fund. This year, we\r\ncompleted payment of the $8 million that we pledged\r\nto the Global Polio Eradication Initiative that in 2003-\r\n2004.\r\nMany experts acknowledge that Africa may not\r\nachieve its development goals by 2015. At the same\r\ntime, the international community has done a great deal\r\nthis year to show its solidarity with the continent.\r\nMany countries have made serious commitments to\r\nprovide assistance to the continent. The time has come\r\nto act on those promises. The Russian Federation, for\r\nits part, intends to help fulfil that task in every possible\r\nway.\r\nMr. Wang Guangya (China) (spoke in Chinese):\r\nThe Chinese delegation wishes to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his third consolidated report on progress in\r\nimplementation and international support for the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD)\r\n(A/60/178) and the Report of the Secretary-General’s\r\nAdvisory Panel on International Support for NEPAD\r\n(A/60/85).\r\nWe support the statement made by Jamaica on\r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nAfrica is part of our world, globalization having\r\nclosely linked all five continents. Global development\r\ncannot be achieved without Africa’s prosperity. From\r\nthe Millennium Declaration and NEPAD to the recent\r\n2005 summit, attention to Africa is being reflected in\r\nnew actions.\r\nWe are pleased to note that the African countries\r\nhave made enormous efforts to implement NEPAD.\r\nThey have adopted positive measures in the areas of\r\ninfrastructure, information and communication\r\ntechnologies, public health, education, the\r\nenvironment, tourism, agriculture, science and\r\ntechnology and industrialization. We highly appreciate\r\nall those endeavours. Over the past year, the\r\ninternational community’s attention and assistance to\r\nAfrica’s development have increased. Some developed\r\ncountries have made new commitments in terms of\r\nofficial development assistance to Africa and debt\r\nrelief. The developing countries have also made\r\nassistance to Africa an important part of South-South\r\ncooperation. All that shows that we have taken a major\r\nstep to promote Africa’s development.\r\nHowever, as noted in the report, implementing\r\nNEPAD remains a complex and painstaking process.\r\nAside from international support and the efforts of the\r\nAfrican countries themselves, we need to make far\r\ngreater efforts for the African continent, where help is\r\nneeded in all undertakings. African countries need to\r\nfurther strengthen their efforts to implement national\r\ndevelopment strategies. And the international\r\ncommunity should take effective measures of all kinds\r\nto assist and support African countries, including a\r\nsubstantial increase in aid. In this respect, we endorse\r\nthe useful recommendations contained in the report of\r\nthe Secretary-General.\r\nAs regards future international support to Africa\r\nin implementing NEPAD, the Chinese delegation\r\nwishes to emphasize the following points.\r\n25\r\nA/60/PV.31\r\nFirst, aid pledges should be fulfilled at an early\r\ndate. During this year’s summit, it was reiterated by all\r\nparticipants that the complexity of Africa’s\r\ndevelopment has become a poverty trap that cannot be\r\nbroken by Africa alone. Only by rendering huge and\r\ndiversified international support can we help Africa to\r\nescape its predicament. Whether because of historical\r\nobligations or deficiencies in the current international\r\neconomic order, the developed countries have\r\nresponsibilities that they cannot shirk. We commend\r\nthe pledges made by the European Union, the G-8 and\r\nother major developed countries to increase official\r\ndevelopment assistance to Africa and debt relief. But,\r\nthis only marks the first step. In their quest to reach the\r\nMDGs, the African countries and peoples are racing\r\nagainst time. We hope that the developed countries will\r\ndisplay the same sense of urgency and fulfil their\r\npledges at an early date so as to help African countries\r\nto solve urgent problems and build capacities for self-\r\ndevelopment.\r\nSecondly, vigorous efforts should be made to\r\nimprove monitoring. Africa’s own efforts and\r\ninternational support are the two major pillars of\r\nNEPAD. African countries have established a peer\r\nreview mechanism to conduct regular evaluation of\r\ntheir own efforts. To ensure more real results from\r\ninternational support, it is necessary to have\r\ncorresponding mechanisms to monitor implementation\r\nso as to produce more accurate and detailed reports and\r\nrelevant recommendations on progress achieved with\r\ninternational support.\r\nThirdly, country ownership should be respected.\r\nThe international community, in offering aid to Africa,\r\nshould trust the wisdom of African Governments and\r\npeoples and respect their choice of development path,\r\nso as to ensure the ownership, leadership and full\r\npolicy space of the recipient countries. This not only\r\nreflects the spirit of equality and mutual respect but is\r\nalso an important way to give play to Africa’s\r\ncreativity and tap its potential.\r\nFourthly, South-South cooperation should be\r\nexpanded further. In the process of development, the\r\ndeveloping countries have always understood and\r\nsupported each other. Under the current circumstances,\r\nSouth-South cooperation, based on marked progress\r\nalready achieved, will have even greater prospects. We\r\nare in favour of continued efforts to explore new ways\r\nfor South-South cooperation, exchange views, learn\r\nfrom each other and strengthen trade, investment and\r\ntechnical cooperation, thus enhancing Africa’s\r\ndevelopment.\r\nWhether it is in the past struggle for national\r\nindependence and liberation or in the present pursuit of\r\npeace and development, the Chinese people have\r\nalways stood firmly with the fraternal people of Africa.\r\nIt is an important component of China’s foreign policy\r\nto consolidate and develop friendly relations and\r\ncooperate with African countries, support and assist\r\nAfrican countries and peoples in economic\r\ndevelopment and social progress.\r\nAs an important step to reinforce South-South\r\ncooperation, China and African countries established\r\nthe China-Africa Cooperation Forum in 2000, which\r\nlaid down a comprehensive and detailed plan for\r\nChina-Africa cooperation. Its key areas are generally\r\nidentical with the priority areas of NEPAD.\r\nIn 2004, the Chinese Government signed loan\r\nagreements with 43 African countries, focusing on\r\nagricultural development, infrastructure, human\r\nresources training, medical care and public health. On\r\n1 January 2005, China instituted zero tariffs on some\r\ncommodities from the 25 least-developed countries in\r\nAfrica, covering 190 tariff lines. In 2004, China’s\r\ndirect investment in Africa reached $135 million, a\r\nrecord high for China’s annual direct investment in\r\nAfrica.\r\nAt the separate meeting on financing for\r\ndevelopment during this year’s summit, President Hu\r\nJintao announced five new measures for strengthening\r\nSouth-South cooperation, including increased aid to\r\ndeveloping countries for prevention and treatment of\r\nmalaria and other infectious diseases, debt cancellation\r\nfor the highly indebted poor countries, the wide-range\r\nthree-year training programme for 30,000 trainees from\r\ndeveloping countries and the three-year $10 billion\r\npreferential loan programme for developing countries.\r\nThe Chinese Government is ready to implement the\r\nrelevant programmes through the China-Africa\r\nCooperation Forum and other cooperation channels so\r\nas to support Africa in enhancing development and\r\nimplementing NEPAD.\r\nMr. Kumalo (South Africa): My delegation\r\nwishes to thank the Secretary-General for his reports\r\non the items we are discussing today. My delegation\r\nalso wishes to associate itself with the statements made\r\nby Jamaica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, by\r\nNamibia on behalf of the African Union and by\r\n26\r\nA/60/PV.31\r\nLesotho on behalf of the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community.\r\nWe are pleased that the Secretary-General has\r\nacknowledged in his report on the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) that there has been\r\ngreater international response in support of Africa’s\r\ndevelopment, including the mobilization of\r\ninternational public opinion. At the same time, the\r\nSecretary-General concludes that much more needs to\r\nbe done and that, therefore, international cooperation\r\nin support of NEPAD needs to be enhanced.\r\nThrough NEPAD, African leaders have not only\r\ntaken ownership and leadership of the continent’s\r\nsocio-economic renewal agenda but they have also\r\ntransformed the content of the development agenda and\r\nare making progress in changing the international\r\ncontext as well. The New Partnership is now just four\r\nyears old. The key principles of NEPAD remain\r\nAfrican ownership in the promotion of socio-economic\r\ndevelopment, the advancement of democracy,\r\npromotion of human rights and good governance.\r\nThrough NEPAD, African leaders have created a\r\ncomprehensive and holistic approach to development.\r\nThe NEPAD policies and priorities have resulted in an\r\ninternationally agreed framework for Africa’s\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe reports and recent indications show that\r\nimplementation of NEPAD programmes is poised to\r\naccelerate in the coming years. As we heard today from\r\nmany speakers, preparations and consultations — for\r\nexample for the rollout of the Comprehensive Africa\r\nAgriculture Development Programme — have been\r\nconcluded. African subregional communities and\r\nAfrican Governments have already identified high\r\npriority projects and early actions that need to be\r\nundertaken. African Governments have also committed\r\nthemselves to increasing national budget allocations\r\nfor agriculture to 10 per cent per annum over the next\r\nfive years. Good progress is also being made in the\r\nimplementation of other NEPAD programmes,\r\nincluding health, information and communications\r\ntechnologies, education, energy, environment, science\r\nand technology and gender issues.\r\nThe peer review process, as agreed by Africans,\r\nhas been designed by Africans themselves and is\r\ntherefore,  also African owned. Its principles have their\r\nroots in African traditions and processes that may not\r\nnecessarily translate easily to other situations. The\r\nAfrican Peer Review Mechanism enables each African\r\ncountry to assess the progress it is making towards the\r\nachievement of Africa’s shared goals. This is a country\r\nreview rather than merely a review of Government\r\nperformance. It takes into account the fact that national\r\ndevelopment in any country is driven by a multiplicity\r\nof social forces.\r\nThe African Peer Mechanism is, therefore,\r\nenabling rather than prescriptive, specifying objectives\r\nand standards and providing indicative definitions of\r\ncriteria and examples of indicators so as to ensure\r\nbroad coherence at the country level and uniformity at\r\nthe continental level.\r\nAt the end of September 2005, South Africa held\r\na two-day national consultative conference, where\r\ndelegates from government, business, trade unions,\r\nacademia and the entire spectrum of civil society\r\nlaunched the South African peer review process.\r\nConsistent with our Government’s commitment to a\r\npeople-driven process of progressive change, South\r\nAfrica supports the inclusive approach of the\r\nconclusions of the peer review process. This is\r\nespecially important, given that peer review will\r\nconclude with a programme of action to address\r\nwhatever shortfalls are identified by the review. In this\r\ncontext, our Government believes that it is essential\r\nthat all South Africans should own this programme of\r\naction and work towards implementing it.\r\nThis year marks an important milestone in the\r\nAfrican continent’s efforts to combat malaria. Five\r\nyears ago, African heads of State and Government\r\nsigned the Abuja Declaration and Framework for\r\nAction for the Fight Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis\r\nand Other Diseases, which committed their countries to\r\nreaching specific targets on malaria prevention and\r\ncontrol by 2005. Although much progress is being\r\nmade in the fight against malaria, major interventions\r\nare still needed. If uncontrolled, malaria will continue\r\nto be a major economic burden on African economies.\r\nStatistics already show that in one year malaria has\r\nclaimed the lives of 1 million people worldwide, 90 per\r\ncent of whom have been from Africa. Combating\r\nmalaria is possible only if there is concerted and\r\ncoordinated action among all stakeholders.\r\nMy delegation concurs with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s progress report on “Implementation of the\r\nrecommendations contained in the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the causes of conflict and\r\n27\r\nA/60/PV.31\r\npromotion of durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa” (A/60/182) that the African\r\nUnion has made substantial progress in conflict\r\nprevention on the continent. One of the key changes is\r\nthe way in which Africa is leading in the resolution of\r\nconflicts and managing peacebuilding by providing\r\nstrong leadership from African countries themselves.\r\nThe African Union has the primary responsibility\r\nfor the peace and security architecture on the continent,\r\nprimarily through the African Union’s Peace and\r\nSecurity Council. As the Secretary-General’s report\r\noutlined, socio-economic development is essential to\r\npeace and security, and therefore NEPAD’s role in\r\npeace and security relates to post-conflict\r\nreconstruction and to mobilization of the necessary\r\nresources. In that context, Africa is finalizing an\r\nAfrican Post-Conflict Reconstruction Policy\r\nFramework aimed at enhancing the capacities of all\r\ninternal actors. Detailed strategies for post-conflict\r\nreconstruction have been developed in consultation\r\nwith African experts and other development partners.\r\nMy delegation also concurs with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s reports that the main challenge remaining for\r\nthe development of Africa is the implementation of a\r\ntruly global and equitable partnership through the\r\nhonouring of the international community’s\r\ncommitments. It is therefore clear that despite all the\r\nactions and commitments of African countries and\r\ninstitutions themselves, the main constraint remains the\r\nlack of adequate resources for implementation.\r\nIn that regard, the global partnership for Africa’s\r\ndevelopment needs to change, among other things, by\r\nmeans of the manner in which the multilateral\r\ndevelopment financing institutions support\r\ninfrastructure development in Africa. It is also critical\r\nthat they create special mechanisms for the financing\r\nof subregional infrastructure projects.\r\nSecondly, the international community should\r\ntranslate promises into concrete actions, especially\r\nwith regard to the promised significant increases in\r\ndevelopment assistance flows and the harmonization\r\nand simplification of aid procedures. Our calculations\r\nindicate that pledges made, if fulfilled, would increase\r\nflows of official development assistance to Africa to\r\n$44 billion in 2010 and to $61 billion in 2015.\r\nAlthough that would be a significant increase, it would\r\nstill fall short of the amount required to meet the\r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs).\r\nThirdly, it is important to address the\r\nimpediments to the effectiveness of development\r\nassistance. We acknowledge that there is now a broad\r\nconsensus that such assistance has been compromised\r\nby a number of factors that have fuelled the perception\r\nthat Africa lacks the capacity to absorb and effectively\r\nuse increased funds. In reality, the problem is that\r\nfunding has often been provided piecemeal by\r\nindividual donors for single short-term programmes\r\nthat carry heavy transaction costs and often require the\r\ncreation of parallel infrastructures.\r\nFourthly, the debt cancellation movement —\r\nwhich began after exhaustive advocacy on the part of\r\nAfrican leaders and their partners at the Group of Eight\r\nsummit and which was recently confirmed at the\r\nannual board meetings of the World Bank and the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund — can only be applauded,\r\nand we hope it will be speedily implemented. NEPAD\r\nwill monitor the implementation of the initiative and\r\ncontinue to call for the extension of debt relief to all\r\nleast developed countries in Africa and for similar bold\r\nactions with regard to the trade-distorting agricultural\r\nsubsidies of developed countries.\r\nThe lack of concrete and sufficiently quantified\r\nand detailed African development strategies and action\r\nplans can no longer be cited as a reason for lack of\r\nprogress in a real partnership between Africa and the\r\ninternational community. Africa is doing its part, and it\r\nis now up to our international partners to join in that\r\ntrue partnership so that the lives of ordinary African\r\npeople can be improved.\r\nIn conclusion, South Africa calls on the\r\ninternational community to implement, in 2006, a\r\nconcrete programme of action, as called for in the\r\nMillennium Declaration and in the outcome document\r\n(resolution 60/1) of the 2005 world summit, so that\r\nAfrica can be assisted in achieving the MDGs by 2015.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.\r\n"
