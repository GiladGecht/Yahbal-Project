(Sweden)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAgenda items 66 and 47 (continued)\r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development: progress\r\nin implementation and international support\r\n(a) New Partnership for Africa’s Development:\r\nprogress in implementation and international\r\nsupport\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/60/178)\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/60/85)\r\n(b) Causes of conflict and the promotion of durable\r\npeace and sustainable development in Africa\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/60/182)\r\n2001-2010: Decade to Roll Back Malaria in\r\nDeveloping Countries, Particularly in Africa\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/60/208)\r\nMr. Løvald (Norway): This year has been one of\r\nunprecedented international attention to Africa’s\r\ndevelopment. Norway welcomes that. We are strongly\r\ncommitted to the fight against poverty, to working with\r\nAfrican countries and institutions and — together with\r\nour international partners — to promoting a reform\r\nagenda that can bring about positive changes for the\r\npeople of Africa. For that reason, we fully subscribe to\r\nthe Africa Action Plan, and will continue to play an\r\nactive role within the Africa Partnership Forum, in\r\nclose cooperation with our African partners and the\r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD).\r\nThe challenge is to sustain the level of\r\ninternational attention and ensure the implementation\r\nof the commitments made. Last week in London, the\r\nAfrica Partnership Forum took up the key role that it\r\nhas been assigned to monitor and advance\r\ncommitments affecting Africa’s development. Norway,\r\nas the country holding the co-chairmanship in 2006,\r\nintends to do its best to ensure that Africa Partnership\r\nForum can fulfil its role and develop a mutual\r\nmonitoring process to assess progress. The pioneering\r\nwork by the Economic Commission for Africa and the\r\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and\r\nDevelopment on mutual review of development\r\neffectiveness is an important contribution in that\r\ncontext.\r\nIn order to achieve our aims for Africa’s\r\ndevelopment, we will have to address a number of\r\nissues. First of all, we will have to reform the\r\ninternational framework conditions, which means debt\r\ncancellation and improved trade and investment\r\nregimes. Promising steps on debt relief have already\r\nbeen taken by the Bretton Woods institutions, and we\r\nlook forward to their implementation. To reduce\r\npoverty and achieve progress towards the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, the poorer countries in Africa\r\nmust also be able to acquire their own income, and that\r\ncan be achieved primarily through trade. Market access\r\nis thus crucial, and in that respect the successful\r\nconclusion of the ongoing Doha round in the World\r\n2\r\nA/60/PV.32\r\nTrade Organization negotiations is also essential for\r\nthe development agenda.\r\nBut we also need more and better aid. More of\r\nour efforts should be focused on the poorest countries,\r\nand donors should be far better at coordinating,\r\nharmonizing and aligning their assistance with the\r\nrecipient countries.\r\nWe appreciate the commitments of the Group of\r\nEight to double their aid to Africa by 2010, and urge\r\nall donor partners to make faster progress towards\r\nincreasing their official development assistance (ODA)\r\nwith a view to achieving the United Nations target of\r\n0.7 per cent of gross national income. Norway has\r\nalready made a commitment to increase Norwegian\r\nODA to 1 per cent of our gross national income, which\r\nalso means greater resources for Africa.\r\nImproving the quality and effectiveness of aid\r\nshould be an urgent concern for all partners. Norway is\r\nfully committed to the Paris Declaration on Aid\r\nEffectiveness, and we are in the process of reviewing\r\nour procedures to ensure that we can deliver on those\r\ncommitments.\r\nNorway is also committed to becoming a more\r\npredictable donor by introducing a system of multi-\r\nyear allocations to key partner countries and key\r\nUnited Nations organizations, by being more\r\ntransparent about financing scenarios and about which\r\nindicators may trigger reduced or increased allocation\r\nto our partner countries and by being a partner in joint\r\nassistance strategies, whereby financing scenarios are\r\npresented jointly with other donors, wherever possible.\r\nNorway is committed to aligning our support to\r\npartner countries’ poverty-reduction strategies, policies\r\nand systems by providing aid to the governmental\r\nsector through the treasury; providing an increasing\r\npart of the support to key partner countries as general\r\nbudget support and sector-wide programme support,\r\njointly with other donors; using partner countries’\r\nsystems for public finance management, reporting and\r\nprocurement, wherever those systems have an\r\nacceptable standard; and supporting capacity\r\ndevelopment on an untied basis, together with other\r\ndonors.\r\nNorway will contribute to increased aid\r\nefficiency by concentrating its cooperation on two or\r\nthree sectors by country and will work for\r\ncomplementarity among donors. It will pull out of\r\novercrowded sectors at our partner countries’ request.\r\nWe will accept the status of silent partner and delegate\r\nthe follow-up responsibility to another donor when\r\ndonor numbers by sector are high. We will replace our\r\nown country strategy and memorandum of\r\nunderstanding processes with participation in joint\r\nprocesses, as in Uganda, Zambia and Tanzania.\r\nOnly African countries themselves can ensure\r\nsustainable growth and development on the African\r\ncontinent. Even if we as donors, and the international\r\ncommunity as a whole, try to do all the right things in\r\ntrade, debt relief, aid and aid reform, we will still fail\r\nin reducing poverty and promoting growth if the\r\nAfrican countries themselves do not also play their\r\npart, especially in terms of fighting corruption and\r\npromoting good governance.\r\nWithout accountability, development performance\r\nwill not improve, and without performance,\r\ninternational commitments and increased aid cannot be\r\nsustained. For that reason, we are very pleased that\r\nmost African countries today are seriously trying to\r\naddress those issues and are working jointly towards\r\nreform in governance, not least within the framework\r\nof NEPAD and its African Peer Review Mechanism.\r\nNorway has, over the years, supported\r\nprogrammes for increasing the capacity of the African\r\nUnion (AU) to deal with peace and security, and we\r\nwill continue to do so. We believe that the new role\r\nplayed by AU for security and conflict management,\r\nthrough its Peace and Security Council and the African\r\nPeace Facility, has been a major contributing factor to\r\nreducing the level of armed conflict on the continent.\r\nThe AU itself has also taken on important and\r\ndifficult peacekeeping operations, in Burundi and,\r\nmore recently, in the Darfur region of the Sudan, which\r\nare combined with active diplomacy for peacemaking.\r\nWe commend those efforts and strongly support\r\ninternational endeavours to assist the AU with\r\nwhatever assistance, financial or logistical, may be\r\nrequired in that respect.\r\nWe also urge the parties to such conflicts,\r\nparticularly in Darfur, to work constructively with the\r\nmediators to resolve the outstanding issues so as to\r\nbring peace and stability to the people of that region\r\nwhere there is so much suffering. At the same time, we\r\nstrongly deplore and condemn the recent kidnappings\r\nand killings in Darfur of personnel of the African\r\nUnion Mission in Sudan, which seriously threatens\r\n3\r\nA/60/PV.32\r\nboth the peace efforts and international assistance to\r\nthe region.\r\nWe believe that the African Union, in close\r\ncooperation with NEPAD and the existing subregional\r\norganizations, can play an increasingly important role\r\nin enhancing economic cooperation and integration\r\nthroughout the African continent. That would represent\r\nan important impetus for Africa’s development and for\r\nthe realization of the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nNana Effah-Apenteng (Ghana): My delegation\r\nwarmly welcomes the reports by the Secretary-General\r\non which we are holding this joint debate on progress\r\nin the implementation of and international support for\r\nthe New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD) and on the causes of conflict and the\r\npromotion of durable peace in Africa. They give us a\r\npanoramic view of developments over the past year in\r\nthe contradictory spheres of development and conflict\r\non the African continent. The two issues are\r\ninterlinked, particularly in the African context, because\r\nno purposeful development programmes can be\r\npursued in an environment of violent conflict and\r\ninsecurity.\r\nThe untold suffering caused to vulnerable\r\nsegments of African society, namely, women, children\r\nand the aged, as the result of violent conflicts and the\r\nattendant desolation of vast expanses of fertile, arable\r\nland continues to make headlines in the international\r\nmedia and provoke our horror and dismay. It sets back\r\nthe clock of progress in the areas directly affected and\r\nundermines the collective effort to eradicate poverty\r\nand hunger from the African continent. Against this\r\ndismal backdrop, the urgency of consolidating the\r\nrequisite conditions for durable peace and development\r\nthroughout Africa cannot be overemphasized.\r\nThis debate comes soon after the conclusion of\r\nthe 2005 summit, at which the international community\r\nmade far-reaching and unambiguous commitments in\r\nvarious domains to help meet the special needs of\r\nAfrica. As stated in the Secretary-General’s report on\r\nthe causes of conflict and the promotion of durable\r\npeace and sustainable development in Africa, the two\r\nmajor threats to durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa are, first, economic and social\r\nthreats, including poverty, infectious diseases and\r\nenvironmental degradation, and, secondly, internal\r\nconflict, including civil war, genocide and other large-\r\nscale atrocities.\r\nConcerning the second threat, we wish to register\r\nour deep appreciation for the strengthening of the\r\ncapacity of the African Union (AU) to intervene in\r\nconflicts on the continent through the establishment of\r\nthe African Peace Facility, with funding by the\r\nEuropean Union to support AU peace operations and\r\ncapacity-building. The enhanced capacity of the AU\r\nshould, in our view, be complemented by a willingness\r\non the part of belligerent parties to use dialogue to\r\nensure successful mediation and peaceful resolution of\r\nconflicts by the AU Peace and Security Council.\r\nWe also wish to acknowledge the direct bilateral\r\ntechnical assistance and financial support provided by\r\nthe Group of Eight (G-8) countries, not only to the AU,\r\nbut to other subregional organizations, such as the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States, to\r\nbolster their efforts at conflict prevention and crisis\r\nmanagement. With the AU Peace and Security Council\r\nfirmly in place, we call for practical measures to fully\r\noperationalize the African peace and security\r\narchitecture, to enable the African Union to pursue a\r\nmore interventionist policy of conflict management in\r\nAfrica than in the past, with the support of the United\r\nNations system. In this connection, it is pertinent to\r\nmention the unambiguous commitments made by the\r\ninternational community in the 2005 summit outcome\r\ndocument to assist Africa in peacekeeping and the call\r\nfor the speedy implementation of practical measures to\r\nachieve the desired ends.\r\nThe elimination of economic and social threats,\r\nincluding poverty, infectious diseases and\r\nenvironmental degradation, is a fundamental objective\r\nof the New Partnership for Africa’s Development. The\r\nachievement of this objective, as acknowledged in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report, is a complex and\r\npainstaking process, requiring sustained coordination\r\nat national and subregional levels to ensure the\r\neffective implementation of the key priority areas of\r\nNEPAD. The challenges posed by the initiative in this\r\ndomain are formidable and will be addressed later. For\r\nnow, we wish to acknowledge the progress made in the\r\nvarious sectors discussed in the report.\r\nIt is quite clear from the report that a lack of\r\ntechnical capacity is one of the major impediments to\r\nbuilding and maintaining infrastructure in Africa. In\r\nthis regard, we welcome the efforts by the\r\nNEPAD Secretariat to expedite action on priority\r\nprojects, such as capacity-building for NEPAD\r\nimplementing agencies, including subregional\r\n4\r\nA/60/PV.32\r\neconomic communities, institutional coordination,\r\nmobilization of resources, information sharing and\r\nmonitoring.\r\nTo aid these efforts, we call for the speedy\r\nimplementation of the commitment by the international\r\ncommunity in the 2005 summit outcome document to\r\nsupport the building of an international infrastructure\r\nconsortium involving the African Union, the World\r\nBank and the African Development Bank, with NEPAD\r\nas the main framework, to facilitate public and private\r\ninfrastructure investment in Africa.\r\nThe health sector is one of the most daunting\r\npriority areas of NEPAD and we therefore note with\r\nsatisfaction the successful efforts of the NEPAD\r\nSecretariat and other parties in advocating policies,\r\nplans and projects within the African Union/NEPAD\r\nHealth Strategy, which has led various countries to use\r\nthat strategy in advancing their health plans. We also\r\nappreciate the concerted efforts that are being made to\r\ndeal with the problem of malaria in Africa. Yet, Africa\r\nis not out of the woods, since malaria is still considered\r\nthe major killer of children under the age of five. We\r\nalso commend the mainstreaming of HIV/AIDS\r\nprojects into the work of NEPAD programmes and\r\nwelcome the news that the provision of antiretroviral\r\ntreatment on the continent is expanding.\r\nWe are, however, dismayed by the precarious\r\nstate of health services throughout the African\r\ncontinent, caused by the massive exodus of trained\r\nhealth workers to seek better opportunities in\r\nindustrialized countries. The migration of skilled\r\nprofessionals poses special challenges to African\r\ncountries, especially as they have, in general, limited\r\nhuman resources. We share the view that, without a\r\nfunctional health system, most of the elements of\r\ndisease-based programmes cannot be effectively\r\ndelivered. We call for an imaginative solution to the\r\nproblem that takes into account the broader economic\r\nand political factors that influence many of the health\r\nproblems in Africa. In this regard, we endorse the\r\nrecommendation by the United Nations Economic\r\nCommission for Africa (ECA) that a third of the\r\nproposed increased development aid be allocated to\r\nhealth.\r\nWe are pleased to note that the Comprehensive\r\nAfrica Agriculture Development Programme\r\n(CAADP), which aims at improving agricultural\r\nproductivity and reducing hunger throughout the\r\ncontinent, registered some of the most significant\r\ndevelopments in the priority areas of NEPAD during\r\nthe year under review. In this regard, we wish to recall\r\nthe Maputo Declaration on Agriculture and Food\r\nSecurity in Africa, adopted in July 2003, and to exhort\r\nall African countries to work towards the goal of\r\nallocating 10 per cent of their national budgetary\r\nresources to agriculture within five years, as agreed.\r\nWe warmly welcome the financial support of $47\r\nmillion given to CAAPD by the United States and the\r\nother initiatives of support by the Department for\r\nInternational Development of the United Kingdom and\r\nthe International Fund for Agricultural Development\r\nfor the CAAPD agenda.\r\nIt is a source of deep satisfaction to us that the\r\npeer review panel has completed country reviews for\r\nGhana and Rwanda and presented the reports to the\r\nAfrican Peer Review Mechanism in Abuja for\r\ndiscussion. We acknowledge the complexities of the\r\npeer review process, particularly since this is the first\r\ntime such a review is being embarked upon in Africa.\r\nIn this regard, it would be useful for the peer review\r\npanel to collate the experiences of the pioneering\r\ncountries into guidelines to clarify the procedures of\r\nthe new peer review for the benefit of other countries\r\nthat have yet to undertake or complete the process. As\r\nnoted earlier, there are serious challenges clearly\r\nidentified in the Secretary-General’s report that need to\r\nbe addressed in order to enhance purposeful actions by\r\nAfrican countries and organizations.\r\nThe first is the dearth of capacity in the national\r\nand subregional institutions that have the task of\r\nimplementing NEPAD. This, in our view, calls\r\nfor urgent and targeted measures to equip the\r\ninstitutions concerned with the requisite technical\r\nexpertise and financial resources to enable successful\r\nimplementation of NEPAD programmes and projects.\r\nA second challenge is how to achieve greater\r\ncoherence and coordination between national\r\ndevelopment plans and NEPAD. This task is not easy\r\nand is closely linked to the issue of capacity-building.\r\nIt will require building a consensus implementation\r\ncommittee on a well focused list of NEPAD priorities\r\nand their national linkages through NEPAD focal\r\npoints within governmental structures.\r\nThe third major difficulty is the promotion of a\r\ngreater involvement of the private sector in the\r\nimplementation of NEPAD programmes and projects.\r\n5\r\nA/60/PV.32\r\nTo surmount this hurdle, the institutions involved in\r\nthe implementation of these programmes and projects\r\nshould undertake highly targeted marketing campaigns\r\nat various levels, on the basis of clear guidelines,\r\naimed at attracting private sector participation.\r\nWe welcome the unequivocal commitment made\r\nby the international community in the 2005 outcome\r\ndocument to provide coherent support for NEPAD\r\nprogrammes, particularly by facilitating approval of\r\nsuch programmes by the multilateral financial\r\ninstitutions.\r\nAs articulated by NEPAD, the channels for\r\nexternal resource flows to African countries are official\r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA), debt relief, trade and\r\nforeign investment.\r\nOn development assistance, there appears to be a\r\nnew determination to increase the volume of aid and to\r\nimprove its quality. However, we wish to reaffirm the\r\npoint made in the report of the Secretary-General that,\r\nnotwithstanding the increase in ODA to Africa, the\r\nchanging composition of aid flows means that there are\r\nfewer resources to support the goals of NEPAD and the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. That is due in part to\r\nthe fact that since 2001 the share of aid resources\r\ndevoted to technical cooperation, emergency aid and\r\ndebt forgiveness has risen, leading to a reduction of\r\nbudgetary support for development. In order to reverse\r\nthat trend and ensure that new pledges of increased aid\r\nlevels impact positively on development in Africa, we\r\nendorse the call for aid resources to be channelled to\r\nthe key programmes and sectors of NEPAD in a\r\nsustained, effective and timely manner.\r\nDebt relief needs to be a major area of\r\ncooperation between African countries and their\r\ndevelopment partners. We therefore welcome the\r\ncommitment by the international community to\r\npromote a comprehensive and durable solution to the\r\nproblem. In that regard, we are encouraged by the\r\nWorld Bank Development Committee’s endorsement,\r\nin Washington on 25 September, of the Group of Eight\r\nproposal to cancel 100 per cent of multilateral debt\r\nowed by 18 eligible heavily indebted poor countries,\r\n14 of which are African countries. We urge debt relief\r\nto be broadened to cover both multilateral and bilateral\r\ndebt for all low-income African countries and urge\r\nsubstantial debt relief for middle-income countries as\r\nwell.\r\nAs equitable trade is the key to long-term growth\r\nand development in Africa, it is lamentable to note that\r\nthis is the sector that has shown the least progress in\r\nthe year under review. Over the last 25 years, Africa’s\r\nshare of world exports has been declining, from\r\napproximately 6 per cent in 1980 to approximately 2\r\nper cent in 2004, for the continent as a whole. Sub-\r\nSaharan Africa’s share of world exports is estimated at\r\n1.5 per cent.\r\nThe World Trade Organization (WTO) Ministerial\r\nmeeting in Hong Kong in December should provide an\r\nopportunity for all WTO members, especially\r\nindustrialized countries, to demonstrate the sincerity of\r\nthe commitment they declared at the 2005 World\r\nSummit outcome document (resolution 60/1) to work\r\nexpeditiously towards implementing the development\r\ndimension of the Doha work programme. With specific\r\nreference to Africa, we wish to stress the importance of\r\nthe recommendation contained in the report of the\r\nSecretary-General (A/60/178) for the promotion and\r\nexpansion of initiatives such as the “aid for trade”\r\nagenda to help Africa’s efforts to diversify its\r\nproductive base and move away from commodities\r\ntowards semi-manufactured and processed goods.\r\nAs stated in the report, foreign direct investment\r\nflows to Africa are meagre and lopsided, with the\r\ngreater portion going to investment in natural resource\r\nexploitation, driven by a strong global demand. This\r\nsituation favours those countries richly endowed with\r\nnatural resources such as oil, gold and diamonds.\r\nWe share the expectation that successful\r\nefforts in capacity-building and investment in\r\nessential infrastructure — roads, electricity and\r\ntelecommunications — will boost the flow of foreign\r\ndirect investment to African countries, especially in\r\nexport-oriented manufacturing. In that connection, we\r\nlook forward with interest to the launching in October\r\nthis year of the Investment Climate Facility for Africa,\r\nwhich seeks to identify and overcome the obstacles\r\nhindering a business-friendly investment climate in\r\nAfrica.\r\nThrough its funds and programmes, the United\r\nNations system has been a bulwark in the advocacy for,\r\nand delivery of, international support to Africa. We\r\ncommend the institutional support increasingly\r\nprovided by the United Nations system to African\r\ncountries, the African Union, subregional organizations\r\nand NEPAD, and we call on the funds, programmes\r\n6\r\nA/60/PV.32\r\nand agencies of the United Nations to further improve\r\ntheir coordination of support for a more effective\r\nperformance. We also endorse the call for the\r\nestablishment of a mechanism for regular and\r\ncomprehensive consultations between the United\r\nNations system and the African Union to ensure a\r\nsmooth interface between the two organizations.\r\nIn conclusion, let me reaffirm the importance we\r\nattach to establishing mutual accountability as we\r\nawait the pledged increases in aid to Africa. We share\r\nthe view that accountability is imperative to generating\r\nmutual trust and ensuring improved development\r\nperformance and sustained aid increases. In that\r\nconnection, we look forward to the early\r\nimplementation of the decision to use the African\r\nPartnership Forum as an arena for identifying strategic\r\nissues to galvanize the implementation of NEPAD\r\npriorities, including the monitoring of commitments\r\nmade to support those priorities.\r\nMr. Mahiga (United Republic of Tanzania): I\r\nthank the Secretary-General for the third consolidated\r\nreport on progress in implementation and international\r\nsupport on the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD), contained in document\r\nA/60/178. We also wish to express our appreciation\r\nand gratitude to Mr. Ibrahim Gambari for his work in\r\nhis previous capacity as Special Adviser on Africa, as\r\nwell as his work on the implementation of NEPAD by\r\nthe United Nations system.\r\nTanzania associates itself with the statements\r\nmade by Namibia on behalf of the African Group,\r\nLesotho on behalf of the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community, and Jamaica on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China.\r\nSince its creation four years ago, NEPAD has\r\ncontinued to engage itself in priority programmes for\r\nrealizing its objectives. Its broad objective is\r\npromoting subregional and continental integration, the\r\nutilization of economies of scale, poverty eradication,\r\nthe realization of entrepreneurial potential and the free\r\nmovement of goods, services and factors of production\r\non the continent.\r\nAt the continental level, we welcome the\r\ninitiatives by the NEPAD secretariat, in collaboration\r\nwith the African Union Commission, in formulating\r\nimplementation strategies, in particular in the areas of\r\nimproving Africa’s competitiveness in international\r\ntrade by collectively negotiating for better market\r\naccess, increasing the quantity, quality and\r\neffectiveness of official development assistance,\r\npushing for debt cancellation and enhancing aid\r\ndelivery and the coherence and coordination of\r\ndevelopment assistance. In addition, an effort has been\r\nmade to improve food production, agricultural\r\nresearch, the dissemination of technology and the\r\ndevelopment of physical and social infrastructure, as\r\nwell as to spearhead interventions on HIV/AIDS,\r\nmalaria, tuberculosis and other communicable diseases.\r\nRecognizing the interlinkages between peace,\r\nsecurity and development, the NEPAD secretariat, in\r\ncollaboration with the African Union (AU), has\r\nprepared a joint AU-NEPAD peace and security\r\nagenda, outlining peace and security priorities, with a\r\nfocus on targeting conflict prevention and resolution,\r\nincluding the strengthening of peacekeeping\r\noperations. The African Union (AU) and subregional\r\norganizations such as the Economic Community of\r\nWest African States and the Intergovernmental\r\nAuthority on Development have undertaken significant\r\ninitiatives with respect to the conflicts in various\r\ncountries on the continent. The next step is to move\r\nbeyond peacekeeping and ensure durable peace and\r\ndevelopment under the NEPAD framework.\r\nIt is in that regard that we welcome the early\r\nestablishment of the Peacebuilding Commission, in\r\naccordance with the 2005 High-level Plenary Meeting\r\ndecision, because the Commission would address the\r\nspecial needs of countries emerging from conflict and\r\nmoving towards recovery and reconstruction and would\r\nassist them in laying the foundations for sustainable\r\ndevelopment and preventing a relapse into conflict.\r\nAfrica needs the Commission up and running as soon\r\nas possible to permit NEPAD programmes to be\r\nimplemented as part of post-conflict strategies.\r\nTanzania is pleased to be part of the 23 member\r\nStates of the African Union to have joined the African\r\nPeer Review Mechanism (APRM). Early this year,\r\nTanzania ratified the APRM, and its secretariat has\r\nalready been invited to start the review process in\r\nTanzania.\r\nThe Government of Tanzania has put in place\r\nsome important structures in line with APRM\r\nguidelines, including the implementation of legal\r\nsector reform programmes and the strengthening of the\r\njudicial system. Other initiatives strengthen\r\nmechanisms to fight corruption and establish the\r\n7\r\nA/60/PV.32\r\nHuman Rights and Good Governance Commission, the\r\nPrevention of Corruption Bureau, the Ethics Secretariat\r\nand the Good Governance Coordination Unit in the\r\nPresident’s Office.\r\nImportant as the issues of democracy and good\r\ngovernance are to Africa’s development, NEPAD\r\nshould make equally significant progress in\r\nimplementing tangible economic and social\r\nprogrammes that are already on its agenda. The\r\nchallenges and constraints outlined in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report must be overcome. All partners and\r\nstakeholders must live up to their commitments. The\r\nmomentum and the euphoria that NEPAD has\r\ngenerated must not be allowed to wane.\r\nImplementation of both the NEPAD objectives and the\r\nMillennium Project recommendations should coincide\r\nin order to realize the Millennium Development Goals\r\nin Africa and enable Africa to sustain its development\r\nbeyond 2015.\r\nTanzania has prepared priority programmes to\r\npromote and support NEPAD through private sector\r\ninvolvement, bilateral and multilateral support and\r\nregional cooperation. Some of those include the\r\nRuvuma River Unity Bridge, at the border between\r\nMozambique and Tanzania; the Mtwara corridor\r\nproject in the southern part of Tanzania, which has\r\neconomic integrating potential for both Mozambique\r\nand Malawi; the Zambia-Tanzania-Kenya power\r\ninterconnection programme and East African\r\nCommunity road development programmes.\r\nSome of the programmes have also been\r\nsubmitted to the secretariat of the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community (SADC) for consolidation\r\ninto regional ones. By virtue of its geographic location,\r\nTanzania has an obligation to provide transit facilities\r\nto neighbouring landlocked countries in the SADC\r\nregion and in the Great Lakes region of Central Africa.\r\nAssistance to Tanzania and NEPAD should therefore\r\nfactor in Tanzania’s historical role in that regard. It is\r\nmy Government’s expectation that, once approved at\r\nthe regional level, those projects will duly attract\r\ninternational attention and support.\r\nMr. Cabral (Guinea-Bissau), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nFinally, Tanzania welcomes a number of positive\r\ninitiatives that have been made this year to address the\r\nneeds of Africa. We note with appreciation the focus\r\nplaced on the special needs of Africa and NEPAD at\r\nthe Commission for Africa and the G-8, as well as by\r\nthe 2005 outcome document of the High-level Plenary\r\nMeeting (resolution 60/1). We also appreciate the\r\nexpressed interest and commitment to support NEPAD\r\nby the European Union, the Bretton Woods institutions,\r\nthe Nordic States, The Commonwealth and the Tokyo\r\nInternational Conference on African Development\r\n(TICAD) process, as well as the entire United Nations\r\nsystem.\r\nSouth-South cooperation in the entire spectrum of\r\ndevelopment has proved to be a most valuable\r\npartnership in implementing NEPAD programmes. We\r\nappreciate and encourage greater South-South\r\ncooperation.\r\nNEPAD has been heralded as a showcase of\r\nAfrica’s ownership of its development process. But the\r\ncontext has to remain international, as Africa is\r\ninextricably linked to the process of globalization, with\r\nall its benefits and challenges. The partnership has to\r\nbe a mutually reinforcing undertaking by all of Africa’s\r\npartners and friends, as expressed by the statements\r\nmade by various representatives today.\r\nMr. Gaspar Martins (Angola): My delegation\r\naligns itself with the statement made earlier by the\r\nrepresentative of Jamaica, on behalf of the Group of 77\r\nand China, the representative of Namibia, on behalf of\r\nthe African Group, and the representative of the\r\nKingdom of Lesotho, on behalf of the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community (SADC).\r\nAllow me to express through you, Mr. Vice-\r\nPresident, my Government’s profound gratitude to the\r\nSecretary-General for his third consolidated report on\r\nprogress in implementation and international support\r\nfor the New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD) (A/60/178). That report, along with others,\r\nprovides useful insight into the progress made and the\r\nmeasures needed to address the special needs of Africa.\r\nFour years have elapsed since the document that\r\noutlined NEPAD’s vision, principles and priorities was\r\nadopted by the Assembly of African Heads of State and\r\nGovernment. What followed was the preparation and\r\napproval of policy frameworks and strategic plans in\r\nthe following priority areas: the capacity of the African\r\nUnion to support peace operations; standards and\r\nguidelines for the African Peer Review Mechanism,\r\nwhich is NEPAD’s instrument for promoting good\r\ngovernance; NEPAD’s health strategy; the Education\r\nAction Plan now under review; the Comprehensive\r\n8\r\nA/60/PV.32\r\nAfrica Agriculture Development Programme; the\r\nShort-Term Action Plan for Infrastructure\r\nDevelopment; the Science and Technology Strategic\r\nPlan; the Environment Action Plan; the Tourism Action\r\nPlan and the African Productive Capacity Action Plan.\r\nThese frameworks and plans reaffirm the\r\nprinciples of African ownership and responsibility for\r\nthe continent’s development; the promotion and\r\nadvancement of democracy, human rights, good\r\ngovernance and accountable leadership; self-reliant\r\ndevelopment to reduce dependency on aid; the building\r\nof capacity in African institutions; the speeding up of\r\nregional economic integration; promoting the\r\nadvancement of women; strengthening Africa’s voice\r\nin international forums; and the forging of partnerships\r\nwith African civil society and the private sector.\r\nMy Government shares the Secretary-General’s\r\nassessment that in the past year “there have been\r\nimportant regional actions and greater international\r\nresponse in support of Africa’s development.”\r\n(A/60/178, summary) We note with satisfaction the\r\nengagement of national, subregional and regional\r\nefforts, including those of our partners and relevant\r\nstakeholders, in the implementation of projects\r\nencompassing the full range of priority areas identified\r\nby NEPAD. In some instances that engagement has\r\ntaken the form of facilitating the implementation of,\r\nand seeking support for, agreed actions with regard to\r\nbuilding the capacity of regional economic\r\ncommunities and national implementing authorities. In\r\nother instances that engagement has taken the form of\r\nthe African Development Bank’s financing of facilities.\r\nUnited Nations agencies and organizations\r\nremain important partners in advocating for, and the\r\ndelivery of, international support for Africa. The\r\nAssembly’s adoption of resolution 57/7 gave special\r\nmomentum to that process. In that regard, it is\r\nimperative to continue to take measures to strengthen\r\nthe Office of the Special Adviser of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on Africa, including through adequate staffing\r\nfor that Office, in order to enable it to effectively fulfil\r\nits mandate. In addition, we encourage United Nations\r\nfunds, programmes and specialized agencies to\r\nstrengthen coordination, cohesion and programming\r\nmechanisms as a means of enhancing support for\r\nAfrican countries.\r\nAnalysing the progress made in the\r\nimplementation of NEPAD is in many ways a test of\r\nthe international community’s commitment to address\r\nthe development and special needs of Africa. Its\r\nsuccess depends largely upon changes in the donor-\r\nrecipient relationship, in particular as it relates to\r\nimproving the role and impact of aid. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report provides us with information on\r\nactions taken thus far, but also clearly recognizes that\r\nmuch more still remains to be done. Allow me to\r\noutline a few of those areas.\r\nDuring the last year we were afforded an\r\nopportunity to welcome initiatives and commitments to\r\nsignificantly increase aid flows to Africa, including in\r\nparticular the very positive and encouraging decision\r\nof the European Union to establish a timetable to reach\r\nthe target of 0.7 per cent in official development\r\nassistance (ODA). We hope that other developed\r\ncountries will follow suit.\r\nHowever, according to the Organization for\r\nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD),\r\nincreases in the levels of ODA have not necessarily\r\nmeant equivalent increases in aid to Africa.\r\nFurthermore, an increasing percentage of aid to Africa\r\nis being allocated to non-development activities such\r\nas emergency relief and debt forgiveness. While those\r\nare important and necessary objectives, they should not\r\nundermine, or compete with, the support needed for the\r\nimplementation of development projects and\r\nprogrammes envisaged under NEPAD.\r\nIn addition, increases in ODA must be\r\naccompanied by actions aimed at scaling up aid\r\neffectiveness. NEPAD was conceived to enable\r\nownership, align support, harmonize efforts and ensure\r\nmutual accountability. It therefore represents a singular\r\nopportunity to make progress in these areas. In that\r\nregard, we welcome the signing of a common policy\r\nframework between the Tokyo International\r\nConference on African Development and NEPAD and\r\nthe New Asian-African Strategic Partnership.\r\nFurthermore, we encourage continued efforts with a\r\nview to the early approval of a common policy\r\nframework between the Group of Eight and NEPAD.\r\nDebt relief represents another opportunity for\r\nmeaningful and immediate assistance in support of\r\nAfrica’s development. Debt relief can play a key role\r\nin liberating resources that can be directed towards\r\nactivities consistent with NEPAD. We welcome the\r\nrecent proposals of the Group of Eight, and the\r\nsubsequent approval by the boards of the International\r\n9\r\nA/60/PV.32\r\nMonetary Fund and the World Bank, to cancel 100 per\r\ncent of the outstanding debt of eligible heavily\r\nindebted poor countries owed to the International\r\nMonetary Fund, the World Bank’s International\r\nDevelopment Association and the African\r\nDevelopment Fund, as well as to provide additional\r\nresources to ensure that the financing capacity of the\r\ninternational financial institutions is not reduced.\r\nHowever, we note with concern that many\r\nAfrican nations continue to struggle to find a durable\r\nsolution to their debt problems. The proposed debt\r\nrelief should therefore be broadened to cover all low-\r\nincome and middle-income African countries, where\r\ndebt relief can free up resources for the implementation\r\nof projects consistent with NEPAD that ultimately\r\ncontribute towards the attainment of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals and the implementation of national\r\ndevelopment strategies and programmes.\r\nMy delegation remains concerned about the\r\nlevels of foreign direct investment in Africa. Although\r\nsuch investment has recently increased, returning to\r\n2001 levels, it represents only 3 per cent of global\r\nforeign investment flows. Moreover, foreign direct\r\ninvestment tends to flow towards mineral-extraction\r\nindustries, which traditionally generate limited\r\nemployment and increase a country’s dependency on\r\nnatural resources. We are convinced that actions and\r\nsupport in capacity-building and infrastructure\r\ndevelopment can increase private investment flows into\r\nAfrica. In that regard, we look forward to the launching\r\nof an investment climate facility. We call upon Member\r\nStates to support it fully, as it is intended to identify\r\nand overcome obstacles to the creation and\r\nimprovement of a business-friendly investment climate\r\nin Africa. That will enhance Africa’s attractiveness to\r\nforeign direct investment.\r\nAngola has adopted its Poverty Reduction\r\nStrategy Paper, aimed at improving the macroeconomic\r\nframework and structural and social policies in order to\r\nfoster growth and reduce poverty. Angola stands ready\r\nto continue its participation in regional and subregional\r\nprogrammes that will enhance the capacity of African\r\ncountries to respond to African challenges and foster\r\npeace, stability and economic growth in the continent.\r\nThe Government of Angola is encouraged by the\r\nprogress made in the resolution and prevention of\r\nconflicts in Africa. In the past seven years there has\r\nbeen a significant reduction of conflicts in Africa.\r\nPromoting peace in Africa requires an integrated and\r\ncoordinated approach to address the nexus between\r\npeace, security, humanitarian aspects, development and\r\npost-conflict reconstruction and peacebuilding.\r\nAfrica’s capacity to harness opportunities for the\r\nestablishment of durable peace by deploying and\r\nundertaking effective peacekeeping operations must be\r\nsupported. In that regard, we call upon the international\r\ncommunity, including the United Nations, to scale up\r\nsupport to the African Union towards that end, as well\r\nas with regard to the establishment of an early warning\r\nsystem.\r\nPost-conflict reconstruction is understood as a\r\ncomplex system that provides for simultaneous short-,\r\nmedium- and long-term programmes to prevent\r\ndisputes from escalating and to avoid a relapse into\r\nviolent confrontation. Post-conflict reconstruction is\r\nultimately aimed at addressing the root causes of\r\nconflict and lays the foundations for social justice and\r\nsustainable peace. The continent is currently preparing\r\nan African post-conflict reconstruction policy\r\nframework that integrates the areas of security,\r\npolitical transition, governance, participation, socio-\r\neconomic development, human rights, justice,\r\nreconciliation, coordination, management and resource\r\nmobilization to provide a common framework for post-\r\nconflict situations, given their multidisciplinary,\r\nmultifunctional and multidimensional nature. It is\r\nessential that the international community support, and\r\nparticipate in, that undertaking. In that regard, we\r\nwelcome the decision to establish a Peacebuilding\r\nCommission. We look forward to its early\r\noperationalization to tackle the root causes of conflict\r\nin Africa.\r\nBefore concluding, allow me to welcome the\r\nestablishment of new initiatives to control malaria.\r\nSuch initiatives as the World Bank Booster Project, the\r\nUnited States Government’s new international malaria\r\ninitiative and the Malaria Control and Evaluation\r\nPartnership in Africa hold the promise for increased\r\nfunding to tackle a preventable disease. While so-\r\ncalled quick wins can help to control the disease,\r\ngreater emphasis must be placed on strengthening\r\nhealth systems and developing human resources, which\r\nare ultimately responsible for programme planning and\r\nimplementation. We wish to take this opportunity to\r\nthank Governments, in particular that of the United\r\nStates, as well as the World Health Organization, for\r\ntheir important contribution to that end in Angola.\r\n10\r\nA/60/PV.32\r\nI wish to conclude by quoting the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report on NEPAD: “This is a moment of\r\nopportunity for making progress in Africa’s\r\ndevelopment[,] for which NEPAD is the main policy\r\nframework” (Ibid., para. 59).\r\nMs. Rispal (France) (spoke in French): Last year\r\nat the General Assembly, we expressed the hope that\r\n2005 would be the year of development, and thus the\r\nyear of Africa. I believe that today we can say we were\r\nsuccessful. The challenges are of course great, but we\r\ncan be proud of what has been achieved in recent\r\nmonths. When I say “we”, that of course means, above\r\nall, African countries themselves. The conclusions of\r\nthe July 2005 Sirte summit of the African Union\r\nbolstered the efforts made in recent years, but Africa’s\r\npartners and the United Nations system have also done\r\ntheir part. France generally shares the analysis and\r\nrecommendations contained in the report of the\r\nSecretary-General (A/60/178).\r\nThis morning, the representative of the United\r\nKingdom, whose country currently holds the\r\npresidency of the European Union, underscored the\r\nvery considerable resources that Europeans have\r\npledged to devote to support African countries. That\r\nexceptional mobilization illustrates, were there a need\r\nto do so, how, more than ever before, Africa is at the\r\nvery centre of European development policy.\r\nFrance’s efforts are of course in keeping with\r\nthat. France has endorsed NEPAD’s priorities and has,\r\nas a result, reassessed its official assistance. This\r\nmorning we distributed in the Hall a publication\r\noutlining the main points of that effort.\r\nAt Gleneagles, the Group of Eight (G-8) also\r\ncontinued to provide its resolute contribution vis-à-vis\r\nAfrica, as it has done for several years. I wish also to\r\nmention the renewed commitment of the World Bank,\r\nwhose Development Committee has just endorsed the\r\nG-8 Africa Action Plan.\r\nAs part of its international efforts, the Africa\r\nPartnership Forum — which brings together all\r\ninterested players — provides an indispensable venue\r\nfor dialogue and joint action.\r\nLastly, the High-level Plenary Meeting of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, recently held in New York, has\r\nenshrined that international mobilization. All of us here\r\nare aware of the highlights of the outcome document\r\n(resolution 60/1). They relate to momentum for the\r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), support for\r\nAfrica and its priorities and financing for development,\r\nand also include decisions taken for peace and security,\r\nsuch as the support plan for the African Union, the\r\nfight against trafficking in small arms and light\r\nweapons and the Peacebuilding Commission.\r\nNo one is better placed than the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly to know that the time has now come\r\nfor implementation in all forums and in all areas. In\r\nthis respect, let me highlight four specific points. First,\r\nin the area of peace and security, African institutions\r\nare steadily growing stronger, and France is actively\r\ncontributing to this. It is currently modernizing its own\r\narrangements to adapt them to new African realities.\r\nFrance strongly supports the growing commitment of\r\nthe European Union in this area. We still need to\r\nimprove the predictability and the coordination of\r\ninternational support. Last year during the discussion\r\nof this matter, France proposed that the international\r\ncommunity establish a mechanism to support countries\r\nemerging from conflict. A decision has now been\r\ntaken: we need to establish the Peacebuilding\r\nCommission in the weeks to come.\r\nSecondly, everything needs to be done to enable\r\nall African countries to move towards sustainable\r\ndevelopment. The work in this area is vast and\r\nimportant. We support it in all the forums I have\r\nmentioned. Let me highlight here two specific\r\npriorities. First of all, I would mention the fight against\r\nAIDS. We absolutely need to achieve the goal of\r\nuniversal access to treatment by 2010. France hopes\r\nthat the special session of the General Assembly to be\r\nheld in June 2006 will adopt a specific road map\r\ntailored to each country.\r\nThe protection of natural resources is another\r\npriority. The degradation of the environment has\r\nclearly become one of the major obstacles to\r\ndevelopment. This change, which is clearly seen in\r\nAfrica, calls for an appropriate response from the\r\nUnited Nations. This is why France, along with others,\r\nbelieves that the time has come to think about a United\r\nNations organization for the environment, based on the\r\nUnited Nations Environment Programme, which would\r\nbe the lead specialized institution, with its headquarters\r\nin Africa, in Nairobi.\r\nThe third point relates to financing for\r\ndevelopment. Progress in this area has been spectacular\r\nand has demonstrated the viability of the Monterrey\r\n11\r\nA/60/PV.32\r\npartnership, which in addition draws greatly upon the\r\nprinciples of the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD). France welcomes in particular\r\nthe commitments taken recently with respect to official\r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) and debt cancellation.\r\nWe need to deepen our thinking on debt sustainability\r\nand on taking into account the outside shocks that are\r\ntoo frequent in Africa.\r\nLet us make two additional comments. We know\r\nthat to achieve the Millennium Goals we will need\r\nnew, more stable and predictable resources. The work\r\non innovative sources, of which the summit took note,\r\nis entering a concrete phase with the implementation\r\nby a number of countries of an International Finance\r\nFacility pilot project and a levy on aeroplane tickets.\r\nFrance is taking part in these two initiatives. A\r\nministerial conference will be held in Paris in February\r\nto move forward on the modalities for implementation.\r\nTrade clearly plays a key role. We need to do\r\neverything to ensure that development continues to be\r\nthe aim of the Doha round and that all developing\r\ncountries, including African countries, truly benefit\r\nfrom its outcome. The European Union has made\r\nambitious proposals to that end. France is pleased that\r\nnegotiations are truly under way.\r\nMy final point has to do with the United Nations.\r\nWe are convinced that the United Nations agencies\r\nhave a fundamental role to play in development on the\r\nground and in terms of the global debate. The summit\r\nclearly confirmed this. The agencies, however, need to\r\ncontinue to adapt to meet the new development\r\nchallenges, first of all in Africa, where the MDGs are a\r\nspecial challenge. The United Nations Development\r\nGroup needs to continue its efforts towards\r\nestablishing consistent United Nations strategies for\r\neach country.\r\nThe task is vast, but the movement is under way.\r\nWe need to continue to be mobilized and remain\r\nresolved, so that the commitments taken become a\r\nreality and expectations are not dashed. We know that\r\nthe President of the General Assembly is personally\r\ncommitted to this.\r\nMr. Bennouna (Morocco) (spoke in French): The\r\nMoroccan delegation welcomes this discussion on the\r\nimplementation of the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) and we wish, accordingly, to\r\nassociate ourselves with all of those who have spoken\r\nearlier and to reaffirm our commitment to NEPAD.\r\nThis must be stated time and again.\r\nWe thank the Secretary-General for his report\r\n(A/60/178), which once again gives us a clear account\r\nof the endeavours of the African countries primarily\r\nconcerned to execute the priorities and objectives of\r\nNEPAD and also of the support given to them by the\r\ninternational community. The Moroccan delegation\r\nassociates itself with the statement made by the\r\ndelegation of Jamaica on behalf of the Group of 77 and\r\nChina and with the statement made by the\r\nrepresentative of Namibia on behalf of the African\r\nGroup.\r\nAs noted by the Secretary-General in his report,\r\nAfrica has benefited from an unprecedented\r\nmobilization of international public opinion. The\r\nissuance of the report of the Secretary-General’s\r\nAdvisory Panel on International Support for NEPAD\r\n(A/60/85), Jeffrey Sachs’s Millennium Project report\r\n(A/59/727) and the report of the United Kingdom’s\r\nCommission for Africa, and the launching of a number\r\nof private initiatives, have greatly contributed to\r\nframing the problem and drawing attention to Africa’s\r\nneeds in the area of development.\r\nFor our part, since 2003, when we chaired the\r\nGroup of 77, we had stressed the need to convene a\r\nsummit to assess the state of implementation of the\r\nMillennium Goals and to place the interests of Africa\r\nat the centre of the discussion. Happily, the recent\r\nsummit yielded specific and positive decisions to assist\r\nthe African continent. It was decided to increase\r\nofficial development assistance (ODA) to Africa by\r\n$25 billion per year by 2010 and to provide all the\r\nnecessary support to the implementation of NEPAD. At\r\nthe same time, the commitment of most of the\r\ndeveloped countries to set a timetable for attaining the\r\nobjective of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for\r\nODA will, we hope, secure a degree of continuity in\r\nthe availability of financial support to our African\r\nbrothers. An increase in assistance would go hand in\r\nhand with an international effort to enhance aid\r\neffectiveness. In this regard, we support the\r\nimplementation of the Paris Declaration and the\r\nMarrakesh Declaration in order to enhance aid\r\neffectiveness for the benefit of the populations\r\nconcerned. However, I should like to note that a large\r\npart of such assistance is, unfortunately, still granted in\r\nthe form of debt relief and does not really represent\r\nnew resources for financing implementation of the\r\n12\r\nA/60/PV.32\r\nMDGs. At the same time, innovative sources of\r\nfinancing, as has been stated, will provide additional\r\nresources and will help to support efforts aimed at\r\nachieving the MDGs in Africa.\r\nWe welcome the launching of the International\r\nFinance Facility for immunization as well as the\r\nplanned levies on airline tickets, which Morocco has\r\nofficially endorsed in full. It is our hope that other\r\ncountries will be able to join in these efforts. There is\r\nno doubt that the success of these initiatives will have\r\nan impact on the lives of millions of people living in\r\npoverty and despair.\r\nMoreover, the commitment of our developed\r\npartners to resolve the problems of indebtedness of\r\nAfrican countries is another example of solidarity with\r\nour African brethren that we welcome. The approval by\r\nthe World Bank and the International Monetary Fund\r\nof the Group of Eight (G-8) proposal to cancel 100 per\r\ncent of the multilateral debt of highly indebted poor\r\ncountries is a significant decision, in line with the\r\ncourse mapped out by the Monterrey Consensus and\r\nthe recent world summit in New York. We welcome\r\nthat decision and encourage the international\r\ncommunity, and the donor community in particular, to\r\nstrive to find solutions to the problems of indebtedness\r\nof all low- and middle-income African countries,\r\nwhich could, we hope, benefit from a substantial\r\nreduction in their debt.\r\nThe endorsement of the G-8 Africa Action Plan\r\nby the World Bank Group has also focused the\r\ninternational community’s attention more strongly on\r\nthe efforts and difficulties of African countries in the\r\nstruggle against poverty. That, we hope, will lead to an\r\nincrease in financial support and investments capable\r\nof speeding up the attainment of the MDGs within the\r\nestablished time frame. We call on the World Bank to\r\nimplement the Action Plan as soon as possible.\r\nFor reasons associated with both geography and\r\nhistory, over the centuries Morocco has had\r\nrelationships based on economic and cultural\r\nexchanges with all its sub-Saharan brothers. In recent\r\nyears we have launched a number of initiatives based\r\non NEPAD priority areas to establish — together with\r\nthe private sector — genuine South-South partnerships\r\nthat stress sustainable development in such priority\r\nsectors as agriculture, education, health, the training of\r\nmanagers and the exchange of experience and expertise\r\nin various fields.\r\nSince we believe that human capital is the\r\nessential underpinning of any strategy of sustainable\r\nsocio-economic development, the Kingdom of\r\nMorocco has made the training of African managerial\r\npersonnel the cornerstone of its cooperation policy\r\nwith all the countries of the continent. Thus, the\r\ntraining of African managers has been a key facet of\r\nthe activities of the Moroccan international cooperation\r\nagency. Many managers have been trained through\r\nacademic and technical courses at Moroccan\r\nuniversities and now carry out responsible functions in\r\ntheir own countries. For example, from 2002 to 2005\r\napproximately 7,000 foreign students from 55\r\ncountries — 80 per cent of them from sub-Saharan\r\nAfrica — enrolled in Moroccan public education\r\nestablishments at the university, technical and\r\nprofessional level. More than 4,800 of those received\r\nscholarships or grants from our cooperation agency.\r\nTechnical cooperation is also an important focus\r\nof our policy of cooperation with our African brothers.\r\nAs we have considerable expertise and know-how in\r\nthe area of technical cooperation with the countries of\r\nsub-Saharan Africa, Morocco has assisted in the\r\nimplementation of many programmes for the benefit of\r\nsub-Saharan African countries financed by various\r\nagencies, including the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme and the Food and Agriculture Organization\r\nof the United Nations. We also collaborate with\r\nregional and international donors in tripartite\r\ncooperation programmes to assist countries of sub-\r\nSaharan Africa, as attested to by the five-year\r\nMorocco-Japan programme for francophone countries,\r\nwhich covers maritime fisheries, commercial shipping,\r\nroad maintenance and drinking water, as well as a\r\nspecial programme on food security in Burkina Faso.\r\nRecently cross-sectoral activities have been carried out\r\nin all those areas.\r\nLastly, as regards trade, I would underscore\r\nMorocco’s commitment to the least developed\r\ncountries in Africa. We allow those countries duty-free\r\naccess to our markets, which has led to a considerable\r\nincrease in exports from those countries to Morocco.\r\nWe would encourage other developing countries to do\r\nthe same so as to assist the poorest countries to escape\r\nfrom the trap in which they find themselves.\r\nFaithful to the principle of solidarity, which has\r\nalways inspired our policies, and in favour of genuine\r\ncooperation through concrete projects, my country is\r\ndoing its utmost, within its means, to respond to the\r\n13\r\nA/60/PV.32\r\nrequests of fraternal countries for expertise and\r\ntechnical assistance. Morocco will also pursue its\r\nefforts to facilitate the expansion of economic and\r\ntrade relations with its African partners. We remain\r\ncommitted to promoting South-South cooperation and\r\nattaining the objectives and priorities of NEPAD\r\nthrough targeted economic and social projects that\r\nhave a real impact on people’s lives.\r\nMr. Baali (Algeria) (spoke in French): My\r\ndelegation considers that the Secretary-General’s two\r\nreports provide a good basis for our deliberations on\r\nthe causes of conflict in Africa (see A/60/182) and for\r\nour annual review of progress in implementation of and\r\ninternational support for the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) (see A/60/178). Those\r\nreports once again highlight the complexity of the\r\nmultisectoral and interdependent challenges facing\r\nAfrica. They identify two types of threats to\r\nsustainable peace and development in Africa that\r\nundermine all efforts to pull the continent out of its\r\ndifficult situation: those of an economic nature — such\r\nas poverty, endemic disease, degradation of the\r\nenvironment; and those related to crises and conflicts\r\nwith their accompanying atrocities, victims and\r\ndisplaced persons. Indeed, for our part we would add\r\nthe lack of structuring in aid and in international\r\nsupport mechanisms, which are often only set up long\r\nafter humanitarian tragedies have unfolded. The issues\r\nbefore us are similar in many ways. It is therefore\r\nappropriate to consider them together, for issues of\r\npeace and development are closely interlinked and\r\nshould often be understood in a holistic way.\r\nWith respect to security, which continues to be\r\nthe key element in the maintenance of peace and for\r\nlong-term development, we support the\r\nrecommendations in the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the causes of conflict and the promotion of\r\ndurable peace and sustainable development in Africa.\r\nThey underscore the absolutely crucial necessity of\r\nallocating additional resources — human and\r\nfinancial — to strengthen the capacity and\r\neffectiveness of African Union (AU) peacekeeping\r\noperations in Darfur, Burundi and Somalia. In that\r\nconnection, Algeria welcomes the establishment of the\r\nAU Peace and Security Council in 2004, which, with a\r\nresponsible, coordinated approach, pools African\r\nconflict prevention and conflict settlement capacities.\r\nThat body is now operational and African contingents\r\nare already active on the ground, particularly in Darfur.\r\nTo achieve that, the AU has naturally drawn on the\r\nexperience and expertise of the United Nations in the\r\narea of peacekeeping operations, closely cooperating\r\nwith the Departments of Peacekeeping Operations and\r\nof Political Affairs, as well as with the Security\r\nCouncil, as reflected in today’s Council meeting on\r\nCôte d’Ivoire (see S/PV. 5278).\r\nIn a complementary approach, but one that is just\r\nas vital, the NEPAD Secretariat has been mandated by\r\nthe African Union to work out a strategic framework\r\nfor post-conflict reconstruction of countries affected by\r\ncrisis or conflict. This responsibility, as underscored by\r\nthe report, is in no way an easy task. The African\r\nUnion needs, as a result, to be able to count on steady,\r\nmultifaceted support from United Nations agencies,\r\nparticularly the Peacebuilding Commission, which is to\r\nbe established by the end of the year, and the ad hoc\r\nadvisory groups. Similarly, the contribution from donor\r\ncountries and other development partners, in terms of\r\nadditional financial resources and appropriate technical\r\nassistance, is greatly desired, as it would be in line\r\nwith a desire to have greater effectiveness in terms of\r\nneeds, as previously identified by NEPAD.\r\nWith respect to aspects tied to development, my\r\ndelegation supports overall what is stated in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report, where he draws in\r\nparticular on the analysis and conclusions of the\r\nAdvisory Panel on International Support for the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development, and we believe\r\nthat those conclusions are fully relevant.\r\nThe assessment made by that Advisory Panel\r\nhighlights that, that since the second report of 2004 on\r\nthe same subject and despite the considerable\r\ninitiatives that have emerged since that time, such as\r\nthe decision of the Group of Eight (G-8) countries in\r\nterms of debt relief and official development assistance\r\n(ODA) and the support graciously offered by other\r\ncountries, Africa still has needs, because much remains\r\nto be done.\r\nIf we want NEPAD, which was established by\r\nAfrican leaders four years ago and which is gradually\r\nbecoming an important player and a vital framework\r\nfor any action to strengthen or support efforts at peace,\r\nreconstruction or sustainable development for Africa\r\nand if we want NEPAD to avoid the fate of other\r\nattempts in the past, it is urgent and necessary to\r\ngreatly increase the level of ODA, to attack the debt\r\nproblem more resolutely and to encourage foreign\r\n14\r\nA/60/PV.32\r\ndirect investment (FDI) in Africa in order to enable\r\nthat continent to achieve robust, sustained growth and\r\nto be integrated into the global economy.\r\nIn terms of the implementation of programmes\r\nfor Africa, a brief look at the structure of spending tells\r\nus that much of the expenditure is actually being\r\nabsorbed by humanitarian needs, thereby leaving a\r\ngreatly reduced margin for support for reconstruction\r\nefforts. There can be no lasting peace in societies that\r\nare either openly or latently affected by poverty,\r\nunemployment, famine or disease.\r\nIn the African context, nothing better illustrates\r\nthe commitment of Africa to strengthen the stability\r\nand peace that are necessary to its development than\r\nthe establishment within NEPAD of an African Peer\r\nReview Mechanism. This Mechanism submits African\r\ncountries that have voluntarily signed up to it to a\r\nreview on compliance with agreed standards in terms\r\nof governance and democracy. Through their\r\ncommitment to this approach, African countries are\r\ndemonstrating their commitment to establish the basis\r\nfor an African society that is open to the world and\r\nperfectly integrated — that is, respectful of human\r\nrights and imbued with democratic values and good\r\ngovernance. It is this vision of a remodelled Africa that\r\nNEPAD is seeking to promote via a comprehensive\r\nstrategy and ambitious and productive programmes.\r\nThe many reasons listed in the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on NEPAD to explain the lack of\r\nprogress made in terms of development amount to\r\nessentially two types of factors, those that are internal,\r\nsuch as political instability, insecurity, the lack of basic\r\nphysical infrastructure, small markets and the low rate\r\nof flows of trade among African countries themselves;\r\nand then there are the external reasons, such as\r\nongoing discriminatory rules and obstacles to trade\r\nfacing Africa, as well as the slow pace of disbursement\r\nof resources that are due or have been pledged to\r\nsupport efforts on the part of the international\r\ncommunity, particularly with respect to the priorities\r\ndefined by NEPAD.\r\nOn the whole, I share this analysis, but let me\r\nmake two comments. With respect to the private sector,\r\nthe report emphatically highlights the role of that\r\nsector as a motor for development, for creating jobs\r\nand for producing exports. From this standpoint,\r\nAlgeria is one of those countries that believe that there\r\nis a need to place the private sector at the very centre\r\nof economic activities as a key driving force for growth\r\nand development. However, we do need to point out\r\nthat, given that the private sector is essentially driven\r\nby the quest for profit, it would not be reasonable to\r\nfully replace ODA by private investment.\r\nThe other point where we have serious\r\nmisgivings has to do with the assertion that a reduction\r\nin agricultural subsidies in the European Union\r\ncountries and in the United States would be harmful to\r\nmany African countries, which are net importers of\r\nagricultural products. This assertion does not seem to\r\ntake into account the importance of agriculture in many\r\nAfrican economies, most of which are export-driven\r\nand, therefore, suffer from these subsidies given by\r\nEuropean countries and the United States to their\r\nagricultural sectors.\r\nOur heads of State and Government, who met last\r\nSeptember for the five-year review of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, gave special attention to Africa\r\nand NEPAD in their consensus document. They laid\r\nout the framework and identified actions to be\r\nundertaken in order to assist in the development of\r\nAfrica in general and to implement NEPAD\r\nprogrammes in particular, both by working to provide\r\nthe ongoing coordinated support needed and by\r\nassisting African countries to mobilize considerable\r\nfinancial resources to ensure the development of the\r\ncontinent and the implementation of programmes. The\r\nUnited Nations system has a road map and clear\r\nobjectives that it needs to achieve. To do this, it needs\r\nto improve the quality and effectiveness of its\r\nprogrammes and step up its efforts to complement the\r\naid that it is providing to Africa with appropriate\r\nadvocacy and financing activities.\r\nMr. Mantovani (Italy): Italy fully aligns itself\r\nwith the statement made by the representative of the\r\nUnited Kingdom on behalf of the European Union and\r\nwholeheartedly supports the lines of action in support\r\nof Africa presented in that statement. As Italy’s\r\nnational contribution to today’s debate, I wish to make\r\na few additional remarks.\r\nLet me first thank the Secretary-General, as well\r\nas the Special Adviser on Africa, for the latest reports\r\non the New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD) and the causes of conflict in Africa, which\r\nprovide a most useful background to our debate and\r\nwhose conclusions and recommendations we share.\r\n15\r\nA/60/PV.32\r\nThis debate is the first opportunity for the\r\nGeneral Assembly to assess the outcome of the United\r\nNations summit from an African perspective and to\r\nfollow up the commitment to address the special needs\r\nof Africa that were solemnly made by our heads of\r\nState and Government. The views expressed today,\r\nparticularly those by African Member States, remind us\r\nof the need to pursue all efforts to advance the\r\ndevelopment agenda and provide useful input to our\r\nOrganization, especially now, as the United Nations\r\naddresses the challenge of how to ensure the\r\nimplementation of the outcome document in all its\r\ncomponents.\r\nThis annual debate also provides a unique\r\nopportunity for the United Nations to assess the\r\nprogress made in the implementation of NEPAD and\r\nthe support provided by the international community.\r\nItaly is glad to acknowledge that a large number\r\nof African countries continue to make substantial\r\nprogress in both the development and the security\r\nareas, as highlighted in the Secretary-General’s two\r\nreports. NEPAD policies continue to be implemented in\r\nthe areas of infrastructure, information and\r\ncommunication technology, health, education,\r\nenvironment, tourism, agriculture and industry. Indices\r\nshow sustained growth for a higher number of\r\ncountries than in the recent past.\r\nThe African Peer Review Mechanism is now\r\nfully in place. The countries of the continent are\r\nincreasingly aware of the importance of good\r\ngovernance and the rule of law. The number of major\r\nconflicts is decreasing. Democracy is flourishing, and\r\nfree and fair elections are successfully taking place in\r\nmany parts of the continent. Finally, the African Union\r\nand African subregional organizations have assumed a\r\nleadership role in their respective areas of competence,\r\nparticularly in those of peace and security.\r\nAfrica’s partners have also enhanced their\r\nsupport for NEPAD following a number of important\r\nsteps taken by the United Nations, the European Union\r\nand the Group of Eight (G-8), as well as within the\r\ncontext of South-South cooperation. What the\r\nSecretary-General calls “unprecedented mobilization of\r\ninternational public opinion in support of Africa”\r\n(A/60/178, summary) has also played a major role,\r\nwhich we must continue to keep alive through\r\nappropriate communication strategies. However, we\r\nshould be realistic. For Africa to achieve the\r\nMillennium Development Goals by the date that has\r\nbeen set, and in order to take advantage of the\r\nmomentum generated by the recent summit, efforts\r\nmust be redoubled, commitments must be honoured\r\nand implementation must be ensured.\r\nItaly will continue to contribute substantially to\r\nthose efforts, both bilaterally and multilaterally. Let me\r\njust mention some of the areas where my Government\r\nhas focused its recent efforts.\r\nWe have cancelled $2.8 billion of debt owed by\r\nAfrican countries. For 12 countries that means\r\ncancellation of their entire outstanding debt. The\r\nresources freed up in that way are used by beneficiary\r\ncountries to finance national poverty-reduction and\r\ndevelopment plans. Italy also supports the swift\r\nimplementation of the recent G-8 initiative to cancel all\r\ndebt owed to multilateral financial institutions by\r\nAfrican countries of the Heavily Indebted Poor\r\nCountries Debt Initiative.\r\nItaly is the third largest donor to the Global Fund\r\nto Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, having thus\r\nfar contributed $745 million, and actively promotes the\r\nFund’s financing of viable and effective projects in\r\nAfrica.\r\nApproximately 50 per cent of Italy’s official\r\ndevelopment assistance is directed to Africa. A large\r\nshare of those resources goes to agriculture and food\r\nsecurity programmes, in coordination with United\r\nNations agro-food agencies and in accordance with\r\nNEPAD priorities.\r\nIntegrated rural development is an important\r\ncomponent of our efforts, that includes such major\r\nprogrammes in sub-Saharan Africa as the ones in\r\nKeita, Niger, and in Arsi and Bale, Ethiopia, which are\r\nworth $75 million each. Programmes to combat\r\ndesertification and protect the environment have\r\nrecently been launched in Southern Africa, alongside\r\nour traditional support to West Africa through the Club\r\ndu Sahel.\r\nItaly shoulders approximately 5 per cent of the\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping budget, most of which is\r\ndevoted to Africa, and cooperates with our G-8\r\npartners to enhance African peacekeeping capacities.\r\nWorking jointly with the United States in Vicenza,\r\nItaly, we have established the Centre of Excellence for\r\nStability Police Units, which will train specialized\r\npolice units, particularly from African countries, for\r\n16\r\nA/60/PV.32\r\nparticipation in peace-support operations. Training\r\nclasses will start next month and will include the\r\nparticipation of several officers coming from four\r\nAfrican countries. Italy also supports the peacebuilding\r\nand good-governance activities for African civilian\r\npersonnel that are jointly managed by the University of\r\nPisa, Italy, and the University of Accra, Ghana, which\r\ninvolve trainees from 21 African countries.\r\nItaly promotes the advancement of democracy in\r\nAfrica through direct support, in cooperation with the\r\nUnited Nations Department of Economic and Social\r\nAffairs (DESA), for the Parliaments of eight African\r\ncountries. We have also helped to finance elections in\r\nfour African countries in 2005, operated partnerships\r\nwith three African countries in the area of e-\r\ngovernment, and provided substantial resources to the\r\nDESA-led African governance inventory programme,\r\ninvolving 28 countries of the African continent.\r\nSeveral initiatives have also been launched to\r\npromote Italian private investment flows to Africa, in\r\nthe belief that access to global markets, trade, private\r\ninvestment and entrepreneurship are powerful engines\r\nthat will drive African growth and development.\r\nLast but not least, Italy contributes to the\r\npreservation of African artistic and cultural heritage.\r\nThe most important example of that is the recent return\r\nto Ethiopia of the Axum obelisk.\r\nItaly welcomes an active role for the United\r\nNations in promoting and supporting NEPAD.\r\nActually, that is yet one more reason to strengthen the\r\nUnited Nations system and make multilateralism truly\r\neffective, as was pledged by our leaders in the Hall just\r\none month ago.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to join other speakers in\r\nreaffirming the need for renewed African efforts and\r\ncontinued tangible international support. Italy looks\r\nforward to advancing, with all partners, the\r\nimplementation phase of our commitments, in the spirit\r\nof the mutual accountability and enhanced partnership\r\nemerging within the Africa Partnership Forum.\r\nMr. Menon (Singapore): It has been four years\r\nsince the New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD) was launched by African leaders. The results\r\nsince then have been mixed. While there has been\r\nprogress in many areas — as evidenced by the\r\nSecretary-General’s third consolidated report on\r\nprogress in implementation and international support\r\nfor NEPAD (A/60/178) and by economic improvements\r\nacross the continent — it is also a fact that Africa still\r\nfaces many daunting challenges. Those include the lack\r\nof a well-integrated transportation infrastructure,\r\nmassive debt, the lack of sufficient foreign direct\r\ninvestment flows and huge gaps in the health and\r\neducation sectors, including the serious threat posed by\r\nHIV/AIDS. Those are massive, but not insurmountable,\r\nproblems. The important thing is that through NEPAD\r\nAfrican leaders have signalled that they are committed\r\nto resolving the continent’s problems and taking\r\nresponsibility for creating the right political conditions\r\nfor development.\r\nAs Nigeria’s President Obasanjo recently\r\nremarked, Africa is a continent on the move. As a\r\nresult, there is now greater focus at the international\r\nlevel on Africa’s development problems. NEPAD has\r\nbecome in many ways the key mechanism through\r\nwhich multilateral financial institutions and\r\ndevelopment partners are seeking to engage Africa.\r\nThe report of the United Kingdom-led Commission for\r\nAfrica entitled “Our common interest” and that of the\r\nUnited Nations Millennium Project (A/59/727) testify\r\nto that. Those reports have not only provided\r\nindependent analysis and offered some remedies for\r\nAfrica’s problems; they have reinforced the good work\r\nbeing done by NEPAD.\r\nIn many ways, NEPAD drives home the message\r\nthat developing countries have no choice but to adopt\r\nand implement their own national development\r\nstrategies. That is also in line with Singapore’s own\r\nthinking that there is no one-size-fits-all model of\r\ndevelopment and that it is important for Governments\r\nto take charge of their own national strategies, as they\r\nare the ones that should know what is in the best\r\ninterests of their peoples. However, there is also no\r\ndenying that there are some basic ingredients that must\r\nbe part of any national development strategy. Unless\r\nwe get those basics right, national strategies are\r\nunlikely to work or to have the kind of major, positive\r\nimpact that we would like to see them have in terms of\r\nmaking improvements in the lives of our citizens.\r\nPaul Wolfowitz, the President of the World Bank,\r\nalluded to those basic ingredients in his recent Annual\r\nMeetings address to the World Bank Group in\r\nWashington, D.C., when he said,\r\n“We know that sustained economic growth\r\nis essential for development and reducing\r\n17\r\nA/60/PV.32\r\npoverty. And we also know that many of the\r\ndrivers are not measurable in numerical terms.\r\nBecause they are harder to measure, harder to\r\npredict and often harder to influence, there is a\r\ntendency to discount these factors as ‘soft’.\r\n“That would be a mistake — because\r\nsustainable development depends as much on\r\nleadership and accountability, on civil society and\r\nwomen, on the private sector and on the rule of\r\nlaw, as it does on labour or capital.”\r\nSingapore’s own development experience over\r\nthe past 40 years corroborates Mr. Wolfowitz’s analysis\r\nof the basic ingredients that are necessary for sustained\r\neconomic growth. Our first goal in Singapore when we\r\nbecame independent, in 1965, was to shape the\r\nGovernment into an effective instrument of policy.\r\nThat required strong, fair and just leaders who not only\r\ncommanded the respect of the people but who had a\r\nsense of trusteeship: that they were only temporarily in\r\ncharge of the destinies of their people and that their\r\nduty was not only to discharge that trust but also pass it\r\non to equally trustworthy and competent hands.\r\nStrong measures were put in place to eradicate\r\ncorruption. At the same time, the political leadership\r\nwas backed up by a neutral, efficient and honest civil\r\nservice, with officers being recruited and promoted\r\nsolely on merit. We also pursued an economic policy\r\nthat was pragmatic and not dogmatic. While we\r\nrejected colonialism, we accepted our colonial\r\nheritage. We recognized that continuity with the past\r\nhelped one’s evolution into new growth sectors. We\r\ntherefore encouraged European, American, Japanese\r\nand all other businesses to stay and expand their\r\ninvestments. We avoided the seductive trap of\r\nnationalization of commerce, industry, land and\r\nproperty.\r\nMr. Hachani (Tunisia), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nWe rejected the conventional wisdom and\r\npolitical correctness of the 1960s, and even the 1970s,\r\nof being anti-multinational-corporation. We did not\r\naccept the theology that multinational corporations\r\nwould reduce countries to what economists have\r\nreferred to as “dependencia”. On the contrary, we\r\nassiduously courted foreign investment by\r\nmultinational corporations irrespective of their\r\nnationality. The fact was that multinational\r\ncorporations had the technology, know-how,\r\ntechniques, expertise and markets. We decided it was a\r\nfast way of learning on the job to work for them and\r\nwith them. Indeed, multinational corporations have\r\nbeen a powerful factor in Singapore’s growth.\r\nAnother key pillar of our national development\r\nstrategy is education. For a small country without any\r\nnatural resources except its human resources there is\r\nno other option but for everyone to be literate and\r\nknowledgeable in order to receive knowledge and to\r\nparticipate and add value. That is the only way for any\r\ncountry, in particular a small country, to stay ahead of\r\nthe global competition. That is also the underlying\r\nphilosophy of the Singapore Cooperation Programme,\r\nwhich was started in 1993 to help provide training to\r\nother developing countries in areas where we have\r\ndeveloped some expertise over the years.\r\nSingapore discovered early on that there were\r\nfew problems confronting us that others had not\r\nconfronted. We therefore learned from others and did\r\nnot re-invent the wheel unnecessarily, except to suit\r\nour own specific circumstances. For the same reason,\r\nwe believe in sharing our development experience with\r\nothers, including our African friends. We recognize\r\nthat our experience might not be relevant to some, but\r\nwe are prepared and happy to share it with whoever\r\nmight find it useful.\r\nUnder the Singapore Cooperation Programme we\r\nhave provided human resource training to more than\r\n36,000 officials from 160 countries, including 3,700\r\nofficials from 47 African countries. Under the Japan-\r\nSingapore Partnership Programme for the Twenty-first\r\nCentury and the Singapore Commonwealth of Learning\r\nJoint Training Programme we have tailored our courses\r\nto meet the needs of our African friends, for example,\r\nby offering a course on human resources management\r\nin the civil service. We are prepared to tailor more\r\ncourses, and we welcome continued African\r\nparticipation in the courses of the Singapore\r\nCooperation Programme.\r\nApart from training courses, Singapore has also\r\nhosted a number of African study visits and has\r\nsponsored consultancy projects in response to the\r\nspecific requests received from individual African\r\ncountries. For example, just last month, 13 of South\r\nAfrica’s heads of mission in Asian countries visited\r\nSingapore to learn about Singapore’s experience in the\r\npromotion of international trade. Those are some of the\r\nsmall things that we have done, and will continue to\r\n18\r\nA/60/PV.32\r\ndo, in the area of human resources training to help\r\ncontribute, within our limited resources, to African\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe great African historian Joseph Ki-Zerbo used\r\nto say that it is impossible to develop other people. You\r\ncan only develop by yourself, be the author of your\r\nown development. NEPAD aims to do just that. But, I\r\nwould like to add to that by saying that a bit of help\r\nfrom the outside world is always helpful, especially\r\nwhen you are starting out, as is the case with NEPAD,\r\nwhich is only four years old. As much as NEPAD is a\r\nregional initiative, the fact remains that Africa, and for\r\nthat matter most of us, cannot do it alone, even under\r\nthe best of circumstances.\r\nWhen Singapore became independent, in 1965,\r\nand despite being a free port and having fairly\r\nextensive connections with the rest of the world, we\r\nturned to the United Nations, and in particular the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP), to\r\nprovide us with technical assistance and economic\r\nadvice. The same should be done by countries in Africa\r\nand elsewhere that are stuck in the poverty trap. As\r\nProfessor Jeffrey Sachs noted in a Time magazine essay\r\ndated 14 March 2005,\r\n“perhaps most pertinent today, many regions that\r\ngot left furthest behind have faced special\r\nobstacles and hardships: diseases such as malaria,\r\ndrought-prone climates in locations not suitable\r\nfor irrigation, extreme isolation in mountains and\r\nlandlocked regions ... and other liabilities that\r\nhave kept these areas outside of the mainstream\r\nof … economic growth. [Those countries] face\r\nchallenges almost unknown in the rich world,\r\nchallenges that are at first harrowing to\r\ncontemplate”.\r\nIn a globalized post-cold-war world, how well\r\ncountries succeed will depend upon how best they are\r\nable to plug themselves into the global economic grid.\r\nThe alternative to that, which is really not an\r\nalternative, is marginalization. In that regard, we in\r\nAsia have been very encouraged by the Declaration\r\nadopted by leaders at the April 2005 Asian-African\r\nSummit to focus cooperation on three key pillars,\r\nnamely, political, economic and social and cultural\r\nrelations.\r\nThe international community, especially the\r\nUnited Nations and other development institutions,\r\ncan, and should, continue to help African Governments\r\nformulate national strategies in order to bring them into\r\nthe mainstream. Unless we all do so, there is a real\r\ndanger that Africa will continue to lag behind the rest\r\nof the world, despite the best efforts of its leaders and\r\npeoples. In that regard, we welcome the recent decision\r\ntaken by the Group of Eight countries, as well as that\r\ntaken subsequently by the International Monetary Fund\r\nand World Bank, to cancel the outstanding debt of\r\nhighly indebted poor countries. We look forward to its\r\noutright and up-front implementation. If the sense of\r\ninjustice and unfairness becomes too great, one way or\r\nanother the problems of Africa will become those of\r\nthe rest of the world.\r\nEconomic globalization, while providing\r\ncountries with unlimited choice and markets, has also\r\nhighlighted the problems of poverty, terrorism and\r\ndisease. It is true that challenges and opportunities are\r\ntwo sides of the same coin. The reward for taking on\r\nthe challenges of globalization is to gain access to\r\nexternal markets. It is therefore in our collective self-\r\ninterest to work with our African friends through\r\nNEPAD to balance both the upside and the downside of\r\neconomic globalization.\r\nIn conclusion, let me say that there is no doubt\r\nthat strong national leadership backed by regional peer\r\nreview and international support offers a powerful\r\ncombination to improve the performance of\r\nGovernments. As the third progress report on NEPAD\r\nhas correctly pointed out,\r\n“The central challenge is to grasp the opportunity\r\nand maintain the momentum by ensuring that\r\nAfrican Governments intensify their efforts to\r\nimplement NEPAD, while the development\r\npartners honour their commitments to support\r\nAfrica.” (A/60/178, summary)\r\nI am confident that both Africa and its\r\ndevelopment partners and friends will rise up to that\r\nchallenge. In the words of President Thabo Mbeki, this\r\nis, after all, “Africa’s season of hope”. We must work\r\ntogether with Africa to ensure that our common\r\ndevelopment goals are achieved.\r\nMs. Al-Mulla (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): My\r\ndelegation is honoured to participate in this debate on\r\nthe New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD). Through the Secretary-General’s third\r\nconsolidated report (A/60/178), we have followed with\r\ninterest the progress achieved by the international\r\ncommunity on the NEPAD initiative and the support it\r\n19\r\nA/60/PV.32\r\nhas provided. We have done so because Kuwait\r\nattaches great importance to that question, as it pertains\r\nto the interests and concerns of African countries, with\r\nwhich we maintain close historic ties.\r\nFour years have elapsed since African leaders\r\nadopted the NEPAD initiative, which aims to achieve\r\nbalanced growth on a large scale and to enable Africa\r\nto alleviate poverty and better integrate into the world\r\neconomy.\r\nKuwait hopes that the resolutions adopted at\r\nnumerous international conferences with the aim of\r\nachieving sustainable development, as well as the\r\ndecisions contained in the outcome document of the\r\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting (resolution 60/1), will help\r\nto establish the foundation for partnerships between\r\ndeveloped and developing countries that will\r\ncontribute to enhancing stability and mutual economic\r\nrelations by putting in place fair and balanced rules for\r\ninternational trade, under which each party would\r\nassume its own share of the responsibility for meeting\r\nthe special needs of Africa.\r\nAttempts by African countries to escape the\r\nvicious cycle of eliminating the debt burden, on the\r\none hand, and ensuring financial resources for their\r\ndevelopment goals, on the other, is one of the most\r\nsignificant challenges facing the African continent. The\r\nfact that some heavily indebted African countries have\r\nbenefited from the cancellation of bilateral debt\r\nannounced by some donor countries — including the\r\ndecision taken by the Group of Eight to cancel 100 per\r\ncent of the $40 billion in debt owed by 18 low-income\r\ncountries, among them 14 African countries — is a\r\npositive development that has drawn our attention.\r\nLong before NEPAD was announced, Kuwait had\r\nalready moved to alleviate African countries’ debt\r\nburdens. This was demonstrated in an address by His\r\nHighness the Emir of Kuwait before the forty-third\r\nsession of the General Assembly, in 1988, in which he\r\ncalled upon the international community, especially the\r\ndonor countries, to take action to alleviate the debt\r\nburdens encumbering the economies of many\r\ndeveloping countries, and to cancel them for countries\r\nwith distressed economies.\r\nThe Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic\r\nDevelopment (KFAED) has contributed to the\r\nalleviation of the external debt burden for 14 African\r\ncountries within the framework of the Highly Indebted\r\nPoor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative. The debts owed\r\nto the Fund by these countries were reduced by\r\nrescheduling them over a period of 40 years, including\r\na 16-year grace period, with interest rates ranging from\r\n0.5 per cent to 2 per cent. These terms were considered\r\nmore attractive and easier to meet than the initial terms\r\nfor those loans. Moreover, the Fund is in the process of\r\nalleviating the debts of other African countries as soon\r\nas they reach the completion point within the\r\nframework of the Initiative. Here, I would like to\r\nmention the role of the Fund of the Organization of the\r\nPetroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which\r\noperates within the HIPC Initiative to alleviate the\r\nforeign debts of 18 African countries, as an aspect of\r\nthe principle of partnership among developing\r\ncountries themselves.\r\nSolving the problem of external debt or\r\ncancelling debts will be neither practical nor effective\r\nunless, along with those steps, funds needed for\r\ndevelopment assistance are also provided. Kuwait can\r\nsay with pride that it has abided by all of its\r\ninternational obligations and that, through KFAED, it\r\ncontinues to contribute to economic development\r\nprogrammes in developing countries. This Fund has\r\ngranted development loans in the amount of $12 billion\r\nto more than 100 countries around the world, 40 per\r\ncent of which are in Africa. As a percentage of its\r\ngross national product (GNP), overall average Kuwaiti\r\nofficial development assistance is equal to nearly twice\r\nthe agreed United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of the\r\nGNP of developed countries.\r\nKFAED has contributed resources to many\r\ndevelopment institutions in Africa. For example,\r\nthrough the middle of 2005, the African Development\r\nFund (ADF) had been granted development assistance\r\namounting to $196.7 million, while the African\r\nDevelopment Bank received $115 million, the Arab\r\nBank for Economic Development in Africa received\r\n$48 million and the Special Programme for Sub-\r\nSaharan African Countries Affected by Drought and\r\nDesertification, within the International Fund for\r\nAgricultural Development, received financial aid\r\namounting to $15 million.\r\nThrough mid-2005, KFAED has also provided\r\ngrants and technical assistance valued at around $313\r\nmillion. The Fund has made donations to many\r\nrehabilitation programmes, contributing to the success\r\nof the first programme to combat river blindness by\r\nproviding more than $100 million to 11 African\r\ncountries. The Kuwait Fund’s contributions continued\r\n20\r\nA/60/PV.32\r\nuntil the fifth stage of the programme in 2003 and\r\ncovered another 19 African countries, including\r\nAngola, Malawi, Mozambique, United Republic of\r\nTanzania and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nIt is worth mentioning here the Fund’s\r\ncontribution to the Tropical Disease Foundation, of\r\nwhich the Fund is a founding member. We have also\r\ncontributed to the International Development Law\r\nInstitute, which has brought benefits to many African\r\ncountries.\r\nIn his third consolidated report on progress in\r\nimplementation and international support for NEPAD\r\n(A/60/178), the Secretary-General warns of grave\r\nconsequences of the accumulation of debt due to the\r\ncontinued surge in oil prices, especially for low-\r\nincome, non-oil-producing countries. Increasing oil\r\nprices in the 1970s and 1980s, he adds, were one of the\r\nmain reasons behind the debt crisis from which many\r\nAfrican countries currently suffer.\r\nThis is an attempt to simplify a complicated\r\nissue. Moreover, it ignores many similar factors that\r\naccompanied the debt crisis of the 1970s and 1980s,\r\nincluding a drop in the income of African countries\r\nfrom the revenues of their basic commodities, as well\r\nas tax limitations and taxes imposed on goods from\r\ndeveloping countries. Oil prices, just like the prices\r\nany basic commodities, can be affected by many\r\nfactors, including geographical and economic\r\ncircumstances, as well as speculation, a component of\r\nWestern stock markets and hedge funds.\r\nKuwait works diligently to ensure the stability of\r\nthe international oil market in order to maintain the\r\npace of economic development and growth for\r\neveryone. Through the OPEC Fund, Kuwait has made\r\neffective contributions to many development projects\r\nin developing countries, with 99 countries benefiting\r\nfrom assistance offered by the Fund, including 46\r\nAfrican States. The volume of soft loans granted\r\nthrough January 2004 amounted to $5.382 billion. This\r\nprinciple of partnership includes the OPEC Fund’s\r\ncontribution to the capital of the Common Fund for\r\nCommodities (CFC) as well as grants to assist\r\ncountries in subscribing to the CFC, and the OPEC\r\nFund’s contribution to the special account to fight\r\nHIV/AIDS.\r\nPartnership is not a temporary process but rather\r\na continuing long-term and painstaking effort requiring\r\npatience and constant assessment. In Kuwait and\r\nthrough the continued participation of KFAED in the\r\nministerial meetings of the South African Development\r\nCommunity since the early 1980s, we have witnessed\r\nthe emergence and growth of the idea of the NEPAD\r\ninitiative, which demonstrates the existence of an\r\nAfrican renaissance policy. This idea, this new\r\npartnership for success will become a reality because\r\nof the African determination to make it succeed.\r\nContributing to the success of this partnership will be\r\nthe international community’s commitment to fulfilling\r\nthe pledges it has made.\r\nMr. Rock (Canada): Canada appreciates this\r\nopportunity to record its observations and to reaffirm\r\nits commitments as we take stock together of progress\r\nin the New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD).\r\nWhen the NEPAD initiative was launched in\r\n2002, Canada welcomed it as an ambitious, yet\r\nrealistic, framework to achieve sustainable\r\ndevelopment and reduce poverty in Africa. Best of all,\r\nit was a plan that was created and owned by Africa\r\nitself. It offered a vision to bring that magnificent\r\ncontinent fully into the global economy and to realize\r\nits tremendous potential. By adopting NEPAD, the\r\nAfrican Union and its members not only demonstrated\r\ntheir commitment to improving governance, they also\r\nprovided a means for the international community to\r\njoin them in partnership in support of Africa’s\r\ndevelopment.\r\nNEPAD has had Canada’s enthusiastic support\r\nfrom the outset. As president of the Group of Eight (G-8) in\r\n2002, Canada worked with our partners to produce the G-8\r\nAfrica Action Plan, launched at the G-8 Summit in\r\nKananaskis, Canada, in June 2002 in response to\r\nNEPAD’s priorities.\r\nThe Africa Action Plan is working. NEPAD is\r\nmaking a difference. Governance has improved in\r\nmany countries. Economic growth for the continent is\r\nprojected at over 5 per cent in 2005, reflecting\r\nimprovements in economic and corporate management.\r\nAfricans themselves have provided leadership and have\r\nachieved significant progress in resolving several of\r\nthe conflicts that have held back development,\r\ndestroyed lives and impaired the futures of so many. As\r\nI observed, this progress has been by achieved by\r\nAfricans themselves, from those in positions of\r\nleadership to those who work in communities, in order\r\nto ensure that Africa assumes its rightful place in the\r\n21\r\nA/60/PV.32\r\nglobal community and that Africans fulfil their full\r\npotential.\r\nBut despite the progress that has been achieved,\r\nso much more needs to be done, both by Africa and by\r\nits development partners, if we are to realize the\r\nNEPAD vision. Progress toward realizing the\r\nMillennium Development Goals in much of Africa has\r\nbeen disappointing. The toll of conflict and infectious\r\ndisease continues to be devastating. Poverty remains\r\nwidespread. As a sad result, too much of the energy\r\nand creativity of Africans is focused on short-term\r\nsurvival, instead of long-term development. That is\r\nwhat must change. That is why we must redouble our\r\ncollective efforts to translate today’s NEPAD ideals\r\ninto tomorrow’s reality.\r\nCanada has always viewed NEPAD as a long-\r\nterm commitment. It is essential that we, and the\r\nbroader international community, working together\r\nwith Africa, sustain our commitment to allow time for\r\nimplementation of NEPAD’s principles and\r\nprogrammes so that they may yield positive results.\r\nIt is for this reason that we were pleased that\r\nAfrica was at the centre of the agenda of the G-8\r\nSummit at Gleneagles in July. The G-8 leaders met\r\nwith their counterparts from a number of African\r\ncountries and renewed their commitment to this\r\npartnership and their long-term engagement.\r\nAs we move into the implementation phase of\r\nNEPAD, one of the most promising developments is\r\nthe African Peer Review Mechanism. That mechanism\r\ndemonstrates the commitment of many African\r\nGovernments to improving governance. We welcome\r\nthe fact that 23 African countries have now signed on\r\nto this bold and innovative initiative. The first reviews\r\nhave now been launched, and we look forward to the\r\nrelease of reports — those on Ghana and Rwanda — in\r\nthe months ahead.\r\nCanada joins others in supporting African efforts\r\nto prevent, mediate and resolve regional conflicts and\r\nin supporting Africa’s peacekeeping capacity. Canada\r\nhas been proud to provide assistance to the African\r\nUnion Mission in Sudan in its vital role in enhancing\r\nsecurity in Darfur.\r\nTurning briefly to economic matters, let me state\r\nour conviction that Africa’s sustained economic growth\r\nrequires, among other things, the unlocking of the\r\ncapacity of the private sector in Africa and the\r\ncontinent’s integration into the global economy. Earlier\r\nthis year, Canada launched the Canada Investment\r\nFund for Africa, a public-private initiative designed to\r\nprovide risk capital for private investments in Africa.\r\nIn launching this fund, we hope to encourage foreign\r\ninvestment that will have a positive impact on the\r\ncontinent’s development.\r\nCanada is also committed to an ambitious\r\noutcome to the Doha Development Round. Developed\r\ncountries’ markets must be opened to African\r\nproducers. In 2003, Canada opened its markets to\r\nvirtually all products from the least developed\r\ncountries. Agricultural export subsidies must be\r\neliminated, if we are to create an even playing field for\r\nproducers from developing countries in Africa and\r\naround the world. Equally important, Africa, with the\r\nsupport of development partners, must work to build its\r\ncapacity to trade and compete in the global economy.\r\nDevelopment assistance will continue to play a\r\nsignificant role in advancing the NEPAD agenda.\r\nCanada is fulfilling its commitment made in 2002 to\r\nincrease ODA by 8 per cent per year with over 50 per\r\ncent of that amount being directed to Africa. Canadian\r\nofficial development assistance to Africa will double\r\nbetween 2003 and 2009.\r\nOne of the priority sectors of our development\r\nassistance is health, particularly combating HIV/AIDS.\r\nTotal Canadian contributions to the Global Fund to\r\nFight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria since its\r\ninception are now nearly 550 million Canadian dollars.\r\nWe will continue to work in common cause to defeat\r\nthese devastating diseases.\r\nCanada is committed to the NEPAD partnership\r\nover the long run. We are encouraged by the progress\r\nthat has been achieved. We are conscious of the urgent\r\nneed to achieve so much more. We are determined to\r\ncontinue working with our African partners. We\r\nsupport their efforts to address the challenges that\r\nAfrica faces. Together, we will enable the continent to\r\nrealize its full potential for the benefit of all its people\r\nand to the advantage of the entire world.\r\nMr. Le Luong Minh (Viet Nam): My delegation\r\naligns itself with the statements made earlier by the\r\ndistinguished representative of Jamaica on behalf of\r\nthe Group of 77 and China and by the distinguished\r\nrepresentative of Malaysia on behalf of the Association\r\nof Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).\r\n22\r\nA/60/PV.32\r\nWe note with pleasure the encouraging report by\r\nthe Secretary-General on the implementation of and\r\ninternational support for the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD). As reflected in that\r\nreport, substantive progress has been made in the\r\npromotion of peace and sustainable development in\r\nAfrica. Many programmes and projects have been\r\ndesigned to cover all essential sectors with a view to\r\nmoving African countries towards a higher level of\r\neconomic and social development. We are encouraged\r\nby the fact that the Group of Eight (G-8) has decided to\r\ngrant a 100 per cent multilateral cancellation of the\r\ndebt owed to the World Bank, the International\r\nMonetary Fund and the African Development Bank by\r\n18 low-income countries, 14 of which are African\r\ncountries. The establishment of the African Peer\r\nReview Mechanism with the participation of 23\r\ncountries will serve as a useful instrument for\r\npromoting sustainable development in Africa as a\r\nwhole.\r\nWe also note, however, that amid those positive\r\ndevelopments, many difficulties and challenges remain\r\nfor Africa. The Human Development Report 2005\r\nshows that while there has been considerable progress\r\ntowards meeting the Millennium Development Goals,\r\nmany African countries lag far behind and are in\r\ndanger of not attaining the Goals by 2015. Fifty\r\ncountries, with a combined population of\r\napproximately 900 million people, are actually moving\r\nbackwards in one or more of the development areas.\r\nAlmost half those countries are in the poverty-stricken\r\nsub-Saharan region of Africa.\r\nAs also mentioned in the report, most regions in\r\nAfrica continue to be severely affected by food crises\r\ntriggered by natural disasters, conflicts, political\r\ninstability, economic failure, the HIV/AIDS pandemic\r\nand other diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria and\r\npolio. If current trends continue, there will be more\r\nthan 800 million people living in abject poverty by\r\n2015. Child mortality statistics depict a stark picture of\r\nhealth care in numerous countries. At the current pace,\r\nthe goal of reducing the child mortality rate will be met\r\n30 years late.\r\nAs indicated in the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, a sharp increase in international aid to Africa,\r\nespecially sub-Saharan Africa, is absolutely essential\r\nfor the social and economic development of the\r\ncontinent. Viet Nam welcomes the pledges by\r\nindividual members of the Group of Eight to increase\r\nor even double aid to Africa, and the commitments by\r\nmembers of the European Union to double their\r\ndevelopment assistance from 2004 to 2010, with at\r\nleast 50 per cent of the increase being earmarked for\r\nsub-Saharan Africa. We join others in echoing the call\r\nto development partners to fulfil their official\r\ndevelopment assistance pledges for African countries.\r\nTrade continues to be another very important\r\nfactor for the majority of African countries. To help\r\nthem in that connection, developed countries should\r\nfurther open their markets to exports from African\r\ncountries and take necessary measures to eliminate\r\ntheir agriculture export subsidies and trade-distorting\r\npolicies.\r\nPeace and stability are prerequisites for economic\r\ndevelopment. The report of the Secretary-General on\r\nthe causes of conflict and promotion of durable peace\r\nand sustainable development in Africa (A/60/182)\r\nemphasizes that the African countries, the United\r\nNations and the international community need to\r\nincrease their efforts to prevent and resolve conflicts,\r\nstrengthen peacekeeping capacities and enhance\r\ncooperation and coordination among international and\r\nregional institutions. We commend the efforts of the\r\nAfrican Union and the Economic Community of West\r\nAfrican States to play a greater role in peacekeeping,\r\nand we applaud the African Union’s establishment last\r\nyear of the Peace and Security Council. We believe that\r\nthe engagement of African countries in peacekeeping\r\noperations will contribute to peace and stability in the\r\ncontinent.\r\nAs complementary support to the efforts made by\r\nthe United Nations system and the entire international\r\ncommunity, South-South cooperation plays a\r\nsubstantial role in promoting Africa’s social and\r\neconomic development. The Asia-Africa Summit held\r\nin Indonesia last April adopted a declaration on the\r\nNew Asian-African Strategic Partnership, which\r\nexpressed strong support for NEPAD as the African\r\nUnion’s programme for growth and socio-economic\r\ndevelopment, and endorsed the need to promote\r\npractical cooperation between the two regions in areas\r\nsuch as trade, tourism, investment, industry, finance,\r\ninformation and communication technology, energy,\r\nhealth, agriculture and transportation. Successful\r\ncooperation between the two continents, which have\r\nmany similar conditions and which have always\r\nmaintained close traditional ties, will certainly\r\n23\r\nA/60/PV.32\r\ncontribute greatly to their peace, stability and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nAs an Asian country, a member of the\r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations that is highly\r\nsupportive of both NEPAD and the New Asian-African\r\nStrategic Partnership, and as a close friend and partner\r\nof Africa over the past years, Viet Nam has continued\r\nto promote multifaceted cooperation with African\r\ncountries. Hundreds of Vietnamese experts in the fields\r\nof education, health care and agriculture continue\r\nworking in a number of African countries under\r\nbilateral and tripartite cooperation agreements. As our\r\nrelations of friendship and cooperation with Africa\r\ngrow, let me reaffirm our commitment to working with\r\nall partners towards the implementation and the\r\nsuccess of NEPAD.\r\nMr. Badji (Senegal) (spoke in French): Before I\r\nturn to the item under consideration, allow me, on\r\nbehalf of the Government of Senegal, to convey our\r\nsincere thanks to all Members of the Organization and\r\nthe bodies and the agencies of the United Nations\r\nsystem for the constant assistance and support that they\r\nprovide to the African continent.\r\nWith the meeting of the Council of the European\r\nUnion, the Group of Eight Gleneagles summit and the\r\nrecent summit of heads of State and Government at the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the year 2005 has seen a wealth of\r\nhigh-level meetings in which Africa was at the centre\r\nof the discussion. We consider that to be a sign of faith\r\nin the future of our continent. It is a gesture of\r\nparticular significance to us as Africans.\r\nAt the outset, I wish to pay tribute to the high\r\nquality of the two reports of the Secretary-General\r\nrelated to the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD): the third consolidated report\r\non progress in implementation and international\r\nsupport (A/60/178) and the progress report on\r\nimplementation of the recommendations contained in\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General on the causes of\r\nconflict and promotion of durable peace and\r\nsustainable development in Africa (A/60/182). The two\r\nreports are uncompromising and clear-sighted in their\r\ndescription of the implementation of NEPAD and the\r\nconflicts in Africa. They propose a broad array of\r\nrelevant recommendations, which, if implemented,\r\ncould contribute decisively to promoting peace and\r\nsustainable development in Africa.\r\nSince this morning, much has been said, and said\r\nwell, about the contents of those two reports and on the\r\nchallenges that call on us to tackle our common cause\r\nof finding solutions to the problems of the African\r\ncontinent. For my part, I would like briefly to share a\r\nfew observations about what my country regards as the\r\nprerequisites for real recovery in Africa. I am thinking\r\nof the problem of the external debt of African countries\r\nand the worrisome question of the integration of\r\nAfrican countries into the world trading system.\r\nWith respect to debt, while we should welcome\r\nthe recent decision of the Group of Eight to assist 14\r\nhighly indebted poor countries of Africa, including\r\nSenegal, we must acknowledge that the problem of\r\nAfrican debt remains acute. Solving that problem\r\nrequires bolder, more extensive measures that benefit a\r\nlarge number of countries, including middle-income\r\ncountries. The Evian approach initiated by the Paris\r\nClub provides a good framework for extending debt\r\nrelief to a broader range of countries; my country\r\nhopes that such an initiative will be taken.\r\nClearly, current debt relief initiatives enable our\r\ncountries to use precious resources for financing\r\ndevelopment, but they do not ensure our debt\r\nsustainability. That is why my country fully supports\r\nthe recommendation of the Secretary-General to assess\r\na country’s sustainable level of debt at a level that\r\npermits the country to achieve the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals without suffering a deterioration of\r\nits debt ratio from now to 2015. We fervently hope that\r\nthis recommendation will be received positively by the\r\nmultilateral financial institutions, in particular the\r\nWorld Bank and the International Monetary Fund.\r\nWith respect to trade, the gradual phase-out of\r\npreferential tariff regimes for African commodities that\r\nwere in place before the conclusion of the Uruguay\r\nRound resulted in significant losses in export income\r\nfor our countries. The expected benefits of the\r\nincreased liberalization of world trade, which were to\r\ncompensate for those losses, did not materialize, due to\r\nthe lack of access to foreign markets for our products.\r\nThat, in short, is the problematic nature of our\r\ncontinent’s participation in the world trading system.\r\nRemoving tariff and non-tariff barriers,\r\neliminating subsidies and improving and diversifying\r\nsupply are the proposed solutions for resolving the\r\nproblem; they are well known and need no further\r\nelaboration.\r\n24\r\nA/60/PV.32\r\nI shall limit myself to recalling the proposal of\r\nthe President of the Republic of Senegal, His\r\nExcellency Abdoulaye Wade, to replace the debt-and-\r\naid equation with the option that offers salvation:\r\ngrowth to eliminate poverty and trade to create growth.\r\nWith that formulation, President Wade is not in any\r\nway denying the vital importance and usefulness of\r\nloans and aid. Far from it, because, in the current\r\nemergency, the impact of resources stemming from\r\nloans and aid on the living conditions of millions of\r\nmen and women throughout Africa is a matter of\r\nsurvival. Rather, for President Wade, it is a question of\r\nrecognizing that, in the light of a half century of valiant\r\ndevelopment efforts by African countries, Africa’s\r\nroute to globalization is through trade.\r\nThe challenge for us, therefore, is to create the\r\nconditions for trade. Recent events show that whenever\r\nthe international community has the will and the\r\nresolve to do so, it has been able to tackle challenges\r\nrequiring greater resources and much bolder decisions\r\nthan those required to better integrate Africa in the\r\nworld trading system.\r\nAfrica, for its part, must further demonstrate its\r\nconviction that trade is the path of redemption for its\r\ndevelopment, and our development partners should\r\ntangibly demonstrate their resolve to help us better\r\nintegrate into world trade.\r\nTo conclude, I would like briefly to share two\r\nobservations prompted by the two reports of the\r\nSecretary-General. First, peace and stability in Africa\r\nwill remain precarious until our countries achieve\r\neconomic and social progress, which is the justification\r\nfor NEPAD. Secondly, the international community’s\r\ncommitment to assisting Africa is real, as is the\r\ndetermination of our countries to implement NEPAD.\r\nHowever, making a commitment is one thing;\r\nhonouring that commitment in a timely manner is\r\nanother.\r\nLet us act together in solidarity so that our\r\nexpectations can be quickly fulfilled, marking the\r\nbeginning of a new era in which Africa frees itself\r\nforever from the misfortunes of underdevelopment and\r\nbecomes a genuine participant in the shared peace and\r\nprosperity of our global village.\r\nMr. Kafando (Burkina Faso) (spoke in French):\r\nFour years after the adoption of the New Partnership\r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD), the results are\r\nmixed. Could it be otherwise when the international\r\ncommunity’s commitments to Africa are still being\r\nawaited? Africa requires considerable outside\r\nassistance to tackle underdevelopment. The recent calls\r\nof the United Kingdom’s Commission for Africa and\r\nthe Millennium Project team confirm that fact.\r\nBut what exactly is the situation? One should\r\nrecall, at least, that the recent world summit reaffirmed\r\nthe determination of international financial donors to\r\nrespond to Africa’s needs so that it could be fully\r\nintegrated into the world economy. Implementation of\r\nNEPAD requires coordinated efforts and action at the\r\nnational, subregional, regional and international levels,\r\nwhich poses enormous multifaceted challenges and\r\ntherefore requires the assistance of all stakeholders.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General (A/60/178)\r\nunderlines the major challenges to implementation of\r\nNEPAD. Let me mention three of them.\r\nThe first is strengthening the capacity of national\r\nand regional institutions responsible for promoting\r\nNEPAD. That challenge is a top priority, especially\r\nbecause institutional weakness can pose an obstacle to\r\nformulating, carrying out and monitoring projects.\r\nThe second is the need for greater coherence and\r\nbetter coordination between national development\r\nplans and the NEPAD priorities, given that a\r\nharmonization of actions at the country and continental\r\nlevels is essential for achieving the expected results.\r\nThe third and most important challenge is\r\nfinancing. Our partners’ commitment to predictable,\r\nregular financing is essential if we are properly to carry\r\nout the agreed development plans and programmes in\r\nNEPAD. In order for NEPAD to be a successful\r\npartnership, effective key actions must be taken\r\nimmediately, in particular through more substantial and\r\nbetter targeted aid, broader debt relief and an increase\r\nof private capital flows.\r\nFor their part, African countries remain\r\ndetermined to undertake economic, social and political\r\nreforms. Good governance is gaining ground.\r\nTestimony of that is the enthusiasm for the African\r\nPeer Review Mechanism, which 23 countries,\r\nincluding Burkina Faso, have joined. We take this\r\nopportunity to thank all African countries and\r\ndevelopment partners that have made a financial\r\ncontribution to the Review Mechanism.\r\nNonetheless, our optimism is tempered by the\r\nnumerous armed conflicts that afflict our continent and\r\n25\r\nA/60/PV.32\r\nprevent the attainment of development goals. Africa\r\ntherefore requires a climate of peace and security. We\r\nmust strive for that by strengthening existing\r\nmechanisms for conflict management and resolution,\r\nand we must strive to put in place the appropriate\r\nframeworks for strengthening peace and the economic\r\nrecovery of countries emerging from conflict.\r\nWe welcome with great satisfaction the decision\r\nof the recent world summit to create a Peacebuilding\r\nCommission. The rapid establishment of the\r\nCommission will undoubtedly contribute to curbing\r\npost-conflict difficulties.\r\nFinally, insofar as they have become a problem\r\nfor development, the fight against AIDS and malaria is\r\na priority of NEPAD. Unfortunately, the actions taken\r\nto eradicate those scourges are too disparate and —\r\nmore important — insufficient. Africa needs a true\r\ncontinent-wide programme if it is to effectively fight\r\nAIDS and malaria; combating those pandemics is a\r\nmatter of extreme urgency.\r\nWith regard to malaria in particular, we continue\r\nto hope that the quick-win initiatives provided for in\r\nthe 2005 World Summit Outcome document (resolution\r\n60/1) will enable Africa to benefit from the\r\ninternational community’s actions, particularly through\r\nthe distribution of insecticide-treated bed nets and the\r\nprovision of free antimalaria therapies.\r\nWe believe that Africa does have the potential for\r\nself-fulfilment. It asks only for support through\r\nresponsible partnership based on mutual interests.\r\nMr. Butagira (Uganda): I align myself with the\r\nstatements made by the representatives of Namibia on\r\nbehalf of the African Group and of Jamaica on behalf\r\nof the Group of 77 and China.\r\nI would like to express my appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General for his comprehensive report on\r\nprogress on implementation and international support\r\nfor the New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD) (A/60/178) and his report on the causes of\r\nconflict and the promotion of durable peace and\r\nsustainable development in Africa (A/60/182).\r\nThe Secretary-General’s reports indicate that\r\ndespite a number of positive trends and advances in\r\nAfrica, the conditions for sustained peace and\r\ndevelopment have yet to be consolidated. That is the\r\nresult of economic and social threats, as well as of\r\ninternal conflicts.\r\nIn his address to the General Assembly, the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Uganda said that Africa\r\nhas travelled a long way in search of peace and\r\nstability. Today, there are various peace- and conflict-\r\nresolution efforts at the national, regional and African\r\nUnion levels, because we realize that without peace\r\nAfrica will remain mired in poverty and degradation.\r\nWith regard to our own Great Lakes region, we hope\r\nthat the Tripartite Commission, composed of Uganda,\r\nRwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\r\nand with the participation of Burundi, will help to\r\nadvance the cause of peace in the region. The Inter-\r\nGovernmental Authority on Development is also\r\nworking to re-establish order in Somalia. The\r\ninternational community, under the leadership of the\r\nUnited Nations, should support those efforts so that we\r\ncan achieve sustainable peace.\r\nAt the country level, Uganda has been fighting —\r\nsingle-handedly and for a long time now — the\r\nterrorists of the so-called Lord’s Resistance Army in\r\nnorthern Uganda. They have now been virtually wiped\r\nout from that area. The Ugandan Government is\r\ngrateful to the Government of the Sudan, which has\r\nallowed our forces to operate from its soil with a view\r\nto delivering a decisive blow to those terrorists. We\r\nunderstand that they are now on the run. We strongly\r\nurge the international community and neighbouring\r\ncountries to hunt them down and disarm them,\r\nwherever they run. In fact, a number of that terrorist\r\ngroup’s leaders have now been issued arrest warrants\r\nby the International Criminal Court. That should send a\r\nstrong message to any would-be terrorists that the days\r\nof impunity are over. The amnesty law is still in force\r\nin Uganda, and whoever surrenders will be pardoned.\r\nUganda, like other African countries affected by\r\nconflict, needs international cooperation and assistance\r\nto supplement its post-conflict humanitarian,\r\nrehabilitation and development programmes. We\r\ntherefore strongly support the setting up, by the end of\r\nDecember this year, of the Peacebuilding Commission,\r\nand we are confident that we will be able to agree on\r\nits composition and on other necessary modalities.\r\nAs the Secretary-General has said, the African\r\nUnion needs continued international financial support\r\nto develop the African Union peacekeeping capacity\r\nand to establish the Africa Standby Force. We\r\nappreciate the support of the European Union and other\r\ndonors in that endeavour. That will make NEPAD’s\r\nobjective of addressing the causes of conflict and the\r\n26\r\nA/60/PV.32\r\npromotion of sustainable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa a reality.\r\nAction is needed at the county level. Uganda has\r\nset up a NEPAD/African Peer Review Mechanism\r\nsecretariat under the National Planning Authority with\r\nresponsibility for coordinating activities related to\r\nNEPAD. Our commitment to NEPAD is further\r\ndemonstrated by our accession to the African Peer\r\nReview Mechanism (APRM), which is a self-\r\nmonitoring instrument, voluntarily agreed upon by\r\nStates members of the African Union, for ensuring\r\nconformity with agreed good-governance policies and\r\npractices. Uganda received Peer Review Mechanism\r\nvisits in February and September 2005, and provided\r\ninformation on political, economic and corporate\r\ngovernance, as well as on the development\r\nenvironment, as part of the assessment preparatory\r\nprocess. A draft country programme of action has also\r\nbeen provided.\r\nEfforts are being made to harmonize NEPAD\r\nprogrammes with and integrate them into our ongoing\r\nGovernment development strategies — such as the\r\nPoverty Eradication Action Plan and the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goal projects — with a view to\r\naccelerating poverty reduction, promoting regional and\r\nglobal initiatives at the country level and improving\r\nregional dialogue and cross-border projects that foster\r\npeacebuilding and crisis prevention.\r\nOther measures, such as the development of a\r\ncommunication and advocacy strategy for the APRM\r\ncountry self-assessment questionnaire, have been put in\r\nplace. A programme document for APRM country self-\r\nassessment has been developed and submitted to the\r\ncountry office of the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme seeking assistance to enable the country to\r\nkick-start the self-assessment process.\r\nUganda has identified the following projects as a\r\npriority for the country and the region: the Kenya-\r\nUganda oil pipeline, Mombasa port container facilities,\r\nthe East African Community northern corridor road\r\nproject, safe navigation on Lake Victoria, the\r\nestablishment of a One-Stop border post, and the\r\nnational school feeding programme. Only recently, an\r\ne-school project supported by NEPAD was inaugurated\r\nin Uganda.\r\nNone of those projects will succeed without the\r\nsupport of the international community. That is why we\r\nwelcome the commitments made in support of NEPAD,\r\nmost recently in the World Summit Outcome. It is time\r\nto honour those promises and help Africa to help itself.\r\nFinally, we commend the United Nations for its\r\nleading role in advocacy and in mobilizing\r\ninternational support for NEPAD.\r\nMr. Siv (United States of America): The New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD)\r\nrepresents African leaders’ commitment to consolidate\r\ndemocracy and sound economic management, fight\r\ncorruption and promote peace and security. It\r\nrepresents their commitment to managing natural\r\nresources in a sustainable manner and to boost\r\ninvestment in Africa’s most valuable asset — its\r\npeople. NEPAD reflects the fundamental principle that\r\nAfricans must determine Africa’s future. The United\r\nStates strongly endorses its mission.\r\nMalaria remains a major threat to human health\r\nand economic welfare in many parts of the world. This\r\nis especially the case in Africa, where it kills almost\r\n1.2 million people a year, the vast majority of victims\r\nbeing young children. Yearly economic losses in Africa\r\ndue to malaria are about $12 billion, which accounts\r\nfor a 1.3 per cent annual loss in gross domestic product\r\ngrowth in endemic countries.\r\nWe must take the opportunity to reduce the great\r\nburden of disease posed by malaria, a disease that is\r\nboth highly treatable and preventable. This past June,\r\nPresident Bush announced a five-year commitment of\r\n$1.2 billion by the United States for malaria prevention\r\nand treatment in Africa. The funding will be used over\r\nthe next five years to prevent and treat malaria in\r\ntargeted, highly endemic sub-Saharan countries.\r\nOn 1 October, programmes were launched in\r\nAngola, Tanzania and Uganda. The plan is to reach 15\r\ncountries and 175 million people. That initiative is\r\nscaling up a comprehensive approach to malaria by\r\ncombining proven and effective interventions for\r\nprevention and treatment. It includes expanded access\r\nto long-lasting insecticide treated nets and indoor\r\nresidual spraying with approved insecticides; the\r\nprompt use of new artemisinin-based combination\r\ntherapies or other effective therapies; addressing\r\nmalaria in pregnancy and working in partnership with\r\nhost country Governments to build on existing national\r\nprogrammes.\r\nMany actors are taking part in that effort,\r\nincluding the Gates Foundation and other private-\r\n27\r\nA/60/PV.32\r\nsector partners. The work of the Global Fund to Fight\r\nAIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the World Health\r\nOrganization and other multilateral partners are also\r\nkey to our success. Other Governments are stepping\r\nup. At Gleneagles, the G-8 pledged to scale up action\r\nagainst malaria with key interventions to save the lives\r\nof 600,000 children a year by 2015 and to reduce the\r\ndrag on African economies. Those combined efforts\r\ncan save hundreds of thousands of lives annually and\r\nhelp meet the mortality goal for target countries set by\r\nthe Roll Back Malaria Global Strategic Plan.\r\nMr. Tanko (Nigeria): Nigeria is pleased that the\r\nconsideration of the agenda item on Africa remains a\r\nplenary event, and wishes to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and his staff for the reports submitted to the\r\nAssembly.\r\nWe align ourselves with the statements made by\r\nthe representatives of Jamaica and Namibia on behalf\r\nof Group of 77 and China and the African Group,\r\nrespectively.\r\nIn his statement to the General Assembly during\r\nthe general debate last September, President Olusegun\r\nObasanjo presented a brief account on each of the\r\ntroubled hot spots in Africa and highlighted the\r\nsalutary efforts made by the African Union (AU) and\r\nits member countries to address conflicts in the\r\ncontinent. Those efforts are indicative of Africa’s\r\ncommitment and determination to tackle the intractable\r\nproblem of conflicts and peace.\r\nIt is worth repeating that there is a link between\r\ndurable peace, security and sustainable development. It\r\nis also worth underscoring the Secretary-General’s\r\nview that the notion of larger freedom also\r\nencapsulates the idea that development, security and\r\nhuman rights go hand in hand. His conclusion that we\r\ncannot enjoy development without security, that we\r\ncannot enjoy security without development and that we\r\nwill not enjoy either without respect for human rights\r\nis even more apt in the context of the implementation\r\nof the global decisions and commitments relating to\r\nAfrica. Nigeria therefore agrees with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s assertion that, in this new millennium, the\r\nwork of the United Nations must move our world\r\ncloser to the day when all people have the freedom to\r\nchoose the kinds of lives they would like to live, the\r\naccess to the resources that would make those choices\r\nmeaningful and the security to ensure that they can be\r\nenjoyed in peace.\r\nOn the political front, developments in Africa are\r\nvery encouraging for the growth of democracy and\r\nconstitutional governance. African leaders have proven\r\ntheir resolve to oppose any unconstitutional forms of\r\ngovernance. It is not surprising, therefore, that the\r\nSecretary-General’s report, contained in document\r\nA/60/182, acknowledges that most African countries\r\nenjoy relatively stable political conditions and that the\r\nmajority have democratically elected Governments.\r\nHowever, Africa cannot go it alone in its quest\r\nfor, and the promotion of, durable peace and\r\nsustainable development. Nigeria therefore notes with\r\nsatisfaction the range of activities undertaken by\r\nvarious United Nations agencies in that regard. But\r\nthere is much left to be done. For that reason, we\r\nwould like to emphasize that durable peace and\r\nsustainable development must be founded in an\r\nenvironment, at all levels, that promotes transparency,\r\naccountability, economic growth, social harmony,\r\nparticipation, inclusiveness and larger freedoms.\r\nTo achieve that it is imperative to support and\r\nstrengthen the capacity of African Governments — and\r\nespecially of the African Union — to promote lasting\r\npeace and sustainable development. Nigeria calls for\r\nrobust support for the establishment of the full\r\ncomplement of the African Peace and Security\r\nArchitecture, the AU’s Continental Early Warning\r\nSystem and the strengthening of regional efforts to\r\nraise brigades for the African Standby Force. We salute\r\nthose Governments and partners that are already\r\nassisting in that area and urge others to do the same.\r\nNigeria welcomes the recognition in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report that\r\n“If the expected benefits of peace do not\r\nmaterialize, many combatants or other neglected\r\ngroups, such as unemployed youth, return to\r\narms, either in their own country or in one of the\r\nother fragile neighbouring States faced with\r\ninstability.” (A/60/182, para. 48)\r\nIndeed, he stresses the urgency of the need for\r\nadequate funding for reintegration and rehabilitation.\r\nIn that regard, Nigeria would like to add post-conflict\r\nrecovery and reconstruction activities.\r\nNigeria believes that the international community\r\nshould also redouble its efforts to address the economic\r\nand social threats to durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment identified in the Secretary-General’s\r\n28\r\nA/60/PV.32\r\nreport. While noting with appreciation the range of\r\nsupport highlighted in paragraphs 68 to 77 of the report\r\nin document A/60/182, we would like to emphasize\r\nthat there should be a deliberate balance between\r\nsupport for peace and security activities, on the one\r\nhand, and productive activities, on the other, to foster\r\nincome generation, poverty eradication, youth\r\nemployment and the fight against HIV/AIDS, malaria,\r\ntuberculosis and other communicable diseases. Nigeria\r\nhopes that the international community will heed the\r\nSecretary-General’s call to give utmost priority to\r\naddressing the critical issues of youth and\r\nunemployment, and in particular the debilitating\r\nproblems of child soldiers, as well as developing\r\npolicies and programmes for the protection and\r\nempowerment of women.\r\nIn sum, Nigeria expects greater cooperation and\r\ncoordination of efforts in support of peace and\r\ndevelopment in Africa. Furthermore, the lessons that\r\nhave been learned through the work of the Ad Hoc\r\nAdvisory Groups on African countries emerging from\r\nconflict, set up by the Economic and Social Council,\r\nand the Security Council’s Ad Hoc Working Group on\r\nAfrica should be reflected in the formulation of the\r\nmandate and composition of the Peacebuilding\r\nCommission. Its composition must take into account\r\ninvaluable regional experiences in peacebuilding\r\nmeasures. Countries with such experience should be\r\nconsidered for membership in the Peacebuilding\r\nCommission.\r\nThe year 2005 has been pivotal for Africa in\r\nseveral respects, principal among which was the\r\nSeptember summit, where world leaders once more\r\nacknowledged Africa’s special needs and reaffirmed\r\ntheir commitment to address those needs, given that\r\nAfrica remains the only continent not on track to\r\nachieve any of the Millennium Development Goals\r\n(MDGs). In that regard, Nigeria particularly welcomes\r\nthe endorsement by the summit of quick-impact\r\ninitiatives — made popular by the Millennium\r\nProject — to accelerate progress in countries where the\r\nachievement of the MDGs is unlikely given current\r\ntrends. We urge the Assembly to mandate the\r\nSecretary-General to request the Millennium Project to\r\nassist countries that are willing and able to adopt and\r\nimplement bold national development strategies.\r\nThe implementation of NEPAD will allow Africa\r\nto retain its leadership in, and ownership of, the\r\ncontinent’s fight to eradicate poverty and better\r\nintegrate into the global economy. We commend the\r\nSecretary-General for the clarity and quality of his\r\nthird report on international support for the\r\nimplementation of NEPAD (A/60/178). From the report\r\nit is clear that Africa has made progress in translating\r\nsome of the laudable goals of NEPAD into concrete\r\naction, especially in the core priority areas of that\r\ninitiative.\r\nThree main actions will determine the success or\r\nfailure of NEPAD. First, African leaders and\r\nGovernments must sustain their commitment to the\r\nimplementation of NEPAD. Secondly, the international\r\ncommunity, and in particular Africa’s development\r\npartners, must deliver on their various commitments to\r\nAfrica. Thirdly, there must be genuine partnership,\r\nanchored in the cardinal principles of good faith and\r\nmutual accountability, both within Africa and in the\r\noutside world, to tap into the immeasurable potential of\r\nGovernments and the private sector in mobilizing\r\ninternal and external resources for the implementation\r\nof NEPAD.\r\nAs the Secretary General’s report clearly states,\r\nwe would like to reiterate that more and better-targeted\r\naid is needed to help countries escape the poverty trap,\r\nand that bold and integrated strategies on a scale\r\nneeded to meet Africa’s myriad challenges are possible\r\nand can be implemented only through strengthened\r\npartnership.\r\nNigeria agrees with the Secretary-General’s view\r\nthat the articulation of the road map for the\r\nimplementation of the Comprehensive Africa\r\nAgriculture Development Programme was without a\r\ndoubt the most important development during the past\r\nyear. Africa desperately needs a green revolution as the\r\nlaunching pad for its development. That should be\r\nsupported by a bold and imaginative industrial\r\nprogramme. Happily, the priorities of NEPAD have\r\ncovered those areas and more, including education,\r\nscience and technology, health and infrastructure.\r\nIt is abundantly clear that Africa cannot mobilize\r\nthe requisite resources for the implementation of\r\nNEPAD. The international community must therefore\r\nfill the resource gaps, to accelerate the implementation\r\nand realization of the objectives of NEPAD.\r\nNotwithstanding the increase in official development\r\nassistance (ODA) to Africa, it is a matter of concern\r\nthat the changing composition of aid flows could\r\ntranslate into fewer resources available to support the\r\n29\r\nA/60/PV.32\r\ngoals of NEPAD and the Millennium Development\r\nGoals. To address that anomaly, Nigeria strongly\r\nechoes the call for the channelling of more aid\r\nresources to budget support for the implementation of\r\nthe key programmes and sectors of NEPAD. Nigeria\r\ncommends the European Union’s commitment to\r\ndisburse 50 per cent of its increased aid to sub-Saharan\r\nAfrica, and it looks forward to its fulfilment.\r\nFor its part, Africa is committed to strengthening\r\nits governance practices and institutions. That was\r\ndemonstrated by the coming into effect of the African\r\nPeer Review Mechanism. Nigeria is one of five\r\ncountries that have received support missions\r\npreparatory to the self-assessments that will pave the\r\nway for national action plans and will ultimately lead\r\nto peer review. In addition, Nigeria will redeem its\r\npledge of $1 million to finance the Mechanism.\r\nNigeria shares the conclusions and\r\nrecommendations of the Secretary-General. In\r\nparticular, Nigeria emphasizes the need for donors to\r\nhonour their pledges to Africa in an expeditious\r\nmanner. We hope that the next report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the implementation of NEPAD will include\r\nan analysis of the extent and level of the fulfilment of\r\nthe pledges to Africa referred to in paragraph 61 of the\r\nreport contained in document A/60/178.\r\nMoreover, Nigeria hopes that the international\r\ncommunity will make efforts to coordinate the various\r\ninitiatives aimed at assisting Africa. In that regard, we\r\nurge the Secretary-General to move quickly to fill the\r\nvacancy brought about by the recent appointment of\r\nthe former Under-Secretary-General and Special\r\nAdviser on Africa to a new post. Indeed, the visibility\r\nand effectiveness of the Office of the Special Adviser\r\non Africa needs to be strengthened if the mandate of\r\nthe United Nations with regard to Africa is to be\r\nfulfilled.\r\nWhen the Roll Back Malaria global partnership\r\nwas launched, in 1998, with the goal of halving the\r\nburden of malaria by 2010, it held out the promise of\r\nthe alleviation of the suffering of millions of victims\r\naround the world, particularly in Africa, where the\r\ndisease is endemic. Five years away from the target\r\ndate, available statistics show that as many as 3,000\r\nchildren still die in Africa every day from the disease,\r\nand that affected countries will not meet even their\r\nown modest goals by that date. It is tragic that nearly\r\nall countries in which malaria is endemic are also\r\ncaught in a vicious circle of disease and poverty.\r\nIn Nigeria, malaria is responsible for 60 per cent\r\nof outpatient visits to hospitals, 20 per cent of infant\r\nmortality and 11 per cent of maternal deaths. Over\r\n90 per cent of the population of Nigeria is at risk of a\r\nmalaria attack each year. Nevertheless, Nigeria has\r\ntaken a number of concrete steps to fight the menace.\r\nThese include the introduction of a national health\r\ninsurance services scheme, prompt access to\r\nappropriate treatment within 24 hours and the\r\navailability of insecticide-treated bed nets to the most\r\nvulnerable groups of society. In addition, a social\r\nwelfare services scheme has been established that\r\nincludes programmes on qualitative education,\r\nimproving primary health-care facilities and providing\r\nsocial services.\r\nGiven the enormity of the problem, it is obvious\r\nthat African countries and the international community\r\nmust rise to the challenges of malaria and related\r\ndiseases. That becomes even more urgent now that\r\ncertain strains of the malarial parasite have become\r\nresistant to standard medical drugs. In order to give\r\neffect and meaning to the recognition by world leaders\r\nat the 2005 summit that infectious diseases such as\r\nmalaria pose severe risks for the entire world and\r\nserious challenges to the achievement of development\r\ngoals, adequate and predictable domestic and external\r\nresources must be devoted to malaria prevention and\r\ncontrol.\r\nWe look forward to a review of progress in the\r\nimplementation of the resolutions that will result from\r\nthis debate.\r\nMr. Ozawa (Japan): My delegation will touch\r\nupon both agenda item 66 and agenda item 47.\r\nWe would first like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his two comprehensive reports on agenda\r\nitem 66 (A/60/178 and A/60/182).\r\nThe year 2005 has witnessed unprecedented\r\npledges of support for Africa at various forums,\r\nculminating in the pledges declared at the High-level\r\nPlenary Meeting, in September. Japan believes that\r\npromoting the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) will definitely contribute to\r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals in\r\nAfrican countries.\r\n30\r\nA/60/PV.32\r\nJapan welcomes the fact that African countries\r\nhave made much progress in implementing NEPAD\r\nprogrammes since the Partnership’s launching,\r\nespecially in the fields of agriculture and\r\ninfrastructure. We recognize, however, that the\r\ncapacities of the NEPAD secretariat and the regional\r\neconomic communities, which act as its supporting\r\nbodies, need to be strengthened. To that end, Japan will\r\ncontinue to support capacity-building programmes by\r\nmobilizing its aid resources, including technical\r\ncooperation. We also welcome the progress we are\r\nseeing in the African Peer Review Mechanism, and we\r\nwill continue to support the endeavours of African\r\ncountries towards the goal of good governance, while\r\nrespecting their ownership.\r\nJapan is strengthening its partnership with\r\nNEPAD through the Tokyo International Conference on\r\nAfrican Development (TICAD) process, which focuses\r\non three areas: the consolidation of peace, poverty\r\nreduction through economic growth and human-centred\r\ndevelopment. In the interests of time, I will limit my\r\nremarks on agenda item 66 to the consolidation of\r\npeace, and will ask the Assembly to refer to my written\r\nstatement in connection with the two other areas.\r\nJapan welcomes the fact that Africa has\r\nstrengthened its capacity in the area of the\r\nconsolidation of peace. Indeed, without support from\r\nthe African Union, progress towards peace in Burundi,\r\nDarfur and Côte d’Ivoire could not have been made.\r\nPeace-related efforts by the Economic Community of\r\nWest African States, the Central African Economic and\r\nMonetary Community, the Southern Africa\r\nDevelopment Community and the Inter-Governmental\r\nAuthority on Development also deserve\r\ncommendation. Japan truly respects the fact that the\r\ncommitment of African countries to peace is now being\r\ntranslated into concrete action. To encourage such\r\npositive developments, Japan will organize a TICAD\r\nconference on the consolidation of peace early next\r\nyear, focusing on African ownership and human\r\nsecurity.\r\nFor its part, Japan has recently enhanced its\r\nsupport for such actions by African countries by\r\ncontributing about $61 million to such countries as\r\nSierra Leone, Liberia, the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo, the Sudan and Burundi, as well as by\r\ndisbursing emergency grant aid amounting to about\r\n$32 million to support the repatriation and resettlement\r\nof refugees and internally displaced persons in the\r\nSudan.\r\nAllow me now to turn to agenda item 47, on the\r\nDecade to Roll Back Malaria. We are all aware that,\r\nalthough malaria remains a major worldwide health\r\nproblem, we do have at our disposal effective tools to\r\ncontrol the problem. In order to develop effective and\r\nsustainable strategies to combat malaria, we must not\r\nrely on fragmented approaches to disease control, but\r\ninstead work to establish national health care systems.\r\nWe believe that capacity-building in the public health\r\nsector is essential in that regard. At the same time, the\r\namount of international assistance for developing\r\ncountries hardest hit by malaria, especially those in\r\nAfrica, needs to be increased in order to ensure\r\nuniversal access to health services.\r\nTo scale up malaria control efforts, the\r\nGovernment of Japan has announced its health and\r\ndevelopment initiative, which amounts to $5 billion,\r\nand an additional contribution of $500 million in the\r\ncoming years to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,\r\nTuberculosis and Malaria. Also, in response to calls for\r\n“quick win” actions in the Millennium Project report,\r\nJapan has decided to donate 10 million long-lasting\r\ninsecticide-treated anti-mosquito bed nets to African\r\ncountries, the distribution of which has already begun.\r\nIn the private sector, a Japanese company is working to\r\nprovide a reliable supply of low-cost nets.\r\nWe feel that NEPAD provides us with a solid\r\nframework to address the challenges confronting\r\nAfrica. Japan is committed to supporting NEPAD\r\nprogrammes of action in such diverse areas as peace\r\nand security, health and development. With regard to\r\nmalaria, Japan is prepared to work with the\r\ninternational community to pursue effective strategies\r\nto control its spread and eliminate the socio-economic\r\nhandicap it places on many developing countries.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.05 p.m.\r\n"
