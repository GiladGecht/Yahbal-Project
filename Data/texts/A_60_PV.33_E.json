"United Nations A/60/PV.33\r\n \r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixtieth session\r\n33rd plenary meeting\r\nFriday, 14 October 2005, 10 a.m.\r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the interpretation of\r\nspeeches delivered in the other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original\r\nlanguages only. They should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature\r\nof a member of the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room\r\nC-154A. Corrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\r\n05-55356 (E)\r\n*0555356*\r\nPresident: Mr. Eliasson . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Sweden)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 7 (continued)\r\nOrganization of work, adoption of the agenda and\r\nallocation of items\r\nLetter from the Chairman of the Committee on\r\nConferences addressed to the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly (A/60/344/Add.1)\r\nThe President: Members are aware that, pursuant\r\nto paragraph 7 of section I of General Assembly\r\nresolution 40/243, no subsidiary organ of the General\r\nAssembly should be permitted to meet at United\r\nNations Headquarters during the main part of the\r\nAssembly’s regular session unless explicitly authorized\r\nby the Assembly.\r\nAuthorization is thus sought for the International\r\nResearch and Training Institute for the Advancement\r\nof Women to hold the continuation of its session in\r\nNew York during the sixtieth session of the General\r\nAssembly, on the clear understanding that the\r\ncontinuation of the session will have to fit in with the\r\navailable facilities and services and will not affect\r\nadversely the activities of the General Assembly. It is\r\nalso understood that everything possible will be done\r\nto ensure the most efficient use of conference services.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the General\r\nAssembly to authorize the International Research and\r\nTraining Institute for the Advancement of Women to\r\nmeet during the main part of the sixtieth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda items 66 and 47 (continued)\r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development: progress\r\nin implementation and international support\r\n(a) New Partnership for Africa’s Development:\r\nprogress in implementation and international\r\nsupport\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/60/178)\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/60/85)\r\n(b) Causes of conflict and the promotion of durable\r\npeace and sustainable development in Africa\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/60/182)\r\n2001-2010: Decade to Roll Back Malaria in\r\nDeveloping Countries, Particularly in Africa\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/60/208)\r\nMr. Jenie (Indonesia): The delegation of\r\nIndonesia would like to thank the Secretary-General\r\nfor his third consolidated report indicating the progress\r\nbeing made to implement the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) (A/60/178). In\r\ncommenting on the report, Indonesia would like to\r\n2\r\nA/60/PV.33\r\nassociate itself with the statement by the representative\r\nof Malaysia on behalf of the member countries of the\r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), as\r\nwell as with the statement by the representative of\r\nJamaica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nThe report gives us cause to be optimistic and\r\nencourages the international community to see Africa\r\nas a continent of opportunity. Contrary to the persistent\r\nnegative media images circulated around the world\r\ndaily, we get from the report a balanced picture of a\r\ncontinent reinventing itself and using the NEPAD\r\nframework for its development. Indonesia fully\r\nsupports that process, which has led to noteworthy\r\nchanges thus far.\r\nThat is not to suggest that the road ahead is an\r\neasy one. There are constraints. Without significant\r\ninternational support, African States will find it\r\nextremely difficult to implement NEPAD, which will\r\nendow them with the capacity to achieve the\r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) as well. So\r\nfar, they have been able to lay a solid foundation\r\nthrough critical political and social reforms to facilitate\r\nthe implementation process and eventually allow\r\nAfrican States to become fully integrated into the\r\nglobal economy.\r\nLike the 2005 World Summit Outcome\r\n(resolution 60/1), which specifies the role of the\r\ninternational community in the NEPAD\r\nimplementation process, the Secretary-General’s report\r\nis equally precise about the various forms of\r\ninternational support that should be provided.\r\nIndonesia agrees with the view that donors must live\r\nup to their commitments to promote free and fair trade,\r\nwith more reliable access to developed markets, as well\r\nas for affordable antiretroviral drugs to be made easily\r\navailable so that African countries can contain the\r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic, which has severely undermined\r\nthe development process on the continent.\r\nDonors must also increase official development\r\nassistance (ODA) and provide Africa with greater debt\r\nrelief. We therefore support the position taken by the\r\nAfrican Group, as put forward by Namibia, welcoming\r\nthe decision of the G-8 to completely cancel the debt of\r\nheavily indebted poor countries, a measure that has\r\nfound favour with the International Monetary Fund and\r\nthe African Development Bank. But such relief should\r\nbe extended to include countries other than heavily\r\nindebted poor ones, as well as non-African middle-\r\nincome countries.\r\nIn the face of such pressing needs, there can\r\nhardly be enough support to enable Africa to eliminate\r\nunwanted constraints on its development. In that\r\nconnection, and on the basis of its long history of\r\ncooperation with African countries, dating back to the\r\nBandung Conference of 1955, Indonesia has been\r\nactively involved in a number of initiatives that will\r\nhelp to accelerate the implementation of NEPAD and\r\nthe achievement of the MDGs.\r\nPerhaps the most important of those initiatives is\r\nthe New Asian-African Strategic Partnership, which\r\nwas launched during the Asian-African Summit held in\r\nJakarta in April 2005. That Summit commemorated the\r\ngolden jubilee of the 1955 Asian-African Conference,\r\nwhich marked a turning point in the political history of\r\nboth continents. Speaking from a platform for justice,\r\nthe 1955 Conference strengthened resolve for the battle\r\nagainst colonialism.\r\nThe old enemy to Asian-African development\r\nthen was colonialism; the current enemy is poverty.\r\nThe Strategic Partnership is designed to promote not\r\nonly continued political solidarity but also to\r\nstrengthen socio-cultural relations and enhance\r\neconomic cooperation. Of particular concern, therefore,\r\nis the need for poverty reduction. Building on existing\r\ninitiatives, the Partnership will allow Asia and Africa\r\nto pool their resources and expertise for people-centred\r\ndevelopment.\r\nWith human development in mind, an Asian-\r\nAfrican development university network is currently\r\nbeing developed. With the cooperation of the United\r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP), the United\r\nNations University and UNESCO, a pre-feasibility\r\nstudy has already been completed to pinpoint the\r\nresources available to the network to satisfy the\r\nspecific needs that will be addressed initially.\r\nIndonesia is a member of the core group working on\r\nthe network, along with Algeria, Japan and South\r\nAfrica. The network, which embodies the inclusive\r\nspirit of South-South cooperation, has prioritized\r\nagriculture and food security, the promotion of\r\nsmall-and medium-sized enterprises, health and\r\ninfrastructure — primarily power, water,\r\ntelecommunications and transport — for immediate\r\naction.\r\nThe Strategic Partnership will also focus on trade\r\nand investment-facilitation programmes, which will\r\nallow for a consistent and profitable flow of goods and\r\n3\r\nA/60/PV.33\r\nservices between the two regions. As a means of\r\nconstantly expanding that interaction, there will be\r\nregular exchanges of information to encourage the\r\npromotion of trade and business opportunities between\r\nthe two regions.\r\nThe private sectors in both regions are expected\r\nto play a key role in building Asian-African economic\r\ndynamism. To facilitate that cooperation, the Summit\r\nof heads of State and Government also featured the\r\nAsia-Africa Business Summit, which focused on\r\nexploring business opportunities and promoting trade\r\nand investment and ways to generate the required\r\nresources for the initiative. That connection will create\r\nthe possibility for joint ventures, mergers and capital\r\nmarket cooperation. Steps were also taken to address\r\nenergy issues, with the cooperation of the private\r\nsector. The Asian-African Symposium on Renewable\r\nEnergy urged the formulation of an action plan for the\r\ntwo regions covering the period 2005-2015.\r\nMr. Zarif (Islamic Republic of Iran), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair.\r\nThe Partnership will also foster greater people-to-\r\npeople contacts. Prior to the 2005 Asian-African\r\nSummit, Indonesia hosted the Asian-African Workshop\r\non the Role of Women and Youth in April 2005 in\r\nJakarta. The workshop endorsed the need to promote\r\nand improve the status, role and condition of women\r\nand youth within the context of NAASP, as an integral\r\npart of the well-being and prosperity of the two\r\ncontinents.\r\nThrough technical cooperation among developing\r\ncountries, Asian countries — Indonesia included —\r\nhave been able to share information about best\r\npractices for development with African countries and\r\nhave contributed to the pool of skills and expertise that\r\ncan be applied to problem-solving activities affecting\r\nAfrica’s development. Between 1998 and 2005,\r\nIndonesia trained Africans from a number of countries\r\nin such diverse fields as family planning and health,\r\nrural development, agriculture, forestry and\r\nmicrofinance. Within the framework of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement Centre for South-South Technical\r\nCooperation in Indonesia, my country plans to provide\r\nfurther training on small- and medium-sized\r\nenterprises, microfinance and the application of\r\ninformation and communication technology.\r\nThe various initiatives I have mentioned are a\r\nreflection of continued solidarity with and support for\r\nour African brothers, who are now implementing\r\nNEPAD and pursuing the MDGs with the expectation\r\nof success in the future. As mentioned in the NEPAD\r\nCharter, Africans must be the architects of their own\r\nsustained advancement. But for the process of\r\nempowerment and self-reliance to be successful,\r\nexternal support would be helpful. Indonesia will\r\ncontinue to play its part.\r\nMr. Okio (Congo) (spoke in French): Our head\r\nof delegation has asked me to read the following\r\nstatement. I would like to commend the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the excellent report that\r\nhe has presented, for the third consecutive year, on\r\nprogress in implementation of and international\r\nsupport for the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) (A/60/178). Once again, this\r\ncomprehensive report has drawn our attention not only\r\nto the challenges and constraints that we need to tackle\r\nand overcome, but also to progress accomplished in the\r\nimplementation of NEPAD.\r\nOur delegation associates itself with the\r\nstatements made by Martin Andjaba, Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Namibia, on behalf of the African\r\nGroup, and Stafford Neil, Permanent Representative of\r\nJamaica, on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. As\r\nothers delegations have done, I would just like to add a\r\nfew remarks.\r\nFour years ago, African leaders adopted NEPAD\r\nwith the objective of realizing broad and equitable\r\ngrowth that would help Africa to reduce poverty and\r\nbetter integrate itself into the international economy.\r\nAssessing the situation right now, it is very tempting to\r\nsay that very little progress has been made over the\r\npast year — especially given that any progress made is\r\ndwarfed by the extent of such challenges as the illicit\r\ntrade in small arms and light weapons, mercenaries, the\r\nillegal exploitation of natural resources, youth\r\nunemployment and HIV/AIDS. First, however, we\r\nshould be pleased with the efforts made by African\r\ncountries to promote peace and security, as well as to\r\ndevelop NEPAD priority programmes and projects in\r\nareas such as transport, energy, water, health, education\r\nand information technology, environment, agriculture,\r\nscience and technology, and industrialization, among\r\nothers. We are sure that those efforts will yield results\r\nif they are given the necessary support.\r\nThis is also an opportunity to note with\r\nsatisfaction the mobilization of international public\r\n4\r\nA/60/PV.33\r\nopinion in favour of Africa over the past year and the\r\nsupport that donor countries, partners in development,\r\nhave pledged to the continent. We are very impressed\r\nwith the declarations made here by Canada and the\r\nEuropean Union to increase official development\r\nassistance (ODA) and everything else that will be done\r\nin that connection. The Group of Eight decision at\r\nGleneagles to cancel the debt of 18 low-income\r\ncountries, 14 of which are African, and the recent\r\ncommitments undertaken by a number of developed\r\ncountries at the recent world summit to increase their\r\nODA, are also encouraging signs for Africa and for the\r\nimplementation of NEPAD. We hope that some of\r\nthose measures, such as debt cancellation, will be\r\nbroadened to include other groups of countries that\r\nhave been excluded up till now, although they are\r\neligible under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries\r\n(HIPC) Debt Initiative.\r\nIn order to effect urgent implementation of\r\nNEPAD and give it substantial reinforcement, I would\r\nalso like to affirm our support for the key points\r\noutlined by the Secretary-General in his report. At the\r\nregional level, among others, there is a need to build\r\nthe capacities of national and regional institutions\r\ntasked with implementing NEPAD by providing them\r\nwith the appropriate technical skills and adequate\r\nfinancial resources. We must assure greater consistency\r\nand better coordination between national development\r\nplans and NEPAD priorities through, among others, the\r\nNEPAD Peer Review Mechanism, which was set up\r\nwith support from the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme, and to which the Congo already belongs.\r\nWe should also encourage a greater participation by the\r\nprivate sector in the implementation of NEPAD\r\nprojects and programmes. At the international level, we\r\nmust urge Africa’s development partners to be diligent\r\nin disbursing funds for the implementation of NEPAD\r\npriority projects. We must promote and accelerate\r\nSouth-South cooperation, whose importance has\r\nalready been emphasized at the Asian-African Summit\r\nheld in Jakarta in April 2005 and at the second South\r\nSummit held in Doha in June 2005. At the next World\r\nTrade Organization meeting, to be held in Hong Kong\r\nin December 2005, trade decisions need to be made\r\nthat are of particular interest to Africa — namely, the\r\ngradual elimination of rich countries’ subsidies to their\r\nagricultural producers and the granting of access for\r\nAfrican products to international markets. And, finally,\r\nthe quality and coordination of United Nations system\r\nsupport for NEPAD must be improved through regular\r\nin-depth consultations with the African Union.\r\nIn concluding my review, I would like to reaffirm\r\nour support for the third report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. The key points of that report constitute a\r\ngenuine programme for the rapid implementation of\r\nand more efficient support for NEPAD.\r\nMr. Kapoma (Zambia): My delegation wishes to\r\ntake this opportunity to thank the Secretary-General for\r\nhis informative reports on the agenda items we are\r\ndiscussing today. We find those reports to be very\r\nuseful in our discussions.\r\nMy delegation would like to associate itself with\r\nthe statements made by the representatives of Namibia\r\non behalf of the African Group, Lesotho on behalf of\r\nthe countries members of the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community (SADC) and Jamaica on\r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nAt their Lusaka summit in 2001, the heads of\r\nState and Government of the African Union (AU)\r\nadopted the New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD) programme, the main objective of which is\r\nto enhance the capacity of African countries to reduce\r\nthe high incidence of poverty on the continent and to\r\nstrengthen efforts to achieve economic development.\r\nWhile we acknowledge the fact that the support\r\nprovided so far by the international community has\r\nassisted us in the process of attaining NEPAD’s\r\nobjectives, it is also true that that support has proved to\r\nbe insufficient and needs to be increased. Although\r\nNEPAD is an initiative by and for African countries\r\nthemselves, there is an urgent need for more support\r\nfrom the international community.\r\nThe African Union has adopted the African Peer\r\nReview Mechanism, whose mandate is to ensure that\r\nthe policies and practices of participating countries\r\nconform to the agreed political, economic and\r\ncorporate values, codes and standards contained in the\r\nDeclaration on Democracy, Political, Economic and\r\nCorporate Governance of the African Union. To that\r\nend, member States of the African Union have\r\ncommitted themselves to adopting relevant laws,\r\npolicies and standards and to building the necessary\r\nhuman and institutional capacities.\r\nWithin the framework of NEPAD, Zambia is\r\nfocusing on the provision of infrastructure at the\r\nnational level by upgrading existing infrastructures and\r\n5\r\nA/60/PV.33\r\nconstructing new ones in the sectors of agriculture,\r\ntourism, mining, education, health and human\r\nresources.\r\nWith regard to malaria, Zambia fully supports the\r\nconclusions and recommendations of the World Health\r\nOrganization contained in document A/60/208, which,\r\namong other things, states that malaria-endemic\r\ncountries should assess and respond to the need for\r\nintegrated human resources at all levels. That would be\r\nin accordance with the targets of the 2000 Abuja\r\nDeclaration to Roll Back Malaria in Africa and with\r\nthe internationally agreed Development Goals of the\r\nUnited Nations Millennium Declaration.\r\nMy Government, together with cooperating\r\npartners, have launched the national malaria control\r\nstrategy, whose goal is to accelerate and document the\r\nimpact of progress towards meeting Zambia’s malaria\r\ncontrol target. In that regard, my Government has\r\nadopted a new malaria treatment policy to overcome\r\nthe problem of drug resistance. Furthermore, we have\r\nremained committed to health reform despite the many\r\nchallenges the health sector is facing, and we continue\r\nto provide subsidized insecticide-treated nets and drugs\r\nto needy communities.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the September 2005\r\noutcome document (resolution 60/1) of the United\r\nNations world summit, which, among other things,\r\nrecognizes that HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and\r\nother infectious diseases pose severe risks for the\r\nentire world. Those diseases remain serious challenges\r\nto the achievement of the Millennium Development\r\nGoals. My Government, through an act of Parliament,\r\nhas established the National HIV/AIDS/STI/TB\r\nCouncil to coordinate all interventional efforts.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation appeals to the\r\ninternational community as a whole, and in particular\r\nto the United Nations system, to continue to provide\r\nsupport to Zambia in the fight against malaria and\r\nother infectious diseases.\r\nMr. Aliyev (Azerbaijan): My delegation\r\nappreciates the opportunity to participate in this joint\r\ndebate and to share its views on issues related to the\r\npromotion of development and durable peace in Africa.\r\nThe third consolidated report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral (A/60/178) provides useful analysis of\r\nprogress and constraints encountered within the\r\nreporting period. In that regard, we would like to\r\ncommend the work of the Secretary-General’s\r\nAdvisory Panel on International Support for the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), the\r\nconclusion of which is crystal-clear: “NEPAD cannot\r\nsucceed without a significant increase in support from\r\nthe international community” (Ibid., para. 3).\r\nWe are pleased to find that an unprecedented\r\nincrease in international attention in support of Africa\r\nhas been observed. Therefore, we would like to pay\r\ntribute to Mr. Ibrahim Gambari, former Special\r\nAdviser on Africa, for his dedication to promoting the\r\nglobal partnership for Africa’s development. Likewise,\r\nwe praise the efforts of African countries themselves\r\nand the progress made in the areas of good governance,\r\ndemocracy and human rights. The positive shift in\r\nnearly all priority areas agreed within the NEPAD\r\nframework is also an encouraging sign. However,\r\nanother — and perhaps the most important —\r\nattainment is the increase in the regional integration\r\ncomponent, the building of regional economic\r\ncommunities and ultimately the consolidation of a\r\nholistic approach to development on the basis of\r\nnational ownership. We believe that those positive\r\nsigns will serve as an impetus to further strengthen\r\ninternational support aimed at overcoming\r\ndevelopment challenges.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report states clearly that\r\nthe absence of infrastructure remains a serious\r\nchallenge and has a broad range of implications.\r\nTherefore, we believe that increased investments in the\r\narea of capacity-building and infrastructure\r\ndevelopment will yield long-term benefits.\r\nFurthermore, regional and subregional\r\ncooperative arrangements, backed by international\r\nsupport, could enhance the development of energy\r\ncorridors, an efficient transit-transport system and\r\nincreased regional trade turnover. In the long run, such\r\narrangements could have the potential to build a self-\r\nsufficient regional economic network. In the meantime,\r\nwe are convinced that support for the social sector —\r\nparticularly for the areas of health and education —\r\nshould be an essential component of the overall\r\ninternational framework for providing assistance to\r\nNEPAD’s economic agenda.\r\nWe believe that South-South cooperation — in\r\nparticular the training of health professionals and\r\nknowledge exchange programmes — has the potential\r\n6\r\nA/60/PV.33\r\nto address existing challenges in the area of health\r\ndelivery and management.\r\nWith regard to the international response, we\r\nwelcome and support the according of priority to\r\nAfrica’s needs on the international development agenda\r\nand the reaffirmation of our commitments in the 2005\r\nWorld Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1).\r\nFurthermore, we hail recent initiatives in the areas of\r\naid and debt relief. We also consider the forthcoming\r\nministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization to\r\nbe a crucial opportunity to make the trade regime more\r\nfavourable and development-oriented, especially in the\r\ninterest of the least developed countries.\r\nWe studied with great interest the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report in document A/60/182. It presents a\r\nuseful overview of conflict trends in Africa as well as\r\nan analysis of the effectiveness of international\r\ncooperation in the areas of conflict prevention and\r\nresolution, peacekeeping operations, reconstruction\r\nand rehabilitation.\r\nAlthough there are fewer countries in a state of\r\narmed conflict and civil strife on the continent, we\r\nshould obviously not be complacent because of what\r\nhas been achieved so far. Economic and social threats,\r\non the one hand, and internal conflicts, on the other,\r\ncontinue to jeopardize dialogues aimed at\r\nconsolidating the peace. We are convinced that the\r\ninternational community should address those threats\r\nin a timely, coherent and comprehensive manner, with\r\nthe United Nations playing a leading role.\r\nHere, we should mention the strengthening of\r\nAfrican Union’s peacebuilding and peacekeeping\r\ncapacities. We support the Secretary-General’s\r\nrecommendation that “it is vital for the international\r\ncommunity to provide the necessary financial support\r\nto develop African Union peacekeeping capacity and to\r\nestablish the African Standby Force” (A/60/182,\r\npara. 81).\r\nWith regard to peacebuilding and reconstruction,\r\nwe believe that disarmament, the reintegration of\r\nrefugees and post-conflict long-term development\r\nshould be one of the most important and essential\r\ncomponents of post-conflict activities. Therefore, we\r\nhave supported the establishment of the Peacebuilding\r\nCommission and look forward to its early\r\nimplementation.\r\nBecause Azerbaijan is a conflict-affected country\r\nand one whose economy is in transition, it has limited\r\nfinancial resources to channel to the implementation of\r\nNEPAD. However, we stand ready to provide our\r\ninstitutional and human capacities for the benefit of\r\nthis Partnership. As an oil-producing and exporting\r\ncountry, Azerbaijan holds a strong comparative\r\nadvantage in educating petroleum engineers, workers\r\nand researchers. For decades, many young and\r\nambitious men and women from fraternal African\r\ncountries have received their higher education in our\r\nOil Academy, as well as in other educational\r\ninstitutions. We are proud to say that today many of\r\nthem occupy important positions in their respective\r\nGovernments and in the private sector across Africa\r\nand contribute to their national development.\r\nAzerbaijan is ready to provide assistance in educating\r\nand training young African professionals. We believe\r\nthat the continuation of this partnership would be a\r\ngood contribution to building African human capacity\r\nand ensure sustainable and rational management of\r\nnatural resources throughout the entire African\r\ncontinent.\r\nMr. Chaudhry (Pakistan): For the third year\r\nrunning, this Assembly is jointly considering the\r\nprogress in the implementation of and international\r\nsupport for the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) and the recommendations of\r\nthe Secretary-General. We welcome this practice. It is\r\nin line with the long-held view, also recognized\r\nrecently by the 2005 September summit, that\r\ndevelopment and peace and security are interlinked and\r\nmutually reinforcing. Durable peace can be achieved\r\nonly through a comprehensive strategy.\r\nWe are pleased to note that the two\r\ncomplementary reports of the Secretary-General under\r\nthis agenda item present a comprehensive picture of\r\nthe progress made in promoting sustainable\r\ndevelopment and peace and security in Africa over the\r\npast year.\r\nEconomic and social threats, including poverty,\r\ninfectious disease and environmental degradation, as\r\nwell as internal conflicts, continue to afflict the\r\ncontinent. The Secretary-General has noted that while\r\nthe international community’s attention has been\r\nforcefully directed to the importance of such threats,\r\nthere is concern that the financial and human resources\r\nrequired to solve the multidimensional interlinked\r\nproblems will fall well short of what is needed.\r\n7\r\nA/60/PV.33\r\nIt is encouraging that last month’s United Nations\r\nsummit resolved to strengthen cooperation with\r\nNEPAD by mobilizing internal and external financial\r\nresources to support Africa. The 2005 summit also\r\nreaffirmed that development is a central goal in itself.\r\nPakistan strongly believes that development is the best\r\nmeans of preventing conflict in the first place, not just\r\nto prevent a relapse into conflict.\r\nWe commend the African leadership for their\r\nvision in launching NEPAD, an Africa-led, Africa-\r\nowned and Africa-driven initiative providing an\r\nintegrated and comprehensive framework for Africa’s\r\nsustainable growth and development.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General on progress\r\nin implementation and international support for\r\nNEPAD (A/60/178) rightly calls attention to the\r\nchallenges and constraints in its implementation. We\r\nsupport the Secretary-General’s recommendations\r\ncalling for, first, building the capacity of national and\r\nregional institutions entrusted with the tasks of\r\nimplementing NEPAD; secondly, ensuring greater\r\ncoherence and coordination between national\r\ndevelopment plans and NEPAD priorities; thirdly,\r\npromoting greater involvement of the private sector in\r\nthe implementation of NEPAD programmes and\r\nprojects; fourthly, the international community’s\r\nhonouring of commitments made and delivering the\r\npledged support; and fifthly, African countries showing\r\ntheir commitment to social and economic reforms\r\nthrough sound economic management and the\r\nimplementation of NEPAD priorities.\r\nWe welcome the World Bank’s initiative to\r\ndevelop the Africa Action Plan.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s progress report relating\r\nto the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable\r\npeace and sustainable development in Africa\r\n(A/60/182) highlights in particular the need for special\r\nattention to post-conflict reconstruction and\r\npeacebuilding, which is of significant relevance to\r\nAfrica. Resolution 59/255, adopted by the General\r\nAssembly last year, emphasized the need for continued\r\ncollaboration between the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil and the Security Council in generating a\r\ncoherent approach.\r\nIn the context of peace and security, a major\r\nachievement of the September summit was the decision\r\nto establish the Peacebuilding Commission, which is of\r\nhigh relevance to Africa. Africa also stands to gain\r\nimmensely from the summit’s decisions on the peaceful\r\nsettlement of disputes, conflict prevention,\r\npeacekeeping, the rule of law, internally displaced\r\npersons, refugee protection and assistance, protection\r\nfrom genocide, system-wide coherence — in particular\r\nfor humanitarian assistance — and cooperation with\r\nregional organizations.\r\nThe challenge ahead is to implement all these\r\ndecisions and commitments. This requires the\r\ncontinued and sustained support of the international\r\ncommunity. We welcome in that context the\r\ncommitment for long-term support to Africa from the\r\nEuropean Union and the Group of Eight.\r\nFor its part, Pakistan has consistently backed the\r\npolitical and economic aspirations of Africa and\r\nstrongly supports effective and speedy implementation\r\nof NEPAD’s objectives.\r\nIn the field of peace and security, Pakistan is\r\nproud of its contribution to the United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations in Africa. Our military and\r\ncivilian personnel have been part of United Nations\r\noperations in Burundi, Côte d’Ivoire, the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, Liberia, Namibia, Sierra\r\nLeone, Somalia and Western Sahara.\r\nIn the context of South-South cooperation,\r\nPakistan has been providing assistance to African\r\ncountries in various fields. Under the Government’s\r\nspecial technical assistance programme for Africa,\r\nhundreds of young African professionals have received\r\ntraining in Pakistan in various fields, including\r\nbanking, public administration, diplomacy and civil\r\naviation. Pakistan also offers military training to\r\nofficers from a number of African countries. We are in\r\nthe process of further expanding the scope and scale of\r\nour assistance and cooperation programmes for Africa.\r\nI wish to conclude by saying that the challenges\r\nfaced by Africa are colossal, but the opportunities,\r\nmeans and resources to address those challenges are\r\nalso immense. NEPAD presents a realistic framework\r\nfor action. The African Union is emerging as a\r\ndynamic factor promoting African ownership in\r\ntackling Africa’s problems. The subregional\r\norganizations in the African continent are also playing\r\nan important role. We are hopeful that these regional\r\nand subregional mechanisms will be able to devote\r\nmore attention and resources to social and economic\r\ndevelopment in the future as conflicts and crises that\r\n8\r\nA/60/PV.33\r\nsap most of their energy at present are brought under\r\ncontrol.\r\nImportant and far reaching international\r\ncommitments are there to assist Africa. With the\r\ncommensurate political will on the part of the\r\ninternational community, in particular the developed\r\nworld, to faithfully implement these commitments,\r\nAfrica can hope to realize its full political and\r\neconomic potential, thus contributing to international\r\npeace and security.\r\nMr. Irhiam (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in\r\nArabic): Sir, I am happy to see you presiding over our\r\ndiscussion of items of particular importance for the\r\nAfrican continent, to which my country belongs. I wish\r\nto pay tribute to the preliminary statement of the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly; it is important, and\r\nI am sure it will play an important role in our\r\ndiscussions on this subject. I would also like to endorse\r\nthe statements made by the representatives of Namibia\r\nand Jamaica, on behalf of the African Group and the\r\nGroup of 77 and China, respectively.\r\nAfrican heads of State have long understood that\r\nachieving peace and stability on the African continent\r\nis a prerequisite for development. That has been\r\nrepeatedly reaffirmed by the Secretary-General in his\r\nreports to the General Assembly. The African Union\r\n(AU) has therefore made every effort necessary to\r\nachieve international peace and security on our beloved\r\ncontinent, especially by establishing the Peace and\r\nSecurity Council, which has been charged with the\r\nresponsibilities of defining threats to peace and of\r\nmaintaining peace. The AU has also strengthened its\r\ncapacities to intervene and mediate by establishing the\r\nAfrican Peace Facility. It is now attempting to establish\r\nan African Standby Force and a Continental Early\r\nWarning System.\r\nWhile we pay tribute to the effective contribution\r\nof the United Nations in resolving conflicts and\r\nestablishing peace on the African continent, we also\r\nhope that the international community will provide the\r\nfinancial support necessary to strengthen the capacities\r\nof the AU in the area of maintaining peace, in order\r\nthat it can succeed in ending all conflicts on the\r\ncontinent, especially since the number of such conflicts\r\nhas been greatly reduced in recent years.\r\nAfrican leaders have reaffirmed their\r\ncommitment and determination to ensure the success of\r\nthe New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD) by adopting effective measures to implement\r\nit, given that it is an initiative aimed at achieving the\r\naspirations of African countries in comprehensive\r\ndevelopment and ensuring their integration into the\r\nglobal economy. Africa is well aware that it has the\r\nprimary responsibility for the implementation of\r\nNEPAD. However, the chronic weakness of African\r\neconomies, resulting from the plundering of resources\r\nand the deprivation of Africans during the long period\r\nof colonization, leaves African countries no choice but\r\nto resort to the financial support of the United Nations\r\nsystem, international financial institutions and\r\ndeveloped countries in order to reach NEPAD’s goals.\r\nIn his report in document A/60/178, the\r\nSecretary-General points out that NEPAD can succeed\r\nonly with considerable increased support from the\r\ninternational community. The report also states that it\r\nis urgent that the commitments made by Africa’s\r\ndevelopment partners be translated into concrete\r\nresults.\r\nWithout going into details and figures, I would\r\nlike to underscore Libya’s contribution to various\r\nfields of development in African countries. We have\r\nprovided assistance to combat epidemic diseases and\r\novercome the effects of natural disasters — including\r\nfloods, droughts and infestation by locusts and other\r\npests. We should also like point to our involvement in\r\nSouth-South cooperation with neighbourly Nigeria and\r\nfriendly Cuba in the medical field in order to set up\r\nclinics and medical centres to provide treatment and\r\nmedicines in many African countries.\r\nTaking into consideration the rise in the price of\r\noil and its disastrous effects on African countries,\r\nparticularly those experiencing economic crises, Libya\r\nhas called for the convening of a meeting of African\r\noil-producing countries to find a solution to this\r\nproblem.\r\nGiven the bleak statistics on Africa and the\r\nprevalence of such diseases as AIDS, malaria and\r\ntuberculosis — with their human consequences and the\r\nmaterial and financial effects on budgets and\r\ndevelopment plans on the continent — we believe that\r\nthe future consequences of the situation will have an\r\nimpact upon peace and security not only in Africa, but\r\nalso in the world at large. In that regard, allow me to\r\nconvey to the General Assembly what a journalist\r\nreported on his visit to an African village. He found\r\nonly old men and women, as well as children, but no\r\n9\r\nA/60/PV.33\r\none representing the age groups in between. The\r\njournalist thought that the young had gone to\r\nneighbouring villages and cities to find work in various\r\nareas, but he was surprised to learn that the young\r\npeople had simply died of AIDS. The only people left\r\nin the village were children and old people, some of\r\nwhom also carried the disease. That story reminds us\r\nof Africa’s difficult situation.\r\nWe have recognized that peace, security,\r\ndevelopment and human rights are inextricably linked.\r\nThey constitute the pillars of the international order\r\nand the foundations of peace and prosperity. It is for\r\nthat reason that it is difficult for the international\r\ncommunity to enjoy those concepts in the absence of\r\ndevelopment in Africa. There cannot be overall\r\ndevelopment and stability in the world without\r\ndevelopment in Africa.\r\nWe would like to take this opportunity to pay\r\ntribute to the World Health Organization and Joint\r\nUnited Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS for their\r\nefforts to combat AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. We\r\nalso wish to emphasize the important role played by\r\ndoctors and other health workers in African countries.\r\nWe would like to emphasize that developed\r\ncountries must keep their promises. The time has come\r\nfor words to be translated into concrete actions.\r\nMr. Zhdanovich (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): In\r\ndebating the problems in Africa, we are pleased to note\r\nthe positive nature of recent trends on the continent.\r\nThese include a significant reduction in the number of\r\nmajor conflicts, the establishment of the African Peer\r\nReview Mechanism to support national efforts to\r\nstrengthen the system of political, economic and\r\ncorporate governance, and an increase in the rate of\r\neconomic growth on the continent, although it is not\r\nyet sufficient to ensure the implementation of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nWe view the strengthening of stability on the\r\nAfrican continent as one of the major challenges facing\r\nthe international community. Achieving that must\r\nbecome a critical component of developing a global\r\nsystem under the auspices of the United Nations to\r\nconfront the threats and challenges of today’s world.\r\nAlong with the rest of the international\r\ncommunity, Belarus welcomes the establishment of the\r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD).\r\nNEPAD reflects the desire of the peoples of Africa to\r\ntake the issues of development on the continent into\r\ntheir own hands and to put an end to hunger, poverty,\r\nillness and inequality. We are convinced that the\r\ninternational community must more actively support\r\nthe process of implementing that programme, in\r\nparticular by allocating to it the appropriate financial\r\nresources.\r\nIn the run up to the 2005 World Summit, much\r\nwas said — in particular by our partners from the\r\nindustrialized countries — about the importance of\r\ngood governance at all levels for sustainable economic\r\ngrowth and social progress throughout the world.\r\nNEPAD is a vivid example of good governance\r\non the regional level. We believe that the recently held\r\nUnited Nations summit must become a starting point\r\nfor an acceleration of the process of implementing that\r\nprogramme. In an era of globalization, not only would\r\nthat make Africa a winner, but the entire world as well.\r\nMrs. Núñez de Odremán: (Bolivarian Republic\r\nof Venezuela) (spoke in Spanish): The Bolivarian\r\nRepublic of Venezuela supports the statement made by\r\nthe Jamaican Ambassador on behalf of the Group of 77\r\nand China. However, we would like to comment, in\r\nparticular concerning our country, with reference to the\r\nitem discussed today.\r\nDuring the eighteenth century, Africans from\r\nSenegal, Sierra Leone, Benin and the Gulf of Guinea\r\nwere brought to colonial Venezuela, where they were\r\nsubjected to slavery in the same manner as they were\r\nin all regions of the Caribbean. They were used as\r\nmanpower on coffee, cocoa and sugarcane plantations\r\nand as domestic workers by the Creole landowners and\r\ncolonial authorities, who ruled the land.\r\nWhile they were not a majority of the Venezuelan\r\npopulation, which consisted of Spanish descendants\r\nand various indigenous groups among others, they\r\nwere a large part of the population and formed a core\r\npopulation in areas along the approximately 2,000\r\nkilometres of the Venezuelan Caribbean coastline. That\r\nis where the roots of African culture were sown; today\r\nthey form a proud part of the vibrancy of our cultural\r\nheritage and our national identity.\r\nThree centuries of racial intermingling have led\r\nto an African imprint on all the regions of our country,\r\nthroughout which our people’s faces reveal, in an\r\nindivisible mixture, their African and indigenous\r\n10\r\nA/60/PV.33\r\nancestry along with their Spanish genetic and cultural\r\ninheritance.\r\nThe process of gaining independence from\r\nSpanish imperialism was transformed from a class\r\nstruggle to a national one by the action taken in 1816\r\nby the elite civilian and military liberators, who were\r\nnurtured by the first anti-colonial rebellion in the\r\nCaribbean — the Haitian Revolution of 1804.\r\nSubsequently our liberator, Simón Bolívar, out of\r\ngratitude for the solidarity of the people and\r\nGovernment of Haiti, issued a decree in 1816 to\r\nembark from Haiti, land on the east coast of Venezuela\r\nand declare the liberation of the slaves in Venezuela —\r\nan act that had a decisive impact on the strengthening\r\nof the process of emancipation of our countries. That\r\nliberation was subsequently confirmed and further\r\ndeveloped in 1854 during the Government of the\r\nBolivarian General José Gregorio Monagas.\r\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, the Bolivarian\r\nRepublic of Venezuela continued to pursue a foreign\r\npolicy begun during the Second World War, namely to\r\noffer its support for achieving the independence of\r\nAfrican peoples, including in some areas where great\r\nconflicts took place during the struggles for national\r\nliberation, as was the case in Namibia. We also\r\nmaintained a position — from the rostrum of this\r\nAssembly — supporting the elimination of apartheid in\r\nSouth Africa.\r\nAfrican colonial inheritance persists today as a\r\nreality for the peoples of the continent, subject directly\r\nor indirectly to intervention by the former colonial\r\nPowers, which have resisted abandoning their past\r\npractices. We must therefore resolutely confront\r\ndivision, exploitation, exclusion, poverty and hunger,\r\nas a result of that scourge.\r\nToday we appreciate the demographic strength,\r\nthe hydrologic potential, the arable lands, the mineral\r\nwealth and the profound awareness of the African\r\nleaders and the resurgence of their will to achieve\r\nintegration and their devotion to multilateralism and\r\npresence in the international community as a regional\r\nprogressive identity. We welcome that identity as\r\nindispensable for achieving balance among nations and\r\nthe eradication of hunger, universal poverty and the\r\nexclusion of peoples.\r\nThe Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has\r\nassumed a growing role in its relations with Africa and\r\nwe share the suffering, achievements and dreams of\r\nAfricans as brothers. We have built bridges of\r\nfriendship, solidarity and identity towards Africa\r\nthrough our foreign policy to defend sovereignty,\r\nmultipolarity and multilateralism as well as their\r\ninstitutional expression, as we also share our untiring\r\nstruggle against poverty at the global level.\r\nAt the beginning of 2005 our relations with the\r\nAfrican continent were, we believe, meagre and\r\ninadequate. They scarcely existed with Algeria, Libya,\r\nMorocco, Egypt, Nigeria, South Africa, Senegal,\r\nKenya, Namibia, Angola, Benin, Cameroon, Côte\r\nd’Ivoire, Gabon, Ghana, Equatorial Guinea, Lesotho,\r\nRwanda, the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic,\r\nTanzania, Tunisia, Togo, Uganda, Zambia and\r\nZimbabwe, where there were few embassies and in\r\nmost cases representation was present only as needed.\r\nThere were no relations with the other 20 African\r\ncountries, most of them in sub-Saharan Africa.\r\nIn December 2004, we established a new section\r\nin the Ministry for Foreign Affairs — the Vice\r\nMinistry for Africa. During its short existence it has\r\nestablished diplomatic relations with the Republic of\r\nthe Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\r\nMauritius, Chad and Somalia. We have adhered to the\r\nUnited Nations Convention to Combat Desertification.\r\nHumanitarian aid in the amount of $3 million has been\r\nprovided to Burkina Faso, Mauritania and Niger in the\r\ncontext of South-South cooperation.\r\nA subcommittee for Asia the Middle East and\r\nAfrica was created within the National Assembly. That\r\nsubcommittee has made three visits, the first in March\r\n2005 to Morocco and Mali, the second to Sudan and\r\nEgypt in June and the third to Senegal, Gambia, Benin\r\nand Nigeria in October. It was announced that by next\r\nyear, the Republic will have relations with all of the\r\nAfrican States. The subcommittee has submitted a\r\nrequest to join the African Union as an observer State.\r\nLastly, from 13 to 20 November 2005, there will be a\r\nVenezuelan cultural festival with the African people.\r\nEighteen African nations have already confirmed their\r\nintention to attend.\r\nFinally, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela\r\nwelcomes the political measures and initiatives\r\nadopted by African countries and organizations with a\r\nview to implementing the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD).\r\n11\r\nA/60/PV.33\r\nMr. Zenna (Ethiopia): Allow me to express my\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations, Mr. Kofi Annan, for establishing the Advisory\r\nPanel on International Support for the New Partnership\r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD). I would also like\r\nto thank the Secretary-General’s Advisory Panel on\r\nNEPAD for its report, entitled “From rhetoric to action:\r\nmobilizing international support to unleash Africa’s\r\npotential” (A/60/85).\r\nMy delegation associates itself with the\r\nstatements made by the Permanent Representatives of\r\nJamaica, on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, and\r\nNamibia, on behalf of the African Group.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General on progress\r\nin implementation and international support for\r\nNEPAD (A/60/178) once again brings to the attention\r\nof the international community the need to remain\r\nengaged with Africa as regards the basic tenets of\r\nNEPAD. In our view, the two central messages of the\r\nreport are a reflection of the mutual responsibility and\r\naccountability underpinning NEPAD. That is what\r\nAfrican leaders had in mind when they initiated\r\nNEPAD. Indeed, the Partnership cannot succeed\r\nwithout a significant increase in support from the\r\ninternational community, nor can it succeed without\r\nAfrica’s commitment to improved economic and\r\npolitical governance.\r\nThe primary focus of the African Union is to put\r\nthe continent’s socio-economic development agenda at\r\nthe forefront and to work closely with its partners to\r\nbring about real changes in development on the\r\ncontinent. In that regard, NEPAD is the most effective\r\ninstrument to promote the socio-economic agenda for\r\nthe betterment of the people of Africa and to put Africa\r\nin the international development spotlight.\r\nLet me take this opportunity to briefly highlight\r\nthe major steps taken under NEPAD at the regional\r\nlevel in accordance with its programme of action.\r\nUnder the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture\r\nDevelopment Programme, bankable projects have been\r\nprepared in more than 30 African countries and\r\ntremendous efforts have been made to develop a\r\ntracking mechanism to monitor the commitments made\r\nby African Governments to allocate 10 per cent of their\r\nnational budgets to agriculture.\r\nWith regard to NEPAD’s African Peer Review\r\nMechanism (APRM), the panel of eminent persons\r\nmaking up this programme has already been identified.\r\nAs of August 2005, 25 countries, including my own,\r\nhave voluntarily signed up for the APRM, and the\r\nprocess has begun with a number of reviews.\r\nIn the area of infrastructure and capacity-\r\nbuilding, high-priority projects have been approved by\r\nthe NEPAD Heads of State and Government\r\nImplementation Committee to be implemented by\r\nregional economic communities.\r\nEthiopia has been engaged in implementing\r\nvarious policies and programmes that are in line with\r\nNEPAD. Efforts are being made in the areas of\r\npolitical and economic governance. On 15 May 2005,\r\nEthiopia carried out its third-ever multiparty elections.\r\nEfforts are also under way to improve the public sector,\r\nwith a view to making it much more transparent,\r\naccountable and efficient. Ethiopia has designed, and\r\nbegun to implement, a capacity-building strategy in the\r\npublic sector. Anti-corruption measures have also been\r\nput in place.\r\nWith regard to expenditure targets — in\r\nconformity with Ethiopia’s long-term development\r\nstrategy, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs),\r\nour sustainable development and poverty reduction\r\nprogramme and NEPAD — Government spending has\r\nbeen progressively oriented towards poverty reduction\r\nexpenditure in the areas of education, health and\r\nagriculture.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nWith regard to the gender perspective and the\r\nempowerment of women, several measures have been\r\nundertaken in recent years to enhance the\r\nempowerment of women. In that connection, the\r\nWomen’s Affairs Office, which is under the Prime\r\nMinster’s Office, has been preparing a national plan of\r\naction on gender equality, which is also in line with the\r\nBeijing Declaration of the Fourth World Conference on\r\nWomen. The Women’s Affairs Office has recently been\r\nupgraded to the ministerial level.\r\nWe share the views expressed by the Advisory\r\nPanel with respect to the growing consensus of what\r\nneeds to be done in Africa and the priority areas\r\nidentified for implementation. Indeed, without\r\ntransforming the rural and agricultural sectors of\r\nAfrica, without investing in the development of its\r\nhuman resources, without creating an enabling climate\r\nfor the private sector through investing in physical\r\n12\r\nA/60/PV.33\r\ninfrastructure, without improvements in governance in\r\nAfrica and without squarely addressing conflicts and\r\nbringing peace, we cannot think of attaining\r\nsustainable growth and development in Africa. An\r\nefficient, supportive and capable public sector is of\r\ncourse vital to achieving those goals.\r\nRegarding conflict resolution and the promotion\r\nof peace at the continental level, we are encouraged by\r\nthe dynamism that the new African Union has injected\r\ninto the joint African effort towards peace and stability.\r\nAs to the spirit envisioned by NEPAD, Africa’s\r\npartners have also been increasing their commitment to\r\nsupport Africa’s efforts. The recent decisions by the\r\nGroup of Eight industrialized countries and the\r\nEuropean Union in favour of the development of\r\nAfrica, and the subsequent endorsement by the\r\ninternational community at the recent summit last\r\nSeptember confirm the growing recognition of the need\r\nfor action in support of Africa. Pledges by partners\r\nrange from doubling official development assistance to\r\nAfrica from its current level to $50 billion dollars by\r\n2010, and debt relief to address the pressing challenges\r\nin the areas of agriculture, health, education and\r\ninfrastructure. Ethiopia welcomes those efforts. We are\r\nconfident that, in keeping with the title of the Advisory\r\nPanel’s report, we will be able to move from rhetoric to\r\naction.\r\nMalaria is one of Ethiopia’s foremost health\r\nproblems, ranking at the top of the list of\r\ncommunicable diseases. Malaria is endemic in three\r\nquarters of the country’s land mass, and about two\r\nthirds of the population is at risk of infection. As a\r\nresult, considerable attention has been given to malaria\r\ncontrol from the very inception of the country’s health\r\nsector development programme, in order to reduce the\r\noverall burden of the disease’s morbidity and mortality.\r\nThe previous system of a vertical approach to\r\nmalaria prevention and control has been phased out,\r\nand the service responsible for it has been integrated\r\ninto the basic health service delivery system in order to\r\nensure sustainability and the effective prevention and\r\ncontrol of malaria in general, and epidemics in\r\nparticular. The national strategic plan for the control of\r\nmalaria in Ethiopia was developed on the basis on the\r\nframework of the World Health Organization’s Roll\r\nBack Malaria Global Strategic Plan. That plan aims to\r\nreduce the burden of malaria by 25 per cent by the end\r\nof this year, and achieve the Abuja Roll Back Malaria\r\ntarget of 50 per cent by the year 2010. The utilization\r\nof insecticide-treated nets (ITN) is to be enhanced to\r\n60 per cent by the year 2007. Early diagnosis and\r\nprompt treatment, the spraying of houses with\r\ninsecticides, the distribution of ITNs and prompt\r\ncommunity participation in the prevention and control\r\nof malaria have been priority interventions to date.\r\nWith regard to the mobilization of resources to\r\ncombat malaria, multilateral donors have mobilized to\r\nestablish a malaria control support team. This team\r\nhelps to identify, and fill gaps in the malaria prevention\r\nand control programme. Significant achievement has\r\nalso been made in soliciting funds from the Global\r\nFund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria during\r\nthe implementation period. Furthermore, cost estimates\r\nfor the full set of interventions required to achieve the\r\nMDGs with respect to reversing the course of malaria\r\nin Ethiopia has been completed.\r\nThose and other achievements have not been\r\nwithout challenges. Overcoming a shortage of, and\r\nhigh turnover in, personnel, inadequate community\r\nparticipation and the slow pace of utilizing the funds\r\nalready solicited has proved to be an uphill struggle.\r\nOther challenges in preventing and controlling malaria\r\ninclude anomalous climatic changes that lead to\r\nepidemic conditions, the increase of water\r\ndevelopment schemes, increasing population\r\nmovements, the emergence and spread of drug-resistant\r\nstrains, the unaffordability and shortage of the new\r\nartemesinin-based combination therapies, and\r\ninadequate supplies of long-lasting insecticide-treated\r\nnets.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to emphasize that malaria\r\nwill remain one of the priority areas of intervention for\r\nthe health sector in Ethiopia. I therefore call upon the\r\ninternational community, United Nations agencies and\r\nbilateral donors to strengthen their support with a view\r\nto meeting the targets set out in the Abuja Declaration.\r\nMr. Atieh (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in\r\nArabic): Permit me at the outset to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the reports before us today.\r\nMy delegation associates itself with the statement\r\nby the Permanent Representative of Jamaica on behalf\r\nof the Group of 77 and China.\r\nThe Syrian Arab Republic believes that the\r\nefforts to achieve development in the South will be\r\ncomplete only if priority is accorded to African\r\n13\r\nA/60/PV.33\r\nconcerns. My delegation has always supported the\r\nspecial needs of Africa, including its full support for\r\nthe implementation of the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD), which was adopted by African\r\nleaders four years ago.\r\nSyria welcomes the recent progress in the\r\nimplementation of NEPAD and hopes that the\r\nmechanisms established within its framework will lead\r\nto concrete successes in the coming years. We agree\r\nwith the report of the Secretary-General’s Advisory\r\nPanel on International Support for the New Partnership\r\nfor Africa’s Development (A/60/85), which states that\r\nsuch success will require international support. That\r\nwill involve increasing official development assistance,\r\nproviding debt relief and making maximum use of the\r\ntrade sector. The report also highlights the importance\r\nof exploiting African capacities in various sectors. That\r\nwill depend to a great extent on the international\r\ncommunity’s cooperation with African countries in the\r\nareas of technology transfer and capacity-building.\r\nSupporting NEPAD is the best way to improve\r\nthe efficiency of assistance to Africa, to support\r\nAfrican priorities and to improve the capacity of\r\nGovernments to establish links, between sustainable\r\ndevelopment and anti-poverty strategies that meet the\r\nneeds of African States.\r\nDespite the importance of the decision of the\r\nGroup of Eight to cancel the debts of many of the\r\npoorest countries, we wish to reaffirm that there should\r\nalso be a serious solution for medium-income\r\ndeveloping countries and debt cancellation for the least\r\ndeveloped countries, many of which are on the African\r\ncontinent.\r\nSince development and peace are closely\r\ninterrelated, Syria supports all efforts to end the\r\nconflicts in Africa. Through its Security Council\r\nmembership in 2002 and 2003, Syria mobilized the\r\ninternational community’s efforts to promote peace in\r\nAfrica and sincerely addressed the issues then before\r\nthe Council, taking into account the rights and interests\r\nof African people. We also participated actively in a\r\nnumber of Security Council missions to areas where\r\nconflict might resume, which made recommendations\r\naimed at achieving stability in Africa.\r\nIn that respect, we wish to reaffirm the\r\nimportance of continuing the international efforts to\r\nend conflict and promote lasting peace and stability in\r\nAfrica and of supporting the positive developments\r\nreferred to in the report of the Secretary-General. We\r\nalso wish to commend the African Union for its efforts\r\nand its leading peacekeeping activities on the\r\ncontinent. We support the position of the Group of\r\nAfrican States concerning national ownership of\r\npeacebuilding activities in Africa.\r\nIf we are to maintain the momentum of the past\r\nfew years of according priority to the special needs of\r\nAfrica, we must all make greater efforts within the\r\nmain and subsidiary bodies of the United Nations. We\r\nmust benefit from ideas and initiatives promoting\r\nsustainable development and health, particularly those\r\nconcerning the provision of free antimalaria mosquito\r\nnets and efforts to fight HIV/AIDS and the other\r\npandemics that threaten the lives of millions of people\r\nin Africa and the world, and developing countries in\r\nparticular.\r\nMr. Christmas (Saint Kitts and Nevis): It is not\r\nonly a new partnership, but a new Africa, that we are\r\nseeing, especially when we look at the books now\r\nemanating from Africa. I would like to highlight in\r\nparticular the book by the South African President,\r\nThabo Mbeki, Africa: Define Yourself, which tells of\r\nthe new Africa we are seeing today.\r\nBefore I discuss the external partnership linking\r\nAfrica with other countries, I would like to focus on an\r\ninternal partnership for Africa. On the basis of our\r\nexperience in the Caribbean region, we have a common\r\nuniversity for the Anglophone Caribbean. I believe that\r\nsome time ago, an attempt was made in Africa to bring\r\ntogether the universities of Lesotho, Swaziland and\r\nBotswana. That probably fell by the wayside. We are\r\nwilling to share our experiences in this area with the\r\nemerging new Africa and with the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development.\r\nIn our region, we have a common examination\r\nsystem for all the schools in the Anglophone Caribbean\r\nunder the aegis of the University of the West Indies, so\r\nthat the examination we give in Trinidad is the same\r\none that we give in Jamaica and in Saint Kitts. We have\r\na common currency for eight of the eastern Caribbean\r\ncountries, called the Windward and the Leeward\r\nIslands. We are now attempting a common passport for\r\nthe Anglophone Caribbean and have a common cricket\r\nteam.\r\nWe are willing to share all these assets — and I\r\nam not saying that Africa can follow them — as well\r\nas our experience along these lines, with the emerging\r\n14\r\nA/60/PV.33\r\nAfrica. I think that once a country is well cemented\r\nwithin itself, and has the appropriate partnerships\r\nwithin the continent, then it can move with confidence\r\ninto partnership with other countries.\r\nThe President: In accordance with General\r\nAssembly resolution 49/2 of 19 October 1994, I call on\r\nthe Observer of the International Federation of Red\r\nCross and Red Crescent Societies.\r\nMr. Gospodinov (International Federation of Red\r\nCross and Red Crescent Societies): Allow me to start\r\non a personal note. Every time I meet a colleague from\r\nAfrica in the United Nations building, I see a silent\r\nquestion in his eyes that ask “Are you doing the best\r\nyou can for our continent?” I must confess that for us\r\nat the International Federation of Red Cross and Red\r\nCrescent Societies (IFRC) it is not an easy question to\r\nanswer. I am sure that many colleagues in this room\r\nshare the same feeling that, despite some recent\r\nprogress, we could — and should — do more for\r\nAfrica.\r\nThis is more easily said than done. In a year such\r\nas this, when over the last 10 months alone hundreds of\r\nthousands of people have been killed and tens of\r\nmillions affected by the tsunami tragedy, hurricanes\r\nKatrina, Rita and Stan, and now the horrific scenes in\r\nthe aftermath of the earthquake in Pakistan and India,\r\none may lose sight of Africa. It may no longer be a\r\ndaily front-page story.\r\nYet for us Africa remains a priority. Thirty per\r\ncent of our Global Appeal for 2005 is for Africa. Of\r\nthe 60 million Swiss francs sought, 88 per cent is\r\ndirected to health care and disaster management and to\r\nbuilding the capacity of our local member Red Cross\r\nand Red Crescent Societies in Africa. Last year, during\r\nthe Sixth Pan-African Conference held in Algiers, the\r\nRed Cross and Red Crescent movement identified four\r\nmajor goals: scaling up the HIV/AIDS response; the\r\nAfrican Red Cross/Red Crescent Health Initiative\r\n2010, known as ARCHI 2010 addressing food security;\r\nand building local capacity. These are at the centre of a\r\nlarge part of our debate today, as was thoroughly\r\nanalysed in the reports of the Secretary-General, which\r\nwe appreciate. We are also encouraged by the latest\r\ninitiatives of the Group of Eight, the European Union\r\nand, especially, the Government of the United\r\nKingdom, for searching for and finding new ways to\r\nbetter assist the African continent.\r\nWe are pleased to see that the creation of a\r\nculture of prevention and the improvement of\r\ncommunity health as preconditions for sustainable\r\ndevelopment are important, essential parts of United\r\nNations future strategy. We fully support that approach.\r\nYet, we believe that Africa must drive its own\r\ndevelopment and that the commitment of countries in\r\nneed is essential to our common search for success in\r\nthat continent. In this context, we believe that the\r\ncommunities themselves, the most vulnerable in\r\nAfrica, must be included in the development platforms\r\nof their countries, especially in the fields of public\r\nhealth and disaster preparedness.\r\nLooking back on our collective commitment\r\nundertaken at Ouagadougou in 1999, we are pleased to\r\ninform the General Assembly that, over the past five\r\nyears, we have been able to significantly decrease\r\nmeasles-related child mortality in Africa as a result of\r\nthe Measles Partnership; that the Abuja Roll Back\r\nMalaria target for long-lasting insecticide nets\r\ncoverage for Togo was accomplished in one week,\r\nwhen 805,000 nets were distributed to people in need;\r\nand that the number of polio-endemic countries is\r\nsteadily decreasing, with possible polio eradication, we\r\nhope, by 2008.\r\nLearning from the polio and measles\r\npartnerships, Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies\r\nfrom Ghana, Zambia, Togo and Niger — with funding\r\nfrom the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and\r\nMalaria and from the Canadian Government — are\r\npreparing to distribute 2.26 million mosquito nets in\r\nNiger in December. This will secure the protection of\r\nevery child under the age of five in Niger — a total of\r\n3.5 million children. Maybe this is a modest figure, but\r\nit is yet another example of our excellent partnership\r\nwith our friends from the United Nations family,\r\nespecially the World Health Organization and UNICEF.\r\nA joint polio and measles appeal brought capacity\r\nand results. During the last five years, more than 30 of\r\nour Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in Africa\r\nprovided social mobilization support to polio National\r\nImmunization Days, with approximately 1 million\r\nSwiss francs annually per each National Society. The\r\nsame appeal enabled more than 35 of our African\r\nmember societies to support measles campaigns in\r\ntheir countries and to participate in the Africa Measles\r\nInitiative partnership.\r\n15\r\nA/60/PV.33\r\nMore effort, as well as human and financial\r\nresources, are being invested in the fight against\r\nHIV/AIDS. Anti-stigma campaigns, peer education,\r\nhome-based care and partnerships with the people\r\nliving with HIV/AIDS are only part of the job being\r\ndone by our staff members and our volunteers.\r\nHowever, we know that much more is needed\r\nfrom all of us. This battle is far from over. We are\r\nconcerned that humanitarian emergencies linked to\r\nnatural and man-made disasters, such as food\r\ninsecurity, population movement and cholera, continue\r\nto destabilize West and Central Africa. Both political\r\nwill and the resources to deal with these emergencies\r\nare not yet present.\r\nNo matter how many tons of medicine and\r\nmosquito nets we distribute, we know it will not be\r\nenough unless we invest in people and local capacity.\r\nThis is one of the reasons why we are expanding our\r\nvolunteer networks, as they are part of the local\r\ncommunities. Developing regional response teams is\r\npart of the same logic, and this will lead to integrating\r\nlocal staff and volunteers into international response\r\nteams. Both volunteers and the most vulnerable people\r\nare involved as partners in planning, implementing and\r\nevaluating prevention, emergency and health activities.\r\nThe sick and starving sometimes know best what kind\r\nof help they need.\r\nOur global long-term partnerships in\r\nwater/sanitation have resulted in 2.5 million\r\nbeneficiaries. By 2015, we plan to reach five million\r\npeople. More than six million people have benefited\r\nfrom emergency assistance during the past 10 years. A\r\nbig part of that job was done by our volunteers.\r\nWe also see this process as more than just feeding\r\nthe hungry and curing the sick. Investing in the people\r\nof Africa is another step towards eradicating poverty\r\nand building peace and stability. As part of these\r\nefforts, the IFRC Secretary-General, together with\r\nsenior officials from 12 National Red Cross and Red\r\nCrescent Societies, are now working in the field with\r\nour Sudanese Red Crescent colleagues, trying to find\r\nsolutions to some of the most urgent humanitarian\r\nchallenges in the Sudan.\r\nWe know well that no matter how big our\r\nnetwork may be, we cannot help Africa without\r\nworking together with our partners, be they\r\nGovernment institutions or the United Nations. We\r\ntherefore reached an agreement in March of this year\r\nwith Médecins sans Frontières Belgium and the World\r\nFood Programme to jointly assist people living with\r\nHIV/AIDS in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\r\nincluding people receiving antiretroviral treatment.\r\nSimilar cooperation formulas are to be applied between\r\nthe IFRC and eight major United Nations agencies\r\nworking in Southern Africa.\r\nTo conclude, Mr. President, let me mention some\r\nspecific challenges we face. Very often, it is\r\nincreasingly difficult to recruit qualified technical\r\nexperts to deploy during emergencies in the continent,\r\nespecially French-speaking experts. With the\r\ndramatically increased number of natural disasters in\r\nSouth Asia, the Caribbean and Central America, as\r\nwell as the United States Gulf Coast, many of our best\r\nexperts are being drawn away from Africa. It is no\r\nsecret that, despite broad agreement that Africa must\r\nremain a focus and a priority, both human and financial\r\nresources go elsewhere. There were no tsunamis or\r\nearthquakes in West and Central Africa, thank God, but\r\nthe number of people suffering there is no less\r\nimpressive or unpleasantly disturbing.\r\nThat brings me back to where I started: the silent\r\nquestion in the eyes of our African colleagues. Are we\r\ndoing the best we can for the continent? Despite some\r\nimprovements, the answer remains mixed.\r\nThere is an old African saying, that a boy\r\nbecomes a man after he kills a lion. Translating that\r\ninto today’s African reality, it seems that we all have a\r\nlot of lions to deal with before maturity is reached and\r\nthe future of Africa is secured.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nthe debate on the items before the Assembly. We have\r\nheard a total of 43 speakers in that debate. It is of\r\ncourse impossible to summarize the rich and\r\ncomprehensive discussion we have had. However,\r\nallow me to list some key points that I think have\r\nemerged from this important debate.\r\nFirst, with regard to malaria, speakers strongly\r\nwelcomed the real progress that has been made\r\nrecently. But there was also equally strong recognition\r\nthat stepped-up action is needed to prevent the\r\nunnecessary deaths of so many people, particularly\r\nchildren in Africa.\r\nSecondly, there has been recognition that the\r\nscourge of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and other\r\ncommunicable disease threatens to reverse the gains\r\nbeing made in development. Stronger public health\r\nsystems are needed for prevention, treatment, care and\r\n16\r\nA/60/PV.33\r\nresearch, as well as for the resources necessary to do\r\nall that.\r\nThirdly, it was widely recognized that the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development has changed the\r\nnature of discussions on development. There is now a\r\nspirit of genuine partnership and African ownership.\r\nFor example, the African Peer Review Mechanism was\r\nfrequently cited as an illustration of the way things are\r\nchanging in that regard.\r\nFourthly, I want in particular to commend African\r\nprogress in the areas of peace and security, which was\r\nnoted by many speakers — for instance, the African\r\nUnion’s Peace and Security Council and progress\r\ntowards an early-warning system and an African\r\nstandby force. We welcome the African Union’s goal\r\nof a conflict-free Africa by 2010. The Assembly will\r\nrecall that the figures pertaining to conflict were rather\r\nhigh in 1998, but have now gone from, I think, 14 to 3.\r\nI think that is also an interesting aspect of how we can\r\nlive up to Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United\r\nNations. Let us remember that regional organizations\r\nand arrangements are part of the Charter. I believe that\r\nis an illustration of what this means in practice.\r\nFifthly, there was a broad call for the rapid\r\nestablishment of the Peacebuilding Commission, on\r\nwhich very important consultations and negotiations\r\nare taking place. But there has also been a strong\r\nmessage from this Hall about the importance of\r\nestablishing the Commission quickly.\r\nThere has been a welcome increase in interest in\r\nAfrica’s priorities, especially the Comprehensive\r\nAfrican Agriculture Development Programme and the\r\nnew international consortium on infrastructure.\r\nThe recent commitments on official development\r\nassistance (ODA) were widely welcomed, including\r\nthe commitment to double ODA to Africa and the\r\ncommitments by many donors to reach the target of 0.7\r\nper cent in ODA. Speakers welcomed the progress\r\nmade earlier this year at Paris on the effectiveness of\r\naid and increased flows of donor funding as budget\r\nsupport. There were calls for further work to ensure\r\nthat the donor system, including the United Nations\r\nsystem, is well coordinated.\r\nIn addition, speakers welcomed African\r\ncommitments on governance, anti-corruption measures\r\nand the creation of a good climate for investment.\r\nBut there was strong emphasis on the need to\r\nkeep up momentum and preserve the sense of urgency\r\nin our work, as well as on the need to monitor\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals,\r\nthe outcome document of the High-level Plenary\r\nMeeting and the particular commitments made to\r\nAfrica. In that regard, I welcome the role of the new\r\nAfrican Partnership Forum.\r\nWith regard to debt, speakers welcomed the\r\nprogress made this year, in particular the G-8 debt\r\ninitiative. But there were also calls for action on the\r\nissue of debt in all heavily indebted African countries.\r\nOn trade, from the very beginning to the end of\r\nour debate there was a strong push for a breakthrough\r\nat Hong Kong.\r\nWith regard to foreign direct investment, there\r\nwas a concern that only 3 per cent of such flows are\r\ngoing to Africa. There were expressions of hope and\r\ndetermination, in some cases, to work to change that\r\nsituation.\r\nLastly, we heard many good and practical\r\nexamples of South-South cooperation as a very\r\nvaluable complement to ongoing donor support. We\r\ntherefore have national efforts, good regional efforts,\r\ngood South-South cooperation and, it is to be hoped,\r\ngood cooperation between donor and recipient\r\ncountries.\r\nAll those matters were raised during our\r\ndiscussion. There is a need to continue to monitor\r\nprogress on those issues. I am sure that the Second\r\nCommittee and the Economic and Social Council will\r\ncontinue to carry out that monitoring.\r\nI think that, coming after the summit meeting,\r\nthis debate was timely in maintaining the momentum\r\non the very important issues of development, not least\r\nthe issues relating to the African continent and to\r\nfighting the scourge of malaria and other\r\ncommunicable diseases.\r\nI thank representatives for making this debate a\r\nmeaningful one. Let us carry forth its message during\r\nour continued work. I also thank members for their\r\nparticipation.\r\nThe Assembly has thus concluded the present\r\nstage of its consideration of agenda items 66 and 47.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11.50 a.m.\r\n"
