(Sweden)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.20 a.m.\r\nAgenda items 43 and 42\r\nCulture of Peace: one day of plenary meetings to\r\nreview progress made in the implementation of the\r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action and the\r\nobservance of the Decade at its midpoint\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/60/201)\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/60/279)\r\nDraft resolutions (A/60/L.4 and A/60/L.5)\r\nGlobal Agenda for Dialogue among Civilizations\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/60/259)\r\nDraft resolution (A/60/L.6)\r\nThe President: At the world summit in mid-\r\nSeptember, our leaders reaffirmed the Declaration and\r\nProgramme of Action on a Culture of Peace, as well as\r\nthe Global Agenda for Dialogue among Civilizations\r\nand its Programme of Action, adopted by the General\r\nAssembly. They also committed themselves to taking\r\naction to promote a culture of peace and a dialogue at\r\nthe local, national, regional and international levels.\r\nThis is the background for todays debate. It is\r\nthus not only topical, but of political relevance as well,\r\nthat you, the Member States, will be called upon to\r\nprovide guidance on the follow-up to the outcome\r\ndocument in this regard. Our deliberations are based on\r\nthree reports, including one prepared by UNESCO on\r\nthe midterm global review of the International Decade\r\nfor a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the\r\nChildren of the World, 2001-2010 (see A/60/279).\r\nAccording to the Declaration on a Culture of\r\nPeace, adopted by the General Assembly at its fifty-\r\nthird session, in 1999, the culture of peace is a set of\r\nvalues, attitudes, modes of behaviour and ways of life\r\nthat reject violence and prevent conflict by attacking\r\ntheir root causes, solving problems through dialogue\r\nand negotiation. A culture of peace is based on respect\r\nfor human rights, democracy and tolerance, the\r\npromotion of development, education for peace, the\r\nfree flow of information and the wider participation of\r\nwomen as an integral element preventing violence and\r\nconflict. In fact, many of the day-to-day activities of\r\nthe United Nations aim to contribute to a culture of\r\npeace.\r\nThe observance of the Decade has now reached\r\nits midpoint. This is an opportunity to take stock of\r\nprogress and to provide new impetus, focus and energy\r\nfor the second half of the Decade. We need to ask\r\nourselves, what have been promising and effective\r\npractices and approaches? Have we succeeded in\r\nbringing all stakeholders on board, including all United\r\nNations agencies, funds and programmes? Have\r\nGovernments done enough over the past five years to\r\nfoster peace and non-violence at all levels? What more\r\ncan be done to encourage civil society and the private\r\n2\r\nA/60/PV.35\r\nsector to increase their role in support of a culture of\r\npeace that must be rooted in the minds and hearts of\r\npeople, and especially those of young people?\r\nOur concrete task ahead is to ensure that we\r\ncontinue to find the most effective ways to\r\noperationalize efforts to strengthen a culture of peace.\r\nParticular emphasis should not only be placed on the\r\nmechanism of collaboration, but also on the\r\nsubstantive areas of engagements, not least education; I\r\nemphasize, not least education.\r\nIn addition, we must define more effective ways\r\nto work with civil society and non-governmental\r\norganizations, the media and the private sector, in order\r\nto ensure strong and coherent action throughout the\r\nDecade. There are also new aspects that had not\r\nentered the international debate at the time the General\r\nAssembly adopted the Declaration and Plan of Action.\r\nOne of those aspects pertains to cultural diversity. In\r\nthe summit outcome document, our leaders\r\nacknowledged the diversity of the world and\r\nrecognized that all cultures and civilizations contribute\r\nto the enrichment of humankind. They also\r\nacknowledged the importance of respect for religious\r\nand cultural diversity throughout the world. Religious\r\ndialogue is being increasingly recognized for its\r\ncontribution, not only to the objectives of the culture of\r\npeace, but also to the dialogue among civilizations,\r\ncultures and peoples.\r\nThis leads me to the other matter on the agenda\r\nfor todays plenary meeting, the Global Agenda for\r\nDialogue among Civilizations. The report of the\r\nSecretary-General reveals an emerging consensus on an\r\noverarching framework for effective dialogue-related\r\nactivities. The framework consists of universally\r\nshared values, cutting across all cultures and\r\ncivilizations, especially tolerance, mutual\r\nunderstanding and observance of human rights and\r\ndemocratic governance.\r\nThe major challenge for us all is to translate\r\npledges to adhere to these values into concrete action\r\nthrough a variety of practical initiatives, as called for\r\nin the Programme of Action for the Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations. Here I would like to welcome the\r\ninitiative by the Secretary-General to launch the\r\nAlliance of Civilizations on 14 July 2005, as proposed\r\nby the prime ministers of Spain and Turkey. This\r\naction aims to address the need for a concerted effort\r\nby the international community at both the institutional\r\nand civil society levels to bridge divides and overcome\r\nthe prejudice, misperceptions and polarization that\r\nundermine trust and potentially threaten international\r\nsecurity. We live in a world of much distrust and\r\nsuspicion. We must mobilize the political will to\r\nchange negative trends, in order to prevent polarization\r\nand pessimism. Strengthening a culture of peace,\r\nfostering interreligious dialogue and continuing the\r\nDialogue among Civilizations will contribute to\r\nenhancing hope and belief in the future.\r\nI should like to add that there is also a clear\r\nrelationship between this work and our continuing\r\nUnited Nations reform process. The fact that we are\r\ndiscussing these three concepts together today in a\r\nplenary meeting of the General Assembly is an\r\napproach to nurture in the years to come. I hope that\r\nour discussions today will lead towards concrete and\r\nsustained action and strengthen our efforts to reach\r\na truly global culture of peace and a meaningful\r\nDialogue among Civilizations, cultures and peoples of\r\nour world.\r\nI start by giving the floor to the representative of\r\nBangladesh to introduce the draft resolution contained\r\nin document A/60/L.5.\r\nMr. Chowdhury (Bangladesh): I wish to begin,\r\nMr. President, by expressing our deep appreciation to\r\nyou for organizing this day-long celebration of the\r\nInternational Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-\r\nViolence for the Children of the World, 2001-2010.\r\nThe timing is important, because it coincides with the\r\nmidpoint of the Decade, as you have yourself just\r\nobserved in your opening statement.\r\nI am sure the deliberations today, under your able\r\nstewardship, Sir, will further strengthen our resolve to\r\npromote a culture of peace, one that brings peoples\r\ncloser across cultures, civilizations and faiths and that,\r\nwe hope, will create a world order where amity\r\nsupplants atrocity, harmony overcomes hatred and\r\nunderstanding replaces intolerance.\r\nWe thank the Secretary-General for his report\r\n(A/60/201). Appreciation is also owed to the Director-\r\nGeneral of UNESCO for his continued and relentless\r\nefforts in this regard.\r\nRecent history has witnessed a series of triumphs\r\nthat humanity can justly take pride in. These have\r\ninvolved the ending of colonialism, the limiting of\r\nautocracy, the strengthening of democratic values and\r\n3\r\nA/60/PV.35\r\ninstitutions, the rise of liberalism and enhanced\r\npartnership between Governments and civil society in\r\ndevelopment.\r\nSadly, however, the period has not been without\r\nits share of tragedies. We have experienced\r\nunspeakable violence wreaked by war, terror and\r\nconflict, bringing death, destruction and suffering to\r\nmillions.\r\nThe adoption of the Millennium Declaration\r\nprovided us a unique opportunity to reinvigorate our\r\nendeavours. It constituted, among other things, a bill of\r\nhuman rights shaped by certain universal beliefs that\r\nwould promote peace, development, dialogue,\r\ninclusion, equity, justice and tolerance. Our leaders\r\nendorsed those at the 2005 world summit. They\r\nmandated us to advance all initiatives in that respect.\r\nOur present effort is in consonance with their\r\ndesires  indeed, with their decisions.\r\nWe believe that humanity, irrespective of an\r\nindividuals culture, civilization or faith, shares many\r\ncommon values. We should focus on those to build the\r\nconnecting bridges, to close the gaps and to fasten the\r\nlinks. It would be in our collective interest to devote\r\nour resources and capacities, intellectual and material,\r\nin favour of that campaign.\r\nBangladesh has been at the forefront of initiatives\r\nthat promote greater understanding and tolerance\r\namong peoples. In our belief, that is achievable\r\nthrough dialogue and cooperation. My country was\r\nborn of a bloody conflict. We therefore see great value\r\nin principles of tolerance, respect for diversity,\r\ndemocracy and understanding. Those ideals were\r\nendorsed by the membership in 1999 in the Declaration\r\nand Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace\r\n(resolution 53/243). Bangladesh was privileged to steer\r\nthat process.\r\nThe Programme of Action identifies major areas\r\nof focus: education; sustainable economic and social\r\ndevelopment; human rights; equality between men and\r\nwomen; democratic participation; advancing\r\nunderstanding, tolerance and solidarity; participatory\r\ncommunication and free flow of information and\r\nknowledge; and international peace and security.\r\nSpecific actions are set out in each area that would help\r\nbring our goals to fruition.\r\nIn a spirit of inclusiveness, Bangladesh has\r\nalways welcomed all initiatives that seek to promote\r\nsuch dialogue and understanding. We believe that all of\r\nthese initiatives are mutually reinforcing. We also\r\nbelieve that the participation of all actors \r\nGovernments, international organizations, civil society,\r\nnon-governmental organizations, young people, the\r\nprivate sector, community leaders, religious leaders,\r\nteachers, artists, journalists and humanitarian\r\nworkers  is essential to realize our universal goal of\r\na peaceful world, a world where we will be able to\r\nsolve our problems through convergence of ideas rather\r\nthan through confrontation.\r\nWhile we promote a culture of peace and all such\r\ninitiatives, we do not pretend that those objectives can\r\nbe achieved in a vacuum. To make peace sustainable, it\r\nis imperative to create the right conditions for our\r\npeoples to live in dignity and in freedom from want\r\nand fear. All prevailing political, economic and socio-\r\ncultural injustices must also be addressed.\r\nBangladesh has always sought to play an\r\nimportant role in the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. Our commitment to United Nations\r\npeacekeeping remains unflinching. Bangladesh has\r\ncontributed some 39,000 peacekeepers so far, to 24\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations. More than 70\r\nsoldiers have made the supreme sacrifice in the line of\r\nduty, to uphold United Nations values.\r\nAt home, on the domestic matrix, Bangladesh has\r\nbeen undergoing a quiet revolution. This is in the field\r\nof socio-economic development, maintaining growth in\r\ngross domestic product of over 5 per cent over two\r\ndecades, raising per capita income, maintaining food\r\nsecurity, increasing resilience to meet natural disasters,\r\nimproving the human development index, enhancing\r\ngender parity and improving social and health\r\nindicators. We have pressed our indigenous intellectual\r\nresources to the service of development. Ideas such as\r\nmicrocredit and non-formal education  whose time\r\nhas surely come  have been replicated widely. We\r\nbelieve that a world order that is informed by a culture\r\nof peace is conducive to the attainment of our\r\ndevelopment goals, including the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). A strengthened global\r\npartnership is, therefore, the call of the hour.\r\nAt this midpoint of the Decade, we wish to\r\nexpress our gratitude to all actors that have contributed\r\nto the promotion of such a culture. We applaud in this\r\nconnection the role of UNESCO. Appreciation is also\r\n4\r\nA/60/PV.35\r\ndue to other involved organizations which lie within\r\nand outside the United Nations system.\r\nWe are particularly thankful to civil society,\r\nincluding non-governmental organizations and young\r\npeople. Their enthusiastic support to this cause has\r\nmade a huge difference. Our special thanks go to the\r\nFundación Cultura de Paz for its commendable work in\r\ncompiling a report on the progress achieved by over\r\n700 organizations from more than 100 countries,\r\nincluding my own. We urge all of them to continue\r\ntheir good work.\r\nWe believe that the promotion of a culture of\r\npeace is of paramount importance. This is more so\r\ntoday, when conflicts bred of misunderstanding and\r\nintolerance dot our globe. It is in this perspective that I\r\nhave the honour to introduce, on behalf of a large\r\nnumber of delegations  actually 105 sponsors  the\r\ndraft resolution entitled International decade for a\r\nCulture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of\r\nthe World, 2001-2010, contained in document\r\nA/60/L.5. Additional sponsors continue to come\r\nforward. For instance, Brunei Darussalam and Marshall\r\nIslands have now joined us.\r\nThe draft resolution contains some technical\r\nupdates vis-à-vis the resolution of the previous year\r\n(resolution 59/143). It contains the following\r\nadditional elements: First, it takes note of the 2005\r\nworld summit outcome document adopted at the High-\r\nlevel Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly\r\n(resolution 60/1). Secondly, it commends civil society,\r\nincluding non-governmental organizations and young\r\npeople, for their activities in further promoting a\r\nculture of peace and non-violence, including through\r\ntheir campaign to raise awareness on a culture of\r\npeace. Here it takes note of the progress achieved by\r\nmore than 700 organizations in more than 100\r\ncountries. And thirdly, it requests the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, as agreed in the 2005 world summit outcome\r\ndocument, to explore enhancing mechanisms for the\r\nimplementation of the Declaration and Programme of\r\nAction on a Culture of Peace.\r\nThis draft resolution bears the enthusiastic seal of\r\nover 106 nations. They constitute an overwhelming\r\nmajority in this House. They represent not just the\r\nvoice  that too  but the aspirations of teeming\r\nbillions. Some day  and this is more than a fond wish\r\nand is indeed a strong belief  a draft resolution on\r\nthis item will carry the sponsorship of each and every\r\ndelegation.\r\nThat is also our hope, for hope is what sustains us\r\nin adversity, stimulates our belief in life and\r\nencourages us to forge ahead. Also, this is not too tall\r\nan order. For has it not been aptly said that mans reach\r\nshould exceed his grasp, for what else are the heavens\r\nfor?\r\nI hope that the Assembly will adopt the draft\r\nresolution without a vote.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of the Islamic Republic of Iran to\r\nintroduce draft resolution A/60/L.6.\r\nMr. Zarif (Islamic Republic of Iran): Allow me\r\nto commence by expressing our satisfaction that the\r\nGeneral Assembly is addressing, in a joint debate, two\r\nvery important items concerning the culture of peace\r\nand the Global Agenda for Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations. I wish to thank the Secretary-General for\r\nhis reports (A/60/201, A/60/259) and for his\r\nunwavering commitment to the advancement of those\r\nlofty initiatives.\r\nThe international community has never been in\r\nmore dire and urgent need of a concerted effort to\r\npromote a culture of peace and dialogue among\r\ncivilizations than it is today. Their significance was\r\nrightly recognized in the outcome document\r\n(resolution 60/1) of the recently concluded summit,\r\nwhich reaffirmed the Declaration and Programme of\r\nAction on a Culture of Peace and the Global Agenda\r\nfor Dialogue among Civilizations and its Programme of\r\nAction, as well as other initiatives on dialogue among\r\ncultures and civilizations.\r\nThe challenges that we all face are indeed\r\nmultifaceted, and the old approaches based on power\r\nand exclusion have proved to be insufficient and, in\r\nmost cases, inappropriate. Such approaches have even\r\nled to the exacerbation of tension by widening the\r\ndivide, marginalizing and alienating significant\r\nportions of the global population, and providing fertile\r\ngrounds for the spread of hatred, bigotry and violence.\r\nThe perceived need for real  or even\r\nmanufactured  enemies as a managerial tool has, in\r\nfact, transformed the nightmare of a clash of\r\ncivilizations from a theoretical construct into a real\r\npossibility.\r\n5\r\nA/60/PV.35\r\nThe desire of the international community to\r\nbreak away from the paradigm of exclusion was\r\ndemonstrated by the unanimous designation of 2001 as\r\nthe United Nations Year of Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations. A new paradigm should replace the\r\noutdated mode of analysis and behaviour, because\r\ntoday there is greater appreciation of our common\r\nvulnerability to threats ranging from terrorism and\r\nweapons of mass destruction to poverty and\r\nenvironmental degradation. Indeed, in the era of\r\nglobalization, those menaces recognize no boundaries\r\nof geography, power or affluence. And it is thus hoped\r\nthat the collective management of our common\r\nvulnerabilities is emerging as a better tool for global\r\ngovernance than perceived or imaginary enemies.\r\nA new paradigm rests on the proposition that the\r\nsources of knowledge and wisdom are inherently\r\ndiversified, that each civilization has much to offer and\r\nthat inclusion will bring with it mutual enrichment and\r\nbenefit. Resolution 56/6, on the Global Agenda for\r\nDialogue among Civilizations, adopted four years ago\r\nby the General Assembly, aptly defines the foundations\r\nof that emerging paradigm as inclusion, and a\r\ncollective desire to learn, uncover and examine\r\nassumptions, unfold shared meaning and core values\r\nand integrate multiple perspectives through dialogue\r\n(part A, article 1). That is further elaborated by the\r\nSecretary-Generals Group of Eminent Persons on\r\nDialogue among Civilizations, which noted in its\r\npublication, Crossing the Divide: Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations,\r\nDialogue brings with it equal footing ... as\r\nit is a process by which we accept, as much as we\r\nwant to be accepted. We include, as much as we\r\nwant to be included. We listen, as much as we\r\nwant to be listened to.\r\nIn these terms, dialogue can perhaps\r\neventually usher in a new paradigm of global\r\nrelations because it challenges the old\r\nparadigm. ... dialogue can be a framework where\r\nthe weakest is accorded the privilege to be\r\nlistened to, and where the strongest finds it\r\nnecessary to explain its case to others.\r\nSuch a paradigm shift would, in fact, be a\r\nrequirement for attaining the lofty objectives of larger\r\nfreedom, development, security and human rights for\r\nall, and it needs to become the prevailing discourse of\r\nthe new century if we want to leave our future\r\ngenerations with a more secure and prosperous world\r\nthan the one we inherited. Strengthening the culture of\r\ndialogue among civilizations will prove to be a most\r\nimportant element in combating the calamities of the\r\nday, in particular terrorism. For terrorism seeks to\r\nmake the diversity among nations the source of\r\nconflict, while dialogue among civilizations can help to\r\nmake that very diversity the foundation for cooperation\r\nand collective betterment.\r\nThe Global Agenda for Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations and its Programme of Action marked a\r\nmilestone in our collective effort to embark on this\r\nself-evident yet innovative approach. Since its\r\nadoption, it has progressively mobilized greater\r\ninterest by Member States, academic institutions, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and international and\r\nregional institutions.\r\nMany countries, international and regional\r\norganizations, civil society and non-governmental\r\norganizations and the United Nations system, in\r\nparticular UNESCO, have already submitted reports of\r\ntheir impressive activities in that regard to the\r\nSecretary-General. As the Secretary-General indicated\r\nin his report in document A/60/259, those submissions\r\nsuggest that the Global Agenda for Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations has provided the framework for various\r\ninnovative approaches to promoting greater\r\nunderstanding and constructive interaction among\r\npeoples of diverse cultural backgrounds.\r\nIn that context, UNESCO has substantially\r\ncontributed to the implementation of the Global\r\nAgenda by including it in its Medium-term Strategy for\r\n2002-2007 with a view to achieving its strategic\r\nobjective of safeguarding cultural diversity and\r\nencouraging dialogue among cultures and civilizations.\r\nThe General Assembly laid a solid foundation for\r\ninstitutionalizing, promoting and facilitating dialogue\r\namong civilizations through its resolution 53/22. Since\r\nthe fifty-third session, the idea has been increasingly\r\nembraced by many around the globe. The designation\r\nof 2001 as the United Nations Year of Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations and the adoption of the Global Agenda\r\nfor Dialogue among Civilizations and its Programme of\r\nAction were indeed major initiatives to enhance\r\ndialogue and understanding at the beginning of the new\r\nmillennium. Those endeavours demonstrated the\r\ncollective resolve of the international community to\r\nbegin the millennium with a fresh approach to global\r\n6\r\nA/60/PV.35\r\ninteractions and the determination to build a better\r\ntomorrow for future generations.\r\nThe time has come once again for the Assembly,\r\nas the sole universal body encompassing the\r\nrepresentatives of nearly every nation on Earth, to\r\nfurther strengthen this emerging and promising\r\nparadigm by taking another step through the adoption\r\nof the draft resolution before us. It is therefore a great\r\nhonour and privilege for me to introduce the draft\r\nresolution contained in document A/60/L.6, entitled\r\nGlobal Agenda for Dialogue among Civilizations. I\r\ndo so on behalf of the sponsors of the draft resolution,\r\nwhich, in addition to the 67 delegations mentioned in\r\nthe draft, now include Andorra, Argentina, Austria,\r\nBelarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Belgium, Brazil,\r\nBulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech\r\nRepublic, Denmark, the Dominican Republic, Estonia,\r\nGermany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, the Libyan\r\nArab Jamahiriya, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta,\r\nMonaco, Mongolia, the Netherlands, New Zealand,\r\nNiger, Norway, Panama, Poland, Peru, San Marino,\r\nSierra Leone, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sri Lanka,\r\nSweden, the Syrian Arab Republic, the former\r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Turkmenistan,\r\nTunisia and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and\r\nNorthern Ireland.\r\nThe draft resolution takes stock of the\r\nachievements already accomplished and seeks to\r\nfurther advance the concept and its global\r\nimplementation. It reiterates that dialogue among\r\ncivilizations is a process between and within\r\ncivilizations, founded on inclusion and a collective\r\ndesire to learn, uncover and examine assumptions,\r\nunfold shared meanings and core values and integrate\r\nmultiple perspectives through dialogue. It also\r\nemphasizes that the hearts and minds of the next\r\ngeneration are the real object of dialogue among\r\ncivilizations.\r\nThe draft resolution welcomes the numerous\r\ninitiatives and efforts to further promote dialogue\r\namong civilizations adopted by States, the United\r\nNations system, international and regional\r\norganizations, civil society and non-governmental\r\norganizations. It also recognizes the contribution of\r\ndifferent initiatives on dialogue among cultures and\r\ncivilizations, including the dialogue on interfaith\r\ncooperation and the initiative of the Alliance of\r\nCivilizations.\r\nThe draft resolution invites States, international\r\nand regional organizations and civil society, including\r\nnon-governmental organizations, to develop\r\nappropriate ways and means at the local, national,\r\nregional and international levels to further promote\r\ndialogue and mutual understanding among\r\ncivilizations, and to report on their activities to the\r\nSecretary-General. Finally, by this draft resolution the\r\nGeneral Assembly would request the Secretary-General\r\nto explore enhancing implementation mechanisms of\r\nthe Global Agenda for Dialogue among Civilizations\r\nand to report thereon to the General Assembly at its\r\nsixty-fifth session.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to inform\r\nmembers that following consultations, the text of the\r\neleventh preambular paragraph of the Global Agenda\r\nfor Dialogue among Civilization (resolution 56/6) has\r\nnow been added to the draft resolution following the\r\nfifth preambular paragraph, and the text of the\r\nthirteenth preambular paragraph of the Global Agenda\r\nhas been added following operative paragraph 4, with\r\nthe words Underlining the fact replaced by the words\r\nReaffirms further and the word recognizing\r\nreplaced by the word recognizes. Those paragraphs\r\nare being distributed to all delegations for ease of\r\nreference.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran and other sponsors\r\nare confident that the draft resolution contained in\r\ndocument A/60/L.6, as orally revised, will be endorsed\r\nunanimously by the General Assembly. That will be a\r\nclear affirmation by the international community of the\r\nshared commitment to advance the principles and\r\nobjectives of dialogue, as well as our resolve to ensure\r\nthat the world we will pass on to our children will be\r\none of dialogue and not of clashes, one of\r\ncommunication and not of violence.\r\nBefore concluding, I would like to thank all those\r\nwho sponsored the draft resolution and who, by\r\nproviding us with their valuable comments and\r\nviewpoints, contributed to the strength of its message.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of the Philippines to introduce draft\r\nresolution A/60/L.4.\r\nMr. Baja (Philippines): On behalf of my\r\ndelegation, allow me once again to congratulate you,\r\nSir, on your election as President of the General\r\nAssembly at this historic session. My delegation\r\n7\r\nA/60/PV.35\r\npledges its full cooperation to you and the other\r\nmembers of the General Committee.\r\nThe Philippines is gratified to note that, in the\r\n2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1), world\r\nleaders reaffirmed the Declaration and Programme of\r\nAction on a Culture of Peace (resolution 53/243) as\r\nwell as the Global Agenda for Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations (resolution 56/6) and its Programme of\r\nAction, adopted by the General Assembly, and the\r\nvalue of different initiatives on dialogue among\r\ncultures and civilizations, including the dialogue on\r\ninterfaith cooperation. They also requested the\r\nSecretary-General to explore enhancing implementation\r\nmechanisms and to follow up on those initiatives.\r\nIn order to assist efforts to explore\r\nimplementation mechanisms and to follow up on those\r\ninitiatives, the Philippines is pleased to introduce, on\r\nbehalf of the other sponsors, draft resolution A/60/L.4,\r\nentitled Promotion of interreligious dialogue and\r\ncooperation for peace. The draft resolution updates\r\nlast years resolution (59/23), incorporating new\r\nelements to reflect developments in the field since the\r\nGeneral Assemblys adoption by consensus last year of\r\nthat Philippines-initiated resolution, entitled Promotion\r\nof interreligious dialogue. In particular, several\r\nsignificant events since then have endorsed the\r\nimportance of interreligious dialogue and cooperation\r\nfor the promotion of peace. My delegation would like\r\nto mention some of them.\r\nIn December, Albania hosted the Tirana Regional\r\nSummit on Interreligious and Interethnic Dialogue in\r\nSouth-East Europe, in which 13 leaders from the\r\nregion participated and which culminated in the\r\nadoption of the Tirana Summit Declaration.\r\nIn April, a conference was held in Melbourne\r\nAustralia, on the theme Religion in peace and\r\nconflict: responding to militancy and fundamentalism.\r\nAt that conference representatives from 15 countries of\r\nSouth-East Asia and the Pacific region adopted the\r\nMelbourne Declaration.\r\nIn June, at the second South Summit of the 132\r\nmember countries of the Group of 77, held in Qatar,\r\nparticipating leaders adopted the Doha Declaration in\r\nwhich they recognized\r\nthat the respect for religious and cultural\r\ndiversity in an increasingly globalizing world\r\ncontributes to international cooperation, promotes\r\nenhanced dialogue among religions, cultures and\r\ncivilizations, and helps to create an environment\r\nconducive to exchange of human experience.\r\nForeign ministers of the Non-Aligned Movement\r\n(NAM) also met in Doha last June and adopted the\r\nNAM Ministerial Declaration, in which they\r\nexpressed the view that the promotion of a\r\nculture of peace, dialogue among civilizations\r\nand interreligious cooperation are some of the\r\nsignificant measures and approaches that could\r\ncontribute towards international peace, security\r\nand harmony.\r\nAnother significant development was the Asia-\r\nEurope Meeting (ASEM) Interfaith Dialogue held in\r\nBali, Indonesia, on 21 and 22 July 2005 on the theme\r\nBuilding interfaith harmony within the international\r\ncommunity. ASEM membership comes from the\r\nEuropean Union and South-East and North-East Asian\r\ncountries. The Bali Declaration acknowledged the\r\nimportance of interfaith dialogue and cooperation\r\namong United Nations initiatives in promoting the\r\nculture of peace, the inclusion of interfaith studies in\r\npost-elementary curricula, the education of grass-roots\r\ncommunities on pluralism and diversity and the need\r\nfor close cooperation between Government and civil\r\nsociety sectors to share best practices and promote\r\ninterfaith dialogue and cooperation.\r\nThe tripartite Conference on Interfaith\r\nCooperation for Peace was held in June at the United\r\nNations, sponsored by 16 Governments, the\r\nDepartment of Economic and Social Affairs, the United\r\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization, the World Bank and the 110-member\r\nCommittee of Religious Non-Governmental\r\nOrganizations (NGOs) at the United Nations. The\r\noutcome of that historic conference was circulated in\r\ndocument A/60/269, which I commend for transmittal\r\nby representatives to their capitals, to afford them the\r\nopportunity to consider its conclusions and\r\nrecommendations.\r\nThe ASEAN Regional Forum, the only security-\r\noriented organization in Asia, adopted a Chairmans\r\nstatement on 29 July 2005 in Vientianne. The Ministers\r\nwelcomed the enhancement of interfaith dialogues\r\naimed at promoting mutual understanding and trust\r\namong people in the region.\r\n8\r\nA/60/PV.35\r\nAt the margins of the world summit last month,\r\nan Informal Meeting of Leaders on Interfaith Dialogue\r\nand Cooperation for Peace was held at United Nations\r\nHeadquarters on 13 September 2005. The 15\r\nparticipating leaders adopted a declaration highlighting\r\nmutually inclusive and mutually reinforcing\r\ninterreligious, intercultural and inter-civilizational\r\ninitiatives, all designed to promote peace at the local,\r\nnational, regional and international levels.\r\nThat informal summit on interfaith cooperation\r\nwas followed by the Security Council summit, held on\r\n14 September 2005, chaired by the President of the\r\nPhilippines. At the summit the Council adopted its\r\nresolution 1624 (2005), which [c]alls upon all States\r\nto continue international efforts to enhance dialogue\r\nand broaden understanding among civilizations, in an\r\neffort to prevent the indiscriminate targeting of\r\ndifferent religions and cultures (para. 3).\r\nThere are equally significant initiatives at the\r\nregional and international levels, such as Pakistans\r\nenlightened moderation, endorsed by the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference; the Congress\r\nof Leaders of World and Traditional Religions, hosted\r\nby Kazakhstan; the 2006 world summit on Islamic-\r\nChristian dialogue to be held in Senegal; and, of\r\ncourse, the Alliance of Civilizations launched by the\r\nSecretary-General in July.\r\nThese developments are eloquent affirmations of\r\nthe value of draft resolution A/60/L.4, which I\r\ncommend for adoption by consensus. The draft\r\nresolution takes into account the growing universal\r\nclamour for dialogue to avert misunderstanding and\r\nconflict.\r\nThe draft resolution takes a step forward by\r\nrecognizing the mutually inclusive and mutually\r\nreinforcing linkages of the various interreligious,\r\nintercultural and inter-civilization initiatives for the\r\npromotion of peace. It also invites the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to submit a report on ways to strengthen\r\nlinkages and focus more on practical options in the\r\nimplementation of the initiatives on interreligious\r\ndialogue and cooperation for peace.\r\nWe are confident that the various interreligious,\r\nintercultural and inter-civilization initiatives will grow\r\ninto a process or mechanism for conflict prevention\r\nand for the pacific settlement of disputes, a mechanism\r\nagainst terrorism and a mechanism for peace.\r\nMr. Thomson (United Kingdom): I have the\r\nhonour to speak on behalf of the 25 countries of the\r\nEuropean Union, Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey, Croatia,\r\nAlbania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the former Yugoslav\r\nRepublic of Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro,\r\nIceland, Ukraine and Moldova align themselves with\r\nthis statement.\r\nThe European Union welcomes the opportunity\r\nprovided at the midpoint of this International Decade\r\nfor a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the\r\nChildren of the World to reaffirm the Declaration and\r\nProgramme of Action on a Culture of Peace (resolution\r\n53/243).\r\nThe European Union also expresses its full\r\nsupport for the other ongoing related activities on\r\ninterfaith and intercultural dialogue in this area, such\r\nas the Global Agenda for Dialogue among Civilizations\r\nand its Programme of Action. Further, the European\r\nUnion also welcomes the recent initiative of the\r\nAlliance of Civilizations, announced by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in July this year. The Permanent\r\nRepresentative of the Philippines, in his statement just\r\na moment ago, listed many more such initiatives. Each\r\none of these can contribute to the common platform of\r\nunity which the international community must build in\r\norder to challenge the growing forces of extremism and\r\nsectarianism, which threaten all our daily lives.\r\nWho could have imagined at the start of this\r\nInternational Decade the challenges to a culture of\r\npeace that the world is facing today? As a counter to\r\nextremism and terrorism, we must choose to celebrate\r\nthe values that unite us. In order to undermine those\r\nwho seek to sow division and chaos we must strive to\r\ndevelop tolerant and inclusive societies. We must\r\ncelebrate how diversity enriches our societies. We must\r\nimprove understanding amongst faiths and cultures,\r\nand we must foster stronger respect between\r\ncommunities.\r\nRespect, tolerance and dignity are cornerstones in\r\ncreating the conditions for a safe, secure and peaceful\r\nworld in which all can realize their full potential as\r\nhuman beings. Those principles of respect, tolerance\r\nand dignity are also intrinsic to developing a culture of\r\npeace, as outlined in article 3 of the Declaration.\r\nFull respect for all human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms, for democracy and for the rule of law, as set\r\nout in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, is\r\nessential if we are to promote and protect those values\r\n9\r\nA/60/PV.35\r\ncommon to humanity. And whilst working to promote\r\nthose aims, we must also defend against those who\r\nseek to undermine those values. We must act against\r\nthose that incite and promote extremism. It is our duty\r\nto do so.\r\nGovernments need to work with and through their\r\nhome communities. We must encourage and empower\r\nmainstream voices to challenge the extremists with a\r\nmore powerful message, one that reaffirms our values\r\nof tolerance and respect. That effort must go hand in\r\nhand with work to tackle inequality, poverty and\r\ninjustice. We must do more to improve opportunity,\r\npursue good governance and entrench universal human\r\nrights. Making a practical difference in peoples lives\r\nby promoting rights and ensuring their implementation\r\ncan only help to support our pursuit of tolerance and\r\npeace.\r\nEducation has a critical role to play in this regard.\r\nGood-quality education provides a foundation for\r\ngenuine dialogue among peoples. As the outcome\r\ndocument of the twenty-seventh special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly entitled, A world fit for children,\r\nreminds us, children are resourceful citizens capable\r\nof helping to build a better future for all (resolution\r\nS-27/2, annex, para. 7).\r\nThe European Union is committed to empowering\r\nchildren and young people to express themselves. In\r\nthat regard, we reaffirm our commitment to the World\r\nProgramme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and\r\nBeyond (resolution 50/81, annex) and its five new\r\npriority areas. Across the European Union, there are an\r\nincreasing number of youth programmes aimed at\r\ndeveloping cooperation on a wide range of activities\r\nbetween young people in different member States and\r\nbeyond. Bringing together young people from different\r\nbackgrounds and from different countries helps combat\r\nnegative prejudices and stereotypes. Young people are\r\nkey to creating the tolerant society in which we all\r\nwant to live. Young people must be considered part of\r\nthe solution.\r\nThe European Union pays particular tribute to the\r\nUnited Network of Young Peacebuilders, a global\r\nnetwork of young people and youth organizations\r\nactive in the field of peacebuilding. Their work is an\r\nexample to us all and evidence of the significant role\r\nthat civil society can play in advancing a culture of\r\npeace. In that regard, the European Union welcomes\r\nthe World Report on the Culture of Peace prepared by\r\nover 700 civil society organizations. It is an important\r\ncontribution to assessing the review of progress made\r\nin the last five years.\r\nFinally, the European Union pays tribute to the\r\nwork of UNESCO as lead agency for the Programme of\r\nAction on a Culture of Peace. UNESCOs commitment\r\nto fostering a culture of peace in its fields of\r\ncompetence is as relevant now as ever, and we urge\r\nUNESCO to pursue greater synergy across the United\r\nNations system in order to achieve visible results.\r\nThe European Union also pays particular tribute\r\nto UNESCOs work in elaborating the draft Convention\r\non the Protection of the Diversity of Cultural Contents\r\nand Artistic Expressions. We welcome the adoption of\r\nthat international Convention at the 33rd session of the\r\nUNESCO General Conference. We urge Member States\r\nto ratify it as early as possible.\r\nMr. Kitaoka (Japan): Sixty years have passed\r\nsince the United Nations was established, with  as it\r\nis expressed in the Preamble of the Charter  the\r\ndetermination to practice tolerance and live together\r\nin peace with one another as good neighbours. And\r\nfour years have now passed since the General\r\nAssembly adopted resolution 56/6, entitled Global\r\nAgenda for Dialogue among Civilizations, making the\r\nyear 2001 the year of dialogue among civilizations.\r\nToday, however, there are still problems that\r\ncause people everywhere great concern. Conflict and\r\nconfrontation arising from racial or religious\r\ndifferences persist around the world. Globalization,\r\nwhich can bring different civilizations closer,\r\ncontributes many benefits to society but can also give\r\nrise to intolerance among people when they come into\r\ncontact with civilizations different from their own,\r\nwithout preparation. In order to deal with that\r\nunfortunate situation, it is of great importance to\r\npromote dialogue among peoples and civilizations,\r\nbased on a spirit of tolerance and mutual\r\nunderstanding.\r\nAt the 2005 world summit in September, leaders\r\nreaffirmed that all cultures and civilizations have\r\ncontributed to the advancement of humankind. They\r\nacknowledged the importance of respect and\r\nunderstanding for religious and cultural diversity\r\nthroughout the world and committed themselves to\r\npromoting a culture of peace and dialogue at the local,\r\nregional and international levels. It is our responsibility\r\nto achieve that goal. Japan, for its part, believes that\r\n10\r\nA/60/PV.35\r\nthe Global Agenda for Dialogue among Civilizations\r\nhas played a key role in the promotion of\r\nunderstanding among peoples and cultures around the\r\nworld and has thus contributed to the further\r\ndevelopment of a culture of peace.\r\nIn that regard, my delegation highly commends\r\nUNESCO for the major role it played in implementing\r\nthe Global Agenda for Dialogue among Civilizations.\r\nUNESCO included the Global Agenda in its medium-\r\nterm strategy for 2002-2007, with a view to achieving\r\nits strategic objective of safeguarding cultural diversity\r\nand encouraging dialogue among cultures and\r\ncivilizations. Within that framework, UNESCO has\r\norganized and sponsored a broad range of activities,\r\nconferences and meetings, such as the April 2005\r\nInternational Conference on the Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations, Cultures and Peoples in Paris, as well as\r\nregional symposiums and conferences on the dialogue\r\namong civilizations.\r\nIn that context, I welcome the adoption of the\r\nConvention on the Protection of the Diversity of\r\nCultural Contents and Artistic Expressions on\r\n17 October by Commission IV of the 33rd UNESCO\r\nGeneral Conference. We believe the Convention will\r\nprotect and promote cultural diversity by providing a\r\nfar-reaching framework. I believe that respect for\r\ncultural diversity and intercultural dialogue is one of\r\nthe surest guarantees of development and peace.\r\nJapan believes that, as affirmed by the report of\r\nthe Secretary-General on the Global Agenda for\r\nDialogue among Civilizations (A/60/259), of August\r\n2005, a global partnership is urgently needed and that\r\nconcrete action should be taken through practical\r\ninitiatives to further promote dialogue among\r\ncivilizations. Aside from the activities of UNESCO,\r\nJapan also welcomes the various initiatives promoted\r\nby Member States to implement the Global Agenda for\r\nDialogue among Civilizations. It welcomes, among\r\nother initiatives, the Alliance of Civilizations launched\r\non 14 July 2005 by the Secretary-General.\r\nThroughout its history, my country has been\r\nfortunate enough to be exposed to  and has\r\naccepted  various civilizations, such as those from\r\nChina and India and, in modern times, Western\r\ncivilization. Japan has been successful in coexisting\r\nwith different cultures while maintaining its own\r\nidentity. Japan, recognizing the great benefits of\r\ncultural diversity, attaches importance to interaction\r\namong people and acknowledges the importance of\r\nunderstanding each others culture and civilization and\r\nof fostering mutual understanding through dialogue.\r\nWith that in mind, Japan attaches special\r\nimportance to exchanges among young people, who\r\nwill have leading roles in the international community\r\nin the new era. Through youth invitation schemes, such\r\nas the Global Youth Exchange Programme, Japan\r\nintends to make further efforts in promoting mutual\r\nunderstanding to transcend the differences in cultures\r\nand languages.\r\nIn January 2001, in response to the proclamation\r\nof the United Nations Year of Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations, Japan launched a new initiative seeking\r\nto further enhance mutual understanding between\r\nJapan and Islamic countries, as part of the effort to\r\npromote dialogue among civilizations. Since then,\r\nJapan has actively undertaken a series of efforts to\r\ndeepen understanding among cultures and civilizations\r\nthrough dialogues such as the Japan-Middle East\r\nCultural Exchanges and Dialogue Mission, the Arab-\r\nJapan Dialogue Forum and seminars on the dialogue\r\namong civilizations between the Islamic world and\r\nJapan.\r\nBased on the experience accumulated through\r\nthose culture- and region-specific dialogues, Japan\r\ndecided to organize a conference with a much broader\r\nperspective. At the Asian-African Summit in April\r\n2005, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi stated that it\r\nwas critical to share our experiences and our\r\nknowledge through dialogues between civilizations,\r\ncultures and individuals. To that end, he offered to host\r\nthe World Civilization Forum so that all countries\r\nmight share their experiences and preserve their\r\ntraditions, while, at the same time, advancing their own\r\nmodernization.\r\nAt that Forum, held in July 2005 in Tokyo,\r\nProfessor Amartya Sen, the Forums chairman, pointed\r\nout, in his opening address at the Forum, that\r\ndistinctions solely based on civilizations made little\r\nsense, because we are defined by a variety of concerns\r\nand thus cannot be reduced to a single set of features.\r\nInstead, we must see the richness of the human\r\ncondition. He argued that, in that sense, the Forum was\r\nnot about a dialogue among civilizations, but about a\r\nglobal dialogue among people striving to address the\r\nproblems and the grievances of the world. The Forum\r\nprovided an opportunity for Governments, private\r\n11\r\nA/60/PV.35\r\nenterprise, academia and civil society to share a\r\ncommon awareness of the issues and to form networks\r\nto promote interaction in serious discussions on todays\r\nsituation. Japan acknowledges the absolute virtue of\r\ndialogue and peace and, accordingly, would like to\r\ncontinue its efforts to promote them.\r\nIn the years to come, we will have to continue our\r\nlabours, in close cooperation with each other, to\r\nexpand dialogue and exchange views among\r\ncivilizations. I would therefore like to conclude my\r\nstatement by reiterating that Japan is determined to\r\nredouble its efforts to bring about a culture of peace.\r\nMr. Elbadri (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): A number\r\nof international events have stressed the importance of\r\nthe culture of peace, which consists of the thought, the\r\nvalues, the codes of conduct that are based on respect\r\nfor peace and human rights and other fundamental\r\nvalues that we have adopted as a way of life. The\r\nculture of peace is no longer a political luxury; it has\r\nbecome a political necessity. It is necessary for\r\nsecurity, as well as being a human responsibility. That\r\nis the true essence of the concept of collective security,\r\nwhich must begin with us, as individuals and\r\nrepresentative of our peoples and Governments.\r\nWe must respect the lofty human values reflected\r\nin the international legal frameworks that we have\r\ncreated to govern international relations. They must be\r\nbased on equality and common standards that can\r\nprovide real security for all peoples and all countries.\r\nPeace can be built on the basis of a balance between\r\nrights and obligations.\r\nThere can be no peace without communication\r\namong religions, cultures and civilizations and without\r\nrespect on the part of peoples and Governments for the\r\ncultures and the fundamental rights of others. We must\r\nrealize that we live in a world that has a civilizational\r\ncontinuum  a world in which our differences are a\r\nkey element of our diversity. We have one human\r\nheritage, but culturally, civilizationally and\r\nintellectually we are very diverse.\r\nDespite the various contributions to the human\r\nheritage made by a number of civilizations, we must\r\ntake into account in particular the contributions made\r\nby the Islamic civilization. In recent years, there have\r\nbeen many initiatives in that respect, and there are\r\nprominent indications that global awareness is\r\ngrowing, as evidenced by the adoption of the 2001\r\nGlobal Agenda for Dialogue among Civilizations\r\ncontained in General Assembly resolution 56/6, as well\r\nas the Secretary-Generals declaration of the Alliance\r\nof Civilizations last July.\r\nIf we approach such initiatives in a sincere\r\nmanner, we will all be able to benefit from the dialogue\r\namong civilizations and cultures within an effective\r\ninstitutional international framework, based on clarity\r\nof vision, objectives and means.\r\nWe believe profoundly in the importance of\r\ndialogue among cultures and civilizations with a view\r\nto strengthening world peace and building bridges\r\nbetween peoples. However, such dialogue must be\r\nbased on a number of basic elements and pillars,\r\nincluding respect for cultural and intellectual diversity\r\nand specificity and religious differences among others.\r\nIt must rely on dialogue as the foundation to enhance\r\nsuch respect for the uniqueness of others. Such\r\ndialogue must be aimed at strengthening our common\r\nvalues and common heritage through cooperation and\r\nintegration, so as to arrive at a cultural and religious\r\nrapprochement, which can provide a solid foundation\r\nfor progress. We must also expand the basis of that\r\ndialogue to supplement traditional frameworks,\r\nincluding at the intergovernmental and inter-academic\r\nlevels.\r\nPeople must be brought closer together, along\r\nwith all stakeholders and sectors, as the report of the\r\nSecretary-General makes clear. We must avoid the\r\npoliticization of the dialogue among peoples and\r\ncivilizations. The dialogue should not be used in the\r\nservice of political causes, nor should different\r\nyardsticks and selectivity be used. Policies must be\r\naimed at bringing people together, rather than at\r\npushing them apart.\r\nWe must remember the primacy of religion. All\r\nreligions try to elevate and glorify human beings. We\r\nmust not stigmatize any religion, or consider that one\r\nparticular religion might lead to more violence and\r\nterror than another. We know that the universal\r\nmessage of all religions is tolerance and respect for and\r\nprotection of life and dignity.\r\nThe role of States at the national level is the key\r\nto enhancing the culture of peace and dialogue among\r\ncivilizations. Egypt made clear its acceptance of the\r\nculture of peace on several occasions before\r\nrecognizing it at the international level. Egypt was the\r\nfirst State to reach out towards peace in the Middle\r\nEast through President Anwar Sadats 1977 peace\r\n12\r\nA/60/PV.35\r\ninitiative, since we believe that peace is the very\r\nfoundation of coexistence. That initiative was the\r\nstarting point of the various peace processes in the\r\nMiddle East, which are continuing, despite various\r\nproblems and obstacles in recent years.\r\nIn that context, Egypt was one of the first States\r\nto adopt the Global Agenda and Programme of Action\r\nfor a dialogue among civilizations adopted by the\r\nGeneral Assembly, and major efforts and progress have\r\nbeen made to implement that Programme of Action,\r\nparticularly by enhancing educational programmes in\r\nEgypt to strengthen the culture of peace, freedom,\r\ntolerance, and human rights and to consolidate the\r\nprinciples of democracy, pluralism and fundamental\r\nfreedoms and to expand the participatory basis of all\r\npeoples in the implementation of our national\r\nprogrammes and goals.\r\nEgypt was also a forerunner in the process of\r\nenhancing the culture of peace and dialogue among\r\ncivilizations in the Arab region through its very active\r\nrole in the League of Arab States. The Library of\r\nAlexandria is a very important institution in terms of\r\nenhancing the dialogue among civilizations and respect\r\nfor democracy and human rights. That Library received\r\nthe Anna Lindh Euro-Mediterranean Foundation\r\naward, whose goals include projecting the common\r\nheritage of the Mediterranean region by strengthening\r\nlinks and dialogue between the north and the south of\r\nthe Mediterranean Sea.\r\nWith regard to the Secretary-Generals optimistic\r\nreport on the implementation of the Programme of\r\nAction relating to the dialogue among civilizations and\r\nthe culture of peace and the report of the United\r\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization, which contains many constructive\r\nproposals, further efforts are required on the\r\ninternational level in order to consolidate the\r\nfoundations of the culture of peace. Many regions of\r\nthe world are still involved in war or are under foreign\r\noccupation. Many people are suffering from poverty,\r\nhunger and disease, and many are subject to unfair\r\ninternational economic and trade practices that fail to\r\ntake into account the needs and requirements of the\r\ndeveloping countries, despite the acknowledgement of\r\nthe firm interrelation between development and\r\nsecurity.\r\nLikewise, democracy is often implemented within\r\nStates, but seldom at the international level. Thus we\r\nmust revisit our practices and conduct, enhance mutual\r\nunderstanding and joint work in order to reverse the\r\ncurrent trend.\r\nEgypt hopes that someday the world will realize\r\nthat the year 2000 was not the only year during which\r\nthe Culture of Peace should be observed, and that\r\n21 September should not be considered the only day to\r\ncommemorate peace each year. We believe that every\r\nyear must be a Year of the Culture of Peace and that\r\nevery single day must be a celebration of a just and\r\ncomprehensive peace, based on respect for the rights,\r\nbeliefs and cultures of others. This is the only genuine\r\nchoice that we have in order to be able to provide a\r\nbetter future for generations to come.\r\nMr. Al-Shamsi (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in\r\nArabic): At the outset and on behalf of the delegation\r\nof the United Arab Emirates, I would like to thank His\r\nExcellency Mr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General, for\r\nthe valuable information contained in his report, which\r\nwill certainly strengthen our debate on this item. I also\r\nwould like to express our appreciation to UNESCO for\r\nits fine efforts aimed at safeguarding our cultural\r\ndiversity and encouraging dialogue among\r\ncivilizations.\r\nIn spite of the recommendations agreed on by the\r\nheads of State and Government during the Millennium\r\nSummit five years ago concerning the promotion of a\r\nculture of peace and dialogue among civilizations\r\naimed at eliminating differences, conflicts and\r\nobstacles among peoples and nations of the world, and\r\nreaffirmed in September 2005, ethnic and religious\r\nintolerance and extremism and violence continue to be\r\namong the major challenges that lead to hotbeds of\r\ntension, armed conflicts and violations of human rights\r\nin many countries of the world. This situation makes\r\ninitiatives for dialogue among civilizations even more\r\nimportant, as are political and diplomatic efforts aimed\r\nat achieving greater understanding and rapprochement\r\namong peoples, and at spreading the best human\r\npractices, foremost among which are the principles of\r\nunderstanding, tolerance, solidarity and cooperation.\r\nAll forms of extremism and hatred should be cast\r\naside.\r\nIf we look at recent historical events, especially\r\nthose of the last two decades, we find that, despite the\r\nend of the cold war and reduced conflict between East\r\nand West, we now have new conflicts that have\r\nemerged owing to ethnic, religious and cultural\r\n13\r\nA/60/PV.35\r\ncompetition among peoples, as well as between North\r\nand South and rich and poor. This situation poses a\r\ngreat threat to international peace, security and\r\nstability and places the responsibility for bridging the\r\nwide gap among civilizations on the shoulders of all\r\nStates, religious leaders and other leaders in the social,\r\nscientific, and cultural arenas.\r\nWe affirm that violence and terror, ethnic\r\ncleansing practices and other horrors and war\r\nwitnessed in many areas of the world in recent years\r\nclearly indicate that their perpetrators do not belong to\r\none particular nationality, religion or race, but have\r\nvaried origins and various political, religious and\r\nethnic backgrounds. Therefore, we are deeply\r\nconcerned about the continued campaigns of\r\ndiscrimination, hostility and distortion that many\r\nWestern media agencies are engaged in against certain\r\nethnic and religious groups. We consider these\r\ncampaigns a main source of hatred and discrimination\r\namong peoples and civilizations. Accordingly, as a first\r\nstep, we call upon States and their media to ensure\r\nobjectivity and transparency in handling issues and\r\ncrises pertaining to developing States, and to adopt\r\nserious measures to confront all hostile, provocative\r\nand discriminatory practices committed against\r\npeoples, especially the peoples of the Islamic and Arab\r\nStates.\r\nThe economic and development benefits of\r\nglobalization achieved during the last two decades and\r\nenjoyed by many countries have contributed to\r\nbringing developing countries under the influence of\r\nWestern media and advanced technology, making most\r\nmembers of the younger generation in developing\r\ncountries less connected to the specificities of the\r\ncultural diversity of their own societies. Therefore,\r\nsince we believe in the importance of continued\r\ninteraction and diversity between civilizations, we ask\r\ninstitutions in the developed States to cease their\r\nmonopoly over modern technology, discontinue their\r\nunilateral policies, understand the concerns and issues\r\nof other peoples and nations, and refrain from\r\ninterference in their internal affairs and from denying\r\ntheir national rights.\r\nWe also demand that all initiatives calling for\r\npromoting dialogue among civilizations include serious\r\nand effective measures aimed at resolving problems of\r\ncolonialism and foreign occupation and reducing the\r\ngap between developed and developing countries,\r\nespecially in the areas of poverty, development and\r\nclean and safe environment. In addition, measures\r\nshould also include plans to achieve development\r\nthrough the unconditional liberalization of trade and by\r\ngiving the developing countries access to the latest\r\nproduction technologies so that opportunities for\r\ndevelopment are available for their people. That would\r\nnarrow the gap between these countries and developed\r\nones.\r\nThis should be achieved within a framework\r\nbased on the principles of justice, transparency,\r\nequality among peoples and respect for the dignity,\r\nbeliefs and inalienable rights of human beings, and\r\nrejecting any double standards still practised to this\r\nday with regard to issues and interests of other States.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates, guided by the\r\ntraditions and customs of its Arab society and the\r\nprinciples of Islamic heritage, such as diversity, has\r\nfollowed appropriate policies based on two parallel\r\nprinciples. The first includes the adoption of\r\neducational, cultural and social programs aimed at\r\nreinforcing its humanitarian and moral values among\r\nall social groups in order to ensure better participation\r\nin national development programmes and the\r\nenjoyment of prosperity, while protecting them from\r\nspreading social, psychological, health and cultural ills.\r\nThe second principle aims at developing these values\r\nand concepts and employing them in accordance with\r\nthe requirements of modern times, without altering\r\ntheir essence. It also aims at strengthening, among our\r\ncitizens, the concepts of mutual respect for other\r\ncultures, traditions and beliefs. These principles were\r\narticulated in a speech given by His Highness Sheikh\r\nKhalifa Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan two days ago in his\r\nmeeting with Muslim religious leaders to celebrate the\r\nmonth of Ramadan. In his speech, he stressed the\r\nimportance of showing Islams tolerance and its noble\r\nvalues, which are based on compassion, brotherhood,\r\ntolerance and respect for other religions, and which\r\ncall for virtuous deeds and the consolidation of the\r\nvalues of justice, love, peace and good for others.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates has also promulgated\r\nlaws and decisions to ensure freedom of religious,\r\ncultural and social activities and traditions for foreign\r\nminorities living in the country. In addition, it\r\nencourages cultural events, such as seminars,\r\nworkshops, exhibitions, which include as participants\r\nintellectuals, journalists, artists, musicians, folklore\r\ntroupes and so forth from all over the world, in order to\r\nenrich our societys openness and knowledge of the\r\n14\r\nA/60/PV.35\r\ndiversity of other cultures, ideas and concepts, while\r\nmaintaining our own distinctive cultural environment.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates has entered a number\r\nof bilateral, regional and international agreements and\r\nmemorandums of understanding relating to cooperation\r\nin the fields of cultural exchange, education and media.\r\nIt has also participated in international conferences and\r\nforums on cultural and intellectual issues, which have\r\ncontributed to the enhancement of its interaction and\r\ncooperation with other civilizations.\r\nIn conclusion, we hope that our deliberations will\r\nconstitute a step forward in strengthening dialogue\r\namong civilizations as a new approach and mechanism\r\nfor international relations, building bridges of\r\nunderstanding, cooperation and openness among\r\ncountries and inspiring joint efforts to reinforce peace\r\nand security and the peaceful coexistence of peoples\r\nand future generations.\r\nMr. Akram (Pakistan): Today, the Assembly is\r\nconsidering two important subjects in this joint debate\r\non agenda items 42 and 43.\r\nThe International Decade for a Culture of Peace\r\nand Non-Violence for the Children of the World, 2001-\r\n2010, has entered its fifth year, and I wish to thank the\r\nGovernment of Bangladesh for bringing that initiative\r\nto the agenda of the General Assembly.\r\nDuring this meeting, the Assembly is also\r\nreviewing the progress of the Global Agenda for\r\nDialogue among Civilizations and its Programme of\r\nAction adopted in 2001 (resolution 56/6), for which we\r\nowe our gratitude to the Government of the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran.\r\nPakistan has had a long association with those\r\ntwo initiatives and has traditionally been a sponsor of\r\nthe two draft resolutions introduced by Bangladesh and\r\nIran under those agenda items.\r\nWe are thankful to the Secretary-General for his\r\nreports on the two agenda items.\r\nThe Declaration on a Culture of Peace (resolution\r\n53/243), adopted by the General Assembly on\r\n13 September 1999, sets out a set of values, attitudes\r\nand behaviours. That historic document is based on the\r\nprinciples of multilateral cooperation in accordance\r\nwith the Charter of the United Nations, respect for life,\r\nthe ending of violence and the promotion and the\r\npractice of non-violence through education, dialogue,\r\ncooperation and commitment to the peaceful settlement\r\nof conflicts.\r\nIn our globalized world, there is increased\r\ninteraction among all cultures and civilizations. That\r\nhas given rise to new forms of exchange and\r\nunderstanding among peoples across the regions and\r\nhas created unprecedented opportunities for the\r\ntransmission of ideas.\r\nHowever, the great paradox of todays world is\r\nthat, while it has brought people closer and created vast\r\nnetworks of connectivity and interdependence, it has\r\nalso spawned divisions and frictions among and within\r\nsocieties. Many of those divisions and frictions are\r\nmanifested in religious tones.\r\nThe proliferation of sources and channels of\r\ninformation, instead of promoting a better\r\nunderstanding among peoples, have reinforced\r\nstereotypes and deepened misperceptions. Despite the\r\nsurfeit of instantly available information, the gulf of\r\nmisunderstanding among faiths and civilizations seems\r\nto have grown wider. There is both a knowledge deficit\r\nand an understanding deficit.\r\nMany would agree that the root causes of friction\r\namong cultures and civilizations are not primarily\r\nreligious. The central message of all religions is almost\r\nidentical. The root cause of friction is not a clash of\r\ncivilization but often a clash of political and economic\r\ninterests. Clearly, responses to conflicting political\r\ninterests are often cast in religious terms, but that is\r\nonly an expedient disguise used by those pursuing\r\nnarrow political and national objectives.\r\nThe need to promote cooperation and\r\nunderstanding among religions and cultures is\r\ntherefore a contemporary imperative. Ethnicity,\r\nreligion, culture, language and race must not be\r\nallowed to become a source of division. We must\r\nreassert our common humanity and our common\r\nuniversal values. We must pursue dialogue among\r\ndifferent faiths and build bridges of friendship,\r\nunderstanding and cooperation to ameliorate the\r\nsufferings of those who are the victims of intolerance,\r\ndiscrimination, oppression and injustice.\r\nThere is increasing recognition of the several\r\ninitiatives put forth by certain Member States in recent\r\nyears to bridge the emerging divide between religions,\r\ncultures and civilizations. The proposal of the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran for a dialogue among civilizations,\r\n15\r\nA/60/PV.35\r\nPakistans proposal for enlightened moderation, the\r\ninitiative on interfaith cooperation for peace by the\r\nPhilippines and the proposal for an alliance of\r\ncivilizations recently launched by Spain and Turkey are\r\nmutually reinforcing and seek to promote universal\r\nhuman welfare, freedom and progress. All those\r\ninitiatives can serve as instruments to eliminate\r\nmisunderstandings among faiths and cultures and as an\r\nantidote to the notion of a clash of civilizations.\r\nWe therefore agree with the recommendation in\r\nthe note by the Secretary-General on the midterm\r\nglobal review of the International Decade for a Culture\r\nof Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the\r\nWorld, 2001-2010 (A/60/279), that a global framework\r\nshould be promoted to integrate the various objectives\r\nof the Declaration and Programme of Action on a\r\nCulture of Peace (resolution 53/243 A and B).\r\nThere is a need to develop coordination\r\nmachinery at the national, regional and international\r\nlevels to strengthen cooperation among all relevant\r\nactors: the United Nations system, Member States,\r\ncivil society organizations and non-governmental\r\norganizations.\r\nAny endeavour to promote interfaith harmony\r\nand cooperation at the international level needs to\r\ncover political, social, economic, religious and cultural\r\nand institutional aspects. The way forward is to foster\r\nmutual understanding and concentrate resources on\r\nhuman development, poverty alleviation, education and\r\nsocial justice.\r\nAt the political level, interfaith harmony requires\r\nthe rectification of the political injustices to which so\r\nmany people are often subjected on account of their\r\nfaith or beliefs.\r\nPakistan has sought to promote religious\r\ntolerance, understanding and cooperation within the\r\nUnited Nations for several years. At its fifty-eighth and\r\nfifty-ninth sessions, the General Assembly adopted\r\nPakistans resolution on the promotion of religious and\r\ncultural understanding, harmony and cooperation,\r\nwhich emphasizes, inter alia, the need to strengthen\r\nfreedom, justice, tolerance, cooperation and respect for\r\nthe diversity of cultures and religions, which are all\r\nimportant elements for building international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nThis year, Pakistan will again introduce under\r\nthis agenda item a draft resolution highlighting the\r\nprinciples that enhance human well-being and freedom\r\nby uniting our efforts to secure universal peace. It is\r\nour hope that the General Assembly will once again\r\nadopt by consensus Pakistans draft resolution on\r\npromotion of religious and cultural understanding,\r\nharmony and cooperation. That would demonstrate our\r\ncollective resolve to promote peace, prosperity and\r\nhope for all and our categorical rejection of\r\nintolerance, hate and discrimination.\r\nMr. Menan (Togo) (spoke in French): The\r\nGeneral Assemblys commitment to promoting a\r\nculture of peace is justified by the fact that the current\r\nstate of the world remains marked by armed conflicts,\r\nthe persistent threat of terrorism and the proliferation\r\nof weapons of mass destruction and small arms and\r\nlight weapons. Those scourges distance us from the\r\ngoal of peace, which inspired the founders of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nMr. Loizaga (Paraguay), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe Secretary-General reminds us of this when\r\nhe rightly stresses in his Report on the Work of the\r\nOrganization that the violent internal conflicts that still\r\npersist the world over cause millions of civilian\r\nvictims, result in spillover to neighbouring countries\r\nand heighten the threat to peace and international\r\nsecurity. And yet, faithful to its commitment to\r\npreserve future generations from the scourge of war,\r\nthe United Nations has consistently attempted to\r\nprevent conflicts, to settle them and to build peace. The\r\nmany, costly peacekeeping operations under way in the\r\nworld, particularly in Africa, seek to secure peace\r\nthrough the disarmament, demobilization and the\r\nreintegration of former combatants and through the\r\norganization of elections in some countries. They\r\nillustrate the key role that the United Nations plays in\r\nthis area.\r\nAt the regional level, and particularly in Africa,\r\nour countries are setting up structures that can promote\r\nand strengthen peace, as apparent in the establishment\r\nby the African Union of a Peace and Security Council,\r\nas well as the African Peer Review Mechanism,\r\ninstitutions that function and express the desire of\r\nAfrica to take control of its own destiny.\r\nThe determination of the international community\r\nto strengthen and promote peace and security should,\r\nhowever, not make us lose sight of how important it is\r\nto further strengthen bonds among the principle organs\r\n16\r\nA/60/PV.35\r\nof the United Nations, the General Assembly, the\r\nSecurity Council and the Economic and Social Council\r\non the one hand, and between the United Nations and\r\nregional organizations on the other, in order to move\r\nforward in achieving peace for the peoples of the\r\nworld.\r\nIn this connection, the decision of the High-level\r\nPlenary Meeting to create a Peacebuilding Commission\r\nis a considerable achievement, and the delegation of\r\nTogo hopes that the consultations begun by the General\r\nAssembly will lead to making the Commission\r\noperational.\r\nThe ongoing quest for a peace-loving world is\r\ntruly appropriate during the Decade for the Culture of\r\nPeace proclaimed in 2001. Togo welcomes the many\r\nactivities conducted under the aegis of UNESCO at the\r\ninternational and national levels, actions described\r\nthoroughly in the report of the Secretary-General\r\n(A/60/279). Among the many activities occurring under\r\nthe auspices of the United Nations system, we cite in\r\nparticular the UNESCO public awareness campaign \r\nUNESCO being the coordinator of the programme for\r\nthe Decade  which has increased awareness of the\r\nidea that the culture of peace goes hand in hand with\r\nthe dialogue among civilizations. This is particularly\r\nthe case following the horrendous act of terrorism of\r\n11 September 2001 in the United States.\r\nLikewise, within countries, UNESCOs\r\ncommunities should continue to strive to ensure that\r\npeoples heed the values of tolerance, respect for others,\r\ncultural diversity and peaceful coexistence. Thus, we\r\nare happy to see that this debate is taking place a few\r\ndays after UNESCOs adoption of the Convention on\r\nthe Protection of the Diversity of Cultural Contents and\r\nArtistic Expressions. Furthermore, we should like to\r\nemphasize that the information and recommendations\r\ncontained in the Secretary-Generals report make it\r\npossible to move forward towards a culture of peace\r\nbetween now and the end of the decade in 2010.\r\nAs is well known, actions carried out or initiated\r\nby the United Nations system in cooperation with\r\nStates, particularly in the spheres of education, the\r\npromotion of human rights and democracy, have a\r\nchance to succeed only if they have the support of the\r\nGovernments of our countries. As far as Togo is\r\nconcerned, we can never repeat often enough that the\r\nauthorities of Togo have always considered the quest\r\nfor peace, within as well as outside of the country, the\r\nvery foundation of our countrys policy.\r\nThus, a few months ago, after his election as\r\nleader of our country, His Excellency Faure\r\nGnassingbé took the decision to create a Commission\r\nof Reflection on and Rehabilitation of Togos History.\r\nAny observer knowledgeable of political life in Togo\r\ncan recognize that this commission will make it\r\npossible to rehabilitate all those who have played a\r\ndecisive role in the political history of Togo. For the\r\nGovernment of Togo, the establishment of such a\r\ncommission is the key stage in enhancing the national\r\nreconciliation and unity of our country.\r\nApart from preventing war, the culture of peace\r\nshould also be construed as a culture whose goal is to\r\nensure the well-being of the peoples of our countries.\r\nIndeed, in our world, where more than half of the\r\npopulation still survives on less than a dollar a day, a\r\nworld where poverty and misery strike large numbers\r\nof men, women and children and prevent them from\r\nmeeting their very basic and fundamental needs, we\r\ncan understand quite easily that for those wretched of\r\nthe earth, peace means first and foremost, living\r\nwithout want.\r\nIn this connection, the delegation of Togo hopes\r\nthat the need to achieve the Millennium Development\r\nGoals by 2015, which was reaffirmed strongly by the\r\nHigh-level Plenary of the General Assembly, will\r\nreceive the support needed, which our countries are\r\nentitled to expect from their development partners.\r\nThus, convinced that the success of the Decade of the\r\nCulture of Peace depends on the same factors, Togo\r\nhas this year become a sponsor of the draft resolution\r\njust introduced by Bangladesh.\r\nIn conclusion, the delegation of Togo should like\r\nto recall that peace is a form of behaviour that must\r\nconsistently reflect moral values such as justice,\r\ntolerance, mutual understanding and a heightened\r\nsense of the need to share. We believe that the true\r\nmeaning of the Decade for Peace is to be found in the\r\npractice of these values.\r\nMr. Rybakov (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): With\r\nthe proclamation of 2001 as the Year of Dialogue\r\namong Civilizations, the international community took\r\nan important step forward in the interests of peace,\r\nstability and security. That is why the Republic of\r\nBelarus supports and encourages the concept of\r\ndialogue among civilizations. The globalization of the\r\n17\r\nA/60/PV.35\r\nworld and the new threats and challenges increasingly\r\nremind us of how multifaceted is the interdependence\r\nbetween peoples and countries in various areas of\r\nhuman activity, including the environment, health care,\r\nthe economy, culture and security.\r\nTodays world reminds the international\r\ncommunity of the need to unite our efforts and develop\r\nglobal partnerships, primarily through a deeper\r\nappreciation of the value of diversity of civilizations\r\nand of diverse paths to progress. It is on the basis of\r\nthat understanding that the delegation of Belarus joins\r\nthe sponsors of draft resolution A/60/L.6, entitled\r\nGlobal Agenda for Dialogue among Civilizations.\r\nWe are pleased that the Global Agenda for\r\nDialogue among Civilizations is attracting increasing\r\ninterest from Member States, international\r\norganizations and civil society. The holding of an\r\nincreasing number of dialogue-related events  such\r\nas cultural festivals, exchange programmes, joint\r\nprojects and conferences in the areas of education,\r\nscience and culture  promotes a better understanding\r\namong peoples and encourages a culture of peace.\r\nThe establishment of the Alliance of Civilizations\r\nmay lend additional impetus to the popularization of an\r\napproach based on a dialogue among civilizations. We\r\nexpect the United Nations Educational, Scientific and\r\nCultural Organization to play an active role and\r\nwelcome its efforts for a dialogue among civilizations.\r\nFor each country it is crucial that the\r\nachievements of its national culture  in all its\r\ndiversity of shape, character and style  become\r\nknown beyond its borders. That helps mutual\r\nunderstanding and tolerance and promotes dialogue\r\namong civilizations. Mutual understanding among\r\nStates is possible only when the representatives of one\r\nethnic group know about and respect the culture,\r\ntraditions and customs of others.\r\nWith each passing year, Belarus is steadily\r\nproving to be a forum for important international\r\nfestivals, arts competitions, exhibitions and meetings\r\nfor representatives of the artistic community. Belarus\r\nalso attaches great importance to the commemoration\r\nof milestones and significant events in our history that\r\nportray mutual interaction and complementarity of\r\ncultures. This year, Belarus instituted a special prize on\r\npromoting peace and mutual understanding through art,\r\nwhich is awarded to individuals involved in culture and\r\nart, as well as to creative groups and organizations,\r\nwho have made a significant contribution to\r\nstrengthening international cultural cooperation and\r\nhave highlighted the achievements and models of a\r\nglobal arts culture based on humane ideals and values.\r\nOur delegation agrees with Secretary-General\r\nthat it is essential to promote the idea of dialogue\r\namong civilizations directly at the local level, so that it\r\ncan produce tangible results and be important for the\r\nentire international community.\r\nThe distinguishing feature of the cultural\r\nlandscape in Belarus is the presence in our country of\r\nmore than 140 ethnic cultures and peoples: Russians,\r\nPoles, Lithuanians, Latvians, Ukrainians, Jews, Tatars\r\nand others. Those cultures have historical roots in\r\nBelarus, as well as their own destinies and\r\ndistinguishing features. While retaining their national\r\ndiversity, taken together, they are part of our overall\r\nnational cultural heritage. The Governments cultural\r\npolicy protects the natural coexistence and interaction\r\namong cultures and among ethnic communities with\r\nBelarusian culture. It guarantees the free development\r\nof national and ethnic groups among the countrys\r\npopulation and seeks to allow them both free\r\nexpression of their specific cultural orientation and\r\nintegration into the our larger, common culture. The\r\nGovernment supports cultural, spiritual and linguistic\r\nties between citizens from other national origins and\r\nthe countries of their forebears.\r\nIn conclusion, the delegation of Belarus would\r\nlike to proclaim its firm support for the Global Agenda\r\nfor Dialogue among Civilizations as the basis for the\r\nestablishment and strengthening of mutual\r\nunderstanding and trust among countries and peoples.\r\nMr. Assaf (Lebanon) (spoke in Arabic): Today\r\nthe General Assembly resumes its consideration of the\r\ndialogue among civilizations so as to evaluate the\r\nimplementation of the Global Agenda for Dialogue\r\namong Civilizations, adopted four years ago. Our\r\ndiscussion this year also coincides with the mid-term\r\nglobal review of the International Decade for a Culture\r\nof Peace, which is a natural outcome of the dialogue.\r\nThe United Nations is the best forum for a\r\ndialogue among civilizations and the establishment of\r\nnew norms in international relations. UNESCO has\r\ncarried out a wide range of seminars and conferences\r\nin order to spread and strengthen dialogue. There are\r\nmany items and draft resolutions on the Assemblys\r\nagenda for the sixtieth session that call for dialogue,\r\n18\r\nA/60/PV.35\r\ninteraction and tolerance, among others: the draft\r\nresolution on the Global Agenda for Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations (A/60/L.6), the draft resolution on the\r\nInternational Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-\r\nViolence for the Children of the World, 2001-2010\r\n(A/60/L.5), a draft resolution on human rights and\r\ncultural diversity and the draft resolution on the\r\npromotion of interreligious dialogue and cooperation\r\nfor peace (A/60/L.4).\r\nIf we look around us we will surely find that we\r\nare governed by dialogue and interaction. Civilizations\r\nand cultures are diverse and numerous, as are\r\nlanguages and races. Those differences are an\r\nindisputable reality, and they make dialogue\r\nindispensable. Dialogue among civilizations means an\r\nacknowledgement of differences vis-à-vis others and\r\nan acceptance of those differences.\r\nDifferences are at the heart of dialogue. One\r\ncannot really envision a dialogue between two similar\r\nentities. Dialogue means dealing with diversity and\r\ndifference as a source of enrichment, not as a source of\r\ndanger. Dialogue among civilizations aims to achieve\r\ninteraction and complementarity. It does not\r\nnecessarily mean trying to integrate or erase the other.\r\nDialogue means affirming the existence of the other,\r\nwho is by definition different. It does not mean trying\r\nto eliminate or alienate that other.\r\nDialogue means an acknowledgement that our\r\nownership of the truth is relative. Truth cannot be the\r\nsole property of any one civilization or culture. It is the\r\njoint property of all civilizations.\r\nAccordingly, we should always try to see the\r\ngood in others so we can benefit from it. We should\r\nalways examine our shortcomings so we can correct\r\nthem. Dialogue means tolerance. It does not mean the\r\npowerful imposing their will on the weak; it means\r\nlistening to others. That way, the weak and the\r\nvulnerable will feel that the powerful do listen to them,\r\nand the powerful will feel the obligation to explain and\r\njustify their position to others.\r\nIn his report on the Global Agenda for Dialogue\r\namong Civilizations (A/60/259), the Secretary-General\r\nnotes that the Lebanese Ministry of Education\r\ninformed the Secretariat of the actions taken by the\r\nLebanese Government to encourage dialogue among\r\ncivilizations. In Lebanon, such a dialogue is not merely\r\na slogan or a principle. It is a reality we experience and\r\nlive every day. Dialogue is evident in the diverse\r\nreligious and cultural arenas. The will of Muslims and\r\nChristians to coexist is what makes Lebanon a model\r\nfor coming together. That fact led to the observation by\r\nthe late Pope John Paul II that Lebanon is more than a\r\ncountry; Lebanon is a message.\r\nIn the context of the Global Agenda for Dialogue\r\namong Civilizations, the Ninth Summit of la\r\nFrancophonie, held in Lebanon from 18 to 20 October\r\n2002, adopted the Beirut Declaration on the dialogue\r\nof cultures. The Declaration calls for thematic\r\ndialogues on issues such as our openness to ideas\r\ndifferent from our own, the appreciation of differences\r\nand distinctions, and the search for common and shared\r\nvalues.\r\nOur fulfilment of the Global Agenda for Dialogue\r\namong Civilizations depends on our resolve, as peoples\r\nof the United Nations, to fulfil the commitment set out\r\nin the Preamble of the United Nations Charter: to\r\npractice tolerance and live in peace with one another as\r\ngood neighbours. That way, the enemy of yesterday\r\nwill become the friend of today, and the friend of today\r\nwill be tomorrows ally.\r\nMr. Mutahar (Yemen) (spoke in Arabic): Today,\r\nyears after the adoption of the United Nations Decade\r\nfor Human Rights Education, we underline the\r\nimportance of respect for human rights and basic\r\nfreedoms for all, regardless of race, gender, language,\r\nreligion, political or other beliefs, national or social\r\norigin, financial situation, place of birth or any other\r\ncondition. Now, we must redouble our efforts to\r\nimprove international human rights conditions.\r\nIn recent years we have stressed the importance\r\nof establishing international standards and mechanisms\r\nfor ethical and legal human rights frameworks in order\r\nto overcome historical and cultural differences so that\r\nhuman rights and respect for human dignity are held as\r\nsuperior values governing all nations.\r\nAlthough efforts have been made, human rights\r\nviolations remain a grave concern for all because of\r\ntheir horrendous and serious nature. We continue to\r\nhear of cases of racial discrimination and violence\r\nagainst vulnerable groups such as women, children, the\r\nelderly and the handicapped, as well as acts of murder,\r\ndetentions and extrajudicial killings. While the\r\ninternational community has given the issue significant\r\nattention, it is not enough. We need cooperation at all\r\nlevels to raise public awareness and spread the culture\r\nof human rights among all members of society. In that\r\n19\r\nA/60/PV.35\r\ncontext, in the 2005 World Summit outcome document\r\n(resolution 60/1), heads of State and Government\r\nemphasized the need to promote human rights\r\neducation at all levels and encouraged States to\r\ndevelop awareness initiatives in that respect.\r\nSince its unification on 22 May 1990, Yemen has\r\nattached great importance to the issues of human rights\r\nand private and public freedoms. That concern is\r\nembodied in laws that have been enacted, beginning\r\nwith the constitution, and is reflected in Yemens\r\nsigning and ratification of international and regional\r\nhuman rights agreements and conventions.\r\nAs a sign of the importance that the Republic of\r\nYemen attaches to human rights, we have created a\r\nMinistry for Human Rights, part of the executive\r\nbranch of Government. The Ministry is currently\r\nheaded by a woman. Its main goals include the\r\nproposal of plans, policies, programmes and measures\r\nthat guarantee the promotion of human rights; plans to\r\neducate citizens on their legal rights under the\r\nconstitution and State laws; to spread a human rights\r\nculture throughout society by various means of public\r\neducation; to cooperate with civil society human rights\r\norganizations, involving them in the discussion of\r\nnational reports on human rights conventions; and to\r\norganize activities and educational awareness efforts\r\non human rights issues.\r\nYemen was among the first States to ratify the\r\nhuman rights treaties and agreements and actively\r\nseeks to incorporate the provisions of those treaties\r\ninto Yemeni laws, making them no mere words on\r\npaper but concretely implemented law. As part of those\r\nefforts, the Republic of Yemen formulates national\r\nplans incorporating the awareness and the promotion of\r\na culture of peace and human rights. Those plans\r\ninclude Yemens Strategic Vision through 2025, the\r\nnational strategy for youth integration, the national\r\nstrategy for literacy and adult education, the gender\r\nstrategy in agriculture and food security and the\r\nnational population plan for 2001-2020.\r\nYemeni society has been characterized by moral\r\nand religious tolerance since ancient times. Those\r\nvalues have their origin in the Islamic faith, which\r\nprohibits discrimination and separation and encourages\r\nbrotherhood and peace. In Yemen, we have a Jewish\r\nminority that enjoys the rights and duties of Yemeni\r\ncitizenship and full freedom to practice their religious\r\nrights and rituals, as established by the constitution.\r\nThe Government of Yemen has also given attention to\r\nmedia, cultural and religious discourse, including\r\njournalism and the media, and encourages scholars,\r\npreachers, university professors and religious seminars\r\nand educators to properly explain the doctrines and the\r\nbenevolent views of Islam. In that context, the Ministry\r\nof Education has unified the curriculum in primary and\r\nsecondary education throughout the country. Religious\r\nschools have also become part of the public education\r\nsystem in order to unify ideas among all segments of\r\nYemeni society and to avoid fanaticism and extremism.\r\nWe should also point out that the political\r\nleadership in Yemen has paid special attention to the\r\nculture of peace and has sought to provide living\r\nexamples that show tolerance and brotherhood to\r\nYemeni youth. These include amnesty for the 16\r\nindividuals who began the war of separation in 1994\r\nand all of those who took part in that war, as well as\r\ninvitations for them to return to the country and to take\r\npart in its reconstruction. Also included is the release\r\nof all detainees who were imprisoned in the aftermath\r\nof the riots that took place in Yemen in 2004, and\r\nallowing members of the family that ruled prior to the\r\nYemeni revolution to return and to be compensated for\r\nthe loss of their property.\r\nIn its fight against extremism, Yemen depends on\r\ndialogue with the extremists in order to spread the\r\nculture of peace and to enlighten them in Islamic\r\nvalues that call for tolerance and brotherhood. In that\r\ncontext, we held an international seminar in the\r\nYemeni capital, Sanaa, from 18 to 22 September,\r\norganized by Bridges among Cultures.\r\nConcerning foreign relations, Yemen believes in\r\nthe principle of peaceful coexistence among nations,\r\nand has proved beyond a doubt that its policy is in line\r\nwith that principle. This can be seen in its resolution\r\nthrough peaceful means of its border conflicts with its\r\nneighbours.\r\nThe principles of human rights are mandatory. We\r\nmust implement them and make certain that our\r\ncommitment to the objectives of the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights will not affect the\r\ncultural specificities of each State.\r\nIn conclusion, we emphasize that international\r\nresolutions must maintain neutrality and avoid double\r\nstandards and selectivity when dealing with human\r\nrights issues.\r\n20\r\nA/60/PV.35\r\nMs. Ng Yen Yen (Malaysia): First and foremost,\r\nmy delegation would like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his reports on the promotion of\r\ninterreligious dialogue (A/60/201) and the\r\nimplementation of the Global Agenda for Dialogue\r\namong Civilizations (A/60/259), and the note of the\r\nSecretary-General on the midterm global review of the\r\nInternational Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-\r\nViolence for the Children of the World, 2001-2010\r\n(A/60/279).\r\nThe desire for peace has always run parallel to\r\nthe innate nature of human beings to battle against one\r\nanother. Our modern history has witnessed two horrible\r\nworld wars that brought untold sorrow and suffering to\r\nhumankind. In order to save succeeding generations\r\nfrom the scourge of such wars, the United Nations was\r\nfounded with the solemn determination to practice\r\ntolerance and live together in peace with one another.\r\nIt is disheartening to note that recent tragic\r\nevents  from the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks\r\nand the Madrid and London bombings, to the latest\r\nincident in Bali  have further exacerbated the\r\nwidening gap among civilizations and generated a\r\nnegative perspective of Islam, particularly among non-\r\nMuslims in the West and elsewhere. There is a dire\r\nneed to correct the misconception that acts of terrorism\r\nare sanctioned by any particular religion or culture.\r\nTerrorism must be attributed to the perpetrators and not\r\nthe religion they profess. It is totally unjustifiable to\r\nassociate terrorism with any particular race or religion.\r\nThe root causes of any act of terrorism must be\r\ncarefully examined in order to effectively address and\r\ncombat terrorism.\r\nThe international community must recognize the\r\nimportance of engaging communities in the promotion\r\nof religious and cultural understanding and of\r\neliminating all forms of religious intolerance.\r\nHowever, it is regrettable that these issues are being\r\napproached within the narrow perspective of a subset\r\nof the larger debate on counter-terrorism. This\r\nrepresents a superficial manner of dealing with the real\r\nissues.\r\nRealizing that ominous trend, Malaysia supports\r\ninitiatives such as the culture of peace, dialogue among\r\ncivilizations, and interfaith dialogues, which are\r\nimportant international efforts to promote mutual\r\nunderstanding and cooperation through intercultural,\r\ninter-civilizational and interreligious programmes. We\r\nbelieve that positive interaction among peoples of\r\ndiverse cultures and values would contribute to the\r\nattainment of global peace and stability, which are\r\nessential for the achievement of sustainable economic\r\nand social development.\r\nIn Malaysia, we live in a national setting which is\r\nmultireligious, multiethnic and multicultural. Islam, the\r\nofficial religion, and other religions and faiths, coexist\r\nin a tolerant environment. The Government has\r\nembarked on a programme to communicate a proper\r\nappreciation of Islam as a force for good and progress\r\nthat emphasizes development consistent with the tenets\r\nof Islam, and focuses on enhancing the quality of life.\r\nWe call that approach Islam Hadari or civilizational\r\nIslam, which has been promoted by the Prime\r\nMinister of Malaysia since 2004. Through that\r\napproach, Malaysia has successfully managed its\r\nmultiracial and multireligious society in a fair manner.\r\nCivil society in Malaysia has also embarked on\r\nvarious initiatives to promote a culture of peace and\r\ninterreligious dialogue, of which I would mention only\r\na few. In April 2002 and March 2003, the Human\r\nRights Commission of Malaysia initiated an interfaith\r\ndialogue in Kuala Lumpur, attended by representatives\r\nof major religious groups in Malaysia. Another effort\r\nby Malaysian civil society has been the establishment\r\nof the Peoples Alliance for Peace Malaysia, or Peace\r\nMalaysia, which is active in peace and humanitarian\r\naid activities. The work of Peace Malaysia has become\r\nglobal in reach and includes aid for tsunami victims in\r\nIndonesia and Sri Lanka and earthquake victims in\r\nPakistan, as well as support for the rights of the\r\nPalestinian people.\r\nAt the international level, Malaysia hosted the\r\ninaugural meeting of the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConferences Commission of Eminent Persons, from\r\n27 to 29 January 2005 in Putrajaya  the federal\r\nadministrative capital. The meeting outlined proposals\r\nfor cross-cultural and interreligious dialogue, including\r\nthrough regional and multilateral organizations.\r\nMalaysia will also organize the third Asia Europe\r\nMeeting ministerial conference on cultures and\r\ncivilizations in Kuala Lumpur in 2007.\r\nMy delegation is describing Malaysias\r\nexperience in order to emphasize the point that there is\r\na national as well as an international dimension to the\r\nissue of the peaceful and cooperative coexistence of\r\nreligions, cultures and civilizations. Malaysia believes\r\n21\r\nA/60/PV.35\r\nthat if Governments succeed in establishing a culture\r\nof tolerance and moderation among people at the\r\nnational level, it will be easy for States to cooperate in\r\npromoting tolerance and moderation among\r\nnationalities and cultures at the international level and\r\nthus achieve global peace.\r\nMr. Lwin (Myanmar): At the outset, I thank the\r\nSecretary-General for his report on the promotion of\r\ninterreligious dialogue (A/60/201) and commend the\r\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization (UNESCO) for its report on the midterm\r\nglobal review of the International Decade for a Culture\r\nof Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the\r\nWorld, 2001-2010 (A/60/279).\r\nAt its fifty-second session, the General Assembly\r\nadopted resolution 52/15, which proclaimed 2000 the\r\nInternational Year for the Culture of Peace. The\r\nfollowing year, the General Assembly, in resolution\r\n53/25, added momentum to the promotion of the\r\nculture of peace by including the issue of children, and\r\nproclaimed the decade 2001-2010 the International\r\nDecade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for\r\nthe Children of the World. The special importance that\r\nthe international community attaches to the culture of\r\npeace was underscored in the historic Millennium\r\nDeclaration. This year is the midpoint of the\r\nInternational Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-\r\nViolence for the Children of the World. It is, indeed, an\r\nopportune time to review the progress that we have\r\nmade in the past five years.\r\nThe world is facing serious, new challenges\r\ntoday. Conflicts in various parts of the world, terrorism\r\nand transnational crime, which respect no borders,\r\nhave serious negative consequences on development,\r\npeace and security. To meet the new challenges, we\r\nmust work together cooperatively. We must\r\nacknowledge the importance of respect and\r\nunderstanding for religious and cultural diversity. We\r\nmust promote the culture of peace. In fact, the\r\npromotion of a culture of peace is very important as we\r\nstrive to achieve universal peace.\r\nThe United Nations has played a leading role in\r\nmaintaining and promoting a culture of peace, through\r\nthe adoption of international instruments, declarations\r\nand plans of action.\r\nMyanmar attaches special importance to\r\npromoting a culture of peace, which we implement at\r\nthe national level and in our relations with our\r\nneighbours. Myanmar shares common borders with\r\nfive countries, including the two most populous nations\r\nin the world, China and India. It is our adherence to\r\nmutual respect and the understanding of different\r\ncultures and traditions that enables us to have peaceful\r\nand friendly relations with all our neighbours. We also\r\nhave a strong resolve to maintain and further\r\nstrengthen our amicable relationships not only with our\r\nimmediate neighbours but also with all the countries of\r\nthe world.\r\nMyanmar is home to more than 100 national\r\nraces. The Government attaches great importance to\r\nnational unity and the maintenance of peace and\r\nstability. Having had to face the scourge of insurgency\r\nfor more than 50 years, Myanmar greatly values peace\r\nand stability. Understanding and mutual respect have\r\nplayed an important role in the Governments\r\nsuccessful efforts to bring 17 armed insurgent groups\r\ninto the legal fold. With peace and stability now\r\nprevailing in almost all parts of the country, the\r\nGovernment is able to help bring development to the\r\nborder areas. In order to strengthen ties and promote\r\nthe economic and social development of national races\r\ninhabiting the border areas, the Government has\r\nimplemented a border area development programme.\r\nIt has spent 65 billion kyats and more than $550\r\nmillion in infrastructure development, including\r\ncommunication networks and education and health\r\nfacilities, thus enhancing the quality of life of the\r\ninhabitants. We strongly believe that meaningful\r\npoverty alleviation contributes to the realization of the\r\nculture of peace.\r\nIn promoting the culture of peace, respect for and\r\nunderstanding of different religions and cultures is very\r\nimportant. While Theravada Buddhism is the religion\r\nof the majority of people in Myanmar, other religions\r\nsuch as Christianity, Islam and Hinduism coexist and\r\nflourish. It is common in Myanmar to find people of\r\none faith celebrating joyously and harmoniously in the\r\nfestivals of other religions. Religious feast days of all\r\nreligions are calendar holidays, and senior leaders of\r\nthe country participate in the observance of those\r\nreligious ceremonies. Thus, Mrs. Sadako Ogata, the\r\nformer Independent Expert on the Human Rights\r\nSituation in Myanmar, cited the country as a model\r\nsociety for religious tolerance.\r\nIt is fitting that the issue of children has been\r\nlinked to the issue of a culture of peace. Children are\r\nour future. We believe that children who grow up in a\r\n22\r\nA/60/PV.35\r\npeaceful environment can build a brighter future as\r\nthey become the leaders of tomorrow. That is why, in\r\ncreating a world fit for children, in Myanmar we have\r\nstrived for and attained peace and stability. We have\r\nalso set out a national plan of action for the promotion,\r\nprotection and development of children. We also attach\r\nimportance to promoting human rights. We believe in\r\neducating our children at an early stage and have\r\nincluded human rights education in school curricula\r\nnationwide.\r\nThe decades priority theme for 2005 is equality\r\nbetween women and men, in the context of the\r\nconclusion of the Beijing Plus 10 process. In Myanmar,\r\nwe have made great strides in fostering gender\r\nequality.\r\nThe women of Myanmar enjoy equal rights with\r\nmen with regard to inheritance and divorce. A unique\r\nfeature of Myanmar culture is that women retain their\r\nmaiden names even after marriage. Myanmar women\r\nhave specific claims of ownership to a husbands\r\nproperty. Moreover, Myanmar women, regardless of\r\nrace or religion, enjoy equal rights under national laws.\r\nTo fulfil the commitments undertaken at Beijing,\r\nthe Myanmar National Committee for Womens Affairs\r\nwas established in July 1996. To give further impetus\r\nto the promotion of the role of women, the protection\r\nof womens rights and the economic empowerment of\r\nwomen, the Myanmar Womens Affairs Federation was\r\nformed in December 2003 as an umbrella organization\r\nfor the many non-governmental organizations working\r\nfor the overall development of women.\r\nMy delegation fully shares the view that all\r\nreligions, cultures and civilizations contribute to the\r\nenrichment of humankind. We firmly believe that the\r\npromotion of a culture of peace and dialogue among\r\ndiverse religions through understanding, respect and\r\ntolerance would go a long way in bringing peace and\r\nharmony worldwide. It is a worthy endeavour that will\r\nbenefit present and future generations. It is an\r\nendeavour in which we are firmly resolved to take\r\nactive part.\r\nMr. Gruetter (Switzerland) (spoke in French):\r\nSwitzerland thanks the Secretary-General for his\r\ninformative report on the Global Agenda for Dialogue\r\namong Civilizations (A/60/259), and welcomes the\r\ndraft resolution proposed by the Islamic Republic of\r\nIran that seeks to further intensify the dialogue among\r\ncivilizations. Switzerland also supports the Secretary-\r\nGenerals initiative on an Alliance of Civilizations,\r\nwhich was launched on the initiative of the Spanish\r\nand Turkish Governments.\r\nMutual understanding among cultures is\r\nindispensable for the peaceful coexistence of different\r\ncivilizations. Switzerland, as a country made up of\r\ndifferent cultures and religions, has had to learn how to\r\ncoexist peacefully in its small territory. It has had to\r\novercome differences of religious denomination,\r\nlanguage and economic interests in order to create\r\nnational unity while respecting diversity. Its history has\r\nbeen marked by violent confrontations between\r\nmembers of different religious denominations. Those\r\nconfrontations ended a century and a half ago, thanks\r\nlargely to a common determination to concentrate on\r\nideas that united the different communities in practice,\r\nrather than focusing on those that set them apart in\r\ntheory. The prerequisite for that success was respect\r\nfor difference, and the conviction that every potential\r\nconflict can be resolved by dialogue. Democratic\r\nconsultation, strong measures to protect minorities and\r\nconstant efforts to achieve compromise were\r\nindispensable tools in the construction of our country.\r\nMy reason for reflecting on my countrys\r\nexperience is to try to draw a number of general\r\nconclusions. First, diversity can be a benefit only if the\r\nappreciation of difference is not used to overlook\r\npolitical, economic and cultural biases and injustices.\r\nSecondly, mutual respect and tolerance are\r\nindispensable for the peaceful coexistence of different\r\ngroups in society.\r\nThirdly, mutual respect on the basis of shared\r\nhuman values only develops within a democratic\r\npolitical and legal framework that respects minorities\r\nand is based on the rule of law. The active participation\r\nof minorities in political debate and decision-making is\r\nvital to avoid a situation in which democracy\r\ndegenerates into a tyranny of the majority.\r\nFourthly, even if, on the one hand, the invocation\r\nof shared values is often not enough in and of itself to\r\nresolve conflicts and overcome misunderstandings, one\r\nmust, on the other hand, recognize that the political\r\nand legal framework of a democracy remains a dead\r\nletter, and may even appear to be unjust, if it is not\r\nanimated by a spirit of mutual respect and of shared\r\nbasic values.\r\n23\r\nA/60/PV.35\r\nGiven the sometimes increasing difficulties of\r\nunderstanding between the different cultures of our\r\nworld, the initiative for an Alliance of Civilizations has\r\ncome at the right moment. We are convinced that it\r\nwill be able to build on the rich experience acquired in\r\nthe Global Agenda for Dialogue among Civilizations,\r\nwith a view to analysing, in a sophisticated manner, the\r\ncauses of and the difficulties engendered by\r\nmisunderstandings, as well as proposing joint measures\r\nto alleviate them.\r\nIn that spirit, Switzerland has already launched\r\nseveral projects at the international level aimed at\r\nmutual learning and specific cooperation in areas of\r\ncommon interest between factions separated by\r\nimportant ideological or religious differences.\r\nRecently, Switzerland has been particularly interested\r\nin understanding the religious dimensions of\r\nmisunderstandings and conflicts, and has drawn two\r\nconclusions: first, progress can only be reached after\r\nconcrete steps are taken to build confidence; and,\r\nsecondly, a dialogue about values alone does not\r\nstrengthen confidence.\r\nThe Secretary-General has established a High-\r\nlevel Group within the framework of the Alliance of\r\nCivilizations. In the terms of reference for that Group,\r\nhe calls for the identification of collective actions that\r\nwill establish a paradigm of mutual respect between\r\ncivilizations and cultures. Switzerland is willing, in\r\nthat respect, to share its experiences with the High-\r\nlevel Group and with the secretariat of the Alliance of\r\nCivilizations.\r\nMr. Erçin (Turkey): Turkey aligns itself with the\r\nstatement made by the representative of the United\r\nKingdom on behalf of the European Union on agenda\r\nitem 43, entitled Culture of peace. I wish, therefore,\r\nto expound our views on the other item that we are\r\ndiscussing today, namely, the Global Agenda for\r\nDialogue among Civilizations.\r\nThe nature and scope of the challenges and\r\nthreats to the peace, security, welfare and progress of\r\nthe world today have certainly made the need for a\r\ngenuine dialogue among different cultures and\r\ncivilizations more essential than ever. The events of the\r\nrecent past have not only reinforced that notion, but\r\nhave also led to its being placed high on the\r\ninternational agenda.\r\nAt this critical juncture, Turkey believes that a\r\nmeaningful and operational dialogue within the\r\ninternational community is, indeed, imperative. We\r\nneed to actively engage in resolving the issues facing\r\nthe world today by demonstrating respect for and\r\nunderstanding of cultures and civilizations other than\r\nour own. Tolerance, appreciation for different cultures\r\nand religious beliefs, harmony and plurality should\r\nfind their rightful place in the set of principles that\r\nshape our respective societies.\r\nOur globalizing world increasingly compels our\r\nsocieties to become more interdependent. We are of the\r\nview that mutual understanding and dialogue across\r\ncultures and civilizations should be one of the\r\nfundamental elements in inter-societal exchanges if we\r\nare to realize the ultimate goal of common peace and\r\nprogress. In that connection, we very much appreciate\r\nthe encouragement expressed by other delegations\r\ntoday aimed at furthering cross-cultural and cross-\r\ncivilizational undertakings towards that goal. We were\r\nalso pleased to observe that this significant issue was\r\nduly addressed in the United Nations summit outcome\r\ndocument. Turkeys full support for the matter is\r\nevidenced by our sponsorship of the draft resolution on\r\nthis topic (A/60/L.6).\r\nFor its part, Turkey consistently tries to build a\r\nculture of reconciliation and compromise in its own\r\nregion and beyond. The Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference (OIC)-European Union (EU) Joint Forum,\r\nwhich Turkey initiated in 2002, is a testament to our\r\nefforts to promote tolerance, mutual respect,\r\nunderstanding, dialogue and cooperation among\r\ndifferent cultures and religions.\r\nGiven its historical relations and cultural ties to a\r\nwide geographical area, Turkey benefits from the rich\r\nperspective it has cultivated through exchanges that\r\nfacilitate tolerance, harmony and understanding. It is\r\nthat intrinsic value, which Turkey exemplifies, that\r\nmade it a natural partner to Spain in promoting the\r\nAlliance of Civilizations. Originally proposed by\r\nSpanish Prime Minister Zapatero in his address to the\r\nfifty-ninth session of the General Assembly, Turkish\r\nPrime Minister Erdoğan was later invited to co-sponsor\r\nthe initiative early this year. Since then, Turkey and\r\nSpain have been jointly engaged in furthering the\r\ninitiative, which has also been endorsed by the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan.\r\nThe Alliance of Civilizations aims to address\r\nemerging threats emanating from hostile perceptions\r\nthat foment violence across cultures and civilizations\r\n24\r\nA/60/PV.35\r\nand to bring about a committed effort globally,\r\nat the institutional and civil society levels, to bridge\r\ndivides and overcome prejudice, misconceptions,\r\nmisperceptions and polarization within the world\r\ncommunity. As we have all observed, this environment\r\nhas been exploited and exacerbated by extremists in all\r\nsocieties. The initiative could therefore be regarded as\r\na coalition against that trend, as a movement to\r\nadvance mutual respect for religious beliefs and\r\ntraditions and as a reaffirmation of humankind\u0027s\r\nincreasing interdependence in all areas.\r\nThe Alliance of Civilizations is a genuine effort\r\nto prove that the peoples of the world are not divided\r\nalong cultural and religious lines, but bound by\r\nuniversal values that are derived from the foundation\r\nof humankinds collective wisdom, conscience and\r\ndrive for progress. We encourage all Member States to\r\nrespond to that call.\r\nMs. Enkhtsetseg (Mongolia): The words of\r\nSamuel Huntington in 1993 that the clash of\r\ncivilizations will dominate global politics and that the\r\nfault lines between civilizations will be the battle lines\r\nof the future were an ominous forecast of the future.\r\nIndeed, 60 years after the end of the Second World\r\nWar, anti-semitism remains a problem. Racism and\r\nxenophobia are issues with which we are still\r\ngrappling. We are also witnessing the emergence of\r\nsuch new concepts as Islamophobia.\r\nThe question may arise: was Mr. Huntington\r\nperhaps right? The answer to that question must be a\r\nresounding no. The Organization was established to\r\nsave succeeding generations from the scourge of war,\r\nand we the Member States have a responsibility to\r\nensure that that solemn undertaking is upheld. The\r\nUnited Nations has been instrumental in preventing the\r\noutbreak of global war during the past years. We are\r\nconvinced that it is fully equipped to continue doing so\r\nin the future.\r\nThe dialogue among civilizations initiated by\r\nPresident Khatami is a key initiative aimed at helping\r\nus avoid the dark prospect of an all-out clash among\r\ncivilizations. Since its introduction, that concept has\r\nengendered progressively greater interest from Member\r\nStates, including my own country. That noble initiative\r\ngained further strength and weight with the adoption,\r\nin 2001, of resolution 56/6, on the global dialogue\r\namong civilizations. That resolution included a\r\ncomprehensive Programme of Action that has been\r\nvigorously enacted through a host of multifaceted\r\nactivities undertaken by Member States and other\r\nstakeholders, and was reaffirmed by our leaders in the\r\noutcome document of the September summit.\r\nWe live in a world that is both unique and\r\ndiverse. We also live in a world that is increasingly\r\ninterdependent and rapidly changing. Different\r\npeoples, religions, cultures and civilizations are today\r\nengaged in an unprecedented level of interaction and in\r\nan interchange of values, with ideas and events that\r\noriginate in one corner of the world and yet instantly\r\naffect its other parts. That openness and the perceived\r\ndefencelessness in the face of change create a natural\r\nreaction of rejection, distrust and even fear in people,\r\nand lead to attempts to define and protect their identity\r\nthrough exclusion and separation. Yet, the course of\r\nhuman history teaches us that interaction and the\r\npreservation of ones identity are not mutually\r\nexclusive, but rather complementary processes that\r\nallow us to learn the best and leave behind the\r\nobsolete.\r\nHuman civilization reached its current heights\r\nonly through a long process of interaction and\r\ncooperation among nations and peoples with diverse\r\ncultures and traditions. Diversity is therefore the\r\nprerequisite for the continued progressive development\r\nof the human race. It is only by understanding,\r\nrecognizing, respecting and encouraging that diversity\r\nthat a genuine dialogue among civilizations can best be\r\nattained. Diversity is not a threat; it is indeed our\r\nstrength. The breakthrough in information technology\r\ngives us a unique opportunity to promote it on a global\r\nscale.\r\nThe draft resolution under this agenda item that\r\nwe are about to adopt today emphasizes that the real\r\nobject of the dialogue among civilizations are the\r\nhearts and minds of the next generation. Indeed,\r\nunlearning intolerance cannot be achieved overnight. It\r\nwill require years of careful and persistent efforts by\r\nall stakeholders, including Governments, international\r\norganizations, civil society, media and academia.\r\nCivilizations do not have clear-cut boundaries\r\nand borders, they flow smoothly into one another. They\r\nare entities that comprise elements of history,\r\ngeography, ethnicity, religion, customs and politics,\r\nand are therefore greatly diversified within themselves.\r\nAn example of that is the great nomadic civilization of\r\nthe Eurasian steppe, of which my country is a part.\r\n25\r\nA/60/PV.35\r\nThat civilization not only encompasses Buddhist\r\ncountries like Mongolia, but also includes\r\npredominantly Muslim and Christian societies. A\r\ndistinct form of world civilization, it has largely\r\nexisted in peaceful symbiosis with sedentary societies\r\nacross Asia and Europe, and has played an important\r\nrole in the development of extensive trade networks\r\nand the creation of large administrative, cultural,\r\nreligious and commercial centres.\r\nNomadic societies and peoples have played a\r\ncrucial role in the interaction between different\r\ncivilizations, as for thousands of years they have\r\nserved as a bridge between world civilizations.\r\nThroughout the history of the world, nomadic\r\ncivilizations have absorbed the influence of others,\r\nboth in the West and the East, and in turn have had a\r\nprofound impact on them. However, the role and\r\ncontribution of nomadic civilizations has, by and large,\r\nreceived little attention to date.\r\nThe rapid advance of globalization poses\r\nchallenges, along with many opportunities, to the\r\npreservation and development of the centuries-old\r\ntraditions and cultures of nomadic peoples. Among\r\nother things, pastoral nomadism permits societies to\r\nexploit the variable and patchy resources of the steppe.\r\nIts mobility allows for the seasonal exploitation of\r\nresources that are not sufficient to sustain human and\r\nherbivore populations throughout the year. The ability\r\nof nomads to adapt to the whims of nature and to live\r\nin harmony with it has produced different techniques\r\nand ways of protecting and using land in a sustained\r\nmanner. That ability is even more useful in view of\r\nsuch environmental threats as deforestation,\r\ndesertification and soil erosion, which affect the\r\nlivelihoods of people and developmental prospects in\r\nmany countries, including nomadic societies.\r\nGuided by the goal of achieving an objective\r\nunderstanding of all civilizations and by the conviction\r\nthat civilizational achievements constitute a collective\r\nheritage of humankind, Mongolia is making every\r\neffort to further expand studies on various aspects of\r\nnomadic civilization, its influence and its interaction\r\nwith others. My Government commends the United\r\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization for its valuable contribution to the\r\nimplementation of the Global Agenda, and particularly\r\nits contribution to the study of nomadic civilization\r\nthrough the work of the International Institute for the\r\nStudy of Nomadic Civilizations, which is located in the\r\ncapital of Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar. Among other things,\r\nthe Institute has organized international conferences on\r\nthe theme Nomadism in Mongolia and its relationship\r\nwith sedentary civilizations: its relevance and\r\nprospects, as well as on Dialogue among cultures\r\nand civilizations: present and perspective of nomadism\r\nin a globalizing era.\r\nMongolia will celebrate the eight hundredth\r\nanniversary of its Statehood next year. We believe that\r\nthat anniversary provides a welcome opportunity to\r\ntrigger renewed interest in nomadic civilization and to\r\nfacilitate the efforts of Member States to preserve and\r\ndevelop nomadic culture and traditions in modern\r\nsociety. We also plan to organize a host of activities,\r\nboth within the country and internationally, to celebrate\r\nthe rich heritage, traditions and culture of nomadic\r\ncivilization. In so doing we will be making our own\r\ncontribution to promoting and facilitating the dialogue\r\namong civilizations.\r\nWith that in mind, at a later date my delegation\r\nwill introduce a draft resolution entitled Eight\r\nhundred years of Mongolian Statehood, whose aim\r\nwill be to promote understanding and recognition of\r\nnomadic civilization within the framework of the\r\nGlobal Agenda for Dialogue among Civilizations. My\r\ndelegation believes that this initiative will command\r\nbroad support on the part of the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Al-Nasser (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): As we\r\nmeet at the mid-point of the 2001-2010 International\r\nDecade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for\r\nthe Children of the World, we are heartened by the\r\ngenesis of a global movement of peaceseekers and\r\npeacebuilders. We applaud the multitude of grass-roots\r\ninitiatives blossoming at mid-decade. We also express\r\nour profound appreciation and gratitude for the\r\nexemplary actions of world leaders, particularly the\r\nPrime Ministers of Spain and Turkey, as well as those\r\nof a considerable number of eminent persons.\r\nAt the midterm of the International Decade for a\r\nCulture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of\r\nthe World, we reaffirm the inextricable nexus among\r\npeace, development and security. We call for increased\r\nand accelerated efforts in the areas of peacebuilding,\r\npeacekeeping, conflict prevention, disarmament,\r\nsustainable development, the promotion of human\r\ndignity and human rights, democracy, the rule of law\r\nand good governance. We commend the many young\r\npeople from different parts of the world who have\r\n26\r\nA/60/PV.35\r\ncollectively contributed to the mid-decade World Civil\r\nSociety report on a culture of peace. We also commend\r\nand express our gratitude to the Secretary-General of\r\nthe United Nations and the Director-General of\r\nUNESCO for launching significant activities and\r\ninitiatives that have contributed substantively to\r\nbuilding bridges of unity and common ground among\r\ncivilizations, religions and societies. The State of Qatar\r\nhas supported their commendable efforts throughout\r\nthe years.\r\nPeace is more than the absence of war: peace is a\r\nprocess and a way of solving problems. It does not rest\r\nin charters, declarations or covenants alone, but lies in\r\nthe hearts and minds of all people. In this era of\r\ncomplex international tensions, converging currents of\r\nglobalization and calls for the clash of civilizations,\r\npeace is our most precious common possession. The\r\narduous work to establish peace is an undertaking for\r\nevery nation and society. To that end, none can be\r\nuncommitted; otherwise posterity will rightly point its\r\nfinger at us all.\r\nFrom the outset, the State of Qatar has been a\r\nfervent supporter of United Nations efforts to foster a\r\nculture of peace and to promote a dialogue among\r\ncivilizations. The State of Qatar has continuously\r\nadvocated the principle of dialogue aimed at deepening\r\nthe scope of understanding and establishing the\r\nfoundations for mutual respect, friendship and\r\ncooperation between countries and societies. That\r\nincentive has become more urgent after the despicable\r\ntragedy of 11 September 2001.\r\nThe Emir of the State of Qatar, His Highness\r\nSheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, and Her Highness\r\nSheikha Mozah bint Nasser Al-Missned, consort of His\r\nHighness the Emir, are among the eminent persons who\r\nbelieve in the common humanity of all and who dream\r\nof a world where we can all live in dignity and\r\nsecurity. Their advocacy, compassion, vision and\r\nconviction have led to multiple successful initiatives to\r\ndeepen the scope of understanding between countries\r\nand societies, particularly between the Muslim and\r\nWestern worlds. The State of Qatar is adamantly\r\nagainst religious bigotry and extremism and\r\ncategorically rejects any identification or association of\r\nterrorism with Islam or any other religion.\r\nAt the global level, the State of Qatar has been a\r\nleading advocate of the need to promote dialogue\r\namong civilizations. Since 2000, it has supported at the\r\nhighest political level all United Nations resolutions\r\ncalling for a culture of peace. We have also supported\r\nthe implementation of the Global Agenda for Dialogue\r\namong Civilizations and its Programme of Action, as\r\nwell as other peace-related resolutions from various\r\nUnited Nations conferences.\r\nIn addition, in other regional and international\r\nforums  such as the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference, the League of Arab States and the Gulf\r\nCooperation Council  we have been keen to promote\r\nmutual tolerance and understanding between and\r\namong nations.\r\nAt the national level, the State of Qatar has taken\r\nconcrete steps to implement the Global Agenda and the\r\nProgramme of Action. Appropriate cultural,\r\neducational and social programmes have been\r\ndeveloped to promote the concepts of peace and\r\ndialogue. In that regard, considerable attention has\r\nbeen given to the activities of local civil society\r\norganizations and non-governmental organizations.\r\nRelevant information intended to foster mutual\r\nunderstanding and recognition among and within\r\nnations has been disseminated widely in national\r\nacademic circles. Moreover, school curricula and\r\ntextbooks have incorporated the culture of tolerance\r\nand respect for culture diversity, while preserving the\r\nvalues and ethos of Qatari society.\r\nThe State of Qatar devotes considerable energy to\r\npromoting a culture of peace through hosting\r\ndialogues, thereby facilitating interaction and\r\nexchanges of values, attitudes and modes of behaviour\r\nconducive to enhancing world peace. Such dialogues\r\nhave focused on the fundamentals of human existence\r\nand have addressed crucial issues, thereby\r\nunderscoring the common goals, principles and\r\ninterests of the community of nations.\r\nThe culture of peace is essentially the cultivation\r\nof the creative potential of men and women to develop\r\nskills, mindsets, values and attitudes for living together\r\nin harmony. The effort to improve the human condition\r\nis not a task for the few; it is a task for all nations and\r\nsocieties. We owe it to our children to consecrate every\r\niota of energy and effort we possess to bequeath a\r\nworld devoid of injustice, prejudice, hatred, extremism,\r\nsubjugation, mistrust and discrimination of all kinds.\r\nWe must not fail our children, who in most instances\r\nare the primary victims of violence. Let us prepare our\r\nchildren for peace by teaching them to be\r\npeacebuilders and to abhor violence and the use of\r\nphysical force to achieve an aim.\r\n27\r\nA/60/PV.35\r\nIn the next half decade, it is incumbent upon\r\nGovernments, the United Nations system and civil\r\nsociety, including religious institutions, to attain inter-\r\ncivilizational understanding on the basis of respect for\r\nall religions and for cultural diversity, in order to\r\nbridge the wide divide that still prevails amidst the\r\nstorms of daily conflict and crisis. We must seize the\r\nvision of a culture of peace to speed progress toward a\r\nbetter world.\r\nThe international community has a moral\r\nresponsibility to improve life on Earth and to promote\r\npeace and tranquillity for its inhabitants. Our work to\r\nbuttress a culture of peace, coupled with wisdom and\r\nadherence to principles, will ultimately determine our\r\ndestiny. We must strengthen the international\r\ncommunitys cultural resources and compassion to\r\ncontribute substantially and work together towards a\r\nculture of peace. The nations of the world must\r\ncontinue to promote dialogue in all areas pertaining to\r\nthe critical issues of peace, development and security,\r\nwhile underscoring the commonality of goals,\r\nprinciples and interests shared by all Member States.\r\nAbove all, we should embrace cultural diversity, rather\r\nthan fear or repress it, in order to engender\r\ninternational cooperation in resolving critical issues.\r\nOrganization of work\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I wish\r\nto make an announcement concerning agenda item 73,\r\nentitled Strengthening of the coordination of\r\nhumanitarian and disaster relief assistance of the\r\nUnited Nations, including special economic\r\nassistance. The President has asked His Excellency\r\nMr. Jean-Marc Hoscheit, Permanent Representative of\r\nLuxembourg to the United Nations, to be the\r\ncoordinator of the informal consultations on draft\r\nresolutions under agenda item 73 and its sub-items (a),\r\n(c), (d) and (e), and he has graciously accepted.\r\nLuxembourg has done this very successfully in the\r\npast. As members will recall, sub-item (b) of agenda\r\nitem 73 has been allocated to the Second Committee.\r\nThe President requests those delegations\r\nintending to submit draft resolutions under agenda item\r\n73 to do so as early as possible, in order to allow time,\r\nif need be, for negotiations with a view to reaching\r\nconsensus on those draft resolutions.\r\nBefore adjourning the meeting, I would like to\r\nthank the interpreters for their understanding, as we\r\nhave exceeded our allotted time by a few minutes.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.10 p.m.\r\n"
