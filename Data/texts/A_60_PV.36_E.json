(Sweden)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Loizaga\r\n(Paraguay), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda items 43 and 42 (continued)\r\nCulture of peace\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/60/201)\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/60/279)\r\nDraft resolutions (A/60/L.4 and A/60/L.5)\r\nGlobal Agenda for Dialogue among Civilizations\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/60/259)\r\nDraft resolution (A/60/L.6)\r\nMr. Wang Guangya (China) (spoke in Chinese):\r\nThe outcome document (resolution 60/1) adopted\r\nrecently at the 2005 world summit reaffirms the\r\nGeneral Assembly’s Global Agenda for Dialogue\r\namong Civilizations and its Programme of Action and\r\nthe Declaration and Programme of Action on a Culture\r\nof Peace; welcomes the Alliance for Civilizations\r\ninitiative announced by the Secretary-General in July\r\nthis year; and calls on countries to take action to\r\npromote a culture of peace and dialogue among\r\ncivilizations at the local, national, regional and\r\ninternational levels. The Chinese delegation believes\r\nthat the outcome document has provided the\r\nOrganization and Member States with a good\r\nopportunity to accelerate the implementation of those\r\ncommitments and initiatives.\r\nThere are nearly 200 countries in the world,\r\nwhich has more than 6 billion people. Despite the\r\ndifferences in their historical backgrounds, social\r\nsystems, developmental levels, cultural traditions and\r\nreligious beliefs, they have all contributed to the\r\ncivilization of humanity. The global diversity and\r\ndifferences of civilizations and cultures should not be\r\nsources for conflict in the world. They should, instead,\r\nprovide the motivation, impetus and springboard for\r\ninternational exchanges and cooperation.\r\nThe expansion of economic globalization has\r\nfurther complicated economic and social problems.\r\nCountries must therefore act in a spirit of openness and\r\nequality, acknowledge the diversity in the world,\r\nstrengthen dialogue and exchanges among\r\ncivilizations, resolve international and regional\r\ndisputes through peaceful means and jointly build a\r\nworld of harmony among all civilizations.\r\nSince the events of 11 September 2001, counter-\r\nterrorism has become the international community’s\r\nmain focus of attention, and many efforts have been\r\nundertaken in that regard. In our counter-terrorist\r\nendeavour, we should give up the practice of\r\nassociating terrorism with any particular civilization or\r\nreligion. Only thus can we truly mobilize the forces of\r\nall countries to fight against terrorism and safeguard\r\nworld peace.\r\n2\r\nA/60/PV.36\r\nWe are pleased to note that, since 2001, the\r\nGlobal Agenda for Dialogue among Civilizations has\r\nbecome an important initiative for deepening mutual\r\nunderstanding among nations. The United Nations, the\r\nrelevant international organizations and Member States\r\nhave carried out study trips, cultural and educational\r\nexchanges and joint scientific research. That has\r\neffectively increased the understanding of other\r\ncultures and religious beliefs among peoples in various\r\ncountries and has promoted a more extensive culture of\r\npeace.\r\nThe reports submitted by the Secretary-General\r\nunder agenda items 42 and 43 affirm the active\r\nengagement of Governments, non-governmental\r\norganizations (NGOs) and academic institutions in the\r\nUnited Nations dialogue among civilizations and in the\r\nculture of peace. They describe valuable contributions\r\nmade by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and\r\nCultural Organization (UNESCO) and put forward new\r\nrecommendations for future work. We would like to\r\nexpress our appreciation for those efforts.\r\nChina has a 5,000-year-old history; the Chinese\r\nculture is a crystallization of long-term exchanges and\r\nblending among all Chinese ethnic cultures and\r\nbetween Chinese and foreign cultures. Diversity,\r\ntolerance and harmony are important features of\r\nChinese culture.\r\nIn recent years, the Chinese Government has\r\nactively responded to United Nations initiatives. It has\r\nhosted quite a few international meetings on dialogue\r\namong civilizations and conducted wide-ranging\r\ncultural exchanges with many countries. China has also\r\nsubmitted its report to the United Nations on\r\nimplementing the Global Agenda for Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations and has actively participated in the\r\ndrafting of the UNESCO convention on cultural\r\ndiversity. These efforts have increased understanding\r\nbetween China and other countries and have played a\r\nvigorous role in promoting economic and social\r\ndevelopment. In future, the Chinese Government will\r\ncontinue to strengthen its cultural exchanges and\r\ndialogues on civilization with other countries and will\r\nmake joint efforts for human progress and world peace\r\nand development.\r\nMr. Savua (Fiji): This year marks the midpoint\r\nof the International Decade for a Culture of Peace. It is\r\ntime to take stock of how much has been achieved and\r\nbalance it against the targets that were set with so\r\nmuch hope over five years ago.\r\nIt is true that, when reviewed, a number of aims\r\nmay not have been realized. It is also true that, in the\r\nthinking of some, the United Nations has reduced its\r\nsupport of certain aspects of the spirit of the culture of\r\npeace. It must be borne in mind, however, that since\r\nthe adoption in 1997 of resolution 52/15 proclaiming\r\n2000 the International Year for the Culture of Peace\r\nand resolution 53/25 in 1998 proclaiming 2001-2010\r\nthe International Decade for a Culture of Peace and\r\nNon-Violence for the Children of the World, the United\r\nNations has had to deal with a number of other\r\nimportant issues and major incidents.\r\nWe have witnessed the destruction of the Twin\r\nTowers, the war in Iraq, fighting in Afghanistan,\r\nfamine in Somalia and ethnic problems in Sudan,\r\namong so many others. So, while United Nations\r\nefforts may be regarded as insufficient, they must be\r\nweighed against the Organization’s ability to deal\r\nadequately with all the issues on its agenda.\r\nWhile we agree with the general thrust of the\r\npoints raised in the civil society report at the midpoint\r\nof the Decade for a Culture for Peace, we must say that\r\none cannot hope to get one’s wishes granted\r\ncompletely. Furthermore, there are other branches of\r\nthe United Nations that are actively pursuing the\r\nrealization of particular issues but are not quite ready\r\nto present reports.\r\nIn this regard, we would like to thank the\r\nDirector General of UNESCO for his report on the\r\nimplementation of resolution 58/11, as transmitted by\r\nthe Secretary-General in document A/60/279 on\r\n19 August 2005. UNESCO launched Manifesto 2000 at\r\nthe beginning of the Decade to create public\r\nawareness. The Manifesto has been signed by\r\n75,845,317 people so far. This figure represents more\r\nthan one per cent of the world’s population. The\r\ninteractive website set up by UNESCO has to date\r\nreceived hits from 1,181 participants to disseminate\r\ninformation. Fiji — and, I am certain, our region —\r\nwelcomes this UNESCO initiative, not only to keep us\r\ninformed but also to reduce to manageable proportions\r\nour often referred-to tyranny of distance.\r\nThe United Nations defines the culture of peace as\r\n“respect for human rights, democracy and\r\ntolerance, the promotion of development,\r\n3\r\nA/60/PV.36\r\neducation for peace, the free flow of information\r\nand the wider participation of women as an\r\nintegral approach to preventing violence and\r\nconflicts, and efforts aimed at the creation of\r\nconditions for peace and its consolidation”.\r\n(resolution 53/25)\r\nThe culture of peace provides us a positive\r\nalternative to the culture of war that has dominated\r\nhuman history up to now. It is a holistic approach that\r\ncan facilitate the integration and synergy of all of the\r\ngreat social movements of our time.\r\nWe have repeated the definition here, so that it\r\nwon’t be confused with other cultural initiatives that\r\nmight have been launched or other peace projects. The\r\nculture of peace is all-embracing, and it behooves us\r\nall to find ways in which we can help. Too often, we\r\ncite size and fiscal difficulties as excuses not to\r\nparticipate, even though others not so well off have\r\nmade commendable efforts towards this worthwhile\r\neffort on the part of our young people. A prayer costs\r\nnothing; yet, how many prayer breakfasts have we\r\nattended where one sentence might mention our young\r\npeople and their attempts to inculcate a culture of\r\npeace in our daily lives? If this sounds simple, then it\r\nis our contention that it was designed to be simple.\r\nNone of the youth involved have drafted a statement\r\nfor the General Assembly or its Main Committees.\r\nTheir minds are clear and their consciences as yet\r\nunfettered by the worries of the world, but they want to\r\nhelp.\r\nUNESCO’s education objective activities have\r\nbeen focused on education for peace, human rights and\r\nlinguistic diversity. The UNESCO education sector\r\nincludes the development of national plans and\r\nprogrammes on human rights education through\r\nnational and subregional projects. The main objective\r\nof these activities has been to help Member States\r\nmodify legislation and practices in their educational\r\npolicies to ensure that values such as human rights,\r\npeace, democratic participation, tolerance, non-\r\nviolence and intercultural understanding are included\r\nin curricula, and to ensure that the corresponding\r\neducational processes are consistent with the teaching\r\nof such values, taking into account the socio-cultural\r\nbackground of each country.\r\nFiji welcomes the draft convention on the\r\nprotection and promotion of the diversity of cultural\r\nexpression. We believe that this draft convention fits\r\nhand in glove with the culture of peace, and we hope\r\nthat it will be adopted unanimously. This is one of the\r\nreasons we presented a candidate for the UNESCO\r\nExecutive Board, who was elected last week.\r\nOther organs of the United Nations are also\r\ninvolved in the pursuit of peace, UNICEF being one of\r\nthem. They have to be commended for their\r\ncommitment and sincere attempts to make a difference.\r\nThe International Labour Organization’s contribution\r\nto a culture of peace and non-violence has been its\r\nintervention in the field of prevention and\r\nrehabilitation of children affected by war, implemented\r\nwithin the framework of the International Programme\r\non the Elimination of Child Labour.\r\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has for\r\nthe last 10 years devoted much attention to addressing\r\nviolence as a major public health problem. In October\r\n2002, WHO launched a World Report on Violence and\r\nHealth, which described the extent of violence as a\r\nglobal public health problem. It set out a prevention\r\nstrategy and made nine recommendations that are the\r\nfoundation of WHO’s violence prevention work.\r\nIn 2002, the Food and Agriculture Organization\r\nof the United Nations, in collaboration with UNESCO,\r\nlaunched the “Education for All” Initiative as part of\r\nthe follow-up to the World Summit on Social\r\nDevelopment. The Initiative seeks to use education as a\r\nmeans of empowering rural people to become full\r\nactors, making them less vulnerable to conflict and\r\nmore resilient to recover from conflict. The United\r\nNations University organized two major research\r\nprojects that are tied exclusively to the International\r\nDecade, the broad objective of which is to promote\r\nknowledge of the impact of armed conflict on children\r\nand the challenges involved in trying to improve their\r\nsituation.\r\nThere is little doubt that the culture of peace is an\r\nideal worthy of pursuit. It will take time for all aspects\r\nof the requirements and demands it poses to be\r\nrealized. Some patience has to be exercised.\r\nAcceptance of the efforts exerted thus far by the United\r\nNations is for the good of all. Demanding a lot more\r\nwill be more destructive than constructive. A culture of\r\npeace is an ideal that requires a lot of deep thought to\r\nbe fully absorbed and to replace current thinking.\r\nHowever, like all new innovative ideas, time is a prime\r\nrequirement for shifting the paradigm.\r\n4\r\nA/60/PV.36\r\nMr. Meyer (Brazil): My delegation would like to\r\nthank the Secretary-General for the preparation of the\r\nreports before the General Assembly.\r\nBrazil is a strong supporter of the Declaration and\r\nProgramme of Action on a Culture of Peace. The\r\nInternational Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-\r\nviolence for the Children of the World has generated,\r\nand continues to generate, great interest in Brazil. At\r\nall levels of Government, in civil society and in the\r\nmedia, Brazil, as a traditionally peace-loving country,\r\nis increasingly committed to the promotion of a culture\r\nof peace through the promotion of democracy; human\r\nrights and the elimination of racism, xenophobia and\r\nrelated intolerance; gender equality and sustainable\r\nsocial and economic development, as well as the\r\neradication of hunger, poverty and illiteracy. In our\r\nview, it has now become quite clear that, given the\r\nglobal revolution in information, domestic concerns\r\nand foreign policy and security considerations should\r\nbe able to interact positively in the process of creating\r\na better life for all.\r\nNearly 100 civil-society actors — including\r\nuniversities, schools, non-governmental organizations\r\n(NGOs) and the private sector — are currently\r\ninvolved in 13 projects that are directly linked to the\r\nculture of peace. Over 15 million Brazilians have\r\nsigned the 2000 Manifesto launched by UNESCO.\r\nVarious programmes on the culture of peace have been\r\ndeveloped in Brazil with the cooperation of UNESCO.\r\nAmong them, seven of our states have already adopted\r\nthe programme entitled “Making room: education and\r\nculture for peace”, which outlines a strategy for\r\nopening schools on weekends for activities in the fields\r\nof sport, art, culture and leisure.\r\nMoreover, there is great convergence between the\r\nprinciples established in the Declaration and\r\nProgramme of Action on a Culture of Peace and\r\nBrazil’s 2004 to 2007 multi-year strategic plan, entitled\r\n“Brazil for all”. That plan identifies three major goals,\r\nnamely, promoting social inclusion and reducing social\r\ninequality; achieving environmentally sustainable\r\ngrowth aimed at generating employment and income\r\nand reducing regional inequalities; and promoting and\r\nexpanding citizenship and democracy.\r\nWith regard to education, Brazil’s national human\r\nrights education programme provides a strong\r\nframework for the promotion of education that is\r\nfundamentally in line with the principles of the culture\r\nof peace. The plan outlines actions to promote a culture\r\nof respect for fundamental human rights through the\r\nparticipation of different groups from civil society and\r\nthe institutions of the legal and justice systems. The\r\nprogramme is based on the belief that a situation of\r\npersistent violations can only be altered by fostering\r\ngenerations of citizens who are able to contribute to the\r\nstrengthening of the rule of law and the culture of\r\npeace, who are conscious of their rights and of the\r\nmeans at their disposal for the protection of those\r\nrights and who are imbued with respect for plurality\r\nand cultural, sexual, ethnic, gender and religious\r\ndiversity.\r\nAlso in line with the culture of peace is Brazil’s\r\nhandbook on religious diversity and human rights,\r\nwhich was issued after a process of consultations with\r\nreligious leaders carried out over the course of nearly a\r\nyear and a half. The handbook is based on the\r\nconviction that Brazil’s plurality of races and cultures,\r\nas well as its religious freedom, makes it unique. It\r\nacknowledges, however, the persistence of some\r\nprejudice, particularly with regard to Afro-Brazilian,\r\nindigenous and Roma religious manifestations. It also\r\nstates clearly that such prejudice is absolutely\r\nunacceptable and incompatible with Brazil’s\r\ncommitment to a culture of peace.\r\nFinally, I would like to refer to the programme\r\nentitled “Brazil without homophobia”, our national\r\nprogramme to combat violence and discrimination\r\nagainst gay, lesbian, transgender and bisexual persons,\r\nas well as to promote citizenship among homosexuals.\r\nThe programme outlines actions to strengthen public\r\nand non-governmental institutions involved in\r\npromoting citizenship among homosexuals and\r\ncombating homophobia, build capacity among\r\nprofessionals and representatives of the homosexual\r\nmovement active in the promotion of human rights,\r\ndisseminate information on rights and the promotion of\r\nself-esteem among homosexuals and promote the filing\r\nof complaints on violations of the human rights of gay,\r\nlesbian, transgender and bisexual persons.\r\nIt is Brazil’s firm belief that the promotion of a\r\nculture of peace, to which we are all committed, must\r\ncontain all the elements I have mentioned. A\r\ncomprehensive culture of peace is an essential goal of\r\nour social and economic development.\r\nMr. Summaida’ie (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): My\r\ndelegation would like to join in the debate on agenda\r\n5\r\nA/60/PV.36\r\nitems 43 and 42 on a culture of peace and the dialogue\r\namong civilizations. Consideration of those two items\r\nis of increasing importance today, first and foremost\r\nbecause of the rapid pace of political, economic and\r\ncultural change and scientific advances. Such\r\ntransformations are the result of the unprecedented\r\ndevelopment of informatics and communications\r\ntechnology, which — whether we like it or not — will\r\nlead to coexistence in abstract and concrete terms.\r\nWe need a serious dialogue among civilizations in\r\norder to strengthen the culture of peace. There is a\r\ncertain arrogant mindset, however, that seeks to impose\r\nits own culture by trying to marginalize other cultures,\r\nand that in turn has resulted in a movement rejecting\r\nthat approach. Unfortunately, however, that movement\r\nis marked by a tendency to look to the past. That can\r\nlead only to conflict among civilizations. Let us hope\r\nthat it is only a temporary trend, since it runs counter\r\nto the fervent desire of humankind for peaceful\r\ncoexistence. We must not move backwards.\r\nThe dialogue among civilizations has been on the\r\nagenda of the General Assembly since 1998, and since\r\nthe fifty-sixth session in 2001. All countries,\r\nspecialized agencies of the United Nations and civil\r\nsociety organizations are called upon to take part in\r\nactivities to promote a dialogue among cultures. By\r\nfocusing on the importance of establishing peace,\r\nsecurity and stability worldwide, the dialogue among\r\ncivilizations has increasingly become a subject of\r\npopular and realistic discussion, and is no longer a\r\npurely philosophical concept. It promotes integration\r\nand has been widely accepted by various peoples,\r\nirrespective of their cultural and religious backgrounds.\r\nA small minority is trying to counter that\r\npromising trend by attempting to exploit religion for\r\npurely political ends and to marginalize it by engaging\r\nin terrorist acts that have claimed thousands of\r\ninnocent civilian lives. Such actions do not have a\r\nplace in a tolerant society or a society that accepts\r\nchange. We must therefore put a stop to such practices.\r\nWe must stop all attempts to cause chaos and\r\ndestruction. Peoples throughout the world are called\r\nupon to counter such acts, for terrorism knows no\r\nreligion or nationality and has no homeland. As a\r\nresult, it is divorced from everything that has to do\r\nwith human civilization.\r\nIf the dialogue among civilizations is to be taken\r\nseriously, it must be based upon principles of\r\ndemocracy, freedom and justice with a view to\r\nstrengthening the culture of peace. Those factors\r\nshould have a positive impact on relationships between\r\ncountries in terms of their various activities and the\r\nvarious aspects of their political, economic, cultural\r\nand scientific life.\r\nGiven the growing interdependence among all the\r\ncountries and peoples of the world, no country,\r\nhowever powerful, can isolate itself from other\r\ncountries. Humankind occupies a common domain that\r\nincludes all civilizations. It is therefore only natural\r\nthat genuine values of dialogue among cultures and\r\ncivilizations should be strengthened considerably in\r\norder to enhance the culture of peace and promote\r\ngreater understanding among religions and cultures so\r\nthat harmony and cooperation can reign.\r\nAll civilizations are called upon to reject all\r\nnegative practices in the quest for development and\r\nprogress. We must do away with any sense of\r\nsupremacy or pre-eminence. Civilizations that have\r\nmade only limited progress to date in technology\r\nshould not fall prey to feelings of inferiority. The path\r\nmust be open to all human societies so that they can\r\nadapt to global change, which requires cooperation and\r\ntrue interdependence.\r\nThus, we all have the obligation to accept others\r\nand not reject them because of religious belief, lifestyle\r\nor cultural background. Religion should not be used as\r\na pretext to marginalize or exclude others. We need to\r\nensure that a culture of tolerance prevails, because hot\r\nspots of tension can emerge where extremism exists.\r\nThe United Nations system plays a leading role in\r\nthe dialogue among civilizations because of its\r\ndiversity. In that context, the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\r\n(UNESCO) should play a key role, given the nature of\r\nits activities. We thank UNESCO for its efforts; we are\r\nfully confident that its medium-term strategy for 2002-\r\n2007, which takes into account the dialogue among\r\ncivilizations, will play a successful role in making the\r\ndialogue a reality.\r\nMr. Neil (Jamaica): The Charter of the United\r\nNations enjoins us, as Member States, to promote\r\nfriendly relations based on peace and cooperation.\r\nInternational mechanisms to promote those objectives\r\nhave their proper place and functions, seeking to\r\nregulate relations between States through the adoption\r\nof rules and norms of international law and through the\r\n6\r\nA/60/PV.36\r\noperation of mechanisms for conflict resolution and the\r\npeaceful settlement of disputes. But all that may not be\r\nenough if we are to succeed in saving succeeding\r\ngenerations from the scourge of war.\r\nIn their daily lives, people can play an important\r\nrole in the advancement of global harmony,\r\nunderstanding and peaceful relations. The promotion of\r\na culture of peace in all nations is essential in the light\r\nof our increased awareness of the potential for conflict\r\nin a diverse world with often conflicting interests.\r\nAt the Second South Summit of the Group of 77\r\nand China, held in Qatar in June, heads of State or\r\nGovernment adopted the Doha Declaration, in which\r\nleaders recognized that respect for religious and\r\ncultural diversity in an increasingly globalized world\r\ncontributes to international cooperation, promotes\r\nenhanced dialogue among religions, cultures and\r\ncivilizations and helps to create an environment\r\nconducive to the exchange of human experience.\r\nThe global environment is one of diversity in\r\nculture, religion, political system and economic\r\nconditions. A process of deepening interdependence\r\nthrough increased communication and interchange\r\namong nations is taking place, especially within the\r\nprocess of globalization. That is a significant reality of\r\nour time. The greater the degree of contact, the greater\r\nthe need for promoting ideals of tolerance and\r\nunderstanding of differences. One of the dangers of\r\nglobalization is a tendency towards homogenization\r\nand the imposition of the cultural norms and standards\r\nof the strong, who have power and influence over those\r\nwho are weak. Tensions will arise from such\r\ninteractions. That danger can be averted by cultivating\r\nvalues that promote tolerance and respect for\r\npluralism. All peoples have the right to live their lives\r\nin accordance with the principle of self-determination\r\nand the preservation of their cultural heritage.\r\nIn promoting a culture of tolerance and the ideal\r\nof peace, various sectors have an important role to\r\nplay.\r\nThe first is the role of national institutions in the\r\npromotion of peaceful relations and the avoidance of\r\nconflict. Militarism, the development of sophisticated\r\narmaments and the glorification of military exploits\r\nundermine the inculcation of values of peace and non-\r\nviolence in the process of socialization. School\r\ncurricula at all levels should endeavour to provide\r\nguidance on the values of non-violence, tolerance and\r\nrespect for diversity and the importance of peaceful\r\nmethods of conflict resolution. Nowhere is it more\r\nimportant to promote those values and attitudes than\r\namong youth. That is the starting point for ensuring\r\nthat non-violence is promoted in all our societies.\r\nThe second element is the role of civil society,\r\nwhich has a vital role to play in ensuring success in our\r\noverall effort. Peace movements and organizations, in\r\ntheir opposition to war, have played a significant role\r\nin the mobilization of public opinion. It is important\r\nthat they be encouraged to build national and\r\ninternational coalitions and to exert influence, through\r\nthe democratic process, on policies and actions of\r\nGovernments in favour of peace.\r\nThe third element is the significant role of\r\ninternational and national media outlets in exercising\r\ngreater responsibility in supporting the values of peace\r\nand cooperation among States. Too often, media\r\npresentations have demonstrated a tendency to\r\nhighlight materials that generate patriotic fervour and\r\nencourage the resort to the use of force. Instead, there\r\nis need to give exposure to the horrors of war and civil\r\nconflict, which should persuade leaders and\r\npolicymakers to look for peaceful solutions and avoid\r\nthe military option. Also important is a reduction of the\r\nlevel of violence that is promoted in the entertainment\r\nindustry, which influences young minds. It is important\r\nnot to glorify or glamorize military exploits or violent\r\nconduct.\r\nThe fourth element is the work done by the\r\nUnited Nations system, in particular the work done by\r\nUNESCO in promoting the Programme of Action of\r\nthe International Decade for a Culture of Peace and\r\nNon-Violence for the Children of the World, 2001-\r\n2010. We welcome the information provided in the\r\nUNESCO report on the midterm global review of the\r\nInternational Decade (A/60/279), which outlines\r\nactivities pursued in various agencies under the\r\nleadership of UNESCO. We are of the view that there\r\nis still considerable room for further work. Greater\r\npublicity needs to be given to the Programme through\r\nthe Department of Public Information, and further\r\nefforts are needed to establish networks of relevant\r\ncivil society organizations to generate greater\r\nawareness. There is need for further mobilization of\r\nhuman and material resources at all levels for activities\r\nthat promote the various aspects of a culture of peace.\r\n7\r\nA/60/PV.36\r\nJamaica is doing its part through its programmes\r\nin schools to promote a culture of peace and non-\r\nviolence. The Jamaican Schools Improvement Peace\r\nProgramme is one recent initiative. It does not use a\r\npre-designed programme. The aim is for each school,\r\nin conjunction with the community, to assess its own\r\nneeds and to conceive and build its own peace\r\nprogramme. Seven schools have been participating in\r\nthat initiative under the auspices of the Ministry of\r\nEducation, Youth and Culture. Since 1994, in\r\ncooperation with the United Nations Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization, there has been an\r\nongoing school programme on the subject of peace that\r\npromotes the inculcation of the values of peace and\r\nnon-violence among our young people.\r\nProgress over the next five years will require the\r\nfull involvement of national Governments, civil society\r\nand the mass media to support the Global Campaign.\r\nWe continue to encourage the United Nations to play a\r\ncentral role in coordinating programmes and\r\nsupporting initiatives at the national level.\r\nWe have also studied the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the Global Agenda for Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations (A/60/259). The goals of that initiative to\r\npromote greater understanding among civilizations are\r\nof vital importance in the world today. Respect for\r\ndiversity and an understanding that no civilization can\r\nclaim superiority over others in values and\r\nachievements is an essential starting point for that\r\nglobal dialogue.\r\nIt is clear from reading the report that further\r\nsteps need to be taken to advance the dialogue. Some\r\nof the ideas in the Secretary-General’s report are\r\nuseful, particularly in drawing attention to activities\r\nthat can be pursued at the local level, where in many\r\nsocieties there are microcosms of different\r\ncivilizations. That is a good approach, and will\r\ncontribute to the success of the global dialogue.\r\nOur delegation has some reservations on some of\r\nthe ideas contained in the Secretary-General’s report.\r\nIn paragraph 16 of the report, it is suggested that the\r\nglobal dialogue is a response to terrorism. We have\r\ndoubts about that analysis. We believe it is preferable\r\nto emphasize the interdependence of the global\r\ncommunity, which brings about greater contact\r\nbetween diverse cultures and peoples.\r\nAs this process expands, it becomes more\r\nimportant to eliminate intolerance, extremism,\r\npolarization, enmity and conflict. The understanding\r\nand appreciation of the richness of diversity and the\r\npositive dimensions of all civilizations should be\r\npromoted in all societies. Jamaica will continue to\r\nsupport the global dialogue as part of the overall goal\r\nof strengthening the culture for peace.\r\nMrs. Laohaphan (Thailand): Let me begin by\r\nthanking the Secretary-General for his reports on the\r\npromotion of interreligious dialogue (A/60/201) and\r\nthe Global Agenda for Dialogue among Civilizations\r\n(A/60/259). I also wish to thank UNESCO for\r\nproviding us with an extensive report on the midterm\r\nglobal review of the International Decade for a Culture\r\nof Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the\r\nWorld, 2001-1010 (A/60/279), as well as for having\r\nundertaken numerous initiatives in recent years to\r\npromote the Decade and the Global Agenda.\r\nManifesto 2000, which has been signed by over\r\n75 million people worldwide, is a truly commendable\r\ninitiative, and should be continued. Each and every one\r\nof us should serve as a messenger of peace and as a\r\ngoodwill ambassador. For that reason, my delegation\r\nwishes to express our appreciation to civil society for\r\nengaging so actively in promoting the Decade and the\r\nGlobal Agenda.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the report on the\r\ncontributions by almost 700 civil-society organizations\r\nfrom over 100 countries, as appears in the annex to\r\nUNESCO’s report (A/60/279). We do recognize that\r\nGovernments and civil society, including non-\r\ngovernmental organizations (NGOs) and the private\r\nsector, need to continue to work together closely to\r\nmaintain the momentum of the Decade until its\r\ncompletion in 2010.\r\nThailand is supportive of many international\r\ninitiatives in support of the culture of peace and the\r\nGlobal Agenda for Dialogue among Civilizations. We\r\nare part of the Alliance of Civilizations, initiated by\r\nSpain and Turkey and announced in July 2005.\r\nThailand is also part of the interfaith dialogue initiated\r\nby the Philippines, which held its summit at the\r\nGeneral Assembly in September. We are traditional\r\nsponsors of the relevant draft resolutions submitted\r\nunder these agenda items. We will continue to support\r\nall initiatives and efforts towards those ends.\r\nGiven the prevailing state of violence in the\r\nworld, we do need more such initiatives, and we need\r\nto spread the message of peace and understanding as\r\n8\r\nA/60/PV.36\r\nfar as we can. We need to put those words of goodwill\r\ninto practice, and we need to make peace an integral\r\npart of or lives. Each individual, family and\r\ncommunity must serve as a building block for global\r\npeace. Peace is not an ultimate idealistic end. Peace is\r\na process. Peace is not merely the state of the absence\r\nof violence. Peace is about human security. It is about\r\nfreedom to live free from want and fear, and about\r\nliving in dignity. We need to create not only a culture\r\nof peace but an enabling environment for peace. If we\r\nlive in the absence of violence but with an empty\r\nstomach, we will eventually return to conflicts. If we\r\nlive with the absence of violence today but with\r\nmistrust for each other, that will lead to conflicts\r\ntomorrow. Peace is not a state frozen in time. We need\r\nto continually cultivate and foster it.\r\nCan we really say to ourselves that any country is\r\ntruly living in peace today? The world has become\r\nvery interdependent. As members of the global family\r\nwe are all vulnerable to violence and conflicts. On a\r\nglobal scale, we are living in daily risk of terrorist\r\nattacks. On a smaller scale, we are living in\r\ncommunities prone to conflicts. What factors\r\ncontribute to depriving us of peace? Let me cite just\r\nthree main factors: anger, greed and wrong thinking.\r\nAnger is the most obvious factor for, and\r\nmanifestation of, violence and conflict. On the\r\nideological side, we need love, compassion and\r\nunderstanding to overcome anger. We need to think of\r\nothers as members of our kin, and we need forgiveness.\r\nHas history not taught us that violence will only breed\r\nmore violence? We need to realize that we are all in\r\nthis together. No person, society or country will be safe\r\nif others are living in abject poverty and conflict. No\r\narms or weapons will ever suffice to overcome human\r\nanger. To create a culture of peace, we need education\r\nthat enhances understanding and fosters respect for\r\ndiversity and differences. We also need to analyse\r\nfactors that breed anger in many societies — such as\r\nmarginalization, a sense of powerlessness and a\r\nperception that local traditions and identities are being\r\nattacked by the globalization process — so that we can\r\neffectively address them at an early stage.\r\nGreed is another factor that undermines peace.\r\nGreed manifests itself in the form of competition for,\r\nand exploitation of, wealth and resources. That has led\r\nto conflicts everywhere in the world. Injustice is a\r\nfertile ground for breeding violence. In Africa,\r\ncompetition for natural resources is one of the main\r\nfactors for the conflicts that have been plaguing the\r\ncontinent. Unjust economic competition and business\r\nrivalries, in all of their sophisticated forms, can also\r\nproduce breeding grounds for mistrust and conflicts\r\namong nations.\r\nIn mentioning greed and exploitation, my\r\ndelegation would like to highlight one fact: we must\r\nlive in peace not only with one another, but also with\r\nnature and the environment. To ensure sustainable\r\npeace, we must respect the environment. If we live\r\nwithout sufficiently caring for our environment, we\r\nwill find ourselves in a very perilous situation one day.\r\nToday, the world is beginning to show many signs of\r\nweariness, with the increasing incidence of natural\r\ndisasters — including the tsunami in the Indian Ocean,\r\nHurricanes Ivan, Emily and Katrina, the mudslide in\r\nGuatemala and the earthquakes in Pakistan and\r\nIndia — and the consequent tragic losses of lives. Even\r\nif we can live with our neighbours without conflict, we\r\nfind ourselves vulnerable to natural risks. We need to\r\nrecognize the butterfly effect: what we do in our very\r\nown homes will affect our brothers and sisters in a\r\ndistant corner of the world. To cultivate a culture of\r\npeace, then, is not only to do away with conflict, anger\r\nand hatred, but also to stress the need to lessen — if\r\nnot eliminate — our greed and to instil a sense of\r\nresponsibility in all of us to respect and protect Mother\r\nNature.\r\nOne other factor that seriously threatens peace\r\neverywhere is wrong thinking. We should begin\r\nengaging in right thinking — the idea that, despite our\r\ndifferences and diversity, we can all live together in\r\npeace and harmony. We must learn to make room for\r\ncompromise. We might say that we do not choose to\r\nlive with people from another country whose religion\r\nis very different from ours, whose skin is of another\r\ncolour and whose thinking we do not share. But do we\r\nreally have any choice? Like it or not, we are bound\r\ntogether by humanity. We are all in this boat together,\r\nand we must recognize that fact and try to do our best\r\nto live together in peace and harmony.\r\nOf course, we need tools to assist us in\r\nrecognizing that fact. Governments must ensure that\r\neducation, both formal and informal, at all levels will\r\nlend itself to creating understanding, tolerance and\r\nrespect for diversity. History should be written to\r\nrecord facts and to provide useful lessons so as not to\r\nrepeat itself. We must make conscientious efforts to do\r\n9\r\nA/60/PV.36\r\naway with wrong perceptions, misunderstandings and\r\nignorance.\r\nChildren and young people from various cultures\r\nshould be encouraged to meet and exchange their\r\nviews and experiences. Bringing together children and\r\nyoung people from countries engaged in armed conflict\r\nand enabling them to understand each other’s worlds is\r\na step forward in creating peace over the long term.\r\nTeaching children about the cost of violence and\r\nconflict can also be an investment in peace.\r\nThe use of media can be of tremendous value in\r\ncultivating a culture of peace and dialogue among\r\ncivilizations. The media must be responsible and must\r\nuphold ethical standards in reporting. The\r\ncommunication and advertising industries must think\r\nnot only in terms of profits, but also in terms of social\r\nimpacts. The incitement of hatred and stereotyping\r\nmust be done away with altogether. We should think\r\ntwice about the use of video games with simulated\r\nscenes of violence among children. Indeed, we should\r\nnot allow ourselves to become accustomed to violence.\r\nParents should be responsible not only towards their\r\nchildren, but towards society. Governments must work\r\nwith parents to provide an environment in which\r\nchildren can grow up into responsible citizens.\r\nEducation, work and daily life must have the sole\r\npurpose of peace.\r\nAt the September summit, our leaders recognized\r\nthe linkages among development, peace and security\r\nand human rights. That is not simply a political\r\nmessage intended for a lofty level of discourse; it is a\r\nworking philosophy that needs to be put into practice.\r\nIn our future initiatives and activities to promote a\r\nculture of peace and the Global Agenda for Dialogue\r\namong Civilizations, we need to reflect on the critical\r\nlinkages among development, peace and security and\r\nhuman rights. Peace will need to be cultivated in a\r\nholistic manner, both in terms of ideology and of real\r\npractice, both in our minds and on the ground.\r\nIn that regard, my delegation supports the various\r\nrecommendations of UNESCO contained in document\r\nA/60/279, which seek, among others, to develop\r\ncoordination mechanisms at the international, regional\r\nand national levels to strengthen cooperation among all\r\nrelevant actors — the United Nations system, Member\r\nStates, civil society organizations and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations; to reinforce more\r\nexplicitly the links with other international decades or\r\nyears, such as the Decade of Education for Sustainable\r\nDevelopment — 2005-2014 and the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals; to develop communication and\r\ninformation tools that will perpetuate the global\r\nmomentum for the International Decade for a Culture\r\nof Peace and the Global Agenda for Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations; and to encourage the mass media at the\r\ninternational and national levels to support a culture of\r\npeace and dialogue among civilizations.\r\nPeace is a process. Peace is multidimensional and\r\nmust be cultivated and fostered in a comprehensive\r\nmanner. Each and every one of us can be a messenger\r\nof peace. My delegation hopes that, in a few years’\r\ntime, it can look back upon the completion of the\r\nDecade and see that our world has become safer from\r\nviolence and conflicts, from terrorist attacks and\r\nnatural disasters and from other threats. We do not\r\nhave to look elsewhere; we must look to ourselves. We\r\nmust be kind to our neighbours and responsible\r\ntowards Mother Nature. A culture of peace will not\r\nbegin elsewhere; it will begin with us.\r\nMr. Martínez (El Salvador) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nThe Government of the Republic of El Salvador is\r\nconvinced of the need to consider the subject of a\r\nculture of peace at this plenary meeting, bearing in\r\nmind the reaffirmation of the Declaration and\r\nProgramme of Action on a Culture of Peace and the\r\nWorld Programme of Action for a Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations and its Programme of Action, contained\r\nin the outcome document (resolution 60/1) of the 2005\r\nworld summit.\r\nEl Salvador welcomes the midterm global review\r\nof the International Decade for a Culture of Peace and\r\nNon-Violence for the Children of the World, 2001-\r\n2010 (A/60/279). The report sets out guidelines for\r\nevaluating the various initiatives in this area launched\r\nby Governments, civil society, international\r\norganizations and the United Nations system. In\r\naddition, it enables us to consider the need to more\r\nclosely link the progress made in implementing the\r\nMillennium Development Goals with the objectives\r\nestablished for the International Decade for a Culture\r\nof Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the\r\nWorld, 2001-2010. In that context, it is important to\r\nstress that the Declaration and Programme of Action on\r\na Culture of Peace constitute a broad and\r\ncomprehensive framework for promoting and\r\nconsolidating a culture of peace at the national and\r\ninternational levels.\r\n10\r\nA/60/PV.36\r\nAs we have recognized on various occasions,\r\npeace is not only the absence of conflict; it also entails\r\na conscious effort of creation and empowerment in the\r\nminds of human beings. The concept of a culture of\r\npeace is closely linked to dialogue and an alliance\r\namong civilizations. We have recognized that all\r\ncultures and civilizations stand on an equal footing and\r\nthat dialogue must be based on shared values and\r\nprinciples promoted by a culture of peace: inter alia,\r\ntolerance, respect for others, mutual understanding,\r\nrespect for cultural diversity and support for non-\r\nviolence and the principles of peaceful coexistence. In\r\nthat context, the Government of El Salvador reaffirms\r\nits support for the Alliance of Civilizations initiative\r\nannounced by the Secretary-General on 14 July 2005\r\nand promoted by Spain and Turkey, among other\r\ncountries.\r\nIn the report of the High-level Panel on Threats,\r\nChallenges and Change, entitled “A more secure world:\r\nour shared responsibility” (A/59/565), it is made clear\r\nthat the very concept of the United Nations in 1945\r\nwas a response to the collective desire to build a\r\nculture of peace. Moreover, the main challenge of the\r\ntwenty-first century is to expand and place in context\r\nthe meaning of collective security, together with all the\r\nresponsibilities, commitments, strategies and\r\ninstitutions required for the establishment of an\r\neffective, efficient and equitable collective security\r\nsystem.\r\nSupport for a culture of peace and for dialogue\r\namong cultures and civilizations is a substantial part of\r\nthat effort; indeed, globalization and the emergence of\r\nnew threats and challenges to humanity require such\r\nsupport. Suffice it to recall that new information\r\ntechnologies, the greater level of regional integration\r\nand the dynamic flows of national and international\r\nmigration enable people from all over the world to get\r\nto know each other, talk about their differences and\r\nexchange ideas, knowledge and values.\r\nIn that context, my Government reaffirms its\r\ncommitment to and recognition of the right to peace as\r\none of the fundamental pillars of the ideology of\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms. It is a third-\r\ngeneration right that this Assembly recognized in\r\nresolution 39/11 of 12 November 1984, and it was\r\nreaffirmed by the States members of the Organization\r\nof American States (OAS) in the Reaffirmation of\r\nCaracas, when we commemorated the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the adoption of the OAS Charter.\r\nWe recognize the fundamental role of education\r\nin building and consolidating a culture of peace. In that\r\nrespect, we welcome the efforts of the United Nations\r\nsystem — in particular, UNESCO — in strengthening\r\ntheir activities for education for peace, human rights\r\nand linguistic diversity, as well as technical\r\ncooperation efforts with Member States to complement\r\nnational action. We agree on the need to create\r\nmachinery to coordinate at every level, in order to\r\nintensify cooperation among all relevant actors in the\r\npromotion and consolidation of a culture of peace.\r\nAllow me to conclude by reaffirming the political\r\nwill of El Salvador regarding the promotion and\r\nconsolidation of a culture of peace, as well as the need\r\nto achieve the proposals of the International Decade for\r\na Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children\r\nof the World, 2001-2010.\r\nMr. Laassel (Morocco) (spoke in French): My\r\nstatement will address agenda item 42 on the Global\r\nAgenda for Dialogue among Civilizations, and agenda\r\nitem 43 on a culture of peace. My delegation takes this\r\nopportunity to thank the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, for his note on the Midterm global review of\r\nthe International Decade for a Culture of Peace and\r\nNon-Violence for the Children of the World, 2001-\r\n2010 (A/60/279) and his reports on the state of the\r\nGlobal Agenda for Dialogue Among Civilizations\r\n(A/60/259) and the promotion of interreligious\r\ndialogue (A/60/201).\r\nThe promotion of interreligious dialogue and\r\ndialogue among civilizations are, in our point of view,\r\ntwo components of the same action to fight\r\nobscurantism and extremism of all types. To be sure,\r\ncommunication is the sole means to understand others.\r\nSuch understanding guarantees tolerance, which in turn\r\ngenerates respect — a key factor for peaceful\r\ncoexistence among peoples, religions and civilizations.\r\nFrom that standpoint, we should therefore\r\nencourage the efforts of UNESCO, working together\r\nwith civil society, to promote dialogue among peoples,\r\nvia the Mondialogo initiative. In fact, the resolution\r\nadopted by the General Conference of UNESCO on\r\nnew prospects for activities of UNESCO with respect\r\nto a dialogue among civilizations and in particular, the\r\nfollow-up to the Ministerial Conference of New Delhi,\r\ngives that organization the legal basis to launch\r\ninitiatives at the national, regional and international\r\nlevels by joining with many non-governmental and\r\n11\r\nA/60/PV.36\r\ngovernmental players. The international community\r\nand civil society need to associate themselves with the\r\nimplementation of those initiatives.\r\nThe rise of extremism and fanaticism that are not\r\nspecific to any religion or civilization, is of great\r\nconcern. The search for the causes of that phenomenon\r\nwill bring to light insufficient dialogue and inadequate\r\nchannels of knowledge and reciprocal knowledge. The\r\nremedy to the situation lies in increasing cultural, inter-\r\nethnic and inter-civilizational efforts aimed at\r\npromoting contact between communities and enabling\r\nbetter interaction between peoples.\r\nThe great number of festivals, cultural events,\r\nsports events and religious conferences organized in\r\nrecent years attest to the collective awareness that\r\ndialogue is a key factor in establishing peace.\r\nHowever, it is no less true that dialogue can only be\r\nconstructive if it is put on solid footing. The\r\ncommitment of the international community is\r\nnecessary in order to disseminate a culture of peace,\r\nbased upon adherence to the principles of freedom,\r\njustice, democracy, tolerance, solidarity and\r\ncooperation, pluralism and cultural diversity. It must\r\nalso be based upon dialogue and understanding at all\r\nlevels of society and among nations.\r\nThe adoption of the UNESCO Universal\r\nDeclaration on Cultural Diversity on 2 November 2001\r\nonce again confirmed the commitment of that\r\norganization to promote the fertile diversity of cultures\r\nfor a more open and more creative world in the new\r\ncontext of the twenty-first century, which will make it\r\npossible to strengthen the dialogue.\r\nThe legal instruments for cultural diversity have\r\njust been enriched today by UNESCO’s adoption, by\r\nan overwhelming majority, of the Convention on\r\nCultural Diversity, which removes culture from the\r\nrules of international trade. The many ratifications will\r\nconfirm the overall awareness of the role that respect\r\nfor cultural diversity can play in the peaceful\r\ncoexistence among peoples.\r\nIt would also be appropriate to carry out a\r\ncomparative study of existing initiatives in order to\r\nmake up the shortcomings. UNESCO is, in our view,\r\nthe appropriate organization to carry out that kind of\r\nsurvey. It should be called upon to provide its\r\nassistance to all those who are working towards that\r\nsame end. The media could be involved to genuinely\r\npresent religions as instruments of peace.\r\nCertain of the virtues of dialogue, my country\r\nwelcomed the decision of the Secretary-General of the\r\nUnited Nations to establish a high-level working group\r\non the alliance of civilizations. Initiated by two\r\nfriendly countries — Spain and Turkey — the working\r\ngroup, which also includes an eminent Moroccan, has\r\nbeen instructed to propose common actions to mitigate\r\nthe causes and consequences of the difficulties of\r\nunderstanding.\r\nIn that context, Morocco initiated the Rabat\r\nDeclaration adopted by experts working on a project\r\ncalled “Roads of Faith” on 23 June 1995, which\r\nproposed that the Director General of UNESCO\r\nestablish institutes to study the three monotheistic\r\nscriptures. Experts of the three monotheistic religions\r\nand their specific cultures would seek new forms of\r\ndialogue by going beyond the conventional framework\r\nof the history of compared religions. Teachers working\r\nin this area should also share the same ideal of peace.\r\nIn addition, my country, favoured by its\r\ngeographic and historical location, has always been at\r\nthe crossroads of civilizations and religions. That\r\nspecial role is at the root of its commitment, for\r\ndecades now, to interreligious dialogue. Morocco\r\nregularly hosts events and conferences in that area. The\r\nmost recent — an international conference for\r\neducators, journalists, artists, writers and non-\r\ngovernmental specialized organizations, as well as\r\nreligious and spiritual leaders, scientists, engineers and\r\nvarious technical experts — took place in Rabat on\r\n14-16 July 2005.\r\nThat conference adopted a plan of action for the\r\nimplementation of dialogue through education, culture,\r\nthe sciences, communication and information. In\r\naddition and given that the new information\r\ntechnologies now play a key role in the spread of\r\nculture and promotion of dialogue among peoples,\r\nMorocco supported the initiative that was presented by\r\nHis Excellency, Mr. Abdoulaye Wade, President of\r\nSenegal, at the first phase of the World Summit on the\r\nInformation Society, in which he called for the\r\nestablishment of a digital solidarity fund. My country\r\nhas contributed 300,000 euros to that fund.\r\nThe Kingdom of Morocco sponsored draft\r\nresolutions A/60/L.4, A/60/L.5 and A/60/L.6, entitled\r\nrespectively, “Promotion of interreligious dialogue and\r\ncooperation for peace”, “International Decade for a\r\nCulture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of\r\n12\r\nA/60/PV.36\r\nthe World, 2001-2010” and “Global Agenda for\r\nDialogue among Civilizations”.\r\nConvinced of the relevancy of the message\r\nconveyed by those drafts and in accordance with its\r\ncommitment to a culture of dialogue for peace, we\r\nhope that the sixtieth session of the General Assembly\r\nwill adopt the drafts by consensus.\r\nMr. Shrestha (Nepal): We are living in a world\r\ncharacterized by great possibilities and uncertainties.\r\nOn the one hand, thanks to human genius and human\r\nprowess, the world has never been as close and\r\ninterlinked as it is today. Physical distances have been\r\nincreasingly blurred, and the world has become as one\r\nfamily. We are more familiar with each other’s\r\nlanguages, cultures, traditions, music, literature, sports\r\nand so on. Growing interconnectedness and\r\ninterdependence, which is the hallmark of the new\r\nmillennium, has been a major unifying force, bringing\r\nnations and civilizations ever closer.\r\nOn the other hand, the world has also witnessed\r\nthe unfortunate saga created by disruptive and divisive\r\nforces in the form of war, civil strife, ethnic and\r\nreligious intolerance, hatred, violence and, lately, the\r\nthreatening menace of terrorism. Those ugly and\r\ndisruptive forces are having a severe impact on the\r\nbedrock of humankind’s core values and human\r\ncivilizations.\r\nHerein lies the significance of the culture of\r\npeace, which rejects the culture of violence, extremism\r\nand fanaticism and adheres to the universal values of\r\ntolerance, solidarity, dignity and harmony. Those are\r\nthe cardinal principles and purposes enshrined in the\r\nCharter of the United Nations, which was created to\r\nsave succeeding generations from the scourge of war.\r\nRejecting the culture of violence and discord and\r\nreplacing it with the culture of peace and harmony\r\nwould constitute an important step towards the\r\nachievement of those noble objectives.\r\nThe 2005 Summit Outcome recognized that all\r\ncultures and civilizations contribute to the enrichment\r\nof humankind. That document also stressed the need to\r\nencourage tolerance, respect, dialogue and cooperation\r\namong different cultures, civilizations and people.\r\nParticipants at the summit also committed\r\nthemselves to creating a world fit for future\r\ngenerations while taking into account the best interests\r\nof children. That can only be realized if children can be\r\nsaved from forceful abduction by terrorists to become\r\nchild soldiers. Their tender hands should have pens and\r\npencils in them, and should never be forced to use\r\ngrenades and bombs. Educational institutions should be\r\ndeclared zones of peace, to help nurture young children\r\nin a peaceful atmosphere. Gun culture should have no\r\nplace in a child’s mind. Children must always be\r\nbrought up a climate of peace and harmony.\r\nUNESCO has made a valuable contribution to\r\ninstilling a culture of peace and non-violence in\r\nchildren by carrying out various activities aimed at\r\nchildren’s’ welfare. We commend the leading role of\r\nUNESCO in the implementation of programmes to\r\nobserve the International Decade for a Culture of Peace\r\nand Non-Violence for the Children of the World, 2001-\r\n2010. We strongly call for more targeted and focused\r\nactivities for children, especially in countries seriously\r\naffected by conflict.\r\nTranslating those commitments into reality will\r\nmake a real difference in promoting peace and\r\nharmony and greater understanding and cooperation in\r\nthe world. The continued interfaith dialogue and\r\ninteraction among civilizations are important to\r\nappreciating the core human values they espouse.\r\nTripartite interaction among intergovernmental\r\norganizations, the United Nations system and civil\r\nsociety is critical for cross-cultural exchanges and\r\ndialogue, which will contribute to peace and harmony\r\namong different cultures.\r\nNepal is the birthplace of Lord Buddha — apostle\r\nof peace and harmony, whose teachings of peace,\r\ncompassion, non-violence and tolerance remain as\r\nrelevant as ever and have become much more pertinent\r\nin our turbulent times. His message of peace and\r\nharmony has resonance in every civilization, culture\r\nand faith, and provides the guiding principles for the\r\nUnited Nations. Nepal is committed to develop\r\nLumbini, the birthplace of Lord Buddha, as the\r\nfountain of world peace and a world peace city, where\r\npeople can go to meditate on world peace, hold\r\ndiscourses on the Buddha’s teachings and carry out\r\nresearch on his teachings to promote peace and\r\nharmony.\r\nWe are encouraged by the renewed commitment\r\nshown by the International Committee for the\r\nDevelopment of Lumbini at a meeting held at United\r\nNations Headquarters on 16 September 2005. The\r\noutcome document of that meeting, which is contained\r\n13\r\nA/60/PV.36\r\nin document A/60/407, testifies to the desire of the\r\ninternational community to extend support and\r\ncooperation for the early completion of the projects of\r\nthe Lumbini development master plan. We are happy to\r\ninform the Assembly that significant progress has been\r\nmade in the implementation of the master plan,\r\nalthough several projects remain to be completed. The\r\ninvaluable support and cooperation of the United\r\nNations and the international community will go a long\r\nway towards the realization of our cherished dream to\r\ndevelop Lumbini as a fountain of world peace and a\r\nworld peace city. It is our fervent belief that the\r\nrealization of this cherished dream will significantly\r\ncontribute to the agenda of the United Nations for the\r\nadvancement of the culture of peace in the world.\r\nMr. Kazykhanov (Kazakhstan): By proclaiming\r\nthe International Decade for a Culture of Peace and\r\nNon-Violence for the Children of the World, 2001-\r\n2010, the General Assembly set the course for the\r\nUnited Nations towards a just and peaceful world. We\r\nhope that joint efforts by the international community\r\nin eight concrete areas — from education to global\r\npeace and security — and the consistent\r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action on a\r\nCulture of Peace will facilitate the successful transition\r\nto a culture of peace and non-violence. In that context,\r\nUNESCO, the lead United Nations agency for the\r\nDecade, must continue to play an important role.\r\nWe are now at the midpoint of the Decade, and\r\nthere is a need for more advanced and coordinated\r\naction. In our judgement, priority should be given to\r\neducation, including the teaching of the practice of\r\npeace and non-violence to children. In the broadest\r\nsense of that term, the family, the media and other\r\nsocial and educational institutions should be more\r\nactively engaged in activities in this area.\r\nWe appreciate the efforts of the delegation of\r\nBangladesh, which have contributed in a significant\r\nway to the preparation of the new draft resolution on\r\nthe culture of peace, which has been co-sponsored by a\r\nlarge number of countries, including Kazakhstan. The\r\ndraft resolution emphasizes respect for the diversity of\r\ncultures, tolerance, dialogue and understanding as a\r\nmeans of establishing peace and stability.\r\nIt is in this spirit that the delegation of\r\nKazakhstan, among others, is a sponsor of the draft\r\nresolution entitled “Global Agenda for Dialogue\r\namong Civilizations” (A/60/L.6), which underlines that\r\ntolerance is one of the fundamental values essential to\r\ninternational relations in the twenty-first century. As\r\nstressed in the 2005 World Summit Outcome, all\r\ncultures and civilizations contribute to the enrichment\r\nof humankind and it is very important to respect and\r\nunderstand religions and cultural diversity throughout\r\nthe world.\r\nAn interfaith dialogue is an integral part of the\r\nefforts to promote the culture of peace and dialogue\r\namong civilizations. Dialogue among religions is\r\naimed at advocating the culture of peace and at\r\npromoting the common values of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration. Such a dialogue helps to develop\r\nunderstanding and tolerance, while strengthening\r\nfriendship among peoples amidst the multiplicity of\r\ntheir religions, faiths, cultures and languages.\r\nOne of the basic principles of the United Nations\r\nconsists in promoting and encouraging respect for\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms for all,\r\nwithout distinction as to race, sex, language or religion.\r\nWe welcome the closer attention being paid by the\r\nUnited Nations to the development of interreligious\r\ndialogue for peace. In recent years, the General\r\nAssembly has adopted a number of important\r\nresolutions on the promotion of interreligious dialogue,\r\nthe development of mutual understanding, harmony\r\nand cooperation between religions and cultures, and\r\nthe elimination of all forms of religious intolerance.\r\nKazakhstan supported and was a sponsor of those\r\nresolutions.\r\nIn Kazakhstan, we are convinced that efforts to\r\nstrengthen peace and security and ensure prosperity in\r\nthe twenty-first century increasingly depend on the\r\npursuit of dialogue and interaction among peoples of\r\ndifferent faiths, cultures and traditions. We believe that\r\nGovernments, civil society, the media, the private\r\nsector and international organizations must be closely\r\nengaged in strengthening interreligious ties.\r\nIt is very important to take practical steps to\r\nstrengthen cooperation among different religions,\r\nparticularly in the areas of education and the mass\r\nmedia, and to reinforce mutual understanding in order\r\nto overcome intolerance and to counter stereotypes. We\r\nconsider it important to study, disseminate and put into\r\npractice lessons learned by different countries in\r\ndeveloping interreligious dialogue. That is why\r\nKazakhstan has come up with the initiative of the\r\nCongress of Leaders of World and Traditional\r\n14\r\nA/60/PV.36\r\nReligions, which was held in Astana in September\r\n2003 with representatives of nearly all world and\r\ntraditional religions participating. The Congress\r\nsucceeded in institutionalizing the interreligious\r\ndialogue process by establishing a permanent\r\nsecretariat. The Second Congress of Leaders of World\r\nand Traditional Religions is to be held next year in\r\nAstana to discuss the issues of religion, society and\r\ninternational security.\r\nIt is also important to ensure that regional\r\norganizations actively participate in the dialogue. In\r\nthis regard Kazakhstan has offered to host a conference\r\nof the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope on interfaith accord next spring. It is with that\r\nunderstanding that we became active supporters and a\r\nsponsor of an informal meeting of leaders on interfaith\r\ndialogue and cooperation for peace held in New York\r\non 13 September 2005. The Declaration on Interfaith\r\nDialogue and Cooperation for Peace adopted at that\r\nmeeting invites, inter alia, the international community\r\nto intensify cooperation at the international, regional\r\nand national levels in the implementation of existing\r\nUnited Nations programmes for the promotion of a\r\nculture of peace and dialogue among civilizations.\r\nKazakhstan appreciates the efforts of the\r\nSecretary-General and United Nations Member States\r\nto make positive contributions to a culture of peace and\r\nstands ready to collaborate with the international\r\ncommunity in implementing the programme of action\r\non a culture of peace. Let me voice our confidence that\r\ndialogue and cooperation among religions, cultures and\r\ncivilizations will result in joint practical measures\r\npromoting just and durable peace.\r\nMr. Yanez-Barnuevo (Spain) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nI am particularly gratified to be speaking under\r\nMr. Jan Eliasson’s presidency, and I would like to start\r\nby fully associating myself with what was said this\r\nmorning by the United Kingdom in its capacity in the\r\npresidency of the European Union.\r\nThe Spanish delegation welcomes the opportunity\r\nto speak during this joint debate on matters of such\r\ngreat importance to the development of peaceful\r\nrelations among peoples and nations. We would like to\r\ndo this particularly under one item in the Assembly’s\r\nprogramme of work, and that is the Global Agenda for\r\nDialogue among Civilizations.\r\nIn keeping with the mandate in General Assembly\r\nresolution 56/6 of 9 November 2001, on the Global\r\nAgenda, the Secretary-General’s report demonstrates\r\nhow much progress has been achieved by States and\r\ncivil society organizations, as well as by some United\r\nNations organizations, in developing activities within\r\nthe context of the Programme of Action. The\r\ncompilation of the information received on activities\r\nundertaken highlights the seminal character of the\r\ninitiative taken in 1998 by the then President of the\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran, Seyed Mohammad Khatami.\r\nHis proposal was followed by suggestions from various\r\nMember States of the Organization, and they have\r\ngiven rise to particular interest from many others who\r\nhave lent their support, as well as from international\r\ninstitutions of all types.\r\nUNESCO has played an important part as a\r\ncatalyst for proposals, initiatives and thinking. The\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, among others,\r\nhas also mobilized efforts and concrete actions to attain\r\nthe objectives of the Programme of Action. This has all\r\nserved to promote proposals for the development of a\r\nculture of peace, which was welcomed in Assembly\r\nresolution 59/142 of 15 December 2004.\r\nSpain supports these initiatives and activities and\r\nfully shares the common goals of generating greater\r\nunderstanding and overcoming prejudice and\r\nmisperceptions of others and any polarization in\r\nrelations that might imperil stability or world peace.\r\nThat is why the Spanish delegation worked with many\r\nothers to ensure that our common goals would be\r\nappropriately reflected in the outcome document of the\r\nsummit (resolution 60/1), adopted this past\r\n16 September. In paragraph 144 of that document is a\r\nspecific reference to the initiative for an Alliance of\r\nCivilizations, which the President of the Spanish\r\nGovernment, jointly with the Prime Minister of Turkey,\r\npresented to the Secretary-General, who endorsed it on\r\n14 July. As is well known, the Secretary-General has\r\ndecided to establish a High-level Group to consider\r\nand propose concrete measures to activate the Alliance\r\nof Civilizations.\r\nThe Alliance of Civilizations initiative is not\r\nmeant to replace or marginalize other efforts by the\r\ninternational community to promote greater\r\nunderstanding among peoples and nations belonging to\r\ndifferent cultures. The concept document presented by\r\nthe Secretary-General with the support of Spain and\r\nTurkey is based on the desire to use other, earlier\r\norientations and initiatives. The aim of the Alliance is\r\nto direct the international community’s actions at a\r\n15\r\nA/60/PV.36\r\ndistinct new level, with a particular focus on relations\r\nbetween the West and the Islamic world, dealing, in\r\ngeneral, with common problems that arise in all\r\ncultures and societies. The Alliance seeks to give a\r\ncentral role back to people of goodwill, rather than to\r\nfanatics and extremists who foment division and hate.\r\nTo that end, the High-level Group for the\r\nAlliance of Civilizations should propose to the\r\nSecretary-General and, through him, to the\r\ninternational community strategies and practical\r\nactions to be implemented by Governments,\r\ninternational organizations and civil society actors. As\r\nstated in the report of the Secretary-General\r\n(A/60/259), the most urgent task is to devise a strategy\r\nthrough which to create a coalition of all those peoples\r\nwho do not believe in inciting violence or support\r\nextremism – and who surely make up the great\r\nmajority of humankind. In the opinion of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, the Alliance of Civilizations would be the\r\nappropriate forum within which to devise such a\r\nstrategy.\r\nSpain is firmly convinced of that and joins the\r\nSecretary-General’s call for an Alliance of\r\nCivilizations, which continues to receive significant\r\nsupport from States, international organizations and\r\nsocial actors. Now is the moment for States and\r\norganizations to contribute ideas and proposals for the\r\npreparation of the strategies needed by the Alliance. It\r\nis important to pursue implementation of the various\r\ninitiatives, as the 1998 call for a Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations (resolution 53/22) continues to bear fruit\r\nand contribute to collective actions and reflection.\r\nIn that context, Spain believes it is important,\r\namong other things, to pursue the considerations\r\nreflected in the draft resolution presented by the\r\ndelegation of the Islamic Republic of Iran on the\r\nGlobal Agenda for Dialogue among Civilizations\r\n(A/60/L.6). For that reason, Spain has joined the list of\r\nsponsors of that draft resolution. Likewise, the draft\r\nresolution presented by the delegation of Bangladesh\r\non the International Decade for a Culture of Peace and\r\nNon-Violence for the Children (A/60/L.5) and the draft\r\nresolution presented by the delegation of the\r\nPhilippines on the promotion of interreligious dialogue\r\nand cooperation for peace (A/60/L.4) are highly\r\nvaluable and demonstrate the crucial importance of the\r\nissue under our consideration and the need to defend\r\nthose values, which Spain shares and actively\r\npromotes.\r\nSpain will host the first meeting of the High-level\r\nGroup for the Alliance of Civilizations, to be held in\r\nPalma de Mallorca in November. We hope that, during\r\nthat meeting, the first effective steps will be taken to\r\novercome what some have called the ideology of fear.\r\nIt is the ideology of fear that incites fear and\r\nconflictive perceptions of other peoples, with the very\r\nharmful effects with which we are familiar, in relations\r\namong political, cultural and religious communities\r\nand which takes advantage of that fear and erroneous\r\nperceptions to achieve its ends. Overcoming the\r\nideology of fear will require practical actions in the\r\npolitical, cultural, religious and educational spheres as\r\nwell as in the media, among other areas, with particular\r\nemphasis on youth and with an eye to the future.\r\nThe Alliance of Civilizations must be a sustained,\r\nlong-term action if it is to be a catalyst for a genuinely\r\nuniversal awareness of the importance of the task we\r\nface. In order to succeed, the virtue of modesty needs\r\nthe support of hard work. That can be achieved through\r\ntireless efforts in day-to-day activities and by taking\r\ntimely, concrete actions at the local, national, regional\r\nand international levels. In short, it is a question of\r\nmoving beyond the indispensable dialogue and taking\r\ncommon action — doing things together in unity — at\r\ntimes overcoming our differences and at other times\r\ntaking strength from the diversity that enriches our\r\nrelations.\r\nThat is the path for the initiative of the Alliance\r\nof Civilizations, and that is the understanding of the\r\nSecretary-General. We want to reaffirm our support for\r\nthe decisions that the Secretary-General took so that\r\nthe Alliance of Civilizations can take shape in\r\naccordance with the work plan set out. We are\r\nconvinced that it is an objective deserving of the\r\nwholehearted support of all Member States. We hope\r\nthat will be the case.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): In\r\naccordance with General Assembly resolution 3369\r\n(XXX) of 10 October 1975, I call on the observer for\r\nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference.\r\nMr. Wahab (Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference): We would like to express our profound\r\nappreciation for the initiative of Bangladesh on a\r\nculture of peace (A/60/L.5), and that of the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran on the dialogue among civilizations\r\n(A/60/L.6). We would also like to thank those Member\r\nStates that are taking the initiative of promoting\r\n16\r\nA/60/PV.36\r\ninterreligious dialogue and cooperation by creating\r\ninstitutions addressing the causes of peace, pluralism,\r\ndialogue and understanding among nations and\r\ncivilizations.\r\nWe greatly appreciate the Secretary-General’s\r\nefforts to respond to the need to bridge divides and\r\novercome prejudice, misconceptions, misperceptions\r\nand polarization. The excellent work being done on\r\nthose issues by some of the agencies of the United\r\nNations system, in particular UNESCO, deserves our\r\nspecial thanks.\r\nAll civilizations, religions and cultures welcome\r\nunity and diversity of the human race. History shows\r\nus that all civilizations have been enriched and\r\ndeveloped through dialogue and interaction with other\r\ncivilizations. History also shows us that the lack of\r\nshared knowledge and understanding and the lack of\r\nrespect for various cultures and civilizations can\r\nimpact negatively on regional and international\r\nsecurity, stability and prosperity.\r\nToday, globalization has brought about greater\r\ninteraction among various nations and civilizations.\r\nThe process of globalization has the potential to\r\nfacilitate the promotion of understanding, peaceful\r\ncoexistence and cooperation among various nations\r\nand civilizations. But it also has the potential to\r\nprovoke cross-civilizational misunderstanding. Today,\r\nwe find many barriers of accumulated\r\nmisunderstanding and the vestiges of ideas that often\r\nhave faulty foundations.\r\nWe believe that the dissemination of erroneous\r\nconcepts through the media and education systems\r\ngives rise to ideological deviation, which can harm the\r\ninterests of all humankind. We believe, furthermore,\r\nthat the frequent placing of the term “Islamic” before\r\nthe word “terrorism” is a sacrilege. It is highly\r\ndangerous. We believe that utmost care should be\r\nexercised not to create a perception that might lead to\r\nenmity based on religious grounds among hundreds of\r\nmillions of people.\r\nMedia and education complement one another\r\nand there is a dire need to deploy media and\r\neducational strategies around the world, in each\r\ncountry, to address deviant thoughts. Media institutions\r\nshould be encouraged to play a role in spreading the\r\nculture of dialogue and tolerance, based on the\r\nrecognition of cultural pluralism. The culture of\r\ndialogue and mutual understanding should be adopted\r\nin school curricula and textbooks. Curricula and\r\ntextbooks must be cleansed of non-objective statements\r\nabout the cultures of others and of all that can trigger\r\nfeelings of hatred towards others. It is important to\r\nencourage the exchange of media materials that can\r\nfamiliarize their users with the cultures of peoples and\r\npromote the learning of languages and translation\r\nactivities, so as to break down cultural barriers.\r\nIslam advocates compassion, tolerance and\r\ncoexistence among all peoples of the world. Since its\r\ninception, the OIC has been making serious efforts to\r\nstrengthen ties among Muslim peoples and the peoples\r\nof the world in general. The OIC has been organizing\r\nsymposia and seminars in coordination with other\r\nconcerned institutions for the promotion of cultural and\r\ncivilizational dialogue. We believe that dialogue\r\namong various cultures and civilizations should be\r\nbased on mutual respect. We believe that sincere and\r\nsustained dialogue will foster mutual understanding,\r\nappreciation and respect among nations and\r\ncivilizations.\r\nIn his visit to the Council of Europe a fortnight\r\nago, the Secretary General of the OIC, Mr. Ekmeleddin\r\nIhsanoglu, had highly useful discussions on ways and\r\nmeans of promoting dialogue and cooperation. We\r\nhope that the OIC and the Council of Europe will work\r\njointly to address the challenges of international\r\nterrorism and Islamophobia. The OIC and its Secretary\r\nGeneral stand ready to work together with all national,\r\nregional and international institutions to promote\r\nharmony, cooperation and mutual understanding.\r\nBefore concluding, we would like to express our\r\nearnest hope that the draft resolutions of Bangladesh\r\nand the Islamic Republic of Iran before the Assembly\r\nand a draft resolution to be presented by Pakistan will\r\nbe adopted by consensus.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): We\r\nhave now heard the last speaker in the debate on these\r\nitems.\r\nBefore we proceed further, I should like to inform\r\nAssembly members that, at the request of the sponsors,\r\naction on draft resolution A/60/L.4 will be taken at a\r\nlater date.\r\nWe shall now proceed to consider draft\r\nresolutions A/60/L.5 and A/60/L.6, as orally revised.\r\nWe will start with draft resolution A/60/L.5,\r\nentitled “International Decade for a Culture of Peace\r\n17\r\nA/60/PV.36\r\nand Non-Violence for the Children of the World, 2001-\r\n2010”. Let me add that the following countries have\r\njoined as sponsors: Brunei Darussalam, Guinea-Bissau,\r\nMarshall Islands and Myanmar.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly wishes to adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/60/L.5?\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution\r\n60/3).\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): We\r\nnow turn to draft resolution A/60/L.6, entitled “Global\r\nAgenda for Dialogue among Civilizations”, as orally\r\nrevised.\r\nI would like to read the list of the following new\r\nsponsors: Austria, Bhutan, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cape\r\nVerde, Ethiopia, Finland, France, Guinea-Bissau,\r\nIceland, Jamaica, Liberia, Monaco, Paraguay, Republic\r\nof Moldova, Sierra Leone, Sweden and Ukraine.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly wishes to adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/60/L.6, as orally revised?\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution\r\n60/4).\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): Before\r\ngiving the floor to the speaker or speakers in\r\nexplanation of vote, may I remind delegations that\r\nexplanations of vote are limited to ten minutes, and\r\nthey should be made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMs. Garcia-Matos (Venezuela) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela fully\r\nsupports the contents and significance of the culture of\r\npeace and the dialogue among civilizations. They form\r\na substantive part of the revolutionary project of the\r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela.\r\nMy Government’s position is that knowledge of,\r\nand constructive acceptance of, different cultures is an\r\nessential prerequisite for the establishment of the\r\ndialogue of peace, which will enable us to build and\r\nstrengthen our societies, in particular as regards\r\nteaching children about non-violence. This is why we\r\nsupport the International Decade for a Culture of Peace\r\nand Non-Violence for the Children of the World.\r\nHowever, despite the great importance our State\r\nattaches to this topic, we will not be co-sponsoring the\r\ncurrent draft resolutions, because we have reservations\r\non the thirteenth preambular paragraph of A/60/L.5 and\r\nthe fourth preambular paragraph of A/60/L.6. The\r\nreason for this is that there are references to the 2005\r\nWorld Summit Outcome document. The Bolivarian\r\nRepublic of Venezuela sees that document as a simple\r\nworking draft that does not give rise to any mandate or\r\nobligation for the Republic, because of its flawed\r\ncharacter.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The\r\nGeneral Assembly has concluded this stage of its\r\nconsideration of agenda items 42 and 43.\r\nThe meeting rose at 5 p.m.\r\n"
