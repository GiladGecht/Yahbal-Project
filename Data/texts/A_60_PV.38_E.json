(Sweden) \r\n \r\n \r\n  In the absence of the President, Mr. Hamidon \r\n(Malaysia), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda items 46 and 44 (continued) \r\n \r\n \r\nIntegrated and coordinated implementation of and \r\nfollow-up to the outcomes of the major United \r\nNations conferences and summits in the economic, \r\nsocial and related fields \r\n \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/60/275) \r\n \r\n \r\nFollow-up to the outcome of the special session on \r\nchildren \r\n \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/60/207) \r\n \r\n Mr. Nguyen Duy Chien (Viet Nam): The \r\ndelegation of Viet Nam would like to express its \r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for his report \r\nunder agenda item 44, on follow-up to the outcome of \r\nthe special session on children (A/60/207). \r\n The report shows clearly that much work remains \r\nto be done to achieve a world fit for children. It is our \r\nconviction that in order to succeed in all four goal \r\nareas of the Plan of Action adopted at the General \r\nAssembly’s twenty-seventh special session (resolution \r\nS-27/2, annex), concerted efforts are needed at both the \r\nnational and international levels.  \r\n National-level efforts include intensifying actions \r\nto develop and implement national targets that \r\ncomplement and reinforce those of the Plan of Action \r\nand the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) and \r\nthe increased mobilization of resources to meet those \r\ntargets.  \r\n Efforts at the international level include support, \r\nassistance and cooperation among countries and \r\nbetween countries and the United Nations system. Such \r\ninternational efforts are important for helping countries \r\nwith scarce resources, especially developing countries, \r\nto focus their commitments and funding on attaining \r\nthe agreed targets. Therefore, adequate attention should \r\nalso be given to the international dimension of \r\nimplementing the Plan of Action, namely, the need for \r\nstepping up efforts aimed at fulfilling the commitments \r\nunder section C of the Plan of Action. \r\n The Vietnamese consider children to be the \r\nhappiness of the family and the future of the nation and \r\nthe world. A better future for all nations and the entire \r\nworld can be ensured only through adequate \r\ninvestment in the children of today. Therefore, we \r\nconsider the protection and care of children to be a \r\nshared responsibility of the State, society and the \r\nfamily. \r\n As the first country in Asia and the second \r\ncountry in the world to ratify the Convention on the \r\nRights of the Child, Viet Nam has developed and \r\nimproved legal and institutional frameworks for the \r\npromotion and the protection of the rights of the child. \r\nIn 1991, the National Assembly of Viet Nam adopted \r\nA/60/PV.38  \r\n \r\n2 05-57119 \r\n \r\nthe Law on Child Protection, Care and Education. The \r\nNational Assembly’s Committee on Children is \r\nactively working with relevant ministries and agencies, \r\nin particular the Government’s Committee on \r\nPopulation, Family and Children, to ensure full \r\nimplementation of legislative instruments. \r\n Viet Nam remains firmly committed to the \r\nprinciples and the objectives of the Declaration and \r\nPlan of Action of the twenty-seventh special session \r\nand continues to attach great importance to full \r\nimplementation of the goals enshrined in it. I will \r\nmention two areas of crucial importance for \r\nVietnamese children today. \r\n The first area is the promotion of healthy lives. \r\nAmong the four major goal areas, health care for \r\nchildren is among the top priorities of Viet Nam. \r\nHealth care activities in the country are implemented \r\nthrough national targeted programmes on the \r\nprevention of dangerous diseases, on the prevention of \r\nHIV/AIDS and on food hygiene and safety. Within \r\nthose programmes, a number of projects have been \r\nimplemented for the direct benefit of children, \r\nincluding programmes on extensive immunization, the \r\nprevention of malnutrition and safe child-rearing. \r\n In line with Millennium Development Goal 4 and \r\nthe goals of the twenty-seventh special session, Viet \r\nNam’s child mortality rate has been considerably \r\nreduced. The under-five mortality rate went down from \r\n58 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 42 per 1,000 \r\nbirths in 2001, and dropped further to 31.5 per 1,000 \r\nbirths in 2004. The child mortality rate for infants \r\nunder one year of age declined from 44.4 deaths per \r\n1,000 live births in 1990 to 21 per 1,000 births in 2003, \r\nand fell further to 18 per 1,000 births in 2004. That has \r\nbeen achieved by improving maternal health, including \r\nthe elimination of neonatal tetanus, better \r\nimmunization coverage, the broad distribution of \r\nvitamin A and the provision of free medical \r\nexaminations for the poor. Today, 95 per cent of ethnic \r\nminority children in Viet Nam have been vaccinated \r\nagainst six diseases through extensive immunization \r\nprogrammes. \r\n Currently, further concrete measures are being \r\ntaken to address the gaps among regions of the country, \r\nas well as to further reduce malnutrition and injury-\r\nrelated child mortality, the latter being the greatest \r\ncause of child mortality today. \r\n Equally important is the second area, the \r\nprovision of quality education. While Viet Nam’s per \r\ncapita gross domestic product remains low, we are \r\nsparing no effort to provide basic education. Spending \r\non training and education amounted to 15 per cent of \r\nthe State budget in 2000 and 17.4 per cent in 2004, \r\nwhile spending on making primary and secondary \r\neducation universal totalled 52.6 per cent of all \r\neducation spending. Various strategies, programmes \r\nand plans have been developed and are being \r\nimplemented, such as the development strategy for \r\ntraining and education for 2001-2010 and the national \r\naction plan for Education for All for 2003-2015. Their \r\ngoals are compatible with those of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and the Plan of Action of the \r\ntwenty-seventh special session. \r\n At present, almost 94.5 per cent of Vietnamese \r\nchildren are enrolled in primary schools, and the \r\noverall rate for girls is only a fraction of a percentage \r\npoint less than that of boys. The enrolment rate for \r\ngirls at all levels of education has generally risen in the \r\nperiod 2001-2004, with no significant differences \r\nbetween regions. \r\n Efforts have been made to address educational \r\ndisparities between regions in the country, especially \r\nrelating to ethnic children. The boarding school \r\nsystem, which provides free education and \r\naccommodation for ethnic minority students, is being \r\nexpanded. At present, there are seven national boarding \r\nschools for such students. Enrolment of school-age \r\nethnic minority children has increased to between 85 \r\nand 90 per cent. Many provinces have a policy giving \r\npriority to the admission of ethnic minority children at \r\njunior and senior secondary schools. One hundred per \r\ncent of ethnic minority pupils are admitted into grades \r\n6 through 10 at public schools. It is also the policy of \r\nthe Government to provide free education, including \r\nnotebooks and textbooks, for ethnic minority children, \r\nand priority is attached to their admission into \r\nuniversities and colleges. Six sets of textbooks and \r\ncurricula have been completed in eight widely used \r\nethnic languages. \r\n The Secretary-General has correctly noted in his \r\nreport on the follow-up to the special session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly on children that most of the goals of \r\n“A world fit for children” will be achieved only \r\nthrough a major intensification of action for \r\ndisadvantaged children and families. Our current \r\nnational focus is in line with that recommendation. At \r\n A/60/PV.38\r\n \r\n05-57119 3 \r\n \r\npresent, the National Committee on Population, Family \r\nand Children is completing a strategy for the protection \r\nof the child for the period 2006 to 2010. Also, under \r\nthe Vision 2020 programme, the strategy will devote \r\nmaximum attention to the 2.35 million children living \r\nin conditions of special hardship, namely, those in \r\nrural, mountainous and remote areas, ethnic children, \r\nchildren from poor households, orphans, disabled \r\nchildren and others. The strategy is aimed at providing \r\nan enabling legal environment, a network and a \r\nmechanism for coordination among the relevant \r\nministries and agencies, the family, schools and the \r\ncommunity for the implementation of policies and \r\nprogrammes for the protection and the care of children, \r\nwith special attention to children facing special \r\nhardships. It is expected that the Government will \r\napprove the strategy by the end of the year. \r\n Viet Nam has a strong commitment and has made \r\ngreat efforts to promote, protect and care for children, \r\nand it is increasingly allocating new resources for \r\nchildren’s affairs. However, as a developing country, \r\nViet Nam still has a low level of economic \r\ndevelopment and faces certain practical constraints in \r\nterms of resources in a number of areas. In that regard, \r\nwe take this opportunity to express our sincere thanks \r\nto UNICEF and other international partners for their \r\nvaluable support and assistance for our endeavours. \r\n Mrs. Asmady (Indonesia): The delegation of \r\nIndonesia, like many other Member States, is \r\nconcerned about the pace of progress in implementing \r\nthe outcomes of the major United Nations conferences \r\nand summits. In that light, Indonesia appreciates the \r\nupdated report of the Secretary-General (A/60/275) on \r\nthe role of the Economic and Social Council in the \r\nintegrated and coordinated implementation of those \r\noutcomes. \r\n The Council has a central role to play in \r\npromoting the coordination of those outcomes \r\nthroughout the United Nations system. We are troubled \r\nthat the pace of implementation is slow, and we urge \r\nthe specialized agencies and national Governments to \r\ncontinue to cooperate with the Council to ensure full \r\nimplementation of outcomes. Clearly, there is need to \r\nenhance the efficiency and the effectiveness of action \r\ntaken to achieve the outcome goals. \r\n Indonesia also notes that the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral (A/60/207) on the progress made in \r\nimplementation of the outcome document of the special \r\nsession of the General Assembly on children — better \r\nknown as “A world fit for children” (resolution S-27/2) — \r\npresents a mixed picture of such progress. This, the third \r\nfollow-up report, will serve to keep the fire of enthusiasm \r\nburning on behalf of children. From the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report, we note that an increasing number of \r\ncountries have formulated national plans of action to fulfil \r\nthe commitments made at the special session. Priority \r\nissues for children are becoming more and more \r\nintegrated into mainstream national planning processes. \r\nThat augurs well for the future. \r\n For its part, in 2004 Indonesia adopted the \r\nNational Programme for Indonesian Children 2015. \r\nThat plan has served as a catalyst for action on behalf \r\nof Indonesia’s children. Just one year after its \r\nimplementation, the plan has already had an impact on \r\nthe health and physical security of the nation’s \r\nchildren, who are now afforded greater protection from \r\nabuse, exploitation and violence. The plan has also led \r\nto action to combat infections among children and to \r\nensure they receive a sound diet. Vaccine-preventable \r\ndiseases are being resolutely addressed, with special \r\nattention being given to polio and measles, which have \r\nbegun to resurge in Indonesia. With the support of the \r\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the \r\nWorld Health Organization, the Government of \r\nIndonesia has put programmes into effect in \r\nconjunction with a national immunization week. Some \r\n24 million children have benefited. \r\n Other aspects of children’s physical well-being \r\nare being addressed as well. There are now a number of \r\nnutrition programmes in place intended to deal with \r\nprotein-energy malnutrition and micronutrient \r\ndeficiencies among children. Specially targeted are \r\nchildren under five from poor families and poor \r\npregnant women. Those programmes have served to \r\nreduce both maternal and newborn mortality rates. \r\n Illiteracy is also being attacked. The Government \r\nof Indonesia has taken to heart the maxim, “a healthy \r\nmind in a healthy body”. To that end, acting in concert \r\nwith UNICEF and UNESCO, the Government of \r\nIndonesia has set up a number of creative learning \r\ncommunities for children designed to make the \r\nlearning experience a thoroughly enjoyable one. Those \r\ninstitutions benefit from transparent management and \r\nenjoy the active support of their surrounding \r\ncommunities. The creative learning programme has \r\nexpanded with incredible rapidity. In 2000, 79 schools \r\noffered this type of quality education. By 2004, there \r\nA/60/PV.38  \r\n \r\n4 05-57119 \r\n \r\nwere 1,326 schools involved, reaching close to a \r\nquarter of a million children. \r\n Those breakthroughs represent merely the \r\nbeginning for Indonesia. We are determined to \r\nmaintain the momentum that we have generated. But \r\nwe are not so narrowly focused as to ignore what is \r\nhappening elsewhere within our region. We are \r\ntherefore happy that regional mechanisms are ensuring \r\npolitical support for the goals of the special session, \r\nand we would be more than willing to share \r\nexperiences and best practices with our neighbours. \r\n Mrs. Núñez de Odremán (Bolivarian Republic \r\nof Venezuela) (spoke in Spanish): With regard to \r\nagenda item 46, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela \r\nwould like to reiterate its commitment as a Member of \r\nthe United Nations, to participate fully in the study of \r\nthe integrated and coordinated implementation of and \r\nfollow-up to the outcomes of the major United Nations \r\nconferences and summits in the economic, social and \r\nrelated fields. We believe they reflect the international \r\ncommunity’s will to confront the serious problems of \r\nhumanity with a view to achieving sustainable \r\ndevelopment. \r\n However, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela \r\ndoes not consider it legitimate that the outcome \r\ndocument of the 2005 world summit be invoked with \r\nregard to the current item. It is well known that our \r\ncountry has sent a letter to the President of the General \r\nAssembly calling for the Legal Counsel of the United \r\nNations, as an office under the Secretary-General, to be \r\nconsulted with a view to evaluating and restoring the \r\nlegitimacy and credibility of the outcome document. \r\nWe made the request based on the following \r\nconsiderations, among others: first, did the negotiation \r\nand approval process used in connection with that \r\ndocument conform with the relevant provisions of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter, the rules of the General \r\nAssembly and procedural norms?; secondly, was the \r\nsummit outcome document’s reform agenda, as \r\nincorporated in the related draft resolution, truly \r\napproved by consensus, in view of the explicit \r\nrejection of its legitimacy and the express \r\ncondemnation of the document by the Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela?; and, thirdly, if we conclude \r\nthat the consensus required for the adoption of the \r\ndocument did not prevail, what value can we attach to \r\nany negotiations based on it?  \r\n Until a reply is given to its request which was \r\nsubmitted in virtue of its prerogatives as a sovereign \r\nnation and a full Member of the General Assembly, the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela feels that any \r\nactivity relating to the implementation or application of \r\nthe outcome document must remain in abeyance.  \r\n The Acting President: In accordance with \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 49/2 of 19 October 1994, \r\nI call on the observer for the International Federation \r\nof Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies to give his \r\nstatement. \r\n Mr. Gospodinov (International Federation of Red \r\nCross and Red Crescent Societies): Let me start \r\ndirectly with one of our major challenges today — \r\nHIV/AIDS and children. At the sixth Pan African \r\nConference of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, \r\nheld in Algiers in September 2004, African Red Cross \r\nand Red Crescent Societies adopted a plan of action \r\ncontaining several objectives. In particular, it calls for \r\na serious commitment to fight stigma and \r\ndiscrimination faced by people living with HIV/AIDS \r\nand children orphaned by HIV/AIDS; the need to fight \r\nthe pandemic through education; and the need to \r\nprovide psychological support for affected children, \r\ntheir families and communities. Those three objectives \r\nreflect to a large degree what we are discussing today. \r\n In southern Africa alone, Red Cross Societies, \r\nthrough their networks of volunteers, are currently \r\nreaching 50,000 homecare-based people in need, many \r\nof them children. They aim to triple that figure by \r\n2010. Their activities include strengthening the \r\ncapacity of community and family caregivers to \r\nprovide homecare, referrals, psychological support and \r\nassistance in creating self-help projects and food \r\ngardens. Last year alone, in the same region, Red Cross \r\nstaff and volunteers reached 1.4 million people with \r\nmessages on HIV/ADS prevention. A few weeks ago \r\nwe launched an emergency appeal, requesting \r\n$30 million to assist 1.5 million people facing grave \r\nfood insecurity in seven countries in southern Africa — \r\nnamely, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, \r\nSwaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The aim is to \r\nprovide food, agricultural support and safe drinking \r\nwater to vulnerable people in these countries, where \r\nmillions of children and young people are paying a \r\nhigh price, very often with their lives. \r\n A/60/PV.38\r\n \r\n05-57119 5 \r\n \r\n Also in Africa, Red Cross Societies, with support \r\nfrom the International Federation, are piloting a service \r\ndelivery model on access to care and antiretroviral \r\ntherapy for people living with HIV/AIDS. The pilot \r\nproject is being carried out in six countries: Uganda, \r\nKenya, Ethiopia, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Zambia. \r\nAccess to antiretroviral therapy is considered a priority \r\nfor our members in Africa. The greatest service we can \r\nprovide to any child is to keep his or her parents alive, \r\nand vice versa. Is there anything more important for a \r\nparent than to keep his or her child alive? That is \r\nexactly what we are trying to help with. \r\n Furthermore, the support for orphans and other \r\nchildren made vulnerable by HIV and AIDS is another \r\none of our main priorities in Africa. Guided by the \r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child and our own \r\npolicies, we have developed a regional Red Cross \r\nprogramme strategy for orphans in southern Africa \r\nwhich advocates holistic support to ensure that all \r\nneeds of orphans and other vulnerable children are met \r\nand that their rights are upheld. Holistic support, the \r\nway we understand it, includes food and shelter, plus \r\npsychological, social and educational backing. With \r\nthis in mind, our volunteers work with entire families \r\nand build strong relationships with the children who \r\ncome to rely on the volunteers after their parents have \r\npassed away. Currently, Red Cross volunteers are \r\nsupporting 90,000 orphan children in Southern Africa, \r\nalthough our aim is to reach a much larger number by \r\n2010. \r\n While the African continent is particularly \r\naffected by the HIV/AIDS pandemic, we at the IFRC \r\nare also working on HIV/AIDS response and \r\nprevention globally, including in Asia, Latin America \r\nand parts of Europe. Over the last year, we have \r\nstepped up our peer education programmes, which \r\nhave proven successful in schools, prisons, youth clubs \r\nand among high-risk populations such as truck drivers \r\nand commercial sex workers. Community awareness \r\ncampaigns, the promotion of condom use and the \r\ndistribution of educational materials were also \r\nexpanded. One month from now, on 1 December — \r\nWorld AIDS Day — a media-friendly anti-stigma \r\nevent, called “Come closer ...”, will be launched \r\nworldwide, aimed at millions of youth and involving \r\npeople living with HIV/AIDS. This is only one of our \r\nmany tools for a broad advocacy plan. \r\n We are aware that this monumental task requires \r\nequally monumental efforts and broad partnerships. We \r\nwork closely with the whole United Nations family, \r\nespecially UNICEF, whose campaign, launched \r\nyesterday, we strongly support. We also work closely \r\nwith the World Health Organization, the Joint United \r\nNations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the \r\nWorld Food Programme, as well as with Governments \r\nand agencies, such as the United Kingdom’s \r\nDepartment for International Development, the World \r\nBank, the OPEC Fund and many private corporations. \r\nThis is crucial for facilitating children’s access to \r\nantiretroviral therapy and treatment of opportunistic \r\ninfections. \r\n We also believe that partnerships with people \r\nliving with HIV/AIDS and their organizations are a \r\npriority. Our member Red Cross societies in Southern \r\nAfrica are also increasing their support to carers, \r\nincluding the grandparents and guardians of orphaned \r\nchildren, children who are caring for their sick parents \r\nand, inevitably, our own Red Cross volunteers who \r\nwork tirelessly with people living with HIV/AIDS and \r\nwith their families and who, sadly, are also living with \r\nthe virus. The International Federation is seeking ways \r\nto ensure that they have access to health care and \r\npsychological support as well. \r\n There is another important reason why we see \r\npartnerships as so vital. The caregiver-patient ratio \r\ncontinues to rise. This forces us to recruit and train \r\nmore volunteers in order to reduce the ratio to \r\nacceptable levels of one caregiver to 10 patients. \r\nVolunteers work for free, but their training and \r\nmotivation cost money and need continuous support. \r\nWe urge all stakeholders to invest more in human \r\nresource development. Volunteers should not be taken \r\nfor granted as free humanitarian power that does not \r\nneed investment. Our national Red Cross and Red \r\nCrescent Societies, which under domestic and \r\ninternational law are auxiliaries to the public \r\nauthorities, stand ready to work with United Nations \r\nMember Governments to bring action forward on this \r\nvital issue. \r\n When tsunamis, hurricanes or earthquakes strike \r\nand cause destruction, we act swiftly — at least in \r\nmost cases. We save children and parents alike. \r\nSometimes one gets the feeling that sudden natural \r\ndisasters push us to act within minutes or hours, while \r\nwith long-lasting, even predictable, disasters such as \r\nthe HIV/AIDS pandemic, we are not fast and generous \r\nenough. HIV/AIDS kills and affects more people than \r\ndo earthquakes and hurricanes combined. \r\nA/60/PV.38  \r\n \r\n6 05-57119 \r\n \r\n Looking at newspaper ads, we are encouraged to \r\nadopt a highway, a lake, a forest, a street dog or an \r\nelephant in a zoo. That is fine; it is correct and noble. \r\nHowever, to strengthen our global and coordinated \r\nactions to combat HIV/AIDS, maybe the time has \r\ncome to individually and specifically adopt villages in \r\nAfrica and elsewhere so that someday we may say that \r\nnot only were the adopted forest, the street dog or the \r\nmalnourished elephant in the zoo rescued, but that, \r\nchild by child, village by village, or country by \r\ncountry, a generation was saved. Then, and only then, \r\ncan we focus on saving more lakes, more rivers and \r\nmore elephants. Children, however, must be our \r\nultimate priority. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on this item. The Assembly has \r\nthus concluded this stage of its consideration of agenda \r\nitems 44 and 46. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 60 \r\n \r\n \r\nGlobal road safety crisis \r\n \r\n \r\n (a) Note by the Secretary-General \r\n(A/60/181 and Corr.1) \r\n \r\n \r\n (b) Draft resolution (A/60/L.8) \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Oman to introduce draft resolution \r\nA/60/L.8. \r\n Mr. Al-Hinai (Oman): Since our discussion on \r\nroad safety in this very Hall last April 2004, another \r\n1.2 million people have been killed on our roads \r\nworldwide, and another 20 to 50 million have been \r\ninjured or disabled. These are startling figures. Yet, \r\nthey have not made headlines like, say, a plane crash \r\nwould. \r\n The global road safety crisis is a modern \r\nepidemic of extraordinary proportions. The numbers \r\nare rapidly getting worse, and the World Health \r\nOrganization has predicted that by 2020 road traffic \r\ndeaths and injuries will exceed HIV/AIDS as a burden \r\nof death and disability. \r\n What is most alarming is that this crisis is \r\npredictable and preventable. These deaths and injuries \r\nare predictable, because they rise as the numbers of \r\ncars on the road increase. They are preventable, \r\nbecause we have the tools and the knowledge to \r\nprevent these deaths. What is most frightening is that \r\nfew recognize that this is an epidemic in the making \r\nand that it can be prevented. Fatalism is our biggest \r\nproblem, causing individuals to look at road traffic \r\ninjuries as just accidents — acts that are unpredictable \r\nand therefore unpreventable. \r\n 2004 was a year of much activity as the United \r\nNations and the international community tried to raise \r\nawareness of the problem. The World Health \r\nOrganization (WHO) dedicated World Health Day to \r\nroad safety and, together with the World Bank, \r\nlaunched the World Report on Road Traffic Injury \r\nPrevention. The General Assembly adopted resolution \r\n58/289, which invited WHO to act as coordinator for \r\nroad safety issues within the United Nations system. \r\nThe World Health Organization, with the support of the \r\nUnited Nations regional commissions and a number of \r\nstakeholders, held a series of meetings, a result of \r\nwhich is their excellent input in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report, contained in document A/60/181. \r\n With the active participation and support of the \r\nUnited Nations regional commissions in the process, \r\ncountries and organizations are pushing forward \r\ntowards greater international cooperation. Regional \r\nefforts are under way in Asia, Africa, Europe and Latin \r\nAmerica. \r\n We have come a long way since the road safety \r\nitem was included in the agenda of the General \r\nAssembly in 2003. There is still much more that we \r\ncan do. \r\n We need to set our goals and monitor our \r\nperformance. While we speak of the global road safety \r\ncrisis and the predicted near doubling of road traffic \r\ndeaths by the year 2020, we can also see this as an \r\nopportunity to turn the rising numbers around. If we \r\ncan keep the death toll from rising to predicted levels \r\nover the next 15 years, we can save more than five \r\nmillion lives. \r\n We need to collect meaningful data and \r\nstrengthen information systems, so as to help \r\nGovernments view road safety as an important \r\ninvestment. \r\n We need to build the capacity to manage road \r\nsafety systems, with a focus on prevention of injuries, \r\ntreatment of injuries and rehabilitation of the injured. \r\n We need to pass and enforce legislation that will \r\nhelp make vehicles, roadways and drivers safer. \r\n A/60/PV.38\r\n \r\n05-57119 7 \r\n \r\n We need to support research that illuminates both \r\nthe causes and consequences of road traffic injuries in \r\nlow- and middle-income countries and we must share \r\nthe information that we generate. \r\n Most important is our need to generate political \r\nwill. Road safety is no accident. It requires \r\ncommitment at the highest levels of leadership. \r\n Oman, under the wise leadership of His Majesty \r\nthe Sultan, has, in the last 35 years, seen its road \r\nnetwork grow from 10 kilometres in 1970 to thousands \r\nof kilometres, connecting all regions from the north to \r\nthe south, and from the east to the west. Inevitably, \r\nalong with the increase in the number of vehicles on \r\nour roads, the collisions and crashes leading to deaths \r\nand injuries also increased. Improving safety on our \r\nroads became a top priority for the Government of \r\nOman. \r\n Legislation was enacted and a national road \r\nsafety agency was established, whose task was to \r\nupdate comprehensive regulations and create a registry \r\nto obtain detailed information on the causes of \r\ncollisions and crashes, with the aim of reducing the \r\nnumber of accidents to a minimum. A year ago, the \r\nState Council held a forum on road safety. The two-day \r\nforum was also attended by members of the Shura \r\nCouncil and the Royal Oman Police, which is \r\nresponsible for implementing road safety regulations \r\nand for the prevention of road traffic injuries. \r\n Oman’s initiative to raise global awareness about \r\nroad safety is based on its own experience and \r\nrealization that the problem can only get worse if \r\nnothing is done about it. We need to intensify our \r\nefforts to raise worldwide awareness of the road safety \r\ncrisis and its consequences. \r\n My delegation has, throughout this process, \r\nworked very closely with other delegations, as well as \r\nwith a number of other organizations. In addition, from \r\nthe time the delegation of Oman accepted the General \r\nAssembly’s invitation to act as coordinator on road \r\nsafety issues within the United Nations system, the \r\nWorld Health Organization, together with the United \r\nNations regional commissions, has been a reliable and \r\ndedicated partner. \r\n The World Health Organization has hosted \r\nmeetings of the United Nations Road Safety \r\nCollaboration, whose outcomes are contained in the \r\nreport of the Secretary-General. Other important \r\nplayers in the endeavour are the global road safety \r\nsteering committee under the secretariat of the Task \r\nForce for Child Survival and Development, the FIA \r\nFoundation for the Automobile and Society and the \r\nWorld Bank, who have all given me invaluable support \r\nand encouragement. \r\n In this context, I am pleased to introduce the draft \r\nresolution contained in document A/60/L.8, on which \r\nmy delegation has held a number of informal \r\nconsultations with other Member States to arrive at a \r\nconsensus. The draft resolution builds on the \r\nrecommendations contained in the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport (A/60/181) and in the World Health \r\nOrganization’s World Report on Road Traffic Injury \r\nPrevention, and its main points are as follows: \r\n First, it expresses its concern at the increase in \r\ntraffic fatalities and injuries worldwide and reaffirms \r\nthe importance of addressing global safety issues \r\nthrough international cooperation. \r\n Secondly, it encourages Member States to adhere \r\nto relevant United Nations conventions of 1949 and \r\n1968 and recognizes the work being undertaken by the \r\nUnited Nations Economic Commission for Europe in \r\nthe elaboration of a substantial package of amendments \r\nto the 1968 convention. \r\n Thirdly, it invites Member States to implement \r\nthe recommendations of the World Report on Road \r\nTraffic Injury Prevention and to establish national \r\nagencies to develop a national action plan to reduce \r\nroad traffic injuries. \r\n Fourthly, my Government welcomes the decision \r\nby the World Health Organization and the United \r\nNations regional commissions to jointly organize the \r\nfirst United Nations Global Road Safety Week, which \r\nwould serve as a platform for raising awareness \r\nglobally about road safety issues. \r\n Lastly, it is unfortunate that road traffic deaths \r\nand injuries are not treated as seriously as other \r\ndisasters and, sadly, the victims do not receive the \r\nsame respect and compassion as other victims of \r\nviolence. They end up being statistics and data. But \r\nbehind those numbers are real people — sons, \r\ndaughters, brothers, sisters, parents and friends. Let me \r\ngive you just a few examples. \r\n Faisal — A young physician who had just \r\ncompleted his post-graduate studies, sustained serious \r\ninjuries in a road crash and, after seven months on a \r\nA/60/PV.38  \r\n \r\n8 05-57119 \r\n \r\nrespirator, had to relearn how to speak, walk and eat. \r\nSadly, he will never practise medicine again. \r\n Nauf was 4 years old when she was hit by a car \r\nwhile crossing the street and was paralysed from the \r\nneck down. She was brought to a hospital and put on a \r\nrespirator to help her breathe. Ten years later, she \r\nremains dependent on the respirator. Nauf speaks two \r\nor three languages in addition to her mother tongue, \r\nmainly as a result of her communication with medical \r\npersonnel. \r\n Aron was an aspiring physician who had just \r\ncompleted his final year of medical school. He was \r\nriding a bus on a winding road when, as a result of \r\nspeeding, the bus went out of control and overturned. \r\nAron and 22 others died that day. \r\n While Lyndon was on vacation with his family, \r\nhis car crashed, and a month later he died from his \r\ninjuries. His family survived but will need to learn to \r\nlive without their main source of support. \r\n Mansoor, aged 26, was riding a motorbike \r\nthrough an intersection when he was hit head-on by a \r\nvan whose driver had run several red lights. He was \r\nkilled instantly. The court imposed a small fine on the \r\ndriver. Mansoor was not even mentioned in the \r\njudgement. \r\n The World Day of Remembrance was initiated \r\nabout 11 years ago by a number of non-governmental \r\norganizations and has since been embraced by \r\norganizations in various parts of the world. It is a day \r\nwhen we remember all those killed and injured in road \r\ncrashes and express our thanks to the emergency \r\nservices who are always the first to arrive at the site of \r\na road crash, to the medical personnel whose task it is \r\nto revive, treat and rehabilitate the injured, and to the \r\nfamilies who suffer grief because of the loss of a loved \r\none and who unselfishly provide love and care to the \r\ninjured. \r\n The World Day of Remembrance is a chance to \r\nremember people like Faisal, Nauf, Aron, Lyndon, \r\nMansoor and thousands of others, and to recognize the \r\nways in which their deaths or injuries have affected \r\nindividuals, families and communities. Operative \r\nparagraph 10 of the draft resolution invites Member \r\nStates to recognize the third Sunday in November of \r\nevery year as the World Day of Remembrance for Road \r\nTraffic Victims. \r\n The additional sponsors of draft resolution \r\nA/60/L.8 are: Afghanistan, Albania, Armenia, \r\nAustralia, Austria, Bangladesh, Brunei Darussalam, \r\nCambodia, Canada, Chile, China, Croatia, Cuba, \r\nCyprus, Djibouti, the Dominican Republic, Egypt, \r\nGermany, Greece, Guatemala, Guyana, Iceland, India, \r\nIndonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jordan, Lebanon, \r\nLuxembourg, Malta, Nepal, New Zealand, Nigeria, \r\nPanama, Peru, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, the \r\nRepublic of Moldova, Romania, the Russian \r\nFederation, Senegal, Slovenia, Spain, the Sudan, \r\nSwitzerland, Timor-Leste, Tunisia, Turkey, \r\nTurkmenistan and Zambia. \r\n I commend draft resolution A/60/L.8 for adoption \r\nby the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Al-Kaabi (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in \r\nArabic): At the outset, I should like, on behalf of the \r\ndelegation of the United Arab Emirates, to thank \r\nPresident Eliasson for his valuable efforts in directing \r\nthe activities of the current session. I am confident that \r\nhe will ably lead our deliberations on this important \r\nagenda item. I also wish to express our sincere \r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for his important \r\nreport (A/60/181). \r\n Improving road safety is undoubtedly a crucial \r\nand urgent issue that requires immediate and decisive \r\naction. Traffic accidents are a leading cause of death \r\namong those aged 15 to 44. Each year, they kill more \r\nthan a million people and disable several million \r\nothers, resulting in tremendous human and material \r\nlosses and negatively affecting the social and economic \r\nconditions of individuals and communities, particularly \r\nin developing countries, which are striving to achieve \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. \r\n The United Arab Emirates commends the efforts \r\nof the United Nations and its various organs to address \r\nthe global road safety crisis and recognizes that the \r\nimplementation of road safety programmes in many \r\ndeveloping and poor countries requires adequate \r\nfinancial resources. We therefore believe it imperative \r\nto strengthen international cooperation in all its forms, \r\nespecially through the Organization’s regional \r\ncommissions and specialized agencies, in order to \r\nsupport the efforts of those countries and to provide \r\nthem with the financial and technical assistance they \r\nneed to build their capacities in the area of road safety. \r\n A/60/PV.38\r\n \r\n05-57119 9 \r\n \r\n Owing to the swift pace of development in the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates and to our easy access to \r\nautomobiles as the preferred means of transport, we, \r\nlike other countries, have seen an increase in the \r\nnumber of road accidents, especially among young \r\npeople. Bearing in mind the devastating impact of such \r\naccidents on our society, the authorities of the United \r\nArab Emirates have undertaken measures to address \r\nthis serious crisis, including adoption and \r\nimplementing international resolutions on road safety \r\nand taking the domestic measures necessary to reduce \r\ntraffic accidents by 5.5 per cent annually. Those \r\nmeasures include the following.  \r\n First, in the area of preventive measures, we are \r\nbuilding and maintaining a network of roads that \r\nconforms to international standards, using the latest \r\ntechnology in terms of traffic lights, road signs and \r\ninstructions, cameras and traffic control radar systems. \r\nWe are adopting driver safety laws establishing speed \r\nlimits and a minimum driving age of 18, requiring the \r\nuse of seat belts and setting out strict requirements for \r\ndriver’s licences. We are providing security officers of \r\nboth genders with the necessary training to enable \r\nthem to work on the police force and in traffic control, \r\nand we are increasing their presence on the roads.  \r\n We are promoting traffic awareness among \r\nindividuals in society, especially among students in \r\nprimary school, through media, educational lectures, \r\ncontests, prizes and participation in national and \r\nregional conferences and annual events on traffic. We \r\nare also applying higher technical standards and \r\nspecifications for vehicles to ensure their safety and \r\noperating condition.  \r\n Secondly, with regard to enforcement, we are \r\ninstituting strict penalties for violators of traffic laws. \r\nThey include fines, the suspension or revocation of \r\ndriver’s licenses and imprisonment. Stricter traffic laws \r\nand regulations are also being enforced on our roads. \r\n Thirdly, with regard to rehabilitation, we are \r\nproviding victims of road accidents with emergency \r\nand long-term medical care and rehabilitation services \r\nat hospitals and specialized centres. \r\n Moreover, the Government is considering other \r\ntransportation alternatives in order to reduce the use of \r\nprivate cars on roads as much as possible. That \r\nincludes developing and putting in place new means of \r\nmass transportation in order to reduce traffic jams and \r\naccidents. \r\n In conclusion, we hope that our deliberations will \r\ncontribute to enhancing international cooperation in the \r\narea of combating this serious scourge in both \r\ndeveloping and developed countries. \r\n Mr. Ng (Singapore): I would like to express our \r\ndeep appreciation to the delegation of Oman for its \r\ncontinuing efforts to bring the growing crisis in road \r\nsafety to the attention of the international community. \r\nSingapore welcomes this opportunity to discuss the \r\nroad safety crisis and supports the initiatives \r\nintroduced at this and other global forums to tackle the \r\ncrisis. \r\n When the Jet Blue Airbus 320 landed safely at \r\nLos Angeles International Airport on 22 September, \r\nafter having had trouble with its landing gear, our \r\nhearts rejoiced, as we felt for the passengers on board. \r\nUnfortunately, more often than not, we read headlines \r\nof plane crashes that kill hundreds of people. Disaster \r\nand investigative teams are activated and experts are \r\nmobilized to manage the aftermath of the tragedy, \r\nwhich often receives much attention in the subsequent \r\ndays and weeks. \r\n However, the higher number of deaths from road \r\ntraffic injuries receives comparatively much less \r\nattention. Such incidents do not occur occasionally, but \r\ndaily everywhere. Motor transport is no doubt viewed \r\nas one of the greatest inventions the world has seen. It \r\nhas become a convenient element of modern life, but it \r\nis also one of life’s greatest threats. According to the \r\n2004 World Report on Road Traffic Injury Prevention, \r\nwhich was produced jointly by the World Health \r\nOrganization and the World Bank, more than 3,000 \r\npeople die from road traffic injuries every day around \r\nthe world, about 10 times more than any possible \r\nairplane crash. More alarmingly, such deaths in  \r\nlow-income and middle-income countries account for \r\nabout 85 per cent of the total. According to the same \r\nreport, if appropriate action is not taken, by 2020 road \r\ntraffic injuries will climb to become the world’s third \r\nleading contributor to disease and injury. \r\n Road traffic accidents, and road fatalities in \r\nparticular, remain a chronic problem in our world \r\ntoday. Each traffic accident is a terrible tragedy for the \r\nfamilies and friends of the victims, as well as a loss to \r\nsociety. Apart from the death toll and human costs, the \r\napproximate annual worldwide financial cost of road \r\naccidents is estimated at $500 billion. That does not \r\nfactor in the costs incurred by insurance and other \r\nA/60/PV.38  \r\n \r\n10 05-57119 \r\n \r\nindustries. It is further estimated that the costs of \r\nmedical assistance, infrastructure-building, \r\ninvestigation and other expenses incurred as a result of \r\nroad accidents amount to between 1 per cent and 3 per \r\ncent of a country’s gross national product. That is \r\nsignificantly more than the total overseas development \r\nassistance provided to developing countries. While \r\nhigh-income countries are expected to continue to \r\nimprove their road safety situation, by 2020 road traffic \r\ndeaths are predicted to rise by more than 80 per cent in \r\ndeveloping and transitional countries, especially in \r\nSouth Asia. Most of those who are killed in motor \r\naccidents are men under the age of 44 years, who are \r\nvery often the sole breadwinners for their families. \r\n More needs to be done to reverse those highly \r\ndisturbing trends. The international community needs \r\nto build on the efforts and momentum of last year’s \r\nWorld Health Day, which was dedicated to road safety, \r\nand accelerate our collaborative efforts to reduce \r\ntraffic-accident-related injuries and deaths. It is only \r\nwith greater awareness that we can address the crisis \r\nindividually and collectively. \r\n Everyone has a responsibility to keep our roads \r\nsafe. In that regard, Singapore has always been active \r\nin the promotion of road safety, and has one of the \r\nlowest fatal and injury accident rates in the world. \r\nHowever, challenges remain, due to our aging \r\npopulation and the increase in the number of vehicles \r\non our roads. In the last two decades, the Government \r\nhas taken numerous steps to improve road safety in \r\nSingapore. With assistance from the Asian \r\nDevelopment Bank, the Government of Singapore has \r\ndeveloped a national road safety action plan. That \r\naction plan involves strategic collaboration between \r\nGovernment agencies, non-governmental organizations \r\nand the private sector, and is aimed at enhancing road \r\nsafety through a five-E’s approach: encouragement, \r\nemergency preparedness, engineering, education and \r\nenforcement. \r\n In the area of encouragement, the plan involves \r\nsetting up an effective road safety executive structure \r\nand a multidisciplinary working group to make \r\nstrategic changes aimed at enhancing road safety in \r\nSingapore. The objective is to expand and strengthen \r\ncoordination and participation by various major \r\nstakeholders. \r\n Similarly, emergency preparedness is being given \r\nrenewed focus, which involves better integration of \r\nefforts to provide swift and relevant medical \r\nintervention at traffic-accident sites. \r\n In the area of engineering, experts from \r\nSingapore’s land transport authority use up-to-date and \r\ncomprehensive data systems and accident-trend \r\nanalysis to incorporate safe practices into the planning, \r\ndesigning and managing of roads. Road conditions \r\nmust meet the highest standards of maintenance. \r\nAdvance equipment, such as the Expressway \r\nMonitoring Advisory System, working together with \r\nthe broadcast media, provide real-time traffic alerts to \r\nmotorists. The various engineering initiatives are \r\nfinancially costly, but critical in efforts to reduce \r\npotentially fatal accidents. \r\n It is equally important for automobile \r\nmanufacturers to constantly review their engineering \r\nprocesses and designs in the interest of promoting road \r\nsafety. That was perhaps best summed up by none other \r\nthan Mr. Katsuaki Watanabe, President of the Toyota \r\nMotor Corporation, when he introduced Toyota’s new \r\nmanagement team in June this year: \r\n “My dream of car making, for instance when it \r\ncomes to the environment, is to make cars that \r\ncan cross the American continent on just one \r\ntankful of gas, or cars that make the atmosphere \r\ncleaner the more we use them; and, in terms of \r\nsafety, cars that do not cause accidents, cars that \r\ndo not injure people or cars that make people \r\nhealthier when they drive”. \r\n The fourth “E” relates to education. Road safety \r\neducation is important for inculcating the correct \r\nmindset and road behaviour in all road users. \r\nEducation is not just simply teaching the traffic rules, \r\nbut making sure that the concept of road safety is \r\nconveyed clearly and that it is internalized. With good \r\neducation, good daily habits are formed, which could \r\nsave many lives on the road. The importance of road \r\nsafety has to be ingrained in everyone. Over the years, \r\nthe Government of Singapore, working with the private \r\nsector, has launched campaigns, road-safety talks, \r\nexhibitions and even videos promoting road safety. \r\nDespite the increased public awareness today, we \r\ncannot rest on our laurels. \r\n The fifth, and final, “E” — enforcement — forms \r\nan integral part of road-safety management. \r\nIrresponsible driving leads to traffic accidents more \r\nthan any other cause. Tough rules and penalties are \r\nrequired to deter traffic offenders. At times, the \r\n A/60/PV.38\r\n \r\n05-57119 11 \r\n \r\nGovernment of Singapore is obliged to take strong \r\nenforcement action to change the mindsets of road \r\nusers and make them think twice before engaging in \r\nreckless or dangerous road behaviour. Irresponsible \r\nroad users in Singapore face fines, the suspension of \r\ndriving privileges and even jail terms.  \r\n With regard to excessive speeding, for example, \r\nstatistics have shown over the years that speeding is \r\nthe number one killer. To combat that situation, tough \r\nand clear laws were enacted a few years ago, whereby \r\nspeed demons — that is, those who go over the speed \r\nlimit by more than 40 kilometres per hour — are \r\ncharged in court. They also stand to lose their licences \r\nfor committing such offences. Mobile speed-laser \r\ncameras have also been introduced to enhance \r\ndetection of those who speed. When our traffic police \r\nstepped up its speed enforcement in the middle of last \r\nyear, it raised some public anxiety as to whether the \r\npolice were being overzealous in their efforts. But, \r\nwith good public education and assurances from the \r\npolice, motorists do realize that the objective of the \r\nexercise was to save lives, especially those of \r\nvulnerable road users such as motorcyclists and \r\npedestrians, and in particular those of children and \r\nelderly persons. \r\n Our hectic modern-day lifestyles often breed in \r\nus a spirit of impatience. That impatience will cause \r\nsome to drive inconsiderately, others to overtake \r\ndangerously and yet others to speed excessively. \r\nSociety has always retained a basic faith in the power \r\nof education to change human behaviour. As long as \r\nthis is so, and as long as undesirable human behaviour \r\nis an important cause of traffic accidents, education, \r\ncomplemented by enforcement measures, adequate \r\ninfrastructures and sound collaborative efforts, will be \r\nthe key to reducing road casualties. \r\n Mr. Poojary (India): At the outset, we wish to \r\nthank the Secretary-General for his note transmitting \r\nthe report prepared by the World Health Organization \r\non the global road safety crisis, in accordance with \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 58/289 of 14 April 2004. \r\nWe would also like to express our appreciation to the \r\ndelegation of Oman for its continued efforts in support \r\nof this agenda item. \r\n The report informs us that road traffic incidents \r\nare a major public health problem and a leading cause \r\nof death and injury around the world. Each year, nearly \r\n1.2 million people die and millions more are injured or \r\ndisabled as a result of road crashes, mostly in urban \r\nareas of developing countries. In many instances, road \r\naccidents rob poor families of their breadwinner. In \r\naddition to the enormous economic and social costs to \r\nindividuals, families and communities, road traffic \r\ninjuries place a heavy burden on national health \r\nservices, in particular those of developing countries. \r\n India, as a country that has a vast road network of \r\nmore than 3 million kilometres and where road traffic \r\nis growing at the rate of 7 to 10 per cent per annum, \r\nattaches great importance to addressing the problem of \r\nroad traffic safety and to reducing the adverse \r\nconsequences of traffic accidents. Indian roads carry \r\n80 per cent of the country’s passengers and 60 per cent \r\nof its freight traffic. The highways, which constitute \r\nonly 2 per cent of the road network, carry 40 per cent \r\nof that traffic. \r\n For many years, India lagged behind many \r\ncountries in the development of highways. However, in \r\nrecent years, a concerted effort has been undertaken \r\nthrough new institutional arrangements and improved \r\nhighway engineering to advance the highway \r\ninfrastructure in India. \r\n Under the National Highway Development \r\nProject (NHDP), 14,279 kilometres of national \r\nhighways are to be converted to four to six lanes, at a \r\ntotal estimated cost of 6.5 trillion rupees or \r\napproximately $151 billion, at 2004 prices. That \r\nproject involves, first, the Golden Quadrilateral, \r\nconnecting the four major cities of Delhi in the north, \r\nMumbai in the west, Chennai in the south, and Calcutta \r\nin the east; secondly, the north-south and east-west \r\ncorridors connecting Srinagar in the north to \r\nKanyakumari in the south, and Silchar in the east to \r\nPorbandar in the west; and, thirdly, port connectivity \r\nand other projects. \r\n The Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojna — the \r\nPrime Minister’s Rural Road Plan — was launched in \r\nDecember 2000 to provide rural connectivity to \r\nunconnected habitations in rural areas by the end of the \r\ntenth Plan period, in 2007. The rehabilitation and \r\nupgrading of about 10,000 kilometres of existing \r\nnational highways to a four-lane dual carriageway \r\nconfiguration on a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) basis \r\nis proposed under phase III of the Project. \r\n An accelerated North-East Road Development \r\nProject is also under consideration for the development \r\nof roads in the northeastern region. The fourth phase of \r\nA/60/PV.38  \r\n \r\n12 05-57119 \r\n \r\nthe NHDP is a new initiative meant to provide \r\nbalanced and equitable distribution in terms of \r\nimproving and widening the highway network \r\nthroughout the country. That will be done by upgrading \r\n21,000 kilometres of single-lane roads to two-lane \r\nhighways and by constructing paved shoulders. \r\n We believe that this enhanced focus on improving \r\nthe road and highway infrastructure in the country will \r\nnot only help the development of the country but also \r\nlead to a reduction in road congestion, which will help \r\nreduce the number of accidents on the road. We hope \r\nand believe that, eventually, such an improved road \r\ninfrastructure will also serve to improve road safety in \r\nthe country. \r\n The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways \r\nhas been entrusted with the responsibility of \r\nformulating policies for road safety in India. It \r\ncompiles data on road accidents and prepares annual \r\nroad safety plans. The various initiatives being \r\nimplemented include publicity campaigns, grants in aid \r\nto non-governmental organizations (NGOs) for \r\norganizing road safety programmes and creating \r\nawareness; a national highway accident relief service \r\nscheme; refresher training for heavy-vehicle drivers; \r\nand the setting up of model driving training schools. \r\n Publicity programmes include the printing of \r\ncalendars and advertisements on the radio, on \r\ntelevision and in other mass media. A road safety week \r\nis organized annually to raise awareness of these \r\nissues. The sixteenth Road Safety Week was observed \r\nthroughout India from 3 to 9 January 2005, with the \r\ntheme “Road Safety Is No Accident”, which is also the \r\ntheme chosen by the World Health Organization in \r\ndeclaring 2004 as Road Safety Year. \r\n To generate awareness among schoolchildren, \r\nessay competitions on road safety are organized. More \r\nthan 43,000 drivers are being trained through NGOs \r\nand local institutions under the scheme of refresher \r\ntraining for heavy-vehicle drivers in the unorganized \r\nsector. Awards have also been instituted at various \r\nlevels to recognize important contributions made to \r\nroad safety. \r\n The linkage between poverty and \r\nunderdevelopment on the one hand and road safety on \r\nthe other has been underlined by the Secretary-General \r\nin his earlier reports. The Secretary-General’s report \r\nthis year (A/60/181) identifies a number of strategies \r\nand policies that could contribute to a decrease in road \r\ncrashes. One aspect that could be studied in this regard \r\nis the aspect of punishment for rash and negligent \r\ndriving. While this issue falls purely in the framework \r\nof national jurisdiction, WHO could make an \r\nassessment of the need for advocacy in that regard.  \r\n The report states that the international community \r\nmust take the lead by assisting countries in identifying \r\nroad safety interventions that have been shown to be \r\neffective and in implementing them in their own \r\ncountries in a manner that is appropriate to each \r\ncultural setting. That cannot be done in a purely \r\nmechanical manner. \r\n Given this scenario, the imperative for increasing \r\ninternational cooperation to assist developing countries \r\nto effectively address issues of road safety cannot be \r\noveremphasized. We appreciate the efforts being made \r\nin that regard through the World Health Organization. \r\nWe would like also to acknowledge the work done by \r\nthe regional commissions of the United Nations, \r\nparticularly the Economic and Social Council for Asia \r\nand the Pacific. \r\n We note from the report that initiatives have been \r\nenvisaged to assist developing countries on road safety, \r\nincluding by the World Bank. However, we note also \r\nthat mobilizing resources remains a concern for many \r\norganizations involved in global and national road \r\nsafety efforts, as the level of funding targeted at \r\nreducing road traffic injuries is far from commensurate \r\nwith the scale of the problem. \r\n Further international cooperation needs to extend \r\nbeyond the development of international instruments or \r\nthe universalization of standards that may have been \r\ndeveloped in one region. We are particularly satisfied \r\nthat the resolution to be adopted today recognizes the \r\nimportance of supporting the developing countries in \r\nbuilding capacities in the field of road safety and \r\nproviding them with financial and technical support for \r\ntheir efforts. \r\n Mr. Xie Bohua (China) (spoke in Chinese): The \r\nChinese delegation would like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for transmitting the report of the World Health \r\nOrganization (WHO) on the global road safety crisis \r\n(A/60/181). We also thank the Government of Oman \r\nfor its contribution in promoting consideration of the \r\nissue by the General Assembly. We are pleased to once \r\nagain be a sponsor of the draft resolution proposed by \r\nOman. \r\n A/60/PV.38\r\n \r\n05-57119 13 \r\n \r\n Road traffic injuries have become an ever more \r\nserious public health problem. Every year nearly \r\n1.2 million people die and 50 million more are injured \r\nor disabled as a result of road accidents, which cause \r\nlosses of more than $500 billion, including \r\napproximately $65 billion in developing countries, \r\ntwice the amount those countries receive yearly in \r\nofficial development assistance. According to WHO \r\nprojections, unless effective measures are taken, by \r\n2020 road traffic injuries could rank third among the \r\nthreats to human health, with serious economic and \r\nsocial consequences for all nations, particularly the \r\ndeveloping countries. Reducing road traffic accidents \r\nis important for poverty eradication, the reduction of \r\nchild mortality and sustainable development and \r\nshould receive great attention from the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n In the process of developing road transport, many \r\ncountries will go through a period with high rates of \r\nroad traffic accidents. The main reason is that during \r\nrapid economic development the conditions of road \r\ntransport and its management, as well as human \r\nbehaviour, often cannot adapt to the rapid increase of \r\nmotorized vehicles. That phenomenon can be \r\nconsidered a frustrating by-product of economic \r\ndevelopment. \r\n However, as rightly pointed out by the WHO \r\nWorld report on road traffic injury prevention, road \r\ntraffic injuries can largely be prevented and controlled \r\nthrough rational analysis and counter-measures. \r\nCountries should make joint efforts to improve road \r\nsafety by exchanging experiences, learning from one \r\nanother, and applying best practices. As a result of \r\neconomic development constraints, developing \r\ncountries tend to suffer far greater losses due to road \r\ntraffic injuries than do developed countries. There is an \r\nurgent need to improve the infrastructure and \r\nmanagement of road transport in developing countries. \r\nThe international community should provide more \r\nassistance in terms of funding, technology and training. \r\n China’s sustained economic development has also \r\nbrought significant developments in its road \r\nconstruction. China now has 30,000 kilometres of \r\nhighways, and the number of privately owned vehicles \r\ncontinues to grow. At the same time, China is among \r\nthose countries prone to road traffic accidents, \r\nespecially serious accidents with heavy casualties. The \r\nunderlying causes for that problem are scant awareness \r\nof road safety laws and regulations, poor road \r\nconditions and traffic environment and inadequate \r\nmanagement. \r\n The Chinese Government attaches great \r\nimportance to road traffic safety. Its Road Traffic \r\nSafety Act came into force on 1 May 2004. With the \r\nprimary objective of human safety, the new law \r\ninstitutionalizes various preventive measures by \r\nmaking them legal requirements. As a result of its \r\nimplementation, numerous positive results have \r\nalready been achieved over the past year. In 2004, there \r\nwere 567,753 road traffic accidents in China, causing \r\n99,217 deaths, 451,810 injuries and 2.77 billion yuan \r\nin direct property losses. Compared with 2003, the year \r\n2004 saw a significant 14.9 per cent reduction in road \r\ntraffic accidents, a 4.9 per cent decline in fatalities, an \r\n8.6 per cent drop in injuries and a 17.6 per cent \r\ndecrease in property losses. Its record low fatality rate \r\nin 2004 of 9.2 deaths per 10,000 cars placed China, for \r\nthe first time, among countries with a single-digit \r\nfatality rate. We are convinced that through the joint \r\nefforts of the Chinese Government and people, \r\nsignificant improvements will continue to be achieved \r\nin road safety in China. \r\n Mr. Maksimychev (Russian Federation) (spoke \r\nin Russian): The Russian Federation attaches great \r\nimportance to the question of ensuring traffic and road \r\nsafety and welcomes this discussion in the General \r\nAssembly. We believe that the United Nations should \r\nplay an increasingly important role in the development \r\nand coordination of multilateral cooperation in this \r\narea. It is particularly important to pool the experiences \r\nof countries to analyse the trends, the causes and the \r\nconsequences of road traffic accidents in order to \r\narticulate strategies and recommendations to enhance \r\npublic awareness, as well as to provide technical, \r\nexpert and, where necessary, financial assistance in \r\norder to enhance that potential. \r\n It is of key importance to further develop and \r\nimprove the relevant international and national legal \r\ninstruments. In that context, we very much appreciate \r\nthe report of the Secretary-General (A/60/181) on \r\nprogress in the implementation of General Assembly \r\nresolution 58/289. We believe that it contains a very \r\nuseful survey of the steps taken by the United Nations \r\nsystem in the area of road safety. \r\n On the whole, we support the conclusions and the \r\nrecommendations contained in the report. We believe \r\nthat the creation of the Working Party on Road Traffic \r\nA/60/PV.38  \r\n \r\n14 05-57119 \r\n \r\nSafety as part of the United Nations system was a \r\ntimely measure. On the whole, we agree with the \r\nmandate of the Working Party as set forth in the report. \r\nWe commend its activities and expect that it will come \r\nup with further concrete, practical results. \r\n It is important that the World Health Organization \r\ncontinue its successful coordinating activities on road \r\nsafety issues in the United Nations system. \r\n We also believe that the United Nations regional \r\neconomic commissions play an important role in \r\nhelping to promote road safety. We commend the active \r\nwork of the Economic Commission for Europe (ECE), \r\nwhich deals with a total of 11 international conventions \r\nand protocols that regulate traffic rules, road signs and \r\nsignals and questions relating to the state of road \r\ntransport infrastructure. \r\n On 20 September this year, the Working Party on \r\nRoad Traffic Safety and the Inland Transport \r\nCommittee of the ECE, under the chairmanship of the \r\nRussian Federation, decided on amendments to the \r\n1968 Vienna Conventions on Road Traffic, Road Signs \r\nand Signals. In accordance with established \r\nprocedures, those amendments will come into force for \r\nthe parties to the Conventions on 28 March 2006. We \r\nbelieve that what is being accomplished by the \r\nWorking Party is a very successful example of specific, \r\nmultilaterally agreed practical measures aimed at \r\nimproving international legal norms in the area of road \r\nsafety. We believe that the implementation of those \r\nmeasures at the national level by the parties to the \r\nConvention will help to reduce the number of accidents \r\nand injuries on the roads. \r\n We are convinced that, in spite of the importance \r\nof international cooperation in the area of road safety, \r\nthe responsibility for reducing the number of traffic \r\naccidents and injuries ultimately lies with national \r\nGovernments and with municipal and local authorities. \r\nIn the Russian Federation, we have taken steps at all \r\nlevels of authority to reduce the number of road \r\naccidents. We are carrying out planned efforts to \r\nimprove our legislation in this area, particularly by \r\nstrengthening the laws establishing responsibility for \r\ntraffic law violations.  \r\n In Russia, we are actively exploring and \r\nimplementing the most effective ways to reduce the \r\nsocial and economic consequences of accidents. At the \r\nfederal and regional levels, we are elaborating \r\ncomprehensive measures aimed at ensuring transport \r\nsafety, preventing accidents involving children in \r\nschools and preschools, improving the traffic flow in \r\ncities and bringing public transport technologically up \r\nto date. We are also cooperating with the United \r\nNations Development Programme in this area.  \r\n Those measures have thus far yielded positive \r\nresults. In the first half of this year, there have been \r\n5.4 per cent fewer fatal accidents, 16.8 per cent fewer \r\naccidents caused by drunk driving and 4.7 per cent \r\nfewer accidents caused by pedestrians compared with \r\nthe same period in 2004.  \r\n In conclusion, we would like to express our \r\ngratitude to the delegation of Oman for its efforts to \r\nprepare the draft resolution A/60/L.8, entitled \r\n“Improving global road safety”, which was agreed \r\nupon in informal consultations. The Russian Federation \r\nsupports the draft resolution and has become a sponsor.  \r\n Mr. Boonpracong (Thailand): First of all, I wish \r\nto express my delegation’s appreciation of the fact that \r\nthe issue of global road safety has once again been \r\ngiven the attention it deserves. Each year, nearly \r\n1.2 million people die and millions more are injured or \r\ndisabled as a result of road accidents, despite \r\nincreasing awareness concerning that preventable \r\nscourge. I also wish to express my delegation’s \r\nappreciation to the Director-General of the World \r\nHealth Organization for his eminent role as coordinator \r\nof road safety, to the Secretary-General of the United \r\nNations for his report on this agenda item (A/60/181) \r\nand to the Permanent Representative of Oman for his \r\ncontinuing work and for his relentless efforts \r\nthroughout the process of preparing the draft resolution \r\nbefore us. \r\n In the statement by my delegation at the 84th \r\nmeeting of the fifty-eighth session, we highlighted the \r\nimportance of concerted efforts and commitments at all \r\nlevels. Therefore, it is highly encouraging that since \r\nour discussion of this issue in April 2004, considerable \r\nprogress has been achieved in mobilizing much-needed \r\ninternational support and broader involvement on the \r\npart of all stakeholders.  \r\n In that regard, Thailand welcomes in particular \r\nthe establishment of the United Nations Road Safety \r\nCollaboration, which has already held two consecutive \r\nmeetings, and commends its useful work on the online \r\nglobal road safety legislation database as well as its \r\nongoing cooperation with its partners to produce a \r\nseries of “how to” manuals that will provide guidance \r\n A/60/PV.38\r\n \r\n05-57119 15 \r\n \r\nto countries on how to implement some of the \r\nrecommendations identified in the World report on \r\nroad traffic injury prevention. \r\n My delegation also notes with appreciation the \r\nefforts of the Economic Commission for Europe \r\nWorking Party on Road Traffic Safety to revise the \r\nconsolidated resolutions on road traffic and on road \r\nsigns and signals. What makes that exercise \r\nnoteworthy is the fact that it takes into account the \r\nsituations in as many countries as possible so that the \r\nresolutions can be implemented throughout the world. \r\nIt is our earnest hope that those revisions will be a \r\nuseful tool for both parties and non-parties to the 1968 \r\nConventions on Road Traffic and Road Signs and \r\nSignals. \r\n The Royal Thai Government attaches great \r\nimportance and thus accords high priority to the issue \r\nof road safety, because we suffer tremendous losses in \r\nterms of human lives, property and human capacity as \r\na result of road accidents each year. In December 2003, \r\ntraffic injury prevention was declared a national \r\nobjective. We are also concerned about the increasing \r\nnumber of accidents involving young drivers and drunk \r\ndrivers, which are alarmingly frequent. \r\n In that regard, the Road Safety Operations Centre \r\nof Thailand, with cooperation from the media and the \r\npublic health community, has imposed a partial ban on \r\ntelevision alcohol advertising between the broadcasting \r\ntimes of 5 a.m. and 10 p.m. The Centre has also \r\nsucceeded in prohibiting athletes and celebrities — \r\nwhose behaviour is always emulated by young \r\npeople — from taking part in alcohol advertisements. \r\nAdditional measures are the establishment of the \r\n“Don’t Drive Drunk” task force and the \r\nimplementation of traffic injury prevention \r\nprogrammes in school to promote public awareness of \r\ntraffic injury prevention, especially among young \r\npeople. \r\n Another area of concern to my Government is the \r\nroad-related death toll during festival periods, which \r\nhas been particularly high during the new year festival \r\nand the traditional Thai new year festival in April. To \r\ntackle that problem, Thailand’s Ministry of Public \r\nHealth adopted several measures in 2003, including the \r\nestablishment of a temporary rapid reporting system, \r\nthe announcement of the numbers of road deaths and \r\ninjuries during those festivals and the dissemination of \r\nthat information through the mass media, as well as the \r\nallocation of additional financial resources to support \r\npolice checkpoints during festivals. \r\n When the campaign was first launched, the \r\ntargeted reduction was not achieved, because during \r\nthe 2003 festivals the death toll was only 1 per cent \r\nless than that in the previous year. Despite that \r\ndiscouraging result, however, the Thai Government \r\nremained relentless in its efforts and chose to adopt a \r\nnew and even bolder strategy, called the “five E’s” — \r\nnamely, enforcement; engineering, which focuses on \r\nimproving road conditions; education; emergency \r\nmedical service; and evaluation and information. The \r\nnumber of road traffic deaths was reduced by 22.8 per \r\ncent during the traditional Thai new year in April 2004. \r\nThe strategy was implemented again during the 2005 \r\nholidays, this time with more encouraging results, as \r\nthe number was decreased by 25 per cent.  \r\n That experience reaffirmed our belief that \r\nconsistent political commitment and strict enforcement \r\nof traffic laws at all levels, as well as public support \r\nand involvement, are critical if road safety initiatives \r\nare to have the intended results. \r\n While close coordination and collaboration on the \r\npart of all relevant sectors of society at the national \r\nlevel have proved to be powerful tools in road accident \r\nprevention in Thailand, I am confident that far greater \r\nsuccess can be collectively achieved at the \r\ninternational level with greater involvement and \r\ncontributions by all stakeholders in the international \r\ncommunity. Therefore, my delegation wishes to \r\nreiterate its appeal to all Member States to make their \r\nbest efforts to tackle road safety problems. In \r\nparticular, we would like to urge Member States, \r\ninternational organizations and regional commissions \r\npossessing expertise on road safety to continue sharing \r\ntheir best practices and knowledge and to provide \r\ntechnical and other necessary assistance to other \r\ncountries that need it so as to supplement their \r\nendeavours in that regard. \r\n For many countries, the lack of financial \r\nresources is a major obstacle to efforts to increase road \r\nsafety. Mobilizing resources therefore remains a \r\nchallenge which requires attention and action. In this \r\nregard, Thailand welcomes the study by the World \r\nBank on the establishment of a global road safety \r\nfacility, which aims to create a fund to support those \r\nareas of global road safety for which resources are \r\nlimited. Another commendable effort is the global road \r\nA/60/PV.38  \r\n \r\n16 05-57119 \r\n \r\nsafety initiative, a partnership of seven private \r\ncompanies, launched in December 2004, which aims to \r\nreduce road traffic fatalities in developing countries. \r\nThailand believes that that is an area where partnership \r\nis still required and should be further strengthened, \r\nwith the full involvement of all sectors of society at all \r\nlevels, if we want global road safety to be a truly \r\nglobal agenda, with global achievement for all. \r\n Last but not least, my delegation wishes to \r\nsupport the recommendations made in the report before \r\nus which, first and foremost, remind us to reaffirm our \r\ncommitments to addressing the global road safety \r\ncrisis. As raising awareness is critical to maintaining \r\nthe momentum generated by the global road safety \r\nevents of 2004, Thailand supports the proposal to \r\ndesignate the third Sunday in November as the World \r\nDay of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims, to \r\norganize jointly, through the United Nations regional \r\ncommissions and the World Health Organization, the \r\nfirst United Nations Global Road Safety Week, and to \r\nconvene, as a part thereof, a second Road Safety \r\nStakeholders’ Forum. \r\n The recent developments highlighted in the report \r\nof the Secretary-General gives us hope. Given the \r\ngrowing awareness and commitment, and with the \r\ncontinued efforts of all, I am confident that global road \r\nsafety is a goal that we all can attain. \r\n Mr. Savua (Fiji): My delegation would like to \r\nthank the Secretary-General for having transmitted to \r\nthe Assembly for consideration the report entitled “The \r\nglobal road safety crisis: progress on the \r\nimplementation of General Assembly resolution \r\n58/289”. We also commend the efforts of the World \r\nHealth Organization in carrying out consultations with \r\npartners and stakeholders and incorporating the \r\nfindings and recommendations into the report for \r\nMember States to discuss. \r\n The report tells us that about 1.2 million people \r\ndie annually and millions more are injured or disabled \r\nas a result of road accidents. Most of those accidents \r\noccur in urban areas worldwide, and statistics show \r\nthat accidents are more frequent in developing \r\ncountries. The World report on road traffic injury \r\nprevention, launched last year, shows that road \r\naccidents are the second most common cause of death \r\nfor people between the ages of 5 and 29, and the third \r\nmost common cause of death for people between the \r\nages of 30 and 44. People in the latter group, in \r\nparticular, actively contribute to national economies, \r\nand such deaths result in loss of income for their \r\nfamilies and loss of skills and labour for the national \r\nlabour market. The global economic costs of road \r\ntraffic injuries amount to approximately $518 billion \r\nper year, of which $110 billion is borne by developing \r\ncountries. \r\n The report forecasts that there will be an 80 per \r\ncent increase in traffic fatalities in low- and middle-\r\nincome countries by 2020 if preventive measures are \r\nnot taken immediately. For Fiji, casualties sustained in \r\nroad traffic accidents increased by 9 per cent in 2004, \r\nas compared with 2003, while fatalities remained \r\nconstant during the same period. In this regard, we \r\nacknowledge the work of the United Nations Road \r\nSafety Collaboration, whose main goal is to facilitate \r\ninternational cooperation among United Nations \r\nagencies and other international partners to implement \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 58/289 and the \r\nrecommendations of the World report on road traffic \r\ninjury prevention in support of national road safety \r\nprogrammes. \r\n My delegation believes that more can be done, \r\nprovided that funds are available for national \r\nprogrammes and initiatives to be implemented. The \r\nroad traffic accident data report plays a major role in \r\nthe road safety planning and action of major \r\nstakeholders in Fiji. Major development plans have \r\nbeen based on the report. The effectiveness of the \r\nmeasures that are in place, as well as those yet to be \r\nimplemented, can be evaluated through the \r\nmaintenance of proper traffic accident data records. \r\nThe Fiji Police Microcomputer Accident Analysis \r\nPackage (MAAP) has maintained such data since 1994. \r\nThe MAAP was made possible by funds provided by \r\nthe Asian Development Bank. \r\n In the past few years, there has been an increase \r\nin the number of vehicles operating in Fiji. That has \r\nput a tremendous strain on our roads, which has been \r\nexacerbated by high rainfall, flooding and landslides. \r\nConsequently, there has been a related increase in the \r\nnumber of road accidents and casualties. Road \r\nmaintenance and upgrades cost the Government \r\n$25 million annually. In this regard, we welcome the \r\ninitiative of the World Bank to look into the \r\nestablishment of a global road safety facility, which \r\nwould help to create funds in support of developing \r\ncountries’ road safety plans. \r\n A/60/PV.38\r\n \r\n05-57119 17 \r\n \r\n Fiji has a programme in place to resolve road \r\nsafety problems which we hope will address the factors \r\nthat have been identified in the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport as reducing the risk of traffic-related injuries. \r\nThe programme, which has a number of strategic focus \r\nareas, will assist road users in curbing road accidents. \r\n The focus on safer roads will enable us to deal \r\nwith the need to improve road design, construction and \r\nmanagement. This includes the adoption of safety \r\npromoting designs, construction, rehabilitation and \r\nupgrading procedures in land-use planning and \r\nimprovements in road networks. Those are regarded as \r\nbasic prerequisites to tackle the road safety problem in \r\nFiji. Greater emphasis is placed on the safety of road \r\nusers and the provision of appropriate facilities to \r\nimprove their safety status. \r\n Our policy is geared towards safer driving \r\nfocuses on driver testing and training, and emphasizes \r\nthe responsibility of both drivers and passengers. As a \r\nresult, more effective methods of driver training, \r\nincluding compulsory training courses for beginners \r\nand improved defensive driving techniques designed to \r\nimprove drivers’ ability to perceive and avoid risks, \r\nhave been introduced. \r\n The focus on the safety of vehicles addresses the \r\nneed for effective control of vehicle design, \r\nconstruction, operation and maintenance standards. It \r\nalso addresses the means by which such standards can \r\nbe implemented in order to reduce the adverse effect of \r\npoor vehicle conditions on road users and on road \r\ninfrastructure. We have established an enforcement \r\nregime for appropriate vehicle safety standards so as to \r\npromote increased responsibility with regard to \r\nimporting, selling and operating unsafe or non-road-\r\nworthy vehicles and to fostering vehicle safety. \r\n In our statement last year, we mentioned that \r\nchildren are more vulnerable and more prone to road \r\naccidents. In Fiji children aged 15 and younger \r\naccounted for 16 per cent of total casualties and 19 per \r\ncent of fatalities. For that reason, a lot of emphasis has \r\nbeen placed on children’s traffic education in pre-\r\nschools, primary schools and secondary schools so as \r\nto inculcate traffic safety awareness in children. We \r\nalso include tertiary education so as to ensure that \r\nsafety awareness can be raised among future teachers, \r\ntechnicians, engineers and planners, who will be \r\ncontributing to infrastructure development in Fiji. \r\n The main cause of traffic accidents is human \r\nerror. That can be rectified through the dissemination \r\nof information through training, capacity-building and \r\nthe provision of resources so as to facilitate the \r\nimplementation of internationally agreed conventions \r\nand resolutions. We welcome the proposal for the first \r\nUnited Nations global Road Safety Week in 2007, \r\nwhich will target young road users. My delegation also \r\nsupports the call to designate the third Sunday in \r\nNovember as the World Day of Remembrance of Road \r\nTraffic Victims in memory of the victims and the loss \r\nand suffering sustained by their families. \r\n Road safety is everyone’s responsibility and we \r\nmust all play our part to support this global cause for \r\nthe sake of present and future generations. \r\n Mr. Wee (Malaysia): Let me begin by expressing \r\nour appreciation to the World Health Organization \r\n(WHO) for presenting a thorough and comprehensive \r\nreport on global road safety (A/60/181) with its long \r\nlist of recommendations. The report provides us with \r\nuseful information, especially on the activities that \r\nhave been undertaken following the adoption of \r\nresolution 58/289 in April 2004.  \r\n We are pleased to learn about the creation of the \r\ninternational road safety organization known as the \r\nUnited Nations Road Safety Collaboration. We are also \r\nencouraged by the participation of many United \r\nNations agencies, including UNICEF, the Office of the \r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \r\n(UNHCR), the World Food Programme and the World \r\nBank, as well other non-governmental bodies and \r\ndonors, in the initiative. That is reflective of the broad \r\nsupport and attention given to the need to tackle the \r\nquestion of road safety. \r\n It is very disturbing to be reminded that road \r\ntraffic injuries continue to pose a major public health \r\nproblem and are a leading cause of death in many \r\ncountries, especially in the developing world. The fact \r\nthat every year an average of 1.2 million people die \r\nand millions more are injured or disabled, mostly in \r\nurban areas of developing countries, should be a matter \r\nof grave concern to all of us. Such grim statistics \r\ndefinitely demand urgent attention and concerted \r\nefforts by the international community aimed at \r\ntackling and reversing the situation, as road traffic \r\ninjuries are largely preventable. \r\nA/60/PV.38  \r\n \r\n18 05-57119 \r\n \r\n The destructive and multi-dimensional impact of \r\ndeaths, injuries and disabilities on the economic and \r\nsocial well-being of our societies is well documented \r\nand needs no further elaboration. The loss of human \r\nlife and the disabilities caused by road traffic accidents \r\nare hard to accept, especially knowing that they are \r\npreventable. It is even more devastating to look beyond \r\nthe statistics of death and injuries to the traumatic and \r\nemotional impact of disabilities and the loss of life on \r\nfamily members of the victims. Road traffic accidents \r\nhave generated enormous economic cost and placed a \r\nheavy burden on national health services, particularly \r\nthose of developing countries. \r\n The Government of Malaysia attaches serious \r\nattention to the problem of road traffic death and \r\ninjury. Road accidents are one of the major causes of \r\ndeath and injury in Malaysia. Despite the many efforts \r\nundertaken by the Government to enhance road safety, \r\nover 300,000 cases of road traffic accidents were \r\nreported in 2004, compared with 290,000 cases in \r\n2003, at an average of 895 accident cases per day in \r\n2004 throughout the country. Those accidents resulted \r\nin the loss of 6,000 lives last year. This phenomenon is \r\nsaid to consume an estimated 6 billion Malaysian \r\nringgit, or $1.5 billion, resulting from loss of \r\nproductivity, medical costs, management costs and \r\nproperty damage, among others.  \r\n However, it has been noted that the fatality rate \r\nfrom accidents decreased to 17 per cent in 2004, \r\ncompared to 2003. That decrease was largely attributed \r\nto the Government’s unwavering efforts and its \r\ncommitment to addressing the problem in the interest \r\nof saving lives. \r\n Malaysia has indeed taken serious measures to \r\nimprove road safety and reduce fatalities. In 2004, the \r\nGovernment placed the issue of road safety on the \r\nnational agenda. Under that initiative and in order to \r\ngive specific attention to road safety, a separate \r\ndepartment for road safety was established in \r\nSeptember 2004 to address the issue. The department \r\nwas created to scrutinize all the efforts and activities \r\non the part of Government agencies and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations in Malaysia and to \r\nformulate strategies and recommendations aimed at \r\nreducing road traffic accidents. \r\n At the international and regional levels, Malaysia \r\ncontinues to be an active partner in the Global Road \r\nSafety Partnership under the aegis of the World Bank, \r\nthe World Road Association, the Association of \r\nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Land Transport and \r\nSafety Committee, the Road Engineering Association \r\nof Asia and Australasia and the ASEAN sub-working \r\ngroup on road transport and road safety. \r\n Malaysia welcomes the role of the United \r\nNations, especially the initiative of the Assembly to \r\nrelentlessly increase the awareness around the globe on \r\nthe need to address the issue of road traffic fatalities as \r\na global public health and a development problem. We \r\nsupport the involvement of the regional commissions, \r\nas well as other international agencies, to address the \r\nissue of road safety and assist national Governments in \r\ninstituting measures aimed at enhancing road safety in \r\ntheir respective countries. \r\n In that connection, we support many of the \r\nrecommendations presented in the WHO report to the \r\nAssembly, which, we believe, will be able to contribute \r\nto the promotion of road safety, particularly in \r\ndeveloping countries. We feel that the list of proposals \r\nand recommendations enumerated in the report was not \r\nexhaustive and that it would, therefore, be useful for \r\nMember States to continue to exchange ideas based on \r\nour respective experiences in dealing with the issue of \r\nroad safety in our countries.  \r\n It is also important for the General Assembly to \r\npay attention to the question of providing financial \r\nresources and technical assistance to the countries in \r\nneed of such assistance in order to enable them to \r\ndevelop the necessary infrastructure to avoid or \r\nminimize road traffic accidents. Assistance is also \r\nneeded to finance awareness campaigns among the \r\npopulation on road safety. Such assistance could, we \r\nbelieve, possibly save millions of lives and prevent \r\nunnecessary injuries. \r\n Road safety is a very important issue that \r\ncontinues to affect each and every one of us in one way \r\nor another. Unfortunately, however, in many instances \r\nthe issue has not been given due attention. Road traffic \r\naccidents are predictable and therefore preventable. In \r\norder to combat the problem, there needs to be close \r\ncoordination and collaboration, using a holistic and \r\nintegrated approach. Malaysia wishes to reiterate that \r\nthe United Nations should continue to play a major role \r\nin addressing this highly preventable but deadly public \r\nsafety issue. \r\n Mr. Southcott (Australia): Australia recognizes \r\nthe need for a strong international response to global \r\n A/60/PV.38\r\n \r\n05-57119 19 \r\n \r\nroad trauma and is delighted to support the draft \r\nresolution. We also wish to acknowledge the important \r\ncoordination role played by the World Health \r\nOrganization and the valuable framework for road \r\nsafety action provided by the Organization’s global \r\nreport on road traffic injury prevention (A/60/181). \r\n Road safety has a high profile in Australia and is \r\na prominent focus of public policy at all levels of \r\nGovernment. At the national level, we have a strategic \r\napproach that embraces many of the principles \r\nadvocated in the global report, including setting \r\nchallenging and measurable targets, monitoring \r\noutcomes, developing action plans based on thorough \r\nresearch and analysis and encouraging cross-sectoral \r\ncooperation.  \r\n The road toll in Australia is now one third of \r\nwhat it was in the 1960s. Over the last 35 years, the \r\napproaches that have been taken have included the \r\nmandatory use of seat belts and public education \r\ncampaigns focusing on the dangers of drink driving, \r\nspeed and fatigue in causing accidents. On public \r\nholidays, emergency workers and health professionals \r\nundertake a media campaign to make people aware of \r\nthe particular dangers that occur during these periods, \r\nwhen great numbers of people take to the roads. The \r\nroad infrastructure has been improved through greater \r\nuse of overtaking lanes, and on certain highways such \r\nas dual-carriage freeways.  \r\n Australia’s current goal is a 40 per cent reduction \r\nin the per capita fatality rate over the decade to 2010. \r\nWe have taken a broad-based approach to our task, \r\nrecognizing that substantial gains can only be achieved \r\nthrough a range of measures that address different parts \r\nof the road transport system. \r\n For example, we have road investment strategies \r\nthat accommodate both large road construction projects \r\nand highly targeted “black spot” projects. We are \r\nimproving the safety of our vehicle fleet through long-\r\nterm research and development programmes as well as \r\nongoing consumer awareness campaigns, and we are \r\nencouraging safer road user behaviour through a \r\ncombination of intensive enforcement efforts, \r\ngraduated licensing arrangements and public education \r\ncampaigns. \r\n I am pleased to report that Australia has made \r\ngood progress in the first four years of its 10-year \r\nstrategy. Between 2000 and 2004, our national fatality \r\nrate declined by 17 per cent, well on track towards \r\nachieving our 2010 target. But maintaining the \r\nmomentum is becoming increasingly difficult. There \r\nare already signs that we need to examine new ideas \r\nand adopt better practices if we are going to fulfil our \r\nobjective. \r\n Australia is keen to learn from the experiences of \r\nother countries. There is an enormous amount of road \r\nsafety activity around the world and a great deal of \r\naccumulated knowledge to draw upon. We have always \r\nvalued the opportunity to exchange information with \r\nour international colleagues and to collaborate on \r\nissues of common interest. We encourage others to take \r\na similar view. In that context, Australia acknowledges \r\nand applauds the draft resolution’s reaffirmed \r\ncommitment to international cooperation on road \r\nsafety. \r\n Mr. Hannesson (Iceland): I would like to thank \r\nthe Secretary-General for the progress report on the \r\nimplementation of resolution 58/289 (A/60/181). I \r\nwould also like to pay tribute to Oman for its \r\ndetermination, over a number of years, in bringing \r\nattention to a serious threat to personal security in the \r\nworld. \r\n The seriousness of the issue is clear from the \r\nstatistics. Nearly 1.2 million people die every year in \r\ntraffic accidents — that figure is comparable to death \r\nrates from malaria or HIV/AIDS, as previous speakers \r\nhave pointed out. At the same time, the solution to the \r\nproblem involves, to a large extent, persuading \r\nmotorists — many of us — to change our behaviour. \r\n Iceland has taken seriously the recommendations \r\nof the World report on road traffic injury prevention. \r\nUnlike many other countries, in Iceland the large \r\nmajority of road accident fatalities do not occur in the \r\ncity. Indeed, the accident rate in built-up areas has \r\ndeclined significantly over recent years, while three \r\nfourths of fatal accidents now occur in the countryside. \r\n Studies have confirmed other findings that \r\nattribute road accidents to a number of key factors, \r\nincluding speeding, driving under the influence of \r\nalcohol or drugs, failure to use seat belts and poor \r\ninfrastructure. In the light of that information, the \r\nIcelandic Ministry of Transport has developed a four-\r\nyear road safety improvement strategy which started \r\nlast spring. \r\n Thirteen thousand kilometres of roads stretch \r\nacross Iceland, which has a population of 300,000. \r\nA/60/PV.38  \r\n \r\n20 05-57119 \r\n \r\nThis means that resources need to be targeted carefully \r\nwhen improving road infrastructure. A cost-benefit \r\nsystem is thus used to assess where improvements are \r\nmost urgent. \r\n Last summer the Government of Iceland launched \r\nan initiative to reduce speeding and to improve seat \r\nbelt use on rural highways. A contract was drawn up \r\nwith the police to double their surveillance on those \r\nissues. In addition, special cameras were installed in \r\ncertain police vehicles. The campaign was carried out \r\nfrom June to September, as that is the time when roads \r\nare busiest. First results from that initiative have been \r\nvery positive. Average speed appears to have fallen — \r\nit is calculated that a drop of one kilometre per hour \r\naverage speed means a 3 per cent drop in the accident \r\nrate. \r\n The Icelandic authorities are now preparing a \r\nsimilar campaign against driving under the influence of \r\nalcohol and drugs, which will be applied year round. \r\nAlso in preparation is the establishment of a network of \r\nautomatic speed cameras, a longer-term project that \r\nrequires both technical preparation and possibly new \r\nlegislation. \r\n We know that the deaths of 1.2 million \r\nindividuals, however tragic, are only the tip of the \r\niceberg of suffering caused by traffic accidents. Traffic \r\naccidents have a major economic impact on many \r\nfamilies and thus on many national economies. Iceland \r\nis again proud to be a sponsor of the draft resolution, \r\nA/60/L.8, introduced earlier today by my friend, \r\nAmbassador Fuad Al-Hinai. \r\n Mr. Suárez Salvia (Argentina) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): The Argentine delegation has followed the \r\nleadership of the Sultanate of Oman through its \r\nMission here in the United Nations in the \r\nOrganization’s consideration of the topic of road \r\nsafety. As the statistics reveal, the phenomenon \r\nremains a genuine public health crisis and affects, in \r\nparticular, the most vulnerable populations in \r\ndeveloping countries.  \r\n There is an alarming projection by the World \r\nHealth Organization that shows that if we do not \r\nurgently act jointly, on a global level, by the year 2020, \r\nroad accidents may be the third cause of death and \r\ndisability, along with malaria, tuberculosis and \r\nHIV/AIDS. Many studies from different perspectives \r\nhave tried to promote and encourage greater \r\ncooperation, innovation and commitment to improve \r\nroad safety throughout the world. While the factors \r\ninvolved in road safety are many, all those studies \r\ncoincide in highlighting human, mechanical and \r\ninfrastructure causes as crucial.  \r\n It is true that many sectors have an important part \r\nto play in preventing deaths or injury caused by traffic \r\naccidents; hence the need to work together with civil \r\nsociety, the private sector and the academic \r\ncommunity. When a lack of skill, imprudence or fate \r\ntakes a life, that reminds us that in spite of the progress \r\nachieved by collectively tackling the issue of road \r\nsafety, both within and outside the United Nations \r\nsystem, the issue is still far from being considered a \r\nfully accomplished task.  \r\n Funding to reduce injuries caused by traffic \r\naccidents is not commensurate with the scope of the \r\nproblem and is generally not enough to carry out the \r\nnecessary awareness campaigns or set up the required \r\nmachinery to supervise, evaluate and monitor results. \r\n As stated in paragraph 2 of the report of the \r\nSecretary-General (A/60/181), \r\n“The international community must take the lead \r\nby assisting countries in identifying road safety \r\ninterventions that have been shown to be \r\neffective and in implementing them in their own \r\ncountries in a manner that is appropriate to each \r\ncultural setting”. \r\n In my country, Argentina, each province can, in \r\naccordance with a constitutional mandate, draft its own \r\ntraffic legislation. In order to avoid overlapping of \r\nstandards among the provinces, the National Congress, \r\nwhere the provinces are represented at the Senate level, \r\nenacted the National Traffic Law in 1995, supported by \r\nall the provinces. This law serves as a legal context and \r\nempowers the national authorities to exercise control in \r\ntraffic matters exclusively on national roads with \r\nregard to all matters related to the physical structure, \r\nmaintenance, control of concessions and permissible \r\ncarrying weights. Local authorities — provincial or \r\nmunicipal — exercise direct control over all other \r\naspects related to road traffic. \r\n The substantial and active participation of \r\nArgentine civil society in this field — its contribution \r\nis very broad-ranging and important — is chiefly \r\nchannelled through road traffic education at all levels. \r\n The fact that this forum has decided to discuss \r\nthis issue and that the number of sponsors in support of \r\n A/60/PV.38\r\n \r\n05-57119 21 \r\n \r\nthe draft resolution keeps increasing shows the \r\nconsiderable acceptance by the Member States of the \r\nfact that, if we are to find a solution to this crisis, good \r\nwill and commitment at the political level are \r\nindispensable. \r\n The part States will play at all levels is crucial to \r\nachieve road safety. We support this draft resolution \r\nand the various recommendations contained in the \r\nreport of the Secretary-General (document A/60/181) \r\nin order to accelerate the implementation throughout \r\nthe world of activities relating to road safety. If we \r\nfollow these recommendations, we might save more \r\nthan five million lives over the next 15 years. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on this item. \r\n The Assembly will now take a decision on draft \r\nresolution A/60/L.8, entitled “Improving global road \r\nsafety”. \r\n Before proceeding to take this decision, I should \r\nlike to announce that, since the introduction of the \r\ndraft resolution, the following countries have become \r\nsponsors of A/60/L.8: Belgium, France, Jamaica, \r\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya, Madagascar and Yemen. \r\n Mr. Al-Humaimidi (Iraq): My delegation would \r\nlike to join in the sponsorship of draft resolution \r\nA/60/L.8. \r\n Ms. Davtyan (Armenia): I would just like to note \r\nthat my delegation also wishes to join the list of \r\nsponsors for this draft resolution. \r\n Mrs. Pinto Lopes D’Alva (Guinea-Bissau): Our \r\ndelegation would like to join the list of sponsors for \r\ndraft resolution A/60/L.8. \r\n Mr. Filgueiras Rivero (Cuba) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): Our delegation would also like to add its \r\nname to the list of sponsors of the draft resolution. \r\n The Acting President: I would now request the \r\ndelegations concerned to approach the Secretariat and \r\nsign the necessary forms. \r\n May I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt \r\ndraft resolution A/60/L.8? \r\n Mr. Suárez Salvia (Argentina) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): Before taking action on the draft resolution, I \r\nwould like to make a few amendments to the Spanish \r\nversion, with your permission. \r\n The Acting President: I would request the \r\nrepresentative of Argentina to approach the Secretariat \r\nto submit in the amendments. \r\n May I take it that the Assembly is now ready to \r\nadopt draft resolution A/60/L.8? \r\n The draft resolution was adopted (resolution 60/5). \r\n The Acting President: May I take it that it is \r\nnow the wish of the General Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 60? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The meeting rose at 12.30 p.m. \r\n"
