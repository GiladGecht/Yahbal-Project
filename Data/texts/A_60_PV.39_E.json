(Sweden)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 74\r\nReport of the International Court of Justice\r\nReport of the International Court of Justice\r\n(A/60/4)\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/60/330)\r\nThe President: May I take it that the General\r\nAssembly takes note of the report of the International\r\nCourt of Justice for the period 1 August 2004 to 31\r\nJuly 2005?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In connection with this item the\r\nAssembly also has before it the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral (A/60/330) on the Secretary-General’s Trust\r\nFund to Assist States in the Settlement of Disputes\r\nthrough the International Court of Justice.\r\nIt is now my honour to call on Mr. Shi Jiuyong,\r\nPresident of the International Court of Justice, to\r\nintroduce the Court’s important report.\r\nMr. Shi Jiuyong: It is a privilege and an honour,\r\nin my capacity as President of the International Court\r\nof Justice, for me to address the General Assembly, for\r\nthe third time, on the occasion of its examination of the\r\nCourt’s report for the period 1 August 2004 to 31 July\r\n2005.\r\nYear after year, the General Assembly has\r\ndemonstrated its interest in, and support for, the Court\r\nby inviting its President to present to the Assembly a\r\nreview of the Court’s activities and achievements.\r\nMembers of the Court are very grateful for this\r\nopportunity. The Court indeed views the close\r\nexchanges between these two principal organs of the\r\nUnited Nations as a guarantee of the successful\r\naccomplishment of their respective tasks and of the\r\naims of the Organization.\r\nIt is also a particular pleasure to address the\r\nAssembly today under the presidency of Mr. Jan\r\nEliasson of Sweden, to whom I offer my warm\r\ncongratulations on his election as President of the\r\nsixtieth session of the General Assembly. He has my\r\nmost sincere wish for every success in his office. I\r\nshould like to commend him for his long-standing and\r\nactive commitment to the goals of the United Nations,\r\nand I applaud his determination to carry the process of\r\nreform of the Organization through its sixtieth\r\nanniversary and to ensure the follow-up and\r\nimplementation of the principles agreed on in the 2005\r\nWorld Summit Outcome document.\r\nThe Court has transmitted its annual report\r\n(A/60/4) to the Assembly, along with an introductory\r\nsummary. As the report is somewhat lengthy, I trust\r\nthat the following résumé will provide a useful\r\noverview of its essential elements.\r\nAs I reported last year, 191 States are parties to\r\nthe Statute of the Court, and 66 of them have accepted\r\n2\r\nA/60/PV.39\r\nthe compulsory jurisdiction of the Court in accordance\r\nwith Article 36, paragraph 2, of its Statute. In addition,\r\napproximately 300 treaties make reference to the Court\r\nin respect of the settlement of disputes arising from\r\ntheir application or interpretation.\r\nSince I addressed the Assembly in November\r\n2004, the Court has rendered final judgment in 10\r\ncases, with the judgments in all of the eight cases\r\nconcerning the legality of the use of force having been\r\nrendered simultaneously. Over the same period, the\r\nCourt has also held oral hearings in three cases. As a\r\nresult of the Court’s efforts, the total number of 21\r\ncases on the docket of the Court, which I reported to\r\nthe Assembly a year ago, had dropped to 11 by the end\r\nof the period under review. Today there are in fact 12\r\ncases on the General List, following the institution of\r\nproceedings by Costa Rica against Nicaragua, on 29\r\nSeptember 2005. I cannot but insist on how much has\r\nbeen accomplished since those not-so-distant times\r\nwhen there was talk of a serious backlog of cases at the\r\nCourt. Although it still represents a substantial amount\r\nof work, 12 cases is indeed a perfectly reasonable\r\nnumber of cases to have on the docket of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice.\r\nThe contentious cases pending before the Court\r\noriginate from all over the world: four between\r\nEuropean States, three between African States, three\r\nbetween Latin American States and one between Asian\r\nStates. In addition, there is one case of an\r\nintercontinental nature, namely, between Europe and\r\nAfrica.\r\nThe Court’s international character is also\r\nreflected in its composition. It currently has the benefit\r\nof members from Brazil, China, Egypt, France,\r\nGermany, Japan, Jordan, Madagascar, the Netherlands,\r\nthe Russian Federation, Sierra Leone, Slovakia, the\r\nUnited Kingdom, the United States of America and\r\nVenezuela.\r\nThe cases included on the docket over the last\r\nyear illustrate the variety of international disputes that\r\nare customarily referred to the Court. The Court is\r\naccustomed to handling territorial disputes between\r\nneighbouring States that are seeking the determination\r\nof their land and maritime boundaries or a decision in\r\nrespect of sovereignty over particular areas. Currently,\r\nthere are five such cases in the General List\r\nconcerning, respectively, Nicaragua and Honduras,\r\nNicaragua and Colombia, Malaysia and Singapore,\r\nRomania and Ukraine, and Costa Rica and Nicaragua.\r\nStates also regularly submit disputes to the Court\r\nconcerning the treatment of their nationals by other\r\nStates. That is the position in the present cases between\r\nGuinea and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and\r\nbetween the Republic of Congo and France. The last\r\ncase also raises issues relating to the jurisdictional\r\nimmunity of State officials.\r\nAnother category of cases that is frequently\r\nreferred to the Court concerns the use of force. Such\r\nproceedings often relate to events that have been\r\nbrought before the General Assembly or the Security\r\nCouncil. At the moment, the Court is deliberating on\r\ntwo cases against Uganda and Rwanda in which the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo contends that it has\r\nbeen the victim of armed attack. The Court is also\r\nseized of two cases in which Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nand Croatia have sought the condemnation of Serbia\r\nand Montenegro for violations of the 1948 United\r\nNations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment\r\nof the Crime of Genocide.\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, in the course of the period\r\nunder review, the Court rendered judgments in 10\r\ncases. I shall now deal with those decisions in\r\nchronological order.\r\nOn 15 December 2004, the Court handed down\r\nits judgments in the eight remaining cases concerning\r\nthe legality of the use of force, that is, the cases of\r\nSerbia and Montenegro v. Belgium, Serbia and\r\nMontenegro v. Canada, Serbia and Montenegro v.\r\nFrance, Serbia and Montenegro v. Germany, Serbia\r\nand Montenegro v. Italy, Serbia and Montenegro v.\r\nNetherlands, Serbia and Montenegro v. Portugal and\r\nSerbia and Montenegro v. United Kingdom. In each of\r\nthose cases the Court found unanimously that it had no\r\njurisdiction to entertain the claims made by Serbia and\r\nMontenegro.\r\nWhen bringing those cases — a total of 10 — in\r\n1999, Serbia and Montenegro, which at the time was\r\nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, alleged that each\r\nof the respondent States had committed acts by which\r\nit had violated its international obligation banning the\r\nuse of force against another State, the obligation not to\r\nintervene in the internal affairs of another State, the\r\nobligation not to violate the sovereignty of another\r\nState, the obligation to protect the civilian population\r\nand civilian objects in war time, the obligation to\r\n3\r\nA/60/PV.39\r\nprotect the environment, the obligation relating to free\r\nnavigation on international rivers, the obligation\r\nregarding fundamental human rights and freedoms, the\r\nobligation not to use prohibited weapons and the\r\nobligation not to deliberately inflict conditions of life\r\ncalculated to cause the physical destruction of a\r\nnational group.\r\nIn all 10 cases it invoked as a basis of the Court’s\r\njurisdiction article IX of the Convention on the\r\nPrevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide,\r\nwhich was adopted by the General Assembly on 9\r\nDecember 1948 and which is known as the Genocide\r\nConvention. In the six cases against Belgium, Canada,\r\nthe Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and the United\r\nKingdom, it also invoked Article 36, paragraph 2, of\r\nthe Statute of the Court, while in the four cases against\r\nFrance, Germany, Italy and the United States it invoked\r\nArticle 38, paragraph 5, of the Rules of the Court.\r\nMoreover, in the two cases against Belgium and the\r\nNetherlands, Serbia and Montenegro submitted a\r\nsupplement to the application invoking as a further\r\nbasis for the Court’s jurisdiction the provisions of a\r\nconvention on the settlement of disputes concluded\r\nwith each of those States in the early 1930s.\r\nBy Orders of 2 June 1999 concerning requests for\r\nprovisional measures submitted by Serbia and\r\nMontenegro in the cases against Spain and the United\r\nStates, the Court decided that those cases were to be\r\nremoved from the Court’s List for manifest lack of\r\njurisdiction. By Orders of the same date in the eight\r\nremaining cases, the Court stated that it lacked\r\njurisdiction prima facie. Subsequently, the respondent\r\nStates in those cases all submitted preliminary\r\nobjections relating to the Court’s jurisdiction to\r\nentertain the case and to the admissibility of the\r\nApplication.\r\nIn its Judgments of 15 December 2004, the Court\r\nobserved that the question of whether the Applicant\r\nwas or was not a State party to the Statute of the Court\r\nat the time of the institution of the proceedings was\r\nfundamental; for if it were not such a party, the Court\r\nwould not be open to it, unless it met the conditions\r\nprescribed in Article 35, paragraph 2, of the Statute.\r\nThe Court therefore had to examine whether the\r\nApplicant met the conditions for access to it laid down\r\nin Articles 34 and 35 of the Statute before examining\r\nthe issues relating to the conditions laid down in\r\nArticles 36 and 37 of the Statute.\r\nThe Court pointed out that there was no doubt\r\nthat Serbia and Montenegro was a State for the\r\npurposes of Article 34, paragraph 1, of the Statute.\r\nHowever, the objection had been raised by certain\r\nRespondents that, at the time when the Application was\r\nfiled, Serbia and Montenegro did not meet the\r\nconditions set down in Article 35, paragraph 1, of the\r\nStatute, because it was not a Member of the United\r\nNations at the relevant time. After recapitulating the\r\nsequence of events relating to the legal position of the\r\napplicant State vis-à-vis the United Nations, the Court\r\nconcluded that the legal situation that obtained within\r\nthe United Nations during the period 1992-2000\r\nconcerning the status of the Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia, following the break-up of the Socialist\r\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia, had remained\r\nambiguous and open to different assessments.\r\nThat situation had come to an end with a new\r\ndevelopment in 2000. On 27 October of that year, the\r\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia requested admission to\r\nmembership in the United Nations, and on\r\n1 November, by General Assembly resolution 55/12, it\r\nwas so admitted. The Applicant thus had the status of\r\nmembership in the Organization as from 1 November\r\n2000. However, its admission to the United Nations did\r\nnot have, and could not have had, the effect of dating\r\nback to the time when the Socialist Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia broke up and disappeared. The Court\r\ntherefore concluded that the Applicant thus was not a\r\nmember of the United Nations, and in that capacity a\r\nState party to the Statute of the International Court of\r\nJustice, at the time of filing its Application to institute\r\nthe proceedings in each of the cases before the Court\r\non 29 April 1999. As it had not become a party to the\r\nStatute on any other basis, the Court was not open to it\r\nat that time under Article 35, paragraph 1, of the\r\nStatute.\r\nThe Court then considered whether it might have\r\nbeen open to the applicant under Article 35, paragraph\r\n2. It noted that the words “treaties in force” in that\r\nparagraph of Article 35 were to be interpreted as\r\nreferring to treaties that were in force at the time that\r\nthe Statute itself came into force, and that\r\nconsequently, even assuming that the Applicant was a\r\nparty to the Genocide Convention when instituting\r\nproceedings, Article 35, paragraph 2, of the Statute did\r\nnot provide it with a basis for access to the Court under\r\narticle IX of that Convention, since the Convention\r\n4\r\nA/60/PV.39\r\nonly entered into force on 12 January 1951, after the\r\nentry into force of the Statute.\r\nIn the cases against Belgium and the Netherlands,\r\nthe Court finally examined the question of whether\r\nSerbia and Montenegro was entitled to invoke the\r\ndispute settlement convention it had concluded with\r\neach of those States in the early 1930s as a basis of\r\njurisdiction in those cases. The question was whether\r\nthe conventions dating from the early 1930s, which\r\nwere concluded prior to the entry into force of the\r\nStatute, might rank as a “treaty in force” for purposes\r\nof Article 35, paragraph 2, and hence provide a basis of\r\naccess to the Court.\r\nThe Court first recalled that Article 35 of the\r\nStatute of the Court concerns access to the present\r\nCourt and not to its predecessor, the Permanent Court\r\nof International Justice (PCIJ). It then observed that the\r\nconditions for the transfer of jurisdiction from the PCIJ\r\nto the present Court are governed by Article 37 of the\r\nStatute. The Court noted that Article 37 applies only as\r\nbetween parties to the Statute under Article 35,\r\nparagraph 1. As it had already found that Serbia and\r\nMontenegro was not a party to the Statute when\r\ninstituting proceedings, the Court accordingly found\r\nthat Article 37 could not give it access to the Court\r\nunder Article 35, paragraph 2, on the basis of the\r\nconventions dating from the early 1930s, irrespective\r\nof whether or not those instruments were in force on 29\r\nApril 1999, the date of the filing of the Application.\r\nIn each of its Judgments, the Court finally\r\nrecalled that, irrespective of whether it has jurisdiction\r\nover a dispute, the parties remained in all cases\r\nresponsible for acts attributable to them that violate the\r\nrights of other States.\r\nBarely a couple of months later, on 10 February\r\n2005, the Court rendered its Judgment on the\r\npreliminary objections to jurisdiction and admissibility\r\nraised by Germany in the case concerning Certain\r\nProperty (Liechtenstein v. Germany). It found that it\r\nhad no jurisdiction to entertain the Application filed by\r\nLiechtenstein.\r\nWhen, in 2001, Liechtenstein brought the case\r\nbefore the Court, it based the Court’s jurisdiction on\r\narticle 1 of the European Convention for the Peaceful\r\nSettlement of Disputes. Germany raised six\r\npreliminary objections to the jurisdiction of the Court\r\nand to the admissibility of Liechtenstein’s Application.\r\nThe historical context of that case was as follows.\r\nIn 1945 Czechoslovakia confiscated certain properties\r\nbelonging to Liechtenstein nationals, including to\r\nPrince Franz Josef II of Liechtenstein, pursuant to the\r\n“Beneš Decrees”, which authorized the confiscation of\r\nagricultural property — including buildings,\r\ninstallations and movable property — of all persons\r\nbelonging to the German and Hungarian people,\r\nregardless of their nationality. A special regime with\r\nregard to German external assets and other property\r\nseized in connection with the Second World War was\r\ncreated under the Convention on the Settlement of\r\nMatters Arising out of the War and the Occupation\r\n(chapter six), which was signed in 1952 at Bonn.\r\nIn 1991, a painting by the Dutch master Pieter\r\nvan Laer was lent by a museum in Brno,\r\nCzechoslovakia, to a museum in Cologne, Germany,\r\nfor inclusion in an exhibition. That painting had been\r\nthe property of the family of the Reigning Prince of\r\nLiechtenstein since the eighteenth century. It was\r\nconfiscated in 1945 by Czechoslovakia under the\r\nBeneš Decrees. Prince Hans-Adam II of Liechtenstein\r\nthen filed a lawsuit in the German courts in his\r\npersonal capacity to have the painting returned to him\r\nas his property, but that action was dismissed on the\r\nbasis that, under article 3, chapter six, of the\r\nSettlement Convention — an article whose paragraphs\r\n1 and 3 are still in force — no claim or action in\r\nconnection with measures taken against German\r\nexternal assets in the aftermath of the Second World\r\nWar was admissible in German courts. A claim brought\r\nby Prince Hans-Adam II before the European Court of\r\nHuman Rights concerning the decisions by the German\r\ncourts was also dismissed.\r\nThe Court, rejecting Germany’s first objection,\r\nfound that there existed a legal dispute between the\r\nparties and that it was whether, by applying article 3,\r\nchapter six, of the Settlement Convention to\r\nLiechtenstein property that had been confiscated by\r\nCzechoslovakia in 1945, Germany was in breach of the\r\ninternational obligations it owed to Liechtenstein and,\r\nif so, what was Germany’s international responsibility.\r\nGermany’s second objection required the Court to\r\ndecide, in the light of the provisions of article 27 (a) of\r\nthe European Convention for the Peaceful Settlement\r\nof Disputes, whether the dispute related to facts or\r\nsituations that arose before or after 18 February 1980,\r\nthe date on which that Convention entered into force\r\nbetween Germany and Liechtenstein. The Court noted\r\n5\r\nA/60/PV.39\r\nin that respect that it was not contested that the dispute\r\nwas triggered by the decisions of the German courts in\r\nthe aforementioned case. The critical issue, however,\r\nwas not the date when the dispute arose, but the date of\r\nthe facts or situations in relation to which the dispute\r\narose.\r\nIn the Court’s view, the dispute brought before it\r\ncould only relate to the events that transpired in the\r\n1990s if, as argued by Liechtenstein, in that period,\r\nGermany either departed from a previous common\r\nposition that the Settlement Convention did not apply\r\nto Liechtenstein property, or if German courts, by\r\napplying their earlier case law under the Settlement\r\nConvention for the first time to Liechtenstein property,\r\napplied that Convention to a new situation after the\r\ncritical date.\r\nHaving found that neither was the case, the Court\r\nconcluded that, although those proceedings were\r\ninstituted by Liechtenstein as a result of decisions by\r\nGerman courts concerning a painting by Pieter van\r\nLaer, those events have their source in specific\r\nmeasures taken by Czechoslovakia in 1945, which led\r\nto the confiscation of property owned by some\r\nLiechtenstein nationals, including Prince Franz Jozef II\r\nof Liechtenstein, as well as in the special regime\r\ncreated by the Settlement Convention; and that the\r\nsource or real cause of the dispute was accordingly to\r\nbe found in the Settlement Convention and the Beneš\r\nDecrees. In the light of the provisions of article 27 (a)\r\nof the European Convention for the Peaceful\r\nSettlement of Disputes, the Court therefore upheld\r\nGermany’s second preliminary objection, finding that it\r\ncould not rule on Liechtenstein’s claims on the merits.\r\nFinally, on 12 July 2005, the Chamber of the\r\nCourt formed to deal with the case concerning the\r\nFrontier Dispute (Benin/Niger) rendered its Judgment.\r\nBy that Judgment, it first determined the course of the\r\nboundary between the two parties in the sector of the\r\nRiver Niger, decided which of the islands situated in\r\nthe River Niger belonged to each of the parties, and\r\nfixed the boundary line on two bridges in the River\r\nNiger. The Chamber further determined the course of\r\nthe boundary between the parties in the sector of the\r\nRiver Mekrou.\r\nAfter outlining the geographical context and\r\nhistorical background to the dispute between those two\r\nformer colonies, which were part of French West\r\nAfrica until their accession to independence, in August\r\n1960, the Chamber addressed the law applicable to the\r\ndispute. It stated that that law includes the principle of\r\nthe intangibility of the boundaries inherited from\r\ncolonization or the principle of uti possidetis juris,\r\nwhose primary aim is to secure respect for the\r\nterritorial boundaries at the moment when\r\nindependence is achieved. The Chamber found that on\r\nthe basis of that principle it had to seek to determine,\r\nin that case, the boundary that was inherited from the\r\nFrench administration. It noted that the parties agreed\r\nthat the dates to be taken into account for that purpose\r\nwere those of their respective independence, namely, 1\r\nand 3 August 1960.\r\nThe Chamber then considered the course of the\r\nboundary in the River Niger sector. It first examined\r\nthe various regulative or administrative acts invoked by\r\nthe parties in support of their respective claims, and\r\nconcluded that neither of the parties has succeeded in\r\nproviding evidence of title on the basis of those acts\r\nduring the colonial period. In accordance with the\r\nprinciple that, where no legal title exists, the\r\neffectivités must invariably be taken into consideration,\r\nthe Chamber further examined the evidence presented\r\nby the parties regarding the effective exercise of\r\nauthority on the ground during the colonial period, in\r\norder to determine the course of the boundary in the\r\nRiver Niger sector and to indicate to which of the two\r\nStates each of the islands in the river belongs, and in\r\nparticular the island of Lété.\r\nOn the basis of that evidence in respect of the\r\nperiod 1914 to 1954, the Chamber concluded that there\r\nwas a modus vivendi between the local authorities of\r\nDahomey and Niger in the region concerned, whereby\r\nboth parties regarded the main navigable channel of the\r\nriver as constituting the intercolonial boundary. The\r\nChamber observed that, pursuant to that modus vivendi,\r\nNiger exercised its administrative authority over the\r\nislands located to the left of the main navigable\r\nchannel, including the island of Lété, and Dahomey\r\nover those located to the right of that channel. The\r\nChamber noted that the entitlement of Niger to\r\nadminister the island of Lété was sporadically called\r\ninto question for practical reasons, but was neither\r\nlegally nor factually contested. With respect to the\r\nislands located opposite the town of Gaya, Niger, the\r\nChamber noted that, on the basis of the modus vivendi,\r\nthose islands were considered to fall under the\r\njurisdiction of Dahomey. It therefore followed, in the\r\nview of the Chamber, that in that sector of the river the\r\n6\r\nA/60/PV.39\r\nboundary was regarded as passing to the left of those\r\nthree islands.\r\nThe Chamber found that the situation was less\r\nclear in the period between 1954 and 1960. However,\r\non the basis of the evidence submitted by the parties, it\r\ncould not conclude that the administration of the island\r\nof Lété, which before 1954 was undoubtedly carried\r\nout by Niger, was effectively transferred to or taken\r\nover by Dahomey.\r\nThe Chamber concluded from the foregoing that\r\nthe boundary between Benin and Niger in that sector\r\nfollows the main navigable channel of the River Niger\r\nas it existed at the dates of independence, it being\r\nunderstood that in the vicinity of the three islands\r\nopposite Gaya the boundary passes to the left of those\r\nislands. Consequently, Benin has title to the islands\r\nsituated between the boundary thus defined and the\r\nright bank of the river, and Niger has title to the islands\r\nbetween that boundary and the left bank of the river.\r\nIn order to determine the precise location of the\r\nboundary line in the main navigable channel, namely,\r\nthe line of deepest soundings, as it existed at the dates\r\nof independence, the Chamber based itself on a report\r\nprepared in 1970 at the request of the Governments of\r\nDahomey, Mali, Niger and Nigeria by the Dutch\r\ncompany Netherlands Engineering Consultants. In the\r\nJudgment, the Chamber specified the coordinates of\r\n154 points through which the boundary between Benin\r\nand Niger passes in that sector, and determined to\r\nwhich party each of the 25 islands of the river belongs,\r\non the basis of the boundary line as described above. It\r\nstated, inter alia, that Lété Goungou belongs to Niger.\r\nFinally, the Chamber concluded that the Special\r\nAgreement also conferred jurisdiction upon it to\r\ndetermine the line of the boundary on the bridges\r\nbetween Gaya and Malanville. It found that the\r\nboundary on those structures follows the course of the\r\nboundary in the River Niger.\r\nIn the second part of its Judgment, dealing with\r\nthe western section of the boundary between Benin and\r\nNiger, in the sector of the River Mekrou, the Chamber\r\nexamined the various documents relied on by the\r\nparties in support of their respective claims. It\r\nconcluded that, notwithstanding the existence of a legal\r\ntitle of 1907 relied on by Niger in support of the\r\nboundary which it claims, it was clear that, at least\r\nfrom 1927 onwards, the competent administrative\r\nauthorities regarded the course of the Mekrou as the\r\nintercolonial boundary separating Dahomey from\r\nNiger, that those authorities reflected that boundary in\r\nthe successive instruments promulgated by them after\r\n1927 — some of which expressly indicated that\r\nboundary while others necessarily implied it — and\r\nthat that was the state of the law at the dates of\r\nindependence in August 1960. The Chamber concluded\r\nthat in the River Mekrou sector the boundary between\r\nBenin and Niger is constituted by the median line of\r\nthat river.\r\nAs well as delivering those Judgments, the Court\r\nhas completed the hearings on the merits in the case\r\nconcerning Armed Activities on the Territory of the\r\nCongo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Uganda).\r\nIn addition, hearings on the preliminary objections of\r\nRwanda have recently taken place in the case\r\nconcerning Armed Activities on the Territory of the\r\nCongo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Rwanda).\r\nBoth cases are currently under deliberation.\r\nThe achievements of the Court during the period\r\nunder review reflect its commitment to dealing with\r\ncases as promptly and efficiently as possible while\r\nmaintaining the quality of its judgments and respecting\r\nthe consensual nature of its jurisdiction.\r\nA recurrent theme of my interventions before the\r\nGeneral Assembly has been the intensity of the work\r\naccomplished by the Court. It is not always easy for the\r\npublic to imagine what is happening behind the walls\r\nand gates of the Peace Palace in The Hague. Faced\r\nwith a continuously growing caseload, the Court has\r\nmade tremendous efforts in the last decade to increase\r\nits judicial efficiency while maintaining its high quality\r\nof work. The Court has modernized the organization of\r\nits Registry, reviewed and adapted its internal working\r\nmethods, promulgated Practice Directions for the\r\nparties and even modified its Rules where necessary.\r\nFar from resting on its laurels, the Court keeps its\r\nworking methods constantly under review. It is not\r\nwithout satisfaction that I can tell the Assembly that\r\nthose efforts have already begun to bear fruit.\r\nThe level of activity displayed by the Court over\r\nthe past years is, simply put, unprecedented in its\r\nhistory. That success story would not have been\r\npossible without the help of the General Assembly, and\r\nthe Court is thankful for the support it has given it in\r\nthe past. The task ahead of the Court is, however, still\r\nconsiderable. It is therefore essential that that support\r\nbe maintained.\r\n7\r\nA/60/PV.39\r\nIn that regard, it is important to remember that\r\nthe budget of the Court represents less than one per\r\ncent of the total budget of the United Nations. The\r\nCourt is fully aware of the difficult budgetary\r\nconditions in which the Organization finds itself, and\r\nrecognizes its own responsibility to apply its funds\r\nwisely. In its budgetary request for the biennium 2006-\r\n2007, which is currently under consideration, the Court\r\nhas made every effort to restrict itself to proposals that\r\nare financially modest, but also of the utmost\r\nsignificance for the implementation of key aspects of\r\nits work. The Court hopes that those budgetary\r\nproposals will meet with the Assembly’s agreement,\r\nthereby enabling the principal judicial organ of the\r\nUnited Nations better to serve the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nThe Court was established by the Charter in\r\npursuance of one of the primary purposes of the United\r\nNations: to bring about by peaceful means, and in\r\nconformity with the principles of justice and\r\ninternational law, adjustment or settlement of\r\ninternational disputes or situations which might lead to\r\na breach of the peace. As we approach the sixtieth\r\nanniversary of the International Court of Justice, which\r\nwill take place next year, the popularity of the Court as\r\na dispute resolution mechanism continues to grow.\r\nMore and more States are beginning to realize how the\r\nInternational Court of Justice can serve them and are\r\ntrusting it to resolve their disputes with other nations.\r\nThe issues that States have asked the Court to\r\nresolve are likewise many and varied. In the past three\r\nyears alone, the Court has decided cases relating to\r\nmatters as diverse as land, fluvial and maritime\r\nboundaries, the ownership of property seized during\r\nthe Second World War, human rights violations, the\r\naccess of foreign nationals to consular assistance,\r\nfreedom of commerce and the use of force, to name but\r\na few. It has thus become clear to the international\r\ncommunity that the International Court of Justice, as\r\nthe principal judicial organ of the United Nations, has a\r\ncrucial and primary role to play in the peaceful\r\nsettlement of international disputes and in the\r\npromotion and application of international law.\r\nI would like to stress the point that, as was\r\nemphasized in the Manila Declaration on the Peaceful\r\nSettlement of International Disputes of 1982, recourse\r\nto the judicial settlement of legal disputes —\r\nparticularly referral to the International Court of\r\nJustice — should not be considered an unfriendly act\r\nbetween States. To the contrary, experience has shown\r\nthat recourse to the Court is a pacifying measure.\r\nIt is important, in that regard, to remember that\r\nthe Court is the only international judicial body to\r\npossess general jurisdiction, which enables it to deal\r\nwith any issue relating to international law and to take\r\ninto account developments in international law across\r\nthe entire spectrum of international relations. The\r\nCourt is thus ideally equipped to settle quickly and\r\ndurably, at a minimum cost, any type of legal dispute,\r\nwhatever its nature and the type of solution pursued,\r\nand regardless of the status of the relationship between\r\nthe litigant parties.\r\nThe role that the Court plays was highlighted by\r\nthe Secretary-General in his recent report “In larger\r\nfreedom” (A/59/2005), in which he described the\r\nInternational Court of Justice as lying at the centre of\r\nthe international system for adjudicating disputes\r\namong States. The heads of State and Government\r\ngathered for the 2005 world summit echoed that\r\nstatement when they recognized the important role of\r\nthe International Court of Justice, the principal judicial\r\norgan of the United Nations, in adjudicating disputes\r\namong States, and the value of its work.\r\nThe Court welcomes those kind words of\r\nappreciation. It also wholeheartedly welcomes the\r\nsuggestion of the Secretary-General that in order to\r\nreinforce the Court and to make it more efficient,\r\nStates that have not yet done so need to consider\r\nrecognizing the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court\r\nand that the recourse to the advisory powers of the\r\nCourt by the duly authorized United Nations organs\r\nand specialized agencies should be increased. With the\r\nsupport of the General Assembly, the International\r\nCourt of Justice will pursue its efforts to prove worthy\r\nof the hopes that have been placed in it and to continue\r\nto accomplish the mission that was attributed to it 60\r\nyears ago by the drafters of the Charter.\r\nIt remains for me to thank members for their\r\nattention and for their interest in the International\r\nCourt of Justice.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice for his strong words in\r\nsupport and encouragement of my tasks to promote\r\nreform of the Organization and to ensure the\r\nimplementation of the principles agreed in the outcome\r\ndocument (resolution 60/1) of the 2005 world summit.\r\n8\r\nA/60/PV.39\r\nBefore I give the floor to the next speaker, I\r\nwould like to echo and reaffirm the President’s view\r\nthat it has become clear to the international community\r\nthat the International Court of Justice, as the principal\r\njudicial organ of the United Nations, has a crucial and\r\nprimary role to play in the peaceful settlement of\r\ninternational disputes and in the promotion and\r\napplication of international law, and furthermore that\r\nexperience has shown that recourse to the Court is a\r\npacifying measure.\r\nHere, I would like to recall paragraph 73 of the\r\nsummit outcome document, which emphasizes the\r\nobligation of States to settle their disputes by peaceful\r\nmeans in accordance with Chapter VI of the Charter,\r\nincluding, when appropriate, by the use of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice. I also want to recall\r\nparagraph 134 (f) of the same document, in which our\r\nleaders at the summit recognized\r\n“the important role of the International Court of\r\nJustice, the principal judicial organ of the United\r\nNations, in adjudicating disputes among States\r\nand the value of its work, call upon States that\r\nhave not yet done so to consider accepting the\r\njurisdiction of the Court in accordance with its\r\nStatute and consider means of strengthening the\r\nCourt’s work, including by supporting the\r\nSecretary-General’s Trust Fund to Assist States in\r\nthe Settlement of Disputes through the\r\nInternational Court of Justice on a voluntary\r\nbasis.”\r\nThis morning’s statement by the President of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice is an important and\r\ntimely reminder of the principles laid down and the\r\npositions taken in the 2005 World Summit Outcome\r\ndocument.\r\nI now give the floor to the representative of New\r\nZealand, who will speak on behalf of the CANZ Group\r\nof countries.\r\nMr. McIvor (New Zealand): Let me first express,\r\non behalf of Canada, Australia and my own country,\r\nNew Zealand, thanks to the President of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice, Judge Shi Jiuyong, for\r\nhis insightful and comprehensive report on the work of\r\nthe Court over the past year. His presentation this\r\nmorning highlights the valuable role that the Court\r\nplays in contributing to the peaceful resolution of\r\ndisputes between States and to the development of\r\ninternational law.\r\nUniversal adherence to the international rule of\r\nlaw is crucial for a peaceful world. As countries that\r\nfirmly believe in the rule of law, we were pleased to\r\nsee that principle resoundingly endorsed by the world’s\r\nleaders at their summit last month. The International\r\nCourt of Justice is central to ensuring that the rule of\r\nlaw is maintained and strengthened at the international\r\nlevel, and for that reason the Court deserves our\r\nunwavering support.\r\nCanada, Australia and New Zealand have always\r\nbeen, and will continue to be, strong supporters of the\r\nprincipal judicial organ of the United Nations: the\r\nInternational Court of Justice. Our confidence in the\r\nCourt and in its continuing ability to render considered\r\njudgments on complex international legal issues is\r\nreflected in our acceptance of the Court’s compulsory\r\njurisdiction, in accordance with article 36, paragraph 2,\r\nof the Statute of the Court.\r\nWe would encourage other Members of the\r\nUnited Nations that have not yet done so to deposit\r\nwith the Secretary-General a declaration of acceptance\r\nof the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction.\r\nCANZ welcomes the Court’s official handling of\r\nthe cases before it and the steps it continues to take to\r\nimprove its working methods in that regard. We are\r\npleased to see that, over the 2004-2005 period, the\r\nCourt disposed of 10 cases and that the caseload now\r\nsits at 11.\r\nGone are the days when the Court’s docket was\r\nvirtually empty. The increased willingness of States to\r\nturn to judicial settlement of their disputes must be\r\nwelcomed and is testimony of the ever-growing faith in\r\nthe decisions of the Court and in the rule of law by the\r\ninternational community.\r\nIn recent times, other courts have been created to\r\nhandle specific issues, such as the International\r\nTribunal for the Law of the Sea, the International\r\nCriminal Court and the ad hoc international criminal\r\nTribunals for the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda.\r\nCANZ supports the work of those courts, which\r\ncontribute to the application and strengthening of the\r\nrule of law.\r\nThe International Court of Justice, however,\r\nretains its place as the only international Court of\r\nuniversal character and general jurisdiction. All States\r\nare equal before the Court, regardless of their size. It is\r\n9\r\nA/60/PV.39\r\nimportant for smaller States to have access to such\r\nimpartial means to resolve their disputes.\r\nCANZ looks forward to the International Court of\r\nJustice’s continuing to play its vital role in the peaceful\r\nsettlement of international disputes and in\r\nstrengthening the international legal order, as mandated\r\nby the United Nations Charter.\r\nMr. Sardenberg, Vice-President (Brazil), took the\r\nChair.\r\nMr. Liu Zhenmin (China) (spoke in Chinese): It\r\ngives the Chinese delegation great pleasure to speak on\r\nthe agenda item under discussion.\r\nAt the outset, allow me, on behalf of the Chinese\r\ndelegation, to thank Judge Shi Jiuyong, President of\r\nthe International Court of Justice, for his report on the\r\nwork of the Court.\r\nIn the view of the Chinese delegation, the\r\nsettlement of international disputes by peaceful means,\r\nincluding resort to the International Court of Justice,\r\nconstitutes an important avenue towards the realization\r\nof the purposes of the United Nations, namely the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nThe International Court of Justice, one of the six\r\nprincipal organs of the United Nations, is indispensable\r\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nAt the same time, the Court, as the judicial organ of the\r\nUnited Nations, by exercising its jurisdiction and\r\nissuing advisory opinions, plays a vital role in the\r\nclarification, affirmation, application and development\r\nof the norms and principles of international law.\r\nThe Chinese delegation is pleased to see that,\r\nover the past 60 years, the International Court of\r\nJustice has disposed of more than 90 cases and handed\r\ndown close to 100 decisions and judgments in cases\r\ncovering the delimitation of land and maritime\r\nboundaries, territorial sovereignty, the obligation not to\r\nuse force, the obligation not to interfere in the internal\r\naffairs of other States, diplomatic relations, anti-\r\nkidnapping, asylum, nationality, the right of passage,\r\nand economic rights.\r\nIn addition, the Court has issued 25 advisory\r\nopinions ranging from applications for membership in\r\nthe United Nations, certain operational costs of the\r\nUnited Nations, application of United Nations\r\nheadquarters agreements, the legality of the use of the\r\nthreat of the use of nuclear weapons, to the legal\r\nconsequences of the construction of a separation wall\r\nin the occupied Palestinian territories. Through these\r\njudicial activities, the Court has facilitated the\r\ndevelopment of international law.\r\nWe have also noted that the workload of the\r\nCourt has significantly increased as it gains broader\r\nrecognition by, and the confidence of, the international\r\ncommunity. Consequently, the difficulties faced by the\r\nCourt in terms of its personnel and financial resources\r\nare becoming more pronounced. We appeal to all\r\nMembers of the United Nations to devote greater\r\nattention to that question and to do their best to ensure\r\nthat the Court can function normally, so that it can play\r\nits role fully.\r\nThe Chinese delegation believes that the Court,\r\nlike other organs of the United Nations system, can\r\nbenefit from United Nations reform. A dynamic Court\r\nwill surely be able to contribute significantly to a more\r\npeaceful world.\r\nThe Chinese Government is of the view that,\r\nalthough peace and development are the dominant\r\nthemes of our times, international relations and the\r\ndevelopment of the international community as a whole\r\nare susceptible to the effects of sources of instability\r\nand uncertainty that still remain and to the new\r\nchallenges and threats that emerge from time to time.\r\nHarmony among peoples, harmony between\r\nhumankind and nature, and the peaceful coexistence of\r\nStates all should be governed and safeguarded by the\r\nrule of law. We are confident that the International\r\nCourt of Justice will continue to play an important role\r\nin the peaceful settlement of international disputes, the\r\npromotion of the rule of law at the international level\r\nand in the building of a harmonious community of\r\nnations.\r\nChina will continue to support the work of the\r\nCourt. It is our hope that the Court will make an even\r\ngreater contribution to the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security, the promotion of friendly\r\nexchanges among countries, and the development of\r\ninternational law.\r\nMr. Ketwah (Malaysia): My delegation wishes to\r\nthank Judge Shi Jiuyong, President of the International\r\nCourt of Justice, for his lucid presentation of the report\r\nof the Court (A/60/4). That comprehensive report\r\ncontains useful information on the work of the\r\n10\r\nA/60/PV.39\r\nInternational Court of Justice and provides a better\r\nunderstanding of the complex issues before it.\r\nWe appreciate the important contribution made\r\nby the International Court of Justice to the peaceful\r\nsettlement of disputes between States and the\r\ndevelopment of international law. Indeed, the peaceful\r\nsettlement of disputes is one of the fundamental pillars\r\nof the United Nations. We acknowledge the fact that\r\nthe International Court of Justice has tremendous\r\ninfluence in the promotion of peace and harmony\r\nbetween the States and peoples of the world through\r\nthe rule of law. The International Court of Justice plays\r\nan important role in resolving disputes submitted by\r\nStates and in handing down advisory opinions on legal\r\nquestions referred to it in accordance with international\r\nlaw. That role should not be underestimated in the\r\ncommon endeavour of promoting peace among nations.\r\nThe Court provides a prudent and civilized alternative\r\nto violence and the use of force. Judicial decisions as\r\nsuch are not a source of law, but the Court’s dicta are\r\nunanimously considered the best formulation of the\r\ncontent of international law in force.\r\nWe are pleased to note the marked progression in\r\nthe caseload of the Court since its inception. During\r\nthe period from 1 August 2004 to 31 July 2005, there\r\nwere 21 important cases before the Court. Those\r\ncontentious cases come from all over the world, and\r\ntheir subject matter varies from cases concerning\r\nterritorial disputes between neighbouring States\r\nseeking a determination of their land and maritime\r\nboundaries, or a decision as to which of them has\r\nsovereignty over particular areas, to applications\r\nregarding the crime of genocide. That is testimony to\r\nthe growing confidence of States in the work of the\r\nCourt and to the willingness of the international\r\ncommunity to be governed by the principles of\r\ninternational law in the conduct of international\r\nrelations.\r\nThe Court has handed down judgments and\r\nopinions of excellent quality. The acceptance of those\r\njudgments and opinions by the parties concerned is\r\nclear evidence of the preference of States to avail\r\nthemselves of the wisdom of the Court in order to\r\nresolve disputes peacefully. Such increasing recourse\r\nby States to the judicial settlement of their disputes has\r\nmade the Court central to the administration of\r\ninternational justice. Confidence in the role, functions\r\nand accomplishments of the Court has strengthened\r\nMalaysia’s belief that the Court is the most appropriate\r\nforum for the peaceful and final resolution of disputes\r\nwhen all diplomatic efforts have been exhausted.\r\nMalaysia was a recent client of the International\r\nCourt of Justice. On 2 November 1998, Malaysia and\r\nIndonesia submitted to the Court their territorial\r\ndispute over the islands of Ligitan and Sipadan. The\r\nCourt issued its judgement on 17 December 2002, and\r\nboth parties accepted it as final and binding. Both\r\ncountries were satisfied that the entire legal process to\r\nresolve the dispute through the International Court of\r\nJustice had taken place in a fair, transparent,\r\nresponsible and dignified manner. That is indeed\r\ntestimony to the confidence that both countries place in\r\nthe Court’s ability to resolve international disputes in\r\nconformity with the principles of justice and\r\ninternational law.\r\nWith regard to the territorial dispute with\r\nSingapore concerning sovereignty over Pulau Batu\r\nPuteh, Middle Rocks and South Ledge, currently on the\r\nCourt’s docket, we wish to assure the Assembly that,\r\nconsistent with its abiding respect for international law,\r\nMalaysia will fully respect the Court’s decision on the\r\ncase. Such respect for the Court’s decision will help to\r\nenhance the Court’s stature and prestige among\r\nMember States and will in turn inculcate a culture of\r\nrespect for international law in relations among States.\r\nMy delegation takes note of the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the Secretary-General’s Trust\r\nFund to Assist States in the Settlement of Disputes\r\nthrough the International Court of Justice (A/60/330).\r\nWe note the Secretary-General’s appeal to all States\r\nand other relevant entities to give serious consideration\r\nto making contributions to the Fund, which has had a\r\ndecreasing level of resources since its inception. We\r\nalso note the revision of the Fund’s terms of reference.\r\nMalaysia commends the Court for its efforts to\r\nincrease public awareness and understanding of its\r\nwork in the judicial settlement of international disputes\r\nand its advisory functions, case law and working\r\nmethods, as well as its role within the United Nations\r\nthrough its publications and through lectures by the\r\nPresident and members of the Court, the Registrar and\r\nmembers of the Registry staff. We welcome the Court’s\r\ndistribution of press releases, of background notes and\r\nof its handbook to keep the public informed about its\r\nwork, functions and jurisdiction. We agree that the\r\nCourt’s website has been extremely useful and well\r\nutilized by diplomats, lawyers, academics, students and\r\n11\r\nA/60/PV.39\r\ninterested members of the public as an important\r\nsource of access to the Court’s judgments, which\r\nconstitute the most recent developments in\r\ninternational case law. We hope that the Court will be\r\nprovided with adequate resources so that it can\r\ncontinue to fulfil its mandate and meet the demands of\r\nan increasing workload.\r\nMr. Hatch (Sri Lanka): I wish to express the\r\nsincere appreciation of my delegation to Judge Shi\r\nJiuyong, President of the International Court of Justice,\r\nfor his excellent presentation of the comprehensive\r\nreport of the Court covering the period 1 August 2004\r\nto 31 July 2005 (A/60/4).\r\nThe International Court of Justice is the principal\r\njudicial organ of the United Nations, dispensing justice\r\nwithin the jurisdiction assigned to it. The Court is\r\nempowered under the Charter and the Court’s Statute\r\nto decide disputes freely submitted by States in the\r\nexercise of their sovereignty and to render advisory\r\nopinions. The International Court of Justice is unique,\r\nbecause it has the capacity to deal with disputes of the\r\ninternational community, thereby not only developing\r\nthe rule of law, but also securing the pacific settlement\r\nof international disputes.\r\nThe dramatic increase in the number of disputes\r\nnow being referred to the Court, when compared with\r\nthe 1970s, is a clear manifestation of the confidence of\r\nthe international community in the Court’s discharge of\r\nits functions. We note with great satisfaction, in that\r\nregard, that during the period under review, the Court\r\nhas disposed of 10 cases, while 11 are still pending. We\r\nalso note with satisfaction that the Court is continually\r\nadopting measures to improve its judicial efficiency,\r\nnotwithstanding the increased volume and complexity\r\nof its workload.\r\nCases have been referred to the Court from all\r\nregions, and it is noted that the subject matter of those\r\ncases is extremely rich and varied. They currently\r\ncover complex issues, such as the legality of the use of\r\nforce, the determination of land and maritime\r\nboundaries between neighbouring States, the\r\napplication of the Genocide Convention, the treatment\r\nof aliens in foreign jurisdictions and other issues. The\r\nCourt has also ably dealt with extremely intricate\r\nissues concerning the admissibility of cases in the\r\ncontext of its own jurisdiction. The Court’s\r\ndeterminations will undoubtedly make an important\r\ncontribution to the development of international legal\r\nprinciples in those critical areas and will also\r\ncontribute to the enrichment of the law.\r\nThe confidence placed in the Court by States is\r\nundoubtedly interlinked with the continuously evolving\r\nnature of international law. That evolution has taken on\r\na new dimension in recent decades. The Court has been\r\naware of the importance of that aspect and of the\r\nadaptation of international law to present-day needs,\r\nwhich enhances friendly relations among States.\r\nThe case law of the International Court of Justice\r\nis an important aspect in the attainment of the\r\nobjectives of the United Nations. Its judgments and\r\nadvisory opinions not only have an impact on the\r\ninternational legal system, but also have a significant\r\nimpact on the judicial decisions of States and on the\r\ndevelopment of their municipal law.\r\nFor example, the concurring opinion of the then-\r\nVice President of the Court, Judge C.G. Weeramantry,\r\nto the judgment of the Court in the Danube dam case of\r\n25 September 1997 was subsequently cited with\r\napproval by the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka — which\r\nis the apex court — in its June 2000 decision in the\r\ncase of Bulankulama and six others v. Ministry of\r\nIndustrial Development and seven others. That case\r\ndealt with important issues of environmental law in the\r\ncontext of an application under the chapter on\r\nfundamental rights of the Sri Lanka Constitution.\r\nIndeed, that opinion of the International Court of\r\nJustice drew in turn on the rich heritage of wisdom and\r\nprinciples enunciated in ancient texts of numerous\r\ncivilizations on the need to preserve the environment in\r\nseeking to strike a balance between the competing\r\nneeds of development and preservation of the\r\nenvironment, thus manifesting harmonious interplay\r\nbetween and the mutual enrichment of municipal and\r\ninternational law.\r\nIn that connection, it is relevant to recall the\r\ninvaluable contribution made by the then Vice\r\nPresident of the Court, Judge C.G. Weeramantry of Sri\r\nLanka, to the jurisprudence of the Court, particularly in\r\nrelation to international environmental law.\r\nIt is also noteworthy that the ICJ is also called\r\nupon to determine disputes under various bilateral and\r\nmultilateral treaties, thereby strengthening this\r\ninstrument as an important vehicle in promoting the\r\nwider objectives of the United Nations.\r\n12\r\nA/60/PV.39\r\nThe Court has also, over the last 50 years, made\r\nan important contribution to the progressive\r\ndevelopment of international law in other fields of\r\nimportance to States. These include issues having\r\neconomic implications such as those relating to foreign\r\ninvestment. In the process, the Court has also\r\ncontributed to the development of principles governing\r\nState responsibility.\r\nMy delegation wishes to express its appreciation\r\nto the Court for its role in the pacific settlement of\r\ndisputes and for its contribution to the development of\r\ninternational law. In turn, full implementation of the\r\ndecisions of the Court will enhance the role and\r\ncredibility of the Court.\r\nWe also welcome the steady progress made by the\r\nCourt in the dissemination of information on its work\r\nthrough various forms. The distribution of information\r\nby electronic means, in particular through the Internet,\r\nis a major achievement. The Court’s web site is a\r\nvaluable tool for the wider dissemination of its work,\r\nwhich will not only further enhance the development of\r\nthe law but also the objectives of the United Nations.\r\nIn view of the importance of the use of information\r\ntechnology in the work of the Court, my delegation\r\nurges Member States to consider providing greater\r\nmeans to improve and expand those facilities. That is\r\nof particular importance to academics, practitioners\r\nand law students from developing countries.\r\nFor more than half a century, the Court has\r\nplayed an important role in settling disputes between\r\nStates as well as rendering advisory opinions on legal\r\nquestions referred to it. My delegation has full\r\nconfidence in the Court’s continued ability to discharge\r\nits functions under the Charter and Statute. During this\r\nsixtieth anniversary session of the United Nations, Sri\r\nLanka reaffirms its cooperation in meeting Court’s\r\nobjectives.\r\nMr. Park Hee-Kwon (Republic of Korea): At the\r\noutset, on behalf of my delegation, allow me to thank\r\nJudge Shi Jiuyong, President of the International Court\r\nof Justice (ICJ), for his lucid introduction to the\r\nCourt’s report. The report convinces us that the Court\r\nhas diligently accomplished its duty as the principal\r\njudicial organ of the United Nations. The increasing\r\nnumber of cases brought before the Court of late attests\r\nto the level of trust given the Court by States. In that\r\nregard, my delegation commends the Judges and all of\r\nthe Court’s staff for having converted many sceptics to\r\nbelief in the rule of law.\r\nMy delegation would also like to take this\r\nopportunity to express our sincere gratitude to the\r\nfollowing outgoing Judges: Judge Vereshchetin of the\r\nRussian Federation, Judge Kooijmans of the\r\nNetherlands, Judge Rezek of Brazil and Judge Elaraby\r\nof Egypt. During their tenure, they set an example\r\nthrough their dedication and their insights into the\r\noften-elusive issues of international law. We are\r\nconfident that their legacy will be carried on by their\r\nsuccessors once the latter are elected.\r\nAs the President of the International Court of\r\nJustice has just pointed out, the work of the Court\r\nreached an unprecedented level of intensity during the\r\nperiod under review. Notably, the Court significantly\r\nreduced the number of cases on its docket by rendering\r\n10 final judgments — eight in cases concerning the\r\nlegality of the use of force, one on the issue of certain\r\nproperty, and one concerning a frontier dispute. In all\r\nthose cases, the Court has met our high expectations\r\nfor authoritative language on matters of international\r\nlaw.\r\nI would like to briefly touch upon one recent\r\njudgment: the 2004 Legality of Use of Force case\r\nbetween Serbia and Montenegro and the eight NATO\r\nStates. It has not escaped our notice that the ICJ’s\r\njudgment in this case is seemingly inconsistent with its\r\nearlier decision in Application of the Convention on the\r\nPrevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.\r\nThe six years between the filing dates of the two cases\r\nmay partly explain the difference, as might the\r\nuncertain, and perhaps sui generis, status of Serbia and\r\nMontenegro from 1992 to 2000. Still, I would like to\r\nemphasize that consistency in jurisprudence is of\r\nparamount importance, not only for maintaining States’\r\ntrust in the Court, but also for ensuring the Court’s\r\nreputation for impartiality. I hope, therefore, that the\r\njudgment in the pending Genocide case will clarify any\r\nlingering doubts about the consistency of the Court’s\r\ncase law.\r\nThe active role taken by the Court during the\r\nperiod under review is in line with its activities in\r\nrecent years. Last year, the advisory opinion on Legal\r\nConsequences of the Construction of a Wall in the\r\nOccupied Palestinian Territory garnered an unusual\r\namount of media attention. In that case, the Court not\r\nonly helped the General Assembly to clarify issues in\r\n13\r\nA/60/PV.39\r\none of the most longstanding and difficult disputes\r\nfacing the international community, but also\r\ndemonstrated its will and capability to revitalize its\r\nunderused advisory function. It is worth recalling that\r\nsimilar procedures were more common under the\r\nPermanent Court of International Justice, and proposals\r\nto expand the advisory role of the ICJ, as the principal\r\nlegal organ of the United Nations system, merit further\r\nconsideration.\r\nThe Court has not always enjoyed this level of\r\ntrust from the international community. Indeed, its\r\ncaseload remained fairly low until the 1970s, when the\r\nCourt successfully overcame the suspicion that\r\nprevailed among many developing countries that it was\r\nbiased. Since then, the Court’s client base has\r\nexpanded dramatically. Changing perceptions of the\r\nCourt’s work can be attributed to many factors,\r\nincluding the end of the cold war, but most important\r\nhas been the Court’s successful responses to the\r\nchallenges of a changing world. The report before us\r\nshows that this continues to be the case, as the Court\r\nhas met the challenge of handling an increased\r\nworkload with limited resources.\r\nIndeed, there is a kind of virtuous circle at work:\r\nthe more successful the Court is in fulfilling its\r\nresponsibilities, the more cases will be brought to it.\r\nMoreover, taking into account the increasing number of\r\nStates parties to the Court, acceptance of the Court’s\r\ncompulsory jurisdiction, and the number of treaties\r\nwith provisions referring disputes to the Court, it\r\nwould not surprise us to see a continued rise or even\r\nacceleration in the number of cases brought before the\r\nICJ.\r\nHigh hopes for the Court and proposals for it to\r\nplay a more active role are also bound to increase its\r\nworkload. Thus, the challenge of an increasing number\r\nof cases is an ongoing one, but one that we must tackle\r\nif we are to achieve the ideal of resolving disputes\r\npeacefully by judicial means.\r\nIt has been said that one of the necessary\r\nconditions for a more effective law is to strengthen and\r\nimprove the institutions and processes for the law’s\r\nadministration. It is in this regard that we support the\r\nCourt’s initiatives to improve its efficiency by\r\nstreamlining procedures, adopting advanced\r\ntechnologies and asking for more resources. One such\r\neffort has been the Court’s review and amendment of\r\nits procedural rules, including the Rules of the Court\r\nand Practice Directions. We welcome these\r\namendments as an indication of the Court’s continuous\r\nefforts to speed up its work and enhance the\r\ntransparency of its procedures. The report also informs\r\nus that a request for an expansion of the Court’s\r\nComputerized Division has been submitted for\r\napproval in its 2006-2007 budget. We believe that\r\nadequate resources should be allocated to support the\r\nCourt’s efforts to meet its growing workload, and we\r\ntherefore hope this request will be considered\r\nfavourably by the relevant bodies.\r\nIn the same vein, we emphasize that the challenge\r\nof an increased caseload requires cooperation on the\r\npart of Member States. In many of the recent\r\ncontentious cases, too many of the Court’s limited\r\nresources were consumed during the preliminary stages\r\nrather than during the consideration of the merits of the\r\ncases. While we should respect the rights of States to\r\nfull access to the procedures of the Court and to be\r\nexempt from the Court’s jurisdiction, unless they have\r\ngiven their due consent, overburdening the Court with\r\nunnecessary requests for provisional measures,\r\npreliminary objections or applications of cases as a\r\npure litigation strategy should be avoided for the\r\ncommon good. Such prudence on the part of States will\r\ngreatly assist the Court in completing its important\r\nwork.\r\nThe most recent challenge to the Court, however,\r\ncomes from outside. In this era of proliferating\r\ninternational courts and tribunals, we cannot overstate\r\nthe importance of the Court’s leadership role as the\r\nonly universal international court with general\r\njurisdiction. The Court is now obligated not only to\r\ngive the last word as an adjudicator of international\r\ndisputes, but also to distribute and disseminate its work\r\nwidely. Judge Higgins, in a recently published article,\r\nemphasized the need to keep the legal minds of the\r\ninternational judicial bodies informed of one another’s\r\nachievements. We take this as down-to-earth but\r\nessential advice on how to deal with the challenge of\r\nmultiple international courts.\r\nLet me conclude by reaffirming, on behalf of my\r\ndelegation and the Republic of Korea, our steadfast and\r\nunwavering support for the untiring efforts of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice to achieve the ideal of\r\npeace under law.\r\nMs. Zanelli (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): I would\r\nlike to thank the President of the International Court of\r\n14\r\nA/60/PV.39\r\nJustice, Judge Shi Jiuyong, for his detailed introduction\r\nto the annual report on the work of the Court (A/60/4).\r\nThe contribution of the International Court of\r\nJustice since its establishment to the peaceful\r\nsettlement of disputes, the development of international\r\nlaw and the prevalence of the rule of law at the\r\ninternational level has been, and remains, crucial.\r\nSince the presentation of the last report to this General\r\nAssembly, the Court has continued to receive new\r\ncases for its consideration. This shows the growing will\r\nof States to resolve their disputes peacefully, turning to\r\ninternational law, and it testifies to the confidence that\r\nthe international community has in the impartiality,\r\nindependence and professionalism of this jurisdictional\r\nbody.\r\nBearing in mind the far-reaching role of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security and its contribution to\r\nthe attainment of the fundamental purposes of the\r\nUnited Nations through the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes among States, Peru considers it of utmost\r\nimportance that the Court’s jurisdiction be universally\r\naccepted. Therefore, we call upon all of those States\r\nthat have not yet done so to consider acceptance of the\r\nCourt’s compulsory jurisdiction, without conditions. It\r\nis precisely with a view to helping the parties to a\r\ndispute to resolve it through legal means, through the\r\nCourt, that in 1989 the Secretary-General’s Trust Fund\r\nwas created to assist States in the settlement of\r\ndisputes. Its mandate was wisely amended last year,\r\nthus considerably broadening the number of potential\r\nbeneficiaries.\r\nPeru expresses its appreciation to the States that\r\nhave made contributions to the Fund, and we join in\r\nthe repeated appeal of the Secretary-General that\r\nStates, intergovernmental organizations, national\r\ninstitutions and non-governmental organizations that\r\nare in a position to make voluntary financial\r\ncontributions to the Fund do so.\r\nPeru recognizes the importance of justice being\r\nadministered not only efficiently but also in a timely\r\nmanner. Therefore, we want to underscore the\r\nmeasures the Court has adopted to rationalize the work\r\nof the secretariat to make better use of information\r\ntechnology and to improve its working methods and its\r\nrules. Peru urges the Court to persevere in this ongoing\r\neffort. Likewise, in connection with management\r\nefficiency, we want to underscore the Court’s\r\nannouncement of the beginning of a process to\r\nestablish a system to assess the professionalism of its\r\nstaff.\r\nMy country also wants to underscore the Court’s\r\nwork in publicizing its activities and its rulings. The\r\ndistribution of information by electronic means and, in\r\nparticular, through the Court’s web page are important\r\ntools for the Court’s valuable activities to be widely\r\nknown, not only by governmental officials and by\r\nacademics, but also by citizens the world over. Peru\r\ncommends the Court for this effort, and we encourage\r\nthe Court to continue to consider options to\r\ndisseminate more information about its legal work and\r\nits rulings, including broader dissemination in the other\r\nofficial languages of the United Nations.\r\nPeru, as a country that has historically shown its\r\nstrict compliance with international law, will continue\r\nto support the International Court of Justice in the\r\nfulfilment of the lofty responsibilities entrusted to it by\r\nthe international community.\r\nMr. Hernández (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): I\r\nam pleased to express, on behalf of my delegation,\r\ndeep appreciation to the President of the International\r\nCourt of Justice, Judge Shi Jiuyong, for the detailed\r\nreport that he presented to the General Assembly. In\r\nparticular, Mexico wishes to highlight the relevant\r\nwork of the main United Nations legal organ because\r\nof its ongoing contribution to the development of\r\ninternational law and to the promotion of justice\r\namong States.\r\nMy country takes this opportunity to reaffirm its\r\ncommitment to the objectives that the United Nations\r\nsought to attain by establishing within its own structure\r\na jurisdictional body competent to resolve any dispute\r\nsubmitted to it voluntarily by States or to provide any\r\nlegal consultation needed by the Organization or by\r\none of the bodies of the United Nations system.\r\nStrengthening the international legal regime\r\nundoubtedly has a positive impact on the realization of\r\neach of the Organization’s fundamental principles. It is\r\nclear that the exercise we conduct year after year to\r\nhave an exchange of views between the General\r\nAssembly and the International Court of Justice\r\nenables us, through frank and direct dialogue, to\r\nstrengthen the links of cooperation between those two\r\nmain United Nations organs. We must not forget that\r\nboth organs have a clear mandate to play an active role\r\nin the peaceful settlement of disputes — one from a\r\n15\r\nA/60/PV.39\r\npolitical perspective, and the other from a legal\r\nperspective.\r\nStudying the report of the International Court of\r\nJustice before us today enables us to better understand\r\nthe important disputes in the international community\r\nin various regions and on various subjects. Knowledge\r\nof those disputes encourages the General Assembly to\r\nfollow up on them, mindful of the importance of\r\nkeeping them in legal channels. The Assembly must\r\nalways encourage the parties to a dispute to fully\r\nrespect the Court’s decisions.\r\nThe significant increase in the number of cases\r\nsubmitted to the Court is an unequivocal and tangible\r\nsign of the international community’s confidence in\r\nand political support for its judicial practice,\r\nimpartiality and independence. However, that increase\r\nhas obliged the Court to conduct an ongoing and strict\r\nreview of its procedural Rules and working methods.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the fact that the Court has\r\nviewed this task of renewal as ongoing and that it has\r\ntherefore adopted a new and simplified procedure for\r\npromulgating amendments to its Rules. Undoubtedly,\r\nthe Court’s commitment to adapting to circumstances\r\nwill enable it to carry out its work more effectively and\r\nwill help it to resolve cases in a more orderly and\r\nexpeditious manner.\r\nMexico also welcomes the recent amendment to\r\nArticle 52 of the Rules of Court, which establishes\r\nclearer norms for the presentation of Court\r\ndocumentation. The amendment not only clarifies the\r\nobligations of the parties to a dispute, but also provides\r\nfor greater efficiency in the work of the secretariat.\r\nAnother fundamental aspect of reviewing the Court’s\r\nreport is that it enables us to better understand the legal\r\nissues on which the Court rules year after year. A\r\ndetailed reading of those rulings undoubtedly yields\r\nwell-founded interpretation of various international\r\nlegal norms in various fields.\r\nWe note that during the period covered in the\r\nreport, the International Court of Justice resolved 10\r\ncontentious cases. In those cases, the Court clarified\r\nwhen it should be considered as having jurisdiction\r\nover a dispute, as in the case concerning Certain\r\nProperty (Liechtenstein v. Germany), and what\r\nprinciples are applicable to the determination of\r\ninternational borders, particularly the validity of the uti\r\npossidetis juris principle, in the case concerning the\r\nFrontier Dispute (Benin/Niger). The Court interpreted\r\nthe scope of Article 35, paragraph 2, of its Statute as a\r\nbasis for its jurisdiction, in the case concerning the\r\nLegality of Use of Force (Serbia and Montenegro v.\r\nBelgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy,\r\nNetherlands, Portugal and United Kingdom).\r\nAnother aspect to be emphasized is that in the\r\ncase concerning the Frontier Dispute (Benin/Niger),\r\nthe parties decided to submit it to a Chamber of the\r\nCourt rather than to the plenary Court. That power,\r\nenvisaged in Articles 26 through 29 of the Statute,\r\ndoubtless made it possible to resolve the case swiftly\r\nand efficiently. The procedure has seldom been used in\r\nthe past, but its potential to increase the Court’s\r\nactivity should be examined closely both by the Court\r\nitself and by the States that decide to submit their\r\ndisputes to this jurisdictional organ.\r\nAn aspect that Mexico considers noteworthy is\r\nthe insufficient number of States that have accepted the\r\nCourt’s compulsory jurisdiction in accordance with the\r\nprovisions of Article 36, paragraph (2), of its Statute.\r\nMy delegation wishes to point out that only one third\r\nof the Organization’s membership has made\r\ndeclarations in that regard. That undoubtedly\r\nconstitutes a fundamental limitation to the principle of\r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes. In that connection,\r\nand in accordance with what was agreed by consensus\r\nat the world summit, we urge those States that have not\r\nyet done so to consider the possibility of recognizing\r\nthe Court’s jurisdiction in accordance with the\r\nprovisions of its Statute.\r\nIt was agreed at the summit to consider means of\r\nstrengthening the Court’s work, as provided for in\r\nparagraph 134 (f) of the outcome document (resolution\r\n60/1) adopted by the heads of State and Government.\r\nMexico believes that some of those measures are\r\nclosely related to strengthening the Secretary-General’s\r\nmediation efforts and good offices, to which the\r\noutcome document also refers in its paragraph 76. In\r\nfact, once the Court has ruled on the substance of a\r\nmatter, the Secretary-General, through his good offices\r\nand at the request of the parties involved, should play a\r\nmore active role in facilitating and ensuring due\r\ncompliance with the ruling. Such recourse has already\r\nbeen taken, as in the case between Mali and Burkina\r\nFaso and, more recently, in the case between Nigeria\r\nand Cameroon.\r\nNon-compliance with certain rulings and\r\norders — both of which are binding on the parties, with\r\n16\r\nA/60/PV.39\r\nno right of appeal — on provisional measures issued\r\nby the Court has unfortunately occurred in the past and\r\ncould occur in the future. Before a case of non-\r\ncompliance is referred to the Security Council in\r\naccordance with the provisions of Article 94,\r\nparagraph (2), of the Charter, it would be useful to\r\nconsider a more active role for the Secretary-General,\r\nthrough the use of his good offices or through other\r\nmeans, to promote and facilitate full compliance with\r\nthe Court’s rulings.\r\nFurthermore, we believe that interaction with\r\nother principal organs should not be limited to the\r\nSecretary-General, but that the Security Council should\r\nalso make more frequent use of its powers under\r\nArticles 36 and 37 of the Charter to recommend that as\r\na general rule, all disputes of a legal nature be\r\nsubmitted to the International Court of Justice.\r\nThe Court’s jurisdiction covers all disputes\r\nsubmitted by States for resolution in accordance with\r\ninternational law. The Court also has the authority to\r\nissue advisory opinions on legal matters submitted by\r\nthe General Assembly or the Security Council, or by\r\nother United Nations organs and specialized agencies\r\nduly authorized by the Assembly or legal issues arising\r\nwithin their respective areas of competence.\r\nNonetheless, the advisory jurisdiction of the\r\nCourt has seldom been used. This is why we should\r\nbear in mind what President Shi Jiuyong stated in his\r\naddress to the Sixth Committee on 5 November 2004.\r\nIt is indeed surprising that in 59 years the Court has\r\nonly been asked to provide advisory opinions on 24\r\noccasions, a figure that is comparatively lower than the\r\nnumber of opinions expressed by the Permanent Court\r\nof International Justice in its 17 years.\r\nPresident Shi Jiuyong made a few suggestions on\r\nthe way in which better use might be made of the\r\nadvisory jurisdiction of the Court. In this regard, he\r\nindicated, first, that the possibility of broadening the\r\nsphere of application of the advisory jurisdiction\r\nratione personae could be considered — in other\r\nwords, a larger number of international organizations\r\ncould be authorized to request such opinions. President\r\nShi Jiuyong even suggested that one way of\r\nsimplifying that possibility would be to request the\r\nGeneral Assembly or the Security Council, in view of\r\ntheir broad competence, to act as intermediaries for the\r\ninternational organizations.\r\nSecondly, the President suggested that the\r\nSecretary-General be empowered to request advisory\r\nopinions at his own initiative. We believe that it would\r\nnot be necessary to amend the Charter for that purpose.\r\nIt would suffice for the General Assembly to give a\r\nstanding authorization to the Secretary-General to that\r\nend.\r\nConsideration of the report of the International\r\nCourt of Justice is also an opportunity to indicate what\r\nthe Court needs for the adequate fulfilment of its\r\nfunctions. There is no doubt about the importance of\r\nthe Court’s decisions and its influence on the\r\ndevelopment and implementation of the norms of\r\ninternational law. We are convinced that to facilitate\r\nthe work of our principal legal organ it is necessary for\r\nStates to accompany their expressions of support with\r\nthe adoption of concrete measures that strengthen the\r\nCourt.\r\nMexico will support the granting of more\r\nresources to the Court and will continue to ensure that\r\nit has the tools it needs to fulfil its mandate in the same\r\neffective and professional manner as it has to date.\r\nMr. Abdelaziz (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): Allow\r\nme, Sir, to thank the President of the International\r\nCourt of Justice for his detailed briefing and\r\nintroduction to the report of the Court for this year. It\r\nreflects the great importance of the role it plays in\r\npromoting international law in international relations.\r\nEgypt wishes to welcome the contributions made\r\nby the Court during the reporting period, in particular\r\nits main role in attaining the primary goals of the\r\nUnited Nations. The Court plays a pivotal role in\r\ndeveloping international law, promoting compliance\r\nwith its rules, fostering international peace and security\r\nand peaceful coexistence among peoples through\r\nrespect for the rule of law, assisting States in the\r\npeaceful resolution of disputes through legal means,\r\nand handing down advisory opinions on legal matters\r\nsubmitted to the Court.\r\nThere is no doubt that the significant increase in\r\ncases and the number of matters before the Court attest\r\nto the increasing confidence of the international\r\ncommunity in the role of the Court. This corroborates\r\nthe impartiality, independence and credibility of the\r\nCourt’s rulings that are based on principles of law and\r\nare free from any political trend. This role should be\r\nreinforced by acceptance of the Court by a growing\r\n17\r\nA/60/PV.39\r\nnumber of countries due to the compulsory opinions\r\nregarding disputes that it has handed down.\r\nThe United Nations is going through an important\r\nphase in its development. It is modernizing, and we\r\nhope that the Court will play a more effective role in\r\ninternational relations aimed at strengthening the\r\nprinciples of law and justice.\r\nWe had believed that the sixtieth session summit\r\ndocument would reflect a definite and clear idea of\r\ndeveloping the Court’s role — in harmony with new\r\ninternational developments — which has changed since\r\nit was created, so that it could live up to the current\r\ninitiatives, developing the United Nations framework\r\nand its working methods and striking the proper\r\nbalance among the principal organs of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nHowever, the negotiations leading to the adoption\r\nof the outcome document show that some were hesitant\r\nabout accepting such ideas concerning the development\r\nof the Court’s role or about recognizing the true value\r\nof its judgments and advisory opinions. Egypt wishes\r\nto express its concern about this growing tendency to\r\nmarginalize the Court, particularly since the value of\r\nits judgments and of its advisory opinions is not\r\nconfined to deciding on certain facts or rules; it is\r\nrather a question of enriching and developing\r\ninternational law. There are moral and legal values that\r\nshould be respected by the international community.\r\nAccordingly, we wish to stress the centrality and\r\nimportance of the Court’s advisory opinions, as\r\nrequested by the Security Council or the General\r\nAssembly. The Security Council, by trying to have\r\npolitical considerations prevail over law, has ignored\r\nthe Court’s role and has not asked for any advisory\r\nopinion since the question of Namibia. The question of\r\nNamibia was the only one the Council requested. There\r\nis now, however, an urgent need for the Council to use\r\nthe experience of this principal legal organ of the\r\nUnited Nations to strengthen the legal value of its\r\nresolutions, which seek to establish international peace\r\nand security.\r\nThe aforementioned also applies to the General\r\nAssembly. We believe that the Assembly should use\r\nthe Court’s advisory opinions to strengthen its capacity\r\nto perform its duty in the most perfect manner possible\r\nby referring contentious issues to the Court and\r\nrequesting advisory opinions from it, so that such\r\nopinions can be applied, despite the fact that we know\r\nthat these opinions are advisory in nature and are open\r\nto interpretation of binding legal principles that are\r\nupheld by international law. They should be taken\r\nseriously, particularly the advisory opinion handed\r\ndown by the Court at the request of the General\r\nAssembly on the legal impact of building the\r\nseparation wall in occupied Palestinian territories. This\r\nopinion was a clear, unequivocal interpretation of a\r\nmajor legal principle that we all recognize, which is\r\nthat it is prohibited to occupy another’s territory by\r\nforce. This advisory opinion has binding legal value,\r\nand the Assembly should pursue its implementation\r\nwithin the competence entrusted to it by the Charter.\r\nLikewise, we believe that the General Assembly\r\nshould consider the submission in due course of a\r\nrequest for an advisory opinion from the Court\r\nconcerning the degree of legality exercised by the\r\nSecurity Council on certain competences that were\r\noriginally possessed by the General Assembly, apart,\r\nthat is, from the Council’s pre-eminence in matters of\r\ninternational peace and security. I would mention in\r\nparticular questions of terrorism, respect for human\r\nrights, disarmament and other questions.\r\nWe are convinced that this call to strengthen the\r\nprinciples of democracy and the rule of law should in\r\nno way be limited to requesting States to comply with\r\nthem at the national level alone. These principles must\r\nbe reinforced and complied with by the international\r\ncommunity and in international relations. Therefore,\r\nthe Court is the principal legal organ of the United\r\nNations and is abundantly qualified to play a decisive\r\nrole in strengthening those principals and to promote\r\nand reaffirm law and justice.\r\nHowever, in order to enable the Court to play that\r\nrole we, as Member States — whether as part of the\r\nGeneral Assembly or the Security Council — must\r\nrequest the opinion of the Court in all contentious legal\r\nissues. We need to implement the Court’s opinions\r\nwhen they relate to the interpretation of international\r\nlaw pursuant to the United Nations Charter.\r\nAccordingly, we welcome the Court’s efforts, as\r\nit seeks to improve its working methods, to respond to\r\nthe growing number and growing complexity of\r\nquestions, particularly concerning procedural aspects.\r\nWe think the United Nations reform plan that we are\r\nvigorously striving to implement should include\r\nstrengthening the rules of international law and the\r\nauthority of the International Court of Justice so that it\r\n18\r\nA/60/PV.39\r\ncan truly accomplish its mission in a world that is\r\nundergoing changes, and where some are trying to\r\ncircumvent the rules of international law or reduce\r\nthem to serving narrow national interests through\r\nefforts that are not in keeping with the higher interests\r\nof the Organization or of the world at large.\r\nDuring the negotiations on the reform of the\r\nOrganization and the implementation of the decisions\r\nof the recent summit, Egypt will be putting forward\r\nspecific proposals to strengthen the authority of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice, within the context of\r\nestablishing the necessary balance between the five\r\nprincipal organs of the Organization, in order to make\r\ncertain that the Organization and the Court remain\r\neffective.\r\nMr. Kitaoka (Japan): My delegation would like\r\nto thank President Shi Jiuyong for his in-depth report\r\non the current work of the International Court of\r\nJustice (A/60/4). We also express our gratitude and\r\nsupport for the considerable achievements of the work\r\nof the Court in the past year.\r\nIn the present international community, where we\r\ncontinue to witness armed conflicts and acts of\r\nterrorism, the reinforcement of law and order is truly\r\nindispensable. Indeed, there has been an increasing\r\nawareness among nations that international society\r\nmust embrace the value and the goal of establishing\r\nand maintaining the primacy of international law. In\r\nthat regard, the role of the International Court of\r\nJustice, the world’s most authoritative international\r\ncourt, cannot be overstated.\r\nAs a State resolutely devoted to peace and firmly\r\ndedicated to respect for international law, Japan\r\nappreciates the strenuous efforts and work of the Court.\r\nWe believe that the Court is required to display not\r\nonly a profound knowledge of international law but\r\nalso an insightful view of the international community,\r\ngiven the fact that the world is going through rapid\r\nchanges and that international disputes of all kinds are\r\nconstantly arising. Japan appreciates the Court’s\r\ncapacity to meet those requirements and continues to\r\nfully support its work.\r\nWe must take note of this year’s remarkable\r\naccomplishments by the Court, which has reduced the\r\nnumber of cases in the docket from 21 to 12.\r\nConsidering the serious and much-discussed backlog of\r\ncases in the past, the recent level of achievement in\r\nprocessing the cases at hand is worthy of admiration.\r\nWe expect that the Court will continue to maintain the\r\ncurrent pace of its work, without compromising the\r\nquality of its deliberations, and contribute to the further\r\nstrengthening of the rule of law in today’s international\r\ncommunity.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reaffirm the great\r\nimportance that we attach to the lofty cause and work\r\nof the International Court of Justice as the principal\r\njudicial organ of the United Nations. Japan will\r\nmaintain its firm support for the invaluable work of the\r\nCourt.\r\nMs. Bahemuka (Kenya): My delegation would\r\nlike to thank His Excellency, the Honourable Shi\r\nJiuyong, President of the International Court of Justice,\r\nfor the cogent and comprehensive report contained in\r\ndocument A/60/4, which outlines in detail the work\r\naccomplished by the Court over the past year. The\r\nreport provides a solid basis for our discussion on the\r\nagenda item.\r\nThe International Court of Justice remains at the\r\ncentre of the international legal system for adjudicating\r\ndisputes among Member States of the Organization. Its\r\nrole, in the pacific settlement of disputes, has\r\ncontributed greatly, not only to ensuring justice and\r\nequity among the community of nations, but also to the\r\nmaintenance of international peace, order and stability.\r\nMy delegation is pleased to note that the Court\r\nhas continued to discharge its onerous mandate as the\r\nprincipal judicial organ of the United Nations with\r\nveracity and diligence. As a result, it has earned for\r\nitself the trust and confidence of Member States, as\r\ndemonstrated by the continued increase in the number\r\nand diversity of cases referred to it. We hope that the\r\nCourt will continue to zealously uphold justice with\r\nintegrity and fairness in accordance with the United\r\nNations Charter and the Statute of the Court.\r\nMy delegation is also pleased to note that the\r\nvarious measures instituted by the Court in 1997 to\r\nimprove its working methods are beginning to bear\r\nfruit. Indeed, the reduction of pending cases — from\r\n20 or more in previous years to the current number of\r\n11 — is a remarkable achievement. The Court must,\r\nhowever, make efforts to sustain that momentum in\r\norder to further minimize delays and eventually\r\neliminate the present backlog. In that respect, we call\r\nupon the Court to subject its working methods and\r\nprocedures to regular review in order to facilitate the\r\n19\r\nA/60/PV.39\r\nnecessary improvements and readjustments. We urge\r\nMember States to support the Court in that endeavour.\r\nIn his report entitled “In larger freedom”\r\n(A/59/2005), the Secretary-General challenges Member\r\nStates to consider ways to strengthen the work of the\r\nCourt. Kenya has a lot of confidence in the Court’s\r\nability to resolve disputes, and I believe that view is\r\nshared among many Member States. We thus urge\r\nincreased support for the Court through, inter alia,\r\nsufficient budgetary allocations that will enable it to\r\nfulfil its statutory obligations. In that regard, we\r\nsupport requests made by the Court for the biennium\r\n2006-2007 and urge Member States to respond\r\nfavourably to them. We also support the Court’s\r\nrequest for the establishment of an additional\r\nprofessional post in its Computerization Division.\r\n The Government of Kenya is grateful for the\r\npublications it continues to receive from the\r\nInternational Court of Justice. They provide a useful\r\nresource base for research in the area of international\r\nlaw and practice. We look forward to the continued,\r\ntimely publication of the next series of International\r\nCourt of Justice reports.\r\nMy delegation very much appreciates the efforts\r\nto distribute the Court’s publications to the major law\r\nlibraries throughout the world. However, we are\r\nconcerned that law students in developing countries,\r\nparticularly in Africa, may be disadvantaged because\r\nthere are only a few such major libraries in those\r\ncountries. We therefore call upon the Court to ensure a\r\nwider and more equitable distribution of its\r\npublications, giving due regard to the needs of\r\ndeveloping countries, in particular the needs of law\r\nschools in those countries.\r\nWe commend the President and members of the\r\nCourt for their continued interaction with delegations\r\nfrom States parties through various activities, including\r\nvisits to the Court by presidents and other members of\r\nGovernment, diplomats, parliamentary delegations,\r\nmembers of judicial bodies, scholars and academics,\r\nand legal professionals, as well as through the speeches\r\ndelivered by members of the Court to various forums.\r\nThose activities play a significant role in promoting a\r\nbetter understanding of the Court and its role within\r\nthe United Nations. We urge the Court to widen the\r\nscope of such activities.\r\nIn closing, I wish to reaffirm that my delegation\r\nattaches great importance to the work of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice. Kenya has already\r\ndeclared its acceptance of the Court’s compulsory\r\njurisdiction in accordance with article 36, paragraph 2,\r\nof the Statute of the Court. However, we are concerned\r\nthat, of the 191 States parties to the Statute of the\r\nCourt, only 65 have deposited with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral a declaration of acceptance of the Court’s\r\ncompulsory jurisdiction. We therefore encourage States\r\nthat have not yet done so to deposit their declaration in\r\norder to further consolidate the Court’s universality. In\r\naddition, we urge Member States to make greater use\r\nof the Court’s advisory functions and, most important,\r\nto increase compliance with the decisions of the Court.\r\nMr. Stagno Ugarte (Costa Rica) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): Allow me, at the outset, to thank the\r\nInternational Court of Justice for its report, contained\r\nin document A/60/4, and thank the Court’s President,\r\nJudge Shi Jiuyong, for his excellent introduction of the\r\nreport.\r\nCosta Rica fully supports the work of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice as the best mechanism\r\nfor the peaceful settlement of disputes. Our confidence\r\nin that high judicial organ is tangibly demonstrated by\r\nour recent referral of a contentious case to the Court.\r\nOur recourse to the Court seeks to resolve, in a friendly\r\nand peaceful manner, the legal dispute concerning\r\nCosta Rica’s rights with respect to navigation on the\r\nSan Juan River. My country is convinced that the\r\nCourt’s decision in that case will resolve in a definitive\r\nmanner any source of discord and will ensure enduring\r\nfraternity and friendship between Costa Rica and\r\nNicaragua.\r\nAs the Court’s President has just affirmed,\r\nrecourse to the legal settlement of disputes should\r\nnever be viewed as an unfriendly act among States.\r\nThe peaceful settlement of disputes is one of the\r\nfundamental pillars of peace and fraternity. In effect,\r\nthe existence of legitimate mechanisms and procedures\r\nto resolve legal differences is essential for the\r\nharmonious conduct of international relations. Legal\r\ndisputes can give rise to threats to international peace\r\nand security. Territorial disputes, in particular, can lead\r\nto a military escalation. In that context, the\r\nInternational Court of Justice provides a peaceful\r\nalternative to the use of force and plays a fundamental\r\nrole in the society of nations.\r\nIn addition, the existence of legal disputes creates\r\nan atmosphere unfavourable to international\r\n20\r\nA/60/PV.39\r\ncooperation. The lack of clear norms and the existence\r\nof doubts about rights and obligations create an\r\nenvironment that is not conducive to coordinated\r\ndevelopment and mutual assistance. The Court’s legal\r\nactivity produces legal certainty, clarifies the basic\r\nnorms of international law and ensures the rule of law\r\nin international relations. In that context, we note the\r\nCourt’s work in the progressive development of\r\ncontemporary international law. Its jurisprudence, in\r\nboth contentious cases and advisory opinions, not only\r\ndetermines the law for the parties to a conflict but also\r\nenlightens other States with respect to obscure or\r\ncontroversial areas of law.\r\nRegrettably, the Court’s constructive work is\r\nhindered by the growing number of States that impose\r\nreservations or conditions on their declaration of\r\nacceptance of the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction. It is\r\nregrettable that only a dozen countries have accepted\r\nthe Court’s jurisdiction without reservations or\r\nconditions. We are also concerned that only 65 States\r\nhave accepted the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction in\r\naccordance with Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute.\r\nAcceptance of the Court’s jurisdiction in contentious\r\ncases without limitations or restrictions is essential for\r\nthe proper functioning of the international legal order.\r\nFor that reason, we urge countries that have not yet\r\ndone so to accept the Court’s unrestricted jurisdiction\r\nin contentious cases, and we invite those States that\r\nhave placed reservations on their acceptance of the\r\nCourt’s jurisdiction to remove them.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the fact that a great\r\nnumber of cases have been submitted to the Court.\r\nThat positive situation reflects the international\r\ncommunity’s growing confidence in the Court’s work,\r\nas well as the willingness of States to submit to the\r\nprinciples of law in the conduct of their international\r\nrelations. We believe that frequent recourse to the\r\nCourt, as an effective mechanism for the peaceful\r\nsettlement of disputes, should be encouraged.\r\nHowever, the growing number of legal cases has\r\nincreased the institution’s workload. We welcome the\r\nCourt’s efforts to rationalize its operations and working\r\nmethods, including the recent amendments to the Rule\r\nof the Court in order to prevent delays in the\r\nconsideration of cases. We consider it essential that the\r\nGeneral Assembly provide the Court with sufficient\r\nresources and personnel to allow it to fulfil the new\r\nobligations resulting from the increased caseload. For\r\nthat reason, we view with great interest the request for\r\ntwo additional posts — one in the Computerization\r\nDivision and the other in the office of the President —\r\ncontained in the corresponding section of the draft\r\nbudget for the upcoming biennium.\r\nIn addition, I would like to underline the Court’s\r\nexcellent work in disseminating information through\r\nInternet. That service is invaluable for developing\r\nStates, which sometimes have difficulty gaining access\r\nto the most recent jurisprudence. We trust that the\r\nCourt will soon publish the complete texts of all its\r\njurisprudence on its website.\r\nFinally, I wish to reaffirm Costa Rica’s full\r\nconfidence in and firm support for the excellent work\r\nof the International Court of Justice.\r\nMr. Belinga-Eboutou (Cameroon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): Although it is an annual item on the\r\nAssembly’s agenda, the present debate on the report of\r\nthe International Court of Justice (A/60/4) has special\r\nimportance for my country this year. This debate\r\ncomes at a time when we are celebrating the sixtieth\r\nanniversary of the Charter of the United Nations and of\r\nthe Statute of the International Court of Justice. In that\r\ncontext, my delegation is pleased to take part in a\r\ndebate that allows the international community to take\r\na look back at the road travelled by the Court, reflect\r\non the Court’s future and, above all, pay tribute to its\r\nimmense contribution to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nAllow me at the outset to express to the President\r\nof the International Court of Justice, Mr. Shi Jiuyong,\r\nour deep appreciation for his introduction to our\r\ndiscussion of the activities of the Court. The Court can\r\nbe proud of the fact that it has made judicial settlement\r\nthe jewel in its crown. It can be proud also of the fact,\r\nas President Bedjaoui has said, that it continues to\r\nensure that international justice prevails in this new\r\ncentury.\r\nTestimony of this is its participation — at the\r\nrequest of States, of course — in addressing the major\r\nconcerns facing today’s world: security, human rights,\r\nthe environment and development.\r\nPresident Shi and his associates take decisions on\r\nmajor issues relating to the sovereignty of States. Their\r\nprofession is unique. They carry out their work not\r\nonly with pride but also with great humility. How could\r\nit be otherwise, since they know that justice rendered\r\nby people for other people is a complex matter,\r\n21\r\nA/60/PV.39\r\nbecause deep philosophical issues are involved. Justice\r\nhanded down by people for States is just as difficult\r\nand complicated a matter, given the considerable\r\ninterests that are increasingly at stake. But, fortunately,\r\nPresident Shi and his associates are profoundly and\r\nacutely conscious of that fact.\r\nThe report of the International Court of Justice\r\n(A/60/4) is clear evidence of the importance of the\r\nwork done by this principal judicial organ of the\r\nUnited Nations, particularly as concerns its evolution\r\nover time. For some years now we have been\r\nwitnessing an exponential increase in the number of\r\ncases entrusted to the Court and, correspondingly, an\r\nunprecedented increase in its activities. As is stated in\r\nthe report, 21 contentious cases were pending in the\r\nCourt last year, whereas in the 1970s it had only a few\r\ncases on its docket. Some resolute optimists might see\r\nthis as evidence of a certain trend towards the triumph\r\nof legality over force in international relations. We, for\r\nour part, wish to welcome the increasing confidence of\r\nthe international community in the International Court\r\nof Justice as well as the increased recognition by States\r\nof the overriding role of the Court in the peaceful\r\nsettlement of disputes and in the realization of the\r\nideals enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nWe encourage this trend and express the hope that\r\nit will likewise be reflected in an increase in the\r\nnumber of countries that have deposited with the\r\nSecretary-General a declaration of acceptance of the\r\ncompulsory jurisdiction of the Court. Indeed, as stated\r\nin the report, as at 31 July 2005, 191 States were\r\nparties to the Statute of the Court, but only 66 of them\r\nhad deposited a declaration with the Secretary-General.\r\nThe low number of countries having depositing such a\r\ndeclaration is certainly offset by the large number of\r\nbilateral or multilateral conventions that contain\r\ncompromise clauses providing for the competence of\r\nthe Court in settling differences resulting from their\r\napplication or interpretation. States may likewise\r\nsubmit a dispute to the Court on the basis of a\r\ncompromise decision.\r\nThe many challenges facing the international\r\ncommunity in the early part of the twenty-first century\r\nreaffirm more clearly each day the importance of the\r\nrole of the United Nations and of its principal judicial\r\norgan, the International Court of Justice, in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nThe international community needs the United\r\nNations more than ever before, and it is increasingly\r\nseeing the pivotal importance of the ICJ.\r\nWhile it is necessary, so that the Court can fully\r\nplay its role, to encourage States to have more frequent\r\nrecourse to it, we also deem it appropriate to urge\r\nStates to implement, in good faith and in a timely\r\nmanner, the decisions of the International Court of\r\nJustice. All peace- and justice-loving countries and all\r\ncountries wishing for harmonious relations in the\r\ninternational community must make the necessary\r\neffort to act in that manner and to encourage others to\r\ndo the same. Notwithstanding all of the pledges and\r\nstatements of intent made, the Court cannot live up to\r\nthe hopes of the international community unless its\r\ndecisions are implemented fully and speedily.\r\nCameroon believes that the voluntary and speedy\r\nimplementation of the rulings of the Court is an act of\r\nfaith in international jurisdiction that renders deeply\r\nmeaningful and highly significant States’ recourse to\r\nthe Court. What would be the point of agreeing to the\r\ncompulsory jurisdiction of the Court, of having\r\nrecourse to the ICJ and of appearing before it if, in the\r\nend, its rulings were not implemented?\r\nWhile recourse to the ICJ very often makes it\r\npossible to resolve peacefully differences among States\r\nand to dispel tensions and stave off the spectre of war,\r\nfailure to implement its judgments can have serious\r\nconsequences for international peace and security.\r\nConcerning the rule of law, Cameroon attaches\r\ngreat importance to the settlement of disputes by\r\njudicial means, that is to say, through recourse to the\r\nICJ — once, of course, other methods of settlement\r\nhave been shown to be ineffective. That position is\r\nconsistently recalled by our head of State, President\r\nPaul Biya.\r\nThat is why our country has consistently sought\r\nto work to bring about the rule of law, not only within\r\nits borders but beyond. That is also why Cameroon has\r\nthus far spared no effort in implementing the decision\r\nof the Court in its maritime and land border dispute\r\nwith Nigeria.\r\nAt a time when our Organization is involved in\r\nthoroughgoing reforms, we must be sure that our\r\nefforts take duly into account the crucial role played by\r\nthe International Court of Justice.\r\n22\r\nA/60/PV.39\r\nAs recently stated by His Excellency Mr. Paul\r\nBiya, the President of the Republic of Cameroon, from\r\nthis very rostrum, the International Court of Justice\r\nshould play a central role in the institutional machinery\r\nof our Organization. It is in all of our best interests.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the reforms undertaken\r\nby the Court to rationalize and improve its work. We\r\nalso welcome the enormous amount of work done by\r\nthe members of the Court during the reporting period,\r\nand we congratulate them on their great competence,\r\ntheir diligence and their determination.\r\nWe deem it appropriate in order to facilitate the\r\nwork of the Court to accede to the requests contained\r\nin paragraph 255 of the report. We also deem it\r\nappropriate to appeal for more significant contributions\r\nto the Secretary-General’s Trust Fund, which seeks to\r\nhelp States to refer their disputes to the International\r\nCourt of Justice.\r\nMr. Chaudhry (Pakistan): I wish to thank\r\nPresident Shi Jiuyong for presenting the report of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice (A/60/4) on its work\r\nduring the past year. I also thank him for his briefing\r\non the role and functioning of the Court.\r\nJustice and rule of law are key to an orderly\r\ninternational society. The need for international legal\r\norder and justice has never been felt as acutely as\r\ntoday. Justice and fairness have become an integral\r\nrequirement of modern-day existence.\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations, under Chapter\r\nVI, offers vast possibilities for the United Nations and\r\nits organs to play an important role in the pacific\r\nsettlement of disputes and conflict prevention. Yet,\r\nthese possibilities remain grossly under-utilized. There\r\nhas been a marked increase in excessive and immediate\r\nresort to Chapter VII, including on issues that do not\r\nnecessarily pose a threat to international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nThe International Court of justice occupies a\r\nspecial place in the United Nations system as its\r\nprincipal judicial organ. As the report of the Court\r\nnotes, it is the only international court of a universal\r\ncharacter with general jurisdiction. Article 36,\r\nparagraph 3, of the Charter clearly sets out the role of\r\nthe Court in the settlement of disputes.\r\nSince its inception, the Court has performed its\r\ntasks with great skill. However, the potential of the\r\nCourt as the main forum for the settlement of disputes\r\nand for advisory opinions, through its contentious and\r\nadvisory jurisdiction, remains largely un-utilized. More\r\nthan 300 bilateral and multilateral treaties provide for\r\nthe Court to have jurisdiction in the resolution of\r\ndisputes arising out of their application or\r\ninterpretation. However, only 66 countries, including\r\nPakistan, have accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of\r\nthe Court, in accordance with Article 36, paragraph 2,\r\nof the Statute of the Court. Recourse to the advisory\r\njurisdiction of the Court has also been quite rare. We\r\nwill need to consider ways and means to ensure greater\r\nutilization of the services that the Court can provide.\r\nOn this occasion, I would like to make a few\r\nspecific comments on the work of the Court. First, we\r\nhave noted the increase in the Court’s workload since\r\n1990, and particularly since 1997. We have also noted\r\nthe difficulties that the Court is facing in holding\r\nhearings in all pending cases directly after the closure\r\nof the written proceedings, owing to the increase in the\r\nnumber and complexity of cases before it.\r\nSecondly, we appreciate the continued efforts of\r\nthe Court to cope with its workload through\r\nrationalization of the work of the Registry, greater use\r\nof information technology, improvement of its working\r\nmethods and through securing greater collaboration\r\nfrom the parties in relation to its procedures.\r\nThirdly, consideration should also be given to\r\nsome important recommendations regarding the Court\r\ncontained in “An Agenda for Peace” (A/47/277), such\r\nas that all States should make more frequent use of the\r\njurisdiction of the Court, consistent with Article 36 of\r\nits Statute. When submission of a dispute to the full\r\nCourt is not practical, the Chambers could be used.\r\nFurthermore, consideration should be given to whether\r\nthe Secretary-General should be duly authorized by the\r\nGeneral Assembly to request advisory opinions in\r\nmatters pertaining to his functions under the Charter.\r\nFourthly, in the event of non-compliance with the\r\njudgments of the Court, Article 94, paragraph 2, of the\r\nCharter sets out a procedure for addressing such\r\nsituations. The Secretary General, through his good\r\noffices and upon request of the Party or the Parties\r\nconcerned, should play an increasingly active role in\r\nfacilitating and securing due implementation of the\r\njudgment.\r\nFifthly, the Security Council should much more\r\nfrequently use its powers under Articles 36 and 37 of\r\n23\r\nA/60/PV.39\r\nthe Charter to recommend that legal disputes should, as\r\na general rule, be referred to the Court.\r\nSixthly, and lastly, we believe that the Court\r\nshould have at its disposal all the resources necessary\r\nto perform the tasks assigned to it. The General\r\nAssembly should provide the Court with the resources\r\nneeded to perform its work effectively and efficiently.\r\nWe hope that the General Assembly will give\r\npositive consideration to the Court’s request in its\r\n2006-2007 budget submission for a new senior\r\nProfessional post for the head of its Computerization\r\nDivision.\r\nAllow me to make a few general remarks on this\r\noccasion. First, all United Nations Member States\r\nshould promote the concept of the non-use of force and\r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes as the means of\r\nachieving collective security, in accordance with the\r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.\r\nThey should always act in accordance with the\r\nprinciples enshrined in Article 2, paragraphs 3 and 4,\r\nof the Charter.\r\nSecondly, the parties to any dispute must assume\r\ntheir responsibilities to settle their disputes peacefully,\r\nas required under the Charter, and make the most\r\neffective use of mechanisms, procedures and methods\r\nfor pacific settlement, as described in the Charter. They\r\nmust show the necessary political will to ensure the\r\nsuccess of pacific settlement of disputes.\r\nThirdly, the idea of the promotion of dialogue\r\namong civilizations and a culture of peace could\r\ngreatly contribute to the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. I would also like to mention in this\r\ncontext the strategy of Enlightened Moderation\r\nproposed by President Musharraf of Pakistan to deal\r\nwith issues such as extremism and terrorism through a\r\nbroad range of measures at different levels.\r\nFourthly, Member States should promote the\r\nrealization by the peoples under colonial and other\r\nforms of alien or foreign occupation of their\r\ninalienable right to self-determination, freedom and\r\nindependence, in accordance with the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe quest to define and, subsequently, to\r\nimplement justice and the rule of law has been central\r\nto the march of civilization. The rule of law can be\r\nstrengthened if the principles laid down in the United\r\nNations Charter for the pacific settlement of disputes\r\nare adhered to, if international human rights norms are\r\napplied consistently and if Security Council resolutions\r\nare implemented faithfully.\r\nThe commitment we make to strengthen and\r\nadvance the international rule of law will be a lasting\r\nlegacy for future generations. We stand ready to fully\r\ncontribute to the work of the Court in the realization of\r\nsuch a commitment.\r\nMr. Lobach (Russian Federation) (spoke in\r\nRussian): Allow me to echo the words of thanks and\r\ngratitude to the President of the International Court of\r\nJustice, Judge Shi Jiuyong, for his interesting and\r\ncomprehensive briefing on the work of the Court. We\r\nalso agree with the commendation of the Court’s work\r\nduring the period under review.\r\nWe emphasize that the Russian Federation has\r\nalways attached great importance to the work of the\r\nCourt and to its judgments. We are pleased to note the\r\ngrowing role over the years of that unique body, which\r\nis the most effective legitimate mechanism of\r\ninternational justice and which has made an invaluable\r\nand steadily growing contribution to the peaceful\r\nsettlement of disputes between States.\r\nA growing number of States have entrusted\r\ncomplex legal disputes to the Court, increasing the\r\nrange of issues and geographical scope of matters\r\nunder consideration. That favourable trend attests to\r\nthe recognition of the Court’s authority, the high level\r\nof professionalism of its judges and the legitimacy of\r\nits rulings. One of the most urgent priorities at the\r\nmoment is the comprehensive and unconditional\r\ncompliance by States with the obligations flowing from\r\nthe Court’s judgments.\r\nIn the framework of efforts to strengthen the\r\nCourt’s authority and, in general, the instruments of\r\ninternational law for resolving interstate disputes, the\r\nfurther expansion of the practice of accepting the\r\ncompulsory jurisdiction of the Court is particularly\r\nsignificant. In response to the 2005 summit outcome,\r\nthe Russian Federation intends to start actively\r\nworking on the question of lifting its prior reservations\r\nto several international treaties, including in the area of\r\ncombating terrorism, that recognize the Court’s\r\njurisdiction in adjudicating disputes concerning the\r\napplication and the interpretation of those treaties.\r\nOne important aspect of the Court’s work is its\r\nadvisory opinions on various legal questions, issued\r\n24\r\nA/60/PV.39\r\nupon request by United Nations bodies and specialized\r\nagencies. The Russian delegation believes that\r\nstrengthening the institution of advisory opinions can\r\nonly be welcomed. We believe that in questions of\r\nadvisory jurisdiction, the Court should act with\r\ncircumspection, considering all aspects, including the\r\nexistence of a bilateral dispute linked to an issue on\r\nwhich an advisory opinion has been requested,\r\nparticularly in situations where one of the parties to the\r\ndispute has not accepted the Court’s compulsory\r\njurisdiction. We believe that advisory opinions must\r\nnot impede the search for a political solution.\r\nWe commend the Court administration’s\r\nconsistent policy of enhancing the effectiveness of its\r\nmethods of work and improving its procedures. We\r\nwelcome measures taken in recent years to rationalize\r\nthe work of the Registry, including the greater use of\r\ninformation technology.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to express general\r\nsatisfaction that questions relating to the funding of the\r\nCourt’s work and to improving its technological\r\ncapacities are, on the whole, being resolved in a\r\npositive fashion. Issues still outstanding in that area\r\ninclude the request of the Court’s administration for\r\nadditional funding for the needed expansion of the use\r\nof advanced technology. In the opinion of the Russian\r\ndelegation, that issue should be resolved quickly so\r\nthat the Court can perform the job entrusted to it more\r\neffectively.\r\nMr. Bugaje (Nigeria): The Nigerian delegation\r\nwould like to congratulate Judge Shi Jiuyong,\r\nPresident of the International Court of Justice, for the\r\ncomprehensive annual report of the Court, contained in\r\ndocument A/60/4. We commend the Court for the\r\nbroad range of activities covered in the report and for\r\nits commitment to upholding the values of international\r\nlaw. We also express our thanks for the report of the\r\nSecretary-General in document A/60/330.\r\nNigeria was one of the first States to accept the\r\ncompulsory jurisdiction of the Court. We note that only\r\n65 States have accepted the Court’s compulsory\r\njurisdiction. That is not encouraging, given the fact\r\nthat United Nations membership now stands at 191\r\nStates. Consequently, we call on Member States to\r\naccept the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction. Indeed,\r\nNigeria’s acceptance of the Court’s October 2002\r\ndecision on the land and maritime boundaries dispute\r\nwith Cameroon is based on its respect for, and\r\nrecognition of, the Court.\r\nNigeria commends the Court’s important role in\r\npropagating the rule of law within the United Nations\r\nsystem and the international community. One cannot\r\noveremphasize the Court’s invaluable contribution to\r\ninternational peace and security through its impartial\r\nand authoritative decisions as well as its sound\r\nadvisory opinions.\r\nNigeria welcomes the increasing confidence of\r\nStates in the Court’s ability to resolve their disputes.\r\nEvidence of that is the 300 bilateral and multilateral\r\ntreaties that accept the Court’s jurisdiction in resolving\r\ndisputes arising from the application or interpretation\r\nof those treaties. It is gratifying to note that the Court\r\nhas disposed of 10 cases during the period under\r\nreview. It is encouraging that an increasing number of\r\nStates have recently submitted specific disputes to the\r\nCourt by special agreement.\r\nNigeria commends the adoption of the amended\r\nPractice Direction V and the promulgation of new\r\nPractice Directions X, XI, and XII. We believe that this\r\nwill enhance the effectiveness and the efficiency of the\r\nCourt.\r\nWe share the concern of the President with\r\nrespect to the Court’s budget. We recall that for the\r\nbiennium 2004-2005, the Court had specifically\r\nrequested a modest expansion of its Computerization\r\nDivision, with the employment of an additional\r\nprofessional officer. Accordingly, we reaffirm our\r\nsupport for adequate funding to enable the Court to\r\nmeet its needs. In particular, that will help the Court\r\nkeep pace with advances in modern technology as\r\nrequired for the discharge of its functions.\r\nFinally, I would like to reiterate Nigeria’s\r\ncommitment to the Statute of the Court. We\r\nacknowledge the Court’s immense contribution to the\r\npacific settlement of disputes between and among\r\nStates and to the progressive development of\r\ninternational law and the rule of law.\r\nMr. Mekdad (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in\r\nArabic): At the outset, my delegation would like to\r\nexpress its sincere thanks to Judge Shi Jiuyong,\r\nPresident of the International Court of Justice, for all\r\nhis efforts to strengthen the rule of international law. I\r\nwould also like to express my appreciation for his\r\npresentation of the comprehensive report of the\r\n25\r\nA/60/PV.39\r\nInternational Court of Justice on its work in the past\r\nyear (A/60/41). The Court is a principal organ of the\r\nUnited Nations for effectively ensuring the rule of law\r\nin international relations and the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes in an increasingly complex world.\r\nSyria wishes once again to thank the principal\r\njudicial organ of the United Nations for its ongoing\r\ncontribution to the development of international law\r\nand the promotion of justice among States.\r\nSyria underlines the agreement of world leaders\r\nat the September summit concerning the importance of\r\nthe primacy of law within States and in international\r\nrelations. Syria has long given attention and support to\r\nthe work of the Court. That is not at all unusual, as our\r\nregion, and my country Syria, saw the first\r\nmanifestations of a legal system thousands of years\r\nago.\r\nWe affirm that the United Nations Charter\r\ngoverns the conduct of current international relations,\r\nand the Court’s Statute gives the Court full authority to\r\nfulfil that task. That is attested to by the intense\r\njudicial work accomplished by the Court in the period\r\ncovered by the report, which reflects the fact that the\r\nCourt has become a very dynamic institution. We hope\r\nthat the Court’s activities will be further expanded in\r\nthe future. The Court’s heavy workload is due to the\r\nfact that the Court embodies the principle of the\r\nequality of States before international law and that the\r\nCourt is an impartial third party that functions as the\r\nguardian of international law, working to maintain a\r\ncoherent international legal system.\r\nThe report of the International Court of Justice,\r\npresented by Judge Shi Jiuyong, the Court’s President,\r\ndescribes the various cases recently taken up by the\r\nCourt, the outcomes of those cases and the respect\r\nshown by Member States for the Court’s decisions.\r\nWe thank the Court for its advisory opinions,\r\nwhich represent the truth. Compliance with the Court’s\r\nadvisory opinions means compliance with the law,\r\nbecause justice is not an abstract concept.\r\nImplementation of legal principles is what matters.\r\nIn that regard, I would like to recall the Court’s\r\nadvisory opinion on Israel’s construction of the\r\nseparation wall in the occupied Palestinian territory.\r\nThe Court decided that the wall’s construction violated\r\ninternational law and that Israel had an obligation to\r\nput an end to those violations of international law and\r\ncompensate Palestinians for the damages incurred by\r\nthe wall’s construction. The advisory opinion also\r\nstressed that all Member States are bound not to\r\nrecognize the legality of the construction of the wall,\r\nand that it was incumbent on Israel to abide by\r\ninternational humanitarian law as recognized under the\r\nFourth Geneva Convention. In spite of the Court’s\r\nadvisory opinion that stresses the need that the United\r\nNations, including the Security Council, should take\r\nmeasures to end the illegal status resulting from the\r\nconstruction of the wall, it is unfortunate that the\r\nSecurity Council did not exercise its role owing to the\r\npractice of selectivity on the part of some of its\r\nmembers and their protection of violations of\r\ninternational law when it serves their own politics and\r\ninterests.\r\nToday, the United Nations is undergoing an\r\nextremely important reform. It would be wise to extend\r\nthat reform to the entire Organization, including the\r\nstrengthening of the Court’s role and authority. The\r\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly\r\nin September emphasized the importance of working to\r\nthat end. It is our hope that Member States will make\r\nthat objective their top priority so that the necessary\r\nbalance in the methods of work of the various bodies\r\nof the United Nations system can be undertaken.\r\nThe International Court of Justice must fulfil its\r\nmandate vis-à-vis the work of other organs of the\r\nUnited Nations, including the Security Council, whose\r\nagenda has multiplied immensely and has, in some\r\ncases, exceeded its area of competence. The fact that\r\nsome countries discuss the extent of the legitimacy of\r\nSecurity Council resolutions is a clear warning of the\r\nurgent need to strengthen the role of the International\r\nCourt of Justice.\r\nWe expect the Court to take up many further\r\ncases in the near future, as the Court must do if it is to\r\nbe an effective judicial instrument at the service of the\r\ninternational community. In turn, we must provide the\r\nCourt with the necessary financial and human\r\nresources to carry out its functions. The proposal to\r\nallocate 1 per cent of the Organization’s budget to\r\ncover the Court’s expenses is unacceptable if we are\r\ntruly serious about upholding the rule of law in\r\ninternational relations. Thus, Syria will support any\r\nproposals aimed at improving the financial situation of\r\nthe Court, including the conditions of the judges’\r\nterms. In this context, Syria encourages all States to\r\nmake voluntary contributions to the Trust Fund.\r\n26\r\nA/60/PV.39\r\nSyria greatly values the Court and the role it\r\nplays and functions it undertakes. Syria commits itself\r\nto make all necessary efforts and to cooperate with\r\nMember States that believe in the primacy of the law in\r\norder to strengthen the Court’s role in all its areas of\r\ncompetence.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is the\r\nwish of the General Assembly to conclude its\r\nconsideration of agenda item 74?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.10 p.m.\r\n"
