Corrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\r\n05-59007 (E)\r\n*0559007*\r\nPresident: Mr. Eliasson. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Sweden)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 9.50 a.m.\r\nRecent terrorist attacks\r\nThe President: Before turning to today’s items, I\r\nwould like to pay tribute to all those affected by the\r\nabhorrent terrorist attacks on two marketplaces and a\r\nbus in New Delhi, India, on Saturday, 29 October. On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I offer our deepest\r\nsympathy to the people and the Government of India\r\nand to the families and friends of those killed or\r\ninjured. I would also like to extend our sympathy to the\r\nvictims of other recent terrorist attacks wherever they\r\nhave been committed.\r\nI now call on the representative of India.\r\nMr. Sen (India): I do not wish to take up the time\r\nof the General Assembly, but would just like to say a\r\nfew words to express our heartfelt appreciation for the\r\nPresident’s very kind words of sympathy. This attack\r\nhas drawn universal condemnation, including from the\r\nSecretary-General. The Prime Minister has expressed\r\nour determination to continue the struggle against\r\nterrorism.\r\nWe do not regard this attack as an attack on either\r\nthe Government or the institutions of the State. It is an\r\nattack on ordinary working people, for whom the\r\nfestival of light is a way for families and civil society\r\nto get together. The ordinary working people of India\r\nwill continue to maintain that in which they have been\r\nschooled through millennia, that is, tolerance and\r\nharmony among all faiths; at the same time, they will\r\nalso maintain their unbreakable determination to resist.\r\nAs the Assembly is aware, about 60 persons have\r\nlost their lives and several hundred others have been\r\ninjured. Investigations are continuing. Many clues have\r\nbeen unearthed and some arrests have been made. I am\r\nsure that the authorities will eventually be able to lay\r\nbare who perpetrated these attacks and the\r\norganizations that were involved.\r\nOn behalf of the people of India and those\r\naffected, I once again thank the President very much\r\nfor his very kind words of sympathy.\r\nThe President: I am sure that what the\r\nrepresentative of India has said underscores the need to\r\ncontinue and intensify our work to conclude the\r\nnegotiations on a comprehensive convention on\r\nterrorism and then, later on during this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, discuss a strategy on counter-\r\nterrorism.\r\nAgenda item 7 (continued)\r\nOrganization of work, adoption of the agenda and\r\nallocation of items\r\nThird report of the General Committee\r\n(A/60/250/Add.2)\r\nThe President: In the first paragraph of its\r\nreport, the General Committee recommends to the\r\nGeneral Assembly that the item entitled “Granting of\r\n2\r\nA/60/PV.40\r\nobserver status in the General Assembly to the Ibero-\r\nAmerican Conference” be included in the agenda of the\r\ncurrent session under heading I, entitled\r\n“Organizational, administrative and other matters”.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly decides\r\nto include that item on the agenda of the current\r\nsession under heading I?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: The General Committee further\r\nrecommends that the item be allocated to the Sixth\r\nCommittee.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly decides\r\nto allocate that item to the Sixth Committee?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I should like to inform Members\r\nthat the item entitled “Granting of observer status in\r\nthe General Assembly to the Ibero-American\r\nConference” becomes item 159 on the agenda of the\r\ncurrent session.\r\nThe Chairman of the Sixth Committee will be\r\ninformed of the decision just taken by the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nIn the second paragraph of the same report, the\r\nGeneral Committee decided to recommend to the\r\nGeneral Assembly that the item entitled “Question of\r\nthe Comorian island of Mayotte” be deferred to the\r\nsixty-second session of the General Assembly and that\r\nit be included in the provisional agenda of that session.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly approves that\r\nrecommendation?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 84\r\nReport of the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/60/204)\r\nDraft resolution (A/60/L.13)\r\nThe President: It gives me great pleasure this\r\nmorning to extend a warm welcome to Mr. Mohamed\r\nElBaradei, Director General of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and Nobel laureate. On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I extend our sincere\r\nand heartfelt congratulations to him, and through him\r\nto the International Atomic Energy Agency, on being\r\nawarded the 2005 Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts,\r\nin the words of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, “to\r\nprevent nuclear energy from being used for military\r\npurposes and to ensure that nuclear energy for peaceful\r\npurposes is used in the safest possible way”. It is\r\nindeed well-deserved recognition of his work at a\r\ncrucial time for the future of disarmament, non-\r\nproliferation and the peaceful use of nuclear energy.\r\nOver the years since its foundation, in 1957, the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency and its leadership\r\nhave shown that, through global cooperation, we can\r\nhelp build a safer world. The Nobel Peace Prize\r\nawarded to the IAEA and its Director General is thus a\r\nmessage of encouragement for all of us in the United\r\nNations family. It strengthens us in our belief that\r\nmultilateralism is necessary in dealing with global\r\nthreats and challenges, be they poverty, global disease\r\noutbreaks, natural disasters, climate change, terrorism\r\nor the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\r\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency was\r\nestablished to promote the peaceful applications of\r\natomic energy for the benefit of humanity while\r\nsimultaneously guarding against the spread of its use\r\nfor military purposes. Adapting to new circumstances\r\nand needs over time, that mandate has evolved into\r\npromoting safeguards and verification as well as safety\r\nand security and peaceful applications of nuclear\r\nscience and technology. Since 2001 it has also\r\nemphasized protection against nuclear terrorism and\r\nattacks on nuclear facilities.\r\nIn a world of much insecurity and mistrust, the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency in recent years\r\nhas been at the forefront of international efforts to\r\nadapt the nuclear-non-proliferation regime to the new\r\nchallenges of preventing a nuclear black market from\r\nemerging and of tackling the proliferation risks related\r\nto the increasing demand for nuclear technology,\r\nincluding in particular the nuclear fuel cycle. The work\r\nof the Agency in those fields too is an important\r\ncontribution to making the world more safe and more\r\nsecure for all.\r\nWith that introduction, I am honoured to invite\r\nMr. Mohamed ElBaradei, Director General of the\r\nIAEA, to the podium to introduce the Agency’s annual\r\nreport.\r\n3\r\nA/60/PV.40\r\nMr. ElBaradei (International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency): I am grateful to you, Mr. President, for your\r\nkind words about the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency (IAEA) and me. As you rightly stated, the\r\nNobel Peace Prize awarded to the Agency highlights\r\nthe serious challenges we face in curbing the\r\nproliferation of nuclear weapons, protecting ourselves\r\nagainst nuclear terrorism and moving forward with our\r\ncommitment to creating a world free from nuclear\r\nweapons. I view the Prize as recognition of the IAEA’s\r\nceaseless efforts to ensure that nuclear energy is used\r\nexclusively for peaceful purposes and with a high level\r\nof safety and security. I also view it as a timely\r\naffirmation of the value and importance of multilateral\r\napproaches to addressing most, if not all, of the\r\nchallenges we face in creating a global security system\r\nthat is inclusive, equitable and effective.\r\nEach year the delivery of the IAEA’s annual\r\nreport to the General Assembly is a time for reflection,\r\nbut today perhaps more than usual. The year 2005\r\nmarks 100 years since Albert Einstein’s ground-\r\nbreaking work began to unlock the secrets of the atom.\r\nIt is the sixtieth anniversary of the first, and hopefully\r\nonly, uses of nuclear weapons, at Hiroshima and\r\nNagasaki. And last year marked half a century since a\r\nnuclear power plant first supplied energy to the\r\nelectricity grid in what is now the Russian Federation.\r\nAs I begin a new term of office at the Agency,\r\nthis is also a time for me to review our progress and\r\nrenew our vision. Today I would like to highlight\r\ndevelopments related to each part of the Agency’s\r\nmission — namely, technology, safety and\r\nverification — and then to outline a few objectives for\r\nthe future.\r\nOver the past few years, we have witnessed\r\nconsiderable change in attitudes towards nuclear\r\nenergy. Fast-growing global energy demands, an\r\nincreased emphasis on the security of energy supplies\r\nand the risk of climate change are driving a renewed\r\nconsideration of nuclear power.\r\nNear-term nuclear growth remains centred in\r\nAsia and Eastern Europe, which together account for\r\n22 of the 24 units now under construction. The Russian\r\nFederation intends to double its nuclear generating\r\ncapacity by 2020. China plans a nearly six-fold\r\nexpansion in capacity by the same date. And India\r\nanticipates a ten-fold increase by 2022. Elsewhere,\r\nplans remain more modest, but it is clear that nuclear\r\nenergy is re-emerging in a way that few would have\r\npredicted just a few years ago.\r\nFor a number of years, I have advocated the\r\nconsideration of multilateral approaches to the nuclear\r\nfuel cycle, so as to address challenges posed by\r\nproliferation-sensitive operations such as those related\r\nto uranium enrichment and plutonium separation. Last\r\nyear I informed the Assembly of my establishment of a\r\ngroup of senior experts to explore options for\r\nmultilateral control of fuel-cycle facilities. Their work\r\nhas helped to shape an understanding of how such\r\ncontrols might be put in place.\r\nMuch attention is already being given to the first\r\nstep, that is, to provide the assurance of supply of\r\nnuclear fuel and technology at competitive market\r\nprices. By doing so we would remove the incentive for\r\ncountries to develop indigenous fuel-cycle capabilities.\r\nMoreover, given the rising expectation for the\r\nexpanded use of nuclear power in many countries,\r\nthose multilateral approaches could, in my view, offer\r\nadditional advantages in terms of safety, security and\r\neconomics.\r\nCancer is a major health concern, and the number\r\nof cancer cases is rising — most rapidly in developing\r\ncountries. Access to life-saving radiotherapy is limited\r\nor non-existent in many areas. By way of comparison,\r\nconsider that in Austria, where the Agency is\r\nheadquartered, we have approximately one\r\nradiotherapy machine for every 270,000 people;\r\nwhereas for most African countries the ratio is about\r\none machine for every 10 million people, and some\r\ncountries have no such facilities at all.\r\nThe Agency’s Programme of Action for Cancer\r\nTherapy is working to increase our capacity to assist\r\ndeveloping Member States by mobilizing more\r\nresources to address personnel, infrastructure,\r\ntechnology and training needs. Addressing the\r\nchallenge of cancer is an intrinsically multidisciplinary\r\neffort. We are, therefore, seeking to build partnerships\r\nwith key organizations, such as the World Health\r\nOrganization, in order to achieve a coordinated and\r\nholistic approach.\r\nThe use of isotopes and radiation in food and\r\nagricultural research and development continues to\r\nyield rich results. To give just one example, in Peru\r\nharsh local environments, characterized by depleted\r\nsaline soils and high altitudes, have traditionally\r\ncaused many crops to fail. Through the use of radiation\r\n4\r\nA/60/PV.40\r\nmutation to create new varieties of barley and rice, and\r\nthe active involvement of Peruvian farmers in the\r\nbreeding process, agricultural productivity and income\r\nhave increased.\r\nNuclear techniques are also increasingly being\r\nused in environmental applications. The Agency’s\r\nMarine Environment Laboratory in Monaco has\r\nbecome a world leader in the use of radionuclides to\r\ntrack ocean currents, as well as in using isotopes to\r\ntrack carbon dioxide absorption in the ocean’s surface,\r\nan important technique in the study of climate change.\r\nThis year the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP) funded the Agency’s coordination\r\nof an extensive pollution survey of marine sediments\r\nfrom 35 shipwrecks sunk in Iraq’s waterways. The\r\nresults will help to ensure that salvage operations can\r\nbe conducted with minimal risk to humans and the\r\nmarine environment.\r\nRecent years have also witnessed considerable\r\nevolution in nuclear safety and security. When I\r\naddressed this body just four years ago, I urged greater\r\nparticipation in nuclear-related international\r\nconventions, promoted the benefits of all countries\r\nusing IAEA safety standards and called for the creation\r\nof a Chernobyl forum to set the record straight on the\r\neffects of the 1986 accident and improve the\r\ncoordination of remediation efforts. In the week\r\nfollowing the 11 September terrorist attacks in the\r\nUnited States of America, the Agency’s General\r\nConference issued a resolution calling for a sweeping\r\nreview of the Agency’s nuclear security programme.\r\nSince that time, we have made progress on multiple\r\nfronts.\r\nThe Convention on Nuclear Safety has evolved\r\ninto a forum for more substantive discussion on safety\r\nissues, incorporating feedback and lessons learned\r\nfrom the results of IAEA peer reviews.\r\nI am also pleased to report that IAEA safety\r\nstandards are receiving increasingly broad acceptance\r\nas the global reference for protecting people and the\r\nenvironment against nuclear accidents and harmful\r\nradiation exposure. The strong relationship between the\r\nAgency’s operational safety standards and its safety\r\nreview services has been an important element in\r\nevaluating and enhancing the effectiveness of the\r\nstandards. I would therefore urge all countries to take\r\nfull advantage of those services.\r\nI am also pleased to note that, just last month, a\r\nreport on Chernobyl’s legacy was issued. It was based\r\non the extensive work of the Chernobyl Forum, which\r\nhas provided the best scientific analyses of the health,\r\nenvironmental and social impacts of the 1986 accident.\r\nThat work reflected the consensus achieved among the\r\nrelevant United Nations agencies and programmes and\r\nthe Governments of Belarus, the Russian Federation\r\nand Ukraine. The organizations involved are also\r\ndiscussing cooperation on new initiatives to assist local\r\npopulations with safe food production and improved\r\nhealth care and in regaining control over their own\r\nlivelihoods.\r\nThe International Convention for the Suppression\r\nof Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, which was adopted by\r\nthe General Assembly in April, requires States parties\r\nto criminalize the unlawful possession and use of\r\nradioactive material and the unlawful use or damage of\r\nnuclear facilities. Security Council resolution 1540\r\n(2004), which was adopted last year, calls on all\r\ncountries to develop and maintain effective physical\r\nprotection and border controls and to use law\r\nenforcement efforts to detect and combat illicit\r\ntrafficking. And in July, parties to the Convention on\r\nPhysical Protection of Nuclear Material agreed on\r\nmajor changes that would make it legally binding for\r\ncountries to protect nuclear facilities and material in\r\npeaceful domestic use, in storage and in transport.\r\nI urge all States to fully and promptly implement\r\nthe provisions of those conventions and resolution\r\n1540 (2004). The Agency stands ready to offer\r\nassistance to all States in that regard by providing legal\r\nand technical advice, training and peer reviews.\r\nFew areas of the Agency’s activities have\r\nundergone as much major expansion in so short a\r\nperiod as has our nuclear security programme over the\r\npast four years. The events of 11 September 2001 were\r\nfollowed rapidly by the development of a\r\ncomprehensive nuclear security plan. A Nuclear\r\nSecurity Fund was established, to which our member\r\nStates immediately and generously began to contribute.\r\nIn the intervening four years, the Agency has\r\nconducted more than 100 nuclear-security field\r\nmissions. Approximately 1,500 individuals from all\r\nregions have received IAEA training in measures\r\nrelated to preventing nuclear and radiological\r\nterrorism. The results are tangible: strengthened\r\nphysical protection at nuclear facilities; recovery and\r\nenhanced security for hundreds of high-intensity\r\n5\r\nA/60/PV.40\r\nradioactive sources; increased security awareness\r\namong responsible national officials; better\r\ncooperation among international law enforcement\r\norganizations; enhanced detection capabilities at border\r\ncrossings and improved preparedness to respond to\r\nincidents.\r\nIn the area of nuclear verification, as with other\r\nareas of Agency activity, times have changed in recent\r\nyears. We have clearly made progress on some fronts,\r\nbut perhaps regressed on others. The Agency’s\r\nresumption of inspections in Iraq in 2002, the\r\nsubsequent termination of inspections in the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, our more\r\nrecent investigation of clandestine nuclear programmes\r\nin the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran, the discovery of illicit nuclear\r\nprocurement networks, and the lack of agreement at the\r\n2005 Review Conference of the States Parties to the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\n(NPT) have put the spotlight on an unprecedented array\r\nof challenges to the non-proliferation and arms control\r\nregime.\r\nThe Agency’s verification system has shown\r\ngreat resourcefulness and resiliency in dealing with\r\nmany of those challenges. We have rapidly initiated\r\nintensive verification efforts in a number of countries\r\nand investigated the illicit procurement network. We\r\nhave strengthened the verification system through\r\nenhanced use of satellite imagery, environmental\r\nsampling and a variety of new technologies.\r\nAs part of strengthening the safeguards system,\r\nwe have begun applying the so-called integrated\r\nsafeguards — a more effective approach that combines\r\ntraditional safeguards with more advanced methods of\r\nanalysis and enhanced access under the Additional\r\nProtocol. We are now applying integrated safeguards in\r\nmultiple countries, including Japan and Canada, the\r\ntwo largest nuclear programmes under safeguards. We\r\nhave also adjusted our policy on small quantities\r\nprotocols to ensure more effective verification in all\r\ncountries with comprehensive safeguards agreements,\r\nand we have established a Committee on Safeguards to\r\nexamine additional ways and means to strengthen the\r\nsystem.\r\nIn dealing with all those verification challenges,\r\nwe have maintained our objectivity and independence,\r\nand thereby strengthened our credibility. In short, the\r\npast few years have continued to underscore the central\r\nimportance of the Agency’s role in combating\r\nproliferation.\r\nThe IAEA’s technical cooperation programme\r\ncontinues to be a principal mechanism for\r\nimplementing our basic mission — “Atoms for\r\nPeace” — supporting activities related to a host of\r\nnuclear technology applications, as well as safety,\r\nsecurity and safeguards activities. We have greatly\r\nincreased the effectiveness of the Technical\r\nCooperation Programme in recent years by shifting\r\nfrom a technology-driven to a needs-driven approach\r\nfocused on achieving tangible socio-economic benefits\r\nin member States. The current technical cooperation\r\nstrategy highlights three elements essential for\r\nsuccessful delivery of the Programme: strong\r\nGovernment commitment, high quality of technical\r\ncooperation projects, and adequate funding.\r\nWhen I began my second term of office in 2001, I\r\ncalled for increased public outreach to explain the\r\nIAEA’s contributions in all areas of our work. Little did\r\nI realize at that time the degree of public exposure we\r\nwere to receive.\r\nIn the four intervening years, the Agency’s public\r\nimage has been transformed, in large part due to\r\nemergent non-proliferation issues, but also due to our\r\nown successful efforts to raise public awareness of the\r\nimportant work of the Agency. We have substantially\r\nstepped up our Internet presence, we have revitalized\r\nour public seminar programme, and we have conducted\r\na series of media campaigns on important topics,\r\nincluding nuclear security, radiotherapy, nuclear power\r\nand — earlier this month — the Chernobyl Forum\r\nreport. The results of those efforts have been\r\nsignificant. The IAEA has moved in the public domain\r\nfrom being a relatively unknown agency to a trusted\r\ninstitution that plays a crucial role in both security and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThis rapid overview summarizes the many\r\nchanges that have occurred in nearly every area of our\r\nactivities in recent years. It also shows the ability of\r\nthe IAEA to anticipate and respond to change. As we\r\nlook to the future, we will continue to seek to meet\r\nMember States’ needs and priorities through both our\r\ntechnical cooperation and regular budget programmes.\r\nI would like here to outline some key points for the\r\nnext few years.\r\nIn the area of nuclear power, I would hope that\r\nwe would focus more explicitly on the need of energy\r\n6\r\nA/60/PV.40\r\nfor development. I was personally reminded of the\r\ncurrent global energy imbalance on a recent trip to\r\nNigeria, where per capita electricity consumption is\r\nonly about 70 kilowatt-hours per year. That contrasts\r\nsharply with, for example, the Organization for\r\nEconomic Cooperation and Development average of\r\n8,000 kilowatt-hours per year. That energy shortage in\r\ndeveloping countries is a basic impediment to\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe IAEA’s energy assessment services build a\r\nState’s capability for energy analysis and energy\r\nplanning, taking into account the country’s economic,\r\nenvironmental and social development needs. Those\r\nservices treat all energy supply options equally. They\r\nare in increasingly high demand, and we hope to\r\nexpand our capacity to offer them.\r\nThe future of nuclear power in the decades to\r\ncome will, in my view, be a function of technological\r\ninnovation — the development of new reactor and fuel-\r\ncycle technologies — to address nuclear safety,\r\nproliferation, waste generation and economic\r\nconsiderations. Many countries are collaborating on\r\ninnovative nuclear research and development for the\r\nlonger term. The IAEA International Project on\r\nInnovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycles works to\r\nensure that the future needs of all countries, including\r\ndeveloping countries, are considered when innovative\r\nnuclear systems are evaluated.\r\nA key feature of modern science is its synergy —\r\nthe way, for example, in which advances in fields such\r\nas nanotechnology, bioengineering and information\r\ntechnology build on each other to achieve greater\r\nprogress. With that in mind, we will continue to seek\r\nout new applications in which nuclear technology can\r\noffer tangible benefits to society in the medical,\r\nagricultural, environmental and other fields. To ensure\r\nthat nuclear applications have the maximum positive\r\nimpact, the IAEA will endeavour to forge more\r\nstrategic partnerships with other United Nations system\r\norganizations, international financial institutions,\r\nregional organizations and, above all, member States.\r\nThe IAEA will also continue to promote a global\r\nnuclear safety regime. That will include better\r\nharmonization of national regulatory approaches to\r\nensure at all times high-quality, independent oversight\r\nfor nuclear activities. It would also include efforts to\r\nimprove our performance in fixing the so-called weak\r\nlinks in the nuclear safety chain. Although significant\r\nefforts have been made over the past two decades to\r\nupgrade reactor safety features, with excellent results,\r\nfacilities still exist at which nuclear safety assistance\r\nmust be made a priority.\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, the Agency’s nuclear\r\nsecurity assistance efforts to date have been focused,\r\nby necessity, on helping States identify and address\r\nvulnerabilities, upgrading physical protection, and\r\nsecuring high-priority radioactive sources. But as we\r\ncontinue to build a global nuclear security framework,\r\nit is important that we develop a clearer overall picture\r\nof remaining security vulnerabilities. For example, we\r\nneed to improve our understanding of the patterns that\r\ncharacterize illicit trafficking activities in order for\r\nMember States to be provided with the information\r\nneeded to effectively combat such activities.\r\nIn the area of nuclear verification, priorities for\r\nthe coming years include universalizing the Additional\r\nProtocol so that its expanded rights of access apply\r\nequally in all States with comprehensive safeguards\r\nagreements; normalizing safeguards in Iraq; bringing\r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea back to the\r\nNPT regime; providing the required assurances about\r\nIran’s nuclear programme; and continuing to\r\ninvestigate the nature and extent of the illicit\r\nprocurement network. Clearly, too, I would hope, in the\r\nnext year or so, to make some progress with regard to\r\nestablishing better control over the sensitive parts of\r\nthe fuel cycle, namely, enrichment and reprocessing\r\nactivities.\r\nI would also urge the commencement of\r\nnegotiations at the Conference on Disarmament on a\r\ntreaty to ban the production of material for nuclear\r\nweapons — the so-called fissile material cut-off treaty.\r\nIt is essential, in my view, that we take steps to\r\neliminate both access to and production of material for\r\nnuclear weapons.\r\nClearly, much remains to be done. The lack of\r\nany agreement at the NPT Review Conference this past\r\nMay, as I just mentioned, was extremely disappointing,\r\ngiven the urgent and serious challenges we face. In the\r\nsame vein, it was also disturbing that no agreement\r\nwas reached on nuclear non-proliferation and\r\ndisarmament at the world summit last month. The\r\ncurrent challenges to international peace and security,\r\nincluding those related to nuclear non-proliferation and\r\nnuclear arms control, cannot be wished away. It is\r\nurgent and indispensable that we continue to build a\r\n7\r\nA/60/PV.40\r\nglobal security system that is equitable, inclusive and\r\neffective.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to say that the staff\r\nand management of the IAEA continue to do their\r\nutmost to make the Agency effective and efficient in\r\ncarrying out its mission, but in all its areas of activity,\r\nthe IAEA also remains dependent on the General\r\nAssembly’s commitment and partnership. I look\r\nforward to continuing that partnership in the years to\r\ncome.\r\nLet me conclude by expressing, as usual, my\r\nsincere appreciation to the Government of Austria,\r\nwhich continues to be a most gracious host to the\r\nIAEA.\r\nThe President: We extend our heartfelt\r\ncongratulations to Mr. ElBaradei and his organization\r\non being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 2005.\r\nI call on the representative of Japan to introduce\r\ndraft resolution A/60/L.13.\r\nMr. Amano (Japan): We have just heard the\r\nintroductory statement on the report of the activities of\r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for\r\n2004 by Director General Mohamed ElBaradei. The\r\nreport underlines the significant contribution being\r\nmade by the Agency to international peace and\r\nstability by promoting the peaceful use of nuclear\r\nenergy and maintaining and strengthening the nuclear\r\nnon-proliferation regime through safeguards\r\nimplementation.\r\nAs Chairman of the Board of Governors of the\r\nIAEA, I have the honour to introduce the draft\r\nresolution, contained in document A/60/L.13, on the\r\nreport of the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\n(IAEA). The draft resolution is sponsored by Albania,\r\nArgentina, Armenia, Belarus, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil,\r\nCanada, Cape Verde, Chile, the Czech Republic,\r\nDenmark, Egypt, El Salvador, Estonia, Finland,\r\nGreece, Hungary, India, Italy, Kazakhstan, Kuwait,\r\nLiechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Madagascar,\r\nMalta, Mexico, Monaco, New Zealand, Nigeria,\r\nNorway, Peru, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, the\r\nRepublic of Korea, the Republic of Moldova, Romania,\r\nthe Russian Federation, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia,\r\nSouth Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Timor-\r\nLeste, Turkey, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and the\r\nUnited States of America. It derives from a\r\nrequirement pursuant to the Agency’s statute and the\r\n1957 Agreement governing the relationship between\r\nthe Agency and the United Nations.\r\nThe draft resolution recognizes the work of the\r\nAgency and is the means by which the General\r\nAssembly takes note of the statement of the Director\r\nGeneral and the annual report, as well as the\r\nresolutions and decisions adopted by the General\r\nConference. The draft resolution, which I have the\r\nhonour of introducing today, reflects a broad agreement\r\namong the IAEA’s member States and is the result of\r\nconsultations in Vienna as well as here in New York.\r\nIn the past two years, the Agency has adopted a\r\nstreamlined approach in producing a short and simple\r\ndraft resolution. The draft resolution before the\r\nAssembly lists the relevant resolutions and decisions\r\nadopted by the General Conference at its forty-ninth\r\nregular session, held in Vienna from 26 to\r\n30 September 2005. That said, let me draw members’\r\nattention to the fact that this year’s draft resolution\r\ndiffers from the resolutions of the past two years in\r\nreferring to the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to\r\nthe IAEA and Mr. ElBaradei, and welcomes the\r\nreappointment of Mr. ElBaradei to a third four-year\r\nterm. The award will provide a great boost to the\r\nAgency’s activities in 2005 and beyond. I find it very\r\ntimely that, in remembering the use of atomic bombs\r\n60 years ago in August 1945, the Norwegian Nobel\r\nCommittee has this year highlighted the importance of\r\nnuclear non-proliferation.\r\nThe draft resolution gives an account of activities\r\nin areas of specific interest with the intention of\r\nfocusing the attention of the Assembly on the most\r\nsignificant activities of the Agency. It is my sincere\r\nhope that the present draft resolution will be adopted\r\nby consensus.\r\nMr. Abdelaziz (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): Allow\r\nme at the outset to join you, Sir, in expressing our\r\nsympathy and solidarity with India in the face of\r\nyesterday’s heinous terrorist attacks there.\r\nOn behalf of the members of the League of Arab\r\nStates, I extend our sincere appreciation to\r\nMr. Mohamed ElBaradei for his important introduction\r\ntoday of the report of the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency (IAEA) on its activities this year.\r\nBefore turning to the objective aspects of the\r\nreport, I wish first to reaffirm the pride we all feel as\r\nMembers of the United Nations and, in particular as\r\n8\r\nA/60/PV.40\r\nArab States, in the awarding to the IAEA and Director\r\nGeneral ElBaradei of this year’s Nobel Peace Prize. We\r\nconsider it to be a two-fold recognition of the role of\r\nthe IAEA and of the remarkable efforts of\r\nMr. ElBaradei to enhance the Agency’s activities,\r\ncontributing to the unanimous decision of its members\r\nto reappoint him to his important post. We wish him\r\nand the Agency every success in his new term of\r\noffice.\r\nThe Arab States appreciate the Agency’s valuable\r\nrole in strengthening international peace and security\r\nthrough its activities in the field of nuclear non-\r\nproliferation. We also recognize the Agency’s\r\nimportant contribution to the achievement of\r\ninternational priorities in the field of sustainable\r\ndevelopment through its activities and achievements in\r\nthe transfer of nuclear technology, expertise, technical\r\ncooperation, verification and nuclear safety.\r\nTechnical cooperation in the peaceful uses of\r\nnuclear energy is one of the Agency’s principal\r\nactivities, given its direct contribution to the\r\ndevelopment goals of peoples, especially those in\r\ndeveloping countries. The Arab States appreciate the\r\nAgency’s work in developing and modernizing its\r\ntechnical cooperation strategy to serve the\r\ndevelopment priorities of its members and in\r\nidentifying the vital and concrete short- and medium-\r\nterm contributions that nuclear technology can make.\r\nWe reaffirm that funding for the Agency’s work in\r\ntechnical cooperation and technology transfer must be\r\nincreased, especially since those activities are main\r\npillars of its work, as laid down in its statute.\r\nIn that regard, the Arab States would like to\r\nreaffirm their support for, and encouragement of, the\r\nIAEA’s strategy to focus on projects that provide\r\ntangible economic returns. We would also like to\r\nwelcome the practical steps taken by the Agency\r\ntowards the early holding of consultations with\r\nMember States with regard to the details of the projects\r\nthat countries would like to propose as well as to the\r\npreparation of a framework of action for every State\r\nthat incorporates projects for future cooperation in the\r\nservice of national sustainable development\r\nprogrammes.\r\nWith regard to verification and safeguards, the\r\nIAEA no doubt has a primary role to play in\r\ncompleting the conceptual framework for integrated\r\nsafeguards. However, the effectiveness of that\r\nframework will not be achieved without the\r\nuniversality of its components, at the forefront of\r\nwhich is the universality of comprehensive safeguards.\r\nMoreover, the ongoing shortcomings in achieving the\r\nuniversality of the Agency’s safeguards will jeopardize\r\nour intensive efforts towards eliminating the dangers of\r\nnuclear proliferation. The Agency must therefore seek\r\nto ensure the universal character of comprehensive\r\nsafeguards as the main pillar of the nuclear non-\r\nproliferation regime. It must also work to bring every\r\ncountry, without exception, under the safeguards\r\nregime.\r\nFor their part, the Arab States have undertaken\r\nmany initiatives at the regional and international levels\r\nto address the dangers resulting from nuclear\r\nproliferation. Since 1974, Arab countries have called\r\nfor the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in\r\nthe Middle East. That call has been the subject of an\r\nannual resolution that has been adopted by consensus\r\nby the General Assembly since 1980. In addition,\r\nthrough the IAEA, Arab countries continue to call for\r\nthe implementation of the IAEA’s comprehensive\r\nsafeguards regime at all nuclear installations in the\r\nMiddle East without exception.\r\nDespite all those initiatives to guarantee security\r\nand stability in the region, it is regrettable that Israel\r\nhas not demonstrated any serious engagement with\r\nregard to addressing the issue of nuclear proliferation\r\nin the Middle East. It continues to refuse to agree to\r\nplace all its nuclear facilities under the IAEA’s\r\ncomprehensive safeguards regime. That has had a\r\nnegative impact on all efforts aimed at dealing with the\r\nnon-proliferation of nuclear weapons in general, and in\r\nthe Middle East in particular.\r\nThe situation creates a dual responsibility for the\r\ninternational community, namely, to eliminate all the\r\ndangers posed to international peace and security by\r\nnuclear proliferation and to seek to implement the\r\nAgency’s nuclear safeguards in the Middle East. In that\r\nregard, Arab States call for support for the IAEA\r\nDirector General’s fulfilment of the mandate given to\r\nhim by the Agency’s General Conference to implement\r\nthe safeguards regime in the Middle East.\r\nForfeiting the nuclear option, declaring the region\r\na zone free of all weapons of mass destruction and\r\nplacing all the region’s nuclear installations under full-\r\nscope IAEA safeguards constitute the first steps\r\ntowards the building of confidence and achieving\r\n9\r\nA/60/PV.40\r\ncomprehensive peace in our region. This is all the more\r\ntrue given that activities not subject to the Agency’s\r\nsafeguards pose a continuous threat of environmental\r\ndisasters due either to lax safety procedures or the\r\ncareless disposal of nuclear wastes, as has been\r\ndescribed by numerous reports of United Nations and\r\nother international bodies.\r\nWith regard to nuclear security, there is no doubt\r\nas to the urgent need to support and strengthen the\r\nactivities and programmes of the Agency aimed at\r\nprotecting nuclear materials and installations and other\r\nradioactive materials from the threat of nuclear\r\nterrorism. There is also a need for the Agency to take\r\nadvantage of the nuclear terrorism agreement that has\r\nbeen signed by over 100 States to date, in order to\r\nbring under control those nuclear materials currently\r\nunder no international supervision or to monitor and to\r\navert the risk of their falling into the hands of\r\nterrorists.\r\nGiven the foregoing, we would like to reaffirm\r\nour position with regard to the production of fissile\r\nmaterials, which is based on the need to place all\r\nnuclear materials, including nuclear stocks, under\r\ninternational supervision. We also emphasize the need\r\nto conclude an international agreement on this matter\r\nas soon as possible.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to express the\r\nappreciation of Arab States for the intensive and\r\neffective efforts made at Vienna under the leadership of\r\nJapan to prepare the draft resolution that will be\r\nintroduced to the Assembly today. I would also like to\r\nreaffirm the continued support of Arab States for the\r\nwork of the IAEA to strengthen its ability to address\r\nfuture challenges and to reiterate our appreciation and\r\ncongratulations to the Agency and its Director General\r\nfor their remarkable achievements in maintaining\r\nhuman security. Those efforts have been crowned with\r\nsuccess by the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize,\r\nwhich they have earned and well deserve.\r\nMr. Thomson (United Kingdom): I have the\r\nhonour to speak on behalf of the European Union (EU)\r\nand the countries that have aligned themselves with\r\nthis statement: Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey, Croatia,\r\nAlbania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the former Yugoslav\r\nRepublic of Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro,\r\nIceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Ukraine and the\r\nRepublic of Moldova.\r\nAllow me, first of all, on behalf of the European\r\nUnion, to congratulate the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency (IAEA) and Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei, its\r\nDirector General, on their well-deserved receipt of the\r\nNobel Peace Prize. That is welcome recognition for the\r\nwork of the Agency over many years. We would also\r\nlike to thank Mr. ElBaradei for his statement on the\r\nreport of the IAEA’s activities in 2004. The EU\r\ncommends the secretariat of the IAEA and its Director\r\nGeneral for the excellent work done by the Agency and\r\nfor the importance of the results achieved last year. The\r\nEU member States welcome the outcome of the IAEA’s\r\nforty-ninth General Conference, which was held in\r\nVienna from 26 to 30 September 2005, and the\r\nresolutions and decisions that were adopted at that\r\nConference.\r\nI should perhaps just underline that the EU’s\r\nmember States are all sponsors of the draft resolution\r\n(A/60/L.13) on the report of the IAEA, and that they\r\nfully support the report’s content. The draft resolution\r\nreflects broad agreement among the IAEA’s member\r\nStates and is the result of consultations in Vienna. In\r\nthat regard, we commend the efforts of the Chairman\r\nof the IAEA Board of Governors and hope that the\r\npresent draft resolution will be adopted by consensus.\r\nAllow me to briefly touch upon a few elements of\r\nthe role of the IAEA within the global nuclear non-\r\nproliferation regime and its contributions to it, as\r\nillustrated by the report submitted to the Assembly\r\nunder this agenda item.\r\nThe EU is fully committed to the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and to\r\nthe three mutually reinforcing pillars on which it is\r\nbased. On 25 April this year, the EU updated its\r\ncommon position. Our commitment has only been\r\nreinforced by the disappointing Review Conference\r\nand the inability to reach consensus, at the world\r\nsummit, on language on non-proliferation and\r\ndisarmament. These shortfalls in international political\r\nwill were disheartening to the EU, which made clear\r\nthroughout the Conference its strong support for a\r\nstrengthened nuclear non-proliferation and\r\ndisarmament regime.\r\nThe EU considers a nuclear non-proliferation\r\nregime of universal character, supported by a strong\r\nsystem of international safeguards, to be an essential\r\nprerequisite for collective security. Challenges to the\r\nTreaty and to the non-proliferation regime have in\r\n10\r\nA/60/PV.40\r\nrecent years underscored the necessity of full\r\ncompliance and the need to work actively towards\r\nuniversal accession to the NPT. In that regard, the EU\r\nwill continue its efforts to maintain the authority and\r\nintegrity of the Treaty and calls on those States not yet\r\nparties to the NPT to join the treaty as non-nuclear-\r\nweapon States.\r\nThe international safeguards system of the IAEA\r\nis an essential part of this global nuclear non-\r\nproliferation regime. These technical instruments\r\nprovide necessary support for the political goal of\r\nsustaining an environment in which there can be\r\npeaceful use of nuclear energy without the diversion of\r\nnuclear material to nuclear- weapon programmes. In\r\nthat context, the EU recognizes the continued need for\r\na properly funded safeguards system that is both\r\neffective and cost-efficient and therefore credible,\r\nrobust and complied with.\r\nThe universal adoption and implementation of\r\ncomprehensive safeguards agreements, and of\r\nAdditional Protocols to them, is a prerequisite to an\r\neffective and credible safeguards system. In particular,\r\nthe measures contained in the Additional Protocol are\r\ncrucial to strengthening the IAEA’s ability to detect\r\npossible undeclared nuclear material and activities and\r\nprovide assurance about the absence of such activities.\r\nThe EU therefore continues to support universalization\r\nof the Additional Protocol and urges those that have\r\nnot yet completed comprehensive safeguards\r\nagreements with Additional Protocols to do so as a\r\nmatter of urgency. The EU considers that\r\ncomprehensive safeguards agreements, together with\r\nAdditional Protocols, constitute the current IAEA\r\nverification standard.\r\nThe NPT confers a set of interrelated and\r\nmutually reinforcing obligations and rights on States\r\nparties to it. Full compliance with the Treaty and the\r\nobligations that derive from it is of fundamental\r\nimportance. Therefore, the EU reiterates the specific\r\ncalls by the IAEA for compliance. The challenges to\r\ncompliance with the safeguards agreements must be\r\naddressed in a manner that upholds the integrity of the\r\nTreaty and the authority of the IAEA safeguards\r\nsystem, including through referral by the IAEA to the\r\nSecurity Council, as appropriate.\r\nThe EU attaches the utmost importance to a high\r\nlevel of nuclear safety worldwide. Although safety is a\r\nnational responsibility, international cooperation on\r\nthis issue is indispensable. Nuclear safety is a\r\npermanent concern of the international community, and\r\nits continuous improvement should be the aim of all\r\nIAEA member States. The EU commends the Director\r\nGeneral and the IAEA secretariat for having continued\r\nto help the member States during the past year to\r\nestablish and maintain a stringent nuclear-security\r\nframework for nuclear installations and materials, and\r\nit welcomes the recent amendment to the Convention\r\non the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. The EU\r\nurges States parties to ratify the amended Convention\r\nat the earliest opportunity. In addition, we call upon all\r\nStates that have not yet done so to adhere to the\r\nConvention and its amendment, and, until such time as\r\nthe amendment has entered into force, for all States to\r\nact in accordance with the object and purpose of the\r\namendment.\r\nFinally, the fight against terrorism and the\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction deserves a\r\nspecific mention, as it represents a challenge of\r\nparamount importance to the international community.\r\nThe EU member States strongly support all appropriate\r\nmeasures aimed at preventing terrorists from acquiring\r\nnuclear weapons. While the primary responsibility for\r\nthe necessary nuclear security rests with Member\r\nStates, the IAEA clearly has an essential role to play in\r\npreventing and combating nuclear terrorism. In that\r\nrespect, we look forward to cooperation between the\r\nIAEA and the Security Council Committee established\r\npursuant to resolution 1540 (2004). We welcome, too,\r\nthe work that the Agency is engaged in with member\r\nStates to address the issue of illicit nuclear trade.\r\nTo conclude, we all live in an increasingly\r\ninterdependent world in which we have to ensure our\r\nown and one another’s security and safety. At the same\r\ntime, all of us are under an obligation to continue to\r\nensure appropriate access to the benefits of nuclear\r\nknowledge, technology, equipment and materials, as\r\nprovided for under article IV of the NPT. The IAEA\r\nhas a central and indispensable role in that\r\narrangement. We are pleased to note the Agency’s\r\ndecision that the monetary award accompanying the\r\nNobel Peace Prize will be used for funding the needs\r\nof developing countries in the peaceful application of\r\nnuclear energy.\r\nThe EU reiterates its full support for the IAEA\r\nand is pleased to co-sponsor the draft resolution on the\r\nreport of the International Atomic Energy Agency that\r\nis before the Assembly.\r\n11\r\nA/60/PV.40\r\nMr. Loedel (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): I have\r\nthe honour to take the floor on behalf of the\r\nMERCOSUR member States, Argentina, Brazil,\r\nParaguay and Uruguay, and its associated States,\r\nBolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and\r\nVenezuela, to reiterate our full, active and ongoing\r\ncommitment to the objectives of the international\r\ncommunity in the areas of non-proliferation, nuclear\r\ndisarmament and the promotion of the peaceful uses of\r\nnuclear energy, with a guaranteed right for all States to\r\nengage in the research, production and use of nuclear\r\nenergy for peaceful purposes.\r\nIn that regard, we would like to underline the fact\r\nthat the peaceful development of nuclear energy\r\nrequires the establishment of an unequivocal\r\nenvironment of mutual trust that can be built only on\r\nthe basis of fully transparent activities. We believe that\r\nit is mandatory for every responsible member of the\r\ninternational community to continue resolutely to make\r\nprogress towards finding a solution to the problems\r\nposed by proliferation in order to ensure safe access for\r\nall peoples to the benefits that nuclear energy offers.\r\nTherefore, it is important to highlight the efforts\r\nof the Agency and of MERCOSUR and its associated\r\nStates to establish a strong and effective verification\r\nmechanism whose implementation should be rational,\r\nnot automatic. In that respect, the Agency should be\r\nurged to improve the effectiveness of safeguards\r\nimplementation with a view to achieving, inter alia, a\r\nframework of integrated safeguards.\r\nThe world is now experiencing a critical and very\r\nimportant phase with regard to the shared objectives\r\nthat inspire the spirit of the Agency. MERCOSUR and\r\nits associated States share that spirit and believe in the\r\nfree right of every country to responsibly develop the\r\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy at every stage and in\r\nfulfilment of international commitments. We therefore\r\nwelcome the new members of the Agency and hope\r\nthat they can contribute to the search for consensus,\r\nwhich will make it possible to increase transparency,\r\nconfidence and legitimacy with regard to the decisions\r\ntaken in that forum.\r\nWe are convinced that, in the near future, nuclear\r\nenergy will have a fundamental role, not only in clean\r\nenergy production but also in human health,\r\nagriculture, industry, food preservation, water\r\ndesalination and other peaceful applications. Proof of\r\nthat can be seen in the significant resources that the\r\nAgency has devoted to those areas, as reflected in the\r\nresolutions adopted at the most recent General\r\nConference and in the policies implemented by many\r\ncountries at the domestic level.\r\nSpecial mention should be made of the Common\r\nSystem for Accounting and Control of Nuclear\r\nMaterials implemented by the Brazilian-Argentine\r\nAgency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear\r\nMaterials, which continues to establish parameters for\r\ncooperation between the Argentine Republic and the\r\nFederative Republic of Brazil. We are promoting the\r\nprogressive strengthening of cooperation between the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency and the Brazilian-\r\nArgentine Agency to ensure effective and more\r\nefficient implementation of the safeguards of the\r\nQuadripartite Agreement.\r\nFinally, MERCOSUR and its associated States\r\nwish in particular to congratulate the Director General\r\nand the Agency on the Nobel Peace Prize with which\r\nthey were rightly honoured a few days ago. That is\r\nanother demonstration of the great importance of the\r\nAgency’s tireless work for the sake of a better world\r\nand reaffirms the relevance of Mr. ElBaradei’s election\r\nto continue leading the Agency for a third term.\r\nMr. Chaudhry (Pakistan): On behalf of the\r\nPakistan delegation, I express the heartiest felicitations\r\nto Director General ElBaradei and the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for having received the\r\nNobel Peace Prize. That is well-deserved recognition\r\nof the vital work and important achievements of\r\nMr. ElBaradei and of the Agency. We also warmly\r\ncongratulate Mr. ElBaradei on his reappointment as\r\nIAEA Director General for another term. Both the\r\nNobel Prize and his re-election reflect the confidence\r\nplaced by the international community in\r\nMr. ElBaradei’s dynamic leadership in a complex and\r\nchallenging international environment. We assure\r\nMr. ElBaradei and his colleagues of our full support\r\nand cooperation with a view to achieving progress and\r\nprosperity for all.\r\nWe continue to agree with the Agency’s\r\nassessment that global socio-economic development\r\nneeds will require a large increase in the supply of\r\nenergy in the coming decades. The role of nuclear\r\nenergy will be crucial in supplying part of that\r\nrequirement, since nuclear power can serve the goals of\r\nsustainable economic growth and environmental\r\nprotection.\r\n12\r\nA/60/PV.40\r\nWe note with interest that 60 per cent of all new\r\nnuclear power reactors are being built in the\r\ndeveloping world. The Agency reported last year that\r\n20 of the 31 reactors under construction worldwide\r\nwere located in Asia and that 19 of the 28 reactors to\r\nbe connected to the grids were in the Far East and\r\nSouth Asia. The pace of the construction of those\r\nreactors could be further increased if most States were\r\nnot subjected to undue restrictions. The Agency’s role\r\nin the transfer of safe technology to developing\r\ncountries has assumed added significance. We hope\r\nthat the Agency will formulate a comprehensive policy\r\nto facilitate that objective.\r\nAs one of the earliest members of the IAEA,\r\nPakistan has long been a strong advocate of promoting\r\nand harnessing nuclear technology for peace, progress\r\nand prosperity for all. We attach the highest importance\r\nto the Agency’s Technical Cooperation Programme. We\r\nhave benefited from and contributed to the Programme\r\nthrough training, the provision of experts and the\r\nhosting of seminars and workshops. We are pleased to\r\nnote that the overall implementation rate of the\r\nAgency’s technical cooperation activities in Pakistan\r\nduring 2004 achieved a record high of 75.8 per cent.\r\nWe look forward to the strengthening and expansion of\r\nthe role of technical cooperation and its contribution to\r\nthe economic progress of developing countries.\r\nIn recent years, Pakistan’s economy has\r\nexperienced a high level of growth. The Government of\r\nPakistan has launched a 25-year energy security plan to\r\nrespond to that high growth rate and to meet the rising\r\ndemand for energy. Nuclear power generation is an\r\nindispensable element of Pakistan’s national energy\r\nstrategy. By the year 2030, our per capita consumption\r\nof electricity is expected to rise to only 3,920 kilowatt-\r\nhours (kWh) per year, as compared with the current\r\n13,800 kWh per year in the developed world. With a\r\ngrowing population and an expanding economy, on the\r\none hand, and a projected rise in the share of coal-\r\nproduced energy from the current 6.5 per cent to 19 per\r\ncent in 2030, on the other, our limited fossil fuel\r\nresources present the great challenge as we try to strike\r\na balance between pollution and sustained economic\r\ngrowth. Our energy plan envisages a substantial\r\nincrease in nuclear electricity generation by the year\r\n2030, representing an increase in the share of nuclear\r\nenergy from the current 0.8 per cent to 4.2 per cent.\r\nFor more than 30 years, Pakistan’s two nuclear\r\npower plants, the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant and the\r\nChashma Nuclear Power Plant — both of which\r\noperate under IAEA safeguards — have had excellent\r\noperational and safety records. A reliable infrastructure\r\nhas enabled us to commence work on another nuclear\r\npower station, the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant II. As\r\nwe seek to operationalize our energy security plan, we\r\nenvisage the importation of nuclear plants and other\r\nrelevant civilian nuclear technology. Given our record\r\nof safety, the application of IAEA safeguards to our\r\ncivilian nuclear power plants and the strict controls in\r\nplace for all our nuclear facilities, programmes and\r\ntechnologies, Pakistan expects that the international\r\ncommunity will lend its support and cooperation to\r\nmeet our rising needs for nuclear power generation and\r\nits various applications in a number of areas.\r\nPakistan highly values the commendable role\r\nbeing played by the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency in the development and transfer of peaceful\r\nnuclear technology in agricultural, food, human health,\r\nwater resources management, environmental protection\r\nand industrial applications. We share the Agency’s\r\nview that many of those applications are proving to be\r\nimportant tools in social and economic development\r\naround the world.\r\nWe are pleased to note that the IAEA-assisted\r\nprogramme to set up a nuclear desalination plant at the\r\nKarachi Nuclear Power Plant is making good progress.\r\nThe desalination plant, which will have a capacity of\r\n1,600 cubic metres per day, should be operational by\r\nthe year 2007.\r\nPakistan’s four nuclear agriculture centres are\r\nengaged in helping farmers to grow and harvest more\r\ncrops. Our first commercial food irradiation plant is\r\nnow under construction and should be operational by\r\nthe end of next year. It is located next to the existing\r\nirradiation facility for medical products.\r\nThe 13 nuclear medicine and oncology centres\r\noperated by the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission\r\ncontinue to provide facilities to more than a third of a\r\nmillion patients per year. The Government of Pakistan\r\nis planning to establish as many as five more nuclear\r\nmedical centres.\r\nWe accord the highest level of importance to the\r\nsafety and security of our nuclear installations,\r\nparticularly as we expand our nuclear power generation\r\ncapacity for economic development. Pakistan has\r\nsuccessfully established a strong safety culture in its\r\nnuclear activities. We are diligently adhering to the\r\n13\r\nA/60/PV.40\r\nprinciples of the Convention on Nuclear Safety, which\r\nPakistan signed at the time of its inception.\r\nWe have further strengthened security measures\r\naround our nuclear installations to avoid any\r\npossibility of sabotage or illicit acquisition or\r\ntrafficking of nuclear material. We actively participated\r\nin the proceedings leading to the amendment of the\r\nConvention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear\r\nMaterial. Pakistan was one of the first countries to\r\nratify the Convention on Nuclear Safety and has\r\nsubjected itself to review by its peers at all three\r\nmeetings of the contracting parties held since its\r\ninception.\r\nPakistan has taken additional steps to augment\r\nthe safety and security of nuclear installations and to\r\nprevent the proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. Those include effective steps, in\r\ncooperation with the international community, to\r\neliminate an underground proliferation network which\r\nhad tentacles in two dozen countries. We have actively\r\ncooperated with the IAEA in that endeavour. We urge\r\nother concerned countries to do likewise.\r\nWe have wide-ranging security measures for our\r\nnuclear and strategic assets. A nuclear command and\r\ncontrol authority, responsible for Pakistan’s strategic\r\nassets, has been in place since the year 2000. Those\r\nassets are vital for our strategic deterrence posture.\r\nThere is no question of their falling into the wrong\r\nhands. An independent nuclear regulatory authority is\r\nin its fifth year of existence to ensure safe operation of\r\nnuclear plants. The authority has received the\r\nInternational Regulatory Review Team and Radiation\r\nSafety Infrastructure Appraisal international peer\r\nreview missions, and has an aggressive action plan to\r\naddress the recommendations of these missions.\r\nLast year, Pakistan’s Parliament promulgated a\r\ncomprehensive export control act, which further built\r\nupon the existing regime to deal with nuclear and\r\nbiological weapons, materials, goods, technologies,\r\nequipment and their means of delivery. Salient\r\nelements of our new law include the prohibition of\r\ndiversion of controlled goods and technologies,\r\nincluding re-export, transhipment and transit; licensing\r\nand record-keeping; export control lists; and penal\r\nprovisions of up to 14 years’ imprisonment and a fine\r\nof 5 million rupees. We are confident that there will be\r\nno proliferation of weapons of mass destruction from\r\nPakistan.\r\nMr. Sen (India), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe safety and verification aspects of the IAEA\r\nmandate remain important pillars of the Agency’s\r\nmandate. As regards the strengthening of the Agency’s\r\nsafeguards system, Pakistan stresses the need for a\r\nbalanced approach between the promotional aspects\r\nand safety- or security-related concerns in all of the\r\nAgency’s functions.\r\nWe support the call for States to fully comply\r\nwith their respective safeguards obligations. At the\r\nsame time, the Agency’s safeguards should not be used\r\nto serve partisan political objectives. Its verification\r\nregime will remain credible only if it is applied on a\r\nnon-discriminatory basis, as stipulated in the Agency’s\r\nstatute. Cooperation and greater understanding is\r\nrequired among all the States members of the Agency\r\nto advance the Agency’s mandate on the basis of\r\nimpartiality, equity and professionalism. Efforts are\r\nalso required to correct the public perception of IAEA\r\nas being just a nuclear watchdog agency. Its primary\r\nrole in the promotion of peaceful uses of nuclear\r\nscience and technology needs to be re-emphasized.\r\nWe remain convinced that the IAEA’s activities\r\nmust conform to its statutory responsibilities, its legal\r\nauthority and international law. We share the view that\r\nthe IAEA is not an investigative agency. It cannot be\r\nasked to perform tasks that are beyond the scope of its\r\nstatute or not approved by its membership. Any reform\r\nin the Agency should be non-discriminatory and\r\ninclusive, and take into account the differentiated\r\nnature of obligations of member States.\r\nWe also continue to believe that the following\r\nmeasures could help to enhance the Agency’s\r\ncontribution to socio-economic development and to\r\npromote nuclear safety and security and its verification\r\nrole: first, the preservation of its technical nature and\r\npreventing the politicization of its agenda; secondly, a\r\ngreater emphasis on the technical cooperation activities\r\nof the Agency and its contribution to the development\r\nand practical application of atomic energy for peaceful\r\nuses and technology transfers to developing countries;\r\nthirdly, the allocation of larger and more assured\r\nresources for technical cooperation activities,\r\ntechnology transfer and training facilities for the\r\ndeveloping countries; and fourthly, the greater\r\ninvolvement of the developing countries in the design\r\nand implementation of technical cooperation projects\r\n14\r\nA/60/PV.40\r\nand increased outsourcing to developing member\r\nStates for its Technical Cooperation Programme.\r\nMr. Hamidon (Malaysia): First and foremost, I\r\nhave the pleasure to convey, on behalf of my\r\ndelegation, our heartiest congratulations to the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and its\r\nDirector General, Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei, on the\r\noutstanding achievement of being awarded the 2005\r\nNobel Peace Prize. Malaysia believes that the award is\r\ntestimony to and recognition of the great efforts carried\r\nout by both the Agency and its Director General in\r\nensuring the safe and peaceful development and use of\r\nnuclear technologies. The award is also an\r\nacknowledgement of the Agency’s role in promoting\r\natomic energy towards peace, health and prosperity.\r\nMalaysia is confident that the award will contribute\r\nfurther impetus to drawing more support and\r\nstrengthening the Agency and its Director General as\r\nthey further carry out their mandate and objectives in\r\npromoting the peaceful uses of atomic energy.\r\nMalaysia continues to recognize the value of\r\nnuclear technology for the achievement of sustainable\r\ndevelopment and the process of nation-building, as\r\nwell as the role played by the Agency in that regard.\r\nWe reaffirm our support for the Agency in its mission\r\nto promote and facilitate the development of nuclear\r\ntechnology for peaceful uses, as embodied in article II\r\nof its statute. In that connection, the Technical\r\nCooperation Programme of the Agency remains a\r\ncrucial component of its mandate and activities.\r\nMalaysia is both a donor to and recipient of the\r\nProgramme and we commend the Department of\r\nTechnical Cooperation of the IAEA for its continuous\r\nefforts in discharging its statutory mandate for the\r\nbenefit of recipient member States, as well as for its\r\ncreditable achievements.\r\nMalaysia believes that the most pressing global\r\nsecurity issue facing all nations is the existence and\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. In that\r\nregard, Malaysia wishes to underline the need for the\r\nnuclear-weapon States to fully comply with all their\r\nobligations and commitments under the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and to\r\nlive up to the practical steps agreed to in 2000 on\r\nsystematic and progressive efforts to implement\r\nnuclear disarmament and, eventually, to achieve the\r\ntotal elimination of their nuclear arsenals.\r\nMalaysia also believes that the total elimination\r\nof nuclear weapons is of the highest priority and the\r\nonly absolute guarantee against the use or threat of use\r\nof nuclear weapons. Therefore, pending the\r\nachievement of the goal of the total elimination of such\r\nweapons, efforts to commence negotiations towards the\r\nconclusion of a universal, unconditional and legally\r\nbinding instrument on security assurances should be\r\npursued as a matter of priority.\r\nIn that regard, Malaysia regrets that the 2005\r\nReview Conference of the States Parties to the NPT\r\nwas unable to adopt a final consensus document on\r\nsubstantive issues. Malaysia believes that the NPT\r\nregime and its review process should be strengthened\r\nand universalized. If nuclear-weapon States parties to\r\nthe NPT do not continue to take all measures in good\r\nfaith to dismantle and irreversibly eliminate nuclear\r\nweapons, concerns will be raised, especially by non-\r\nnuclear weapon States parties, over the relevance of the\r\nNPT. Nuclear-weapon States should not assume that\r\nthe indefinite extension of the NPT in 1995 gives them\r\ncarte blanche to retain nuclear weapons indefinitely.\r\nNon-proliferation activities will not succeed without\r\ndisarmament by the nuclear-weapon States. Nuclear-\r\nweapon States parties cannot ignore the nuclear\r\narsenals of non-States parties to the NPT. Those States\r\nmust also be brought into the regime so that the NPT\r\ncan become a truly universal disarmament regime.\r\nMalaysia also believes that the strengthening of\r\nthe existing nuclear-weapon-free zones and the\r\nestablishment of new ones in all regions of the world,\r\non the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among\r\nthe States of the region concerned, constitute a positive\r\nstep towards attaining the objective of global nuclear\r\ndisarmament.\r\nFrom a broader perspective, Malaysia wishes to\r\nreiterate that it remains fully committed to the\r\nobjectives of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons\r\nand other weapons of mass destruction as a step\r\ntowards general and complete nuclear disarmament,\r\nand that it fully condemns all acts of terrorism,\r\nincluding nuclear terrorism, regardless of the\r\nmotivation of their perpetrators. It was in that spirit\r\nthat Malaysia joined other States in signing, on\r\n16 September 2005, the International Convention on\r\nthe Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. In\r\naddition, the September 2005 meeting of the IAEA\r\nBoard of Governors also authorized the IAEA Director\r\nGeneral to conclude and subsequently implement the\r\n15\r\nA/60/PV.40\r\nProtocol Additional to the Agreement between the\r\nGovernment of Malaysia and the IAEA for the\r\nApplication of Safeguards in Connection with the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\n(NPT).\r\nMalaysia strongly reaffirms article IV of the NPT,\r\nwhich provides for the basic and inalienable right of all\r\nMember States to undertake research on, produce and\r\nuse atomic energy for peaceful purposes. While fully\r\nsupporting efforts for the non-proliferation of weapons\r\nof mass destruction, Malaysia maintains the principled\r\nposition that non-proliferation and peaceful uses of\r\nnuclear technology should be addressed in a balanced\r\nand non-discriminatory manner. While guaranteeing\r\nMember States the legitimate right to peaceful uses of\r\nnuclear energy, the Agency should also continue its\r\nefforts to ensure that nuclear technology is not diverted\r\nin such a way as to further any military purpose.\r\nMalaysia, on behalf of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement (NAM), has consistently expressed to the\r\nDirector General and the secretariat of the Agency the\r\nMovement’s appreciation for their reports to the Board\r\nof Governors of the IAEA. The NAM has reiterated its\r\nfull confidence in the ability of the Director General\r\nand the Agency in discharging their duties and\r\nresponsibilities in an impartial, effective and\r\nprofessional manner. In this connection, Malaysia\r\nbelieves that the IAEA is the sole competent authority\r\nfor nuclear verification, in the framework of the\r\nAgency’s NPT safeguards system, and that all issues or\r\nproblems should be resolved within the mandate of the\r\nAgency.\r\nMalaysia once again expresses its appreciation to\r\nMr. Horacio Bazoberry Otero of Bolivia, President of\r\nthe IAEA General Conference at its forty-ninth regular\r\nsession, held in September, and to the Vice-Presidents\r\nfor their leadership in guiding the General Conference\r\nto a successful conclusion. My delegation commends\r\nMr. Richard J. K. Stratford III of the United States for\r\nthe efficient manner in which he chaired the\r\nCommittee of the Whole. Malaysia is fully confident\r\nthat the Director General and the Agency will carefully\r\nexamine all the decisions and resolutions of the\r\nGeneral Conference and make appropriate\r\nrecommendations with regard to them in due course.\r\nMalaysia once again joins other NAM member\r\nStates, as well as the Group of 77 and China, in Vienna\r\nin expressing confidence that Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei,\r\nDirector General of the IAEA, will continue to lead the\r\nAgency for another term, until 30 November 2009,\r\nwith a high degree of professionalism and impartiality\r\nand with the proper mandate from its policymaking\r\nbodies.\r\nFinally, Malaysia joins others in supporting the\r\nGeneral Assembly draft resolution under the item\r\nbefore us. Malaysia considers the text to be a\r\nprocedural one and that the provisions contained\r\ntherein should remain unaltered, since the text\r\nrepresents broad agreement reached among States\r\nmembers of the Agency in Vienna. Malaysia believes\r\nthat Member States should avoid any attempt to re-\r\nopen issues agreed upon at the forty-ninth regular\r\nsession of the IAEA General Conference in Vienna. If\r\nthe adoption of the draft resolution is agreed upon by\r\nconsensus without any change, Malaysia is prepared to\r\nadd its name to the list of sponsors.\r\nMr. Abdelmannan (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): I\r\nshould like, first of all, to say that the Sudan fully\r\nsupports and endorses the statement made by the\r\nrepresentative of Egypt on behalf of the Arab Group. I\r\nshould also like, on behalf of the delegation of the\r\nSudan, to sincerely congratulate Mr. Mohamed\r\nElBaradei on his re-election as Director General of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for a\r\nthird term, as well as on the well-deserved award of the\r\nNobel Peace Prize. We also congratulate all IAEA\r\nofficials for that award, since the honour bestowed on\r\nMr. ElBaradei is, indeed, an honour for all of them,\r\ntoo.\r\nThe Sudan expresses its appreciation of and\r\nsupport for the Director General’s report, which is\r\nbefore the Assembly. The report reflects the tireless\r\nefforts that have been made by the Agency to guarantee\r\nand safeguard the peaceful use of nuclear energy for\r\nthe well-being of humankind. It also reflects the\r\nAgency’s efforts to establish a nuclear-weapon-free\r\nworld.\r\nThe Middle East is on the edge of an abyss\r\nbecause of Israel’s monopoly on nuclear weapons and\r\nits total refusal to adhere to the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The\r\ninternational community must therefore take all\r\nnecessary measures to ensure that Israel abandons its\r\nnuclear weapons and agrees to join the Treaty\r\nimmediately.\r\n16\r\nA/60/PV.40\r\nThe use of nuclear technology for peaceful\r\npurposes is a right that is guaranteed by the NPT.\r\nGiven the economic and developmental advantages that\r\nsuch technology brings, my delegation supports the\r\nright of the Islamic Republic of Iran to benefit from it\r\nwithin the framework of the Treaty. We call upon the\r\nEuropean Union and the Islamic Republic of Iran to\r\nbase their dialogue on Iran’s nuclear programme on\r\nprinciples of credibility and transparency.\r\nMy delegation greatly respects and appreciates\r\nthe activities of the IAEA in Africa. We have seen at\r\nfirst hand the results of such activities in a number of\r\nimportant areas, such as combating malaria and chronic\r\ndiseases spread by tsetse flies, its work on groundwater\r\nin the Nile Basin and elsewhere, and the multifaceted\r\naspects of the African Regional Cooperative\r\nAgreement.\r\nMy delegation reiterates its approval of and\r\nappreciation for the report of the IAEA submitted by\r\nthe Director General. We also express our support for\r\nthe draft resolution before the Assembly.\r\nMr. Yechury (India): Let me take this\r\nopportunity to convey our heartiest congratulations to\r\nMr. Mohamed ElBaradei, Director General of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and to\r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency for the award\r\nof the Nobel Peace Prize for 2005.\r\nAs a founding member of the Agency, India\r\ncherishes the recognition by the Nobel Committee of\r\nits outstanding contribution to world peace and\r\nsecurity. We are confident that, as a distinguished son\r\nof a developing country, Mr. ElBaradei will continue to\r\nunderstand the South’s problems and its aspirations.\r\nAn essential feature of the centrality of the Agency in\r\nadvancing the peaceful use of nuclear energy is the fact\r\nthat problems that may arise in that regard have to be\r\naddressed and resolved within the Agency.\r\nWe heard during the course of the deliberations a\r\nsuggestion that some of the countries that have not\r\njoined the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons (NPT) so far should do so. I wish to reiterate\r\nthat India remains strongly committed to disarmament\r\nand non-proliferation. However, asking us to join the\r\nNPT is like tilting at windmills. We continue to regard\r\nthe NPT as a deeply flawed and discriminatory treaty.\r\nConfidence in the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency is based on its traditions of expertise,\r\nprofessional competence, objective standards and\r\nimpartial action. It is important that non-discrimination\r\nshould remain a vital consideration. The scope of\r\ninstruments should not be subject to reinterpretation\r\nwithout formally amending them. Goal posts should\r\nnot be selectively shifted beyond legal obligations. We\r\nare also not in favour of Member States using technical\r\nbodies to conduct foreign policy by other means, since\r\nthat is contrary to the charters of those bodies, just as\r\nwe are not in favour of the United Nations Security\r\nCouncil arrogating to itself legislative and judicial\r\npowers, since they were never mandated by the Charter\r\nand sometimes violate jus cogens.\r\nGlobal climate change, the sustainability of\r\nenergy resources, the need to meet ever increasing\r\nenergy needs in order to support economic\r\ndevelopment and concerns regarding escalating trends\r\nin fuel prices point towards the inevitability of nuclear\r\npower. A global nuclear renaissance is now a reality.\r\nIndia, which has one-sixth of the world’s\r\npopulation, is on a rapid economic growth path. A\r\nrecent study has revealed that we will need to augment\r\nour electricity generation nearly ten-fold in the next\r\nfour to five decades. That would constitute a\r\nsignificant fraction of global electricity generation.\r\nDeriving a large fraction of the energy from nuclear\r\npower would be of immense benefit in the context of\r\nenvironmental and sustainability concerns for India as\r\nwell as for the rest of the world. Nuclear energy is thus\r\nan important and inevitable option for India. Seeking to\r\nrealize that objective, we have, inter alia, been\r\npursuing a self-reliant indigenous nuclear power\r\nprogramme. The programme is designed to realize our\r\nlong-term energy requirements utilizing our vast\r\nthorium resources. This is of crucial importance to us,\r\nas our uranium resources are modest.\r\nWe look forward to a rapid growth in nuclear\r\npower generation capacity in India, based on full\r\ninternational civilian nuclear cooperation, as we\r\ncontinue our efforts to develop appropriate indigenous\r\ntechnologies aimed at the realization of the ultimate\r\ngoal of large-scale utilization of thorium for energy\r\nproduction — not only in the form of electricity but\r\nalso through the generation of hydrogen.\r\nIndia is a unique case. It is as a responsible\r\ncountry with advanced nuclear technologies developed\r\nin a self-reliant manner and with large-scale energy\r\nrequirements. Those requirements have ramifications\r\n17\r\nA/60/PV.40\r\nfor protecting the global climate, ensuring\r\nsustainability of energy resources and restraining the\r\nescalating spiral of fuel prices. India has an impeccable\r\nrecord in terms of non-proliferation of weapons of\r\nmass destruction and related technologies and\r\nadherence to all its international commitments. We\r\nexpect that this will, by example, contribute to finally\r\nextinguishing restrictive technology regimes. India’s\r\nwillingness to advance civilian nuclear energy\r\ncooperation with international partners is based on the\r\nprinciples of sovereign equality and non-discrimination\r\nand is consistent with our national policy of\r\nmaintaining the integrity of our three-stage nuclear\r\nenergy programme and ensuring the full autonomy of\r\nour nuclear programme.\r\nI would like to highlight some of the recent\r\ndevelopments in India. The first 540-megawatt (MWe)\r\npressurized heavy water reactor (PHWR) unit at\r\nTarapur has commenced commercial operations about\r\nseven months ahead of schedule. Unit I of Kakrapar\r\nAtomic Power Station has been operating continuously\r\nfor more than one year. That is an Indian record. We\r\nhave now embarked on the development of the fast\r\nbreeder reactor-based second stage of our programme,\r\nwith the start of construction of the 500 MWe\r\nprototype fast breeder reactor launched in October last\r\nyear.\r\nThe indigenously developed unique plutonium-\r\nrich mixed carbide fuel used in the fast breeder test\r\nreactor (FBTR) has performed extremely well, having\r\noperated past a burn-up of 148,000 megawatt day per\r\ntonne (MWd/t) without a single fuel pin failure. One of\r\nthe important achievements during the year was the\r\nclosing of the fuel cycle of the FBTR. The FBTR fuel\r\ndischarged at 100,000 MWd/t has been successfully\r\nreprocessed. This is the first time that the plutonium-\r\nrich carbide fuel has been reprocessed anywhere in the\r\nworld.\r\nConstruction of five PHWRs is progressing on\r\nschedule. Along with the two 1000 MWe light water\r\nreactors (VVERs) presently under construction at\r\nKudankulam in collaboration with the Russian\r\nFederation, they will contribute 3420 MWe additional\r\ncarbon-free electricity to the Indian grids in about three\r\nyears’ time.\r\nWe have begun developing sites for new nuclear\r\npower units and have begun work to identify additional\r\nsites for further expansion of the programme.\r\nThe design of the advanced heavy water\r\nreactor — an innovative Indian design aimed at\r\nmoving further on the thorium utilization route — is\r\nunder regulatory review. We intend to proceed further\r\nto take up its construction after the review process is\r\ncomplete. Work on the development of a compact high\r\ntemperature reactor that produces hydrogen, which\r\ncould be the most important energy carrier in the\r\nfuture, as well as the development of accelerator-driven\r\nsystems that could sustain growth with thorium\r\nsystems and enable incineration of long-lived\r\nradioactive wastes, is progressing well. The\r\ndevelopment of the laser-based uranium-233 clean-up\r\nsystem, a crucial element in the thorium utilization\r\nprogramme, has made significant progress. The steady\r\nstate superconducting tokamak (SST-1) will soon be\r\ngiven its first plasma shot. We are looking forward to\r\njoining the International Thermonuclear Energy\r\nReactor project involving nuclear fusion, as a full\r\npartner.\r\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency plays a\r\nvital role in the peaceful uses of nuclear science and\r\ntechnology in a safe and secure manner. As in the past,\r\nwe have been working in close partnership with the\r\nAgency. Our experts are involved actively in the\r\nAgency’s International Project on Innovative Nuclear\r\nReactors and Fuel Cycles (INPRO). India has\r\ncommitted itself to carrying out an INPRO joint study\r\nfor the assessment of an innovative nuclear energy\r\nsystem based on high temperature reactors for the\r\nproduction of hydrogen using the INPRO methodology.\r\nIndia continues to offer training facilities,\r\nfellowships, and scientific visits, among other things,\r\nand to provide the services of our experts to other\r\ncountries through the Agency. In the area of nuclear\r\nsafety and security, India has ratified the Convention\r\non Nuclear Safety and participated in the third review\r\nmeeting of the Contracting parties held in April, as an\r\nobserver. We also took an active part in the process to\r\namend the Convention on Physical Protection of\r\nNuclear Material.\r\nIndia, the United States and the IAEA have\r\nestablished a Regional Radiological Security\r\nPartnership programme. Within that framework, India\r\noffered to provide infrastructure and expertise on a\r\nregular basis for conducting international training\r\ncourses in India under the aegis of the IAEA on issues\r\nrelating to the security of radioactive sources and\r\nmaterials and to locating orphan radioactive sources in\r\n18\r\nA/60/PV.40\r\ncountries that are unable to deal effectively with such\r\nsources and have sought assistance from the IAEA.\r\nI wish to conclude by reiterating that the Agency\r\nis a unique multidisciplinary organization in the United\r\nNations family. Together we should ensure that it\r\ngrows from strength to strength.\r\nMr. Kryzhanivsky (Ukraine): On behalf of my\r\ndelegation, I would like to thank Mr. Mohamed\r\nElBaradei, Director General of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for his statement on\r\nthe Agency’s report for 2004 and for the information\r\nhe provided on the main developments in the activities\r\nof the IAEA in 2005. The IAEA’s annual report gives\r\nus a clear and analytical picture of the broad range of\r\nsignificant results of the Agency’s activities and its\r\nrecent achievements in the fields of nuclear\r\ntechnology, safety, verification, security and\r\nmanagement. Ukraine commends the IAEA secretariat\r\nand its Director General for their work. Allow me also\r\nto congratulate the IAEA and its Director General on\r\ntheir well-deserved receipt of the Nobel Peace Prize.\r\nUkraine fully associates itself with the statement\r\nmade by the representative of the United Kingdom on\r\nbehalf of the European Union. I will thus confine\r\nmyself to addressing those issues to which Ukraine\r\nattaches particular importance.\r\nThe existence of weapons of mass destruction\r\nrepresents one of the greatest threats to international\r\npeace and security. Nuclear non-proliferation and\r\ndisarmament cannot be considered separately and\r\nevery effort should be undertaken to pursue the\r\nreduction of the nuclear threat.\r\nIt is regrettable that the 2005 Review Conference\r\nof the States Parties to the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) failed to\r\nachieve a substantive outcome. We are convinced that\r\nthe non-proliferation Treaty should continue to play an\r\nirreplaceable role in nuclear proliferation prevention,\r\nnuclear disarmament and the peaceful use of nuclear\r\nenergy. For Ukraine, the practical steps for nuclear\r\ndisarmament that were agreed upon at the 2000 NPT\r\nReview Conference remain important. Recent\r\ndevelopments in the field of nuclear non-proliferation\r\nemphasize the need to strengthen the NPT regime in\r\norder to maintain the authority and integrity of the\r\nTreaty.\r\nThe International Conference on Nuclear\r\nSecurity, held recently in London, noted that nuclear\r\nterrorism is one of the greatest threats to society and\r\nrecognized that the IAEA has a leading role to play in\r\nthe global efforts to improve the nuclear security\r\nframework and to promote its implementation. Ukraine\r\nunderscores the significance of the safeguards system\r\nand of the importance of the work of the Agency in the\r\nimplementation of the NPT safeguards provisions with\r\na view to preventing the diversion of nuclear energy\r\nfrom peaceful uses to military purposes, detecting\r\ncovert weapons activities and reducing the risk of\r\nnuclear and radiological terrorism. Recent\r\ndevelopments have clearly demonstrated the necessity\r\nto make concerted efforts for the further enforcement\r\nof compliance with safeguards and addressing new\r\nproliferation risks and challenges. We therefore\r\nwelcome the IAEA Board of Governors’ decision to\r\nestablish a Committee on Safeguards and Verification\r\nand state our readiness to actively contribute to its\r\nactivities.\r\nUkraine fully endorses measures envisaged under\r\nthe Additional Protocol. The preparatory activities for\r\nthe ratification by Ukraine of the Protocol are under\r\nway. We expect the Parliament of Ukraine to ratify the\r\nProtocol later this year.\r\nUkraine reiterates its support for Security Council\r\nresolution 1540 (2004) against the proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction, which instructs all\r\nMember States to enact effective domestic controls to\r\nprevent such proliferation. Recently, at the United\r\nNations world summit, Ukraine signed the\r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of Acts\r\nof Nuclear Terrorism. Ukrainian authorities have also\r\nstarted the process of ratification of the amendments to\r\nthe Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear\r\nMaterial.\r\nAs regards unresolved compliance matters,\r\nUkraine is pleased to note that the most recent six-\r\nparty talks, aimed at finding a solution to the nuclear\r\nissue on the Korean peninsula, resulted in a joint\r\nstatement. We are confident that a successfully\r\nnegotiated settlement of that long-standing issue,\r\nmaintaining the essential verification role of the IAEA,\r\nwould be a significant accomplishment for\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nUkraine recognizes the right of Iran to make\r\npeaceful use of nuclear energy. At the same time, we\r\n19\r\nA/60/PV.40\r\nsupport the IAEA’s efforts aimed at providing credible\r\nassurances regarding the peaceful nature of Iran’s\r\nnuclear programme. In that regard, Ukraine calls upon\r\nIran to cooperate fully with the Agency and to\r\nimplement the relevant Board of Governors’\r\nresolutions.\r\nNext year will mark the twentieth anniversary of\r\nthe Chernobyl catastrophe, which had a serious\r\npolitical impact and changed attitudes to nuclear\r\nenergy all over the world. International regulations and\r\nstandards for radioactive protection, national strategies\r\nfor nuclear energy development, and safety and\r\nradioactive waste management measures have been\r\nsubstantially revised. We believe that, 20 years after\r\nthe accident, it is now important to analyse the\r\neffectiveness of measures taken, to review the work\r\naccomplished over the past decades, and to outline an\r\naction plan for future.\r\nUkraine commends the outcome of the IAEA\r\nInternational Conference, held under the rubric\r\n“Chernobyl — Looking Back to Go Forwards” in\r\nVienna on 6 and 7 September this year. The report on\r\nthe Chernobyl legacy constitutes a set of authoritative\r\ndocuments on the health, environmental and social\r\nimpacts of the tragedy, reflecting the consensus\r\nachieved among the relevant United Nations agencies\r\nand the Governments of Ukraine, Belarus and the\r\nRussian Federation. We express our gratitude to the\r\nIAEA Director General for his call for the creation of\r\nthe Chernobyl Forum and his support of its activities.\r\nIn April next year, the Government of Ukraine\r\nwill hold an international conference under the rubric\r\n“Twenty Years After the Chernobyl Accident — Future\r\nOutlook”. We highly appreciate the readiness\r\nexpressed by the Agency and relevant international\r\norganizations to contribute to the convening of that\r\nconference. Ukraine will also initiate a special\r\ncommemorative meeting of the General Assembly on\r\nthe twentieth anniversary of the Chernobyl catastrophe\r\nin April 2006. I take this opportunity to invite\r\nrepresentatives from all interested countries and\r\norganizations to take part in the conference and the\r\nGeneral Assembly meeting and to contribute to their\r\nwork.\r\nMr. Owoseni (Nigeria): On behalf of the\r\nNigerian delegation, I wish to join others in extending\r\nour warm congratulations to the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA) and its Director General, Mr.\r\nMohamed ElBaradei, on their well-deserved award of\r\nthe 2005 Nobel Peace Prize, announced earlier this\r\nmonth. The joint award is a tribute both to the\r\nAgency’s credibility and accomplishments in the areas\r\nof non-proliferation and the peaceful use of nuclear\r\ntechnology, and to the integrity, versatility and\r\nleadership qualities of Mr. ElBaradei at the head of the\r\nAgency over the past eight years, since 1997.\r\nBy the same token, in our capacity as Chair of the\r\nAfrican Union, Nigeria also wishes to congratulate\r\nMr. ElBaradei, an illustrious son of Africa, on his\r\nrecent re-election by the IAEA Board to a third term in\r\noffice and his endorsement by the General Conference.\r\nNigeria believes that both his unanimous re-election to\r\na third term and the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize\r\nnot only demonstrate the confidence of the\r\ninternational community in Mr. ElBaradei’s ability and\r\neffectiveness, but could also reinvigorate his\r\ncommitment and dedication to the ideals of the IAEA,\r\nas well as the aspirations of Member States for\r\nobjectivity and clear-sightedness in the discharge of his\r\nduties to the global community.\r\nMy delegation is pleased to take note of the\r\nannual report of the IAEA for 2004, and the statement\r\nby the Director General this morning to the General\r\nAssembly concerning the major developments in the\r\nAgency’s activities during 2005. The Director General\r\nand his staff deserve our commendation for their\r\nexcellent service.\r\nThe Government of the Federal Republic of\r\nNigeria remains committed to the three main pillars of\r\nthe Agency’s mandate and activities — namely,\r\ncooperation for peaceful nuclear technology,\r\nsafeguards and verification. We cannot but agree with\r\nthe United Nations Secretary-General’s message to the\r\n49th General Conference of the IAEA in September\r\n2005, which stated that the Agency plays a vital role in\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security and\r\nthe promotion of development.\r\nThe international community recognizes and\r\nrelies on the global independence, technical\r\ncompetence and impartial verification capacity of\r\nglobal non-proliferation efforts. It looks to the IAEA to\r\npromote safe and peaceful uses of nuclear science and\r\ntechnology, which are important tools for social and\r\neconomic development. We applaud the Agency’s\r\ncontinued fulfilment of this role as a catalyst for\r\ndevelopment of nuclear technology by the developing\r\n20\r\nA/60/PV.40\r\ncountries and as an agent for maintaining the safe use\r\nof nuclear energy.\r\nAs a developing country, Nigeria attaches great\r\nimportance to the Agency’s scientific and technical\r\nwork in the transfer of peaceful nuclear technology\r\napplications, particularly in the areas of energy, health,\r\nagriculture, water management and environmental\r\npreservation.\r\nIn the area of nuclear power, the Nigerian\r\nGovernment keenly looks to the IAEA for active\r\ncollaboration in the years ahead to achieve energy for\r\nour development. As a country of over 120 million\r\npeople, but with a per capita electricity consumption of\r\nonly about 70 kilowatt-hours per year — in sharp\r\ncontrast to the Organization for Economic Cooperation\r\nand Development average of 8,000 kilowatt-hours per\r\nyear — Nigeria’s energy requirements clearly point to\r\na radical shift in favour of nuclear power. Such a shift\r\nwould serve to alleviate the serious energy shortage\r\ncurrently impeding our development and assist the\r\nGovernment’s efforts to achieve the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals to eradicate poverty and hunger.\r\nMr. ElBaradei’s visit to Nigeria in January 2005\r\nclearly brought these problems and challenges into\r\nsharper focus and heightened the attention of the\r\ninternational community concerning the pressing need\r\nfor defining a new agenda for extending IAEA’s\r\ncooperation to Nigeria in the generation of electricity,\r\nbased on nuclear technology. To that end, my\r\nGovernment has established appropriate nuclear legal\r\nand regulatory frameworks, as well as safety, security,\r\nsafeguards and physical protection measures, in global\r\ntransparency. They are being incorporated under the\r\nAgency’s technical cooperation projects scheduled for\r\nNigeria’s Country Programme Framework for 2006 to\r\n2011.\r\nWhat applies to Nigeria’s quest for reliable\r\nnuclear power generation also applies to other areas of\r\nnuclear technology and applications. Access to life-\r\nsaving radiotherapy for cancer treatment, research and\r\ndevelopment to enhance food yields and agricultural\r\nproduction, nuclear technology for safe drinking water\r\nand seawater desalination, use of the sterile insect\r\ntechnique (SIT) to eliminate tsetse flies, and nuclear\r\ntechniques to create a safer environment are all areas\r\nof application that are germane to the socio-economic\r\ndevelopment of the developing countries with teeming\r\nbut needy populations, including Nigeria. That is why\r\nwe fully endorse the Agency’s approach to develop\r\nsupport for domestic institutions, to develop national\r\nand regional infrastructures and to build human\r\ncapabilities in those areas.\r\nThe African continent has benefited from the\r\nAgency’s capacity-building in applying SIT for the\r\neradication of tsetse flies and other pests. The\r\nAgency’s support through the African Union’s Pan-\r\nAfrican Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication\r\nCampaign is happily yielding results, and Africa has\r\nbegun to take effective ownership of the programme.\r\nWe call for sustained IAEA cooperation in those\r\nimportant areas.\r\nNigeria is also grateful to the IAEA for the\r\ntechnical assistance being rendered to Nigerian experts\r\nunder various training schemes, including scientific\r\nvisits to the Agency’s Marine Environment Laboratory\r\nin Monaco — which I myself had the opportunity to\r\nvisit recently — as well as to the laboratories in\r\nSeibersdorf, near Vienna. We urge the Agency to\r\ncontinue and intensify its efforts to make peaceful\r\nnuclear technology and its applications available to the\r\ndeveloping countries, without discrimination, as part of\r\ntheir inalienable rights under the Non-Proliferation\r\nTreaty (NPT).\r\nAt this juncture, the Nigerian delegation would\r\nlike to make three pertinent observations on other areas\r\nbearing on the Agency’s work. The first is the issue of\r\nnon-proliferation vis-à-vis the disappointing failure of\r\nthe 2005 NPT Review Conference in May this year.\r\nThe Nigerian delegation considers nuclear non-\r\nproliferation and disarmament as two sides of the same\r\ncoin that must be pursued with equal vigour in order to\r\nfacilitate the IAEA’s safeguards regime and the\r\nAgency’s role as watchdog in the development of\r\nnuclear technology for peaceful purposes.\r\nMy delegation believes that the vertical and\r\nhorizontal proliferation of nuclear weapons, the\r\nqualitative sophistication of nuclear arsenals, the\r\ndevelopment of a new generation of nuclear weapons,\r\nthe glorification of the possession of such weapons, as\r\nwell as the development of doctrines for their use in\r\nwarfare, cannot all be compatible with nuclear non-\r\nproliferation, nor, ultimately, with the work of the\r\nAgency itself nor with the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security, which must be achieved for all\r\ncountries, large and small. We believe that as long as\r\nnuclear weapons exist and are stockpiled by some\r\n21\r\nA/60/PV.40\r\nnations for their narrow security interests, exhortations\r\nabout non-proliferation will continue to ring hollow.\r\nSecondly, the Nigerian delegation is disturbed by\r\nthe recent report by the IAEA’s Illicit Trafficking\r\nDatabase that nuclear trafficking incidents are on the\r\nincrease globally. About 121 incidents were reported to\r\nthe Agency in 2004, some of which involved weapons-\r\nusable highly enriched uranium or plutonium being\r\nsmuggled across national borders. As part of the group\r\nof developing countries with porous borders, Nigeria is\r\nconcerned that radioactive materials not fall into the\r\nhands of terrorists or other criminals for malicious\r\npurposes that could cause harm to human health,\r\nendanger population centres or produce severe\r\nenvironmental or economic consequences, as the\r\nAgency’s report warns. We therefore call upon the\r\nIAEA and the international community to rise to the\r\nchallenge to effectively control and secure nuclear\r\nmaterial and nuclear facilities globally, and to offer\r\ntechnical training to the developing countries to detect\r\nand interdict radioactive sources at their borders.\r\nThirdly, my delegation attaches utmost\r\nimportance to the issue of staffing at the Agency, in\r\nparticular the need to recruit staff with a wide\r\ngeographical distribution and to increase the number of\r\nstaff from the developing countries, and to ensure fair\r\ngender representation in the Agency’s professional\r\ncadres. A careful look at the present staff disposition of\r\nthe IAEA still shows unfair and disproportionately low\r\nrepresentation from developing countries, Africa being\r\non the lowest rung of the ladder. Also, the IAEA has\r\nthe lowest number of women professional staff of the\r\nentire United Nations system, with women\r\nprofessionals from Africa, again, at the bottom of the\r\nlist.\r\nNigeria therefore calls upon the IAEA to move\r\nexpeditiously to rectify this gross anomaly by making a\r\ndeliberate effort to seek out applicants for scientific\r\nand engineering positions from the developing\r\ncountries, as well as encouraging women to apply for\r\nreserved positions, including the administrative cadres\r\nat the Agency’s headquarters. These measures, if\r\nimplemented, would expand the vistas of opportunity\r\nto the developing countries in the development of their\r\nhuman resources in nuclear technology through the\r\nacquisition of appropriate expertise, and would give\r\nequitable representation to unrepresented and\r\nunderrepresented member States of the IAEA, most of\r\nwhich belong to developing countries in Africa and\r\nelsewhere.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation reaffirms its full\r\nsupport for the indispensable role of the Agency in\r\nfacilitating the development and practical application\r\nof atomic energy for peaceful purposes, in technology\r\ntransfer to the developing countries and in nuclear\r\nsafety, verification and security. We therefore call for\r\ncontinued international cooperation with the Agency in\r\norder to carry out its core mandate and related\r\nactivities. Because of the tangible benefits of peaceful\r\nnuclear technology to human society, we must all strive\r\nto contribute to and strengthen the Agency in the\r\ncrucial role it plays in global security and\r\ndevelopment. Hence, my delegation has decided to co-\r\nsponsor the draft resolution on the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency (A/60/L.13) introduced by\r\nJapan.\r\nMr. Hu Xiadi (China) (spoke in Chinese): First,\r\nthe Chinese delegation would like to thank\r\nMr. ElBaradei, Director General of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for his detailed report\r\non the work of the Agency during the past year. We\r\nnote that, with the concerted efforts of the secretariat\r\nand all member States, the Agency undertook a\r\nconsiderable amount of work in the past year and\r\nscored remarkable achievements.\r\nWe would like to take this opportunity to\r\ncongratulate the Agency and its Director General on\r\nbeing awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 2005. We\r\nhope that, with the support of all member States, the\r\nAgency will play an even more positive role in\r\npromoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and\r\npreventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons.\r\nOver the past year, China, in furtherance of its\r\ncommitment to promote the peaceful uses of nuclear\r\nenergy and prevent the proliferation of nuclear\r\nweapons — two objectives enshrined in the statute of\r\nthe Agency — took an active part in various activities\r\nof the Agency. In the field of the peaceful uses of\r\nnuclear energy, Chinese has cooperated extensively\r\nwith the Agency and other Member States with fruitful\r\nresults. In September 2004, in addition to timely\r\npayment of its assessed technical cooperation\r\ncontributions, China made a voluntary donation of\r\n$1 million in support of the Agency’s technical\r\ncooperation activities in Asia and Africa.\r\n22\r\nA/60/PV.40\r\nIn October 2004, China, together with the\r\nAgency, hosted in Beijing an international conference\r\non nuclear facility safety, which addressed approaches\r\nto enhancing the safety of nuclear facilities in the light\r\nof the latest developments.\r\nOn 7 April 2005, China and Bangladesh signed\r\nan agreement on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.\r\nThe 13th International Conference on Nuclear\r\nEngineering was held in Beijing from 16 to 20 May\r\n2005. Furthermore, France and China signed the Fourth\r\nMinute of the Meeting of the China-France guidance\r\nand coordination committees on nuclear energy in\r\nBeijing on 19 May 2005.\r\nIn the field of nuclear non-proliferation, China\r\nstrongly supports the Agency in its efforts to enhance\r\nthe effectiveness and efficiency of its safeguards\r\nregime. In June 2004, China joined the Nuclear\r\nSuppliers Group. China welcomes the adoption by\r\nconsensus of the relevant amendments at the\r\nConference to Consider and Adopt Proposed\r\nAmendments to the Convention on the Physical\r\nProtection of Nuclear Material, from 4 to 8 July. China\r\nis committed to ratifying the amendments to the\r\nConvention as soon as possible.\r\nFollowing China’s publication in 2003 of its\r\nwhite paper on non-proliferation policy and measures,\r\nChina issued a new white paper, entitled “China’s\r\nendeavours for arms control, disarmament and non-\r\nproliferation” on 1 September 2005, giving a\r\ncomprehensive description of China’s policies,\r\npositions and actions in the fields of arms control,\r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation. That is a clear\r\ndemonstration of China’s resolve and sincerity\r\nreagarding non-proliferation.\r\nI would like to take the opportunity to briefly\r\nintroduce China’s positions concerning the nuclear\r\nissue of the Korean peninsula, as well as the Iranian\r\nnuclear issue. At the fourth round of the six-party talks\r\nconcluded on 19 September, China, the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea, Japan, the Republic of\r\nKorea, the Russian Federation and the United States\r\nengaged in serious and practical discussions\r\nconcerning the denuclearization of the Korean\r\npeninsula. Agreement was reached on the over-arching\r\ngoal of the six-party talks and a joint statement was\r\nissued. The positive result achieved in that round\r\nembodied the political will of the leaders and\r\nGovernments of the six countries to resolve the nuclear\r\nissue through dialogue. That result is also the product\r\nof over two years of intensive negotiations and\r\nunremitting efforts. That achievement was not easily\r\narrived at and must be treasured.\r\nAt present, the parties concerned have reached\r\nagreement on the ultimate goal and basic principles of\r\nthe six-party talks, laying down a good foundation for\r\npushing the talks forward. However, the nuclear issue\r\non the Korean peninsula is complicated. A thorough\r\nsolution will involve a difficult process. There is still a\r\nlong way to go for the six-party talks and many\r\ndifficulties still lie ahead.\r\nChina will, as always, firmly support a peaceful\r\nresolution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula\r\nthrough dialogue. It will promote the six-party talks\r\nand will continue to play its proper role. We will\r\ncontinue working together with all parties concerned,\r\nas well as the international community at large, for the\r\nultimate realization of the denuclearization of the\r\nKorean peninsula and the maintenance of peace and\r\nstability on the peninsula and in north-east Asia.\r\nConcerning the Iranian nuclear issue, China has\r\ncontinued to advocate an early and appropriate solution\r\nwithin the framework of the Agency and has supported\r\nthe pursuit by the European Union (EU) and Iran of a\r\nlong-term solution through dialogue and negotiation.\r\nWe believe such an approach will be conducive to\r\npreserving the international nuclear non-proliferation\r\nregime, and peace and stability in the region.\r\nDevelopments since the Board of Governors of\r\nthe Agency adopted the resolution concerning Iran in\r\nSeptember have caused greater concern. Nevertheless,\r\nthere is still room for the issue to be resolved within\r\nthe framework of the Agency. The international\r\ncommunity should not give up on efforts in that regard.\r\nIt is imperative that the EU and Iran resume\r\nnegotiations as soon as possible. We hope that both\r\nsides will remain patient, demonstrate flexibility and\r\ntake initiatives to create conditions for the resumption\r\nof negotiations. China will continue to make use of all\r\navailable opportunities to promote such negotiations\r\nactively and will continue to play a constructive role\r\ntowards the ultimate and appropriate resolution of the\r\nIranian nuclear issue.\r\nMr. Chowdhury (Bangladesh): Mr. President, as\r\nyour friend and colleague it is a pleasure for me to see\r\nyou in the Chair.\r\n23\r\nA/60/PV.40\r\nI wish to take this opportunity to applaud the\r\nDirector General of the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency (IAEA), Mr. ElBaradei, for his relentless\r\nefforts to conduct the business of the Agency in\r\naccordance with its statute. The awarding of the 2005\r\nNobel Peace Prize is indeed a fitting recognition of his\r\nand his Agency’s work. We also view it as a\r\nvindication of his stance to maintain the independence,\r\nobjectivity and impartiality of the work of the Agency.\r\nWe also thank him for his erudite presentation earlier\r\ntoday.\r\nBangladesh is convinced that the peaceful uses of\r\nnuclear technology, with the IAEA safeguards and\r\nverification regimes in place, would immensely\r\ncontribute to our common endeavour to achieve\r\nsustainable development. In addition to electricity\r\ngeneration, nuclear technology may help tackle some\r\nold as well as contemporary development challenges\r\nthat we confront. Those are related to hunger, disease,\r\nnatural resource management, environmental pollution\r\nand climate change.\r\nIt is a matter of satisfaction that the Agency has\r\nbeen playing an ever-increasing role in the application\r\nof nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. It has\r\ndone so while maintaining strict standards for safety.\r\nWe believe that nuclear energy, when produced in\r\naccordance with safety and environmental procedures,\r\ncan be a useful way of meeting the increasing energy\r\ndemand worldwide. The initial installation cost of a\r\nnuclear power plant may be high; its operating costs,\r\nhowever, are relatively low and stable. That renders it\r\nan attractive option. It is heartening to know that the\r\nIAEA is extending technical assistance to developing\r\ncountries in that regard, including by training local\r\nexperts.\r\nBangladesh welcomes the Agency’s Programme\r\nof Action for Cancer Therapy (PACT). The enhanced\r\nand effective use of nuclear medicine in cancer\r\nmanagement, we hope, would bring benefits to\r\nmillions; that is particularly true of the developing\r\nworld, for instance, through the early diagnosis and\r\ntreatment of cancer. The training of professionals in\r\nmember States would be critical for the success of\r\nPACT.\r\nWater resources management is a priority issue\r\nfor all of us. 2003 was designated the International\r\nYear of Freshwater. Now we have declared 2005-2015\r\nthe International Decade for Action, “Water for Life”,\r\nto highlight the critical linkage between water and\r\nhuman development at all levels. The IAEA, we\r\nbelieve, can play a significant role in that regard by\r\npromoting the use of isotope technology for the\r\nprotection and management of surface water and\r\ngroundwater.\r\nArticle IV of the NPT guarantees the inalienable\r\nrights of all States parties to the NPT to develop\r\nresearch, production and use of nuclear energy for\r\npeaceful purposes. Those are to be without\r\ndiscrimination and in conformity with articles I and II\r\nof the Treaty. The NPT thus obliges States parties to\r\ncooperate among themselves in the matter of exchange\r\nof equipment, materials and scientific and\r\ntechnological knowledge and information on the\r\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy, on condition that the\r\nprovisions of articles I and II are complied with by the\r\nnuclear-weapon and non-nuclear weapon States,\r\nrespectively.\r\nIt is disconcerting to note that undue restrictions\r\non exports to developing non-nuclear-weapon countries\r\nof material, equipment and technology for peaceful\r\npurposes persist through measures incompatible with\r\nthe provisions of the Treaty. Those barriers must be\r\nremoved. We wish to underscore the need for the\r\nIAEA, under its statutory obligations, to continue to\r\npursue the goals of technical cooperation in the\r\npeaceful applications of nuclear energy as one of the\r\nthree pillars of its activities.\r\nWe wish to recall that the IAEA is entrusted with\r\nputting in place necessary safeguards and verification\r\nregimes, and monitoring their compliance in\r\nconformity with the obligations of the States parties to\r\nthe NPT. We are disappointed that extraneous reasons\r\nare being employed by some nuclear-weapon States to\r\ndeny the rights of non-nuclear-weapon States to the\r\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy and technology. That\r\nhappens even in their pursuit of sustainable\r\ndevelopment. There must be no attempt to use the\r\nIAEA Technical Cooperation Programme as a tool for\r\npolitical purposes. Bangladesh calls upon all concerned\r\nto engage in constructive dialogue in order to\r\nimplement the provisions of articles I, II and IV in an\r\nenvironment of trust and confidence.\r\nBangladesh’s unflinching commitment to nuclear\r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation is well known. We\r\nare party to the NPT and the Comprehensive Nuclear-\r\nTest-Ban Treaty. We call for their universalization. We\r\n24\r\nA/60/PV.40\r\nbelieve that the greatest threat to humanity comes from\r\nthe continued existence of nuclear weapons and of their\r\npossible use or threat of use, and also that the best\r\nguarantee against nuclear weapons proliferation lies in\r\ntheir total elimination.\r\nWe are concerned at the general inertia existing\r\nin the entire disarmament machinery. The Conference\r\non Disarmament has once again failed to agree on its\r\nprogramme of work, stalling its substantive work. The\r\nDisarmament Commission, too, could not agree on an\r\nagenda for its substantive session.\r\nIt is in that perspective that the failure of the\r\n2005 Review Conference of the States Parties to the\r\nNPT was a huge disappointment to us. We believe,\r\nhowever, that our disagreements about how to proceed\r\nduring the Review Conference have not in any way\r\nweakened our achievements of 1995 and 2000. Those\r\ndecisions were adopted by consensus. We must\r\ntherefore implement what we agreed upon, particularly\r\nthe 13 practical steps for the systematic and\r\nprogressive implementation of article VI of the NPT.\r\nWe believe that those 13 practical steps continue to be\r\nthe performance benchmark for the nuclear\r\ndisarmament process. Nuclear proliferation, both\r\nvertical and horizontal, must be dealt with in a\r\ncomprehensive manner.\r\nNegative security assurances are vital to the\r\nstrengthening of the NPT. They discourage non-\r\nnuclear-weapon States from opting for nuclear\r\nweapons. That arrangement has largely been diluted in\r\nrecent years through the imposition of unrelated\r\npreconditions by the nuclear-weapon States. We call\r\nupon the nuclear-weapon States to reaffirm their\r\ncommitment to providing negative security assurances.\r\nThat would go a long way towards preventing the\r\nproliferation of nuclear weapons.\r\nIt is important for us to look forward rather than\r\nto ruminate as to how we got to the present impasse.\r\nWe need more innovative ideas, as well as the political\r\nwill to cut that Gordian knot. That is also our hope, and\r\nhope is what sustains us in adversity, stimulates our\r\nbelief in life and encourages us to forge ahead.\r\nMr. Gerus (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): At the\r\noutset, I take this opportunity to join in congratulating\r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and\r\nits Director General, Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei, on\r\nbeing awarded the 2005 Nobel Peace Prize. The\r\nAgency and its Director General can be rightfully\r\nproud of that recognition of their work in strengthening\r\npeace and security on our planet. The Republic of\r\nBelarus commends the focused and consistent efforts\r\nof Mr. ElBaradei to ensure the non-proliferation of\r\nnuclear weapons. The IAEA’s work in the development\r\nand safe use of peaceful nuclear technology, including\r\nnuclear energy, is also of extreme importance to the\r\nentire international community.\r\nThe past year has confirmed the complex\r\nsituation that has arisen with respect to the Treaty on\r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). One\r\nkey provision of the Treaty is the balance between the\r\nobligations and rights of non-nuclear-weapon States\r\nparties. Those States have voluntarily undertaken to\r\nrefrain from developing any military nuclear potential.\r\nAt the same time, the Treaty unambiguously confirms\r\nthe inalienable right of those States to research,\r\nproduce and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.\r\nIt would be difficult to overestimate the role of the\r\nAgency in ensuring that balance.\r\nThe Republic of Belarus is a staunch supporter of\r\nstrengthening the safeguards regime and strictly\r\nhonours its international obligations under the NPT and\r\nits safeguards agreement. Yet another illustration of\r\nthat support is its decision to sign the Additional\r\nProtocol on the safeguards regime.\r\nAt this stage, one of the key challenges on the\r\ninternational agenda is the fight against terrorism,\r\nincluding nuclear terrorism. We are pleased to note the\r\nactive efforts being made by the Agency in this area.\r\nBelarus is pleased at the successful conclusion of the\r\nprocess of developing and adopting an amendment to\r\nthe Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear\r\nMaterials. We believe that the entry into force of that\r\namendment, which was adopted at the Diplomatic\r\nConference in July, will make a significant\r\ncontribution towards strengthening the regime of the\r\nphysical protection of nuclear materials and nuclear\r\nfacilities. The Republic of Belarus has begun to\r\nimplement the intra-State procedures that are necessary\r\nfor the entry into force of that amendment.\r\nBelarus is engaging in successful cooperation\r\nwith the Agency in countering the illegal circulation\r\nand smuggling of nuclear and radioactive materials.\r\nGiven that, since 2004, the Republic of Belarus has\r\nshared a border with the European Union, ensuring full\r\nradiation security on the border represents a\r\n25\r\nA/60/PV.40\r\ncontribution to the efforts to ensure safe boundaries for\r\nthe member States of the European Union.\r\nIn that regard, during the forty-ninth session of\r\nthe IAEA General Conference, Belarus proposed the\r\nholding, in 2006 in Minsk under IAEA auspices, of a\r\nregional scientific- practical conference on preventing\r\nthe illegal circulation of nuclear and radioactive\r\nmaterials on the border of the Republic of Belarus with\r\nthe European Union. We look forward to support for\r\nthat initiative.\r\nA priority area of interaction of the Republic of\r\nBelarus with the Agency is cooperation to overcome\r\nthe consequences of the Chernobyl disaster. We deeply\r\nappreciate the effectiveness of the IAEA’s Chernobyl\r\ntechnical cooperation projects, aimed also at the socio-\r\neconomic rehabilitation of the affected areas.\r\nWe were pleased also to note the Agency’s\r\ncontribution to the work of the International Scientific\r\nForum on Chernobyl, whose creation was proposed by\r\nthe Director General of the IAEA during his visit to\r\nBelarus in August 2001.\r\nDuring the Forum’s final conference, held in\r\nSeptember of this year in Vienna, the international\r\ncommunity was presented with various approaches to\r\nassessing the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster\r\nand with recommendations on how to rehabilitate the\r\naffected regions.\r\nThe work of the Forum is of substantive and\r\npractical significance for the optimization of policies\r\naimed at overcoming the effects of the Chernobyl\r\ndisaster and for the sustainable development of the\r\naffected territories, as well for the development of\r\ninternational cooperation as concerns Chernobyl.\r\nThe Forum’s work represents a significant step\r\nforward in the consideration of all of the long-term\r\nconsequences of the Chernobyl disaster. The Forum’s\r\nfinal document pointed out that a number of issues,\r\nincluding the medically related consequences of\r\nChernobyl, are pending and require further in-depth\r\nstudy.\r\nThe final conference of the Chernobyl Forum has\r\nconvincingly demonstrated the need for further\r\ninternational cooperation aimed at studying and\r\novercoming the consequences of the greatest radiation\r\ncatastrophe in the history of humankind.\r\nMr. Inkiriwang (Indonesia): On behalf of the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Indonesia, I would like\r\nto begin by warmly congratulating Mr. Mohamed\r\nElBaradei on his reappointment to the post of Director\r\nGeneral of the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\n(IAEA) for a third term. Indonesia is fully confident\r\nthat under his excellent leadership, characterized by a\r\nhigh degree of diplomatic and technical professionalism,\r\nwhich has earned the respect and trust of the member\r\ncountries, he will lead the Agency to the successful\r\naccomplishment of our collective objectives and the\r\ntasks of the Agency. Let me assure the Assembly of my\r\nGovernment’s full support and cooperation in carrying\r\nout the mandate entrusted to this important body.\r\nIn that connection, having been elected this year\r\nto serve as a member of the Board of Governors of the\r\nIAEA for the period 2005-2007, Indonesia looks\r\nforward to working closely with Mr. Mohamed\r\nElBaradei.\r\nConcerning the agenda item before this plenary, I\r\nwould like also to express our appreciation to the\r\nDirector General for the annual report of the IAEA on\r\nthe activities of the Agency over the past year in\r\nvarious areas as well as for the statement he made\r\nearlier. Let me also avail myself of this opportunity to\r\nexpress our appreciation for its consistent efforts in\r\npast years in fulfilling its mandate and enlarging its\r\ncore competence by responding to nuclear and related\r\nissues.\r\nThe report of the IAEA reflects a recognition of\r\nthe significance and value of the Agency’s work, which\r\nhas an immense impact on the health and well-being of\r\npeoples worldwide as well as on world peace and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe IAEA, with its comprehensive membership\r\nof countries from nearly all parts of the world,\r\nespecially developing member States, has made its\r\nconsiderable contribution in recent years to the\r\napplication of nuclear energy for social and economic\r\ndevelopment related to health, agriculture, water\r\nmanagement and preservation of the environment. It\r\nhas undertaken activities ranging from assisting\r\ncountries to assess their groundwater resources and\r\nimprove their agricultural productivity, to re-evaluating\r\nthe seismic safety of nuclear facilities and assisting in\r\nthe upgrading of their physical protection; and from\r\nsupporting the development of national energy\r\n26\r\nA/60/PV.40\r\nstrategies to continuing efforts to ensure a more\r\neffective and efficient safeguards system.\r\nThat, indeed, deserves continued and\r\nwholehearted support on the part of all its members.\r\nWe applaud the IAEA for those and numerous other\r\nachievements.\r\nWe welcome the attention devoted by the IAEA\r\nto the issue of technical assistance, which highlights\r\nthree elements that are essential for the successful\r\nimplementation of the Technical Cooperation\r\nProgramme, namely strong Government commitment,\r\nthe high quality of technical cooperation projects and\r\nadequate funding. We are encouraged by the country\r\nprogramme frameworks that are used to stimulate a\r\nstructured dialogue between the Agency and the\r\nmember States, aligning the country’s technical\r\ncooperation programme with national needs and\r\npriorities, and we support the increasing priority given\r\nto technical cooperation among developing countries,\r\nusing local expertise and facilities to enhance the\r\ncapacity of the programme. However, my delegation\r\nmust emphasize that this should be unrelated to the\r\ndonor countries’ contributions to the Technical\r\nCooperation Fund, so that the funding can be assured,\r\nsufficient and predictable, so as to implement the\r\nprogramme as planned for the benefit of all recipient\r\nStates.\r\nPursuant to the Technical Cooperation report for\r\n2004, my delegation notes with satisfaction that\r\ncommitments by, and support from, member States\r\nwere clearly marked by an increase in the Technical\r\nCooperation Fund from $62.6 million in 2003 to $75.6\r\nmillion in 2004. However, during the same period,\r\nextra-budgetary resources dropped by almost $1\r\nmillion, and in-kind contributions also fell by around\r\n$0.4 million. Although the total amount of new\r\nresources for the technical cooperation programme\r\nincreased, the Agency should make every effort to\r\navoid further decreases in both extrabudgetary\r\nresources and in-kind contributions in coming years.\r\nWith regard to managing technical cooperation\r\nfor development, we welcome the restructuring of the\r\nAgency’s Department of Technical Cooperation into\r\nfour new geographical regions, which will lead to the\r\nregrouping not only of staff responsibilities and tasks,\r\nbut also of countries in a particular region. In that\r\nconnection, my delegation hopes that the Agency will\r\nbe able to arrange future briefings on developments\r\nduring every phase of the restructuring process.\r\nIndonesia believes it is important to increase the\r\nrepresentation of developing countries among Agency\r\nstaff members. We are happy to note the Agency’s\r\nincreasing attention to that issue, which is shown by its\r\nstressing the importance of recruiting staff who reflect\r\nthe widest possible geographical distribution, including\r\nan increasing number of staff from developing\r\ncountries. As indicated by the Director General’s\r\nstatement at the forty-ninth General Conference of the\r\nAgency, there has been an increase in the number of\r\nmember States — from 77 to 98 — represented among\r\nthe professional staff, and the percentage of staff from\r\ndeveloping countries has continued to grow. However,\r\nwe share the concern that there has not been a\r\nsufficient and corresponding increase in the number of\r\nwell-qualified female applicants. It is our common\r\nresponsibility to address that unacceptable reality\r\nthrough initiatives that can lead to a substantial\r\nincrease in their number in the Agency.\r\nIndonesia, together with other developing\r\ncountries, attaches the greatest importance to the\r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals\r\n(MDGs). We are, therefore, gratified to note, as pointed\r\nout in the annual report, that the Agency is assisting\r\nmember States in their efforts to achieve the MDG\r\ntarget of halving the number of people who suffer from\r\nhunger by 2015, by providing technical support to\r\ndevelop and evaluate strategies to combat hunger and\r\nmalnutrition. Indonesia recognizes the importance of\r\nstrategies to combat malnutrition. However, limited\r\nfinancial resources and technologies have been the\r\nmajor constraints faced by developing countries, and\r\nwe must address that problem as a matter of urgency.\r\nMoreover, we commend the Agency’s active\r\nparticipation in the promotion of sustainable\r\ndevelopment — which is one objective of the\r\nMDGs — through the coordination of the inter-agency\r\npublication Energy Indicators for Sustainable\r\nDevelopment: Guidelines and Methodologies.\r\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency has the\r\nability to effectively face several challenges related to\r\nthe issues of verification and the safeguards system.\r\nWe appreciate the Agency’s extensive efforts to\r\nstrengthen the verification system and welcome the\r\npositive developments with respect to the status of\r\nsafeguards agreements and additional protocols, which\r\nhave steadily increased. As indicated in the Director\r\n27\r\nA/60/PV.40\r\nGeneral’s report covering the past year, NPT\r\nsafeguards agreements for five more States and\r\nadditional protocols for nine more States have entered\r\ninto force. Thus, there are now a total of 71 States with\r\nadditional protocols either in force or provisionally\r\napplied.\r\nConcerning the application of IAEA safeguards\r\nand nuclear verification, my delegation has repeatedly\r\npointed out that the additional protocols are the\r\ncentrepiece of the Agency’s response by strengthening\r\nthe effectiveness and improvement of the safeguards\r\nsystem as a contribution to global non-proliferation\r\nobjectives. They are especially needed because they\r\ncan provide credible assurances regarding the non-\r\ndiversion of nuclear materials and the absence of\r\nundeclared nuclear materials and activities.\r\nTo facilitate those measures, there have been,\r\nover the past year, some initiatives aimed at\r\nstrengthening the integrity of the IAEA safeguards\r\nregime. In that regard, we recall the creation of the\r\nCommittee on Safeguards and Verification aimed at\r\nstrengthening the safeguards system. While certain\r\nsituations may demand a strong, effective and\r\nadaptable safeguards regime, we believe that the\r\nCommittee should play a measured role, supplementing\r\nthe work of the Agency. In other words, the work of\r\nthe new Committee should not duplicate that of the\r\nAgency. Indonesia looks forward to having a clearer\r\npicture of Committee’s mandate and to participating in\r\nthe discussions on its functioning. We encourage the\r\nAgency to continue its leadership as the sole competent\r\nnuclear verification authority within the framework of\r\nthe Agency’s safeguards system. We believe that it is\r\nimportant that the Agency preserve the integrity,\r\nprofessionalism and impartiality that have long\r\ncharacterized its work.\r\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency plays a\r\nconstructive role in working towards a comprehensive\r\nsettlement that will provide assurances to the\r\ninternational community that all nuclear activities are\r\nbeing carried out for exclusively peaceful purposes. It\r\nis encouraging to note the developments thus far with\r\nregard to the nuclear issue in the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea. In that regard, we welcome the\r\nprogress made through the Six-Party Talks and the\r\ncommitment undertaken by the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea to abandon all nuclear weapons and\r\nexisting nuclear programmes and to observe the Treaty\r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the\r\nIAEA safeguards.\r\nIndonesia, in line with the position of the Vienna\r\nChapter of the Non-Aligned Movement, believes that\r\nall issues related to safeguards and verification should\r\nbe resolved within the framework of the Agency, on\r\nthe basis of technical considerations and, most\r\nimportantly, through constructive dialogue, negotiation\r\nand peaceful means. In that regard, we reaffirm the\r\nimportance of the basic and inalienable rights of all\r\nmember States to develop atomic energy for civilian\r\nand peaceful purposes. The IAEA and its member\r\nStates — especially the parties involved — should\r\nrecognize that substantive progress has been made in\r\nresolving the issues outstanding in the area of\r\nsafeguards implementation.\r\nAs stated earlier, we commend the technical\r\ncooperation programme of the Agency, because it has\r\nbeen playing a valuable role in development activities\r\ninvolving nuclear technology. Indonesia remains a\r\nstrong supporter of the Agency’s technical cooperation\r\nactivities and has consistently pledged and paid its\r\ncontributions to the Technical Cooperation Fund. We\r\ntherefore attach great importance to the Agency’s\r\ntechnical cooperation programme. As in the past, we\r\nhave pledged our contribution to the Technical\r\nCooperation Fund for 2006.\r\nI wish to express our high appreciation to the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency for providing\r\nIndonesia with continuous support, including the three\r\nrecent technical cooperation projects relating to\r\npreparations for the construction of a nuclear power\r\nplant that have been initiated by several responsible\r\ninstitutions in Indonesia. In anticipation of the new\r\nplant, our national regulatory body, the Nuclear Energy\r\nRegulatory Agency of Indonesia (BAPETEN), has\r\nembarked upon a comprehensive programme to\r\ndevelop the entire necessary infrastructure, including\r\nthe training of the required personnel, particularly in\r\nactivities related to the licensing and inspection of the\r\nplant. We therefore continue to expect cooperation and\r\nassistance from the Agency, particularly in building the\r\ncapacity of the regulatory authority. In that regard,\r\nintensive bilateral and multilateral cooperation with\r\ncountries having greater experience in the development\r\nand operation of nuclear power plants has become a\r\nnecessity.\r\n28\r\nA/60/PV.40\r\nThe 2005 Nobel Peace Prize, recently awarded to\r\nthe Agency and to its Director General, should come as\r\nno surprise, because they fully deserved it. Therefore,\r\nwe wish to take this opportunity once again, on behalf\r\nof the Government of the Republic of Indonesia, to\r\nwholeheartedly congratulate the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency and its Director General, Mr. Mohamed\r\nElBaradei, on being awarded the prestigious Nobel\r\nPeace Prize for 2005. That award undoubtedly\r\nunderscores the excellent contribution of the Agency\r\nand Mr. ElBaradei to world peace through their efforts\r\nin preventing the use of nuclear energy for military\r\npurposes and in ensuring its use and technology for\r\npeaceful purposes in the safest way.\r\nIt is our view that the work of the Agency and its\r\nDirector General serves as an excellent example of the\r\nhighest principles the United Nations stands for, and\r\nthe awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize will serve as an\r\ninspiration to many people around the globe. It is\r\nindeed a major and worthy recognition of the Agency\r\nand its Director General’s achievements and important\r\ncontribution to the world and to global peace.\r\nIn conclusion, when we look ahead, it is\r\nworthwhile to remind ourselves, on the occasion of this\r\nsixtieth anniversary of the United Nations, that the\r\nIAEA’s role is crucial in addressing the new challenges\r\nthat the United Nations is confronted with. In the\r\nmultilateral context, the United Nations in general and\r\nthe IAEA in particular are in a unique position to find\r\nnew paths that could provide the impetus for\r\ninternational actions to significantly contribute to\r\nworld peace and development.\r\nFor our part, let me reaffirm Indonesia’s strong\r\nsupport for the Agency and the United Nations in\r\ncarrying out their respective mandates to promote the\r\nuse of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, and at the\r\nsame time I would like to reiterate Indonesia’s serious\r\ncommitment to nuclear disarmament and non-\r\nproliferation and to supporting the inalienable rights of\r\nall States to nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.\r\nFinally, my delegation would like to join in the\r\nconsensus adoption of the draft resolution on the\r\nIAEA, contained in document A/60/L.13.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.35 p.m.\r\n"
