(Sweden)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 2.40 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 84 (continued)\r\nReport of the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/60/204)\r\nDraft resolution (A/60/L.13)\r\nMr. Ng (Singapore): My delegation would like to\r\ncongratulate the Director General of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Mr. Mohamed\r\nElBaradei, and the IAEA itself on being jointly\r\nawarded this year’s Nobel Peace Prize. This award is\r\nboth well deserved and timely. It reflects the important\r\nrole the IAEA plays in nuclear non-proliferation.\r\nWith the increasing challenges posed by nuclear\r\nproliferation, coupled with the rise of nuclear power as\r\nan energy source, strict conformity to the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and to\r\nthe Agency’s safeguards obligations are crucial. As a\r\nmember of the IAEA Board of Governors, Singapore\r\nwill continue to lend its full support to the Agency and\r\nits work.\r\nOver the past few years, the NPT has faced\r\nserious challenges. This fact has emphasized the need\r\nfor the Treaty to be underpinned by a strong safeguards\r\nregime. There is now significant potential for nuclear\r\nproliferation, given the discovery of a sophisticated\r\nand clandestine nuclear procurement network, the\r\nspread of nuclear knowledge, access to sensitive\r\ntechnology and the complications that can arise from\r\nthe peaceful use of nuclear energy. While the IAEA\r\nprotects the right to use nuclear energy for peaceful\r\npurposes, it must also ensure that such a right is\r\nexercised in compliance with States’ non-proliferation\r\nobligations under article II of the NPT and the full\r\nimplementation of IAEA safeguards, and with the\r\nutmost transparency.\r\nThe IAEA has a central role in combating nuclear\r\nproliferation. It is therefore vital that its safeguards\r\nregime remains capable of responding to new\r\nchallenges within its mandate. In this context,\r\nSingapore supports the several key initiatives taken\r\nrecently by the IAEA Board of Governors. They\r\ninclude the creation of an advisory committee of the\r\nBoard on safeguards and verification, establishing the\r\nAdditional Protocol as the new standard for safeguards\r\nverification, and ushering in a modified version of the\r\nSmall Quantities Protocol.\r\nAs a reflection of our strong commitment to non-\r\nproliferation, Singapore signed the Additional Protocol\r\non 22 September 2005. In our view, States themselves\r\nmust also enhance and continue to enhance\r\ninternational cooperation to counter nuclear\r\nproliferation. In this regard, Singapore supports the full\r\nand effective implementation of Security Council\r\nresolution 1540 (2004) which, inter alia, calls on\r\nUnited Nations Member States to enhance domestic\r\ncontrols and step up cooperation against the\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. While\r\nlegally binding multilateralism should be the basis of\r\n2\r\nA/60/PV.41\r\nthe global non-proliferation regime, other multi-\r\ncountry initiatives, such as the Proliferation Security\r\nInitiative, are important elements in international\r\ncounter-proliferation efforts.\r\nI would like next to touch upon the rise of nuclear\r\nenergy as an energy option. There is a clear trend\r\ntowards the use of nuclear power in the developing\r\nworld, particularly in Asia, as our energy needs\r\nincrease. Effective nuclear safety and security regimes\r\nmust therefore be strongly emphasized. Singapore\r\nstrongly commends and endorses the Agency’s efforts\r\nto promote adherence to IAEA safety standards and\r\nguidelines. We urge member States to make effective\r\nuse of the Agency’s safety review services and other\r\nforms of assistance to raise nuclear safety standards\r\nand uphold an effective nuclear safety culture. It is\r\nincumbent upon States to establish regulatory\r\ninfrastructures that will support credible national\r\nnuclear safety regimes.\r\nWhile ensuring nuclear safety ultimately remains\r\nthe national responsibility of States, the cross-border\r\nimplications of radiological fallout make nuclear safety\r\nvery much a transnational concern. Nuclear safety and\r\nsecurity are closely interrelated. In this regard,\r\nSingapore places a high degree of importance on\r\ncontinued measures by the IAEA to improve nuclear\r\nsecurity and protection against nuclear and radiological\r\nterrorism. We welcome the IAEA Board’s adoption in\r\nSeptember of a Nuclear Security Plan for 2006 to 2009.\r\nThe importance of transboundary emergency\r\npreparedness capability, including appropriate regional\r\ncooperation, could not be emphasized more.\r\nSingapore is also pleased to note that the\r\nAgency’s Technical Cooperation Programme has\r\nexpanded and improved its management and delivery\r\nof technical assistance projects. The needs-driven\r\napproach adopted by the Agency together with member\r\nStates targets the particular concerns identified by\r\nmember States, while optimizing the Agency’s\r\nfinancial resources.\r\nSingapore firmly supports the Agency’s technical\r\ncooperation activities. In recognition of this, we have\r\nconsistently contributed our full assessed share of the\r\nIAEA’s Technical Cooperation Fund. The IAEA Board\r\nof Governors recently agreed in broad terms that the\r\nprize money awarded to the IAEA for the 2005 Nobel\r\nPeace Prize should be used to fund the needs of\r\ndeveloping countries in the peaceful application of\r\nnuclear energy. We fully support that decision.\r\nSingapore looks forward to further cooperation with\r\nthe Agency in bilateral technical cooperation\r\ninitiatives.\r\nSingapore will continue to support the work of\r\nthe Director General and the Agency in all its three\r\npillars of promoting nuclear safety and security,\r\npeaceful applications of nuclear science and\r\ntechnology, and nuclear verification and safeguards.\r\nMr. Sumaida’ie (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): At the\r\noutset, I would like to express our appreciation to the\r\nDirector General of the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency (IAEA), Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei, for his\r\npresentation of the annual report of the Agency to the\r\nGeneral Assembly. We extend our congratulations to\r\nhim and to the Agency on their earning the Nobel\r\nPeace Prize through the actions they have undertaken\r\nto spare humanity from the disasters that could be\r\ncaused by the use of weapons of mass destruction. The\r\nIAEA’s activities contribute to the establishment of\r\npeace in the world and help secure the benefits of\r\nsharing nuclear technology internationally to achieve\r\nsocio-economic development.\r\nCognizant of the important role that the Agency\r\nplays, my Government realizes that it must have the\r\nfunds necessary to support its technical programmes\r\nand activities through payment by States of their\r\nassessments to the budget. Based on this, my\r\nGovernment has requested the Secretariat to transfer\r\nIraq’s arrears to the IAEA’s fund for the period 1991 to\r\n2005 from our money that was deposited with the\r\nUnited Nations. This initiative is the result of my\r\nGovernment’s interest in creating an effective and\r\nsupportive role for the activities of the IAEA.\r\nThis is the first occasion on which my delegation\r\nhas taken the floor in the General Assembly to speak\r\non this item since the collapse of the previous Iraqi\r\nregime, whose relationship with the IAEA was often\r\ncharacterized by an absence of understanding and by\r\ntension. I can state with confidence that a new era has\r\nbegun in the relationship between my Government and\r\nthe IAEA, one based on full cooperation, transparency\r\nand respect by Iraq for the commitments that it has\r\nentered into under international conventions and\r\ntreaties relating to disarmament and non-proliferation.\r\nWe have taken a number of new measures that\r\nreflect our new attitude. We have established a\r\ncommission to control radioactive materials, which is\r\n3\r\nA/60/PV.41\r\nbased on the IAEA’s guiding principles and code of\r\nconduct. The Commission began work this year on a\r\ncomprehensive action plan to control stocks of\r\ndepleted radioactive sources, bury low-grade\r\nradioactive waste and tighten border controls in\r\nconjunction with competent Iraqi authorities. An\r\ninstitution dedicated to banning the spread of weapons\r\nhas been established, as has, in the Ministry of the\r\nEnvironment, a centre for radiation protection, which\r\nmonitors the movement and use of radioactive sources,\r\nincluding their import, export, transfer, purchase, sale\r\nstockpiling and circulation. The national control\r\nservice, in the Ministry of Science and Technology, is\r\nimplementing a continuous monitoring, verification\r\nand inspection plan for controlling materials and\r\nequipment of dual usage.\r\nWorking with the committee on the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and\r\ndisarmament bodies, our National Security Council is\r\nimplementing Security Council resolution 1540 (2004),\r\nand we are submitting reports in that regard.\r\nWe are considering accession to these\r\ninternational conventions and treaties to which we are\r\nnot yet party. During the Conference to Facilitate the\r\nEntry into Force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\r\nBan Treaty, held in September, we expressed our\r\nintention to accede to that Convention.\r\nThe National Assembly has added to those\r\nmeasures by incorporating a number of basic principles\r\ninto the constitution, which was approved on\r\n15 October. The first paragraph states that the Iraqi\r\nGovernment respects and will abide by its international\r\ncommitments to ban the proliferation, development,\r\nproduction and use of nuclear, chemical and biological\r\nweapons. It will also ban the development, production\r\nand manufacture of any related equipment, materials,\r\ntechnology and delivery systems.\r\nDuring the past two years we have succeeded in\r\ncharting a course for the Iraq of the future by\r\nundertaking a number of projects that reject the\r\nprevious regime’s attitude towards weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, based on the IAEA’s conclusions that Iraq\r\nis free from nuclear weapons. Those conclusions have\r\nbeen supported by reports from survey teams\r\nindicating that Iraq is free from weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. We have begun consultations and\r\ncoordination with members of the Security Council to\r\nremove the sanctions imposed by the Council on the\r\nprevious regime, as set out in the report under the\r\nheading of verification in Iraq pursuant to Security\r\nCouncil resolutions.\r\nWe would like to take this opportunity to express\r\nour appreciation for the efforts of the IAEA to conduct\r\nits active annual verification of nuclear stocks in Iraq\r\nthat are subject to the comprehensive safeguards\r\nregime. An Agency delegation conducted a verification\r\nexercise in September. We also commend the efforts\r\nmade by the IAEA’s Marine Environment Laboratory\r\nconcerning the contamination resulting from ship\r\nwreckage in the Arab Gulf close to the port city of Um\r\nQasr.\r\nThe spectre of nuclear terrorism threatens\r\ninternational peace and security. We must remain\r\ncautious and make a collective effort to prevent\r\nterrorists and non-State actors from acquiring and\r\nusing nuclear weapons with a view to achieving their\r\ngoals. My Government has taken the necessary\r\nmeasures to prevent such threats, in accordance with\r\ninternational law and relevant instruments, including\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1540 (2004). In this\r\nconnection, we support the measures taken by the\r\nIAEA in fostering nuclear security and in providing\r\ntechnical support and assistance to Member States.\r\nMy Government is of the view that the nuclear-\r\nweapon States must implement their commitments\r\nunder article VI of the NPT so that complete nuclear\r\ndisarmament can be achieved.\r\nWe stress the need to establish a nuclear-weapon-\r\nfree zone in the Middle East, as well as necessary and\r\neffective machinery to ensure that Israel accedes to the\r\nNPT and places its nuclear facilities under the\r\ncomprehensive safeguards regime of the IAEA. We\r\nurge the international community to arrive at a legally\r\nbinding international instrument that includes negative\r\nand positive safeguards and protects the non-nuclear-\r\nweapon States from the threat or use of such weapons.\r\nWe also support the conclusion of a convention to\r\nban radiological weapons. We call upon the Conference\r\non Disarmament to intensify its efforts to that end.\r\nMs. Bahemuka (Kenya), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nWe will continue our efforts to support the\r\nactivities of the IAEA and to strengthen its capacity to\r\nface new challenges.\r\n4\r\nA/60/PV.41\r\nMrs. Núñez de Odremán (Bolivarian Republic\r\nof Venezuela) (spoke in Spanish): The delegation of the\r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela supports the\r\nstatement by the representative of Uruguay on behalf\r\nof MERCOSUR and associated States. We would like,\r\nhowever, to join in congratulating Mr. ElBaradei on his\r\nre-election as Director General of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA), as well as on his\r\nreceiving the Nobel Peace Prize.\r\nWe would also like to take this opportunity to\r\nunderline the position of the Bolivarian Republic of\r\nVenezuela on a specific case — the nuclear programme\r\nof Iran — and our rejection of resolution GOV/2005/64\r\nof the IAEA Board of Governors, of 11 August 2005,\r\non implementation of the NPT safeguards agreement in\r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran.\r\nAs a State party to the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), we wish to\r\nreaffirm the need for the universalization of the Treaty.\r\nAll members of the international community must\r\nstrictly comply with its norms in order to ensure a\r\nworld of peace, free of the threat of the unjustified and\r\ndestructive use of nuclear weapons. At the same time,\r\nwe defend the inalienable right of all States to develop\r\ntheir own systems to produce nuclear energy for\r\npeaceful purposes, including with respect to the\r\ncomplete nuclear fuel production and reprocessing\r\ncycle.\r\nIn that connection, we recognize that the process\r\nof applying the safeguards regime to Iran’s nuclear\r\nprogramme, carried out by IAEA in 2003, has produced\r\ntangible results, as shown in the Director General’s\r\nmost recent report to the Agency’s Board of\r\nGovernors, submitted in September 2005. Those\r\nencouraging results — obtained with the cooperation\r\nof Iran, which voluntarily permitted the application of\r\nthe Additional Protocol and the temporary suspension\r\nof its nuclear programme — demonstrate that the\r\ncorrect way to conduct a complete investigation of this\r\ncase is to address it within the framework of the IAEA,\r\nutilizing its technical capacity and the authority that\r\nenables it to carry out balanced activities without any\r\npolitical bias.\r\nWe must stress that it can be inferred from the\r\nreport that there is no evidence that the Iranian nuclear\r\nprogramme contravenes the NPT or that the obligations\r\nset out in the Treaty are not being complied with\r\nbecause of the programme. The report affirms the need\r\nto provide additional time, but in no way does it imply\r\nthat the IAEA’s authority to handle the matter has been\r\nexhausted.\r\nTherefore, Venezuela rejects the proposal to refer\r\nthe case to the Security Council, given that there is no\r\nobjective reason to justify such an action. That would\r\nonly further politicize the issue and make its timely\r\nresolution more difficult. To refer the issue to the\r\nCouncil would mean that the IAEA would give up on\r\nits mission and that would amount to its agreeing that it\r\nwas unable to handle the matter, despite the fact that it\r\nhas been doing so successfully. Such an action would\r\nbe truly contradictory — a sort of self-disqualification\r\nthat would seriously compromise the IAEA’s prestige\r\nas a reliable and balanced multilateral body. In effect,\r\nthe Agency would be submitting to pressures applied\r\nby other countries that, possessing nuclear technology,\r\nseek to reserve for themselves control over nuclear fuel\r\nand its reprocessing in order to maintain dependent\r\nrelationships, to the detriment of the sovereign right of\r\nall countries to achieve their independent development.\r\nThe Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela reiterates\r\nits position that the consideration of the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran’s nuclear development programme\r\nmust remain within the framework of the IAEA, on the\r\nbasis of the transparency measures that the\r\nGovernment of Iran has offered and can offer. This\r\nshould guarantee for the international community the\r\npeaceful nature of its nuclear programme.\r\nUndoubtedly, the relationship between the IAEA\r\nand Iran should continue to deepen with a view to\r\nclearing up all doubts or reservations that may exist. In\r\nthat regard, we wish to recall the proposal made\r\nrecently in the General Assembly by the President of\r\nIran, to the effect that public or private entities from\r\nother countries participate together with his country in\r\ndeveloping its nuclear programme through strategic\r\npartnerships. That proposal opens up new avenues\r\ntowards full transparency for the Iranian nuclear\r\nprogramme.\r\nIn conclusion, our delegation reaffirms once\r\nagain the inalienable right of States to develop nuclear\r\nenergy for peaceful purposes within the framework of\r\nthe NPT and related international norms, without\r\npolitical discrimination or discrimination of any other\r\nkind.\r\nMr. Dolgov (Russian Federation) (spoke in\r\nRussian): We are pleased to welcome Mr. Mohamed\r\n5\r\nA/60/PV.41\r\nElBaradei, Director General of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and to thank him for\r\npresenting the Agency’s annual report.\r\nRussia, as an active member of the IAEA, is\r\nsatisfied with the Agency’s highly professional work\r\nand recognizes its important and increasing role in\r\nstrengthening the international nuclear non-\r\nproliferation regime and in ensuring the level of\r\nconfidence needed for cooperation in the peaceful and\r\nsafe development of nuclear energy production. We\r\nfully share the Nobel Prize Committee’s high esteem\r\nfor the role of this international institution. The Nobel\r\nPeace Prize awarded to the IAEA and its Director\r\nGeneral is clear evidence of the global recognition of\r\nthe Agency’s achievements.\r\nThe IAEA is a unique international institution\r\nvested with powers to assess States’ compliance with\r\ntheir nuclear non-proliferation obligations within the\r\nframework of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT). We call for further\r\nimprovement of the Agency’s verification mechanisms\r\nand for further development of its monitoring\r\nfunctions.\r\nThe particular urgency of stepping up effective\r\ninternational non-proliferation efforts is dictated by the\r\nthreat that weapons of mass destruction may fall into\r\nthe hands of terrorists. The continuing brutal terrorist\r\nacts — also perpetrated in Russia — underpin the need\r\nto put in place reliable guarantees preventing the\r\naccess by terrorists to weapons of mass destruction,\r\nparticularly by strengthening joint efforts to establish a\r\nglobal system for countering new challenges and\r\nthreats, especially in the nuclear field. The United\r\nNations should, of course, play a central role in the\r\ncreation of such a system.\r\nThose new challenges underscore the importance\r\nof finding new solutions. We are grateful for the broad\r\nsupport for the Russian proposals concerning the\r\ndrafting of Security Council resolution 1540 (2004) on\r\nthe non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\r\nand the International Convention for the Suppression\r\nof Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. Russia is a participant in\r\nthe Proliferation Security Initiative and was a sponsor\r\nof the Group of Eight Action Plan on Non-\r\nProliferation. Those documents must be fully and\r\nstrictly implemented. The initiatives are largely\r\ninterrelated and should enhance the effectiveness of\r\nglobal non-proliferation regimes in the area of weapons\r\nof mass destruction.\r\nApplication of the Additional Protocol of the\r\nIAEA Safeguards Agreement is a pillar of the Agency’s\r\nactivities, serving as an innovative tool for ensuring the\r\ntransparency of national nuclear programmes. We\r\nbelieve that universalizing the Additional Protocol will\r\nbe one of the international community’s crucial non-\r\nproliferation tasks in the years to come. The Russian\r\nFederation will continue to provide assistance in the\r\nstrengthening of the IAEA safeguards system,\r\nincluding by funding a national programme of\r\nscientific and technical support for the Agency’s\r\nsafeguards initiative.\r\nRussia respects the interest of States in\r\ndeveloping peaceful nuclear technologies and has\r\ncooperated with many countries in that area for a\r\nnumber of years. We advocate the broadest possible\r\ncooperation in the area of nuclear energy for\r\ndevelopment. However, the use of the peaceful atom\r\nfor the production of nuclear weapons must be reliably\r\nand safely prevented. We promote methods of nuclear\r\npower development that would provide — as an\r\nalternative to the proliferation of sensitive\r\ntechnologies — programmes to provide a reliable\r\nsupply of nuclear fuel on the basis of international\r\ncooperation. We support multilateral frameworks for\r\npractical cooperation in that regard, particularly the\r\nwork on this issue carried out within the IAEA.\r\nWe believe that the report prepared in early 2005\r\nby the International Nuclear Safety Group, at the\r\ninitiative of the Director General, on a multilateral\r\napproach to the nuclear fuel cycle, opens up new\r\nopportunities for strengthening the nuclear-weapon\r\nnon-proliferation regime and for promoting nuclear\r\npower development. We call for continued and more\r\nintensive work by the Agency in that regard.\r\nWe take note of the Agency’s contributions to a\r\nresearch study on innovative nuclear reactors and fuel\r\ncycles conducted within the framework of the\r\nInternational Project on Innovative Nuclear Reactors\r\nand Fuel Cycles. We believe that the Project will make\r\nit possible to work out agreed approaches to\r\nprospective nuclear technologies from the standpoint\r\nof the economic efficiency and the environmental and\r\nnon-proliferation safety and security of such\r\ntechnologies.\r\n6\r\nA/60/PV.41\r\nWe highly appreciate the progress made in recent\r\nyears in the area of strengthening nuclear security.\r\nThanks to the IAEA’s active involvement, there have\r\nbeen substantial achievements in terms of increasing\r\nthe operational safety of nuclear power plans and\r\nhandling radioactive materials, wastes and sources.\r\nThis year, changes have been made to the Convention\r\non the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material so as to\r\nextend its coverage.\r\nWe support IAEA activities in the area of\r\ntechnical cooperation and assistance to developing\r\ncountries.\r\nMadam President, allow me to dwell on certain\r\naspects of the Agency’s activities that have a\r\nsignificant impact on the international community. We\r\nnote with satisfaction the results of the Fourth Round\r\nof the Six-Party Talks in Beijing, which concluded on\r\n19 September, on the settlement of the Korean\r\npeninsula nuclear issue. We are looking forward to\r\nfurther progress in the six-party process, with the\r\nultimate goal of denuclearizing the Korean peninsula.\r\nWe are in favour of finding a balanced solution to this\r\nproblem that would protect the legitimate interests of\r\nall parties.\r\nWe view the resolution on the Iranian nuclear\r\nprogramme, adopted on 24 September 2005 by the\r\nIAEA Board of Governors, as a signal for continued\r\nand more intensive cooperation between the Agency\r\nand Iran to clarify the remaining issues. It is our\r\nunderstanding that the Agency’s potential is far from\r\nbeing exhausted, and that allows us to keep the\r\nsettlement process of the Iran issue within the Agency.\r\nWe are in favour of more intensive dialogue on\r\nthis issue among all interested nations. Decisions must\r\nbe developed that, on the one hand, can remove all\r\ndoubts about the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear\r\nactivity, and on the other, ensure the legitimate\r\nrequirements of that country. The Russian Federation\r\nwill cooperate further to solve that task.\r\nI wish to confirm our support for General\r\nAssembly draft resolution A/60/L.13, entitled “Report\r\nof the International Atomic Energy Agency”. As a\r\nsponsor of the draft resolution, the Russian Federation\r\nfully agrees on the importance of the work conducted\r\nby the Agency and is confident that that work will\r\ncontinue with a view to strengthening international\r\nsecurity.\r\nMr. Lew Kwang-chul (Republic of Korea): At\r\nthe outset, my delegation would like to thank\r\nMr. Mohamed ElBaradei, Director General of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for his\r\ninformative report on the activities of the Agency. We\r\nalso commend the Director General and his staff for\r\ntheir dedicated and diligent efforts to carry out their\r\nresponsibilities successfully.\r\nTaking this opportunity, we would also like to\r\njoin other delegations in congratulating the Agency and\r\nits Director General for being awarded the Nobel Peace\r\nPrize this year. We believe that this prestigious\r\noutcome will be recorded as irrefutable proof of the\r\nintense dedication and efforts of the Agency aimed at\r\nenhancing peace and security of the world by working\r\nto prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and enhance\r\nthe peaceful use of nuclear energy.\r\nToday, my delegation would like to make a brief\r\nstatement on the North Korean nuclear issue. First of\r\nall, we welcome the Joint Statement adopted at the\r\nFourth Round of the Six-Party Talks in Beijing last\r\nSeptember. We attach great importance to this\r\ndocument as a basis for achieving the common\r\nobjective of the verifiable denuclearization of the\r\nKorean peninsula in a peaceful manner. We also\r\nwelcome the commitments made by North Korea to\r\nabandon all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear\r\nprogrammes and to return, at an early date, to the\r\nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and IAEA\r\nsafeguards.\r\nIt is certain that the agreement reached at the\r\nprevious Six-Party Talks laid solid groundwork for\r\nprogress towards a comprehensive diplomatic\r\nresolution of the issue. My delegation earnestly wishes\r\nthat the Joint Statement, through its full and effective\r\nimplementation, will lead to steady and substantial\r\nprogress, not only for the complete resolution of the\r\nnuclear question, but also for the achievement of an\r\nenduring peace on the Korean peninsula and the\r\nconsolidation of the global nuclear non-proliferation\r\nregime.\r\nAs stipulated in the Joint Statement, we also hope\r\nthat the Fifth Round of the Six-Party Talks, to be held\r\nin Beijing in early November, will mark another\r\nmilestone through agreement on detailed follow-up\r\nsteps to ensure faithful implementation of the\r\nprinciples set out in the Joint Statement.\r\n7\r\nA/60/PV.41\r\nFor the implementation of the terms of the\r\nagreement, verification will remain one of the key\r\nelements, if the Six-Party process is to succeed. In this\r\nregard, we respect and support the role of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency in setting a global\r\nnuclear non-proliferation regime and conducting its\r\nbusiness of verification through its well-established\r\nand sophisticated safeguards system. In this regard, we\r\nwould welcome resolve and readiness on the part of the\r\nAgency to conduct the verification work in the most\r\nefficient and productive manner. We look forward to\r\nthe Agency’s continued assistance in and contribution\r\nto the smooth and efficient resolution of the North\r\nKorean nuclear issue.\r\nMr. Baeidi-Nejad (Islamic Republic of Iran): At\r\nthe outset, I would like to express the appreciation of\r\nmy delegation to Mr. ElBaradei for his substantive\r\nreport to the General Assembly on the main activities\r\nof the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in\r\nthe year 2005. This informative report indicates that\r\nthe Agency is developing its activities in many areas of\r\nnuclear technology in the interest of human\r\ncommunity. I take this opportunity also to congratulate\r\nMr. ElBaradei and the Agency on receiving the 2005\r\nNobel Peace prize.\r\nThe IAEA was established with the basic purpose\r\nof accelerating and enhancing the contribution of\r\natomic energy to peace, health and development\r\nthroughout the world. The Agency has, therefore, a real\r\nresponsibility, more than ever before, to assist member\r\nStates to utilize nuclear energy effectively and\r\nefficiently for peaceful purposes.\r\nNuclear energy today has found an important\r\nplace in everyday human life. Today, atomic energy is\r\nwidely used in agriculture and medicine. The\r\nutilization of atomic energy and its advanced\r\napplications, especially in the field of renewable\r\nsources of energy, has increased on a broad scale.\r\nIncreasing construction and operation of nuclear\r\nreactors in electricity production around the globe\r\nindicate that more and more States are pursuing nuclear\r\nenergy as a component of their energy mix in the new\r\ncentury. The new global trend to decrease the use of\r\nfossil fuel and the encouragement of States to adopt a\r\n“clean air” policy are yet further incentives for further\r\ndevelopment of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.\r\nThe essential role of the Agency in the\r\ndevelopment of activities to enhance the capacity of\r\nmember States to utilize nuclear energy is also\r\nacknowledged by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty\r\n(NPT), which in article IV imposes a commitment on\r\nStates parties to the Treaty to facilitate the fullest\r\npossible exchange of materials, equipment and\r\ntechnological information for peaceful purposes.\r\nFurthermore, States parties to the Treaty are to enhance\r\ntheir cooperation to develop nuclear energy without\r\ndiscrimination or restriction.\r\nUnfortunately, the level of cooperation in the past\r\non the part of the developed countries, who are the\r\nmain suppliers of nuclear high technology, with the\r\ndeveloping nations has not been promising. Indeed,\r\nnuclear cooperation between the suppliers and\r\nrecipients has been marked by restriction, hindrance\r\nand disruption.\r\nFurthermore, it is an unfortunate fact that being a\r\nparty to the NPT and the IAEA Safeguards Agreement\r\nnot only has not facilitated the nuclear cooperation\r\nprescribed under the Treaty between the States parties\r\nbut has even served to create impediments to the\r\npeaceful uses of energy. It is even true that non-parties\r\nare more richly rewarded through nuclear cooperation.\r\nIn the case of Israel, nuclear exchanges and transfers of\r\nadvanced nuclear materials, equipment and technology,\r\nfacilitated by acquiescence on the part of certain\r\ncircles, has contributed and continues to contribute to\r\nthe development of a clandestine Israeli nuclear\r\nweapons programme that is endangering global and\r\nregional peace and security. If anything, the failure to\r\naccept the NPT and safeguard obligations should\r\nburden outsiders to the NPT with the most severe\r\nrestrictions, rather than provide them with impunity.\r\nIran is determined to exercise its inalienable right\r\nunder the NPT to use nuclear energy for peaceful\r\npurposes within the framework of the country’s overall\r\neconomic plan. To that end, Iran is also committed to\r\noperating its programme under the IAEA verification\r\nsystem and with increased transparency, in conformity\r\nwith its basic NPT obligations.\r\nIn that context, the President of the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran submitted a formal suggestion during\r\nthis session of the General Assembly inviting public\r\nand private companies to take part in Iran-related\r\nactivities. On the basis of that policy, Iran has extended\r\nits full cooperation to the IAEA in providing the\r\nnecessary declarations and in allowing short-notice\r\ninspections at all relevant sites and facilities. Iran is\r\n8\r\nA/60/PV.41\r\nready to continue its cooperation with the IAEA and\r\ninsists that all parties must abide by the provisions of\r\nthe NPT, particularly article IV, and strictly adhere to\r\nthe Statute of the IAEA.\r\nIn conclusion, the role and authority of the IAEA\r\nin promotional as well as safeguards activities has\r\ngreatly increased in recent years. That is mainly due to\r\nthe fact that more and more countries are using atomic\r\nenergy for peaceful purposes. We should therefore\r\nendeavour to strengthen that role by avoiding the use\r\nof extra-legal unilateral measures and attempts to use\r\nthe Agency in support of short-sighted political\r\npositions, which would only undermine the authority of\r\nthe IAEA and should be avoided.\r\nMr. Martirosyan (Armenia): At the outset, I\r\nwould like to join other speakers in congratulating\r\nMr. Mohamed ElBaradei, Director General of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), on the\r\naward of the 2005 Nobel Peace Prize to the Agency\r\nand to him personally. I thank him also for the\r\ncomprehensive annual report on the work done in 2005\r\nand commend his and the Agency’s tireless efforts in\r\nfulfilling its mandate in a very challenging\r\ninternational environment. On behalf of my\r\nGovernment, I would like to express our readiness to\r\ncontinue to fully cooperate with the Agency and its\r\nleadership.\r\nThe debate on the deterrence aspect of nuclear\r\nweapons has been fuelled by new developments in the\r\nlast several years and has raised numerous questions as\r\nto the correctness of such perceptions. The spread of\r\nterrorism has further brought these perceptions into\r\nquestion, as nuclear deterrence is clearly ineffective\r\nagainst terrorist groups. It is evident, therefore, that the\r\npresent nuclear-arms-control regime needs a fresh look\r\nand approach in order to address these growing\r\nchallenges to the overall global system of security.\r\nExisting loopholes in the non-proliferation\r\nregime enable State and non-State actors to abuse the\r\nsystem, despite promises to use nuclear materials for\r\npeaceful purposes only. Complicating the situation is\r\nthe fact that effective control over access to nuclear-\r\nweapon technologies has grown increasingly difficult\r\ngiven the thin line between technical barriers to\r\ndesigning the weapons and the processing phases.\r\nIn that respect, we would like to welcome once\r\nagain the adoption by this body of the International\r\nConvention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear\r\nTerrorism, which my Prime Minister signed on behalf\r\nof the Armenian Government during the 2005 summit.\r\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency plays\r\nan important role in ensuring that nuclear technologies\r\nand materials are used for peaceful purposes only. As a\r\nnon-nuclear-weapon State and a party to the Treaty on\r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT),\r\nArmenia attaches great importance to the Agency’s\r\nactivities on the further improvement of the non-\r\nproliferation regime and nuclear verification. In that\r\nrespect, we would like to stress the importance of the\r\nAgency’s safeguards system and the need to take\r\nfurther steps to reinforce it. Last year Armenia ratified\r\nthe Additional Protocol to the Safeguards Agreement,\r\nonce again demonstrating its serious approach to\r\ncooperation with the Agency. As we stated during the\r\nseventh Review Conference of the parties to the NPT,\r\nArmenia supports the suggestion made by the Agency’s\r\nDirector General in connection with acknowledging the\r\nfact that the Additional Protocol is an integral part of\r\nthe Agency’s safeguards in every country party to the\r\nNPT.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to express\r\nmy country’s deep satisfaction with respect to its\r\ncooperation with the IAEA. We have been cooperating\r\nwith the Agency in several fields since 1995. In that\r\ncontext, high priority is given to nuclear safety and\r\nverification. Based on the conviction that safeguards\r\npromote greater confidence among States, Armenia has\r\nbeen receiving inspections — on average more than 30\r\nmissions per year — from the IAEA since signing the\r\nagreement between the Republic of Armenia and the\r\nAgency on the application of safeguards in connection\r\nwith the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons in 1993.\r\nInspection results have effectively demonstrated\r\nthat Armenia is fulfilling the commitments envisaged\r\nin the agreement. Zero discrepancy has been found\r\nfrom day one on declared and inspected nuclear\r\nmaterials, thus putting to rest once again the many\r\nunsubstantiated and absurd allegations against my\r\ncountry that some our of our neighbours attempt to\r\nmake from time to time. As a result of our cooperation,\r\nwe have succeeded in upgrading the safety of the\r\nArmenian nuclear power plant.\r\nArmenia’s national legislation in the field of the\r\npeaceful use of nuclear energy is constantly improving,\r\ndue to the adoption of a number of reform initiatives\r\n9\r\nA/60/PV.41\r\nrelating to the relevant national law. The reforms are\r\nrelated mainly to upgrading the safety and security of\r\nour nuclear plant and to the verification regime. In that\r\nsame vein, Armenia has signed the Final Act of the\r\nConference to Consider and Adopt Proposed\r\nAmendments to the Convention on the Physical\r\nProtection of Nuclear Material, the ratification of\r\nwhich is under way.\r\nThe physical protection of the nuclear power\r\nplant is a priority area for our Government. Last year\r\nwe accepted the International Physical Protection\r\nAdvisory Service mission and are expecting its report\r\nby the end of this year. In late 2005 Armenia will host\r\nanother important mission from the Operational Safety\r\nAssessment Review Team, whose report will be\r\nfinalized in 2006.\r\nNuclear energy is very important to Armenia, as\r\nit supplies about 40 per cent of the country’s energy\r\nneeds. Armenia was forced to restart its nuclear power\r\nplant in 1995 because of the continued blockade\r\nagainst it and due to the unresolved nature of the\r\nconflicts in the region and the resulting instability,\r\nwhich had negatively affected the supply of gas for\r\nthermo-power stations. As an energy security issue, it\r\nhas a great impact on the overall security of the\r\ncountry.\r\nThe energy demand in Armenia continues to\r\nincrease as a result of the double-digit economic\r\ngrowth registered in the Republic over the last five\r\nyears. It is not coincidental, therefore, that our country\r\nis seriously considering the possibility of building a\r\nnew nuclear power plant.\r\nIn that regard, we thank the Director General for\r\nhis promise of assistance — made during his recent\r\nvisit to Armenia — in the carrying out of a feasibility\r\nstudy for its construction. It should be noted that this is\r\nfully in line with the conclusions of the International\r\nMinisterial Conference held in Paris. Moreover, we\r\nbelieve that a new nuclear power plant would have\r\nregional significance as well, as it could supply energy\r\nto those neighbouring countries with shortages of\r\nelectricity.\r\nAll of those successes would have been hard to\r\nachieve had it not been for bilateral cooperation with\r\nother Member States. I would like to take this\r\nopportunity to express our gratitude to those countries\r\nthat are providing the Armenian nuclear power plant\r\nand Regulatory Authority with continued and\r\nsubstantial assistance.\r\nMr. Requiejo Gual (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): I\r\nwould like to thank Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei for\r\npresenting the annual report of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and to congratulate\r\nhim on his election to a new term as Director General\r\nof the Agency.\r\nWe also take this opportunity to reiterate our\r\ncongratulations to the IAEA and its Director General\r\non receiving the 2005 Nobel Peace Prize. The awarding\r\nof that well-deserved recognition takes place at a\r\nparticularly complex juncture of the history of\r\nmankind. The existence of large arsenals of nuclear\r\nweapons and the danger of their proliferation, as well\r\nas the development of new types of nuclear weapons\r\nand the existence of strategic defence doctrines that\r\nincreasingly rely on the use and possession of those\r\nweapons, continue to be a serious threat to all mankind.\r\nIn such circumstances, we are firmly convinced that\r\nthe only genuine solution is the total elimination of\r\nweapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear\r\nweapons.\r\nThe annual report of the Agency indicates\r\npositive results for 2004. In that regard, we stress the\r\nadoption by the Board of Governors in 2004 of the\r\nProgramme of Action for Cancer Therapy, to which\r\nCuba attaches special importance, and we call upon the\r\nmobilization of new resources, within the framework\r\nof the Programme, to energize that important field. We\r\nalso welcome the outcome of the recent IAEA General\r\nConference, in which important resolutions were\r\nadopted to promote activities in the Agency’s various\r\nareas of focus.\r\nCuba attaches great importance to the IAEA’s\r\nwork and reiterates the need to attain an appropriate\r\nbalance among the three fundamental pillars of that\r\nOrganization: technical cooperation, security and\r\nverification. Those three pillars should be implemented\r\nin a balanced way, addressing the interests and\r\npriorities of all member States.\r\nThe General Assembly should reaffirm the role of\r\nthe IAEA not only as a guarantor of the peaceful use of\r\nnuclear energy, but as an institution for the promotion\r\nand execution of international cooperation in that field.\r\nMy Government acknowledges the important role\r\nof nuclear technologies for sustainable development,\r\n10\r\nA/60/PV.41\r\nand considers the IAEA’s technical cooperation to be a\r\nkey element of the process of technology transfer.\r\nTherefore, the imposition of restrictive and unilateral\r\nmeasures in the exchange of equipment, material and\r\nscientific and technological information for the\r\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy should cease.\r\nWe reaffirm the role of the IAEA in the\r\nverification of commitments to non-proliferation. In\r\nthat regard, we reject the attempt of some Powers to\r\nprejudge the peaceful or non-peaceful nature of the\r\nnuclear programmes of specific countries, bypassing\r\nthe IAEA, which is the only international organization\r\nwith the mandate and technical capacity to verify the\r\nnuclear activities of States. We denounce the\r\nmanipulation of information regarding IAEA processes\r\nof verification in order to foment a negative opinion of\r\nsome countries in the pursuit of political goals, as well\r\nas double standards in addressing issues of non-\r\nproliferation.\r\nCuba has carefully followed the reports submitted\r\nby the Director General to the Board of Governors on\r\nthe implementation of the safeguards agreements\r\nconcerning the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT), as well as the Board’s\r\nrelevant resolutions. My Government has fully\r\nsupported the statements of the Movement of Non-\r\nAligned Countries, which has expressed its deep\r\nconcern about the content of those resolutions and the\r\nmethods leading to their adoption, while\r\nacknowledging the unbiased and professional attitude\r\nof the IAEA secretariat and welcoming the substantive\r\nprogress in and the resolution of outstanding issues,\r\nconfirmed in the most recent reports of the Director\r\nGeneral to the Board of Governors.\r\nIn that context, we strongly reject attempts to\r\ndeprive any country of its inalienable right to the\r\npeaceful use of nuclear energy, provided that those\r\nrights are exercised consistent with their safeguards\r\nobligations.\r\nThe Cuban Government continues to take steps\r\nthat clearly reflect its political will to fulfil the\r\nobligations undertaken as a State party to the NPT and\r\nthe Tlatelolco Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear\r\nWeapons in Latin America and the Caribbean.\r\nSince the entry into force of our Comprehensive\r\nSafeguards Agreement with the IAEA and its relevant\r\nAdditional Protocol, my Government has continued to\r\nfulfil its obligations, reaffirming the will of Cuba to\r\nkeep strengthening its cooperation with the IAEA in\r\nthe development of the peaceful use of nuclear energy.\r\nRecently, Cuba participated actively and\r\nconstructively in the International Conference of States\r\nParties and Signatories of Treaties that Establish\r\nNuclear-Weapon-Free Zones, as well as in the Review\r\nConference of the States Parties to the NPT, which\r\nregrettably ended without agreement on substantive\r\nissues due to the lack of will of some nuclear-weapon\r\nStates to take concrete steps towards disarmament.\r\nToday more than ever, it is crucial to work to\r\nstrengthen the IAEA, and particularly to support its\r\ntechnical cooperation activities. Cuba considers that\r\npillar to be a first priority, as reflected in our high rates\r\nof efficiency and effectiveness in the fulfilment of our\r\nTechnical Cooperation Programme with the IAEA, in\r\nthe effectual implementation rate of our projects, in the\r\ngrowing contributions of our experts to cooperation\r\nactivities with other countries, and in the fulfilment of\r\nour commitment to the Technical Cooperation Fund\r\nand to national funding requirements.\r\nMy Government welcomes the entry into force of\r\nthe Regional Cooperative Agreement for the\r\nAdvancement of Nuclear Science and Technology in\r\nLatin America and the Caribbean. The Agreement has\r\nproved to be the most important way to promote\r\ncooperation and exchange among the countries of our\r\nregion in the peaceful use of nuclear energy.\r\nMy country carefully follows activities in nuclear\r\nand radiological safety, including physical protection.\r\nIn that context, we continue to strengthen our material\r\nand organizational infrastructure, as well as our human\r\nresource training.\r\nCuba supports the IAEA’s efforts to implement\r\nprogrammes and activities designed to prevent nuclear\r\nterrorism, without affecting the human and financial\r\nresources earmarked for sustainable social and\r\neconomic development. In that regard, we reiterate that\r\nthe imposition of mechanisms of selective composition\r\nthat are non-transparent and outside the framework of\r\nthe United Nations and international treaties is in no\r\nway an appropriate response to the phenomenon of\r\ninternational terrorism, including in its relation to the\r\npotential use of weapons of mass destruction, their\r\ndelivery systems or related materials.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to affirm that the awarding\r\nof the Nobel Peace Prize to the IAEA should act as an\r\n11\r\nA/60/PV.41\r\nincentive to consolidating the transparent, objective,\r\nprofessional and impartial role of the Agency based on\r\nthe highest ethical principles, in which the important\r\ntasks laid down in its statute combine in a harmonious\r\nand balanced way. As always, the Agency and the\r\nDirector General can count on the full support of the\r\nCuban Government in that endeavour.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on this item.\r\nWe shall now proceed to consider draft resolution\r\nA/60/L.13.\r\nBefore I call on representatives who wish to\r\nspeak in explanation of vote, may I remind delegations\r\nthat explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and\r\nshould be made by delegations from their seats.\r\nI now call on the representative of the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea to speak in\r\nexplanation of vote.\r\nMr. Pak Gil Yon (Democratic People’s Republic\r\nof Korea): On behalf of the delegation of the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, I would like\r\nto make the following statement with regard to draft\r\nresolution A/60/L.13.\r\nFirst, it is not relevant for the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to mention in its report\r\nthe nuclear issue of the Democratic People’s Republic\r\nof Korea. There are no relations whatsoever between\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea and the IAEA.\r\nIn this regard, I would like to remind the Assembly that\r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic is not a member of\r\nthe IAEA or a State party to the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Furthermore, the\r\nIAEA is not in a position to deal with the Korean\r\nPeninsula nuclear issue, which is a political-military\r\nquestion between the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea and the United States of America.\r\nSecondly, the IAEA has dealt with the nuclear\r\nissue on the Korean Peninsula with prejudice. The\r\nnuclear issue is a product of the hostile policy of the\r\nUnited States towards the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea. The United States has been\r\nthreatening the Democratic People’s Republic with\r\nnuclear weapons for over half a century. In particular,\r\nPresident Bush, soon after he took power, designated\r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea as part of\r\nan axis of evil and threatened a pre-emptive nuclear\r\nattack. How did the IAEA handle the nuclear issue that\r\ncame about as a political-military dispute between the\r\nsmall and weak Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea and the super-Power, the United States, in\r\nwarring status? The IAEA, at the instruction of the\r\nsuper-Power, handled the Korean Peninsula nuclear\r\nissue with prejudice, using double standards and\r\ndiscarding the principle of equity — the lifeline of\r\ninternational organizations.\r\nWe can see similar examples in the nuclear issue\r\nof South Korea. The Beijing joint statement, correctly\r\nunderstood, does not impose obligations solely on the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, but stipulates\r\nobligations also for the United States and South\r\nKorea — the direct parties to the denuclearization of\r\nthe Korean Peninsula. The unilateral dismantling by\r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea of its\r\nnuclear programme would not bring about the\r\ndenuclearization of the Peninsula without the United\r\nStates implementing its obligations in accordance with\r\nthe joint statement.\r\nThe delegation of the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea will vote against the draft resolution\r\nbecause its purpose is to distort the nature of the\r\nKorean Peninsula nuclear issue and because it does not\r\nin any way contribute to the resolution of the matter.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the only\r\nspeaker in explanation of vote before the voting.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft\r\nresolution A/60/L.13.\r\nThe following States have added their names to\r\nthe list of sponsors of the draft resolution: Andorra,\r\nAustralia, Austria, Bangladesh, Bulgaria, Costa Rica,\r\nCroatia, Cyprus, Ecuador, France, Gabon, Guatemala,\r\nIceland, Ireland, Latvia, the Netherlands, Nicaragua,\r\nthe Philippines, Serbia and Montenegro, Spain, the\r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the United\r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,\r\nUruguay and Zambia.\r\nA recorded vote has been requested.\r\nA recorded vote was taken.\r\nIn favour:\r\nAlbania, Algeria, Andorra, Argentina, Armenia,\r\nAustralia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Bahamas,\r\nBahrain, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belarus,\r\nBelgium, Belize, Bolivia, Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, Botswana, Brazil, Brunei\r\n12\r\nA/60/PV.41\r\nDarussalam, Bulgaria, Cameroon, Canada, Chile,\r\nChina, Colombia, Comoros, Costa Rica, Côte\r\nd’Ivoire, Croatia, Cuba, Cyprus, Czech Republic,\r\nDenmark, Djibouti, Egypt, Ethiopia, Finland,\r\nFrance, Gabon, Georgia, Germany, Ghana,\r\nGreece, Grenada, Guatemala, Guinea, Guyana,\r\nHaiti, Honduras, Hungary, Iceland, India,\r\nIndonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Iraq,\r\nIreland, Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Jordan,\r\nKazakhstan, Kenya, Kuwait, Lao People’s\r\nDemocratic Republic, Latvia, Liberia, Libyan\r\nArab Jamahiriya, Liechtenstein, Lithuania,\r\nLuxembourg, Madagascar, Malaysia, Maldives,\r\nMalta, Marshall Islands, Mauritania, Mexico,\r\nMicronesia (Federated States of), Monaco,\r\nMongolia, Morocco, Nepal, Netherlands, New\r\nZealand, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Norway,\r\nOman, Pakistan, Palau, Panama, Paraguay, Peru,\r\nPhilippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Republic of\r\nKorea, Republic of Moldova, Romania, Russian\r\nFederation, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia,\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines, San Marino,\r\nSaudi Arabia, Senegal, Serbia and Montenegro,\r\nSingapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa,\r\nSpain, Sri Lanka, Suriname, Sweden,\r\nSwitzerland, Syrian Arab Republic, Thailand, the\r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Timor-\r\nLeste, Togo, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, United\r\nArab Emirates, United Kingdom of Great Britain\r\nand Northern Ireland, United Republic of\r\nTanzania, United States of America, Vanuatu,\r\nVenezuela, Viet Nam, Yemen, Zambia\r\nAgainst:\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea\r\nDraft resolution A/60/L.13 was adopted by 137\r\nvotes to 1 (resolution 60/6).\r\n[Subsequently, the delegations of Estonia and\r\nMyanmar informed the Secretariat that they had\r\nintended to vote in favour.]\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is the\r\nwish of the General Assembly to conclude its\r\nconsideration of agenda item 84?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 13\r\nThe situation in Central America: progress in\r\nfashioning a region of peace, freedom, democracy\r\nand development\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/60/218)\r\nDraft decision (A/60/L.14)\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the\r\nrepresentative of Nicaragua to introduce draft decision\r\nA/60/L.14.\r\nMr. Sevilla Somoza (Nicaragua) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): I have the honour to speak on behalf of the\r\nStates members of the Central American Integration\r\nSystem: Belize, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic,\r\nEl Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama and my\r\nown country, Nicaragua.\r\nI wish first to thank the Secretary-General for his\r\nconsolidated report, entitled “The situation in Central\r\nAmerica”, on the implementation over the past two\r\nyears of all resolutions concerning Central America.\r\nAfter incommensurate sacrifices and with the\r\nassistance of the international community, and the\r\nUnited Nations in particular, Central America has\r\nembarked on an era of solid peace and democracy that\r\nhave lasted for several years now and which we hope\r\nwill endure indefinitely. Thanks to the policies and\r\nactions being implemented by Governments to raise the\r\nstandards of living of their own peoples, as well as to\r\nthe quantitative and qualitative improvement of the\r\nIntegration System, the long decades of armed violence\r\nand the acute economic and social crises that plagued\r\nmost of our countries have now been overcome.\r\nToday, all Central American Governments enjoy\r\nthe legitimacy acquired through free elections; their\r\neconomies are growing and their political systems are\r\nbecoming more open and democratic. With the new\r\ncentury and ongoing peace, we have launched, in\r\ncountries where conditions allow, a period of\r\ntransformation and adaptation of our political,\r\neconomic and social structures in order to achieve\r\nsustainable human development and to meet the\r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nMany problems inherent to developing\r\ncountries — widespread poverty, unemployment, lack\r\nof drinking water, health problems, corruption and\r\n13\r\nA/60/PV.41\r\npolitical instability — persist and we are addressing\r\nthem. We are confident that we will be able to solve\r\nthose problems through our own efforts and with the\r\ngenerous assistance of international agencies and\r\nfriendly countries.\r\nI wish to emphasize, however, the participation of\r\nthe United Nations in a process that has led Central\r\nAmerica from war to negotiation, and from negotiation\r\nto peace and the path of development, and guided us\r\nthrough the many problems we have faced, through our\r\nfailures and successes — in other words, the\r\nexperiences that we have lived and felt and that now\r\nserve as lessons and examples to help other regions of\r\nthe world overcome similar situations.\r\nThe first resolution on Central America was\r\nadopted by the General Assembly in 1983 in the midst\r\nof the cold war and at a time when three of our\r\ncountries were riven by fierce civil wars. In that\r\nresolution, the international community expressed its\r\nconcern at the exacerbation of and tension caused by\r\nconflicts in Central America, and stressed the need to\r\ncontribute to the building of peace on solid\r\nfoundations, enabling the establishment of a genuine\r\ndemocratic process, respect for human rights and\r\neconomic and social development.\r\nAs a result of the decision taken by Central\r\nAmericans to meet the historic challenge of forging a\r\nfuture of peace for their region, the General Assembly,\r\nfour years after adopting that first resolution, asked the\r\nSecretary-General to promote a Special Programme for\r\nEconomic Cooperation in Central America (PEC). That\r\ninitiative was innovative in that it was designed to be\r\nimplemented in national territories immersed in armed\r\nconflict and to link actions already being undertaken\r\nby the United Nations system to development efforts in\r\norder to make peacebuilding more effective.\r\nUnder the coordination of the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme, the PEC contributed to the\r\nemergence of an intraregional and international\r\nconsensus allowing each country to determine its own\r\ndevelopment priorities, strengthen the Central\r\nAmerican Integration System, mobilize international\r\nresources for the region and guide its social\r\nprogrammes. It also strengthened the role to be played\r\nby the International Conference on Central American\r\nRefugees as a key instrument of the PEC.\r\nIn connection with the refugees created in the\r\nsubregion as a result of widespread violence, we recall\r\nthe 1984 Cartagena Declaration on Refugees, which\r\nbecame a creative and innovative instrument for\r\nprotection and is now considered to be an important\r\ncontribution to international law. Its importance has\r\nbeen reiterated in international forums, and most Latin\r\nAmerican countries have incorporated it into their\r\nlegislation. Its use in the region broadened the\r\ndefinition or concept of refugees set out in the 1951\r\nConvention relating to the Status of Refugees and the\r\n1967 Protocol.\r\nThe United Nations Observer Group in Central\r\nAmerica (ONUCA) was established in December 1989\r\nin order to monitor on the ground the cessation of\r\nassistance to irregular forces and insurrection\r\nmovements, as well as the disarmament,\r\ndemobilization and reintegration of Contra factions in\r\nNicaragua from May to July 1990. It also monitored\r\nthe ceasefire negotiated in that country as part of the\r\ndemobilization process. The Central American\r\nPresidents met in Montelimar, Nicaragua, to request\r\nONUCA to set a precedent by destroying all collected\r\nweapons in situ and in the presence of representatives\r\nof the Governments of the other Central American\r\ncountries. ONUCA’s mandate was thereby redefined in\r\norder to avert the proliferation of and illicit trafficking\r\nin small arms and light weapons.\r\nAnother Central American initiative was\r\nconnected to United Nations participation in the quest\r\nfor peace in El Salvador, when, in order to promote\r\naction and to help the Secretary-General in his efforts\r\nto that end, the term “Friends of the Secretary-General”\r\nwas created and applied.\r\nThe United Nations Observer Mission in El\r\nSalvador (ONUSAL) was established on 20 May 1991\r\nto monitor the implementation of all agreements\r\nbetween the Government of El Salvador and the Frente\r\nFarabundo Martí para la Liberación Nacional. The\r\nMission was later broadened in January 1992 to cover\r\nthe verification of all aspects of the ceasefire and\r\nseparation of forces, as well as the agreement on the\r\nNational Civil Police, which provided for ONUSAL’s\r\noversight of the maintenance of public order during the\r\ntransition period as the National Civil Police was being\r\nestablished. Having completed its mandate, the\r\nMission was closed in 1995.\r\nThe United Nations Verification Mission in\r\nGuatemala (MINUGUA) began operating in 1994 and\r\nlasted a decade. MINUGUA operations in the field\r\n14\r\nA/60/PV.41\r\nwere a fruitful example of multidimensional\r\npeacebuilding. An innovative transition strategy was\r\ndeveloped for the last years of the Mission in order to\r\nstrengthen Guatemala’s national capacity to promote\r\nthe peace agreement programme once the United\r\nNations presence was withdrawn and to ensure that the\r\npeace priorities would be reflected in the new\r\nGovernment’s policies.\r\nThe creation of the Department of Peacekeeping\r\nOperations is closely linked to the lessons and the\r\nexperience gained by United Nations Missions\r\ndeployed to Central American countries. As we have\r\npreviously stated, that experience established the need\r\nto link peace operations and development efforts in\r\norder to make peacebuilding and peacekeeping more\r\neffective.\r\nIn 1990, the United Nations Observer Mission to\r\nVerify the Electoral Process in Nicaragua (ONUVEN)\r\nwas the first United Nations mission to monitor an\r\nelectoral process in an independent State. Although\r\nONUVEN, which did not include military personnel,\r\nwas established by a resolution of the General\r\nAssembly as an election assistance measure and not as\r\nan attempt to resolve the Nicaraguan conflict, the\r\nMission undoubtedly played an important role in the\r\nresolution of the conflict. The United Nations\r\nexperience in Nicaragua served as a basis for the 1992\r\nestablishment of the Electoral Assistance Division\r\nwithin the Department of Political Affairs, which is\r\ntasked with coordinating the activities of the United\r\nNations system in the field of electoral assistance.\r\nIn brief, we could say that the United Nations\r\ngained a pioneering experience in Central America that\r\nresulted in, among other things, establishing a linkage\r\nbetween peace operations and development\r\nprogrammes — a concept that found its expression in\r\nthe establishment of the Department of Peacekeeping\r\nOperations, in the establishment of groups of friends of\r\nthe Secretary-General to collaborate in his efforts in\r\nthe quest for peace, in the first experience in the\r\nmonitoring of elections, which provided the basis for\r\nthe Electoral Assistance Division, and in the linkage of\r\npeace operations with the destruction of small arms\r\nand light weapons to prevent their illicit trade.\r\nToday, Central America is a changed region, and\r\nwe stand ready to collaborate with the international\r\ncommunity by putting our experience at the service of\r\nall those States that are currently in a conflict situation.\r\nOur countries believe that their experience can serve to\r\nbuild bridges linking the vision of collective security\r\nand international cooperation for development in post-\r\nconflict peacekeeping efforts.\r\nIn conclusion, on behalf of our countries, I would\r\nlike to thank the United Nations, the Secretaries-\r\nGeneral whose mandates fell within that period, the\r\nMember States of the Organization and, in particular,\r\nthose Governments that directly assist our countries in\r\nthe search for peace, democracy and development.\r\nI have the honour of introducing the draft\r\ndecision on agenda item 13, contained in document\r\nA/60/L.14, entitled “The situation in Central America:\r\nprogress in fashioning a region of peace, freedom,\r\ndemocracy and development”. My delegation,\r\nfollowing consultations with interested delegations\r\nfrom States members of the Central American\r\nIntegration System and other States, has decided to\r\nsubmit for the consideration of the General Assembly\r\nthis draft decision, which has only one paragraph:\r\n“The General Assembly, noting the progress\r\nachieved in the region, decides that the item\r\nentitled ‘The situation in Central America:\r\nprogress in fashioning a region of peace,\r\nfreedom, democracy and development’ shall\r\nremain on the agenda of the Assembly, beginning\r\nwith the sixty-first session, for consideration\r\nupon notification by a Member State.”\r\nI have made an oral correction, changing “sixtieth\r\nsession”, as it appears in the text, to “sixty-first\r\nsession”.\r\nMy delegation and the delegations consulted\r\nconsider that the problems dealt with under this agenda\r\nitem have largely been overcome by the Central\r\nAmerican countries. We therefore believe that it is no\r\nlonger relevant to introduce a draft resolution under\r\nthis agenda item, in the light of the recommendations\r\nfor the rationalization of the work of the General\r\nAssembly and in order not to distract the\r\nOrganization’s attention from more pressing problems\r\nto be tackled in other regions of the world. We request\r\nthat this draft decision be adopted by consensus.\r\nMs. Bethel (Bahamas): I have the honour to\r\nmake this statement on behalf of the States members of\r\nthe Caribbean Community (CARICOM) that are\r\nMembers of the United Nations. Allow me, at the\r\noutset, to extend our condolences to the Governments\r\n15\r\nA/60/PV.41\r\nand peoples of Central America in the aftermath of the\r\nrecent series of natural disasters that have resulted in\r\nthe loss of life and the destruction of property in the\r\ncountries of the region, particularly in Honduras,\r\nGuatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica.\r\nCARICOM, a community composed of developing\r\ncountries that have endured the ravages of natural\r\ndisasters, is well aware of the harmful impact that\r\nthose events will have on efforts to advance\r\ndevelopment initiatives. We trust, therefore, that the\r\ncountries of Central America will be provided with\r\nsustained assistance so that the advances already made\r\nwill not be jeopardized.\r\nSince the General Assembly first took up\r\nconsideration of the agenda item on the situation in\r\nCentral America, we have witnessed a renaissance of\r\nthe region as it became a region of peace, freedom,\r\ndemocracy and development. We are grateful to the\r\nSecretary-General for the informative annual reports on\r\nthis agenda item. Those reports have highlighted the\r\nunique realities of each country in the region in the\r\nareas of governance, human rights, public security,\r\njudicial reform, regional and extra-regional institution-\r\nbuilding and border issues, among others. We\r\nacknowledge the many challenges that each country\r\nhas encountered. More importantly, however, we\r\ncommend the countries of Central America for the\r\nefforts they have made, in spite of the challenges, to\r\nengender more peaceful, democratic and equitable\r\nsocieties. We also recognize with satisfaction the\r\ninternational assistance rendered to the region, as\r\noutlined in the reports of the Secretary-General.\r\nAn important aspect of the consolidation of peace\r\nin the region has been the regional integration process\r\nfacilitated by the Central American Integration System\r\n(SICA). The System is a symbol of the new face of\r\nCentral America. Today, one of our fellow CARICOM\r\nMember States, Belize, participates as a member of\r\nSICA.\r\nAt the initiative of Belize, in 2002, CARICOM\r\nand SICA held their first summit and agreed to\r\nreinforce interregional relations and partnerships. In\r\nthe joint declaration issued at the conclusion of that\r\nsummit, Caribbean and Central American leaders\r\nagreed to strengthen cooperation and coordinate\r\nactions in areas such as education, health, poverty\r\nelimination, the environment, trade and investment.\r\nThat historic summit highlighted the reality that there\r\nis much common ground between our two regions.\r\nThe recently concluded CARICOM-Costa Rica\r\nfree trade agreement reflects CARICOM’s desire to\r\nfoster closer ties with countries in Central America. In\r\nfact, the free trade agreement is seen not only as an\r\nopportunity to strengthen trade between CARICOM\r\nand Costa Rica but also as an opportunity to enhance\r\nour alliances to promote social, political, cultural and\r\nenvironmental cooperation. Thus, we in CARICOM\r\nlook forward to the entry into force of that agreement.\r\nGiven the aforementioned undertakings, which\r\nhave all served to enhance the partnership between\r\nCARICOM and Central America, we in CARICOM are\r\nhopeful that a peaceful resolution to the territorial\r\ndispute between Belize and Guatemala will be\r\nachieved in the near future. We note that the two\r\ncountries have agreed on a framework for negotiations\r\nand confidence-building measures that seeks to\r\nmaintain and deepen their friendly relationship until\r\nthe territorial dispute is permanently resolved. We are\r\nencouraged by that new development and pledge our\r\ncontinued support for a just and lasting resolution to\r\nthe dispute.\r\nCARICOM recognizes the efforts of Central\r\nAmerican leaders and peoples, as well as the efforts of\r\nthose in the international community that have\r\ninfluenced the region’s transformation. There are,\r\nhowever, both persistent and new challenges, some of\r\nwhich, as the Secretary-General’s report (A/60/218)\r\nacknowledges, have been generated by external factors.\r\nWe trust that the international community will maintain\r\nits full support to the region, particularly in the face of\r\nthose challenges.\r\nMs. Brazier (United Kingdom): I have the\r\nhonour to speak on behalf of the European Union (EU)\r\nand those countries that have aligned themselves with\r\nthis statement.\r\nMay I first offer the deepest sympathies of the\r\nEuropean Union to those Central American countries\r\nthat have been affected by tropical storms Stan and\r\nAlpha and hurricane Beta. Our thoughts are with you at\r\nthis difficult time. The EU is glad to have provided\r\n1.7 million euros in humanitarian aid to El Salvador\r\nand Guatemala in response to the recent flooding and\r\ntropical storm Stan.\r\nThe European Union and Central America share a\r\nlong history of cooperation in the political, economic\r\nand social spheres. Perhaps one of the most important\r\ngoals we share is that of achieving closer regional\r\n16\r\nA/60/PV.41\r\nintegration. Like the European Union, Central\r\nAmerican countries have found that through regional\r\nintegration it is possible to overcome prolonged\r\ninternal conflict, reduce vulnerability to external\r\nshocks, including natural disasters, and build a regional\r\neconomic platform, which enables our countries to\r\ntrade and compete more effectively in a globalized\r\nworld. As the Secretary-General says in paragraph 68\r\nof his report (A/60/218), “Central American countries\r\nhave made significant strides in cooperating towards\r\nthe establishment of a peaceful region”.\r\nIn 1983, when this agenda item was first brought\r\nbefore the General Assembly, the region was in a very\r\ndifficult situation. Then, civil war and social and\r\neconomic disintegration were facts of life for the\r\ncitizens of Central American countries. Today, the\r\nregion has made much progress towards peace and\r\nstability, democracy and sustainable development.\r\nThrough the San Jose Dialogue, the EU has been\r\nable to contribute to the process of peacebuilding and\r\ndemocratization in the Central American region. In\r\naddition, since 2001, the European Commission has\r\nhad a programme of national and regional cooperation\r\nwith six Central American countries, totalling\r\n655 million euros. This cooperation will continue in\r\nthe years ahead. A new strategy for cooperation for the\r\nyears 2007 to 2013 is currently being agreed, and will\r\nfocus particularly on issues of regional integration.\r\nThe European Union knows from its own\r\nexperience that post-conflict transition can take many\r\nyears. Central American countries still face major\r\nchallenges, such as the fight against impunity, efforts\r\nto promote transparency and democracy and poverty\r\nreduction, but these are different issues from those of\r\n20 years ago. The EU is, therefore, content with the\r\nNicaraguan proposal for a draft decision to maintain\r\nthis item on the General Assembly’s agenda, for\r\nconsideration upon notification by a Member State.\r\nMs. Juul (Norway): Central America has recently\r\nbeen severely struck by natural disasters, and we\r\ndeeply regret the loss of human lives and the scores of\r\nvictims in the wake of tropical storm Stan in El\r\nSalvador and Guatemala. We commend the\r\nGovernments of El Salvador and Guatemala on their\r\nefforts to save lives and rapidly assist the affected\r\npopulation, including the indigenous community.\r\nThe Norwegian parliament has allocated 60\r\nmillion Norwegian kroner — about $9.25 million — in\r\nadditional funds for emergency relief in Central\r\nAmerica. These funds will be channelled through the\r\nUnited Nations, the Red Cross system and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations.\r\nEven though many years have passed since the\r\nend of armed conflict in Central America, the region is\r\nstill facing a number of major challenges, such as the\r\neradication of poverty, the consolidation of democracy\r\nand the safeguarding of human rights. Good\r\ngovernance, sustainable economic development and\r\nstrengthening of the judicial systems continue to be\r\nkey issues. It is, however, encouraging to see that the\r\nGovernments of Central America are continuing, and\r\neven stepping up, their fight against corruption.\r\nPeaceful and transparent elections are now the\r\nrule rather than the exception in Central America,\r\nwhich bears witness to the gradual consolidation of\r\ndemocracy in these countries. We commend the United\r\nNations agencies and the Organization of American\r\nStates on their longstanding support for the election\r\nprocess, to which Norway has also contributed.\r\nWe would like to commend the President of\r\nGuatemala on his strong commitment to the Peace\r\nAccords and on the progress that his Government has\r\nmade in such important areas as reduction of the armed\r\nforces. The final withdrawal of the United Nations\r\nVerification Mission in Guatemala last year after\r\n10 years in the field was a positive sign. However,\r\nthere is still a great need for the international\r\ncommunity to continue supporting the implementation\r\nof the Peace Accords. We consider the Office of the\r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights to be the most\r\nappropriate international mechanism to follow up the\r\npost-conflict situation in Guatemala today, and we\r\ncommend the Government on having invited the High\r\nCommissioner to open an office in Guatemala.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nthe debate on this item.\r\nWe shall now proceed to consider draft decision\r\nA/60/L.14, as orally corrected.\r\nI wish to announce that Uruguay has joined the\r\nlist of sponsors.\r\nThe Assembly will now take action on draft\r\ndecision A/60/L.14, as orally corrected.\r\n17\r\nA/60/PV.41\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\ndraft decision A/60/L. 14, as orally corrected?\r\nThe draft decision, as orally corrected, was\r\nadopted.\r\nThe President: May I take it that it is the wish of\r\nthe General Assembly to conclude its consideration of\r\nagenda item 13?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 16\r\nZone of peace and cooperation of the South Atlantic\r\nDraft decision (A/60/L.11)\r\nThe President: Uruguay has joined the list of\r\nsponsors of draft decision A/60/L.11.\r\nThe Assembly will now take action on draft\r\ndecision A/60/L.11.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly decides\r\nto adopt draft decision A/60/L.11?\r\nThe draft decision was adopted.\r\nThe President: May I take it that it is the wish of\r\nthe Assembly to conclude its consideration of agenda\r\nitem 16?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 72\r\nHolocaust remembrance\r\nDraft resolution (A/60/L.12)\r\nThe President: On 24 January 2005, the General\r\nAssembly held its first-ever special session to\r\ncommemorate the sixtieth anniversary of the liberation\r\nof the Nazi concentration camps. At that session, the\r\nAssembly unanimously condemned the horrors of Nazi\r\nconcentration camps. We paid solemn tribute to the\r\nmillions of innocent victims of that unspeakable\r\natrocity.\r\nGenocide was committed against the Jews of\r\nEurope during the Holocaust. Hundreds of thousands\r\nof people of other ethnic origins and religious and\r\npolitical backgrounds fell victim to that crime against\r\nhumanity.\r\nThis year we are celebrating the sixtieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations, erected from the\r\nashes of the Second World War. The United Nations\r\nwas set up to protect humankind from the scourge of\r\nwar and to serve as an effective international institution\r\nfor the promotion of human rights, the rule of law and\r\nsocio-economic development for all. In that context, I\r\nwelcome the inscription of this new agenda item\r\nentitled “Holocaust remembrance”.\r\nThe Holocaust also reminds us of the crimes of\r\ngenocide committed since the Second World War. It\r\nmust therefore be a unifying historic warning around\r\nwhich we must rally, not only to recall the grievous\r\ncrimes committed in human history but also to reaffirm\r\nour unfaltering resolve to prevent the recurrence of\r\nsuch crimes. We cannot, after the horrors in Cambodia,\r\nRwanda and Srebrenica, continue to repeat, “Never\r\nagain”.\r\nLast September, after the 2005 world summit, our\r\nleaders did not fail to live up to that test when they\r\nunanimously accepted the responsibility to protect\r\npopulations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic\r\ncleansing and crimes against humanity. This is a major\r\nstep towards preventing genocide in future.\r\nIt is in the spirit both of remembering the crimes\r\nof the past and preventing their recurrence in future\r\nthat we must consider the draft resolution on Holocaust\r\nremembrance.\r\nI now give the floor to the representative of Israel\r\nto introduce draft resolution A/60/L.12.\r\nMr. Gillerman (Israel): It is an honour for me to\r\naddress the Assembly, on behalf of the State of Israel,\r\non an item of such importance to my country and my\r\npeople and to victims and survivors of the Holocaust of\r\nall faiths and nationalities across the globe. I feel\r\nmoved and privileged to present this historic draft\r\nresolution today, as an Israeli, a Jew, a human being\r\nand the child of a family of Holocaust victims.\r\nThis year, as we mark the sixtieth anniversary of\r\nthe establishment of the United Nations, we also mark\r\nthe sixtieth year since the end of the Second World War\r\nand the liberation of the Nazi concentration camps.\r\nThe unique connection between those two events\r\nis testimony to the fact that the establishment of the\r\nUnited Nations, its founding principles and its noble\r\nmission were the world’s answer to the horrors of the\r\nSecond World War and the tragedy of the Holocaust, as\r\n18\r\nA/60/PV.41\r\nis reflected in the very first clauses of the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nThe Holocaust constituted a systematic and\r\nbarbarous attempt to annihilate an entire people in a\r\nmanner and with a magnitude that have no parallel in\r\nhuman history. Six million Jews — a full third of the\r\nJewish people — together with countless other\r\nminorities, were murdered, many of them in death\r\ncamps, factories of death designed specifically for that\r\npurpose.\r\nAnd yet, while the Holocaust was a unique\r\ntragedy for the Jewish people, its lessons are universal.\r\nThe Holocaust was carried out at the height of the\r\nrational age, and it represents a watershed in human\r\nhistory. It brought us face to face with the full extent of\r\nman’s capacity for inhumanity to his fellow man. It\r\nrevealed the potential to pervert technology,\r\nphilosophy, culture and ideology to commit acts on an\r\nunimaginable scale and with an unthinkable degree of\r\ncruelty. It showed that while Jews might be the first\r\nvictims of anti-Semitism, they are rarely the last. It\r\ntaught, as Elie Wiesel has said, that indifference to\r\nhuman suffering is not only a sin, it is a punishment,\r\nand that by denying the other’s humanity we betray our\r\nown.\r\nBy so shocking the conscience of humankind, the\r\nHolocaust served as a critical impetus for the\r\ndevelopment of human rights; the drafting of landmark\r\ninternational conventions such as the Genocide\r\nConvention; and for the very establishment of this\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe United Nations was founded on the ashes of\r\nthe Holocaust and the commitment to “save succeeding\r\ngenerations from the scourge of war” and uphold and\r\nprotect the “dignity and worth of the human person”.\r\nThe United Nations bears a special responsibility to\r\nensure that the Holocaust and its lessons are never\r\nforgotten and that this tragedy will forever stand as a\r\nwarning to all people of the dangers of hatred, bigotry,\r\nracism and prejudice.\r\nThe greatest tribute that we, as an Organization,\r\nas Member States and as individuals, can pay to the\r\nmemory of the victims, to the suffering of the survivors\r\nand to the legacy of the liberators is to vow together:\r\n“Never again”.\r\nAs Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom has stated\r\nfrom this very rostrum, we stand on the brink of the\r\nmoment when this terrible event will change from\r\nmemory to history. As the generation of Holocaust\r\nsurvivors and liberators dwindles, the torch of\r\nremembrance, of bearing witness and of education\r\nmust continue forward. It is our duty to the past and\r\nour commitment to the future.\r\nIn January 2005, States Members of the United\r\nNations convened in this Hall for a historic special\r\nsession of the General Assembly to commemorate the\r\nsixtieth anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi\r\nconcentration camps.\r\nAt that session, Member States affirmed the\r\nimportant role and responsibility of the United Nations\r\nin Holocaust remembrance and education to honour the\r\nvictims and survivors of the Holocaust and to stand\r\nwatch against the re-emergence of such evil, for the\r\nbenefit of future generations.\r\nThe fulfilment of that responsibility becomes\r\never more urgent in the face of an alarming increase in\r\nglobal acts of anti-Semitism, Holocaust denial, racism\r\nand religious intolerance. Sadly, today there is no\r\nshortage of human suffering. Oppression, the de-\r\nlegitimization of peoples and discrimination continue.\r\nThe horror of the Holocaust has, to our collective\r\nshame, not prevented other genocides from occurring.\r\nThese facts compel us to establish mechanisms that\r\nwill ensure that future generations will never forget the\r\nHolocaust or its lessons.\r\nIt is imperative that all States learn the lessons of\r\nthe Holocaust, for the sanctity of life, for the\r\npreservation of humanity and for the prevention of\r\nsuch atrocities in the future. The draft resolution\r\nsubmitted under the agenda item, contained in\r\ndocument A/60/L.12, is intended to further advance\r\nthose objectives. It seeks to give expression to the\r\ncommitment to Holocaust remembrance and education\r\nwithin the United Nations system. The importance of\r\nthe resolution is reinforced by the fact that it would\r\nrepresent the first time the United Nations, in its 60-\r\nyear history, adopts a resolution relating to the\r\nHolocaust.\r\nThe draft resolution comprises 10 preambular\r\nparagraphs and six operative paragraphs and is the\r\nproduct of consultations with a large number of\r\ninterested delegations. In its preambular section, the\r\ndraft resolution recalls several key provisions from\r\nrelevant human rights instruments and notes the\r\nindelible link between the United Nations and the\r\n19\r\nA/60/PV.41\r\nunique tragedy of the Second World War. It takes note\r\nof the fact that the sixtieth session of the General\r\nAssembly is taking place during the sixtieth year of the\r\ndefeat of the Nazi regime, and reaffirms that the\r\nHolocaust will forever be a warning to all peoples of\r\nthe dangers of hatred, bigotry, racism, and prejudice.\r\nIn its operative part, the resolution calls on the\r\nUnited Nations, inter alia, to designate 27 January as\r\nan annual International Day of Commemoration in\r\nmemory of the victims of the Holocaust. It urges\r\nMember States to develop educational programmes to\r\ninculcate future generations with the lessons of the\r\nHolocaust in order to help prevent future acts of\r\ngenocide. It further rejects any denial of the Holocaust\r\nand condemns without reservation all manifestations of\r\nreligious intolerance, incitement, harassment or\r\nviolence against persons or communities based on\r\nethnic origin or religious belief, wherever they occur.\r\nIn addition, the resolution requests the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to establish a programme of outreach on the\r\nsubject of the Holocaust and the United Nations, as\r\nwell as measures to mobilize civil society for\r\nHolocaust remembrance and education, with a mandate\r\nto report back to the General Assembly on the\r\nestablishment and implementation of that United\r\nNations programme.\r\nThe initial sponsors of the resolution, Australia,\r\nCanada, the Russian Federation, the United States of\r\nAmerica and Israel, are very appreciative of the\r\noverwhelming support the resolution received when it\r\nwas submitted. At that time, the resolution had 90\r\nsponsors. Since then, the following States have joined\r\nas sponsors: Equatorial Guinea, Ecuador, Gabon,\r\nGambia, Liberia, Nicaragua, Panama and Sierra Leone.\r\nIn our deliberations with other Member States,\r\nwe have received vast support for the resolution. We\r\nurge all States to sponsor this important resolution. We\r\nwould also like to express our appreciation to\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan for his public support\r\nand commitment to the resolution, and for the issue of\r\nHolocaust remembrance and education in general.\r\nI would also like to thank you, Mr. President, for\r\nthe leadership and compassion you have shown\r\nthroughout this process and in this matter.\r\nWe look forward to the adoption of the draft\r\nresolution by consensus, so that the Organization and\r\nits Member States can, in one voice, demonstrate their\r\ncommitment to the cause of Holocaust remembrance\r\nand education, act to help prevent future acts of\r\ngenocide and advance the fulfilment by the United\r\nNations of its core mission and founding principles.\r\nLet all those who were led to nameless deaths be\r\ngiven an everlasting name here in this Hall today. In\r\nthe words of the Prophet of Israel, Isaiah:\r\n(quoted in Hebrew, then in English)\r\n“And I will give them in my house and within my\r\nwalls a memorial and a name ... and it shall not\r\nbe cut off.” (Isaiah 56:5)\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Per Stig Moeller, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Denmark.\r\nMr. Moeller (Denmark): The Danish\r\nGovernment wishes to lend its active support to the\r\ndraft resolution on Holocaust remembrance introduced\r\nby Israel. We concur fully with the views that will later\r\nbe expressed by the presidency of the European Union.\r\nDenmark is a member of the Task Force for\r\nCooperation on Holocaust Education, Remembrance\r\nand Research. We hope through our membership to be\r\nable to stimulate further research on and awareness of\r\nthe Holocaust and other genocides. A Danish research\r\ncentre on these matters has been established and\r\n27 January has been designated “Auschwitz Day”.\r\nThe Danish experience of the Holocaust is\r\nprimarily related to the operation to rescue the Jewish\r\ncommunity in Denmark during the month of October\r\n1943, a spontaneous action by the Danish people, made\r\npossible in part by the generous acceptance of\r\nDenmark’s Jewish refugees by Sweden — your own\r\ncountry, Mr. President. That event illustrates an\r\nimportant point, which is that one has to take action\r\nwhen ethnic cleansing and genocide are on the march.\r\nPassivity and silence must not become accomplices in\r\nthe crime. Responsibility to protect populations from\r\ngenocide and other crimes against humanity is an\r\nimperative. You are not guilty because you belong to a\r\ncertain race, but you are guilty if you pursue people\r\nbecause they belong to a certain race.\r\nWe have unfortunately been witness to genocide\r\nand ethnic cleansing since the Holocaust, as if we have\r\nnot learned the lessons of the past. But we have also\r\nseen a major breakthrough in the strengthening of the\r\ninternational legal order since then. I am, of course,\r\n20\r\nA/60/PV.41\r\nreferring here to the establishment of the various ad\r\nhoc international criminal tribunals and in particular to\r\nthe permanent International Criminal Court (ICC),\r\nwhich has the competence to prosecute and convict\r\npersons who have committed, participated in or\r\nordered the committing of the crime of genocide.\r\nThe Danish Government believes that the ICC\r\nwill have a preventive effect in deterring governmental\r\nregimes from carrying out a policy of genocide. At the\r\nsame time, we lend our full support to the effective\r\nfunctioning of the ICC in its pursuit of justice.\r\nWe must all learn from the hard lessons of the\r\npast, and in that spirit we welcome the draft resolution\r\non Holocaust remembrance as a timely initiative.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Phillipe Douste-Blazy, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of France.\r\nMr. Douste-Blazy (France) (spoke in French): As\r\nI take the floor to speak in France’s name before this\r\nAssembly, allow me to say how moved I am. To speak\r\nof the Holocaust is neither a banal nor a trivial matter.\r\nAs Primo Levi noted in his masterpiece, “If This Is a\r\nMan”, the Shoah is about man, his dignity and\r\nfreedom.\r\nWe who have gathered in this forum are all linked\r\nby the memory and history of the Holocaust. The\r\nUnited Nations came into existence out of the rejection\r\nof barbarism and Nazi violence. It enshrines in its\r\nfounding Charter the values that bring us together and\r\nare the foundation of this Assembly, values that are\r\ncharacterized by the rejection of extermination and that\r\nforcefully reject what happened in Europe at that time.\r\nThe strength of multilateralism, which this forum\r\nexpresses, is to build the future of peoples on all the\r\nlessons learned from the past. Some could say after the\r\nShoah that they did not know — today, it is no longer\r\npossible to say one did not know.\r\nRemembrance of the Holocaust today is our\r\nresponsibility. It is to build our future on the\r\nknowledge and clear conscience of the past — it is also\r\nto uphold a certain idea of man.\r\nFrance, like all its European partners, strongly\r\nsupported the decision to hold the special session last\r\nJanuary to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the\r\nliberation of the Nazi concentration camps. Sixty years\r\nago, the horror-struck Allies put an end to the\r\nextermination camps, those places of death whose\r\nnames remain forever engraved in our memories:\r\nBelzec, Sobibor, Majdanek, Treblinka, Auschwitz.\r\nThe 60th anniversary has been marked by events\r\nand commemorations throughout the year; the most\r\nmoving being the international ceremony at Auschwitz.\r\nAll those events were a forceful expression of the\r\ninternational community’s duty to remember.\r\nIn the face of radical evil and a plan for\r\nsystematic extermination and in the face of the\r\nnegationism that sometimes appears in one place or\r\nanother, all mankind must remember and remain\r\nvigilant. So it is for this Assembly, which expresses the\r\nuniversal conscience but also the wish for peace and\r\nconcord among nations, to send a clear message, as\r\nwas sent on 27 January in this General Assembly. It is\r\nthat same message we wish to express and to reaffirm\r\ntoday.\r\nFrance, like its European partners, is\r\nco-sponsoring the draft resolution on the Holocaust.\r\nWe have two fundamental reasons for that\r\ncommitment. The first concerns the duty to remember.\r\nIn July 1995, in his speech at the Vélodrome d’Hiver,\r\nthe President of the French Republic, Jacques Chirac,\r\nrecognized the responsibility of the French State in\r\ncollaborating with the occupying Power in the\r\ndestruction it wrought. He strongly affirmed that\r\ncollective memory is an imprescriptible principle, and\r\nalso affirmed the ethical imperative of collectively\r\nshared remembrance.\r\nMy country thus stood behind the initiative to\r\ndesignate 27 January as the International Day of\r\nCommemoration in memory of the victims of the\r\nShoah. That idea was adopted in 2002 by the Council\r\nof Europe and has since been taken up by many States\r\nand other international organizations, including the\r\nOrganization for Security and Co-operation in Europe\r\n(OSCE).\r\nBy tabling today’s draft resolution, the United\r\nNations salutes the designation of 27 January as the\r\nInternational Day of Commemoration in memory of the\r\nvictims of the Holocaust. There is, however, another\r\nreason why France fully approves the initiative before\r\nus. The duty to remember, 60 years after the tragedy,\r\nmust now be directed to new generations. The last\r\nHolocaust survivors are leaving us and only a handful\r\nnow remain. If the duty to remember is to be passed on\r\ntoday, then our duty is to educate — and that will be\r\neven more true for the future. If a crime such as\r\n21\r\nA/60/PV.41\r\ngenocide is not to happen again in the future, the flame\r\nof memory must not be extinguished and must be\r\npassed from generation to generation.\r\nThat is more than a necessity imposed by the\r\nbarbarism of the past — it is a responsibility to history.\r\nMy country long ago introduced Holocaust education\r\nin our school system. France is also endeavouring to\r\npromote that priority in all European forums. It is\r\ndoing so in the Task Force for International\r\nCooperation on Holocaust Education, Remembrance\r\nand Research, which was set up following the\r\nStockholm Declaration of January 2000. It did so at the\r\nOSCE conference in 2004 and took the initiative within\r\nthe European Union to launch a dialogue among\r\neducation ministers on the subject.\r\nThe international community has already taken a\r\nmajor legal step — which we welcome — in adopting\r\nthe Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of\r\nthe Crime of Genocide. But it is also through teaching,\r\nregular contact with places of remembrance and\r\neducation that we must awaken future generations. All\r\nover the world, such actions can help combat religious\r\nintolerance, racism, incitement to violence and\r\ndiscrimination. At the same time as the education of\r\nnew generations is rooted in history, it involves the\r\nfuture of the world and mankind.\r\nFor that reason, it is necessary that, after\r\nsolemnly marking the commemoration of the 60th\r\nanniversary of the Holocaust at the end of 2005, the\r\nUnited Nations should adopt the draft resolution before\r\nyou today. The text salutes the designation by many\r\nStates of 27 January as a Day of Commemoration and\r\nenshrines it as a day of international observance. It also\r\nhas the great merit of calling upon States to build on\r\nthis day of remembrance by working to educate future\r\ngenerations.\r\nToday, the duty to remember requires us to be\r\nvigilant and calls on us to act. Remembrance can never\r\nbe taken for granted, it is a duty that must be\r\nconstantly renewed. It requires States to mobilize with\r\nall people of goodwill involved in education and the\r\ntraining of new generations. That is the meaning of our\r\nsupport for the draft resolution before the United\r\nNations General Assembly today.\r\nMr. Ungureanu (Romania): Romania joins and\r\nfully supports the statement to be delivered by the\r\nrepresentative of the United Kingdom on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union.\r\nI wish to take the floor in my national capacity, as\r\nRomania experienced the Holocaust directly and has\r\nrecently taken a series of steps to assume and come to\r\nterms with its own past.\r\nI am proud to be able to inform the Assembly of\r\nthe progress Romania has been able to achieve, after\r\nthe obliterating experience of Communism, in\r\nregaining its whole historic memory, with both the\r\ngood and the painful chapters. We have learned to\r\naccept and live with the latter.\r\nThe Holocaust, born out of a perverse philosophy\r\nof hatred, which later became a doctrine of death,\r\nsymbolizes for us the greatest tragedy humankind has\r\never known. First and foremost, we need to remember\r\nand pay homage to those who perished in the\r\nHolocaust. We must not forget, for if we do, we may\r\nnot be able to act effectively in response to our\r\ncollective duty to prevent and make certain such\r\nhorrors will never again happen.\r\nMy country’s position on the Holocaust is firm,\r\nclear and committed. Romania has assumed a strong\r\npolitical commitment to develop Holocaust research\r\nprogrammes, education in the spirit of promoting\r\ndemocracy and tolerance and to combat anti-Semitism,\r\nconserve Jewish cultural heritage and commemorate\r\nthe victims of this tragedy.\r\nA notable step in that regard was the setting up of\r\nthe International Commission on the Holocaust in\r\nRomania, chaired by the famous Nobel laureate,\r\nProfessor Elie Wiesel. At the end of 2004 the\r\nCommission issued a report on the Holocaust in\r\nRomania — a true landmark for future studies and\r\npublic debate on the Holocaust — and provided a set of\r\nrecommendations that the Romanian Government has\r\nendorsed. This is remarkable progress in the country’s\r\nefforts to acknowledge its past, including its darker\r\naspects.\r\nMy Government is committed to fully observing\r\nthe recommendations of the Commission and to\r\nensuring the proper follow-up to its work. It has been\r\ndecided to designate 9 October as National Holocaust\r\nCommemoration Day. That was the date in 1941 on\r\nwhich deportations of Romanian Jews to Transdniestria\r\nbegan. This year, we observed Holocaust Day for the\r\nsecond time in Romania.\r\nFurthermore, in March 2002, as part of its\r\ncomprehensive approach to fighting anti-Semitism, the\r\n22\r\nA/60/PV.41\r\nRomanian Government issued a Government\r\nemergency ordinance making unlawful any\r\norganizations and symbols of a fascist, racist or\r\nxenophobic character, as well as the promotion of the\r\ncult of persons guilty of crimes against peace and\r\nhumanity.\r\nThe National Institute for Holocaust Studies in\r\nRomania was set up at the beginning of this month. It\r\nwill be in charge of gathering and publishing\r\ndocuments on the Romanian Holocaust, as well as of\r\npromoting educational activities relating to the\r\nHolocaust. We can never dwell enough on the role of\r\neducation and educational programmes in preventing\r\nanti-Semitic acts and other forms of intolerance that,\r\nduring the Second World War, led eventually to the\r\nHolocaust.\r\nWe have a moral duty to strive harder to make\r\nfuture generations understand the dangers of\r\nsystematic crimes against peoples and to turn the\r\nlessons of the past into the means to prevent\r\ndiscriminatory action from ever happening again. In\r\nRomania, an undergraduate-level textbook on Jewish\r\nhistory and the Holocaust was published at the\r\nbeginning of this month. It is structured in accordance\r\nwith the recommendations of the Wiesel Commission\r\nand will be introduced into the educational system so\r\nto ensure that Romanian students have proper\r\nknowledge about the Holocaust.\r\nCentres for Hebrew studies have been\r\ninaugurated in several Romanian cities, including in\r\nmy hometown, Iasi.\r\nIn December 2004, Romania became a full\r\nmember of the Task Force for International\r\nCooperation on Holocaust Education, Remembrance\r\nand Research, an organization that coordinates the\r\nefforts of its members for a better understanding of the\r\nHolocaust by promoting educational programmes on\r\nthis issue — programmes to commemorate the victims,\r\nas well as research programmes. In this regard, we are\r\nfully determined to play a more active role and to\r\ninitiate projects in cooperation with other Member\r\nStates or liaison countries, including at the regional\r\nlevel.\r\nSetting up an annual Holocaust remembrance day\r\nin memory of the victims is a way to make future\r\ngenerations understand that they should not forget the\r\ntragedies that ravaged twentieth-century Europe. This\r\nis also why, together with its European partners,\r\nRomania supports the draft resolution to establish such\r\na day of remembrance.\r\nI am persuaded that the step that will be taken\r\ntoday is of crucial importance for the constant\r\nremembrance and commemoration of the worst tragedy\r\nin humankind’s history. As a historian, and as Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs representing my country, I am\r\nhonoured to be a part of this Day in the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Alexander Saltanov, Deputy Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.\r\nMr. Saltanov (Russian Federation) (spoke in\r\nRussian): This year, which marks the sixtieth\r\nanniversary of the end of the Second World War, the\r\nissue of combating anti-Semitism and other forms of\r\nintolerance weighs heavily on our minds. Humankind\r\nrecalls with indignation and sorrow the horrific Nazi\r\natrocities, including the Holocaust. My country reveres\r\nthe sacred memory of the Nazi victims, including 6\r\nmillion Holocaust victims, half of them — 3 million —\r\ncitizens. Current and future generations should know\r\nthe causes of those horrendous crimes and fight anti-\r\nSemitism, intolerance, extremism and xenophobia in\r\nall their manifestations. We must also pay tribute to all\r\nof the soldiers who died for the liberation of Europe\r\nfrom fascism and saved from total annihilation not\r\nonly the Jews but many other peoples.\r\nFor my country and, I hope, for all other\r\ncountries, any attempts to glorify Nazi accomplices are\r\nabsolutely outrageous — be they former legionaries of\r\nthe Waffen-SS or other collaborators who annihilated\r\nhundreds and hundreds of thousands of innocent\r\ncivilians, prisoners of war and prisoners in\r\nconcentration camps. Humankind paid too dearly for\r\nunderestimating the Nazi threat to turn a blind eye to\r\nany attempt to revive it 60 years after victory in the\r\nSecond World War. Such attempts are on the rise, even\r\nto the extent that in some countries the day of\r\nliberation from the Nazis is proclaimed a day of\r\nmourning.\r\nIn this connection, the Russian Federation will\r\nintroduce a draft resolution during this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on the inadmissibility of certain\r\npractices that promote modern forms of racism, racial\r\ndiscrimination, xenophobia and the intolerance\r\nassociated with them. We are certain that the adoption\r\nof that draft resolution by consensus will contribute to\r\n23\r\nA/60/PV.41\r\nthe consolidation of international efforts to fight such\r\nugly phenomena.\r\nToday, our global civilization is confronting a\r\nnew and terrible threat: international terrorists have\r\ntaken up the baton from the SS butchers. The abhorrent\r\nideology of terrorism has a lot in common with\r\nNaziism. We can effectively combat that twenty-first-\r\ncentury evil only through the united efforts of the\r\ninternational community. Xenophobia cannot be good\r\nand bad. We must, as a general rule, promptly and\r\neffectively repulse any manifestations of extremism of\r\nany kind — political, nationalistic or religious.\r\nWe must continue to work tirelessly at the\r\nnational and intergovernmental levels if we are to\r\novercome intolerance. We must adopt legal measures\r\nand develop dialogue and cooperation so as to\r\ndisseminate ideas of tolerance among civilizations. The\r\nUnited Nations, as a universal Organization, is the\r\nmost appropriate forum for such an effort. That is why\r\nRussia was one of the first countries to become a\r\nsponsor of the draft resolution before us.\r\nSir Emyr Jones Parry (United Kingdom): I have\r\nthe honour to speak on behalf of the European Union\r\nand the 12 countries that have aligned themselves with\r\nthis statement.\r\nIt is 60 years since the end of the Holocaust —\r\none of the darkest chapters in Europe’s history,\r\nencompassing the attempt to exterminate the Jews in\r\nEurope and the systematic massacre of other groups.\r\nTime has passed, but the painful memories have not\r\nfaded nor can they be allowed to fade. In January, the\r\nEuropean Union fully supported the special session of\r\nthe General Assembly held to commemorate the\r\nliberation of the Nazi death camps. And throughout the\r\nEuropean Union, from our veterans to our school\r\nchildren, we have remembered the victims and the\r\nsurvivors: the millions of Jews who were murdered and\r\nthe others who were also singled out: the Roma, the\r\nphysically and mentally disabled, homosexuals,\r\npolitical prisoners and prisoners of war.\r\nToday, the international community is firmly\r\nresolved that future generations cannot be allowed to\r\nforget. The first challenge is to ensure that the\r\nHolocaust victims are properly commemorated. That is\r\nwhy the European Union supports a United Nations\r\nresolution to establish an annual day in memory of the\r\nvictims of the Holocaust. It builds on the commitment\r\nthat European Union member States and many others\r\nmade in 2000 at the Stockholm International Forum on\r\nthe Holocaust, which commemorated the victims and\r\nhonoured those who stood against it. It also builds on\r\nthe Council of Europe’s declaration in 2002 of an\r\nannual Day of Remembrance of the Holocaust and for\r\nthe Prevention of Crimes Against Humanity.\r\nIt is equally important that we draw lessons from\r\nthe Holocaust. An international day of commemoration\r\nwould also provide the opportunity to reflect regularly\r\non how the international community is living up to its\r\npledge of “never again”. The international community\r\nmust do all it can to prevent future acts of genocide. A\r\nHolocaust survivor, Rafael Lemkin, was a principal\r\ninspiration of the 1951 United Nations Convention on\r\nthe Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of\r\nGenocide. But, tragically, the world still suffers from\r\nthe evils of genocide and ethnic cleansing. Failure to\r\nprevent those crimes reflects a failure to learn from the\r\nhorrors of the Holocaust.\r\nWe ignore history at our peril. The European\r\nUnion therefore supports the aim of the draft resolution\r\nto foster ways of promoting Holocaust education. The\r\nHolocaust should be an integral part of national\r\neducation curricula. Communities and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations should play their part too.\r\nThere is no single blueprint for that, nor should there\r\nbe. But the contribution to tolerance made by teaching\r\nand learning about the Holocaust is clear. The Task\r\nForce for International Holocaust Education,\r\nRemembrance and Research, to which many European\r\nUnion member States belong, is a particularly effective\r\nway of ensuring high standards in the way we teach\r\nabout the Holocaust in our schools, universities and\r\ncommunities. We also support the draft resolution’s\r\nrequest for the Secretary-General to establish a\r\nprogramme of outreach on the Holocaust and the\r\nUnited Nations and to mobilize civil society for\r\nHolocaust remembrance and education.\r\nThe significance of the Holocaust is universal.\r\nBut it commands a place of special significance in\r\nEuropean remembrance. It was in Europe that the\r\nHolocaust took place. And, like the United Nations, it\r\nis out of that dark episode that a new Europe was born.\r\nThe member States of the European Union work\r\ntogether today to promote peace and democracy within\r\nthe Union’s borders and beyond. That is something that\r\nwe could not have imagined 60 years ago. Yet, some\r\nmembers of our societies still face intolerance and\r\nprejudice. The best tribute we can pay to the victims\r\n24\r\nA/60/PV.41\r\nand the survivors of the Holocaust is to speak out\r\nagainst such attitudes in our communities. We all still\r\nhave lessons to learn, and we therefore fully support\r\nthe draft resolution.\r\nMr. Menon (Singapore): The Indian Ocean\r\ntsunami disaster in December last year claimed the\r\nlives of some 275,000 people from 35 different\r\ncountries. Less than a year later, at least 50,000 lives\r\nwere taken in South Asia by a 7.6-magnitude\r\nearthquake. Behind the numbers, each death is a tragic\r\nstory of a human life suddenly taken, a family left\r\nbehind to grieve the loss or, in many cases, a whole\r\nfamily wiped out in one fell swoop. The international\r\ncommunity reacted in both cases with solidarity to help\r\naffected countries that needed external assistance. The\r\nfearsome power of natural disasters such as tsunamis\r\nand earthquakes to devastate entire areas in mere\r\nmoments and exterminate entire communities sparked\r\nserious discussions on what the international\r\ncommunity could and should do to save lives when\r\nsuch calamities occur.\r\nToday, we meet in the General Assembly Hall to\r\nremember the many victims, not of an act of nature but\r\nof one of the worst and most cruel acts of evil inflicted\r\nby man upon mankind. Regrettably, other such\r\nshameful episodes had been committed previously and\r\nhave been committed since then against peoples of\r\nother religions or ethnicities, although the acts\r\ncommitted were not executed in similar fashion. The\r\nkey lesson that we, the peoples of the United Nations,\r\nshould have learned from such episodes is never —\r\ntruly never again — to allow genocides, ethnic\r\ncleansing or crimes against humanity to recur. Just as\r\nwe condemn the frequent acts of terrorism that kill\r\ninnocent people these days, we need, similarly, to\r\nrecognize that there is no justification whatsoever for\r\ncommitting criminal acts such as the Holocaust and\r\nthat it is important for us to prevent such crimes.\r\nMy delegation was therefore much encouraged\r\nthat our leaders, at the recent High-level Plenary\r\nMeeting, recognized for the first time the responsibility\r\nof States to protect populations from genocide, war\r\ncrimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity,\r\nand their responsibility to act accordingly. The 2005\r\nWorld Summit Outcome states that this responsibility\r\nentails the prevention of such crimes, including\r\npreventing their incitement, through appropriate and\r\nnecessary means. It adds that the international\r\ncommunity should, as appropriate, encourage and help\r\nStates to exercise that responsibility and support the\r\nUnited Nations in establishing an early warning\r\ncapability.\r\nOn this solemn occasion, we remember the\r\nvictims and the survivors of the Holocaust. But the\r\nbigger picture goes beyond just Germany and the Jews.\r\nThe cathartic actions that post-war Germany took, not\r\nthe least of which was the acknowledgement with\r\ncontrition of those events and the etching on the\r\ncollective German memory of the wrongs that Nazi\r\nGermany had done to Jews and others, leave little\r\ndoubt that German society as a whole has sincerely\r\nlearned the lesson of history and has come to terms\r\nwith it. And contrary to what some may contend, it is\r\nnot a question of shaming, or holding responsible,\r\nfuture generations of Germans for their forefathers’\r\nactions. Rather, it is a question of a society\r\nprogramming a lesson learned into its collective\r\nmemory lest it be doomed to repeat the history from\r\nwhich it has not learned.\r\nMy delegation would urge all societies that know\r\nof, or which have committed, similar wrongs in their\r\npast, whether in peace or in war, against peoples of\r\nother religions or ethnicities, to recognize the wrong\r\nthat has been done and take active steps to come to\r\nterms with history and internalize those lessons in their\r\ncollective memory. We would also submit that those\r\nlessons of history are instructive for all peoples.\r\nLearning from the mistakes of others that led them\r\ndown the slippery slope of discrimination, envy,\r\nprejudice and hatred, we can avoid and work together\r\nto avert similar, inexcusable errors and crimes. In that\r\nregard, the advocacy of bigoted views, such as the\r\ndenial of the right of a people or a State to exist, is\r\nhighly dangerous and completely unacceptable in the\r\nmodern age.\r\nThe Holocaust occurred partly because it had\r\nbecome fashionable in some quarters, using the\r\nleverage of the media for mass propaganda, to blame\r\nthe people of one faith and descent, making them\r\nconvenient scapegoats, for all sorts of problems that\r\nthen existed. At the same time, while many did not\r\nagree with the Nazis, they felt cowed or, for some\r\nreason, chose to remain silent. That is why we cannot\r\nafford to be complacent. At the first sign of ethnic or\r\nreligious defamation, we need to act promptly and\r\nwarn strongly of the danger. We also need to actively\r\npromote greater understanding in order to dispel\r\nmisconceptions about others who are not like us but\r\n25\r\nA/60/PV.41\r\nwhose presence in this globalized world we can no\r\nlonger afford to ignore. It is all too natural that we tend\r\nto prefer other people to be like ourselves and share\r\nour way of life, our outlook and our values. So, when a\r\nminority differs from the majority, all too often, in the\r\nname of integration, which is held up as an existential\r\nraison d’être, the majority expects the minority to\r\nbecome more like them and conform to their socio-\r\ncultural norms. The minority is subjected to a process\r\nof assimilation and, in extremis, forced to accept the\r\nimposition of the majority’s system of values and\r\nbeliefs.\r\nEven though the underlying intention may be\r\nentirely noble — for example, so that they might enjoy\r\naccess to work, education, justice or political\r\nparticipation, all conducted in the ways of the\r\nmajority — it is certainly misplaced. A wiser approach\r\nwould be to work out a modus vivendi to accommodate\r\nthe minority and to live with one another. It is a huge\r\naffront to one’s dignity to be regarded as having no\r\nvalues or to be urged to jettison one’s system of values,\r\nbeliefs and way of life as being inferior or wrong in\r\nfavour of another system. Members of the majority\r\nshould always ask themselves how they would feel if\r\nthe tables were turned and they were in the shoes of the\r\nminority. It is not for nothing that great and wise men\r\nof the past have counselled us not to do unto others\r\nwhat we do not want others to do unto ourselves.\r\nIndeed, the ingredients that foster\r\nmisunderstanding and hatred remain prevalent in the\r\nworld today. It is striking to my delegation how little,\r\neven in this global age of information, some of us\r\nunderstand about others, even those living just across\r\nour borders or amongst us, who are of a different race,\r\nethnicity, culture or creed. Ignorance breeds suspicions\r\nand phobias. The tendency of modern mass media to\r\ngeneralize, caricaturize and sensationalize in order to\r\nsell news does not help matters. Stereotyping\r\ncontributes to the wrongful entrenching of baseless\r\nfears and the misprofiling of cultural and religious\r\nbeliefs and practices. We owe it to ourselves and to our\r\nposterity to urgently educate ourselves about others.\r\nThat is the very rationale underlying the repeated\r\ncalls for a dialogue among civilizations. And what\r\nbetter dialogue can we have than for all the movers and\r\nshakers and force multipliers of global information, in\r\nparticular the mass media of all stripes, to get their\r\nbasic understanding of all major cultures and religions\r\nright so that they can put out information in a more\r\nobjective manner? My delegation would submit that\r\nthe greater influence one has, especially the mass\r\nmedia, the greater is one’s special responsibility and\r\nrole to promote understanding and avoid unwittingly\r\nfanning the flames of fear and prejudice that may seed\r\nthe next conflict along the fault lines of race, culture,\r\nfaith or civilization. We cannot be complacent and\r\nneed to work at preserving the harmony that underpins\r\nthe fabric and foundations of our global society.\r\nSingapore is a small, multiracial, multireligious\r\ncity-State. Singaporeans do not share a common\r\ncultural heritage, but we have nevertheless managed to\r\nlive and work together harmoniously for 40 years since\r\nindependence. That is because we recognize our\r\ndiversity and the value of cooperation and harmony.\r\nOur Chinese, Malay, Indian, Eurasian, Arab, Jewish\r\nand other communities draw on our traditional cultures\r\nto build a common future through mutual\r\nunderstanding, tolerance and accommodation.\r\nHowever, that has not lulled us into complacency.\r\nCountries with a multiethnic population and longer\r\nhistories have broken up because of ethnic conflicts.\r\nWe realize from our own past, and from more recent\r\nexperiences of racial and religious strife elsewhere\r\ninvolving physical assaults and attacks on places of\r\nworship, how vulnerable our own social fabric is. We\r\ntake care to ensure that there is justice and equality\r\nregardless of race, language or religion, and we do not\r\nand will not condone any acts that stir up strife along\r\nracial or religious lines. As my Foreign Minister said at\r\nthe 20th meeting, in his statement during the general\r\ndebate:\r\n“Tribalism is a basic human instinct. We may\r\nproclaim that all men are brothers, but we\r\nreflexively distinguish degrees of closeness.\r\nDivisions of race, language, culture and religion\r\nrun deep in human society and surface under\r\nstress.”\r\nBeyond taking a cautious approach, we have\r\ndecided to celebrate our diversity in our daily life — to\r\nturn what may seem an adversity into opportunity. We\r\nencourage all Singaporeans to see the inherent value of\r\ndiversity. As the world moves from globalization\r\ntowards “glocalization” or global localization, our\r\nunique knowledge of cultural software, which has\r\nenabled us to network easily with both East and West,\r\nEurope, America, China, India and the Middle East,\r\ncan command a premium when people realize that\r\nSingaporeans, as intermediaries, can make a huge\r\n26\r\nA/60/PV.41\r\ndifference to their business success by fostering better\r\nunderstanding and trust, as well as interpreting and\r\nexplaining how each distinct culture works. In our own\r\nsmall ways, at the international level, such as at the\r\nUnited Nations, we hope also to contribute to greater\r\nunderstanding of the vital need for tolerance and\r\ndialogue towards building a better and more stable\r\nworld for our children.\r\nMr. Bolton (United States of America): The\r\nUnited States is proud to co-sponsor this important\r\ndraft resolution, and I am pleased to be here to speak\r\nfor it.\r\nIt is appropriate that, on the sixtieth anniversary\r\nof the founding of the United Nations, we come\r\ntogether in support of a draft resolution to\r\ncommemorate the sixtieth anniversary of the Holocaust\r\nand to honour and remember its victims. It is\r\nappropriate because the United Nations as an\r\ninstitution was built upon the ashes of the Holocaust\r\nand the Second World War with an important mission.\r\nThat mission is to help ensure that the international\r\ncommunity will never again allow such a crime against\r\nhumanity to be committed — never again allow the\r\nworld to be plunged into such violence and chaos.\r\nThe greatest tribute we can pay to the Holocaust’s\r\nmillions of victims, of whom by far the greatest\r\nnumber were the six million Jews — one third of the\r\nJewish people — who were robbed of their lives in\r\nNazi death camps, is to ensure that we never forget\r\nthem or their sacrifice. We must do everything we can\r\nso that future generations in perpetuity will know of\r\nthat great crime and learn its important lessons.\r\nWhile the Holocaust occurred 60 years ago, its\r\nlessons are no less relevant today. When a President or\r\na Member State can brazenly and hatefully call for a\r\nsecond Holocaust by suggesting that Israel, the Jewish\r\nhomeland, should be wiped off the map, it is clear that\r\nnot all have learned the lessons of the Holocaust and\r\nthat much work remains to be done. And when some\r\nMember States shamefully hesitate to decisively\r\ncondemn such remarks, it is clear that much work\r\nremains to be done.\r\nThat is why the draft resolution before us today is\r\nso important. Among its measures, it will designate\r\n27 January of each year as an international day of\r\ncommemoration in memory of the victims of the\r\nHolocaust, call for the Secretary-General to establish a\r\nprogramme of Holocaust outreach, and urge Member\r\nStates to put into place educational programmes to\r\nteach future generations the lessons of the Holocaust so\r\nas to prevent future acts of genocide.\r\nThe programme will complement the work\r\nalready undertaken by the Task Force for International\r\nCooperation on Holocaust Education, Remembrance,\r\nand Research, a group of 20 countries that has been\r\nworking with Governments, non-governmental\r\norganizations and civil society to introduce into school\r\ncurriculums material about the Holocaust and the\r\ndevastation that can result when hatred is allowed to\r\nspread and is even encouraged by rogue Governments.\r\nOther international organizations, such as the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,\r\nare emphasizing education, legislation and law\r\nenforcement as the measures that will contain and\r\neventually eliminate racial and religious hatred.\r\nThe draft resolution is the most fitting tribute we\r\ncan pay in memory of the victims of the Holocaust, and\r\nreflects the core values and principles upon which the\r\nUnited Nations was founded. I hope it will be adopted\r\nwith unanimous support.\r\nMr. Southcott (Australia): I have the honour to\r\nspeak today on behalf of Australia, New Zealand and\r\nCanada. It has now been 60 years since the world saw\r\nthe defeat of a barbaric and tyrannical Nazi regime that\r\nhad been bent on the systematic eradication of the\r\nJewish people and the violent repression of many\r\nothers.\r\nCanada, Australia and New Zealand consider the\r\ngenocide perpetrated against the Jewish people during\r\nthe Holocaust to have been the most abhorrent of\r\ncrimes. It cost millions their lives and caused untold\r\ndamage and destruction to the lives of many millions\r\nmore. Its effects have been profound on a number of\r\ngenerations and continue to be felt today. Our deep\r\nsense of loss and sorrow is not only for the many\r\nvictims and their families, but also for the vitality and\r\ntalents lost to the world as a whole.\r\nCanada, Australia and New Zealand have been\r\ndismayed by recent signs of increased anti-Semitism,\r\nHolocaust denial, racism and religious intolerance,\r\nnone of which is acceptable in any form, in any place.\r\nThe Holocaust showed the depths to which humanity\r\ncan descend and made clear the devastating\r\nconsequences of anti-Semitism, racism and\r\npersecution.\r\n27\r\nA/60/PV.41\r\nCanada, Australia and New Zealand commend the\r\ndraft resolution before us as an important step by the\r\nUnited Nations to ensure that Holocaust remembrance\r\nand education remain a priority for all countries, and it\r\nserves as a strong reminder to us all of the need to\r\nremain vigilant and take steps to prevent such horror\r\nfrom happening again.\r\nMr. Towpik (Poland): Poland welcomes and\r\ncosponsors the draft resolution on Holocaust\r\nremembrance. Our reasons therefor have been well\r\npresented in the statement made by the United\r\nKingdom Ambassador on behalf of the European\r\nUnion. I fully associate myself with that statement. Let\r\nme, however, add a few additional remarks.\r\nThe Second World War brought terrifying\r\natrocities and destruction to many nations. Millions of\r\nPoles and Russians, British and Americans, Ukrainians\r\nand Belarussians, and members of other nations\r\nsacrificed their lives in defending their countries and\r\nfighting for liberty. Millions of soldiers and civilians\r\nperished in battles, prisons, mass executions and\r\nconcentration camps.\r\nThe Second World War also brought one of the\r\nmost horrible experiences in human history, which we\r\ndefine today by the term Holocaust. It was an attempt\r\nto eliminate an entire nation; an attempt based on racial\r\nand religious prejudices; an attempt which led to the\r\ncreation of a whole system for exterminating people, a\r\nsystem that included not only racist and criminal\r\nideology, but also a horrifying machinery — an entire\r\ninfrastructure — to implement that ideology:\r\nconcentration camps and centres of extermination. It\r\nresulted in the planned and carefully executed murder\r\nof one third of the Jewish population, along with that\r\nof countless members of other minorities.\r\nWe welcome the proposed draft resolution as a\r\ngesture commemorating the victims of the Holocaust.\r\nIt is of particular importance to us Poles. Poland lost\r\nmillions — over 90 per cent — of its Jewish citizens.\r\nThe Holocaust put an end to a certain era in our\r\nhistory — an end to the world created by Poles and\r\nJews coexisting on Polish territory. The relationship\r\nbetween those two nations was not free from\r\nprejudices, frequently painful ones indeed. However, it\r\nwas in Poland that the Jewish community was able to\r\nenjoy a climate of freedom and tolerance for 800 years.\r\nIt was in Poland that many Jews found shelter and\r\nescaped the discrimination and persecution to which\r\nthey had been subject in other parts of the world. In\r\nreturn for that, many generations of Jews contributed to\r\nthe creation of a unique spiritual, cultural and\r\neconomic heritage that Poland takes pride in having.\r\nTheir great contribution will be illustrated in the\r\nmuseum of Polish Jewish history that is currently being\r\nbuilt in Warsaw.\r\nWith the draft resolution before us, we also pay\r\ntribute to those who stood against the crime of\r\ngenocide and who helped its victims. We pay tribute to\r\nthose who fought in Jewish ghettos and those who,\r\nrisking their own lives, tried to assist Jews. Those\r\npeople have been honoured with the distinction “the\r\nrighteous among nations”. To us, they are a role model,\r\nan inspiration for our younger generations. They\r\nremind us that evil can and should be opposed. We are\r\nproud that, among the 20,000 decorated with that\r\ndistinction, 6,000 are Poles.\r\nThe draft resolution also rightly emphasizes that\r\nit is important to continue educating on the history of\r\nthe Holocaust, which is the best demonstration of what\r\nethnic and religious hatred can lead to. It is a tragic\r\nwarning against any system that is based on ethnic and\r\nreligious intolerance.\r\nPoland will spare no effort to ensure the lasting\r\npreservation of the remnants of the Nazi concentration\r\ncamps and extermination centres that were located in\r\nPoland by the German occupiers. They should remain\r\nplaces that are open to the world, where historic\r\nreflection and education can take place in the spirit of\r\ndemocracy and tolerance.\r\nIt is our duty to shape the awareness of young\r\ngenerations in a spirit of tolerance, respect for human\r\nrights and sensitivity to any manifestation of\r\ndiscrimination. That goal can be implemented through\r\neducational programmes, such as those planned at the\r\nInternational Centre of Education About Auschwitz\r\nand the Holocaust and the Institute of Peace and\r\nReconciliation, which will study contemporary acts of\r\ngenocide. Poland has also developed youth exchange\r\nprogrammes, which are the best form of active\r\ndialogue to combat stereotypes by confronting it with\r\npersonal experience and person-to-person contact. An\r\nexample of such a programme is the annual March of\r\nthe Living, in which Jewish and Polish youth\r\nparticipate, organized by the Auschwitz-Birkenau\r\nMuseum.\r\n28\r\nA/60/PV.41\r\nFinally, the draft resolution reminds us that the\r\nmain lesson that should be drawn from the terrible\r\nexperience of the Holocaust is that we should not allow\r\na similar tragedy to happen again against any nation.\r\nThe generation that has witnessed the horrors of the\r\nHolocaust is slowly passing away. Now it is our\r\nresponsibility and the responsibility of the\r\nOrganization to remember, to remind and to warn.\r\nMr. Pleuger (Germany): First of all, I would like\r\nto express my full support for the statement presented\r\nby the British Ambassador on behalf of the presidency\r\nof the European Union.\r\nFor my country, the commemoration of the\r\nmillions of victims of the Holocaust means\r\nremembering not only one of the darkest chapters in\r\nEurope’s history, but remembering the very darkest\r\nchapter in the history of Germany. Chancellor Gerhard\r\nSchroeder, when speaking in April 2005 at the sixtieth\r\nanniversary of the liberation of the concentration camp\r\nof Buchenwald, emphasized the unwavering\r\ncommitment to democracy and human rights\r\noriginating in the terrible experiences of the past in\r\nsaying:\r\n“The Europe of freedom, peace and democracy\r\nthat we have created over the past 50 years\r\ncertainly has many roots, but the deepest roots of\r\nall are embedded in the darkest years of the\r\ntwentieth century — the years when the silent\r\nterror of the camps held this very Europe in its\r\ngrip… From these camps came the most insistent\r\nappeal to oppose the forces of injustice and\r\ntyranny in whatever guise they may take.”\r\nAt a time when the last personal witnesses of the\r\nHolocaust are leaving us, it is especially important to\r\nfind new ways to keep the fate of the victims alive in\r\nthe memory of the world and to keep on asking how\r\nsuch crimes could ever be committed. Every generation\r\nhas to define its own answer to that question. It is our\r\nresponsibility to keep continuous guard against anti-\r\nsemitisim, racism and any form of political, religious\r\nor otherwise motivated and disguised intolerance.\r\nAs members of the generations living after the\r\nHolocaust, we know that genocide is not solely about\r\nthe mass murder of human beings. Indeed, we know\r\nthat the roots of genocide may be found in words, in\r\npolitical concepts, in the denial of human, civil and\r\npolitical rights to certain groups of people, or in the\r\ndehumanizing of political adversaries, the preaching of\r\nhatred and the call for the annihilation of peoples or\r\nStates. Only by remembering and by defending the\r\nhuman rights and dignity of each and every person in\r\nthis world may we be saved from having to witness\r\nrepetitions of history.\r\nIt is very fitting that we are discussing this issue\r\nhere at the heart of the United Nations in the General\r\nAssembly, because the United Nations was founded in\r\nparticular in order to prevent genocide and to defend\r\nthe human rights of each and every one of us.\r\nGermany, in close cooperation with its friends\r\nand partners in Europe, has been and is deeply\r\ncommitted to the strengthening of the United Nations,\r\nwhich is at the centre of the global struggle for human\r\nrights and human dignity. Remembering the Holocaust\r\nis part of that struggle, and that is why Germany fully\r\nsupports and co-sponsors the draft resolution before us.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President: I would like to inform members\r\nthat on Thursday, 3 November 2005, the General\r\nAssembly will take up agenda item 43, “Culture of\r\npeace”, as the last item, under which action will be\r\ntaken on draft resolutions A/60/L.4/Rev.1 and\r\nA/60/L.10.\r\nThe meeting rose at 5.35 p.m.\r\n"
