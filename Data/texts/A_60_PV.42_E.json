(Sweden) \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 9.45 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 72 (continued) \r\n \r\n \r\nHolocaust remembrance \r\n \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/60/L.12) \r\n \r\n \r\n  Report of the Fifth Committee (A/60/528) \r\n \r\n The President: The report of the Fifth \r\nCommittee on the programme budget implications of \r\ndraft resolution A/60/L.12 is contained in document \r\nA/60/528. \r\n Ms. Liu Zhongxin (China) (spoke in Chinese): I \r\nshould like to make the following statement on item 72 \r\non behalf of Ambassador Wang Guangya, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of China to the United Nations. \r\n This year marks the sixtieth anniversary of the \r\nvictory of the anti-fascist war and the liberation of \r\nNazi concentration camps. Allow me to express, on \r\nbehalf of the Chinese Government and people, our \r\nprofound condolences in connection with the 6 million \r\nJewish and other victims of the Holocaust and our \r\nsincere sympathy to all the bereaved families and the \r\nsurvivors of the Holocaust. \r\n The Second World War was unprecedented in \r\nhuman history. During that war, Nazi forces planned to \r\nwipe out the entire Jewish nation step by step through \r\nextremely brutal and sanguinary acts — a gross and \r\nmassive violation of human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms and an assault against civilizations. \r\n The judgments of the Nuremberg International \r\nMilitary Tribunal handed down at the trials of Nazi \r\nGerman war criminals upheld international justice and \r\nsafeguarded human dignity, reflecting the common \r\naspiration of peace- and justice-loving people \r\nthroughout the world. It was a historic judgment, and a \r\njust one. It is irreversible and beyond contest. \r\n Sixty years ago, military aggressors also inflicted \r\nuntold misery on Asia. Casualties in China alone \r\nreached 35 million, of which more than 300,000 died \r\nduring the 1937 Nanjing massacre. Like the Jewish \r\npeople, the people of Asia will never forget that \r\nchapter in our history. \r\n Our purpose in emphasizing such an indelible \r\nmemory is not to perpetuate hatred but to use history as \r\na mirror and to look into the future. The bitter lessons \r\nof the Second World War and the tragedy of the Nazi \r\nconcentration camps have taught us that the basic \r\nvalues of freedom, democracy, equality, justice and \r\npeace cannot be denied, and that the civilizational \r\nprocess cannot be destroyed.  \r\n All evil, dark and reactionary forces are bound to \r\nbe swept aside by the torrents of history. We hope that \r\nthe countries concerned will draw lessons from history, \r\npursue peaceful development and prevent the \r\nrecurrence of such a tragedy. \r\nA/60/PV.42  \r\n \r\n2 05-59019 \r\n \r\n The Chinese delegation is in favour of adding the \r\nitem entitled “Holocaust remembrance” to the agenda \r\nof the current session of the General Assembly and of \r\nadopting a draft resolution bearing the same title. We \r\nbelieve that the United Nations has the responsibility to \r\nteach succeeding generations the profound lessons of \r\nthe Holocaust, refute any words or acts aimed at \r\nreversing the verdict on the Holocaust, and prevent the \r\nrecurrence of such acts of genocide. We are convinced \r\nthat substantive and consistent deliberations on this \r\nitem in the General Assembly will reinforce the efforts \r\nof the United Nations system to realize the purposes \r\nand principles of the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nadvance the dialogue among civilizations and religions, \r\nand promote respect for global diversity, thus enabling \r\ncountries and peoples worldwide jointly to fulfil the \r\nhistoric mission of maintaining world peace and \r\npromoting common development. \r\n Prince Zeid Ra’ad Zeid Al-Hussein (Jordan): It \r\nis appropriate for us to have another discussion on the \r\nHolocaust within the context of the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, for we should never cease to draw \r\nthe relevant lessons from that astonishing and \r\nterrifying period of human experience. The Holocaust \r\nwas, and is, a different genocide — a genocide during \r\nwhich wickedness fell into union with human \r\norganization and efficiency of a sort hitherto unheard \r\nof, one which turned a continent into a slaughterhouse, \r\nwith twentieth-century specifications. \r\n In sum, it was a crime of the most colossal \r\nproportions. Therefore, in our invocation of history, \r\nwhich is what this draft resolution is all about, we must \r\nbe precise and accurate. While most delegations here \r\nwould view this topic as the historical narrative of \r\nothers, for Europeans, the narrative is memory, as was \r\nstated most eloquently by the representatives of \r\nNorway, Austria, Hungary and Romania in this Hall on \r\n24 January 2005. \r\n It is certainly not the intention of this delegation \r\nto cast any aspersions in the direction of any particular \r\nquarter, for the Europe of today is not the Europe of the \r\nfirst half of the twentieth century. But there can be no \r\nsound discussion of this most serious issue without \r\nacknowledging the context in which it occurred. \r\n The Holocaust was, in its broadest sense, a crime \r\ninflicted on European soil, by Europeans against \r\nEuropeans. The administrative and logistical exertions \r\nin the commission of the crime were undertaken not \r\njust, as we know, by the Nazis of Germany, but also by \r\nseveral other sympathetic Governments from across \r\nEurope, Governments who arrested their own nationals \r\nwhen no crime had been committed and seized their \r\nestates and titles and virtually all that those people \r\nowned, before transporting them — men, women and \r\nchildren, the elderly and the infirm — to other parts of \r\nEurope to confront an uncertain and often terrible fate, \r\nwhile other Governments invoked policies amounting \r\nto indifference. \r\n Sixty years on, we live at a time when it is still \r\ndifficult for the vast majority of Member States to \r\nexamine their own national histories to their very \r\nlimits, particularly their modern histories. And while \r\nwe should continue to feel great pride in what good we \r\nfind in them, we must also begin to reckon with what \r\nin our national memory is distasteful or perhaps even \r\ncriminal or terrible. It is therefore extraordinary and \r\nencouraging how a few European States have started to \r\nfollow the example set by Germany many years ago, in \r\nbeginning a process of recovering memory and in \r\nbeginning a painful and critical, although ultimately \r\nliberating, self-examination where their part in the \r\nHolocaust is concerned. \r\n But to what other purpose must we all draw on \r\nour memories generally and, in this instance, the \r\nmemories of others? First and foremost, we must \r\nremind ourselves of the extent to which chauvinistic \r\nnationalisms and philosophies of negation can be \r\npernicious. In the context of Europe in the 1930s, those \r\nfeelings were channelled in the form of a virulent and \r\nabhorrent anti-Semitism. Today they could fan a \r\nrevived anti-Semitism, or they could appear in the form \r\nof other expressions, akin to what we all have \r\nwitnessed recently in the Balkans and in certain parts \r\nof Africa. \r\n Given the historical suffering of the Jewish \r\npeople and in view of the fact that European Jewry was \r\nthe principal victim of the Holocaust, there has been a \r\ntendency by some to view the refrain “Never again” \r\nsolely within that understanding: the context of the \r\nJewish people and their future. \r\n The concentration of evil found within the \r\nhistorical experience that is the Holocaust does, \r\nhowever, bring the point home for all peoples \r\neverywhere, Jewish and otherwise. And the principal \r\nlesson drawn by 100 members of the General Assembly \r\nis that if we are ever to make genocide and the like \r\n A/60/PV.42\r\n \r\n05-59019 3 \r\n \r\ntruly unthinkable in the future, not only must we \r\nsquarely confront the philosophies of negation within \r\nour own societies, wherever and whenever they occur, \r\nbut, if we are to give true meaning to the phrase \r\n“Never again”, we must also collectively support the \r\nexistence of the world’s only permanent judicial body \r\ndesigned to end impunity for the gravest of crimes — \r\nand that body is, of course, the International Criminal \r\nCourt. \r\n Unfortunately, and by contrast, “Never again” is \r\nalso sometimes used as a form of moral justification \r\nfor the implementation by one State of policies the \r\neffect of which is the continued domination of one \r\npeople by another and the continued degradation of one \r\npeople by another. And that is deeply unfortunate. \r\n Ultimately, we hope this occasion and ones like \r\nthis will enable us to derive the right lessons from the \r\natrocities committed by the Nazis and their \r\naccomplices to ensure that such crimes will not come \r\nto blight the twenty-first century as it begins to unfold \r\nbefore us. \r\n Mr. Skinner-Klée (Guatemala) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): We are gathered here today in remembrance \r\nof the victims of the Holocaust, innocent human beings \r\nwho were the victims of ethnic and racial hatred and \r\npolitical and social intolerance. The Shoah is the \r\ngreatest horror suffered by humanity in the twentieth \r\ncentury: the execrable extermination of more than one \r\nthird of the Jewish people, along with countless \r\nmembers of other minorities who died unjustly and \r\ncruelly, murdered only because they were different, \r\nonly because they were not understood or tolerated. \r\n That abominable outrage will forever burden the \r\nconscience of humanity and all nations, which \r\nbelatedly realized that hatred, fanaticism, racism and \r\nprejudice lead but to the negation of life and to all that \r\ndebases the human person. This is why the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights recognizes that freedom, \r\njustice and peace in the world are based on recognition \r\nof the intrinsic dignity of the individual and equal and \r\ninalienable rights of all human beings, while disregard \r\nand contempt for human rights have been the cause of \r\nshocking barbarous acts against all humankind. \r\n The present remembrance calls to our mind the \r\nsaddest and most ignominious period of the history of \r\nhumankind, confronting us with the greatest outrage \r\ninflicted on any people, an unjustifiable tragedy that \r\nhumanity must not forget lest it suffer once again from \r\nsuch a horrendous and blind evil. During the \r\nceremonies to commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of \r\nthe liberation of Auschwitz in southern Poland, the \r\nformer Polish Foreign Minister Wladyslaw \r\nBartoszewski reminded us, on behalf of the survivors, \r\nhow Polish resistance had alerted the free world to the \r\nsituation in Auschwitz but that no country in the world \r\nreacted adequately to the gravity of the situation. We \r\nare now engaged in a solemn act of remembrance, not \r\nonly in order to alert future generations but also, \r\nfundamentally, to forge a new conscience in the \r\npeoples for the purpose of ensuring that no such \r\nignominious crime will ever recur or be the object of \r\ncomplicit silence. Never again. \r\n The circumstances that lead a more powerful \r\nsocial group to seek to annihilate another, weaker \r\ngroup or to demonstrate intolerance towards it, are the \r\nresult of diverse and complex factors. Some factors \r\nrelate to perverse ideologies, some to religious \r\nfanaticism and racist doctrines and others simply to \r\nfear. They all share the common characteristic of \r\nignorance, which is nothing other than intolerance in \r\ndisguise. That has driven certain social groups to act \r\nirrationally, committing the most inhuman and aberrant \r\nacts, such as genocide, ethnic cleansing, racism, anti-\r\nSemitism, extremism and xenophobia — acts of evil \r\nwhose victims are all human beings. \r\n Thus, the constructive and peaceful coexistence \r\nof peoples depends on mutual respect and mutual \r\nunderstanding. Unless there is a genuine dialogue \r\namong nations and among civilizations, ignorance will \r\npersist and the human family will continue to be \r\nthreatened or once again become its own victim. We \r\nmust question some of our ancestral habits and deal \r\nhonestly with the problems that separate us, seeking \r\nnew channels for communication and change capable \r\nof generating a new conscience for future generations. \r\n Guatemala knows only too well the horror caused \r\nby intolerance. Guatemalans have suffered in their own \r\nflesh the maelstrom of violence that afflicted our \r\ncountry merely because some people professed \r\ncontrary views, held different beliefs or belonged to a \r\ndifferent ethnic or social group. Today, Guatemalans \r\nare striving to know one another better and become \r\nmore integrated, thus effacing all exclusivist and \r\ndiscriminatory ideologies and prejudices. \r\n Mr. Diarra (Mali), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\nA/60/PV.42  \r\n \r\n4 05-59019 \r\n \r\n We therefore support the adoption of measures \r\nseeking to mobilize world society in order to assist in \r\nthe prevention of all cruel, loathsome and degrading \r\nacts in the future and promote dialogue and tolerance. \r\nWe also support the appeal for the elaboration of \r\noutreach programmes that instil the lessons of the \r\nHolocaust and the establishment of an education \r\nprogramme entitled “The Holocaust and the United \r\nNations”. \r\n Pope John Paul II was truly inspired when he \r\nstated,  \r\n“May it serve, today and for the future, as a \r\nwarning: there must be no yielding to ideologies \r\nwhich justify contempt for human dignity on the \r\nbasis of race, colour, language or religion.” \r\n The international community should, indeed, \r\nremain vigilant and should not delude itself into \r\nbelieving that the battle has been won to create a \r\ncivilization that is truly liberal, humanistic and \r\ndemocratic, in which all people can live in peace and \r\ntrust in a happy and prosperous justice.  \r\n Mr. Shin Kak-Soo (Republic of Korea): Let me \r\nbegin by joining other delegations in expressing our \r\ndeepest sympathy in connection with the millions of \r\nvictims of the Holocaust during the Second World War, \r\nwho were murdered because of their ethnic origins, \r\nreligious faith or political beliefs, and in condemning \r\nin the strongest possible terms the horrific, inhuman \r\ncrimes against humanity committed by the Nazi \r\nregime. \r\n It goes without saying that such a horrendous \r\ntragedy should never be allowed to recur. To our \r\ndismay, however, we cannot deny that even today we \r\nare witnessing genocide and many crimes against \r\nhumanity, from Srebrenica to Kigali to Darfur. Those \r\nrecent acts of genocides and crimes against humanity, \r\nstill fresh in our memory, compel the international \r\ncommunity to redouble its efforts to put in place a \r\nreliable and effective security system that deters such \r\nheinous crimes and promotes mutual understanding \r\nand tolerance among people of all ethnicities, races, \r\ncultures and nations. \r\n It was with such solemn obligations in mind that \r\nStates Members of the United Nations convened a \r\nspecial session of the General Assembly early this year. \r\nOn that occasion Member States committed themselves \r\nto doing their utmost to prevent the recurrence of such \r\na calamity, while remembering and drawing lessons \r\nfrom the Holocaust and paying their respect to its \r\nvictims. \r\n My delegation would like to take this opportunity \r\nto emphasize the importance of what we achieved \r\nregarding the responsibility to protect in the outcome \r\ndocument adopted at the world summit in September. \r\nThe leaders of Member States agreed on the collective \r\nresponsibility of the international community to protect \r\npopulations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic \r\ncleansing and crimes against humanity when national \r\nauthorities manifestly fail to do so. The faithful, swift \r\nand effective implementation of that responsibility to \r\nprotect will help to prevent, deter or halt such \r\nsituations. My delegation earnestly hopes that serious \r\nefforts will be made to carry forward that important \r\ndevelopment in following up the world summit. \r\n As a country that suffered greatly from atrocities \r\ncommitted during the Second World War, the Republic \r\nof Korea has decided to become a sponsor of the draft \r\nresolution on Holocaust remembrance. We believe that \r\nproclaiming 27 January as an annual International Day \r\nof Commemoration in memory of the victims of the \r\nHolocaust is a good way to ensure that the Holocaust’s \r\ndreadful lessons are not forgotten. We cannot allow the \r\nmemory of those crimes to fade with the passage of \r\ntime. \r\n We also believe strongly that any attempt to deny \r\nthe Holocaust as a historical reality, in full or in part, \r\nmust be rejected. It takes courage to tell the truth about \r\nthe past when that truth is painful or even shameful. \r\nFor many survivors of those crimes against humanity, \r\nit took years to recover the strength to tell their \r\nstories — stories which are now indelibly inscribed in \r\nour collective memory. That is also true for many of \r\nthe Korean victims who suffered very severely during \r\nthe Second World War. We cannot build a positive, \r\nsustainable future if we turn a blind eye to our painful \r\npast. As has often been said, those who ignore the \r\nlessons of history are doomed to repeat it. Facing up to \r\nthe truth of history and learning its lessons is not a \r\nchoice but an obligation. \r\n In this regard, we strongly support the draft \r\nresolution’s recommendation to develop educational \r\nprogrammes that will teach the lessons of the \r\nHolocaust to future generations. It is the collective \r\nobligation of humanity to promote education and \r\ntolerance so that there will never again be a similar \r\n A/60/PV.42\r\n \r\n05-59019 5 \r\n \r\ntragedy. We hope that such education will consist of \r\nmore than the recital of a ritualized litany of horrors. \r\nInstead, future generations must be taught about that \r\nchapter in history in a way that enables them to \r\nunderstand how it happened and to prevent its \r\nrecurrence. \r\n The Republic of Korea is firmly committed to \r\nupholding the dignity of all human beings and to \r\nrespecting human rights for all. We pledge our \r\nunwavering support for the efforts of the United \r\nNations to protect and promote the fundamental human \r\nrights and dignity of all humanity. Although it is too \r\nlate for the millions of victims of the Holocaust and \r\nother crimes against humanity during and since the \r\nSecond World War, we should work as hard as we can \r\nto ensure that human rights are respected and secure \r\nfor future generations. It is our deepest wish that, \r\nthrough the teaching of truth and the fostering of \r\ntolerance, our children will grow up in a new world \r\nfree from the traumas and tragedies of the century that \r\nwe so recently left behind. \r\n Mr. Dapkiunas (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): The \r\ndraft resolution to be adopted today is a testament to \r\nterrible grief and pain. For the people of my country, \r\nBelarus, such pain is not an alien experience; it is our \r\npain as well. The flames of blind racial hatred and \r\nethnic exclusion did not only claim countless victims \r\nin Belarus. The brutality of the Nazi regime and the \r\nincinerating flames of the Holocaust are seared into the \r\nsoul of the people of Belarus.  \r\n Why, 60 years after the end of the Second World \r\nWar, are we still returning to this topic — not as a \r\ndistant and tragic chapter of our history, but as a page \r\nin our collective life that has not yet been turned? Why \r\ndo many millions of people throughout the world \r\ncontinue to experience the daily, direct and obvious \r\nthreat of death and unbearable suffering that result \r\nfrom ideas of racial superiority and ethnic enmity?  \r\n There are two possible answers to that question. \r\nOne of them is understandable at the human level. The \r\nother is something that no one who has a heart can \r\nreconcile himself to.  \r\n On the one hand, the wounds caused by the \r\nSecond World War proved so deep that, even many \r\ndecades after it ended, we cannot heal. We still feel the \r\nunbearable pain of loss. Our blood still runs cold at the \r\nthought of the terrible abyss into which human beings \r\nwere plunged by the Second World War. Let us once \r\nagain ponder the living heritage of the war in our souls \r\nat a time when we, the community of nations, are \r\ncalled upon to decide which pages of our common \r\nhistory can be turned with a clear conscience, and \r\nwhich cannot. \r\n On the other hand, the page on which the \r\nHolocaust is written — the story of the victims and of \r\nthe suffering inflicted by the plague of Naziism on so \r\nmany peoples — cannot and must not be turned as long \r\nas humankind has not fully learned the lessons of the \r\nSecond World War and the lessons of the Holocaust. \r\n We know that we have not yet learned those \r\nlessons. However, we cannot do so on our own; the evil \r\ninflicted by the Holocaust is too great. Humankind \r\nmust learn those lessons jointly.  \r\n As long as we live in a world divided into “us and \r\nthem”, as long as we feel that the bitter lessons of \r\nhistory must be learned by others and not by us, as \r\nlong as we do not do everything in our power to \r\nunderstand and welcome those who do not resemble us, \r\nthe echoes of the Holocaust will continue to resound in \r\nour hearts. \r\n Mr. Kuchinsky (Ukraine): While aligning myself \r\nfully with the statement by the European Union \r\npresidency, I would like to make a few remarks on \r\nbehalf of Ukraine. \r\n The Holocaust is a permanently painful subject \r\nnot only for the Jewish people but for the world \r\ncommunity as a whole. We remember the enormous \r\nsuffering of those who perished in the death camps at \r\nAuschwitz, Buchenwald, Dachau and many other \r\nhorrific sites, where, in the name of a perverse and \r\ninhuman ideology, millions of human beings were \r\ndeliberately and cruelly exterminated. Jews and \r\ngypsies, men and women, children and the elderly — \r\nthe sons and daughters of different nations, including \r\nhundreds of thousands from Ukraine, became the \r\ninnocent victims of a ruthless political system that \r\ncaused immense losses to humankind. \r\n The terrible images of the Holocaust were vivid \r\nin the minds of those who authored the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights and of those who adopted \r\nthe Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of \r\nthe Crime of Genocide. \r\n Many thought that the horrors of the Second \r\nWorld War — the camps, the cruelty, the \r\nexterminations that took place during the Holocaust — \r\nA/60/PV.42  \r\n \r\n6 05-59019 \r\n \r\ncould never happen again. And yet they have — in \r\nCambodia, Srebrenica, Rwanda and, most recently, in \r\nDarfur. \r\n In that respect, we are deeply convinced that the \r\nhistory of the Holocaust must be learned and \r\nextensively explained so that a similar tragedy never \r\nhappens again. The inter-ethnic conflicts that, \r\nunfortunately, continue to take place in the world today \r\nshow that humankind still lacks tolerance and that the \r\nlessons of the Holocaust remain highly relevant and \r\nrequire the continued attention of the entire \r\nmembership of the United Nations. \r\n The history of Holocaust is widely studied and \r\ntaught in Ukraine. The Government of Ukraine \r\nsupports the initiative of the Jewish community to \r\ncreate a Ukrainian Museum of the Holocaust in Kiev. \r\nWe hope that this project will be implemented soon. \r\n The Orange Revolution has led to dramatic social \r\nand political changes in Ukraine, which I am sure will \r\nhave a positive impact on the lives of its Jewish \r\ncommunity, which has made a worthy contribution to \r\nthe strengthening of my country’s independence. \r\n At the Government level, we are doing our best to \r\ncreate adequate conditions for the revitalization and \r\ndevelopment of all minority communities in Ukraine. \r\nThe minority legislation put in place to ensure inter-\r\nethnic harmony and national diversity in Ukraine fully \r\naccords with the highest international human rights \r\nstandards. \r\n As we commemorate the victims of the \r\nHolocaust, Ukraine cannot but recall the terrible \r\ndamage which intolerance, violence and aggression \r\ncaused it in the past. This year marks the seventy-\r\nsecond anniversary of one of the most tragic chapters \r\nin Ukraine’s history, the Great Famine of 1932-33 — in \r\nUkrainian, Holodomor, which means “death by \r\nfamine”. Deliberately aimed at the very core of the \r\nUkrainian nation, the cruel campaign of terror by \r\nhunger carried out by the totalitarian Soviet regime led \r\nto the deaths of seven to 10 million innocent men, \r\nwomen and children. \r\n The scourge of Holodomor remains a deep \r\npsychological trauma for our people. After more than \r\nseven decades, that catastrophe is clearly one of the \r\nmost shocking crimes ever committed against \r\nhumankind. Yet Holodomor continues to be one of \r\nthose national tragedies that still await wide \r\ninternational recognition. \r\n Two years ago, a joint statement on the seventieth \r\nanniversary of Holodomor, supported by more than 60 \r\ndelegations — a third of the membership of the United \r\nNations — was issued as an official document of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. In that declaration, for the first time \r\nin the history of the United Nations, Holodomor was \r\nofficially recognized as a national tragedy of the \r\nUkrainian people, caused by the cruel actions and \r\npolicies of a totalitarian regime. Representatives of \r\nStates from various parts of the world expressed \r\nsympathy in connection with the victims of Holodomor \r\nand deplored the acts and policies that caused mass \r\nstarvation and killed millions of people. \r\n Ukraine will continue to do its utmost to bring \r\nthe truth about Holodomor and the Holocaust to the \r\nworld at large. We believe that it is high time that the \r\ninternational community recognized that crime as an \r\nact of genocide against the Ukrainian nation. \r\n The memory of recent instances of genocide, \r\ncrimes against humanity and gross and flagrant \r\nviolations of human rights should never fade from our \r\nminds. Ukraine has therefore wholeheartedly supported \r\nand sponsored the draft resolution before us for \r\nadoption. \r\n We in Ukraine have done and will continue to do \r\neverything in our power to prevent the ideology of \r\ntotalitarianism, dictatorship, xenophobia and anti-\r\nSemitism from taking root in our national soil. \r\n My country is ready to assume its share of the \r\ncollective responsibility to stop ongoing tragedies and \r\nto prevent future crimes against humanity. The \r\nresponsibility to protect against genocide, as an \r\nimportant and promising outcome of the recent world \r\nsummit, should, in our view, be practically \r\nimplemented and further developed. \r\n Mr. Sardenberg (Brazil): The Jewish Holocaust \r\nis the paradigmatic case of genocide, a crime that until \r\nthat time lacked a definition and did not allow for legal \r\nrecourse. None of the Hague Conventions mentioned \r\ngenocide, nor could the massacres that had taken place \r\nbe properly judged or their perpetrators punished \r\nowing to the lack of a legal definition of genocide.  \r\n A/60/PV.42\r\n \r\n05-59019 7 \r\n \r\n Of particular historical resonance in our part of \r\nthe world are the crimes committed against the \r\nindigenous peoples of the Americas during the colonial \r\nperiod and during the period when slavery was \r\npractised. It remains profoundly shocking to the \r\nconscience of mankind that those crimes could have \r\nreached such inconceivable proportions. \r\n The profound impact of the Jewish Holocaust and \r\nof the mass war crimes committed during the Second \r\nWorld War prompted the international community to \r\nattempt, through this Organization, to define genocide \r\nas an international crime and to bring its perpetrators to \r\njustice. Thus, in 1948, the United Nations adopted the \r\nConvention on the Prevention and Punishment of the \r\nCrime of Genocide and, more recently, the crime was \r\nincorporated into the Rome Statute of the International \r\nCriminal Court. \r\n The fight against the crime of genocide will only \r\nbe complete when Member States adhere to and \r\nimplement human rights instruments in both the \r\ndomestic and the international spheres. That will \r\nconstitute the most important tribute to the memory of \r\nthe victims of the Holocaust and honour the \r\nRemembrance Day. \r\n In remembering the Holocaust, the international \r\ncommunity not only renews its indignation and \r\nrejection, but also strengthens its commitment to fight \r\noppression and prejudice wherever they may take \r\nplace. In evoking the torment and tragedy of the Jewish \r\npeople during the Holocaust, we are able to confront \r\nthe destructive forces that threaten the human march \r\ntowards freedom, justice and democracy. \r\n Even after the Jewish Holocaust, late twentieth \r\ncentury history has, unfortunately, been marked by a \r\nseries of brutal conflicts that have again resulted in \r\ngrave war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide \r\nand other serious crimes. Cambodia, the former \r\nYugoslavia and Rwanda constitute a few blatant \r\nexamples. They add to our sense of abhorrence and \r\nindignation and strengthen our resolve to prevent \r\nsimilar crimes. \r\n As one of the sponsors of the draft resolution, \r\nBrazil once again expresses its absolute condemnation \r\nof the Holocaust, reaffirms its great respect for the \r\nvictims and manifests its solidarity with the survivors \r\nof that unspeakable crime. \r\n Mr. Mayoral (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nArgentine Republic, whose best tradition has been to \r\nwelcome upon its territory communities from all \r\ncorners of the world to live in peaceful and productive \r\ncoexistence and which has itself suffered acts of \r\ncruelty against human dignity, co-sponsors draft \r\nresolution A/60/L.12 and supports that reminder, with \r\nspecial feelings of emotion and commitment to \r\nparticipate in this collective act by the international \r\ncommunity to ensure that humankind never again \r\nwitnesses the genocide we remember today. \r\n Collective remembrance is indispensable in a \r\nworld overwhelmed by the need to solve new problems \r\nand at a time when young people may think that the \r\nHolocaust was an event of history that occurred under \r\nspecific political circumstances and for reasons that no \r\nlonger exist. They are wrong. Faced with that possible \r\nreaction, we must realize that no country in the world \r\ncan consider itself immune from a future wave of \r\nviolence fuelled by intolerance, economics, religious \r\nfundamentalism, political intolerance or racial conflict, \r\nor even a combination of any of them. \r\n Therefore, we support the declaration of \r\n27 January as the International Day of Commemoration \r\nin memory of the victims of the Holocaust, as well as \r\nthe other measures proposed in the draft resolution, in \r\norder to keep the memory of that shameful episode in \r\nthe history of mankind, alive. \r\n The Holocaust showed us major truths that must \r\nnot be forgotten. First, the sacrifice of the Jewish \r\npeople, which is a tragic example of the harm that we, \r\nas human beings can inflict upon on another. It \r\ntranscends all cultural, political and religious \r\nboundaries and teaches a terrible and profound lesson \r\nto us all. Regrettably, racist anti-Semitism, in spite of \r\nso much that has been done to fight it, periodically \r\nreemerges in the infamous attacks that we see against \r\nsynagogues, the desecration of cemeteries and the \r\ncynical speculations of supposed historians who \r\nmodify or deny the events that occurred.  \r\n Those irrational acts that derive from fanatical \r\nideology, ignorance, denial and distrust of the other are \r\npart and parcel of the darkest aspects of the human \r\ncondition. In different situations and places they move \r\nto other communities and groups, which suffer their \r\nown share of shame, like the ones that this \r\nOrganization has been able to document in the very \r\nA/60/PV.42  \r\n \r\n8 05-59019 \r\n \r\nserious episodes that occurred in various regions of the \r\nworld not so long ago. \r\n In our modest understanding, the main thing we \r\nhave learned has been the obligation of all men and \r\nwomen to affirm the equality and essential fraternity of \r\neach person, despite different nationalities, cultures or \r\nreligious idiosyncrasies.  \r\n The United Nations was created to prevent war \r\nand resolve conflicts. It is therefore auspicious that the \r\nOrganization should establish an annual day of \r\nreflection, from now on, to commemorate the sixtieth \r\nanniversary of the destruction of the Nazi regime. It is \r\nprecisely through that framework that significant \r\nefforts over several decades have led to the creation of \r\nan edifice whose foundation is the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights and which has been \r\nfurther developed and strengthened through \r\ndeclarations and treaties that reinforce the conditions \r\nnecessary for the achievement of universal respect for \r\nhuman dignity.  \r\n The International Criminal Court (ICC) began to \r\nfunction not long ago, seeking to deter possible crimes \r\nand punish those who attempt to escape their grave \r\nresponsibilities.  \r\n We are in a crucial moment of history when we \r\nare all called upon to make further efforts of generosity \r\nin order to face up to new challenges and threats to a \r\nfuture of peace based upon respect for all persons and \r\npeoples. My country believes that task must be carried \r\nout within the collective framework of the United \r\nNations. If we want to avoid repeating the cycle of \r\nhistory and avoid another Holocaust and genocide such \r\nas occurred in the last century, we must keep alive the \r\nmemory of what happened, by giving the United \r\nNations powerful tools to effectively protect human \r\nrights in all circumstances and at all times. \r\n We are convinced that this day will motivate calm \r\nreflection as we address the future together, aware of \r\nour historic responsibilities to design a fairer and more \r\npeaceful world that will save mankind from further \r\nsuffering and will prevent a recurrence of the collective \r\ntragedies that we remember today.  \r\n The President returned to the Chair. \r\n Mr. Pfanzelter (Austria): Austria attaches great \r\nsignificance to the draft resolution on Holocaust \r\nremembrance and is honoured to be among its earliest \r\nsponsors. The designation of 27 January, the day of \r\nliberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp, as an \r\nannual International Day of Commemoration in \r\nmemory of the victims of the Holocaust is of special \r\nsignificance to all of us. Auschwitz is of global \r\nrelevance.  \r\n For Austria, this day is a reminder of the dark \r\nsides of our past. We feel the agony of knowing that \r\nour country lost so many of its Jewish citizens to the \r\nHolocaust. At the same time we feel the pain of \r\nrealizing that far too many Austrians took part in the \r\ngenocide, a crime of colossal proportions.  \r\n Simon Wiesenthal, who passed away a few weeks \r\nago, helped us to come to terms with our past when he \r\nsaid, “For your benefit, learn from our tragedy”. He \r\nshowed us that education and information are powerful \r\ntools for preventing the tragic repetition of history. \r\nToday, we should all remember Simon Wiesenthal’s \r\nspeech to the General Assembly 10 years ago (see \r\nA/50/PV.66). He called upon the international \r\ncommunity to warn younger generations against \r\nprejudices, especially the prejudice of racial hatred, \r\nwhich has led to immeasurable human suffering. \r\nAustria is conscious of its responsibility and is taking a \r\nbroad spectrum of measures to fight anti-Semitism, \r\nxenophobia and other forms racism and intolerance at \r\nall levels. \r\n We have successfully initiated national \r\nprogrammes aimed at teaching our young people about \r\nthe lessons of history. The young generation, \r\nrepresenting our future, must be taught that no country \r\nand no society can achieve any degree of progress or \r\ndevelopment without respect for human rights and the \r\ndignity of each human being. That is the lesson that the \r\nmemory of Auschwitz hands down from generation to \r\ngeneration. \r\n The International Day of Commemoration in \r\nMemory of the Victims of the Holocaust should serve \r\nto make us aware of what we lost and what was \r\ndestroyed. Our challenge for the future will be to \r\npreserve the memory of the millions killed in \r\nAuschwitz and elsewhere by an inhuman regime and to \r\nmake sure that it will never happen again. Our common \r\nchallenge is to create a more just and more democratic \r\nsociety that is free of hatred. \r\n The President: I now call on the Permanent \r\nObserver of the Observer State of the Holy See. \r\n A/60/PV.42\r\n \r\n05-59019 9 \r\n \r\n Archbishop Migliore (Holy See): Remembering \r\nis a duty and a common responsibility. That is \r\nespecially true in the case of the Holocaust. So, my \r\ndelegation welcomes the draft resolution on Holocaust \r\nremembrance and congratulates all those that \r\nsponsored it. \r\n The responsibility of all nations to remember \r\ngains new strength as we commemorate the sixtieth \r\nanniversary of the liberation of the extermination \r\ncamps and the establishment of the United Nations. \r\n For 60 years, we have had the horror of this kind \r\nof crime before us, and yet, history has repeated itself. \r\nAn international convention against that crime has not \r\nprevented the kind of thinking that leads to genocide, \r\nthe violence that sparks genocide, the injustices that \r\nmake it possible or the interests that allow a genocide \r\nto be sustained over time. The twentieth century \r\nwitnessed genocides, atrocities, mass killings and \r\nethnic cleansings, which, deplorably, were not confined \r\nto just one continent. As we stand before the \r\nHolocaust, it is only right that we remember and \r\npledge to make the best collective efforts to ensure \r\nthat, having now named this crime, the world’s nations \r\nwill recognize it for what it is and prevent it in the \r\nfuture. \r\n In that context, we would do well to recall and \r\nrenew our support for Security Council resolution 1624 \r\n(2005), which condemns the incitement of terrorist acts \r\nin the strongest terms and repudiates attempts at the \r\njustification or glorification of terrorist acts, as they \r\nmay incite further terrorist acts. It further emphasizes \r\nthe continuing international efforts to enhance dialogue \r\nand broaden understanding among civilizations, in an \r\neffort to prevent the indiscriminate targeting of \r\ndifferent religions and cultures and to address \r\nunresolved regional conflicts and the full range of \r\nglobal issues. \r\n After the Shoah, the first step towards prevention \r\nwas the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Many \r\nmore steps forward are needed. In every country, the \r\nmemory of the Holocaust must be preserved as a \r\ncommitment to spare future generations such horror. \r\n During his visit to the Holy Land, the late Pope \r\nJohn Paul II made a point of going to Yad Vashem, the \r\nmemorial to the Shoah. At the foot of the Temple’s \r\nWestern Wall he prayed for forgiveness and for the \r\nconversion of hearts and minds. \r\n Asking for pardon purifies the memory, and \r\nremembering the Holocaust gives us an occasion for \r\nthat purification of memory to occur. We can detect \r\nearly symptoms of genocide, reject them and take \r\ntimely, firm measures to overcome social and \r\ninternational injustices of all kinds. \r\n The President: The Assembly will now take a \r\ndecision on draft resolution A/60/L.12. \r\n The following countries are to be added to the list \r\nof sponsors: Azerbaijan, Congo, Mali, Papua New \r\nGuinea, Philippines and Saint Kitts and Nevis. \r\n May I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt \r\nthe draft resolution without a vote? \r\n The draft resolution was adopted (resolution 60/7). \r\n The President: Before giving the floor to \r\nspeakers in explanation of vote after the vote, may I \r\nremind delegations that explanations of vote are \r\nlimited to 10 minutes and should be made by \r\ndelegations from their seats. \r\n Mrs. Núñez de Odremán (Bolivarian Republic \r\nof Venezuela) (spoke in Spanish): The Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela has participated in the adoption \r\nby consensus of resolution 60/7 and is in full \r\nagreement with the States that sponsored the resolution \r\nand endorsed the memorandum of explanation \r\naccompanying the draft resolution, which affirmed that \r\nthe Holocaust constituted a systematic and barbaric \r\nattempt to annihilate an entire people in a manner and \r\nof a magnitude that has no comparison in the history of \r\nhumankind. \r\n Nevertheless, moderation, restraint and respect \r\nfor truth should guide us, when speaking of the \r\nannihilation of a people in the manner and of the \r\nmagnitude of that which took place in the so-called \r\nSecond World War, which was the historical context of \r\nthe Holocaust. We must also recall other holocausts \r\nthat also took place during that terrible and barbarous \r\nconflict and those which came to light at that conflict’s \r\nend, all equally attributable to founding States of the \r\nUnited Nations that were part of the coalition that \r\ndefeated the Nazi Fascism exclusively at the military \r\nlevel around the year 1945. \r\n We are referring to the annihilation of the \r\ndefenceless population of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, \r\nwho were victims of a deliberate, devastating \r\ndestruction by the use  of nuclear weapons, without \r\nA/60/PV.42  \r\n \r\n10 05-59019 \r\n \r\nany justification, and to the silent, low-intensity daily \r\nannihilation of peoples of the world, whose adults and \r\nchildren are condemned to misery, hunger, ignorance \r\nand repression with no escape or hope, as a result of \r\nthe exploitation and the barbarous, systematic neglect \r\nto which they have been submitted during centuries by \r\ncolonialist and imperialist States and elites that were \r\nalso the principal actors of the aforementioned war. \r\nThe annihilation continues today, at the start of the \r\ntwenty-first century, giving rise to a popular \r\ninsurgency that seeks to restore justice. \r\n Nor can we forget that the States that participated \r\nin the same world conflict or in conflicts that have \r\noccurred since 1945 are responsible for acts of State \r\nterrorism in the form of successive holocausts — that \r\nis, the systematic genocide of the peoples of Asia, \r\nAfrica and Latin America. We must incorporate that \r\nfact into our collective memory as Members of the \r\nUnited Nations, inspired by the same humanistic \r\nfeelings that the resolution embodies in one of its \r\npreambular paragraphs, so that we do not forget the \r\nfundamental principle of the Charter to protect future \r\ngenerations from the scourge of war. \r\n We all know that there are many ways to wage \r\nwar, some of them novel. There are low-and high-\r\nintensity wars, which make use of weapons of \r\nimmediate destruction, or more subtle, less apparent \r\nmeans of mass liquidation. \r\n The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela also shares \r\nthe concern and sense of urgency with regard to \r\nestablishing educational programmes to eradicate from \r\nthe face of the Earth genocide as a political act to \r\nexterminate groups of human beings or entire peoples \r\non the unspeakable pretext of hatred, racism and the \r\nfundamentalist, obsessive and messianic blindness that \r\ncharacterizes religious intolerance. We call upon those \r\nStates that, together with us, supported the resolution \r\nto ensure that the educational programmes proposed \r\ntherein are designed, in a balanced and well-thought-\r\nout manner, to put an end to holocausts and to raise \r\nglobal awareness of the perversion and crime against \r\nhumanity that is genocide — including the genocide of \r\nthe Jewish people, which deserves universal \r\nrepudiation. \r\n Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt): Having joined the \r\nconsensus to adopt the resolution without a vote, my \r\ndelegation would like to express its reservations with \r\nregard to operative paragraphs 2 and 6, as well as to \r\nsome of the procedural aspects surrounding its \r\nadoption. \r\n We fully share and understand the feelings of the \r\nsponsors with regard to the need for Holocaust \r\nremembrance. We have no objection to designating \r\n27 January as a day of remembrance in connection with \r\nthe Holocaust because of our firm belief that the \r\nvictims of genocide, regardless of their religion or \r\nethnic background, should not be forgotten. \r\n On the other hand, the resolution fails to address \r\nthe responsibilities of the society in which the \r\nHolocaust was perpetrated and its socio-political and \r\nracist causes. Furthermore, we should ask ourselves \r\nwhy we should restrict the resolution on the Holocaust, \r\nforgetting similar crimes of genocide against Christians \r\nand Muslims in Rwanda, and against Muslims in \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Srebrenica, Sanski Most, \r\nKosovo and elsewhere. \r\n Why are we establishing a special international \r\nprogramme to promote awareness of the Holocaust — \r\nwhich represented a heinous and horrible crime against \r\nthe Jews — while forgetting equal atrocities against \r\nMuslims, Christians and others, and refraining from \r\nestablishing similar programmes to increase public \r\nawareness of them? We believe that no one should \r\nhave a monopoly on suffering. \r\n We are firm in our belief that the established \r\nmechanism, in accordance with the resolution, should \r\napply to the victims of genocide as a whole, \r\nworldwide, without discrimination on the basis of \r\nreligious or ethnic background. We trust that the \r\nsponsors will consider our strong reservations and \r\nreflect on how to put things back into the right \r\nperspective. We reserve the right to do so ourselves. \r\n We further trust that the General Assembly and \r\nthe Secretary-General, while establishing the proposed \r\noutreach programme, as well as other mechanisms \r\nprovided for in the resolution, will attach equal \r\nimportance to the implementation of other resolutions \r\non similar issues, such as racism, intolerance, the rise \r\nof ultra-nationalism, neo-Naziism and xenophobic and \r\nother movements. We further trust that the General \r\nAssembly will attach the same importance to financing \r\nother activities in similar resolutions in full. In that \r\ncontext, we reserve the right to assist in the \r\nimplementation of such resolutions all together, so as \r\nto ensure equal treatment for all victims of genocide, \r\nincluding the victims of the Holocaust, and the right to \r\n A/60/PV.42\r\n \r\n05-59019 11 \r\n \r\ndecide our course of action with regard to the \r\nresolution in the future accordingly. \r\n Ms. Ismail (Malaysia): My delegation joined the \r\nconsensus on the resolution on Holocaust \r\nremembrance. We condemn the Holocaust, as it \r\nconstituted a systematic and barbarous attempt to \r\nannihilate an entire people in a manner and on a scale \r\nthat have no parallel in human history. Yet its lessons \r\nare universal, and my delegation feels that we should \r\ndraw on them. There are other events that are no less \r\ntragic which would benefit from the lessons learned \r\nfrom the Holocaust.  \r\n In this connection, my delegation would have \r\npreferred operative paragraph 2 of the resolution to be \r\nbroader in scope so as to include inculcating in future \r\ngenerations the lessons not only of the Holocaust, but \r\nalso other acts of genocide, war crimes, ethnic \r\ncleansing and crimes against humanity. \r\n Mr. Anshor (Indonesia): I am pleased to explain \r\nmy delegation’s position with regard to the resolution \r\nthat has just been adopted. My delegation went along \r\nwith its adoption on the basis of a number of \r\nunderstandings.  \r\n First, we recognize that the Holocaust represents \r\na dark episode in human civilization, whose lessons \r\nmust never be forgotten if we are to save future \r\ngenerations from similar atrocities. However, the \r\nHolocaust is not the only human tragedy that provides \r\nsuch lessons. There are numerous others that send an \r\nequally strong message and warning to all people of \r\nthe dangers of hatred, bigotry, racism and prejudice. \r\nHuman history, whether classical or contemporary, \r\nregisters a long list of human tragedies. Therefore, we \r\nwould have preferred it if the sponsors, in formalizing \r\nand institutionalizing Holocaust remembrance and \r\neducation within the United Nations system through \r\nthe resolution, had given equal attention to other \r\nhuman tragedies. \r\n The President: We have heard the last speaker in \r\nexplanation of vote on the draft resolution just adopted. \r\n The representative of Japan has asked to speak in \r\nexercise of the right of reply. May I remind \r\nrepresentatives that statements in exercise of the right \r\nof reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first \r\nintervention and to five minutes for the second \r\nintervention, and should be made by delegations from \r\ntheir seats. \r\n Mr. Ozawa (Japan): My delegation wishes to \r\nexercise its right reply in connection with the statement \r\nmade by the representative of China regarding \r\natrocities during the Second World War in Asia. \r\nMistakes made in our past history must be \r\nremembered. We must learn from them and resolve \r\nnever to allow them to happen again. Only by learning \r\nfrom the past can humanity make progress in the \r\nfuture.  \r\n Japan has made its own mistakes in its recent \r\nhistory. On the occasion of the recent Asia-Africa \r\nsummit in Indonesia, Prime Minister Koizumi stated,  \r\n “In the past, Japan, through its colonial rule \r\nand aggression, caused tremendous damage and \r\nsuffering to the people of many countries, \r\nparticularly to those of Asian nations. Japan \r\nsquarely faces those facts of history in a spirit of \r\nhumility. And with a feeling of deep remorse and \r\nheartfelt apology always engraved in mind, Japan \r\nhas resolutely and consistently maintained since \r\nthe end of the Second World War never to turn \r\ninto a military power but to be an economic \r\npower and its principle of resolving all matters by \r\npeaceful means without recourse to the use of \r\nforce. \r\n “Japan once again states its resolve to \r\ncontribute to the peace and the prosperity of the \r\nworld, in the future as well, prizing the \r\nrelationship of trust it enjoys with the nations of \r\nthe world.” \r\n In that spirit, the Japanese people, since the end \r\nof the Second World War, have striven to rebuild our \r\nnation as a free, democratic and peace-loving nation. \r\nMy delegation wishes to point out that in discussing \r\nhistory, it would be more constructive to have a \r\ncommon understanding of the historical facts, \r\nespecially of the figures involved. In that spirit, the \r\nForeign Minister of Japan has proposed to the Foreign \r\nMinister of China to conduct joint academic research. \r\n Mr. Gillerman (Israel): At this unique and \r\nhistoric moment, I would like to extend Israel’s special \r\nappreciation and thanks to the general membership of \r\nthe Assembly for adopting this unprecedented \r\nresolution and to the original sponsors, Australia, \r\nCanada, Russia and the United States. The active \r\nsupport of the European Union, led by the United \r\nKingdom presidency from the outset of the process, \r\nA/60/PV.42  \r\n \r\n12 05-59019 \r\n \r\nhas also been invaluable. I would also like to thank the \r\n104 sponsors of the resolution. \r\n I wish to extend my thanks to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his ongoing support and to Under-\r\nSecretary-General Shashi Tharoor for his interest and \r\ninvolvement in the matter. And I would like to thank \r\nyou, Sir, in your role as President of the General \r\nAssembly, for your guidance, compassion and \r\nleadership throughout this process and during this \r\nhistoric debate. \r\n Finally, in memory of the 6 million Holocaust \r\nvictims and in honour of the survivors, I give thanks \r\nfor this universal and historic resolution and its \r\nadoption by the Assembly, citing the words of the \r\nJewish prayer: Blessed be the Lord who has given us \r\nlife, sustained us and brought us to this day. \r\n The President: In view of the explanations of \r\nvote after the vote and the statements in right of reply, \r\nI just want to repeat portions of my remarks at the 41st \r\nmeeting, on the introduction of the resolution — the \r\nfirst resolution of this kind. \r\n “The Holocaust also reminds us of the \r\ncrimes of genocide committed since the Second \r\nWorld War. It must therefore be a unifying \r\nhistoric warning around which we rally, not only \r\nto recall the grievous crimes committed in human \r\nhistory but also to reaffirm our unfaltering \r\nresolve to prevent the recurrence of such crimes. \r\nWe cannot, after the horrors in Cambodia, \r\nRwanda and Srebrenica, continue to repeat, \r\n‘Never again’.  \r\n “... \r\n “It is in the spirit both of remembering the \r\ncrimes of the past and preventing their recurrence \r\nin the future that we must consider the ... \r\nresolution on Holocaust remembrance.” \r\n The General Assembly has thus concluded this \r\nstage of its consideration of agenda item 72. \r\n The meeting rose at 10.55 a.m. \r\n"
