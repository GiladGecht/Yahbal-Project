(Sweden)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 9.30 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 112\r\nElections to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs\r\nand other elections:\r\n(a) Election of twenty members of the Committee\r\nfor Programme and Coordination\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/50/216)\r\nThe President: I welcome you this morning. I\r\nknow our friends of the Islamic faith are looking\r\nforward to this evening and I am particularly grateful\r\nfor the cookies that were placed on the President’s\r\nchair by the Syrian delegation.\r\nPursuant to General Assembly decision 42/450 of\r\n17 December 1987 and upon the nomination by the\r\nEconomic and Social Council, the Assembly elects the\r\nmembers of the Committee for Programme and\r\nCoordination.\r\nThe document before the Assembly contains the\r\nnominations by the Economic and Social Council to fill\r\nthe vacancies in the Committee that will occur as a\r\nresult of the expiration, on 31 December 2005, of the\r\nterms of office of Argentina, Armenia, Benin, Brazil,\r\nCanada, the Central African Republic, Cuba, Gabon,\r\nGermany, India, Indonesia, the Islamic Republic of\r\nIran, Monaco, Nicaragua, Pakistan, the Republic of\r\nMoldova, South Africa, Switzerland, Ukraine and the\r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\r\nThose States are eligible for immediate re-election.\r\nI should like to remind Members that, after 1\r\nJanuary 2006, the following States will still be\r\nmembers of the Committee: Algeria, the Bahamas,\r\nChina, the Comoros, France, Ghana, Jamaica, Japan,\r\nKenya, Mexico, the Republic of Korea, the Russian\r\nFederation, the United States of America and\r\nZimbabwe. Therefore, those 14 States are not eligible\r\nto run in this election.\r\nI should now like to inform Members that the\r\nfollowing States have been nominated by the Economic\r\nand Social Council.\r\nThe four African States for four vacancies are:\r\nBenin, the Central African Republic, Senegal and\r\nSouth Africa. The four Asian States for four vacancies\r\nare: India, Indonesia, the Islamic Republic of Iran and\r\nPakistan. The three Eastern European States for three\r\nvacancies are: Armenia, Belarus and Bulgaria. The\r\nfour Latin American and Caribbean States for four\r\nvacancies are: Argentina, Brazil, Cuba and Uruguay.\r\nThe three Western European and other States for five\r\nvacancies are: Italy, Portugal and Switzerland. The\r\nCouncil postponed the nomination of the two\r\nremaining States to a later date.\r\nIn accordance with rule 92 of the rules of\r\nprocedure, all elections should be held by secret ballot\r\nand there shall be no nominations. However, I should\r\nlike to recall paragraph 16 of General Assembly\r\ndecision 34/401, whereby the practice of dispensing\r\n2\r\nA/60/PV.43\r\nwith the secret ballot for elections to subsidiary organs,\r\nwhen the number of candidates corresponds to the\r\nnumber of seats to be filled, should become standard,\r\nunless a delegation specifically requests a vote on a\r\ngiven election.\r\nIn the absence of such a request, and I see no\r\nindication of such in the Hall, may I take it that the\r\nAssembly decides to proceed to the election on the\r\nbasis of dispensing with the secret ballot?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: The number of States nominated\r\nfrom among the African States, the Asian States, the\r\nEastern European States, the Latin American and\r\nCaribbean States and the Western European and other\r\nStates is equal to or does not exceed the number of\r\nseats to be filled in each of those groups.\r\nMay I, therefore, take it that the Assembly wishes\r\nto declare those States nominated by the Council from\r\namong the African States, the Asian States, the Eastern\r\nEuropean States, the Latin American and Caribbean\r\nStates and the Western European and other States,\r\nnamely: Argentina, Armenia, Belarus, Benin, Brazil,\r\nBulgaria, the Central African Republic, Cuba, India,\r\nIndonesia, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Italy, Pakistan,\r\nPortugal, Senegal, South Africa, Switzerland and\r\nUruguay, elected members of the Committee for\r\nProgramme and Coordination for a three-year term of\r\noffice beginning on 1 January 2006?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I congratulate the 18 States that\r\nhave been elected members of the Committee for\r\nProgramme and Coordination. Regarding the two\r\nremaining vacancies from among the Western\r\nEuropean and other States, the General Assembly will\r\nbe in a position to act on them upon the nomination by\r\nthe Economic and Social Council of two Member\r\nStates from that region.\r\nWe have thus concluded this stage of our\r\nconsideration of sub-item (a) of agenda item 112.\r\n(b) Election of twenty-nine members to the\r\nGovernment Council of the United Nations\r\nEnvironment Programme\r\nThe President: Pursuant to General Assembly\r\nresolution 2997 (XXVII) of 15 December 1972 and\r\nAssembly decision 43/406 of 24 October 1988, the\r\nAssembly will proceed to the election of 29 members\r\nof the Governing Council of the United Nations\r\nEnvironment Programme to replace those members\r\nwhose term of office expires on 31 December 2005.\r\nThe 29 outgoing members are Antigua and\r\nBarbuda, Argentina, Belgium, Canada, Chad, China,\r\nthe Congo, Cuba, the Czech Republic, France,\r\nGermany, Greece, Indonesia, Japan, Kenya, Myanmar,\r\nNamibia, Nicaragua, Nigeria, the Republic of Korea,\r\nRomania, the Russian Federation, the Sudan,\r\nSwitzerland, the Syrian Arab Republic, the United\r\nStates of America, Uruguay, Zambia and Zimbabwe.\r\nThose States are eligible for immediate re-\r\nelection.\r\nI should like to remind members that, after 1\r\nJanuary 2006, the following States will still be\r\nmembers of the Governing Council: the Bahamas,\r\nBangladesh, Brazil, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso,\r\nCameroon, Cape Verde, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ghana,\r\nHungary, India, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Israel,\r\nKazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mexico, Monaco, Morocco,\r\nthe Netherlands, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Senegal,\r\nSomalia, Sweden, Turkey, Tuvalu, the United Kingdom\r\nof Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United\r\nRepublic of Tanzania.\r\nTherefore, those 29 States are not eligible in this\r\nelection.\r\nAs members know, in accordance with rule 92 of\r\nthe rules of procedure, all elections shall be held by\r\nsecret ballot and there shall be no nominations.\r\nHowever, I should like to recall paragraph 16 of\r\nGeneral Assembly decision 34/401, whereby the\r\npractice of dispensing with the secret ballot for\r\nelections to subsidiary organs when the number of\r\ncandidates corresponds to the number of seats to be\r\nfilled should become standard, unless a delegation\r\nspecifically requests a vote on a given election.\r\nIn the absence of such a request, may I take it that\r\nthe Assembly decides to proceed to the election on that\r\nbasis?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: Regarding candidatures, I have\r\nbeen informed by the Chairmen of the regional groups\r\nthat for the eight seats from the Group of African\r\nStates, the eight endorsed candidates are Algeria,\r\n3\r\nA/60/PV.43\r\nAngola, Botswana, Burundi, the Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo, Kenya, South Africa and Uganda.\r\nFor the six seats from the Group of Asian States,\r\nthe six endorsed candidates are China, Indonesia,\r\nJapan, Pakistan, the Republic of Korea and Thailand.\r\nFor the three seats from the Group of Eastern\r\nEuropean States, the three endorsed candidates are the\r\nCzech Republic, Romania and the Russian Federation.\r\nFor the five seats from the Group of Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean States, the five endorsed\r\ncandidates are Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Chile,\r\nHaiti and Uruguay.\r\nFor the seven seats from the Group of Western\r\nEuropean and other States, the seven endorsed\r\ncandidates are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada,\r\nFrance, Germany and the United States of America.\r\nSince the number of candidates endorsed by the\r\nAfrican States, the Asian States, the Eastern European\r\nStates, the Latin American and Caribbean States and\r\nthe Western European and other States corresponds to\r\nthe number of seats to be filled in each region, may I\r\ntake it that the General Assembly decides to elect those\r\ncandidates as members of the Governing Council of the\r\nUnited Nations Environment Programme for a four-\r\nyear term of office beginning on 1 January 2006? I see\r\nno objection.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: The following 29 States have\r\nthus been elected members of the Governing Council\r\nof the United Nations Environment Programme for a\r\nfour-year term of office beginning on 1 January 2006:\r\nAlgeria, Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina,\r\nAustralia, Austria, Belgium, Botswana, Burundi,\r\nCanada, Chile, China, the Czech Republic, the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, France, Germany,\r\nHaiti, Indonesia, Japan, Kenya, Pakistan, the Republic\r\nof Korea, Romania, the Russian Federation, South\r\nAfrica, Thailand, Uganda, the United States of\r\nAmerica and Uruguay.\r\nI congratulate the States which have been elected\r\nmembers of the Governing Council of the United\r\nNations Environment Programme.\r\nThis concludes our consideration of sub-item (b)\r\nof agenda item 112.\r\nAgenda item 115\r\nImplementation of the resolutions of the United\r\nNations\r\nThe President: It is my understanding that there\r\nis no request to consider agenda item 115 at the current\r\nsession.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the General\r\nAssembly to defer consideration of the item to the\r\nsixty-first session and to include it in the provisional\r\nagenda of the sixty-first session?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: This concludes our consideration\r\nof agenda item 115.\r\nAgenda item 113\r\nAppointments to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs\r\nand other appointments\r\n(f) Appointment of members of the Committee on\r\nConferences\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/60/106)\r\nThe President: As indicated in document\r\nA/60/106, since the terms of office of Bolivia, the\r\nCongo, France, India, Japan, the Russian Federation\r\nand Zambia will expire on 31 December 2005, it will\r\nbe necessary for the President of the General Assembly\r\nto appoint, during the current session, seven members\r\nto fill the resulting vacancies. The members so\r\nappointed will serve for a period of three years,\r\nbeginning on 1 January 2006.\r\nAfter consultations with the Chairmen of the\r\ngroups of African States, Asian States, Eastern\r\nEuropean States, Latin American and Caribbean States\r\nand Western European and other States, I have\r\nappointed Burundi, El Salvador, France, Lesotho,\r\nMalaysia, the Philippines and the Russian Federation\r\nas members of the Committee on Conferences for a\r\nperiod of three years, beginning on 1 January 2006.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly takes note of\r\nthese appointments?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: We have thus concluded our\r\nconsideration of sub-item (f) of agenda item 113.\r\n4\r\nA/60/PV.43\r\nAgenda item 48\r\nSport for peace and development\r\n(a) Building a peaceful and better world through\r\nsport and the Olympic ideal\r\nDraft resolution (A/60/L.15)\r\n(b) International Year of Sport and Physical\r\nEducation\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/60/217)\r\nDraft resolution (A/60/L.7)\r\nThe President: As a fan of sports and a believer\r\nin sport as a unifying force in international relations, I\r\nam pleased that today the General Assembly is taking\r\naction on agenda item 48, entitled “Sport for peace and\r\ndevelopment”, which includes sub-item (a), “Building\r\na peaceful and better world through sport and the\r\nOlympic ideal”, and sub-item (b), “International Year\r\nof Sport and Physical Education”.\r\nAs overall guidance for today’s debate, I call the\r\nattention of members to the outcome document\r\n(resolution 60/1) of the September world summit,\r\nwhich, in its paragraph 145, declares,\r\n“We underline that sports can foster peace\r\nand development and can contribute to an\r\natmosphere of tolerance and understanding, and\r\nwe encourage discussions in the General\r\nAssembly for proposals leading to a plan of\r\naction on sport and development”.\r\nOur deliberations should also be inspired by the report\r\nof the Secretary-General entitled “Sport for peace and\r\ndevelopment: International Year of Sport and Physical\r\nEducation” (A/60/217).\r\nTurning to the first sub-item, I wish to recall that\r\nthe General Assembly has for more than a decade\r\nsupported the revival of the ancient Greek tradition of\r\nthe Olympic Truce. As we approach the XX Olympic\r\nWinter Games, to be held in Turin, Italy, in February\r\n2006, we should once again remind ourselves of the\r\npurpose of the Olympic Truce: to encourage a peaceful\r\nenvironment during the Games, to ensure safe passage\r\nfor athletes and others at the Games and to mobilize\r\nthe world’s young people around the cause of peace.\r\nWith regard to this topic, Italy has submitted a\r\ndraft resolution (A/60/L.15) on building a peaceful and\r\nbetter world through sport and the Olympic ideal. I\r\nwelcome the universal support it has received.\r\nConcerning the other sub-item, I wish to salute\r\nall those around the world who have helped to make\r\nthe International Year of Sport and Physical Education\r\na success, including United Nations offices, agencies,\r\nfunds and programmes, Governments, the Olympic\r\nmovement, sports federations, sports teams, sports\r\norganizations and other non-governmental\r\norganizations, sports stars and the countless athletes\r\nand other individuals who have joined in activities\r\nmarking the Year. Yesterday, I met the marathon gold-\r\nmedal winner Tegla Loroupe and was inspired by her\r\nefforts and those of the Olympic Committee to advance\r\nsports as a uniting force in international relations.\r\nAs the report of the Secretary-General indicates,\r\nsport can play a significant role in accelerating\r\nprogress towards the achievement of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. The International Year of Sport\r\nand Physical Education has highlighted that\r\ncontribution and adds strong impetus to efforts to\r\nbetter integrate sport into the development agenda.\r\nSport is essential for the well-being of young\r\npeople in refugee camps, for example, not only to\r\npromote health and education, but also as a vehicle for\r\nalerting them to the risks of HIV/AIDS, for instilling\r\nself-respect and teamwork and for encouraging\r\ntolerance and peace. Peace is also recognized as a key\r\nin the promotion of equality and advancement for\r\nwomen and girls, especially when combined with\r\neducation initiatives that give them the opportunity to\r\nbuild self-confidence and encouraging them to stay in\r\nschool.\r\nWith regard to this sub-item, Tunisia has\r\nsubmitted a draft resolution (A/60/L.7) on sport as a\r\nmeans of promoting education, health, development\r\nand peace in order to follow up on the\r\nrecommendations of the Secretary-General.\r\nI now give the floor to the representative of Italy\r\nto introduce draft resolution A/60/L.15.\r\nMr. Mantovani (Italy): At the outset, I want to\r\napologize on behalf of our Deputy Foreign Minister,\r\nwho was unable to come to New York owing to\r\nunforeseen circumstances.\r\n5\r\nA/60/PV.43\r\nThis year, Italy, as host country of the 2006\r\nWinter Olympic Games in Turin, has the honour to\r\npresent draft resolution on the Olympic Truce\r\n(A/60/L.15). I am proud to announce that, with the\r\nadded sponsorship of Kiribati, this year’s draft\r\nresolution has attracted a record number of sponsors:\r\n191. There could be no clearer statement of universal\r\nsupport for the principles affirmed in the text.\r\nThe draft resolution on the Olympic Truce is an\r\ninitiative that was first taken by the General Assembly\r\nin 1993, after an appeal by the International Olympic\r\nCommittee had allowed athletes of war-torn Yugoslavia\r\nto participate in the 1992 Barcelona Summer Games.\r\nAs we all know, the Olympic Truce is rooted in the\r\ntraditions of the classical Olympic games. In ancient\r\nGreece, the Olympic Truce, or ekecheiria, provided for\r\na cessation of hostilities to allow athletes, pilgrims and\r\nspectators to reach Olympia in order to participate in or\r\nwatch the games and, upon their conclusion, return\r\nhome in full security.\r\nIt is therefore a very fortunate coincidence —\r\nwhich is not without symbolic significance — that\r\nItaly, in presenting the draft resolution on the Olympic\r\nTruce, comes immediately after Greece, which in 2003\r\nassumed a similar responsibility as host country of the\r\n2004 Athens Olympic Games. There is another happy\r\ncoincidence in the fact that the General Assembly, by\r\nits resolution 58/5 of 3 November 2003, proclaimed\r\n2005 as the International Year of Sport and Physical\r\nEducation, which leads us to trust in the heartfelt\r\ncommitment of all Member States to the Olympic\r\nTruce and the relationship among sport, peace and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn that regard, I welcome and support the draft\r\nresolution to be introduced by Tunisia, entitled “Sport\r\nas a means to promote education, health, development\r\nand peace” (A/60/L.7*). The Italian Government is also\r\nparticularly glad to welcome the joint initiative\r\nbetween the Organizing Committee of the Winter\r\nOlympic Games in Turin and UNICEF Italy to work\r\ntogether so that the Olympic Truce can benefit all\r\nchildren around the world.\r\nI should now like to briefly illustrate the contents\r\nof the draft resolution that the Assembly is, I hope,\r\nabout to adopt with the unanimous support of its\r\nmembers. The text, entitled “Building a peaceful and\r\nbetter world through sport and the Olympic ideal”,\r\nrecalls previous General Assembly resolutions and\r\nrefers to the Millennium Declaration adopted in 2000,\r\nwhich contains an appeal to observe the Olympic\r\nTruce. In addition, the draft resolution salutes the joint\r\nefforts of the International Olympic Committee and the\r\nUnited Nations in the areas of human development,\r\npoverty reduction, humanitarian assistance, health\r\npromotion, HIV/AIDS prevention, combating malaria,\r\ntuberculosis and other infectious diseases, basic\r\neducation, equal opportunity and environmental\r\nprotection.\r\nThe draft resolution recognizes the importance of\r\nthe role of sports in pursuing the development goals\r\nagreed to at the international level, including those\r\ncontained in the Millennium Declaration, and reaffirms\r\nthe commitments assumed in that regard by the heads\r\nof State or Government at the High-level Plenary\r\nMeeting held in New York in September. Reaffirming\r\nthe principles of mutual understanding, friendship,\r\nsolidarity and justice that underlie the Olympic ideal,\r\nthe draft resolution requests United Nations Member\r\nStates to observe the Olympic Truce on the occasion of\r\nthe XX Winter Olympic Games, which will take place\r\nin Turin from 10 to 26 February 2006, and the\r\nsubsequent Paralympic Games, which will take place\r\nalso in Turin from 10 to 19 March 2006.\r\nIt also welcomes the decision of the International\r\nOlympic Committee to mobilize world sports\r\norganizations and national Olympics committees\r\naround the goal of taking concrete measures to promote\r\na culture of peace at the local, national, regional and\r\nworld level. The draft resolution, finally, requests the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations to promote\r\nobservance of the Olympic truce among Member States\r\nand appeals to them to cooperate with the International\r\nOlympic Committee and the United Nations agencies\r\nand programmes involved, to use the Olympic truce as\r\nan occasion to promote peace during and after the\r\nperiod of the Games and to implement projects that\r\nhighlight sports as an instrument of development.\r\nSince ancient times, the idea of the Olympic\r\nGames has been closely associated with that of peace.\r\nThe spirit of this draft resolution is true to that origin,\r\nalthough it has been updated to correspond to the more\r\npressing needs of today’s world, in view of maintaining\r\npeace, promoting development, fostering dialogue,\r\ncooperation and a better and deeper understanding\r\namong and between different cultures and civilizations.\r\n6\r\nA/60/PV.43\r\nThe ancient tradition of the Olympic truce is the\r\nexpression today of humanity’s desire to build a world\r\nbased on the rules of fair competition, humanity,\r\nreconciliation and tolerance. For my country, hosting\r\nthe Olympics once again and appealing to the world to\r\nobserve the Olympic Truce are both an honour and a\r\nresponsibility. But the success of a global event such as\r\nthe Olympics and the achievement of a global objective\r\nsuch as the Olympic Truce depend essentially on the\r\nheartfelt and harmonious support of the international\r\ncommunity as a whole. Today, we all have the\r\nopportunity to give tangible expression to this support.\r\nMr. Hachani (Tunisia) (spoke in French): Sir,\r\nbefore discussing agenda item 48 (b), allow me first of\r\nall to thank you on behalf of Tunisia for your recent\r\nstatement on the World Summit on the Information\r\nSociety. We are convinced that your appeal for high-\r\nlevel participation in the second phase of the Summit,\r\nwhich will be held in Tunis from 16 to 18 November,\r\nwill be heeded and that all the parties concerned, be\r\nthey Governments, civil society or private sector\r\norganizations, will seize the opportunity offered by this\r\nimportant event to achieve results worthy of the\r\naspirations of the international community.\r\nIn September heads of State and Government\r\nunderscored that sport could foster peace and\r\ndevelopment and contribute to creating a climate of\r\ntolerance and understanding. They also used that\r\nopportunity to strengthen their commitment vis-à-vis\r\nthe principles underlying the Charter of the United\r\nNations, including peacebuilding, security and\r\ndevelopment, as well as their commitment regarding\r\nthe means to attain that goal, particularly at this\r\ndelicate stage in which the world finds itself.\r\nSport and physical education were acknowledged\r\nas being among the factors which influence the life of a\r\nsociety, in addition to political and economic aspects.\r\nIndeed, the positive effect of sport is not confined to\r\nthe promotion of health and development of the body,\r\nbut consists also in acquiring the necessary values for\r\nsocial interdependence, the strengthening of\r\nfriendships, the enrichment of dialogue and the\r\nmaintenance of contacts among races, cultures and\r\ncivilizations. It is in this context that Tunisia’s\r\ninitiative should be viewed — an initiative that was\r\ntaken two years ago with the support of most Member\r\nStates to strengthen the role of sport in promoting\r\neducation, health, development and peace.\r\nIt is a pleasure for me once again this year to\r\npresent, on behalf of my delegation and the other\r\nsponsors, draft resolution A/60/L.7*, entitled “Sport as\r\na means to promote education, health, development and\r\npeace”. Since the publication of this document, the\r\nfollowing countries have become sponsors: Andorra,\r\nArgentina, Brunei Darussalam, Côte d’Ivoire, the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, Dominican\r\nRepublic, France, Gabon, Luxembourg, Madagascar,\r\nMalta, Saint Lucia, San Marino, Thailand and Togo.\r\nThis draft is intended as a means of contributing\r\nto the attainment of internationally agreed development\r\ngoals, including those contained in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, aimed at achieving greater solidarity and\r\ncooperation as well as at disseminating the culture of\r\npeace. Based primarily on prior resolutions on this\r\nsubject, the text was the object of wide consultation\r\nand is the result of collective effort.\r\nOn this occasion, I would like to thank most\r\nwarmly all delegations and United Nations bodies, in\r\nparticular the head of the New York office of the\r\nSpecial Advisor to the Secretary-General on Sport for\r\nDevelopment and Peace, for the interest they have\r\nshown in this draft resolution and for their\r\ndetermination to contribute to the attainment of the\r\ngoals set for the International Year of Sport and\r\nPhysical Education 2005. My thanks go as well to\r\nMr. Adolph Ogi, the Special Advisor to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on Sport for Development and Peace, and\r\nMr. Jacques Rogge, President of the International\r\nOlympic Committee, for the ceaseless efforts they are\r\nexerting in this regard.\r\nThe draft invites Governments and concerned\r\ngovernmental entities and institutions involved in sport\r\nto strengthen the importance of sport and physical\r\neducation in their development policies and to promote\r\nthem as a means of attaining the goals of development\r\nand of strengthening the opportunities for providing\r\nsolidarity and cooperation to disseminate the culture of\r\npeace and the values of dialogue, understanding and\r\nfriendship among peoples.\r\nThe draft resolution is also aimed at encouraging\r\nGovernments and international sports bodies to\r\nundertake partnership initiatives and development\r\nprojects of their own that contribute to achieving the\r\nMillennium Development Goals, and to assist\r\ndeveloping countries consolidate their potential in the\r\nfield of sport and physical education. It advocates a\r\n7\r\nA/60/PV.43\r\nnumber of measures, including those through which\r\nsport and physical education could contribute to\r\npeaceful world and to the attainment of the Olympic\r\nideal.\r\nThe draft underscores in particular the will of the\r\ninternational community to maintain the dynamic trend\r\nbegun by the International Year for Sports and Physical\r\nEducation, which is a means of promoting education,\r\nhealth, development and peace, particularly by\r\nelaborating a plan of action aimed at developing and\r\nstrengthening partnerships between the United Nations\r\nand Governments, sport-related organizations and the\r\nprivate sector. This plan should be based on an\r\nassessment of progress attained, of the measures\r\nadopted and the difficulties encountered in the course\r\nof making sport a tool for the promotion of\r\ndevelopment and peace.\r\nAs we congratulate the UNESCO General\r\nConference for adopting the International Convention\r\nAgainst Doping in Sport at its thirty-third session, we\r\nappeal to all Member States to adhere to the\r\nConvention as soon as possible.\r\nOn behalf of the Tunisian delegation and of the\r\nother sponsors, we hope this draft resolution will enjoy\r\nthe unanimous support of the General Assembly.\r\nAllow me now to share the following with you\r\nbriefly on behalf of my country. In Tunisia we have\r\nworked to ensure that physical education and sport\r\nplay an essential role in our educational system as a\r\nfactor in bringing about physiological, psychological\r\nand social balance, above and beyond the role of\r\nstrengthening development in our country.\r\nWe are also working to inculcate sporting values\r\nand the Olympic spirit among our young people at all\r\nlevels of education and training, as well as on the\r\nprofessional and civic levels. We have endeavoured to\r\nensure that friendship and mutual respect prevail in\r\nrelations among Tunisian athletes, as well as between\r\nthem and athletes throughout the world, with the aim\r\nof strengthening the ties of mutual understanding,\r\nfriendship and tolerance between all the peoples of the\r\nworld.\r\nDeeply convinced of its approach, Tunisia is\r\nworking to strengthen those values by putting in place\r\na comprehensive educational, social and development\r\npolicy that considers sport and physical education as\r\neffective training and development tools in promoting\r\neducation, health, development and peace. The noble\r\nideal of sport leads us today to join our efforts with\r\nthose of the international community to make sport an\r\ninstrument to strengthen peace and promote\r\ndevelopment throughout the world, as well as to\r\nguarantee the right of children and young people of all\r\nages everywhere to physical education and the practice\r\nof sport and to profit as much as possible from its\r\nphysical, health and intellectual benefits. We also hope\r\nthat sport will be recognized as an effective tool in\r\nspreading development throughout the world,\r\nespecially in least developed countries, where there is\r\ninsufficient sporting equipment and infrastructure in\r\nterms of variety and quantity.\r\nIn closing, I wish to take this opportunity to\r\nreaffirm Tunisia’s support for the Olympic Truce\r\ninitiative. Working closely with the delegation of Italy\r\nand motivated by our belief that sport, physical\r\neducation and the ideals of the Olympics all contribute\r\nto the same objectives, the delegation of Tunisia has\r\nstriven to ensure the complementary nature of the\r\nTruce initiative and the draft resolution that I have just\r\nintroduced.\r\nThe President: I wish to underscore the\r\nimportance of the comments made by the\r\nrepresentative of Tunisia early in his statement with\r\nregard to the meeting to be held in Tunis on 16 and 18\r\nNovember.\r\nMr. Maurer (Switzerland) (spoke in French): My\r\ndelegation welcomes the Secretary-General’s report to\r\nthe sixtieth session of the General Assembly entitled\r\n“Sport for peace and development: International Year\r\nof Sport and Physical Education” (A/60/217). We are\r\nalso very pleased that the report is being debated along\r\nwith two draft resolutions, and we welcome the\r\nstatements made a few moments ago by our colleagues\r\nfrom Italy and Tunisia. The three documents\r\ncomplement each other and represent an encouraging\r\ndevelopment, namely, the growing consensus\r\nthroughout the world today that sport and physical\r\neducation can make a significant contribution to\r\nachieving development objectives, especially the\r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nMore than ever before, there is today a desire on\r\nthe part of the United Nations system, Governments,\r\nsports organizations, development agencies and the\r\nprivate sector to more specifically and systematically\r\nharness the great positive potential of sport and\r\n8\r\nA/60/PV.43\r\nphysical education to promote development, education,\r\npeace and health. The many different and widely\r\nsupported initiatives and activities at the local, national\r\nand global levels that have taken place in connection\r\nwith the 2005 International Year of Sport and Physical\r\nEducation attest resoundingly to that that desire.\r\nNone of that would have been possible without\r\nthe outstanding commitment of the Secretary-General\r\nand his Special Adviser on Sport for Development and\r\nPeace. Switzerland congratulates and thanks them for\r\ntheir tireless efforts.\r\nA solid foundation has been laid in the last few\r\nyears to promote the International Year of Sport and\r\nPhysical Education. It is now up to all stakeholders to\r\nagree on a common vision, aims and areas for action\r\nfor the future. It is also necessary for that framework\r\nbe put into operation.\r\nSwitzerland intends to contribute to that effort.\r\nFrom 4 to 6 December 2005, Switzerland will host the\r\nsecond Magglingen Conference on Sport and\r\nDevelopment, which will mark both the culmination\r\nand conclusion of the International Year of Sport and\r\nPhysical Education. It will pick up where the first\r\nMagglingen Conference on Sport and Development left\r\noff. The first Conference, which took place in\r\nSwitzerland in February 2003, drew 380\r\nrepresentatives from 55 countries, representing all\r\nsegments of society. Today, the Conference’s\r\ndeclarations and recommendations continue to be a\r\nsource of inspiration and guidance for sporting and\r\ndevelopment activities throughout the world.\r\nIn this regard, the three following key issues must\r\nbe addressed.\r\nFirst, we must take stock by assessing the results\r\nof the International Year of Sport and Physical\r\nEducation and evaluate experiences in that connection.\r\nWe must also put forth concrete initiatives, projects\r\nand programmes from around the world.\r\nSecondly, we must undertake advocacy and\r\nawareness-raising initiatives in order to further\r\npromote understanding among the general public and\r\nrelevant players about the great potential of sport in\r\npromoting development and peace, as well as to\r\npromote the integration of sport and physical education\r\ninto regional, national and global development\r\nstrategies.\r\nLastly, we must sustain the existing momentum\r\nby considering areas of joint future action, laying the\r\nfoundations for a global peace and development\r\nnetwork and establishing innovative partnerships and\r\nspecific arrangements for cooperation.\r\nThe theme of December’s Magglingen\r\nConference is “Development through sport: moving to\r\nthe next stage”. That theme expresses our conviction\r\nthat the time is ripe for a significant intensification of\r\nour efforts and activities. That will be essential if we\r\nare to take advantage of the existing momentum and to\r\ntap over the long term the enormous potential that sport\r\nholds for development and peace.\r\nThe matter of financing an adequate long-term\r\nstructure for sport for development and peace within\r\nthe United Nations system remains unresolved.\r\nNevertheless, we would like to point out the\r\nimportance of the need for a practical and speedy\r\nsolution to that question.\r\nThe draft resolutions being debated today\r\nembody this spirit. Switzerland, as host country to the\r\nInternational Olympic Committee and numerous other\r\ninternational sport associations, fully supports them.\r\nIn closing, allow me to make some comments\r\nbeyond those contained in the prepared text I have\r\ncirculated.\r\nWe are now working with determination and\r\ncommitment to give shape to the decisions taken\r\nduring September’s High-level Plenary Meeting of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. But at the same time, the\r\nGovernment of Switzerland believes that we can give\r\nadded weight and meaning to our efforts if we further\r\ncommit ourselves to opening up the United Nations to\r\ncivil society, the economy and sport. From the\r\nbeginning of his mandate, the Secretary-General set\r\nout for us his vision of such an opening. He has since\r\ndeveloped that vision. He deserves our ongoing\r\ncommitment.\r\nMr. Acklie (United States of America): The\r\ndelegation of the United States welcomes the General\r\nAssembly’s consideration today of agenda item 48, as\r\nwell as the draft resolutions entitled “Building a\r\npeaceful and better world through sport and the\r\nOlympic ideal” (A/60/L.15) and “Sport as a means to\r\npromote education, health, development and peace”\r\n(A/60/L.7*). The Former refers to the Olympic Truce,\r\n9\r\nA/60/PV.43\r\nand both refer to the International Year of Sport and\r\nPhysical Education.\r\nTo add to the spirit of sportsmanship today, the\r\ndelegation of the United States invited several\r\nOlympians to be present in the Hall. They are: Otis\r\nDavis, medallist in the 400 and 1600 metre relay in\r\n1960; Elliott Denman, medallist in the 50,000 metre\r\nwalk in 1956; Hazel Greene of Ireland, medallist in\r\narchery in 1980, 1985 and 1988; and Tegla Loroupe of\r\nKenya, two-time winner of the New York Marathon,\r\nwhich will take place again this weekend. In addition,\r\nBruce McDonald, medallist in the 20,000 and 50,000\r\nmetre walk in 1956, 1960 and 1964, and Gordon\r\nMcKenzie, medallist in the 10,000 metre and the\r\nmarathon in 1956 and 1960, respectively. May we have\r\nthose gentlemen and ladies stand?\r\nTheir presence here today highlights the high\r\nregard in which our Olympians hold the Truce and safe\r\npassage, and their solidarity with the United Nations.\r\nAs President George W. Bush acknowledged when\r\nmeeting with Olympians in 2002, sport teaches us to be\r\nhumble in victory, gracious in defeat, compassionate\r\nfor competitors and tolerant and appreciative of\r\ndiversity.\r\nIt is for these reasons that the United States\r\nGovernment has supported international athletic\r\ncompetitions. Indeed, such competitions promote\r\nunderstanding and respect for cultural diversity, foster\r\ninternational partnerships and increase awareness of\r\nglobal social issues such as human rights, the role of\r\nwomen in society and drug abuse prevention.\r\nMoreover, international athletic competitions generate\r\na deep sense of national pride while also fostering a\r\nspirit of international solidarity. The United States\r\nrecord includes hosting eight modern Olympic Games.\r\nOne of America’s proudest inventions, baseball,\r\nhas proven to be one of America’s proudest exports.\r\nLittle League baseball and softball leagues have been\r\nformed in over 75 countries, with 180,000 teams\r\nserving nearly 2.7 million boys and girls. Since its\r\nestablishment in 1939, Little League has grown from\r\nthree teams to nearly 200,000 teams in all 50 U.S.\r\nstates and more than 80 countries.\r\nToday the Assembly can support the peaceful\r\nenvironment that sport generates. Our delegation\r\nsupports today’s draft resolutions (A/60/L.7* and L.15),\r\nsubmitted by Italy and Tunisia, both of which use sport\r\nas a means to promote friendship, mutual\r\nunderstanding and well-being.\r\nThe United States particularly supports the\r\nrequest to undertake concrete action to promote a\r\nculture of peace based on the spirit of the Olympic\r\nTruce. Therefore, regarding sub-item (a) of agenda\r\nitem 48, “Building a peaceful and better world through\r\nsport and the Olympic ideal”, the United States would\r\nlike to thank the Italian mission for its hard work in\r\ninitiating the draft resolution in support of the Olympic\r\nTruce. The United States is pleased to join other\r\nMember States in co-sponsoring yet again this\r\nsymbolically significant initiative. By calling for the\r\nsafe passage and participation of athletes at the XX\r\nOlympic Winter Games in Turin, followed immediately\r\nby the Paralympic Games, the Truce is intended to\r\nfoster international understanding, peace and goodwill.\r\nThe United States has regarded the Olympics\r\nmovement as a catalyst toward the virtues that\r\nPresident Bush ascribes to sport. For example, the\r\nUnited States Government, in partnership with the\r\nInternational Olympic Committee and the United\r\nStates Olympic Committee, assisted in training the\r\nIraqi archery team, Iraqi wrestlers, boxers and a\r\nparalympian fencer, to prepare them for the 2004\r\nOlympic Games in Greece and to help Iraq re-enter the\r\ninternational sports community.\r\nAs regards draft resolution A/60/L.7*, “Sport as a\r\nmeans to promote education, health, development and\r\npeace”, we thank the Tunisian delegation for taking the\r\ninitiative on that draft, and we take note of Tunisia’s\r\ncontribution in hosting an international conference to\r\nhighlight the critical role of sport in health promotion\r\nand in the framework of the International Year for\r\nSport and Physical Education. Likewise, we thank the\r\nSecretariat for its report, “Sport for peace and\r\ndevelopment: International Year of Sport and Physical\r\nEducation” (A/60/217). We endorse its praise of\r\nnational activities pursued during the Year towards\r\n“raising public awareness about the benefits of sport\r\nand physical education in social and educational\r\nprogrammes” and making “the direct link to\r\nsustainable peace and human development” (ibid.,\r\npara. 12)\r\nFurthermore, the United States delegation\r\nacknowledges the valuable contributions being made\r\nby the United Nations Office for the International Year\r\nof Sport and Physical Education, the Office of the\r\n10\r\nA/60/PV.43\r\nSpecial Adviser to the Secretary-General on Sport for\r\nDevelopment and Peace, the United Nations New York\r\nOffice of Sport for Development and Peace and by\r\nMr. Adolf Ogi of Switzerland, the Secretary-General’s\r\nSpecial Adviser on Sport for Development and Peace.\r\nAs the report notes, those United Nations offices\r\nhave managed to utilize sports programmes as\r\ncomponents of development strategies in cooperation\r\nwith non-governmental organizations, sport\r\nfederations, the private sector, foundations and others.\r\nThese are promising activities through which the\r\ninternational community might work toward realizing\r\nthe goals of the United Nations Charter.\r\nWe look forward to ensuring that our efforts to\r\nuse sport continue beyond the International Year and\r\nhave long-term results, as recommended by the report.\r\nWe will continue to look for ways to partner with civil\r\nsociety and the private sector to promote sport as a\r\nmeans of promoting intercultural, post-conflict and\r\npeacebuilding dialogues.\r\nThrough our sport exchanges, young people have\r\ndiscovered how success in athletics builds self-\r\nconfidence and the skills required for achievement in\r\nlife. Recently, former members of the National\r\nBasketball Association and the Women’s National\r\nBasketball Association conducted clinics in Senegal\r\nand Nigeria for hundreds of youth, engaged in dialogue\r\nand donated 12,000 pairs of Reebok basketball shoes.\r\nThrough such programmes, the United States will\r\ncontinue to reach out to youth around the world with a\r\nmessage of America’s commitment to international\r\nunderstanding, cultural tolerance and mutual respect.\r\nAs regards physical education more specifically,\r\nfor many years the United States President’s Council\r\non Physical Fitness and Sports has served well as an\r\nadvisory committee of citizen volunteers. Through\r\nvarious creative initiatives, the Council promotes\r\nhealth, physical activity, fitness and enjoyment for\r\npeople of all ages, backgrounds and abilities through\r\nparticipation in physical activity and sport. At the\r\nCouncil’s website, citizens of all ages can sign up for\r\nthe Presidential Champions programme that provides\r\nparticular physical activity plans to fit individual\r\nneeds. The programme is a signature part of a wider\r\nHealthier American agenda.\r\nAlso, we note the draft resolution’s invitation to\r\nconsider ratifying the International Convention Against\r\nDoping in Sport and that it commends UNESCO on its\r\nsuccessful negotiation. The United States, however,\r\ncalls for States to take into account the World Anti-\r\nDoping Code of March 2003, which has the support of\r\nmore than 150 countries. It would be helpful to avoid a\r\nduplication of effort or the possibility of a conflict\r\nbetween those two instruments.\r\nSport exercises a deep hold on the human\r\nimagination. Sport transcends all perceived barriers\r\nacross ethnicities, ages, genders, religions and abilities,\r\nand sport reminds us of our common humanity.\r\nMs. Khalil (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): On the\r\nnational level, sport and physical education play an\r\nimportant part in economic and social development and\r\nin the improvement of public health, and they bring\r\nlocal communities together. On the international level,\r\nsport and physical education can have a long-term\r\npositive effect on the development of public health,\r\npeace and the environment.\r\nEgypt welcomes the efforts made internationally,\r\nregionally and locally and by the United Nations to\r\ncelebrate the International Year of Sport and Physical\r\nEducation. We wish to emphasize the importance of\r\nthose occasions and activities as forums to create\r\nawareness among the young and to familiarize them\r\nwith current challenges and to promote the spirit of\r\ncompetition, fraternity and tolerance. Young people\r\ncan thus become United Nations goodwill\r\nambassadors, because they are capable of\r\ncommunicating with other young people and can\r\nbecome examples for others to follow.\r\nWe wish also to emphasize the importance of the\r\nrole of sport in fulfilling the MDGs, and we welcome\r\nefforts to use sport as a means of achieving\r\ndevelopment. We deem it useful for experts worldwide\r\nto share their knowledge, with a view to promoting\r\nhealth, peace, national reconciliation and the exchange\r\nof experiences. We stress also the need to set up sports\r\nstructures in local communities so that they can\r\nbecome practical tools for sustainable development.\r\nIn Egypt, sport is pivotal to integral development,\r\nas it fosters a spirit of honest competition and tolerance\r\namong communities and peoples. Egypt continues to\r\nplay a pioneering role in the area of sport and its\r\ndevelopment in Africa and in the Arab region.\r\nEgyptian athletes have held numerous important posts,\r\nincluding the presidency of the Volleyball Union. They\r\nhave received many international medals in tennis,\r\nvolleyball and basketball championships, and many\r\n11\r\nA/60/PV.43\r\nhave been nominated as goodwill ambassadors to the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nMy delegation wishes to emphasize two\r\nimportant points: the increase in racism, racial\r\ndiscrimination and intolerance, and, in sports\r\ncompetitions, an increase in the prevalence of doping.\r\nAs to the first question, Egypt wishes to express\r\nits concern with respect to the issues mentioned in the\r\nreport of experts in terms of fighting racism, racial\r\ndiscrimination and intolerance, which are contrary to\r\nthe values, ideals and principles of the Olympics. We\r\nbelieve that it is important to fight those phenomena\r\nand to encourage athletes not to discriminate on the\r\nbasis of race, religion, colour or gender.\r\nWe must emphasize the negative long-term\r\nimpact of doping on public health and development\r\nefforts. My delegation welcomes the preparation of a\r\nfinal draft international convention against doping in\r\nsport and calls for members to take it into\r\nconsideration.\r\nMr. Xie Bohua (China) (spoke in Chinese): The\r\nChinese delegation wishes to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report under agenda item 48 entitled\r\n“Sports for peace and development: International Year\r\nof Sport and Physical Education”.\r\nThis year marks the sixtieth anniversary of the\r\nfounding of the United Nations. Since its\r\nestablishment, the United Nations has consistently\r\nattached great importance to the pivotal role and\r\nconsiderable influence of sports.\r\nThe United Nations has done a tremendous\r\namount of work in promoting the Olympic spirit. The\r\nGeneral Assembly has adopted a number of successive\r\nresolutions on an Olympic Truce, and it declared the\r\nyear 2005 as the International Year of Sport and\r\nPhysical Education.\r\nThanks to the joint efforts of the international\r\ncommunity, sport has become a bridge enabling\r\nexchanges, mutual understanding and friendship among\r\nthe peoples of the world, and it also plays a positive\r\nrole in the maintenance of international peace and in\r\nthe promotion of development.\r\nThe modern Olympic ideal of “higher, faster and\r\nstronger” has gone far beyond the realm of sports to\r\nbecome a spiritual force underlying humankind’s\r\npursuit of happiness, prosperity and a harmonious\r\nworld. We hope that all countries will continue to work\r\nto realize the purposes and principles of the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations, and hence promote the Olympic\r\nspirit as well as dialogue and exchanges among various\r\ncivilizations, in an effort to create a peaceful and\r\nprosperous world.\r\nThe Chinese Government and people appreciate\r\nthe Olympic spirit and fully recognize the important\r\nrole of sport in peace and development. We commend\r\nItaly and Tunisia for having submitted two draft\r\nresolutions under this item and are pleased to co-\r\nsponsor them. In that connection, we would like also to\r\nexpress our heartfelt wishes for success in connection\r\nwith the 2006 Winter Olympic Games in Turin, Italy.\r\nThe XXIX Olympic Games will be held in\r\nBeijing, China, in 2008. Preparations therefor are\r\nproceeding in an orderly manner. In keeping with the\r\nconcept of “Green Olympics, High-tech Olympics, and\r\nPeople’s Olympics”, the Chinese Government will\r\nfurther promote the Olympic spirit with a view to\r\nmaking the Beijing Olympics a truly magnificent\r\nsports gathering that will help to promote and maintain\r\nworld peace, strengthen ties of friendship among\r\npeoples, and promote dialogue and exchanges among\r\ndifferent civilizations. China, which is at once ancient\r\nand modern, welcomes the arrival of friends from all\r\ncountries.\r\nMr. Brousseau (Canada): Canada is pleased to\r\ntake the floor today to address the draft resolution\r\nentitled “Building a peaceful and better world through\r\nsport and the Olympic ideal”, put forward by the\r\ndelegation of Italy.\r\nCanada affirms its endorsement of and\r\ncommitment to the principles and ideals that underpin\r\nthis draft resolution.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nBy co-sponsoring this draft resolution, Canada\r\nreaffirms its longstanding recognition of sport as a vital\r\nfactor in building sustainable communities,\r\ncontributing to global peace, and encouraging healthy\r\nlifestyles among young people.\r\nThe power of sport to act as a positive catalyst for\r\ngrowth and change is evidenced through the efforts of\r\ncountless humanitarian organizations, which use sport\r\nas a tool to help rebuild nations and to heal individuals\r\nand communities following periods of conflict.\r\n12\r\nA/60/PV.43\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nCanada encourages Member States to recognize\r\nand support both the Olympic and Paralympic\r\nmovements.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThe importance of recognizing the Paralympic\r\nmovement in the text of this draft resolution was a\r\npriority for Canada. This draft extends the period of the\r\nOlympic Truce beyond the XX Olympic Winter\r\nGames, to be held next February in Turin, Italy, so that\r\nit encompasses the Paralympic Winter Games, also in\r\nTurin in March 2006.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nIn closing, we are pleased to see a strong level of\r\nsupport among Member States both for this draft\r\nresolution and for constructive cooperation with\r\nconcerned agencies and programmes of the United\r\nNations and the International Olympic Committee.\r\nMr. Gillerman (Israel): The State of Israel is\r\nproud to lend its support and co-sponsorship to the\r\ndraft resolution entitled “Building a peaceful and better\r\nworld through sport and the Olympic ideal” and would\r\nalso like to take this opportunity to congratulate Italy,\r\nthe host country of the 2006 Winter Games.\r\nAthletic competition provides an ideal medium\r\nfor transcending national boundaries and fostering\r\ngood will, better relations and mutual respect. The\r\nprinciples underlying athletic competition provide a\r\nchannel through which people of different religious,\r\ncultural, racial and political backgrounds can interact\r\nand enhance their understanding of each other. By the\r\nsame token, the contributions sports can make in\r\npromoting development, education and health shall not\r\nbe underestimated. In many cases, athletic competition\r\nis a means to enhance relationships and build bridges.\r\nOne notable recent example from our region is Qatar’s\r\ncontribution towards the building of a soccer stadium\r\nin the Israeli municipality Sakhnin, where the local\r\nsoccer team, playing in the premier league, is\r\ncomposed of Jewish and Arab Israeli players. This is a\r\nwelcome initiative, representing an opportunity for our\r\ncountries to enhance relations on a people-to-people\r\nbasis. We would like to call on other countries in our\r\nregion to collaborate with us and replicate this gesture\r\nunder the auspices of good sportsmanship.\r\nUnfortunately, not all athletic events are carried\r\nout with the same positive sentiment as prevailed when\r\nthey were founded. In some cases, athletic competition\r\nis abused as a tool for politicization. As noted in the\r\nreport by the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on\r\nHuman Rights on Contemporary Forms of Racism,\r\nRacial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related\r\nIntolerances, the noble ideas of competition and mutual\r\nrespect are being eroded by the exacerbation of the\r\nnationalistic dimension of competitions and an\r\noveremphasis on money.\r\nAt the Olympic Games in Athens, for example,\r\nan Iranian judoka refused to compete with an Israeli\r\nathlete. After the Iranian withdrew from the\r\ntournament, according to Iran’s official news service,\r\nthe Government paid him $115,000, the amount\r\nawarded to gold medallists. A further contradiction of\r\nthe important ideal to which the Olympics aspire is the\r\nmanifestations of racism, anti-Semitism and other\r\nforms of intolerance in sports. Athletic competition and\r\nintolerance simply contradict each other. Given the\r\nattention by the Special Rapporteur to the\r\nmanifestations of racism and anti-Semitism in sporting\r\nevents during his last two reports, Israel sees merit in\r\nincluding a reference to that troubling phenomenon in\r\nthe resolution of the Third Committee on the\r\nelimination of racism, racial discrimination,\r\nxenophobia and related intolerance during this session\r\nof the General Assembly as well.\r\nIn this context, we would like to commend recent\r\ninternational efforts to reject the manifestation of\r\nracism and intolerance during sporting events. Anti-\r\nracism campaigns, such as the efforts by the Union of\r\nEuropean Football Associations, Federation\r\nInternationale de Football Association (FIFA), Football\r\nAgainst Racism Europe (FARE), Let’s Kick Racism\r\nOut of Football in the United Kingdom and similar\r\nactivities throughout Europe, as well as those led by\r\nprivate companies, deserve praise and support from the\r\ninternational community. Israel’s concern for this issue\r\nis reflected in our cooperation with several of those\r\nassociations on a national level.\r\nThe ultimate example of political abuse, when all\r\nboundaries are broken and the sanctity of the Olympic\r\nideal is violated, is when terrorists target athletes. The\r\nidea of the Olympic Games cannot be separated, in the\r\nmemory of Israelis and people throughout the world,\r\nfrom the horrific act of terrorism that tarnished the\r\n1972 Munich Games. At those Games, gunmen from\r\n13\r\nA/60/PV.43\r\nthe terrorist group Black September broke into the\r\nOlympic Village disguised as athletes and killed eleven\r\nIsraeli athletes and coaches. That horrific act of\r\nterrorism and murder is unprecedented in the annals of\r\nOlympic history and represents the very antithesis of\r\nthe Olympic ideal. Rather than allowing the Games to\r\ntranscend politics and conflict, the Games were used as\r\na vehicle for the expression of hatred and the\r\nperpetration of murder. What is particularly\r\ndisheartening is that the International Olympic\r\nCommittee has yet to take a decision to officially\r\nobserve the memory of the fallen Israeli athletes\r\nwhenever the Olympics take place. This blemish on the\r\nhistory of the Games must not be forgotten as we strive\r\nto ensure that future Olympic events serve to broaden\r\nunderstanding, tolerance, respect and peace.\r\nIsrael reaffirms its support for the noble\r\nobjectives of the draft resolution before us and for the\r\nobservance of the Olympic truce. The Olympic Games\r\nare one of the world’s only true global events and, as\r\nsuch, present us with an extraordinary opportunity to\r\nfocus the world’s attention and utilize the good will\r\nthat the Games inspire to build a more peaceful and\r\nmore harmonious world.\r\nMr. Rogachev (Russian Federation) (spoke in\r\nRussian): Sports and peace are closely linked concepts.\r\nThe absence of war is a necessary condition for battle\r\nin the sports arena. Sports bring peoples together and\r\nthe competition that is an essential component of sports\r\nactivity does not mean combat with the enemy but\r\nrather competition among partners, colleagues, like-\r\nminded people, and, on the whole, a striving to\r\nimprove.\r\nThe role of sport as an ambassador for peace is\r\nespecially significant when it is joined with the noble\r\ntraditions of the Olympic truce. The pressing need to\r\neducate future generations in the spirit of a culture of\r\npeace, non-violence and tolerance once again proves\r\nthat not only is the Olympic ideal not outdated, but\r\nwith time it is acquiring new, ever greater relevance.\r\nThe flame of the Olympics should illuminate the path\r\nleading mankind to the third millennium and serve as a\r\nbeacon indicating the way to peace without hostility\r\nand violence.\r\nIn a few months, this peaceful flame will glow\r\nover the lovely city of Turin, which will host the 2006\r\nWinter Olympics. In this connection, we sincerely wish\r\nour Italian friends success in organizing this worldwide\r\nevent and in the achievement of harmony through\r\nsports.\r\nThe International Year of Sport and Physical\r\nEducation declared by the United Nations is coming to\r\na close. Measures taken within that context have made\r\na considerable contribution to resolving a number of\r\nsocial, economic, environmental, health and\r\neducational issues. To emphasize the role of sports in\r\nstrengthening mutual understanding among peoples\r\nwas the purpose of the International Conference on\r\nSport and Peace, held in Moscow from 2 to 5 October,\r\n2005 in the context of the International Year of Sport\r\nand Physical Education. Forty States were represented\r\nat the Conference, as were such international\r\norganizations as the United Nations, UNESCO, the\r\nCouncil of Europe and the World Anti-Doping Agency.\r\nDuring the course of the productive work, such timely\r\nissues as future prospects for international sports\r\ncooperation were discussed, and we determined\r\npractical objectives for activating multilateral\r\ninteraction in that sphere, including within the context\r\nof the United Nations. As a result of the Conference, a\r\ndeclaration was adopted which in particular calls upon\r\nthe world’s politicians, athletes and sports\r\norganizations to use their authority to avoid conflict\r\nand to repudiate hostility and aggression and thus to\r\naid the unification of the international community\r\naround the principles of peace and harmony.\r\nSport is a universal language. Due to the fact that\r\nrepresentatives of different countries, cultures and\r\nbeliefs participate in sports competitions, one can say\r\nwith certainty that “sports diplomacy” is a powerful\r\nthing, capable of becoming an effective channel for the\r\nadvancement of the culture of peace and dialogue\r\namong civilizations.\r\nMr. Kyaw Tint Swe (Myanmar), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nMr. Vassilakis (Greece): It is a great honour and\r\npleasure for me to take the floor on agenda item 48 (a)\r\nto express my country’s wholehearted support for draft\r\nresolution A/60/L.15, entitled “Building a peaceful and\r\nbetter world through sport and the Olympic ideal”.\r\nTwo years ago, Greece presented a similar draft\r\nresolution as it prepared for the 2004 Athens Olympics.\r\nResolution 58/6 received the widest possible support\r\nfrom Member States, giving new meaning and\r\nrelevance to the ancient tradition of Olympic Truce —\r\nekecheiria in Greek.\r\n14\r\nA/60/PV.43\r\nThis year it is Italy’s turn to uphold the tradition\r\nand submit a draft resolution urging Member States to\r\nobserve, within the framework of the Charter, the\r\nOlympic Truce during the XX Olympic Winter Games,\r\nto be held in Turin from 10 to 26 February 2006, and\r\nthe subsequent Paralympic Games. The wide support\r\nfor this year’s draft resolution underlines the\r\ninternational community’s recognition of the goals set\r\nout therein and our common eagerness to celebrate the\r\nGames in peace, harmony and friendship. We wish\r\nboth Italy and China, which is to follow as host in\r\n2008, every success in organizing the Olympic Games.\r\nIn bringing the idea of the Olympic Truce to the\r\nforefront, we encourage the notion that it is possible to\r\nbuild a lasting peace from a pause in hostilities. That\r\nis, in fact, how the Olympic Games were conceived in\r\nthe first place. In antiquity, the implementation of the\r\nOlympic Truce entailed a cessation of all hostilities in\r\norder to allow athletes and spectators to travel to and\r\nfrom Olympia and attend the sacred celebration of\r\nhuman achievement. Having been upheld for over a\r\nmillennium, the Olympic Truce is the longest peace\r\ntreaty in history.\r\nIt is widely believed that, because of\r\ncommunication technology, it is easier than ever to\r\nexchange ideas and to understand one another.\r\nHowever, in our modern Babel, misunderstandings\r\nprevail. Insecurity is a widespread feeling in every part\r\nof the world. We strive for dialogue among\r\ncivilizations and cooperation among the rich and the\r\npoor, yet each day witnesses our failure. The Olympic\r\nTruce could be a constructive new approach to conflict\r\nresolution. The Olympic ideal is a universal language,\r\nin which all peoples can communicate and share the\r\npleasure of the Games.\r\nA few days before the 2004 Olympics in Athens,\r\nthe Olympic torch came for the first time to the United\r\nNations. In a joyous celebration, the fire from Olympia\r\nbrought light to our Headquarters and carried the\r\nmessage of peace and solidarity. The United Nations\r\nand the Olympic movement are natural allies. They\r\nstrive for the same goals and observe the same\r\nprinciples. They are useful tools in the hands of the\r\ninternational community. They are what we make of\r\nthem. It is up to us, the Member States, to seize the\r\nopportunity offered by the draft resolution and to\r\nobserve the Truce, for the benefit of our peoples.\r\nWe express our appreciation and support to the\r\nInternational Olympic Committee for its tireless efforts\r\nto promote the Olympic ideal and build bridges of\r\nunderstanding and cooperation. We commend the\r\nPresident of the International Olympic Committee,\r\nMr. Jacques Rogge, for promoting the idea of the\r\nOlympic Truce. Greece will stand by him in his efforts\r\nto strengthen the Olympic movement.\r\nThis year, we are also celebrating the\r\nInternational Year of Sport and Physical Education.\r\nImportant initiatives have been undertaken by some\r\nMember States, such as the International Conference\r\non Sport and Peace organized by Russia in October and\r\nthe International Conference on Sport and Education\r\norganized by Thailand, which ended yesterday. All\r\nover the world, it is widely recognized that sport has an\r\nimportant role to play in peace and development. It has\r\nbecome a national priority and an integral part of\r\neducation programmes worldwide.\r\nTo teach sport to our children is to teach them the\r\nprinciples of the Olympic spirit. It is to teach them\r\nmutual understanding, friendship, solidarity and fair\r\nplay, thus giving them the instruments with which to\r\nbuild a better future for themselves. That is why we\r\nhave co-sponsored draft resolution A/60/L.7,\r\nintroduced by Tunisia, entitled “Sport as a means to\r\npromote education, health, development and peace”.\r\nIn closing, let me stress once again that by\r\nadopting today the draft resolution entitled “Building a\r\npeaceful and better world through sport and the\r\nOlympic ideal” we are taking a positive approach to\r\nlife and to today’s realities at the personal and national\r\nlevels. We have no illusions, and we dream no utopian\r\ndreams. We are simply stating the obvious — if we can\r\nhave peace in the world for 16 days, then maybe we\r\ncan have it forever.\r\nMr. Labbé (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): I should\r\nlike, first of all, to congratulate the Bureau for its\r\nleadership in guiding our work in the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nResolutions 58/5 of 3 November 2003 and 59/10\r\nof 27 October 2004 declared 2005 as the International\r\nYear of Sport and Physical Education, seeing the Year\r\nas an important means to promote education, health,\r\ndevelopment and peace.\r\nLikewise, paragraph 145 of the World Summit\r\nOutcome document (resolution 60/1) states,\r\n15\r\nA/60/PV.43\r\n“We underline that sports can foster peace and\r\ndevelopment and can contribute to an atmosphere\r\nof tolerance and understanding, and we\r\nencourage discussions in the General Assembly\r\nfor proposals leading to a plan of action on sport\r\nand development.”\r\nChile is pleased that we are currently in the\r\nprocess of implementing that mandate from our\r\nleaders, the result of tireless efforts by our country and\r\nothers. It is in that context that my country decided to\r\nco-sponsor the draft resolutions entitled “Building a\r\npeaceful and better world through sport and the\r\nOlympic ideal” and “Sport as a means to promote\r\neducation, health, development and peace”, drawn up,\r\nrespectively, by Italy and Tunisia, which Chile would\r\nlike to congratulate for their patient preparatory work.\r\nChile would also like to thank and congratulate\r\nthe Secretary-General for his report on sport for peace\r\nand development.\r\nChile firmly believes that those two draft\r\nresolutions can provide an excellent basis for our\r\nefforts to achieve full compliance with the major\r\ndevelopment goals set out in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration. In this context, we recognize that the\r\ndisciplines of sports and physical education are life-\r\nlong pursuits and that they constitute an important tool,\r\nnot only for health and physical development, but also\r\nfor the acquisition and internalization of values that\r\nhave a positive impact on social cohesiveness and\r\nfacilitate intercultural dialogue.\r\nThat is why my country is fully convinced that, if\r\nwe are to fully exploit the potential of sports activities\r\nin the framework of the International Year of Sport and\r\nPhysical Education, further initiatives must be taken to\r\nmake sports an effective tool for development and\r\npeace, at both the national and international levels.\r\nSports, healthy competition and the Olympic\r\nideal conjure up positive images of understanding, of\r\nthe overcoming of obstacles and of an appreciation of\r\nhumankind worldwide. The ancient tradition of the\r\nOlympic Truce was an early demonstration of wisdom\r\nand compassion that we should replicate in this\r\ndifficult but promising era.\r\nAccording to the story retold so masterfully in the\r\nmusic of the great German composer Richard Strauss,\r\nthe Olympic laurel comes from the sacred tree into\r\nwhich Daphne was transformed by the Olympic gods to\r\nplace humankind and nature in an eternal embrace.\r\nMindful of this image of beauty, harmony and peace,\r\nChile undertakes to imbue the diplomatic relay race\r\nwith energy and hope.\r\nMr. Al-Nasser (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic):\r\nMr. President, allow me at the outset to extend once\r\nagain, on behalf of the State of Qatar, our warm\r\ncongratulations and sincere thanks to you for your\r\ncompetent stewardship of the work of the current\r\nsession of the General Assembly. We would like to\r\nassure you anew of the full cooperation of the State of\r\nQatar. Allow me also to take this opportunity to thank\r\nthe Secretary-General for his valuable report under\r\nitem 48 (b) of the agenda, entitled “Sports for peace\r\nand development: International Year of Sport and\r\nPhysical Education”. (A/60/217)\r\nThe report reaffirms the important contribution\r\nthat sports and physical education can make to the\r\nachievement of peace and development, especially\r\nhuman development. For our part, we continue to\r\nsupport the objectives set by the United Nations system\r\nin the context of the International Year of Sport and\r\nPhysical Education.\r\nThe State of Qatar believes that sports, peace and\r\ndevelopment must be viewed from a broader\r\nperspective. Indeed, the international community has\r\nrecognized their synergy. Sports has always been an\r\nimportant factor that can bring people together in\r\npeace. Physical education has always been an\r\nimportant means of nurturing children in various\r\nsocieties and in enhancing tolerance and understanding\r\namong various cultures and different racial groups.\r\nIn that regard, the State of Qatar believes that due\r\nattention should be accorded the question of human\r\ndevelopment in the realm of sports and to the\r\nexpansion of the concept of sports to include sports for\r\nall. Guided by those principles, the Government of the\r\nState of Qatar, on instructions from His Highness\r\nSheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani, the Emir of the\r\nState of Qatar, has consistently sought to enhance its\r\nactivities in the field of youth and sports and to\r\nparticipate in international efforts. Qatar aspires to\r\nbuilding a prosperous society in which young people\r\ncan reap the benefits of sports and profit from the\r\nvalues embodied in a world Olympic renaissance.\r\nThe State of Qatar has endeavoured to keep pace\r\nwith the evolution of human aspirations in the field of\r\nsports. Thus it has striven to create a sound sports\r\n16\r\nA/60/PV.43\r\nenvironment for the younger generations that fulfils\r\ntheir ambitions, motivates them and assists them in the\r\nprocess of their development. Qatar supports the\r\ncreative efforts under way to achieve a comprehensive\r\nsocial renaissance leading to a brighter future, on the\r\nbasis of social development and the promotion of\r\nmechanisms to bring to fruition the endeavours of\r\nhumankind and enhance its creative output.\r\nResponding to the needs of youth, and in order to\r\nrealize all the concepts and values of the Olympic\r\nmovement, the State of Qatar is focusing on building\r\nyouth hostels and on the establishment of Olympic-\r\nquality sports facilities and the development of related\r\nmeans and mechanisms. It is currently engaged in\r\nbuilding the Olympic City in Doha in preparation for\r\nhosting the fifteenth Asian Games in 2006. In that\r\nregard, the State of Qatar has successfully hosted the\r\nJunior World Cup (FIFA) as well as the World Cup\r\nfinals for the Asian continent in 1994, which made\r\npossible the achievements of its track and field team.\r\nQatar has also participated in numerous Olympic\r\ngames and meetings. It looks forward to continuing to\r\nhost sporting events and tournaments. The Public\r\nAuthority for Youth and Sports in Qatar is working on\r\nan ongoing basis to highlight the value of cooperation\r\namong young people, promote the relationships\r\nbetween our youth and the youth of the world, and\r\nbuild bridges of hope and cooperation, mutual\r\nunderstanding, friendship and solidarity among\r\npeoples. The objective is to achieve the lofty Olympic\r\ngoal of building a better future for humankind in the\r\nnew world of the twenty-first century — a world in\r\nwhich trust among peoples is strengthened and in\r\nwhich, through common human endeavours, a bright\r\nfuture is realized, characterized by high ideals, lofty\r\nvalues and the capacity for creative Olympic\r\ncompetition.\r\nAt the dawn of the twenty-first century, humanity\r\nnow more than ever must make strenuous efforts to\r\nseek detente among peoples and to bring about\r\ninternational peace and security based on justice and\r\nthe equality of rights and obligations. In that regard,\r\nwe must promote those practices that safeguard\r\nrelations among peoples. We must also work in a\r\ncollective framework in which sports and physical\r\neducation create opportunities for solidarity —\r\npromoting the culture of peace and enhancing social\r\nand gender equality and the call for dialogue and\r\nharmony.\r\nMoreover, we must acknowledge the contribution\r\nof sports and physical education to social and\r\neconomic development as a means of achieving\r\ninternationally agreed development objectives,\r\nincluding those contained in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, and the wider objectives of development,\r\npeace and security. We must also safeguard peace and\r\nsecurity within and among nations. Furthermore, we\r\nmust promote health awareness and the spirit of\r\naccomplishment; encourage communication among\r\ncultures; entrench the group spirit; and urge\r\nGovernments, international sports bodies and sports\r\norganizations to formulate and implement partnership\r\ninitiatives and development projects that are\r\ncompatible with the educational curriculums used at all\r\nlevels of education in order to help achieve the\r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nIt is important, therefore, to ensure that the\r\neradication of poverty is the focus of special attention\r\nin the context of the campaign to promote the culture\r\nof peace, because peace is not merely the absence of\r\nviolence and conflict; rather, it is closely linked to\r\neconomic development, respect for human rights,\r\nsolidarity among peoples, dialogue among cultures,\r\nsustainable human development, the free flow of\r\ninformation and knowledge, the management and\r\nprevention of conflict, post-conflict peacebuilding, and\r\ngender equality.\r\nHence, interaction between the culture of peace\r\nand sustainable development continues to be the\r\ncornerstone of the enterprise to which the international\r\ncommunity must henceforth devote itself, armed with\r\nthe necessary political will to transform into reality the\r\nbasic and legitimate aspirations of peoples to a world\r\nof peace and justice, free from misery and poverty.\r\nThe International Year of Sport and Physical\r\nEducation reaffirms the importance of sport and\r\nusefully contributes to international peace and security\r\nthrough an all-inclusive international partnership\r\nincluding the private sector, international sports\r\nfederations, non-governmental organizations and\r\npublic organizations. The United Nations can unite all\r\nsports-related organizations in order to reaffirm the\r\nrole of sport as a real partner in achieving the\r\nobjectives of peace and development.\r\nSport, by its nature, integrates citizens into\r\nsociety, removes barriers between different societies\r\nand acquaints groups and individuals with one another,\r\n17\r\nA/60/PV.43\r\nemphasizing what unites them and helping them\r\novercome ethnic and cultural differences. That makes\r\nsport a powerful tool for supporting conflict prevention\r\nand peacebuilding efforts, within societies and at the\r\ninternational level, and for promoting the Dialogue\r\namong civilizations and the right of all peoples to self-\r\ndetermination and solidarity. Thus, sport helps make it\r\npossible to tackle global problems by sharing those\r\nresponsibilities and by responding to the needs of the\r\nmost disadvantaged.\r\nSport, peace, culture, the humanitarian impulse\r\nand respect for moral principles have been the essential\r\nideals of the Olympic movement since the first games\r\nwere held at Olympia in 776 B.C. The State of Qatar\r\nbelieves that sport and the Olympic ideal without doubt\r\nstrengthen friendship and brotherhood among peoples,\r\nwhich are essential for the promotion of peace,\r\ndevelopment and cooperation among nations.\r\nThe International Year of Sport and Physical\r\nEducation reflects universal objectives. Sport and\r\nphysical education play a major role in achieving\r\nglobal development goals. They provide an opportunity\r\nto renew our commitment to the basic principles of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter, including the establishment of\r\npeace, security and development, especially at this\r\ndelicate moment in the world situation, when our\r\nsupport for the Organization’s activities and methods\r\nof work is most needed.\r\nThe delegation of Qatar believes that, in the\r\ntwenty-first century, the world’s nations should uphold\r\ntheir commitment to the purposes and principles of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter and promote sportsmanship\r\nand the Olympic ideal resolutely and actively in order\r\nto advance dialogue among civilizations and encourage\r\nsocial and economic progress in the world. We strongly\r\nsupport the call on all States to take advantage of the\r\nopportunity offered by sport to promote peace and\r\ndevelopment. The State of Qatar pledges sincerely and\r\nfully to support that endeavour. In that regard, it is\r\nevident that the world needs peace now.\r\nMy delegation is pleased to take this opportunity\r\nto reaffirm its confidence in the United Nations as the\r\nprincipal organization for establishing detente among\r\nnations and achieving international peace and security\r\non the basis of justice and equal rights and obligations\r\nfor all. The way to peace lies in mutual understanding,\r\nrespect and cooperation among cultures and\r\nreligions — regardless of one’s gender or creed — the\r\npeaceful settlement of disputes and the promotion of a\r\nculture of peace through dialogue and education.\r\nFinally, my delegation believes that political will is an\r\nimportant incentive for achieving peace.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on agenda item 48 and its sub-\r\nitems (a) and (b).\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft\r\nresolutions A/60/L.15 and A/60/L.7.*\r\nWe turn first to draft resolution A/60/L.15,\r\nentitled “Building a peaceful and better world through\r\nsport and the Olympic ideal”, under sub-item (a).\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/60/L.15?\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution\r\n60/8).\r\nThe Acting President: We next turn to draft\r\nresolution A/60/L.7,* entitled “Sport as a means to\r\npromote education, health, development and peace”,\r\nunder sub-item (b).\r\nSince the introduction of the draft resolution, the\r\nfollowing countries have become sponsors: the Central\r\nAfrican Republic, Kazakhstan, Qatar, Spain, Ukraine,\r\nthe United Arab Emirates and Zambia.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/60/L.7*?\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution\r\n60/9).\r\nThe Acting President: Before giving the floor to\r\nspeakers in explanation of vote, may I remind speakers\r\nthat explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and\r\nshould be made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMs. García-Matos. (Bolivarian Republic of\r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): We would like to\r\nexpress the commitment of the Bolivarian Republic of\r\nVenezuela to sport as a tool for attaining peace and\r\ndevelopment. We also note that sports constitutes the\r\ncentral pillar of the public policies currently being\r\nimplemented by the Venezuelan Government. We\r\nexpress our recognition and support to the Italian\r\ndelegation and Government for introducing the draft\r\nresolution.\r\nHowever, we would like to make an interpretative\r\ncomment on the eighth preambular paragraph of the\r\n18\r\nA/60/PV.43\r\npresent resolution to explain why we did not sponsor\r\nthe resolution, which, as we have said, fully reflects\r\nour commitments and policies.\r\nAs the General Assembly knows, the Bolivarian\r\nRepublic of Venezuela does not recognize as part of the\r\noutcome of the 2005 World Summit the final document\r\ncontained in A/60/L.1. It is, therefore, our\r\ninterpretation that the eighth preambular paragraph of\r\nthat resolution refers to commitments of a general\r\nnature that should guide our Governments’ actions in\r\nthe quest for a world in which peace prevails and\r\nsports is given its proper place. That in no way implies\r\nthat we recognize the September summit’s outcome\r\ndocument in itself to be the result of the summit of our\r\nheads of State and Government.\r\nFinally, with respect to draft resolution\r\nA/60/L.7*, we would like to express our reservation\r\nwith respect to the second preambular paragraph, not\r\nbecause of the substantive commitments it contains but\r\nbecause it explicitly refers to the final document of the\r\n2005 World Summit, which, as we have said, generates\r\nneither mandate nor obligation for our Republic. We\r\nwould like that reservation to be recorded in the record\r\nof this meeting.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly has thus\r\nconcluded this stage of its consideration of sub-item (a)\r\nof agenda item 48.\r\nMay I take it that is the wish of the General\r\nAssembly to conclude its consideration of sub-item (b)\r\nof agenda item 48?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 43 (continued)\r\nCulture of peace\r\nDraft resolutions (A/60/L.4/Rev.1 and L.10)\r\nThe Acting President: Members will recall that\r\nthe Assembly held the debate on agenda item 43 jointly\r\nwith agenda item 42 at its 35th and 36th plenary\r\nmeetings, on 20 October 2005.\r\nI give the floor to the representative of Pakistan\r\nto introduce draft resolution A/60/L.10.\r\nMr. Khokhar (Pakistan): I have the honour to\r\nintroduce, on behalf of the sponsors, the draft\r\nresolution entitled “Promotion of religious and cultural\r\nunderstanding, harmony and cooperation”, contained in\r\ndocument A/60/L.10.\r\nThe agenda item “Culture of peace” is\r\nreminiscent of the commitment made by us 60 years\r\nago, at the time of the adoption of the United Nations\r\nCharter, to practice tolerance and live together in peace\r\nwith one another as good neighbours, to unite our\r\nstrength to maintain international peace and security\r\nand to promote social progress and better standards of\r\nlife in larger freedom.\r\nThat pledge was reaffirmed in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration five years ago when world leaders resolved\r\nthat the fundamental values of freedom, equality,\r\nsolidarity and tolerance are essential in guiding\r\ninternational relations of the twenty-first century.\r\nHuman beings must respect one other, in all their\r\ndiversity of belief, culture and language. Differences\r\nwithin and between societies should be neither feared\r\nnor repressed, but cherished as a precious asset of\r\nhumanity.\r\nYet another manifestation of that resolve was the\r\nacknowledgement in the 2005 World Summit Outcome\r\nof the cultural and religious diversity of the world and\r\nthe commitment to promote international peace and\r\nsecurity by advancing human welfare, freedom and\r\nprogress and by encouraging tolerance, respect and\r\ndialogue among different cultures, civilizations and\r\npeoples.\r\nTo reaffirm those objectives and to launch a new\r\nera of hope and peaceful coexistence, the General\r\nAssembly adopted the Declaration on a Culture of\r\nPeace on 13 September 1999 (resolution 53/243A). The\r\nDeclaration is a set of values, attitudes and behaviour.\r\nIt builds upon the Charter-based principles of\r\nmultilateral cooperation and underscores respect for\r\nlife, ending of violence and the promotion and practice\r\nof non-violence through education, dialogue and\r\ncooperation, as well as commitment to the peaceful\r\nsettlement of conflicts.\r\nContrary to the expectations and hopes of our\r\ncommon humanity, the dawn of the new millennium\r\nwitnessed a profound transformation in international\r\nrelations. The dangerous confrontations of the cold war\r\nhave been replaced by the complex and equally\r\ndangerous realities of our world today. It is a world\r\nmarked on the one hand by intensifying globalization,\r\nwhich eliminates distances and brings people closer\r\n19\r\nA/60/PV.43\r\ntogether, and by terrorism, violence, poverty and\r\ndisease on the other.\r\nThe growing asymmetries in State power,\r\ndiscrimination in the dispensation of international\r\njustice, repression of people’s legitimate aspirations\r\nand increasing socio-economic disparities have\r\nprecipitated new threats to international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nWe are experiencing a serious decline in\r\nappreciation for, and the practice of, universal and\r\ncommon moral principles. Human history has reached\r\na crucial point where a choice has to be made between\r\na world characterized by peace and prosperity or one\r\nthat is torn by global conflict and disaster.\r\nWe are all aware that peace is inseparable from\r\nmutual tolerance and accommodation. The challenge\r\nwe face every day is to replace fear with acceptance,\r\nharassment with tolerance, and hatred with respect.\r\nCooperation — and not the clash of civilizations —\r\nmust be the paradigm for our collective endeavours.\r\nPromotion of understanding, harmony and cooperation\r\namong religions and cultures can lift the veil of\r\nignorance, the misconception and the prejudice that\r\nhave become so tragically pervasive in recent times.\r\nAll religions and cultures share a common set of\r\nuniversal values. Religion and culture, therefore, must\r\nnot be allowed to become a source of division, as they\r\nare sometimes portrayed. Instead we must cherish the\r\nunity and indivisibility of the human race no matter\r\nwhat religion or particular culture we belong to.\r\nWith that context in mind, Pakistan has tabled a\r\ndraft resolution in the General Assembly, for the third\r\nconsecutive year, entitled “Promotion of religious and\r\ncultural understanding, harmony and cooperation”.\r\nThe draft resolution recognizes that interreligious\r\ndialogue and understanding, including awareness of\r\ndifferences and commonalities among peoples and\r\ncivilizations, contribute to the peaceful resolution of\r\nconflicts and disputes and reduce the potential for\r\nviolence. It acknowledges the contribution of various\r\ninitiatives at the national, regional and international\r\nlevel, including Pakistan’s Enlightened Moderation, to\r\npromote mutual understanding and tolerance among the\r\npeoples of the world.\r\nWhile recognizing that the challenges of\r\nintolerance and conflict exist, create divides across\r\ncountries and regions and pose a threat to peaceful\r\nrelations among nations, the draft resolution\r\nemphasizes that all cultures and civilizations share a\r\ncommon set of universal values and can contribute to\r\nthe enrichment of humankind. Operative paragraph 15\r\nrequests the Secretary-General to ensure the widest\r\ndissemination of the relevant United Nations material\r\nrelated to the resolution in as many languages as\r\npossible through the United Nations system, including\r\nthe Information Centres.\r\nI take this opportunity to state that in addition to\r\nthe sponsors mentioned in the draft, Algeria, the\r\nDominican Republic, Indonesia, Kyrgyzstan, Spain,\r\nThailand, Turkey and Uzbekistan have also joined as\r\nsponsors.\r\nI am confident that the draft resolution, as in the\r\nprevious sessions, will be endorsed unanimously by the\r\nGeneral Assembly. That will be an affirmation by the\r\nmembers of the international community of its shared\r\ncommitment to advance the goals of universal\r\nunderstanding, harmony and peace, as well as security\r\nand prosperity among all nations and peoples of all\r\nfaiths and cultures.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\ntake a decision on draft resolutions A/60/L.4/Rev.1 and\r\nA/60/L.10.\r\nWe turn first to draft resolution A/60/L.4/Rev.1,\r\nentitled “Promotion of interreligious dialogue and\r\ncooperation on peace”.\r\nThe names of additional sponsors were read out\r\nby the representative of Pakistan. The following\r\ncountries have also added their names to the list:\r\nArgentina, Belize, Cambodia, Cameroon, Egypt, El\r\nSalvador, Guatemala, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Mongolia,\r\nSlovenia, the Sudan, Trinidad and Tobago and\r\nTurkmenistan.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/60/L.4/Rev.1?\r\nDraft resolution A/60/L.4/Rev.1 was adopted\r\n(resolution 60/10).\r\nThe Acting President: We turn next to draft\r\nresolution A/60/L.10, entitled “Promotion of religious\r\nand cultural understanding, harmony and cooperation”.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/60/L.10?\r\n20\r\nA/60/PV.43\r\nDraft resolution A/60/L.10 was adopted\r\n(resolution 60/11).\r\nThe Acting President: I call on the\r\nrepresentative of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,\r\nwho wishes to speak in explanation of position on the\r\nresolutions just adopted.\r\nMay I remind members that explanations of\r\nposition are limited to 10 minutes and should be made\r\nby delegations from their seats.\r\nMs. García-Matos (Bolivarian Republic of\r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): As we made clear\r\nduring our discussion of item 43, “Culture of peace”,\r\nlast week, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela\r\nreaffirms its commitment to the Global Agenda for\r\nDialogue among Civilizations and the Universal\r\nDeclaration on Cultural Diversity. We share the spirit\r\nand agree on the substance of those resolutions.\r\nHowever, we have reservations with regard to the\r\nfourth preambular paragraph of draft resolution\r\nA/60/L.10 and the third preambular paragraph of draft\r\nresolution A/60/L.4/Rev.1, not because of substantive\r\nissues, but because they refer to the 2005 World\r\nSummit Outcome document, which, as we have pointed\r\nelsewhere in this house, has no validity for our country.\r\nThat document, because of its sins of omission,\r\nprovides no mandate for and imposes no obligation on\r\nthe Republic.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the only\r\nspeaker in explanation of position.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the General\r\nAssembly to conclude its consideration of agenda item\r\n43?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President: I would like to inform members\r\nthat document A/INF/60/3/Rev.2, containing a revised\r\nprogramme of work and schedule of plenary meetings\r\nfor the months of November and December was issued\r\nthis morning. The revised document contains changes\r\nwith regard to the consideration of agenda item 14,\r\n“The situation in the Middle East”, and agenda item\r\n15, “Question of Palestine”.\r\nIn addition, the consideration of agenda item 49,\r\n“Information and communication technologies for\r\ndevelopment”, has been postponed to a later date.\r\nStatement by the President\r\nThe President: I would like to make a short\r\nstatement in connection with the Assembly’s\r\nconsideration of agenda item 49.\r\nPursuant to General Assembly resolution 56/183,\r\ndated 21 September 2001, the second phase of the\r\nWorld Summit on the Information Society will take\r\nplace in Tunis, Tunisia, from 16 to 18 November 2005.\r\nThe Summit, in both its Geneva and its Tunis phases, is\r\nan important event, and will be a major addition to the\r\nseries of high-level conferences held recently on\r\neconomic and social issues within the United Nations\r\nsystem.\r\nAt the world summit in September, our leaders\r\ncommitted themselves to the outcome document, inter\r\nalia, to building a people-centred and inclusive\r\ninformation society so as to enhance digital\r\nopportunities for all people in order to help bridge the\r\ndigital divide, putting the potential of information and\r\ncommunication technologies at the service of\r\ndevelopment and addressing new challenges of the\r\ninformation society by implementing the outcomes of\r\nthe Geneva phase of the World Summit on the\r\nInformation Society and ensuring the success of the\r\nsecond phase of the Summit, to be held in Tunis in\r\nNovember 2005.\r\nIn order to deliver on that commitment, I\r\nencourage Member States to participate at the highest\r\npossible level at the Tunis Summit from 16 to 18\r\nNovember 2005. Furthermore, I urge all Member States\r\nto intensify their efforts in order to conclude\r\nnegotiations on outstanding issues in the ongoing\r\npreparatory work for the Summit. It is, indeed,\r\nessential that the Summit reach consensual decisions,\r\nallowing us all to move ahead in this new era of high\r\ntechnology, with common objectives and enhanced\r\nmeans for achieving them.\r\nAs the purpose of this endeavour is to build a\r\npeople-centred and inclusive information society, the\r\npositive contribution to the Summit of all stakeholders,\r\nincluding civil society and the private sector, is also of\r\nparamount importance. I am confident that the\r\nmembers of the General Assembly are looking forward\r\nto receiving the report of the International\r\n21\r\nA/60/PV.43\r\nTelecommunications Union on the outcomes of the\r\nWorld Summit on the Information Society as soon as\r\npossible after the Summit.\r\nI would like to remind members that the list of\r\nspeakers for items listed in document A/INF/60/Rev.2\r\nis open.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11.45 p.m.\r\n"
