(Sweden)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 111 (continued)\r\nElection to fill vacancies in principal organs\r\n(c) Election of five members of the International\r\nCourt of Justice\r\nMemorandum by the Secretary-General\r\n(A/60/186)\r\nList of candidates (A/60/187 and Corr.1 and\r\nA/60/187/Add.1)\r\nCurricula vitae (A/60/188)\r\nThe President: The General Assembly will\r\nproceed to the election of five members of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice for a nine-year term of\r\noffice commencing on 6 February 2006. The terms of\r\noffice of the following judges expire on 5 February\r\n2006: Mr. Vladlen Vereshchetin (Russian Federation),\r\nMr. Pieter Kooijmans (Netherlands), Mr. Francisco\r\nRezek (Brazil), Mr. Thomas Buergenthal (United States\r\nof America) and Mr. Nabil Elaraby (Egypt).\r\nIn connection with the election, I should like to\r\nbring the following matters to the attention of the\r\nmembers of the General Assembly.\r\nI should like to confirm that, at this time, the\r\nSecurity Council, independently of the General\r\nAssembly, is also proceeding to elect five members of\r\nthe Court. This procedure is in accordance with Article\r\n8 of the Statute of the Court, which provides that\r\n“The General Assembly and the Security Council\r\nshall proceed independently of one another to\r\nelect the members of the Court.”\r\nAccordingly, the results of the voting in the General\r\nAssembly will be communicated to the Security\r\nCouncil only when five candidates have obtained the\r\nrequired majority in the Assembly.\r\nI should like to draw the attention of the\r\nAssembly to the documents relating to the election.\r\nDocument A/60/186 contains a memorandum by the\r\nSecretary-General on the present composition of the\r\nCourt and the procedure to be followed in the General\r\nAssembly and in the Security Council with regard to\r\nthe election. Document A/60/187 and corrigendum 1\r\ncontain the list of candidates nominated by national\r\ngroups.\r\nIn this connection, I have received information\r\nfrom the Legal Counsel that, after the established\r\ndeadline for nominating candidates, the following\r\nadditional submissions were received from several\r\nnational groups, all of which relate to the candidates\r\nalready nominated by other national groups appearing\r\nin documents A/60/187 and corrigendum 1: Mohamed\r\nBennouna (Morocco) has been nominated also by the\r\nnational group of Argentina and Jordan; Thomas\r\nBuergenthal (United States of America) has been\r\nnominated also by the national group of Germany, Peru\r\nand Romania; Julio D. González Campos (Spain) has\r\n2\r\nA/60/PV.44\r\nbeen nominated also by the national group of\r\nArgentina; Kenneth Keith (New Zealand) has been\r\nnominated also by the national group of Germany,\r\nLuxembourg and Papua New Guinea; Bernardo\r\nSepúlveda Amor (Mexico) has been nominated also by\r\nthe national group of Argentina, the Netherlands,\r\nPoland and Romania; and Leonid Skotnikov (Russian\r\nFederation) has been nominated also by the national\r\ngroup of Germany and Romania.\r\nI should also like to draw the attention of the\r\nAssembly to a note by the Secretary-General,\r\ncontained in an addendum to document A/60/187,\r\nwhich was issued this morning, in which he informs\r\nme that the national group of Niger decided to\r\nwithdraw its nomination of Mr. Seidou Adamou Mazou\r\nas a candidate.\r\nThe Assembly also has before it document\r\nA/60/188 and corrigendum 1, which contains the\r\ncurricula vitae of the candidates nominated by the\r\nnational groups.\r\nIn accordance with Article 10, paragraph 1, of the\r\nStatute of the Court, those candidates who obtain an\r\nabsolute majority of votes both in the General\r\nAssembly and in the Security Council shall be\r\nconsidered as elected.\r\nThe consistent practice of the United Nations has\r\nbeen to interpret the words “absolute majority” as\r\nmeaning a majority of all electors, whether or not they\r\nvote or are allowed to vote. The electors in the General\r\nAssembly are all 191 Member States. Accordingly, for\r\nthe present election, 96 votes constitute an absolute\r\nmajority in the General Assembly.\r\nPursuant to rule 151 of the rules of procedure of\r\nthe Assembly, if in the first ballot the number of\r\ncandidates obtaining an absolute majority is less than\r\nfive, a second ballot will be held and balloting will\r\ncontinue at the same meeting until five candidates have\r\nobtained the required majority.\r\nAt its 915th meeting, on 16 November 1960, the\r\nGeneral Assembly decided that ballots shall be\r\nunrestricted. That decision has been followed\r\nconsistently.\r\nI should like to bring another matter to the\r\nattention of the General Assembly. Cases have arisen\r\nin the Security Council in which more than the\r\nrequired number of candidates have obtained an\r\nabsolute majority on the same ballot. The same also\r\noccurred in the General Assembly, at the 45th plenary\r\nmeeting of the fifty-fourth session, on 3 November\r\n1999.\r\nBoth organs decided to hold a new ballot on all\r\nthe candidates, and no notification to the President of\r\nthe other organ was made until only the required\r\nnumber of candidates, and no more, had obtained an\r\nabsolute majority.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly agrees to\r\nthe same procedure should the case arise at this\r\nelection?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I should like to remind\r\nrepresentatives that, pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of\r\nprocedure,\r\n“After the President has announced the\r\nbeginning of voting, no representative shall\r\ninterrupt the voting except on a point of order in\r\nconnection with the actual conduct of the voting.”\r\nAny announcements, including those concerning\r\nwithdrawals of candidatures, should therefore be made\r\nprior to the commencement of the voting process, that\r\nis to say before the announcement of the beginning of\r\nthe voting process.\r\nI should like to seek the usual cooperation of\r\nrepresentatives during the time of the conduct of the\r\nelection. Please be reminded that during the voting\r\nprocess all campaigning should cease in the General\r\nAssembly Hall. This means in particular that once the\r\nelection has begun no more campaign material can be\r\ndistributed inside the Hall. All representatives are also\r\nrequested to remain at their seats so that the voting\r\nprocess can proceed in an orderly manner. I thank\r\nrepresentatives in advance for their cooperation.\r\nWe shall now begin the voting process. Ballot\r\npapers will now be distributed.\r\nRepresentatives are requested to use only the\r\nballot papers now being distributed. Only those\r\ncandidates whose names appear on the ballot papers\r\nare eligible. Representatives will indicate the five\r\ncandidates for whom they wish to vote by placing\r\ncrosses to the left of their names on the ballot papers.\r\nBallot papers on which more than five names are\r\nmarked will be considered invalid. Votes may be cast\r\nonly for those whose names appear on the ballot\r\npapers.\r\n3\r\nA/60/PV.44\r\nAt the invitation of the President, Ms. Tapiwa\r\nMongwa (Botswana), Ms. Petra Ali Doláková\r\n(Czech Republic), Ms. Noemi Strauss\r\n(Liechtenstein), Mr. Vince Sinning (Marshall\r\nIslands), Mr. Ram Babu Dhakal (Nepal) and\r\nMrs. Elda Cepeda (Dominican Republic) acted as\r\ntellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 10.30 a.m. and\r\nresumed at 12 noon.\r\nThe President: The result of the voting is as\r\nfollows:\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 190\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 190\r\nAbstentions: 0\r\nNumber of members voting: 190\r\nRequired absolute majority: 96\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nMr. Bernardo Sepúlveda Amor \r\n(Mexico): 147\r\nMr. Leonid Skotnikov (Russian \r\nFederation): 145\r\nMr. Kenneth Keith (New Zealand): 143\r\nMr. Thomas Buergenthal (United \r\nStates of America): 141\r\nMr. Mohamed Bennouna (Morocco): 138\r\nMr. Julio D.

Pursuant to the decision\r\ntaken by the General Assembly at the 45th plenary\r\nmeeting of its fifty-fourth session on 3 November 1999\r\nand in accordance with the decision taken at the\r\nbeginning of this meeting, a new ballot will be held\r\nuntil only the required number of candidates — that is,\r\nfive and no more — obtains an absolute majority.\r\nWe shall therefore proceed to another unrestricted\r\nballot to fill the five vacancies.\r\nWe shall now begin the voting process. Ballot\r\npapers will now be distributed.\r\nAll the candidates whose names appear on the\r\nballot paper are eligible. May I once again remind\r\nrepresentatives that the names of only five candidates\r\nshould be marked with a cross. Ballot papers on which\r\nmore than five names are marked will be considered\r\ninvalid. Votes may be cast only for those whose names\r\nappear on the ballot papers.\r\nAt the invitation of the President, Mr. Koffi\r\nGaston Yao (Côte d’Ivoire), Ms. Petra Ali\r\nDoláková (Czech Republic), Mrs. Elda Cepeda\r\n(Dominican Republic), Ms. Noemi Strauss\r\n(Liechtenstein), Mr. Vince Sinning (Marshall\r\nIslands) and Mr. Ram Babu Dhakal (Nepal) acted\r\nas tellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 12.15 p.m. and\r\nresumed at 1 p.m.\r\nThe President: The result of the voting is as\r\nfollows:\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 186\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 186\r\nAbstentions: 0\r\nNumber of members voting: 186\r\nRequired absolute majority: 96\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nMr. Leonid Skotnikov (Russian\r\nFederation): 151\r\nMr. Bernardo Sepúlveda Amor \r\n(Mexico): 150\r\nMr. Kenneth Keith (New Zealand): 147\r\nMr. Mohamed Bennouna (Morocco): 138\r\nMr. Thomas Buergenthal (United\r\nStates of America): 136\r\nMr. Julio D.

Pursuant to the decision\r\ntaken by the General Assembly at the 45th plenary\r\nmeeting of its fifty-fourth session, held on 3 November\r\n1999, and in accordance with the decision taken at the\r\nbeginning of this meeting, a new ballot will be held\r\nuntil only the required number of candidates — that is,\r\nfive and no more — obtains an absolute majority.\r\nIn view of the lateness of the hour and the\r\npossible need for deliberations, further balloting will\r\nbe postponed until later this afternoon.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 1.05 p.m\r\n4\r\nA/60/PV.44\r\nMr. Cabral (Guinea-Bissau), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nThe meeting resumed at 3.10 p.m.\r\nThe Acting President: We will proceed to\r\nanother unrestricted ballot to fill the five vacancies.\r\nI should like to inform representatives that the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly has received two\r\nletters dated today, Monday, 7 November 2005,\r\ninforming him that the national group of Sweden and\r\nTunisia wishes to withdraw the candidature of\r\nMr. Abdelfattah Amor.\r\nAs Mr. Abdelfattah Amor was nominated by only\r\nthat one national group, he is, therefore, no longer a\r\ncandidate. His name should be deleted from the ballot\r\npaper.\r\nThe ballots which will be distributed shortly will\r\nreflect that withdrawal.\r\nWe shall now begin the voting process. Ballot\r\npapers will now be distributed.\r\nAll the candidates whose names appear on the\r\nballot paper are eligible.
