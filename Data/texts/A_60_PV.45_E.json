(Sweden)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 18\r\nNecessity of ending the economic, commercial and\r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of\r\nAmerica against Cuba\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/60/213)\r\nDraft resolution (A/60/L.9)\r\nMr. Neil (Jamaica): I speak on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China. The Group of 77 and China is\r\nopposed to unilateral, coercive measures against\r\ndeveloping countries. The most prominent example is\r\nthe one we are discussing today: the economic,\r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the\r\nUnited States against Cuba, an embargo that has been\r\nin place for over 40 years, despite overwhelming\r\nopposition in the international community.\r\nAt the Second South Summit, held in Doha in\r\nJune of this year, heads of State and Government of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China issued a strong call for the\r\nending of the embargo. The leaders rejected the\r\nimposition of laws and regulations with extraterritorial\r\nimpact and all other forms of coercive economic\r\nmeasures, including unilateral sanctions against\r\ndeveloping countries, and reiterated the urgent need to\r\neliminate them immediately.\r\nThey called on the Government of the United\r\nStates to put an end to the economic, commercial and\r\nfinancial embargo against Cuba, which is unilateral and\r\nwhich is contrary to the Charter of the United Nations,\r\nto international law and to the principle of good\r\nneighbourliness. They also recognized that the\r\nembargo has caused huge material losses and economic\r\ndamage to the people of Cuba.\r\nThe leaders therefore called for compliance with\r\nthe resolutions of the General Assembly and rejected\r\nthe new measures recently implemented by the United\r\nStates Government aimed at tightening the embargo as\r\na violation of Cuba’s sovereignty and the rights of its\r\npeople.\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations calls on all\r\nStates to promote friendly relations and cooperation\r\nand to respect international law, the sovereign equality\r\nof States, the self-determination of peoples and the\r\npeaceful settlement of disputes. Adherence to those\r\nprinciples will contribute to the elimination of tension\r\nand confrontation between States. The United States\r\nand Cuba are two countries whose destinies are linked\r\nby history and geography and it should follow that the\r\nembargo and coercive measures should be replaced by\r\ndialogue and cooperation.\r\nThe people of Cuba are making great efforts to\r\npromote social and economic development in the face\r\nof considerable obstacles resulting from the embargo,\r\nwhich has caused them untold hardships. The\r\noppressive measures against Cuba are contrary to\r\ncommitments in the global partnership to support the\r\ndevelopment efforts of developing countries and are in\r\ncontradiction with the principles of the multilateral\r\n2\r\nA/60/PV.45\r\ntrading system. They distort the normal flow of\r\ncommercial transactions and investment and constitute\r\na serious threat to the freedom of trade and navigation.\r\nThe difficulties facing Cuba have been\r\ncompounded by severe losses and damage resulting\r\nfrom a series of hurricanes that struck the country last\r\nyear, as well as this year, as well as even in recent\r\nweeks. The Government and the people of Cuba should\r\nreceive the support of the wider international\r\ncommunity to cope with these setbacks.\r\nThe Group of 77 and China calls on the United\r\nStates to heed the voice of the international community\r\nto put an end to the embargo and to move towards a\r\nprocess of normalization of relations through peaceful\r\nnegotiations with Cuba, based on the principles of\r\nmutual respect and non-interference in the internal\r\naffairs of States.\r\nThe Group of 77 and China supports the draft\r\nresolution contained in document A/60/L.9, which is\r\nnow before the General Assembly, and we urge its\r\nadoption.\r\nMr. Hunte (Saint Lucia): The Caribbean\r\nCommunity (CARICOM) aligns itself with the\r\nstatement just made by the Permanent Representative\r\nof Jamaica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. In\r\nthe light of the importance of this issue to the\r\nCaribbean region, I address the Assembly on behalf of\r\nthe States members of the Caribbean Community.\r\nThe relevant provisions of the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations emphasize the importance of respect\r\nfor the sovereign equality of States, non-interference in\r\ntheir internal affairs, the self-determination of peoples,\r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes and the\r\nmaintenance of friendly relations among States. For\r\nsmall States such as those in the Caribbean region,\r\nthose principles are paramount and, along with other\r\nimportant provisions, constitute the rule of law of the\r\ninternational community. These are principles that have\r\nbeen repeatedly reaffirmed, most recently in the 2005\r\nsummit of heads of State or Government.\r\nIt is from this principled perspective that we\r\ncontinue to oppose the imposition of unilateral punitive\r\nmeasures and, in particular, the extraterritorial\r\napplication of legislation, which constitutes a violation\r\nof international law. In this vein, freedom of trade and\r\nnavigation is a critical component of global commerce,\r\nand undue restrictions are inconsistent with the\r\npromotion of free and fair trade, which is essential to\r\nthe sustainable development of small States such as\r\nthose in the Caribbean Community.\r\nCuba, as an integral part of the pan-Caribbean\r\nprocess, is a country with which CARICOM maintains\r\nclose relations and well-established programmes of\r\ncooperation at various levels in trade and in the fight\r\nagainst HIV/AIDS, among other areas. CARICOM\r\nStates look forward to further advancing our work\r\nprogrammes for CARICOM-Cuba cooperation.\r\nCARICOM relations with Cuba are based on a strong\r\nrecognition of the need and the commitment to pursue\r\nthe acceleration of the process of integration of the\r\ngreater Caribbean, with the aim of increasing the\r\ninternational competitiveness and spurring the\r\ndevelopment of the entire region.\r\nIn this light, the Government of Cuba has\r\ncontinued its assistance to the Caribbean Community\r\nthrough the assignment of medical and other health-\r\ncare personnel, who are able to lend important\r\nassistance during natural disasters. Further, Cuba\r\ncontinues to provide scholarships to many students in\r\nCARICOM countries, thus contributing significantly to\r\nthe human resource development of the people of our\r\nregion.\r\nCuba is an integral part of the Caribbean region\r\nand threatens no one. On the contrary, its commitment\r\nto the social and economic development of the\r\nCaribbean is unquestionable. CARICOM continues to\r\nreiterate its unwavering support for the right of the\r\nCuban people to choose their own Government and for\r\nthat Government to carry out the mandate of the people\r\nin a manner beneficial to their social and economic\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe embargo imposed against Cuba has been\r\nwith us too long. Let me underscore this again: the\r\nembargo imposed against Cuba has been with us too\r\nlong, and serves no other purpose than to preserve a\r\nstate of tension between two neighbouring countries,\r\nresulting only in the imposition of significant hardship\r\nand suffering on the people of Cuba.\r\nIt is all the more regrettable that such measures\r\ncontinue to be unilaterally applied and enhanced at a\r\ncritical time when the people of Cuba, the wider\r\nCaribbean and parts of North America have suffered\r\nand continue to suffer from the devastation caused by\r\nseveral hurricanes which have struck in recent months.\r\nThese disasters have underscored the need for regional\r\n3\r\nA/60/PV.45\r\nand international cooperation and solidarity and have\r\ncreated a heightened awareness of the fact that punitive\r\nmeasures such as the economic embargo are having a\r\ndetrimental humanitarian effect on the people of Cuba.\r\nThe Caribbean Community enjoys friendly\r\nrelations with the United States. In this spirit, we urge\r\nthe United States Government to respect the will of the\r\ninternational community, to put an end to the embargo\r\nand to engage in constructive dialogue and a\r\nnormalization of relations with Cuba. Such a step\r\nwould remove a source of tension and conflict and\r\nsignificantly enhance the prospects for peace, poverty\r\nalleviation, development and cooperation within the\r\nhemisphere of the Americas.\r\nAccordingly, CARICOM delegations support the\r\ncontent of the draft resolution before the General\r\nAssembly (A/60/L.9) and will vote in support of its\r\nadoption.\r\nMr. Berruga (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): Just a\r\nfew weeks ago, heads of State or Government of the\r\nStates Members of the Organization came to the\r\nGeneral Assembly to reiterate the vital importance of\r\nan effective multilateral system and to reaffirm their\r\ncommitment to promote and strengthen the\r\neffectiveness of the United Nations through the\r\nimplementation of its decisions and resolutions.\r\nMexico hopes that the renewed commitment to\r\nthe future of our Organization will be genuinely\r\ntranslated into the implementation of such resolutions,\r\nespecially those that have been consistently flouted in\r\ndefiance of the majority view of the international\r\ncommunity. It is important to acknowledge that the\r\nabsence of progress and the failure to implement\r\ncollective appeals harm the efforts to strengthen\r\nmultilateralism to which we are all committed.\r\nFrom this lofty international rostrum, Mexico\r\nreiterates its rejection of the application of unilateral\r\nlaws and measures of economic blockade against any\r\nState, as well as the use of coercive measures without\r\nthe authority embodied in the Charter of the United\r\nNations. Along with their humanitarian consequences,\r\nsuch measures are contrary to international law and\r\nultimately represent the gradual abandonment of\r\ndiplomacy and dialogue as the means to settle disputes\r\namong States.\r\nMexico believes that all States should be able to\r\nrely on a system of norms that is fully respected and\r\nagreed by all. The peaceful and orderly international\r\ncoexistence to which we all aspire rests on that\r\nassumption. My delegation therefore reiterates that any\r\npolitical, economic and military sanction imposed on\r\nStates can stem only from the decisions or\r\nrecommendations of the Security Council or the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nFor those reasons, my delegation rejects the\r\nUnited States economic, commercial and financial\r\nblockade of Cuba and has consistently supported all\r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions to put an end to it. In\r\nline with that objective, Mexico has taken and will\r\ncontinue to take national measures and has promoted\r\nregional actions to counteract the extraterritorial\r\neffects of any foreign law or regulation affecting free\r\ntrade and violating international law to the detriment of\r\nany State.\r\nMexico actively promotes its economic ties with\r\nCuba. As a matter of principle, but also in practice, we\r\nreject any extraterritorial attempt to apply national\r\nlaws that affect the relations and transactions of third\r\nStates.\r\nThe Mexican Government has also consistently\r\nopposed Cuba’s economic and political-diplomatic\r\nisolation. Mexico has firmly supported the accession of\r\nCuba to all regional integration mechanisms, including\r\nits participation in the Ibero-American Summits and its\r\nformal adherence to the Latin American Integration\r\nAssociation.\r\nAt this session of the General Assembly, Mexico\r\nwill reiterate for the fourteenth time its support for the\r\ndraft resolution on lifting the United States economic\r\nblockade of Cuba, since unilateral measures affecting\r\nthe sovereignty and freedom of trade of States\r\ncontravene our foreign policy principles and the spirit\r\nof the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nFor all those reasons, Mexico will vote in favour\r\nof the draft resolution contained in document A/60/L.9.\r\nMs. Bai Yongjie (China) (spoke in Chinese): The\r\nChinese delegation supports the statement made by the\r\nrepresentative of Jamaica on behalf of the Group of 77\r\nand China.\r\nNot long ago, the heads of State and Government\r\nof the world gathered in New York, where they\r\nearnestly reaffirmed their commitment to the purposes\r\nand principles of the United Nations Charter and\r\ninternational law and to the fulfilment in good faith of\r\n4\r\nA/60/PV.45\r\nthe obligations assumed in accordance with the\r\nCharter, and reiterated their resolve to implement the\r\ndecisions and resolutions of the United Nations in an\r\neffort to strengthen the effectiveness of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nRegrettably, however, in spite of the fact that our\r\ndiscussion of this agenda item has entered its\r\nfourteenth year, the previous 13 resolutions urging all\r\ncountries to abide by the Charter of the United Nations\r\nand principles of international law and to withdraw or\r\nnullify any laws and measures with extraterritorial\r\nlegal effects that infringe on the legitimate rights and\r\ninterests of entities and individuals within the\r\nsovereignty and jurisdiction of other States and impede\r\nthe freedom of trade or navigation, have yet to be\r\nimplemented by the State concerned.\r\nThe 40-year embargo and sanctions imposed by\r\nthe United States against Cuba have jeopardized the\r\ninterests of Cuba and other countries and severely\r\nobstructed international development. Moreover, they\r\nalso run counter to the principles of democracy,\r\nfreedom, the rule of law and human rights and will\r\nnever achieve the professed policy objectives for which\r\nthey were imposed. We hope that the State concerned\r\nwill heed the just calls of the international community\r\nand change its wrongful conduct as soon as possible.\r\nThe issue of development figures prominently in\r\nthe outcome document of this year’s summit. In order\r\nto ensure the timely achievement of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, the developing countries have\r\nundertaken to formulate and implement national\r\ndevelopment strategies, while the international\r\ncommunity has promised to provide more support in\r\nsuch areas as finance, debt, markets and technology so\r\nas to help the developing countries in their\r\ndevelopment efforts. While the entire international\r\ncommunity is mobilized to help the developing\r\ncountries realize the Goals, the United States has made\r\nno move to change its policy of embargo. Cuba has\r\nnever received any of the support it deserves from the\r\nlargest developed country in the world and a so-called\r\npartner for development. Moreover, even its normal\r\neconomic, business and financial contacts have been\r\narbitrarily cut off. All of this has inflicted enormous\r\neconomic damage on Cuba, seriously impeded its\r\neconomic and social development, and directly affected\r\nthe normal foreign economic exchanges of other\r\ncountries.\r\nThe United States embargo of Cuba is a violation\r\nof the principles of democracy, freedom, the rule of\r\nlaw and human rights — principles of which the United\r\nStates has always claimed to be a champion. First, any\r\nattempt to use embargoes and sanctions to coerce a\r\ncountry to abandon the development path it has chosen\r\nof its own free will, and even to overthrow its\r\nGovernment, constitutes a mockery of the principles of\r\ndemocracy and freedom. The United States embargo of\r\nCuba is also a violation of the rules of international\r\ntrade and contradicts the principle of trade\r\nliberalization advocated by the United States itself.\r\nSecondly, the United States embargo of Cuba is a\r\ngross violation of the purposes and principles of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter and the fundamental norms\r\ngoverning contemporary international relations. Its\r\nextraterritorial nature is a violation of international\r\nlaw. That inevitably diminishes the credibility of the\r\nUnited States calls on other countries to strengthen the\r\nrule of law.\r\nThirdly, the United States embargo and sanctions\r\nagainst Cuba seriously impede and hamper the efforts\r\nof the Cuban people in nation-building, the elimination\r\nof poverty, and the improvement of living standards,\r\nand consequently jeopardize their rights to survival and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nLastly, in justifying the embargo, the\r\nrepresentative of the United States has said on\r\nnumerous occasions that the purpose of the embargo is\r\nto compel Cuba to promote democracy and human\r\nrights and to implement economic reforms because\r\nCuba has made no substantial progress in those areas.\r\nIf we follow the logic of that argument, we find only\r\nthat the policy the United States has pursued for over\r\n40 years has been ineffective. It is therefore advisable\r\nfor the United States actively to develop economic\r\nexchanges with Cuba as a way to attain its policy\r\nobjectives.\r\nThe United States representative once declared\r\nthat this is an issue between the United States and\r\nCuba and should not be subject to deliberation by the\r\nGeneral Assembly. The truth is that nearly 80 countries\r\nhave suffered economic losses due to the United States\r\nembargo and sanctions against Cuba. The international\r\ncommunity therefore has every right to raise grave\r\nconcerns over the embargo and sanctions and to\r\ndemand an immediate end to those practices.\r\n5\r\nA/60/PV.45\r\nThe Chinese Government has always upheld the\r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter,\r\nstood for sovereign equality and non-interference in the\r\ninternal affairs of other countries, and striven to\r\npromote democracy and the rule of law in international\r\nrelations. We firmly hold that countries should choose\r\ntheir own political, economic and social system, as\r\nwell as their mode of development on the basis of their\r\nparticular circumstances. We believe that differences\r\nand disputes between countries should be resolved\r\nthrough dialogue and cooperation based on equality\r\nand mutual respect.\r\nTherefore, the Chinese Government is opposed to\r\nthe economic, commercial and financial embargo and\r\nsanctions imposed by the United States against Cuba\r\nand supports the efforts of the Government and the\r\npeople of Cuba to defend their national independence\r\nand sovereignty. We hope that the Government of the\r\nUnited States will go with the tide of the times,\r\nreplacing confrontation with dialogue and replacing\r\nembargoes and sanctions with contacts and exchanges,\r\nthus effectively implementing the relevant United\r\nNations resolutions. China therefore supports the draft\r\nresolution submitted by Cuba under this agenda item.\r\nMr. Manongi (United Republic of Tanzania):\r\nTanzania associates itself with the statement made\r\nearlier by the representative of Jamaica on behalf of\r\nthe Group of 77 and China.\r\nTanzania is concerned to note that the economic\r\nembargo against Cuba, which has been in place for\r\nmore than four decades, has had a considerable\r\nnegative impact on the economic, political and social\r\nlife of the Cuban people. In our view, the continuance\r\nof the embargo against Cuba is contrary to the\r\ncommitment to a wider global partnership in support of\r\nthe development efforts of developing countries. The\r\nembargo has placed an enormous burden of sacrifice on\r\nthe Cuban people and has caused the Cuban economy\r\nto lose more than $70 billion, including lost export\r\nearnings and additional import costs. We are convinced\r\nthat a lifting of the blockade against Cuba would help\r\nto improve the situation in the region and further\r\nintegrate Cuba into the mainstream of international\r\neconomic relations, thereby promoting the economic\r\nand social well-being of its people.\r\nAt a time when Africa was struggling for its\r\nindependence and liberation and was struggling against\r\napartheid, we counted Cuba as one of our strongest\r\nallies. For us, the bonds forged during that struggle\r\ndemand that we now stand in support of the Cuban\r\npeople in their hour of need. The embargo against\r\nCuba is a burden that the people of Cuba should not\r\nhave to endure, and it is an undertaking whose\r\ntermination we support.\r\nLike many other countries, we are concerned that\r\nthe sanctions imposed under the Helms-Burton Act\r\nexceed the jurisdiction of national legislation and\r\nencroach upon the sovereignty of other States that deal\r\nwith Cuba. We therefore deem it incompatible with the\r\nprinciple of the sovereign equality of States. The\r\nextraterritorial nature of the embargo continues to\r\ncause considerable damage to Cuba, as well as to third\r\ncountries that are prevented from taking full advantage\r\nof the opportunities offered by the Cuban economy.\r\nIn that regard, Tanzania reaffirms its continued\r\nsupport, cooperation and solidarity with regard to the\r\npeople of Cuba and supports the draft resolution\r\nsubmitted to the Assembly for adoption. In view of the\r\nfact that the embargo has caused significant suffering\r\non the part of the people of Cuba, we call on the United\r\nStates Government to end the embargo and normalize\r\nits relations with Cuba, in the interests of all the people\r\nof Cuba and of the United States.\r\nMr. Hamidon (Malaysia): At the outset,\r\nMalaysia wishes to associate itself with the statement\r\nmade earlier by the representative of Jamaica on behalf\r\nof the Group of 77 and China. We would also like to\r\nthank the Secretary-General for his important report\r\n(A/60/213) on this agenda item.\r\nSince its forty-seventh session, in 1992, the\r\nGeneral Assembly has repeatedly declared its rejection\r\nof the use of unilateral measures by one Member State\r\nto effect political change in another — in this case, the\r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed\r\nby the United States of America against Cuba. The\r\nAssembly’s adoption of resolution 59/11 on 28 October\r\n2004, with 179 Member States voting in favour, once\r\nagain unambiguously reflected the position of an\r\noverwhelming majority of members of the United\r\nNations — a position that rejects the embargo and calls\r\nfor its immediate termination.\r\nThe application by the United States of America\r\nof laws — in particular extraterritorial legislation such\r\nas the Torricelli Act and the Helms-Burton Act — and\r\nmeasures such as those implemented since 30 June\r\n2004 based on the recommendations of the\r\n6\r\nA/60/PV.45\r\nCommission for Assistance to a Free Cuba, are clearly\r\nformulated with the sole intention of hurting Cuba and\r\nthe Cuban people, including the most vulnerable\r\namong them: children, women, the elderly and the\r\ninfirm. They are also clearly aimed at limiting Cuba’s\r\naccess to markets, capital, technology and investment\r\nin order to exert pressure on Cuba to change its\r\norientation and its political and socio-economic\r\nsystems.\r\nWe view those actions as not consistent with the\r\nuniversally accepted principles of international law, the\r\nCharter of the United Nations, the principles of the\r\nWorld Trade Organization and the relevant United\r\nNations resolutions. In addition, they are provocative\r\nand extremely discriminatory in nature, and they\r\nundermine the principles of the sovereign equality of\r\nStates, fundamental human rights and the spirit of\r\npeaceful coexistence and good-neighbourliness among\r\nStates.\r\nMalaysia remains fundamentally opposed to all\r\nforms of economic, commercial and financial sanctions\r\nand embargoes that contradict the norms of\r\ninternational law and run counter to the principles and\r\npurposes of the United Nations. Such actions also\r\ncontradict the Declaration on Principles of\r\nInternational Law concerning Friendly Relations and\r\nCooperation among States in accordance with the\r\nCharter of the United Nations (resolution 2625 (XXV),\r\nannex), adopted on 24 October 1970 by the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nWe are particularly opposed to the continued\r\nunilateral application of the coercive economic,\r\ncommercial and financial embargo against Cuba. The\r\nembargo imposed by the United States against Cuba is\r\nnot only a violation of international law, but — as\r\nconfirmed and documented by various reports —\r\nviolates the rights of the people of Cuba and impedes\r\ntheir right to enjoy life, economic well-being and\r\ndevelopment itself. The embargo has caused\r\ntremendous socio-economic damage to the country.\r\nThe direct cost to date to the Cuban people is estimated\r\nat more than $82 billion. The embargo has further\r\naggravated the hardship of the people of Cuba, more\r\nthan two thirds of whom have lived all their lives under\r\nthe dark cloud of the unilateral embargo and sanctions\r\nregime imposed by the United States.\r\nIn that regard, my delegation would like to appeal\r\nonce again to the United States, as a staunch advocate\r\nof free trade, human rights and good relations among\r\nnations, to respect the Charter of the United Nations\r\nand the norms and principles of international law. We\r\nthus call on the United States to rethink its overall\r\napproach towards Cuba and to change its policy from\r\none of isolating its small neighbour to one of dialogue\r\nand accommodation. It is also our fervent hope that in\r\nthe new spirit of the times — which promotes dialogue\r\nand understanding in a world of increasing\r\ninterdependence and globalization — the United States\r\nof America will be able to reorient its policy on Cuba\r\nin a more realistic direction and place its relationship\r\nwith its smaller neighbour on a new footing. We thus\r\nurge the United States of America to end its current\r\npolicy and to engage in serious dialogue to resolve its\r\nproblems with Cuba.\r\nI believe that this will be the fifteenth\r\nconsecutive year that the General Assembly will adopt\r\nthe resolution by an overwhelming majority, reflecting\r\nonce again the international community’s total\r\nrejection of the unilateral measures imposed by the\r\nUnited States against Cuba. That rejection was\r\nreaffirmed in the Final Document of the thirteenth\r\nConference of Heads of State or Government of the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement (NAM) in Kuala Lumpur in\r\nFebruary 2003 and also reiterated by the ministers of\r\nforeign affairs of NAM at its their fourteenth\r\nministerial conference, held in Durban, South Africa,\r\nin August 2004. It was also reflected in the declaration\r\nof the Second South Summit in Doha in June 2005. We\r\nthus urge the international community to continue to\r\nmake serious efforts to bring about an end to the\r\nunilateral economic, commercial and financial embargo\r\nimposed on Cuba.\r\nMalaysia maintains excellent relations with both\r\nthe United States and Cuba. Malaysia believes that its\r\nrelations with Cuba, especially in the fields of\r\neconomy and trade, would be further enhanced in the\r\nabsence of the unilateral embargo imposed against\r\nCuba. In that regard, Malaysia once again reaffirms its\r\ncommitment to respecting the fundamental principles\r\nof sovereign equality among States, non-interference in\r\ntheir internal affairs and freedom of international trade\r\nand navigation. Malaysia thus joins the call of the\r\ninternational community for an immediate cessation of\r\nthe embargo on Cuba, which violates all the\r\nfundamental principles of international and\r\nhumanitarian law.\r\n7\r\nA/60/PV.45\r\nWe note, however, that in spite of all the\r\nobstacles and impairments, including natural disasters\r\nand such catastrophes as hurricanes, drought and, most\r\nrecently, the rising price of oil, as well as those that\r\nhave been caused by the economic, trade and financial\r\nembargo imposed on Cuba for more than 44 years,\r\nCuba, through its own tenacity and renowned\r\nresilience, and working under the permanent slogan “A\r\nbetter life for all with the support of all”, has managed\r\non its own to achieve three sets of targets in the\r\nMillennium Development Goals: universal primary\r\neducation, the promotion of gender equality and the\r\nempowering of women, and a reduction in child\r\nmortality. Cuba has made significant progress on the\r\nother targets, too. We are confident that, without the\r\nembargo, Cuba would have been able to achieve all the\r\ntargets of the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nMalaysia once again reaffirms its strongest\r\ncommitment to the full respect for the fundamental\r\nprinciples of the sovereign equality of States and non-\r\ninterference in their internal affairs. In order to uphold\r\nthose sacrosanct principles of international law,\r\nMalaysia, as in previous years, will not waver from its\r\nprincipled position and would like to reaffirm its\r\nsolidarity with Cuba and its people by supporting and\r\nvoting in favour of draft resolution A/60/L.9.\r\nMr. Mabhongo (South Africa): My delegation\r\nassociates itself with the statement made by the\r\nrepresentative of Jamaica on behalf of the Group of 77\r\nand China.\r\nSouth Africa consistently opposes all aspects of\r\nthe embargo imposed by the United States against\r\nCuba. We view the continued imposition of an\r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo as a\r\nviolation of the principles of the sovereign equality of\r\nStates and non-intervention and non-interference in\r\neach other’s domestic affairs. We are guided by the\r\nnorms of international law and conduct in our\r\nprincipled support for the need to eliminate economic\r\nmeasures as a means of political and economic\r\ncoercion. We believe that constructive dialogue can\r\nfoster mutual trust and understanding, as well as\r\nengender harmony and peaceful coexistence between\r\nnations.\r\nMr. Martirosyan (Armenia), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nSouth Africa is committed to working towards a\r\nbetter world for all in which all nations, big and small,\r\ncoexist peacefully. The achievement of such peaceful\r\ncoexistence amongst nations requires adherence to\r\ninternational law by all nations. The need to respect\r\ninternational law in the conduct of international\r\nrelations has been recognized by most members of this\r\nbody, as evidenced by the growing support for the draft\r\nresolution that we are considering today.\r\nThe United States action against Cuba has lasted\r\nfor 47 years, with 70 per cent of Cubans having been\r\nborn under the embargo. Yet the long-standing\r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo has been\r\nconsistently rejected by a growing number of States\r\nMembers of the United Nations to a point where\r\nopposition has become almost unanimous.\r\nFurthermore, the heads of State and Government\r\nof the Group of 77 and China, meeting at the Second\r\nSouth Summit in Doha, Qatar, in June 2005,\r\nrecognized that the embargo against Cuba has caused a\r\nhigh degree of economic and financial damage, which\r\nhas negatively impacted on the welfare and well-being\r\nof the people of Cuba. In that regard, they condemned\r\nthe use of coercive economic measures designed to\r\nprevent countries from exercising their right to decide\r\ntheir own political, economic and social systems, and\r\nthey also called on all countries not to recognize\r\nunilateral, extraterritorial laws enacted to impose\r\nsanctions on other States and foreign companies.\r\nIn conclusion, South Africa will support draft\r\nresolution A/60/L.9 before us today. We do so because\r\nthe United States relentless and unilateral action has\r\ncaused untold suffering to the people of Cuba and is in\r\ncontradiction of international law. In supporting the\r\ndraft resolution, we also join the majority of States\r\nMembers of the United Nations that have decided to\r\ntake a common and principled stand on an issue of\r\nsuch importance.\r\nMr. Le Luong Minh (Viet Nam): The\r\nVietnamese delegation totally shares the views of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China set out in the statement\r\ndelivered by the representative of Jamaica on behalf of\r\nthe Group.\r\nEvery year for the past 14 years, the General\r\nAssembly, by a consistently overwhelming majority,\r\nhas adopted a resolution calling for an end to the\r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed\r\nby the United States of America on Cuba. Last year,\r\n179 Member States voted in favour of such a\r\nresolution. Unfortunately, the United States has not\r\n8\r\nA/60/PV.45\r\nonly continued with the embargo, but also tightened it\r\nby introducing additional measures, such as restrictions\r\non travel and money transfers to Cuba. The embargo,\r\nalready the longest in history, is being prolonged,\r\ncausing great damage to the economy of Cuba and\r\nuntold suffering to the people of Cuba, and influencing\r\nthird countries’ decisions. In fact, as reported by the\r\nGovernment of Cuba, the accumulated direct damages\r\nto the Cuban economy brought about by the embargo\r\nover the past four decades amount to approximately\r\n$80 billion. In their reports, the organs and agencies of\r\nthe United Nations system point out the negative\r\nimpacts of the embargo on almost every aspect of\r\nCuba’s economic and social life, from food and\r\nagriculture, technology transfers, health, education and\r\nculture, and the living conditions of children and\r\nwomen to scientific exchanges and commercial\r\ntransactions.\r\nTogether with the overwhelming majority of\r\nMember States, Viet Nam has always opposed the\r\nimposition of any unilateral embargo and blockade by\r\none State on another. We continue to maintain that the\r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed\r\nby the United States of America on Cuba serves no\r\nother purpose than aggravating tension between the\r\ntwo countries and that the differences between the\r\nUnited States and Cuba should be resolved through\r\ndialogue and negotiations based on the principles of\r\nrespect for each other’s independence and sovereignty,\r\nnon-interference in each other’s internal affairs, mutual\r\nrespect and understanding. We believe that, on the\r\nbasis of those fundamental principles, the two\r\ncountries can settle their differences, thus positively\r\nutilizing their geographical proximity to develop useful\r\neconomic, trade and investment relations in the interest\r\nof their peoples.\r\nOnce again, on behalf of the Vietnamese\r\ndelegation, I wish to express our sentiments of\r\nfriendship and solidarity with the Government and the\r\npeople of Cuba and our commitment to work with\r\nother nations and international organizations in\r\nassisting the Government and people of Cuba to\r\novercome the negative consequences of the embargo.\r\nConsistent with its principled position, Viet Nam\r\nwill vote in favour of the draft resolution (A/60/L.9)\r\nsubmitted by Cuba under this agenda item.\r\nMr. Kittikhoun (Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic) (spoke in French): The Second South\r\nSummit, which took place in Doha, Qatar, last June,\r\nreiterated the appeal made to the Government of the\r\nUnited States of America to put an end to the\r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed\r\non the Republic of Cuba more than four decades ago.\r\nIn such a complex and changing world,\r\ncooperation among States, regardless of their socio-\r\neconomic regime, remains a crucial element in\r\npreserving peace as well as promoting socio-economic\r\ndevelopment around the world. We are pleased that\r\nsuch a trend towards international cooperation prevails\r\nand continues to dominate modern international\r\nrelations. With this in mind, it is disappointing to note\r\nthat there are still unilateral and discriminatory trade\r\npractices.\r\nIn accordance with relevant General Assembly\r\nresolutions, a Member State can neither promulgate nor\r\napply laws, regulations or measures whose\r\nextraterritorial effects will infringe upon the\r\nsovereignty of other Member States or upon freedom of\r\ntrade. It is in this spirit, and in consonance with the\r\nwill of the overwhelming majority of Member States,\r\nthat my country, the Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic, will continue to work to bring an end to the\r\neconomic, financial and commercial embargo imposed\r\non the Republic of Cuba.\r\nIt is a fact that this embargo, which has now been\r\nfurther strengthened, has caused untold suffering for\r\nthe innocent Cuban people. It is also a fact that the\r\nblockade has not benefited either party but, on the\r\ncontrary, has created tensions between these two\r\nneighbouring countries. In our opinion, it is time for\r\nthe international community to step up its efforts and to\r\ndo all within its power to put an end to this\r\nanachronistic blockade.\r\nIt is in this spirit that my delegation will vote in\r\nfavour of the draft resolution submitted by Cuba and\r\ncontained in document A/60/L.9.\r\nMr. Abdelsalam (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): I\r\nassociate myself with the statement made earlier by the\r\nrepresentative of Jamaica on behalf of the Group of 77\r\nand China. One of the main responsibilities of\r\nmembership of the United Nations is to abide by the\r\nprinciples enshrined in the Charter to ensure fraternity,\r\nequality, justice, cooperation and respect for a people’s\r\nchoice of its own government. The time when force\r\nwas a source of law has now passed. There must be\r\n9\r\nA/60/PV.45\r\nrespect for law and for the right of peoples to choose\r\ntheir own path.\r\nThis is the fourteenth consecutive year that we\r\nhere in the General Assembly is considering a draft\r\nresolution against the economic blockade imposed on\r\nCuba by the United States. For the past 14 years, we\r\nhave been adopting resolutions on the right of States to\r\nself-determination, urging others not to comply with\r\nblockade measures imposed by one State on another —\r\nmeasures which have negative consequences and are\r\nindeed a violation of territorial borders and\r\ninternational law.\r\nOnce again, we find ourselves considering the\r\nagenda item entitled “Necessity of ending the\r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed\r\nby the United States of America against Cuba”. Last\r\nyear, the General Assembly adopted resolution 59/11\r\non this item with 179 votes in favour. This reflects the\r\ninternational community’s increasing awareness of the\r\ndanger and illegitimacy of the blockade. The blockade\r\nimposed on Cuba is unilateral and is a flagrant\r\nviolation of the principles of the Charter and of\r\ninternational law and norms governing economic,\r\nfinancial and commercial relations among States. If the\r\nblockade is maintained, it will continue to run counter\r\nto the momentum prevailing within the international\r\ncommunity in defence of human rights and, more\r\nspecifically, of the right to development.\r\nThe danger of such unilateral actions and of their\r\nharsh negative impact on all aspects of life in Cuba can\r\ngive us some idea of what has been lost by the Cuban\r\npeople over the last 40 years and what it has cost them,\r\ninter alia, in terms of the suffering they have\r\nexperienced and their having been deprived of basic\r\nnecessities due to this illegal blockade.\r\nMy country and my people too are suffering from\r\nunilateral sanctions imposed by the same State that has\r\nimposed the economic blockade on Cuba. Other States\r\nalso suffer from such illegal and unjustified policies.\r\nOn 2 November the United States decided to renew its\r\nunilateral sanctions imposed on the Sudan for another\r\nyear. Our position on those policies is based on\r\nestablished principles. We are against policies of\r\nexclusion, force and hegemony over peoples.\r\nAccordingly, we will vote — and we urge other States\r\nto vote — in favour of draft resolution A/60/L.9,\r\nentitled “Necessity of ending the economic,\r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the\r\nUnited States of America against Cuba”. We strongly\r\ncondemn unilateral actions and measures that violate\r\ninternational law and the Charter of the United\r\nNations.\r\nMr. Yechury (India): We from India align\r\nourselves with the statement made by Jamaica on\r\nbehalf of the Group of 77. The four-decade-old\r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed\r\nby the United States against Cuba is the subject of\r\ndiscussion for the fourteenth successive time in this\r\nforum. The embargo dates from 20 October 1960,\r\nwhen then President Eisenhower announced an\r\nembargo against Cuba under the Trading with the\r\nEnemy Act and the Export Control Act. The embargo\r\nhas been reinforced by the Cuba Democracy Act of\r\n1992 and the Helms-Burton Act of 1996, through\r\nwhich the extra-territorial reach of the embargo\r\nencompasses foreign companies as well as foreign\r\nsubsidiaries of United States companies doing business\r\nwith Cuba.\r\nThe embargo means the imposition of economic\r\nsanctions. These do not appear to stand the test of\r\ninternational law. Jurisdiction outside national\r\nboundaries has to be based on acts that have\r\n“substantial or grave effects within the territory” of the\r\nState exercising such jurisdiction. Trafficking in\r\nnationalized property cannot be said to have a\r\nsubstantial effect on the United States or on its\r\neconomy, and therefore the extra-territorial jurisdiction\r\ncannot be justified by the doctrine of grave effects.\r\nSimilarly, the embargo’s limitations on the export and\r\nimport of goods contravenes multilateral trading\r\nregimes and cannot be grounded on the General\r\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) exception\r\nclause of “essential security interests”, since there is\r\nneither a state of war nor a military threat.\r\nSanctions, irrespective of their purpose, have to\r\ncomply with the customary international law principle\r\nof non-intervention and proportionality. The American\r\nAssociation for World Health concluded that, in the\r\ncase of the impact on the Cuban health system, the\r\nembargo\r\n“caused a significant rise in suffering … [with]\r\npatients going without essential drugs [and]\r\ndoctors performing medical procedures without\r\nadequate equipment”.\r\nThe study found also that the embargo continued\r\nto have an impact on food aid deliveries. The impact\r\n10\r\nA/60/PV.45\r\nwas greater in the eastern provinces, which continued\r\nto suffer the worst food insecurity, particularly in view\r\nof the 2004 drought. The negative impact of the\r\nembargo on the educational sector is linked to trade\r\nrestrictions that prevent the purchase of needed inputs\r\nat more competitive prices. The difficulties imposed by\r\nthe embargo have been recognized by the United\r\nNations Conference on Trade and Development\r\n(UNCTAD), especially the deleterious impact on\r\ninternational trade, investment flow, loans and interest\r\npayments, as well as on scientific and technical\r\ncooperation.\r\nAlthough the United States market represents the\r\nclosest, most convenient and diversified trade area,\r\nand, in a normal situation, Cuba and the United States\r\nwould be natural economic partners, obtaining mutual\r\nbenefits from trade, the experience has been exactly the\r\nopposite. According to one estimate, the direct\r\neconomic loss caused to the Cuban people on account\r\nof the blockade is greater than $82 billion; these\r\nestimates exclude indirect economic losses. It is our\r\nunderstanding that a considerable part of the United\r\nStates private sector would like the embargo ended, to\r\ntake advantage of the Cuban market; according to some\r\nestimates, the potential loss to United States business\r\nranges between $1 billion to $15 billion, and potential\r\nemployment losses are in the range of hundreds of\r\nthousands of jobs.\r\nWhile we take note of a step in the right\r\ndirection — namely the 1999-2000 compromise in\r\nCongress which allowed the export of food and\r\nmedicine, though excluding Government or private\r\nfinance and, paradoxically, strengthening the travel\r\nban — we look forward to the lifting of embargoes and\r\nsanctions against Cuba. Embargoes impede the full\r\nachievement of economic and social development by\r\nthe population of the affected country, affecting\r\nchildren and women in particular. They also hinder the\r\nfull enjoyment of human rights, including the right to\r\nfood, medical care and social services, among other\r\nthings. We believe that not only is the creation and\r\nstrengthening of an economic environment capable of\r\nproviding equal opportunities to all countries required\r\nbut also that the international community needs to\r\nredouble its efforts to promote an environment free\r\nfrom sanctions and embargoes.\r\nIndia is opposed to unilateral measures by\r\ncountries that impinge on the sovereignty of another\r\ncountry, including attempts to extend the application of\r\na country’s laws extraterritorially to other sovereign\r\nnations. India recalls the Final Documents adopted by\r\nthe Thirteenth Summit of Heads of State or\r\nGovernment of the Non-Aligned countries, held at\r\nKuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in 2003, and the call made at\r\nthe Doha Summit of the G-77 countries in June 2005\r\non the subject and urges the international community to\r\nadopt all necessary measures to protect the sovereign\r\nrights of all countries.\r\nLet me recall what the indomitable revolutionary\r\nChe Guevara once said: “A better world is possible”.\r\nThe Acting President: I should like to propose\r\nthat, in the absence of objection, the list of speakers in\r\nthe debate on this issue be closed at this time.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nMr. Jenie (Indonesia): It is indeed of great\r\nconcern to us that we find ourselves today having to\r\naddress once again the issue of ending the economic,\r\ncommercial and financial embargo which has been\r\nimposed on Cuba for more than four decades. In\r\nreflecting on this matter, Indonesia associates itself\r\nwith the views expressed by the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Jamaica, who spoke on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China.\r\nHaving said that, we need to ask hard questions\r\nand find a real solution so as to resolve this issue once\r\nand for all. Therefore our gathering here today has to\r\nask whether the economic, commercial and financial\r\nembargo on Cuba is justifiable in today’s globalized\r\nand interdependent world and in keeping with the spirit\r\nof multilateralism.\r\nIt is in this context that we have considered the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General (A/60/213). That\r\ndocument has given us two important perspectives on\r\nthe matter.\r\nFirst, we note that there is disagreement and\r\nopposition from Governments, all of them Members of\r\nthe United Nations, on the application of the unilateral\r\nand extraterritorial nature of the embargo on Cuba.\r\nThat embargo runs counter to the Charter of the United\r\nNations and goes against every recognized principle of\r\ninternational law. That is the main underlying\r\nconsideration for Indonesia, made evident by its\r\nsupport for resolution 59/11, adopted by the General\r\nAssembly last year.\r\n11\r\nA/60/PV.45\r\nSecondly, the embargo imposed on Cuba has\r\naffected the economic and social life of the Cuban\r\npeople, especially children and women, as revealed by\r\nthe reports of various United Nations agencies, funds\r\nand programmes. In our view, that situation is not in\r\nline with the spirit of global partnership for\r\ndevelopment, as set out in the Millennium Declaration,\r\nthe Monterrey Consensus and the Johannesburg Plan of\r\nImplementation. In fact, during the 2005 world summit\r\nin September, we strongly reiterated our determination\r\nto ensure the timely and full realization of development\r\ngoals and objectives, including the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, to eradicate poverty.\r\nWith that in mind, Indonesia will vote in favour\r\nof draft resolution A/60/L.9, on the necessity of ending\r\nthe economic, commercial and financial embargo\r\nimposed by the United States of America against Cuba.\r\nIndonesia urges that due respect be shown for the\r\nsovereign equality of all States, consistent with\r\ninternational legal instruments. The principles of non-\r\nintervention and non-interference in countries’ internal\r\naffairs must also be upheld. Moreover, there should be\r\nno hindrance of the freedom of international trade and\r\nnavigation.\r\nLet me emphasize the fact that the continuation\r\nof the economic, commercial and financial embargo\r\nagainst Cuba will only serve to maintain the high\r\ntensions between the two neighbouring countries. That\r\nwill certainly not bring us very far in our commitment\r\nto and our respect for the purposes and principles of\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and international law,\r\nwhich are indispensable foundations for a more\r\npeaceful, prosperous and just world.\r\nTherefore, I will conclude by calling on the\r\nUnited States of America to end its current approach\r\nand policy towards Cuba and to take the path of\r\ndialogue and accommodation instead.\r\nMr. Kapoma (Zambia): I should like at the outset\r\nto fully associate my delegation with the statement\r\nmade earlier by the representative of Jamaica on behalf\r\nof the Group of 77 and China.\r\nI express my delegation’s appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for presenting the\r\ncomprehensive report contained in document A/60/213,\r\nin which the Office of the United Nations Resident\r\nCoordinator in Cuba gives an account of the effects of\r\nthe embargo imposed by the United States of America\r\nagainst the people of Cuba. The report states,\r\n“In the last 12 months the situation did not\r\nchange, as the measures introduced by the\r\nembargo were maintained, with their resulting\r\nnegative impact. Such measures fundamentally\r\naffected the people of Cuba and in particular the\r\nmost vulnerable groups.” (A/60/213, Part III,\r\npara. 2)\r\nDespite the numerous resolutions adopted by this\r\nbody appealing to the United States to improve\r\nrelations with Cuba, my delegation notes with concern\r\nthat in the past few years, additional steps have been\r\ntaken to strengthen the embargo. Those measures,\r\nwhich have been enforced during the period 2004-\r\n2005, have had serious negative consequences on the\r\neconomic, political and social life of the people of\r\nCuba.\r\nMy delegation reaffirms its call for United\r\nNations Member States to support an immediate lifting\r\nof the economic, commercial and financial embargo\r\nimposed by the United States of America against Cuba,\r\nas that embargo violates the norms of free trade and\r\nnavigation. Indeed, measures such as the ones\r\ncontained in the Helms-Burton Act violate\r\ninternational law. Those unilateral sanctions, apart\r\nfrom being a breach of international law, erode the\r\nprinciple of friendly and cooperative relations between\r\nStates. It was for that reason that last year, as in\r\nprevious years, the Assembly called on the United\r\nStates of America to lift the unilateral economic,\r\ncommercial and financial embargo against Cuba.\r\nMy Government remains committed to\r\nstrengthening universal respect for international law in\r\nthe conduct of all forms of relations among sovereign\r\nStates. In accordance with resolution 59/11 of 28\r\nOctober 2004, 85 countries, including my own, have\r\nexpressed their written opposition to the continuation\r\nof the embargo. In addition, the United Nations system\r\nhas provided information regarding the negative impact\r\nof the embargo on the United Nations development\r\nprogrammes in Cuba. Since all United States\r\ntechnology and materials are covered by the embargo,\r\nthe cost of providing United Nations developmental\r\nassistance to Cuba has become prohibitive. The end\r\nresult is that such programmes, meant for the most\r\nvulnerable, are never implemented. There is an urgent\r\nneed, therefore, to redress the situation without further\r\nequivocation.\r\n12\r\nA/60/PV.45\r\nIn view of the Secretary-General’s report, Zambia\r\nwill once again vote in favour of the draft resolution\r\ncontained in document A/60/L.9 and urges other\r\nMember States to do likewise.\r\nMr. Aghazadeh (Islamic Republic of Iran): I\r\nshould like to begin by thanking the Secretary-General\r\nfor his report under agenda item 18, “Necessity of\r\nending the economic, commercial and financial\r\nembargo imposed by the United States of America\r\nagainst Cuba” (A/60/213). I also associate myself with\r\nthe statement made by the representative of Jamaica on\r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nThe contents of resolution 59/11, as well as the\r\n179 votes in favour of it, clearly reflect the position of\r\nthe international community towards the long-standing\r\nembargo against Cuba. It is crystal-clear that the\r\nblockade is in violation of internationally agreed\r\nprinciples governing relations among States, such as\r\nthe sovereign equality of States, non-intervention in\r\ntheir internal affairs and freedom of international trade\r\nand navigation. As my delegation has pointed out in\r\nvarious statements, such unilateral coercive policies\r\nand measures should be regarded as major\r\nimpediments for the international community in\r\npursuing its common causes and interests. Resorting to\r\nan embargo as a tool to achieve political objectives\r\nundermines the international environment favourable\r\nfor economic growth and sustainable development that\r\nthe United Nations system keeps trying to promote.\r\nParagraph 102 of the Johannesburg Plan of\r\nImplementation calls upon States to refrain from any\r\nunilateral measure that contravenes international law\r\nand the Charter of the United Nations and impedes the\r\nfull achievement of economic and social development\r\nby the population of the affected countries, in\r\nparticular women and children. The same paragraph\r\nfurther indicates that any such unilateral measure\r\nhinders the well-being of the affected people and\r\ncreates obstacles to the full enjoyment of their human\r\nrights, including the right of everyone to a standard of\r\nliving adequate for their health and well-being and\r\ntheir right to food, medical care and the necessary\r\nsocial services.\r\nParagraph 101 of the Johannesburg Plan of\r\nImplementation stipulates that States should cooperate\r\nto promote a supportive and open international\r\neconomic system that will lead to economic growth\r\nand sustainable development in all countries. It adds\r\nthat trade policy measures for environmental purposes\r\nshould not constitute a means of arbitrary or\r\nunjustifiable discrimination in international trade.\r\nIn reviewing the report of the Cuban\r\nGovernment, which is supported by numerous figures,\r\nit is hard to imagine just how devastating the impact of\r\nthe imposed embargo has been on all walks of life of\r\nthat nation, including health, economy, education,\r\ntrade, tourism, civil aviation, cultural activities and\r\neven sports. Such policies and measures, which stem\r\nmerely from intolerance and enmity towards other\r\npolitical, economic and social systems, will continue to\r\nadd silently to the disparities and gaps among nations\r\nand run counter to the policy of protecting human\r\nrights and dignity.\r\nAt the dawn of the twenty-first century, resorting\r\nto unjustifiable economic coercive measures against\r\nother States on the basis of political observations is not\r\nacceptable to the international community. The fact is\r\nthat the extraterritorial application of such internal\r\nlaws as the Helms-Burton Act and the D’Amato Act\r\ncreate an antagonistic environment in international\r\nrelations and adversely affect world peace and security.\r\nSuch political acts with economic implications\r\ncontinue to restrict investment, trade, employment,\r\ntechnology transfer and the prospects for economic\r\ngrowth not only of the targeted countries, but also of\r\nthird-party countries dealing with the affected country.\r\nIt is worth noting that, in the outcome document\r\nof the recently held summit, all countries reaffirmed\r\ntheir commitments to efforts designed to ensure that\r\ndeveloping countries can participate fully in the world\r\ntrading system in order to meet the needs of their\r\neconomic development. Let us observe our new\r\ncommitments and put an end to all unilateral economic\r\ncoercive measures.\r\nMr. Dapkiunas (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): It\r\nis with pride and bitterness that Belarus adds its voice\r\nto the demands of the international community that the\r\nUnited States lift the blockade on Cuba now.\r\nWe are proud to stand with the people of a\r\nfriendly country at a difficult moment in its history. We\r\nare proud that we can stand with a country whose very\r\nname has long been the symbol of courageous\r\nresistance to gross pressure from foreign domination.\r\nIt is with bitterness, however, that we have come\r\nto understand that, at a time when the eyes of the\r\n13\r\nA/60/PV.45\r\npeoples of the world are turned to their Governments in\r\ngenuine hope that the world community will be able to\r\nunite to combat real — not fabricated — threats, we\r\nare compelled to address the obsolete dogmas and\r\napproaches of the cold war. It is with bitterness and\r\nregret that we witness the ongoing attempts by the\r\nmightiest Power of the world to break by force the will\r\nof the Cuban people and force them to live in\r\naccordance with its laws and ways.\r\nThe nobility of strength lies not in blind\r\ninsistence that one is right or in bullying those that are\r\nsmaller and weaker. The true nobility of strength lies in\r\ndemonstrating wisdom, acknowledging mistakes, and\r\nrecognizing the new nature of the world around us — a\r\nworld that is interconnected, interdependent, complex\r\nand fragile. Long live Cuba!\r\nMr. Shingenge (Namibia): While aligning\r\nNamibia with the statement made by the representative\r\nof Jamaica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, I\r\nwish to make a few comments on behalf of my own\r\ncountry.\r\nSince 1991, the Assembly has, through its\r\nresolutions on the item under consideration,\r\nconsistently rejected and called for an end to the\r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed\r\nby the United States of America on Cuba. The\r\nblockade is hurting both the economy and the people of\r\nCuba, especially women and children. It is therefore\r\nunfortunate that, 14 years later, the blockade remains\r\nintact and that the General Assembly is still seized\r\nwith this issue.\r\nMy delegation has always maintained the view\r\nthat the embargo against Cuba runs contrary to the\r\nletter and spirit of the United Nations Charter,\r\ninternational law and the Millennium Declaration. The\r\nblockade continues to cause irreparable damage to the\r\neconomic, social and cultural development of the\r\nCuban people as it deprives them of the opportunities\r\nand benefits emanating from free trade.\r\nThe Torricelli and Helms-Burton Acts are\r\nextraterritorial in nature and thus interfere with the\r\nsovereign rights of Cuba and violate the principles and\r\nrules of the international trading system. The unilateral\r\nblockade cannot be called an exclusive bilateral affair\r\nbecause it also impacts numerous countries and the\r\ncitizens and companies of third States.\r\nWe are convinced that the people of both\r\nneighbouring countries would benefit from the\r\nnormalization of relations and the removal of\r\nrestrictions between them. The United States\r\nGovernment should therefore heed the call by the\r\ninternational community to end the blockade and\r\nthereby promote good relations and good-\r\nneighbourliness with the friendly Government and\r\npeople of Cuba.\r\nIn our view, all human rights — be they political,\r\ncultural or economic — are inseparable. They include\r\nthe rights to food, medicine, education and, above all,\r\ndevelopment. Through the blockade, the people of\r\nCuba are being denied those basic fundamental human\r\nrights just because they have chosen a different\r\npolitical system. It is against that background that\r\nNamibia will vote in favour of the draft resolution\r\ncontained in document A/60/L.9 on the necessity of\r\nending the economic, commercial and financial\r\nembargo imposed by the United States of America\r\nagainst Cuba. We do so in expression of our solidarity\r\nwith the people of Cuba, who stood by us in our time\r\nof need when Namibia was struggling for its\r\nindependence and still stand by us as we struggle with\r\nsuch issues as HIV/AIDS.\r\nMr. Mekdad (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in\r\nArabic): At the outset, I should like to associate myself\r\nwith the statement made earlier by the representative of\r\nJamaica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nThe principles and purposes of the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations uphold the right of States to exercise\r\nsovereignty over their territory and to conduct their\r\ndomestic affairs without external interference. All\r\nMember States of the United Nations — including the\r\nmost powerful — must respect the Charter, which is\r\nthe Organization’s basic law and its first and last\r\nreference. The unilateral embargo imposed by the\r\nUnited States against Cuba and the more recent\r\nmeasures aimed at strengthening that embargo\r\ncontravene the principles of international law,\r\nincluding the principles of the Charter — particularly\r\nthe principles of the sovereign equality of States, non-\r\nintervention in their internal affairs and freedom of\r\ninternational trade and navigation.\r\nThe embargo, which has been imposed against\r\nCuba for more than four decades, has caused Cuba to\r\nsuffer immeasurable social, economic and political\r\ndamage. Cuba’s suffering has increased, affecting\r\n14\r\nA/60/PV.45\r\nespecially children and the elderly. The embargo has\r\nhampered the tireless efforts of the Cuban people to\r\nachieve prosperity and well-being. It continues to have\r\nvery adverse effects not only on the Cuban economy —\r\nwhich has sustained losses exceeding $82 billion —\r\nbut also on the social and cultural development of the\r\nCuban people, who are deprived of the opportunities\r\nand benefits of trade. The embargo is a direct violation\r\nof the Cuban people’s basic freedoms and human\r\nrights, namely, the rights to life and development.\r\nMy delegation is grateful that Cuba has never\r\nstopped trying to establish a constructive dialogue with\r\nthe United States to resolve all outstanding issues\r\nbetween the two parties on the basis of sovereign\r\nequality, mutual respect, non-interference in the\r\ninternal affairs of each other and respect for the\r\nprinciples and purposes of the United Nations Charter\r\nand the principle of good-neighbourly relations. My\r\ndelegation believes that normalization of relations\r\nbetween the United States of America and Cuba would\r\nserve the interests of both countries.\r\nMy country reaffirms the right of peoples to\r\nchoose freely their own political, economic, social and\r\ncultural systems, in accordance with international law.\r\nThe fact that 179 States supported this draft resolution\r\nlast year proves that the international community\r\nrecognizes that there must be an end to the embargo\r\nand that we must respect the political, economic and\r\nsocial systems chosen by all countries of their own free\r\nwill to serve their own national interests.\r\nIn that connection, I should like to draw the\r\nattention of Members to the statement of the heads of\r\nState or Government of the Non-Aligned Movement,\r\nwho once again called upon the Government of the\r\nUnited States of America to put an end to the\r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo against\r\nCuba. They also expressed deep concern over the\r\nwidening of the extraterritorial nature of the embargo\r\nand over continuous new legislative measures aimed at\r\nintensifying it. We would also like to draw the\r\nattention of Members to the outcome document agreed\r\nby developing countries at the second South Summit of\r\nthe Group of 77 and China, held at Doha in June 2005.\r\nThe Summit firmly rejected the imposition of laws and\r\nregulations with exterritorial impact and all other\r\nforms of coercive economic measures. The Summit\r\nalso expressed deep concern over the negative effects\r\nof economic sanctions on a country’s ability to develop\r\nand called on the United States to put an immediate\r\nend to the embargo against Cuba.\r\nThe international community has on more than\r\none occasion expressed its rejection of the unilateral\r\nsanctions imposed against Cuba and of the expansion\r\nof those sanctions through the Helms-Burton Act,\r\nwhich exceeds the jurisdiction of national legislation\r\nand encroaches on the sovereignty of other States that\r\ndeal with Cuba. That is incompatible with the principle\r\nof the sovereign equality of States and with the\r\nprinciples of international law.\r\nDespite repeated appeals, the Government of the\r\nUnited States of America has still not taken any\r\npositive measures in response to the requests of the\r\ninternational community. The United States knowingly\r\nand stubbornly continues to cling to its mistaken\r\nposition and to disregard the just demands of the\r\ninternational community. Furthermore, the United\r\nStates has adopted new measures to strengthen the\r\nembargo against the sovereign State of Cuba.\r\nIn that context, my delegation hopes that the\r\nembargo imposed by the United States against Cuba is\r\nlifted and that the opinion of the international\r\ncommunity, as expressed in the General Assembly and\r\nin other forums, will be respected by the United States,\r\nwhich must accept it fully. Therefore, Syria will vote in\r\nfavour of the draft resolution.\r\nMr. Toro Jiménez (Bolivarian Republic of\r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): We are convinced that\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security\r\nrequires that relations among States — regardless of\r\ntheir ideologies — be based on strict adherence to the\r\nCharter of the United Nations and to the principles of\r\ninternational law. The Bolivarian Republic of\r\nVenezuela reiterates that there is not, nor can there be,\r\na single model of development or a single model of\r\ndemocracy for the world’s peoples. Given that\r\nincontrovertible reality and the respect it deserves from\r\nthe international community, the Member States of this\r\nintergovernmental Organization must constantly\r\nreaffirm the principles of non-intervention in the\r\ninternal affairs of States, respect for the self-\r\ndetermination of peoples and national sovereignty.\r\nMany voices have been raised in indignation\r\nthroughout the world since 3 February 1962, when the\r\nGovernment of the United States of America formally\r\nimposed a criminal blockade — an iniquitous\r\naggression and a destabilizing and unjustified act of\r\n15\r\nA/60/PV.45\r\nwar — against the people of Cuba, who were and are\r\nfully exercising the self-determination that we all know\r\nas the Cuban revolution. The purpose of that act —\r\nwhich could be considered genocidal — was nothing\r\nother than to weaken the Cuban people’s support for\r\nthe revolution by seeking to make them discouraged,\r\nthrough their suffering, at the difficulties encountered\r\nin the process of the revolutionary changes and\r\nunstoppable progress in Cuba for the past 44 years.\r\nToday, in this universal forum, we will again\r\nadopt — as we have since 1992 — a draft resolution\r\nthat expresses the international community’s\r\nconscience and its rejection of the embargo. What\r\nother arguments can be offered by those of us who\r\nbelieve in freedom, justice, peace and multilateralism?\r\nHow can we ensure that this illegal and immoral\r\nblockade, lethal and totalitarian in intent, yields to an\r\ninternational clamour that has been tirelessly\r\ndemanding justice for years?\r\nPerhaps a few examples that make clear the\r\nincredibly absurd nature of this blockade will enable us\r\nto appeal to the conscience of a new international\r\nhumanism, so that international justice can finally\r\nprevail.\r\nForty-six years have elapsed since the United\r\nStates Government began its policy of hostility against\r\nthe Cuban people. More than 70 per cent of Cuba’s\r\npeople were born after that date and have lived under\r\nthe strict economic sanctions that have been imposed\r\non the country by successive North American\r\nadministrations.\r\nIn the last four decades, the United States\r\nembargo has cost the Cuban people more than $80\r\nbillion. Those numbers speak eloquently to the need\r\nfor justice, and they do not even include the $54 billion\r\nworth of direct damage caused by sabotage and\r\nterrorist actions incited and financed from United\r\nStates territory.\r\nThe United States stranglehold on the Cuban\r\neconomy and on Cuban society cost the country $2.764\r\nbillion in the year 2004 alone.\r\nWere it not for the blockade, over the past few\r\ndecades the Cuban people would have had $134\r\nmillion more to spend on education alone.\r\nThe Republic of Cuba is denied access to its\r\nclosest markets, which hampers its social and cultural\r\ndevelopment. The imports it requires for its\r\ndevelopment carry a surcharge of 25 to 30 per cent in\r\ntransport costs, because its suppliers are so far away.\r\nThe coercive and systematic embargo imposed on\r\nthe Republic of Cuba since 1962 is a unilateral act of\r\nforce that is incompatible with the international legal\r\nregime and contrary to the framework that defines\r\neconomic and trade relations among States as a\r\nfundamental right — a path to peace, cooperation,\r\ngood faith and mutual respect.\r\nYet the Cuban people and their legitimate\r\nGovernment have not only survived that aggression\r\nwith courage and with integrity; they have also become\r\nstronger and through adversity have intensified their\r\nrevolutionary spirit. They have demonstrated great\r\nsocial creativity at all levels, showing solidarity to\r\nother peoples and bringing a sense of dignity to the\r\ninternational community.\r\nThe Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela strongly\r\nand categorically rejects the promulgation and\r\napplication by any State of laws that are extraterritorial\r\nin effect and that do not respect the sovereignty of\r\nStates. Our delegation and our country — standing side\r\nby side with the Government and the people of the\r\nRepublic of Cuba and inspired by the spirit of Bolívar\r\nand Marti, which made our achievements possible —\r\nreiterate our opposition to the coercive, unilateral\r\nembargo imposed against Cuba. We will therefore vote\r\nin favour of the draft resolution (A/60/L.9) that is\r\nbefore the Assembly.\r\nMr. Swe (Myanmar): My delegation fully\r\nassociates itself with the statement made by the\r\nPermanent Representative of Jamaica, who spoke on\r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nThe will of the international community with\r\nregard to the necessity of ending the economic,\r\ncommercial and financial embargo by the United States\r\nagainst Cuba was clearly expressed when the General\r\nAssembly adopted resolution 59/11 by an\r\noverwhelming majority of 179 affirmative votes.\r\nThe Union of Myanmar is of the view that the\r\npromulgation and application by Member Sates of laws\r\nand regulations, the extraterritorial effects of which\r\naffect the sovereignty of other States and the legitimate\r\ninterests of persons under their jurisdiction, as well as\r\nfreedom of trade and navigation, violate both the spirit\r\nand the letter of the United Nations Charter and the\r\nuniversally adopted principles of international law.\r\n16\r\nA/60/PV.45\r\nMyanmar is one of the co-initiators of the Five\r\nPrinciples of Peaceful Coexistence and, as such, has\r\nscrupulous respect for the principles of the sovereign\r\nequality of States, non-intervention and non-\r\ninterference in the internal affairs of States, and\r\nfreedom of trade and international navigation.\r\nFurthermore, the Union of Myanmar is of the\r\nview that the economic, commercial and financial\r\nembargo imposed on Cuba adversely affects the Cuban\r\npeople and can have only negative effects on children,\r\nwomen and the elderly in particular. We stand in full\r\nsolidarity with the people of Cuba. Myanmar does not\r\nbelieve that these measures will in any way promote\r\npeace and stability in the region.\r\nMyanmar wholeheartedly joins the call made by\r\nthe international community on the United States to put\r\nan end to the embargo and sanctions on Cuba. My\r\ndelegation will therefore vote in favour of the draft\r\nresolution, thereby demonstrating our firm opposition\r\nto rules and regulations which have extraterritorial\r\neffects, since these are contrary to the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations and to the provisions of international\r\nlaw.\r\nMr. Aburawi (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in\r\nArabic): First of all, I should like to express my full\r\nsupport for the statement made by the representative of\r\nJamaica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nSanctions and blockades have never been, and\r\nwill never be, the best way of resolving differences\r\nbetween States. The Charter of the United Nations and\r\nthe relevant General Assembly resolutions call for\r\nappropriate measures to be taken so as to resolve\r\nbilateral disputes or conflicts through dialogue and\r\nnegotiations on the basis of total equality, mutual\r\nrespect and non-interference in a State’s internal\r\naffairs. That approach, reaffirmed on several occasions\r\nby Member States, must be heeded urgently, because it\r\nis based on the logic and norms of international\r\nlegality and sends a clear message that global peace is\r\nnot possible and that there cannot be friendly relations\r\namong States or progress in the area of development\r\nunless the international community operates on the\r\nbasis of mutual respect for the sovereignty of States,\r\nregardless of their size, the number of their inhabitants,\r\ntheir level of socio-economic development or the\r\nnature of their political and economic system.\r\nThe Cuban people continue to suffer from an\r\nunjust blockade that has gone on for more than four\r\ndecades and that has done great damage. It has\r\ninflicted suffering on the Cuban people, sparing no\r\nsector of the Cuban population, neither children nor the\r\nelderly nor women. It has undermined the capacity of\r\nthe Cuban Government to import foodstuffs,\r\nagricultural commodities, medicines and medical\r\nequipment.\r\nThe international community has categorically\r\nexpressed its repudiation and rejection of the\r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargoes\r\nimposed on Cuba and on other peoples and countries,\r\nthrough many international resolutions, adopted by the\r\nGeneral Assembly in particular.\r\nThe continuation of these oppressive measures,\r\nwhose effects, in many cases, go beyond the countries\r\nconcerned and affect third countries, can only lead to\r\ngreater human suffering by deepening differences and\r\nfuelling hatred between peoples whose interests are\r\ninterlinked. As a result, we must rationally and\r\nrealistically find the appropriate civilized solutions that\r\nwould guarantee human rights and protect them from\r\nattack.\r\nThe Libyan Arab Jamahiriya supports draft\r\nresolution A/60/L.9, submitted by Cuba and entitled,\r\n“Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and\r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of\r\nAmerica against Cuba”, and also supports international\r\nefforts aimed at abolishing these unilateral measures.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Felipe Pérez Roque, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Cuba, to introduce draft resolution\r\nA/60/L.9.\r\nMr. Pérez Roque (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nToday is a day of particular importance for the United\r\nNations, whose General Assembly is voting for the\r\nfourteenth consecutive time on a draft resolution\r\nsubmitted by Cuba on the item “Necessity of ending\r\nthe economic, commercial and financial blockade\r\nimposed by the United States of America against\r\nCuba” (A/60/L.9). The General Assembly will not only\r\nbe deciding on an issue of interest to Cuba; it will also\r\nbe voting in favour of the principles and norms of\r\ninternational law, against the extraterritorial\r\nenforcement of laws and in defence of the human\r\nrights of Cubans, Americans and the citizens of all 191\r\nStates represented in this Assembly.\r\n17\r\nA/60/PV.45\r\nIt is true that the Government of the United States\r\nhas disregarded the continuous, almost unanimous\r\nappeal by the international community, and, most\r\nlikely, President Bush will further tighten the blockade,\r\nwhich is already the longest-running and most ruthless\r\nin history. But that does not diminish the legal,\r\npolitical, moral and ethical importance of this vote.\r\nNever before has the blockade been enforced with so\r\nmuch viciousness and brutality (as it has been in the\r\nlast 18 months). Never before have we seen such cruel\r\nand relentless persecution by a United States\r\nadministration against the economy and the right of\r\nCubans to a decent life, a life with dignity.\r\nSince 6 May 2004, when the President of the\r\nUnited States signed his new plan for the annexation of\r\nCuba, there has been a hysterical, unprecedented\r\nescalation in the enforcement of new and aggressive\r\nmeasures, including the threat to use military force\r\nagainst Cuba and the persecution of citizens and\r\ncompanies, not only from Cuba, but also from the\r\nUnited States and the rest of the world.\r\nThus, in May 2004, a $100 million fine was\r\nimposed on the Swiss bank, UBS, the largest fine ever\r\nimposed on a banking entity, for allegedly violating the\r\nsanctions against Cuba.\r\nOn 30 September 2004, reaching new highs in\r\ndelusion and absurdity, the so-called Cuban Assets\r\nControl Regulations were tightened and it was\r\nestablished that citizens or permanent residents of the\r\nUnited States cannot legally purchase Cuban-made\r\nproducts in a third country, including tobacco and\r\nalcohol — not even for personal use abroad. Penalties\r\narising from violations can be as high as $1 million in\r\nfines for corporations and $250,000 in fines and up to\r\n10 years in prison for individuals. For the first time in\r\nhistory Americans will be prevented from smoking a\r\nCuban cigar or buying a bottle of the unrivalled Cuban\r\nrum, Havana Club, even if they do so while travelling\r\nin another country. In terms of insanity, this draconian\r\nprohibition should be inscribed in the Guinness World\r\nRecords.\r\nOn 9 October 2004, in an unprecedented act of\r\naggression in the history of international financial\r\nrelations, the State Department announced the\r\nestablishment of a Group for the Persecution of Cuban\r\nAssets. The very existence of a group so named should\r\nembarrass the President of the most powerful nation on\r\nEarth.\r\nIn January 2005, the Office of Foreign Assets\r\nControl reinterpreted travel regulations so as to prevent\r\nUnited States citizens from taking part in meetings\r\nwhich are held in Cuba and sponsored and organized\r\nby United Nations agencies headquartered in the\r\nUnited States, unless provided in advance with a\r\nlicense from the United States Government.\r\nOn 24 February 2005, in a blatant and brazen\r\nviolation of international regulations on trademarks\r\nand patents, a legal scheme was orchestrated and\r\nimplemented to deprive Cuba of the rights to the\r\nCohiba brand name, the most prestigious brand of\r\nCuban cigars.\r\nOn 13 April 2005, a guilty verdict was delivered\r\nagainst the United States citizen Stefan Brodie, former\r\nchairman of the Purolite Company, who was charged\r\nwith selling ionized resins to Cuba for the treatment\r\nand purification of water in Cuban aqueducts.\r\nOn 29 April 2005, President Bush instructed the\r\nTreasury Department to hand over $198,000 in Cuban\r\nfunds illegally frozen in United States banks, in order\r\nto acquiesce to one of the most spurious demands ever\r\nfiled against Cuba by the violent, Miami-based\r\nextremist groups which orchestrate terrorist plans\r\nagainst Cuba with utter impunity.\r\nIn April 2005, access to the United States was\r\nonce again denied to the new directors of Canada’s\r\nSherritt International and to their relatives, under the\r\nprovisions of the Helms-Burton Act. Also in April\r\n2005, the Office of Foreign Assets Control toughened\r\nits persecution against groups — even against religious\r\norganizations — that possessed licences for travel to\r\nCuba.\r\nIn 2004, the United States Government imposed\r\nfines on 316 citizens and residents of the United States\r\nfor violating blockade provisions. The number had\r\nreached 537 fines by 12 October 2005.\r\nIn 2004, a total of 77 companies, financial\r\ninstitutions and non-governmental organizations from\r\nthe United States and other countries were fined for\r\nviolating the blockade on Cuba. Eleven of them are\r\nforeign companies or subsidiaries of United States\r\ncompanies in Mexico, Canada, Panama, Italy, the\r\nUnited Kingdom, Uruguay and the Bahamas. Another\r\nseven companies, including Iberia, Alitalia, Air\r\nJamaica and Daewoo, were sanctioned because their\r\nsubsidiaries in the United States, according to the\r\n18\r\nA/60/PV.45\r\nUnited States Administration, violated the blockade\r\nlaws.\r\nTravel by American citizens to Cuba from\r\nJanuary to October 2005, has dropped by 55 per cent as\r\nopposed to the same period in 2003, prior to the new\r\nsanctions enacted by President Bush. In the case of the\r\nCubans residing in the United States, there has been a\r\n49 per cent decrease in those travelling directly to\r\nCuba.\r\nCultural, sports, academic, student and scientific\r\nexchanges, as well as the linkages among Cubans on\r\nboth sides of the Florida Straits, have been specially\r\ntargeted by the anti-Cuban aggression undertaken by\r\nthis Administration. Travels to Cuba by uncles and\r\naunts and cousins, among others, have even been\r\nprohibited, with the argument that they are not family.\r\nThe blockade has cost the people of Cuba,\r\nthroughout these nearly 47 years, over $82 billion.\r\nThere is no economic or social activity in Cuba that\r\nhas not suffered its consequences. There is no human\r\nright of the Cubans that is protected from the\r\naggression of the blockade.\r\nUnder the blockade, Cuba cannot export any\r\nproduct to the United States. Given its proximity, Cuba\r\ncould be exporting to the United States every year\r\nmore than 30,000 tons of nickel or 1 million tons of\r\nsugar at a price three times higher than what Cuba\r\nobtains today. It could also sell $180 million worth of\r\nAteromixol per year if it just captured 1 per cent of the\r\nsales of cholesterol-reducing drugs in the United\r\nStates. According to the editors of the Harvard\r\nInternational Review, Ateromixol is the best\r\ncholesterol-reducing medicine available.\r\nFurthermore, last year Cuba would have exported\r\nto the United States nearly $30 million in Havana Club\r\nrum and over $100 million in tobacco products.\r\nSimilarly, Cuba cannot import from the United States\r\ngoods other than agricultural products — and those\r\nonly under extensive and renewed constraints.\r\nCuba cannot receive any tourism from the United\r\nStates. In 2004, Cuba would have earned over one\r\nbillion dollars if it had just received 15 per cent of the\r\n11 million American tourists who travelled to the\r\nCaribbean. Several studies released in the United\r\nStates foresee between 2 and 4 million travellers from\r\nthe United States to Cuba if the blockade were lifted.\r\nBecause of the blockade, Cuba cannot use the\r\nUnited States dollar in its transactions abroad, nor does\r\nit have access to credit — and it cannot engage in\r\noperations with United States financial institutions,\r\ntheir subsidiaries or even regional or multilateral\r\ninstitutions. Cuba is the only country in Latin America\r\nand the Caribbean that has never received, in 47 years,\r\na loan from the World Bank or the Inter-American\r\nDevelopment Bank.\r\nIf the blockade were only a bilateral issue\r\nbetween Cuba and the United States, it would already\r\nbe a very serious matter for our small country. But it is\r\nmuch more than that. The blockade is an economic war\r\nenforced with incomparable zeal on a global scale. The\r\nblockade is also the extraterritorial application of laws\r\nof the United States against the countries that delegates\r\nrepresent here in the General Assembly and is therefore\r\na serious violation of international law.\r\nNow, Cuba has two new obstacles to overcome:\r\nthe imperial haughtiness of President Bush, which has\r\ntaken him farther than anyone else in this madness, and\r\nthe ever-increasing globalization of the world\r\neconomy.\r\nWhy? Because the United States controls almost\r\nhalf of the transnational corporations on the planet,\r\nincluding 8 of the 10 largest ones. The United States\r\nalso owns one fourth of foreign direct investments and\r\nimports 22 per cent of goods traded the world over.\r\nThe United States owns 11 of the 14 largest\r\ntransnational corporations in information technology\r\nand communications, and represents about 80 per cent\r\nof the world’s e-commerce. Out of the 10\r\npharmaceutical companies that are responsible for\r\nalmost half of the worldwide sales of medicines, five\r\nare from the United States, and some of those products\r\nare one of a kind.\r\nCuba’s external economic space is, thus,\r\nnarrowed through investments by third-country\r\ncorporations in the United States, as well as those\r\nundertaken by American companies abroad. Every\r\nmerger or acquisition among companies brings about\r\nanother challenge to our small country — a challenge\r\nthat is often insurmountable because we have to find a\r\nnew supplier or a new market for our products.\r\nLet us recall the extraterritorial provisions of the\r\nblockade: under the Torricelli Act, subsidiaries of\r\n19\r\nA/60/PV.45\r\nUnited States companies based in third countries are\r\nprevented from trading with Cuba.\r\nA portion of the equipment and materials for\r\nCuba’s biotechnological research centres, which are\r\nalready producing therapeutic vaccines against cancer,\r\nwas supplied by Sweden’s Pharmacia. That company\r\nwas bought up by Britain’s Amersham, which, in turn,\r\nwas taken over by General Electric of the United\r\nStates, which then gave one week’s notice to those\r\ncompanies to cancel all contacts with Cuba. When\r\nBrazil’s Oro Rojo was bought up by an American\r\ncompany, it cancelled its sales of canned meat to Cuba\r\nthat had been intended for HIV/AIDS patients as part\r\nof a project of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Malaria\r\nand Tuberculosis.\r\nThose were not weapons of mass destruction,\r\nthose were not drugs or banned products, that was meat\r\nto be given to HIV/AIDS patients, as part of a United\r\nNations programme. Those sales were banned and\r\nthose companies that tried to have normal trade with\r\nCuba were persecuted, thus violating a law of our\r\ncountry, as well as business laws of other countries.\r\nThe Chiron Corporation has not sold any of its medical\r\nproducts to Cuba since last year’s fine of $168,500,\r\nbecause one of its European subsidiaries exported two\r\nchildren’s vaccines to Cuba. These are not nuclear\r\nweapons, these are not strategic rockets — just two\r\nvaccines for children.\r\nOn 7 February 2005, the First Caribbean\r\nInternational Bank of the Bahamas cancelled its\r\ntransactions with Cuba under the threat of the\r\nGovernment of the United States. The British company\r\nBarclays Bank recently announced that it would do the\r\nsame, fearing United States sanctions. The Canadian\r\ncompany VECO, with United States capital investment,\r\nhad to suspend its projected involvement in Cuba’s\r\ndevelopment of fuel storage capacity.\r\nDenmark’s Sabroe was bought up by York of the\r\nUnited States, and they immediately cancelled the\r\nongoing deal to sell to Cuba refrigeration compressors,\r\nwhich were needed by the Cuban programme to supply\r\nsoy-based yoghurt to all children aged 7 to 13.\r\nThe blockade also prevents third-country\r\ncompanies from selling goods or services to Cuba, if\r\nthey use American technology or consist of more than\r\n10 per cent United States components. As a result,\r\nsince 2004, the United States Government has\r\nprevented the Dutch company Intervet from selling\r\navian vaccines to Cuba, claiming that they contain an\r\nantigen produced in the United States.\r\nThe Mexican company Vafe S.A. had to suspend\r\nthe sale to Cuba of a material required in the\r\nmanufacture of household pressure cookers, because it\r\ncontained raw material from the United States. In\r\nSeptember 2004, Novair, an aviation company from\r\nSweden, cancelled a lease for an Airbus 330 with\r\nCubana de Aviación, because it could not receive any\r\nmaintenance services — although the airplane is\r\nEuropean-made, it uses several United States\r\ntechnologies. In October 2004, Japan’s Hitachi High\r\nTechnologies Corporation could not sell an electron\r\nmicroscope to a prestigious Cuban hospital for the\r\nsame reasons already mentioned above.\r\nThe blockade also prevents companies from\r\nthird-party countries that delegates to the General\r\nAssembly represent from exporting any product or\r\npiece of equipment to the United States if it contains\r\nany Cuban raw materials. Not one company in the\r\nworld can export confectioneries to the United States if\r\nthey contain Cuban sugar. No company in the world\r\ncan export automobiles or other equipment to the\r\nUnited States, unless they certify first that the metals\r\nused in the manufacture do not contain any Cuban\r\nnickel.\r\nThe blockade prevents the entry into United\r\nStates ports of vessels that have carried goods towards\r\nor from Cuba. Not United States vessels, but vessels\r\nfrom the countries that delegates to the General\r\nAssembly represent. Those vessels cannot go to the\r\nUnited States if they have first entered a Cuban port.\r\nThat is the Torricelli Act, signed by President Bush, Sr.\r\nin 1992.\r\nUnder the Helms-Burton Act, the blockade\r\nprevents investments by third-country companies in\r\nCuba, claiming that they relate to properties that are\r\nsubject to claims by the United States. For that reason,\r\nexecutives of Canada’s Sherritt International\r\nCorporation are still under sanctions — and last year,\r\nbecause of that threat, the Jamaican tourism company\r\nSuperClubs withdrew from Cuba.\r\nThe blockade also violates the constitutional\r\nrights of the American people. It prevents them from\r\ntravelling to Cuba and from enjoying our culture and\r\nengaging in a free exchange with the Cuban people.\r\nWhen Cuba is speaking in this forum, we are not\r\nsimply doing it to defend the rights of the Cuban\r\n20\r\nA/60/PV.45\r\npeople, we are also doing it in defence of the rights of\r\nthe American people, with whom we have feelings of\r\nfriendship and respect. The American people are not\r\nguilty of our suffering and the unjust and genocidal\r\npolicy that their Government maintains against our\r\ncountry. We are also speaking in defence of the rights\r\nof the entire international community — rights that are\r\nviolated by the illegal unilateral policy.\r\nThe blockade also affects the economic interests\r\nof the United States, not just the rights of the United\r\nStates. According to a study of June 2005, released by\r\nthe Center for Business and Economic Research of the\r\nUniversity of Southern Alabama, the removal of the\r\nblockade could generate 100,000 new jobs and\r\nadditional revenues of up to $6 billion for the United\r\nStates economy.\r\nFor many years we have observed that the\r\ndelegation of the United States, which is present here\r\ntoday, has refused to take part in the debate preceding\r\nthis vote. I believe it is because they do not have any\r\nideas, not a single argument, and for that reason they\r\nhave abstained from even defending their position in\r\nthe general debate. They are overwhelmed by the fact\r\nthat over 20 delegations have made statements\r\nexplaining their position here, before the Cuban\r\ndelegation has spoken. The United States is silent\r\nbecause, perhaps, as President Abraham Lincoln said,\r\n“You cannot fool all the people all the time”.\r\nI must say that we also understand that the United\r\nStates decision is a type of moral capitulation. You\r\nneed more than power, you need ethics and moral\r\nauthority, and that is not won by force, or by war, or\r\nwith weapons. Moral authority is won with exemplary\r\nacts and with respect for the rights of others, even\r\nthough they may be small and poor.\r\nI know that the United States is still on the list to\r\nspeak later in explanation of vote, therefore I cannot\r\ncomment on their opinions. However, I can guarantee\r\nthat in the right of reply, the Cuban delegation will\r\nreject every lie and will reiterate every truth that must\r\nbe expressed in this forum.\r\nLastly, I wish to stress that the blockade against\r\nCuba must be lifted. The United States Government\r\nmust cease its aggression against Cuba. Once and for\r\nall it must recognize our right to self-determination.\r\nThe United States Government is delusional — I\r\nsay this frankly — with its idea that it can overthrow\r\nthe Cuban Revolution. It disguises its plans and refers\r\nto what would be a gross and bloody annexation of\r\nCuba as a transition. But they are wrong. They are\r\noverlooking the courage, the spirit of independence\r\nand the political awareness that the revolution has\r\ninstilled in the Cuban people.\r\nThe steadfastness and the sense of dignity shown\r\nby five Cuban youths, heroes in the fight against\r\nterrorism who are political prisoners in United States\r\njails, whose families, whose wives, whose mothers,\r\nwhose sons, are following this debate in Havana,\r\nconfident in the sense of justice of the delegations in\r\nthis Hall attest to the indomitable spirit with which the\r\nCubans defend today, and will always defend, our right\r\nto build a more just, solidarity-based and human\r\nsociety.\r\nOn behalf of those five heroes; on behalf of the\r\nCuban children and youths who have been forced to\r\nlive all their lives under the blockade; on behalf of the\r\ngenerous, happy and courageous people back in Cuba\r\nwho rely on the Assembly because they know that the\r\nworld has seen Cubans fighting, teaching and healing\r\nwherever their services have been required, because\r\nthey know that the world has always seen Cubans\r\ngiving not out of abundance but sharing what little they\r\nhave; on behalf of Cuba’s right, which is also\r\neveryone’s right today, which is the right of all\r\nmembers and the right of the peoples they represent in\r\nthis Assembly, I respectfully ask all members to vote in\r\nfavour of draft resolution A/60/L.9, entitled “Necessity\r\nof ending the economic, commercial and financial\r\nembargo imposed by the United States of America\r\nagainst Cuba”.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on this item. We shall now\r\nproceed to consider draft resolution A/60/L.9. Before\r\ngiving the floor to the speakers in explanation of the\r\nvote before the vote, may I remind the Assembly that\r\nexplanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and\r\nshould be made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Johnston (United Kingdom): I have the\r\nhonour of delivering this statement on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union. The acceding countries Bulgaria and\r\nRomania, the candidate countries Turkey and Croatia,\r\nthe countries of the Stabilization and Association\r\nProcess and potential candidates Albania, Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, the former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia and Serbia and Montenegro, the European\r\n21\r\nA/60/PV.45\r\nFree Trade Association countries Iceland and Norway,\r\nmembers of the European Economic Area, as well as\r\nUkraine and the Republic of Moldova, align\r\nthemselves with this statement.\r\nThe European Union believes that the United\r\nStates trade policy towards Cuba is fundamentally a\r\nbilateral issue. Notwithstanding this, the European\r\nUnion and its member States have been clearly\r\nexpressing their opposition to the extraterritorial\r\nextension of the United States embargo, such as that\r\ncontained in the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 and the\r\nHelms-Burton Act of 1996.\r\nIn November 1996, the Council of Ministers of\r\nthe European Union adopted a regulation and a joint\r\naction to protect the interests of natural or legal\r\npersons resident in the European Union against the\r\nextraterritorial effects of the Helms-Burton legislation,\r\nwhich prohibits compliance with that legislation.\r\nMoreover, on 18 May 1998, at the European\r\nUnion/United States summit held in London, a package\r\nwas agreed covering waivers to titles III and IV of the\r\nHelms-Burton Act, a commitment by the United States\r\nadministration to resist future extraterritorial\r\nlegislation of that kind and an understanding with\r\nrespect to disciplines for the strengthening of\r\ninvestment protection. The European Union continues\r\nto urge the United States to implement its side of the\r\n18 May 1998 understanding.\r\nThe European Union’s policy towards Cuba is\r\nclear and was set out in a Common Position in 1996.\r\nThe objective of the European Union in its relations\r\nwith Cuba is to encourage a process of transition to\r\npluralist democracy and respect for human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms, as well as an improvement in\r\nthe living standards of the Cuban people. Member\r\nStates reaffirmed their commitment to the Common\r\nPosition most recently on 13 June 2005.\r\nThe European Union believes that critical\r\nengagement with the Cuban Government, along with\r\ndialogue with wider Cuban civil society, is the most\r\neffective way to promote peaceful change in Cuba.\r\nHowever, the European Union considers that full\r\ncooperation with Cuba will depend upon improvements\r\nin human rights and political freedom in that country.\r\nThe European Union remains deeply concerned about\r\nthe human rights situation in Cuba. Following the\r\narrests and sentencing of 75 members of the peaceful\r\nopposition in spring 2003, the situation has not\r\nimproved, and in the past few months, has deteriorated.\r\nIn July, the Presidency of the European Union issued\r\nstatements condemning the suppression of peaceful\r\ndemonstrations by the State and the arrests of a number\r\nof people connected with peaceful demonstrations. In\r\nSeptember, the European Union issued a declaration\r\nabout the situation of three political prisoners who\r\nwere on hunger strike in protest against harsh\r\ntreatment, all of whom were suffering severe health\r\nproblems. The European Union urges the Cuban\r\nGovernment unconditionally to release all political\r\nprisoners and appeals to the Cuban authorities to\r\ncooperate fully with international human rights bodies\r\nand mechanisms.\r\nThe Cuban Government’s achievements in\r\nhealthcare and education are undermined by its\r\nrestrictions on civil, political and economic rights.\r\nDomestic Cuban economic policy, as well as the\r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed\r\nby the United States, seriously hampers the economic\r\ndevelopment of Cuba, negatively affecting the\r\nstandards of living of the Cuban people. The European\r\nUnion believes that the lifting of the United States\r\ntrade embargo would open Cuba’s economy, to the\r\nbenefit of the Cuban people. The European Union also\r\nurges the Cuban Government to bring about change in\r\nthe economic field, particularly by lifting restrictions\r\non private enterprise.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, and therefore in spite\r\nof its serious criticism of Cuba’s human rights record,\r\nthe European Union intends to vote in favour of draft\r\nresolution A/60/L.9.\r\nMr. Godard (United States of America): The\r\nUnited States trade embargo is a bilateral issue and\r\nshould not come before the General Assembly. But\r\nsince Cuba has raised the issue, we would like to\r\ndiscuss the root of the problems the Cuban people face\r\nevery day: the failed policies of Fidel Castro. As his\r\neconomic policies harm the Cuban people, Castro tries\r\nto blame the United States for the failures of the\r\nGovernment he leads. This resolution makes frequent\r\nmention of free trade, for instance, yet Castro denies\r\nfree trade to the Cuban people.\r\nCastro continues with his cynical and baseless\r\nclaims that the embargo denies Cuba access to food\r\nand medicine. But he knows that since 1992, the\r\nUnited States has licensed over $1.1 billion in the sale\r\nand donation of medicine and medical equipment for\r\n22\r\nA/60/PV.45\r\nthe Cuban people. Castro knows that the United States\r\nGovernment has licensed the export of over $5 billion\r\nworth of agricultural commodities in the past five\r\nyears.\r\nIf the people of Cuba are jobless or hungry or\r\nlack medical care, as Castro admits, it is because of his\r\neconomic mismanagement, not the embargo. Castro\r\nhas long blocked democracy and economic freedom for\r\nthe Cuban people, even denying them the right to many\r\nforms of self-government. Castro gives his people a\r\nstark choice: work for his regime, or starve. Then he\r\nblames the embargo for the problems he has created.\r\nCastro claims that the embargo is a blockade. He\r\nknows this is a lie. Cuba is free to trade with any other\r\ncountry in the world without interference from the\r\nUnited States. Castro knows that the real reason behind\r\nCuba’s trade problems is the failure of his country to\r\npay its bills, and billions of dollars of loans in arrears.\r\nCastro is fully aware that the United Nations Economic\r\nCommission for Latin America and the Caribbean has\r\nconcluded that Cuba must promote small business\r\nopportunities to revive its suffering economy. But\r\nCastro sees a corner store as a threat to his power, so\r\nhe continues to block free-market reforms.\r\nFidel Castro knows what it will take to end the\r\nembargo: reforms that will benefit the Cuban people.\r\nIn 2002, we challenged Castro to permit free and fair\r\nelections to the National Assembly. We challenged\r\nCastro to open the Cuban economy and allow\r\nindependent trade unions. President Bush made clear\r\nthat his response to such concrete reforms would be an\r\neffort with the United States Congress to ease\r\nrestriction on trade and travel between the United\r\nStates and Cuba. Castro replied to that challenge for\r\nfreedom with the imprisonment of human rights leaders\r\nand trade unionists.\r\nThe impediment to a new and vibrant relationship\r\nbetween the United States and Cuba is the dictatorship\r\nin Havana. The way forward is through a genuine\r\ntransition to political and economic liberty for the\r\nCuban people. The moment the Cuban people are fully\r\nfree is when the floodgates of travel and commerce\r\nshould open. That will be the moment when the\r\nAmerican economy can actually help transform Cuba’s\r\nfailed and bankrupt economic system and give Cubans\r\nthemselves the economic freedom and opportunity long\r\ndenied to them by the dictatorship. United States and\r\nCuban economic interests will naturally coincide and\r\nbecome robust when Cuba is free.\r\nThe United States opposes Fidel Castro and his\r\npolicies of repression. We support the Cuban people\r\nwho yearn for freedom. We know that Castro will\r\ncontinue to claim that the United States is the only\r\nproblem facing Cuba and that he will use support of\r\nthis resolution as support for his regime and its\r\nrepressive policies, just as he has in the past.\r\nCastro knows that the United States supports\r\nCubans who seek the right to independent trade unions\r\nand to open small businesses. Castro knows the United\r\nStates supports Cubans who ask for basic human rights\r\nas recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights. Castro knows that because the United States\r\nsupports the rights of the Cuban people, we strongly\r\noppose this draft resolution.\r\nThe United States will vote against this draft\r\nresolution, and we encourage all other delegations to\r\ndo the same.\r\nMr. Song Se Il (Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea): The United States has continued to impose\r\nsanctions on Cuba for over 40 years. Since 1991, the\r\nGeneral Assembly has been discussing and adopting\r\nresolutions on ending the economic embargo imposed\r\nby the United States against Cuba. These resolutions,\r\nsupported by an overwhelming majority of United\r\nNations Member States, has not yet been implemented,\r\ndue to the behaviour of the United States. My\r\ndelegation is of the view that the United States should\r\nbe held accountable for that failure.\r\nThe most serious concern for the international\r\ncommunity is that the United States maintains its anti-\r\nCuba policy by means of unilateral sanctions. To cite\r\njust one example, in May 2004, the United States took\r\na new measure aimed at further consolidating its\r\nsanctions against Cuba, under the pretext of\r\naccelerating the latter’s democratic transition. Its\r\nsanctions against Cuba amount to a wanton\r\ninfringement of the independence of a sovereign State,\r\nand an expression of unilateral arbitrariness that\r\nignores the principles and norms of the United Nations\r\nCharter and international law. It is the consistent and\r\nprincipled position of the Government of the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea to oppose all\r\nunilateral sanctions against sovereign States.\r\n23\r\nA/60/PV.45\r\nThe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea\r\nexpresses its full support for and solidarity with the\r\nstruggle of the Cuban people for justice and for\r\nimplementing their vision, and urges the United States\r\nto end the economic, commercial and financial\r\nembargo against Cuba in accordance with the relevant\r\nresolutions of the General Assembly.\r\nBased on that consistent principled position, the\r\ndelegation of the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea strongly supports and will vote in favour of the\r\ndraft resolution submitted by Cuba, entitled “Necessity\r\nof ending the economic, commercial and financial\r\nembargo imposed by the United States of America\r\nagainst Cuba” (A/60/L.9).\r\nMr. Chulkov (Russian Federation) (spoke in\r\nRussian): Russia consistently maintains its position on\r\nthe inadmissibility of applying unilateral\r\nextraterritorial measures in international relations. In\r\ntoday’s world, any effort to isolate an individual\r\ncountry is, in our view, counterproductive.\r\nOur State, like the majority of United Nations\r\nMember States, strongly condemns the United States\r\nembargo against Cuba and calls for lifting it\r\nimmediately. Since 1994, at various sessions of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, Russia has supported the resolution\r\non the necessity of ending the economic, commercial\r\nand financial embargo imposed by the United States of\r\nAmerica against Cuba. We are convinced that ending\r\nthe embargo and normalizing United States-Cuban\r\nrelations overall would help improve Cuba’s situation,\r\nand help it to become more engaged in international\r\nand regional processes.\r\nRussia believes that any continuation of the\r\nUnited States trade, economic and financial blockade\r\nagainst Cuba is not in keeping with the spirit of the\r\ntime and does not promote modern international\r\nrelations. Moreover, such a continuation is simply a\r\nrelic of the cold war era and its legacy of ideological\r\nconfrontation. It slows down the formation of a new\r\nequitable international regime for the twenty-first\r\ncentury which would be based on the fundamental\r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and on\r\ninternational law.\r\nThe recent decision to tighten sanctions against\r\nCuba is an indication that the United States\r\nadministration unfortunately continues to rely on\r\nrepressive approaches. The new turn in the spiral of\r\nworsening Cuban-United States relations is a matter of\r\nserious concern to us; it will lead to greater\r\nconfrontation between the two countries and interfere\r\nwith the establishment of any constructive dialogue.\r\nRussia is guided by these points, and is in\r\nsolidarity with the frequently expressed wishes of the\r\nvast majority of the membership of the United Nations\r\nto resolve all disputes and disagreements without diktat\r\nand without force. Accordingly, Russia, at the current\r\nsession of the General Assembly, will once again vote\r\nin support of the draft resolution calling for the lifting\r\nof the blockade and for the normalization of Cuban-\r\nUnited States relations (A/60/L.9). That would be in\r\nthe interest of the Cuban and the United States peoples\r\nand would have a positive impact on the overall\r\nsituation in the region of Central America and the\r\nCaribbean as a whole, and indeed throughout the\r\nworld.\r\nMr. Chidyausiku (Zimbabwe): This morning we\r\nhave heard eloquent statements in connection with the\r\neconomic embargo imposed by the United States\r\nagainst the Cuban people. We have also heard the\r\nUnited States declare that this is a bilateral issue. If it\r\nis a bilateral issue, why then is the United States\r\nlegislating on behalf of other countries that are\r\nengaging in trade with Cuba?\r\nZimbabwe has always adhered to the principle of\r\nrespect for the fundamental principles of the sovereign\r\nequality of States, non-interference in their internal\r\naffairs, and freedom of international trade and\r\nnavigation. Zimbabwe has consistently advocated the\r\nrevocation of laws and measures that have been and are\r\nbeing applied on a unilateral basis against Member\r\nStates. The extraterritorial consequences of such\r\nactions affect the sovereignty of other States, the\r\nlawful interests of their peoples and of persons under\r\ntheir jurisdiction, and their freedom to trade and\r\nnavigate.\r\nCuba, as a sovereign State, has a right to decide\r\nwhat path to follow in the area of development. We do\r\nnot believe that any country has the right to determine\r\nor dictate which path Cuba should follow. There is no\r\nreason, therefore, why any country should impose an\r\neconomic embargo imposed on Cuba simply because\r\nits views differ from Cuba’s as to the latter’s economic\r\npolicies.\r\nFor the past four decades, all United Nations\r\ndebates on this issue have shown a growing wave of\r\nprotest against unilateral and coercive economic\r\n24\r\nA/60/PV.45\r\nmeasures applied for political purposes. In spite of the\r\nnumerous appeals made from this very rostrum and of\r\nthe relevant General Assembly resolutions, the United\r\nStates has not yet deemed it prudent to put an end to\r\nthe unilateral measures it has imposed on the people\r\nand the Government of Cuba. That extension of the\r\nterritorial jurisdiction of the United States to other\r\ncountries is contrary to the principles of national\r\nsovereignty and of non-intervention in the internal\r\naffairs of other States, as recognized in the\r\njurisprudence of the International Court of Justice.\r\nThis United States policy undermines the right of\r\npeoples to self-determination and development. It\r\ncontravenes the principles of freedom of trade and\r\nnavigation and of the movement of capital. The United\r\nStates embargo against Cuba is cruel, anachronistic and\r\ncounterproductive. It is also illegitimate and immoral,\r\nbecause it contravenes international law and the\r\nprovisions of the World Trade Organization (WTO).\r\nThere is no justification for the continuation of such\r\nhostile policies.\r\nAs a current victim of domestic laws and\r\nlegislation with extraterritorial impact, Zimbabwe fully\r\nunderstands the need to end the unilateral and illegal\r\neconomic embargo on Cuba. Zimbabwe therefore\r\nstands firmly by the heroic people of Cuba in their\r\nfight against this illegal embargo and will vote in\r\nfavour of the draft resolution before the Assembly.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\ntake a decision on draft resolution A/60/L.9.\r\nA recorded vote has been requested.\r\nA recorded vote was taken.\r\nIn favour:\r\nAfghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Andorra, Angola,\r\nAntigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Armenia,\r\nAustralia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Bahrain,\r\nBangladesh, Barbados, Belarus, Belgium, Belize,\r\nBenin, Bhutan, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nBotswana, Brazil, Brunei Darussalam, Bulgaria,\r\nBurkina Faso, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon,\r\nCanada, Cape Verde, Central African Republic,\r\nChad, Chile, China, Colombia, Comoros, Congo,\r\nCosta Rica, Côte d’Ivoire, Croatia, Cuba, Cyprus,\r\nCzech Republic, Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea, Democratic Republic of the Congo,\r\nDenmark, Djibouti, Dominica, Dominican\r\nRepublic, Ecuador, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea,\r\nEritrea, Estonia, Ethiopia, Fiji, Finland, France,\r\nGabon, Gambia, Georgia, Germany, Ghana, Greece,\r\nGrenada, Guatemala, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau,\r\nGuyana, Haiti, Honduras, Hungary, Iceland, India,\r\nIndonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Ireland, Italy,\r\nJamaica, Japan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya,\r\nKiribati, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Lao People’s\r\nDemocratic Republic, Latvia, Lebanon, Lesotho,\r\nLiberia, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Liechtenstein,\r\nLithuania, Luxembourg, Madagascar, Malawi,\r\nMalaysia, Maldives, Mali, Malta, Mauritania,\r\nMauritius, Mexico, Monaco, Mongolia,\r\nMozambique, Myanmar, Namibia, Nauru, Nepal,\r\nNetherlands, New Zealand, Niger, Nigeria, Norway,\r\nOman, Pakistan, Panama, Papua New Guinea,\r\nParaguay, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal,\r\nQatar, Republic of Korea, Republic of Moldova,\r\nRomania, Russian Federation, Rwanda, Saint Kitts\r\nand Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the\r\nGrenadines, Samoa, San Marino, Sao Tome and\r\nPrincipe, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Serbia and\r\nMontenegro, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Singapore,\r\nSlovakia, Slovenia, Solomon Islands, Somalia,\r\nSouth Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Suriname,\r\nSwaziland, Sweden, Switzerland, Syrian Arab\r\nRepublic, Tajikistan, Thailand, the former Yugoslav\r\nRepublic of Macedonia, Timor-Leste, Togo, Tonga,\r\nTrinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey,\r\nTurkmenistan, Tuvalu, Uganda, Ukraine, United\r\nArab Emirates, United Kingdom of Great Britain\r\nand Northern Ireland, United Republic of Tanzania,\r\nUruguay, Uzbekistan, Vanuatu, Venezuela, Viet\r\nNam, Yemen, Zambia, Zimbabwe\r\nAgainst:\r\nIsrael, Marshall Islands, Palau, United States of\r\nAmerica\r\nAbstaining:\r\nMicronesia (Federated States of)\r\nDraft resolution A/60/L.9 was adopted by 182\r\nvotes to 4, with 1 abstention (resolution 60/12).\r\nThe Acting President: I shall now call on those\r\nrepresentatives who wish to speak in explanation of\r\nvote on the resolution just adopted. May I remind\r\ndelegations that explanations of vote are limited to 10\r\nminutes and should be made by delegations from their\r\nseats.\r\nMs. Rivero (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): My\r\ndelegation has the honour to take the floor on behalf of\r\n25\r\nA/60/PV.45\r\nthe MERCOSUR member States: Argentina, Brazil,\r\nParaguay and Uruguay and the associated States\r\nBolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and\r\nVenezuela.\r\nAs on former occasions, and with the firm\r\nconviction that it is necessary to put an end to the\r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed\r\nby the United States against Cuba, we have voted in\r\nfavour of the resolution, which has been adopted\r\nalmost unanimously by the international community.\r\nMERCOSUR and its associated States,\r\ncommitted to the purposes and principles enshrined in\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations, have repeatedly\r\nexpressed their categorical rejection of unilateral and\r\nextraterritorial coercive measures that are contrary to\r\ninternational law.\r\nOur countries, whose international policies\r\ninclude freedom of trade and of navigation and which\r\npromote the development of trade on the basis of\r\ncompliance with our legal obligations as members of\r\nthe World Trade Organization, strongly oppose foreign\r\nlaws that directly or indirectly violate the principle of\r\nnon-intervention in internal affairs or infringe on the\r\nsovereignty of States.\r\nWe are convinced that the imposition of unilateral\r\ncoercive measures does not help to promote the\r\ndemocratic system in all of its diversity; rather, it\r\nundermines human rights, particularly the right of\r\npeoples to development.\r\nThat is why our countries, on more than one\r\noccasion and in various international forums such as\r\nthe Organization of American States (OAS), the Latin\r\nAmerican Economic System and Ibero-American and\r\nRio Group summits, have spoken out in favour of\r\neffective multilateralism and of the elimination of\r\nunilateral coercive measures, which only exacerbate\r\ntensions and undermine the international cooperation\r\nthat is required to achieve development, security and\r\nhuman rights for all, which we strongly advocate.\r\nMr. Southcott (Australia): Australia shares\r\nconcerns about the state of human rights and political\r\nfreedoms in Cuba, but we do not consider that isolating\r\nCuba through economic sanctions is an effective means\r\nof achieving human rights and political reform.\r\nAustralia has consistently expressed its opposition, as a\r\nmatter of principle, to the promulgation and application\r\nby States Members of the United Nations of laws and\r\nmeasures, the extraterritorial effects of which affect the\r\nsovereignty of other States, the legitimate interests of\r\nentities or persons under their jurisdiction as well as\r\nfreedom of trade and navigation.\r\nIn Australia’s view, such laws and measures are\r\nnot justified by the principles of international law and\r\ncomity. We are therefore concerned about the\r\nextraterritorial aspects of the Helms-Burton Act of\r\n1996. For those reasons, Australia has again voted for\r\nthe resolution submitted under the agenda item.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in explanation of vote after the vote. One\r\nrepresentative requested to exercise the right of reply.\r\nMay I remind members that, in accordance with\r\nGeneral Assembly decision 34/401, statements in\r\nexercise of the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes\r\nfor the first intervention and to 5 minutes for the\r\nsecond and should be made by delegations from their\r\nseats.\r\nI call on the representative of Cuba.\r\nMs. Núñez (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): Year after\r\nyear, we have listened to the representatives of the\r\nEuropean Union repeat their hackneyed arguments to\r\nexplain their vote, during the adoption of the resolution\r\nthat condemns the blockade by the United States of\r\nAmerica against the Cuban people. They seem to beg\r\nforgiveness when faced with the responsibility to\r\nacknowledge the undeniable. One cannot prevent a\r\npeople from exercising its legitimate right to choose its\r\nown destiny in order to build a more just society, where\r\nthe greatest benefits are not distributed among a few\r\noligarchs.\r\nThe European Union, through a complex word\r\ngame, is trying to hide the fact that the United States\r\nhas launched an economic war against Cuba, that it is\r\ntruly committing genocide and has been causing\r\nserious damage to the Cuban people for more than 47\r\nyears, only because of Cuba’s refusal to become a\r\npawn in the geopolitics of that unipolar Power. The\r\nEuropean Union is only interested in the extraterritorial\r\ncontent of the imperial decree, not in its victims, the\r\nmen and women of Cuba. The worst fallacy is trying to\r\nsuggest that we deserve such actions.\r\nIt seems that unless its economic interests are\r\naffected, the European Union will show itself to be\r\nindifferent or, worse still, cooperative, if the empire\r\n26\r\nA/60/PV.45\r\ndecides to apply sanctions that go against international\r\nlaw and against a dignified and brave people.\r\nThe European Union acts as an accomplice to the\r\nUnited States, when they favour and condone the false\r\npretext that has been created to maintain and\r\nstrengthen the hostile policy of genocide against the\r\nCuban people. How can they dare speak of human\r\nrights — those who have extended a cloak of impunity\r\nto the perpetrators of atrocious human rights violations\r\nin the concentration camps established in the territory\r\nthat is illegally occupied in Guantánamo, as well as\r\nextrajudicial executions and cruel and humiliating\r\ntorture at Abu Ghraib.\r\nNothing about the United States statement\r\nsurprises us. Their speech is full of hate and void of\r\narguments and provides new evidence of the arrogance\r\nof a super-Power in decline, with claims of imperial\r\ndomination on a planetary scale. We will reveal once\r\nand for all those lies. The racist, fascist, aggressive,\r\ndictatorial Bush Administration is attacking our\r\ncountry precisely because we are defending, protecting\r\nand promoting all of the human rights of all Cubans,\r\nseven of ten of whom have grown up under the\r\nconstant threat of their powerful neighbour.\r\nThe agents of the new conservative doctrine of\r\nthe Bush Administration have toughened the blockade\r\nagainst our country because it demonstrates a\r\ncontagious example of dignity and resistance.\r\nIn Cuba, electoral fraud, such as the one that\r\nallowed Bush to usurp the presidency in the year 2000,\r\nis not possible. In Cuba, the national wealth is not\r\nstolen by corrupt leaders and transnational\r\ncorporations. They cannot exploit or contaminate our\r\nheritage. There are no unproductive farms. The United\r\nFruit Company cannot continue taking land away from\r\nfarmers. There are no children’s schools that lack\r\naccess to quality health services. No Cuban man or\r\nwoman has to humiliate herself or himself in order to\r\nfind a job. It is one of the few countries in the world\r\nthat has achieved the goal of full employment.\r\nBush has resorted to all kinds of manoeuvres to\r\noverthrow the Cuban revolution. He has ordered\r\nmercenary invasions. He has financed terrorism. He\r\nhas designed plans to assassinate the legitimate leaders\r\nof the Cuban people, and he has mounted his unceasing\r\nradio-electronic war against our country. The\r\nrepresentatives of the empire finance, direct and recruit\r\nmercenaries for the service of their annexationist\r\npolicies, with the purpose of reimposing new colonial\r\ndomination over the Cuban people. It is not the\r\nsovereign decision of the Cuban people to build\r\nsocialism, but rather the genocide of the American\r\nblockade, that impedes all facets of the economic and\r\nsocial development of my country.\r\nWhat we have achieved thus far has been\r\npossible, thanks to the determination of the Cubans\r\nwho have resisted brutal aggression for over half a\r\ncentury — paying a high price for their indomitable\r\nwill to defend their right to national independence and\r\ntheir right to live a life of dignity and respect.\r\nIt is a lie that the Government of the United\r\nStates sells food and medicine to Cuba. Cuba must\r\ncarry out those purchases by overcoming the most\r\ndifficult obstacles.\r\nThe statements we have listened to reveal the\r\ndouble standard and hypocrisy with which the\r\nEuropean Union and the United States claim to judge\r\nothers. Their arrogant statements cannot hide the\r\ncolonial and racist inspiration behind their behaviour.\r\nWithout addressing the sad situation of thousands of\r\nmen and women who are condemned to prostitution in\r\nof some of their most prominent cities, everyone\r\nknows that in Europe, racism, racial discrimination and\r\nxenophobia are on the rise. In recent years, that trend\r\nhas become even stronger.\r\nThe same European Governments that cry\r\ncrocodile tears for a handful of mercenaries that betray\r\ntheir people have, for two consecutive years, prevented\r\nthe Commission on Human Rights from adopting a\r\ndraft resolution that only attempted to investigate the\r\nsituation of individuals who have been condemned to\r\nscandalous and humiliating practices of torture and to\r\nthe condition of non-people in the naval base of the\r\nUnited States in Guantánamo. They have not said a\r\nword about that torture, nor concerning the hunger\r\nstrikes of some of those inmates — issues which have\r\nbeen discussed at length in the international press.\r\nThey cannot teach us anything about human\r\nrights. They conduct war only to enrich their military\r\nindustrial complex and torture in the name of a false\r\nfreedom. We can learn nothing of human rights from\r\nthe richest society in the world, where the opulence is\r\nsuch that 44 million people do not have access to its\r\nhospitals. They can teach us nothing about human\r\nrights while their caste of politicians carries out fraud\r\nand uses deceit to run their empire. They can teach us\r\n27\r\nA/60/PV.45\r\nnothing of human rights, when they are incapable of\r\npreventing the deaths of thousands of their citizens and\r\nhave abandoned them to their fate at the hands of\r\nnature’s fury.\r\nCuba rejects, word for word, the statements of the\r\nrepresentatives of the European Union and the United\r\nStates. We do not acknowledge that they have any\r\nmoral authority from them, to judge the heroic Cuban\r\npeople. The march undertaken by the Cuban people for\r\nmore than 40 years is irreversible, despite the\r\nopposition and aggressiveness of the greatest Power in\r\nhistory and its acolytes.\r\nIn Cuba, there will be no false revolution\r\norganized by the secret services of the Western Powers.\r\nIn Cuba, there is already a true revolution, which is a\r\ngenuinely popular and indigenous revolution that has\r\nmade it possible for the Cuban people to\r\nbuild —\r\nThe Acting President: I am sorry that I have to\r\ninterrupt the representative of the Cuban delegation\r\nbut the 10 minute period is up. May I ask her to be\r\nkind enough to conclude her statement?\r\nMs. Núñez (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): I am\r\nconcluding, Sir. If you just give me one more minute, I\r\nwill finish.\r\nThis revolution has consolidated the deepest\r\nfeelings of solidarity among the Cuban people, who\r\ncooperate with their brothers and sisters in every part\r\nof the world. We have powerful enemies, but we know\r\nthat most people in the world respect and admire our\r\ncourage. The Cuban people has devoted itself to\r\nbuilding its present and its future and will never\r\nretreat.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is the\r\nwish of the Assembly to conclude its consideration of\r\nagenda item 18?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.15 p.m.\r\n"
