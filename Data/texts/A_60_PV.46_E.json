(Sweden)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Gaspar\r\nMartins (Angola), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 81\r\nReport of the International Criminal Court\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/60/177)\r\nThe Acting President: I call on Mr. Philippe\r\nKirsch, President of the International Criminal Court.\r\nMr. Kirsch (International Criminal Court): It is\r\nan honour and a pleasure for me to speak to the\r\nAssembly today on the occasion of the first report of\r\nthe International Criminal Court (ICC) to the United\r\nNations. The United Nations, and the General\r\nAssembly in particular, have always been closely\r\nlinked to the Court. In 1989, this body began the\r\nprocess of establishing the ICC with a request to the\r\nInternational Law Commission. In the mid-1990s, the\r\nGeneral Assembly was the driving force behind efforts\r\nto develop a statute for a court, and it was this body\r\nthat convened the Rome Conference in 1998, which\r\nwould adopt the statute of the ICC.\r\nThe Court welcomes its observer status before the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the opportunity to submit\r\nreports on our activities in accordance with the\r\nRelationship Agreement between our institutions. In\r\nmy remarks today, I would like first to update the\r\nAssembly on where the Court stands, and secondly, to\r\nspeak about the cooperative relationship between the\r\nCourt and the United Nations.\r\nSince the Court submitted its written report, there\r\nhave been two significant developments. First, Mexico\r\ndeposited its instrument of ratification of the Rome\r\nStatute with the Secretary-General on 28 October.\r\nMexico is thus the 100th State to become a party to the\r\nstatute. That is an important milestone in the Court’s\r\ndevelopment. Secondly, the Court has issued its first\r\narrest warrants. On 8 July, Pre-Trial Chamber II issued\r\nthe first arrest warrants of the Court in the situation in\r\nUganda. Warrants have been issued for five members\r\nof the Lord’s Resistance Army for alleged crimes\r\nagainst humanity and war crimes. Subject to the\r\nnecessary cooperation in the arrest and surrender of\r\npersons, the first trials could begin next year.\r\nThe Court is now well into the judicial phase of\r\nits activities, involving both operations in the field and\r\ncourtroom proceedings. As members know, four\r\nsituations have been referred to the Court’s Prosecutor.\r\nThree States parties have referred situations on their\r\nown territories and the Security Council, acting under\r\nChapter VII of the United Nations Charter, has referred\r\nthe situation in Darfur, in the Sudan, to the Court. In\r\naddition, Côte d’Ivoire, a non-State party, has declared\r\nits acceptance of jurisdiction over crimes on its\r\nterritory. The Prosecutor has opened and is conducting\r\ninvestigations into the situations in Uganda, the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and Darfur. The\r\nstatute specifies the criteria to be considered by the\r\n2\r\nA/60/PV.46\r\nProsecutor in selecting situations. The Prosecutor has\r\nindicated that gravity is a major factor and that Uganda\r\nand the Democratic Republic of the Congo are the\r\ngravest situations under the treaty-based jurisdiction of\r\nthe Court. The Prosecutor has also indicated that the\r\nDarfur situation, referred by the Security Council, is\r\ngraver still.\r\nEach situation referred to the Court has been\r\nassigned to a pre-trial chamber consisting of three\r\njudges. The pre-trial chambers have responsibility for\r\nthe judicial aspects of situations during the\r\ninvestigations phase. The pre-trial chambers have held\r\nhearings and issued decisions on a number of issues,\r\nincluding the arrest warrants.\r\nWe must remember that the Court’s investigations\r\nare occurring in situations of ongoing conflict. The\r\nsecurity of Court staff, victims, witnesses and others\r\nwho could be affected by the Court’s activities are\r\nparamount concerns. Field operations also present\r\nchallenges in terms of establishing reliable and secure\r\nlogistics, transportation and communication in three\r\ndifferent situations. Each situation individually also\r\npresents its own specific needs, such as in terms of\r\nlocal language capacity requirements. Those\r\ncircumstances present practical challenges not only for\r\nthe Prosecutor in his investigations, but also for the\r\nCourt’s other related field activities. Those activities\r\ninclude protecting the rights of defence, conducting\r\noutreach to explain the Court to affected local\r\npopulations, and carrying out the Court’s specific\r\nmandate in relation to victims and witnesses.\r\nThe Court does not have a police force of its own.\r\nInstead, the Court relies on the cooperation of States\r\nand other actors to carry out many essential functions. I\r\nhave already mentioned that the cooperation of States\r\nwill be required in arresting persons wanted by the\r\nCourt. I must be very clear on that point — cooperation\r\nin arrest and surrender of persons is essential if there\r\nare to be trials.\r\nOther forms of cooperation will be equally\r\nimportant. The Court has negotiated and is negotiating\r\na range of agreements with States and international\r\norganizations on both general cooperation and specific\r\nissues. The Court has concluded several agreements\r\nwith States on the relocation of witnesses. The Court\r\nrecently concluded the first agreement with a State\r\nparty regarding the enforcement of sentences. A\r\nnetwork of effective cooperation is critical to the\r\nsuccess of the Court. I hope that other States will soon\r\nconclude other such agreements with the Court.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nI should like to refer briefly to a particular form\r\nof cooperation that is of specific interest: cooperation\r\nbetween the Court and the United Nations.\r\nThe Rome Statute, which defines the Court’s\r\nactivities, reaffirms the purposes and principles of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter. The statute’s preamble\r\nexplicitly sets forth several specific objectives that\r\noverlap with those of the United Nations. Those\r\nobjectives include, first and foremost, the prevention\r\nand punishment of the most serious international\r\ncrimes, including genocide, crimes against humanity\r\nand war crimes. Secondly, through prevention and\r\npunishment, the Court should contribute to the\r\nmaintenance and restoration of international peace and\r\nsecurity. Thirdly, the Court was designed to help in\r\ncompliance with and the implementation of\r\ninternational law.\r\nIn order to achieve our common objectives, our\r\ninstitutions must work together. That is already being\r\ndone in practice. Indeed, positive cooperation is under\r\nway in the Court’s current activities, which for the\r\nmost part are being carried out in the field. The Court’s\r\nactivities in the field are often undertaken in regions\r\nwhere the United Nations is already present. In such\r\nsituations, cooperation requires both the sharing of\r\ninformation and coordination on such issues as\r\nsecurity, transportation and logistics. The Court and the\r\nUnited Nations also cooperate in the area of\r\ninstitutional relations. In that field, the broad sharing of\r\ninformation is essential to providing the Court and the\r\nUnited Nations with precise and continuously updated\r\ninformation on their respective activities. The Court’s\r\nreport before the Assembly today is one aspect of that\r\ncooperation.\r\nThe Court intends to pursue and strengthen its\r\ncooperation with the United Nations in all spheres —\r\nin the field, procedural matters and our institutional\r\nrelations. Such cooperation will benefit both\r\ninstitutions by enabling each to refine and fulfil its\r\nobjectives.\r\nCooperation is important because both the Court\r\nand the United Nations are part of an interdependent\r\nsystem of international law and justice. In his 2004\r\n3\r\nA/60/PV.46\r\nreport to the Security Council on the rule of law and\r\ntransitional justice, the Secretary-General observed that\r\n“Our experience in the past decade has\r\ndemonstrated clearly that the consolidation of\r\npeace in the immediate post-conflict period, as\r\nwell as the maintenance of peace in the long\r\nterm, cannot be achieved unless the population is\r\nconfident that redress for grievances can be\r\nobtained through legitimate structures for the\r\npeaceful settlement of disputes and the fair\r\nadministration of justice.” (S/2004/616, para. 2)\r\nThe Court has a natural role to play in such\r\nsituations. Other discussions in the Security Council\r\nand the General Assembly have also focused on the\r\nrespective contributions of various institutions, such as\r\nthe International Criminal Court, and of our collective\r\nefforts to protect individuals against the most serious\r\ncrimes of concern to the international community as a\r\nwhole. As I have noted today, such collective efforts\r\nare made possible by regular, concrete and absolutely\r\nessential cooperation.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nOver 50 years ago, in the wake of the Holocaust,\r\nthe newly created United Nations first took up the issue\r\nof a permanent international criminal court. The\r\nGenocide Convention, adopted by this General\r\nAssembly in 1948, envisioned that that crime of crimes\r\ncould one day be punished by an international penal\r\ntribunal. The dream of a permanent international court\r\nwas deferred for far too long. Now, however, we have\r\nthe opportunity to ensure that the perpetrators of the\r\nworst atrocities no longer benefit from impunity, to\r\ndeter future perpetrators, and to build a culture of\r\naccountability. We cannot afford to fail.\r\nMr. Llewellyn (United Kingdom): I have the\r\nhonour to speak on behalf of the European Union. The\r\nfollowing States align themselves with this statement:\r\nthe acceding countries Bulgaria and Romania; the\r\ncandidate countries Croatia and Turkey; the countries\r\nof the Stabilisation and Association Process and\r\npotential candidates Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and\r\nSerbia and Montenegro; the European Free Trade\r\nAssociation country Iceland, member of the European\r\nEconomic Area; and other aligning countries Ukraine\r\nand Moldova.\r\nThe European Union welcomes the first annual\r\nreport of the International Criminal Court (ICC)\r\nsubmitted to the General Assembly and we warmly\r\nwelcome the President of the Court, Judge Philippe\r\nKirsch, and thank him for his presentation today.\r\nThe European Union is a strong supporter of the\r\nICC, has consistently and actively defended the\r\nintegrity of the Rome Statute, and will continue to do\r\nso. The establishment of the ICC is beyond doubt the\r\nmost significant development in recent years in the\r\nlong struggle to eradicate impunity for the most serious\r\ninternational crimes and thereby advance the cause of\r\njustice and the rule of law. We also view the ICC as an\r\nessential instrument for the prevention of genocide,\r\ncrimes against humanity and war crimes.\r\nThe European Union reaffirms its determination\r\nto obtain the widest possible international support for\r\nthe ICC, including by promoting the universal\r\nacceptance of the Rome Statute. More than half of the\r\nUnited Nations Members are now parties. We urge all\r\nother States also to accede without delay. We\r\nparticularly welcome the 100th ratification by Mexico\r\non 28 October 2005. We also call on all States to\r\nbecome parties to the Agreement on the Privileges and\r\nImmunities of the International Criminal Court. The\r\nEuropean Union will continue to defend the integrity\r\nof the Rome Statute and we recall the set of principles\r\nthat we have established in that regard.\r\nThe European Union welcomes the substantial\r\nprogress that has already been made in making the ICC\r\nfully operational. As the President has highlighted\r\ntoday, now that it is operational the ICC is dependent\r\non the support and cooperation of all States parties, as\r\nwell as other States, international organizations and\r\ncivil society, in order to carry out its task of\r\nprosecuting the most serious international crimes of\r\nconcern to the international community. We are\r\ndetermined to help the Court carry out that task and we\r\ncall on all concerned to give that cooperation fully.\r\nThe ICC is well and truly up and running. It has\r\nbegun to play an important role in our common efforts\r\nto establish the rule of law, to promote and encourage\r\nrespect for human rights and to restore and maintain\r\ninternational peace and security. The judges and the\r\nProsecutor took office in 2003, and the Court is now\r\ninto the judicial phase of its operations. The\r\nProsecutor, Mr. Moreno-Ocampo, is actively\r\ninvestigating situations in the Democratic Republic of\r\n4\r\nA/60/PV.46\r\nthe Congo and in northern Uganda. He launched an\r\ninvestigation into the situation in Darfur, in the Sudan,\r\nshortly after the historic decision by the Security\r\nCouncil to refer that situation. Another milestone was\r\nthe unsealing on 14 October this year of the first\r\nwarrants of arrest concerning five senior leaders of the\r\nLord’s Resistance Army for crimes against humanity\r\nand war crimes committed in Uganda. Those were the\r\nfirst warrants of arrest to be unsealed by the Court.\r\nThose decisions send very clear messages to\r\nperpetrators of the most serious crimes of international\r\nconcern.\r\nThe European Union commends the Court for its\r\noutreach activities in the field, which are carried out in\r\nrelation to those cases. It is indeed crucial that the\r\nCourt also be a reality for the victims of the most\r\nhorrendous crimes. The Rome Statute contains several\r\nunique victims-based provisions that are aimed at\r\nproviding victims with the opportunity to have their\r\nvoices heard and to obtain justice. A Trust Fund for the\r\nbenefit of the victims and their families has been set\r\nup, and we would like to encourage Member States to\r\ncontribute to the Fund and to thank those States that\r\nhave already done so. We recall the meeting earlier this\r\nyear of the Special Working Group on the Crime of\r\nAggression, which is open to all States on an equal\r\nfooting, whether or not they are parties to the Rome\r\nStatute. We commend Ambassador Wenaweser of\r\nLiechtenstein for his skilful work in moving that Group\r\nforward and we will continue to work together with\r\nhim to elaborate proposals on the crime of aggression\r\nby 2008.\r\nThe States parties to the Rome Statute are now\r\nlooking forward to the next Assembly of States Parties,\r\nwhich will take place in The Hague at the end of\r\nNovember and resume in New York during January\r\n2006. We urge all States Members of the United\r\nNations to attend that meeting.\r\nThe European Union emphasizes the importance\r\nof the conclusion in October 2004 and the\r\nimplementation of the Relationship Agreement\r\nbetween the United Nations and the ICC, which\r\nprovides for close cooperation and consultation. We\r\nthank the Secretary-General and his staff for their work\r\nin negotiating and implementing the Agreement, both\r\nat Headquarters and in the field.\r\nThe 2005 report of the ICC to the General\r\nAssembly is a very useful update and we very much\r\nappreciate the opportunity to discuss it here today with\r\nthe President of the Court. We look forward to\r\nreceiving such reports annually in the General\r\nAssembly, and we welcome very much the presence of\r\nthe ICC at the General Assembly in the capacity of\r\nobserver and look forward to its participation in next\r\nyears General Assembly debate.\r\nMrs. Ferrari (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines):\r\nI have the honour to speak on behalf of the Caribbean\r\nCommunity (CARICOM).\r\nWe wish to thank the President of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC), Judge Philippe\r\nKirsch, for his earlier presentation.\r\nThe report of the International Criminal Court,\r\nwhich we are debating today, details significant\r\nprogress in the journey of the Court towards proving its\r\nworth as a functional and effective institution. The\r\nCourt, after its genesis and organizational period, has\r\nnow entered the judicial phase of its operations. Three\r\nStates parties have referred situations to the Prosecutor\r\nof the Court, while the Security Council, in keeping\r\nwith its responsibility under the Charter for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, has\r\nreferred one situation to the Prosecutor. Investigations\r\ninto situations in the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo, Uganda and the Sudan are continuing, and just\r\nlast month the Court unsealed five warrants of arrest\r\nagainst senior leaders of the Lord’s Resistance Army\r\nfor crimes against humanity and war crimes committed\r\nin Uganda since July 2002. The warrants include\r\nallegations of murder, abduction, sexual enslavement,\r\nmutilation, rape and the forced enlistment of children.\r\nThat chilling list of some of the crimes most repugnant\r\nto mankind is exactly the kind of criminal behaviour\r\nthat the Court was designed to deter. Global events in\r\nthe recent past have reinforced, rather than diminished,\r\nour support for the principles enshrined in the Rome\r\nStatute.\r\nIn order to enhance its capacity to bring to justice\r\nthe perpetrators of genocide, crimes against humanity,\r\nwar crimes and, when included by the Assembly Of\r\nStates Parties, the crime of aggression, it is essential\r\nthat the Court receive full cooperation from a number\r\nof critical partners, such as States parties, States\r\nconcerned, and international, regional and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, in such areas as\r\npreserving and providing evidence, sharing information\r\nand securing the arrest and surrender of persons to the\r\n5\r\nA/60/PV.46\r\nCourt. It is the earnest hope of CARICOM States that\r\nsuch cooperation will be willingly given to enable the\r\nCourt to fulfil its mandate and to meet the complex and\r\nmultitudinous challenges it will face in the months and\r\nyears ahead. The Court must also be able to rely on the\r\npolitical support of States, which will guarantee justice\r\nto the victims of crimes against humanity and put an\r\nend to the culture of impunity which was so prevalent\r\nin the past in respect of such crimes. In that regard, we\r\nwelcome the signing by Austria of the first\r\nEnforcement of Sentences Agreement with the Court\r\non 27 October 2005, as provided for by article 103 of\r\nthe Statute, and wish to commend the Government of\r\nAustria for that tangible demonstration of support for\r\nthe ICC.\r\nEffective collaboration between the United\r\nNations and the Court remains of critical importance as\r\nthe Court continues to gain credibility and\r\nrespectability. The Rome Statute recognizes specific\r\nroles for the United Nations and the Security Council.\r\nThe Relationship Agreement, signed one year ago by\r\nthe President of the Court and the Secretary-General on\r\nbehalf of their respective institutions, affirms the\r\nindependence of the Court, while at the same time\r\nestablishing a framework for cooperation. CARICOM\r\ntrusts that such collaboration will be forthcoming from\r\nall quarters of the United Nations.\r\nWe view as a significant step in the consolidation\r\nof the work of the Court the Council’s decision to refer\r\nthe situation in Darfur to the Prosecutor. That decision,\r\ncontained in resolution 1593 (2005), demonstrates the\r\nimportance of cooperation between both institutions in\r\nthe quest for international peace and justice. It is our\r\nhope that that major step forward will form the basis\r\nfor developing a closer, constructive relationship in the\r\nfuture, which will ultimately benefit the victims of\r\ncrimes within the jurisdiction of the Court.\r\nCARICOM is pleased at the progress made in the\r\nintersessional meeting of the Special Working Group\r\non the Crime of Aggression and urges the participants\r\nin the Working Group to redouble their efforts towards\r\nthe completion of their mandate, to demonstrate the\r\nnecessary political will and to strive to overcome the\r\ndifficulties that stand in the way of consensus. We\r\nshould bear in mind that the review conference will be\r\nheld in the not-too-distant future and should therefore\r\nendeavour to complete our work well in advance of\r\nthat conference.\r\nCARICOM continues to support the work of the\r\nBoard of Directors of the Trust Fund for Victims. We\r\nwish to underline the critical importance that the\r\nadoption of the draft regulations of the Trust Fund for\r\nVictims will have for the effective achievement of the\r\nobjectives of the Trust Fund, since those regulations\r\nwill govern key aspects of the work of the members of\r\nthe Board, to whom we have entrusted the significant\r\ntask of establishing and directing the activities of the\r\nTrust Fund and the allocation of the property and\r\nmoney available to it.\r\nIn light of that, we urge all States parties and\r\nother participants in the working group of the bureau\r\non that issue to make every effort to reach agreement\r\non the key outstanding issues in advance of the fourth\r\nAssembly of States Parties, which will be held in The\r\nHague later this month. We wish to express our\r\nappreciation to those Governments that have\r\ncontributed generously to the Trust Fund, including\r\none CARICOM State party, Trinidad and Tobago, and\r\nencourage all States parties to give favourable\r\nconsideration to making voluntary contributions of a\r\nsubstantial nature to the Trust Fund.\r\nCARICOM warmly welcomes Mexico’s\r\nratification of the Rome Statute on 31 October. That\r\n100th ratification marks an important milestone\r\ntowards universal support of the International Criminal\r\nCourt. CARICOM wishes once again to encourage all\r\nother States that have not yet ratified the Rome Statute\r\nto do so as soon as possible. In addition, it is important\r\nthat States parties adopt, in a timely manner, the\r\nnecessary implementing legislation that will enable\r\nthem to render assistance and cooperation to the Court.\r\nWe also encourage States parties to ratify and\r\nimplement the Agreement on the Privileges and\r\nImmunities of the Court, which is an important and\r\nnecessary corollary to the proper functioning of the\r\nCourt. CARICOM also wishes to remind signatories\r\nand States parties to the Rome Statute of the need to\r\npreserve the integrity of the instrument by honouring\r\ntheir obligations under the Vienna Convention on the\r\nLaw of Treaties so as to maintain the object and\r\npurpose of the statute.\r\nIn closing, the CARICOM member States wish to\r\nreaffirm our support for and commitment to the ICC.\r\nWe were deeply involved in the process of the Court’s\r\ncreation, through its historic establishment as the\r\ninternational bastion safeguarding the victims of\r\ncrimes that shock the conscience of mankind. But we\r\n6\r\nA/60/PV.46\r\nshould not become complacent. We must continue to\r\nbe resolute and vigilant in safeguarding the ideals of\r\nthe Court so that it can become what it was meant by\r\nits creators to be: the upholder of international criminal\r\nlaw and an institution capable of bringing an end to\r\nimpunity for perpetrators of the most heinous crimes.\r\nMr. Wali (Nigeria): I have the honour to speak\r\non behalf of the African States parties to the Rome\r\nStatute of the International Criminal Court (ICC):\r\nBenin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, the Central\r\nAfrican Republic, the Congo, the Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo, Djibouti, Gabon, the Gambia, Ghana,\r\nGuinea, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Malawi, Mali,\r\nMauritius, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra\r\nLeone, South Africa, Uganda, the United Republic of\r\nTanzania and Zambia. We congratulate the President of\r\nthe International Criminal Court, Judge Philippe\r\nKirsch, for his elaborate report (A/60/177) on the\r\nactivities of the Court.\r\nThe ICC has made enormous strides in the period\r\nunder review. Given the background to the Rome\r\nStatute, it is indeed remarkable that the number of\r\nStates parties has risen to 100 within such a short period\r\nof time. We welcome the newest States parties —\r\nMexico, the Dominican Republic and Kenya — to the\r\nICC. We urge other United Nations Member States that\r\nhave not yet done so to become States parties.\r\nIt is gratifying to note that the Court has recorded\r\ntremendous success in the area of its primary mandate,\r\nthe judicial phase. The report indicates that work in\r\nthat area has begun in earnest. We note that the three\r\nPre-Trial Chambers have been established. It is\r\nencouraging that investigations have so far led to the\r\nissuance of five warrants of arrest.\r\nIt is evident that the remarkable accomplishments\r\nof the Court in so short a period would not have been\r\npossible without the exceptional leadership qualities of\r\nJudge Kirsch and we commend him for that. We also\r\ncommend the Prosecutor, Mr. Luis Moreno-Ocampo,\r\nand his team of investigators for their collaborative\r\nefforts. We acknowledge the role of some international\r\nand regional organizations, including the United\r\nNations and the African Union. We commend Uganda\r\nand the Democratic Republic of the Congo for their\r\ncooperation with the Court. We appreciate Austria\r\nhaving become the first country to conclude an\r\nagreement with the Court to enforce its judgements.\r\nWe recognize that the Court does not have its\r\nown police force to execute its orders. The cooperation\r\nof States parties and of international and regional\r\norganizations such as the United Nations and the\r\nAfrican Union is therefore crucial to ensure the timely\r\nexecution of the Court’s orders. It is for that reason that\r\nwe welcome the conclusion of the negotiations\r\nbetween the African Union and the ICC on a Court-\r\nwide cooperation agreement. Accordingly, we urge the\r\nrelevant parties to sign the agreement as a matter of\r\nurgency. We believe that it will facilitate cooperation\r\nbetween the Court and the African Union.\r\nIt is our view that the growth of the Court should\r\nbe accompanied by a strategic vision and positioning\r\nfor future relevance and benefits for itself and States\r\nparties. We are convinced that the benefits for, and the\r\nobligations of, all stakeholders should be clearly\r\nspelled out. It is therefore gratifying to note that the\r\nCourt has made it a priority to establish a strategic\r\nplanning process to define its strategic goals on the\r\nbasis of a five-year cycle. In that regard, we wish to\r\nmake some preliminary suggestions concerning the\r\nway forward.\r\nFirst, we consider it advisable that the Court\r\nadopt a strategy that is based on resources rather than\r\non demand. Consequently, the Court may wish not to\r\noverstretch its work schedule in the field at any given\r\ntime. Its complement of staff and its projected growth\r\nshould be commensurate with its capacity.\r\nSecondly, the Court’s strategy should ensure that\r\njustice is actually done. For that purpose, we believe,\r\ntrials should — to the extent that local circumstances\r\npermit it — be carried out in the localities where\r\ncrimes have taken place. In that regard, we welcome\r\nthe fact that the Court already has two field offices in\r\naffected countries. We hope that those offices will also\r\nexplore the possibility of holding hearings in the\r\naffected regions.\r\nThirdly, it is necessary that the issue of the\r\nCourt’s permanent premises be linked to its strategic\r\nplanning process.\r\nFinally, the strategic planning process should\r\naddress the need for the ICC to leave a legacy of\r\nlasting jurisprudence for the enforcement of\r\ninternational justice, particularly in the affected\r\ncountries. We note that Africa is currently the sole\r\ntheatre for the Court’s operations. It is our hope that\r\nthe justice rendered by the ICC will usher in stability\r\n7\r\nA/60/PV.46\r\nand sustainable peace and that it will permanently\r\naddress the menace of impunity on the continent. That,\r\nin our view, would enhance the much-needed economic\r\ndevelopment in the affected countries.\r\nWith regard to organizational issues, our first\r\npreliminary comment is that the site for future\r\nmeetings of States parties should alternate between\r\nNew York and The Hague. That, in our view, would\r\nensure the widest possible participation and attract\r\nmore observers, especially at this early stage of the\r\nCourt’s operations. Furthermore, we welcome the fact\r\nthat the Committee on Budget and Finance has largely\r\naccepted the option paper of the Bureau of the\r\nAssembly of States Parties on the establishment of a\r\nliaison office in New York. We also call for the\r\nestablishment of an appropriate negotiating mechanism\r\nto finalize the negotiations on the regulations for the\r\ntrust fund for victims. Finally, we call for adequate\r\nmeasures to ensure that the staffing of the Court is\r\ngeographically representative of the membership of the\r\nAssembly of States Parties.\r\nIn closing, the African States parties to the Rome\r\nStatute reaffirm their confidence in the Court. We are\r\ncertain that the committed execution of the Court’s\r\nmandate remains a main pillar for the promotion and\r\nsustenance of the rule of law, good governance,\r\ndemocracy, human rights and, above all, the fight\r\nagainst impunity. We therefore reaffirm our\r\nunwavering support for the Court.\r\nMr. Malpede (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nThe Government of the Argentine Republic wishes to\r\nthank the President of the International Criminal Court,\r\nJudge Philippe Kirsch, for his statement, as well for his\r\nsubstantial and successful efforts during this key stage\r\nof consolidating the Court. We also wish to extend our\r\nrecognition to the work of the Prosecutor, Mr. Luis\r\nMoreno-Ocampo, in this complex and challenging task.\r\nHis efforts, under great pressure, have effectively\r\nhelped advance the cause of justice and the objectives\r\nof the Rome Statute. We appreciate the progress made\r\nin the work of the International Criminal Court during\r\nthe past year, in matters connected both to its\r\norganization and administration, as well as to the full\r\nand active exercise of its competences.\r\nAs Latin Americans, we welcome the election of\r\nAmbassador Bruno Stagno Ugarte, Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Costa Rica to the United Nations, as\r\nPresident of the Assembly of States Parties for the\r\nperiod from 2005 to 2007.\r\nWe also welcome the decision of the Government\r\nof Mexico to ratify the Rome Statute. Mexico’s\r\nratification of the Rome Statute represents a historic\r\nmoment for the Court, as it brings the number of States\r\nparties to 100, and this reaffirms and strengthens the\r\ncommitment of the international community to fight\r\nimpunity.\r\nArgentina has always underlined that the\r\nInternational Criminal Court is the most appropriate\r\nforum in which to combat impunity and to bring to\r\njustice those who have committed the most serious\r\ncrimes against the international community as a whole.\r\nWe wish to stress the historic importance of Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1593 (2005) concerning the\r\nsituation in Darfur. It is the first time that the Council\r\nhas made use of article 13 of the Rome Statute and has\r\nreferred to the Prosecutor a situation where it appears\r\nthat the crime committed is under the jurisdiction of\r\nthe Court. It is a fundamental prerequisite that we put\r\nan end to impunity, in the framework of the rule of law\r\nand with the legitimacy that the independence and\r\nimpartiality of the Court provides.\r\nAs we have expressed in the Security Council,\r\nArgentina opposes any agreement that, in general\r\nterms, would exclude the nationals of a State from the\r\njurisdiction of the Court. This would affect the basis of\r\nthe jurisdiction of the Court, and it would run counter\r\nto the objectives and purposes of the Rome Statute.\r\nThe letter and spirit of the Rome Statute must be\r\nrespected, and the balance between its provisions and\r\nthe legitimate concerns of States must be preserved.\r\nWe are also satisfied with the development of the\r\ninvestigation processes in the cases of the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, Uganda and Darfur. Moreover,\r\nArgentina wishes to highlight the importance, for the\r\nconsolidation of the Court as an international legal\r\ninstitution, of the recent warrants of arrest for leaders\r\nof the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) for crimes\r\nagainst humanity and war crimes committed in\r\nUganda. These warrants of arrest constitute a milestone\r\nin one of the inquiries of the Prosecutor and are the\r\nfirst arrests in the history of the Court. We call upon all\r\ncountries, States parties to the Rome Statute and the\r\ninternational community to coordinate efforts in order\r\nto ensure the arrest of the suspects.\r\n8\r\nA/60/PV.46\r\nWe want to commend the work of the Board of\r\nDirectors of the Trust Fund for Victims. We also\r\nwelcome the recent contributions made to this Fund.\r\nIn this connection, we wish to reiterate the\r\nimportance that we attach to the labour of the Special\r\nWorking Group on the Crime of Aggression, open on\r\nequal conditions to all States, as well as to the\r\npossibility of holding their meetings be held at the\r\nUnited Nations Headquarters, as indicated by\r\nresolution 58/79.\r\nWe believe that the establishment of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court notably enriches the legal\r\nstructure of the international community and the rule of\r\nlaw at a global level and will complement the efforts of\r\nnational jurisdictions in order to confront crimes\r\nagainst humanity.\r\nMr. Maurer (Switzerland) (spoke in French):\r\nSwitzerland welcomes President Philippe Kirsch to the\r\nGeneral Assembly and also welcomes the first report of\r\nthe International Criminal Court submitted by\r\nPresident Kirsch, which has been presented to the\r\nAssembly in compliance with the Relationship\r\nAgreement between the United Nations and the\r\nInternational Criminal Court adopted last year. The\r\nreport shows the importance and the impressive scale\r\nof the Court’s activities a mere three years after the\r\nRome Statue came into effect. The fact that three States\r\nparties have referred their situations to the\r\nInternational Criminal Court and that a non-party State\r\nhas recognized its competence in accordance with\r\nArticle 12, paragraph 3, demonstrates very clearly that\r\nthis institution meets a real need facing the\r\ninternational community.\r\nThe referral of the situation in Darfur to the\r\nInternational Criminal Court by the Security Council\r\nlast March proves that the Court has become, in a very\r\nbrief time, an indispensable pillar in the architecture of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nAll the situations currently being dealt with by\r\nthe Court are extremely serious and characterized by\r\nbrutality which, at times, can only be described as\r\nmonstrous. Switzerland welcomes the strategy of the\r\nProsecutor, which aims, in its first phase, to identify\r\nthose people at the highest levels responsible for the\r\nworst crimes. Switzerland is aware of the very difficult\r\nconditions on the ground under which the Court has to\r\nwork, in particular at the human, security and logistical\r\nlevels. It encourages all States to cooperate fully with\r\nthe Court and to help it as much as possible to carry\r\nout its mandate.\r\nConcerning the relationship between the United\r\nNations and the International Criminal Court, it seems\r\nto be of paramount importance that the Agreement,\r\nwhich came into effect last year, be fully implemented\r\nin the mutual interests of both institutions. Switzerland\r\nwelcomes, in particular, the approach that the Court\r\nadopts in its relations with States, based on cooperation\r\nand positive complementarity. My country is\r\nencouraged by the way in which the Court associates\r\nall of its partners — States, international organizations\r\nand non-governmental organizations — in its courses\r\nof action. The experience gained in the area of\r\ntransitional justice reveals the increased need to\r\ncoordinate all activities developed in conflict or post-\r\nconflict situations.\r\nIn the execution of its mandate, the International\r\nCriminal Court has proven to be sensitive to the\r\npolitical context in which it operates. It is, however,\r\nclear that coordination efforts are limited by the degree\r\nof respect accorded to the Court’s independence, the\r\nCourt’s independence being the basis of its legitimacy.\r\nFrom Switzerland’s perspective, in this initial phase,\r\nthe Court, and in particular the Prosecutor, have\r\npursued a just line of action that is beyond reproach.\r\nThrough its commitment to transparency, honesty\r\nand professionalism, the Court has earned wide respect\r\nand enjoys increasingly strong support within the\r\ninternational community. In a short period of time, it\r\nhas become a true cornerstone of the fight against\r\nimpunity at the international level. Today, more than\r\nhalf of all the States of the world have become parties\r\nto the treaty. I would like to commend Mexico, which\r\njust ratified the Rome Statue a few days ago, making it\r\nthe hundredth country to become a party to the statute.\r\nSwitzerland calls on all States that have not yet done so\r\nto join the Rome Statute as soon as possible.\r\nMr. Butagira (Uganda): From the outset, Uganda\r\naligns itself with the statement of the African Group\r\ndelivered by the representative of Nigeria.\r\nOne cannot help but recoil in horror at the\r\nconjectured picture of thousands of children ruthlessly\r\nkidnapped from their homes, their parents, and their\r\ncommunities and subjected to witnessing gruesome\r\nkillings, many even forced to take part in those horrific\r\nkillings, some raped, others mutilated, and all having\r\ntheir innocence and sense of security irrevocably\r\n9\r\nA/60/PV.46\r\nshattered at a tender age. One cannot also help but\r\nweep for the parents, relatives and communities who\r\nwere helpless to protect them — parents, relatives and\r\ntribesmen who may also have, in the process, had parts\r\nof their bodies butchered or mutilated in the worst\r\npossible way imaginable, many of the raped suffering\r\nnot only from stigma and isolation, but also forced to\r\nbirth and nurse the children of their tormentors, the\r\nmajority infected by HIV/AIDS.\r\nIt is with regard to the plight of victims, such as\r\nthose I have described, at the hands of the so-called\r\nLord’s Resistance Army (LRA) in northern Uganda\r\nand all the other victims elsewhere of similar abuses\r\noccasioned by crimes against humanity, war crimes and\r\ngenocide since the entry into force of the Rome\r\nStatute, that this Assembly is gathered here today to\r\ntake stock of what the international community and the\r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) have done and are\r\nlikely to do to redress some of those despicable\r\ninhuman acts. The damage inflicted may never be truly\r\nrepaired, but with the intervention of the Court and\r\nrelevant organs, such as the Trust Fund for Victims, it\r\nmay at least be mitigated. That is our hope.\r\nI now turn to the report of the ICC circulated by\r\nthe Secretary-General in accordance with the\r\nRelationship Agreement between the United Nations\r\nand the International Criminal Court. My delegation\r\nappreciates the depth with which the activities of the\r\nCourt are dealt with therein.\r\nAllow me also to thank the President of the ICC,\r\nJudge Philippe Kirsch, for his succinct and detailed\r\nintroduction of the report and for the excellent manner\r\nin which he has been handling the affairs of the Court.\r\nHowever, before I delve into the details of the\r\nsaid report, on behalf of all the victims of the Lord’s\r\nResistance Army and the peoples of Uganda, I wish to\r\ncongratulate the Court upon the issuance of warrants of\r\narrest to five members of the top leadership of the LRA\r\nafter the conclusion of the investigations carried out by\r\nthe office of the Prosecutor. We appreciate the fact that\r\nthe wheels of justice sometimes turn slowly, but in this\r\ncase so many factors had to be taken into\r\nconsideration. It is of the utmost importance to the\r\npeople of northern Uganda, as well as to the healing of\r\nthe whole nation, that the leadership of the LRA be\r\ntried by the ICC. We call upon our neighbours to do\r\neverything in their power to help apprehend the\r\nindictees and we thank the Governments of the Sudan\r\nand the Democratic Republic of the Congo for their\r\nefforts to date.\r\nWe beg to differ with those opposing the arrest\r\nwarrants on the premise that they will hamper peace\r\nprospects in northern Uganda. Both Mrs. Betty\r\nBigombe’s and the Government of Uganda’s overtures\r\nto the LRA leadership have been snubbed in the past\r\nand all indicators have proved that the leaders of the\r\nLRA have no interest in giving up their heinous war\r\nand grave crimes against humanity. We urge the\r\nAssembly to consider the situation were Kony and his\r\nhenchmen to be allowed to continue committing\r\natrocities unchallenged. So far, tens of thousands of\r\nUgandan children have been abducted to serve as\r\nsoldiers, porters and sex slaves. Many have been forced\r\nto kill their fellow children in cold blood. Almost l\r\nmillion Ugandans have been displaced and forced to\r\nlive in camps for internally displaced persons. Even\r\nthere, they are not spared the vicious attacks of that\r\nbarbaric group, and members may recall the horrific\r\nmassacre at a place called the Barlonyo Camp for\r\ninternally displaced persons, where 250 people were\r\nmercilessly hacked to death and their huts and property\r\nburnt. Some victims were even cooked and eaten.\r\nThere can be no lasting prospects for sustainable\r\npeace without justice. The indictment of those\r\ncriminals will serve as a stark deterrent to would-be\r\nperpetrators of such crimes when they see that the\r\nCourt means business. It will also strengthen the Court.\r\nDefinitely, the three referrals before it are evidence of\r\nthe international community’s growing confidence in\r\nthe Court. The confidence is further testified to by Côte\r\nd’Ivoire’s lodging of a declaration accepting the\r\njurisdiction of the Court even though it is not a State\r\nparty to the Rome Statute.\r\nIn that vein, we wish to salute the Member States\r\nparties that have contributed to the 100 ratifications of\r\nthe Rome Statute. The 100th ratification submitted by\r\nMexico is indeed a milestone towards achieving the\r\nuniversality of the Court. We are equally pleased by the\r\nannouncement that Austria has signed an Agreement\r\nwith the ICC on the enforcement of the sentences to be\r\nhanded down by the Court. We urge other States parties\r\nin a position to do so to offer similar support. That will\r\nserve to render the Court even more, if not fully,\r\noperational.\r\nWhile we appreciate the Court’s quest to recruit\r\nhighly qualified staff, we urge it to ensure fair\r\n10\r\nA/60/PV.46\r\ngeographical distribution of top and mid-level\r\nmanagerial positions to highly qualified persons. We\r\nare extremely concerned to note that, of the\r\nprofessional staff, an overwhelming 70 per cent come\r\nfrom Western countries, with only 12 per cent from\r\nAfrica and a paltry 3 per cent from Asia. It is not\r\nenough for the Court to request Member States to assist\r\nit in identifying qualified candidates from the\r\nunderrepresented States. The Assembly of States\r\nParties must formulate more equitable criteria for the\r\nhiring of professional staff, as the present criteria,\r\nwhich are based on the United Nations model, leave a\r\nlot to be desired.\r\nWe commend the Court for the procedures it has\r\nset in motion to ensure its viability and sound\r\nmanagement, such as the elaboration of a five-year\r\nstrategic plan, the adoption of a charter for internal\r\naudit, and the setting up of the Coordination Council.\r\nWith specific regard to the Registry, we commend the\r\nlatter for developing a legal aid scheme to ensure\r\nsufficient means for the defence and due respect of the\r\nrights of the accused, finalizing the revised draft code\r\nof professional conduct for counsel and undertaking\r\ntraining programmes for relevant bodies in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda.\r\nWe applaud the efforts of the Court to\r\ncontinuously consult with civil society and other\r\nexperts on issues related to the participation of victims\r\nin the proceedings before the Court. That will help\r\nthem operationalize the provisions of the Rome Statute\r\nand the relevant rules of procedure and evidence.\r\nFurther, we note with appreciation the Court’s\r\nendeavours to reach out to heads of State and\r\nGovernment, Government officials, parliamentarians\r\nand representatives of international and regional\r\norganizations. That will indeed help enhance\r\nacceptance and understanding of the Court. The\r\nCourt’s practice of involving stakeholders and\r\nconsulting with various leading experts, States parties,\r\nthe United Nations and non-governmental\r\norganizations will deepen its understanding of critical\r\nissues and help build efficiency and relevance.\r\nWe thank the Prosecutor for briefing the Security\r\nCouncil on the Office of the Prosecutor’s activities in\r\nDarfur and all for similar cooperation whenever\r\ndeemed appropriate. We stress the importance of\r\ncontinued effective cooperation between the Security\r\nCouncil and the Court.\r\nWe commend the Court for establishing a field\r\noffice in Uganda, together with a field office and a\r\nfield presence in the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo. Once trial proceedings begin, it may be in the\r\ninterests of the Court and natural justice to hold such\r\nproceedings in the vicinity where the crimes were\r\ncommitted.\r\nOn its part, Uganda is doing its best to cooperate\r\nwith the Court, as has been acknowledged in the report.\r\nThe Government has embarked on several joint\r\nactivities with civil society to sensitize the public on\r\nthe work of the ICC, especially in regard to the\r\nproceedings against the Lord’s Resistance Army.\r\nFurther, it has elaborated a national bill on the ICC to\r\nimplement the Rome Statute, which has been presented\r\nto Parliament.\r\nWhen the Trust Fund for Victims was established,\r\nUgandan victims rejoiced. We, too, rejoiced, especially\r\nwhen we witnessed some countries’ generous\r\ncontributions to the Fund. However, we have noted\r\nwith dismay the trend the negotiations to elaborate\r\ncriteria to disburse the funds are taking. Whereas we\r\nunderstand the concerns of some leading common-law\r\ncountries regarding monies being made available to\r\nvictims before the conviction of alleged perpetrators,\r\nwe nonetheless appeal to them to recognize some\r\nvictims’ immediate collective needs. That is all the\r\nmore poignant given that some damage, such as\r\npsychological trauma, if not addressed immediately\r\ncan become irreparable, not to mention the dark\r\ndespair of disillusionment.\r\nOn a final note, the Ugandan Government wishes\r\nto reiterate its support for the Court and urges the\r\nUnited Nations and the Security Council in particular\r\nto cooperate closely with it so that, together, they can\r\npromote adherence to and protection of the rule of law\r\nin order to deal a death blow to impunity regarding the\r\nmost serious and nefarious crimes in the history of\r\nmankind.\r\nMr. Morote (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): I wish to\r\nthank Mr. Philippe Kirsch, President of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court, for his comprehensive\r\nand detailed presentation of his report on the Court’s\r\nwork. We welcome the fact that the President of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court has addressed the\r\nAssembly for the first time.\r\nPeru reiterates its support for and commitment to\r\nensuring that the International Criminal Court can\r\n11\r\nA/60/PV.46\r\neffectively fulfil its mandate and to promoting the\r\nintegrity of its statute. The creation of the International\r\nCriminal Court with the adoption of the Rome Statute\r\nand its subsequent entry into force on 1 July 2002\r\nundoubtedly represented a historic moment in which\r\nthe international community decided that it would not\r\ntolerate impunity for the most serious crimes:\r\ngenocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.\r\nThe Court was conceived not only as a solid and\r\neffective instrument for ensuring that the perpetrators\r\nof such crimes should enjoy no impunity; its very\r\nexistence was intended to deter future perpetrators of\r\nsuch atrocities. In carrying out the sensitive tasks that\r\nhave been entrusted to it by its States parties, the Court\r\nshall fulfil its mission and thus help to achieve the\r\ngoals of the United Nations, in particular respect for\r\nhuman rights and the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security.\r\nWe can be proud that we have a Court that is\r\nfully operational. It is currently undertaking\r\ninvestigations into cases in the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo, Uganda and the Sudan, and has unsealed its\r\nfirst arrest warrants, which marks a milestone in the\r\nfight against impunity.\r\nIn the case of Darfur, the Sudan, we welcome the\r\nSecurity Council’s decision, through resolution 1593\r\n(2005), to refer the report of the International\r\nCommission of Inquiry on Darfur to the International\r\nCriminal Court. Having considered other options, Peru\r\nbelieves that, given current circumstances, the decision\r\nto refer the matter to the Court was correct and hopes\r\nthat the Council will pursue that sound practice in\r\nsituations where it is deemed necessary.\r\nWe know that the investigations carried out by\r\nthe International Criminal Court often run up against\r\nsecurity problems on the ground. In that respect,\r\ncooperation between the Court and the United Nations\r\nis critical. The Relationship Agreement signed in 2004\r\nbetween those two organizations is the framework\r\ninstrument in that regard. Moreover, as stated in its\r\nreport, the Court does not have its own police force to\r\nimplement its decisions and warrants. That is why\r\ncooperation between States is necessary and important\r\nin such areas as the gathering of evidence, the arrest\r\nand surrender of individuals, and the enforcement of\r\nsentences. In that regard, we welcome the recent\r\nsigning by the Government of Austria of an Agreement\r\non the Enforcement of Sentences.\r\nThe Rome Statute recalls the role to be played by\r\nvictims in the processes of the International Criminal\r\nCourt. The voluntary Trust Fund for Victims was\r\nestablished to that end. Peru stresses the importance of\r\nthe work of the Fund’s Board of Directors and appeals\r\nto those States that are in a position to do so to\r\ncontribute to the Fund. Peru also wishes to emphasize\r\nthe work of the Special Working Group on the Crime\r\nof Aggression, a body open in full equality to all\r\nMember States. We hope that that issue will continue\r\nto be considered pursuant to the Rome Statute.\r\nThe International Criminal Court is a crucial\r\ninstitution In the struggle against impunity. We must\r\nnot forget, however, that it complements the efforts of\r\nnational jurisdictions, which are responsible for\r\nresponding to criminal acts that have been identified as\r\nfalling within the Court’s competence. In that respect,\r\nwe call on States to bring to justice the perpetrators of\r\ncrimes that fall within the Court’s jurisdiction and to\r\nprovide expeditious legal assistance in such situations.\r\nBefore concluding, allow me to welcome\r\nMexico’s recent ratification of the Rome Statute,\r\nbecoming the twentieth State of Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean to accede to the International Criminal\r\nCourt and bringing the number of States parties to that\r\ninternational instrument to 100. We trust that more\r\ncountries will join the large group of States parties to\r\nthe International Criminal Court in the future.\r\nMr. Ozawa (Japan): At the outset, my delegation\r\nwould like to thank President Philippe Kirsch for his\r\nin-depth report on the current work of the International\r\nCriminal Court (ICC).\r\nJapan congratulates the ICC on entering into its\r\noperational phase. In 2005, the ICC initiated an\r\ninvestigation into the situation in Darfur, the Sudan, in\r\naddition to the investigations into the situations in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and northern\r\nUganda. When the Security Council voted on referring\r\nthe situation in Darfur to the Prosecutor of the ICC,\r\nJapan, as a member of the Security Council, voted in\r\nfavour of the resolution. That resolution, we believe,\r\nwas a significant step towards putting an end to\r\nimpunity for one of the most serious crimes in the\r\ninternational community today.\r\nIn order for the ICC to win the trust of the wider\r\ninternational community, it is essential for the Court to\r\ndemonstrate its fairness, impartiality and efficiency.\r\nThe activities of the ICC are increasingly drawing the\r\n12\r\nA/60/PV.46\r\nattention of the world at large, especially since some\r\nare now shifting from the investigatory to the judicial\r\nphase. In that regard, the ICC is facing a crucial\r\nmoment in its efforts to increase support for its\r\nactivities within the international community.\r\nAlthough Japan has yet to accede to the Rome\r\nStatute, it has actively participated as an observer in all\r\nthe ICC-related meetings. Currently, we are taking part\r\nin such activities as the discussion on drafting the\r\nregulations for the Trust Fund for Victims and the task\r\nforce for the draft code of professional conduct for\r\ncounsel. Those are important activities which will\r\ncontribute to the further development of the ICC.\r\nAs mentioned on a number of occasions, Japan is\r\nseriously considering accession to the Rome Statute.\r\nWe are assessing all possible implications for our\r\ndomestic criminal code system. We are also evaluating\r\nwhat the financial implications of accession would be\r\nagainst the background of Japan’s serious fiscal\r\ndeficits. We are aware of the growing need for\r\nbudgetary expansion as the ICC begins full-scale\r\noperations. It is also true, however, that financial\r\ndiscipline must be maintained in order for the Court to\r\nenjoy the support of the wider international\r\ncommunity.\r\nJapan welcomes the fact that the number of States\r\nparties to the Rome Statute has reached 100. Japan, as\r\na State which is considering becoming a party to the\r\nStatute, would like to emphasize the importance of the\r\ntransparency and effectiveness of the work of the ICC.\r\nWe hope that the Court will become a truly universal\r\norganization that commands the trust of the\r\ninternational community as a whole.\r\nMrs. Kasyanju (United Republic of Tanzania):\r\nThe United Republic of Tanzania associates itself with\r\nthe statement made by the representative of the Federal\r\nRepublic of Nigeria on behalf of the African States\r\nparties to the Rome Statute.\r\nMy delegation would like to thank Judge Philippe\r\nKirsch, President of the International Criminal Court\r\n(ICC), for the report in document A/60/177. The report\r\nhas been submitted in accordance with provisions of\r\nthe Relationship Agreement between the United\r\nNations and the International Criminal Court. We\r\nbelieve that the Agreement reinforces and\r\ninstitutionalizes the relationship between the United\r\nNations and the ICC, ensuring that, on both a\r\nphilosophical and a practical level, those two important\r\nelements of international justice can work together.\r\nWe applaud the General Assembly’s decision to\r\nconsider directly in plenary reports submitted by the\r\nCourt under its Relationship Agreement with the\r\nUnited Nations in a manner similar to the plenary’s\r\nconsideration of reports of the International Court of\r\nJustice and the United Nations Ad Hoc Tribunals for\r\nRwanda and the former Yugoslavia. My delegation\r\nlooks forward to good cooperation between the two\r\nbodies after the ICC is granted observer status in the\r\nGeneral Assembly. We will closely follow the progress\r\nof the Court through its annual reports to the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nGoing through the ICC report, one cannot fail to\r\nappreciate that the main pillars of the Court — the\r\nPresidency, the Judiciary, the Office of the Prosecutor\r\nand the Registry — have all been set up and are in the\r\nprocess of being firmly established on the ground.\r\nSome, like the Office of the Prosecutor, have already\r\nstarted preliminary as well as substantive operations.\r\nWe commend all who have been involved in that\r\ngroundwork.\r\nWhat is most significant is the fact that the ICC\r\nhas entered the judicial phase of its operations. The\r\nProsecutor has launched investigations in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and in the Republic\r\nof Uganda upon referrals by the two Member States.\r\nFurthermore, in a historical event in June this year, the\r\nSecurity Council referred the Darfur situation to the\r\nICC. The Prosecutor therefore is also investigating the\r\nsituation in Darfur. It is significant that arrests and\r\nindictments might be forthcoming in the near future.\r\nThat is where the issue of cooperation of States\r\nparties and the international community becomes\r\ncrucial. It will be the duty of States parties and the\r\ninternational community to execute the arrest warrants\r\nissued by the ICC. The cooperation is not limited to\r\narrests, but cuts across all spheres of activity of the\r\nICC, including in strengthening the capacity of\r\nMember States in building local networks, the field of\r\nsecurity, the establishment of logistics, information\r\ndissemination, and other areas and matters. We\r\ntherefore applaud the Court’s initiative in developing\r\nthe so-called case matrix, which, among other services,\r\nprovides on-line commentaries on how to define and\r\nprove the offences under the Rome Statute. We look\r\nforward to accessing those digital tools, which we\r\n13\r\nA/60/PV.46\r\nbelieve will support our domestic efforts to promote\r\nthe rule of law.\r\nThere is no doubt that the success of the ICC’s\r\nactivities will largely depend on the extent of\r\ncooperation it gets from Member States, the\r\ninternational community and other entities, including\r\ninternational and regional organizations. We appeal to\r\nall United Nations Member States to grant the much-\r\nneeded cooperation to the ICC. In the same respect, we\r\ncongratulate Mexico on becoming the 100th party to\r\nthe Rome Statute, and we urge more countries to ratify\r\nand accede to the Statute, taking a further step towards\r\nthe universalization of the Court.\r\nThe United Republic of Tanzania would like to\r\nreaffirm its commitment to and support for the\r\nInternational Criminal Court, which has been\r\nestablished to fight impunity by trying individuals\r\naccused of the most serious violations of international\r\nhumanitarian and human rights law. The ICC is meant\r\nto ensure that the perpetrators of such crimes as\r\ngenocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity will\r\nbe tried either in their national jurisdictions or through\r\nthe ICC. We believe that the ICC is the most\r\nsignificant international mechanism ever created to\r\nimplement international standards of justice.\r\nLastly, my delegation strongly supports the\r\nGeneral Assembly draft resolution on the International\r\nCriminal Court.\r\nMr. Shin (Republic of Korea): I would like to\r\nbegin by thanking the President of the International\r\nCriminal Court (ICC), Judge Philippe Kirsch, for his\r\npresentation of the report of the Court to the plenary of\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nOn 28 October, Mexico became the 100th State\r\nparty to the ICC, marking an important milestone on\r\nthe road towards universal ratification of the Rome\r\nStatute. The Republic of Korea strongly supports that\r\ngoal. It is our belief that there must be a seamless web\r\nof justice throughout the world.\r\nCurrently, however, there are only 12 Asian\r\nStates parties to the Rome Statute. My delegation is\r\neager to see more Asian States become parties to the\r\nStatute as soon as possible. Asian States should also\r\nbecome partners for international criminal justice,\r\nwhich would serve the interests of peace and security\r\nin the region. We hope that the Court, as well as the\r\nStates parties, will provide assistance to Asian States to\r\nenable them to prepare for accession to the Rome\r\nStatute. The Republic of Korea will do its part by\r\nengaging in outreach and advocacy efforts to\r\nencourage more Asian States to join the International\r\nCriminal Court.\r\nMy delegation is pleased to note that the Court is\r\nnow a fully functional judicial institution. The\r\nProsecutor of the Court is currently investigating\r\nsituations in Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo and Darfur, the Sudan. In addition, analysis of\r\neight situations on four continents is under way,\r\nincluding those in the Central African Republic and\r\nCôte d’Ivoire. Operational presences are being\r\nestablished. Pre-Trial Chamber II has recently unsealed\r\nthe arrest warrants for five senior leaders of the Lord’s\r\nResistance Army in Uganda on counts of crimes\r\nagainst humanity and war crimes. Trials are expected\r\nto begin in 2006.\r\nSuch progress will not only bring to justice\r\nperpetrators of heinous crimes but also serve as a\r\ndeterrent to future atrocities. The Court’s success will\r\nsend a strong message throughout the international\r\ncommunity that there will be no impunity for those\r\nwho commit crimes against humanity, genocide or war\r\ncrimes.\r\nHow the Court handles the cases referred to it\r\nwill be an important determiner of the Court’s future\r\nand of whether it will be embraced by the entire\r\nmembership of the United Nations. To ensure the\r\nCourt’s best possible performance, States should\r\nprovide it with the financial, logistical and political\r\nsupport it needs to perform its work, thus enabling the\r\nCourt to realize the rule of law and to end impunity for\r\ncrimes against humanity, genocide and war crimes.\r\nStates Parties must ensure that assessed contributions\r\nare paid in full and on time. We also encourage\r\nvoluntary contributions as an important source of\r\nresources.\r\nIn terms of the Court’s functioning, it is\r\nimportant to note that the Court does not have its own\r\nenforcement arm. The Court needs the assistance and\r\ncooperation of States to apprehend indictees, collect\r\nevidence and execute its sentences. Thus, it is critically\r\nimportant that the Court receives the full cooperation\r\nof States, relevant regional organizations and United\r\nNations operations.\r\nThe Relationship Agreement between the United\r\nNations and the Court provides many avenues for\r\n14\r\nA/60/PV.46\r\nmutually beneficial cooperative efforts to establish the\r\nrule of law and end impunity. Particularly important\r\nareas of cooperation in the field are communications,\r\ntransportation, logistics and security, including the\r\nprotection of victims, witnesses and investigators, as\r\nwell as the provision of access to suspects and the\r\ncollection of evidence and documents.\r\nEach of those areas requires the cooperation and\r\nthe support of the United Nations. Information-sharing\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Court is essential\r\nboth at Headquarters and in the field. To facilitate\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nInternational Criminal Court, my delegation strongly\r\nsupports the establishment of a Court liaison office at\r\nthe United Nations and the allocation of adequate\r\nresources for its effective functioning.\r\nWe also urge the continued participation of States\r\nin the Special Working Group on the Crime of\r\nAggression. It is important that States actively\r\nparticipate in that important discussion on the\r\ndefinition of the crime of aggression, including the\r\nconditions under which the Court would exercise its\r\njurisdiction. My delegation looks forward to further\r\nprogress on that issue in coming years.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the increasing trust of\r\nthe international community in the independence,\r\nfairness, impartiality and effectiveness of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court. That trust was\r\ndemonstrated by the referral of the situations in\r\nUganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the\r\nCentral African Republic to the Court by the States\r\nthemselves. The first referral to the Court by the\r\nSecurity Council, namely, the situation in Darfur, the\r\nSudan, is strong testimony to the fact that peace and\r\njustice, often misunderstood as being mutually\r\nexclusive, can work hand-in-hand.\r\nWith those positive developments in mind, the\r\nRepublic of Korea reaffirms its unswerving\r\ncommitment to support the International Criminal\r\nCourt in achieving its noble goals.\r\nMr. Gómez Robledo (Mexico) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): After five years of intense and prolonged\r\ndeliberations, on 28 October, Mexico deposited its\r\ninstrument of ratification of the Rome Statute. It was\r\nnot easy for Mexico to become a State party. It\r\nrequired a complex process of constitutional reform,\r\nwhich in turn entailed a very broad debate within our\r\nsociety. That debate was probably not unlike those that\r\nhave taken place in other countries that have had to\r\ntake a position with respect to the International\r\nCriminal Court.\r\nIn effect, a highly conservative vision of\r\nsovereignty and the principle of non-intervention have\r\nalways provided a powerful arm for those who oppose\r\nthe Court. That vision cannot admit that the concept of\r\nthe threat to international peace and security has been\r\nexpanded to make of human rights legal rights to be\r\nmonitored by the international community as a whole.\r\nThat debate, however, had a distinctive feature in\r\nMexico. While the Rome Statute was perceived as a\r\npowerful instrument for achieving progress in\r\nstrengthening the institutions for the protection of\r\nhuman rights, it aroused all types of fears owing to its\r\nsupranational nature and to the competences the Rome\r\nStatute grants to the Security Council. The principle of\r\ncomplementarity on which the jurisdiction of the Court\r\nis based was something that could not be understood.\r\nThe situation demonstrated that becoming a party to\r\nthe Statute entailed, essentially, improving national\r\njustice systems. In short, we understand the\r\nInternational Criminal Court to be a deterrent to the\r\ncommission of the most grave crimes, but it is also a\r\nmotor for promoting the rule of law within our\r\ncountries.\r\nThe democratic transition undergone by Mexico\r\nin recent years was decisive for reaching the objective\r\nset by President Vicente Fox on the first day of his\r\nterm. The executive, legislative and judicial branches\r\nof government, universities, non-governmental\r\norganizations and civil society as a whole participated\r\nin the debates held to set the stage, first, for\r\nconstitutional reform and, secondly, for ratification of\r\nthe Statute.\r\nNone of that would have been possible without\r\nthe constant support of the countries that have become\r\nfriends of the Court; they constantly gave us\r\nencouragement through their experience and advice. I\r\nwant particularly to underline the role played by the\r\nEuropean Union and the Council of Europe, as well as\r\nby committed individual experts, such as the current\r\nPresident of the Sixth Committee.\r\nOf course, I wish also to refer to organizations\r\nsuch as the Coalition for an International Criminal\r\nCourt and No Peace Without Justice as well as to\r\ninternational institutions such as the International\r\nCommittee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which took an\r\n15\r\nA/60/PV.46\r\nactive part in discussions with the various Mexican\r\nrepresentatives involved in that undertaking.\r\nI should like to pay special tribute to President\r\nPhilippe Kirsch, who visited Mexico on a number of\r\noccasions in order to hold discussions with its\r\nCongress and who also received Mexican\r\nparliamentarians at The Hague. His confidence and his\r\ntireless efforts were crucial in overcoming last-minute\r\nresistance and in dispelling any remaining doubts.\r\nMexico’s accession to the Statute of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court therefore represents the\r\nculmination of a genuine act of State. We are certain\r\nthat this one-hundredth ratification of the Statute will\r\nbring about further action aimed at achieving the\r\nCourt’s universality.\r\nMexico welcomes the submission to the General\r\nAssembly of the first report of the International\r\nCriminal Court and would like to thank the Court’s\r\nPresident for having presented it. The report provides\r\nus with an opportunity to become better acquainted\r\nwith the Court’s activities over the past year, to\r\nidentify difficulties and to determine the manner in\r\nwhich the international community can best cooperate\r\nin order to realize its dream of eradicating impunity for\r\nthe commission of the most serious crimes of\r\ninternational significance.\r\nWe are pleased to see that the Court, despite\r\nhaving been established only recently, is fully\r\noperational. While further progress is required made in\r\nthe consolidation of its structures and guidelines,\r\nwhich will provide it with the full array of tools\r\nnecessary to its operation, the results achieved so far\r\nare commendable. Mexico reiterates its support in\r\nensuring the consolidation of the Court by the earliest\r\npossible date.\r\nThe International Criminal Court has put into\r\noperation the machinery envisaged in its statute for the\r\nactivation of its jurisdiction. Three States parties have\r\nreferred to the Prosecutor situations relating to events\r\non their own territory. Moreover, the Security Council,\r\nusing the powers granted it by the statute, has also\r\nreferred to the Court the situation in Darfur. One State\r\nnon-party — Côte d’Ivoire — has deposited a\r\ndeclaration stating that it accepts the jurisdiction of the\r\nCourt. Thus we can see that the Court is operating\r\nsmoothly, in the manner that was envisaged by the\r\nStatute — no more, no less.\r\nThe report submitted by the President of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court refers to the situations\r\nthat are currently being investigated by the Prosecutor.\r\nIt also indicates that, for reasons related to the situation\r\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo, one or two\r\ncases received priority in 2005 because of their\r\nextreme gravity, and that the other cases will be\r\naddressed later on. We understand the reasons\r\nunderlying the selection of cases on the basis of their\r\ngravity. However, extreme caution must be used in\r\ncarrying out such an exercise so as to ensure that\r\nselection does not become selectivity, which would run\r\ncounter to the principles of objectivity and impartiality\r\nwhich should guide the actions of the Court.\r\nThe Security Council’s referral of the situation in\r\nDarfur under resolution 1593 (2005) is particularly\r\nrelevant in that respect. Thus, in using the mechanism\r\nprovided for in article 13, paragraph b, of the statute,\r\nthe Security Council is fulfilling its Charter-mandated\r\nresponsibilities. Resolution 1593 (2005) establishes a\r\ndelicate balance allowing the Court and the Security\r\nCouncil to fulfil their responsibilities in a coordinated\r\nmanner. Therefore, any referral made by the Security\r\nCouncil must strictly accord with the letter and the\r\nspirit of the Charter and, of course, the Rome Statute.\r\nIt is important to highlight the role that the Court\r\nhas played with regard to the principle of\r\ncomplementarity by supporting national judicial\r\nactions where possible. The objectives enshrined in the\r\nRome Statute require that the international community\r\nas a whole and the International Criminal Court\r\nshoulder their common responsibilities through\r\ncooperation and through the application of the\r\nprinciples governing such cooperation.\r\nThe principle of complementarity is the keystone\r\nof this system. Not only does it serve to decide when\r\nthe Court’s jurisdiction should be activated, but also,\r\nand more important, the fact that the statute accords\r\nStates parties jurisdictional supremacy strengthens\r\nnational judicial systems. Mexico welcomes the fact\r\nthat the Court, in its work, has strictly abided by the\r\nprinciple of complementarity.\r\nOther important developments have taken place\r\nwith respect to the work of the Court, which must be\r\ncontinued in order to ensure that the Court has all the\r\ninstruments it needs in order fully to discharge its\r\nmandate. The adoption of practical measures that will\r\nhelp provide effective and comprehensive access by\r\n16\r\nA/60/PV.46\r\nvictims to reparations is a sine qua non condition for\r\nachieving progress in strengthening the system\r\nestablished by the Court. We congratulate the Court on\r\nthe progress that has been made to date as well as on\r\nthe establishment of a Trust Fund for victims. We hope\r\nthat the work on regulations will be concluded by the\r\nnext session of the General Assembly.\r\nMexico has made voluntary contributions to the\r\nFund which, while modest, reflect my country’s\r\ncommitment to providing support to the victims of war\r\ncrimes, genocide and crimes against humanity.\r\nMr. Cordovez (Ecuador) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nEcuador is pleased with the progress made by the\r\nInternational Criminal Court. Through the substantive\r\nwork done over the past year, it has fully reaffirmed its\r\njudicial institutional character and operational capacity.\r\nThe Court’s work has eliminated any scepticism that\r\nmight have arisen concerning its effectiveness,\r\nindependence and impartiality. It has restored the hope\r\nthat crimes against humanity will never again go\r\nunpunished.\r\nThe beginning of the Court’s judicial phase with\r\nrespect to the cases of the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo, Uganda and the Central African Republic,\r\nwhich voluntarily referred the situations of their\r\nrespective territories to the Court, as well as the\r\nstatement made by Côte d’Ivoire accepting the\r\njurisdiction of the Court, demonstrate the confidence\r\nthat States parties and non-parties have in this\r\ninstitution as the best-suited instrument to fight\r\nimpunity and to assign responsibility for crimes against\r\nhumanity.\r\nThe most important event in that context was\r\nwithout a doubt the Security Council’s referral of the\r\nsituation in Darfur. That act showed clearly that\r\ncircumstances exist in which the gravity of a crime\r\ngravity and the complexity of the surrounding political\r\nsituation surpass the capability of national judicial\r\nsystems, and that, consequently, the only way to\r\nguarantee that the perpetrators of such crimes are\r\npunished is by submitting their respective trials to an\r\ninternational judicial process.\r\nEcuador believes that the ties between the\r\nSecurity Council and the Court must be strengthened\r\nand that there is a need to give full effect to the power\r\ngranted the Council by the Rome Statute to refer to the\r\nCourt situations of extreme gravity.\r\nMy country attaches particular importance to the\r\nsituation of victims and to the recognition of their\r\nrights. Effective cooperation on the part of all is\r\nnecessary to ensure that they can participate in the\r\nrelevant processes, that they receive support and\r\nprotection, and that they are able to seek redress\r\nbeyond financial compensation.\r\nIn that context, I wish to highlight the valuable\r\ncontribution that the trust fund is making on behalf of\r\nthe victims and to express gratitude for the outstanding\r\nwork of the members of the Board of Directors, whose\r\nefforts have made possible the full operation of the\r\nfund. Ecuador hopes that during the fourth session of\r\nthe Assembly of States Parties, we will be able to reach\r\na comprehensive agreement to approve the regulations\r\nfor the trust fund.\r\nMy country is convinced that fighting impunity\r\nand ensuring the rule of law and respect for human\r\nrights will contribute mightily to the strengthening of\r\ninternational peace and security. We therefore believe\r\nthat in order to guarantee the Court’s future and its\r\neffective operation, it is essential that we achieve\r\nuniversal adherence to and full application of the Rome\r\nStatute. If we are to build the better world that we all\r\nwant, we must participate fully in the institutions that\r\nwe have created for that purpose.\r\nMy country wishes to emphasize the need to\r\npromote dialogue with all States, with their relevant\r\nactors and with the organizations associated with this\r\ncause. Let us not forget that a country’s full application\r\nof the Statute and its ratification of the Agreement on\r\nthe Privileges and Immunities of the Court depend\r\nfundamentally on its level of support and cooperation.\r\nWillingness to ratify the Agreement will not in itself\r\nensure being able to overcome difficulties and\r\npressures.\r\nI wish to congratulate the Government of Mexico\r\non its decision to ratify the Rome Statute, as well as to\r\nhighlight the willingness and commitment of Latin\r\nAmerica and the Caribbean concerning this issue. That\r\nis why we pledge to support the future efforts of\r\nAmbassador Bruno Stagno Ugarte, Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Costa Rica. We are certain that his\r\ntalent and leadership will facilitate new progress for us.\r\nFinally, I wish to express my appreciation to\r\nPrince Zeid Ra’ad Zeid Al-Hussein of Jordan for his\r\noutstanding work as President of the Assembly of\r\n17\r\nA/60/PV.46\r\nStates Parties. His valuable efforts over the past three\r\nyears have undoubtedly opened the way forward for us.\r\nMr. Stagno Ugarte (Costa Rica) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): I should like at the outset to thank the\r\nPresident of the International Criminal Court (ICC),\r\nMr. Philippe Kirsch, for the skilful presentation he just\r\ngave us on the Court’s work over the past year. We\r\ntrust that the presentation of reports by the President of\r\nthe Court to the General Assembly will become a\r\nregular practice on the basis of the draft resolution that\r\nwe will adopt in the next few days.\r\nThe creation of the ICC is one of the international\r\ncommunity’s greatest achievements in recent years. It\r\nhas served to fill the void that existed in international\r\nlaw concerning individual responsibility for criminal\r\nacts that violate the international legal order. It reflects\r\nthe firm and irrevocable commitment of all States to\r\nbring to justice those who assault human dignity and\r\nthe conscience of the international community. In that\r\ncontext, we welcome the fact that the Rome Statute has\r\nachieved the milestone of 100 ratifications thanks to\r\nMexico’s recent deposition of the relevant legal\r\ninstrument.\r\nIndeed, the Court represents a formidable\r\ninstrument for combating impunity and a powerful\r\ndeterrent against the future commission of atrocities,\r\nwar crimes and crimes against humanity. It has\r\n18 judges of the highest quality, impartiality and\r\nprofessionalism. Its Prosecutor is known throughout\r\nthe world both for his courage and for his legal and\r\npolitical realism. The strategy he is implementing as he\r\nleads the Office of the Prosecutor guarantees that the\r\nCourt will contribute to post-conflict peace and\r\nreconciliation as it dispenses justice. The principle of\r\ncomplementarity, enshrined in the Rome Statute,\r\nassures us that the Court will act — as a last resort —\r\nonly when a State is unable or unwilling to judge those\r\nwho commit the most serious crimes.\r\nIn that connection, we are very pleased that the\r\nCourt has already begun its judicial activities by\r\nissuing the first arrest warrants against the leaders of\r\nthe Lord’s Resistance Army for the commission of war\r\ncrimes and crimes against humanity in Uganda. We\r\nalso welcome the progress made by the Office of the\r\nProsecutor in investigating and preparing for criminal\r\ntrials in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in\r\nDarfur, gathering the necessary evidence and\r\ninterrogating potential witnesses and victims. In\r\naddition, we are pleased that the Office of the\r\nProsecutor is preparing detailed studies on seven\r\nsituations of concern, including the reports of possible\r\ncrimes committed in the Central African Republic. My\r\nGovernment particularly appreciates the readiness and\r\ngood will shown by Uganda and the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo in referring domestic situations\r\nto the jurisdiction of this new international justice\r\nmechanism.\r\nMoreover, we welcome the fact that the ICC and\r\nthe Security Council are developing increasingly close\r\nties. Clearly, the Court coordinates directly with the\r\nmandate of the Council to promote international peace\r\nand security. Its role as a deterrent against the\r\ncommission of atrocities and war crimes broadly\r\nsupplements the Council’s work to ensure respect for\r\ninternational humanitarian law and to promote the rule\r\nof law. In that context, we are pleased that on 31 March\r\n2005, the Security Council, acting under Chapter VII\r\nof the Charter, decided in its resolution 1593 (2005) to\r\nrefer the situation in Darfur to the Court.\r\nThe Court’s future effectiveness will depend on\r\nthe cooperation it receives from all States and from the\r\nUnited Nations. United Nations cooperation at the\r\noperational level on the ground is essential to enable\r\nthe Prosecutor to effectively investigate crimes\r\ncommitted under the Court’s jurisdiction. State\r\ncooperation is also necessary both to implement arrest\r\nwarrants and to facilitate the Court’s functioning at The\r\nHague.\r\nTherefore, I should like to conclude my statement\r\nby calling upon all States to reaffirm their commitment\r\nto the International Criminal Court.\r\nMr. Duarte (Brazil): I should like to congratulate\r\nthe President of the International Criminal Court\r\n(ICC), Judge Philippe Kirsch, on his report. His\r\nthorough presentation offers a useful view of the\r\nCourt’s activities and will certainly help to ensure that\r\nthe ICC is able to function effectively.\r\nThe universality and integrity of the Rome\r\nStatute must be the permanent concern of those who\r\nhelped to establish the Court. In that connection, Brazil\r\nwelcomes the decision of the Mexican Government to\r\nratify the Rome Statute on 28 October 2005. In\r\nbecoming the one-hundredth State party to the Rome\r\nStatute, Mexico not only helped to strengthen the\r\nCourt’s legitimacy, but also reaffirmed our region’s\r\ncommitment to the fight against impunity. Now, all but\r\n18\r\nA/60/PV.46\r\nfour Latin American countries have joined the Court. It\r\nis an outstanding achievement in the short history of\r\nthe institution to date and a source of pride for our\r\nregion. Brazil also welcomes the election of\r\nAmbassador Bruno Stagno Ugarte to the presidency of\r\nthe Assembly of States Parties for the 2005-2007 term.\r\nHis able leadership will certainly be essential to the\r\nCourt in a period of intense work. I would also like to\r\nthank Prince Zeid Ra’ad Zeid for his invaluable\r\ncontribution as Chairman of the Assembly of States\r\nParties for the past three years.\r\nThe investigations in the Democratic Republic of\r\nCongo, Uganda and Darfur are important developments\r\nfor the Court. Regarding Uganda, Brazil considers that\r\nthe issuing of the first arrest warrants marks a\r\nsignificant step in the fight against impunity in that\r\ncountry.\r\nWith regard to Darfur, my delegation would like\r\nto welcome the preliminary measures taken by\r\nProsecutor Moreno-Ocampo concerning the referral of\r\nthe International Commission of Inquiry report to the\r\nICC. Justice is crucial for establishing peace and for\r\nending violence in Darfur. I should recall that Brazil\r\nabstained in the voting on Security Council resolution\r\n1593 (2005), given that, in our view, our full\r\ncommitment to the Court could not be adequately\r\nreflected in that text. Yet, Brazil has always endorsed\r\nthe authority of the ICC as the only acceptable\r\ninternational criminal institution to deal with the\r\nsituation in Darfur.\r\nThe referral was a historic step in the field of\r\ninternational criminal law; equally important will be\r\nthe outcome of the investigations and the promotion of\r\njustice. We reiterate our full support for the ICC during\r\nthe investigations and we will follow closely the\r\nreports of the Prosecutor to the Security Council\r\npursuant to the provisions of resolution 1593 (2005).\r\nThe ICC’s claim to universality is firmly rooted\r\nin the elaborate system of checks and balances built\r\ninto the Statute. That regime provides the necessary\r\nsafeguards against possible abuses and politically\r\nmotivated misuse of the Court’s jurisdiction. In that\r\nsense, my delegation regrets that, despite\r\noverwhelming support, the ICC was not mentioned in\r\nthe outcome document of the 2005 High-level Plenary\r\nMeeting.\r\nI would like to stress that assistance to victims is\r\nan important component of the strategy to fight\r\nimpunity. In that regard, the Brazilian delegation\r\nwelcomes the efforts of the Board of Directors in\r\nstrengthening the Trust Fund for Victims and urges\r\nStates and other entities to continue contributing to the\r\nvoluntary Fund.\r\nFinally, Brazil is confident that the presence of\r\nthe ICC at the General Assembly as an observer will\r\nstrengthen the cooperation between the Court and the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nMr. Hmoud (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): We are\r\ndiscussing today the report of the International\r\nCriminal Court (ICC), the first to be submitted to the\r\nGeneral Assembly in accordance with the Relationship\r\nAgreement between the United Nations and the\r\nInternational Criminal Court. That, in and of itself, is\r\nan important event because it represents the beginning\r\nof interaction between those two bodies to serve their\r\ncommon goals, including the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nPast experience and events of the past several\r\ndecades throughout the world have proven the\r\nimportance of creating effective mechanisms to combat\r\nthe most serious crimes, including genocide, war\r\ncrimes and crimes against humanity. The perpetrators\r\nof such crimes have always imagined that their actions\r\nwould go unpunished and that they enjoy impunity as a\r\nresult of their status or of an international situation that\r\nmight allow them to do whatever they want. That, in\r\nturn, has led to violations of the sanctity of human life\r\nand dignity and contributed to the eruption of wars and\r\nlawlessness in many parts of the world. For more than\r\n60 years following the Second World War, the\r\ninternational reaction to the commission of the most\r\nserious crimes was limited.\r\nThe Security Council, convinced that impunity\r\nfor the perpetrators of such crimes contributes to\r\nthreats to international peace and security, established\r\nad hoc international tribunals in a limited number of\r\nsituations. Such tribunals have been signally successful\r\nin bringing perpetrators to justice. However, the\r\ndecisions to establish and support such tribunals were\r\nprimarily political and selective. It became clear in\r\nrecent years that there was a need to create an\r\nindependent judicial body with a comprehensive\r\nmandate and jurisdiction that would reflect the goal of\r\nmaking everyone subject to law without regard to\r\npolitical considerations that might impede the\r\nadministration of international justice.\r\n19\r\nA/60/PV.46\r\nThat is what we hoped to achieve by establishing\r\nthe International Criminal Court, the rules of which,\r\nincluding its statute and rules of procedure and\r\nevidence, guarantee fair trials, the rights of both the\r\naccused and the defence, and high international\r\nstandards. Furthermore, the ability of the victims to\r\nseek compensation from an international judicial body\r\nis a precedent in the history of international justice.\r\nPreviously, a victim would be able to make claims only\r\nbefore national courts or through non-judicial\r\ncollective settlements that entailed a loss of rights.\r\nAll of that has persuaded us to support the Court\r\nin order to achieve the purposes for which it was\r\nestablished. If it is endowed with the necessary\r\nresources, the ICC can subject all cases under its\r\njurisdiction to the rule of law, deter the commission of\r\ninternational crimes, ensure respect for international\r\nhumanitarian law and put an end to wars. Giving the\r\nCourt a chance to achieve that and removing the\r\nobstacles it faces will be an important test of our\r\nseriousness about implementing the rule of law.\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the Court\r\nwill facilitate the latter’s work and expedite justice\r\nwithout prejudice to the independence of the two\r\nbodies. The same applies to cooperation between the\r\nICC and States, which contributes to the Court’s\r\ncapacity to exercise its jurisdiction and implement its\r\nresolutions and decisions.\r\nJordan welcomes the report submitted by the ICC\r\nto the General Assembly, which contains a summary of\r\nthe significant achievements that have been made\r\nwithin a very brief period of time. Those include the\r\ncreation of the Court, the election of its judges and the\r\nestablishment of its divisions and chambers. Jordan\r\nalso appreciates the efforts of the Office of the\r\nProsecutor, since the election of its officers, in\r\nformulating strategies for investigation and prosecution\r\nand initiating their implementation. We note the\r\ncreation of the Coordination Council, comprised of the\r\nPresident of the Court, the Prosecutor and the\r\nRegistrar, and reiterate the importance of that Council\r\nin ensuring the smooth functioning of the Court’s work\r\nand the development of its strategic plans. We further\r\nconsider the Court’s creation of an internal oversight\r\nmechanism to be key to ensuring transparency and\r\nconfidence in the Court’s abilities. We consider the\r\nCourt’s establishment of an internal oversight\r\nmechanism to be key to ensuring transparency in its\r\nworking methods and confidence in the Court’s\r\nabilities.\r\nJordan would like to reaffirm its ongoing support\r\nfor the International Criminal Court, stemming from its\r\nbelief in the purposes for which it was created. We also\r\nbelieve that an International Criminal Court that\r\nfunctions well and effectively, and with an\r\nimplementable statute serves the national interests of\r\nJordan.\r\nFinally, Jordan welcomes Mexico’s ratification of\r\nthe Rome Statute and calls upon all States that have not\r\nyet done so to ratify or accede to the statute.\r\nMr. Kaludjerović (Serbia and Montenegro): I\r\nwish to thank the President of the International\r\nCriminal Court, Judge Philippe Kirsch, for his\r\npresentation today of the report of the Court\r\n(A/60/177).\r\nSerbia and Montenegro fully aligns itself with the\r\nstatement made by the representative of the United\r\nKingdom on behalf of the European Union.\r\nSerbia and Montenegro welcomes the report of\r\nthe International Criminal Court as an important step in\r\nthe evolution of international law, following the\r\nhistoric milestone of the entry into force of the Rome\r\nStatute. We also welcome Mexico’s accession to the\r\nRome Statute as its one-hundredth State party truly\r\ncommitted to the universal values of the statute’s noble\r\ngoals.\r\nWe especially welcome the unsealing by Pre-Trial\r\nChamber II, on 14 October, of the first five warrants of\r\narrest against senior leaders of the Lord’s Resistance\r\nArmy for crimes against humanity and war crimes\r\ncommitted in Uganda. We expect further action on that\r\ncase, as well as on the other two cases, which concern\r\nthe tragic events in the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo and in the Darfur province of the Sudan. We\r\nwelcome the Security Council’s referral of the Darfur\r\nfile to the Court, which we consider a significant step\r\ntowards establishing the International Criminal Court\r\nas a custodian of international criminal justice. We\r\nremain ready to support all efforts aimed at ensuring\r\nthat the perpetrators of the worst crimes known to\r\ncontemporary humanity are brought to justice. To that\r\nend, we believe that the upcoming session of the\r\nAssembly of States Parties will have an important role\r\nin facilitating the Court’s development as a cornerstone\r\nof justice and the protection of the most fundamental\r\n20\r\nA/60/PV.46\r\nvalues that we all share. That role cannot be forsaken,\r\nand no one has a moral right to deny it.\r\nSerbia and Montenegro is proud to be among the\r\nfounders of an institution in which high expectations\r\nhave been placed for making the world a more just and\r\nbetter place. In my country, that sentiment is especially\r\nstrong, following the scourge of ravaging wars and\r\natrocities committed in the territory of the former\r\nYugoslavia, as well as the experiences with the United\r\nNations ad hoc Tribunal. We will do our utmost to\r\nrespect and uphold our international obligations under\r\nthe Rome Statute in order to ensure full\r\nimplementation of all legal decisions of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court in our domestic legal\r\nsystem. That process has been ongoing through the\r\nrelevant provisions of the Constitutional Charter of the\r\nState Union and through amendments to national\r\nlegislation.\r\nThrough their cooperation with the United\r\nNations ad hoc Tribunal, the Belgrade District Court,\r\nits War Crimes Chamber and the Office of the\r\nProsecutor for War Crimes have demonstrated their\r\nprofessional and technical ability to process the most\r\ncomplex cases in accordance with international\r\nstandards of justice. Furthermore, the Belgrade District\r\nCourt has expressed its readiness to contribute to the\r\nestablishment of an International Criminal Court\r\ndatabase compiling all judicial decisions and cases\r\npertaining to the substance of international criminal\r\nlaw, that is, the crime of genocide, crimes against\r\nhumanity and war crimes.\r\nSerbia and Montenegro supports the further\r\nstrengthening of the institutional capacity and the\r\nactivities of the International Criminal Court and will\r\ncontinue to do so both as a party to the Rome Statute\r\nand as a member of the current Bureau of the\r\nAssembly of States Parties. It has participated in the\r\nwork of the group of like-minded countries known as\r\nthe friends of the International Criminal Court and will\r\ncontinue to provide input through that group. We\r\nbelieve that the only way to further develop the\r\nactivities and the institutional capacity of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court is through further\r\ncooperation and support by all States parties to the\r\nRome Statute, and of all Members of the United\r\nNations, with a view to ensuring the Court’s universal\r\nacceptance.\r\nMr. McIvor (New Zealand): This year has once\r\nagain seen important developments for the\r\nInternational Criminal Court. We welcome Mexico as\r\nthe one-hundredth State party to the Rome Statute, and\r\nwe warmly congratulate it, along with the Dominican\r\nRepublic and Kenya, for joining the fight to end\r\nimpunity.\r\nThe fact that a majority of United Nations\r\nMember States have now become party to the Rome\r\nStatute highlights the vital contribution that the Court\r\nwill make to our common goal of enhanced security,\r\njustice and the rule of law. Accordingly, New Zealand\r\ncontinues to support efforts towards universalization of\r\nthe Rome Statute, and we urge other States to follow\r\nthe example of those that have recently become parties.\r\nLast year, New Zealand urged the Security\r\nCouncil to recognize the role of the International\r\nCriminal Court — if that is what the circumstances\r\nrequire — to ensure that the perpetrators of the most\r\nserious crimes do not evade justice. New Zealand\r\nwelcomes the Security Council’s referral of the\r\nsituation in Darfur to the Court in March this year. We\r\nalso welcome the examples set by Uganda, the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and the Central\r\nAfrican Republic in referring their particular situations\r\nto the Court. We celebrate the fact that the Prosecutor\r\nhas launched formal investigations into each of those\r\nsituations, and we welcome the issuing of the Court’s\r\nfirst arrest warrants, against five senior members of the\r\nLord’s Resistance Army.\r\nNew Zealand is pleased that work on the crime of\r\naggression is progressing well. We urge States to\r\nparticipate actively in that work, which constitutes a\r\nfundamental element of the Court’s mandate.\r\nDespite those achievements, New Zealand\r\nrecognizes that the Court still faces challenges. In the\r\nworld summit outcome document (resolution 60/1), the\r\nabsence of reference to the commitment to end\r\nimpunity or of any acknowledgement of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court’s central contribution to\r\nthat goal was a significant silence. While we\r\nunderstand the sincerity of those few States that have\r\nreservations about the International Criminal Court, in\r\nour view the Rome Statute contains a comprehensive\r\nrange of checks and balances to protect against abuse.\r\nAccordingly, while we respect the decision of those\r\nStates that have decided not to become parties, we\r\nrequest them to accord equal respect to the rights of\r\n21\r\nA/60/PV.46\r\nStates which have chosen to become party to the Rome\r\nStatute — in order to nurture the Court and to ensure\r\nthat it continues to be a responsible and effective\r\njudicial mechanism.\r\nNew Zealand continues to believe that the true\r\ntest of the International Criminal Court is its actions.\r\nWe remain firmly committed to the Court, and we will\r\ncontinue to work with others to ensure that it continues\r\nto be given an opportunity to carry out its mandate. We\r\nare confident that time will demonstrate that the\r\nInternational Criminal Court is worthy of our trust.\r\nMr. Løvald (Norway): I would like to begin by\r\nexpressing Norway’s recognition of the continued\r\npreparatory work carried out by the International\r\nCriminal Court over the past year. We have closely\r\nfollowed the Court’s transition from its establishment\r\nto the commencement of prosecutorial and judicial\r\nfunctions. The basic structures required for the Court’s\r\ninitial proceedings are in place, and the Court is fully\r\noperational. These important achievements mark yet\r\nanother milestone in the administration of international\r\ncriminal justice, thus motivating States to fulfil their\r\nduty to bring to justice persons who have committed\r\nmass atrocities.\r\nNorway welcomes the ICC’s first annual report to\r\nthe General Assembly, in accordance with the\r\nRelationship Agreement between the United Nations\r\nand the ICC. We thank the President of the Court,\r\nJudge Philippe Kirsch, for his presentation of the\r\nreport, which describes those achievements.\r\nAs a country dedicated to the mission of the ICC,\r\nNorway notes with satisfaction that today more than\r\nhalf of United Nations Member States are States parties\r\nto the Rome Statute. It is no small achievement that,\r\nonly three years after the establishment of the Court,\r\nwe are welcoming State party number 100 — Mexico.\r\nAt the same time, Norway strongly hopes that the\r\nnumber of States parties will continue to rise at the\r\nsame rate until we achieve universal adherence.\r\nOver the last year, significant steps have been\r\ntaken to make the court operational. Important\r\nlandmarks have included the decision by the\r\nProsecutor to launch investigations in Uganda and in\r\nthe Democratic Republic of Congo; the referral of the\r\nsituation in Darfur by the Security Council; and the\r\nlaunching of an investigation there as well.\r\nThose are indeed important steps. However, as\r\nhighlighted in the report before us as well as by the\r\nPresident of the Court, the ICC will need cooperation\r\nfrom States in these and other areas. Norway therefore\r\ncalls on all States and all peoples to cooperate with the\r\nCourt. We must not allow the perpetrators of genocide,\r\ncrimes against humanity and war crimes to go\r\nunpunished.\r\nWe emphasize that the ICC cannot operate\r\neffectively without the protection of the Agreement on\r\nPrivileges and Immunities of the Court. Norway was\r\nthe first country to ratify the Agreement — a tangible\r\ndemonstration of the priority we attach to the effective\r\noperation of the Court and to the promotion of its\r\npurposes. We invite all other States parties to ratify or\r\naccede to the Agreement as soon as possible. This is\r\nparticularly important given that the Prosecutor is\r\nalready engaged in three different investigations.\r\nIt is therefore with great expectations that we\r\nawait the resumption of the fourth session of the\r\nAssembly of States Parties at the end of November.\r\nNorway urges all States to grasp this opportunity to\r\nmake a joint effort to promote the development of this\r\nuniversal institution, bearing in mind that no institution\r\ncan ever be more than the sum of the efforts invested in\r\nit.\r\nIt is with great satisfaction that we note the\r\ndeveloping relationship between the ICC and the\r\nUnited Nations in their pursuit of the common goal of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nLet me reiterate Norway’s firm and longstanding\r\ncommitment to the Rome Statute and to the ICC as an\r\neffective, credible and responsible instrument of\r\njustice, which we hope will enjoy the support of all\r\nStates. We believe that it is in the long-term interests of\r\nall nations, irrespective of size, region or political\r\norientation, to work for the strengthening of the rule of\r\nlaw. This reflects not only our consistent approach to\r\nachieving lasting peace and reconciliation through\r\njustice, but also, we believe, a realistic assessment of\r\nthe needs of today’s interdependent world.\r\nMr. Mukongo Ngay (Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo) (spoke in French): After more than five years\r\nof occupation of the eastern part of the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, an occupation marked by\r\nmassive, systematic and clear violations of the basic\r\nnorms of international humanitarian law and by grave\r\nviolations of human rights that resulted in the deaths of\r\n22\r\nA/60/PV.46\r\nmore than 4 million of my compatriots, the\r\nstrengthening of the rule of law remains a major\r\nchallenge in order to break the cycle of violence, put\r\nan end to impunity, address the root causes of the\r\nconflict and lay the foundations of a truly democratic\r\nsociety in my country.\r\nWith the imminent end of the political transition\r\nunder way, this grim picture of the situation in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo can be relegated to\r\nthe twentieth century — a century tainted by\r\ngenocides, deportations and massacres, including a\r\nlarge number of crimes of State, but a century that\r\nnevertheless saw the emergence of the age-old dream\r\nof global justice, with the adoption of the Rome\r\nStatute, its entry into force, the election of judges, the\r\ninauguration of the Court and the election of its\r\nProsecutor.\r\nToday not only has the Court become operational,\r\nwith the opening by the Prosecutor of the first\r\ninvestigations, including the referral by the Security\r\nCouncil of the case of Darfur and the issuance of the\r\nfirst arrest warrants against five high-ranking officials\r\nof the Lord’s Resistance Army, but it has also crossed\r\nthe Rubicon on its path to universality, with the one-\r\nhundredth ratification by Mexico on 28 October last.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the activism of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court and of the Office of the\r\nProsecutor, which, since the latter announced his\r\ndecision to open an initial ICC inquiry into the\r\nsituation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, has\r\nlaunched numerous initiatives to help my country in its\r\nefforts to restore the rule of law and of State authority,\r\nwhich has been compromised by years of war.\r\nWe welcome the dynamic nature of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court which, in the context of\r\nthe ongoing inquiry into crimes in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, has devoted a procedural\r\nhearing — the well-known so-called arraignment\r\nhearing — to an investigation by the Prosecutor into\r\ncrimes committed in the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo. This is the first hearing in its history to be\r\ndevoted to the contents of a case.\r\nIn the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the\r\ndeterrent effect of the International Criminal Court has\r\nbegun to be felt, with the announcement by the\r\nProsecutor of the first inquiry of the ICC on its\r\nterritory. That event has turned out to be deeply\r\nreassuring for the people, who have been trauamatized\r\nby the consequences of war and who are now\r\nconvinced that, once the Court gets going, those who\r\nare continuing to engage in massacres against the\r\ncivilian population and in massive violations of human\r\nrights and international humanitarian law, as well as all\r\nthose who might be planning to repeat their tragic\r\nexploits in the commission of such acts, will know that\r\nsuch crimes will not go unpunished.\r\nThe war in my country has done enormous harm\r\nto the civilian population, which has paid a heavy\r\nprice. In that context, helping the victims, as\r\nemphasized by the Secretary-General in his report\r\n(S/2004/616) of 23 August 2004 on justice and the\r\nrestoration of the rule of law during the transition\r\nperiod, requires of us well-thought-out compensation\r\nplans that ensure that justice is done not only for those\r\nwho are guilty but also for also those whom the\r\nperpetrators have made to suffer.\r\nThis issue is of the greatest concern to the\r\nvictims, who hope, through the action of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court, to obtain the necessary\r\nreparations, the return of their property and\r\ncompensation equal to the losses incurred, especially\r\nsince it is acknowledged that the Court itself can set\r\nthe reparations amount without the victims’ having\r\nmade an explicit request in that connection when the\r\nCourt deems that they are not in a position to do so.\r\nAbove and beyond all of the decisions already\r\ntaken, my delegation believes that the Court can earn\r\nits reputation only when it has met the expectations of\r\nthose peoples in far-flung regions of the world who\r\nhave been sorely tried and who are craving justice. The\r\nexpectations of the Congolese people are, of course,\r\nhigh ones, but it is important to see to it that the\r\npopulation is aware of the limits, for obvious reasons,\r\nof the Court’s action — reasons ranging from the\r\napplication either of the principle of complementarity\r\nor that of the non-retroactivity of the Statute to the\r\naverage duration of an inquiry, which can vary from six\r\nmonths to three years, whereas a trial itself can last\r\nfrom one to three years.\r\nAt any rate, it is important to provide objective\r\ninformation to the Congolese people about the basic\r\nrules of the Statute of the International Criminal Court\r\nand about its rules of procedure and evidence. This\r\nshould be done through outreach campaigns,\r\nworkshops and scientific meetings, so that the people,\r\naware of the rights to which they are entitled, can limit\r\n23\r\nA/60/PV.46\r\ntheir claims accordingly. I am especially thinking of\r\nthe right of victims to participate in all stages of the\r\ntrials of the International Criminal Court in order to\r\nexpress their views and to present their requests for\r\nrestitution, compensation, rehabilitation and redress.\r\nFor that reason in particular, my delegation urges\r\nthat the legal experts working for the Court should be\r\nbroadly representative of the regions involved in the\r\nCourt’s investigations.\r\nBecause it has been established that the\r\nInternational Criminal Court cannot replace national\r\njustice, recourse to the jurisdiction of national courts\r\nwill remain the rule, in accordance with the principle\r\nof complementarity. For that reason, our draft law on\r\nthe implementation of the Rome Statute has been\r\nstudied in detail by the Council of Ministers, which has\r\nsubmitted it to Parliament for adoption. It is also for\r\nthat reason that the current process for the reform of\r\nour judicial system deserves special support and\r\nattention from the international bodies.\r\nI take this opportunity to recall my delegation’s\r\ninterest in the discussions of the Special Working\r\nGroup on the Crime of Aggression, whose conclusions\r\nwill be useful in complementing article 5, paragraph 2,\r\nof the statute, which states that the Court shall exercise\r\njurisdiction over the crime of aggression once a\r\nprovision is adopted in accordance with articles 121\r\nand 123 defining the crime and setting out the\r\nconditions under which the Court shall exercise\r\njurisdiction with respect to that crime.\r\nReaffirming my delegation’s determination to\r\nensure respect for the integrity of the statute of the\r\nCourt, I call on those States that have not yet done so\r\nto join the International Criminal Court, which ensures\r\nthe universality of our fight against impunity.\r\nIn conclusion, I thank the President of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court, Judge Philippe Kirsch,\r\nfor his comprehensive and highly instructive report and\r\nassure him of my delegation’s full cooperation in the\r\nframework of the relations between my country and the\r\nCourt.\r\nMr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): I would like to\r\nthank the President of the International Criminal Court\r\nfor presenting the first report of the Court to the\r\nGeneral Assembly (A/60/177). It gives us great\r\nsatisfaction to see the enormous progress that the Court\r\nhas made. Three States and the Security Council have\r\nreferred situations to the Court, and three of those\r\ncases are under investigation by the Prosecutor. The\r\nfirst indictments have been issued, and a number of\r\nfurther situations are being monitored by the\r\nProsecutor. Those are truly historic achievements that\r\nunderscore the Court’s role in the framework of our\r\nmultilateral efforts to end impunity for the worst\r\ncrimes known to mankind: genocide, crimes against\r\nhumanity and war crimes. They are also the fruit of the\r\nhighly committed and professional work of the senior\r\nofficials and staff of all branches of the Court, who\r\nrepresent all regions of the world and bring together\r\nvarious legal traditions.\r\nThe International Criminal Court was born as a\r\nchild of the United Nations. But now that the Court has\r\ngrown up, it has become the partner of the United\r\nNations. The Court and the United Nations, in\r\nparticular through its operations in the field, must\r\ncontinue to strengthen their partnership on the basis of\r\nthe Relationship Agreement adopted one year ago, as\r\nwell as on the basis of specific agreements.\r\nFurthermore, cooperation with, and support from, the\r\nUnited Nations are particularly relevant regarding\r\nsituations referred to the Court by the Security\r\nCouncil. Both institutions, as well as all States\r\nconcerned, have a shared responsibility to cooperate in\r\norder to make progress in the proceedings. The\r\nInternational Criminal Court cannot succeed alone.\r\nPast experience shows the enormous importance\r\nof transitional justice in the work of the United Nations\r\nin post-conflict situations. An effective partnership\r\nwith the Court is therefore indispensable. At the same\r\ntime, of course, our overriding goal must be to prevent\r\nthe worst crimes from being committed, and in that\r\nregard, the Court is a unique tool of which we must\r\navail ourselves.\r\nLiechtenstein has supported the Court from the\r\nbeginning and will continue to do so wherever\r\npossible. We have ratified both the Rome Statute and\r\nthe Agreement on Privileges and Immunities and have\r\nadopted the necessary implementing legislation.\r\nIn the context of the Assembly of States Parties,\r\none important priority is the work on the definition of\r\nthe crime of aggression. The relevant working group —\r\nwhich I have the honour of chairing — is striving to\r\nelaborate specific proposals by 2008. We note with\r\ngreat satisfaction the increased interest in the work on\r\nthat topic, which is open not only to States parties to\r\n24\r\nA/60/PV.46\r\nthe Rome Statute but to all States. It is of the utmost\r\nimportance that the Special Working Group on the\r\nCrime of Aggression fulfil its mandate and submit\r\nproposals on the definition of the crime of aggression\r\nto the review conference, because it is already agreed\r\nthat aggression falls within the category of the worst\r\ncrimes of concern to the international community as a\r\nwhole. The increased interest has led to the creation of\r\nan informal virtual working group on the crime of\r\naggression, which serves as an open platform for\r\nexchanges on that legally challenging topic outside of\r\nthe regular and intersessional meetings. We look\r\nforward to continuing our discussions on that issue\r\nwith all interested delegations.\r\nWe warmly welcome Mexico as the 100th State\r\nparty to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal\r\nCourt, thus bringing the Court another step closer to\r\nuniversality. We are confident that more ratifications\r\nwill soon follow, and we encourage all States that have\r\nnot yet done so to accede to the Rome Statute and join\r\nour efforts to translate the expression “never again” —\r\nwhich has been commonplace since the First World\r\nWar — into action. The fact that the Court has now\r\nbecome operational and that we can begin to evaluate\r\nits performance should provide fresh incentive for\r\nStates to consider such a move.\r\nMr. Rock (Canada): As many of my colleagues\r\nhave observed, just a few days ago, Mexico became the\r\n100th State party to the Rome Statute, marking a\r\nsignificant milestone in the campaign for universal\r\nratification of the Rome Statute of the International\r\nCriminal Court. The majority of United Nations\r\nMember States have now joined in the fight against\r\nimpunity for the gravest crimes under international\r\nlaw. We warmly congratulate Mexico for taking that\r\nimportant step, and we also congratulate the\r\nDominican Republic and Kenya, which became States\r\nparties to the Rome Statute during the past year.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nFar too often, war crimes, crimes against\r\nhumanity and genocide have been perpetrated with\r\nblatant impunity. Bringing perpetrators of serious\r\ncrimes to justice is an important element of long-term\r\npeace and reconciliation in all conflicts, and we call on\r\nall States to support the Court’s work in that regard.\r\nWe are pleased to note the great progress made by\r\nthe Court in just a few years of operation. Three States\r\nhave now referred situations to the Court: Uganda in\r\nDecember 2003, the Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\nin March 2004 and the Central African Republic in\r\nJanuary 2005. Côte d’Ivoire, which is not yet a party to\r\nthe Rome Statute, has declared that it would allow the\r\nCourt to exercise its jurisdiction with respect to serious\r\ncrimes of international concern that may have occurred\r\non its territory following the attempted coup d’état in\r\nSeptember 2002.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nAnother critical landmark for the Court was the\r\nreferral by the Security Council on 31 March 2005 of\r\nthe situation in Darfur, the Sudan. The Prosecutor has\r\nlaunched formal investigations into each of those\r\nsituations, and the Court recently issued its first arrest\r\nwarrants against five senior members of the Lord’s\r\nResistance Army in northern Uganda.\r\nIn our view, States have nothing to fear from the\r\nInternational Criminal Court, which has rigorous\r\nsafeguards to protect against frivolous investigations or\r\nprosecutions. While we respect the rights of States\r\nwhich have decided not to become parties, we demand\r\nequal respect for the rights of States which have chosen\r\nto become parties to the Rome Statute, as well as their\r\nright to nurture the Court and to ensure that it\r\ncontinues to be a responsible and effective judicial\r\nmechanism.\r\nIn closing, we urge all States to help strengthen\r\nthe institution that is at the forefront of the campaign\r\nagainst impunity. Through such support we will be\r\ncontributing to the entrenchment of a culture of\r\naccountability for the world’s most serious crimes and,\r\nultimately, to universal respect for the common\r\nhumanity that binds us all.\r\nMr. Playle (Australia): Australia welcomes the\r\nfirst report by the President of the International\r\nCriminal Court to the General Assembly. As a strong\r\nand committed supporter of the Court, Australia\r\nwelcomes the progress that the Court has made in the\r\npast year and, indeed, since its inception.\r\nLike many others before me, I join in\r\ncongratulating Mexico on becoming the one-hundredth\r\nState party to the Rome Statute. Australia also\r\nwelcomes the Dominican Republic and Kenya, which\r\nbecame States parties to the Statute during the past\r\nyear.\r\nJudge Kirsch has provided a compelling report on\r\nthe Court’s progress in investigations and preparations\r\n25\r\nA/60/PV.46\r\nfor trial concerning the situations currently before it.\r\nThe list is a growing one. Investigations have begun in\r\nrelation to the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\r\nUganda and the Sudan. The Court is also monitoring\r\neight other situations, including in Côte d’Ivoire and\r\nthe Central African Republic.\r\nThe Court is to be commended for its\r\ninvestigative work, which, Australia recognizes,\r\npresents unique challenges on the ground. We\r\nwelcome, in particular, the issuance of five indictments\r\nfor individuals suspected of involvement in serious\r\ncrimes in northern Uganda, and we look forward to\r\naction on those indictments in the near future.\r\nLike others, Australia thinks it is appropriate to\r\nalso take this opportunity to recognize the Security\r\nCouncil’s decision, through its adoption of Council\r\nresolution 1593 (2005) on 31 March, to refer the\r\nsituation in Darfur to the International Criminal Court\r\nfor investigation. That is a significant decision which\r\nacknowledges the Court as an important tool in\r\naddressing impunity for the most serious international\r\ncrimes. It also recognizes the role that the Court can\r\npotentially play as part of broader strategies to address\r\nissues of peace and security.\r\nThe referral of the situation in Darfur to the Court\r\nalso demonstrates close cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the International Criminal Court.\r\nAustralia welcomes that cooperation and expresses the\r\nhope and the expectation that it will continue.\r\nMr. Amolo (Kenya): I wish to express my\r\ngratitude to Judge Philippe Kirsch, President of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court, for his eloquent and lucid\r\npresentation on the activities of the Court during the\r\npast year. My delegation commends him and the other\r\nofficers of the Court for the coordinated and systematic\r\nmanner in which they have transformed the Court from\r\nthe initial set-up phase to the current operational phase,\r\nwhich focuses on its core judicial activities. We also\r\nexpress our appreciation to the Secretary-General for\r\ntransmitting the report of the Court on its activities for\r\n2004 as contained in document A/60/177.\r\nKenya aligns itself with the statement made by\r\nthe representative of Nigeria on behalf of the African\r\nStates parties to the Statute of the Court.\r\nIf the adoption of the Court’s Statute seven years\r\nago was a milestone in the reaffirmation of the rule of\r\nlaw at both the national and international levels, it was\r\nalso an expression of the international community’s\r\ndetermination to end impunity for the perpetrators of\r\nthe most serious crimes, and a demonstration of our\r\ncommon resolve to guarantee international justice for\r\nthose crimes.\r\nKenya believes that the success of the Court will\r\ndepend on the support of a vast majority of the\r\nmembership of this Organization. Although the pace of\r\nratification has been slow, we are confident that as the\r\nCourt enters its judicial phase, there will be a wider\r\nunderstanding and appreciation of its work, leading to\r\nwider participation. We are happy to note that the\r\nnumber of States parties now stands at 100.\r\nJudge Kirsch today accurately characterized Mexico’s\r\naccession as a historic milestone. We welcome that\r\nimportant development.\r\nI am also happy to report that early this year\r\nKenya completed the requisite national processes for\r\nthe ratification of the statute and deposited its\r\ninstrument of ratification on 15 March 2005, thus\r\nbecoming the ninety-eighth State party. We have now\r\nembarked on a series of national consultations with the\r\nrelevant stakeholders to speed up the domestication of\r\nthe statute. In that regard, the Government has\r\npublished the International Crimes Bill, which, once\r\nenacted into law, will fully domesticate the provisions\r\nof the statute.\r\nKenya commends the Court for the significant\r\nprogress made in its judicial activities. We note with\r\nsatisfaction that the Office of the Prosecutor has\r\ncontinued its investigations into the situations in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and in Uganda. The\r\nissuance of the first warrants of arrest with regard to\r\nthe Lord’s Resistance Army is a truly welcome\r\ndevelopment. Given the gruesome picture of atrocities\r\npainted today by the representative of Uganda, that\r\ndecisive step could not have occurred too soon.\r\nWe also note that the Office of the Prosecutor has\r\ncommenced investigations into the situation in Darfur,\r\nfollowing a referral earlier this year by the Security\r\nCouncil and that it is currently conducting an in-depth\r\nanalysis of eight other situations of concern, including\r\nthe referral by the Central African Republic. Those\r\nreferrals are a demonstration of the increased\r\nconfidence in the ability of the Court to discharge its\r\nmandate in a fair, transparent and impartial manner.\r\nKenya strongly supports the prosecutorial policy\r\nof the Office of the Prosecutor, which emphasizes the\r\n26\r\nA/60/PV.46\r\nkey principles of complementarity and cooperation\r\nwith States. We welcome the cooperation agreements\r\nbetween the Court and the countries under\r\ninvestigation and urge the Court to intensify its efforts\r\nin negotiating and concluding similar agreements with\r\naffected States and other organizations whose\r\ncooperation is critical for the success of the Court’s\r\nwork. In that context, and considering that all cases\r\npresently before the Court are on the African continent,\r\nwe look forward to the conclusion of a cooperation\r\nagreement with the African Union.\r\nMy delegation supports the ongoing work in the\r\nSpecial Working Group on the Crime of Aggression.\r\nWe recognize that the international criminal justice\r\nsystem will not be complete until the elements of the\r\ncrime of aggression are fully defined. Although that\r\ncrime is a different character, my delegation believes\r\nthat it constitutes a serious threat to international peace\r\nand security and must be given equal attention and be\r\nsubjected to the same strict regime as the other three\r\ncrimes with respect to which the Court has jurisdiction.\r\nWe urge States to marshal the necessary political will\r\nto enable a speedier agreement on the definition of this\r\ncrime.\r\nKenya is confident that the relationship\r\nagreement signed between the United Nations and the\r\nInternational Criminal Court will enhance\r\ncollaboration and strengthen the working relationship\r\nbetween the two institutions. We note that meetings of\r\nthe Assembly of States Parties are currently being held\r\nin The Hague. It is our expectation that in future these\r\nsessions will alternate between The Hague and New\r\nYork, in order to facilitate wider participation,\r\nespecially for developing countries, for which\r\ntravelling to The Hague entails an additional financial\r\nburden. It may also be worthwhile for the Court to\r\nexplore the possibility of providing travel assistance to\r\ndeveloping countries to enable them to participate in\r\nthe meetings.\r\nIn conclusion, I reiterate Kenya’s unswerving\r\ncommitment to the International Criminal Court. We\r\nwill continue to cooperate with it in the discharge of its\r\nmandate as a fair, independent and effective judicial\r\ninstitution.\r\nMs. Rivero (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): Allow\r\nme to congratulate the President of the International\r\nCriminal Court, Mr. Philippe Kirsch, on his\r\nintroduction of the report of the Court. We join our\r\nvoices to those of delegations that have already\r\nexpressed their satisfaction at the significant steps\r\nalready taken by the International Criminal Court\r\n(ICC). We welcome the information provided on the\r\nCourt’s activities this year and on those described in\r\nthe report to the General Assembly (A/60/177). In\r\nparticular, we are pleased that the Court has set as a\r\npriority the establishment of a strategic planning\r\nprocess, which we deem indispensable in order for it to\r\nfunction efficiently and to carry out the prudent\r\nfinancial management to which it is committed.\r\nThe initiation of the investigative processes in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda and Darfur\r\nhas enabled the Court to begin to exercise fully its\r\ncapacities as a judicial body and to begin the process of\r\nputting an end to impunity.\r\nWe wish to highlight the particular importance\r\nthat we attach to the Security Council’s decision,\r\nadopted in its resolution 1593 (2005), to refer the\r\nsituation in Darfur to the ICC Prosecutor. Once again,\r\nthe importance of international cooperation to protect\r\nhuman rights and to fight violations of international\r\nhumanitarian law has been made clear. We also\r\nwelcome the opportunity given to the Court to\r\ndemonstrate that its independent and impartial action\r\nwill constitute an effective mechanism for the\r\ninternational community to use in its fight against\r\nimpunity and, in particular, to prevent crimes of such\r\ngravity.\r\nWe particularly welcome the fact that in recent\r\ndays the number of ratifications of the Rome Statute\r\nhas reached 100. Here, we cannot fail to point out that\r\nthe one-hundredth State to ratify was Mexico, a\r\ncherished country from our region. Soon we hope to be\r\nable to congratulate other countries that will become\r\nparties in the coming year, establishing a new record\r\nfor the number of ratifications.\r\nUruguay has been involved in the process of the\r\nestablishment of the Court from the very beginning.\r\nCurrently, our legislative body is studying a bill\r\nproposed by the executive branch on the\r\nimplementation of the Rome Statute. The bill provides\r\nfor the incorporation into our domestic criminal law of\r\nthe crimes defined in the statute. Thus, our national\r\ncriminal code would incorporate crimes such as\r\ngenocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity,\r\nwhich were not previously part of it. We hope to pass\r\nthis law soon, so that we can comply fully with our\r\n27\r\nA/60/PV.46\r\nobligations and thus contribute to the promotion of the\r\nICC.\r\nMs. Taj El Dine (Bolivarian Republic of\r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): First, we would like to\r\nexpress our gratitude to the President of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC), Mr. Philippe\r\nKirsch, for his introduction of the report on the Court\r\n(A/60/177). We have taken note of the series of\r\nmeasures for building the Court’s capacity and\r\nensuring that it can carry out its basic functions.\r\nAs is well known to everybody in this Hall, the\r\nCourt is authorized to exercise its jurisdiction over\r\nindividuals who commit the most serious crimes under\r\ninternational law but whose punishment has not been\r\nassured by the national courts or national legislation of\r\nthe State where the crimes are alleged to have been\r\ncommitted. Moreover, as a judicial institution, the\r\nCourt is designed to administer justice; therefore, all of\r\nits actions must be fair, impartial and effective.\r\nCurrently, war crimes are on the increase, and the\r\nCourt must act against them whoever committed them.\r\nThe Court cannot overlook the atrocities committed by\r\ninvading Powers. Torture, inhuman treatment, rape and\r\nattacks carried out against civilian populations cannot\r\nbe ignored. The Court must pass judgement on the\r\nenemies of humanity. The Court will thus demonstrate\r\nits independence and impartiality in administering\r\njustice for crimes against humanity.\r\nIn the same way, when carrying out investigations\r\nin order to guarantee the integrity of its trials, it is\r\nparticularly important that the Court identify the causes\r\nthat led to the commission of crimes against humanity.\r\nOur delegation believes that this element is of crucial\r\nimportance during the investigative judicial phase of\r\nthe Court’s work. In addition, through its actions, the\r\nCourt must confirm that it is independent of the\r\ninterests of major Powers and their allies.\r\nFurthermore — and here I am addressing the Court\r\ndirectly — it is our understanding that one of the\r\npowers of the Court, and in particular of the\r\nProsecutor, is to initiate investigations on the basis of\r\ninformation that is presented. There must be prior\r\nconsideration of such information and conviction of its\r\nveracity.\r\nNon-governmental organizations are among the\r\nbodies that can provide such information. Here, the\r\njudicial body will have to conduct a review during the\r\ninvestigative phase of trials. In this respect, the Court\r\nneeds adequate criteria to identify non-governmental or\r\ncivil society organizations that serve the special\r\ninterests of national or international economic or\r\npolitical groups and that are used for the purpose of\r\nmasking the truth in order to accuse States of acts that\r\nthey have not committed, simply in order to achieve\r\ntheir goals. Therefore, our delegation is of the view\r\nthat the Prosecutor must act scrupulously and with\r\ngreat caution in order to safeguard the reputation of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court. In addition, the\r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela wishes to reiterate its\r\ncommitment to providing the Court with institutional\r\nsupport and cooperation.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on the agenda item. The\r\nAssembly has thus concluded this stage of its\r\nconsideration of agenda item 81.\r\nOrganization of work\r\nThe Acting President: Before I adjourn the\r\nmeeting, I would like to inform the General Assembly\r\nthat the President of the Assembly has received a note\r\nfrom the Chairman of the Sixth Committee requesting\r\nthat the Committee be authorized to continue its work\r\nuntil the end of November.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly decides\r\nto grant that request?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.05 p.m.\r\n"
