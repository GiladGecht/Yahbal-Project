(Sweden)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.20 a.m.\r\nExpression of sympathy to the Government and the\r\npeople of Jordan in connection with the terrorist\r\nattacks in Amman\r\nThe President: I would like to extend our\r\nsympathy to all those affected by the abhorrent terrorist\r\nattacks on three hotels in Amman, Jordan yesterday.\r\nOn behalf of the Assembly, I offer our deepest\r\ncondolences to the Government and the people of\r\nJordan and to the families and friends of all those\r\nkilled and injured.\r\nThose attacks are a further stark reminder of the\r\nimportance and the urgency of the work we are doing\r\nto adopt a comprehensive convention on terrorism.\r\nAgenda items 9 and 117\r\nReport of the Security Council (A/60/2)\r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and increase\r\nin the membership of the Security Council and\r\nrelated matters\r\nThe President: With regard to agenda item 9, in\r\naccordance with Article 15, paragraph 1, of the\r\nCharter, the General Assembly considers the annual\r\nreport submitted by the Security Council pursuant to\r\nArticle 24, paragraph 3, of the Charter. The report of\r\nthe Security Council was issued as General Assembly\r\ndocument A/60/2.\r\nConcerning agenda item 117, members will recall\r\nthat, upon recommendation of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of\r\nthe Security Council and Other Matters related to the\r\nSecurity Council, the General Assembly decided to\r\ncontinue its consideration of this item during the\r\npresent session, with a view to facilitating the process\r\nof reaching general agreement.\r\nFurthermore, in the 2005 World Summit Outcome\r\n(resolution 60/1), our heads of State and Government\r\nexpressed support for early reform of the Security\r\nCouncil as an essential element of the overall effort to\r\nreform the United Nations. Our leaders aimed at\r\nmaking the Security Council more broadly\r\nrepresentative, efficient and transparent in order to\r\nfurther enhance its effectiveness and the legitimacy and\r\nthe implementation of its decisions.\r\nOur leaders also called for adaptation of the\r\nworking methods of the Security Council to increase\r\nparticipation in, and the transparency of, its work and\r\nenhance accountability to the membership. They\r\nfurther committed themselves to pursue efforts with a\r\nview to achieving a decision on Security Council\r\nreform and requested the General Assembly to review\r\nprogress thereon by the end of 2005.\r\nAs stated in my letter of 3 November, this joint\r\ndebate offers an opportunity to Member States to give\r\ninput to the proposed review. I therefore encourage\r\nmembers to avail themselves of this occasion, and I am\r\n2\r\nA/60/PV.47\r\nlooking forward to hearing members’ comments,\r\nproposals and ideas on this important matter.\r\nI now give the floor to the President of the\r\nSecurity Council, Mr. Andrey Denisov, to introduce the\r\nreport of the Security Council.\r\nMr. Denisov (Russian Federation), President of\r\nthe Security Council (spoke in Russian): On behalf of\r\nall members of the Security Council, I would like to\r\noffer my congratulations to you, Mr. Eliasson, on your\r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its\r\nsixtieth session. It is my sincere hope that during your\r\ntenure relations between the General Assembly and the\r\nSecurity Council will be further strengthened, as we\r\nwork together to promote the purposes and principles\r\nof the United Nations, consistent with the Charter.\r\nIn my capacity as President of the Security\r\nCouncil for November 2005, I have the privilege to\r\nintroduce the annual report of the Security Council to\r\nthe General Assembly (A/60/2), covering the period\r\nfrom 1 August 2004 to 31 July 2005.\r\nThe report shows that the Security Council’s\r\nworking agenda during the reporting period has been\r\nextremely full and intense. Two hundred and twenty-\r\nnine formal meetings have been held, 195 of which\r\nwere public. The Council adopted 61 resolutions and\r\n58 presidential statements.\r\nThe range of issues considered by the Council has\r\nremained very wide, covering all the major aspects of\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nThe report gives a comprehensive description of\r\nCouncil activities, and I would like to highlight some\r\nof the key issues on which the Council has focused.\r\nIssues related to the settlement of regional\r\nconflicts and to ensuring stability in Africa have\r\nremained high on the agenda of the Security Council.\r\nThe Council responded to worsening situations in Côte\r\nd’Ivoire, Darfur and the eastern part of the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo and has sought to encourage\r\nand consolidate continuing progress in strengthening\r\npeace and stability in Sierra-Leone, Liberia, Burundi\r\nand Guinea-Bissau. The Security Council undertook a\r\nmission to Central Africa and focused on several issues\r\naffecting Africa, such as the cross-border issues in\r\nWest Africa, Africa’s food crisis as a threat to peace\r\nand security, post-conflict peacebuilding, the threat of\r\nsmall arms and the protection of civilians in armed\r\nconflict. In addition, the Council oversaw the gradual\r\nwinding down of the United Nations Mission in Sierra\r\nLeone (UNAMSIL), at one point the largest United\r\nNations peacekeeping operation, which is to be\r\nreplaced by an integrated United Nations Office in\r\nSierra Leone. That is an innovation that should make\r\nthe United Nations contribution to peacebuilding even\r\nmore effective and establish a model for other\r\ncountries emerging from conflict.\r\nOn 18 and 19 November 2004, the Council held\r\nan extraordinary session in Nairobi, its fourth outside\r\nthe United Nations Headquarters since the Council\r\nbegan meeting in New York. This was done in order to\r\nre-energize the Sudanese peace negotiations and put an\r\nend to one of the most protracted conflicts in Africa.\r\nAlso in Nairobi, the Security Council held a meeting\r\naimed at strengthening the institutional relationship\r\nwith the African Union. In a presidential statement\r\n(S/PRST/2004/43), Council members welcomed the\r\nprogress made in the national reconciliation process of\r\nSomalia.\r\nThe Council has continued its support for the\r\nongoing political transition in Iraq. In August 2004, the\r\nCouncil unanimously renewed the mandate of the\r\nUnited Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI)\r\nfor another 12-month period. UNAMI’s support was\r\nvital to the success of the January 2005 parliamentary\r\nelections, through which the Iraqi people elected the\r\nTransitional Government of Iraq. The Council has\r\nrepeatedly stressed the importance of reconciliation,\r\nnational unity and an inclusive political process.\r\nEvents in Lebanon during the period under\r\nreview also called for close Security Council attention.\r\nThe Council adopted resolution 1559 (2004) of 2\r\nSeptember 2004, reaffirming its call for the strict\r\nrespect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity\r\nand political independence of Lebanon and calling\r\nupon all remaining foreign forces to withdraw from\r\nLebanon. On 19 October 2004, the Council adopted a\r\npresidential statement (S/PRST/2004/36), requesting\r\nthe Secretary-General to report to the Council on the\r\nimplementation of resolution 1559 (2004) every six\r\nmonths.\r\nThe Council has also acted to support the\r\nLebanese investigation into the terrorist act that\r\nresulted in the death of former Lebanese Prime\r\nMinister Rafik Hariri on 14 February 2005. Following\r\nthe attack, the Council adopted a presidential statement\r\n(S/PRST/2005/4) strongly condemning the murder and\r\n3\r\nA/60/PV.47\r\nrequesting the Secretary-General to follow the situation\r\nin Lebanon closely. Following the report of the\r\nSecretary-General’s mission of inquiry into the attack,\r\nthe Council, on 7 April, unanimously adopted\r\nresolution 1595 (2005), setting up an International\r\nIndependent Investigation Commission to assist the\r\nLebanese authorities in their investigation of all\r\naspects of the assassination of the former Prime\r\nMinister.\r\nThe Council has paid close attention to other\r\nissues in the Middle East, Afghanistan and the Balkan\r\nregion. It has closely monitored the situation in Haiti in\r\norder, inter alia, to ensure a secure and stable\r\nenvironment in which the electoral process can take\r\nplace. The Council also undertook a mission to that\r\ncountry in conjunction with the Ad Hoc Advisory\r\nGroup on Haiti of the Economic and Social Council.\r\nIn the reporting period, as a result of the\r\nsustainable progress in the peace processes in Timor-\r\nLeste and in Bougainville, Papua New Guinea, the\r\nCouncil closed the United Nations Mission of Support\r\nin East Timor (UNMISET) and the United Nations\r\nObserver Mission in Bougainville. Following the\r\ncompletion of the UNMISET mandate on 20 May\r\n2005, the Council established a one-year follow-on\r\nspecial political mission, the United Nations Office in\r\nTimor-Leste.\r\nBy its resolution 1590 (2005) of 24 March 2005,\r\nthe Council established a new peacekeeping operation,\r\nthe United Nations Mission in the Sudan (UNMIS).\r\nIn addition to addressing specific ongoing\r\nconflicts and crises, the Security Council continued to\r\nhave thematic discussions related to the Council’s\r\nwork, which allowed for fruitful deliberations with the\r\nlarger United Nations membership. The Council had\r\nopen debates on children and armed conflict, women\r\nand peace and security, small arms, United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations, post-conflict peacebuilding,\r\nthe protection of civilians in armed conflict, justice and\r\nthe rule of law, and civilian aspects of conflict\r\nmanagement and peacebuilding.\r\nThe serious and continuing threat to international\r\npeace and security posed by terrorism remained a top\r\npriority of the Council, mainly through the work of the\r\nCommittee established pursuant to resolution 1373\r\n(2001) and the Committees established pursuant to\r\nresolutions 1267 (1999) and 1540 (2004), as well as\r\nthrough the cooperation and coordination among those\r\nCommittees. During the period under review, the\r\nCouncil began to receive joint briefings by the\r\nCommittee Chairmen.\r\nThe Counter-Terrorism Committee continued to\r\nwork intensively to fulfil its mandate as set out in\r\nresolution 1373 (2001), including through visits to\r\nStates and strengthened methodology for the\r\nidentification of States’ needs for technical assistance.\r\nIt also continued to develop cooperation with\r\ninternational, regional and subregional organizations.\r\nThe Working Group established pursuant to resolution\r\n1566 (2004) met to consider practical measures and\r\nprocedures for tackling terrorists not on the Al-\r\nQaida/Taliban list, as well additional means to support\r\nthe victims of terrorist acts.\r\nBy resolution 1617 (2005), adopted on 29 July\r\n2005, the Council improved the sanctions regime with\r\nrespect to Al-Qaida and the Taliban and other\r\nindividuals, groups, undertakings and entities\r\nassociated with them.\r\nThe Security Council Committee established\r\npursuant to resolution 1540 (2004) continued its efforts\r\nto strengthen the international community’s capacity to\r\nprevent weapons of mass destruction from falling into\r\nthe hands of non-State actors.\r\nLast year saw a further increase in transparency\r\nin the Security Council’s work. Council members\r\nsought to hold as many public meetings as possible and\r\nregularly organized thematic debates and Arria-formula\r\nmeetings in order to enhance our collective\r\nunderstanding of the key issues and to hear the views\r\nof non-Council members, independent experts and\r\nrepresentatives of civil society. A proactive and\r\nresponsible approach to transparency is very important\r\nfor the Security Council, which is deeply interested in\r\nstrengthening dialogue and interaction with all\r\nmembers of the United Nations. To that end, Security\r\nCouncil missions abroad made efforts to meet non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and civil society, as well as\r\nGovernments and other parties in the countries visited.\r\nThe Security Council continued to develop\r\ncooperation among the Council, the troop-contributing\r\ncountries and the Secretariat. Work on the basis of\r\nresolution 1353 (2001) and the note by the President of\r\nthe Council in document S/2002/56, dated 14 January\r\n2002, focused on important peacekeeping issues,\r\nincluding ways to improve the planning, conduct,\r\nsupport and management of peacekeeping operations,\r\n4\r\nA/60/PV.47\r\nand on the holding of in-depth and interactive\r\ndiscussions about both the immediate and underlying\r\nproblems facing specific United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations.\r\nThe Security Council, in line with the World\r\nSummit Outcome (resolution 60/1), is continuing to\r\nadapt its working methods to make it more effective,\r\nincluding by having a more open and productive\r\nrelationship with Member States not on the Security\r\nCouncil and other countries.\r\nThe Council recognizes the crucial contribution\r\nof troop-contributing countries to United Nations\r\npeacekeeping missions under its authority. The Council\r\nundertook, inter alia, through its Working Group on\r\nPeacekeeping Operations, to involve, as appropriate,\r\ntroop-contributing countries and other interested\r\ncountries more effectively in the consideration of\r\nissues relating to United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations and will continue to do so in future.\r\nThe Council will also continue to adapt its\r\nconsultations with non-Council members with\r\nreference to other aspects of its activities. For example,\r\nthe Council’s subsidiary bodies dealing with sanctions\r\nwill continue their dialogue with interested countries,\r\nin particular, with neighbouring countries, in order\r\nbetter to assess the effect of such measures and to\r\nensure more effective enforcement of those measures,\r\nsuch as arms embargoes.\r\nIn conclusion, on behalf of all Council members,\r\nI would like to thank the Secretary-General and the\r\nmembers of the Secretariat for their professionalism\r\nand invaluable support, without which the Council\r\ncould not discharge its duties.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the\r\nSecurity Council, His Excellency Mr. Andrey Denisov,\r\nfor his introduction of the report of the Council. I\r\nparticularly thank him for his words expressing the\r\nhope that relations between the General Assembly and\r\nthe Security Council will be further strengthened as we\r\nwork together to promote the purposes and principles\r\nof the United Nations, consistent with the Charter. I\r\nalso welcome his words on having a more open and\r\nproductive relationship with non-Council members and\r\nothers, including troop-contributing countries and\r\ninterested countries, in particular neighbouring\r\ncountries, affected by sanctions regimes. That dialogue\r\nis extremely important for the General Assembly.\r\nI earlier welcomed the President of the forty-sixth\r\nsession, Mr. Samir Shihabi, but I see another president\r\nin the Hall, the President of the fifty-second session. I\r\nwelcome Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, who is in the Hall\r\ntoday.\r\nMr. Hackett (Barbados): My delegation\r\nwelcomes the opportunity to participate in the joint\r\ndebate on agenda items 9 and 117, on the Report of the\r\nSecurity Council and on the question of equitable\r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of\r\nthe Security Council and related matters. I am making\r\nthis statement on behalf of the member States of the\r\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM), that are Member\r\nStates of the United Nations.\r\nBefore I begin my statement, however, I would\r\nlike, on behalf of the CARICOM member States, to\r\noffer our deepest sympathy to the Government and\r\npeople of Jordan, and especially to the families of the\r\nvictims, on the terrorist attacks that took place in\r\nAmman yesterday.\r\nCARICOM would like to thank His Excellency\r\nMr. Andrey Denisov, Permanent Representative of the\r\nRussian Federation and current President of the\r\nSecurity Council, for his detailed presentation of the\r\nreport of the Security Council. The report is clear and\r\ncomprehensive and we have just a few comments to\r\nmake on it at the present time.\r\nI also wish to express our appreciation for the\r\npresentation of the report of the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation on\r\nand Increase in the Membership of the Security\r\nCouncil and Other Matters Related to the Security\r\nCouncil. In that regard, we are particularly pleased to\r\noffer special congratulations to Ambassadors Paulette\r\nBethel of the Bahamas and Christian Wenaweser of\r\nLiechtenstein, the two Vice-Chairs of the Working\r\nGroup, for their excellent work and untiring efforts in\r\nleading the consultations on working methods.\r\nAgain in this year’s report, we see that Africa has\r\nfigured at the forefront of the Council’s agenda,\r\nalthough there were a number of other crises in other\r\nregions of the world that consumed much of the\r\nattention of the Council. We compliment the Council\r\nfor its decision to hold an extraordinary session in\r\nNairobi in order to meet closer to the centre of the\r\nconflict in the Sudan. We believe that such initiatives\r\nas well as strengthening the institutional relationship\r\nbetween the African Union and the Security Council,\r\n5\r\nA/60/PV.47\r\nbode well for closer and more effective collaboration\r\nbetween the United Nations and Africa in seeking to\r\nmaintain peace and security in that region.\r\nMember States have repeatedly called for more\r\nopenness and transparency on the part of the Security\r\nCouncil. CARICOM was, therefore, especially\r\nappreciative of the opportunity that the Security\r\nCouncil provided for Member States to discuss the\r\nsituation in Haiti by holding an open debate on Haiti\r\non 12 January of this year. CARICOM member States\r\nparticipated in the debate and were, hopefully, able to\r\nprovide a regional perspective that assisted the Council\r\nas it sought to reaffirm its long-term commitment to\r\nHaiti and underline the importance of national\r\nreconciliation, security and economic development to\r\nthe country’s stability.\r\nCARICOM further welcomed the Security\r\nCouncil’s mission to Haiti from 13 to 16 April 2005 in\r\nconjunction with the Economic and Social Council’s\r\nAd Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti. We are convinced\r\nthat that visit and the Security Council’s continued\r\nengagement in Haiti permitted the Council on 22 June\r\nof this year to adopt unanimously resolution 1608\r\n(2005), which not only extended the mandate of the\r\nUnited Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti\r\n(MINUSTAH) to February 2006, but also further\r\nincreased the Mission’s strength by 800 military\r\npersonnel and 275 civilian police.\r\nCARICOM wishes to take this opportunity to\r\ncomment on another aspect of the Security Council’s\r\nreport that has affected many countries but has\r\nparticularly impacted small, resource-deficient States,\r\nsuch as ours. I refer to the issue of counter-terrorism,\r\nwhich continues to be a matter of top priority for the\r\nCouncil.\r\nThe reporting obligations and responsibilities\r\nunder the various counter-terrorism resolutions, while\r\naccepted as necessary, have nonetheless proven to be\r\nonerous to most of our States. We therefore welcome\r\nthe initial efforts made by the various subcommittees\r\nof the Council to provide expertise and advice to\r\nMember States lacking the knowledge, experience or\r\nresources to implement the several resolutions, but\r\nwould plead for even greater assistance, if we are\r\nexpected to be able to fulfil all of our reporting\r\nobligations in a timely manner. Furthermore, we\r\nencourage the Security Council to consider ways of\r\nconsolidating State reporting requirements, as stated by\r\nour Heads of State and Government in the outcome\r\ndocument of the September Summit.\r\nTurning now to the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil, CARICOM is disappointed that the General\r\nAssembly has been unable, to date, to reach agreement\r\non the issue of an increase in the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council. CARICOM has been consistent in its\r\ncall for an increase in membership of the Council and\r\nparticularly for greater representation from the\r\ndeveloping countries and especially from States from\r\nthe African continent. CARICOM believes that the\r\nmatter of expansion remains critically important and\r\nthat we all need to redouble our efforts to reach\r\neffective agreement on the issue in the near future.\r\nCARICOM is, however, convinced that\r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council is\r\nprimarily and fundamentally grounded in reform of the\r\nworking methods of the Council, and we had hoped for\r\ngreater progress in the work of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group.\r\nCritical to the reform of the Security Council is\r\nthe need for greater transparency and openness in the\r\nworking methods of the Council, and we therefore\r\nsupport the discussions that have been recently\r\ninitiated here in New York, through the draft resolution\r\non working methods put forward by the delegations of\r\nCosta Rica, Jordan, Liechtenstein, Singapore and\r\nSwitzerland.\r\nCARICOM is also heartened that there is\r\nwidespread acceptance of the view that the Security\r\nCouncil should be accountable to the General\r\nAssembly. Committed as we are to the primacy of\r\nmultilateral diplomacy, we believe that such an\r\napproach would be the correct one. We further support\r\nthe call for more frequent open debates of the Security\r\nCouncil to allow for greater inclusiveness and\r\nparticipation of all non-Member States and for more\r\nfrequent and comprehensive Council briefings to non-\r\nmembers as a means of keeping all delegations fully\r\ninformed of Security Council activities. CARICOM\r\nalso supports increased formal interaction between the\r\nCouncil and troop-contributing countries as a\r\nnecessary aid to the decision-making process on the\r\nestablishment, conduct, review and termination of\r\npeacekeeping operations.\r\nCARICOM is of the view that, whereas sanctions\r\nmay at times constitute a legitimate and necessary tool\r\nfor the enforcement by the Council of measures to\r\n6\r\nA/60/PV.47\r\nmaintain international peace and security, we believe\r\nthey should be imposed only as an absolute last resort\r\nand should be time-bound and accompanied by a clear\r\nexit strategy. Furthermore, CARICOM stresses that\r\nspecial care and attention should be given to the design\r\nand implementation of sanctions in order to avoid, or at\r\nleast minimize, their negative impact on civilian\r\npopulations.\r\nFew questions on the issue of Security Council\r\nreform have proven to be as intractable as that question\r\nof the veto. CARICOM believes that the veto is an\r\nanachronism; and ideally it should be limited in its use\r\nwith a view to its eventual elimination. In the\r\nmeantime, we agree that the veto should be used with\r\nutmost restraint and should be limited to actions taken\r\nunder Chapter VII of the Charter.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to point out that in the 2005\r\nsummit outcome document (resolution 60/1), heads of\r\nState and Government agreed that early reform of the\r\nSecurity Council is an essential element of our overall\r\neffort to reform the United Nations in order to make it\r\nmore broadly representative, efficient and transparent.\r\nCARICOM believes that Member States need to\r\ncontinue to be seized of the issue if we are to\r\nimplement that aspect of the summit outcome\r\ndocument. CARICOM member States therefore stand\r\nready to participate in the consultations, which we\r\nbelieve should be continued during the sixtieth session.\r\nMr. Akram (Pakistan): May I begin by\r\nexpressing Pakistan’s condemnation of the dastardly\r\nterrorist attacks that took place in Amman yesterday.\r\nThe people and the Government of Pakistan convey\r\ntheir profound grief and condolences to the\r\nGovernment and the people of the Hashemite Kingdom\r\nof Jordan and to the families of the victims.\r\nWe are considering once again the important\r\nissue of reform of the Security Council, together with\r\nthe Council’s report to the General Assembly (A/60/2).\r\nThe discussion is taking place in the wake of the 2005\r\nsummit and in the midst of the process being led by\r\nyou, Mr. President, to implement the summit’s\r\ndecisions.\r\nThe rationale and justification for reform of the\r\nSecurity Council is clear: the Council should be\r\nreformed to make it more representative, more\r\ntransparent, more accountable and more effective.\r\nHowever, there are significant differences on how\r\nthose objectives can be achieved. As we open this\r\ndebate, the positions of all parties on the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council are well known and have been\r\nreaffirmed in recent days.\r\nThe position of the Uniting for Consensus group,\r\nwhich was circulated during the last session in\r\ndocument A/59/L.68, is also known to the entire\r\nmembership. The members of the group continue to\r\nbelieve that our proposal offers the most promising\r\nbasis to evolve a consensus, especially on the issue of\r\nequitable representation on the Security Council.\r\nLet me briefly reiterate the virtues of the Uniting\r\nfor Consensus proposal: First, our proposal is fair and\r\nequitable. It respects the principle of the sovereign\r\nequality of States and does not discriminate between\r\nMember States.\r\nSecondly, our proposal will increase the\r\nopportunity for all Member States, including the small\r\nand medium-sized States to secure more representation\r\non the Security Council.\r\nThirdly, it will enhance the accountability of\r\nSecurity Council members through the democratic\r\nmechanism of periodic elections and, if agreed, re-\r\nelections.\r\nFourthly, our proposal is simple. It proposes a\r\ndirect Charter amendment for approval by the\r\nAssembly.\r\nFifthly, the Uniting for Consensus proposal is\r\nrealistic. Since it can accommodate the interests and\r\npositions of all Member States, this proposal, if\r\napproved, is likely to secure the required ratifications,\r\nincluding the necessary ratification of the five\r\npermanent members of the Security Council.\r\nAnd finally, the greatest virtue of the proposal is\r\nits flexibility. It can accommodate, through variable\r\narrangements in each region, the aspirations and\r\ninterests of the majority of the membership including\r\nregional groups such as the African Group.\r\nWe respect and understand Africa’s desire for\r\nequitable representation on the Security Council.\r\nAfrica is striving to redress a historic injustice. We\r\nbelieve that the Uniting for Consensus proposal is\r\nentirely compatible with the African approach. Both\r\nour position and that of the African Union is based on\r\nthe principle that each region should be in a position to\r\n7\r\nA/60/PV.47\r\ndetermine its own specific arrangement for\r\nrepresentation on the Council.\r\nAfrica’s demand for two permanent seats, in our\r\nview, is different from other proposals which seek\r\npermanent membership for individual States. Africa, as\r\nwe see it, seeks permanent seats for the entire region of\r\nAfrica. We note also that against the two empowered\r\nseats sought by Africa, representation on the Council\r\ncould be from two or, through rotation, a larger number\r\nof African States, under arrangements to be made by\r\nthe Africans themselves. In our view, rotation is the\r\nbest means to ensure the representation of regional\r\ninterests, including those of Africa, as well as to\r\nprovide greater opportunities to all States to secure\r\nmore frequent membership of the Security Council.\r\nSince our proposal is based on a regional\r\napproach, it could also accommodate the interests of\r\nsubregional groups, such as the Arab League, the\r\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM) and Central\r\nAmerica. Other Groups, such as the Organization of\r\nthe Islamic Conference, could also secure assured\r\nrepresentation against the seats allocated to the regions\r\nof Africa or Asia. Moreover, through the provision\r\nmade for possible re-election, the Uniting for\r\nConsensus proposal offers the possibility of long-term\r\nand even continued membership for some States if they\r\nare nominated for that purpose by their respective\r\nregions.\r\nWe are all aware that agreement within the\r\ngeneral membership on the issue of representation on\r\nan enlarged Security Council will require difficult and\r\npatient negotiations. Member States must be allowed\r\nthe necessary time and space to reconcile their\r\npositions and to evolve a solution acceptable to the\r\nentire membership. It is therefore essential to engage in\r\ndialogue and constructive negotiation to achieve an\r\nequitable and widely acceptable solution.\r\nMeanwhile, we also need to give consideration to\r\nthe other aspects of Security Council reform, namely,\r\nits working methods — the so-called cluster II issues.\r\nFor a large majority of Member States, especially small\r\nand medium States, the reform of the Security Council\r\nimplies, first and foremost, an improvement in its\r\nworking methods. The General Assembly’s Open-\r\nended Working Group has reached provisional\r\nagreement on a large number of proposals to improve\r\nthe Council’s working methods. Some of those\r\nproposals are being implemented, but the majority still\r\nawait translation into the practice of the Council.\r\nI would like to thank Ambassador Andrey\r\nDenisov, President of the Security Council, for\r\npresenting the Council’s report to the General\r\nAssembly. The quality and content of the report have\r\nimproved. The present report provides a good\r\nstatistical record and a ready reference regarding issues\r\nunder the Council’s consideration. However, it does not\r\ncontribute to a better understanding by the general\r\nmembership of how the Council has dealt with specific\r\nsituations and the ways in which it has reached its\r\ndecisions. In that context, I would like to reiterate\r\nPakistan’s concern about the Council’s encroachment\r\non issues such as those considered in so-called\r\nthematic debates, which lie more appropriately within\r\nthe jurisdiction of the General Assembly or the\r\nEconomic and Social Council.\r\nPakistan supports the full implementation of\r\nAssembly resolution 58/126, in particular its call for\r\nSecurity Council reports to the General Assembly on\r\nspecific topics, briefings to the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly by the President of the Security\r\nCouncil and joint meetings between the Presidents of\r\nthe General Assembly, the Security Council and\r\nEconomic and Social Council. Those mechanisms\r\nshould be institutionalized as soon as possible.\r\nHowever, the reform of the Council’s working\r\nmethods must go beyond such improvements in its\r\noperating processes. Openness, transparency and\r\ninclusiveness should be introduced in the working\r\nmodalities of the Security Council and its subsidiary\r\nbodies, especially the sanctions committees and those\r\ndealing with generic issues such as terrorism and non-\r\nproliferation, which are of direct concern to the general\r\nmembership. The Council’s work must cease to be\r\nconducted in virtual secrecy from the general\r\nmembership. As envisaged in the Security Council’s\r\nprovisional rules of procedure, most of the Council’s\r\nwork should be conducted in public meetings, as was\r\nthe case until the end of the cold war. Informal\r\nconsultations should be the exception, rather than the\r\nrule they have become. Member States that are most\r\ndirectly concerned in an issue should be able to\r\nparticipate in both the open and the informal meetings\r\nof the Council. Draft resolutions and proposals\r\ncirculated informally in the Council should be\r\navailable to all Member States, at least before they are\r\nprovided to the media.\r\n8\r\nA/60/PV.47\r\nIn the context of improving the Council’s\r\nworking methods, Pakistan is sympathetic to most of\r\nthe proposals contained in the informal paper\r\ncirculated by Costa Rica, Jordan, Liechtenstein,\r\nSingapore and Switzerland. The areas covered in the\r\nannex to the paper — the Council’s relationship with\r\nthe General Assembly and other principal organs,\r\nimplementation of Council decisions, the working of\r\nsubsidiary bodies, the use of the veto, the conduct of\r\npeacekeeping operations and the integration of new\r\nCouncil members — are all vital to ensure\r\ntransparency, inclusiveness and accountability in the\r\nCouncil’s work. My delegation looks forward to an\r\nearly opportunity to offer our suggestions and views to\r\nenrich the proposals circulated by those five\r\ndelegations, and to evolve agreement on them.\r\nPakistan believes that any decision on the reform\r\nof the Security Council should be adopted by\r\nconsensus, or at least through the widest possible\r\nagreement. Our reasons for taking that position are\r\nclear. Reform of the Council is an important issue. It\r\nimpinges on the national security interests of every\r\nMember State. Any precipitate move to secure a\r\ndecision by a vote would revive regional tensions and\r\nresurrect divisions within the Organization. It would\r\nonce again eclipse, and possibly derail, the rest of the\r\nUnited Nations reform agenda. It could halt the\r\nheartening progress we are making, or expect to make,\r\non the establishment of a Peacebuilding Commission,\r\nterrorism, the Human Rights Council and, most\r\nimportant, the implementation of the development\r\nagenda.\r\nMoreover, any proposal for Security Council\r\nreform that is adopted by a divisive vote is unlikely to\r\nbe translated into reality, as it will not obtain the\r\nratification of two thirds of the membership, including\r\nthe five permanent members. Indeed, a divisive vote is\r\nlikely to freeze the status quo in the Security Council\r\nand thus squander the opportunity for its early reform\r\nand democratization.\r\nThe President of the General Assembly has been\r\nmandated by the 2005 summit to conduct consultations\r\non the issue of the reform of the Security Council and\r\nto report progress before the end of this session. We\r\ntrust that, at the appropriate time, he will convene a\r\nmeeting of the Open-ended Working Group on this\r\nissue and enable delegations to exchange views in\r\norder to further advance the possibilities for consensus\r\non the important issue of Security Council reform,\r\nincluding the improvement of its working methods.\r\nMr. Al-Shamsi (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in\r\nArabic): At the outset, I would like, on behalf of the\r\npeople and Government of the United Arab Emirates,\r\nto join the President and those who have spoken before\r\nme to express our sympathy and condolences to the\r\nGovernment and people of fraternal Jordan and to the\r\nfamilies of the victims of the heinous terrorist attacks\r\nthat took place last night in Amman, the capital of\r\nJordan. We strongly condemn those acts.\r\nOn behalf of the delegation of the United Arab\r\nEmirates, I would also like to express our gratitude and\r\nappreciation to the Chairman and two Vice-\r\nChairpersons of the Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase\r\nin the Membership of the Security Council and other\r\nMatters related to the Security Council for the valuable\r\ninformation contained in the Group’s recent report\r\n(A/59/47). The report reflects the great efforts made\r\ntowards reaching the consensus we all desire in the\r\nareas of strengthening international representation in\r\nthe Security Council and enhancing transparency in\r\nexecuting its responsibilities with regard to\r\nmaintaining international peace and security.\r\nThe last decade witnessed the launching of a\r\ncomprehensive reform process, especially in the United\r\nNations system, with a view to enabling it to keep up\r\nwith the international changes and challenges that\r\nemerged after the end of the cold war, including the\r\nconcept of a new world order based on the principles of\r\npartnership, democracy and the diverse interests of\r\nStates and peoples.\r\nGiven the fact that the Security Council is a\r\nprincipal organ of the United Nations and has primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security in accordance with Article 24 of the\r\nCharter, heads of States and Government were keen to\r\nreaffirm, during the Millennium Summit of the year\r\n2000 and the High-level Plenary Meeting of the\r\nAssembly’s sixtieth session, the importance of\r\ncontinuing and intensifying efforts to reform\r\ncomprehensively the structure of the Council, improve\r\nits representative character, increase its efficiency and\r\ntransparency, and strengthen its democratic character.\r\nThat will help the Council to increase its effectiveness\r\nand legality as it implements its resolutions, which aim\r\nat establishing international peace and protecting\r\n9\r\nA/60/PV.47\r\nhumankind from war, gross violations of human rights\r\nand other current threats facing the world.\r\nWhen the Security Council was established in\r\n1945, there were 51 Member States. Although the\r\nmembership of the United Nations has now reached\r\n191, the composition of the Council has not yet\r\nreflected that reality. Nor has it succeeded in\r\nrepresenting the international community in a\r\ndemocratic and fair manner, a fact that has resulted in\r\ncreating a political imbalance that undermines the\r\ntransparency of the Council’s resolutions regarding\r\nmany important international issues. We therefore\r\nemphasize the need for the international community to\r\ncarry out an essential and viable reform of the structure\r\nand working methods of the Security Council. That\r\nmust include an increase in the Council’s permanent\r\nand non-permanent members, in order to enable it to\r\ncarry out its fundamental role of addressing the\r\nexisting security threats and challenges facing our\r\nnations.\r\nMy delegation has carefully studied the\r\nrecommendations of the Secretary-General and his\r\nHigh-level Panel on Threats Challenges and Change\r\nand has followed closely the special consultations of\r\nthe General Assembly and the regional groups in the\r\nlast few months, which dealt with initiatives, draft\r\nresolutions and proposals. We are concerned about the\r\ndeep differences in the views of States in connection\r\nwith the form and size of the Council. We therefore\r\nreaffirm our position calling for restructuring the\r\nmembership of the Council in a manner more\r\nconsistent with its current agenda, which has become\r\nmore complex and which has exceeded the traditional\r\nsecurity issues of the cold war era. In that context, we\r\nstress that the process of enlarging the membership of\r\nthe Security Council should be based on the following\r\nthree pillars.\r\nFirst, the process of reforming and expanding the\r\nSecurity Council should be part of a common and\r\nintegrated endeavour based on the principles of the\r\nsovereign equality of States and their equitable\r\ngeographical representation on Council, in contrast to\r\nthe biased and selective policy currently prevailing in\r\nthat body.\r\nSecondly, any increase in Council membership\r\nmust address the issue of the underrepresentation of\r\nsmall and developing States in the Council.\r\nThirdly, Arab States, which include 22 countries\r\nand represent almost 12 per cent of the total\r\nmembership of the United Nations, must be allocated a\r\npermanent seat in the Security Council. That seat\r\nshould be filled on a rotating basis and in coordination\r\namong the Arab States, in accordance with the\r\npractices applied in the League of Arab States and in\r\nthe context of the African and Asian Groups. Should\r\nthat approach be adopted, it will strengthen the\r\neffectiveness of the participation of those countries in\r\naddressing the most complicated regional issues on the\r\nCouncil’s agenda and in the joint efforts to maintain\r\nregional and international peace and security.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates notes with satisfaction\r\nthe number of measures, albeit limited, taken in the last\r\nfew years to improve some of the working methods of\r\nthe Council, in particular as regards increasing the\r\nnumber of open meetings and inviting non-Council\r\nmembers to its debates, especially those participating\r\nin peacekeeping operations. Nevertheless, we are\r\ndisappointed at the policy of double standards followed\r\nby the Council in addressing some of the issues on its\r\nagenda, specifically those pertaining to peace and\r\nsecurity in the Middle East. That contradicts the\r\nCouncil’s previous relevant resolutions. We therefore\r\ncall for a serious, comprehensive and objective\r\nevaluation of the Council’s working methods in order\r\nto enhance the institutional character and transparency\r\nof its procedures, working methods and decision-\r\nmaking standards. In that context, we call for the\r\nfollowing measures.\r\nFirst, the use of the right of the veto should be\r\nabolished or rationalized. That right has on many\r\noccasions inhibited the Council from finding fair and\r\npermanent solutions to many important issues in\r\naccordance with the principles of the Charter,\r\nresolutions of international legitimacy and the rule of\r\nrelevant international laws.\r\nSecondly, we call for the Council to take into\r\nconsideration the interests of States whenever it adopts\r\nresolutions under Chapter VII of the Charter, which\r\npermits the imposition of economic sanctions on\r\ncountries violating Council resolutions.\r\nThirdly, we call for non-Council members,\r\nespecially those with direct or indirect interests in\r\nissues under discussion by the Council, to be permitted\r\nto participate in the Council’s consultations in that\r\nregard.\r\n10\r\nA/60/PV.47\r\nFourthly, we call for coordination between the\r\nSecurity Council, the General Assembly and regional\r\ngroups to mobilize all potential ways and means to\r\ncontain existing disputes and conflicts and to protect\r\nhumankind from their dangerous consequences.\r\nIn conclusion, we hope that our deliberations on\r\nthis item will lead to a convergence of views and to the\r\nstrengthening of a constructive international\r\nunderstanding aimed at achieving the desired reform in\r\nthe structure and working methods of the Security\r\nCouncil, in order to enable it to fully discharge its\r\ngrowing responsibilities in the maintenance of regional\r\nand international peace and security.\r\nMr. Almansoor (Bahrain) (spoke in Arabic): At\r\nthe outset, allow me to join the President in expressing\r\nour sympathy and condolences to the delegation of the\r\nHashemite Kingdom of Jordan and to the fraternal\r\npeople of that country in connection with the heinous\r\nand dastardly terrorist bombings that took place\r\nyesterday in Amman, which took dozens of innocent\r\nlives. I pray to the Almighty to extend his mercy and\r\nsuccor to the victims and their families.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the report of the\r\nSecurity Council to the General Assembly contained in\r\ndocument A/60/2, which was presented to the\r\nAssembly by Ambassador Denisov, Permanent\r\nRepresentative of the Russian Federation and this\r\nmonth’s Council President. That report provides an\r\noverview of the Council’s activities in the past year\r\nwith regard to the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security.\r\nWith the vision it contains, that report provides\r\nMember States an opportunity to study and assess the\r\nCouncil’s work, as well as its growing role in dealing\r\nwith the various international issues falling within its\r\npurview. Member States must therefore scrutinize the\r\nreport in order to be fully aware of actions taken within\r\nthe Council, which, in accordance with the Charter,\r\nacts on behalf of all Member States. That is all the\r\nmore important given that the important resolutions\r\nadopted by the Council place binding obligations on all\r\nMembers.\r\nThere is no doubt that the Security Council has\r\nbecome the most active organ of the United Nations.\r\nIts role has in fact grown significantly in recent years,\r\nmaking the Council the most visible expression of\r\nUnited Nations activity in the world. Any failure by the\r\nCouncil to deal with the world’s issues could therefore\r\ntarnish the image of the United Nations in world public\r\nopinion, which has reduced its perception of the\r\nOrganization to the Security Council alone. For the\r\nsake of the Organization as a whole, we must correct\r\nthat perception.\r\nTo set matters right, we assert that the roles of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil should not be diminished. Their important and\r\nmajor roles as two of the principal organs of the United\r\nNations must be emphasized and brought to the fore;\r\nthey are equal in importance to the Security Council.\r\nThe importance of the roles of those two organs must\r\nnot be diminished when it comes to addressing all\r\ninternational issues, be they political, economic or\r\nsocial.\r\nOur world today is experiencing an evolving\r\npolitical climate. This era poses both a challenge and a\r\ntest for the Organization, which must deal with them\r\nably and efficiently. In addition to the ongoing threats\r\nthat we have all failed to resolve, new challenges\r\nconfront the Organization. Terrorism, which has\r\nbecome widespread and out of control, has affected all\r\nof us. We must deal with it in a concerted manner in\r\norder to address its root causes. The spread of deadly\r\ndiseases has taken thousands of lives. In fact, the\r\nvictims of such diseases outnumber the victims of war.\r\nThat makes it incumbent upon us all to cooperate to\r\ndeal with and eradicate those diseases. There are also\r\nother important issues facing us. As individual\r\nMembers and as an Organization, we must deal with\r\nthem together to find appropriate solutions.\r\nMy delegation is pleased to welcome the report of\r\nthe Open-ended Working Group on the Question of\r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters\r\nrelated to the Security Council (A/59/47). We express\r\nour sincere thanks to Mr. Jean Ping, former President\r\nof the General Assembly, for his chairmanship of the\r\nWorking Group, and his two Vice-Chairmen, the\r\nPermanent Representatives of the Bahamas and\r\nLiechtenstein, for their tireless efforts.\r\nThe question of the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil continues to be one of the main issues debated\r\nduring the General Assembly’s annual sessions. Many\r\nheads of State and Government expressed their\r\nGovernments’ opinions on this matter during the\r\ngeneral debate that took place at the Assembly’s High-\r\nlevel Plenary Meeting, from 14 to 16 September.\r\n11\r\nA/60/PV.47\r\nThe Working Group is considering matters of\r\nextreme importance. The relationship between the\r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly, the\r\nrelationship between the Security Council and the other\r\nprincipal organs of the United Nations, consultations\r\nwith troop-contributing countries, matters relating to\r\nthe work of sanctions committees and other subsidiary\r\nbodies of the Security Council, and the issue of the use\r\nof the power of the veto are all matters of great\r\nimportance that must be clearly defined in order to\r\navoid conflict among the competencies of the principal\r\norgans of the United Nations. We believe that the\r\nrelationships among the various organs of the United\r\nNations must be complementary and cooperative, as\r\nthey are clearly regulated by the provisions of the\r\nCharter, which divides responsibilities and work\r\namong the organs. As Charter rules, those provisions\r\nmust be respected and maintained, for they guarantee\r\nthat there will be no conflict with regard to\r\ncompetencies and responsibilities, thus preventing\r\nencroachment by one organ on the purview of another.\r\nMy delegation believes that establishing a strong\r\nrelationship and ongoing cooperation between the\r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly is a matter\r\nof critical importance to the effectiveness of the United\r\nNations in dealing with the challenges and threats\r\nconfronting it. That relationship must be interactive in\r\nserving the interests of all Member States. To achieve\r\nthat goal, cooperation between those two organs, must\r\nbe strengthened and further dialogue and exchanges of\r\ninformation must be pursued. Given the great\r\nimportance of the matter and the fact that the General\r\nAssembly, as the main organ of the United Nations, is\r\nan integral part of the collective security system\r\nestablished by the Charter, the Security Council must\r\nrespect the wishes of the Assembly in its decision-\r\nmaking process.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council must be\r\ncomprehensive and reflect the new political realities of\r\nour times. The Council will not be able to maintain\r\ninternational peace and security, as mandated by the\r\nCharter, unless it reflects changes on the international\r\nscene and the new realities of the twenty-first century.\r\nIt must also be democratic and transparent and must\r\nprotect the interests of small States even before those\r\nof large ones. Its objectives must be in the interest of\r\nall if it is to be truly representative of all States, protect\r\ntheir rights and interests and ensure their stability.\r\nReform of the Security Council, the main organ\r\nof the United Nations entrusted with the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security, has now become an\r\nurgent priority due to awareness among all Member\r\nStates of the need for the Council to equitably\r\nrepresent them all. Questions of increasing its\r\nmembership and improving its working methods and\r\nprocedures have become priority issues facing the\r\nUnited Nations. There is also a need to ensure that\r\nCouncil reform will serve the interests of all States. It\r\nmust take into account the large increase in the\r\nmembership of the Organization. Efforts must also be\r\nredoubled in order to ensure that the Council equitably\r\nrepresents all States and that it takes all their interests\r\ninto account.\r\nThe new Security Council we aspire to must be\r\none that represents all States, protects all their interests\r\nand ensures their security. It must ensure their stability.\r\nIt must be a Council to which all turn for protection in\r\ntimes of crisis and need. It must be a Council that all\r\nMembers trust, as well as one that guarantees peace\r\nand security, defends rights and establishes justice. It\r\nmust be guided by equality. That is the Council we all\r\ndesire for our Organization.\r\nMr. Hamidon (Malaysia): At the outset, allow\r\nme to join you, Sir, and others who have spoken before\r\nme to express, in the strongest terms, our\r\ncondemnation of the terrorist attacks that took place in\r\nAmman. On behalf of the Government and people of\r\nMalaysia, we extend our deepest condolences to the\r\nGovernment and people of Jordan for the loss of life\r\nand the destruction caused by those attacks.\r\nMy delegation is pleased to participate in this\r\njoint debate on agenda items 9 and 117. I wish to\r\nexpress my sincere appreciation to Ambassador Andrey\r\nDenisov of the Russian Federation, current President of\r\nthe Security Council, for his presentation of the annual\r\nreport of the Security Council to the General\r\nAssembly, as contained in document A/60/2. My\r\ndelegation has taken note of the Council’s report. I\r\nwould also like to congratulate the newly elected\r\nmembers of the Council for the period 2006 to 2007,\r\nnamely, Congo, Ghana, Peru, Qatar and Slovenia. We\r\nare confident they will bring fresh impetus to the work\r\nof the Council.\r\nThe General Assembly’s consideration of the\r\nSecurity Council’s annual report provides a good\r\nopportunity for the larger membership of the\r\n12\r\nA/60/PV.47\r\nOrganization to assess the work and performance of the\r\nCouncil during the period under review. That is in\r\nkeeping with Articles 15 and 24 of the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations, where it is stipulated that the\r\nAssembly shall receive and consider annual and special\r\nreports from the Council and that those reports shall\r\ninclude an account of the measures that the Council has\r\ndecided upon or taken to maintain international peace\r\nand security.\r\nThe report before us is a useful reference that\r\nsummarizes the extensive work carried out by the\r\nSecurity Council over the period under review. We\r\nappreciate the vital contribution and pivotal role of the\r\nCouncil in the maintenance of world peace and\r\nsecurity. The discussion on the Council’s report\r\nprovides an opportunity for Member States to reflect\r\nupon the importance of the Council’s role and how its\r\nefficiency and effectiveness may be further enhanced.\r\nThat should be seen in the context of promoting\r\ntransparency in the work of the Council.\r\nWhile my delegation commends the ongoing\r\ntrend towards transparency in the Council’s work,\r\ngreater transparency and accountability could be\r\npromoted by convening an open meeting of the\r\nCouncil to discuss its report before it is submitted to\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nMy delegation notes that the Council addressed a\r\nwide range of issues during the period under review,\r\nreaffirming the trend in recent years towards a\r\ncontinuous increase in the volume and scope of the\r\nCouncil’s activities. A total of 229 meetings were held,\r\n61 resolutions were adopted and 58 presidential\r\nstatements were made.\r\nConflicts and instability in Africa continue to be\r\nat the forefront of the Council’s agenda. Despite the\r\nseverity of the circumstances of the crisis in the Sudan,\r\nMalaysia is pleased that the situation has improved\r\nconsiderably following the successful conclusion of the\r\nNaivasha peace process. My delegation commends the\r\nCouncil for taking the initiative to adopt eight\r\nresolutions on the Sudan and to convene extraordinary\r\nmeetings at Nairobi on 18 and 19 November 2004 —\r\nonly the fourth time it has met outside United Nations\r\nHeadquarters. The deployment of the United Nations\r\nMission in the Sudan clearly demonstrates the\r\ncommitment of the Security Council to peace and\r\nsecurity in the country, opening a new chapter in the\r\ncountry’s history. Malaysia looks forward to the\r\nCouncil taking more effective decisions on conflict\r\nsituations, particularly in Africa.\r\nThe increasing practice of holding open meetings\r\nof the Council provides an important contribution, as\r\nsuch meetings provide opportunities for the general\r\nmembership to participate in the Council’s work. We\r\nespecially welcome the Council’s growing practice of\r\ndeploying missions to the field, such as the one to\r\nCentral Africa, from 21 to 25 November 2004, to\r\nassess the prospects for peace and stability in the\r\nregion. Furthermore, we commend the briefings on the\r\nhumanitarian situation in Africa by Mr. Jan Egeland,\r\nUnder-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, to\r\nbring to the Council’s attention the challenges in trying\r\nto secure enough resources to help deal with acute\r\nhumanitarian needs in Africa. We appeal to the\r\ninternational community to come forward and\r\ncontribute generously to lessen the burden and\r\nsuffering of people in need in Africa.\r\nWe also commend the public debate on the\r\nAfrican dimension in the work of the Security Council\r\nat the wrap-up meeting held following the more than\r\n20 formal and informal meetings on African issues that\r\nthe Council held during the month of March this year.\r\nMy delegation underscores the need to combine peace\r\nand security efforts with long-term development\r\nstrategies, with a view to moving from the logic of\r\nresolution to one of prevention.\r\nWe welcome the joint efforts by the Economic\r\nand Social Council and the Security Council in that\r\nregard. That is all the more pertinent with the\r\nrecognition of the interconnectedness of threats and\r\nchallenges faced by the international community and\r\nthe need to face them in an integrated fashion, taking\r\ninto account the linkages between development, peace,\r\nsecurity and human rights. We should also emphasize\r\nthe importance of strengthening coordination between\r\nthe United Nations system and regional organizations.\r\nIn that regard, the growing interaction with the African\r\nUnion and the Economic Community of West African\r\nStates should be encouraged further.\r\nMalaysia agrees that holding thematic debates is\r\nuseful in improving the effectiveness of the Council.\r\nWe consider thematic open debates as avenues to allow\r\nCouncil members and the wider membership of the\r\nUnited Nations to offer views and suggestions on\r\nissues directly related to the Council’s work. However,\r\n13\r\nA/60/PV.47\r\nit is still unclear whether the Council has actually fully\r\nconsidered those views when arriving at decisions.\r\nGiven the Council’s increasing workload, we\r\nbelieve that thematic discussions should be kept to a\r\nminimum, and held specifically with a view to\r\nachieving concrete results that have an impact on the\r\nperformance not only of the Council but also the\r\nUnited Nations at large. We continue to believe that\r\nthematic debates and other important issues addressed\r\nby the Council from time to time merit the submission\r\nof special reports to the General Assembly, as provided\r\nfor under Articles 15 and 24 of the Charter and in\r\nkeeping with the intent of Assembly resolution 58/126.\r\nMalaysia has actively participated in thematic\r\ndebates and has been a long-standing proponent of the\r\nCouncil’s addressing the protection of civilians\r\naffected by armed conflict.\r\nRecognizing the importance of gender\r\nmainstreaming in peacekeeping operations, we are\r\nparticularly pleased with the Council’s ongoing\r\nattention to the subject of women and peace and\r\nsecurity. The same is true for the issue of children and\r\narmed conflict, as well as for the need for systematic\r\nand comprehensive monitoring and reporting\r\nmechanisms.\r\nIn the open debate on the role of the Security\r\nCouncil in humanitarian crises, my delegation\r\nexpressed its view that any action aimed at\r\nhumanitarian intervention per se has no basis in the\r\nCharter or in international law. It should therefore be\r\nclear that, while the Security Council has a role to play,\r\nits response should be based on a distinction between\r\ncrises arising out of conflict situations and those\r\nresulting from other causes, including natural disasters.\r\nWhile action to deal with conflict is laudable, it\r\nalso remains the Council’s responsibility to ensure that\r\nconflict is avoided. Hence there is definitely a need to\r\nlearn from past experience and to continue to find ways\r\nand means to avert conflict. The efforts made to hold a\r\ndiscussion on this matter are steps in the right\r\ndirection.\r\nWe recognize that the Council has the\r\nresponsibility to address humanitarian issues that\r\nspecifically relate to situations of conflict and that it\r\nhas taken appropriate action to deal with such\r\nsituations. The Council’s consideration of such issues\r\nhas laid the groundwork for action in the areas of\r\npeacekeeping and peacebuilding and in preventing a\r\nreturn to conflict. We agree that return to conflict often\r\nhinges on whether three key issues in post-conflict\r\nsituations are adequately addressed, and to what\r\nextent — namely the promotion of the rule of law;\r\nsecurity sector reform; and the disarmament,\r\ndemobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants. My\r\ndelegation is supportive of the view that those pillars\r\nof post-conflict security should be further strengthened\r\nin order to achieve long-lasting peace.\r\nMalaysia applauds the Council’s continued\r\ninterest in the Palestinian question as evidenced by the\r\nmonthly briefings and open debates on that matter.\r\nHowever, we are disappointed that the Council failed\r\nto adopt a draft resolution on that issue on 5 October\r\n2004 due to the negative vote of a permanent member\r\nof the Council. Of the 77 vetoes used by that\r\npermanent member of the Security Council, 26 have\r\nbeen cast in an attempt to cripple any tangible\r\ninternational effort in the ongoing Middle East conflict.\r\nMy delegation would recall that only one resolution\r\nwas adopted in that respect by the Council, namely\r\nresolution 1544 (2004) of 19 May 2004, which pertains\r\nto the demolition of Palestinian homes in the Rafah\r\nrefugee camp by Israel, the occupying Power.\r\nWe call on the Security Council to enhance and\r\nmaintain its credibility by asserting its authority\r\nconcerning the Palestinian question, in particular in\r\nrespect of commitment to the road map and to the two-\r\nState solution, the end of the occupation of Palestinian\r\nand Arab territories, the termination of Israel’s settler\r\ncolonialism activities, and the reversal of the\r\nconstruction of the separation wall.\r\nThe Council must not allow its resolutions to be\r\nmanipulated or permit itself to be prevented from\r\ntaking constructive action. The Council must resolutely\r\ntake action concerning the construction of the Israeli\r\nexpansionist separation wall, which has been declared\r\nillegal in the Advisory Opinion issued by the\r\ninternational Court of Justice.\r\nThe suffering of the Palestinian people under the\r\noccupation of Israel has been going on for far too long.\r\nMalaysia hopes that the Council will live up to its\r\ncommitment to continue to support a comprehensive\r\nand just settlement in the Middle East based on\r\nresolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973), 1397 (2002) and\r\n1515 (2003), the foundations of the Madrid\r\nConference, and the principle of land for peace.\r\n14\r\nA/60/PV.47\r\nTurning to agenda item 117, my delegation\r\nwishes to state that we agree with the prevailing view\r\nthat the United Nations, including the Security\r\nCouncil, must be reformed in a comprehensive manner\r\nin terms of both its working methods and the expansion\r\nof its membership, to make it more legitimate,\r\nrepresentative, democratic and transparent. We note the\r\nextensive discussions we have had on this issue over\r\nthe years; however, it is time for us to move on to\r\naction.\r\nIn that regard, we note with interest the non-\r\npaper that has been circulated by a group of countries\r\non improving the working methods of the Security\r\nCouncil. Some of the proposals in the paper are not\r\nnew, but the fact that over the years they have\r\nresurfaced regularly in various non-papers shows that\r\nthey contain elements that Member States view as\r\ncrucial to Security Council reform.\r\nMalaysia has been supportive with respect to the\r\nquestion of enlargement of the Security Council.\r\nMalaysia supports the expansion of both categories of\r\nmembership, based on equitable geographical\r\ndistribution so as to make it more broadly\r\nrepresentative, reflecting the geopolitics of today.\r\nMalaysia wishes once again to reiterate its view\r\nposition that, if there is no agreement on the expansion\r\nin the permanent membership, we should proceed with\r\nexpansion of the non-permanent membership, while\r\nkeeping the issue of the expansion of the permanent\r\nmembership on the active agenda of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe reform should also address the question of\r\nthe veto with a view to eventually doing away with it,\r\nin conformity with the principle of sovereign equality\r\nas envisaged in the Charter. Malaysia continues to\r\nbelieve that the exercise of the veto by the permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council should be regulated\r\nso as to prohibit that power from being used unjustly,\r\nat the sole discretion of the holder, to override the wish\r\nof the majority.\r\nOn 28 April 2005, during the thematic discussion\r\non the Secretary-General’s report entitled “In larger\r\nfreedom”, Malaysia proposed that, until the objective\r\nof abolishing the veto is achieved, there could be a\r\nmodified veto, whereby two veto powers would need\r\nthe backing of three other members of the Security\r\nCouncil in order to block the adoption of a Security\r\nCouncil resolution.\r\nThe Security Council, before taking any decision\r\non issues that requires implementation by Member\r\nStates, should seek the views of the general\r\nmembership. That would allow Member States to voice\r\ntheir opinions and to make comments or suggestions on\r\npotential improvements before a decision is taken. As\r\nwe have seen in the past, some Security Council\r\ndecisions have imposed on Member States a heavy\r\nburden in terms of providing reports, leading to\r\nreporting fatigue.\r\nMr. President, Malaysia will continue to support\r\nand work closely with you, other Members of the\r\nUnited Nations and the Secretary-General to explore\r\nnew ideas and arrive at a fresh outlook with respect to\r\nSecurity Council reform. We already possess the\r\nnecessary tools to advance that process. What is\r\nrequired is the full support and political will of\r\nMember States.\r\nMr. Wali (Nigeria): I have the honour to speak\r\non behalf of the African Group on the agenda item\r\nentitled “Question of equitable representation on and\r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council and\r\nrelated matters”.\r\nMr. President, we wish to express to you our\r\nappreciation for your leadership in the conduct of the\r\nwork of this session as well as for your commitment to\r\nsteering our deliberations towards the actualization of\r\nthe decisions of world leaders as reflected in the\r\noutcome document.\r\nPermit me also to express the sympathy of the\r\nAfrican States Members of the United Nations to the\r\nGovernment and the people of the Hashemite Kingdom\r\nof Jordan in connection with the terrorist attack of\r\nWednesday, 9 November 2005, which claimed many\r\nlives.\r\nAfrica considers the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil as fundamental not solely to the entire reform\r\nprocess of the United Nations, to which we are\r\ncommitted, but also to the realization of the primary\r\nobjective of the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity, in consonance with the provisions of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter. It is in that context that\r\nAfrican leaders at the highest level of Government\r\nadopted, at their Summit in Sirte, Libya, on 5 July\r\n2005, the Sirte Declaration on the Reform of the\r\nUnited Nations, which unambiguously states Africa’s\r\nposition on the matter.\r\n15\r\nA/60/PV.47\r\nI wish to recall that Africa’s contributions to the\r\nvarious processes that led to the September 2005 world\r\nsummit were informed by that position. Africa’s call\r\nfor a comprehensive reform of the Security Council\r\naimed at making it more broadly representative and\r\ntransparent is based on our assessment that such a\r\nreform would enhance the legitimacy of its decisions\r\nand the representativity of its membership.\r\nFor us, such reform should not be limited to\r\nexpanding the Council in the permanent and non-\r\npermanent categories; it should also include improving\r\nthe Council’s working methods to make it more\r\neffective and efficient, strengthening the transparency\r\nof its procedures, improving its functioning and its\r\ndecision-making process and ensuring greater\r\ninvolvement in its work. We therefore consider the\r\npresent session of the General Assembly an historic\r\nopportunity to take decisions that will ensure that\r\nreform of the Security Council leads to its\r\ndemocratization, transparency and accountability.\r\nReform should also enable us to comprehensively\r\nredress the injustice against developing countries,\r\nespecially those in Africa.\r\nAfrica can therefore neither associate itself with\r\nnor support any initiative, however conceived, that\r\nseeks a partial approach to Security Council reform.\r\nSuch an approach, in our assessment, would run\r\ncounter to the decisions of our leaders and to the\r\nwishes of the broad majority of the United Nations\r\nmembership.\r\nI wish to reiterate once again Africa’s call for\r\nSecurity Council reform through equitable\r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of\r\nthe Council. Lest there be any doubt, Africa’s\r\nrepresentation means no fewer than two permanent\r\nseats, with all the prerogatives and privileges attached\r\nthereto, as well as five non-permanent seats. Indeed,\r\nAfrica has a clear position and a clear understanding\r\nregarding what permanent seats would mean and entail\r\nfor the continent. I therefore have the honour to inform\r\nthe Assembly that that position was reaffirmed in the\r\nlatest decision reached by African leaders at their\r\nExtraordinary Summit in Addis Ababa on 31 October\r\n2005.\r\nAfrica is determined to engage with other United\r\nNations Member States outside our region in pursuit of\r\nthat clear position of the African Union. In that\r\nprocess, I wish to assure you, Mr. President, of our\r\ncooperation, mindful of the desire and commitment of\r\nother States to implement the decisions of world\r\nleaders.\r\nMr. Kumalo (South Africa): We welcome the\r\nopportunity to discuss two reports — the report of the\r\nSecurity Council concerning its work during the period\r\n1 August 2004 to 31 July 2005 (A/60/2) and the report\r\nof the Open-ended Working Group on the Question of\r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters\r\nrelated to the Security Council (A/59/47). In that\r\nregard, we align ourselves with the statement made by\r\nthe representative of Nigeria on behalf of the African\r\nGroup. We particularly want to highlight the part of\r\nthat statement expressing Africa’s condolences to our\r\ncolleagues from Jordan and to the Jordanian people\r\nwith regard to the tragic incident that occurred\r\nyesterday in their country.\r\nThe Security Council has a solemn mandate to\r\nmaintain international peace and security, which means\r\nthat it has far-reaching impact on the lives of many\r\npeople throughout the world. That gives urgency to the\r\nefforts to expand and transform the Council into a\r\nmore credible, representative and effective organ.\r\nWe note the ongoing attempts to improve the\r\nworking methods of the Security Council. However, we\r\nwould be more appreciative if those reforms were\r\nmade permanent so that the Council could have\r\npredictable working methods. We are pleased to note\r\nthat the Council is gradually opening up to regional\r\nplayers in its maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity, as demonstrated by the Council meeting in\r\nKenya and the subsequent presidential statement\r\nreaffirming the institutional relationship with the\r\nAfrican Union, as well as by resolution 1631 (2005),\r\non cooperation with regional organizations. We hope\r\nthat that relationship is further strengthened as we\r\ncontinue towards the peaceful resolution of conflicts on\r\nour African continent.\r\nWe are deeply concerned that the conflict in the\r\nMiddle East continues unabated. In our view, the\r\nSecurity Council missed a significant opportunity to\r\nrevive the Middle East peace process, which presented\r\nitself during the past year following the reduction in\r\nthe levels of violence and terrorism and the\r\ndisengagement of the Israeli army from Gaza. We\r\nbelieve that the Council could have seized that\r\nopportunity and acted decisively, rather than passively\r\n16\r\nA/60/PV.47\r\nreceiving routine monthly updates from the Secretariat.\r\nAt the same time, the Council failed to react as Israel\r\naccelerated the construction of illegal settlements on\r\nthe West Bank and continued the construction of the\r\nseparation wall that has altered the demographic\r\ncharacter of the occupied areas.\r\nWe welcome Syria’s compliance with the call to\r\nwithdraw its forces from Lebanon and its commitment\r\nto cooperate with the investigation into the\r\nassassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik\r\nHariri. We wish to encourage the Security Council to\r\nmake a similar call on Israel to withdraw its presence\r\nfrom the occupied Shaba’a Farms and the Syrian Golan\r\nand also to look into the assassinations of numerous\r\nPalestinian leaders in that area.\r\nWe welcome the decision to hold joint public\r\nbriefings by the Chairs of the Counter-Terrorism\r\nCommittee, the Security Council Committee\r\nestablished pursuant to resolution 1540 (2004), the Al-\r\nQaida/Taliban Sanctions Committee, and the Working\r\nGroup established pursuant to resolution 1566 (2004)\r\nas a first step towards rationalizing and consolidating\r\nthe Council’s counter-terrorism programme. However,\r\nit is important that the rest of the membership\r\nparticipate in such debates before the adoption of\r\nimportant resolutions that have an impact on everyone.\r\nWe trust that Member States already struggling to\r\ncatch up with the Security Council’s demands will be\r\nprovided a genuine opportunity to express their views\r\non issues such as the future of the 1540 Committee and\r\nthe review of the performance of the Counter-\r\nTerrorism Executive Directorate. The Council should\r\ntake stock of the effectiveness of its efforts to provide\r\ntechnical assistance to those who require it and should\r\naddress questions related to the transparency and cost-\r\neffectiveness of its work.\r\nAnother area in which improvements could be\r\nmade concerns cooperation between the Security\r\nCouncil and troop-contributing countries. Recent\r\nmeetings between the Council and troop-contributing\r\ncountries have been rather unproductive, adding to the\r\nsense of frustration among those countries, which often\r\nfeel that the Council does not take their operational\r\ndifficulties into account when taking decisions that\r\naffect troop deployments.\r\nIn 1993, the General Assembly, through its\r\nresolution 48/26, established the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation on\r\nand Increase in the Membership of the Security\r\nCouncil and Other Matters related to the Security\r\nCouncil. The Working Group was established because\r\nMember States recognized the need to address\r\nrepresentational equity in the Security Council and to\r\nexamine formulas to increase its membership. It is now\r\nmore than 12 years since Member States began the\r\ndebate on Council reform, and there is still no\r\nagreement because the Working Group has remained\r\ndeadlocked, particularly on the vital issue of Security\r\nCouncil expansion.\r\nAt their September summit, heads of State and\r\nGovernment took a decisive decision by calling for\r\nreform of the Security Council as an essential element\r\nof the overall efforts to reform the United Nations. We\r\nbelieve that that decision has overtaken the deadlocked\r\nnegotiations of the Open-ended Working Group and\r\nthat it has committed Member States to reaching an\r\nearly decision on this matter. As members are aware,\r\nthe General Assembly is required to review progress on\r\nSecurity Council reform by the end of this year.\r\nIt is for that reason that we are pleased by the\r\ndecision of the African Union to reintroduce its\r\nresolution calling for expansion of the Security Council\r\nin both categories. Last week, the extraordinary\r\nsummit of the African Union reaffirmed Africa’s desire\r\nfor two permanent seats and five non-permanent seats\r\non an expanded Security Council, with the new\r\nmembers exercising all the rights and privileges of\r\ncurrent members.\r\nThe President has requested us to give him an\r\nindication as to how to move the process forward.\r\nSouth Africa believes that the broad objective of the\r\nreform should be to create a Security Council that is\r\ntruly representative of the membership and able to\r\nrespond effectively to international crises, as mandated\r\nby the Charter of the United Nations. The reformed\r\nCouncil should represent our collective security\r\nconcerns in an even manner, and should be accountable\r\nto the entire membership of the United Nations. In our\r\nview, Council reform has to equally address both the\r\nenlargement of the Council and the improvement of its\r\nworking methods. Anything less would be papering\r\nover cracks. It is for that reason that my delegation will\r\nhave great difficulty in supporting any approach that\r\naddresses only one element of the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\n17\r\nA/60/PV.47\r\nWe as Member States have the responsibility to\r\nensure that the Security Council remains the universal\r\nrepository of our efforts in the maintenance of peace\r\nand security by taking the bold step to reform it. The\r\ntime has come to arrest the erosion of the Council’s\r\ncredibility and to seek agreement on the composition\r\nand working methods of a reformed Council. Let us\r\ncreate a Security Council that will serve us all in the\r\ncontext of the new geopolitical realities.\r\nMr. Abdelaziz (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): Allow\r\nme to begin by expressing our sympathy and solidarity\r\nwith the Government and people of the Hashemite\r\nKingdom of Jordan over the heinous terrorist attacks\r\nthat occurred in Amman yesterday. They underscore\r\nthe urgent need for a decisive role for the General\r\nAssembly in drafting and implementing a clear and\r\nconcrete plan to combat international terrorism.\r\nWe associate ourselves with the statement made\r\nby the representative of Nigeria on behalf of the\r\nAfrican Group. It emphasized the importance all of us\r\nshould attach to the issue of the reform and\r\nenlargement of the Security Council as a fundamental\r\nand vital part of efforts to reform the United\r\nNations — a concern that was also expressed by heads\r\nof State and Government in the outcome document of\r\nthe High-level Plenary Meeting of the General\r\nAssembly last September (resolution 60/1). Given the\r\nparticular importance that Egypt attaches to that issue,\r\nwe look forward to continuing our collective work in\r\nthe context of transparency and constructive\r\nunderstanding to take practical and tangible steps\r\ntowards enlarging the Security Council and reforming\r\nits methods of work.\r\nI should now like to refer to several points that\r\nreflect Egypt’s views about this vital issue as we move\r\nahead.\r\nFirst, last year produced several important\r\ndevelopments pertaining to the two aspects of the\r\nSecurity Council reform as a result of the momentum\r\nthat accompanied the report of the Secretary-General’s\r\nHigh-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change,\r\nissued in the run-up to the High-level Plenary Meeting.\r\nThose developments have illustrated increasing\r\nAfrican and international conviction that any effort to\r\nreform the Organization should include reform of the\r\nSecurity Council, including enlarging its membership\r\nand reforming its methods of work.\r\nSecondly, the Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase\r\nin the Membership of the Security Council and Other\r\nMatters related to the Security Council has made some\r\nprogress in its efforts to develop clear proposals that\r\ncommand wide consensus with regard to reforming the\r\nCouncil’s methods of work. We note with great\r\nconcern, however, that due to a lack of political will to\r\nmake the necessary breakthroughs in connection with\r\neither of the two aspects of reform, the Working Group\r\ncould not translate that progress into practical\r\nconclusions to enable real reform with regard to\r\nenlarging the Security Council and improving its\r\nmethods of work. We nevertheless believe that it is\r\nimportant that the Working Group continue its work on\r\nreforming the Security Council in both those areas and\r\non negotiating an open and transparent mechanism\r\nthrough which the entire membership can express its\r\nviews on the issue of reform. In requesting the General\r\nAssembly to review the progress made with regard to\r\nCouncil reform, the High-level Plenary Meeting\r\nemphasized the role of the Open-ended Working Group\r\nin reconciling varying points of view on the matter.\r\nThirdly, the intensive consultations carried out\r\nlast year by the General Assembly have underscored\r\nthe Assembly’s determination that any model used to\r\nenlarge the membership of the Security Council should\r\nserve to bolster the participation of developing\r\ncountries and reflect contemporary political realities, in\r\nparticular the historical injustice Africa has suffered as\r\na result of never having been a permanent member of\r\nthe Council or enjoyed the right to the veto.\r\nEnlargement of the Council should also provide for\r\nreasonable representation of all civilizations and\r\ncultures. Despite the many proposals and models that\r\nhave been put forth, none of which has enjoyed wide\r\nconsensus, we should not give up our African and\r\ninternational aspirations, especially with regard to\r\ngiving Africa permanent membership on the Council\r\nand equity and equality vis-à-vis the current permanent\r\nmembers. That must also include granting Africa non-\r\npermanent seats in accordance with the number of\r\nStates on the continent as a proportion of the\r\nOrganization’s total membership.\r\nIn that connection, the most recent extraordinary\r\nsession of the African Union created an African\r\nmechanism to continue to promote and muster support\r\nfor Africa’s position as emphasized in the Sirte\r\nDeclaration and the Ezulwini Consensus, which\r\n18\r\nA/60/PV.47\r\nconstitute an indivisible whole and cannot be addressed\r\nselectively. Africa will seek to mobilize support for its\r\nlegitimate requests on this matter. In that regard, Africa\r\nseeks the support of the entire membership of the\r\nOrganization, especially that of the permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council.\r\nFourthly, with regard to reforming the Security\r\nCouncil’s methods of work, last week we received the\r\ninitiative by five friendly countries that included\r\nimportant ideas that merit our consideration and study.\r\nThe delegation of Egypt will constructively and\r\nsubstantively consider that initiative as part of the\r\noverall effort to reform the Council’s methods of work\r\nand its transparency and to ensure wider participation\r\nof non-members in its work and decision-making\r\nprocesses and in its subsidiary bodies. Reform should\r\nalso ensure the Council’s accountability to the General\r\nAssembly, balance the relationships among the Council\r\nand other principal organs of the United Nations, in\r\naccordance with the provisions of the Charter, and\r\nrationalize the use of the right of veto prior to its\r\nultimate abolition. In that regard, we look forward to\r\ncontinuing consultations on the issue of enlarging the\r\nCouncil in order to grant Africa no less than two\r\npermanent seats with all the prerogatives of permanent\r\nmembership, including the right to the veto, as well as\r\nfive non-permanent seats. As clearly stated by the\r\nrepresentative of Nigeria today, that objective would\r\nguarantee our aspirations as a continent in accordance\r\nwith the resolutions adopted at the last African Union\r\nsummit.\r\nThe consideration of the annual report of the\r\nSecurity Council is closely related to what has been\r\nsaid about the reform of the Council. There is no doubt\r\nthat we need to urgently develop the relationship\r\nbetween the Security Council and the General\r\nAssembly so as to go beyond the routine of an annual\r\nreport which is merely a narrative of the Council’s\r\nactivities and offers no analytical assessment of the\r\nobstacles that impede the effective and full\r\nimplementation of its resolutions or of the methods of\r\ntackling the issues before it.\r\nIn this context, it has become more urgent to have\r\nan increased and developed thematic and institutional\r\ninteraction between the Council and the Assembly so\r\nthat Council activities will not encroach upon issues\r\nbeyond its responsibilities for maintaining peace and\r\nsecurity to include subjects that fall under the proper\r\ncompetence of the General Assembly, such as human\r\nrights, disarmament and international cooperation to\r\ncombat terrorism. This should be done in order to re-\r\nestablish a more balanced relationship between the\r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly, on the one\r\nhand, and the Economic and Social Council on the\r\nother, and to carry out fundamental and genuine reform\r\nof those organs in a manner that makes their action\r\nmore transparent, democratic and accountable. It would\r\nrequire that the General Assembly go beyond its rigid\r\nframework and not follow precedents that have caused\r\nit to lose more of its mandates and capabilities to the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nWe look to you, Mr. President, to lead us in a new\r\ndirection for the General Assembly. For example,\r\ncondemnation, expressions of solidarity and\r\nobservance of minutes of silence or prayer for victims\r\nare not sufficient means for dealing with terrorism. The\r\nAssembly should seek to realize clearer objectives that\r\ngo beyond the adoption of the general protocol to the\r\nadoption of a comprehensive strategy and a clear\r\nworking plan of action, so that it can achieve the\r\nsecurity and stability to which we aspire.\r\nIn view of the amount of time occupied by issues\r\nof peace and security in Africa in the activities and\r\nplans of action of the Council, and in order to benefit\r\nfrom the genuine partnership with the African Union\r\nand other regional African organizations, there is a\r\nneed to expand African representation in the Council’s\r\nmembership. Also, African participation in the\r\nCouncil’s activities should be increased through new\r\nmechanisms that will lead to transparency in its\r\nworking methods. In this respect, we call for the\r\nrevival, activation and expansion of participation in the\r\ntask force that exists within the Council to prevent and\r\nsettle African disputes, taking advantage of the\r\nexperience of the African Union in a manner that\r\nwould achieve the hoped-for results.\r\nMs. Bethel (Bahamas): While the Bahamas\r\naligns itself with the statement made by the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Barbados on behalf of the member\r\nStates of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), we\r\nwish to offer a few additional comments from a\r\nnational perspective.\r\nIn 1945 the nations of the world, fresh from the\r\nhorrors of war, embarked upon one of the greatest\r\nundertakings in international diplomacy — the United\r\nNations. At that time, 51 States decided that the best\r\nchance for sustained peace was to bind together their\r\n19\r\nA/60/PV.47\r\ncommon hopes and aspirations in this world\r\nOrganization based on the principles of international\r\nlaw, international security, economic development and\r\nsocial equity. Today, 60 years later, the nearly universal\r\nmembership of the United Nations, with 191 Member\r\nStates, is a testament to its appeal and indispensability.\r\nAs the sentinel for international peace and\r\nsecurity within the United Nations system, the Security\r\nCouncil has often taken centre stage as we all grapple\r\nwith the challenges brought on by an increasingly\r\ncomplex international order and the attendant\r\nopportunities, obstacles, and threats.\r\nIn compliance with Article 24, paragraph 3, of\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations, we are today\r\nconsidering the annual report of the Security Council\r\nto the General Assembly contained in document\r\nA/60/2, which has been ably presented by Ambassador\r\nDenisov of the Russian Federation. The annual report\r\nhas been the object of much comment over the years,\r\ngiven its potential to be a major point of interaction\r\nbetween these two principal bodies of the\r\nOrganization. This potential takes on great significance\r\nbecause, according to Article 24, paragraph 1, of the\r\nCharter, the Member States of the United Nations\r\n“confer on the Security Council primary responsibility\r\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security,\r\nand agree that in carrying out its duties under this\r\nresponsibility the Security Council acts on their\r\nbehalf”.\r\nInasmuch as the Council acts on behalf of all\r\nUnited Nations Member States in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, and while few would\r\nargue that the report before us is not comprehensive,\r\nmany countries, the Bahamas included, agree that it\r\ncould and should be more substantive and analytical,\r\npresenting a reflective view and assessment of the\r\nCouncil’s activities. It is also in this vein that the\r\nBahamas supports the idea of an interactive exchange\r\nbetween the Council and the General Assembly when\r\nthis report is being considered by the latter.\r\nThe report certainly illustrates the width and\r\nbreadth of the actions undertaken by the Council on\r\nour behalf and reveals a continuous increase in the\r\nvolume and scope of its activities. The greater number\r\nof those activities were, in our view, rightfully geared\r\ntowards bringing resolution to a number of conflict and\r\npost-conflict situations, particularly in Africa. We\r\ncommend the Council for its focus in this area,\r\nespecially in light of the acknowledged nexus between\r\npeace, security and development and the need to ensure\r\nthat Africa makes significant strides towards the\r\nachievement of internationally agreed development\r\ngoals, including the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nThe Bahamas also welcomes the Council’s\r\nsustained focus on our sister Caribbean nation, Haiti,\r\nthrough the activities of the United Nations\r\nStabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), in an\r\neffort to resolve the complexity of challenges\r\nconfronting that country. Thus we note with\r\nsatisfaction the Council’s acknowledgement of “the\r\nimportance of promoting long-term economic\r\ndevelopment alongside security and political stability”\r\nwithin Haiti (A/60/2, p. 11). It is absolutely imperative\r\nthat the international community continue to provide\r\nHaiti with the required assistance and support for its\r\nupcoming elections and beyond.\r\nThe Bahamas also takes a keen interest in the\r\nwork of the Council’s various counter-terrorism bodies,\r\nparticularly their efforts to increase coordination in\r\ntheir respective fields of work, and the provision of\r\ntechnical assistance to States in need. The sometimes\r\nHerculean effort required to implement critical\r\ncounter-terrorism measures adopted by the Security\r\nCouncil, as well as to meet reporting obligations under\r\nvarious resolutions, continues to pose a challenge to\r\nmany States, particularly small States. The Bahamas\r\nwould encourage the Council to continue its efforts to\r\ncoordinate much-needed assistance to States in all\r\naspects of their counter-terrorism obligations in our\r\ncollective fight against this scourge.\r\nAllow me at this juncture to convey the\r\ncondolences of the people and Government of the\r\nBahamas to the people and Government of Jordan on\r\nthe loss of life and destruction caused by the terrorist\r\nbombings in Amman yesterday.\r\nWe acknowledge the service and efforts of the\r\nMember States that are members of the Security\r\nCouncil. We believe it is vital that all Member States\r\nwith the capacity to serve on the Council be given an\r\nopportunity to do so, and therefore we feel that the\r\nexpansion of the Council’s membership is appropriate\r\nand should be given careful and due consideration. A\r\nCouncil that is truly representative of the present world\r\nmust more equitably reflect the current membership of\r\nthe Organization, allowing developing countries,\r\n20\r\nA/60/PV.47\r\nincluding small island developing States, to play a\r\ngreater role in its activities.\r\nExpanding the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil is, however, only one dimension of the reform\r\nthat needs to take place in that body. The other equally\r\nimportant dimension is reform of the Council’s\r\nworking methods. The 2005 World Summit Outcome\r\n(resolution 60/1) acknowledges and speaks to this\r\naspect directly, recommending that the Council\r\ncontinue to adapt its working methods so as to increase\r\nthe involvement of States not members of the Council\r\nin its work, as appropriate, enhance its accountability\r\nto the membership and increase the transparency of its\r\nwork.\r\nIn tandem with the report of the Security Council,\r\nwe are also, appropriately, considering the report of the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on the Question of\r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters\r\nrelated to the Security Council, which is contained in\r\ndocument A/59/47. I had the distinct pleasure of co-\r\nchairing that Working Group, along with Ambassador\r\nChristian Wenaweser of Liechtenstein, during the fifty-\r\nninth session of the General Assembly. During that\r\nperiod, the Working Group’s discussions concentrated\r\non matters related to the working methods of the\r\nSecurity Council, or cluster-II issues, as they are\r\ncommonly called.\r\nAs evidenced by this report of the Working\r\nGroup, many Member States place great emphasis and\r\nimportance on the working methods of the Security\r\nCouncil as a means of making the body more\r\ntransparent, inclusive, accountable and effective. The\r\nBahamas believes that positive contributions to the\r\nwork of the Council could and would be made by many\r\ncountries that would otherwise be kept on the\r\nperiphery or totally excluded if the working methods of\r\nthat body were modified. There is a plethora of\r\nrecommendations and suggestions that have issued\r\nforth from the Open-ended Working Group in this\r\nregard, last year and in preceding years, and we invite\r\nthe Security Council to consider them within a\r\nconstructive and progressive frame of reference.\r\nIn this vein, the Bahamas is heartened by the\r\ndiscussions on working methods that have been\r\ngenerated in the wake of the draft resolution crafted by\r\nthe “Small Five” delegations of Costa Rica, Jordan,\r\nLiechtenstein, Singapore and Switzerland. We\r\ncommend those delegations for this initiative, and we\r\nhope it will lead to a groundswell of dialogue and\r\naction culminating in a positive outcome for all\r\nconcerned. This could be a critical first step in acting\r\non the agreement of the summit in September that early\r\nreform of the Security Council is an essential element\r\nof our overall effort to reform the United Nations.\r\nWe are all familiar with the saying that with great\r\npower comes great responsibility. Nowhere is this old\r\nadage more appropriate than when it comes to the\r\nSecurity Council. We believe that primary among the\r\nCouncil’s responsibilities is that of engaging regularly\r\nand constructively in dialogue with those on whose\r\nbehalf it acts, in an atmosphere of mutual respect and\r\ntrust. It is the sincere hope of my delegation that this\r\ndebate and the ensuing relevant discussions will all\r\ncontribute to that end.\r\nMr. Benmehidi (Algeria)(spoke in French):\r\nAlgeria strongly condemns the hateful terrorist attacks\r\nthat hit Amman yesterday. I wish to convey sincere\r\ncondolences on behalf of the Government and the\r\npeople of Algeria to the Government and the fraternal\r\npeople of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. I would\r\nalso like to convey sincere condolences to the grief-\r\nstricken families of the victims.\r\nI would like to thank Ambassador Andrey\r\nDenisov, the Permanent Representative of the Russian\r\nFederation and President of the Security Council for\r\nthe month of November, for his comprehensive\r\nintroduction of the annual report of the Security\r\nCouncil (A/60/2). The period covered by the report,\r\nfrom August 2004 to July 2005, occurred during\r\nAlgeria’s term as an elected member of the Council.\r\nHence, my delegation would like to draw some lessons\r\nfrom our tenure, particularly relating to the Council’s\r\nworking methods and to the question of equitable\r\nrepresentation on that organ.\r\nAs a non-aligned, African and Arab country,\r\nAlgeria has used its term on the Security Council to\r\nfurther the demands put forward by those three crucial\r\nelements of the Organization and echoed by the\r\noverwhelming majority of Member States:\r\ndemocratization of the Security Council; transparency\r\nin its work; and improvement in its effectiveness\r\npursuant to the prerogatives assigned by the Charter to\r\neach principal organ.\r\nThe report before us attests to an extremely\r\nheavy, dense agenda for the reporting period. We note\r\n21\r\nA/60/PV.47\r\nthat in the main these efforts were focused mainly on\r\nconflicts in Africa, as well as on the Middle East\r\nregion. The large number of conflicts and pre-conflict\r\nsituations has made it essential that the Council draw\r\non all the resources offered by the Charter in the area\r\nof conflict prevention and settlement. Increasingly, the\r\nCouncil, given the multitude of its tasks, has had to\r\nlook outside itself and solicit the support of regional\r\norganizations pursuant to Chapter VIII; that of the\r\nSecretary-General, in his mediating role through his\r\nnetwork of special representatives and personal\r\nenvoys; and that of Member States as influential\r\nregional actors or troop contributors. All of them have\r\na contribution to make in working out a decision.\r\nWithin the Security Council, Algeria has actively\r\nsought to promote that just concept of shared\r\nresponsibility of the members of the international\r\ncommunity for the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security. While this is the primary responsibility of\r\nthe Security Council under the Charter, it is not its\r\nexclusive province. Algeria will continue to work to\r\nstrengthen this trend and will join in the efforts of all\r\nMember States to that end.\r\nWe can already say that there has been —\r\nadmittedly limited — an improvement in the\r\ntransparency of the Council’s work through the\r\nincreased number of public meetings and the improved\r\ndialogue with parties to conflicts and with troop-\r\ncontributing countries.\r\nHowever, this should not blind us to some\r\ndeficiencies, relating to the still excessive use of\r\nChapter VII in situations where the resources of\r\nChapter VI would suffice to achieve the same goal; to a\r\npersistent lack of political will to act on Council\r\ndecisions taken under that very Chapter VII in a fixed\r\nand non-discriminatory way, as continues to be the\r\ncase when it comes to the Middle East; and, finally, to\r\nthe dearth of resources available to the Security\r\nCouncil to provide appropriate responses in post-\r\nconflict and peacebuilding situations. Algeria earnestly\r\nhopes that the proposal to create a Peacebuilding\r\nCommission will objectively take account of the\r\nrespective advantages of the principal organs before a\r\nrushed decision is taken to set up such a body.\r\nIn that light, I turn now to the question of\r\nequitable representation on the Security Council. My\r\ndelegation associates itself fully with the statement\r\nmade by the Permanent Representative of Nigeria on\r\nbehalf of the African Group.\r\nThe world summit held in September\r\ndemonstrated once again the great interest that Member\r\nStates attach to Security Council reform as an essential\r\nelement of the overall reform of the United Nations.\r\nStrong arguments were made for the expansion of the\r\nSecurity Council and for improving its working\r\nmethods in order to make it more representative and\r\nmore effective, and thus, to bolster its legitimacy and\r\nauthority.\r\nWe hope that the question of the reform of the\r\nUnited Nations in general and that of the Security\r\nCouncil in particular will see positive developments as\r\nsoon as possible so as not to lose the momentum that\r\nhas been generated. We hope that such developments\r\nwill put an end to the historical injustice done to the\r\ndeveloping countries, particularly to the developing\r\ncountries of Africa.\r\nMy delegation would like here to reaffirm its\r\ncommitment to the specific proposals on substantive\r\nissues made by countries of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement, reflecting a determination to strengthen the\r\nrepresentativity and effectiveness of the Security\r\nCouncil. Clearly, such Security Council reform is by\r\nnature comprehensive, as it applies both to the\r\nCouncil’s working methods and to its expansion. Here,\r\nwe take note of the laudable efforts of a number of\r\ndelegations to submit a draft resolution on improving\r\nthe working methods of the Security Council. Africa’s\r\napproach to Security Council reform, as set out in last\r\nsession’s draft resolution A/59/L.67, reflects African\r\naspirations as set forth in the Ezulwini Consensus and\r\nas reaffirmed in the Sirte Declaration and at the fifth\r\nExtraordinary Session of the African Union Assembly,\r\nheld in Addis Ababa on 31 October 2005: we aspire to\r\na Security Council that is better adapted to\r\ncontemporary realities.\r\nAfrica requests two permanent seats, with the\r\nsame privileges and prerogatives enjoyed by current\r\npermanent members, including the veto, and five non-\r\npermanent seats. In due course, the African Union will,\r\nin a spirit of solidarity and unity, take a decision on the\r\nmodalities for the apportionment of the seats to which\r\nit is entitled, pursuant to the Sirte Declaration. At the\r\nsame time, we reaffirm our willingness and our desire\r\nto work with all delegations to make progress on\r\nSecurity Council reform. Here, we stress the integral\r\n22\r\nA/60/PV.47\r\nnature of the Sirte Declaration, which allows of no\r\ndeparture from any of its constituent elements.\r\nMr. Al-Najem (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): I wish\r\nat the outset to express Kuwait’s outrage at the terrorist\r\nbombings in three hotels in the Jordanian capital of\r\nAmman and to state our vigorous condemnation of\r\nthose attacks. The bombings were intended to\r\ndestabilize that country and took a heavy toll of\r\ninnocent lives. Kuwait firmly rejects all such terrorist\r\nacts, which contravene all human values and norms. I\r\nconvey our condolences and sympathy to the\r\nGovernment of Jordan and to the families of the\r\nvictims. We wish the injured a speedy recovery.\r\nI thank the President of the Security Council for\r\nthe month of November, Ambassador Andrey Denisov,\r\nPermanent Representative of the Russian Federation,\r\nfor his lucid introduction of the report of the Council to\r\nthe General Assembly (A/60/2). He noted that the\r\nsteady increase in the volume and breadth of the\r\nCouncil’s work has continued over the past year. I also\r\nexpress our great appreciation to the former\r\nChairperson of the Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase\r\nin the Membership of the Security Council and to the\r\ntwo Vice-Chairpersons for their tireless efforts and for\r\nthe excellent manner in which they guided the Group’s\r\ndeliberations.\r\nIt goes without saying that the item before us\r\ntoday is among the most important on the agenda of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. That is clearly reflected in the\r\nintensity of this year’s discussion of the question of\r\nequitable representation on and increase in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council, which has\r\nresulted in the submission of a number of draft\r\nresolutions by like-minded regional groups. The\r\nimportance that Member States attach to the question\r\nof equitable representation on the Council and reform\r\nof the Council’s working methods is reflected also in\r\nthe support of heads of State or Government for speedy\r\nreform of the Council, as expressed in the outcome\r\ndocument of the recent High-level Plenary Meeting\r\n(resolution 60/1), with a view to making the Council\r\nmore representative, efficient, transparent and\r\neffective, and to enhancing its legitimacy, as well as in\r\ntheir commitment to continue working towards an early\r\ndecision on this matter.\r\nIn its deliberations of recent years, the Working\r\nGroup has stressed the urgency of restructuring the\r\nSecurity Council and increasing the transparency of its\r\nworking methods and procedures. Notwithstanding\r\nagreement among Member States on the principle of\r\nreform and change, the Working Group — 12 years\r\nafter its establishment — has yet to agree on the nature\r\nof the changes to be effected. But we cannot disregard\r\nthe progress made in the Group’s deliberations,\r\nparticularly with respect to the procedures and working\r\nmethods of the Security Council. There is near-\r\nconsensus on the proposals for changes that need to be\r\nmade. Indeed, the Council itself has taken the initiative\r\nto introduce new procedures and working methods. We\r\nmust hail these improvements in the Council’s working\r\nmethods. Our appreciation goes to the members of the\r\nCouncil, who regularly brief the broader membership\r\non developments within the Security Council, thus\r\nhelping to increase transparency.\r\nKuwait’s position on this matter is based on the\r\nfollowing principles. Kuwait strongly supports the\r\nreform and revitalization of the organs of the United\r\nNations. This includes the Security Council, which will\r\nthus be enabled to discharge its Charter mandate of the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nSecondly, no change in the composition of the Security\r\nCouncil must affect the efficiency and effectiveness\r\nwith which the Council adopts resolutions in response\r\nto international threats and challenges. Change must\r\nhelp enhance the legitimacy and credibility of Council\r\nresolutions.\r\nWith respect to reforming and improving the\r\nworking methods of the Council and the development\r\nof its relations with other United Nations organs, such\r\nas the General Assembly and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil, we will support any proposal that will\r\nincrease the transparency and clarity of the work of the\r\nCouncil and facilitate the flow of information to and\r\nfrom the United Nations membership at large.\r\nWe emphasize the need to institutionalize the\r\nsteps the Council has taken to improve its working\r\nmethods without awaiting agreement on other issues,\r\nsuch as the Council’s size, composition and decision-\r\nmaking process. Institutionalizing those steps need not\r\nrequire amendment of the Charter.\r\nKuwait supports retention of the mechanism by\r\nwhich non-permanent members of the Security Council\r\nare elected, under Article 23, paragraph 2, of the\r\nCharter. It gives small countries, such as mine, a\r\n23\r\nA/60/PV.47\r\ngreater opportunity to join the Security Council and to\r\ncontribute to its work.\r\nIt is important that the use of the veto be limited\r\nand regulated, including by limiting it to action and\r\nissues under Chapter VII of the Charter.\r\nIn conclusion, it is our hope that we shall soon\r\nreach a consensus satisfactory to all parties and\r\nensuring the smooth, unimpeded conduct of the work\r\nof the Security Council.\r\nMr. Bodini (San Marino): Let me begin by\r\ncondemning the terrorist attacks that recently took\r\nplace in Jordan. The people and the Government of San\r\nMarino present their deepest condolences to the\r\nGovernment and the people of the Hashemite Kingdom\r\nof Jordan and to the families of the victims.\r\nWe, the States Members of the United Nations, have\r\ndebated for many years the enlargement of the Security\r\nCouncil. This year the discussion has been equally\r\ndisappointing for those who, like us, are proposing an\r\nincrease in the membership without new permanent\r\nmembers and for those who are seeking new permanent\r\nmembers.\r\nThe Government and the people of San Marino\r\nbelieve that, in order to find an equitable solution, we\r\nmust first address what lies at the root of the\r\nwidespread discontent with the current system. It is\r\nimportant, for a start, to take notice of the ongoing\r\ndissatisfaction of the elected delegations to the\r\nCouncil, which feel like temporary witnesses with\r\nmarginal influence on the decision-making process.\r\nFurthermore, action by the Council in its present\r\nform has often resulted in the polarization of the\r\ninternational community along political lines. It might\r\nbe wise, in order to reinforce the democratic nature of\r\nthe Council, to reassess the use of the veto power. If\r\nwe do so, a better and more representative system\r\ncould begin to take shape within the Security Council.\r\nMoreover, I wish to point out that, even if a\r\nsystem of 15 delegations is more easily manageable,\r\nwhat matters is not the number of members but the\r\nconstituencies being represented. In fact, in the current\r\nsystem, small and medium-sized countries are not\r\nreally represented in a consistent way. The common\r\ngoal of achieving peace and security should be the\r\nguiding principle uniting countries seeking\r\nrepresentation within the Council. Since demographic\r\nlandscapes and political and economic interests are\r\nconstantly changing, a larger non-permanent\r\nmembership would make the Council truly\r\nrepresentative of all the different realities of an\r\nevolving world.\r\nIt is also of paramount importance that we\r\nimmediately initiate a serious debate on the working\r\nmethods of the Council and on its transparency, which\r\nwould encourage active participation by, and an\r\nexchange of ideas among, the elected members and\r\nthose that voted for them.\r\nOn that subject, San Marino is sympathetic to the\r\ninformal paper prepared by Costa Rica, Jordan,\r\nLiechtenstein, Singapore and Switzerland.\r\nWe believe that any decision on a final reform of\r\nthe Council should be legitimized by consensus among\r\nMember States.\r\nFinally, we encourage all Members to engage in\r\nan introspective analysis on this thorny issue and to\r\ntake a definitive and bold decision, within a reasonable\r\ntime-frame, so that a truly democratic evolution of the\r\nSecurity Council can take place that will benefit all of\r\nus. The whole world is waiting for a reform of the\r\nCouncil. We cannot fail.\r\nMr. Morote (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): Before I\r\nbegin my statement, I should like, on behalf of the\r\nGovernment and the people of Peru, to express our\r\nheartfelt sympathy to the Government and the people\r\nof Jordan in connection with the human losses suffered\r\ndue to the horrendous and appalling terrorist attack that\r\ntook place in Amman.\r\nI should like to thank the Ambassador of the\r\nRussian Federation, Andrey Denisov, for having\r\nintroduced the report of the Security Council. Let me\r\nalso express my delegation’s appreciation for the work\r\nof the former President of the General Assembly,\r\nMr. Jean Ping, as well as to the ambassadors of\r\nLiechtenstein and of the Bahamas for having\r\ncoordinated the work of the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup on the question of equitable representation on\r\nand increase in the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nFollowing a 10-year period of paralysis, the first\r\nhalf of this year witnessed an unprecedented impetus in\r\nthe process of Security Council reform. Indeed, the\r\nSecretary-General, in his report entitled “In larger\r\nfreedom”, had proposed that a decision, by consensus\r\nor otherwise, be taken on the Council’s membership\r\n24\r\nA/60/PV.47\r\nbefore the September summit. However, nothing\r\nhappened. The Council was not reformed, and efforts\r\nin that direction led to naught.\r\nWhy has the Council remained unchanged? The\r\nanswer is simple: because what is at stake is the way in\r\nwhich world power is distributed. If we look back at\r\nhistory, it is clear that the distribution of world power\r\nhas shifted only following major geopolitical disasters,\r\nwars, the overextension of empires, or economic and\r\ntechnological decline.\r\nIt is a historical fact that the existence of Powers\r\nwith a global reach and the capacity to create a new\r\nworld order is not due to any majority decision on the\r\npart of States. International power is seldom shared; it\r\nis almost always won or lost.\r\nThat lack of pragmatism in the approach to, and\r\nmethodology for, reform of the Security Council has\r\nprobably been the main obstacle to the success of\r\nreform efforts. The plain truth is that the United\r\nNations can function only on the basis of a realistic\r\nvaluation of power. In addition, failure to adopt the\r\nappropriate political methodology would cause great\r\nharm to the United Nations, making it appear unable to\r\nreform itself and thus inviting criticism by its enemies.\r\nAny reform of the Security Council must begin\r\nwith a minimum degree of consensus among the\r\ncurrent permanent members and be followed by a\r\nbroad-based, democratic dialogue among all States. We\r\nmust begin, at the very least, with a minimum formula\r\nthat will not be vetoed. It is not realistic to believe that\r\nany new permanent Security Council members could\r\nbe elected by the General Assembly in the absence of a\r\nbasic agreement among current permanent members,\r\nbecause, whatever the outcome, such an agreement is a\r\nrequirement under the Charter, which was adopted by\r\nus all.\r\nHaving noted the lack of pragmatism in the\r\nprocess of Security Council reform, I should like to\r\nmake it clear that Peru favours such a reform.\r\nAlthough my delegation is critical of the unrealistic\r\nmethodology used, we support expansion of the\r\nSecurity Council by means of a broad consensus. In\r\nthat connection, we support Brazil, inter alia, as a\r\npotential permanent member.\r\nI cannot fail to note, in commenting on the\r\nunrealistic approach taken to Security Council reform,\r\nthat it is one of the reasons we lost a lot of time —\r\ntime that should have been devoted to elaborating, in\r\nthe context of the final document of the summit, an\r\neffective plan of action for achieving the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, particularly given the fact that the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme’s forthright\r\n2005 Human Development Report stated that the Goals\r\nwere not being met and requested that decisive action\r\nbe taken. The outcome was disappointing. The final\r\ndocument of the summit, negotiated against the clock,\r\ndid not include a plan of action to achieve the\r\nMillennium Goals.\r\nReform of the Security Council also implies\r\nenhancing its effectiveness and transparency and\r\nimproving its working methods. What is important is\r\nthat consultations be held with non-permanent\r\nmembers prior to the adoption of decisions by the\r\nCouncil and that such decisions not simply be\r\npresented, as is often the case, as a fait accompli. We\r\nmust also give non-member States an opportunity to\r\nparticipate by enhancing consultation mechanisms\r\nwhen issues are discussed that are of direct interest to\r\nthem.\r\nWorking documents of the Council must be more\r\naccessible, as many elements contained therein affect\r\nall States Members of the United Nations. All\r\ndelegations must have the right to access working\r\ndocuments and draft resolutions as soon as the latter\r\nhave been considered by the Council.\r\nThe best means of enhancing the transparency of\r\nthe Council’s work is to minimize the number of closed\r\nmeetings while increasing the number of open\r\nmeetings, like those held in the early days of the\r\nSecurity Council. The Council must be more public,\r\nnot only to gain the confidence of non-member\r\ncountries, but also to gain the confidence of world\r\npublic opinion. The world must know that there is a\r\nbody that protects peace and security.\r\nToday, the Council, with its secrecy, is going in\r\nthe opposite direction from the dizzying developments\r\nin telecommunications and from the rising global\r\nawareness that all nations belong to a single humanity.\r\nThe Council must abandon secret diplomacy and\r\nbecome an organ that practises public diplomacy. Only\r\nthus will the Security Council and the United Nations\r\nmake themselves understood and gain prestige in\r\nglobal public opinion.\r\nAnother way to improve the functioning of the\r\nSecurity Council is to make it effective in addressing\r\ncrimes against humanity. Nothing discredits the\r\n25\r\nA/60/PV.47\r\nSecurity Council and the United Nations more than\r\ninertia in the face of ethnic cleansing, massive human\r\nrights violations and genocide. To improve the\r\nCouncil’s functioning with regard to crimes against\r\nhumanity, the five permanent Council members should\r\nreach a gentlemen’s agreement not to use the veto\r\nwhen the United Nations Secretary-General or regional\r\norganizations request Council action to prevent or\r\navoid crimes against humanity, massive human rights\r\nviolations, genocide or ethnic cleansing. The idea is\r\nthat permanent Council members should cooperate to\r\nsave thousands of human lives.\r\nAnother valuable improvement in the working\r\nmethods would be to step up field visits, particularly in\r\norder to understand civil conflicts. Such visits should\r\nbe improved through effective and ongoing contacts\r\nwith civil society, political and religious groups and\r\nstaff of the United Nations Development Programme,\r\nthe World Bank and regional organizations familiar\r\nwith the socio-political situation of the country visited.\r\nMoreover, field visits should be carried out not only\r\nwhen a conflict has already erupted, but when there is a\r\nthreat of civil war or massive human rights violations\r\njeopardizing international peace and security — that is,\r\nthey should also be preventive.\r\nThe Council must not only continue to put out\r\nfires when it comes to civil conflicts; it must also\r\nanalyse in depth the structural causes of such conflicts.\r\nToday, all strategic analyses agree that social exclusion\r\nexacerbates cultural, ethnic and religious rivalries,\r\nturning them into wars of national plundering in which\r\nthe most heinous crimes against humanity are\r\ncommitted. Therefore field visits must be adequately\r\nprepared, particularly to obtain information about the\r\ndegree of social exclusion in a country prone to or\r\nimmersed in civil war. If the Council does not take into\r\naccount the degree of social exclusion, it will not be\r\nable to prevent or resolve civil conflicts, because it\r\nwould be disregarding the most important structural\r\nvariable of current global violence.\r\nConcerning the Council’s working methods, my\r\ndelegation welcomes the initiative of Switzerland and a\r\ngroup of countries to improve them.\r\nPeru appreciates the efforts to improve the reports\r\nof the Security Council. However, the report continues\r\nto be descriptive; it is not sufficiently analytical and\r\nforward-looking. It does not evaluate current\r\ndifficulties, progress, failures and trends encountered\r\nin the resolution of conflicts that threaten international\r\npeace and security.\r\nIf the report of the Security Council is not\r\nanalytical and forward-looking, no one will be able to\r\nknow whether the conflicts have diminished or\r\nincreased; whether the stability of Africa, the Balkans,\r\nthe Caucasus, Central Asia or Latin America has\r\nimproved or is still precarious; how much stability\r\nthere is in the Middle East and Iraq; what is happening\r\nin Kosovo; or why the situation in Darfur is not being\r\nresolved.\r\nIf the present report of the Security Council were\r\nread today by journalists, students of international\r\nrelations or the general public, none of them would\r\nobtain clear and analytical information about the status\r\nof the conflicts threatening peace and security\r\nthroughout the world. It is therefore necessary to\r\nprepare a report of the Security Council that has the\r\nmerit of being understood by international public\r\nopinion so that it can be disseminated by the global\r\nmedia and can be discussed in international academic\r\ncircles. The Human Development Report and the\r\nWorld Development Report of the World Bank are\r\nknown urbi et orbi, but today I can say, without\r\nexaggerating, that no one is familiar with reports of the\r\nSecurity Council except us.\r\nWe need a report that connects the Security\r\nCouncil not only to the General Assembly but to all of\r\nhumanity. Thus, not only the Council’s efforts on\r\nbehalf of peace, but also its limitations, would be\r\nwidely known. That would provide realism and serve\r\nto eliminate the misperceptions that exist about the\r\nwork of the United Nations.\r\nAll of these points — which the Peruvian\r\ndelegation has made in order to improve the reform of\r\nthe Council, the effectiveness of its work and the\r\nnature of its reports — reflect Peru’s deep commitment\r\nto international peace and security. We hope that, as a\r\nnon-permanent member of the Security Council during\r\nthe period 2006-2007, we can make a contribution in\r\nthat regard.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President: I should like to inform members\r\nthat, as its second item on Monday morning,\r\n14 November, the Assembly will resume its\r\nconsideration of agenda item 42, entitled “Global\r\nAgenda for Dialogue among Civilizations”, to consider\r\ndraft resolution A/60/L.17.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1 p.m.\r\n"
