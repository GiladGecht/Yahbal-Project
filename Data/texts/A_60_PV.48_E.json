"United Nations A/60/PV.48\r\n \r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixtieth session\r\n48th plenary meeting\r\nThursday, 10 November 2005, 3 p.m.\r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the interpretation of\r\nspeeches delivered in the other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original\r\nlanguages only. They should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature\r\nof a member of the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room\r\nC-154A. Corrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\r\n05-59953 (E)\r\n*0559953*\r\nPresident: Mr. Eliasson . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Sweden)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Diarra\r\n(Mali), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAgenda items 9 and 117 (continued)\r\nReport of the Security Council (A/60/2)\r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and increase\r\nin the membership of the Security Council and\r\nrelated matters\r\nMr. Le Luong Minh (Viet Nam): It is my great\r\nhonour to participate on behalf of the Vietnamese\r\ndelegation in the joint debate today on two important\r\nagenda items relating to the report of the Security\r\nCouncil and the question of equitable representation on\r\nand increase in the membership of the Council and\r\nother related matters.\r\nThe past year has been another year of hard work\r\nfor the Council, as reflected in the great number of\r\nmeetings and the wide range of complex and urgent\r\nissues it has had to tackle. We commend the members\r\nof the Council for their efforts.\r\nAs described in the Security Council’s report to\r\nthe General Assembly, about 50 per cent of the\r\nCouncil’s work this year was dedicated to Africa,\r\nwhich continues to draw the special attention of the\r\nCouncil and of the international community as a whole.\r\nIn this regard, we share the common view of Member\r\nStates that the Council should continue to give African\r\nissues careful and particular attention, in order to make\r\nsolid contributions to resolving African conflicts.\r\nTerrorism is also a matter of top priority for the\r\nCouncil. The surge of terrorist attacks during the past\r\nyear — the latest one taking place just last night in\r\nJordan, resulting in more than 60 deaths and nearly 200\r\ninjuries — has proved that terrorism continues to be\r\none of the most dangerous threats to international\r\npeace and security. We would like to convey to the\r\nGovernment and people of Jordan and the families of\r\nthe victims our most profound sympathy.\r\nWe note with satisfaction the Council’s\r\ncontinuous efforts to address this threat, and we\r\nwelcome the strengthened cooperation among the\r\nCouncil’s relevant subsidiary organs, including the\r\nCounter-Terrorism Committee, the 1267 Committee\r\nand the 1540 Committee. Viet Nam strongly condemns\r\nall acts of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,\r\nand we look forward to strengthening our cooperation\r\nwith the Council in this connection.\r\nWith regard to the report’s format, we appreciate\r\nefforts made with a view to providing a concise guide\r\nto the activities of the Council. Nevertheless, we share\r\nthe view held by many Member States that the report is\r\nstill far from substantive in content and lacks an\r\nassessment of the Council’s work.\r\nTurning to the issue of Security Council reform,\r\nmy delegation acknowledges that there have been some\r\npositive changes in the working methods of the\r\n2\r\nA/60/PV.48\r\nCouncil, such as the increased use of public meetings,\r\nconsultations with regional organizations and\r\nstrengthened coordination among the Council’s\r\nsubsidiary bodies. We hope this momentum will\r\ncontinue, with a view to ensuring the genuine\r\ndemocracy, transparency and accountability of its\r\nwork, thus turning the Council into a body able to\r\neffectively perform its functions of maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nIn this regard, we take note of the report of the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on the Question of\r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters\r\nrelated to the Security Council, contained in document\r\nA/59/47. While acknowledging certain progress, the\r\nreport did point out that there were still varying views\r\nwith regard to the six issues concerning the working\r\nmethods of the Council and the transparency of its\r\nwork that the Open-ended Working Group dealt with\r\nduring the past year.\r\nWe also take note of the proposals on the working\r\nmethods of the Council put forward just recently by the\r\ndelegations of Costa Rica, Liechtenstein, Jordan,\r\nSingapore and Switzerland. These proposals deserve\r\nour careful examination. Though they are new, a quick\r\nreview enables us to say that we can support many of\r\nthem. Moreover, the interest of Member States in\r\nmoving the process forward should be welcomed.\r\nWe share the view that the enlargement and\r\nworking methods of the Council can be better served if\r\nthey are dealt with in parallel and complementary\r\nprocesses. Over the past year, Member States have\r\ndiscussed intensively and substantially possibilities for\r\nthe expansion of the Council. For our part, we wish to\r\nreiterate our position that the Council needs to be\r\nenlarged in both membership categories to ensure that\r\nit truly represents all United Nations Members, as\r\nstipulated in the Charter. We believe that developing\r\nStates should be more adequately represented in this\r\nimportant organ of the Organization. We acknowledge\r\nthat different views remain in this connection. We look\r\nforward to working with other delegations to arrive at a\r\nsolution that enjoys the support of a broad majority of\r\nMember States.\r\nViet Nam attaches great importance to the work\r\nof the Security Council and has proposed its\r\ncandidature for a non-permanent seat on the Council\r\nfor the term 2008-2009. Not forgetting that reform of\r\nthe Council is part of the United Nations reform\r\nprocess as a whole — in which revitalization of the\r\nwork of the General Assembly and reform of other\r\nbodies of the United Nations, especially the Economic\r\nand Social Council, are of equal importance — we\r\nconsider success in reforming the Council critical not\r\nonly for the effectiveness of its work in maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security, but also for the\r\nsuccess of the United Nations reform process as well.\r\nThis approach will continue to guide our actions.\r\nMr. Wang Guangya (China) (spoke in Chinese):\r\nFirst of all, I wish on behalf of the Chinese\r\nGovernment and people to express our condolences to\r\nthe victims of the terrorist attack in Jordan. We also\r\nstrongly condemn this attack.\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations entrusts the\r\nSecurity Council with the primary responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of world peace and security. Since the\r\nbeginning of this year, the Security Council, in its\r\ncontinuous commitment to respond to conventional and\r\nnon-conventional security issues, has made great\r\nefforts in such areas as conflict prevention, dispute\r\nsettlement, peace restoration, counter-terrorism and\r\nnon-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. An\r\neffective, accountable and representative Security\r\nCouncil is in the common interests of all United\r\nNations Member States. Adhering to multilateralism,\r\nstrengthening the role of the United Nations and\r\nsafeguarding the authority of the Security Council can\r\nhelp countries cope effectively with increasingly\r\ncomplex global threats and challenges.\r\nAt September’s world summit, Chinese President\r\nHu Jintao made a comprehensive enunciation of\r\nChina’s position on Security Council reform. I wish to\r\nreiterate here China’s support for necessary and\r\nrational reform of the Council, including its expansion\r\nand improvement of its working methods, in order to\r\nmaintain its authority, increase its efficiency and\r\nstrengthen its role.\r\nDemocratization of international relations is a\r\nglobal trend, which should also be reflected in the\r\nSecurity Council. While developing countries account\r\nfor more than two thirds of the entire United Nations\r\nmembership, they are seriously underrepresented in the\r\nSecurity Council. China holds that expansion of the\r\nCouncil should give priority to augmenting the\r\nrepresentation of developing countries in general and\r\nAfrican countries in particular, and should increase the\r\n3\r\nA/60/PV.48\r\nopportunities for more countries, particularly small and\r\nmedium-sized countries, to participate in the Council’s\r\ndecision-making process.\r\nIn expanding the Council, it is imperative to\r\nadhere to the principle of equitable geographical\r\ndistribution and ensure the representation of different\r\ncultures and civilizations.\r\nNecessary and appropriate improvement should\r\nbe made to the Council’s working methods so that the\r\ncreative ideas and constructive proposals from non-\r\nCouncil members and regional organizations, as well\r\nas from civil society, can be fully reflected. In recent\r\nyears, quite a number of countries have come up with\r\nmany positive suggestions and options in this respect,\r\nand the Council has made headway in its actual work.\r\nChina is ready to continue to work with other members\r\nof the Council to this end.\r\nSecurity Council reform is an issue of great\r\nsensitivity and complexity, as it bears on the national\r\ninterests of all Member States. Over the past few\r\nmonths, China has been vigorously advocating and\r\nurging Council reform in an appropriate and healthy\r\ndirection. We stand by the following principles.\r\nFirst, Council reform should be based on\r\ndemocratic discussion, with a view to reaching the\r\nbroadest possible consensus. No artificial deadline\r\nshould be set, nor should a vote be imposed. Only\r\nwhen this approach is followed can the relevant\r\ndecisions command the widest possible trust and\r\nsupport and meet the common long-term interests of all\r\nMember States. A reform package that addresses the\r\nconcerns of only a few States while disregarding those\r\nof the majority, and that treats African and other\r\ndeveloping countries inequitably, will lead nowhere.\r\nSecondly, reform should reflect the spirit of\r\nmutual compromise and maintain our solidarity. As a\r\nbig family with 191 members, the United Nations\r\nderives its strength from unity. To date, Member States\r\nhave yet to find a Council expansion formula that can\r\nmeet the concerns of all parties and enjoy universal\r\nsupport. Naturally, all parties should, therefore,\r\ncontinue the dialogue and engage in full consultations\r\nin search of compromise. As long as all concerned take\r\nto heart the unity and long-term interests of the United\r\nNations, accommodate each other’s interests and\r\nconcerns and display a pragmatic and flexible\r\napproach, a universally acceptable solution to reform\r\nwill eventually be found.\r\nThirdly, the reform should be a gradual process in\r\nwhich the interests of overall United Nations reform\r\nshould be kept in mind. Security Council reform is part\r\nand parcel of United Nations reform as a whole —\r\nreforms in other areas being of equal importance.\r\nDiscussion over the Council’s expansion in the run-up\r\nto the September summit consumed a great deal of the\r\nenergy and time of all Member States. Consequently,\r\nconsultations on comprehensive United Nations reform\r\nand on the outcome document were severely hampered.\r\nWe must draw lessons from this and prevent its\r\nrecurrence in the follow-up to the Summit Outcome\r\n(resolution 60/1) and in promoting United Nations\r\nreform.\r\nThis year marks the sixtieth anniversary of the\r\nfounding of the United Nations. At the September\r\nsummit, world leaders made solemn pledges and took\r\nimportant decisions on United Nations reform. The\r\ncurrent General Assembly session should advance the\r\nreform process and strengthen the role of the United\r\nNations. China is ready to actively support and\r\ncooperate with the work of the President of the General\r\nAssembly and contribute to the implementation of the\r\nsummit outcome document.\r\nMr. Bolton (United States of America): I\r\nwelcome the opportunity to participate in the\r\ndiscussion on reform and expansion of the Security\r\nCouncil. I hope our review of the issue today, as called\r\nfor in paragraph 153 of the outcome document\r\n(resolution 60/1), contributes to an agreement on an\r\napproach that builds broad support among Member\r\nStates.\r\nThe United States strongly believes in the\r\nSecurity Council. We will continue to ensure that the\r\nCouncil is able to carry out its mandate under the\r\nCharter. In discussing the Council’s structure and\r\nmethods, our foremost priority remains ensuring its\r\neffectiveness.\r\nI would like to express my appreciation to\r\nPresident Eliasson for his outstanding leadership of\r\nthis historic effort to implement the key reforms\r\nendorsed in the outcome document. I thank my friend\r\nand colleague from the Russian Federation, the current\r\nPresident of the Council, for his comments on the work\r\nof the Security Council over the past year. Ambassador\r\nDenisov’s report highlights the need for a Council able\r\nto meet the challenges of a world in which conflict\r\nwithin borders, across borders and — too often —\r\n4\r\nA/60/PV.48\r\nwithout borders threatens the peace, security and\r\nfreedom of people everywhere.\r\nIn recent weeks, the Council has acted on a\r\nnumber of critical issues affecting international peace\r\nand security, including Syria, Iraq and the Horn of\r\nAfrica. I believe there is much for the Council to do to\r\nbring an end to long-running conflicts. As we have\r\nadvocated in the Council, the collective efforts of this\r\nOrganization need to focus on resolving the underlying\r\ndisputes that fuel these conflicts, working closely with\r\nMember States, regional organizations, the private\r\nsector and other international bodies.\r\nI mention a few of the vital issues before the\r\nSecurity Council today to emphasize a point.\r\nDiscussions of reform and expansion of the Council\r\nmust emphasize the need to strengthen — not\r\nweaken — the Council’s ability to act.\r\nThe Security Council has under way a\r\ncomprehensive review of its working methods and\r\nprocedures and continues to take important steps to\r\nimprove its efficiency. We believe that, as clearly\r\nstated in the Charter, the Security Council alone will\r\ndetermine its own working methods and procedures.\r\nTo that end, however, we fully welcome ideas and\r\ncontributions from other Member States. The United\r\nStates will continue to be a full participant in the Open-\r\nended Working Group. Based on the work of this\r\nGroup, the Council has already developed a series of\r\nprocedures and practices to provide increased access\r\nand information on items being considered by the\r\nCouncil, including through briefings, Journal notices\r\nand the use of new information technology.\r\nThe Council will continue to engage with other\r\nMember States on issues such as conflict prevention\r\nand resolution, including through use of Arria-style\r\nmeetings, contacts during Council missions and other\r\nactivities.\r\nThe Council’s sanctions committees will also\r\ncontinue their engagement with other Member States,\r\nincluding neighbouring countries, to inform the\r\nCouncil’s work and support the full implementation of\r\nCouncil resolutions.\r\nJust as the United States supports reform here in\r\nthe General Assembly, we will lead by example by\r\ncontinuing reform in the Council, consistent with the\r\npowers and principles laid out in the United Nations\r\nCharter.\r\nThe United States supports an expansion of the\r\nSecurity Council that can contribute to its strength and\r\neffectiveness, and is open to various options to realize\r\nsuch a reform. Earlier this year, the United States made\r\na specific proposal for a modest expansion of the\r\nCouncil by adding a combination of permanent and\r\nnon-permanent members. We stand by that proposal\r\nand are open to suggestions of other countries.\r\nAs Secretary Rice has said, “We want that\r\nimportant body to reflect the world as it is in 2005, not\r\nas it was in 1945” (A/60/PV.9, p. 9). We must also\r\nensure that new permanent members are supremely\r\nqualified to undertake the tremendous duties and\r\nresponsibilities they will assume. In our view, qualified\r\nnations should meet criteria in the following areas: size\r\nof economy and population, military capacity,\r\ncontributions to peacekeeping operations, commitment\r\nto democracy and human rights, financial contributions\r\nto the United Nations, non-proliferation and counter-\r\nterrorism records, and equitable geographic balance.\r\nWe have long supported a permanent seat for\r\nJapan. We hope very much that Japan will be able to\r\ntake a permanent seat at the earliest possible\r\nopportunity. And we believe that developing countries\r\ndeserve greater representation on this body. As I have\r\nalready noted, particular emphasis should be placed on\r\ncriteria for membership. And those Member States that\r\nmost clearly meet those criteria should be allowed to\r\nserve on the Council, even where there is a\r\ndisagreement over other candidates.\r\nThe United States is prepared to engage fully in\r\nan effort to find a proposal that allows for agreement\r\non expansion of the Council. However, too large an\r\nexpansion would risk making it unable to quickly\r\naddress challenges to international peace and security.\r\nHowever, we will not support a return to any of the\r\nthree proposals introduced at the fifty-ninth session of\r\nthe General Assembly. Simply put, in those past\r\nattempts we bit off more than we could chew. The\r\ndebate in the Hall in July only highlighted deep\r\ndivisions among Member States and paralysed the\r\noverall reform effort. We believe it would be a mistake\r\nto return to that discussion.\r\nBecause Security Council expansion requires\r\namendment of the Charter — which requires approval\r\nby two thirds of the membership and by the five\r\ncurrent permanent members, in accordance with their\r\nown respective constitutional procedures — we need to\r\n5\r\nA/60/PV.48\r\nprepare the way carefully to ensure that whatever\r\napproach we adopt can and will gain the requisite\r\nsupport of Member States during the ratification\r\nprocess. It is important that any proposal contribute to\r\nthe effectiveness of the Security Council. Proposals\r\nthat do not command the breadth of support necessary\r\nto be put into practice should be reconsidered.\r\nThe United States takes its responsibilities as a\r\npermanent member of the Security Council very\r\nseriously. History has shown that the Council, working\r\ntogether and with the full cooperation of all Member\r\nStates, can reverse aggression, contribute to the\r\nexpansion of freedom and maintain peace and security\r\nfor the benefit of us all.\r\nMr. Menon (Singapore): It is a pity that the\r\nprocess to reform the Security Council has stalled. On\r\nthe Council’s expansion, except on the question of the\r\nveto, Singapore supports the lapsed draft resolution of\r\nthe G-4. The G-4 proposal to expand the number of\r\nboth permanent and non-permanent seats, which should\r\ninclude developed and developing countries, was a\r\nmissed opportunity, as that would have updated the\r\nCouncil’s membership and made it more representative\r\nof current-day realities. However, the regrettable\r\ninability to make progress in the area of expansion\r\nshould not inhibit progress in other areas of United\r\nNations reform.\r\nThe rationale of the right of the veto was born of\r\na different era. It was a privilege and a safety valve\r\nconferred on the five victorious Powers in the Second\r\nWorld War to secure their participation in the United\r\nNations, and hence ensure its success and viability.\r\nSixty years on, Singapore opposes granting the veto to\r\nany new permanent members. Extending the veto to\r\nmore countries would be a mistake, because it will\r\ncomplicate decision-making in the Council and\r\nundermine the credibility, efficiency and effectiveness\r\nof the United Nations. That would encourage the major\r\nPowers to bypass it and would undermine the Council,\r\nto the detriment of all.\r\nIt is unrealistic to expect the five permanent\r\nmembers to give up their right to the veto. At the same\r\ntime, they are clearly conscious of that fact. They\r\nshould be commended for sharply reducing their use of\r\nthe veto in recent years. We should focus on feasible\r\nsteps to improve the Security Council’s transparency,\r\naccountability, efficiency and effectiveness. It is in all\r\ncountries’ interests, including the interests of the\r\npermanent members, that the Council’s efficiency and\r\neffectiveness be enhanced. To that end, the open\r\ndebates on the Council’s work — for instance, on\r\nterrorism — Council meetings with troop-contributing\r\ncountries and innovations such as Arria-formula\r\nmeetings are useful and welcome. However, a lot more\r\ncan be done. Greater transparency and accountability in\r\nthe Council’s working methods would accord Council\r\ndecisions greater moral and political authority beyond\r\nwhat is legally conferred by virtue of the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nWith regard to transparency and accountability,\r\nthis is usually the time of year when many corporations\r\nand organizations begin to do their stock-taking, not\r\nonly of the state of their assets but also of their\r\nperformances over the past year, as they think ahead\r\nabout their plans for the next year and for the future\r\nbeyond that. Most institutions take great pride in\r\npreparing their annual reports, which comes out of\r\nsuch stock-taking.\r\nIn that regard, we have before us the report of the\r\nSecurity Council (A/60/2), submitted in accordance\r\nwith Article 24, paragraph 3, of the Charter. However,\r\nin looking at the report, my delegation regrets that the\r\nCouncil has once again wasted an opportunity to do an\r\nanalytical review of its own work and performance.\r\nThis year’s report has reverted to the old style of\r\nreporting and is bereft of analytical content. My\r\ndelegation also notes that the Council, in adopting that\r\nreport, no longer discusses its contents or the Council’s\r\nwork performance.\r\nMy delegation does not pretend that it is easy to\r\nassess the work and performance of the Security\r\nCouncil. The Council’s work is, of necessity, highly\r\npolitical. Since the end of the cold war it has also\r\nbecome extremely complex. It ranges from dispatching\r\nmilitary operations and deploying election monitors to\r\nmandating arms inspections, imposing various kinds of\r\nsanctions on recalcitrant States, entities and\r\nindividuals, establishing international criminal\r\ntribunals and commissions of inquiry, and requiring\r\nStates to take various measures to counter terrorism\r\nand to report on the implementation of such measures.\r\nThe legitimacy of the Council’s imposing on States and\r\nindividuals such a broad range of measures and\r\nrequirements is often questioned these days.\r\nLegitimacy is an intangible thing that is hard to define,\r\nbut we all know how important it is, because if an\r\ninstitution is perceived to lack legitimacy, then it\r\n6\r\nA/60/PV.48\r\nwould cease to enjoy the support or consent of those\r\naffected by it. The Security Council is no exception. It\r\nneeds to uphold, and be seen to be upholding,\r\nstandards of fairness and justice in all its decision-\r\nmaking and actions, which should be legally justifiable\r\nin the context of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nThe decisions made by the Council also need to\r\nbe acceptable to Member States and the international\r\ncommunity at large, in order for the Council to retain\r\nits legitimacy. As former Secretary-General Javier\r\nPérez de Cuéllar once noted, “The greater the Power,\r\nthe higher is [its] responsibility to act and to be seen to\r\nact with justice” (A/45/1, p. 17). The Council can make\r\nthe best possible decisions, but if those decisions are\r\ntaken in exclusivity or if the Council fails or is unable\r\nto explain the rationale behind them to the general\r\nmembership of the United Nations, then, over time, the\r\ndecisions of the Security Council risk not being taken\r\nseriously.\r\nThat is the same reason that public\r\ncommunications these days is so important for all\r\nGovernments and organizations that want to succeed.\r\nEven with the best possible performance, it is not\r\nenough just to perform well and expect people to\r\naccept by faith that this is what is good for them. Any\r\ninstitution that eschews transparency risks raising\r\nsuspicions that something is amiss. Unfortunately, the\r\nSecurity Council’s communications are often limited to\r\nmaking known its decisions and actions, but not\r\ndisclosing how it arrived at them. That shortcoming\r\nhas spawned discussions at numerous seminars, as well\r\nas many articles and books, about the Council’s work\r\nand role. In short, if the Security Council is unwilling\r\nor unable to be more transparent, including by putting\r\nout good reports, then that work will find itself being\r\noutsourced.\r\nIn that regard, there is now a new initiative\r\noutside the United Nations that is aptly named the\r\n“Security Council Report”, a project affiliated with\r\nColumbia University and directed by Colin Keating,\r\nformer Permanent Representative of New Zealand to\r\nthe United Nations. The Report will be officially\r\nlaunched on 6 December. According to Ambassador\r\nKeating,\r\n“This initiative responds to a need for consistent,\r\nhigh quality, publicly available information ...\r\nabout the Council’s activities and those of its\r\nsubsidiary bodies. It reflects the belief that the\r\nlack of such information is a consistent barrier to\r\nthe effective performance of the Council and a\r\nmajor handicap for United Nations Member\r\nStates at large and the wider public.”\r\nThere is obviously much scope for improving the\r\nworking methods of the Security Council. However, in\r\nresponse to such criticisms and proposals for\r\nimprovement, we have heard an interesting argument,\r\nnamely, that it is not for the General Assembly to\r\nadvise the Security Council on how to conduct its\r\nwork. In that connection, the General Assembly and\r\nSecurity Council have been compared to legislative\r\nbodies where lower and upper houses are mutually\r\nexclusive.\r\nHowever, such a comparison misses the point\r\nthat, unlike such bodies, all Security Council members\r\nare members of the General Assembly. Moreover,\r\nunder Article 10 of the Charter, the Assembly has the\r\nauthority to discuss any questions or matters within the\r\nscope of the Charter or relating to the functions of any\r\norgan of the United Nations, as well as to make any\r\nrecommendations to United Nations Members and to\r\nthe Security Council.\r\nIt is in this spirit that some of us, the smaller\r\ncountries in the United Nations, have informally\r\ncirculated the text of a draft resolution containing some\r\nideas for improving the working methods of the\r\nSecurity Council. The ideas contained in the draft text\r\ndo not advocate abandoning the current system; rather,\r\nwe hope to build on the existing system by proposing\r\nimprovements to working methods that will align them\r\nmore with the needs and norms of the current times.\r\nThe result will benefit the Security Council, including\r\nits permanent members.\r\nI would also like to make it clear that the ideas\r\ncontained in the draft resolution are not cast in stone.\r\nMy delegation, as well as others involved in the\r\ninitiative, is ready and willing to engage in\r\nconsultations and discussions with the rest of the\r\nmembership of the United Nations — individually, in\r\nsmall groups and collectively with the entire\r\nmembership — to improve the draft resolution. It is\r\nour hope that other Members of the United Nations\r\nwill respond constructively to our suggestions for\r\nimproving the working methods of the Security\r\nCouncil. We also hope that, through such dialogue, we\r\nwill be able to arrive at a text that is broadly acceptable\r\nto the general membership of the United Nations.\r\n7\r\nA/60/PV.48\r\nMr. Maurer (Switzerland) (spoke in French):\r\nLike many other delegations, I wish, on behalf of\r\nSwitzerland, to extend my most sincere condolences to\r\nthe Government of Jordan, as well as to all the families\r\nof victims who are today suffering the consequences of\r\nthe terrorist attacks which yesterday struck Amman\r\nand all of Jordan.\r\nAt the outset, I would like to thank the Security\r\nCouncil for the submission of its annual report and\r\nwelcome its presentation to the General Assembly\r\ntoday by the Permanent Representative of the Russian\r\nFederation. The report contains much useful\r\ninformation, for which we are grateful. However, we\r\nalso observe that the report is mainly a compilation of\r\nmeetings held and documents issued by the Security\r\nCouncil during the reporting period. As a significant\r\nfinancial contributor to the United Nations budget,\r\nincluding to the peacekeeping operations and to special\r\npolitical missions approved by the Security Council,\r\nSwitzerland would welcome a more analytical\r\npresentation of the challenges the Security Council\r\nfaced over the past year.\r\nAt the recent Millennium + 5 Summit, the heads\r\nof State and Government of the Member States of the\r\nOrganization acknowledged that reform of the Security\r\nCouncil was an essential element of the reform of the\r\nUnited Nations and that it was necessary to make\r\nprogress both on the issue of Security Council\r\nenlargement and on the improvement of its working\r\nmethods.\r\nSwitzerland strongly favours enlargement of the\r\nSecurity Council. We share the general view that the\r\npresent composition of the Council no longer\r\nadequately reflects contemporary geopolitical realities.\r\nMy country is in favour of an enlargement based on\r\nobjective criteria. We are, moreover, of the opinion that\r\nenlargement should not mean that the right of veto\r\nshould be extended to other countries, because this\r\nwould complicate the decision-making process within\r\nthe Council and would hinder its ability to take action.\r\nIn our view, it is also essential to continue to\r\nimprove the working methods of the Security Council.\r\nThe summit outcome document expressly invites the\r\nCouncil “to continue to adapt its working methods”.\r\nMany countries have recently called on the\r\nUnited Nations Secretariat to be more transparent and\r\nresponsible in its actions in order to strengthen its own\r\neffectiveness and the effectiveness of the Organization\r\nas a whole. Switzerland fully agrees with this and\r\nthinks that the same principle should also apply to the\r\nSecurity Council. Its decisions are more likely to be\r\nunderstood and implemented if the Council takes the\r\nopinions of the larger membership into account to a\r\ngreater degree.\r\nFollowing a presentation by Switzerland in May\r\n2005 of a non-paper on Security Council working\r\nmethods, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Costa Rica,\r\nJordan and Singapore, as a contribution to the Summit\r\nfollow-up, decided to synthesize the most important\r\nproposals on working methods of recent years in a\r\ndraft resolution. On 4 November, the co-authors of this\r\ndraft distributed the draft text to all the diplomatic\r\nmissions, with a view to discussing it informally with\r\nall Member States. On 18 November, we will hold an\r\ninformation session open to all.\r\nThe draft allows for the General Assembly to call\r\nupon the Security Council to consider a series of\r\nmeasures described in the annex and to report back to\r\nthe General Assembly during the 60th session on the\r\naction it has taken pursuant to this draft. It is an\r\ninstrument that is flexible in form, but it makes a\r\nnumber of specific proposals in response to recognized\r\nproblems.\r\nPart of the proposed measures aim at\r\nstrengthening relations between the Security Council,\r\nthe General Assembly and other main bodies of the\r\nUnited Nations. In particular, we propose making the\r\ndiscussion of the Council’s annual report a platform for\r\na more interactive exchange of views, and to encourage\r\nthe Council to make use of the possibility, envisaged in\r\nthe Charter, of presenting thematic reports, and in\r\ngeneral, of favouring greater involvement of all\r\nMember States of the United Nations in the work of the\r\nCouncil.\r\nOther measures proposed deal with the work of\r\nthe subsidiary bodies of the Council. We propose\r\ngreater transparency and we encourage the Council to\r\ninvite, on a case-by-case basis, non-Member States to\r\ntake part in the work of certain subsidiary bodies, when\r\nsuch States have a strong interest or relevant expertise.\r\nThe draft resolution also stresses the importance of\r\nimproving listing and delisting procedures, a point that\r\nwas expressly acknowledged in the outcome document\r\nof the Millennium + 5 Summit.\r\nThis draft resolution also contains specific\r\nproposals on the use of the veto. The first of these\r\n8\r\nA/60/PV.48\r\nproposals invites a Permanent Member that has used its\r\nveto to explain publicly its reasons for doing so, in\r\norder to make its position better known to the entirety\r\nof Member States. The second proposal is designed to\r\nprevent — bearing in mind the responsibility to\r\nprotect — the use of the veto in cases of genocide,\r\ncrimes against humanity and serious violations of\r\ninternational humanitarian law. These proposals do not\r\naffect the substance of the veto.\r\nThis draft resolution has been formulated with\r\ncare and in such a way as to take account of the\r\nrespective roles and competencies of the Security\r\nCouncil and of the General Assembly, as defined in the\r\nCharter. This draft resolution is based on Article 10 of\r\nthe Charter, which grants the General Assembly the\r\ncompetence to discuss the functions of other United\r\nNations organs. We have chosen with care the terms of\r\nthe draft resolution, so that it does not infringe upon\r\nthe prerogatives and competencies of the Security\r\nCouncil, since it invites the Council to consider the\r\nmeasures described. It is up to the Security Council to\r\ndecide on the action it wants to take in order to follow\r\nup on the proposals. The proposals are written in such\r\na way as to offer an element of flexibility and a margin\r\nof interpretation. It aims at dialogue and at launching a\r\ndiscussion process, and does not seek to impose ready-\r\nmade decisions.\r\nThe five co-authors of the draft resolution favour\r\na comprehensive Security Council reform. We are\r\nstrongly of the opinion that this draft resolution does\r\nnot in any way affect the discussion on the enlargement\r\nof the Security Council. As a matter of fact, we hope\r\nthat these complementary processes will be mutually\r\nreinforcing. The treatment of these two questions in\r\nparallel processes is justified by the differences in their\r\nnature and by differences in the decisions to be taken.\r\nWhatever model is chosen, enlargement of the Security\r\nCouncil will necessarily entail an amendment of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations. By contrast,\r\nimprovements in the working methods of the Security\r\nCouncil primarily involve changes in the Council’s\r\npractice, if necessary, through modifications of the\r\nrules of procedure. In our view, they do not require\r\nmodifications of the Charter.\r\nAs has always been the case in the past,\r\nSwitzerland and its partners wish to act constructively\r\nin pursuing this initiative. We are open to continuing\r\nthe discussion of the contents of this draft resolution\r\nwith the permanent members of the Security Council,\r\nas we have in the past, as well as to discussing the time\r\nof its tabling and the appropriate time to take action, in\r\nparticular to avoid any interference with initiatives\r\nconcerning the enlargement of the Council. In order\r\nnot to interfere with the discussions on enlargement,\r\nthis resolution could be tabled at the appropriate time\r\nunder the item of the agenda relating to the follow-up\r\nto the Millennium Summit, and not under the one\r\nrelating to the enlargement of the Security Council.\r\nTo sum up, our draft resolution on the working\r\nmethods of the Security Council is of interest to all\r\nUnited Nations Members because it aims at increasing\r\ntransparency and participation and will thus contribute\r\nto the effectiveness and legitimacy of the Security\r\nCouncil’s action. The draft resolution should be\r\nacceptable to the five permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council, as it respects the prerogatives of the\r\nCouncil. It should be acceptable to all proponents of\r\nenlargement, under whatever formula they choose,\r\nbecause it seeks mutually reinforcing reform and\r\nbecause it comes at an appropriate moment in the\r\ndiscussions on Security Council reform and in the\r\nfollow-up to the 2005 High-level Plenary Meeting.\r\nSwitzerland believes that progress must be made\r\nwhere possible. We cannot allow ourselves to get\r\ncaught up in tactical considerations, which threaten to\r\nparalyse the reform process at a time when changes are\r\ncrucial to advancing the goals of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Jenie (Indonesia): At the outset, allow me to\r\njoin the President and the representatives who have\r\nspoken before me to express our profound sorrow,\r\ncondolences and sympathy to the delegation, the\r\npeople and the Government of the Hashemite Kingdom\r\nof Jordan, as well as to the families who lost loved\r\nones in the terrorist attacks in Amman. Indonesia\r\ncondemns those barbaric terrorist acts.\r\nMy delegation is once again pleased to welcome\r\nthe report of the Security Council to the General\r\nAssembly, which is contained in document A/60/2. The\r\nobjective of that annual report is to provide Member\r\nStates a summary of the work of the Council during the\r\nreporting period pertaining to its mandate: the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. In\r\nview of the importance of the report, the Assembly’s\r\nmeetings on this item continue to be a good\r\nopportunity for us to review the work of the Council.\r\nFor this reason, we are grateful to the members of the\r\nCouncil for their report, and to the General Assembly\r\n9\r\nA/60/PV.48\r\nfor this opportunity to make a contribution to the\r\ndebate.\r\nAs we all know, this meeting is also considering\r\nthe report of the Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase\r\nin the Membership of the Security Council and Other\r\nMatters related to the Security Council (A/59/47). On\r\nbehalf of my delegation, I would like to express my\r\nappreciation to His Excellency Mr. Jean Ping of\r\nGabon, President of the General Assembly at its fifty-\r\nninth session, for his active role as Chairperson of the\r\nWorking Group and for his determined efforts\r\nthroughout the session to move these issues forward.\r\nWe would also like to thank Ambassadors Paulette\r\nBethel of the Bahamas and Christian Wenaweser of\r\nLiechtenstein, Vice-Chairpersons of the Working\r\nGroup, for their diligence and hard work in the service\r\nof the Group.\r\nThe report of the Security Council provides a\r\nuseful outline of its work throughout the period under\r\nconsideration, clearly demonstrating an upward trend\r\nin the scope and volume of the Council’s activities.\r\nAmong the areas of focus were the conflicts in several\r\nareas of Africa, the situation in the Middle East and\r\nterrorism. We are grateful to the members of the\r\nCouncil for their attention to those and many other\r\nissues.\r\nUnfortunately, we must observe that the report is\r\nstill far too much an enumeration of facts and not\r\nenough of a report that explains how or why certain\r\ndecisions or courses of action were preferred over\r\nothers. For many years, delegations have called on the\r\nSecurity Council to ensure that its report provides an\r\nanalysis that fulfils that need. Until that happens, the\r\nannual report can have only a rather limited value. We\r\nurge the Council to pay attention to that issue. Our\r\nsuggestion is that it should set clear guidelines to guide\r\neach annual analysis of its work. Such guidelines will\r\nprevent the analysis from requiring protracted annual\r\nnegotiations before it can be prepared for the benefit of\r\nMember States. On that question, it is instructive that\r\nthe report of the Open-ended Working Group also\r\nreflects the concern of delegations that the Security\r\nCouncil report “should be factual, comprehensive,\r\nsubstantive and analytical” (A/59/47, annex II,\r\npara. 5). Despite those concerns, we commend the\r\nCouncil for its work on peace and security issues\r\nthroughout the period, particularly on peacekeeping,\r\nconflict resolution and terrorism.\r\nLet me now turn to the report of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group. It is significant to note that there is\r\nprovisional agreement on items under cluster II, which\r\ndeals with methods of work. It is a matter of concern\r\nthat we have not made much concrete progress on the\r\nsubstantive issues since the Working Group began its\r\nassignment, 11 years ago.\r\nMy delegation would like to reiterate its position\r\nthat enhancing the effectiveness of the United Nations\r\ndemands a strong and active relationship between the\r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly, and\r\nindeed among all the organs. The World Summit\r\nOutcome made that point when it stated that\r\n“in order to efficiently perform their respective\r\nmandates as provided under the Charter, United\r\nNations bodies should develop good cooperation\r\nand coordination in the common endeavour of\r\nbuilding a more effective United Nations”.\r\n(resolution 60/1, para. 147)\r\nThe Security Council is further called upon to adapt its\r\nmethods of work in order to increase non-members’\r\ninvolvement in its work.\r\nOn the issue of accountability, in particular the\r\nrelationship between the Security Council and the\r\nGeneral Assembly, my delegation is concerned about\r\nthe Council’s gradual encroachment on the powers and\r\nmandate of the General Assembly. The Council should\r\nrefrain from addressing thematic issues, since those fall\r\nwithin the purview of the Assembly and the Economic\r\nand Social Council. Indeed, there should be a clear\r\ndemarcation of the respective fields of competence of\r\nthe Assembly and the Council. Consultations between\r\nthe Presidents of those principal organs should be\r\ninstitutionalized as soon as possible. Furthermore, my\r\ndelegation considers that the Security Council ought to\r\nconvene more formal meetings on specific issues under\r\nits consideration, in order that it might learn of, and be\r\nenriched by, the views of interested parties.\r\nThe report of the Working Group also underlines\r\nthe desire of troop-contributing countries to enjoy\r\nstronger involvement in the decision-making processes\r\nof the Council, including at the early stages of mission\r\nplanning. We share that position, because it will\r\nenhance unity among the parties in a peacekeeping\r\nprocess.\r\nWith regard to the use of sanctions, we reiterate\r\nour position that they should be used only as a last\r\n10\r\nA/60/PV.48\r\nresort, and after other means available to the Council\r\nhave been exhausted.\r\nTurning now to the issue of subsidiary organs,\r\nour position is that their work should be more\r\naccessible to Member States in general. Overall, the\r\nuse of such organs should also be curtailed.\r\nIndonesia has always supported a comprehensive\r\napproach to United Nations reform and will continue to\r\ndo so. That exercise is overdue. It is most welcome that\r\nat the world summit heads of State or Government\r\noffered their support for early reform of the Council as\r\nan essential element of the effort to reform the\r\nOrganization to make it more broadly representative,\r\nefficient and transparent, and thus to further enhance\r\nits effectiveness and the legitimacy and implementation\r\nof its decisions. They also committed themselves to a\r\nprocess that would achieve a decision to that end by\r\nthe end of 2005.\r\nIt is our expectation that reform of the Council\r\nwill help to strengthen the body and address these\r\nconcerns by providing accountability, transparency and\r\nrepresentativeness. In that connection, my delegation\r\ntakes note of the draft resolution proposed by the\r\ndelegations of Costa Rica, Jordan, Liechtenstein,\r\nSingapore and Switzerland. It is our hope that the\r\nPresident will be able to conduct further consultations\r\non this matter and to reach the widest acceptable\r\ncompromise among Member States.\r\nIn the light of those issues, my delegation\r\nbelieves that there is an urgent need for the members of\r\nthe Security Council — particularly the permanent\r\nmembers — to respond positively to the substantive\r\ninput being provided by the majority of Member States\r\nby showing the political will to act. Such a response\r\nshould lead to an improvement in the Council’s\r\nworking methods.\r\nFinally, members will recall that a few months\r\nago, this body was thrown into an unusual situation,\r\ninvolving contestants for positions in an expanded\r\nmembership of the Security Council. That experience,\r\nin which the issue of expansion completely\r\novershadowed other major priority issues demanding\r\nour attention, including other aspects of United Nations\r\nreform, jeopardized the unity of the Organization. It is\r\nIndonesia’s conviction that the unity of Member States\r\nremains of the utmost importance at all times. In that\r\nregard, we must take care to address equitably all\r\nissues of common interest in order to avoid\r\ndivisiveness in the future. Indonesia is fully supportive\r\nof efforts to find a fresh approach to this matter in the\r\nspirit of unity.\r\nMr. Choi Young-jin (Republic of Korea): At the\r\noutset, I would like to convey my delegation’s deep\r\ncondolences to the victims of the bomb attacks that\r\noccurred in Jordan yesterday. We condemn in the\r\nstrongest terms those heinous acts of terrorism targeted\r\nagainst innocent civilians. Our sympathy is with the\r\npeople and the Government of Jordan at this time of\r\ntrial.\r\nI should like to thank the President of the\r\nSecurity Council for this month, Ambassador Denisov\r\nof the Russian Federation, for introducing the annual\r\nreport of the Council (A/60/2). According to the report,\r\nthe volume and scope of the Council’s activities\r\ncontinued to grow over the past year. We note with\r\nconcern that Africa remains the context for the\r\nmajority of issues before the Security Council,\r\naccounting for 60 percent of its agenda.\r\nThere have been some positive developments in\r\nAfrica. Burundi, Guinea-Bissau and Liberia seem to be\r\non track in their transition from conflict to stability,\r\nwith the process of nation-building under way and\r\nbolstered by recent successful elections. In many other\r\ncountries, however, instability continues. In particular,\r\nthe humanitarian crisis in the Darfur region of western\r\nSudan is still going on, and fresh reports of increasing\r\nviolence indicate that the situation is not improving.\r\nAnother area of serious concern is Côte d’Ivoire, where\r\nelections could not take place as scheduled and\r\nanxieties are increasing. In addition, we are deeply\r\nconcerned about the recent escalation of the tensions\r\nbetween Ethiopia and Eritrea and the restrictions\r\nimposed unilaterally on the movement of the United\r\nNations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea. We urge both\r\ncountries to exercise maximum restraint.\r\nWe appreciate the Security Council’s active\r\nefforts to maintain peace and prevent further disputes\r\nin Africa through the recent establishment of United\r\nNations missions in several countries on the continent.\r\nWe also welcome the Council’s efforts to find long-\r\nterm solutions to African issues by holding a\r\nconstructive open debate on the topic and by adopting\r\nresolution 1625 (2005), on the prevention of conflict,\r\nparticularly in Africa, at a summit-level Council\r\nmeeting.\r\n11\r\nA/60/PV.48\r\nDuring the past year, the Security Council\r\ncontinued to devote considerable attention to the\r\nsituation in Iraq. The period saw the achievement of\r\nsignificant political benchmarks on Iraq’s path towards\r\ndemocracy, including the parliamentary elections in\r\nJanuary and the formation of the Transitional\r\nGovernment in May. The approval of the draft\r\nconstitution by national referendum last month\r\ndemonstrated the desire of the Iraqi people to\r\ndetermine their own political future. We look forward\r\nto the upcoming general elections on 15 December,\r\nwhich we hope can serve as a foundation on which\r\nlasting institutions and national reconciliation can be\r\nbuilt.\r\nFor its part, the Republic of Korea is continuing\r\nto help the Iraqi people to rebuild their country. In the\r\nlight of the Iraqi Government’s recent request, we\r\nwelcome the adoption of Security Council resolution\r\n1637 (2005), which extends the mandate of the\r\nmultinational force in Iraq. The Security Council must\r\ncontinue to play an important role in stabilizing and\r\nreconstructing Iraq and in facilitating its transition to a\r\nfully representative Government.\r\nWith regard to Lebanon, we support the Security\r\nCouncil’s continuing efforts to take follow-up actions\r\nin response to the terrorist bombing that killed former\r\nLebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and others. The\r\nCouncil’s unanimous adoption of resolution 1636\r\n(2005) at the ministerial-level meeting last week sent a\r\nstrong and clear message. That resolution must be\r\nimplemented scrupulously.\r\nElsewhere in Asia, it is encouraging that\r\nAfghanistan has made progress in security and nation-\r\nbuilding, with constant and broad assistance from the\r\ninternational community. In particular, we commend\r\nthe holding of parliamentary and provincial elections in\r\nSeptember, which completed the Bonn process. We\r\nalso note with appreciation that, in cooperation with\r\nthe United Nations, Timor-Leste has been successfully\r\nbuilding solid foundations for peace and development\r\nfor the past several years. We are confident that,\r\nbuilding upon the progress made so far, Timor-Leste\r\nwill become a model case of successful transition from\r\nconflict to peace and long-term development.\r\nThe past year saw terrorist attacks in London,\r\nEgypt, Iraq, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, India, Lebanon and\r\nelsewhere around the world — most recently in Jordan\r\nyesterday — demonstrating once again that no country\r\nand no individual is safe from terrorist attack. The\r\ninternational community must therefore stand united\r\nagainst terrorism. In that regard, the Republic of Korea\r\nnotes with satisfaction that the Security Council\r\ncontinues to play a leading role in combating terrorism,\r\nin particular through its three Committees on the\r\nmatter. Coordination and cooperation among those\r\nCommittees should be further enhanced to make the\r\nCouncil’s counter-terrorism activities all the more\r\neffective.\r\nLet me now briefly turn to reform of the Security\r\nCouncil. This year, we had a very intensive discussion\r\non the issue of Council expansion, and various\r\nproposals were put forward. Unfortunately, those\r\ndiscussions did not lead to much progress. The\r\nRepublic of Korea has made it clear that it supports the\r\nidea of a reformed Security Council that is more\r\nrepresentative, accountable and effective. In the same\r\nvein, we have opposed any expansion of the permanent\r\nmembership. I will refrain from reiterating in detail my\r\ncountry’s position on Security Council reform. I only\r\nhope that, with our collective wisdom, we can reform\r\nthe Council so that it can better fulfil its mandate in the\r\nfuture.\r\nWe appreciate the efforts of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group to improve the Council’s working\r\nmethods. We also acknowledge the steps taken thus far\r\nby the Council to increase the transparency of its work\r\nand the involvement of non-Council members. We\r\nbelieve that, building on that progress, we need to\r\nundertake further reform of the Council’s working\r\nmethods to make the Council more transparent,\r\ndemocratic and efficient.\r\nMr. Dolgov (Russian Federation) (spoke in\r\nRussian): This meeting of the General Assembly is\r\ntaking place in the context of the common\r\nunderstanding endorsed by world leaders at the 2005\r\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting with regard to the need for\r\ncomprehensive strengthening of the United Nations as\r\nthe central multilateral institution to address\r\ninternational relations and ensure global security and\r\nstability. The summit outcome document\r\n(resolution 60/1) set out the generally acceptable bases\r\nfor continuing the collective effort to enhance the\r\neffectiveness of the United Nations on the basis of a\r\ncomprehensive approach.\r\nIn addition, the run-up to the summit once again\r\nunderscored serious differences on the approach to\r\n12\r\nA/60/PV.48\r\nSecurity Council reform. Attempts to force a decision\r\non that important problem have threatened that the\r\ndrastic polarization of the positions of Member States\r\nwould cause a rift in the United Nations. In such a\r\nclimate it was not possible to reach a mutually\r\nacceptable solution to the matter of the expansion of\r\nthe membership of the Security Council by the holding\r\nof the summit in September. The Russian Federation is\r\ncertain that the search for an effective common\r\ndenominator on this problem must be continued, so\r\nthat an increase in the membership of the Council does\r\nnot have a negative impact on the efforts of either the\r\nUnited Nations or the international community to\r\naddress pressing global policy problems.\r\nWe are prepared to lend our agreement to any\r\nreasonable option for an increase in Security Council\r\nmembership, provided it enjoys the broadest consensus\r\npossible. As we understand it, such consensus\r\npresupposes far more robust political support for the\r\nanticipated final outcome than the legally required two-\r\nthirds vote in the General Assembly.\r\nRussia has consistently believed that reform must\r\nlead to further enhancing the effectiveness of the\r\nSecurity Council through a limited increase in its\r\nmembership. The Council must be more representative\r\nand must reflect changing international realities. Those\r\ngoals can be achieved above all by bringing influential\r\ndeveloping countries into the Council, as well as\r\ndeveloped countries. Russia’s position with regard to\r\nspecific candidatures for permanent membership in the\r\nCouncil is well known, and we have repeatedly\r\nreaffirmed it.\r\nEnhancing the representative character of the\r\nSecurity Council should not erode its effectiveness.\r\nThat is why Russia calls for maintaining the Security\r\nCouncil’s compact character, and why we believe that\r\nthe number of members of a reformed Council should\r\nnot exceed a reasonable number. On a preliminary\r\nbasis, we have already had an opportunity to define\r\nsuch a number as 20-plus.\r\nRussia is certain that ideas intended to encroach\r\nupon the prerogatives and powers of the current\r\npermanent members of the Security Council, including\r\nthe right to the veto, are counterproductive. Advancing\r\nsuch ideas, which have no possibility of\r\nimplementation, simply serves to arouse emotions and\r\ndo not make it any easier to achieve agreement on the\r\nparameters for Security Council reform.\r\nRussia will continue to contribute to the Security\r\nCouncil’s efforts to improve its methods of work,\r\nincrease transparency and deepen its interaction with\r\nnon-members of the Council, in particular with\r\ncountries contributing troops to peacekeeping\r\noperations. That position is in line with the approach\r\ntaken by our Security Council partners, as has been\r\nreaffirmed in particular by today’s debate. With regard\r\nto that fundamental position, Russia will continue to\r\ncontribute constructively to achieving the broadest\r\npossible consensus on all aspects of Security Council\r\nreform, in the interest of comprehensively\r\nstrengthening the central role of the United Nations in\r\nworld affairs.\r\nMr. Duclos (France) (spoke in French): As other\r\ncolleagues have done before me, I would like at the\r\noutset to convey our heartfelt condolences to the\r\npeople and the Government of Jordan on the recent\r\nattacks in that country.\r\nThe report on the activities of the Security\r\nCouncil (A/60/2), which was introduced to the General\r\nAssembly by the Russian presidency of the Council,\r\noutlines all the activities undertaken by the Council\r\nduring the reporting period. I thank Ambassador\r\nDenisov for his introduction. I believe that this\r\nexercise contributes positively to ensuring transparency\r\nand dialogue in the relationship between the General\r\nAssembly and the Security Council.\r\nI shall not retrace Ambassador Denisov’s\r\nexcellent presentation. I would simply like rather to\r\nunderscore a number of what my country views as key\r\npoints. I shall do so in an analytical manner, in\r\nresponse to concerns raised by a number of colleagues.\r\nIn doing so, I shall highlight three themes.\r\nWith regard to the first theme, the Security\r\nCouncil has continued to shoulder its primary\r\nresponsibilities with regard to crisis management,\r\nconcerning in particular the African continent. I am\r\npleased to underscore the fact that it has often done so\r\nin close cooperation with the African Union, the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States and other\r\nAfrican organizations. Allow me also to point out that,\r\non the initiative of Benin, the 14 September Security\r\nCouncil summit adopted a particularly innovative\r\nresolution on the subject of the prevention of conflict,\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1625 (2005).\r\nIn addition to African issues, allow me also to\r\nhighlight the matter of Lebanon. The Security Council\r\n13\r\nA/60/PV.48\r\nhas been united in addressing this issue, so that that\r\ncountry may be able to regain its full sovereignty,\r\nincluding by shedding light on, and rendering justice\r\nin, the case of the assassination of former Prime\r\nMinister Rafik Hariri.\r\nWith regard to the second theme in the work of\r\nthe Security Council, the Council is meeting its\r\nresponsibilities in the context of combating new\r\nthreats, especially with regard to terrorism and\r\nproliferation. In that connection, I would note the\r\nimportance of resolution 1624 (2005), adopted at the\r\n14 September summit, on the issue of combating\r\nterrorism. Let me also mention that the Security\r\nCouncil is taking action on other issues — for\r\nexample, the protection of children in armed conflict.\r\nWith regard to the third theme, the Council has\r\nincreasingly devoted attention to the fight against\r\nimpunity. This year, the Council met with the\r\nPresidents of the International Tribunals for the former\r\nYugoslavia and for Rwanda, as well as with the\r\nPresident of the Special Court for Sierra Leone. For the\r\nfirst time, the Council also met with the Prosecutor of\r\nthe International Criminal Court on the issue of Darfur\r\nshortly after the Court took up the case. I would also\r\nnote that the Council devoted a meeting to the fight\r\nagainst impunity in Burundi.\r\nBeyond the record of activities, one of the\r\nimportant lessons of the past year is that the Security\r\nCouncil in practice is continuing to enhance what are\r\ncalled its working methods. We are seeing an ongoing\r\nadaptation of these methods and, specifically, an\r\nevolution towards greater transparency and openness.\r\nFor example, more than in the past, the Security\r\nCouncil in recent months has taken up the concerns of\r\nthe troop-contributing countries. We witnessed this\r\nrecently, thanks to the initiative of Japan, with respect\r\nto the crisis between Ethiopia and Eritrea. The Council\r\nhas also given particular attention to better involving\r\nStates not members of the Council. For example, it has\r\nmade sure that, within the framework of the various\r\nsanctions committees, it takes better account of the\r\nconcerns of neighbouring countries.\r\nThe thematic debates, which are sometimes\r\ncriticized, have also been an opportunity for the\r\nSecurity Council to learn more about the views of other\r\nMember States that are not Council members. Lastly,\r\nin the same spirit, I would note that the Security\r\nCouncil has worked to further bring on board non-State\r\nactors in terms of its work. The Arria-formula meetings\r\nhave been used more frequently in order to meet with\r\ncivil society and non-governmental organizations.\r\nBehind this progress of recent years, there is\r\nobviously the commitment to seek in a pragmatic way\r\na balance between the fact that the Council does need\r\nto meet its responsibilities — all of its\r\nresponsibilities — and its commitment to being more\r\nopen and to listen to the sensibilities of States not\r\nmembers of the Council or other actors that might have\r\na useful role in terms of issues or crises that are being\r\ndealt with by the Council.\r\nThis brings me to the issue of Security Council\r\nreform. The heads of State and Government reaffirmed\r\ntwo months ago that Security Council reform was a\r\ncentral element in the United Nations reform. They\r\nundertook to ensure that this reform would occur as\r\nsoon as possible. Let me say that this reflects wisdom.\r\nIt seems to us that, in this area, one needs to show a\r\nspirit of responsibility and, therefore, to do nothing\r\nthat would weaken our organ, whose mandate is to\r\nensure international peace and security. At the same\r\ntime, we must refuse to remain paralysed, because that\r\nwould be detrimental not just to this or that State but to\r\nour entire Organization.\r\nA discussion has been under way for months.\r\nSome say it was an acrimonious debate that carried the\r\nseeds of division. We believe that this has been a\r\nhealthy debate, useful to better clarify what is at stake\r\nand, perhaps, to reconcile points of view.\r\nI would say that, for our country, the more the\r\nsubject was discussed and the more our own views\r\nwere corroborated, it appeared that a just, effective\r\nsolution entailed expansion in the two categories of\r\nmembers, permanent and non-permanent. It also\r\nseemed to us essential that Africa have its full due\r\nplace within a Security Council reformed accordingly.\r\nAnd we support, more than ever, the aspirations of\r\nGermany, Japan, India and Brazil.\r\nThe draft resolution submitted to the General\r\nAssembly by 31 sponsors last July continues to be fully\r\nrelevant and pertinent. We reiterate our support for this\r\ntext and, more than ever, believe that it offers a good\r\ncompromise, one that could be accepted by the\r\nbroadest number. In addition, it has the added\r\nadvantage of dealing with two inseparable elements of\r\nCouncil reform — that is, the continuing improvement\r\n14\r\nA/60/PV.48\r\nof its working methods and the expansion of its\r\nmembership.\r\nI would like to comment on this last point. We\r\nbelieve that if we are to deal exclusively with the issue\r\nof continuing to improve the working methods, that\r\nwould be detrimental to the issue of expansion of the\r\nSecurity Council’s membership. We all know that for\r\nmonths, or even years, there has been an urgent need to\r\nimprove the functioning of our Organization.\r\nTo sum up, we express the hope that the General\r\nAssembly, which before the end of next month is to\r\ntake stock of progress made towards reforming the\r\nSecurity Council, will be in a position to report that\r\nreal progress has been made.\r\nMr. Stagno Ugarte (Costa Rica) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): Allow me first to join previous speakers in\r\nexpressing our most sincere and heartfelt condolences\r\nto the Kingdom of Jordan on the terrorist attacks that\r\ntook place yesterday in Amman.\r\nIn compliance with the obligation contained in\r\nArticle 24 of the Charter, the Security Council today\r\npresents its annual report to the General Assembly for\r\nconsideration and adoption. The report follows the\r\nrevised format adopted in 2002 that introduced a\r\nnumber of improvements aimed at facilitating its\r\nconsideration. However, contrary to the practice begun\r\nin 2002, when the report was discussed in depth at an\r\nopen meeting of the Security Council — the 4616th\r\nmeeting, held on 26 September — on this occasion,\r\nunfortunately, that precedent has been discontinued.\r\nIndeed, the Council held only a short formal meeting,\r\nwhich lasted only five minutes.\r\nI believe it appropriate to refer to the Council’s\r\n4616th meeting, given that the 23 pages of its procès-\r\nverbal (S/PV.4616), containing the statements by the\r\nCouncil members, offer much greater insight into the\r\nmanner in which the Council really works than do the\r\n302 pages of the 2001-2002 annual report. Therefore,\r\nin discontinuing the practice of holding open meetings\r\nof the Council to discuss the substance of its annual\r\nreport — in this case the 258-page report for the 2004-\r\n2005 period — we are truly taking a step backwards in\r\nterms of the Council’s working methods.\r\nCosta Rica is particularly proud to be an integral\r\npart of the group of five small nations — the “Small\r\nFive” (S-5) — which has authored and sponsored the\r\nmost comprehensive draft resolution in recent memory\r\non the working methods of the Security Council. Allow\r\nme to pay tribute to Switzerland for having\r\nspearheaded this joint effort to improve the internal\r\nprocedures of the United Nations organ of most limited\r\ncomposition. Since some of our “Small Five” partners\r\nhave already presented in detail our proposal, which\r\nhas been unofficially distributed, I would like to\r\nconcentrate on other aspects related to the Council’s\r\nworking methods and to the initiative in question.\r\nI do not wish here to reiterate once again our\r\nposition on Security Council reform. Let me simply\r\nreaffirm our conviction that the Council requires a\r\ncomprehensive reform that will enhance its\r\ntransparency, democracy and effectiveness, as well as\r\nimprove Council rotation, so as to enable it to act on\r\nbehalf of all Member States and in strict compliance\r\nwith the Charter.\r\nIn that regard, we believe it the time has come to\r\ntackle the other side of reform, that is, the Council’s\r\nworking methods. However, our interest in the\r\nCouncil’s working methods should not be interpreted\r\nas a lack of interest in the Council’s expansion. We\r\nsimply believe that consideration of working methods\r\nalways suffers if it is tackled simultaneously and\r\njointly with the issue of expansion.\r\nIn fact, and much to our disappointment, the\r\nconsultations on Security Council reform that have\r\nbeen held in recent months have concentrated on its\r\nexpansion alone. We are convinced that this is not\r\nsufficient, as we have the opportunity to show greater\r\nambition and to move beyond mere readjustments to\r\nwork jointly to reach a new consensus on the way in\r\nwhich the Organization must confront current threats.\r\nThe democracy, transparency and accountability that\r\nmust necessarily accompany the process of taking\r\ndecisions that at times are binding on us all are\r\ndependent primarily on the working methods used.\r\nWhile in the past we have had concerns regarding\r\nthe working methods of the Security Council, such\r\nconcerns have only multiplied given what we know of\r\nthe role played by the Council in the mismanagement\r\nof the oil-for-food programme. Costa Rica believes that\r\nreform of the working methods of the Council is an\r\nintegral part of the broader management and oversight\r\nreform effort currently under way in the United\r\nNations. We believe that this logical conclusion can be\r\ndrawn from the final report of the Independent Inquiry\r\nCommittee, dated 7 September 2005, which made it\r\n15\r\nA/60/PV.48\r\nabundantly clear that the lack of transparency in the\r\nproceedings of the Security Council and of its\r\nsubsidiary organs, in particular the Committee\r\nestablished pursuant to resolution 661 (1990),\r\naggravated problems related to the management of the\r\noil-for-food programme. Costa Rica has taken due note\r\nof the many though scattered references made by the\r\nVolcker Committee to the Council’s working methods.\r\nBecause of our commitment to a United Nations\r\nendowed with efficient and transparent management\r\nand oversight mechanisms, we believe that there is a\r\nneed to tackle management and oversight reform in a\r\ncross-cutting fashion, covering every aspect of this\r\nOrganization if required. In that context, we cannot but\r\nconclude, on the basis of the Volcker report, that the\r\ninternal management and oversight of the Security\r\nCouncil must be an integral part of the further overall\r\nmanagement and oversight reform efforts undertaken.\r\nFor that reason, we believe that it is particularly\r\npressing to initiate a joint discussion in the General\r\nAssembly on the working methods of the Council.\r\nThere truly has not been an effort of comparable\r\nscope to that of the “Small Five” proposal since the\r\nadoption of General Assembly resolution 267 (III), to\r\nwhich I will refer in more detail later. Paradoxically,\r\nalthough the Open-ended Working Group has dealt\r\nwith both cluster I and cluster II issues every year\r\nsince 1993 — with the sole exception of the Razali\r\nproposal, which included significant reforms to the\r\nworking methods of the Security Council — efforts to\r\nreform the Council have always given short shrift to its\r\nworking methods. Costa Rica believes that it is high\r\ntime that the General Assembly send an unequivocal\r\nmessage to the Council that it cannot continue to\r\nfunction if its transparency and accountability are not\r\nenhanced.\r\nGiven that the S-5 initiative was drafted in a\r\nspirit of caution and respect, inviting the Security\r\nCouncil to consider a series of measures enumerated in\r\nthe annex, it is surprising to us that some are seeking to\r\nevade the issue of improvements by questioning the\r\nauthority of the General Assembly in such matters.\r\nAllow me briefly to address some of the arguments that\r\nsome Member States have advanced to counter the\r\ninitiative put forward by the S-5.\r\nI think that it is particularly important to restate\r\nthe broad prerogatives that Article 10 of the Charter\r\nconfers on the General Assembly. While its\r\n“comprehensive jurisdiction” clause is not regularly\r\ncited, Article 10 is unequivocally clear as to the\r\nstatutory right of the General Assembly to discuss any\r\nquestion relating to the powers and functions of any\r\norgan of the United Nations. The General Assembly is\r\nnot exceeding its authority when it reviews the\r\nworking procedures of the Security Council; on the\r\ncontrary, it is complying fully with its mandate under\r\nthe Charter.\r\nWhile some may argue that Article 12 expressly\r\nlimits the General Assembly’s powers of consideration\r\nand discussion, this is a purely procedural and\r\ntemporary restriction that aims to avoid any duplication\r\nof work between the Security Council and the General\r\nAssembly, as can be ascertained from the fact that the\r\nSecurity Council has primary but not sole\r\nresponsibility on matters pertaining to the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security. Uniting for\r\nPeace — resolution 377 (V) — is concrete evidence of\r\nthe role that the General Assembly can and at times\r\nmust play if the Security Council is unable to shoulder\r\nand discharge its Charter-mandated responsibilities.\r\nHowever, that argument simply does not apply in this\r\ncase, because the S-5 initiative is merely an invitation\r\nto the Council to consider a series of purely functional\r\nand operational proposals that do not address or\r\nprejudge any situation in particular.\r\nSome also say that Article 30 of the Charter\r\nstipulates that the Security Council shall adopt its own\r\nrules of procedure. That is certainly true. But it is\r\nironic that some Council members take refuge in that\r\nArticle when we have been using provisional rules of\r\nprocedure for 60 years now, in contravention of the\r\nsame Charter. Others argue that it is not necessary to\r\nformally adopt the rules of procedure, because, in the\r\nbest Anglo-American tradition, Article 30 permits the\r\ngradual development and alteration of practice. If that\r\nwere so, we should wonder why the same tradition has\r\nnot been followed with the rules of procedure of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil, which have the same power to adopt their\r\nown rules of procedure under other Articles of the\r\nCharter that were written in exactly the same manner\r\nas Article 30. The Charter provides no mandate to\r\ninterpret Article 30 in the Anglo-American tradition\r\nand the other Articles in the Continental tradition.\r\nMoreover, with regard to the General Assembly’s\r\nsupposed interference in the internal affairs of the\r\nSecurity Council — which, as already demonstrated, is\r\n16\r\nA/60/PV.48\r\ntotally consistent with the comprehensive jurisdiction\r\nclause of Article 10 — I wish to refer to practice. At its\r\n197th meeting, on 27 August 1947, the Security\r\nCouncil considered General Assembly resolution 40\r\n(I). In that resolution, the General Assembly\r\n“Recommends to the Security Council the\r\nearly adoption of practices and procedures,\r\nconsistent with the Charter, to assist in reducing\r\nthe difficulties in the application of Article 27\r\nand to ensure the prompt and effective exercise\r\nby the Security Council of its functions; and\r\n“Further recommends that, in developing\r\nsuch practices and procedures, the Security\r\nCouncil take into consideration the views\r\nexpressed by Members of the United Nations\r\nduring the second part of the first session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.”\r\nLikewise, at its 224th meeting, on 19 December 1947,\r\nthe Security Council considered General Assembly\r\nresolution 117 (II). It should be stressed that the\r\nresolution’s sole preambular paragraph specifically\r\nsays,\r\n“The General Assembly, in the exercise of\r\nits power to make recommendations relating to\r\nthe powers and functions of any organs of the\r\nUnited Nations (Article 10 of the Charter)”.\r\nFinally, I should like to invite all Members to study\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 267 (III), adopted on 14\r\nApril 1949 with the affirmative vote of four permanent\r\nmembers — only the Union of Soviet Socialist\r\nRepublics voted against it — which has many formal\r\nand procedural similarities to the current initiative of\r\nthe S-5. I have circulated a copy of that resolution so\r\nthat members may arrive at their own conclusions.\r\nMr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): We welcome\r\ntoday’s joint debate not only as a measure to revitalize\r\nthe work of the General Assembly, but even more\r\nbecause we believe that the issues of the report of the\r\nSecurity Council and Council reform are closely linked\r\nin substance.\r\nDuring the months leading up to the summit, we\r\nwitnessed impressive and orchestrated efforts to bring\r\nabout reform of the Security Council — reform that we\r\nagree is long overdue. Those concerted diplomatic\r\nefforts were successful in bringing the topic of Council\r\nreform to the forefront of our agenda, and they in fact\r\ndominated the discussions in this building throughout\r\nthe summer. They did not result, however, in the\r\nachievement of the declared goal of Council reform. In\r\nSeptember, our heads of State or Government\r\ncommitted themselves to early reform of the Council\r\nand mandated the General Assembly to review\r\nprogress made on that topic by the end of this year.\r\nWith no concrete proposal left on the table, we seem to\r\nbe in a place similar to where we were a year ago. The\r\ntask immediately before us thus consists of re-creating\r\nthe momentum for Security Council reform.\r\nAs members are aware, we, together with four\r\nlike-minded States, have circulated a draft resolution\r\non the issue of the Security Council’s working\r\nmethods. The Assembly has heard presentations by\r\nseveral of our co-authors — including, immediately\r\npreceding, the representative of Costa Rica, and in\r\nparticular the representative of Switzerland, who made\r\nan excellent presentation on the substance of our draft\r\nresolution. I will thus limit my comments to three\r\naspects of the draft resolution: its relationship to\r\nenlargement, its foundation in the outcome document\r\n(resolution 60/1) and its non-confrontational nature.\r\nWe are pleased that the draft resolution is receiving\r\nmuch attention in the corridors, in informal discussions\r\nand in today’s debate, which we hope will contribute to\r\nan informed discussion of our initiative.\r\nAll five of the States that launched the initiative\r\nstrongly support enlargement of the Security Council,\r\nalthough we do not agree among ourselves on the\r\nmodalities of such enlargement. We concur, however,\r\nin the view that the Council’s working methods deserve\r\nthe same attention and the same careful the\r\nconsideration as the politically charged topic of\r\nenlargement. For small States in particular — and, in\r\nfact, for a large majority of the membership — our\r\ndaily interaction with the Council is at least as\r\nimportant as the question of who serves on it as a\r\nmember.\r\nThe three draft resolutions submitted in the\r\ncourse of this year, which deal with both aspects of\r\nreform — expansion and working methods — illustrate\r\nclearly that combining the two aspects would\r\ninevitably be to the detriment of working methods. We\r\ntherefore concluded some months ago that addressing\r\nthe two closely interlinked topics in a complementary\r\nmanner is the only way to achieve satisfactory results\r\nin both areas. Moreover, while the two aspects are\r\nclearly two sides of the same coin, we see a marked\r\ndifference in substance that further justifies separate\r\n17\r\nA/60/PV.48\r\nresolutions. Enlargement will always lead to a Charter\r\namendment and thus will be completed once the\r\nnecessary ratifications are in place. On the other hand,\r\nadapting the working methods is an ongoing process —\r\nbased on a dialogue among Member States — that does\r\nnot lead to a Charter amendment.\r\nGiven the lack of momentum in favour of\r\nenlargement and the continued absence of a magic\r\nformula for it, we are of the view that this is a good\r\ntime to establish a basis for such a dialogue between\r\nthe Security Council and the membership at large on\r\nworking methods with a view to enhancing\r\ntransparency, legitimacy, accountability and\r\neffectiveness, in accordance with the outcome\r\ndocument. We firmly believe that effectively\r\naddressing the issue of working methods will help to\r\nbuild momentum for enlargement as well and will\r\nillustrate the need to address the second issue of\r\nSecurity Council reform.\r\nAs I have stated, the initiative on working\r\nmethods is solidly grounded in the outcome document,\r\nspecifically in its paragraphs 152 to 154. The summit\r\nhas already addressed, at the level of the General\r\nAssembly, the issue of working methods in general but\r\nclear terms. Indeed, that is nothing new, as the Open-\r\nended Working Group, a subsidiary body of the\r\nAssembly, of which I have the honour to be a Vice-\r\nChairperson, has been dealing with the issue for more\r\nthan a decade. The draft resolution circulated among\r\nthe membership is thus but an extension of the\r\noutcome document, and indeed follows up on the\r\nrelevant recommendation contained therein. The first\r\nheading of the 18 measures proposed for consideration\r\nin the annex to the draft resolution deals with the\r\nquestion of the relationship between the Security\r\nCouncil and other principal organs, in particular the\r\nGeneral Assembly. In fact, the draft resolution itself is\r\na reflection of that relationship, which we believe\r\nshould be a mutually reinforcing and open one.\r\nWe agree with those who argue that the Security\r\nCouncil is the master of its own procedures and\r\ntherefore has the sole competence to decide on all\r\nprocedural aspects of its work, including its working\r\nmethods. Our draft resolution is aimed at reconciling\r\nthat undeniable fact with the provision of the Charter\r\nthat states that the Security Council carries out its\r\nduties on behalf of all Members of the Organization. It\r\nis therefore crucial that the Council engage in a\r\ndialogue with the membership on how best to conduct\r\nits work.\r\nThe work of the Council has clearly entered a\r\nnew era since the end of the cold war. Statistical\r\nfigures regarding such things as the number of\r\nmeetings and of resolutions adopted illustrate that\r\npoint quite clearly. Moreover, the Council has\r\nsignificantly expanded its activities into areas that were\r\npreviously the domain of other bodies of the United\r\nNations, in particular the General Assembly, and the\r\nrole of its subsidiary organs has increased dramatically.\r\nThat increase in activities, including in the area of\r\nsanctions, leads to the need for stronger involvement of\r\nthe membership at large in the design of the relevant\r\ndecisions of the Council. The political will of Member\r\nStates is the main tool at the disposal of the Council to\r\nensure the effective implementation of such\r\nresolutions. More transparency and stronger\r\ninvolvement by States will make a significant\r\ncontribution to the effective implementation of the\r\nCouncil’s decisions, as well as to their legitimacy.\r\nThe overriding goal of the draft resolution is\r\ntherefore to strengthen the standing of the Security\r\nCouncil and to enhance the implementation of its\r\ndecisions, and thus its effectiveness.\r\nWe fully support the manner in which\r\nMr. Eliasson is guiding us in the implementation of,\r\nand follow-up to, the September summit. The summit\r\nleft more undecided than we had hoped. There is\r\nconsequently more left to do than we had anticipated.\r\nWe agree that, in the circumstances, Security Council\r\nreform cannot be at the top of our agenda for the time\r\nbeing. At the same time of course, the agreement in the\r\noutcome document regarding early reform must not be\r\nignored. It therefore seems advisable to gradually and\r\ncautiously build up the necessary political momentum\r\nthat can result in effective change and real reform, with\r\nthe strongest possible political support from the\r\nmembership. We have circulated our draft resolution in\r\norder to make a contribution to that end. We will\r\ncontinue to engage in open dialogue with everyone\r\nwho has a genuine interest in this topic, and we hope\r\nthat this initiative will find broad support among the\r\nmembership.\r\nMr. Toro Jiménez (Bolivarian Republic of\r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): At the outset, I would\r\nlike to avail myself of this opportunity to condemn the\r\nterrorist attacks that took place yesterday in Jordan. I\r\n18\r\nA/60/PV.48\r\nexpress our condolences to the people and the\r\nGovernment of Jordan, as well as to the families of the\r\nvictims of those heinous acts.\r\nThe delegation of the Bolivarian Republic of\r\nVenezuela would like to thank the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of the Russian Federation for his\r\nintroduction of the report of the Security Council on its\r\nactivities for the period 1 August 2004 to 31 July 2005\r\n(A/60/2). In that connection, I wish to take this\r\nopportunity to state our position with regard to the\r\nwork of the Security Council.\r\nThe report before us today highlights the\r\nsignificant growth, in both scope and volume, in the\r\nactivities of the Security Council. Africa once again\r\nhad a prominent place on the Council’s programme of\r\nwork. The Council has also given Africa higher\r\npriority in the fight against terrorism. The Bolivarian\r\nRepublic of Venezuela attaches great importance to\r\nthreats to international peace and security caused by\r\nacts of terrorism.\r\nHowever, we also adamantly condemn the\r\noccupation of Iraq and the acts carried out by foreign\r\nmilitary forces in that country. We wish to underscore\r\nthe importance of initiating an investigation into the\r\nrecent allegation of the use of lethal chemical weapons\r\nagainst the Iraqi people during the occupation of\r\nFallujah.\r\nWe are also concerned about conflicts in the\r\nMiddle East, especially the ongoing non-recognition of\r\nthe right of the Palestinian people to self-determination\r\nthat has resulted from Israel’s construction of the\r\nseparation wall on Palestinian territory and the\r\nconsequences of that undertaking for the human rights\r\nof the Palestinian people.\r\nWe also wish to condemn the siege on Iran and\r\nthe consistent failure to recognize its legitimate right to\r\nthe peaceful uses of nuclear energy.\r\nWe are concerned as well about the situation in\r\nthe fraternal country of Haiti, whose people continue to\r\nbe overwhelmed by poverty, helplessness and violence\r\ndespite the fact that there is a peacebuilding operation\r\nin that country — or is it a peacekeeping operation?\r\nWe are not quite sure what kind of operation it is.\r\nWe are also concerned about the situation in\r\nAfrica in general, where there seem to be subtle\r\nattempts to covertly impose a new form of neo-\r\ncolonialism.\r\nVenezuela agrees wholeheartedly with the\r\nimportance placed on those matters. However, we note\r\nthat the Security Council has increasingly resorted to\r\nChapter VII of the Charter in addressing issues that are\r\nnot necessarily threats to international peace and\r\nsecurity. In fact, an effort is now being made to confer\r\nlegitimacy on that practice through the proposed\r\nreform of the United Nations. Moreover, we believe\r\nthat the Council should instead, as appropriate, be\r\nmore scrupulous to act under other relevant chapters of\r\nthe Charter — such as Chapter VI, pertaining to the\r\npacific settlement of disputes. In addition, we would\r\nlike to reaffirm the importance for the Council to\r\nclearly define its authority and to focus on the\r\nfunctions and responsibilities conferred upon it by the\r\nCharter, so as to avoid repeated encroachment upon\r\nfunctions that fall within the purview of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nIn that context, the Security Council should, as\r\nwe have said, deal solely with matters that represent a\r\nthreat to international peace and security and should\r\nremove from its agenda questions that have lead the\r\nCouncil to intervene with increasing frequency in the\r\ninternal affairs of States.\r\nWe disapprove of the framework that has been\r\ncreated with a new generation of peacekeeping\r\noperations, which in their latest incarnation are called\r\n“peacebuilding operations” and are intended as a\r\nresponse to post-conflict situations. These operations\r\nseek to take on, in addition to the often debatable\r\nextension of the presence of Blue Helmets in the\r\nterritory of United Nations Member States, the civilian\r\ntasks of reconstructing or re-establishing States that\r\nhave incorrectly and unjustifiably been categorized as\r\nfailed States and States immersed in internal conflicts.\r\nTaking on such tasks directly infringes on the right of\r\npeoples to freely choose their own model of\r\ndevelopment and their own manner of restructuring\r\ntheir political institutions. The ideological basis for\r\nthese so-called peacebuilding operations, as they are\r\nenvisaged in the discussions under way in the\r\nOrganization, is the idea of a powerless, failed State.\r\nSuch concepts derive from an analysis that lacks\r\nhistorical perspective and seeks to conceal realities of\r\nthe contemporary world that cannot be ignored.\r\nFirst, there is a tacit attempt to blame the collapse\r\nof a State of the type mentioned on the presumed\r\nineptitude of its Government and people, who are\r\nrather the victims of the situation than responsible for\r\n19\r\nA/60/PV.48\r\nthe outcome that led to the establishment of a\r\npeacebuilding operation. We know that, on the\r\ncontrary, in some cases, the weakness of States\r\ncategorized as failed States is, in general, rooted in the\r\nState’s origins, because, generally speaking, many\r\nStates were created as dependent and subordinate\r\npolitical and economic entities, in other words, as\r\nforeign protectorates or semi-protectorates of a neo-\r\ncolonial character. If one opens one’s eyes to reality, it\r\ncan be seen that those countries have been the victim\r\nof destabilizing processes created by the “empire” and\r\nits allies, which deliberately unleash internal crises and\r\nwars in such States with the aim of recreating those\r\nStates in conformity with the standards imposed by the\r\nworld’s centres of power and contrary to the cardinal\r\nprinciple of the self-determination of peoples.\r\nIt is, therefore, a fundamental mistake to think\r\nthat the international community has the right or the\r\npower to determine which institutions need to be\r\nrestructured for a so-called non-functioning State to be\r\nable to carry out its basic functions. In our opinion, as\r\nstated in the Charter of the United Nations, only the\r\npeople of the State concerned have the collective and\r\ninalienable right to decide the foundation and structure\r\nof their model of development and their future destiny.\r\nIn addition, those operations clearly are, or end up\r\nbeing, by definition, acts of repression, intervention\r\nand intimidation, in contravention of the principles\r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations must be\r\na tool used for the strict fulfilment of the provisions of\r\nthe Charter and must conform without reservation, with\r\nthe principles of the consent of the parties involved,\r\nimpartiality and the non-use of force except in the case\r\nof legitimate defence, as established in Chapter VII of\r\nthe Charter. Moreover, the mandates of those missions\r\nmust not be ambiguous, because that leaves the parties\r\ninvolved hostage to the Security Council. Decisions\r\ntaken with regard to peacekeeping operations must\r\nconform to the fundamental principles of international\r\nlaw, as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations,\r\nthat is, unconditional respect for State sovereignty,\r\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of States and the\r\nself-determination of peoples. In addition,\r\npeacekeeping operations must have the financing\r\nnecessary to attain the desired result of lasting and\r\nsustainable peace.\r\nIn any case, peacekeeping operations do not\r\ncontribute any kind of solution with respect to the\r\ndeep-rooted causes of the conflicts that affect\r\nnumerous Member States. Those causes are often\r\nserious and chronic socio-economic problems resulting\r\nfrom policies imposed by illegitimate Governments\r\nthat are subordinate to foreign policies that are guided\r\nby the interests of multinational corporations and\r\nimperialist States.\r\nFor that reason, the Bolivarian Republic of\r\nVenezuela favours the promotion of an economic\r\ndevelopment of peoples that is free of external\r\npressures, obstacles or interventions, because that is\r\nthe only effective approach for the peaceful prevention\r\nof conflicts. We do not accept the pretext that these are\r\nso-called humanitarian interventions, nor can we\r\naccept the manipulation of the issue of human rights as\r\nthe reason for imposing on States coercive measures\r\nthat are not in conformity with the Charter.\r\nWe cannot agree with the opinion that the so-\r\ncalled international community — a euphemism that is\r\noften used to present the opinion and the dominant will\r\nof the great Powers and their court of allies — holds a\r\npresumed natural right and responsibility to take direct\r\nactions to protect peoples, in disregard of the borders\r\nand the authority of States. Nor does it hold a direct\r\ninternational guardianship allowing it to take\r\nrepressive action against States and persons presumed\r\nto be the authors of crimes of genocide, ethnic\r\ncleansing, crimes against humanity or, simply, the so-\r\ncalled systematic violation of human rights. That novel\r\nfalse and pernicious institution of guardianship and\r\ninternational responsibility, whose establishment some\r\npropose, as can be inferred from statements we have\r\nheard, would seek to empower the Security Council to\r\ntake coercive measures against States, which always\r\nturn out to be the same ones: developing States and the\r\nStates of the South, which are continually accused of\r\nsystematic violations of human rights. That is done —\r\nor is attempted — through the accumulation of\r\nsuccessive condemnations couched in a series of\r\nresolutions. This then leads to the creation of dossiers\r\non certain States so they can be punished using so-\r\ncalled humanitarian interventions. This all is done with\r\nthe avowed purpose of seeking to ensure the protection\r\nof human security. Human security is another concept\r\nused as a pretext and a camouflage for unjustifiable\r\ninterference in the internal affairs of States.\r\nMy delegation believes that sanctions against\r\nStates should be considered only as a final measure of\r\nlast resort in extreme situations. They must not be used\r\n20\r\nA/60/PV.48\r\nas a concealed means of overthrowing a State’s\r\nlegitimate authority and they must be employed in\r\nstrict accordance with the provisions of the United\r\nNations Charter and international law.\r\nThe fight against terrorism is one of the pillars of\r\nthe foreign policy of the Bolivarian Republic of\r\nVenezuela. The Venezuelan people and Government —\r\nwith one voice — condemn and reject terrorism in all\r\nits forms and manifestations, as a deadly political tool\r\nused to kill and intimidate innocent, weak and helpless\r\npeople anywhere in the world. Terrorism includes the\r\nconsequences for civilian populations — often justified\r\nas collateral damage — resulting from a foreign\r\ninvasion.\r\nAt the same time, we wish to make our position\r\nclear. In our judgement, the legitimate resistance of a\r\npeople against foreign occupation or invasion does not\r\nconstitute terrorism. In our view, a significant,\r\neffective and undeniable component of terrorism can\r\nalso be seen in the daily round of falsehoods,\r\ndistortions and manipulations disseminated by the\r\nnational and international press serving imperialism\r\nand its allies, which conceals, distorts and prevents\r\nclear understanding of the achievements of peoples\r\nwho are exercising their right to self-determination and\r\ncreating their own future by trying to make another\r\nworld possible.\r\nThe Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has\r\ndescribed two instances of terrorism to the Security\r\nCouncil. The first involves the case of a terrorist of\r\nVenezuelan nationality, Luis Posada Carriles, who is\r\nnow in the United States with what appears to be\r\nrefugee status. Posada Carriles is a fugitive from\r\nVenezuelan justice. He escaped from a prison in\r\nVenezuela, where he was being detained and awaiting\r\ntrial for the downing of a Cuban aeroplane that resulted\r\nin the death of 73 crew members and passengers in\r\n1976. Our country has requested extradition from the\r\nGovernment of the United States of America, on the\r\nbasis of the present extradition treaty in force between\r\nour Republic and the United States. To date, there has\r\nbeen no response at all to that request from the\r\nauthorities of the Government of the United States.\r\nThere has only been a prolonged silence, which\r\nappears suspicious.\r\nGiven that undefined situation, we join others in\r\nstating that a terrorist is not just someone who carries\r\nout terrorist acts through his own actions, but also\r\nsomeone who protects terrorists. Our Government\r\nhopes that the steps we have taken to obtain extradition\r\nwill be duly responded to by the Government of the\r\nUnited States of America, in accordance with the\r\nextradition treaty in force and other applicable norms\r\nof international law.\r\nThe second case involves the Reverend Pat\r\nRobertson, who has ties at the highest level to the\r\nRepublican Party, and who has publicly called for the\r\nassassination of our President Hugo Rafael Chávez\r\nFrías. Mr. Robertson has undoubtedly committed a\r\nterrorist act, according to current international law and\r\nresolution 1624 (2005) — recently adopted by the\r\nSecurity Council — which, in its preamble, strongly\r\ncondemns incitement to commit acts of terrorism and\r\nexpresses deep concern that\r\n“incitement of terrorist acts motivated by\r\nextremism and intolerance poses a serious and\r\ngrowing danger to the enjoyment of human\r\nrights, threatens the social and economic\r\ndevelopment of all States, undermines global\r\nstability and prosperity, and must be addressed\r\nurgently and proactively by the United Nations\r\nand all States”.\r\nMoreover, in paragraph 1 that resolution\r\n“Calls upon all States to adopt such\r\nmeasures as may be necessary and appropriate\r\nand in accordance with their obligations under\r\ninternational law to:\r\n(a) Prohibit by law incitement to commit\r\na terrorist act or acts;\r\n(b) Prevent such conduct;\r\n(c) Deny safe haven to any persons with\r\nrespect to whom there is credible and relevant\r\ninformation giving serious reasons for\r\nconsidering that they have been guilty of such\r\nconduct”.\r\nWe do not understand how the Government of the\r\nUnited States of America can allow Mr. Robertson to\r\ncontinue with impunity to make absurd, insane and\r\ndisrespectful comments against the President of a\r\ndemocratic State who has repeatedly been reaffirmed in\r\nhis constitutional mandate by the Venezuelan people.\r\nThe Government of the Bolivarian Republic of\r\nVenezuela has also taken steps aimed at having\r\nMr. Robertson extradited for crimes committed against\r\n21\r\nA/60/PV.48\r\nthe President of the Republic that are covered by the\r\npenal code of Venezuela and international law. Again,\r\nwe hope that, after those steps have been taken, the\r\nformal request for extradition will be duly and\r\ndiligently heeded by the United States authorities.\r\nWe reiterate that under international law it is\r\nprohibited to harbour known terrorists. Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001), in its paragraphs 2 (c)\r\nand 3 (g), prohibits States from providing asylum to\r\nthose who commit acts of terrorism, and disallows\r\nclaims of political motivation as grounds for refusing\r\nrequests for the extradition of terrorists.\r\nMoving on to another matter, namely, the\r\nquestion of equitable representation in the Security\r\nCouncil and the increase in the membership and related\r\nmatters, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela feels\r\nthat the Security Council must enlarge its membership.\r\nHowever, there must also be an increase in the\r\npermanent as well as the non-permanent membership,\r\nwith the inclusion of developing countries among the\r\npermanent members. That would reflect the new\r\ngeopolitical realities in the world and the great need to\r\nhave balance within the Security Council and within\r\nthe Organization.\r\nMoreover, Venezuela believes that the right of\r\nveto should be eliminated, so that we can move\r\nforward towards democratizing the Organization.\r\nReform of the Council must be considered alongside\r\nother themes to be discussed in the General Assembly.\r\nAmong such themes, national development is a priority\r\nmatter for our country, a problem of crucial importance\r\nfor the national security of our country and other\r\ncountries as well.\r\nOur delegation believes that improving the\r\nworking methods of the Security Council will not\r\nprovide a panacea or remedy for dealing with the\r\nobjectionable activities of that body, nor will it ensure\r\nfull transparency. Using the Arria formula, which has\r\nbeen referred to recently in this Hall, is only another\r\nway to hide or obscure the lack of transparency\r\nthrough a supposed consultation with representatives\r\nof civil society, where no one really knows who they\r\nare nor what interests they really represent.\r\nTo discuss working methods as a priority matter\r\nis simply a means of disregarding the main question,\r\nnamely, the progressive erosion of the Council’s\r\ncredibility and its lack of legitimacy, as its present\r\nwork shows. Thus, the great need to make that body\r\nmore democratic again becomes apparent.\r\nFinally, my Republic is not in favour of creating\r\nnew United Nations bodies in which the presence and\r\ndecisive pre-eminence of permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council would be reaffirmed to the detriment\r\nof the rights of other Member States to participate on\r\nan equal footing in those bodies.\r\nSir Emyr Jones Parry (United Kingdom): May\r\nI, at the outset, express on behalf of the United\r\nKingdom our deepest sympathy to the people and\r\nGovernments of Jordan and Iraq and to the families\r\nand friends of the victims of the indiscriminate attacks,\r\nwhich we condemn in the strongest terms.\r\nIn his introduction of the annual report of the\r\nSecurity Council, Ambassador Denisov has highlighted\r\nseveral key achievements of the Council this year. I\r\nwould like to add to those listed by him the adoption,\r\nin the margins of the United Nations summit, two\r\nimportant resolutions. The first of these calls on all\r\nUnited Nations Members to act to stop incitement to\r\nterrorism; the second provides the basis for a more\r\ncomprehensive and coherent approach to the\r\nprevention of conflict, particularly in Africa.\r\nI shall concentrate my remarks now on what more\r\ncan and should be done to make the Security Council\r\nmore broadly representative, efficient and transparent.\r\nThe United Kingdom is an active member of the Open-\r\nended Working Group on Security Council reform. We\r\nhave long supported adding new permanent and non-\r\npermanent members, including Germany, Japan, India\r\nand Brazil as permanent members, as well as increased\r\npermanent representation for Africa.\r\nWe also want to see improvements in the\r\nCouncil’s working methods, as recommended in the\r\nsummit outcome document — that is, increased\r\ntransparency and accountability. We recognize that\r\nother United Nations Members want this too, as is\r\nclear from this debate and the various contributions to\r\nit. The United Kingdom recognizes that it falls to the\r\nSecurity Council, as the summit agreed, to continue to\r\nadapt its own working methods, and we believe this\r\nprocess should indeed continue as part of our\r\ncommitment to summit implementation.\r\nSo, let me set out three areas where the United\r\nKingdom particularly wants to see continuing\r\nimprovements. First of all is the issue of transparency.\r\n22\r\nA/60/PV.48\r\nThe Council should involve non-members more, for\r\nexample, through informal, Arria-style meetings,\r\ncontacts with civil society, including during Council\r\nmissions, and more dialogue with troop-contributing\r\ncountries. A recent useful example, in our view, was\r\nthe meeting of the Council’s Working Group on\r\nPeacekeeping Operations with troop contributors to the\r\nUnited Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea, which\r\nincluded a substantial and thoughtful debate about the\r\nimmediate and underlying issues facing that Mission\r\ntoday.\r\nSecondly, there is the area of consultation. The\r\nCouncil should engage more in dialogue with non-\r\nCouncil members and other experts, both to build up\r\ngreater expertise and to respond to others’ concerns.\r\nAmbassador Denisov has mentioned increased\r\ndialogue between sanctions committees and interested\r\ncountries. We should build on this in other areas.\r\nAnother welcome development is increased\r\ncoordination with regional and subregional\r\norganizations on conflict prevention, peacekeeping and\r\npeacebuilding, and in the fight against terrorism. We\r\nsee the Peacebuilding Commission as an opportunity to\r\nensure that the Council gets coordinated advice, taking\r\nfull account of the views of major donors, regional\r\norganizations, troop contributors and others, especially\r\nthose interested in a particular country’s situation. This\r\nshould improve the Council’s own decision-making in\r\npeacebuilding by enabling it to be informed by advice\r\nacross the range of peacebuilding issues.\r\nThirdly, there is the matter of efficiency. The\r\nUnited Kingdom wants to find ways to simplify and\r\nrationalize the work of the Council, including the\r\nCouncil’s growing number of subsidiary bodies, so it\r\ncan avoid duplication and concentrate its efforts where\r\nthey matter most.\r\nWe look forward, therefore, to the views of\r\nincoming Security Council members on these issues;\r\ntheir new ideas will be valued. Indeed, the Council\r\nowes many of its innovations, like Arria-formula\r\nmeetings, to past members.\r\nThe Council has had a sad burden of responding\r\nto the continued number of terrorist attacks against\r\nMember States of the United Nations. Terrorism,\r\ntherefore, remains at the centre of the Council’s work.\r\nWe are conscious of the summit’s encouragement to the\r\nCouncil to consider reform in this area, too, in\r\nparticular how to strengthen its monitoring and\r\nenforcement role in counter-terrorism, including by\r\nconsolidating reporting requirements, while respecting\r\nthe different mandates of the counter-terrorism\r\nsubsidiary bodies. Recommendations were also made\r\nto improve the monitoring of the effects of sanctions\r\nand to ensure that fair and clear procedures exist for\r\nplacing individuals and entities on sanctions lists and\r\nfor removing them, as well as for granting\r\nhumanitarian exemptions.\r\nThe Council has already begun to examine how it\r\ncan respond to those and other suggestions. The United\r\nKingdom hopes the coming year will see at least some\r\nof these proposals implemented, and the Council’s\r\nworking methods invigorated, in the interests of greater\r\neffectiveness and impact. We intend, therefore, to work\r\nclosely with others, both Council members and non-\r\nCouncil members, in order to achieve this.\r\nPrince Zeid Ra’ad Zeid Al-Hussein (Jordan)\r\n(spoke in Arabic): At the outset, Sir, I would like to\r\nthank the Bureau and the General Assembly members\r\nfor the noble sentiments expressed to us as a result of\r\nthe terrorist crimes that were committed yesterday in\r\nAmman. We will never forget how the members have\r\nstood by our side at this critical moment.\r\nThe United Nations reform process is established\r\nand continuous. This has been demonstrated through\r\nMember States’ support of the conclusions of the\r\noutcome document (resolution 60/1) of the summit that\r\nopened the sixtieth session of the General Assembly.\r\nToday, before this General Assembly, we are trying to\r\ncontribute to the implementation of the objectives of\r\nthat document and to deal with one of the main issues\r\nof common interest, the working methods and\r\nmachinery of the Security Council.\r\nDespite the fact that I have already expressed\r\nJordan’s position on the question of Security Council\r\nreform, a matter without which the comprehensive\r\nreform of the United Nations cannot be completed, I\r\nwould like to renew our commitment to the necessary\r\nexpansion of Security Council membership in both the\r\npermanent and non-permanent categories and our\r\nsupport for the draft resolution that was submitted to\r\nthe General Assembly last August on that reform and\r\nexpansion.\r\nHowever, we still believe that the said draft\r\nresolution does not comprehensively address the\r\nquestion of developing and strengthening the Council’s\r\nworking methods. Therefore, we are convinced today\r\n23\r\nA/60/PV.48\r\nthat, owing to the importance of this issue, we have to\r\ndeal with this question in a separate, specific and\r\ncomprehensive resolution. Jordan therefore completely\r\nsupports the draft resolution that has been distributed\r\non the development of the working methods of the\r\nSecurity Council. We have contributed to it, and,\r\ntogether with Switzerland, Costa Rica, Liechtenstein\r\nand Singapore, we were among the original sponsors.\r\nWe are fully convinced that the draft resolution on the\r\ndevelopment of the working methods of the Security\r\nCouncil represents a positive step in the right direction\r\non the way to comprehensive reform within the\r\nframework of the United Nations.\r\nWe must contribute to improved implementation\r\nof practical and specific proposals to achieve our\r\nshared goals with respect to the need for the Security\r\nCouncil to consider questions in a comprehensive\r\nmanner, with respect to the Council’s accountability\r\nand legitimacy and with respect to the transparency of\r\nits work. All those factors contribute to strengthening\r\nthe effectiveness of the Security Council. Improving\r\nthe Council’s working methods and mechanisms is not\r\nan end in itself but a means of contributing to the\r\nlarger goal of reforming the United Nations.\r\nMr. Mra (Myanmar): First, I would like to\r\nconvey the deepest sympathies of my delegation to the\r\nGovernment and the people of Jordan, as well as to the\r\ninjured, in connection with the terrorist bombings in\r\nAmman. We cannot condone those heinous acts.\r\nI express our deep appreciation to the President\r\nof the Security Council for the current month,\r\nAmbassador Andrey Denisov of the Russian\r\nFederation, for introducing the report of the Council\r\ncovering the period from 1 August 2004 to 31 July\r\n2005 (A/60/2). I should also like to commend the\r\nexcellent work done by the President of the General\r\nAssembly at its previous session, Mr. Jean Ping, and\r\nhis Vice-Chairpersons in guiding the work of the Open-\r\nended Working Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of\r\nthe Security Council and Other Matters related to the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nThe Security Council is entrusted by Member\r\nStates with the primary responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security and\r\nwith a mandate to act on their behalf. We are of the\r\nview that, by virtue of the Article 24, paragraph 1, of\r\nthe Charter, the Security Council is accountable to the\r\nGeneral Assembly. It is thus most appropriate that\r\nMember States are given this rightful opportunity to\r\nreview the work undertaken by the Council during the\r\nreporting period. This is a time for reflection on the\r\nSecurity Council’s performance. During our debate on\r\nthe interrelated reports of the Security Council and of\r\nthe Open-ended Working Group (A/59/47), we need to\r\nexamine the way the Security Council has carried out\r\nits mandate and how we can make the Council more\r\nrepresentative. We should also look at ways and means\r\nto improve its working methods.\r\nWe had high hopes that the 2005 world summit\r\nwould bring significant improvements in our approach\r\nto the question of equitable representation on and\r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council.\r\nHowever, we regret that no significant result was\r\nreached at the recent world summit in that important\r\narea of Security Council reform. However, at the\r\nsummit, leaders agreed that the early reform of the\r\nSecurity Council is an essential element of our overall\r\neffort to reform the United Nations in order to make it\r\nmore broadly representative, efficient and transparent\r\nand thus further enhance its effectiveness and the\r\nlegitimacy and implementation of its decisions. In\r\naccordance with the commitments made by our leaders,\r\nwe must continue our efforts to that end.\r\nMy delegation has stated its position on reform of\r\nthe Security Council on several occasions. We share\r\nthe common view that the United Nations must be\r\nreformed in order to reflect the global realities of\r\ntoday, the increased membership of the United Nations\r\nand the need for broader representation based on\r\nequitable distribution, mutual benefit and cooperation.\r\nIf the Security Council is to be more representative of\r\ncontemporary political and economic realities, it\r\nshould be expanded in both the permanent and the non-\r\npermanent categories.\r\nIf agreement can be reached, expansion of the\r\nCouncil’s membership will make it more\r\nrepresentative. However, expansion alone may not\r\nfully ensure the Council’s effectiveness or\r\ntransparency. We therefore believe that Security\r\nCouncil reform must also place special emphasis on\r\nfurther improvements to the Council’s working\r\nmethods and decision-making process in order to make\r\nits work more transparent and more democratic, so that\r\nit can better serve the interest of the entire membership\r\nof the Organization.\r\n24\r\nA/60/PV.48\r\nMy delegation therefore welcomes paragraph 154\r\nof the 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1),\r\nwhich recommends that the Security Council adapt its\r\nworking methods so as to increase the involvement of\r\nStates not members of the Council in its work, enhance\r\nits accountability to the membership and increase the\r\ntransparency of its work.\r\nIn that regard, my delegation is deeply\r\nappreciative of a number of initiatives taken by the\r\nCouncil in recent years to promote its transparency,\r\nsuch as the increase in the number of public meetings,\r\nthe enhancement of communication and cooperation\r\nwith troop-contributing countries, the delivery of press\r\nstatements by the President of the Security Council and\r\nthe regular holding of joint meetings among the\r\nPresidents of the Security Council, the General\r\nAssembly and the Economic and Social Council.\r\nThe Council’s frequent convening of open\r\ndebates is a step forward in enhancing the involvement\r\nof the larger membership, because it gives States not\r\nmembers of the Security Council a valuable\r\nopportunity to express their views on matters affecting\r\nthem and the Organization. Such open debates would\r\nbe more effective if the resolutions and decisions\r\nadopted by the Council took into account the views\r\nraised in those debates by States not members of the\r\nCouncil.\r\nBecause the non-permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council represent their respective regional\r\ngroups, they should keep their regional groups\r\ninformed of developments in the Security Council. In\r\nthat regard, my delegation welcomes the recent\r\nbriefings given by Security Council members, in\r\nparticular the briefings by Japan and the Philippines for\r\nthe members of the Asian Group on the work done\r\nduring their respective presidencies of the Council.\r\nSuch briefings are extremely useful and valuable for\r\nStates not members of the Security Council. It would\r\nbe even more beneficial if Security Council members\r\nalso held consultations with their respective regional\r\ngroups before the Council adopted a draft resolution.\r\nMy delegation has also noted the gradual increase\r\nin both the volume and the scope of the work of the\r\nSecurity Council. My delegation shares the growing\r\nconcern at the Security Council’s gradual\r\nencroachment on the powers and the mandate of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. Over the years, there has been a\r\ngrowing tendency to hold Security Council discussions\r\non thematic issues that have traditionally been\r\nconsidered by other organs of the United Nations.\r\nThematic discussions can be fruitful only when they\r\nare directly related to the Council’s mandate.\r\nMore worrisome is the Security Council’s\r\ntendency towards increasing involvement in work of a\r\nlegislative nature, which has traditionally been under\r\nthe domain of the international multilateral instruments\r\nadopted following a thorough negotiation process\r\ninvolving all States Members of the United Nations.\r\nMy delegation deeply appreciates the work done\r\nby the Security Council on issues that are directly\r\nrelated to the Council’s mandate. At the same time, it is\r\nof paramount importance that members of the Council\r\nact strictly in accordance with the purposes and the\r\nprinciples of the Charter and that they resist any\r\nattempt to take up issues that do not pose a real threat\r\nto international or regional peace and security.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation wishes to express\r\nits hope that, under the new chairmanship, the Working\r\nGroup will continue to exert efforts to achieve further\r\nprogress on the outstanding issues concerning the\r\nquestion of equitable representation on and increase in\r\nthe membership of the Security Council and other\r\nmatters related to the Security Council.\r\nMr. Hannesson (Iceland): Like colleagues who\r\nhave preceded me, I condemn the terrorist attacks\r\nyesterday in Amman in the strongest terms. On behalf\r\nof the Government and the people of Iceland, I convey\r\nour profound condolences to the Government and the\r\npeople of Jordan and, in particular, to those who lost\r\nfamily members and those who were injured.\r\nAt the outset, I would like to thank the President\r\nof the Security Council for the month of November for\r\nintroducing the report of the Security Council to the\r\nGeneral Assembly (A/60/2). The report reflects the\r\ncontinued increase in the volume and the scope of the\r\nactivities of the Council. I will, however, limit my\r\nshort statement to the issue of reform of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nWith respect to the working methods of the\r\nSecurity Council, Iceland has consistently supported\r\ncalls for increased transparency in the work of the\r\nSecurity Council. That implies more openness,\r\nproactive communication and strengthened\r\naccountability. Some substantive steps have been made\r\nin that regard, such as the growing practice of open\r\n25\r\nA/60/PV.48\r\nbriefings, meetings and debates of the Security\r\nCouncil, which we welcome. The open debates can\r\nserve as an important tool for communication among\r\nthe Security Council, the wider United Nations\r\nmembership and international civil society.\r\nIceland agrees with the Secretary-General that\r\neffective reform of the United Nations entails reform\r\nof the Security Council. Iceland has advocated a more\r\nrepresentative and legitimate Council that better\r\nmirrors today’s geopolitical realities. We are of the\r\nview that there should be an expansion of both the\r\npermanent and the non-permanent membership of the\r\nCouncil. Changes are long overdue. During the general\r\ndebate in September, the Foreign Minister of Iceland\r\nexpressed disappointment that the Group of Four\r\nproposal for reforming the Security Council seemed\r\nnot to have the support it deserved: “While not perfect,\r\nit remains the most practical basis for reforming the\r\nCouncil. That approach therefore continues to have\r\nIceland’s firm support” (A/60/PV.16, p.6).\r\nIndeed, Iceland was one of the sponsors of that\r\nproposal, draft resolution A/59/L.64, introduced last\r\nJuly at the fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly.\r\nIn our view, that proposal continues to be pertinent and\r\nrelevant. Consensus on the expansion of the Security\r\nCouncil is desirable, but, after more than 12 years of\r\ndebate, we all know that it is not reachable. We should\r\nuse the democratic decision-making power at the\r\ndisposal of the General Assembly.\r\nFinally, I would like to take this opportunity to\r\nwelcome the establishment of Security Council Report,\r\nan independent not-for-profit organization affiliated\r\nwith the Columbia University Center on International\r\nOrganization, which aims to provide consistent,\r\nanalytical information to the public on the activities of\r\nthe Security Council. I believe that this initiative will\r\nbe especially beneficial for smaller delegations.\r\nMs. Banks (New Zealand): First, I extend New\r\nZealand’s sincere sympathy to the people and the\r\nGovernment of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan\r\nfollowing the tragic bombings yesterday in Amman.\r\nI would like to join others in welcoming both the\r\nreport of the Security Council (A/60/2) and the report\r\nof the Open-ended Working Group on Council reform\r\n(A/59/47). As Ambassador Denisov made clear this\r\nmorning, the pressures on the Council are considerable.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to recognize the\r\nefforts of Council members in managing an ever more\r\ncomplex and demanding agenda.\r\nThe report of the Security Council highlights the\r\ncontinued increase in the volume and the scope of that\r\nagenda. That in itself makes it all the more important\r\nthat we have transparency in the Council’s\r\nproceedings. Given the far-reaching implications of\r\nCouncil decisions, the membership needs to understand\r\nwhat decisions are being taken in the Council and why.\r\nWhile there have been some improvements over the\r\nyears, there are still too few practical and effective\r\nmechanisms for interacting with the Council on key\r\nissues. And even where discussions do take place,\r\nMember States often feel that their views are not taken\r\ninto account.\r\nOur challenge is to resolve those concerns in a\r\nway that allows the Council to do its work quickly and\r\nefficiently and at the same time gives Member States\r\ngreater confidence in the Council’s decisions.\r\nLike others, New Zealand sees a need for some\r\nbasic changes in the Council’s working methods. First,\r\nwhile structured open debates provide a good\r\nopportunity to put views on record, we would like to\r\nsee greater use made of smaller, informal meetings in\r\nwhich the Council and the membership can discuss\r\nparticular issues. The regional meetings arranged\r\nduring the negotiation of Security Council resolution\r\n1540 (2004) set a good precedent, as do the regular\r\nbriefings that some Council members hold for their\r\nregional groups.\r\nWe would also like to see more extensive use\r\nmade of drafting groups that include Member States\r\nnot currently serving on the Council. That has been\r\ndone successfully on issues such as Kosovo, Timor-\r\nLeste and Afghanistan. Similarly, we ask that the\r\nSecurity Council’s subsidiary bodies consider\r\ninvolving non-Council members in their work. That\r\nwould have the benefit of assisting the Council with its\r\nworkload as well as enhancing transparency and adding\r\nto the Council’s range of expertise. We ask too that the\r\nCouncil be made much more responsive to the interests\r\nand the views of troop-contributing countries with\r\nrespect to the establishment, conduct and review of\r\npeacekeeping operations.\r\nOn the important issue of consultation, we would\r\nrequest the Council to look carefully at the capacity of\r\nMember States when considering new compulsory\r\nmeasures. As noted this morning by Barbados, on\r\n26\r\nA/60/PV.48\r\nbehalf of the Caribbean Community, while there are\r\noften compelling reasons for placing urgent and far-\r\nreaching requirements on Member States, such as the\r\ncounter-terrorism measures, due attention needs to be\r\npaid to the ability of Member States to meet those\r\nrequirements. In our view, the Council needs to have\r\nan open and inclusive dialogue with all Member States\r\nto ensure that the compliance burdens are realistic and\r\nmanageable. We have raised that concern previously\r\nwith respect to the impact of those requirements, for\r\ninstance, on our Pacific neighbours. We welcome the\r\nrecent focus of the Al-Qaida and Taliban sanctions\r\nCommittee, the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC)\r\nand the Security Council Committee established\r\npursuant to resolution 1540 (2004) on providing\r\ntechnical assistance to developing States, and we hope\r\nthat creative ways can be found to address the\r\nchallenging reporting requirements involved.\r\nWe remain concerned that Council action on\r\nsome issues has not been possible because of the use of\r\na single veto or a silent veto. There were several\r\noccasions in the past year when delays or complete\r\ninaction occurred despite overwhelming international\r\nsupport in favour of the Council taking action. We\r\nregret the situation and once again would like to put on\r\nrecord our unequivocal opposition to the veto, both\r\nwith respect to current permanent members of the\r\nCouncil and any potential future members.\r\nAs a final point on working methods, I would\r\nparticularly like to welcome the draft resolution\r\ncirculated informally last week by Switzerland, Costa\r\nRica, Jordan, Singapore and Liechtenstein. The draft\r\ntouches on many of the points I have made and we very\r\nmuch hope that it will stimulate an open and\r\nconstructive discussion among the membership on\r\nstrengthening the work of the Council.\r\nFinally, a word on Security Council expansion.\r\nAt the world summit, leaders supported early reform of\r\nthe Security Council. They committed themselves to\r\ncontinuing efforts to achieve a decision on the issue.\r\nNew Zealand welcomes that commitment. We are of\r\nthe view that the Security Council should be more\r\nbroadly representative, effective and transparent. We\r\nbelieve that any expansion of the Council must include\r\nJapan.\r\nMr. Pleuger (Germany): Let me begin by\r\ncondemning in the strongest terms the heinous terrorist\r\nacts committed in Amman, and expressing our heartfelt\r\ncondolences to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and\r\nto the families of the victims.\r\nWe are grateful for the President’s decision to\r\nschedule this debate on Security Council reform\r\nalongside our discussions on other pressing reform\r\ntopics, such as management reform, the Human Rights\r\nCouncil and the Peacebuilding Commission. That\r\nclearly confirms the conviction expressed by our heads\r\nof State in the outcome document, that Security\r\nCouncil reform is an essential part of overall reform.\r\nThe recent general debate in the General\r\nAssembly also reflected that view, as did the Secretary-\r\nGeneral when he stated that no United Nations reform\r\ncan be complete without Security Council reform.\r\nAround 140 speakers made a point of stressing the\r\nneed for Council reform in that debate. Obviously, the\r\nissue is going to stay on our agenda, because the need\r\nfor action is so widely recognized. We will not make\r\nthe problem go away just by waiting. Action is needed,\r\nand action there will be.\r\nThe G-4 have presented a comprehensive\r\nproposal that will basically do four things. First, it will\r\nincrease the legitimacy, transparency and effectiveness\r\nof the Council. Secondly, it will ensure the\r\nparticipation of major contributors to the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security. Thirdly, it will\r\nensure equitable representation of developing countries\r\nand of Southern Hemisphere nations in the Council,\r\nand fourthly, it will improve the Council’s working\r\nmethods.\r\nWe continue to believe — and we fully share\r\nwhat has just been stated by the Ambassador of\r\nIceland — that our proposal is the one that most\r\ncomprehensively addresses the reform needs of the\r\nCouncil. Naturally, and let me stress again, we remain\r\nopen to discussing amendments and other proposals\r\nthat could improve our proposal in its substance and\r\nthat could broaden the basis of support for reform.\r\nThere are also other proposals being discussed,\r\nsuch as the African Union resolution and the proposal\r\non working methods presented by five countries. They\r\nall demonstrate the continuing interest in reform and\r\ncontribute to the dynamics of the reform process. The\r\nAfrican Union model, in fact, is very close to the G-4\r\nproposal. In the last General Assembly, the African\r\nUnion could not put its resolution to the test or\r\nconsider a compromise with the G-4 because it needed\r\nmore time to consolidate its position. Now, we\r\n27\r\nA/60/PV.48\r\nunderstand that at its summit in Addis Ababa in\r\nOctober, the African Union decided to take action on\r\nthis issue. We welcome that decision and hope it will\r\npave the way for a decision on Security Council\r\nreform.\r\nLet me now turn to a question which has come up\r\nrecently: should we approach Security Council reform\r\nby stages, in a piecemeal manner? Our opinion is,\r\nclearly, no. Only a reform proposal addressing all\r\nmajor facets will be able to deliver satisfactory results.\r\nWe want neither an enlarged Council that does\r\nnot change its ways, nor recommendations for working\r\nmethods reform that look good on paper but will not be\r\nimplemented in a Council that remains structurally the\r\nsame. For 60 years the Council has worked with\r\nprovisional rules of procedure. How could we expect it\r\nto modernize its working methods now if its\r\ncomposition remains the same?\r\nIn order to reform the Council’s working\r\nmethods, we need a structural change in the balance of\r\npower of the Council. To achieve that, we need to\r\nincrease the numbers of both permanent and non-\r\npermanent members. New permanent members would\r\nbe bound by political commitments they have made in\r\nthe process of Security Council reform. They know\r\nfrom their experience as non-members and as elected\r\nmembers of the Council what the justifiable and\r\nlegitimate needs of the membership outside of the\r\nCouncil are — in particular, more transparency, more\r\ninclusiveness and accountability. This group, therefore,\r\nconstitutes the best instrument to bring about change.\r\nThat is why we think it is neither useful nor realistic to\r\nseparate cluster I from cluster II issues.\r\nIt has become clear to all of us that there is no\r\nconsensus on Security Council reform and that there\r\nwill be none in the future. A vote therefore is\r\nunavoidable. It is obvious that all those who oppose a\r\nvote in fact want to prevent Security Council reform\r\nfrom happening. I would like to ask all those who warn\r\nagainst a vote on this crucial issue how they reconcile\r\ntheir stand with the clear demand in the outcome\r\ndocument for results in reforming the Council.\r\nThere is another contradiction. Some members of\r\nthe so-called Uniting for Consensus group, who always\r\nopposed a vote, now support a draft resolution on\r\ncluster II issues and eventually intend to put that to the\r\nvote. There is evidently no more consensus on working\r\nmethods than on enlargement. If a vote on one is\r\nadvocated, then we feel a vote on the other should be\r\naccepted as well.\r\nLast week, our colleague and my friend, the\r\nAmbassador of Pakistan, compared the United Nations\r\nto an old and leaky sailboat that we are trying to repair\r\nin mid-voyage. He proposed that we do what we can on\r\nnecessary repairs, but not rock and capsize the boat by\r\ntackling everything at once. I think the comparison\r\nwith a boat at sea is very apt, only I draw a different\r\nconclusion from the metaphor: if we find ourselves\r\nsailing in a vessel that has a number of leaks, I would\r\nadvise repairing all of those and not leaving one of the\r\nbiggest leaks open to take in water. I would also advise\r\nusing all the tools available for repairs. The vote is an\r\neffective tool, and we should use it.\r\nThere are those who worry that an increase in the\r\nmembership of the Council might diminish its\r\neffectiveness. But effectiveness is not exclusively a\r\nfunction of the decision-making procedure, that is, how\r\neasily the necessary majority vote is obtained for a\r\nresolution. Effectiveness is determined also by the\r\nlegitimacy of a body, just as much as by the number of\r\nits members. If the membership of a body adequately\r\nreflects today’s political realities, if it incorporates the\r\nperspective of all world regions and if it includes those\r\nin its decision-making who will contribute the most to\r\nthe implementation of resolutions — only then will you\r\nhave a body that is efficient both in taking decisions\r\nand in implementing them.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6 p.m.\r\n"
