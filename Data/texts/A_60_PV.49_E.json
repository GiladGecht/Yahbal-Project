(Sweden)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Hamidon\r\n(Malaysia), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda items 9 and 117 (continued)\r\nReport of the Security Council (A/60/2)\r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and increase\r\nin the membership of the Security Council and\r\nrelated matters\r\nMr. Kuchinsky (Ukraine): First, I would like to\r\nexpress our gratitude to the President of the Security\r\nCouncil for the month of November, Ambassador\r\nAndrey Denisov of the Russian Federation, for his\r\ncomprehensive presentation of the annual report of the\r\nCouncil to the General Assembly. We are encouraged\r\nby the attention paid in the presentation to the increase\r\nin the transparency of the Council’s activities and in\r\nthe improvement of its working methods, in particular\r\nin the triangular relationship between the Security\r\nCouncil, the United Nations Secretariat and troop-\r\ncontributing countries.\r\nThe period under review was indeed very\r\neventful for the United Nations and, therefore, for the\r\nSecurity Council, as its nerve centre. Constant threats\r\nand challenges, having no respect for the United\r\nNations sixtieth anniversary, continued to challenge the\r\ndurability of the system of international peace and\r\nsecurity guarded by the Organization, more than ever\r\nrequiring urgent and resolute action by the Security\r\nCouncil. How, then, did the body entrusted with the\r\nprimary responsibility to keep the peace address those\r\nchallenges during that period? Let me try to answer\r\nthat question, which I believe is of the utmost\r\nimportance for all of us.\r\nWithout any doubt, international terrorism\r\nremains one of the greatest threats to international\r\npeace and security. In that connection, I would like to\r\nadd Ukraine’s voice to the unanimous strong\r\ncondemnation of the terrorist bombings in Amman, and\r\nto convey our deepest sympathy and condolences to the\r\nvictims of those heinous attacks and their families, and\r\nto the people and the Government of Jordan.\r\nUkraine is convinced that the Security Council\r\nshould continue to use its unique potential to mobilize\r\nthe international community to fight the scourge of\r\nterrorism. We welcome the steps taken by the Security\r\nCouncil in that direction, in particular through its\r\nresolution 1624 (2005). The Counter-Terrorism\r\nCommittee should continue to be a crucial instrument\r\nin the hands of nations to combat, and ultimately\r\neliminate, terrorism. We believe that early adoption of\r\na comprehensive convention to combat terrorism will\r\ngreatly facilitate the Council’s efforts in that crucial\r\narea.\r\nThe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\r\ncontinues to be another issue posing a major threat to\r\nthe system of collective security. The Council must\r\ncontinue to play its role in multilateral efforts to\r\nstrengthen the non-proliferation regime. We welcome\r\n2\r\nA/60/PV.49\r\nthe progress made in the implementation of Council\r\nresolution 1540 (2004), as well as in the work of the\r\nSecurity Council Committee established pursuant to\r\nthat resolution. At this stage it is important to provide\r\nassistance to States, including through the Committee,\r\nto ensure the proper implementation of that important\r\nresolution.\r\nThis year the Security Council has shown unity in\r\naddressing the situation in Iraq. We firmly believe that\r\nthe Council’s instruments are very important for\r\nnormalizing the situation in that country. It is important\r\nfor the Council to ensure the effective implementation\r\nof the existing timetable for a comprehensive political\r\ntransition process in the country, namely, through\r\nholding free and democratic elections in December and\r\nthrough the formation of a permanent Government of\r\nIraq.\r\nThe work of the Council with regard to\r\nAfghanistan should be commended. We are\r\nnevertheless convinced that the main responsibility for\r\nfinding a political solution to the Afghan issue lies\r\nwith the Afghan people themselves. The Council\r\nshould continue to be actively involved in all clusters\r\nof the Afghan problem. There still remains a pressing\r\nneed for continued international security assistance in\r\nAfghanistan.\r\nMy delegation commends the Council’s efforts in\r\nthe Middle East peace process. Resolution 1515 (2003)\r\nreflects the wide consensus within the international\r\ncommunity on how best to achieve the existence of two\r\nStates, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace\r\nand security. With its endorsement of the Quartet’s\r\nroad map, that resolution was an important step\r\ntowards the beginning of Israel’s withdrawal from\r\nGaza and from parts of the northern West Bank. We\r\nbelieve that successful disengagement can be the first\r\nstep towards the resumption of the peace process.\r\nWe hope that the Council will urge the relevant\r\nparties to cooperate sincerely and fully with the United\r\nNations International Independent Investigation\r\nCommission, which in accordance with Council\r\nresolutions 1595 (2005) and 1636 (2005), is assisting\r\nthe Lebanese authorities in their investigation of the\r\nassassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik\r\nHariri.\r\nThe unfolding status talks in the Balkans give us\r\na hope for an early settlement of the daunting Kosovo\r\nissue. The Security Council has played its role in the\r\ncommencement of that process, and I am confident in\r\nmy belief that it should continue its active engagement\r\nand support at this stage and in the next and decisive\r\nphase of implementation of resolution 1244 (1999).\r\nUkraine welcomes the continued active\r\nengagement of the Council with regard to conflict\r\nresolution in Africa. We especially support and\r\nwelcome the trend towards increased use of African-\r\nowned mechanisms in that area. Ukraine took positive\r\nnote of the declaration on conflict prevention,\r\nparticularly in Africa (Security Council resolution 1625\r\n(2005), annex), which was adopted at the Council\r\nsummit in September. The implementation of that\r\nimportant document will logically build upon the\r\noutcome of the 2000 Security Council summit on\r\nensuring an effective role for the Council in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security,\r\nparticularly in Africa (Security Council resolution 1318\r\n(2000)). I wish to recall once again that that was done\r\non the initiative of my country.\r\nWe welcome the trend towards further\r\nstrengthening the cooperation between the Security\r\nCouncil and regional organizations. There have been\r\nquite a few encouraging examples over the past decade\r\nof how United Nations peacekeeping missions can be\r\neffectively supported and complemented by United\r\nNations-mandated operations of other organizations.\r\nThe United Nations could, and should, actively use that\r\nimportant tool and rely increasingly on the potential of\r\nregional structures.\r\nLet me now turn to an issue that, whatever its\r\nfundamental importance in itself, has further\r\ngalvanized the international situation in the context of\r\nthe September summit. I am of course referring to\r\nSecurity Council reform. Ukraine considers reform of\r\nthe Security Council to be of exceptional international\r\nsignificance. Making that body more representative\r\nand balanced, and its work more effective and\r\ntransparent, especially with regard to the decision-\r\nmaking process, is vital for adapting the United\r\nNations to the realities of the twenty-first century. Our\r\noverall approach to the issue is based on the following\r\npillars.\r\nSecurity Council reform should be implemented\r\nin strict compliance with the purposes and principles of\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. The enlargement of\r\nthe Council should be carried out in both categories of\r\nmembership, permanent and non-permanent. We\r\n3\r\nA/60/PV.49\r\nsupport increased representation in that body for\r\ndeveloping countries from Africa, Asia, Latin America\r\nand the Caribbean.\r\nSince the membership of the Group of Eastern\r\nEuropean States has doubled over the last decade, it\r\nshould have an additional non-permanent seat in the\r\nCouncil.\r\nThe Security Council’s structural reform and the\r\nimprovement of its working methods should go hand in\r\nhand. In particular, those countries that contribute the\r\nmost to the Organization — militarily, diplomatically\r\nand financially — should be more involved in the\r\nCouncil’s decision-making process.\r\nUkraine has consistently supported the limitation\r\nof the use of the veto by the Security Council\r\npermanent five. We believe that Council enlargement is\r\nan integral part of the comprehensive United Nations\r\nreform agenda aimed at enabling it to effectively react\r\nto the challenges and opportunities of today’s world, in\r\nthe security, development and human rights fields\r\nalike. That agenda encompasses such crucial elements\r\nas revitalization of the General Assembly;\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations human rights\r\nmechanisms through the establishment of the Human\r\nRights Council; reform of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil; establishment of the Peacebuilding\r\nCommission; and, of course, management reform.\r\nIt is regrettable that the quantity of debates held\r\nand options proposed on Security Council reform on\r\nthe eve of, and during, the September summit did not\r\ntranslate into quality results. Still, we hope that the\r\nmomentum will be maintained and, hopefully, lead to\r\nearly reform in this area — so vital to our\r\nOrganization — as sought in the outcome document of\r\nthe summit. Ukraine remains fully committed to that\r\nobjective.\r\nMr. Grey-Johnson (Gambia): The report of the\r\nSecurity Council for the period 1 August 2004 to\r\n31 July 2005 shows that progress has been achieved in\r\ntackling problems related to peace and security in some\r\ncountries and regions of the world. It thus lays down\r\nthe building blocks for concerted action aimed at\r\nachieving even more in the year ahead. My delegation\r\nwould have liked to have seen a more extensive\r\nanalysis of the Council’s activities that could have been\r\nthe basis for improvements in future.\r\nWe all were encouraged by the positive\r\ndevelopments in the Middle East and the bold and\r\ncourageous initiatives taken by both the Israeli and the\r\nPalestinian leaderships towards resolving some of the\r\nintractable problems at the root of the conflict between\r\nthe two neighbours. That led us to believe that efforts\r\nin the context of the road map were, in fact, on course\r\ntowards the realization of the vision of the two States\r\nliving side by side in peace. Alas, the developments\r\nsince have been threatening those gains and require\r\nthat the Security Council once more be purposeful and\r\ninnovative in ensuring that all concerned remain\r\nsteadfast towards the attainment of the objectives of\r\npeace. This long-running conflict has created ripples\r\nthat have caused much damage throughout the world. It\r\nis in our collective interest, therefore, that an early and\r\ndurable solution be found.\r\nElsewhere in the Middle East, tensions are either\r\nescalating or are brewing dangerously. The situation in\r\nIraq is not abating. On the contrary, the scale of\r\nviolence appears to be increasing from day to day, with\r\nuntold suffering and loss of life and limb among\r\ninnocent Iraqi civilians. My delegation urges all\r\nconcerned to begin considering less confrontational\r\nand militaristic approaches to the resolution of the\r\nconflict in that country. There are clear early warning\r\nsigns of an impending explosion in neighbouring\r\ncountries. My delegation strongly urges the Council to\r\ndo everything in its power to prevent an eruption of\r\nviolence in any form in the countries bordering Iraq, as\r\nsuch an occurrence could totally destabilize the entire\r\nregion, an eventuality whose consequences would be\r\ndire for the rest of the world.\r\nLet me take this opportunity to express to the\r\nGovernment and the people of the Hashemite Kingdom\r\nof Jordan my Government’s deepest condolences in\r\nconnection with the terrorist attack carried out in\r\nAmman yesterday, which caused serious casualties\r\namong innocent civilians.\r\nTurning now to the Council’s work in the African\r\nregion, my delegation is heartened by the steady gains\r\nthat have been made in containing or reducing the scale\r\nof conflicts on the continent. In Sierra Leone, Liberia,\r\nGuinea-Bissau, the Central African Republic and\r\nBurundi, the fires of war have been put out, the\r\npolitical transition has been completed and the\r\ncountries concerned have been readied for partnership\r\nwith the international community in peacebuilding and\r\ndevelopment. We commend the Council for steadfastly\r\n4\r\nA/60/PV.49\r\npursuing the peace agenda in these countries and for\r\nthe outstanding results achieved.\r\nThere is still some unfinished business in certain\r\nparts of the continent, which will hopefully be very\r\nmuch a part of the agenda for the future. There is still\r\nthe case of the forgotten imbroglio in Somalia, whose\r\nneglect on our part may be short-sighted if not totally\r\ncounterproductive. Because of the long period of\r\nstatelessness and isolation it experienced, Somalia may\r\nnow have become a fertile breeding ground and haven\r\nfor terrorists. The frequency of piracy attacks and other\r\nacts of terrorism against cargo and passenger vessels\r\nbears testimony to this sad development. My\r\ndelegation strongly urges the Council to enter into a\r\nmore proactive engagement with Somalia so as to bring\r\nit back into the comity of nations.\r\nIn the period under review, the Council has\r\nsignificantly built upon its partnership with regional\r\nand subregional organizations in advancing the peace\r\nand security agenda in Africa. Working closely with\r\nthe African Union and the Economic Community of\r\nWest African States, it has been able to make\r\nsignificant gains in countries such as the Sudan and\r\nGuinea-Bissau. Together they have also been able to\r\ndeliberate on strategies for tackling problems that drive\r\nconflicts, such as cross-border security issues. We hope\r\nthat this partnership will be further refined and used to\r\nmuch greater effect in the search for solutions to the\r\ncontinent’s problems of peace and security. It could\r\nalso provide a good model for cooperation that can be\r\nreplicated in other parts of the world.\r\nMy delegation aligns itself fully with the\r\nstatement made by the Ambassador of Nigeria,\r\nspeaking on behalf of the Group of African States. We\r\nfully concur that the time has indeed come for one of\r\nhistory’s greatest injustices to be corrected and for\r\nAfrica to be accorded two permanent seats in the\r\nCouncil, with all the rights and privileges that go with\r\nmembership in that category, including the right to the\r\nveto.\r\nMy delegation also reiterates the call by the\r\nAfrican Union for Africa to be accorded two additional\r\nnon-permanent seats in the Council. As the report itself\r\nacknowledges in its introduction, “Africa figured, once\r\nagain, at the forefront of the Council’s agenda”. Is it\r\nnot right, therefore, for Africa to be at the table along\r\nwith those who take decisions that affect its future? We\r\nurge all delegations to support Africa’s request and the\r\ndraft resolution that the African Group will eventually\r\nput up for action to give effect to it.\r\nMy delegation strongly believes that more should\r\nbe done by way of an in-depth review of the working\r\nmethods of the Council. Specifically, attention must be\r\nfocused on the veto in all its aspects, with a view to\r\nascertaining the degree of its usefulness vis-à-vis\r\ntoday’s requirements for global peace and security.\r\nWe are aware that there are moves to introduce a\r\ndraft resolution on the working methods of the\r\nCouncil — a draft resolution that is, in our view,\r\nincomplete at this stage. The draft calls for wider\r\nconsultation and for a fuller assessment of the reforms\r\nrealistically required to make the Council’s working\r\nmethods more transparent, democratic and effective.\r\nWe are prepared to work with its sponsors to make it\r\nmore acceptable to a larger number of delegations.\r\nFinally, my delegation commends the outgoing\r\nmembers of the Council — Algeria, Benin, Brazil, the\r\nPhilippines and Romania — for a very productive term\r\nof office in the Council. We express our\r\ncongratulations and best wishes for an equally\r\nsuccessful term to the incoming members — the\r\nCongo, Ghana, Peru, Qatar and Slovakia.\r\nMr. Desmoures (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nFirst of all, I should like to join previous speakers in\r\nexpressing my country’s sincere condolences to the\r\nGovernment and the people of Jordan for the terrorist\r\nattacks committed last Wednesday in the city of\r\nAmman.\r\nOn various occasions, we have stated that\r\nArgentina supports a solution with regard to Security\r\nCouncil reform that is based on a broad consensus. In\r\nrecent months, we have witnessed the negative\r\nconsequences of the intention to impose a reform\r\nprocess through the pressure of a vote. We all saw how\r\nthat created an atmosphere of division and tension,\r\nwhich affected the spirit of the negotiations on the\r\nreform document (resolution 60/1) adopted at the\r\nsummit of heads of State or Government in September.\r\nWe therefore welcome the current consultations.\r\nWe have a working group that could be used to follow\r\nthe path of dialogue, analysis and consensus-building.\r\nWe must begin a stage of deliberation and begin to\r\nanalyse — jointly, calmly and in a spirit of openness\r\nand cooperation — the various options that already\r\n5\r\nA/60/PV.49\r\nexist concerning expansion and working methods. We\r\nshould also consider new approaches.\r\nWe have indicated many times that the nature of\r\nthe permanent membership is an inequity that must be\r\ncorrected in the future. If we add new permanent\r\nmembers, the asymmetry that affects the legal equality\r\nof States will only further increase. That is why we\r\ncontinue to stress the advantages of the larger number\r\nof non-permanent seats for developing countries\r\noffered by the expansion model proposed by the\r\nUniting for Consensus group. As affirmed by several of\r\nthe group’s members, the ideas of Uniting for\r\nConsensus offer the possibility of resolving in a\r\npositive manner the imbalances and asymmetries that\r\nwould be caused by the potential creation of new\r\npermanent members. Such proposals — with\r\nimprovements or variations and on the basis of an\r\nexpanded number of elected seats — could include\r\nlonger periods, renewable mandates and legitimate\r\nrotation criteria.\r\nThe Assembly should therefore give the working\r\ngroup a consultative aspect in order to continue to\r\naddress this complex and political issue. We must\r\ncontinue the dialogue and build a consensus. We\r\nbelieve that priority must be given to the efforts being\r\nmade in the ongoing negotiations on the establishment\r\nof a Human Rights Council and a Peacebuilding\r\nCommission and on administrative issues.\r\nMr. Pak Gil Yon (Democratic People’s Republic\r\nof Korea): The Security Council and the United\r\nNations were established with the mission of\r\nmaintaining international peace and security.\r\nRegrettably, however, during the 60 years since the\r\nOrganization’s inception, the world has never been at\r\npeace at all. The world was unstable in the 1990s\r\nbecause of the cold war and it continued to be unstable\r\nafter the cold war because of unforeseen territorial and\r\nethnic disputes. It remains unstable owing to the\r\nincreasingly provocative unilateralism and arbitrariness\r\nof the super-Power.\r\nThe overall situation demands that Member\r\nStates review the activities of the Security Council —\r\nwhich is responsible for maintaining international\r\npeace and security — on the occasion of the sixtieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations. They must also take\r\nadequate measures to meet the requirements of the\r\ncurrent, changed environment.\r\nHistorically, the element of impartiality has been\r\nmissing from the activities of the Security Council,\r\nwhich has failed to fulfil its mandate of ensuring\r\ninternational peace and security in accordance with the\r\nCharter of the United Nations. In the southern part of\r\nthe Korean Peninsula, the so-called United Nations\r\nCommand, which has existed for more than half a\r\ncentury, is a typical product of the partiality observed\r\nin the Council’s activities. As explained time and again\r\nin this forum, the United Nations Command is a de\r\nfacto United States Command with United Nations\r\nhelmets, which demonstrates the abuse of the United\r\nNations name while carrying out the United States\r\nstrategy aimed at the domination of Asia.\r\nThe delegation of the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea believes that, in light of the lessons\r\nlearned from 60 years of United Nations history and\r\nfrom the current situation, it is most urgent that the\r\nSecurity Council ensure impartiality and fairness in its\r\nactivities, so that it can carry out its responsibility of\r\nmaintaining international peace and security.\r\nTherefore, if there is to be genuine Council reform,\r\nmeasures should be taken to remove all elements of\r\npartiality from the Council’s activities and to expand\r\nthe Council. Establishing a mechanism for the General\r\nAssembly to endorse Security Council resolutions on\r\nthe use of force would be such a measure.\r\nWith regard to expansion of the Security Council,\r\nwe must ensure full representation of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement and developing countries, which constitute\r\nthe majority of the United Nations membership. We\r\nbelieve that that would enable us to redress the\r\nimbalance in the Council membership and would give\r\nall Member States a more equal opportunity to\r\nparticipate in Council activities, in keeping with the\r\npurposes of United Nations reform.\r\nUnlike the situation with regard to non-permanent\r\nCouncil seats, increasing the number of permanent\r\nseats involves sensitive and intricate issues, such as the\r\ncriteria for selection and eligibility for the veto power.\r\nThis year’s intensive discussions on various\r\nproposals — including that of the group of four\r\ncountries — revealed the extreme complexity of the\r\nreform process.\r\nIt is a well-known fact that the Government of the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea is opposed to\r\nJapan’s efforts to become a permanent member of the\r\nSecurity Council because that country has not sincerely\r\n6\r\nA/60/PV.49\r\natoned for its tremendous past crimes against humanity.\r\nOur position enjoys wide understanding and support,\r\nnot only from neighbouring countries but also from a\r\nsignificant number of other countries from Asia and\r\nthroughout the world.\r\nThe delegation of the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea would like to conclude its statement\r\nby expressing its strong belief that issues — including\r\nequal representation on and enlargement of the\r\nSecurity Council — should be resolved in the interests\r\nof developing countries.\r\nMr. Kirn (Slovenia): Allow me to begin by\r\ncondemning the terrorist attacks that took place in\r\nAmman on Wednesday. I express the deep sympathy\r\nand condolences of my Government to the Government\r\nand the people of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan on\r\nthe human losses caused by those barbaric attacks.\r\nI would like to thank Ambassador Andrey\r\nDenisov of the Russian Federation, current President of\r\nthe Security Council, for his introduction of this year’s\r\nreport of the Council to the General Assembly\r\n(A/60/2). During the period under review the Council\r\ncontinued to be active on a wide array of country-\r\nspecific, region-specific and thematic issues. As the\r\nCouncil’s report attests, both the volume and the scope\r\nof the Council’s activities continue to increase.\r\nLet me make some brief comments on some\r\nelements of the report. Slovenia’s Foreign Minister, in\r\nhis capacity as Chairman-in-Office of the Organization\r\nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), had\r\nthe opportunity to address the Council earlier this year\r\nand to engage in substantive interaction with Council\r\nmembers. That discussion was also useful from the\r\nOSCE’s perspective. We believe such exchanges with\r\nregional organizations are welcome and necessary, and\r\nwe support further intensification of institutional\r\nrelationships with regional organizations.\r\nIn addition to the practice of missions conducted\r\nby the Council, we would also like to support the\r\nholding of extraordinary meetings outside\r\nHeadquarters, such as the meeting held at Nairobi last\r\nNovember. Such meetings held outside New York,\r\nwhen appropriate, bring the work of the Council closer\r\nto the peoples of affected areas under the Council’s\r\nconsideration.\r\nWe commend the Council for instituting\r\ncommissions of inquiry, such as the one established\r\nlast year for Darfur, Sudan, and the one set up this year\r\nfor the investigation of the assassination of former\r\nLebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. Such inquiry\r\nprocesses help gather data and information in an\r\nimpartial and expeditious manner.\r\nWe would in particular like to recognize the\r\nhistoric significance of resolution 1593 (2005), as well\r\nas to commend the Council for making use of the\r\nArticle 13 (b) of the Rome Statute to refer the situation\r\nin Darfur since 1 July 2002 to the International\r\nCriminal Court (ICC). The ICC is now fully\r\noperational and is well equipped to deal in an impartial\r\njudicial manner with situations of gross crimes and\r\natrocities within its mandate. The work of the ICC is,\r\nin our view, a necessary part of endeavours to maintain\r\ninternational peace and security, and can therefore be\r\nvery complementary to the work of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nI will not dwell on specific country or regional\r\nsituations, except to briefly welcome the Council’s\r\nrecent decision to give the green light for the Kosovo\r\nfuture status process to move forward, for we believe\r\nthat further stalling would not be beneficial either to\r\nthe resolution of the matter and Kosovo’s stabilization\r\nor for the stabilization of the wider region.\r\nWith regard to thematic issues, we would like in\r\nparticular to commend the Council for its innovative\r\napproaches, including its drawing up of lists of State\r\nand non-State violators in connection with the subject\r\nof children and armed conflict. We hope that the\r\nmonitoring and reporting mechanism that has been\r\nagreed will soon begin its work. The Council should\r\nalso be commended for the recently commemorated\r\nfifth anniversary of resolution 1324 (2000), on women\r\nand peace and security. Those and other thematic\r\ndeliberations make an important contribution to the\r\nprotection of civilians and enhance the human security\r\nof vulnerable individuals in dire situations.\r\nLet me now make some comments regarding the\r\noutcome document (resolution 60/1) of the High-level\r\nPlenary Meeting of the General Assembly, which was\r\nadopted by our leaders in September, as it relates to the\r\nwork of the Council.\r\nFirst, Slovenia welcomes the outcome\r\ndocument’s affirmation of the responsibility to protect.\r\nWe understand this as a conceptual breakthrough\r\ntowards better prevention of future tragedies of the\r\nkind that occurred in Srebrenica, Rwanda and Darfur. It\r\n7\r\nA/60/PV.49\r\nentails our national and collective responsibility to act\r\nin cases of genocide, ethnic cleansing, war crimes and\r\ncrimes against humanity. That responsibility is an\r\nintegral part of a nation’s sovereignty as it relates to\r\nthe protection of its people against such atrocities. But\r\nwe also understand that responsibility as an onus on the\r\nSecurity Council to act, when need be, in the exercise\r\nof its primary responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. We further consider\r\nthe use of the veto in connection with the atrocities I\r\nhave mentioned to be fundamentally incompatible with\r\nthe very idea of the responsibility to protect.\r\nWhile we fully support the provisions in the\r\nsummit outcome document regarding the use of force\r\nunder the Charter of the United Nations, we must also\r\nstate that we would have wished for more ambitions\r\nprovisions in the document regarding the principles for\r\nthe use of force, as had previously been suggested by\r\nthe Secretary-General in his report issued last March\r\nentitled “In larger freedom: towards development,\r\nsecurity and human rights for all” (A/59/2005). We\r\nhope that further work can be done in that regard at an\r\nappropriate opportunity. We believe that better-defined\r\nguidelines for the use of force by the Council would\r\ncontribute both to predictability of action and to the\r\nCouncil’s credibility.\r\nWe would like to call upon the Council to\r\ncontinue to engage in dialogue with the other relevant\r\nparts of the United Nations system — for example,\r\nthrough briefings provided by the High Commissioner\r\nfor Human Rights. We would also invite the Council to\r\ncontribute to, and support, the United Nations in\r\nestablishing an early warning capability, in accordance\r\nwith paragraph 138 of the 2005 World Summit\r\nOutcome. We also encourage the Council to make full\r\nuse of the Special Adviser of the Secretary-General on\r\nthe Prevention of Genocide, to benefit from his\r\nbriefings and to follow up on his recommendations for\r\nthe prevention of future genocide.\r\nFinally, I cannot but reiterate Slovenia’s position\r\nreflecting our commitment to comprehensive Security\r\nCouncil reform. We continue to believe that the\r\nincreasing volume and scope of the Council’s activities\r\nprompt us to recognize the need to adapt the Security\r\nCouncil’s membership in both its permanent and non-\r\npermanent categories, as well at its methods of work,\r\nincluding the right to the veto, in order that the Council\r\nmay efficiently address the geopolitical realities of\r\ntoday’s world.\r\nAs we have continuously advocated for the past\r\nyear, the Eastern European region should not be left\r\nout when the number of non-permanent seats are\r\nincreased. Slovenia will therefore continue to support\r\nefforts to enlarge the Council in both its permanent and\r\nnon-permanent categories of membership.\r\nWe also believe that the time has now come to\r\nincrease the transparency and accessibility of the\r\nCouncil vis-à-vis the wider membership of the\r\nOrganization. We therefore support the calls from the\r\nwider membership for more transparent and efficient\r\nworking methods. We believe that improved working\r\nmethods are necessary to better enable the\r\nOrganization, including the Security Council, to\r\ncollectively address today’s threats and challenges in a\r\nglobalized world. Greater openness to general views in\r\nthe Council’s decision-making process, and in\r\nparticular when it results in semi-legislative decisions\r\nunder Chapter VII of the Charter, will, in our view,\r\nincrease both the effectiveness and the legitimacy of\r\nthe Council.\r\nSlovenia supports progress in both aspects of\r\nSecurity Council reform: enlargement and working\r\nmethods. For the reasons I have mentioned, Slovenia\r\nsupports the initiative announced by Costa Rica,\r\nJordan, Liechtenstein, Singapore and Switzerland with\r\nregard to a draft resolution on the working methods of\r\nthe Security Council.\r\nWe welcome the initiative both we have not been\r\nable to move forward within the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup and on the basis of the world summit outcome\r\ndocument (resolution 60/1), in particular its paragraph\r\n154. But, most important, we believe, in fact, that the\r\nproposals contained in this initiative are long overdue.\r\nWe believe it is appropriate for the General Assembly,\r\nbased, inter alia, on Article 10 of the Charter, to engage\r\nin a meaningful dialogue with the Security Council on\r\nworking methods to bring about greater transparency,\r\nrepresentativity, efficiency, effectiveness, legitimacy\r\nand implementation of the Council’s decisions.\r\nMr. Dapkiunas (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): Let\r\nme thank Ambassador Denisov for introducing the\r\nannual report on the work of the Security Council\r\n(A/60/2). The delegation of Belarus commends the\r\nCouncil for its work during the reporting period to\r\nmaintain peace and security in various regions of the\r\nworld, particularly in Africa.\r\n8\r\nA/60/PV.49\r\nThe recent tragic events in Jordan demonstrate\r\nthe importance of the Council’s work in combating\r\nterrorism and other global threats. Today, we convey\r\nour sincere condolences to the people and the\r\nGovernment of Jordan on the large loss of life caused\r\nby those terrorist acts.\r\nBelarus commends Member States for their\r\nefforts in the run-up to the United Nations summit to\r\nadvance the issue of Security Council reform. Those\r\nefforts significantly reinvigorated the discussion on the\r\nissue of Council expansion. We are sincerely grateful\r\nto the group of four countries — Brazil, Germany,\r\nIndia and Japan — to the African Union (AU) and to\r\nthe Uniting for Consensus group, for their important\r\ncontributions to the discussion on ways to enlarge the\r\nSecurity Council. Belarus itself has tried to contribute\r\nto the process of Council reform, particularly by\r\npresenting its own model of expansion of the\r\nmembership.\r\nAt all phases of the discussion of approaches to\r\nUnited Nations reform, Belarus has advocated\r\nenlargement of the Security Council in order to\r\nharmonize its membership with today’s international\r\npolitical realities, to ensure adequate geographical\r\nrepresentation in the Council and to democratize that\r\nimportant United Nations organ.\r\nWe fully recognize the importance of achieving\r\nthe broadest possible consent and compromise among\r\nMembers on key aspects of Council reform, including\r\noptions both for enlargement of its membership and for\r\nthe improvement of its working methods. We are\r\ncertain that only by duly taking into account the views\r\nof all Member States will reform of the Security\r\nCouncil enhance the effectiveness of the work of that\r\nUnited Nations body and build the international\r\ncommunity’s trust in it.\r\nKey elements of the position of Belarus on this\r\nissue continue to be expansion of representation of\r\ndeveloping countries in the Council, as well as the\r\ngranting of one additional non-permanent seat to the\r\nEastern European regional group. Unfortunately, active\r\ndiscussion on the issue of Council reform during the\r\nrun-up to the summit focused essentially on ways to\r\nexpand the membership; the issue of improving the\r\nCouncil’s working methods and procedures was not\r\ngiven due attention. We believe that enhancing the\r\neffectiveness of the activities of the Council depends\r\nequally on the enlargement of the membership and on\r\nimprovement of its working methods. This is precisely\r\nwhy we welcome the draft resolution on the working\r\nmethods of the Security Council that has been prepared\r\nby Costa Rica, Jordan, Liechtenstein, Singapore and\r\nSwitzerland. It contains a number of important\r\nelements that can improve the Security Council’s\r\ninteraction with the General Assembly, the Economic\r\nand Social Council and all States Members of the\r\nOrganization. It would also create an environment for\r\nrapid and effective implementation of Council\r\ndecisions. Belarus stands ready to take part in\r\ndiscussions on that important and highly promising\r\ndocument.\r\nMr. Kapoma (Zambia): Let me begin by\r\nconveying the condolences of my Government to the\r\nHashemite Kingdom of Jordan, to its Government, to\r\nthe families of those who lost their lives and to those\r\nwho sustained injuries in the terrorist acts that befell\r\nthat country two days ago.\r\nMy delegation would like to associate itself with\r\nthe statement made by the representative of Nigeria on\r\nbehalf of the African Union (AU).\r\nThe Security Council is the only principal organ\r\nof the United Nations that has an overriding mandate\r\nand whose decisions and resolutions are binding on all\r\nMember States. It is an organ that is entrusted with the\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security and is also the only organ some of\r\nwhose members possess special privileges. It is that\r\nspecial mandate that necessitates reform of the Council\r\nso as to make it transparent, democratic and\r\naccountable to the general membership of the United\r\nNations.\r\nReform of the Security Council, as is well known,\r\nhas been on the agenda of the General Assembly for\r\nover a decade; in its resolution 48/26 of 3 December\r\n1993, the Assembly decided to establish an Open-\r\nended Working Group to consider all aspects of the\r\nquestion of increase in the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil and its working methods and other matters\r\nrelated to it. Since the Working Group began its\r\ndeliberations in January 1994, little if any progress has\r\nbeen made. Hence the current debate aimed at making\r\nthe Council more responsive to today’s realities in\r\nworld affairs.\r\nAt the fifty-ninth session, the General Assembly,\r\npursuant to the Secretary-General’s report entitled “In\r\nlarger freedom: towards development, security and\r\n9\r\nA/60/PV.49\r\nhuman rights for all”, (A/59/2005) which was a result\r\nof the report of the High-level Panel on Threats,\r\nChallenges and Change (A/59/565), deliberated in\r\ndepth on the recommendation contained in those two\r\ndocuments relating to reform of the Security Council.\r\nRegrettably, it failed to reach agreement on the\r\nenlargement of the Council, especially on an increase\r\nin the permanent-member category.\r\nThe three draft resolutions that were submitted to\r\nthe General Assembly — by the group of four\r\ncountries, the African Union and the Uniting for\r\nConsensus group, respectively — prior to the summit\r\nin September did not receive the required consensus\r\nsupport and, as a result, the issue was referred to the\r\nsixtieth session. The September 2005 summit outcome\r\ndocument (resolution 60/1) urged the sixtieth session\r\nof the General Assembly to review progress on reform\r\nby the end of this year. It is therefore incumbent upon\r\nthe Assembly to implement what was mandated by our\r\nheads of State and Government, as set out in the\r\noutcome document.\r\nAfrica, through the African Union, has its own\r\nposition on the reform of the Security Council which is\r\nwell known by all the States Members of the United\r\nNations. The African Union draft resolution\r\n(A/59/L.67) was submitted to this General Assembly in\r\nJuly and seeks the following: not less than two\r\npermanent seats for Africa, with all the prerogatives\r\nand privileges of permanent membership, including the\r\nright of veto; five non-permanent seats for Africa; and\r\nimproved Council working methods.\r\nIn an effort to break the current impasse, Africa\r\nwill continue to hold consultations with all interested\r\ngroups, regions and individual Member States, with a\r\nview to finding a solution satisfactory to all.\r\nAfrica’s position is a principled one, in that\r\nAfrica is the only continent without a permanent seat\r\non the Security Council. We see no moral justification\r\nfor the perpetuation of this historical injustice. In our\r\ndesire to have at least two permanent seats, we do not\r\nsubscribe to the notion of having two categories of\r\npermanent members, one category with veto powers\r\nand the other with none, as that state of affairs, in our\r\nview, would not add value to the status quo as far as\r\nAfrica is concerned. It is with this in mind that Africa\r\nis urging other Member States to support Africa’s\r\nposition and, subsequently, its draft resolution.\r\nAt this session, the Assembly has a unique\r\nopportunity to contribute to the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil in order to make it more democratic,\r\naccountable, efficient and transparent, so that it can be\r\nrelevant to today’s world, as opposed to that of 1945.\r\nMy delegation therefore wishes to appeal to all\r\nMember States to engage in serious consultations in\r\norder to ensure that at the end of the day we will have a\r\nSecurity Council that will be not only representative\r\nbut also, in all its actions and decisions, accountable to\r\nthe totality of the United Nations. Reform will have to\r\ninvolve both enlargement in the permanent and non-\r\npermanent categories and working methods. My\r\ndelegation regards enlargement of the Security Council\r\nand reform of its working methods as two sides of the\r\nsame coin; therefore, they should be addressed as such.\r\nLet us seize this occasion and carry out the\r\nmandate entrusted to us by our leaders, as expressed in\r\nthe September 2005 outcome document, in the interest\r\nof the well-being of the United Nations.\r\nNana Effah-Apenteng (Ghana): At the outset,\r\nallow me to express my delegation’s appreciation to\r\nAmbassador Andrey Denisov, Permanent\r\nRepresentative of the Russian Federation and President\r\nof the Security Council for this month, for his\r\nintroduction of the annual report of the Security\r\nCouncil covering the period 1 August 2004 to 31 July\r\n2005 (A/60/2).\r\nBut before proceeding any further, my delegation\r\nwould like to express its condolences to the\r\nGovernment and the people of the Hashemite Kingdom\r\nof Jordan on the terrorist attacks in Amman last\r\nWednesday. Our sympathies go in particular to those\r\nwhose family members or friends lost their lives or\r\nwere injured in the bomb attacks.\r\nThe report of the Security Council clearly\r\nconveys a picture of the busy schedule that has\r\ncharacterized its work during the period under review.\r\nMy delegation would like to express its appreciation\r\nfor the Council’s comprehensive approach to dealing\r\nwith the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity, in the light of the growing volume and\r\ncomplexity of conflict situations spanning the various\r\nregions of the world. I must also remark on the early\r\nissuance of the Council’s report, which is an\r\nimprovement on last year, and on the fact that the two\r\nagenda items currently under consideration have been\r\nrightly reorganized into a joint debate format.\r\n10\r\nA/60/PV.49\r\nThe Council’s continued dedication of a majority\r\nof its agenda to the several conflict situations on the\r\nAfrican continent is worthy of mention. It is our hope\r\nthat the devotion of such time and effort will be\r\ntranslated into needed solutions, with appropriate\r\npolitical support and resources.\r\nIn that regard, my delegation urges the Council to\r\ncontinue to explore and build on the United Nations\r\ninstitutional relationship with the African Union (AU),\r\nespecially within the framework of the expanded\r\nmandate and new organs of the AU, such as the Peace\r\nand Security Council. We cannot but commend the\r\nCouncil for holding a special series of meetings in\r\nNairobi, in November 2004. That initiative displayed a\r\nunique hands-on approach by the Council in dealing\r\nwith conflict situations and fostering closer relations\r\nwith regional organizations, and it is worthy of\r\nappropriate replication.\r\nWe should also like to urge the deepening of the\r\nrelationship between the Council and regional\r\norganizations such as the Economic Community of\r\nWest African States (ECOWAS), in order to identify\r\nways in which such vital partnerships could contribute\r\nto preventing, combating and eradicating the scourge\r\nof conflicts that have come to characterize our region.\r\nGiven the improvements in the security situations in\r\nSierra Leone and Liberia, we would like to encourage\r\nthe Council to remain fully engaged in finding a lasting\r\nsolution to the crisis in Côte d’Ivoire, which has in\r\nrecent times seen escalating tensions that could\r\npotentially result in a relapse into full-blown conflict,\r\nreversing the hard-won gains made in the region.\r\nWhile we welcome the increased consultations\r\nbetween the Council and the wider membership of the\r\nUnited Nations, it is my delegation’s considered view\r\nthat such interaction could be improved upon, both in\r\nterms of frequency and in terms of reflecting the views\r\nof non-member States in the decisions of the Council.\r\nSimilarly, we commend the activities of the\r\nconsultative mechanism to further improve cooperation\r\nbetween the Council and troop-contributing countries,\r\nespecially the growing regularity and frequency of\r\nmeetings with those countries. My delegation believes\r\nthat this consultative mechanism has inherent benefits\r\nto all the parties involved in peacekeeping.\r\nOn the reform of the Security Council, my\r\ndelegation reaffirms its commitment to the African\r\nposition in all its aspects, as eloquently articulated at\r\nthe 47th plenary meeting by my Nigerian colleague on\r\nbehalf of the African Group. Let me stress the need to\r\nrectify the existing historical injustice against Africa\r\nreflected in the Council’s present structure and\r\ncomposition. We would like to caution against the real\r\ndanger of adopting half-baked solutions, where the\r\nlegitimate demands of some are short-changed in a bid\r\nto arrive at any form of agreement. Therefore, we do\r\nnot favour procedural tactics essentially aimed at\r\nblocking any serious attempt at comprehensive reform\r\nof the Security Council.\r\nAs recently reaffirmed at the Extraordinary\r\nSession of the Assembly of Heads of State and\r\nGovernment of the African Union, held in Addis\r\nAbaba on 31 October 2005, Africa is demanding not\r\nless than two permanent seats, with all the existing\r\nprerogatives and privileges of such membership, as\r\nwell as two additional non-permanent seats. Any\r\nSecurity Council reform package that seeks to exclude\r\nany of the elements of the principles of democracy,\r\nsovereign equality of States and equitable geographical\r\nrepresentation would not be tenable.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation would like to stress\r\nthat the United Nations has been hard-pressed in recent\r\ntimes to reassert its indisputable relevance in the\r\npresent global context. These have indeed been very\r\nchallenging times for our Organization. However, by\r\nthe same token, the United Nations has been presented\r\nwith unprecedented opportunities to make relevant\r\nchanges to enable it to play the role envisaged for it by\r\nthe founding fathers and by humankind. Improvement\r\nin the working methods of the Security Council and\r\nnecessary changes in its structure and composition\r\nremain central components of the strenuous efforts\r\nbeing made to reform the United Nations as a whole.\r\nThe process of Security Council reform has been\r\nlong and arduous, spanning some 12-plus years. This\r\ncannot continue ad infinitum. The challenge is to heed\r\nthe call of our leaders at the 2005 world summit to take\r\na decision on this matter by the end of the year.\r\nMr. Beck (Palau): On behalf of the Government\r\nand the people of Palau, I wish to express our deepest\r\ncondolences to the Government and the people of the\r\nHashemite Kingdom of Jordan on the tragic loss of\r\nlives in the terrorist attacks in Amman.\r\nWe wish to thank Ambassador Denisov of the\r\nRussian Federation for his presentation of the report of\r\nthe Security Council (A/60/2).\r\n11\r\nA/60/PV.49\r\nWhen our leaders met for the momentous summit\r\nin September, they agreed that early reform of the\r\nSecurity Council was an essential element of our\r\noverall effort to reform the United Nations in order to\r\nmake it more broadly representative, efficient and\r\ntransparent. Palau’s views on the best means to\r\naccomplish those objectives were expressed during the\r\nGeneral Assembly fifty-ninth session, when we co-\r\nsponsored draft resolution A/59/L.64, which came to\r\nbe known as the G-4 draft resolution. We believed\r\nthen, and believe now, that it expressed an appropriate\r\nway forward on Security Council reform.\r\nIt is Palau’s belief that more equitable\r\ngeographical representation in the Security Council on\r\na permanent basis is simply better, and not worse. The\r\ngeographical distribution that concerns Palau the most\r\npertains to the Pacific, which we submit is\r\nunderrepresented in the organs, tribunals and bodies of\r\nthe United Nations and which is often marginalized by\r\nthe remoteness and isolation of its small island States.\r\nAs a Pacific State, Palau wishes acknowledges\r\nJapan’s position as a regional partner with extensive\r\nknowledge of the unique cultures and vulnerabilities of\r\nits small neighbours in the Pacific. Japan has\r\ndemonstrated the determination not only to understand\r\nbut to help, when help is required, in those island\r\nnations. Japan’s knowledge of the region should\r\nbecome a permanent part of the collective wisdom of\r\nthe Security Council. The expansion of the Council to\r\ninclude other deserving countries referred to in the G-4\r\ndraft resolution will, in similar fashion, enable the\r\nSecurity Council to deal more effectively with a very\r\nchanged world. We wish for momentum on that issue.\r\nPalau notes with approval and admiration the\r\nexcellent work of the delegations of Costa Rica,\r\nJordan, Liechtenstein, Singapore and Switzerland. We\r\nfully endorse their notion that the working methods of\r\nthe Security Council should be consistently adapted so\r\nas to increase the involvement of States that are not\r\nmembers of the Council. Now that Palau has deployed\r\npeacekeepers for the first time in its short history, that\r\nconnectivity becomes all the more relevant. We submit\r\nthat one inevitable result of the expansion of the\r\nCouncil along the lines proposed by the G-4 draft\r\nresolution would be a greater opportunity for enhanced\r\ninvolvement and understanding of the Security\r\nCouncil’s work, particularly in currently\r\nunderrepresented regions like the Pacific.\r\nMr. Rock (Canada): Canada is grateful for this\r\nopportunity to offer its views on the report of the\r\nSecurity Council, as well as to return to the important\r\nsubject of Security Council reform.\r\nI have had the opportunity in the recent past to\r\nplace on record Canada’s strong support for the\r\nenlargement of the Security Council. While we oppose\r\nadding permanent members, for reasons that I set forth\r\nin some detail from this podium, Canada believes that\r\nthe Council’s legitimacy would be enhanced by\r\nincreasing its membership to include a broader\r\nrepresentation of the world’s regions. It is especially\r\nimportant that we redress the absence of adequate\r\nAfrican representation. We support enlargement to\r\nproduce a representative Council, but enlargement\r\nachieved in a way that is compatible with the principles\r\nof democracy, fairness, flexibility and accountability.\r\nHowever, the legitimacy of the Council depends\r\nnot only upon the breadth of its composition; it derives\r\nas well from its effectiveness and the way it carries out\r\nits functions. Canada believes that the effectiveness\r\nand legitimacy of the Council could be greatly\r\nenhanced if the Council made certain changes in the\r\napproach to its work. We believe that there are three\r\nareas in particular where change is desirable.\r\nFirst, the Council’s working methods should be\r\nimproved to increase transparency and evidence-based\r\ndecision-making, as well as to limit the use of the veto.\r\nSecondly, the Council’s normative framework\r\nshould be updated, so that it is better equipped to meet\r\nthe demands of an evolving security environment and\r\nthe changes in the nature of contemporary armed\r\nconflicts.\r\nThirdly, the Council should manage its agenda in\r\nsuch a way that it gives prompt attention to those\r\nconflicts that involve grave humanitarian needs or risks\r\nto regional peace and security.\r\nLet me first deal with working methods.\r\nThere is no doubt that, in recent years, the\r\nCouncil’s procedures have evolved to become more\r\nopen than they were. Those changes have been most\r\nwelcome. But Canada believes that the time has come\r\nto go further. The first step should be to increase\r\ntransparency. In an age when the Council’s work, as\r\ndemonstrated in the report itself, has such far-reaching\r\nand fast-growing implications for us all in expanding\r\nareas such as counter-terrorism and non-proliferation,\r\n12\r\nA/60/PV.49\r\nsurely outreach and consultation with Member States is\r\nmore important than ever. We urge the Council to make\r\nmore frequent and systematic use of informal\r\nexchanges, and to increase the regularity of substantive\r\nbriefings for Member States. Where States face\r\nchallenges in their capacity to meet Council\r\nobligations, such as in the area of counter-terrorism,\r\nwe encourage the provision of greater assistance.\r\nFurthermore, there is a need for better\r\ninformation to assist the Council in making its\r\nimportant decisions. My delegation strongly supports\r\nefforts to provide better aggregate dates to the\r\nCouncil — for example, on trends in global conflict,\r\nabout which there is much recent and important\r\nlearning — in order to permit more evidence-based\r\ndecision-making by the Council, where the stakes are\r\nso high.\r\nLet me briefly deal with the matter of the veto.\r\nWe all know the inhibiting effect that the veto, or\r\neven the threat of its use, can have on Council\r\ndeliberations. Indeed, there have been several\r\nregrettable occasions during the past year when the\r\nspectre of the veto had the effect of dampening debate\r\nor delaying important decisions. In our view, the veto\r\ncan rarely be justified. It was originally intended to\r\nprotect direct and vital great-Power interests, not as a\r\ntool for disciplining the rest of the membership on the\r\nCouncil or aborting debate on certain issues. For that\r\nreason, Canada believes that any use of the veto should\r\nbe explained and publicly justified. We also strongly\r\nsupport proposals for voluntary restrictions on its use,\r\nin particularly in situations of genocide, crimes against\r\nhumanity and war crimes.\r\nCanada believes that those and other changes to\r\nthe Council’s working methods could very much\r\nenhance its legitimacy and effectiveness. We encourage\r\nthe Council to consider adopting such measures in the\r\nmonths ahead. In the meantime, let me restate my\r\nGovernment’s strong support for the General Assembly\r\ndraft resolution on the Council’s working methods,\r\nwhich has been circulated by Costa Rica, Jordan,\r\nLiechtenstein, Singapore and Switzerland. We believe\r\nthat the draft resolution merits serious consideration by\r\nmembers of the Assembly and the Security Council\r\nalike. We encourage the drafters to initiate broad-based\r\nconsultations as soon as possible.\r\nThe second area where Canada believes there\r\nshould be early consideration within the Council\r\nChamber of change is the normative framework within\r\nwhich the Council makes decisions on individual\r\nconflicts. In keeping with the endorsement by our\r\nleaders of the responsibility to protect, we believe that\r\nit would be timely and useful for the Council to echo\r\nthose principles, so that when such crises arise we do\r\nnot revisit lengthy and sterile debates about\r\nsovereignty at the risk of losing civilian lives.\r\nWe are, of course, respectful of the sincere\r\nconcerns that have been raised regarding the potential\r\nfor the principle of the responsibility to protect to be\r\nmisused or abused. While we believe that the leaders’\r\nlanguage renders that risk remote, there is scope for a\r\nCouncil resolution that could provide additional\r\nreassurance by outlining guidelines on the use of force.\r\nThe Secretary-General has proposed a pragmatic\r\nand balanced set of principles for addressing the use of\r\nforce. We urge members of the Security Council to\r\nadopt a resolution that sets out those principles and\r\nexpresses its intention to treat them as a guide in its\r\nfuture decision-making. That would not only reassure\r\nthose who remain anxious about the scope of the\r\nresponsibility to protect, but would also serve to\r\nstrengthen the Council’s legitimacy, effectiveness and\r\ntransparency. We do not believe that, as some suggest,\r\nsuch a step would hamstring the Council by imposing\r\nrigid guidelines.\r\nFinally, it goes without saying that the Council\r\ncannot be effective if it does not consider the full range\r\nof “live” crises. In this regard, as a compelling\r\nexample of a place where the Council’s attention is\r\nbadly needed, we draw its attention once again to the\r\n20-year-old conflict in northern Uganda, which we\r\nbelieve should be placed formally on the Council’s\r\nagenda. The humanitarian crisis in northern Uganda is\r\none of the world’s worst, with 1.6 million people\r\ninternally displaced and living, some for 10 years, in\r\nsqualid, insecure camps, with acts of brutality —\r\nkilling and maiming — committed against the local\r\npopulations, and with tens of thousands of children\r\nabducted by the Lord’s Resistance Army to serve as\r\nchild soldiers or as sex slaves.\r\nWhat is more, the presence of the Lord’s\r\nResistance Army in the Sudan and, more recently, in\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, illustrates the\r\npotential for that conflict to destabilize and impede\r\npeaceful transitions in the entire region. The recent\r\nincrease in acts of violence against humanitarian aid\r\n13\r\nA/60/PV.49\r\nworkers in northern Uganda and neighbouring southern\r\nSudan puts at risk much-needed humanitarian\r\noperations in the region and further highlights the need\r\nfor all parties to engage further on this issue. We urge\r\nthe Council to place the issue of northern Uganda on\r\nits agenda, to help find ways of ensuring that Uganda\r\nmeets its own responsibility to protect its own\r\npopulations, to consider how the international\r\ncommunity might support efforts to reach a political\r\nsolution to that devastating conflict and others like it\r\nand, above all, to improve the dire humanitarian\r\nsituation on the ground.\r\nIn conclusion, as we move forward with summit\r\nimplementation, Canada agrees that we cannot afford\r\nto forget about Council reform in relation to both\r\nenlargement and effectiveness. At the same time,\r\nCouncil reform is but one element of the much broader\r\nagenda of renewal upon which we are now embarked.\r\nWe spent significant time and energy on the\r\ncomposition issue in the months leading up to the\r\nsummit, and we were right to do so. At this time,\r\nsurely our collective priority has to be the\r\nimplementation of the full range of decisions taken by\r\nour leaders in September: to establish a Peacebuilding\r\nCommission and a Human Rights Council, to initiate\r\nand follow through on management reform and to\r\nadvance implementation of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, to name but a few.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nNotwithstanding the daunting nature of that work\r\nplan, we believe that early action with regard to the\r\nCouncil’s working methods, norms and agenda could\r\nyield concrete success in the near term. Such action\r\nwould not only be desirable in itself but would also be\r\na means of building new momentum in our efforts to\r\nresolve the composition question.\r\nIn all of those areas we must be guided by the\r\nprinciples of representativeness, transparency and\r\neffectiveness. I look forward to working with\r\ncolleagues on these important issues in the months\r\nahead.\r\nMr. Muñoz (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): I would\r\nlike to express my appreciation for the report of the\r\nSecurity Council (A/60/2), introduced by the\r\nrepresentative of the Russian Federation, on its\r\nactivities during the period 1 August 2004 to 31 July\r\n2005, the contents of which we have taken due note.\r\nThroughout the ongoing United Nations reform\r\nprocess, Chile has reiterated its view that efforts to\r\nachieve comprehensive reform must be faithful to the\r\nprinciples and values of the Charter, enhance the\r\ncredibility and legitimacy of the Organization and\r\nbring it up to date. They must be based on the\r\nunderstanding that development, international security,\r\ndemocracy and human rights are indissociable and\r\ninterdependent concepts.\r\nFrom that perspective, we have actively\r\nadvocated the reform of the General Assembly, the\r\nSecurity Council, the Economic and Social Council,\r\nthe Commission on Human Rights and the Secretariat,\r\nas well as providing support for the necessary\r\nconsensus for the establishment of the Human Rights\r\nCouncil and the Peacebuilding Commission. The\r\npromotion of development, as well as the concepts of\r\nthe responsibility to protect and human security, are\r\nalso key elements for my country.\r\nOnce again, we reaffirm that Chile seeks the\r\nrenewal of the Security Council so as to make it more\r\nrepresentative, transparent and effective. An increase\r\nin its membership, especially through the participation\r\nof more countries from the developing world, would\r\nhelp to achieve that objective. But that should be\r\nundertaken in parallel with the improvement of the\r\nCouncil’s working methods.\r\nWe reaffirm the recommendation contained in\r\nparagraph 154 of the recent summit outcome document\r\n(resolution 60/1) that\r\n“the Security Council continue to adapt its\r\nworking methods so as to increase the\r\ninvolvement of States not members of the\r\nCouncil in its work, as appropriate, enhance its\r\naccountability to the membership and increase the\r\ntransparency of its work”.\r\nIn this context, we note with interest the initiatives that\r\nhave rightly been put forward to improve the Council’s\r\nworking methods.\r\nAt the bilateral level, Chile supports Brazil,\r\nGermany, India and Japan in their aspiration to\r\npermanent Council membership, while maintaining our\r\nlong-standing position opposing the veto. Let us be\r\nvery clear: Chile supports the inclusion of new\r\npermanent members, but without the right of veto,\r\neither now or later. Our consistent opposition to the\r\nveto is not recent: it was stated for the first time at the\r\n14\r\nA/60/PV.49\r\nSan Francisco Conference in 1945. We recognize that\r\nthe complete elimination of the right of veto is perhaps\r\na bit unrealistic or unlikely, but we do not reject giving\r\nserious consideration to interim formulas, such as, for\r\nexample, restricting its exercise only to matters under\r\nChapter VII, excluding cases of genocide or crimes\r\nagainst humanity.\r\nWe also wish to state for the record that the\r\nposition of Latin America and the Caribbean with\r\nregard to the enlargement of the Security Council\r\nshould not disparaged in favour of that of other\r\nregions, particularly given the quantitative and\r\nqualitative contributions that have been referred to by\r\nthe Secretary-General since the beginning.\r\nBy virtue of the mandate contained in paragraph\r\n153 of the Summit Outcome of the 2005 High-level\r\nPlenary Meeting, Chile is prepared, at this stage in the\r\nreform, to contribute to the building of the consensus\r\nrequired for comprehensive and successful reform of\r\nthe Organization, and specifically that of the Security\r\nCouncil, whose reform cannot continue to be delayed.\r\nChile favours an effort aimed at achieving compromise\r\nand agreement, which has been our longstanding policy\r\nwith respect to issues that divide us. We have been\r\ndoing so in the Assembly and in the group of friends of\r\nthe reform. The President can therefore count on our\r\ncooperation and support on this issue that we consider\r\nto be crucial.\r\nMr. Kazykhanov (Kazakhstan): On behalf of the\r\nGovernment of Kazakhstan, I would like to express my\r\nsincere condolences to the Government and people of\r\nJordan for the tragic loss of life that resulted from the\r\nheinous terrorist attacks in Amman on 9 November.\r\nAt the outset, let me thank the Security Council\r\nand the Secretariat for the comprehensive report on the\r\nwork of the Security Council during the past year, and\r\nin particular Ambassador Andrey Denisov, the current\r\nPresident of the Council, for his clear and informative\r\nintroduction of the report.\r\nThe document before us covers a busy, and in\r\nmany ways difficult, period. A number of crises that\r\nhave been on the Security Council’s agenda for a long\r\ntime have continued to require its attention. The\r\nSecurity Council, as the United Nations body entrusted\r\nwith primary responsibility for the maintenance of\r\npeace and security, plays a key role in current affairs\r\naffecting the international community as a whole.\r\nAlthough more needs to be done, we are happy to\r\nacknowledge that progress has been made in recent\r\nyears towards improving the working methods of the\r\nSecurity Council. My delegation welcomes the\r\nemerging practice of sending Security Council\r\nmissions to the field and is particularly pleased with\r\nthe Council’s continuing efforts to address ongoing\r\nconflicts.\r\nWe have taken note of — and welcome — the\r\nfact that the Security Council has shifted its debate\r\nfrom issues of peace and security to a much boarder\r\nconcept of security, while attaching importance to the\r\nrule of law, the role of regional organizations, civil\r\nsociety, economic and social factors and HIV/AIDS.\r\nAlthough the report of the Council opens with an\r\nanalytical segment, we had expected more substantive\r\ninformation rather than a historical recounting of the\r\nevents as they happened in the Council during the year.\r\nIn our opinion, the report should not be confined to\r\nwhat the Council has achieved, but, more importantly,\r\nit should also address what has worked and why it has\r\nworked. The report needs to be a document more\r\nuseful to Member States. Non-members of the Security\r\nCouncil have the right to be well briefed about the\r\nwork of the Council, and their views should be\r\nreflected in the report during the drafting exercise.\r\nOpenness and effectiveness should be interrelated\r\nobjectives of the Security Council. The Council must\r\ndo more towards increasing the participation of non-\r\nmembers of the Council in its deliberations. In that\r\ncontext, we would like to emphasize the importance of\r\ngiving the wider membership an opportunity to express\r\ntheir views on issues before the Council, with the\r\nexpectation that the Council will take those views into\r\naccount before it takes its decisions.\r\nWe also believe that a satisfactory relationship\r\nbetween the General Assembly and the Security\r\nCouncil should be fundamental. Dialogue between\r\nthose two principal organs should not be merely\r\nritualistic.\r\nMy delegation commends the practice of holding\r\ninformal briefings on the work of the Security Council\r\nfor regional groups by members of the Council. Such\r\nbriefings could assist the Council in producing more\r\nbalanced and impartial decisions.\r\nReform of the Security Council is necessary, and\r\na decision on that subject is a serious and important\r\n15\r\nA/60/PV.49\r\nmeasure. Kazakhstan has repeatedly voiced its\r\ncontinued support for an expansion of the Security\r\nCouncil in both the permanent and the non-permanent\r\ncategories of membership. Kazakhstan believes that, in\r\nits current form, the Council no longer reflects the\r\nrealities of our world. We believe that the equitable\r\nrepresentation of Member States in the Council could\r\nstrengthen its ability to effectively face the challenges\r\nof the twenty-first century and play its role in the\r\nsettlement of crisis situations.\r\nSuch a sensitive issue as the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council should be resolved on the basis of\r\nbroad international agreement, in accordance with the\r\nprinciple of equitable geographical representation and\r\nwith due consideration of the contribution of States\r\nconcerned towards the development of the global\r\neconomy and regional and global security.\r\nWe also believe that reform must also deal with\r\nthe Council’s working methods, which must be\r\nimproved in order to enhance its transparency and\r\naccountability. We therefore support the initiatives\r\naimed at improving the Council’s working methods.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to express the\r\nappreciation of my Government to the members of the\r\nCouncil for their contributions, as well as to\r\ncongratulate the five newly elected members. We\r\npledge our cooperation and full support.\r\nWe look forward to working closely with the\r\nSecurity Council and to participating actively in all its\r\nefforts to meet the global need for peace.\r\nMr. Sardenberg (Brazil): At the outset, on behalf\r\nof Brazil, I wish to express our heartfelt condolences to\r\nthe people and to the Government of Hashemite\r\nKingdom of Jordan, who were victimized by the recent\r\ndastardly and abhorrent act of terrorism. We must\r\ncontinue to combat that scourge through all means.\r\nI would like to thank the President of the\r\nAssembly for convening this meeting. Its timeliness is\r\ndue not only to the importance of the issues\r\nthemselves, but also to the need for the General\r\nAssembly to comply with the relevant provisions of the\r\nOutcome of the High-level Plenary Meeting of the\r\nGeneral Assembly as regards the question of the\r\nexpansion of the Security Council. We are confident\r\nthat, under the President’s determined guidance, the\r\nlong-standing issue of Security Council reform will be\r\nresolved, along with the other important issues relating\r\nto the institutional reform of the Organization.\r\nI am pleased to join previous speakers in\r\nthanking Ambassador Andrey Denisov, Permanent\r\nRepresentative of the Russian Federation and President\r\nof the Security Council for this month, for presenting\r\nthe Council’s report to the General Assembly. I also\r\nwish to congratulate Ambassador Adamantios\r\nVassilakis of Greece and his team for their important\r\nwork in facilitating the preparation of the document.\r\nOn behalf of our delegation, I also convey our\r\ndeep appreciation and gratitude to the Security Council\r\nsecretariat for their support throughout the period since\r\nJanuary 2004, during which time Brazil has been a\r\nnon-permanent member of the Council.\r\nThe report of the Security Council is an item of\r\nsingular importance on the agenda of the current\r\nsession of the General Assembly. As a long-standing\r\nadvocate of greater accountability by the Council,\r\nBrazil more than welcomes this debate, which, to our\r\nregret, takes place only once each session. We are of\r\nthe view that the notion of special reports — as set out\r\nin Article 15, paragraph 1, of the Charter, as well as in\r\nArticle 24, paragraph 3 — should be heeded, especially\r\nat this stage when important reforms are under\r\ndiscussion at the United Nations.\r\nBearing this need in mind, on the occasion of its\r\nSecurity Council presidency last March, the Brazilian\r\ndelegation, with the support of other members,\r\nreinstated the format of Security Council monthly\r\n“wrap-up” sessions. Our intention was to enable the\r\nbroader membership to comment on and assess the\r\nwork of the Council during that month, when a number\r\nof issues related to Africa were under review. We\r\nencourage other members to continue to promote this\r\nsort of inclusive dialogue.\r\nThe work undertaken by the Council between\r\nAugust 2004 and July 2005 reinforces the perception\r\nthat it faces a transitional moment requiring its\r\nadaptation to new international circumstances.\r\nGrowing complexity in the Council’s daily work stems\r\nfrom the fact that current challenges exceed by far the\r\nclassic pattern of inter-State conflict; to a greater\r\nextent, we are confronted with situations of domestic\r\nstruggle, on the one hand, and of ever more disquieting\r\ntransnational threats, on the other. The need to respond\r\nto these challenges in effective and innovative ways\r\nmust be addressed in tandem with the absolute\r\n16\r\nA/60/PV.49\r\nimperative of safeguarding the framework provided by\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations.\r\nSixty years after the creation of the United\r\nNations, its purposes and principles are more valid than\r\never. Respect for the principles of sovereign equality,\r\npolitical independence and self-determination of\r\npeoples is essential for the achievement of peace and\r\nharmony in international life. The Council has special\r\nresponsibilities in this regard and is expected to make\r\njudicious use of the powers at its disposal.\r\nThe report reflects the variety of issues that\r\nnowadays call for the involvement of the Council, such\r\nas national reconciliation, conflict prevention,\r\nactivities to disarm, demobilize and reintegrate ex-\r\ncombatants, post-conflict peacebuilding, promotion of\r\njustice and the rule of law, economic reconstruction,\r\nmeasures aimed at combating terrorism, and the threat\r\nposed by non-State actors having access to weapons of\r\nmass destruction, among many other issues.\r\nIn the Council’s consideration of these measures,\r\nthe Brazilian delegation ascribes priority to full\r\nconsideration, on a case-by-case basis, of all elements\r\nrelating to every particular situation on the ground,\r\nespecially including the root causes of conflict, most of\r\nthem being of a social or economic dimension. It is our\r\nview that peoples’ frustration and humiliation set the\r\nstage for violence, crises and conflicts of all sorts, and\r\nthat specific, precise responses can be identified to\r\ntackle these challenges in a sustainable manner.\r\nFor instance, we believe Haiti constitutes a test\r\ncase for the United Nations, as it illustrates the types of\r\nproblems that the United Nations is likely to face in the\r\nyears ahead. These include problems deeply rooted in\r\nsocio-economic shortfalls for which solutions need to\r\nbe achieved by means other than military action. They\r\nrequire making progress, in parallel, in the fields of\r\nsecurity, institution-building, political reconciliation,\r\npromotion of social and economic development and,\r\ncertainly, the observance of human rights. Last March,\r\nI had the privilege and the honour of leading the\r\nSecurity Council mission to that country, in\r\nconjunction with the mission of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council’s Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti. I\r\nam pleased that today the Council is convinced that\r\npervasive poverty is truly a main root cause of unrest\r\nin Haiti.\r\nIn the case of Guinea-Bissau, there is an ongoing\r\nneed for promoting peace, stability and reconciliation\r\nand for continued international support. The Council\r\nwill now have to consider adequate solutions as\r\nregards the future United Nations presence in that\r\ncountry. We fully support the ideas proposed by the\r\nSecretary-General with a view to adopting a mandate\r\nfor the United Nations Peace-building Support Office\r\nin Guinea-Bissau that merges the peace and security\r\nand sustainable development agendas.\r\nAs regards the situation in Timor-Leste, that\r\ncountry is now calm and stable — I should say to our\r\ngreat satisfaction. The structure and capabilities of its\r\nnational institutions are being strengthened with a\r\nmajor contribution by the United Nations and other\r\ninternational support.\r\nThe three cases I have just highlighted are clear\r\nexamples of the multidisciplinary approach that is\r\nrequired nowadays. Besides financial and material\r\ncontributions, Brazil has assisted with a number of\r\nproposals and ideas in the context of the Security\r\nCouncil’s decision-making process. We will continue\r\nto offer our support and advice.\r\nAs a Member State that has consistently called\r\nfor greater, more frequent and fluid interaction between\r\nthe Council and other United Nations main organs, we\r\nassessed with particular satisfaction the establishment\r\nof a Peacebuilding Commission. We look forward to\r\nthe next report of the Council, to be submitted at the\r\nsixty-first session of the General Assembly, which we\r\nhope will testify to the Peacebuilding Commission, the\r\nEconomic and Social Council and the Security Council\r\nitself working hand in hand to ensure conditions not\r\nonly for transition from war to peace, but also from\r\npeace to stability and sustainable development.\r\nThe issue of Security Council reform has been on\r\nthe agenda of the General Assembly for a very long\r\ntime. There is now a clear, generalized perception that\r\nthe structure of the Council fails to reflect current\r\ninternational realities. The urgency of the matter is\r\nshown not only by the rather obvious fact that the\r\nworld of 2005 is not that of 1945, but also by the trend\r\ntowards greater exercise of the Council’s authority and\r\ninfluence in many areas, with direct domestic\r\nconsequences for all countries of the world. Most, if\r\nnot all, nations now realize the implications of this\r\ntrend. The Council and the decisions it takes need to\r\nbecome more legitimate and more effective; therefore\r\nbalanced representation in the Council is essential.\r\nThat can be accomplished only by expanding the\r\n17\r\nA/60/PV.49\r\npermanent and non-permanent categories, with the\r\ninclusion of developing countries in both categories.\r\nAt the last session of the General Assembly, and\r\nafter a long, inclusive process of consultations\r\ninvolving the entire membership, I introduced, on\r\nbehalf of 32 sponsors, including Brazil’s G-4\r\npartners — Germany, India and Japan — the first draft\r\nresolution presented to the Assembly containing a\r\nproposed framework for a comprehensive reform of the\r\nSecurity Council. Another important group of\r\ncountries, the African Union, put forward a proposal\r\ncontaining very similar ideas on the basic need to\r\nexpand the permanent and non-permanent categories of\r\nCouncil membership.\r\nThose proposals, which address the heart of the\r\nissue, constitute a significant development. They not\r\nonly demonstrate a willingness and a determination to\r\ncome to grips with the question of expansion but also\r\ndemonstrate that the question can no longer be put off.\r\nEven the handful of countries bent on stalling the\r\nprocess felt compelled to present a proposal, although\r\nit was incompatible with the call for consensus that\r\nthey so vocally maintain.\r\nAlthough we would have preferred to resolve the\r\nissue before the September summit, as recommended\r\nby the Secretary-General, it would plainly be wrong to\r\nmistake the lack of a decision for a lack of progress.\r\nThere is now a nearly unanimous perception among\r\nMember States that there is a pressing need for change,\r\nand a clear majority share coinciding views on the\r\ncomposition of a reformed Council. It is no\r\nexaggeration to say that we have never come as close\r\nto settling this protracted issue as we are right now.\r\nImportant recent developments can help move the\r\nprocess forward. The decision taken at the latest\r\nAfrican Union summit, held in Sirte on 31 October, to\r\nresubmit the African proposal for Security Council\r\nreform to the General Assembly is the most recent\r\namong them. Brazil stands ready to support proposals\r\nthat have fundamental elements in common with that\r\nput forward by the group of four and other countries.\r\nWe are convinced that reform on the basis of the\r\nAfrican Union proposal would considerably improve\r\non the current structure of the Council and would\r\nreduce the imbalance of its composition. We stand\r\nready to work with African partners to bring about\r\nreform that corrects the historical imbalance in the\r\nCouncil’s composition, which today excludes entire\r\nregions of the developing world from the category of\r\npermanent members.\r\nAnother important development is the circulation\r\nby Costa Rica, Jordan, Liechtenstein, Singapore and\r\nSwitzerland of a proposal on the working methods of\r\nthe Security Council. Brazil attaches the utmost\r\nimportance to the issue of the practices of the Council.\r\nOur current two-year mandate on the Council has only\r\nreinforced our perception that there is an urgent need\r\nfor the Council to adopt a definitive set of rules of\r\nprocedure and to observe them more faithfully. It is\r\nprecisely because we attach such importance to the\r\nissue of working methods that a considerable portion\r\nof our own draft proposal was devoted to that question.\r\nIt is very clear that only through a comprehensive\r\napproach that deals with the issues of the Council’s\r\nworking methods and its composition will we, the\r\nMembers of the United Nations, be able to succeed in\r\nbringing the Council more into harmony with its\r\nmandate and with the views and the needs of all\r\nMember States.\r\nProgress achieved so far in the negotiations on\r\nthe establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission\r\nand the Human Rights Council demonstrates the\r\nfalseness of claims that the present consideration of the\r\nissue of Security Council reform somehow precludes\r\nforward movement on other important fronts of the\r\ninstitutional reform of the Organization.\r\nAs a matter of fact, one now faces the previously\r\nunimaginable possibility that those two proposals for\r\ninstitutional reform, on the Peacebuilding Commission\r\nand the Human Rights Council, could prosper without\r\nany corresponding developments on the composition\r\nand the working methods of the Security Council. That\r\nwould be very detrimental to the Organization’s\r\nbalance and harmony and should therefore be avoided.\r\nWe must ensure that progress is achieved in parallel on\r\nall aspects of institutional reform.\r\nA few countries, seeking to avoid any decision on\r\nthe matter, have taken refuge in appeals for consensus\r\nand in claims that the issue is “disruptive”. However,\r\ntheir actions only contribute to the perpetuation of\r\ncurrent inequalities in the structure of the Organization\r\nand to the frustration of the aspiration of all Members,\r\nin particular developing countries, to a more balanced\r\ndistribution of power in the Security Council.\r\n18\r\nA/60/PV.49\r\nOthers claim that what is a reasonable expansion\r\nof the Council would make it “unworkable” and would\r\nsacrifice the Council’s efficiency and effectiveness.\r\nThey fail to take into consideration that both efficiency\r\nand effectiveness are directly related to the perception\r\nof the legitimacy of the decisions that the Council\r\ntakes, and that that, in turn, is a function of a\r\nrepresentative composition.\r\nIt is time for the General Assembly to reach a\r\ndecision on the issue of Security Council expansion.\r\nAfter 12 years of discussion and after months of\r\nconsideration of concrete proposals, there can be no\r\ndenying that the issue is well known to all and ripe for\r\ndecision. With respect to the fact that such a decision\r\nwill most probably be taken by a vote, it should be\r\npointed out that this stems from the importance of the\r\nissue. That proven democratic method of coming to a\r\ndecision should frighten no one.\r\nMs. Lintonen (Finland): At the outset, I would\r\nlike to convey my delegation’s deep condolences to the\r\nfamilies of the victims of the bomb attacks that\r\noccurred yesterday in Jordan. We condemn in the\r\nstrongest terms those heinous acts of terrorism\r\ntargeting innocent civilians.\r\nLet me thank the President of the Security\r\nCouncil for this month, Ambassador Denisov of the\r\nRussian Federation, for introducing the annual report\r\nof the Security Council (A/60/2). I would also like to\r\ncommend the Secretariat for its efforts in producing the\r\nreport.\r\nWe must seize this opportunity to further the\r\ngoals of reform that were set for us in the 2005 World\r\nSummit Outcome (resolution 60/1). The momentum for\r\ninstitutional reform must not be lost. While stressing\r\nthe importance of the revitalization of the General\r\nAssembly and the need to restore the political stature\r\nof the General Assembly and strengthen the role of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council, Finland strongly\r\nsupports the reform and the enlargement of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nIn our view, any reform of the Council must aim\r\nat increasing both its legitimacy and its effectiveness.\r\nTo be truly effective in carrying out its primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security, the Council has to be seen as more\r\nlegitimate by the wider membership of the\r\nOrganization. At the same time, a more representative\r\nand thus more legitimate Council will, in the long run,\r\nbe more effective in carrying out its functions.\r\nFinland therefore supports an enlargement of the\r\nCouncil in both the permanent and the non-permanent\r\ncategories. However, for the Council to be both\r\neffective and legitimate, the veto right should not,\r\nunder any circumstances, be extended to new\r\npermanent members. Finland also strongly supports\r\nreform of the Council’s working methods in order to\r\nmake the Council more transparent, inclusive and\r\naccountable.\r\nTo conclude, I would like to reaffirm our support\r\nfor the aspiration of Germany and Japan to become\r\npermanent members of an enlarged Security Council,\r\nand for making the Council more representative by\r\nincluding representatives of developing countries from\r\nthe southern hemisphere.\r\nMr. Reyes Rodríguez (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nLike preceding speakers, I would like to express\r\nCuba’s solidarity with those who today expressed their\r\ncondolences for the victims of the recent terrorist\r\nattacks in Jordan. Cuba joins with those who have\r\nexpressed solidarity with the people, the authorities\r\nand the families of the victims.\r\nWe thank the Permanent Representative of\r\nRussia, Ambassador Andrey Denisov, for his\r\npresentation of the annual report of the Security\r\nCouncil (A/60/2), as well as the other members of the\r\nCouncil and Secretariat staff for their efforts in\r\npreparing this voluminous document, submitted to the\r\nGeneral Assembly in accordance with the provisions of\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations.\r\nThe report includes, once again, a brief summary,\r\nwhich is a positive adjustment to the format adopted in\r\nrecent years. However, we believe that the report,\r\nprecisely because it is such an important part of the\r\nCouncil’s institutional memory, should be subject to\r\nongoing, more thorough improvement in order to make\r\nit a document of greater analytical content.\r\nWhy not, for example, include the political and\r\nlegal bases of at least the most important resolutions\r\nadopted by the Council? And why not include in the\r\nreport what was not accomplished and the reasons for\r\nthat, particularly for cases on which the Council was\r\nunable to act or clearly lacked unity? The report should\r\nprovide a greater analysis of divided votes, especially\r\nfor cases in which a permanent member cast a negative\r\n19\r\nA/60/PV.49\r\nvote. For example, in the period under consideration,\r\nthe United States vetoed a draft resolution on the\r\nquestion of Palestine. Until changes can be made to the\r\nCouncil’s current working methods, the annual report\r\nshould include detailed information on the discussions\r\nheld in closed meetings. In our opinion, it is necessary\r\nand urgent to make changes of that nature to the annual\r\nreport.\r\nMeanwhile, the General Assembly has yet to\r\nreceive the special reports mentioned in Articles 15\r\nand 24 of the Charter. If such special reports were\r\nsubmitted, all Member States would be able to review\r\nwith the necessary frequency and thoroughness\r\ninformation relevant to the work of the Council, the\r\nprincipal organ, of limited membership, to which we\r\nhave entrusted the primary responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security and\r\nwhich, in accordance with the Charter, acts in our\r\nname.\r\nTherefore, it is vital to fully implement those\r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions — for example,\r\nresolutions 51/193, 58/126 and 59/313 — that contain\r\nprovisions to facilitate the Security Council’s proper\r\naccounting of its activities to the Assembly, which the\r\nMember States have the legitimate right to receive.\r\nThere cannot be a genuine reform of the United\r\nNations without a comprehensive reform of the\r\nSecurity Council, an organ where the principle of the\r\nsovereign equality of States is institutionally and\r\nflagrantly violated on a daily basis. It will not be\r\npossible to restore the rule of international law or make\r\nthe Organization truly democratic as long as the\r\nCouncil exercises totalitarian powers. Nor will the\r\nCouncil recover its credibility and the legitimacy of its\r\ndecisions as long as the super-Power continues to\r\nimpose its will by the force of arms and the use of its\r\nmoney for blackmail.\r\nWe have often reaffirmed that the veto should be\r\neliminated. But even after achieving the elimination of\r\nthat unjust privilege, nothing will change if the reform\r\nleaves untouched the unacceptable, aggressive conduct\r\nand the hegemonic ambition of the world’s most\r\npowerful country in terms of military and economic\r\npower, or fails to address the logic of domination and\r\npillage that governs the essential processes of the\r\ninternational economic and financial system,\r\ndisarmament and the precarious, temporary equilibrium\r\nof international security schemes. That set of factors\r\nprevents the majority of Council members from\r\nexercising their will and inhibits the General Assembly\r\nin its exercise of the considerable powers assigned to it\r\nby the Charter so that it can tackle the important\r\nchallenges arising from the world’s political, military\r\nand financial situation.\r\nTherefore, until the ultimate objective of\r\neliminating the veto can be achieved, it is necessary, as\r\na first step in that direction, to limit the veto’s use to\r\nactions taken under Chapter VII of the Charter.\r\nThe Security Council should be expanded to\r\ninclude new permanent and non-permanent members.\r\nThe new permanent and non-permanent members\r\njoining the Council as part of this expansion should\r\nreceive the same prerogatives as current permanent\r\nmembers. The basic objective of this expansion should\r\nbe to correct the underrepresentation of developing\r\ncountries in the Council’s membership. Cuba believes\r\nthat two or three countries from Africa, two or three\r\ncountries from Latin America and the Caribbean, and\r\ntwo or three developing countries from Asia should\r\njoin the Council as permanent members, with the same\r\npowers as current members, including the veto.\r\nHowever, Council reform cannot be limited to the\r\nquestion of the increase of its membership. It must\r\ninclude proposals for achieving with urgency a deep\r\ntransformation of its working methods in order to\r\nensure the Council’s democratic functioning and\r\nadequate transparency, including by taking the\r\nnecessary steps to end the provisional nature of its\r\nrules of procedure.\r\nAlthough one notes occasional efforts to increase\r\nthe number of open meetings of the Council, in our\r\nopinion those meetings still do not offer a real\r\nopportunity for the points of view of countries that are\r\nnot members of the Council to be properly taken into\r\naccount. The informal briefings, of varying quality and\r\nfrequency, carried out by the presidency and the\r\nsubsequent monthly reviews are the only mechanisms\r\nthat timidly allow us to obtain some information\r\nconcerning what takes place in the Council’s private\r\nconsultations.\r\nIt is regrettable that the Council continues to\r\ncarry out a great part of its work in closed meetings,\r\nparticularly in informal consultations, which, when\r\nthey are convened at the request of the most powerful\r\nof its members, cause peace-loving people throughout\r\nthe world to lose sleep. That practice contravenes the\r\n20\r\nA/60/PV.49\r\nCouncil’s own rules and has emphatically been called\r\nunacceptable by most States. In that context, we thank\r\nthose members of the Council that have made concrete\r\nefforts to give us timely information on what is taking\r\nplace in that principal organ.\r\nFurthermore, the Council distorts the Charter’s\r\nspirit and its provisions by means of its increasingly\r\nintrusive agenda, which usurps functions of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil. We note with concern the attempt to confer\r\nlegislative powers on the Security Council, something\r\nthat is beyond its mandate and is in clear violation of\r\nthe most fundamental principles of the law of treaties.\r\nWhile the Council oversteps its area of competence on\r\nsome issues, on others, regrettably and alarmingly, it\r\nmaintains a continuous state of paralysis, such as on\r\nthe current situation of the occupied Palestinian\r\nterritories.\r\nBefore concluding, I would like to recall that\r\nduring the fifty-ninth session of the Assembly, we saw\r\nthat the issue of Security Council reform continues to\r\nbe very sensitive. Today’s joint debate and those of the\r\npreceding days provide another opportunity for a better\r\nunderstanding of the respective positions of Member\r\nStates. We believe that the concerns, aspirations and\r\nspecific proposals expressed here could be studied in\r\ngreater depth to restart the work of the Assembly’s\r\nOpen-ended Working Group in order to finally make\r\nprogress on the far-reaching, comprehensive and just\r\nreform of the Security Council.\r\nMr. Sumaida’ie (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): At the\r\noutset, I join preceding speakers in condemning the\r\n9 November terrorist attacks in Amman, which killed\r\nand injured dozens of innocent civilians. On behalf of\r\nthe Government and the people of Iraq, I express my\r\ncondolences to the Government and the people of the\r\nbrotherly country of Jordan and to the families of the\r\nvictims. I express my appreciation to those who have\r\ncondemned the terrorist attacks in Iraq and who have\r\nexpressed their sympathy for the victims of daily\r\nterrorist acts. Terrorism has no homeland, nationality\r\nor religion. Terrorism can be defeated only by uniting\r\nour efforts in an international campaign to eliminate it.\r\nThe Open-ended Working Group on Council\r\nreform concluded its work and recommended that the\r\nitem continue to be considered at the current session of\r\nthe General Assembly. I take this opportunity to\r\nexpress my delegation’s appreciation for the efforts of\r\nthe President of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth\r\nsession, Mr. Jean Ping, who so ably guided the\r\nactivities of the Working Group.\r\nIt is more than ever necessary to reform the\r\nSecurity Council through an increase in its\r\nmembership, a review of the items on its agenda and an\r\nimprovement of its working methods, because the geo-\r\npolitical situation has changed dramatically since the\r\nUnited Nations was founded. We have to make sure\r\nthat such reform can keep pace with the changes that\r\nhave taken place.\r\nThe question of Security Council reform has been\r\non the agenda of the General Assembly since 1993.\r\nDuring that time, some progress has been made in the\r\ndiscussion of the various ideas and courses of action.\r\nHowever, the Assembly has not been able to take\r\ncritical decisions to adopt those proposals, except for\r\nthe resolution setting out the required majority needed\r\nto take a decision on Security Council reform and\r\nrelated matters.\r\nThat failure can be attributed in part to the fact\r\nthat all issues related to reform — in particular cluster\r\nII issues, on which there is some general consensus —\r\nhave been linked to the issue of the increase in the\r\nCouncil’s permanent and non-permanent membership.\r\nThere continue to be profound differences on that\r\nparticular issue, on which consultations reached a high\r\npoint in the second half of this year, when we saw draft\r\nresolutions submitted to the General Assembly. While\r\nthose draft resolutions touched on various cluster II\r\nissues, they focused mainly on an increase of the\r\nmembership of the Council.\r\nWe believe that further improvement of the\r\nCouncil’s working methods will bring us closer to\r\nagreement on the increase of its membership. My\r\ndelegation reaffirms the need for Member States to\r\nstrive to find common ground on the issue of the\r\nexpansion of the Council’s membership.\r\nDelegations have put forward valuable opinions\r\nand views with the aim of making progress on general\r\nUnited Nations reform before moving on to the specific\r\nquestion of Security Council reform. The 2005 World\r\nSummit Outcome (resolution 60/1) adopted by heads of\r\nState and Government in September gave impetus to\r\nthat line of action, especially as the outcome document\r\nplaced no special emphasis on Security Council\r\nreform.\r\n21\r\nA/60/PV.49\r\nWe now note that members of the United Nations\r\nare thoroughly preoccupied with the issue of\r\nestablishing important structures that will contribute\r\ngreatly to the reform of the Organization. In addition,\r\nthe results and recommendations of the Independent\r\nInquiry Committee of the “oil-for-food” programme\r\nhave contributed to the reform of the Secretariat. It is\r\nnecessary to improve transparency and accountability\r\nin the Secretariat and other organs in order to restore\r\nthe credibility of the United Nations and to reassure\r\nMember States that they can entrust important funds to\r\nthe United Nations and be confident that those funds\r\nwill be spent responsibly and appropriately.\r\nLike other delegations that have spoken on the\r\nissue of Security Council reform, my delegation\r\nbelieves that it is important to increase the Council’s\r\nmembership in a way that makes it more\r\nrepresentative, that better reflects the greatly increased\r\nmembership of the Organization over the past 60 years\r\nand that does not undermine the Council’s efficiency\r\nand effectiveness. At the same time, however, my\r\ndelegation attaches special importance to the cluster II\r\nissues on the improvement of the Council’s working\r\nmethods, because those issues affect the interests of all\r\nMember States, whereas the increase of the Council’s\r\nmembership, especially in the category of permanent\r\nmembers, affects the interests of only a limited number\r\nof States.\r\nSince the fifty-seventh session, the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on Council reform has covered\r\nimportant ground in examining cluster II issues, on\r\nsome of which there is agreement in principle.\r\nHowever, that agreement cannot be secured until it is\r\nincorporated into the Council’s rules of procedure.\r\nThere are some cluster II issues that we wish to\r\nunderline, foremost among which is the issue of\r\nsanctions regimes. I can speak of sanctions regimes\r\nfrom personal experience, because my country suffered\r\nthe side effects of sanctions for 13 years and continues\r\nto suffer the consequences of those sanctions. We fully\r\nagree with the report of the Working-Group, which\r\nstates that “sanctions should be designed in such a\r\nmanner so that their long-term effects are considered\r\nand their effects on civilian populations are minimized\r\nor avoided on the basis of an assessment of\r\nhumanitarian impact” (A/59/47, Annex II, para. 16).\r\nMy delegation wishes to underline that the\r\npurpose of sanctions, as set out in the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations, is to rectify wrong action and modify\r\nthe behaviour of regimes that the Security Council has\r\nfound not to be in compliance with its resolutions.\r\nSanctions are not to be used to undermine States or\r\ndestroy their social fabric. Sanctions are to be an\r\nindividual form of punishment that targets persons and\r\nregimes, and not a form of collective punishment that\r\ntargets an entire population or country. We therefore\r\nbelieve that it is important to use the points agreed\r\nupon in that regard in the 2005 World Summit\r\nOutcome document to guide the Security Council’s\r\nwork in improving sanctions regimes.\r\nWith respect to the veto, we agree with those that\r\nprefer to add this issue to cluster II. We hope to see the\r\nuse of the veto restricted as greatly as possible, first by\r\nlimiting its use to issues that fall under Chapter VII of\r\nthe Charter and, secondly, by adopting measures to\r\nplace controls on its use.\r\nWe believe that the proposal contained in\r\nparagraph 257 of the report of the High-level Panel on\r\nThreats, Challenges and Change (A/59/565) for the\r\nintroduction of a procedure of “indicative voting” in\r\nthe Security Council would contribute to a greater\r\nelucidation of the reasons behind “no” votes and thus\r\nlimit the use of the veto.\r\nAnother issue is that of the threat to international\r\npeace and security posed by terrorism — and the\r\nmeans to combat it. Since terrorism is a social\r\nphenomenon, it must be confronted with international\r\nparticipation. We therefore stress the importance of the\r\nCounter-Terrorism Committee and the Security Council\r\nCommittee on the non-proliferation of weapons of\r\nmass destruction, established pursuant to Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001) and resolution 1540\r\n(2004) respectively. States have a responsibility to\r\nfully cooperate with those two Committees. We believe\r\nit is necessary for these issues to receive the attention\r\nand sponsorship they deserve, first, because they\r\naccount for a major portion of the Security Council\r\nagenda and, secondly, because improving the\r\nCommittees’ monitoring and implementation\r\nmachinery and the subsequent implementation by\r\ncountries of their obligations under the two resolutions\r\nwould enhance the means of combating terrorism.\r\nIn that regard, strengthening communication and\r\ncooperation between regional organizations and the\r\ntwo Committees and enhancing related programmes\r\n22\r\nA/60/PV.49\r\nand mechanisms would further strengthen the\r\neffectiveness of international counter-terrorism efforts.\r\nThat leads us to the role of regional organizations\r\nin maintaining international peace and security. We\r\nbelieve it is important and pragmatic to ensure that\r\nregional organizations play their vital role in the\r\nresolution of regional conflicts and in peacebuilding.\r\nThat means implementation of Chapter VIII of the\r\nCharter, while ensuring that there is no infringement\r\nupon the Security Council’s obligations under the\r\nCharter. In addition, it would strengthen respect for and\r\nprotection of human rights.\r\nI wish in conclusion to note that the recent years\r\nhave seen an increase in the number of Security\r\nCouncil meetings open to non-members. There has also\r\nbeen an increase in the participation of non-members\r\nin the Council’s deliberations, when those deliberations\r\npertain to the interests of those States. While we\r\nwelcome such developments, we look forward to\r\nconsolidating the practice in a manner that activates\r\nArticle 31 of the Charter and that has a positive impact\r\non openness and transparency in the work of the\r\nCouncil.\r\nMr. Skinner-Klée (Guatemala) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): I wish to begin by conveying our heartfelt\r\ncondolences to the people and the Government of the\r\nHashemite Kingdom of Jordan on the dreadful terrorist\r\nattacks that took place on 9 November in Amman,\r\nwhich have taken a heavy toll in innocent lives.\r\nWe wish to thank Ambassador Andrey Denisov,\r\nPermanent Representative of the Russian Federation to\r\nthe United Nations, for introducing, in his capacity as\r\nPresident of the Security Council for the month of\r\nNovember, the Council’s annual report (A/60/2).\r\nEven though the link between the two items on\r\nwhich we are today holding a joint debate is obvious,\r\nwe remain of the view that the report of the Security\r\nCouncil is sufficiently important to warrant separate\r\nconsideration, particularly at a time when we are trying\r\nto find new ways to improve the principal organs of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nIn that connection, it is interesting to highlight a\r\ncurious point, namely the fact that the report of the\r\nSecurity Council is mentioned expressly in two distinct\r\nand separate provisions of the United Nations Charter:\r\nArticle 15, paragraph 1, and Article 24, paragraph 3.\r\nThese provisions are contained, respectively, in\r\nChapters IV and V of the Charter, which are entirely\r\ndevoted respectively to the General Assembly and to\r\nthe Security Council.\r\nIt is also of interest to point out that, as far as\r\nsubstance is concerned, the former provision refers\r\nexplicitly to the functions that the Security Council\r\nperforms within the framework of Chapter VII, to\r\nmaintain international peace and security.\r\nFrom those characteristics of the Charter we infer\r\nthe importance that its authors attached to the report of\r\nthe Council: that it should reflect the developments that\r\nhave taken place within the Council, which in turn\r\nshould be the object of analysis and consideration by\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nThat should come as no surprise considering that\r\nthe report is the only formal link between the General\r\nAssembly and the Security Council and that those two\r\nprincipal organs of the United Nations exercise\r\nfunctions and powers in the area of the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. We should also be\r\naware of the importance of that link as a means of\r\nensuring the indispensable coordination and\r\ncomplementarity between the two organs’ activities in\r\nthat field, which, as the International Court of Justice\r\nhas correctly observed, constitutes the most important\r\nof the purposes of the United Nations.\r\nThe Security Council’s annual report to the\r\nGeneral Assembly must therefore be more than a\r\nmerely symbolic or ritualistic act. It should not just be\r\na formal, procedural act but a matter of substance. In\r\nother words, it is not enough for the report barely to\r\nmeet the minimum requirements to qualify as one,\r\nwhen in reality it is a mere outline, without even a\r\ndetailed account of the votes that have taken place. The\r\nreport should be the principal nexus between the two\r\norgans. And, above all, given the close relationship\r\nbetween the maintenance of peace and all the other\r\nfunctions of the United Nations, the report should be a\r\ntool enabling the General Assembly to fulfil its role as\r\nthe principal deliberative and policy organ of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nGuatemala appreciates the efforts that have been\r\nmade to significantly improve, and even to slightly\r\nalter, the key characteristics of the introduction to the\r\nreport. The report nevertheless continues to be\r\npredominantly a descriptive, routine collection of\r\ndocuments with its emphasis on a chronological\r\n23\r\nA/60/PV.49\r\naccount of what the Council has done and what, as a\r\nmatter of public record, has occurred within it.\r\nRegrettably, the report lacks an evaluation of the\r\ndifficulties, advances, setbacks and obstacles that have\r\narisen in the Council’s endeavours to resolve the\r\nconflicts that threaten international peace and security.\r\nTherefore, the report of the Council should become\r\nmore substantial in order to promote a debate on how\r\nthe future work of that organ can be improved.\r\nAlthough the item on our agenda is the\r\nconsideration of the report of the Security Council, we\r\nshould not pass over in silence or refrain from stressing\r\nthe fact that the report must cease to be nothing more\r\nthan a bare record, a mere yearbook, and should\r\nbecome an annotated agenda on the Council’s\r\ndeliberations, reflecting the various positions taken and\r\nmatters that have prompted debate.\r\nIn its present form, the report of the Council does\r\nnot help us understand the nature of the situations that\r\ndisrupt international peace and security. The lack of an\r\nanalytical rather than chronological report means that\r\nquestions affecting all of humanity are understood by\r\nless than one tenth of the membership of the United\r\nNations. In an interdependent and globalized world,\r\nthat is an anachronism that does not serve the purposes\r\nof the Organization. It is a practice that we must review\r\nin order to adopt methods of work that impart greater\r\ntransparency to the deliberations of the Security\r\nCouncil, which will not only make the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security more viable but also\r\nadvance the promotion of friendly relations between\r\nnations and strengthen the international cooperation\r\nthat is required for resolving the problems that plague\r\nhumanity.\r\nTo be sure, in one area that is of particular\r\nimportance to my delegation — the transparency of the\r\nCouncil’s working methods and achieving closer\r\ninterchange with States not represented on it — the\r\nCouncil has made significant progress. But there is\r\nroom for more progress. In particular, we must extend,\r\nas much as possible, the practice of holding public\r\nmeetings of the Council, with the greatest possible\r\nnumber of interested parties in attendance.\r\nGuatemala is firmly committed to the process of\r\nUnited Nations reform, as laid down in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration (resolution 55/2) and the 2005 World\r\nSummit Outcome (resolution 60/1). The question of\r\nreforming the United Nations system has given rise to\r\nthe most heated debates during the past few months of\r\nthe work of the Assembly.\r\nWe trust that significant advances will be possible\r\nin realizing this necessary and urgent reform, advances\r\nthat will take into account all the institutions and\r\nmechanisms of the Organization, wherever improved\r\nand more efficient functioning is needed. Guatemala is\r\nready to contribute to the process with ideas and by\r\ntaking part in a constructive dialogue with all Member\r\nStates.\r\nWe are grateful for initiatives such as that of the\r\nrepresentatives of Costa Rica, Jordan, Liechtenstein,\r\nSingapore and Switzerland in connection with a draft\r\nresolution on improving the working methods of the\r\nCouncil. Guatemala appreciates their proposal. We feel\r\nthat such contributions will unquestionably enrich the\r\ndialogue among Member States and will activate the\r\nprocess of implementing the 2005 World Summit\r\nOutcome (resolution 60/1).\r\nBefore briefly touching upon some of the\r\nprinciples that inform my delegation’s views on the\r\nsubject of Security Council reform, I wish to convey\r\nmy gratitude to the former President of the General\r\nAssembly, Mr. Jean Ping, for his leadership in the work\r\nof the Open-ended Working Group, as well as to the\r\nVice-Chairpersons of that body, the representative of\r\nthe Bahamas, Ms. Paulette Bethel, and the\r\nrepresentative of Liechtenstein, Mr. Christian\r\nWenaweser. The Working Group’s report has provided\r\nvery interesting information, analysis and reflection on\r\nthe issue that concerns us today.\r\nFor Guatemala, Security Council reform is a\r\ncrucial element, but one that is inevitably linked to the\r\nwider process of United Nations reform. An effective\r\ncollective security system necessarily requires the\r\ncomprehensive strengthening of multilateralism and\r\nthe United Nations. This is why, in our view, Security\r\nCouncil reform should not concentrate solely on\r\nincreasing the number of members; it should also\r\ninclude a comprehensive review of the Council’s\r\nworking methods and the decision-making process.\r\nI wish to reiterate my country’s conviction that\r\nthe Council needs to be more representative,\r\ntransparent and efficient. That is why we advocate an\r\nincrease in its membership. We agree that such an\r\nincrease should apply to both categories of\r\nmembership — permanent and non-permanent —\r\ntaking special care to ensure adequate geographical\r\n24\r\nA/60/PV.49\r\nrepresentation and the inclusion of both developed and\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nGuatemala favours continuing efforts to make the\r\nCouncil more open and accessible, in the interest of\r\ngreater transparency, so as to demonstrate that, as the\r\nCharter specifies, the Council is truly acting “on ...\r\nbehalf” of Member States and, accordingly, in the\r\ninterest of the international community — and\r\nenjoying at all times the valuable contributions of\r\ninterested States.\r\nWe support better coordination among the\r\nSecurity Council, the General Assembly and the\r\nEconomic and Social Council so as to guarantee\r\ncontinuity in the Organization’s peacekeeping and\r\npeacebuilding activities, always preserving the\r\nresponsibilities and powers specific to each United\r\nNations organ, in conformity with the Charter.\r\nWe would also like to see an analysis of relations\r\nwith the other principal organs of the United Nations.\r\nHere, we consider that reference should have been\r\nmade to the experience gained from the Economic and\r\nSocial Council’s ad hoc advisory groups — on African\r\ncountries emerging from conflict, such as Guinea-\r\nBissau and Burundi, and on Haiti. Through their own\r\nmechanisms, these have improved coordination\r\nbetween the Security Council and the Economic and\r\nSocial Council. We believe that this has helped\r\npromote a holistic focus responding to both security\r\nissues and economic issues in the transition and\r\nrecovery phases.\r\nFinally, Guatemala reaffirms its commitment to\r\nparticipate actively in the future discussions on\r\nSecurity Council reform. That goes hand in hand with\r\nour aspiration to be elected next year by the Assembly,\r\nfor the first time, to a non-permanent seat on the\r\nSecurity Council, which will enable us to continue to\r\ncontribute to the process of reforming the working\r\nmethods of the Council.\r\nMr. Lidén (Sweden): First of all, I wish to\r\nexpress my sincere condolences to the delegation of\r\nJordan and to the families and friends of all of the\r\nvictims of the terrorist attacks that took place in\r\nAmman. The Swedish Government condemns, in the\r\nstrongest possible terms, those who planned and\r\ncarried out that horrible crime.\r\nTwo months ago, we took important steps to\r\nreform the United Nations. Once implemented, those\r\ndecisions will strengthen our ability to cope with\r\ncurrent global threats and challenges. The 2005 High-\r\nlevel Plenary Meeting clearly spelled out the need for\r\nearly reform of the Security Council in order to make it\r\nmore broadly representative, efficient and transparent.\r\nEqually important, reform of the Security Council was\r\nseen as part of the overall effort to reform the United\r\nNations.\r\nWe are pleased that negotiations are now under\r\nway on several of the reform issues. But we must also\r\nproceed to address the outstanding ones. We therefore\r\nwelcome today’s debate on the crucial issue of Security\r\nCouncil reform.\r\nSweden is among the Member States that have\r\nadvocated reform of the Security Council since the\r\nearly 1990s. For the Security Council to remain the\r\nprimary body in our collective security system, its\r\nlegitimacy and effectiveness must be assured.\r\nSweden believes that, on the one hand, the\r\nSecurity Council should be expanded, allowing\r\nstronger representation from Africa, Asia and Latin\r\nAmerica. On the other hand, the Security Council must\r\nbe an effective body that can act quickly and in a\r\ntransparent way. We therefore believe that the veto\r\npower should not be extended to new members.\r\nInstead, a veto-free culture should be promoted.\r\nFurthermore, the Security Council’s working methods,\r\nits transparency and its dialogue with other United\r\nNations bodies must be strengthened. We welcome the\r\nefforts to that end by the delegations of Costa Rica,\r\nJordan, Liechtenstein, Singapore and Switzerland.\r\nBy the end of the year, we should come to an\r\nagreement on how we can invigorate the process and\r\ncarry it forward into 2006. As Sweden has said many\r\ntimes before, non-action on this matter is not an option.\r\nFor our part, we are ready to contribute to finding a\r\nsolution that will be broadly accepted and thus seen as\r\ntruly legitimate.\r\nAfter years of debate, we much reach an\r\nagreement on reform of the Security Council. Let us\r\nuse the momentum of the High-level Plenary Meeting\r\nto continue to move forward on this issue. In the end,\r\nour global response to the threats and challenges of\r\ntoday will depend on our resolve to reform the United\r\nNations, including the body that has the primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security.\r\n25\r\nA/60/PV.49\r\nMrs. Holguín (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nAllow me to add our voice of rejection and\r\ncondemnation in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks\r\nin Jordan. We reaffirm our support and solidarity to the\r\nGovernment and the people of Jordan.\r\nWe would like to thank Ambassador Denisov,\r\nPermanent Representative of the Russian Federation\r\nand current President of the Security Council, for\r\nhaving introduced the report of the Security Council to\r\nthe General Assembly (A/60/2). The report reviews all\r\nthe situations considered in the Council. It depicts the\r\ncomplexity of those situations, particularly in Africa\r\nand in the Middle East. We support every effort to\r\nachieve stability and peace in those regions. We\r\nacknowledge the work of the Council during this\r\nparticularly complex reporting period.\r\nAs in previous years, I would like to reiterate that\r\nwe would have preferred to see a document including\r\nnot only a summary of the questions under\r\nconsideration, but also with some content on the\r\nCouncil’s decision-making process.\r\nWe support the progress made on the issue of\r\ncounter-terrorism and commend the chairmen of the\r\ncommittees for their work. We believe that we must not\r\nlose our initial enthusiasm, since that issue is key to\r\nworld peace and security. There is no doubt that\r\nmeaningful progress has been made and that support\r\nmechanisms for States seeking assistance in efficiently\r\ncombating terrorism should be strengthened and\r\nconsolidated in order to continue enhancing the global\r\nfight through multilateralism.\r\nWe also welcome the field missions undertaken\r\nby the Council. We believe that they are a way to learn\r\nabout and understand realities in their true context and\r\nscope, based on clear and first-hand information. They\r\nwill allow us to take more appropriate decisions and to\r\nfind proper solutions to every situation.\r\nIn that regard, we acknowledge the work\r\nundertaken by the Ambassador of Brazil, Mr. Ronaldo\r\nMota Sardenberg, during that Council’s mission to\r\nHaiti. The situation in Haiti requires a coordinated and\r\nlong-term effort by the United Nations to strengthen\r\ndemocratic institutions there and to draw up a\r\nsustainable and comprehensive development strategy\r\nthat would ensure the economic and social progress\r\nand well-being of the people, as well as political\r\nstability in a secure and peaceful environment. The\r\nCouncil must lead the first phase of stabilization and\r\nthe United Nations system must respond through\r\neconomic development programmes that promote\r\nsustainability in the efforts and commitments made by\r\nthe Haitian authorities and the international community\r\nin its support and cooperation.\r\nWe believe that a review of the Council’s\r\nworking methods to promote transparency and the\r\nparticipation of non-member States is essential,\r\nespecially given that, as stated in the report,\r\n“The past 12 months reaffirmed the trend\r\nobserved in recent years towards a continuous\r\nincrease in the volume and scope of the activities\r\nof the Security Council.” (A/60/2, p. 1)\r\nThat continuous increase in the activities of the\r\nCouncil warrants broader consultation with Member\r\nStates, regional groups and other relevant actors in\r\norder to allow the Council to take better informed\r\ndecisions aimed at finding viable and definitive\r\nresolutions for certain situations.\r\nIn order to ensure effectiveness and successful\r\nresults, the Council must focus on threats to\r\ninternational peace and security. Opening the agenda to\r\nitems not directly related to its core mandate could\r\naffect its efficiency and reliability in the exercise of its\r\nduties. Just as the Arria Formula has proven its worth\r\nduring the Council’s consultations with non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and members of civil\r\nsociety, we believe that it is necessary and urgent to\r\nseek a similar formula for holding consultations with\r\nStates. It could be implemented immediately and\r\nwould require only the Council’s willingness to do so.\r\nA formula to enable States to address substantive\r\nissues alongside the Council would help Council\r\nmembers to gain access to broader and more accurate\r\ninformation on national and regional realities, which\r\ncould only help the Council to take decisions that are\r\nmore appropriate to particular contexts and thus find\r\nlasting solutions to issues under consideration.\r\nIn seeking sustainable solutions, its main\r\nobjective, we believe that the Council should broaden\r\nits focus on the follow-up to situations on its agenda.\r\nMonitoring alone will not help to solve problems. We\r\nbelieve that the Council must also propose suggestions\r\nto the system so that it can mobilize, design and carry\r\nout impact projects to contribute to solving crises. A\r\nbetter identification of national needs will help the\r\nCouncil better to address crises and find lasting\r\nsolutions.\r\n26\r\nA/60/PV.49\r\nWith respect to the issue of working methods, we\r\nbelieve that broad consultations would help in the\r\ndrafting of proposals to improve the Council’s actions\r\nin exercise of its mandate. In that regard, we believe\r\nthat the initiative of Costa Rica, Jordan, Liechtenstein,\r\nSingapore and Switzerland to invite Member States to\r\ndiscuss that issue is constructive, and we are open to\r\ndiscussing it as a new element that could enrich our\r\ndebate.\r\nI reaffirm my country’s commitment to reforming\r\nthe Council’s composition pursuant to the guidelines\r\nand proposals submitted by the Uniting for Consensus\r\ngroup and contained in document A/59/L.68. That\r\nproposal has major strengths. It is flexible, democratic,\r\nopen and participatory and has a regional dimension\r\nthat is unique in this debate. It would prevent the\r\nwidening of differences within the multilateral system.\r\nWe believe that Security Council reform falls within\r\nthe larger reform being undertaken. We have expended\r\na great deal of time and energy on the issue in the past,\r\nand it has distracted us from other issues of great\r\nimportance to most of our countries.\r\nWe welcome the focus of the presidency of\r\nMr. Jan Eliasson on reforms that will meet the needs\r\nand alleviate the problems of peoples, which are\r\nultimately those who must benefit from the decisions\r\nwe take here. We believe that the major challenges the\r\nUnited Nations faces require unity among all its\r\nMembers if it is to be respond efficiently and\r\neffectively to the world’s great tests. It must seek unity,\r\ncooperation and consensus among its Members. Those\r\nessential elements should be our guidelines throughout\r\nthe reform process, including that of the Security\r\nCouncil’s working methods and expansion.\r\nMs. Moses (Nauru): On behalf of the\r\nGovernment and people of Nauru, I wish to express our\r\ndeepest sympathy to the Government and people of the\r\nHashemite Kingdom of Jordan for the tragic loss of\r\nlives in the terrorist attacks in Amman.\r\nMy delegation thanks you, Sir, for the\r\nopportunity to discuss agenda item 9, “Report of the\r\nSecurity Council”, and agenda item 117, “Question of\r\nequitable representation on and increase in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council and related\r\nmatters”.\r\nI shall restrict my remarks to agenda item 117.\r\nNauru strongly believes that the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council lies with the need to recognize the\r\nintrinsic connection between the pillars that uphold the\r\nUnited Nations system. In that regard, we are\r\ndisappointed by the relative inaction by Member States\r\nin seeking progress on Security Council reform.\r\nNauru welcomes the high priority accorded to the\r\ndevelopment agenda at the world summit.\r\nComprehensive work has been carried out on the\r\nestablishment of a human rights council. Texts are now\r\nbeing discussed for the establishment of a\r\npeacebuilding commission.\r\nEqually important is the need to reform the\r\nSecurity Council and to recognize that international\r\ndevelopment since the establishment of that body many\r\ndecades ago now demands a more democratic\r\nrepresentation of the global family in an expanded\r\nSecurity Council. The earlier those reforms are\r\nimplemented, the earlier the work of the United\r\nNations can be further improved. Security Council\r\nreform must occur simultaneously with the\r\nestablishment of the human rights council and the\r\npeacebuilding commission, and with United Nations\r\nmanagement reforms. Otherwise, the pillars upon\r\nwhich this body was founded will not hold up to the\r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century.\r\nNauru co-sponsored the reform proposal by the\r\nG-4 countries contained in document A/59/L.64, which\r\nwas introduced at the fifty-ninth session. It is my\r\ndelegation’s strong view that this is still the only draft\r\nresolution that provides a proper and complete\r\nframework for change and to improve the current\r\nstructure of the Security Council. It is the only draft\r\nresolution that protects the interests of all States, large\r\nand small, showing no bias to any particular region or\r\ngroup. My delegation would further welcome its\r\nreintroduction at the sixtieth session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nNauru reaffirms its position that an expanded\r\nSecurity Council must include Brazil, Germany, India\r\nand Japan. Ultimately, the success of the United\r\nNations will depend on a reformed and enlarged\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nMr. Maema (Lesotho): We wish to join the many\r\nvoices that have condemned the terrorist bombings in\r\nAmman, Jordan, and on behalf of the Government and\r\nthe people of Lesotho, I convey our deepest sympathy\r\n27\r\nA/60/PV.49\r\nand condolences to the victims of the attacks, their\r\nfamilies, and the people and the Government of Jordan.\r\nLet me express my delegation’s appreciation to\r\nthe President of the Security Council for the month of\r\nNovember 2005, Mr. Andrey Denisov, Permanent\r\nRepresentative of the Russian Federation, for\r\nintroducing the report of the Security Council to the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nThe delegation of Lesotho fully associates itself\r\nwith the statement delivered by the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Nigeria on behalf of the African\r\nGroup. However, we wish to highlight a few issues that\r\nare of particular interest to Lesotho.\r\nWe have noted an improvement in the quality and\r\ncontent of the report of the Security Council. My\r\ndelegation welcomes improvements made in the\r\nworking methods of the Council, particularly the\r\nincrease in the number of meetings held in public.\r\nHowever, we believe that there still exists room for\r\nfurther improvement. Indeed, the need for the Security\r\nCouncil to enhance its accountability to the entire\r\nUnited Nations membership and to increase the\r\ntransparency of its work was reiterated by the heads of\r\nState and Government at the recent millennium review\r\nsummit in September.\r\nMy delegation therefore welcomes progress made\r\nover the years, though it has been very slow, by the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on the Question of\r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters\r\nRelated to the Security Council, particularly under\r\ncluster II concerning the working methods of the\r\nCouncil and the transparency of its work. At this\r\njuncture, let me congratulate Ambassadors Paulette\r\nBethel of the Bahamas and Christian Wenaweser of\r\nLiechtenstein, the two Vice-Chairpersons of the\r\nWorking Group, for the magnificent manner in which\r\nthey steered deliberations on very complex issues in\r\nthe Working Group, and also for preparing a concise\r\nreport. My delegation looks forward to future\r\ndeliberations of the Working Group. We sincerely hope\r\nthey will be approached with renewed spirits,\r\nparticularly after the recent review summit.\r\nFurthermore, my delegation wishes to express its\r\nappreciation for proposals contained in the informal\r\npaper circulated by Costa Rica, Jordan, Liechtenstein,\r\nSingapore and Switzerland on the working methods of\r\nthe Council. In our view, the paper provides a useful\r\nbasis on which the United Nations membership can\r\nfurther build.\r\nThe Kingdom of Lesotho continues to believe\r\nthat the issues of the working methods of the Council\r\nand of the expansion of its membership are both\r\ncapable of resolution. What is required is the necessary\r\npolitical will and genuine commitment to making\r\ntangible progress on those issues. In September, heads\r\nof State and Government requested the General\r\nAssembly to review progress on the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council by the end of this year. They\r\nreiterated the fact that the Council has to be, among\r\nother things, broadly representative and more\r\nlegitimate.\r\nThe report of the Security Council confirms the\r\nfact that, as has been the case in previous years, the\r\nCouncil was in the past year mostly preoccupied by\r\ncrises in Africa. It is therefore a hard fact that Africa’s\r\nrepresentation in the Security Council needs to be\r\nenhanced to reflect the continent’s interests and\r\nperceptions. The Common African Position, as\r\ncontained in the Ezulwini Consensus and in the Sirte\r\nDeclaration, is well known. It calls for two permanent\r\nseats, with the prerogatives and privileges of\r\npermanent membership, and five non-permanent seats\r\nfor Africa. We therefore appeal to this body to heed\r\nAfrica’s call for support for its position, for it is driven\r\nnot by the interests of one country, but by a strong\r\ndesire to empower a region facing various crises\r\nrelating to international peace and security.\r\nMr. Berruga (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): At the\r\noutset, I would like to express to the people and\r\nGovernment of Jordan Mexico’s deepest condolences\r\nand condemnation of the despicable terrorist attacks\r\nperpetrated two days ago in Amman. At this difficult\r\ntime, we affirm our solidarity towards our Jordanian\r\nfriends.\r\nThroughout last year, Security Council reform\r\noccupied a salient place in the discussions of the\r\nMembers of the United Nations. At the outset of this\r\nnew round of consultations, it seems worthwhile asking\r\nourselves: Why does that issue prompt such priority\r\ninterest? There are three possible explanations.\r\nThe first is that the Security Council is the organ\r\nthat is showing the clearest symptoms of being in crisis\r\nand that therefore requires the most urgent attention.\r\nThat is highly debatable. The Security Council may not\r\nnecessarily be the organ in the most critical situation.\r\n28\r\nA/60/PV.49\r\nThe second reason is that the Security Council\r\nhas consolidated itself as the most influential organ of\r\nthe United Nations and that any alteration to it will\r\ntherefore have important repercussions on the general\r\nfunctioning of the system. That assumption appears to\r\nbe closer to reality.\r\nThe third reason — of a more political nature —\r\nis that the international balance of power is currently\r\nsubject to revision. That would explain the sharp\r\ninterest being shown in the issues of its composition,\r\nnumber of seats and categories — permanent and non-\r\npermanent — of new membership. We may therefore\r\nassume that those States occupying a seat in the new\r\nstructure would enjoy some sort of confirmation of the\r\nposition they occupy on the world scene. That\r\nassumption could also explain why little attention has\r\nbeen given to other Security Council reform issues,\r\nsuch as its working methods and its real capacity to\r\ndeal with the new threats to international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nThose three assumptions could bring greater\r\nobjectivity to the reactivation of Security Council\r\nreform. In any case, it is clear that the exposure\r\nenjoyed by that issue during the months leading to the\r\nsummit overshadowed our vision and diverted our\r\nattention from other reform matters of equally major\r\nimportance.\r\nWe now face the challenge of making headway in\r\nthat most sensitive issue without neglecting issues of\r\noverall reform. In order to achieve that two-fold\r\npurpose, it would seem advisable to draw lessons from\r\nthe consultations and debates of the recent past.\r\nBeginning today, our efforts to reform the Security\r\nCouncil have an opportunity to be launched with a\r\nfresh vision, to avoid polarization among Members and\r\nto rebuild an organ better equipped to tackle the main\r\nthreats to international peace and security.\r\nBeyond its final composition, we cannot afford to\r\nignore the fact that the new Security Council will be\r\njudged by its results and by its capacity to exert a\r\npositive influence on international realities. That is\r\nwhy, in inaugurating this new round of discussions, we\r\nmust ensure that the substance of the Security\r\nCouncil’s raison d’être prevails over its institutional\r\nand structural arrangements. We will have failed if the\r\nreform of the Security Council does not translate into\r\ngreater guarantees for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. We will have wasted an\r\nunprecedented opportunity to build a Security Council\r\nfit to meet the current and future necessities of the\r\nworld.\r\nSecurity Council reform has no alternative but to\r\nfocus on creating the best collective security system\r\npossible. At the end of the day, our nations will have to\r\nassess and judge whether we have attained a visionary\r\nreform able to respond to the major threats of this era.\r\nThat judgement will be based on the Security Council’s\r\nefficiency in resolving conflicts in the field and its\r\ncapacity to improve the security of our peoples. It will\r\nalso be based on the support and legitimacy that its\r\ndecisions and mandates enjoy in the eyes of the world\r\ncommunity. If it is to meet those conditions —\r\nefficiency, legitimacy and accountability — the reform\r\nof the Security Council must be a product of broad\r\nintergovernmental negotiation in which the current\r\ndeficiencies of the system and of the collective\r\nstrategies to address threats are clearly exposed.\r\nMexico believes that we will have taken a major\r\nstep if the progress report requested of the President of\r\nthe General Assembly by our leaders at the summit can\r\naccurately pinpoint the system’s principal\r\nshortcomings, the major flaws of the sanction regimes,\r\nthe key issues concerning peacekeeping operations,\r\nand the mediation capacity and accountability\r\nmechanisms of the Security Council, inter alia.\r\nConsidering the lessons learned in the past year, we\r\ncan state that it will be futile and useless to try to\r\nreform a main organ of the United Nations without a\r\nshared diagnosis of its needs, bottlenecks and real\r\ncapacity to fulfil its most sensitive tasks. Without such\r\na diagnosis, we cannot understand the operational\r\nproblems of the Council that we are trying to resolve.\r\nIn short, the Security Council reform process should\r\nadjust itself to a logic and dynamic that would ensure\r\nthe delivery of relevant results and resolve the real\r\nproblems.\r\nIn that respect, my delegation feels that the\r\ninitiative proposed by Costa Rica, Jordan,\r\nLiechtenstein, Singapore and Switzerland is a step in\r\nthe right direction. That effort underscores the central\r\nquestions of the Council’s functionality and operations.\r\nIf duly complemented by the diagnosis and\r\nnegotiations that Mexico is proposing, we believe that\r\nthe progress report that has been requested in the\r\nsummit’s outcome document will be of special value,\r\nsince it could serve as a useful basis for the decision-\r\nmaking process regarding Security Council reform.\r\n29\r\nA/60/PV.49\r\nMr. Matulay (Slovakia): The Government of\r\nSlovakia joins other members of the international\r\ncommunity in expressing its utter abhorrence and\r\ncondemnation of the multiple attacks perpetrated in\r\nJordan’s capital, Amman. The people and Government\r\nof Slovakia are greatly shocked by that hideous act of\r\nterrorism and express deep sympathy for the bereaved\r\nfamilies and friends of the victims.\r\nSlovakia strongly condemns terrorism in all of its\r\nforms and manifestations, particularly indiscriminate\r\nterror against innocent civilians. We must continue to\r\nfulfil our obligations in enhancing measures to\r\neliminate international terrorism, including the\r\nadoption of a comprehensive convention on terrorism\r\nand a counter-terrorism strategy.\r\nI would like to convey my delegation’s\r\nappreciation to the Permanent Representative of the\r\nRussian Federation, Ambassador Andrey Denisov,\r\nPresident of the Security Council for the month of\r\nNovember, for his comprehensive introduction of this\r\nyear’s Security Council report to the General\r\nAssembly. We also wish to thank the members of the\r\nSecretariat for their efforts in preparing the report.\r\nA comprehensive reform of the Security Council,\r\nthe organ of the United Nations principally responsible\r\nfor maintaining international peace and security, is\r\nvital to our Organization’s success at a time when\r\nglobal challenges and problems require strong and\r\nthorough international management and functioning\r\nmultilateral diplomacy.\r\nAt this year’s world summit, many heads of State\r\nand Government addressed the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil. Their views were mostly focused on the\r\nexpansion of the Council’s membership. As we have\r\nrepeatedly expressed on previous occasions, Slovakia\r\nis firmly committed to reform of the Security Council.\r\nFirst of all, it needs to be made more representative,\r\nmore effective and more transparent.\r\nIn that context, we believe that the Security\r\nCouncil needs to be enlarged in both the permanent and\r\nnon-permanent categories of membership. The present\r\nmembership structure is clearly unbalanced and does\r\nnot truly reflect the current situation in the world in a\r\nnumber of aspects. It would seem only appropriate that\r\nenlargement in the permanent category also include\r\ncountries of the global South. Only such an expansion\r\ncan rectify the existing imbalance in the composition\r\nof the Council. We duly note that several developing\r\nand industrialized countries that possess political and\r\neconomic potential have a claim on permanent\r\nmembership.\r\nWe wish to reiterate our position that an enlarged\r\nSecurity Council should include Germany and Japan as\r\nnew permanent members. We also wish to emphasize\r\nthat all existing regional groups should be maintained\r\nand able to nominate candidates for membership of the\r\nenlarged Security Council.\r\nIn addition to its composition, the working\r\nmethods of the Security Council need to be enhanced.\r\nSome progress has already been made towards making\r\nthe work of the Security Council more transparent. A\r\nnumber of decisions have been taken by the Council\r\nitself with regard to reforming its own procedures in an\r\neffort to increase and promote the transparency of its\r\ndeliberative process and its accountability to the wider\r\nmembership. Other proposals and initiatives have been\r\nintroduced to increase efficiency.\r\nThe reform of the United Nations is not an easy\r\nprocess, but unless we reform its most powerful organ,\r\nit will remain unfinished business. Despite the major\r\nobstacles to be overcome, we should not relent in our\r\nefforts to achieve a meaningful reform of the Security\r\nCouncil so that it can continue to play an effective role\r\nas the main body safeguarding the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to assure you, Sir, and\r\nStates Members of the United Nations that, during its\r\nupcoming tenure as a non-permanent member of the\r\nSecurity Council in 2006 and 2007, Slovakia will spare\r\nno effort in contributing with its own share of\r\nresponsibility to making the Security Council as\r\neffective and efficient as possible.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.10 p.m.\r\n"
