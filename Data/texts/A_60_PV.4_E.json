(President of the Gabonese Republic)\r\nCo-Chairperson: Mr. Göran Perrson . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Sweden)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.15 p.m.\r\nAddresses on the occasion of the High-level Plenary\r\nMeeting (continued)\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): May I remind members that, in accordance\r\nwith resolution 59/291 of 15 April 2005, the list of\r\nspeakers was established bearing in mind the fact that\r\nstatements would be limited to five minutes. I would\r\ntherefore ask speakers to make their statements at a\r\nnormal pace so that they can be correctly interpreted.\r\nTo help speakers to manage their speaking time, a\r\ntiming mechanism has been set up at the rostrum from\r\nwhich they will speak. I urge all speakers to respect the\r\ntime limits for their statements so that all who are\r\ninscribed on the list for a given meeting can make their\r\nstatement at that meeting.\r\nIn order to avoid interrupting speakers, I would\r\nkindly ask representatives to remain in their seats after\r\nstatements are made. I remind members that, having\r\nmade their statements, speakers are to leave the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall via room GA-200, which is\r\nbehind the rostrum, before returning to their seats.\r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by His\r\nExcellency Mr. Paul Kagame, President of the\r\nRepublic of Rwanda.\r\nPresident Kagame: We meet this week to mark\r\nthe passage of 60 eventful years in the life of the\r\nUnited Nations and to reaffirm our belief in its\r\nprinciples. We also meet to renew and breathe fresh life\r\ninto the Organization, to consider the reforms\r\nnecessary, and to review the progress made in the\r\nimplementation of the outcomes of the Millennium\r\nSummit, held here five years ago.\r\nLooking back over these years, it is clear that\r\nthere have been some remarkable successes in\r\nfulfilling the United Nations Charter principles, but\r\nthat there have also been a number of serious failures.\r\nRwanda has experienced both. This is also a great\r\nopportunity for us to reflect on our relations and\r\nresponsibilities as sovereign nations.\r\nIt is clearer today than ever before that, in this\r\nage of globalization, interdependence is self-evident.\r\nBy recognizing that interdependence, we accept our\r\ncollective interests and responsibilities, whether we are\r\ndeveloped or developing nations. Those include the\r\nimperative for development and the attainment of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals, peace and security,\r\nhuman rights and the rule of law.\r\nThere is no greater challenge facing humanity\r\ntoday than poverty and underdevelopment. For sub-\r\nSaharan Africa, it is unacceptable that, despite our\r\ncommitment at the Millennium Summit five years ago,\r\nthe prediction is that conditions will worsen by 2015.\r\nSo, what has gone wrong in the last five years?\r\nWas the pledge to achieve the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals by 2015 overambitious, or were\r\nthe commitments to the Millennium Development\r\n2\r\nA/60/PV.4\r\nGoals overestimated? Did we fail to assess the resource\r\ngaps and policy reforms that needed to be addressed, or\r\nare we to be contented with admirable commitments\r\nand international declarations at the expense of\r\ntangible actions and results to achieve the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals? Most importantly, should we go\r\nback to the drawing board, five years down the road,\r\nbecause we have suddenly realized that the initial road\r\nmap was misconceived? I believe that the answer is no.\r\nWhatever the case, it is clear that we must do\r\nthings radically differently and in an accelerated\r\nmanner. We must devise and agree to faithfully\r\nimplement innovative and practicable measures to\r\nensure that we reverse current trends. That will require\r\ncommitment to implement the Monterrey Consensus on\r\nfinancing for development, including the frontloading\r\nof future commitments. Noteworthy are such initiatives\r\nas the International Financing Facility.\r\nBut for such initiatives and commitments to\r\nsucceed, there should be clear and practical modalities\r\nof implementation. We welcome the proposal to ease\r\nsupply-side constraints and commodity price shocks in\r\norder to take the fullest possible advantage of increased\r\nmarket access.\r\nIt has become abundantly clear to us that the\r\nattainment of the Millennium Development Goals will\r\nbe contingent on good political and economic\r\ngovernance. In Rwanda, we are trying to do our bit. We\r\nhave implemented several political and economic\r\nreforms over the last decade, and so far the indication\r\nis that we are on the right track. All in all, the progress\r\nwe have made gives us reason to be optimistic that,\r\nwith the enhanced support of our development\r\npartners, we can attain the Millennium Development\r\nGoals by 2015.\r\nAs we all know, there is a strong relationship\r\nbetween security and development. That nexus\r\nbetween peace, security and development is crystal-\r\nclear to us in Rwanda and the wider Great Lakes region\r\nof East and Central Africa. Our own experience in\r\nRwanda has shown us that insecurity caused by\r\nreckless and irresponsible governance can cause\r\nimmense suffering, adverse to human development.\r\nLet me also stress the importance of our\r\ncollective responsibility to deal with terrorism and to\r\nprotect populations under threat of genocide, war\r\ncrimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.\r\nNever again should the international communitys\r\nresponse to those crimes be found wanting. Let us\r\nresolve to take collective action in a timely and\r\ndecisive manner. Let us also commit ourselves to\r\nputting in place early warning mechanisms and to\r\nensuring that preventive interventions are the rule\r\nrather than the exception.\r\nIf the United Nations is to effectively fulfil its\r\nmission, then the following measures must be taken.\r\nFirst, we must improve coherence, efficiency and\r\neffectiveness within the United Nations system so as to\r\npromote transparency and accountability. Secondly, we\r\nbelieve that the reform process should enable States\r\nthat are not members of the Security Council to\r\nparticipate more actively in its deliberative and\r\ndecision-making processes, especially on issues that\r\naffect them. A reformed Council should be seen by all\r\nStates to be more representative, transparent, credible\r\nand legitimate.\r\nIn conclusion, if we believe in our common\r\nhumanity and our global partnership, then the\r\nattainment of the Millennium Development Goals\r\nmakes sense, both for business as well as to promote\r\nglobal stability. As we debate, posterity will not judge\r\nus kindly if we fail to seize the moment and to reverse\r\nthe suffering of millions of the worlds poor at the\r\nheight of such unprecedented affluence and\r\ntechnological and scientific advances.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): The Assembly will now hear an address by\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Marc Ravalomanana, President of\r\nthe Republic of Madagascar.\r\nPresident Ravalomanana (spoke in French):\r\nBefore speaking of the progress that we have achieved\r\nin the context of the eight Millennium Development\r\nGoals, I wish to draw members attention to three\r\nimportant points.\r\nFirst, five years ago, eight development\r\nobjectives were defined, representing major progress.\r\nToday, we must go further because fighting poverty\r\nnow requires a sound road map, a clear vision and a\r\nglobal development strategy that, today more than ever,\r\nmust set minimum standards.\r\nSecondly, the Millennium Development Goals are\r\nnot isolated objectives. They are interdependent, and\r\ncoordinated action to achieve them all is therefore\r\ncrucial.\r\n3\r\nA/60/PV.4\r\nThirdly, efforts to benefit the poorest countries\r\nmust be redoubled or even tripled. They should be\r\ndictated by a new vision for Africa and a coordinated\r\nplan of action. We need a Marshall Plan for Africa. I\r\nproposed such a plan last year. With such a new and\r\ndecisive approach, the Millennium Goals can be\r\nachieved.\r\nPoverty in Madagascar was reduced from 80 per\r\ncent in 2002 to 74 per cent in 2004. That represents a\r\nmajor step, but not nearly enough. Many people,\r\nespecially in the southern regions of our country, still\r\ngo hungry. Thanks to new schools, new teachers and\r\nfree basic education, school attendance has risen from\r\n67 per cent to 82 per cent in three years. Infant\r\nmortality has dropped from 159 to 94 per thousand\r\nchildren below the age of five. That represents great\r\nprogress.\r\nAs to gender equality and the advancement of\r\nwomen, my Government has launched a national policy\r\nfor the advancement of women and drafted a national\r\nplan of action for gender and development. Maternal\r\nhealth care has improved, with a 20 per cent increase in\r\nmedically assisted births.\r\nIn the campaign against HIV/AIDS, a national\r\ncommittee to combat AIDS is striving, under my direct\r\nauthority, to stabilize the infection rate, which\r\ncurrently stands at approximately 1.5 per cent. In the\r\nfight against malaria, my Government has distributed\r\nfree treated mosquito nets to pregnant women and\r\nchildren below the age of five. Campaigns to heighten\r\nAIDS and malaria awareness continue throughout the\r\ncountry.\r\nThrough our project entitled Madagascar,\r\nNaturally, we seek to protect and preserve nature. The\r\nextent of protected areas will triple within five years.\r\nMany measures have been adopted to prevent brush\r\nfires.\r\nFinally, our efforts in the field of good\r\ngovernance and the opening of our economy have been\r\nacknowledged by donors, who have cancelled our\r\nmultilateral debts. The fight against corruption is in\r\nfull swing.\r\nI should like to speak of these matters in greater\r\ndetail, but I believe that I have conveyed a sense of the\r\nmajor efforts we have made. We are resolved to\r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals, but I\r\nrepeat that it is only with a new approach on the part of\r\nthe international community to benefit Africa that we\r\nwill be able to achieve them.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): The Assembly will now hear an address by\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, President\r\nof the Islamic Republic of Iran.\r\nPresident Ahmadinejad (spoke in Farsi; English\r\ntext provided by the delegation): At the outset, I wish\r\nto express my appreciation to the Secretary-General\r\nand my pleasure at participating in this gathering of\r\ncolleagues, heads of State and Government, and\r\nrepresentatives. May I also register my deepest grief\r\nover the tragic incidents in Kadhimiya, Iraq, and\r\nHurricane Katrina, and also convey my condolences\r\nand sympathies to the victims and their loved ones.\r\nThe United Nations must be the focal point of\r\nreliance, hope and participation for all peoples and\r\nGovernments, and a forum for dialogue, understanding\r\nand cooperation to achieve peace and tranquillity\r\nthroughout the globe. The attainment of that objective\r\nrequires, first, that justice reign supreme in the\r\nOrganization, and that, in accordance with its Charter,\r\nall Member States enjoy equal rights. Greater power or\r\nwealth should not accord expanded rights to any\r\nMember.\r\nSecondly, the principles of democracy and ethics\r\nshould prevail in all organs and functions of the United\r\nNations, so that the Organization can become a\r\nmanifestation of the prevalence of those two commonly\r\nshared values.\r\nThirdly, the United Nations should endeavour to\r\nfulfil its responsibility to promote and institutionalize\r\njustice at the international level.\r\nFourthly, the host country should not enjoy any\r\nright or privilege over the rest of the membership, and\r\nthe Organization and its Headquarters must be easily\r\naccessible to all.\r\nIn recognition of those principles, the following\r\npoints become essential.\r\nFirst, the greatest challenge of our age is the\r\ngradual spiritual debasement of human beings brought\r\nabout by the distancing of the prevailing order from the\r\nmorality and unity of monotheism. The United Nations\r\nshould lead in the promotion of spirituality and\r\ncompassion for humanity. Only thus can the nations\r\nbecome truly unified.\r\n4\r\nA/60/PV.4\r\nSecondly, the acceptance of unilateralism\r\nrepresents the absolute negation of the United Nations\r\nand its raison dêtre. Therefore, the United Nations as a\r\nwhole should confront that vicious malady.\r\nThirdly, the physical and psychological security\r\nof peoples and nations is today more endangered than\r\never. Unilateralism, the production and use of weapons\r\nof mass destruction, intimidation, the resort to the\r\nthreat or use of force, and the imposition of destructive\r\nwars on peoples for the sake of the security and\r\nprosperity of a few Powers have redoubled the historic\r\nresponsibility of the United Nations to strive resolutely\r\nto institutionalize justice in all aspects of global\r\ninteraction in the interest of human tranquillity. In our\r\nview, it is impossible to achieve security, peace,\r\nstability, prosperity and progress in certain parts of the\r\nworld at the cost of fomenting instability, militarism,\r\ndiscrimination, poverty and deprivation in others.\r\nFourthly the raison dêtre of the United Nations is\r\nto promote global peace and tranquillity. Therefore,\r\nany license for pre-emptive measures  which are\r\nessentially based on gauging intentions rather than\r\nobjective facts, and are in fact a modern manifestation\r\nof the interventionist and war-mongering tendencies of\r\nthe past  is in blatant contradiction to the very\r\nfoundations of the United Nations and to the letter and\r\nspirit of its Charter.\r\nFifthly, the composition of the Security Council\r\nmust achieve a logical and democratic balance. If\r\npermanent membership is accepted for some, then an\r\nacceptable combination of representatives of all\r\ncontinents and major civilizations must acquire\r\npermanent seats on the Council. I wish to underline our\r\ndeep dismay over the fact that not one of the more than\r\n50 Islamic countries, encompassing more than 1.2\r\nbillion people, has a permanent seat in the Security\r\nCouncil; nor does Africa, with its huge capabilities and\r\npotentials, while the vast continent of Asia with its\r\nancient civilizations has only one permanent seat.\r\nSixthly, the United Nations must be able freely to\r\nwelcome representatives from all Governments, civil\r\nsociety and non-governmental organizations from\r\nthroughout the world to its Headquarters without the\r\nselective hindrances of the host country, and to engage\r\nwithout fear in serious dialogue.\r\nIn our view, those concerns can be met only if the\r\nprevailing discourse in international relations is\r\ntransformed from one based on violence,\r\ndiscrimination and domination into one of peace and\r\nglobal stability founded on justice and spirituality\r\nthrough dialogue, compassion and respect for human\r\nbeings. The exalted Prophet of Islam says that the\r\nhighest state of wisdom, after faith in God, is seeking\r\nfriendship with people and extending a helping hand to\r\nall fellow human beings. Those words of wisdom\r\nunderline the fact that the entire globe is but one entity\r\nand that the pain and suffering of any part disturbs the\r\ntranquillity of all. In the words of a famous Iranian\r\npoet of the thirteenth century:\r\nAll human beings are members of one frame\r\nSince all, at first, from the same essence came.\r\nWhen time afflicts a limb with pain\r\nThe other limbs cannot at rest remain.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): The Assembly will now hear an address by\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Alejandro Toledo Manrique,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Peru.\r\nPresident Toledo Manrique (spoke in Spanish):\r\nI speak on behalf of a democratic country that is deeply\r\nconvinced that the development of our countries,\r\nrespect for human rights and free expression, and\r\nsecurity are mutually reinforcing. Within the four years\r\nof my Government, Peru, with its difficulties and\r\nhopes, has moved forward, building sustained\r\neconomic growth and a fairer society, and ensuring the\r\ncomprehensive security of its inhabitants.\r\nWe have made the Millennium Development\r\nGoals a national commitment. They are reflected in\r\nState policies that go beyond my own Government.\r\nThose policies are reflected in the National Agreement\r\nthat the political parties, civil society and the\r\nGovernment have pledged to fulfil in 20 years. In other\r\nwords, our commitment to the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals will not end with my Government.\r\nSome advances in the fulfilment of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals are evident today.\r\nSince 2001, the economic and social policies of my\r\nGovernment have created the conditions for sustained\r\nand decentralized growth, with positive results\r\nreflected in increased rates of consumption and\r\nincome. I have managed the country for 48 months of\r\nsustained economic growth at a rate of 5 to 5.5 per\r\ncent.\r\nThe Government of Peru is implementing specific\r\npolicies in such areas such as employment, income,\r\n5\r\nA/60/PV.4\r\nhealth, education, nutrition and gender issues with a\r\nview to helping the poorest. The central efforts of my\r\nGovernment are aimed at decisively addressing\r\npoverty. It has established purposive social policies,\r\nwithout consideration of their potential economic\r\nbenefits, such as the Huascaran plan aimed at internet\r\nconnectivity for the poorest; policies to improve short-\r\nterm employment for the poorest, such as the A\r\nTrabajar Urbano programme; subsidized housing\r\nprogrammes for the poorest; and policies for rural\r\nelectrification and basic health care to provide Perus\r\npoorest with water and sewer systems. Moreover,\r\nalthough we do not believe in handouts, a programme\r\nof direct and conditioned subsidy for the poorest was\r\nlaunched a few days ago. As a reciprocal condition,\r\nthat direct subsidy to the poorest requires pregnant\r\nmothers to have prenatal and postnatal check-ups and\r\nto get their children vaccinated and send them to\r\nschool.\r\nAs a result of those efforts, between 2001 and\r\n2004 approximately 1 million Peruvian men and\r\nwomen have been lifted out of extreme poverty. In that\r\nregard, in the latest United Nations Human\r\nDevelopment Report, Peru has risen six places in the\r\nranking of 177 countries.\r\nThe time has come to speak clearly. The\r\nsustainable development of our peoples requires an\r\nopen international trade system based on standard\r\nrules. President Bushs statement to the General\r\nAssembly this morning was encouraging. He said that\r\nthe developed countries must eliminate their subsidies.\r\nHe said that, in order to be sustainable, globalization\r\nmust meet the needs of the developing countries.\r\nPresident Bushs statement this morning was\r\nencouraging because it reflected a meeting of the\r\nminds between the developing and the developed\r\ncountries.\r\nPeru is committed to fulfilling the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals not as part of the policy of one\r\nparticular Government, but as a State policy. I know\r\nthat all the leaders here in this Hall share that mission.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): The Assembly will now hear an address by\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Tommy Remengesau, Jr., President\r\nof the Republic of Palau.\r\nPresident Remengesau: May I first congratulate\r\nthe United Nations on its diamond anniversary, and\r\nmay I express my countrys full support for this\r\ninternational body in its efforts to build nations, to curb\r\nhunger, to ensure water, to aspire to economic and\r\ncultural equality, and to bring nations together to solve\r\nglobal issues. Truly, the work plan is a difficult one,\r\nyet it is one from which the Organization must not\r\ndeviate.\r\nI would also like to convey to all present my\r\npride regarding the tenth anniversary of my countrys\r\nindependence. As such, this year also marks the tenth\r\nanniversary of our membership in the United Nations.\r\nThe Republic of Palau, although small and new in\r\nterms of political independence, has survived and, I\r\nmight add, prospered in its first 10 years of self-rule.\r\nYet much of our future depends on the global efforts\r\nmade by the United Nations to bring peace, stability\r\nand economic sustainability to all of its Member\r\nnations.\r\nThe Secretary-General, in his report In larger\r\nfreedom, states that,\r\n[O]ne of the great challenges of the new\r\nmillennium is to ensure that all States are strong\r\nenough to meet the many challenges they face \r\n[N]o country, weak or strong, can realize\r\nprosperity in a vacuum. (A/59/2005, paras. 19\r\nand 24)\r\nFor Palau, and for many other small island\r\ndeveloping States, the challenges are mounting. We are\r\nnew countries, remote and isolated. We are small\r\ncountries, with small economies that lack fiscal\r\ndiversity. We are island nations whose sustainable\r\ndevelopment requires healthy reefs, plentiful oceans,\r\nfreedom from incursions by international terrorists, and\r\nmeaningful educational and career opportunities for\r\nour children, who are leaving our islands in pursuit of\r\nboth.\r\nWhile other regions of the world receive more\r\nattention, Professor Jeffrey Sachs, in his Millennium\r\nProject Report to the Secretary-General, noted that\r\nOceania is second only to sub-Saharan Africa in being\r\noff track for nearly every [Millennium] Goal, and\r\nfalling back in some areas. While Palau is proud of its\r\nperformance in moving towards the achievement of\r\nthose Goals, that is clearly not the case in all of our\r\nisland nations, and we must move aggressively forward\r\nin bringing equality of opportunity to all of nations in\r\nachieving the Goals through the actions of the United\r\nNations.\r\n6\r\nA/60/PV.4\r\nAs global warming worsens, bleaching our corals\r\nand threatening our land; as overfishing by foreign\r\nfishing fleets continues to deplete our vast fish stocks;\r\nas certain fishing practices threaten to destroy our\r\nmarine biodiversity; and as the combination of those\r\nforces places our diverse island cultures in jeopardy,\r\nthe challenges mount.\r\nIt is therefore time for the international\r\ncommunity, and the United Nations as its\r\nrepresentative, to begin to move beyond studies that\r\nrecognize past failures to achieve sustainable\r\ndevelopment in our island nations, and to move\r\naggressively forward and to establish a specific\r\nprogramme agenda that recognizes our unique\r\nsmallness, that appreciates our distinctive diversity,\r\nand that respects our island cultures as equal to those\r\nof other nations of this world. And, I might add, it is\r\ntime to bring the moral and religious leadership into\r\nthe process of defining a new direction, not only for\r\nour small islands, but for all of the countries of the\r\nworld. International peace and security could well be\r\nstrengthened by such a partnership.\r\nIn our effort to develop a workable outcome from\r\nour high-level event and to speed our international\r\ndevelopment efforts, we must first recognize that this\r\nprocess is one of partnership. As partners, it is\r\nimportant to acknowledge that significant\r\nachievements have indeed been made since the\r\nMillennium Summit and Monterrey Conference. To\r\ncontinue that joint forward movement, we must all\r\nrecognize realistic needs and responsibilities. While\r\ndeveloped countries must continue to work to expand\r\ntheir annual contributions and to improve\r\ndisbursements, developing countries must establish\r\nenvironments that maximize the effectiveness of those\r\ncontributions. Good governance must be treated as a\r\nmechanism not only for expanding development\r\nassistance, but for improving the lives of our people as\r\nwell. And it is not unreasonable to anticipate that\r\nstrong recipient performance will lead to greater donor\r\ncontributions.\r\nDue to recent international events, it is also time\r\nfor the United Nations to immediately expand its\r\nemergency response to the rising prices of fuel. For\r\nsmall island developing States, economic gains made\r\nover the past 10 years are being wiped away by\r\nspiralling fuel prices. For island economies to survive,\r\nwe must move rapidly and decisively towards alternate\r\nenergy resources, which can be accomplished only\r\nthrough international assistance and funding. With\r\ngreat sincerity, we take this opportunity to\r\nacknowledge the efforts of the United Nations and of\r\nthose countries and international institutions that have\r\nrecognized our situation and worked with us to\r\novercome our unique challenges.\r\nThe United States has laboured for over 50 years\r\nto help us instil principles of democracy in our\r\nleadership and in our children and has nurtured our\r\nyoung institutions. We offer our sincere thanks. With\r\nour American friends, we also mourn the tragedy of\r\nHurricane Katrinas aftermath. We have no doubt,\r\nhowever, that, given the resilience of the American\r\ncharacter, America and those impacted will rebound\r\nfrom that great tragedy.\r\nWe acknowledge the continual support of Japan\r\nto our region and to our country, and we are hopeful\r\nthat the Security Council expansion and reform process\r\nwill result in Japans permanent membership of the\r\nSecurity Council, where it can employ its knowledge\r\nof our region in the deliberations of that body. Fair and\r\nequal representation of the nations of this world in its\r\ninternational body, the United Nations, can only\r\nstrengthen our efforts to achieve a powerful and\r\nrespected voice on international and regional issues.\r\nAs Palau supports Japans wider role, due to its\r\nimportance to the region, it also supports Taiwans\r\nmembership in this body as a significant regional\r\nfriend to Palau and an important member of the world\r\ncommunity. As long as one nation and one people are\r\nexcluded from their rightful representation in our\r\nglobal community, we have failed to achieve our goal\r\nof universal rights and privileges.\r\nWe also take this opportunity to commend the\r\nGovernment of Israel and Prime Minister Sharon on\r\nthe historical disengagement from Gaza and parts of\r\nthe West Bank. We have followed that complex and\r\npainful process and look forward to further progress on\r\nachieving peace.\r\nIn spite of Palaus increasing support for the\r\nUnited Nations work around the world, and despite our\r\ndetermination to become an active member of the\r\nmultilateral community, I note that the United Nations,\r\nits organizations and offices do not have one\r\npermanent representative in our nation to assist us in\r\ndeveloping our capacity. Surely, the intimate\r\nknowledge gained of our unique culture, economy and\r\npeople is well worth the expense of providing such\r\n7\r\nA/60/PV.4\r\nrepresentation. To that end, along with several other\r\nPacific countries, we have asked the Secretary-General\r\nto help us by establishing United Nations\r\nrepresentation in Palau to assist our people in accessing\r\nthe international institutions, which will be helpful in\r\nour drive for economic and social independence. We\r\nconsider that to be a vital foundation for our\r\nsustainable development.\r\nThe people of Palau recognize that every nation\r\nin the world, regardless of its size, has an important\r\nrole to play on the international stage in assuring the\r\nglobal community of a bright and secure future for its\r\nchildren. Today, on the sixtieth anniversary of this\r\ngreat institution, the tenth anniversary of Palaus\r\nmembership in this body, and the tenth anniversary of\r\nPalaus independence, I affirm that the people of Palau,\r\ndespite all obstacles and challenges, will play their\r\npart.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): The Assembly will now hear an address by\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Abdoulaye Wade, President of the\r\nRepublic of Senegal.\r\nPresident Wade (spoke in French): I cannot\r\nforego this opportunity to commend our Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his outstanding work,\r\nand in particular for his recent proposed reform of the\r\nUnited Nations, now celebrating its sixtieth\r\nanniversary. Reforming a 60-year old institution and its\r\nmany parts is no easy task, and we must therefore bear\r\nin mind that such widespread reform will not be\r\npossible again for decades to come.\r\nMy statement will bear on the following points: a\r\nfew considerations on the Millennium Development\r\nGoals and on how we have sought to implement them\r\nin our country; financing for development and\r\ncombating poverty; and Security Council reform.\r\nAs to the Millennium Development Goals, our\r\nassessment has revealed the many obstacles still\r\nhindering their achievement. Some are to be found\r\nwithin our countries  the lack of peace, poor\r\ngovernance, the AIDS pandemic and other diseases.\r\nLet us agree, however, that the developed countries\r\nhave not always complied with their commitments,\r\nespecially regarding the 1970s pledge to provide\r\ndevelopment assistance to the developing countries at\r\nthe level of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product,\r\nas well as the financing of the New Partnership for\r\nAfricas Development (NEPAD).\r\nFortunately, the new approach set out in the Blair\r\nreport opened promising prospects arising from the\r\nGleneagles Summit of the Group of Eight. Despite\r\neverything, our countries, including my own, with their\r\nvery meagre resources but a good deal of imagination\r\nand diversified international assistance, have achieved\r\nhonourable results. In Senegal, we have achieved a\r\ngrowth rate of 6.7 per cent, with spectacular results in\r\nagriculture, where production in some areas has\r\nincreased by 600 per cent. Many jobs have been\r\ncreated for young people. Thanks to our allocation of\r\n40 per cent of the national budget to education and 10\r\nper cent to health care, the AIDS prevalence rate has\r\nfallen from 1.7 to 0.7 per cent, and school attendance is\r\nnow at 70 per cent, whereas we were below average in\r\n2000. Our development has also been sustained by\r\nconsistent investment in human resources.\r\nHistory shows that science and technology are\r\nirreplaceable vectors of progress. Thus, in considering\r\nthe digital gap, we note that telephone, facsimile, telex\r\nand Internet communications are most developed in the\r\nNorth  in what I call the connected countries \r\nwhereas the South is sorely lacking in that regard.\r\nThose technologies underpin knowledge, so that\r\nscience is developed and transmitted mostly in the\r\nNorth, to the detriment of the South. That is why, in\r\nDecember 2002 in Geneva, we proposed the creation of\r\nthe Global Digital Solidarity Fund. Although there was\r\nsome initial misunderstanding, the Fund was adopted\r\nby 193 countries. I would request that it be additionally\r\nsupported, and note that it is functioning on voluntary\r\nand not mandatory contributions. It is headquartered in\r\nGeneva and managed by the United Cities and Local\r\nGovernments association, and certain States have\r\nalready made average contributions of some $300,000\r\neach. It is with pleasure that we have learned that the\r\nDominican Republic has decided to convene a meeting\r\non the Fund here in New York.\r\nI wish to draw Members attention to the new\r\nconcept of youth leadership, aimed at developing\r\ninnovation and leadership in young people. Following\r\nthe Pan-African African Youth Leadership Summit,\r\norganized in Dakar in 2004, a fifth conference was\r\nconvened in Morocco. We offer our encouragement for\r\nthe world conference to be held here in New York, and\r\nwe insist on the fact that we must develop a sense of\r\ncreativity among young people.\r\nRegarding financing for development, I support\r\nthe proposal made by President Jacques Chirac that a\r\n8\r\nA/60/PV.4\r\nsmall tax be added to the cost of air travel. Such a fee\r\nwould be minimally painful, so to speak. I also note\r\nthat, on behalf of the African Union, I have proposed\r\ncertain new means of financing NEPAD, including the\r\nuse of treasury notes from the developed countries to\r\nassist the countries of the South at no additional cost.\r\nI conclude by referring to Security Council\r\nreform. We must identify two sources of the problem.\r\nFirst is the historical injustice done to Africa, not one\r\nof whose 53 Member States has a permanent seat on\r\nthe Security Council, whereas 70 per cent of the items\r\non the Councils agenda pertain to Africa. There has\r\nbeen no one to speak on Africas behalf since the\r\nSecurity Council was established. I believe that that\r\nhistorical injustice must be redressed by allocating a\r\npermanent seat, along with the right of veto, to Africa.\r\nAs others have said, a more in-depth discussion of the\r\nother reforms could be deferred to October or later, but\r\nI repeat that a distinction must be drawn between the\r\ntwo issues and that Africa must be provided a seat with\r\nthe right of veto.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): The Assembly will now hear an address by\r\nHis Excellency Mr. John Agyekum Kufuor, President\r\nof the Republic of Ghana.\r\nPresident Kufuor: I wish to join previous\r\nspeakers in congratulating the United Nations on its\r\nsixtieth anniversary. I salute Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan and his team, under whose auspices we are\r\nmarking this happy occasion.\r\nThe United Nations achievements over the past\r\n60 years are phenomenal and span several areas of\r\nhuman endeavour. For example, the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, which were unanimously\r\nendorsed here to launch the current century, raised\r\nexpectations further for the betterment of mankind.\r\nHowever, after five years, and in spite of the emphasis\r\nput on the special needs of Africa, very little has been\r\nachieved for our continent so far. Africa therefore\r\nwelcomes the recommendations put forward by the\r\nUnited Nations Millennium Project for realistic\r\nprogrammes towards the achievement of the Goals.\r\nIt is in that new spirit that Ghana commends and\r\nwelcomes the recent cancellation by the G-8 of the\r\ndebt of some countries of the Heavily Indebted Poor\r\nCountries initiative. It is hoped that this concession\r\nwill soon be extended to all African countries. Again,\r\naccelerated efforts at achieving the objectives of the\r\nDoha Round should, in the long run, help to minimize\r\nthe dependence of developing countries on aid and\r\nthereby abate their economic marginalization.\r\nIt must be admitted, however, that the full\r\nintegration of the economies of the developing world\r\ninto the global economy would demand in the\r\ntransition that its enterprises and companies be assisted\r\nin becoming more competitive and efficient. It is in\r\nrecognition of that important fact that Ghana welcomes\r\nwarmly and commends to the international community\r\nthe excellent initiative of the United States\r\nGovernment in establishing the Millennium Challenge\r\nAccount. Other proposals, such as the creation of an\r\ninternational finance facility and substantial additional\r\nresources to assist the developing world, especially\r\nAfrica, during the transitional process must also be\r\nsupported.\r\nTerrorism has emerged as one of the most serious\r\nthreats to peace and security in todays world. It is a\r\nloose cannon that cannot be justified as a solution to\r\nany perceived wrong. The fight against it calls for a\r\nsustained, firm and strong collective response from the\r\ninternational community. Consequently, we urge that\r\nthis occasion be used to reaffirm our commitment to\r\nmultilateralism, which underpins the spirit and letter of\r\nthe United Nations Charter.\r\nSimilarly, the international community must\r\ncollectively banish the scourge of war by addressing\r\nthe issues of disarmament, nuclear non-proliferation\r\nand the menace of illicit small arms and light weapons.\r\nIn some societies, especially in Africa, the latter\r\nconstitute the weapons of mass destruction. It needs to\r\nbe stressed that, over the past decade alone, the use of\r\nsuch weapons has claimed more than 20 million\r\nvictims in Africa, many of whom have been women\r\nand children.\r\nThrough its peacekeeping operations around the\r\nworld, the United Nations has brought relief and hope\r\nto victims in conflict areas. We therefore welcome the\r\nproposed establishment of a peacebuilding commission\r\nto help conflict-afflicted countries in the transition\r\nfrom war to peace and national reconstruction. We also\r\nfully support the decision to establish a democracy\r\nfund to promote democratic practice and good\r\ngovernance as the surest guarantor of human rights.\r\nLikewise, we support the proposal to convert the\r\nHuman Rights Commission into a human rights\r\ncouncil.\r\n9\r\nA/60/PV.4\r\nAs we look to the United Nations to lead the way\r\nin meeting our collective aspirations in the rapidly\r\nchanging world, the Organization must enhance its\r\ncontinued functionality through flexibility. It must\r\ntherefore undergo substantial reforms in order to be\r\nable to discharge its mandate effectively in the light of\r\nthe complexities of the times. That is why Ghana\r\nsupports the Secretary-Generals document entitled In\r\nlarger freedom: towards development, security and\r\nhuman rights for all, which advocates the\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations institutions.\r\nHence, the General Assembly needs to be revitalized in\r\norder to enable it to assume fully its rightful place as\r\nthe most representative and deliberative organ of the\r\nUnited Nations. Also, the need for a more vibrant\r\nEconomic and Social Council, an efficient Secretariat\r\nand adequate funding cannot be overemphasized for a\r\nstronger United Nations.\r\nAbove all, the Security Council must be\r\nrestructured and expanded to reflect the increased\r\nmembership of the United Nations and also to enable it\r\ncarry out its Charter obligations more purposively with\r\nthe full confidence of Member States. That reform\r\nmust be based on the principles of democracy,\r\naccountability, the sovereign equality of States and\r\nequitable geographical representation, among others.\r\nThe African Unions claim of two permanent seats on\r\nthe Council must therefore be supported.\r\nIn conclusion, history stands ready to judge us on\r\nthe outcome of this Meeting. We cannot and should not\r\nfail succeeding generations. We therefore welcome the\r\noutcome document submitted for our consideration and\r\nwill support a mechanism for its implementation.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): The Assembly will now hear an address by\r\nHis Excellency The Honourable Mr. Mwai Kibaki,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Kenya.\r\nPresident Kibaki: It is my pleasure to address\r\nthis gathering of leaders of the United Nations. This\r\nsummit gives us an opportunity to review progress and\r\nreaffirm our commitment to the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nIt will be recalled that, in September 2000, world\r\nleaders committed themselves to reducing poverty and\r\nimproving peoples lives. Five years later, the world is\r\nstill faced with the challenges of poverty, hunger,\r\ndisease and illiteracy. The achievement of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals has been uneven\r\nacross regions and there are wide disparities in the\r\nrealization of specific Goals.\r\nOn the other hand, many countries have made\r\nsignificant progress in creating an enabling\r\nenvironment for attaining the Millennium Development\r\nGoals. For instance, most countries in Africa today\r\nhave positive and growing economic growth rates.\r\nGood governance is increasingly taking root. African\r\nleaders are working together to improve the lives of\r\ntheir citizens. Regrettably, those efforts are being\r\nhampered by limited access to the markets of\r\ndeveloped countries, low disbursements of\r\ndevelopment assistance and the debt burden.\r\nIn Kenya, we have made significant progress in a\r\nnumber of areas. In 2004, the economy grew by 4.3 per\r\ncent, up from 2.8 per cent the previous year. Primary\r\nschool enrolment in Kenya has also increased\r\ntremendously due to the implementation of free\r\nprimary education programmes in the last two years.\r\nGross enrolment in primary schools now averages 99\r\nper cent. In total, the Government allocates over 28 per\r\ncent of its resources to education.\r\nHowever, the challenges that have emerged as a\r\nresult of the programme are enormous. Those include\r\noverstretched physical facilities, a high pupil-to-\r\nteacher ratio, overcrowding in schools, and the high\r\ncost of equipment for children with special needs.\r\nAlthough the threat of HIV/AIDS remains real,\r\nwe have made tremendous progress in controlling the\r\nspread of HIV. For instance, in Kenya we succeeded in\r\nreducing the prevalence of the HIV/AIDS infection\r\nfrom a high of 18 per cent in 2000 to less than 7 per\r\ncent in 2004. That success is largely attributed to the\r\npolicy and institutional arrangements that Kenya has\r\nput in place, together with strong support from our\r\ndevelopment partners.\r\nIn spite of the commendable drop in the infection\r\nrate, Kenyas health sector continues to face serious\r\nchallenges from malaria and other communicable\r\ndiseases. That calls for increased spending in the sector\r\nto address those challenges. Accordingly, Kenya has\r\nincreased spending in the health sector from 8.6 per\r\ncent of Government expenditure in the financial year\r\n2004-2005 to 9.9 per cent in 2005-2006.\r\nMy Government recognizes the critical role of\r\nenvironmental issues in the achievement of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. In that respect, we\r\n10\r\nA/60/PV.4\r\nhave taken steps to ensure the sustainable management\r\nof the environment. Some of the specific measures we\r\nhave taken include proper management of forest\r\nresources, the sustainable use and management of\r\nnatural resources and, above all, ensuring that there is\r\nan adequate legal and institutional framework.\r\nFurthermore, my Government is according priority to\r\nthe rehabilitation and expansion of infrastructure, such\r\nas roads, energy, housing, water and\r\ntelecommunications. That is in recognition of the high\r\npotential of those sectors to accelerate the achievement\r\nof the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nAs I have already observed, the achievement of\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals continues to be\r\ndetermined by challenges posed by the debt burden and\r\nlow disbursements of donor aid. Kenya continues to\r\nstruggle with its huge debt burden, with about 30 per\r\ncent of all our revenues from the export of goods and\r\nservices going to service the external debt. We believe\r\nthat the country can be set on a sustained growth path\r\nthrough increased development assistance, as well as\r\ndebt relief, to supplement our efforts. Indeed, we have\r\njust concluded a comprehensive assessment of the full\r\nrange of interventions and resources required to meet\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals by 2015. The\r\nresults indicate that the financial requirements are way\r\nbeyond what we can afford as a country.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to reiterate that the\r\nattainment of the Millennium Development Goals is\r\nthe collective responsibility of the world community. I\r\ntherefore call upon the international community to\r\nrender its full support and ensure that the commitments\r\nmade in 2000 are met.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): The Assembly will now hear an address by\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ivan Gaparović, President of the\r\nSlovak Republic.\r\nPresident Gaparović (spoke in Slovakian;\r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): Sixty years is\r\nan important anniversary for a person or an\r\norganization. It is usually a time for celebration. For\r\nthe United Nations, it is more a time for contemplation\r\nand introspection.\r\nA look at todays world often shows us a very\r\ncontradictory picture. On the one hand, we are flying\r\ninto outer space, and on the other entire nations are\r\ndying of hunger. We have mapped the human genome,\r\nwhile there are places on Earth where people are dying\r\nbecause of shortages of basic medicines and health\r\ncare. Human rights have been declared for 60 years and\r\nare a part of a universally endorsed document adopted\r\nright here at the United Nations, and yet there are still\r\nStates that deny their citizens most basic rights while\r\nclaiming that human rights standards vary from\r\ncountry to country. We have copious knowledge, which\r\nenables us to split the atom, but we do not have enough\r\nrationality to prevent the misuse of nuclear fission for\r\nthe manufacture of nuclear weapons. We are capable of\r\nbuilding skyscrapers hundreds of meters high, while\r\nelsewhere we are tearing down the tin shacks of the\r\npoorest among us.\r\nAs if we did not have enough problems, there are\r\npeople who are willing to sacrifice not only their own\r\nlives, but also the lives of others  usually innocent\r\ncivilians  in pursuit of their goals. But terrorist\r\nattacks have not changed one essential thing  they\r\nhave not changed our values. There has been one\r\nchange, however. We have changed our perception of\r\ninternational security.\r\nIt is apparent that the satisfaction of the most\r\nelementary human needs cannot be taken for granted in\r\na large part of the planet. On the contrary, even at the\r\nbeginning of the twenty-first century, it is necessary to\r\nfight for them. Millions of people are living in\r\nhardship. Additional millions do not have guarantees\r\nof basic human rights and essentially all live in fear as\r\na result of global terrorism. In brief, the right to a\r\ndignified life remains only a right and not an everyday\r\nreality.\r\nThe world is at a crossroads and the most\r\nimportant global Organization also stands at that\r\ncrossroads. Much hangs in the balance, and\r\nmaintaining the status quo will solve nothing. To say it\r\nmore openly, maintaining the status quo could lead to\r\nthe United Nations losing its relevance altogether. In\r\nall probability, if the United Nations cannot be\r\nreformed, its Member States will look for other ways to\r\npromote their interests. The United Nations cannot\r\nremain just some sort of a debate club that fails to\r\nprovide working solutions. The United Nations and its\r\ninstitutions can regain their prestige and accountability\r\nonly when they prove themselves able to adopt\r\noperational decisions for the solving of todays\r\nimminent problems.\r\nLet me cite just one specific example. Given the\r\nfact that the list of terrorist attacks is growing day by\r\n11\r\nA/60/PV.4\r\nday, it is difficult to explain to our citizens why the\r\nglobal strategy in the fight against terrorism has been\r\nsitting on our desks for six months. That is true, too,\r\nfor the comprehensive convention on terrorism. Further\r\nhesitation and endless negotiations on that issue only\r\nenable terrorists to pretend that their inhuman fight is\r\nlegitimate. I will not be saying anything new when I\r\nassert that a resolute, operational and coordinated\r\napproach by the international community is necessary\r\nin this situation and that the United Nations central role\r\nin it is irreplaceable.\r\nOn this occasion, I cannot fail to mention that we\r\nfollowed with concern the course of discussions on\r\nUnited Nations reform, which briefly threatened to\r\ndevelop into a deep crisis. We also noted with concern\r\nthe problems in drafting the outcome document. If\r\nmultilateralism is to be truly effective, it cannot be\r\nbased on a search for the least common denominator.\r\nOn the contrary, it must be driven by the worlds\r\ncurrent needs. We must avoid one long-standing myth\r\nand stop equating multilateralism with absolute\r\nconsensus. Narrow, individual interests cannot hinder\r\nthe efforts of a large majority of countries. Processes\r\nthat move the Organization forward cannot be slowed\r\nby the pretext of consensus. If the opposite were true,\r\nthere would be no search for consensus, but an\r\nadjustment to the particular interests of a small\r\nminority of countries.\r\nSlovakia does not consider inaction to be an\r\nanswer. For that reason, together with the European\r\nUnion, we firmly support efforts for reform that would\r\nadapt the United Nations to new conditions. For\r\nSlovakia, the idea of effective multilateralism is not\r\njust a trendy buzzword in international relations, but a\r\ntrue guarantee of security, equality and justice.\r\nAlthough it does not fully reflect our ideas and\r\nambitions on the depth and forcefulness of measures\r\nneeded to reform the United Nations system, the draft\r\noutcome document is, in our opinion, a basic starting\r\npoint for a more effective multilateralism whose\r\ncentral role is to be played by the United Nations. At\r\nthe same time, it is necessary to remain sober-minded\r\nin its assessment. The draft outcome document is not a\r\nsolution to todays situation, but only a guide to its\r\nresolution. The draft outcome document is first and\r\nforemost a framework for further steps. For the latter,\r\nwe will need much political will and many\r\ncompromises. The sixtieth session of the General\r\nAssembly will be as important to the success of a\r\nreform package as todays summit. On the other hand,\r\na number of ambitious proposals had to give way to\r\ncompromise, but that does not mean that they should\r\nbe stricken or forgotten.\r\nFurther steps will undoubtedly be necessary to\r\nmake the United Nations Secretariat more effective and\r\nbetter managed, achieve more effective operation and\r\navoid duplication or a lack of coordination in the work\r\nof individual institutions and organizations of the\r\nUnited Nations system.\r\nThe completion and strengthening of the human\r\nrights dimension and a renewal of the dynamics of\r\nnegotiations and measures in the area of disarmament\r\nand non-proliferation continue to be challenges. We are\r\nconvinced that in the upcoming period the international\r\ncommunity will find enough political will and\r\ndetermination to solve these issues, in the interest of\r\nstrengthening the role and authority of the United\r\nNations in the system of global relations.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to call your attention\r\nto the success story of the transformation of Slovakia\r\nfrom a former recipient of assistance into a donor\r\ncountry. This demonstrates that it is indeed possible to\r\novercome serious economic problems and to stabilize\r\nsocial growth and development. It does, however,\r\nrequire more than just international aid or debt relief.\r\nThe creation of a safe and stable legal, political and\r\ncorporate environment must be the absolute priority.\r\nWe are pleased to see that the report by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, In larger freedom, and the resulting summit\r\ndecisions, as articulated in the outcome document,\r\nemphasize exactly what Slovakia has learned from its\r\nown experience, namely, that development is not\r\npossible without guarantees for the security of the\r\ncountry, without respect for human rights and the rule\r\nof law and without good governance and the effective\r\nmanagement of ones own affairs.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to assure you\r\nthat Slovakia stands ready to share its experience and\r\nbest practices in the implementation of its domestic\r\nreforms and also, in this way, to contribute to the\r\nfulfilment of the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): The Assembly will now hear an address by\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Rakhmonov, President of the\r\nRepublic of Tajikistan.\r\n12\r\nA/60/PV.4\r\nPresident Rakhmonov (spoke in Russian): Five\r\nyears ago, in this Hall, the heads of State and\r\nGovernment of the Member States of the United\r\nNations reaffirmed their commitment to the values of\r\npeace, freedom and equality, and undertook to\r\neliminate poverty and ensure development throughout\r\nthe world. This determination has been enshrined in the\r\nMillennium Declaration. Since that time, a great deal\r\nhas been done to achieve the Development Goals, but it\r\nis clear that this is not enough. More than a billion\r\ninhabitants of our world live in extreme poverty, tens\r\nof thousands of children are dying every day from\r\nhunger and disease and we see an increase in\r\nenvironmental and other problems.\r\nAmong the most serious global challenges and\r\nthreats are terrorism, drug trafficking and the modern-\r\nday slave trade. We need to develop joint efforts to\r\nextirpate those shameful phenomena. It is especially\r\nimportant that we work together to find an answer to\r\nthe question why there has been an upsurge in terrorist\r\nviolence in the world, avoiding excessive\r\nsimplifications and generalizations in attaching any\r\ntype of ideological or religious labels. In this\r\nconnection, it is dangerous to talk about so-called\r\nIslamic terrorism. This is designed to discredit and\r\nstigmatize Islam and the Islamic world, and it has\r\nnothing to do with the dialogue of civilizations. In the\r\npolitical and legal assessment of terrorist activities,\r\nthere should not be dual standards, depending on ones\r\nstandpoint, just as there is no such thing as moderate or\r\nimmoderate terrorists. The international community\r\nshould hold to single criteria and standards in\r\ncombating all forms and manifestations of terrorism.\r\nCombating the production and spread of drugs,\r\nwhich is a breeding ground for terrorism and\r\ninternational criminal activity and a serious barrier to\r\nsustainable development, should be also a global task,\r\njust like the fight against terrorism. In this context,\r\nthere is an increasing need to establish, under the aegis\r\nof the United Nations, an effective global anti-drug\r\npartnership.\r\nThe international community is facing the need to\r\ngive powerful momentum to social and economic\r\nprogress and to the achievement of the Millennium\r\nGoals by all countries. A key here is the principle of\r\nshared responsibility of countries on the basis of the\r\nMonterrey Consensus, as was reaffirmed in the\r\nJohannesburg Plan of Action. Tajikistan offers a clear\r\nand positive reaffirmation of the link between security\r\nand development. With the assistance of the United\r\nNations, we were the first in the world to undertake a\r\ncomprehensive evaluation of the needs of our country\r\nin order to achieve the Millennium Goals. At the same\r\ntime, Tajikistan is among those countries whose social\r\nand economic development at this stage depends on\r\nassistance from abroad. We hope that the international\r\ndonor community will, as a very minimum, double the\r\nassistance it is giving today.\r\nThe burden of external indebtedness is one of the\r\nmost serious obstacles to progress. In the case of\r\nTajikistan, it would be effective to include an\r\ninnovative mechanism for solving the debt problem,\r\nsuch as, for example, the offering of credits under the\r\nDebt Cancellation for Sustainable Development\r\nformula. The donor countries, including the members\r\nof the G-8, can be assured that the resources released\r\nwill be used to combat poverty and to solve a whole\r\nseries of problems impeding the achievement of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nIn the context of development, it is difficult to\r\noverestimate the significance of regional cooperation,\r\nespecially in Central Asia. Tajikistan has consistently\r\nadvocated the intensification and the consolidation of\r\nregional integration, including through such machinery\r\nas the Central Asian Cooperation Organization, the\r\nShanghai Cooperation Organization and the Eurasian\r\nCooperation Organization.\r\nThe countries of our region are profoundly\r\ninterested in the positive development of complex\r\nprocesses which are taking place in Afghanistan and in\r\nthe economic development of Afghanistan and its\r\nCentral Asian neighbours, bearing in mind that the\r\nregional context of the post-conflict recovery of that\r\ncountry is a guarantee for the success of the efforts\r\nunderway there to restore peace and stability. We are\r\nconvinced that multifaceted regional cooperation must\r\nfully encompass Afghanistan within the framework of\r\nthe concept of a greater Central Asia, through the\r\nadoption of a common vision.\r\nOne of the most important sources of wealth in\r\nour world, which is not only a basis for environmental\r\nbalance but also the most important basis for economic\r\nwell-being, is water resources. The commemoration in\r\n2003 of the International Year of Fresh Water was a\r\nbenchmark in the establishment of an international\r\nwater agenda. We are grateful to all those countries\r\nwhich have supported this initiative on the part of\r\n13\r\nA/60/PV.4\r\nTajikistan. Bearing in mind the serious nature of the\r\nproblem of water for the countries of Central Asia, I\r\npropose that, under the aegis of the United Nations, we\r\nestablish an international mechanism to coordinate\r\nefforts, with a view to alleviating the consequences of\r\nthe destruction of the Aral Sea, whereby we can give\r\npriority to the regional pilot project to achieve the\r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nAs is well known, 22 March 2005 marked the\r\nbeginning of the International Decade for Action,\r\nWater for Life, 2005-2015, which also was proposed\r\nby Tajikistan. As one of the steps towards achieving\r\nthe Millennium Goals, I propose that in 2010 we hold\r\nan international forum in Dushanbe on drinking water,\r\nso that together we can evaluate the practical\r\nimplementation of a coordinated international drinking\r\nwater agenda.\r\nTajikistan has consistently advocated the further\r\nenhancement of the role of the United Nations as a\r\ncentral international forum designed to find a common\r\noverall approach to problems of development in all\r\ncountries and to do this while paying attention to the\r\nspecific conditions of each country. We must do our\r\nutmost to ensure that the current summit meeting will\r\ngo down in history as a breakthrough in the\r\ndevelopment of international cooperation for peace and\r\ndevelopment and as an example of goals achieved. We\r\nrely on a renewed, strong United Nations for support\r\nand assistance in this endeavour.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): The General Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Majesty Don Juan Carlos I, King of the\r\nKingdom of Spain.\r\nKing Juan Carlos I (spoke in Spanish): I should\r\nlike to convey my congratulations to the Co-\r\nChairpersons of this High-level Plenary Meeting, Their\r\nExcellencies the President of Gabon and the Prime\r\nMinister of Sweden, who, I am sure, will lead our\r\ndeliberations very ably.\r\nI would also like to express my appreciation to\r\nthe President of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth\r\nsession, Mr. Jean Ping, for his effective leadership\r\nduring the preparations for this Plenary Meeting. I have\r\nno doubt that his successor, Ambassador Jan Eliasson,\r\nwill implement our decisions successfully.\r\nAbove all, however, we owe the holding of this\r\nmeeting to Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who two\r\nyears ago expressed his belief that the United Nations\r\nwas at a critical juncture and initiated steps to see it\r\nthrough this phase.\r\nBefore proceeding with my statement, I would\r\nlike to reiterate, on my own account, and on behalf of\r\nthe Government and the people of Spain, my most\r\nsincere condolences and solidarity to the authorities\r\nand to the people of the United States of America, as\r\nhost country of our Organization, with respect to the\r\ntragic aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, which has\r\nclaimed so many victims and caused so much\r\ndestruction.\r\nI would like to start by pointing out that we\r\nshould strengthen multilateralism, turning it into a\r\nuseful tool for building an international order based on\r\nthree interdependent, indivisible and fundamental\r\npillars: peace and security, respect for human rights\r\nand sustainable development.\r\nOur societies are every day more conscious of the\r\ncomplex horizons offered by our present world. We\r\ncannot disappoint them. The commemoration of the\r\nsixtieth anniversary of the Organization affords the\r\nideal opportunity for us to agree on an ambitious\r\nprogramme of reforms aimed at reinvigorating and\r\nstrengthening the multilateral mechanisms and\r\ninstitutions of the United Nations system. The United\r\nNations is today, without doubt, the most powerful and\r\ninclusive multilateral instrument available to\r\ninternational society.\r\nThis Plenary Meeting has an ambitious agenda. It\r\nmust evaluate compliance with the Millennium Goals.\r\nThere is no more urgent or crucial task for the\r\ninternational community today. I believe that all of us\r\nhave come here with the clear conviction that we are\r\nstill far from reaching our objectives, and that we\r\ncannot fail to meet the expectations that have been\r\ncreated.\r\nThe new and complex realities emerging at the\r\nbeginning of the twenty-first century highlight the\r\nworlds dramatic struggle between progress and\r\ninequality, without having tools good enough to allow\r\nprogress to benefit everyone equally. The reports and\r\ninformation that are available about the huge needs,\r\ninequalities, injustices and suffering still endured by\r\nmillions of human beings are devastating. This breaks\r\nour hearts, especially where it affects children and the\r\nmost vulnerable.\r\n14\r\nA/60/PV.4\r\nSpain has experienced sustained economic\r\ndevelopment, and thus understands solidarity as a\r\nrising social and personal value. For that reason, we\r\nwould not be faithful to our principles if we were not\r\nready to translate our prosperity into cooperation and\r\ncommitment to others. I am, therefore, pleased to\r\nreiterate Spains firm determination to increase our\r\ncommitment to the eradication of hunger and poverty\r\nand to the development of the worlds most\r\ndisadvantaged countries, devoting particular attention\r\nto the needs of Africa, without forgetting medium-\r\nincome nations, especially those in Latin America.\r\nSpain is firmly committed to peacekeeping\r\nefforts; these should be strengthened. A good\r\nillustration of our commitment is the unselfish\r\ncontribution of our armed and security forces in several\r\nparts of the world, including Haiti, the Balkans and\r\nAfghanistan. I pay special tribute to all those involved\r\nin peacekeeping and international cooperation missions\r\nwho dedicate themselves to their work, up to the\r\nultimate sacrifice of their lives. They are a poignant\r\nexample of dedication to others. I am thinking in\r\nparticular of our soldiers who died recently in\r\nAfghanistan in the performance of the mission\r\nentrusted to them under the mandate of the Security\r\nCouncil to support the current process of\r\nreconstruction and political transition.\r\nNo State can hope today to resolve on its own the\r\ncommon challenges and threats to the coexistence and\r\nwell-being of our peoples. Terrorism, always cruel,\r\nunjustifiable and inhuman; the proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction; the illegal arms trade;\r\nand the serious violations of human rights and\r\ninternational humanitarian law: these all require a\r\ndecisive and collective response, based on solidarity,\r\nand should be duly reflected in the decisions we adopt.\r\nI would like to express before this Assembly\r\nSpains full support for the global counter-terrorism\r\nstrategy of the United Nations, outlined by the\r\nSecretary-General in Madrid on 10 March of this year,\r\nand to recall that one of its main components is\r\nassistance and support for all victims and their\r\nfamilies.\r\nThe reform of United Nations bodies is necessary\r\nto adapt the Organization to its new challenges.\r\n The promotion and protection of human rights is\r\ncentral to Spains foreign policy priorities. We\r\ntherefore support the creation of a Human Rights\r\nCouncil that would assume more effectively the\r\nmandate of the Commission on Human Rights,\r\nincorporating existing protection mechanisms into its\r\nactivities and improving those mechanisms.\r\nRevitalizing the General Assembly in order to\r\nfocus its attention on the priority issues of our time;\r\nreforming the Security Council, based on the broadest\r\npossible agreement, to make it more effective, more\r\ndemocratic, more representative and truly capable of\r\nensuring compliance with its decisions; strengthening\r\nthe role of the Economic and Social Council in an\r\ninterdependent and globalized world; creating a\r\nPeacebuilding Commission that can at last fill the void\r\nthat has existed until now in post-conflict situations;\r\nand, lastly, strengthening the Secretariat and improving\r\nthe management of the Organization: all these are\r\nobjectives that Spain shares. We hope to contribute\r\nactively to achieving them.\r\nBefore concluding, I wish to say that the Spanish\r\nGovernment welcomes the Secretary-Generals\r\nendorsement last July of a Spanish initiative, co-\r\nsponsored by Turkey, by establishing a high-level\r\ngroup that will present a report by the end of 2006 for a\r\nplan of action for a proposed alliance of civilizations.\r\nIn a year that marks the fiftieth anniversary of\r\nSpains membership in the United Nations, may I\r\nreiterate my countrys faithful and firm commitment to\r\nthe purposes and principles of the Charter, to effective\r\nmultilateralism and to a renewed United Nations.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon): I now call on His\r\nExellency Mr. Fradique Bandeira Melo de Menezes,\r\nPresident of the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and\r\nPríncipe.\r\nPresident De Menezes (spoke in Portuguese;\r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): At this time,\r\nas we commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations, we are unanimous in recognizing that\r\ninternational society has undergone many varied\r\nchanges that make it very different from the one that\r\nexisted in the far-off year of 1945. That makes the need\r\nfor an adaptation and revitalization of this Organization\r\nmore than evident.\r\nIt is never too much to emphasize the new\r\nchallenges and threats that mankind is confronted with,\r\nspecifically infectious diseases, the degradation of the\r\nenvironment, natural disasters, international organized\r\ncrime, corruption, the proliferation of all types of\r\n15\r\nA/60/PV.4\r\nweapons, terrorism, constant violations of human\r\nrights and others.\r\nToday we must all recognize that, despite the\r\nsignificant changes in the international political scene,\r\nwe continue to live under permanent and persistent\r\nevidence of new threats, against which we must adopt a\r\nmore vigorous and interventionist position to prevent\r\nexcesses that could jeopardize the survival of mankind\r\nand of nature itself. Eradicating hunger and extreme\r\npoverty, ensuring universal primary education,\r\nfostering gender equality, guaranteeing environmental\r\nsustainability, developing global partnerships, reducing\r\ninfant mortality, improving the health of mothers and\r\nbabies, fighting HIV/AIDS and other sexually\r\ntransmitted diseases and malaria: all these are matters\r\nthat require collective work and, therefore, constitute a\r\ntremendous challenge for all of us.\r\nIn terms of the Millennium Goals, we are all\r\naware of them. We know they are ambitious, but they\r\nconstitute an attainable goal if there is political will on\r\nthe part of the Member States coupled with making the\r\nrequired financial resources available. Therefore,\r\nwords and promises must be transformed into concrete\r\nactions.\r\nAware of our responsibilities and of the need to\r\ncreate conditions and an environment favourable for\r\nmeeting the Millennium Goals, São Tomé and Príncipe\r\nhas adopted a strategic plan to reduce poverty. Many\r\nprincipal development partners have participated in its\r\nimplementation, and from them we request continued\r\nsupport, without which our economic indicators will\r\ncontinue to deteriorate.\r\nIn connection with the Millennium Goals, may I\r\nmake some comments on the report of the Commission\r\nfor Africa, an initiative of the Prime Minister of the\r\nUnited Kingdom, Mr. Tony Blair. This initiative,\r\nincluding the recommendations for African\r\nGovernments, is welcome, and I hope that all members\r\nof the G-8 will endorse them and work toward their\r\nimplementation.\r\nIf we analyse the different conflict situations,\r\nparticularly in Africa, whose resolution was possible\r\nonly thanks to the intervention of the United Nations,\r\nwe are forced to note that in several cases the political\r\nsolution to the conflict was not sufficiently followed\r\nup, leaving serious social and economic situations\r\nunresolved, with often very dramatic effects on the\r\npopulation.\r\nSão Tomé and Príncipe supports the idea of\r\nestablishing a Commission for Peace whose function\r\nwould be to help in conflict prevention. Likewise, we\r\nsupport the idea of cooperation between the United\r\nNations and regional organizations to prevent, manage\r\nand resolve conflicts and to keep the peace. In the case\r\nof Africa this reinforced cooperation with the\r\nspecialized bodies of the African Union will\r\nspecifically allow for the training of resources in this\r\narea.\r\nThe desired reform of our Organization must not\r\nneglect the need to confer upon the United Nations its\r\ntrue universal nature, such that all nations of the world\r\nare represented in it  a fact that has not yet occurred\r\nwith respect to the 23 million inhabitants of Taiwan.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): I now give the floor to Ms. Tarja Halonen,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Finland.\r\nPresident Halonen: My congratulations to the\r\nCo-Chairpersons. I would like to thank cordially all\r\nthose who have contributed to the preparation of this\r\nsummit, in particular Mr. Jean Ping and Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan.\r\nSecurity, development and human rights go hand\r\nin hand, and they are key factors in arriving at a more\r\njust world. Today more than ever before, the\r\nopportunities for doing good are enormous. We have\r\nthe capacity, and we have the knowledge and\r\nresources. We lack only delivery.\r\nWe all are part of the same global community.\r\nWith effective cooperation, we can reform\r\nglobalization and make it an effective tool for\r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nEliminating poverty and inequality and promoting\r\nsustainable development of the economy and the\r\nenvironment are our common goals. We have to\r\nimprove the status and rights of women and respect the\r\nrights of children.\r\nThe international community has begun to\r\nunderstand the importance of the social dimension of\r\nglobalization. Employment has to be made a global\r\ngoal. Access to decent work and an education for all\r\nare the key to lifting individuals and nations from\r\npoverty to prosperity.\r\nThe second conference of the Helsinki Process on\r\nGlobalisation and Democracy, held last week, sent a\r\nmessage to this summit. Dialogue between\r\n16\r\nA/60/PV.4\r\ngovernments, business and non-governmental\r\norganizations will help promote fair globalization.\r\nMore space for multi-stakeholder dialogue is also\r\nneeded in the United Nations.\r\nThe goals of the United Nations Charter are still\r\nvalid. To fulfil them in the globalized world we need\r\neffective multilateralism, institutional reforms and\r\nadequate resources for development. For that, we need\r\nto improve the quantity, quality and effectiveness of\r\naid, as well as policy coherence. In addition, we must\r\nsee that HIV/AIDS is a social challenge calling for a\r\nmultisectoral response. Ensuring reproductive health\r\nand rights is crucial in all aspects of development.\r\nI am happy with the outcome document, which\r\nprovides a basis for further work during the coming\r\nmonths. Still, I would have liked to see our firm\r\ncommitment to fight terrorism accompanied by\r\nprogress in disarmament and non-proliferation as well.\r\nFinland is in favour of a comprehensive reform of\r\nthe United Nations. The General Assembly must regain\r\nits authority. We have to find a solution in this General\r\nAssembly session to Security Council reform. The\r\nCouncil has to be expanded with both new permanent\r\nand new non-permanent members. We need to continue\r\nwith the proper reform of the economic and social\r\nsector of the United Nations.\r\nFinland welcomes the decision to set up a\r\nPeacebuilding Commission. Its work should start by\r\nthe given deadline. Moreover, it is particularly\r\nimportant to strengthen the status of human rights\r\nissues within the United Nations. Our decision to set\r\nup a Human Rights Council is excellent, but all the\r\nmodalities need to be resolved as a matter of urgency.\r\nFor real progress, we must ensure that enough women\r\nparticipate in the work of these new bodies.\r\nWe have committed ourselves to challenging\r\ngoals, in particular to reducing extreme poverty by half\r\nby the year 2015. So far, our efforts have not been\r\nsufficient. We all now share the responsibility for\r\nmaking the common goals come true.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): I now give the floor to Her Excellency\r\nMrs. Vaira Vike-Freiberga, President of the Republic of\r\nLatvia.\r\nPresident Vike-Freiberga: As we gather to mark\r\nthe sixtieth anniversary of the United Nations, we\r\nrecognize that it needs fundamental and far-reaching\r\nreforms to remain viable as an organization and to be\r\ncapable of meeting the modern-day challenges of the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nFreedom from want, freedom from fear and\r\nfreedom to live in dignity must be the leading goals of\r\nour Organization so that we can meet the rightful\r\nexpectations of our peoples across the globe.\r\nAs one of the Secretary-Generals five special\r\nenvoys, I have heard many expressions of support for\r\nthe Secretary-Generals proposals contained in his\r\nreport In larger freedom, an important and historical\r\ndocument for the United Nations. Yet reaching a\r\nconsensus has proved to be a very difficult task indeed,\r\nas many of us have approached these proposals from\r\nquite radically different viewpoints.\r\nThe President of the General Assembly at its\r\nfifty-ninth session, Mr. Jean Ping, deserves our highest\r\npraise for showing leadership and crafting an outcome\r\ndocument that reflects our concerns and aspirations in\r\na fair and delicately balanced way. Adoption of this\r\ndocument will provide us with a framework for action.\r\nThe stakes are higher than they have ever been. We\r\nmust display the political will and the courage to forge\r\nahead with implementation of our decisions. We have\r\nreaffirmed our commitment to achieving the United\r\nNations Millennium Development Goals of reducing\r\npoverty and disease, promoting childrens education\r\nand gender equality, fostering sustainable and\r\nenvironmentally friendly development and creating an\r\ninternational climate of peace and security among the\r\nnations of this planet. Any aid programme must be\r\nadministered responsibly through good governance in\r\nan honest, open and transparent manner.\r\nI am pleased that we have agreed on the need to\r\nestablish a Peacebuilding Commission by the end of\r\nthe year. The Commission can fill a vital role in post-\r\nconflict recovery and consolidation of sustainable\r\npeace.\r\nI am also pleased that we have agreed on the\r\nestablishment of a Human Rights Council, but I wish to\r\nstress that such a body must be endowed with genuine\r\nauthority. I welcome the decision to strengthen the\r\nOffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights\r\nand to provide it with the funds necessary for its\r\nactivities.\r\nHuman rights go hand in hand with democracy,\r\nwhich is why Latvia supports the establishment of a\r\n17\r\nA/60/PV.4\r\nDemocracy Fund. I am firmly convinced that such a\r\nfund could provide valuable assistance to those\r\ncountries that have embarked on the path of\r\nconsolidating democratic political systems and the rule\r\nof law.\r\nA major step forward is our unequivocal\r\ncondemnation of terrorism in all its forms and\r\nmanifestations. Terrorism is a scourge that requires the\r\nconcerted efforts of the entire international community\r\nto be defeated and defeated it must be. We need to\r\nachieve rapid progress on concluding a comprehensive\r\nconvention on international terrorism.\r\nFor the past 12 years, we have been engaged in\r\ndiscussions about changes to the Security Council.\r\nAlthough practically everyone agrees on the need to\r\nreform this important United Nations body and to\r\nrender it more representative of todays geopolitical\r\nrealities, no consensus has been reached regarding the\r\nmanner in which that should be done. It promises to be\r\none of the most difficult issues to resolve, but we\r\nshould nevertheless not abandon our efforts to reach a\r\nfeasible accord by the end of this year.\r\nThe United Nations has recently gone through\r\nsome difficult times. We must never forget the many\r\nyears of devoted service and sacrifice on the part of the\r\nmajority of the United Nations workers. Unfortunately,\r\nwe have also seen cases of graft, theft and\r\nembezzlement in the United Nations administrative\r\nstructures. We have heard horror stories of women and\r\nchildren being raped and abused by individual blue\r\nhelmet peacekeepers. That is why we must take some\r\nhard and responsible decisions and that is why we must\r\nimplement some resolute measures to ensure that such\r\nmajor transgressions never happen again. We must do\r\nwhat is required to strengthen and reform this\r\nOrganization, for, despite its imperfections, the world\r\ndoes need the United Nations. It needs it now more\r\nthan ever before.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): The General Assembly will now hear a\r\nstatement from His Excellency Mr. Festus Mogae,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Botswana.\r\nPresident Mogae: Five years ago we convened\r\nhere in New York to usher in a new millennium. With\r\ngreat enthusiasm and hope, we then resolved to tackle\r\nthe key challenges facing our world. In particular, we\r\ncommitted ourselves to fight extreme poverty,\r\npreventable diseases, human conflict, environmental\r\ndegradation and global warming. The resulting\r\nMillennium Declaration that was adopted has become\r\nthe framework by which we have set ourselves targets\r\nto ensure that we take action to build a better world for\r\nall our people. In our collective commitment as\r\nMember States of this body, rich and poor, large and\r\nsmall, weak and strong, we have recognized an\r\nobligation to work together in order to create a more\r\njust and more equitable global order. We also then\r\nrealized that, by virtue of its universality, the United\r\nNations remains the only vehicle through which we can\r\nrealize our universal aspirations.\r\nThe challenges facing the United Nations today\r\nare daunting. If anything, they have become more\r\ncomplex and more demanding than they were 60 years\r\nago. Botswana believes that to enhance the role and\r\nrelevance of the United Nations and to keep it so that it\r\ncan respond to the evolving challenges of the twenty-\r\nfirst century, this summit must move forward in key\r\nareas, namely, the implementation of previously agreed\r\ninternational development goals, overcoming threats to\r\ninternational peace and security, ensuring enhanced\r\nrespect for human rights and the rule of law, and\r\nachieving long-sought institutional reform. Botswana\r\nis convinced that through collective measures we can\r\novercome these challenges. In this regard, the\r\nMonterrey Consensus provides a framework for the\r\nglobal community to mobilize financial resources.\r\nProgress will also be enhanced if the commitments\r\nmade at the recent G-8 Summit in Scotland are fully\r\nand expeditiously implemented. We welcome here the\r\ncommitment by a number of developed countries to\r\nincrease their development expenditure to 0.7% of\r\ntheir GNI between now and 2015. With respect to\r\ntrade, Botswana encourages accelerated progress in the\r\ncurrent Doha round negotiations, which could pave the\r\nway for the round itself to be completed by next year.\r\nThe High-level Panel of Eminent Persons has\r\nreconfirmed the interrelationship between\r\ndevelopment, human rights, peace and security. It is\r\nour responsibility to find further consensus on these\r\nissues in the context of the new threats and\r\nopportunities that face us all over this globalized\r\nworld.\r\nWe in Botswana condemn terrorism in all its\r\nmanifestations. We believe that the international\r\ncommunity should be able to agree on a comprehensive\r\nconvention on terrorism on the basis of a common\r\ndefinition and a common understanding of what\r\n18\r\nA/60/PV.4\r\nconstitutes terrorist acts. This session should\r\nendeavour to reach agreement on these two related\r\nissues.\r\nConflicts on our own continent are naturally of\r\nparticular concern to us. Currently a number of African\r\ncountries are under Security Council consideration and\r\nalso account for a significant portion of the United\r\nNations peacekeeping budget. The resolution of these\r\nconflicts can go a long way toward ensuring the\r\neconomic and social development of the wider African\r\nregion, as well as that of the affected countries\r\nthemselves. To this end, there is need for greater\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nAfrican Union to strengthen conflict prevention and\r\npeacekeeping mechanisms.\r\nThe debate on United Nations reform has been\r\ngoing on for a long time. After 12 years of negotiation\r\non Security Council reform, the time is now ripe to\r\nmove forward, and in 60 years of existence the\r\nmembership of the United Nations has grown from 51\r\nto 191 Member States. This underscores the need to\r\ntransform this critical organ in order to make it more\r\nrepresentative of our world of today, through increased\r\nmembership and improved working methods.\r\nAdmittedly, this summit faces difficult decisions on the\r\nreform of the Security Council, but the\r\nrecommendations made by the High-level Panel\r\nprovide us with a guide for consensus. In this respect,\r\nno position should be embraced as if it were a dogma,\r\nfor the status quo is not in our collective interest. For\r\nour part, Botswana is prepared to be flexible in\r\nnegotiations conducted in good faith.\r\nA consensus has now emerged on the need to\r\nrevitalize the General Assembly in its role as the\r\ndeliberative policymaking and representative organ of\r\nthe United Nations. In this regard, Botswana shares the\r\nview that the role and authority of the Assembly must\r\nbe reasserted and its President should play a greater\r\nleadership role in refocusing its agenda. Botswana has,\r\nover the years, demonstrated commitment to the\r\nprinciples of democracy, social justice, human rights\r\nand the rule of law. These very principles continue to\r\nmotivate our commitment to ensuring that human\r\nrights issues receive prominence in our global agenda.\r\nWe therefore support measures that are intended to\r\nstrengthen the focus on human rights issues including\r\nthe creation of a new Human Rights Council.\r\nGuaranteeing the full enjoyment of human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms is one aspect of the broader\r\nmandate of the United Nations to protect our\r\npopulations. In this day and age we can no longer\r\nafford to stand back if a country fails to protect its\r\ncitizens against grave human rights abuses. In this\r\nrespect, we embrace the concept of responsibility to\r\nprotect.\r\nAnother welcome initiative that Botswana\r\nsupports is the establishment of a Peacebuilding\r\nCommission. We are convinced that this important\r\npost-conflict recovery mechanism can create the\r\nopportunity for millions of people to achieve\r\nsustainable development where before there was\r\nturmoil and despair. Botswana commends the\r\nSecretary-General for his ongoing efforts to implement\r\nmanagement reform of the United Nations. To better\r\nfacilitate the mandates we entrust to him, the\r\nSecretary-General will require not only adequate\r\nresources, but also greater authority, so as to ensure\r\nthat the Organization is able to rapidly respond to\r\nevolving priorities.\r\nIn conclusion, this summit provides us all with a\r\nhistoric opportunity to make far-reaching decisions on\r\nthe reform of the Organization. Botswanas view is that\r\nreform is imperative if the United Nations is to have\r\nthe ability to respond to the critical challenges of the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): The General Assembly will now hear a\r\nstatement from His Excellency Mr. Pervez Musharraf,\r\nPresident of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.\r\nPresident Musharraf: It is a privilege to address\r\nthis sixtieth session of the General Assembly. We are\r\nparticipating in an historic event  the endeavour to\r\nestablish a just world order for the twenty-first century.\r\nThe decisions we take here will have far-reaching\r\nconsequences. It is, therefore, our solemn\r\nresponsibility to bequeath a legacy of hope and peace\r\nto future generations. We cannot afford to fail.\r\nThanks to the Secretary-General and President\r\nJean Ping, a year s process of reflection and\r\ndiscussion has produced ideas and proposals to\r\nenhance international security, development and human\r\nrights.\r\nThis High-level Plenary Meeting offers us an\r\nopportunity to recommit ourselves to the principles and\r\npurposes of the United Nations Charter. Let us pledge\r\n19\r\nA/60/PV.4\r\nto make the United Nations a more effective and\r\nrelevant institution for the twenty-first century.\r\nWe believe that international security can be best\r\npromoted when every State sees peace as being in its\r\nbest interest; when States believe that they can realize\r\ntheir interests through mutual cooperation; when the\r\nsupremacy of equitable principles is established over\r\nthe realities of unequal power; when Member States\r\nagree to utilize the United Nations to harmonize their\r\npolicies and reconcile their interests.\r\nThe Security Council should work openly on\r\nbehalf of the general membership. The Council should\r\nbecome more representative, not by adding a new elite,\r\nbut by reflecting more fully the entire spectrum of the\r\nUnited Nations membership. This can be achieved only\r\nthrough patient dialogue and general consensus.\r\nThe challenges confronting international peace\r\nand security are formidable and many. Terrorism and\r\nthe threat from weapons of mass destruction are among\r\nthem. Yet, even as we address new threats, we should\r\nnot, and we cannot, ignore the legacy of festering\r\nproblems left by the past. Peace and justice must come\r\nto the people of Palestine as well as of Jammu and\r\nKashmir.\r\nWe must be prepared not only to proclaim our\r\nprinciples but also to defend them and, above all, live\r\nup to them. United Nations resolutions, especially\r\ndecisions of the Security Council, must be\r\nimplemented.\r\nIt is in this spirit that Pakistan is pursuing the\r\ncomposite dialogue with India. We want the dialogue\r\nprocess to result in the start of a new era of peace and\r\ncooperation in South Asia. Our nations must not\r\nremain trapped by hate and history in a cycle of\r\nconfrontation and conflict. For this to happen, it is\r\nessential to find a just solution of the dispute over\r\nJammu and Kashmir, acceptable to Pakistan and India\r\nand above all to the people of Kashmir.\r\nToday, terrorism is a primary threat to world\r\norder. We must fight terrorism, in all its forms, outlaw\r\nit and eliminate it. We need a comprehensive strategy\r\nfor success. At the same time, we need to understand\r\nand address the motives behind terrorist acts. These\r\nmay not justify terrorism, but they do explain it. To\r\neliminate terrorist violence, we will need to eliminate it\r\nin the minds of potential terrorists. No religion\r\nsanctions terrorism. The motives of terrorists, however\r\nmisguided, are always political. I have suggested a\r\nstrategy of enlightened moderation, which can ensure\r\nsuccess in eliminating terrorism and extremism. I trust\r\nthat this will be reflected in the deliberations of the\r\nnew commission created by the Secretary-General on\r\nan alliance of civilizations.\r\nWeapons of mass destruction must not fall into\r\nthe hands of terrorists. To prevent this, we must aim to\r\neliminate both the terrorists and the weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. The catastrophic consequences of a\r\nnuclear war make it imperative to prevent one from\r\never taking place. Both the proliferation and the\r\nperpetual possession of nuclear weapons pose an\r\nunacceptable global danger. We must evolve a new\r\nconsensus to achieve disarmament and non-\r\nproliferation.\r\nWe also need to prevent the destabilizing\r\naccumulation and build-up of conventional weapons\r\nand forces, especially in regions of tension such as the\r\nMiddle East, South Asia and North-East Asia. Pakistan\r\nwill continue to promote a nuclear and conventional\r\nweapons restraint regime in South Asia.\r\nPeace and development are interdependent.\r\nAlthough action for development must be largely local,\r\nit is critically dependent  in our globalized world \r\non the external economic environment. Paradoxically,\r\nglobalization has increased both poverty and\r\nprosperity. The rules of international trade and finance\r\nand technology access are weighted against the poor\r\nand the weak. In fact, the poor should be offered a\r\ndevelopment handicap to enable them to successfully\r\nintegrate into a world market of unequal players.\r\nThe empowerment of women through an\r\narticulated strategy, such as we have initiated in\r\nPakistan, is particularly crucial for bringing about\r\nsocial change. Respect for human rights is an integral\r\nelement of both peace and development. Economic\r\nrights are as important as political and civil rights. A\r\nhungry man is never a free man. The new human rights\r\narchitecture we will create  such as the proposed\r\nHuman Rights Council  should advance human\r\nrights through cooperation and mutual support.\r\nGenocide, ethnic cleansing and similar grave violations\r\nmust be prevented. As a first step, the United Nations\r\nshould be given a standing authority to send a fact-\r\nfinding mission to the area where a conflict has broken\r\nout.\r\n20\r\nA/60/PV.4\r\nPakistan has contributed actively and\r\nconstructively to the preparation of this High-level\r\nPlenary Meeting s important decisions. We shall work\r\nequally to ensure that our decisions are translated into\r\naction.\r\nAt this meeting, let us resolve to make poverty\r\nhistory, peace permanent and freedom universal.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): The General Assembly will now hear a\r\nstatement from His Excellency Mr. Robert Gabriel\r\nMugabe, President of the Republic of Zimbabwe.\r\nPresident Mugabe: Let me begin by\r\ncongratulating the Co-Chairpersons for accepting the\r\nonerous task of presiding over this epochal event. I am\r\nconfident that their able leadership will successfully\r\ncarry us through this session.\r\nFive years ago, we met here in New York at the\r\nMillennium Summit and agreed on eight development\r\ngoals that we believed were realistic and achievable.\r\nWe were hopeful that, all things being equal, we would\r\nbe able to meet the targets we had set for ourselves in\r\norder to achieve those Goals.\r\nIt is now for us to review the progress we have\r\nmade in implementing the Millennium Declaration.\r\nRegrettably, for many developing countries, including\r\nZimbabwe, all things have not been equal. Our national\r\nprogress report, launched recently, shows that our\r\nefforts have been seriously affected by recurrent\r\ndroughts and floods, HIV and AIDS and, of course,\r\nunilateral sanctions imposed on us by countries that do\r\nnot wish us well.\r\nAs a result, we are lagging behind on many of our\r\ntargets. While the challenges are great, so is our\r\ncommitment to achieving our MDGs, even with our\r\nlimited means. Our achievements in the area of\r\nuniversal primary education are a testimony to that\r\nresolve. We have also committed ourselves to\r\naddressing extreme poverty and hunger by\r\nredistributing land to the majority of our citizens, who\r\nhad been condemned to conditions of squalor by years\r\nof colonialism and its vestiges.\r\nIn reviewing the progress made towards the\r\nattainment of the Millennium Development Goals, we\r\nmust have the courage to go beyond the mere posturing\r\nthat is characterized by name-calling, finger-pointing\r\nand false accusations. Developing countries should be\r\naccorded policy space to develop their own strategies\r\ntailored to their developmental needs, within a\r\nframework that provides for accountability,\r\ntransparency and integrity in the system. Development\r\ncannot proceed in the context of ideological rigidities\r\nand models that are not applicable to the diverse\r\nconditions and circumstances that exist in developing\r\ncountries.\r\nThis is why, in global economic governance and\r\nthe shaping of policies affecting international\r\neconomic relations, it is important to ensure the\r\nexistence of an inclusive process of decision-making in\r\nwhich developing countries can play a meaningful role.\r\nThe simple fact is that every Government has the\r\nprimary responsibility to promote and safeguard the\r\neconomic and social development of its people.\r\nInternational efforts should only complement national\r\nprogrammes.\r\nThe challenge facing the attainment of the MDGs\r\nhas not been the strategies and objectives as defined;\r\nrather, it lies within the degree of implementation. Not\r\nenough has been done to fulfil the commitments\r\nundertaken in the various United Nations conferences\r\nand summits. We are, therefore, concerned about the\r\ncontinuous, significant and clearly calculated decline\r\nin official development assistance (ODA) in recent\r\nyears and reiterate the urgent need for a substantial\r\nincrease of ODA, as agreed at Monterrey, Mexico.\r\nAs we deliberate on the institutional reform of the\r\nUnited Nations, let us do so in a manner that is open,\r\ntransparent and consultative and that will deepen and\r\nconsolidate multilateralism. Let us seek to secure the\r\nworld by addressing the root causes of the present\r\ninsecurity, which are to be found in poverty, hunger\r\nand disease on the one hand, and intolerance, double\r\nstandards, xenophobia, selectivity and self-\r\nrighteousness in our approach to issues on the other. A\r\nreformed United Nations should be one that plays a\r\nkey role in coordinating development issues. The\r\nvision that we must present for a future United Nations\r\nshould not be one filled with vague concepts that\r\nprovide an opportunity for those States that seek to\r\ninterfere in the internal affairs of other States.\r\nConcepts such as humanitarian intervention and the\r\nresponsibility to protect need careful scrutiny in\r\norder to test the motives of their proponents.\r\nThe ongoing consultations on the restructuring of\r\nthe United Nations are a matter of extreme importance\r\nto us and to the rest of the world. The current skewed\r\n21\r\nA/60/PV.4\r\npower structures in the world body cannot be condoned\r\non any conceivable grounds of democracy. Organs of\r\nthe United Nations, including the Security Council,\r\nmust be restructured to reflect the full will of nations\r\ngreat and small. We need to avoid situations where a\r\nfew countries, by virtue of their privileged positions,\r\ntheir wealth or their military might, dictate the agenda\r\nfor everybody else. We have witnessed instances where\r\nthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of small and\r\nweak countries have been violated by the mighty and\r\npowerful, in defiance of agreed rules of procedures and\r\nthe provisions of the United Nations Charter  even\r\non the basis of contrived lies: lies told in order to\r\ncreate a basis for aggression. And we have seen that\r\naggression occur, even in the context of the so-called\r\ncoalition. A coalition to defy international law becomes\r\nan aggressor coalition; indeed, it becomes a coalition\r\nof evil.\r\nThe international community needs, as it has\r\ndone now, to return to the drawing board to rediscover,\r\nreassert and pursue in a practical manner the agenda\r\nfor peace, security and development for all through\r\nfostering genuine cooperation based on respect for the\r\nsovereignty, equality and territorial integrity of all\r\nStates big or small, rich or poor, mighty or not mighty.\r\nIt is within this context that we call upon the\r\ninternational community to remain true to the original\r\nprinciples and objectives of the United Nations Charter\r\nto achieve peace, security and development. This will\r\nallow us to bequeath to future generations a far safer,\r\nmore prosperous and more stable world. It is my hope\r\nthat, as we conclude our deliberations at this session,\r\nwe will have asserted our commitment to those ideals.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): The General Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika,\r\nPresident of the Peoples Democratic Republic of\r\nAlgeria and former President of the General Assembly.\r\nPresident Bouteflika (spoke in Arabic): It would\r\nnot be excessively pessimistic to say that the world in\r\nwhich we live is in a bad state. Apart from terrorism \r\nwhich is now appearing almost everywhere, and the list\r\nof whose victims and material damage continues to get\r\nlonger  natural disasters in various places are\r\nstriking populations with unprecedented violence,\r\nleaving death in their wake. As for the environment, it\r\nis deteriorating dangerously because of the excessive\r\nconsumption of natural resources and because of the\r\nspread of industrialization that is more interested in\r\nimmediate profit than in the future of humankind. All\r\nof this is happening in spite of the commitments\r\nentered into at the Millennium Summit to fight poverty,\r\ndisease and misery.\r\nToday, we should rely on our Organization to\r\ncoordinate and stimulate our efforts. This Organization\r\nwas created for another era, and it quickly appeared\r\nthat it could not face up to the problems of the modern\r\nworld. International peace and security are fragile, and\r\nwhat has been labelled as clashes among cultures and\r\ninterests has become a tangible conflict. However, the\r\nUnited Nations represents a valuable achievement that\r\nhas to be reinforced and preserved. It needs serious\r\nrevamping, which would strengthen its dynamism and\r\nallow us to have a better take on realities today. This\r\nreform should not be limited to an expansion of and\r\nincrease in the power or the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council. There are other aspects that are just\r\nas important, on which we can have agreement.\r\nI would like to emphasize the important role to be\r\nplayed by the General Assembly, which is entrusted\r\nwith global sovereignty. We should also take another\r\nlook at all of the institutions in the system and, at any\r\nrate, it should be clear to all that this desire to revamp\r\nthe Organization should not cast doubt on our\r\nunswerving dedication to the Charter of the United\r\nNations and its principles, nor our faith in the virtue\r\nand the value of the rule of law and of international\r\naction.\r\nThe untenable injustice done to the Palestinian\r\npeople is further proof of the failure of the\r\ninternational order over the past six decades. The\r\nsituation does not comply with international legality, as\r\nis also the case with the decolonization of the Western\r\nSahara, which continues to be an urgent task for the\r\nOrganization, one for which it must assume full\r\nresponsibility.\r\nOur contribution to the support and updating of\r\nour international institutions is based on our aspirations\r\nand hope that as a result of the joining of all ideas and\r\nopinions, there will be light at the end of the tunnel for\r\nall humankind for the future.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): The Assembly will now hear an address by\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Nestor Carlos Kirchner, President\r\nof the Argentine Republic.\r\n22\r\nA/60/PV.4\r\nPresident Kirchner (spoke in Spanish): Five\r\nyears ago, the Governments of our countries gathered\r\nin this very hall, hoping to work together in solving\r\nsome of the most urgent and serious problems\r\nconfronting our peoples. That is how the Millennium\r\nDeclaration arose, and, with it, a renewed commitment\r\nby the international community to multilateralism and\r\nrespect for human dignity. Concrete goals in\r\ndevelopment were promoted, aimed at resolving the\r\nimperative issues of hunger, poverty, infant mortality\r\nrates, diseases such as HIV-AIDS and malaria and\r\nother pandemics, and issues of social and legal gender\r\ninequality. The assessment of what we have achieved\r\nin these few years is far from satisfactory. The severity\r\nof the situation is basically the same. The modest\r\nadvances in some issues, cannot, however, weaken our\r\nwill or numb our conscience. Poverty, hunger and\r\ndisease continue to afflict a vast proportion of women\r\nand men around the world. The absence of the rule of\r\nlaw and the massive violations of human rights in\r\nvarious parts of the world cause great suffering and\r\ndeepen political instability and civil conflicts. The new\r\nand grave threats to international security have\r\npermeated the whole spectrum of international debate.\r\nPoverty, social inequality, injustice, social exclusion\r\nand the estrangement between expectations and reality\r\nbring about an element of instability, working against\r\nthe strengthening of democracy and development.\r\nA large part of the problem lies perhaps in the\r\nlack of correspondence between statements, true\r\nexpressions of wish, and action. This is evident in two\r\nkey areas, debt and international trade. The persistence\r\nof discriminatory and inequitable policies in\r\ninternational trade is part of this list of impediments to\r\ndevelopment, both for the poorest nations and for\r\nmiddle-income countries, such as my own, Argentina.\r\nThe prevalence of an ideological component in\r\nthe policies of international credit institutions is also\r\ndistressing. The so-called orthodox approach to the\r\ndebt is an approach that has shown its shortcomings\r\nand inefficiency and that has worsened the conditions\r\nof poverty in the developing world, and this is perhaps\r\nthe area where the prevalence of this component\r\nbecomes most evident. Economic development,\r\nsecurity and human rights are the basic pillars of the\r\nUnited Nations, and therefore the simultaneous\r\nprogress that we achieve in all these three areas is the\r\nbest assurance of international peace and the well-\r\nbeing of humanity.\r\nWith great effort, Argentina is returning to the\r\npath of development and has achieved sustained\r\ngrowth in its economy, while at the same time\r\nsignificantly reducing unemployment and poverty\r\nindices. After emerging from the crisis, indicators\r\nshow a sustained growth in the economy, and a surplus\r\nin the fiscal external accounts, together with a recovery\r\nin national reserves. Argentina grew 8.8 per cent in\r\n2003, 9 per cent in 2004 and over 9 per cent in the first\r\nhalf of 2005. The consolidated primary surplus is 5 per\r\ncent of GDP and reserves have increased from nearly\r\nten billion dollars to over twenty-five billion. Exports\r\nthis year will exceed forty billion dollars, with an\r\nestimated growth of about 15 per cent.\r\nUnemployment dropped from 24 per cent in 2003\r\nto 12.1 per cent over the first half of 2005. Poverty has\r\ndropped from 57.5 per cent to 40.2 per cent and\r\nabsolute poverty rates have come down from 27.5 per\r\ncent in 2003 to 15 percent in 2004 and continue to\r\ndecline. The real general salary index has risen 16 per\r\ncent.\r\nSince overcoming default, Argentina has been\r\nstrengthening its position as a target for foreign\r\ninvestment. Primary education enrolment is over\r\n91.5 per cent. Illiteracy is under 3 per cent and\r\nwomens literacy rates are over 97.4 per cent. Womens\r\nparticipation is growing and as a result, women hold\r\nover 33 per cent of seats in the House of\r\nRepresentatives and 43 per cent of seats in the Senate.\r\nInfant mortality rates have dropped significantly from\r\n16.8 per 1,000 to the current 13 per 1,000. Public\r\nhealth programmes are being implemented now\r\ncovering the entire population. Drinking water supplies\r\nand sewage systems are being expanded. Through an\r\nagreement with Brazil, medicines are going to be\r\nproduced in order to cover the entire population\r\ninfected with AIDS at an affordable price. Regrettably,\r\nthroughout this process of recovery, expansion and\r\ntransformation, we did not have the support of the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund, which had provided\r\nsupport until only weeks before the convertibility\r\nregime. During its crisis, Argentina made net payments\r\nof about 13.5 billion dollars.\r\nLike many developing countries, we continue to\r\nendure both this archaic understanding of the\r\nindebtedness issue and an international trade system\r\nthat is unfair to agricultural products, where subsidies\r\nand non-tariff barriers in developed countries continue\r\n23\r\nA/60/PV.4\r\nto restrain our countries from full growth based on\r\ntheir genuine resources.\r\nIn this sense, we call for the Ministerial\r\nConference of the World Trade Organization, which is\r\nto be held in Hong Kong, China, to fulfil the\r\nunfulfilled promise of placing development at the\r\ncentre of international trade.\r\nWe are attentively following the international\r\ndebate on the concept of the sustainability of external\r\ndebt.\r\nWe believe that international finances are too\r\nimportant to be left in the hands of concerted interests\r\nthat affect the stability of markets, discriminate against\r\nthe small investor and spawn pro-cyclical policies.\r\nThat is why, in various forums, we have proposed\r\nmodifications that increase the transparency of the\r\ninternational financial system, free this Organization\r\nfrom certain financial lobbies and bring enhanced\r\nstability to the capital flow, which promotes small\r\ninvestors.\r\nThere is neither ideology nor politics in this. We\r\nshow concrete facts indicating that these financial\r\norganizations did not perform the role that they must\r\nperform.\r\nLooking ahead, our country has structured a debt\r\nreduction strategy designed to gain degrees of\r\nindependence as it implements its plans for\r\ndevelopment and the growth of its economy.\r\nIn this regard, we wish to reaffirm that payment\r\nof external financial commitments must not be made to\r\nthe detriment of resources pledged to social areas, such\r\nas education, health, housing and employment. We\r\nshall be firm in maintaining this position when dealing\r\nwith the international credit organizations, and we\r\nreiterate our call for increased transparency and\r\ndemocracy and for a deep restructuring and revision of\r\ntheir policies, in order to ensure fairness and efficiency.\r\nAlong these lines, Argentina has, since 2004,\r\nbeen a co-sponsor of the United Nations Commission\r\non Human Rights resolution on the effects of structural\r\nadjustment policies and foreign debt on the full\r\nenjoyment of all human rights, particularly economic,\r\nsocial and cultural rights, which alludes clearly to the\r\nrelationship between external indebtedness and the\r\nimpossibility of effective enjoyment of human rights.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to express the fervent hope\r\nof the people of Argentina that the United Nations will\r\ncontinue to guide us along the path towards peace,\r\njustice and development.\r\nMany resolutions of this General Assembly and\r\nthe Special Political and Decolonization Committee\r\nhave established that the question of the Malvinas\r\nIslands, South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands are\r\na special colonial situation that must be resolved\r\nthrough bilateral negotiations between my country and\r\nthe United Kingdom. The Decolonization Committee\r\nhas made repeated declarations to that effect, and we\r\ngreatly value its action in seeking a solution to this\r\nquestion.\r\nWe once again reaffirm the constant readiness of\r\nour country to reach a final, fair and peaceful solution\r\nto this sovereignty dispute that is of central concern to\r\nthe people of Argentina. We, therefore, urge the United\r\nKingdom to respond promptly to the call of the\r\ninternational community to resume negotiations.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): The General Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by Mr. Benjamin William Mkapa, President of\r\nthe United Republic of Tanzania.\r\nPresident Mkapa: In 2000, world leaders\r\nundertook an in-depth review of decades of global\r\nefforts and unfulfilled promises to fight unacceptable\r\nlevels of poverty. They agreed on shared universal\r\nvalues, and they ushered in hopes for timed and\r\nmeasurable development goals, the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs).\r\nToday, five years later, leaders stand accused of\r\nhaving failed to live up to their commitments. The\r\nMillennium Development Goals reflect our shared\r\nvalues about basic human rights  the right to live in\r\ndignity. We cannot turn our backs on these basic values\r\nand the duties they impose on all countries and\r\nGovernments. To do so would devalue our common\r\nhumanity. We should, instead, renew our commitment,\r\nindividually and collectively, to the MDGs and to their\r\nfull integration into our national domestic policies,\r\ninternational development strategies, policies and\r\nactions.\r\nFor too long, there has been an unnecessary\r\ndebate about whether the solution to poverty in Africa\r\nand elsewhere is more money. Of course, it is not\r\nsimply a question of money. But, without money, few\r\n24\r\nA/60/PV.4\r\nstrategies, if any, could succeed. Likewise, good\r\ngovernance is necessary; but it alone will not eradicate\r\npoverty.\r\nThe developing countries are not blaming rich\r\nand industrialized countries for everything that is\r\nwrong or unfulfilled. What they are asking of them is a\r\nnew commitment to keep their word. Developing\r\ncountries, for their part, must fulfil their commitments\r\nto mobilize domestic resources, reform institutions to\r\nrespond to national priorities and adopt effective,\r\nnationally owned economic and social policies to spur\r\neconomic growth. The broader commitments to\r\ndemocracy, human rights and good governance must\r\nalso be discharged.\r\nDeveloped countries, for their part, must fulfil\r\ntheir responsibilities by increasing the flow and\r\nimproving the effectiveness of development assistance;\r\nthey must ensure that the Doha trade round is truly\r\ndevelopment-oriented; they must embrace wider and\r\ndeeper debt relief; and they must facilitate technology\r\ntransfer.\r\nI thank the few rich countries that have attained\r\nor exceeded the target of 0.7 per cent of national\r\nincome as official development assistance (ODA). I\r\nthank the European Union for having a timetable for\r\nthe different member countries to reach this target by\r\nthe year 2015. I thank the G-8 leaders who, in their\r\nGleneagles Summit, agreed to increase annual aid\r\nflows and cancel the debts of least developed countries.\r\nI call on them not to backslide on these honourable\r\ncommitments.\r\nThen there is the unnecessary debate about\r\nabsorptive capacity. Developing countries must be\r\nassessed severally, not collectively, to determine\r\nwhether they have the system of governance and the\r\nabsorptive capacity to benefit from increased levels of\r\nresources.\r\nLet me use the example of my own country with\r\nregard to education goals. Using our own enhanced\r\ndomestic revenues, increased ODA and debt relief, we\r\nwere able to invest heavily in education, improving\r\naccess and quality. We removed school fees for\r\nprimary education, and the net enrolment rate increased\r\nfrom 58.8 per cent in 2000 to 90.5 per cent last year;\r\nand gender parity has been attained.\r\nBy 2006, Tanzania will have attained the second\r\nMillennium Development Goal, nine years ahead of\r\ntarget. Yes, where a developing country and its\r\ndevelopment partners all fulfil their responsibilities, it\r\nis possible to fast-track the attainment of the MDGs.\r\nIt never occurred to me that this body, meeting at\r\nsuch a high level, could have problems, not in agreeing\r\nto eradicate, but only in recommitting itself to halve\r\npoverty by 2015. I seriously urge the world to focus\r\nmore on preventing crises than on responding to them.\r\nWhen a jumbo jet crashes, we all rush in with\r\nassistance; but we forget that every day 30,000\r\nchildren die unnecessarily from poverty-related\r\npreventable causes; this loss is equivalent to 100 jumbo\r\njet crashes every day.\r\nA number of blueprints for success in the war on\r\npoverty have been promulgated since 2000. These\r\ninclude the Monterrey Consensus; the World\r\nCommission on the Social Dimension of Globalization;\r\nthe Commission for Africa; the United Nations\r\nMillennium Project and others. Let us now start their\r\nimplementation.\r\nAid is not charity; it is an investment in peace,\r\nsecurity and human solidarity. By not addressing the\r\ncauses of poverty, we are institutionalizing the business\r\nof charity. It does not make political sense; it does not\r\nmake economic sense; it does not make ethical sense.\r\nI commit my Government and country to the\r\ntimed pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals\r\nand ask all countries, rich and poor, at the very\r\nminimum to implement fully the outcome document\r\nfrom this meeting, for which I commend the\r\nnegotiators.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): The Assembly will now hear an address by\r\nHis Excellency Mr. László Sólyom, President of the\r\nRepublic of Hungary.\r\nPresident Sólyom: It is indeed an honour and\r\nprivilege for me to attend this High-level Plenary\r\nMeeting of the General Assembly of the United\r\nNations. Without the United Nations, todays world\r\nwould be a place with less security and freedom, less\r\nsocial justice and democracy.\r\nOn the other hand, today we face unprecedented\r\nchallenges and grave menaces. Here, I have in mind\r\nterrorist acts, the danger of proliferation of weapons of\r\nmass destruction and internal armed conflicts. We\r\ncontinue to be haunted by shocking human suffering\r\nfrom hunger, poverty and disease and extraordinary\r\n25\r\nA/60/PV.4\r\nnatural disasters. We also have to confront the serious\r\ndegradation of the environment.\r\nWe fully concur with the Secretary-Generals\r\nreport, in which he states that challenges in the areas of\r\nsecurity, development and human rights are interlinked.\r\nWe should respond to these challenges accordingly.\r\nTerrorism is unacceptable under any\r\ncircumstances. States must protect and defend their\r\ncitizens against terrorist acts by all necessary means.\r\nAt the same time, Member States are under an\r\nobligation to safeguard human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms for all. In this respect, I wish to express my\r\nhope that the General Assembly will finalize a counter-\r\nterrorist strategy and conclude a comprehensive\r\nconvention on terrorism.\r\nSince the establishment of the United Nations,\r\nour world has fundamentally changed. Our civilization\r\nhas entered a new era defined by an explosion of\r\ncommunications, global trade and such other\r\ninteractions. Nevertheless, the fundamental values that\r\nmotivated the creation of the United Nations are still\r\nvalid. The core of these values is the dignity of all\r\nhuman beings. States need to find answers to the new\r\nchallenges, while maintaining the same respect for\r\nhuman dignity and fundamental rights.\r\nThe issue of the environment deserves increased\r\nattention. Let me emphasize the responsibility of the\r\ninternational community as a whole. We need a new\r\nphilosophy that takes due account of the rights of\r\nfuture generations. States must strive to maintain the\r\nlevel of environmental protection they have achieved.\r\nAlong with others, Hungary favours a more coherent\r\ninstitutional framework of international environmental\r\ngovernance, leading to the establishment of a United\r\nNations environment organization. Such an\r\norganization could best serve to protect our planet and\r\nshould act as a guardian for future generations.\r\nHungary also supports the creation of an effective\r\nUnited Nations Human Rights Council. We also highly\r\nappreciate the move to establish a Democracy Fund.\r\nI am proud to announce that an International\r\nCentre for Democratic Transition has been set up in\r\nBudapest. The Centre will promote research and offer\r\nassistance for those who seek advice. It will be an open\r\nand international institution. The Centre is the\r\ninitiative of Hungary, and we do hope that you will\r\nfind it worthy of support.\r\nBy the same token, Hungary is keen to urge\r\nfurther progress in the international promotion and\r\nprotection of minority rights by the United Nations. We\r\nwill not spare any effort to make this happen.\r\nWe need a renewed and reformed organization\r\nand must rededicate ourselves to the vision of the\r\nfounding fathers. Hungary will be a reliable partner in\r\nachieving this goal.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): The Assembly will now hear an address by\r\nHis Highness Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani,\r\nEmir of the State of Qatar.\r\nSheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani (spoke in\r\nArabic): Five years ago, in this Hall, heads of State or\r\nGovernment adopted the Millennium Declaration. It\r\nwas a historic moment, when world leaders gathered at\r\nthe turn of the century to put forth a new vision in\r\nresponse to a changing reality. It is a vision that can\r\nstrengthen the United Nations system and give it new\r\nmomentum.\r\nToday, we again meet to search for means to\r\nactivate previously concluded agreements. Allow me\r\non this occasion to congratulate Mr. Jan Eliasson on his\r\nelection to the presidency of the current session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. I wish him and this high-level\r\nmeeting every success. I would also like to thank Co-\r\nChairperson Jean Ping for steering the proceedings of\r\nthe fifty-ninth session and for his welcome contribution\r\nto the preparations for this meeting.\r\nI want to express my appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General for the great sense of responsibility\r\nhe has displayed as head of this international\r\nOrganization. I commend him for his efforts in\r\npreparing a comprehensive report on the progress made\r\nin achieving security, development and human rights\r\nfor all.\r\nThe accomplishments of the United Nations\r\nshould not be underestimated. Furthermore, the\r\nOrganization has had to contend with difficulties that\r\ncannot be ignored. While we may hold divergent views\r\nabout the outcome of its efforts, we do not question the\r\nneed for it or the imperative to support its bodies and\r\nactivities so that the international community can meet\r\nthe challenges before it.\r\nWe agree with the findings of the report of the\r\nHigh-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change.\r\nIn order to rise to the challenges of the twenty-first\r\n26\r\nA/60/PV.4\r\ncentury, we must develop a new concept of collective\r\nsecurity. This concept should allow us to define\r\nresponsibilities, design appropriate strategies and draw\r\nup roles for institutions to increase their efficiency and\r\neffectiveness.\r\nWe also agree with the proposals of the\r\nSecretary-General to accord an equal share of attention\r\nto development, security and human rights, which are\r\nthe three primary purposes of the United Nations\r\nCharter. We cannot pursue one at the expense of the\r\nother two.\r\nIt is high time that we grant development the\r\nattention it deserves. We cannot consider it to be of\r\nsecondary importance. Together with the two other\r\nobjectives of security and respect for human rights, it\r\nshould be accorded priority status. Achieving security\r\nand preserving the integrity of human rights cannot be\r\nmeaningfully pursued while vast regions of the world\r\nare deprived of the minimum requirements for life in\r\ndignity.\r\nIt is not a coincidence that the most impoverished\r\nregions are the ones suffering the most protracted\r\nconflicts, where human rights are often trampled and\r\nthreatened. While issues pertaining to security and\r\nhuman rights are among the international concerns that\r\nshould not be underestimated, development is a pivotal\r\nobjective that deserves to be given utmost importance.\r\nThe State of Qatar endorses the outcome of the\r\nMillennium Summit. We believe that the Development\r\nGoals are primary objectives that must be achieved in\r\norder to meet the challenge of extreme poverty and\r\naddress its painful repercussions, achieve gender\r\nequality, advance education and preserve the\r\nenvironment. All these basic rights are consecrated in\r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the\r\nUnited Nations Millennium Declaration.\r\nAchievement of the Millennium Development\r\nGoals implies creation of the conditions at the national\r\nand international levels required to mobilize the\r\nresources needed for that purpose. In this regard, the\r\nimplementation of the Plan of Implementation defined\r\nat the Johannesburg Summit remains the main\r\nguideline for the financing of development. The\r\nMonterrey Consensus provided the tools needed to\r\ntranslate this plan into tangible results. Together with\r\nthe Millennium Declaration, these two reference\r\ndocuments constitute an integrated plan on how the\r\nfinancing components of the development package can\r\nadvance international development efforts.\r\nDeveloping countries have already begun\r\nassuming more responsibilities by drawing up their\r\nown development strategies. However, they are still\r\nfacing a major problem, namely a lack of adequate\r\nfinancial resources to achieve the Millennium Goals\r\nand other previously agreed international goals.\r\nTherefore, it is necessary to increase the\r\nresources and the flows to at least the minimum level\r\nrequired, since developed countries have pledged to\r\nachieve those goals within a framework that allows the\r\nUnited Nations to play its role in this context.\r\nWe in the State of Qatar call for the international\r\nfinancing system to take humanitarian aspects into\r\nconsideration, in order to allow for more grants and for\r\ninitiatives that would facilitate debt reduction and an\r\nimprovement in the standard of living. We also stress\r\nthe importance of establishing an international\r\nmultilateral trade system characterized by fairness and\r\nequality for all.\r\nIn this regard, we welcome the decision taken by\r\nthe World Trade Organization, August 2004, on the full\r\nimplementation of the Doha Ministerial Declaration,\r\nparticularly where it deals with development issues.\r\nWe also stress the importance of completing the first\r\nround of the Doha multilateral trade negotiations by\r\n2006.\r\nThe development we desire calls for good\r\ngovernance based on respect for law and popular\r\nparticipation, which, in itself, will help democracy to\r\nspread and will allow for the establishment of strong\r\ninstitutions that can be held accountable and can\r\npromote sound and fair legal systems. In addition, such\r\ninstitutions would provide all the political and cultural\r\nconditions which make up an enabling environment for\r\ndevelopment. We support the reference to the\r\nestablishment of the fund for democracy in the paper\r\nsubmitted by the President of the General Assembly.\r\nWe believe that it would promote and accelerate\r\ndevelopment. We would like to declare our willingness\r\nto participate in such efforts and other popular efforts\r\nin support of democracy. We pledge 10 million dollars\r\nto support this fund for democracy in the hope that its\r\nestablishment will represent a practical step toward\r\nachieving the prosperity of peoples.\r\n27\r\nA/60/PV.4\r\nThe threats faced by the international community\r\nat present will be with us for decades, they are not\r\nstrictly related to peace and international security but\r\nderive from poverty, endemic diseases, deterioration of\r\nthe environment, armed conflicts, violence, the\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction,\r\nterrorism, transnational organized crime and the\r\ndeprivations born of not reaping the fruits of\r\ndevelopment.\r\nOur recent experiences have proved that such\r\nthreats can no longer be faced individually or\r\nunilaterally. Rather, they require  as has been seen\r\nrecently in the case of terrorism  collective efforts\r\nand close international cooperation based on the\r\nCharter of the United Nations and the provisions of\r\ninternational law. Todays world necessitates our\r\ncollective efforts in view of the interdependence\r\nbrought about by globalization.\r\nAs to the role of the United Nations, it is essential\r\nthat cooperation among its members be strengthened in\r\norder to affirm its identity as an entity that embodies\r\nhuman aspirations for peaceful coexistence and mutual\r\ninterest among nations. It is necessary to promote and\r\nstrengthen United Nations organs to make them\r\ncapable of facing present and future challenges, and to\r\nenable the Organization to deal positively with\r\nchanging realities in our world.\r\nThis High-level Plenary Meeting represents an\r\nopportunity to discuss how and by what means the role\r\nof the United Nations may be enhanced. The State of\r\nQatar, basing itself on the Charter of the United\r\nNations and the rule of international law, believes that\r\nenhancement of the role of the United Nations will\r\ndepend on the extent to which multilateral actions\r\nexpands in the face of international problems.\r\nOne of the gravest problems at present is\r\nterrorism. We believe that there is an urgent need for\r\ncollective efforts in the face of that scourge. We\r\ncondemn all forms of terrorism and are always\r\ninterested in coordinating all international efforts to\r\ncombat it, whether by joining international or regional\r\nconventions, or by providing necessary financial and\r\nhuman resources. We are ready to join the long-sought\r\ninternational convention aimed at combating terrorism,\r\nwhich we hope will be formulated multilaterally. It is\r\nimportant that this convention arrive at a definition of\r\nterrorism that will distinguish between criminal acts of\r\nterrorism and a peoples right to fight occupation\r\nmilitarily.\r\nHuman rights are governed by rules and laws that\r\nshould be applied. Recently, many organizations that\r\nwork in the field of human rights have emerged at the\r\ninternational, national and regional levels. Their work\r\nin that field is in addition to the important work\r\nconducted by the United Nations High Commissioner\r\nfor Human Rights.\r\nIn spite of various accusations levelled against\r\nthose organizations  accusations of double standards\r\nor of spreading alien concepts and focusing only on\r\npolitical and civil rights while ignoring cultural, social\r\nand economic rights  we would like to reassert that\r\nthe universality of human rights should not impair the\r\ndiversity of cultural specificities, which should be\r\ngiven due respect. All such efforts should be\r\nappreciated and respected.\r\nWe would like to express our appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General for his attention to the cause of\r\nhuman rights. He has submitted a proposal on the\r\nsubject to transform the present Commission on\r\nHuman Rights into a permanent council of limited\r\nmembership. Members of this council would be elected\r\nfrom two thirds of the membership of the General\r\nAssembly. This council would exclude countries that\r\ndo not have a good record in human rights. We support\r\nsuch a proposal. However, we are afraid that a reduced\r\ncouncil with limited membership may not be able to\r\nrepresent the large membership of the international\r\nOrganization or deal with all the different issues and\r\naspects of human rights. Therefore, we hope that this\r\nproposal will be considered and negotiated further at\r\nthe multilateral level, with a view to an agreement by\r\nGovernments that a body should be established under\r\nthe auspices of the General Assembly with a\r\nmembership that is sizeable enough to quell any\r\nsuspicion of selectivity and to guarantee its efficiency\r\nand good performance. Reform of the Security Council\r\nand expansion of its membership have become an\r\nintegral part of activating and invigorating the role of\r\nthe United Nations itself. We are, therefore, looking\r\nforward to more deliberations among the Member\r\nStates concerning the Councils functioning and its\r\nrelations with other bodies of the Organization, notably\r\nthe Economic and Social Council.\r\n28\r\nA/60/PV.4\r\nWe draw attention to the need to enhance the\r\nEconomic and Social Councils functions and provide\r\nit with the resources required to discharge its mandate.\r\nWe also support reform of the Secretariat to allow\r\nit to perform its functions and activities with\r\ntransparency. Monitoring and accountability\r\nmechanisms must be put in place to raise the\r\nprofessional competence of its international civil\r\nservants.\r\nIn this context, I believe we should continue to\r\nexamine closely the issues at hand in negotiations at\r\nthe intergovernmental level until we develop a\r\nconsensus that serves the Organizations interests.\r\nTwo years ago, the Secretary-General stated that\r\nthe United Nations stood at a crossroads between\r\nmultilateralism and unilateralism. Qatar has opted for\r\npromoting multilateralism and has lived by this choice.\r\nA case in point was the Second South Summit of the\r\nGroup of 77, held in Doha in June 2005, which\r\nreaffirmed the importance of promoting multifaceted\r\ninternational cooperation between the North and the\r\nSouth.\r\nQatar would like to stress once again its desire to\r\nbe part of the international communitys pursuit of\r\nmultilateralism. We believe that the outcome of this\r\nmeeting will help to widen the horizons of the new\r\ngenerations. We need a strong United Nations that can\r\ncelebrate its sixtieth anniversary and concomitantly\r\nwork to build a world that lives in peace and enjoys\r\nsecurity and prosperity.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): Now the General Assembly will hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Paul Biya, the President\r\nof Cameroon.\r\nPresident Biya (spoke in French): First of all,\r\nallow me to say how pleased I am that Gabon, a friend,\r\nand Sweden, whose generosity to the Third World is\r\nknown to us all, are Co-Chairpersons of this important\r\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting. I believe that this\r\nsymbolizes the essential solidarity between the\r\nindustrialized North and the developing South. This\r\nsolidarity is, I believe, an essential dimension of\r\ntomorrows world.\r\nAllow me also to have a special thought for the\r\nvictims of Hurricane Katrina, which recently struck the\r\nGulf Coast of the United States indiscriminately and\r\nwith rare violence. I wish to express to the people of\r\nAmerica and its leaders the compassion and solidarity\r\nof the people of Cameroon.\r\nThe sixtieth anniversary of the United Nations\r\nthat we are celebrating today provides us with an\r\nopportunity to assess achievements since the\r\nMillennium Declaration, which we adopted here five\r\nyears ago and which inspired immense hope at that\r\ntime. The goals that we established then are still valid.\r\nIt is indeed in the interest of all rich and poor peoples\r\nto push back poverty and pandemics and to remedy\r\nviolations of democracy and human rights, which often\r\nlead to civil war and terrorism.\r\nThe countries of the South, including my own,\r\npromptly took courageous measures to strengthen their\r\ndemocratic system and the rule of law, to improve\r\ngovernance and in particular combat corruption, and to\r\nre-establish the health of their public finances. These\r\nmeasures have sometimes had a heavy social cost.\r\nTangible results have been achieved. As far as\r\nCameroon is concerned, these efforts will continue.\r\nFor their part, our development partners, the\r\nGroup of Eight, the European Union and various\r\nfriendly countries, have recently taken measures with\r\nregard to debt and official development assistance, for\r\nwhich I sincerely thank them. This demonstration of\r\npolitical will deserves recognition, as it strengthens\r\nsolidarity, the importance of which I have just\r\nindicated.\r\nNonetheless, these measures are incomplete,\r\nparticularly measures concerning the cancellation of\r\nthe multilateral debt of 18 countries, including 14\r\nAfrican countries. I believe that we need to go further\r\nand more quickly if we wish to achieve the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals within a reasonable period of time.\r\nThis would be fair compensation for those peoples who\r\nhave invested considerable efforts for many years, even\r\nmade sacrifices, assuming responsibility for their own\r\nprogress, creating a modern society and becoming full-\r\nfledged players in their development.\r\nI call on the international financial institutions\r\nand donor countries to show understanding and to\r\narrange as soon as possible a general cancellation of\r\nthe multilateral and bilateral debt which is currently\r\ndrowning our economies.\r\nLikewise, we should step up trade talks in the\r\nDoha round so that countries of the South, particularly\r\nthose of sub-Saharan Africa, can finally play a\r\n29\r\nA/60/PV.4\r\nsignificant role in international trade. It is in the\r\ninterest of our countries, which are already suffering\r\nfrom the unequal terms of trade, that our priorities\r\nshould be better taken into account. A significant\r\ngesture is also expected from our trade partners with\r\nregard to the removal of agricultural subsidies,\r\nparticularly in favour of African cotton, which is a\r\nmajor source of income for millions of our farmers.\r\nThose of our products which are unable to compete on\r\nthe international market, particularly bananas, should\r\ncontinue to enjoy special treatment for some time. In\r\ngeneral, it is desirable that the North open further its\r\nmarkets to our products in order to allow us to play a\r\ngreater role in the globalized economy.\r\nFurthermore, I would like to recall that Cameroon\r\nand the other countries of the Congo Basin, which is\r\nthe worlds second largest forestry reserve, have taken\r\nmanagement measures that preserve a sustainable\r\nenvironment and the ecosystem. Our countries are glad\r\nto contribute in this way to improving the quality of\r\nlife on Earth. But it seems to me only fair that the\r\nconsiderable loss in revenue we have suffered should\r\nbe compensated fairly.\r\nBefore concluding, I would like to say a few\r\nwords with regard to the complex problem of United\r\nNations reform. This gives me the opportunity to\r\ncongratulate Mr. Jean Ping, President of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-ninth session, on the remarkable\r\nway in which he guided the consultations on this\r\nparticularly delicate question. It is also an opportunity\r\nfor me to express my appreciation to Secretary-General\r\nKofi Annan for the high quality and the far-reaching\r\nnature of the report he has submitted to us.\r\nFirst of all, with regard to the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council, we knew that the discussions would\r\nbe difficult. Nobody disputes the fact that the Councils\r\nmembership should reflect the shape of todays world\r\nand that it is necessary to improve its working\r\nmethods. However, it also needs to be said that the\r\npositions of various parties continue to be very\r\ndivergent.\r\nFor its part, Cameroon continues to support the\r\nposition of the African Union. It goes without saying\r\nthat, whatever solution is adopted, countries that wish\r\nto become permanent members of the Security Council\r\nmust have demonstrated firm commitment to the\r\nprinciples and decisions of the United Nations and its\r\norgans.\r\nCameroon also considers that any reform should\r\nensure proper balance among the organs of the United\r\nNations. The revitalization of the General Assembly\r\nand the strengthening of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil should be considered as priorities.\r\nI believe also that the International Court of\r\nJustice should have a central role in the institutional\r\nmachinery of our Organization. I am convinced that the\r\nsettlement of disputes or conflicts through the legal\r\nsystem continues to be the surest method of ensuring\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nClearly, implementation of any reforms will\r\nrequire considerable patience and a spirit of\r\ncompromise. I believe it is appropriate, in this context,\r\nto quote Jean Jaurès, who said, history teaches men\r\nthe difficulty of great tasks and the slow nature of\r\nachievements, but it also justifies our invincible hope.\r\nIt is my hope that all those who place their\r\nconfidence and their hopes in the United Nations \r\nand Cameroon is one of them  will be guided by an\r\nideal of solidarity and justice, and that they will do\r\neverything possible to ensure that the reform is\r\nachieved in an acceptable time frame.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): The Assembly will now hear an address by\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Olusegun Obasanjo, President of\r\nthe Federal Republic of Nigeria.\r\nPresident Obasanjo: Sir, let me begin by\r\ncongratulating Ambassador Jan Eliasson on his\r\nelection as President of the sixtieth session the General\r\nAssembly, during which vital events in the life of our\r\nOrganization will take place. As we mark the sixtieth\r\nanniversary of the founding of the United Nations, we\r\nare not only reaffirming the vision and the hope of\r\n1945, but we are also hoping to reform the\r\nOrganizations organs and its working methods so as to\r\nmake it better able to serve us in todays world, which\r\nis radically different from that of 1945.\r\nOne such difference is todays global economic\r\nlandscape, characterized by pockets of affluence and\r\nmass, abject poverty.\r\nFive years ago, at the turn of the century, we\r\nadopted the Millennium Declaration, including the\r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), which set\r\ntargets for us to address major development problems\r\nof the world, especially in developing countries. The\r\nMDGs emerged from a collective resolve to address\r\n30\r\nA/60/PV.4\r\nand build on the reinvented notion of partnership\r\nbetween the weak and the strong, between the rich and\r\nthe poor and among the peoples of the world. While\r\nthis partnership was premised on shared responsibility,\r\nit did not ignore the vital principle of common but\r\ndifferentiated obligations.\r\nIn pursuit of the MDGs and of our national\r\neconomic development objectives, Nigeria has drawn\r\nup and embarked upon conscious efforts to realize set\r\ntargets encapsulated in our National Economic\r\nEmpowerment and Development Strategy (NEEDS).\r\nNEEDS is a home-grown, people-centred medium-term\r\nstrategy designed to generate wealth, create\r\nemployment, reduce poverty and promote value\r\nreorientation. Following the implementation of\r\nNEEDS, in the past two years our agricultural\r\nproduction has grown by about 7 per cent annually.\r\nIndustrial capacity utilization has doubled, and gross\r\ndomestic product (GDP) has grown at an average of\r\nmore than 6 per cent per annum. In all other sectors,\r\nwe are making appreciable progress, even as we need\r\nmore assistance.\r\nIn spite of this progress, we recognize that\r\npoverty is still acute in our rural areas and that\r\nunemployment is still a recurring issue, particularly in\r\nour urban areas, where the youth, mostly unskilled,\r\nhave flocked. Besides, we are conscious that for a\r\ndeveloping country like Nigeria, which really wants to\r\ntransform its economy, we need an annual GDP growth\r\nof about 10 per cent. Thus, we still have a big\r\nchallenge ahead; meeting it will require increased\r\nsupport from our development partners, as well as from\r\ninvestors.\r\nIn order to attain the goals of reducing child\r\nmortality, improving maternal health and combating\r\nHIV/AIDS, Nigeria has initiated health sector reform\r\naimed at raising the standard of primary health care\r\nand vastly improving health care delivery services in\r\nour hospitals. Early this year, we launched a national\r\nhealth insurance scheme to encourage widespread and\r\ntimely resort to medical consultation, and to ensure the\r\ndelivery and development of health care, while\r\nproviding treatment of illness, as well as prenatal and\r\npostnatal care. Among other achievements, child\r\nmortality is slightly down, HIV prevalence has\r\ndeclined and the campaigns against polio and malaria\r\nare yielding results.\r\nWe consider global partnerships in the pursuit of\r\nthe MDGs to be imperative. For a developing country\r\nsuch as ours, we agree that the primary responsibility\r\nfor socio-economic development in our country rests\r\nwith us. Nevertheless, our efforts must be\r\ncomplemented by global support. We need all the\r\nassistance we can get from our development partners to\r\nmake possible the achievement of the Goals set by the\r\nAssembly five years ago.\r\nThe major problem has been inadequate\r\nresources. This is why developed countries should\r\nfulfil their own side of the Millennium Declaration, as\r\nexpressed in the targets set out in the MDGs. As\r\nclearly stated in the Millennium Project document, as\r\nwell as in the report of the Commission for Africa, it is\r\nnecessary to double the current level of resource flows\r\nto Africa if the continent is to meet the MDGs by the\r\nyear 2015.\r\nConscious of the vital role that peace and security\r\nplay in economic and social development, Nigeria\r\nconsiders conflict resolution as a vital precondition for\r\nthe successful implementation measures for attaining\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals by 2015. In this\r\nregard, Nigeria has been working tirelessly with the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States and the\r\nAfrican Union by intervening to stop conflicts and\r\ninstituting solutions to the underlying causes of\r\nconflicts.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): The Assembly will now hear an address by\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Roh Moo-hyun, President of the\r\nRepublic of Korea.\r\nPresident Roh (spoke in Korean; English text\r\nprovided by the delegation): Six decades ago, in the\r\nvery same year that far-sighted leaders from around the\r\nworld were preparing to establish the United Nations,\r\nthe Republic of Korea was set free from the shackles of\r\nimperialist colonial rule. Since then the United Nations\r\nhas been our trusted friend. I am privileged to stand at\r\nthe podium of such a special friend on this auspicious\r\noccasion.\r\nThe United Nations has made immense strides in\r\npromoting peace and universal values throughout the\r\nworld. It is perhaps one of the greatest creations of the\r\ntwentieth century, and I pause to pay tribute to all those\r\nwho have served its cause with dedication.\r\n31\r\nA/60/PV.4\r\nWe stand at a time of uncertainty as to how the\r\nglobal order will unfold, but the path we must choose\r\nremains clear. The new world order of the twenty-first\r\ncentury should be defined by all nations, be they large,\r\nsmall or medium-sized Powers, since it is in the\r\ncommon interest to achieve collective prosperity. This\r\ndemands a redoubling of efforts to advance global\r\nprojects that pursue freedom from want and\r\ndiscrimination, both of which lie at the heart of a\r\nnumber of conflicts and repressive situations.\r\nYet, there is another equally important dimension.\r\nThe world must completely divest itself of mindsets\r\nand vestiges reminiscent of imperialistic tendencies\r\nthat appear to linger in various forms. Vigilance\r\nagainst a resurgence of major-Power centrism in\r\ncertain circles is also in order. The leading nations of\r\ncontemporary international politics should be more\r\nintrospective in their examination of the past and\r\nvision of the future and should also exercise greater\r\nself-restraint.\r\nIn addition, enhanced efforts are required when it\r\ncomes to respect for neighbouring countries, forging\r\ninternational consensus and removing sources of\r\nantagonism. Not until the great Powers are able to\r\nestablish a higher cause of peace and common\r\nprosperity in the global order will the tension between\r\npower and higher cause be defused.\r\nThe promise of such endeavours can be found in\r\nthe European Union. Europe has moved beyond an\r\norder dictated by the logic of power and a system\r\nmarred by animosity and strife. It now seems to be\r\ndefining its place in the world as a community of peace\r\nand coexistence, reconciliation and cooperation. It is\r\nmy hope that North-East Asia will achieve relations\r\nakin to those we see in Europe, for this will open an\r\nentirely new chapter in the history of North-East Asia,\r\nwhich in turn will contribute to global peace and\r\nprosperity.\r\nHow we reshape the United Nations today will be\r\na harbinger of the global order of tomorrow.\r\nAccordingly, we should aspire to a community that\r\nexists to serve our common interest and respects the\r\nviews of member nations.\r\nFor instance, reform of the Security Council, a\r\nbody that is emblematic of the leadership of the United\r\nNations, should proceed in a manner that enhances its\r\nmoral authority through democracy, accountability and\r\nefficiency. Let me stress that any reform plan we arrive\r\nat should serve to facilitate harmony among nations,\r\nrather than presage another variant of great-Power\r\npolitics. The enactment of such reform should assist\r\nthe United Nations in overcoming the multiplicity of\r\nchallenges besetting humankind, thus spearheading the\r\nrealization of larger freedom.\r\nAs a nation that has been fully committed to\r\nliving up to the values championed by the United\r\nNations, the Republic of Korea is prepared to do its\r\npart in contributing to peace and prosperity throughout\r\nthe world. Korea is a nation that rose from the ashes of\r\nwar to build the worlds eleventh largest economy and\r\nto achieve significant democratic progress. It is an\r\nachievement that came about with the support of the\r\ninternational community. Consequently, it is only right\r\nthat we should reciprocate by sharing this experience\r\nwith fellow nations. We will work to undertake the full\r\nrange of our responsibilities and roles, from tackling\r\npoverty and hunger to promoting human rights and\r\nbridging the digital divide.\r\nThe Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders\r\nmeeting, scheduled for this November in Busan, Korea,\r\nshould offer a timely opportunity for us to showcase\r\nour commitment and capacity in this regard.\r\nThe Co-Chairman (Gabon) (spoke in French):\r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by His\r\nExcellency Mr. Vicente Fox, President of Mexico.\r\nPresident Fox (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of\r\nMexico, a nation of peace, democracy and freedom,\r\nand an advocate of international law and cooperation, I\r\nwish today to convey a message of optimism and\r\nconfidence in the potential and future of\r\nmultilateralism.\r\nWe created this Organization of States 60 years\r\nago. We have had achievements, but we have also had\r\nsetbacks. We have managed to prevent a nuclear\r\nconflagration, which would have been the last war in\r\nthe history of humankind, but we were unable to\r\nprevent the many other wars in which millions of\r\npersons perished.\r\nWe Members of this Organization share the\r\ncommitments, principles and values on which this\r\ncommon house was founded. Our Organization has a\r\nvery clear concept of development as a shared\r\nresponsibility, which was incorporated in the\r\nMonterrey Consensus.\r\n32\r\nA/60/PV.4\r\nOur approach to security is multidimensional and\r\nmaintains that security will not be possible for all\r\nunless we ensure socio-economic development and\r\nrespect for human rights. This is the only way in which\r\npeople can attain a larger freedom, as Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan has proposed.\r\nWe welcome the decision to establish a\r\nPeacebuilding Commission, an initiative that will\r\nenable us to face post-conflict situations and to address\r\nthe reconstruction processes. The draft outcome\r\ndocument to be adopted by this Assembly on Friday\r\nalready contains many of the elements that will pave\r\nthe way towards the comprehensive reform of our\r\nOrganization.\r\nWe have made progress. But there are still\r\npending issues that are fundamental, such as\r\ndisarmament, and non-proliferation, both horizontal\r\nand vertical, of nuclear weapons and of weapons of\r\nmass destruction. We wish to establish the best\r\npossible system of collective security and therefore we\r\nsupport a democratic reform of the Security Council\r\nthat will ensure greater representativity, transparency\r\nand true accountability, in the interest of the efficiency\r\nof the Councils work.\r\nWe must make progress in setting up the Human\r\nRights Council as a standing body to address all\r\nsituations of human rights violations and guarantee a\r\nsystem of evaluation of the performance of its\r\nmembers. We have been unable to agree upon a\r\ndefinition of terrorism that in turn would have provided\r\nus with a treaty, which we still lack. The agreements\r\nthat have been reached and the tasks that we still face\r\ncall for a clear timetable and also for specific\r\ncommitments. This will be the only way in which we\r\ncan transform our Organization into an increasingly\r\nefficient instrument in the service of peace and\r\ndevelopment. That is the demand of our people, and we\r\nmust respond to it.\r\nMexico believes in the present and in the future\r\nof the United Nations, and that is why we support the\r\nwork carried out by the Group of Friends of United\r\nNations Reform. This Group in itself constitutes a\r\nmicrocosm of the Organization, and it has harnessed\r\nthe political will and leadership of its members in order\r\nto put forward viable recommendations, including on\r\nthose issues where general consensus appears difficult\r\nto achieve. Therefore, I wish to repeat my invitation to\r\nall members to continue with renewed vigour to work\r\ntowards bringing about a true reform of the United\r\nNations. I wish to thank my friends, the heads of State\r\nor Government who are members of the Group, for\r\ntheir work and dedication.\r\nI commend The Co-Chairpersons for the work\r\ncarried out under their leadership, and I express the\r\nhope that the present reforms will be implemented. The\r\nfuture of the United Nations demands a renewed\r\ncommitment to the principles and values that inspired\r\nits creation. We must ensure that our Organization\r\nremains the best possible way of ensuring international\r\npeace, security and development, and that will require\r\nour shared commitment. It requires unity amongst\r\ndiversity, which has been, is and will continue to be,\r\nour greatest strength.\r\nHere and now, together, we can achieve this.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): The General Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Traian Basescu,\r\nPresident of Romania.\r\nPresident Basescu: I am honoured to represent\r\nRomania at this largest ever gathering of world leaders.\r\nWe came because we believe in the United Nations. We\r\ncame because we believe that it is entirely possible to\r\nreshape this Organization to serve better the needs and\r\nwishes of our peoples.\r\nRomania has now been a Member of the United\r\nNations for half a century. The United Nations has\r\nchanged a lot in the meantime, and so has Romania.\r\nWe are now part of an alliance of our choice \r\nNATO  and are bound to join formally the European\r\nUnion (EU). Equally important from here onward is\r\nhow we will be able to reach out to other nations that\r\nhave not benefited from similarly favourable\r\ncircumstances, share with them how we did it, and be\r\nof assistance to them.\r\nWe will act on development in accordance with\r\nEU policy, trying to make a difference from the\r\nstandpoint of a country with projects all over the\r\nworld. The United Nations should expect more from\r\nthis new Romania over the years to come, as it\r\nendeavours to integrate into its work the Eastern\r\nEuropeans unique experience of transition.\r\nFollowing up on our commitment at the\r\nMillennium Summit, in 2004, in close cooperation with\r\nthe United Nations agencies in Romania, we launched\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) report.\r\n33\r\nA/60/PV.4\r\nRomania is committed to achieving the set of\r\nMillennium Development Goals and targets as it\r\nadvances on the road of European integration.\r\nSecurity and regional cooperation are paramount\r\ncomponents of any assessment we may be making of\r\nUnited Nations performance and achievement. Here\r\nRomania speaks out of experience gained during its\r\ncurrent term in the Security Council.\r\nJust three days ago we commemorated the\r\nvictims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United\r\nStates. Before, during and after that date virtually all\r\nregions sustained their own terror-generated attacks;\r\nfrom London to Sharm-el-Sheikh, from Moscow to\r\nBali, no one seems to have been spared. Sadly, that is\r\nalso true of the United Nations itself. It is clear that\r\nwithout an enduring safety net there are no safe\r\nhavens. I am proud that Romania was able, together\r\nwith the 14 colleagues in the Security Council, to\r\nspearhead, as Chairman of 1540 Committee, global\r\nefforts against the worst-case security scenario, that of\r\nweapons of mass destruction (WMDs) or related\r\nmaterials and technology falling into terrorists hands.\r\nRomania has, for some time now, taken the view\r\nthat protection against security threats no longer means\r\njust making a stand at ones own border; we have to go\r\nwhere these challenges originate and take them up with\r\nresolute action and sustained investments. This is part\r\nof the rationale for Romanias joint endeavours with\r\npartners and allies in supporting stabilization and\r\nreconstruction in Iraq and Afghanistan.\r\nIn both Iraq and Afghanistan, elections are\r\ncoming about as a result of tremendous dedication and\r\nefforts of their people, first of all, and also as the result\r\nof a steadily engaged international community. All\r\nefforts made so far in the stabilization and\r\nconsolidation of freedom in post-Saddam Iraq should\r\nbe seen in the longer perspective of the Middle East\r\ndevelopment. We see the new constitution as the\r\ncornerstone of a rising Iraq.\r\nAs a country belonging both to South-Eastern\r\nEurope and the Black Sea Region, Romania seeks to\r\npromote opportunities offered by the new cooperative\r\napproaches to security. That is why we feel confident\r\nthat it will be possible for the Security Council to take\r\na step forward in acknowledging the enduring\r\nrelevance and the potential of Chapter VIII of the\r\nCharter when it takes up once again the theme of\r\nglobal and regional cooperation in the stabilization\r\nprocess under the Romanian presidency in October\r\n2005.\r\nOur ultimate aim should be to see the day when\r\nthe international community is able to deal with each\r\nand every security challenge anywhere and any time by\r\nbetter pooling existing resources and capabilities for\r\nresponding to violence.\r\nThere is a strong connection among security,\r\ndevelopment and respect for human rights, democratic\r\nvalues and good governance in everything that we are\r\nnow attempting with a view to reforming the\r\nOrganization. This essential linkage is more clearly\r\nreflected in the notion of a Peacebuilding Commission.\r\nRomania unreservedly supports the establishment of\r\nsuch a body.\r\nSix decades after the United Nations was created,\r\nbasic human rights and liberties are still infringed\r\naround the world. In Romanias own neighbourhood,\r\nthere still are separatist areas of non-law, such as\r\nTransdniestria, where people are not protected by law\r\nor principle.\r\nOften, the most affected are children, women and\r\npersons belonging to minorities. The United Nations\r\nshould not hesitate to activate available mechanisms\r\nsuited to addressing such threats and to take\r\nappropriate measures.\r\nTo conclude, Romania believes that this summit\r\nrepresents a huge political investment of trust and hope\r\non behalf of our peoples. On this agreed transition to\r\nreform, Romania is ready to embark.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): The General Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency the Right Honourable Tony\r\nBlair, MP, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of\r\nGreat Britain and Northern Ireland.\r\nMr. Blair (United Kingdom): The United Nations\r\nmust come of age. It must become the visible and\r\ncredible expression of the globalization of politics. The\r\nmodern world insists that we be dependent on each\r\nother: we work with each other or we suffer in\r\nisolation.\r\nThe principles of the United Nations have always\r\nhad a moral force. Today, they receive the sharper\r\nimpulse of self-interest. The terrorist attacks in Britain\r\non 7 July 2005 have their origins in an ideology born\r\nthousands of miles from our shores. The proliferation\r\n34\r\nA/60/PV.4\r\nof nuclear, chemical and biological weapons will never\r\nbe halted outside of an international consensus to do\r\nso.\r\nFailed States, as we know to our cost, fail us all.\r\nFor the protection of the environment, the promotion of\r\ninternational trade, we can do nothing without effective\r\naction together.\r\nWhen we look with revulsion, as we should, at\r\nthe misery of the millions who die in Africa and\r\nelsewhere through preventable famine, disease and\r\nconflict, the urgency to act is driven not just by\r\nconscience but by an inner sense that one day, if we\r\nrefuse to act, we will reap a dire reward for our refusal.\r\nWhat is more, humanity today is confident of the\r\nvalues it shares. Give people the chance and they will\r\nalways vote for freedom, always prefer tolerance to\r\nprejudice, never willingly accept the suppression of\r\nhuman rights and governance by extremism.\r\nSo the challenge is clear. The values are clear.\r\nThe self-interest in upholding them together is also\r\nclear.\r\nWhat must now be clear is that the United\r\nNations can be the instrument of achieving the global\r\nwill of the people. It must give leadership on terrorism.\r\nThere is not and never can be any justification, any\r\nexcuse, any cause that accepts the random slaughter of\r\nthe innocent. Wherever it happens, whoever is\r\nresponsible, we stand united in condemnation.\r\nThe United Nations must strengthen its policy on\r\nnon-proliferation, in particular on how to allow nations\r\nto develop civil nuclear power, but not nuclear\r\nweapons.\r\nThe new Human Rights Council must earn the\r\nworlds respect and not its contempt. The\r\nPeacebuilding Commission must become the means of\r\nrenewing nations, where war and the collapse of proper\r\nsystems of government have left them ravaged and\r\ntheir people desolate.\r\nFor the first time, at this summit, we are agreed\r\nthat States do not have the right to do what they will\r\nwithin their own borders, but that we, in the name of\r\nhumanity, have a common duty to protect people where\r\ntheir own Governments will not.\r\nAnd finally, stalking this summit like a spectre\r\nare the Millennium Development Goals. The struggle\r\nagainst global poverty will define our moral standing\r\nin the eyes of the future. The Group of Eight, meeting\r\nin Scotland, showed how we redeem our pledge.\r\nI have heard people describe the outcomes of this\r\nUnited Nations summit as modest. And no summit\r\nrequiring unanimity from 191 nations can be more than\r\nmodest. But if we did what we have agreed  on\r\ndoubling aid, on opening up trade, on debt relief, on\r\nHIV/AIDS and malaria, on conflict prevention so that\r\nnever again would the world stand by helpless when\r\ngenocide struck  if we fulfilled our undertakings at\r\nthis summit, our modesty would surprise. There would\r\nbe more democracy, less oppression; more freedom,\r\nless terrorism; more growth, less poverty. The effects\r\nwould be measured in the lives of millions of people\r\nwho will never hear these speeches or read our\r\nstatements. But it would, I suggest, be the proper\r\nvocation of political leadership, and the United Nations\r\nwould live up to its name.\r\nSo we should do it.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): The General Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Jan Peter Balkenende,\r\nPrime Minister of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.\r\nMr. Balkenende (Netherlands): We are capable\r\nof sending spaceships to faraway planets in search of\r\nlife. But are we sufficiently smart and determined to\r\nsave the lives of innocent children on our own planet?\r\nWe live in a world where HIV/AIDS undermines\r\nentire societies. We have the knowledge and the\r\nresources to do something about it. But do we also\r\nhave the political will?\r\nWe live in a world where the prospect of\r\ndevastating climate change confronts us all. The recent\r\nfloods in the heartland of Europe, in China and, of\r\ncourse, in this very country, might be seen as clear\r\nwarnings. One third of my country, the Netherlands,\r\nlies below sea level. We can raise our dykes. But is it\r\nnot high time for us to work together on a real\r\nsolution?\r\nWe live in an age when our shared values, such as\r\nfreedom, justice and respect for all, are under attack by\r\nterrorists. Will we be able to overcome the boundaries\r\nthat divide us in the fight against violence and terror?\r\nPoverty, disease, pollution, terrorism and\r\nviolence have a worldwide impact; and they are all\r\ninterconnected. Let us not make the mistake of\r\n35\r\nA/60/PV.4\r\nthinking that if threats are far away they are not our\r\nbusiness. Such threats can set off a global chain\r\nreaction that will affect us all. All of us are equally\r\nvulnerable. Only if we are united can we transform our\r\nworld for the better. Together, we are responsible for\r\ntaking action.\r\nIn 2000, we promised the world that we would\r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).\r\nNow the time has come to fulfil that promise.\r\nAs political leaders we must have the courage to\r\nchoose a model for international partnership that does\r\njustice to the tasks confronting us. We need an\r\neffective, multilateral system with clear commitments\r\nand rules, and strong institutions. That alone will give\r\nus the chance to make the world more secure, just and\r\nhumane.\r\nRather than pretending that the United Nations is\r\nsome entity distinct from us Member States, we should\r\nacknowledge that the Organization is us and that\r\ntogether we determine whether or not it is an effective\r\ntool. If we do not want the United Nations to be a lame\r\nduck, we must dare to give it the wings to fly.\r\nMultilateralism works. Whenever we join forces,\r\nwe help people to live their lives in dignity, freedom\r\nand peace. I applaud the efforts made so far in the run-\r\nup to this summit. In many respects, the outcome\r\ndocument presented to us today presents much needed\r\nprogress. In other areas, however, we clearly must be\r\nmore ambitious.\r\nWe welcome the establishment of the\r\nPeacebuilding Commission to deal with conflicts in a\r\nmore structural way. Also, I applaud our readiness to\r\naddress deficiencies in the management of this\r\nOrganization. We are equally pleased with the\r\nreaffirmed ambitions on development cooperation.\r\nWe welcome the recognition in the document of\r\nthe important contribution of the private sector and\r\ncivil society to our common objectives. Public-private\r\npartnerships are an effective and indispensable tool in\r\ncombating poverty. Let us put these lofty principles\r\ninto practice. We can do it. Together with the private\r\nsector, for example, the Netherlands and Ghana will\r\ntake up an idea of the Hunger Task Force to support a\r\nschool feeding programme that will increase school\r\nenrolment, reduce hunger and strengthen the local\r\neconomy. Examples such as this one show that it is\r\npossible to bring the MDGs within reach.\r\nNevertheless, we can and should do more to\r\nenhance our capacity to deal with human rights\r\nviolations. The Human Rights Council should be up\r\nand running by early 2006. We need to take the\r\nappropriate steps to make the Council a truly effective\r\ntool to promote and protect human rights.\r\nEqually pressing is the need to enhance the\r\ncredibility of the multilateral mechanisms in the field\r\nof non-proliferation. The documents deafening silence\r\non this issue undermines the credibility of the United\r\nNations.\r\nNo country in the world  no matter how\r\npowerful  can achieve these results alone. We must\r\ndo it together. The key question is: are we able to\r\ncombat poverty, disease, environmental degradation,\r\nterrorism and violence?\r\nThe answer is: yes, we are. So now, let us act. It\r\nis time to deliver, for the sake of our children and\r\ngrandchildren.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): The Assembly will now hear an address by\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Owen Seymour Arthur, Member of\r\nParliament, Prime Minister and Minister for Finance\r\nand Economic Affairs of Barbados.\r\nMr. Arthur (Barbados): Today we gather, as a\r\nfamily of nations, to take stock of the progress that has\r\nbeen made in fulfilling the commitment that was given\r\nas part of our celebration of the start of a new century,\r\nto bring about a dramatic improvement in the human\r\ncondition everywhere.\r\nIt is important that this meeting does not become\r\njust a theatre of the absurd, an occasion for expressing\r\nanger at what has not been achieved and for giving new\r\ncommitments that we know we will not honour. It is\r\ntime that we began to hold some common ground and\r\nuse it as a beachhead from which to launch our drive\r\nfor progress.\r\nAlmost exactly one year ago, Hurricane Ivan\r\ndevastated Grenadian society. Today the United States\r\nof America is coming to terms with the enormity of the\r\ndestruction inflicted on its southern states by Hurricane\r\nKatrina.\r\nIt is therefore highly significant that in a world\r\nwhere we talk about developed and developing, the\r\nundiscriminating forces of nature render us all equal\r\nand point to our common fragility and humanity.\r\n36\r\nA/60/PV.4\r\nThese recent events have thereby highlighted our\r\ninterdependence, reinforced the need for sustained and\r\neffective international cooperation and have placed\r\nbefore us, forcibly, the need to carry out a programme\r\nfor global development to stop poor people from being\r\npoor, no matter where they live.\r\nThey also highlight the unnecessary and\r\nunsavoury dilemma that we have imposed on\r\nourselves, because with todays technology, financial\r\nresources and accumulated knowledge, humanity has\r\nthe capacity to overcome extreme deprivation. Yet, the\r\ninternational community allows poverty to destroy\r\nlives on a scale before which the impact of all of the\r\nworlds natural disasters pales into insignificance.\r\nIt is unconscionable that we should have to\r\ncontinue to live in a world that consists of a permanent\r\ncoalition of unequals  the fabulously rich and the\r\ndesperately poor. It is especially unacceptable that the\r\nprincipal agents of international cooperation  trade\r\nand aid  should be used as instruments to perpetuate\r\nunderdevelopment. The world can do better. The issues\r\nat the core of global development have nothing to do\r\nwith means; they have to do with morality. We feel that\r\nthis occasion should be one not only for recommitment\r\nto the goals set out in the Millennium Declaration, as\r\nnarrowly defined, but also for a new commitment to a\r\nprocess of compassionate global development that\r\ndraws upon the best values known to humanity.\r\nFive years ago, Barbados wholeheartedly adopted\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which\r\ngave expression to the substance of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration. We accepted those goals not as new\r\ninternational tests to be passed, but as an inspiration to\r\nreach for higher social and economic heights.\r\nWe therefore propose not just to meet the Goals,\r\nbut to exceed them. To that end, we have woven them\r\ninto our national strategic plan for the next 20 years.\r\nWe, however, entertain no illusions about the difficulty\r\nwe will experience in meeting these Goals.\r\nThough small, our nation has attained a human\r\ndevelopment index that puts us ahead of countries in\r\nthe European Union. The price we have had to pay for\r\nthis is to have access to aid and development finance\r\ndenied to us at an early stage in our development. We\r\nare therefore largely on our own as the financier of our\r\ndevelopment programmes. At the same time, we can no\r\nlonger plan our national development on the\r\nexpectations of enjoying preferential access to the\r\nmarkets of the world.\r\nThis double-edged challenge posed by the\r\nreduction in our access to financial resources and the\r\ndemands of trade liberalization has drastically\r\ntransformed the environment within which our national\r\ndevelopment takes place. It, however, does not deter us\r\nfrom believing that we can attain full development;\r\nrather it causes us to look to new means and devices by\r\nwhich that full development can be attained.\r\nSimilarly, we believe that the state of the global\r\nsociety requires us to look to new means by which\r\nglobal economic and social progress can be attained.\r\nIn that regard, permit me to suggest that the\r\nMDGs will only be achieved if the eighth Millennium\r\nGoal of a global partnership for development is fully\r\naddressed. Barbados believes that it is vitally important\r\nfor this High-level Plenary Meeting to be used by\r\nheads of State or Government to reaffirm commitment\r\nto the global partnership for development in the\r\nMillennium Declaration, the Monterrey Consensus and\r\nthe Johannesburg Plan of Implementation. This calls\r\nfor increased and more predictable resources; a\r\ncomprehensive, sustainable and development-oriented\r\nsolution to the debt problem; the promotion of a\r\nuniversal, open and fair multilateral trading system and\r\na global governance system that not only allows for the\r\nfull and effective participation of developing countries\r\nin international economic decision-making, but also\r\nmanages world economies in a manner that would\r\ndistribute more equitably the worlds resources.\r\nAnything less will find us wanting by 2015.\r\nThe Barbados economy is now largely a coastal\r\neconomy. Like many other small island developing\r\nStates, Barbados faces a high degree of vulnerability\r\noccasioned by climate change, climate variability and\r\nother phenomena such as the increased frequency and\r\nintensity of natural disasters.\r\nThe Mauritius Strategy for the Further\r\nImplementation of the Barbados Programme of Action\r\nclearly identifies the key areas that need to be\r\naddressed to help such small island developing States\r\nrespond to these and other sustainable development\r\nchallenges. The compassionate development of which I\r\nspoke earlier requires that our development partners\r\nassist small island developing States in getting easier\r\nand more effective access to the financial resources and\r\n37\r\nA/60/PV.4\r\nappropriate technologies needed as well as assistance\r\nin developing human and institutional capacity.\r\nThe Government and the people of Barbados\r\nhave a vision to transform Barbados into a fully\r\ndeveloped country; a model democracy that is\r\nprosperous, productive, peaceful, socially just and\r\ninclusive; a centre for high-quality services whose\r\nstandards of excellence are global but at the same time\r\nrooted in our best traditions. We have made substantial\r\nprogress in each of these spheres. Throughout this\r\nendeavour we will count on the solidarity of like-\r\nminded alliances, and we have the fullest hope in the\r\nshared responsibility of multilateralism, of which this\r\nOrganization, the United Nations, must be the core.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): The General Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Bertie Ahern, TD,\r\nPrime Minister of Ireland.\r\nMr. Ahern (Ireland): Irelands support for the\r\nUnited Nations is unwavering. We have always placed\r\nthe United Nations at the very centre of our foreign\r\npolicy. Many Irish soldiers have served under the blue\r\nflag, and many have sacrificed their lives in that noble\r\nservice.\r\nThe United Nations is, and will remain,\r\nfundamental to the pursuit of global justice, prosperity\r\nand security. Yet all of us here know that the United\r\nNations must change. Of course, its failures are mainly\r\nthe result of our failures. Too often in recent years, we\r\nhave not mustered the will and resources  the\r\ncourage  to match the determination of the founders\r\nof the United Nations to save succeeding generations\r\nfrom the scourge of war.\r\nThe many successes of the United Nations make\r\nour failures  failures which have at times been\r\ncatastrophic  all the more inexcusable. That is why\r\nwhat we have agreed is so important. It does not\r\nachieve all that Ireland and many others would have\r\nhoped for. I regret that the Secretary-Generals\r\nambitious vision has not yet been fully realized. But\r\nsignificant progress has been achieved in several areas,\r\nand we have established a demanding agenda for the\r\nfuture.\r\nReform must continue, and change must happen.\r\nThe realities of our world demand it.\r\nGlobalization has brought enormous benefits.\r\nMore people have been lifted out of extreme poverty in\r\nthe past decade than at any time since the United\r\nNations was founded. But globalization also has its\r\ndark side. We see the spread of deadly infectious\r\ndiseases. We see terrorists and organized criminals\r\nexploiting a more open world. And along with\r\neconomic growth have come environmental\r\ndegradation and climate change.\r\nAnd globalization has left over 2 billion people\r\nbehind: people who bear the brunt of conflict, of\r\ndisease, of grinding poverty.\r\nThe links among development, security and\r\nhuman rights are clear and inescapable. It is no\r\ncoincidence that many of the countries furthest from\r\nreaching the Millennium Development Goals are those\r\nmost affected by conflict and by the abuse of human\r\nrights.\r\nWe live in a world where the clear distinction\r\nbetween conflict among States and conflict within\r\nStates has become blurred. Recently, threats to peace\r\nhave arisen mainly from internal strife, and those\r\nthreats, as we have seen to our cost, do not stop at\r\nnational borders.\r\nWe are all sovereign States, with sovereign rights\r\nand responsibilities. But where those responsibilities\r\nare not exercised to protect citizens from gross abuses\r\nor genocide, others must assume them through the\r\nUnited Nations, including, if all else fails, by military\r\nforce. We have rightly committed ourselves never to\r\nallow events such as those that took place in Rwanda\r\nand Srebrenica to happen again.\r\nWhere countries have, with our help, taken the\r\nfirst steps out of conflict, we cannot leave them on\r\ntheir own. I welcome therefore the agreement to\r\nestablish a Peacebuilding Commission and to have it\r\nup and running by the end of this year.\r\nWe must intensify our common efforts to deal\r\nwith terrorism and move quickly to conclude a\r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism.\r\nThe Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons is of special importance to Ireland as its first\r\nsignatory. The Treatys twin goals of disarmament and\r\nnon-proliferation reinforce each other. I deeply regret\r\nthe failure to make any progress on this occasion.\r\nHowever, Ireland will continue working to strengthen\r\nthe Treaty.\r\n38\r\nA/60/PV.4\r\nLet us quickly make a reality of the new Human\r\nRights Council. We will work to make it fully effective\r\nin the promotion and protection of human rights.\r\nThe United Nations must become more efficient.\r\nIts Secretariat, agencies and staff must be fully\r\naccountable. The Secretary-General has to have the\r\nauthority and flexibility to manage the Organization\r\nand to devote resources to where they are most needed.\r\nIt is not fair to deny him this and then to blame him\r\nwhen things go wrong.\r\nIt is an affront to our common humanity, five\r\nyears after the Millennium Summit, that 30,000\r\nchildren die each day from easily preventable diseases,\r\nor that 100 million people go to bed hungry, or that 100\r\nmillion children are not receiving a basic education.\r\nIreland is not a silent witness to this continuing\r\ntragedy. Over the past five years, my Government has\r\nmore than doubled Irelands official development\r\nassistance (ODA)  from 254 million to\r\n545 million. Indeed, since coming into office my\r\nGovernment has tripled ODA.\r\nToday I commit Ireland to reaching the United\r\nNations target of 0.7 per cent. This will be achieved by\r\n2012, three years earlier than the agreed European\r\nUnion target date of 2015. Given current economic\r\nprojections, this will mean a tripling of Irelands ODA\r\nabove current levels. Our commitment is demanding\r\nbut achievable. And it will be achieved.\r\nAs the first milestone on the way to reaching the\r\nUnited Nations target, I commit the Government to\r\nsignificantly increasing our official development\r\nassistance in the next two years in order to reach an\r\ninterim target of 0.5 per cent of our GNP in 2007. This\r\nmeans that we will spend 658 million next year and\r\n773 million on official development assistance in\r\n2007.\r\nQuantity is important, but so also is quality.\r\nIreland is one of the very few donors all of whose aid\r\nis untied. Our aid will remain untied. Our aid is\r\neffective aid.\r\nThe new money will support new activities.\r\nFirst, next year, Ireland will double its spending\r\non the fight against HIV/AIDS to 100 million. This\r\nbuilds on the commitment I gave here in 2001 to put\r\nthe battle against HIV/AIDS at the very centre of our\r\nprogramme.\r\nSecondly, the new resources will allow Ireland to\r\nrespond more quickly and effectively to major\r\nhumanitarian emergencies. We will work in partnership\r\nwith the United Nations and non-governmental\r\norganizations to bring relief to victims and to tackle the\r\nroot causes of hunger.\r\nThirdly, we will support the United Nations in\r\ncreating the new fund to promote democratic values\r\nthroughout the world. People want to help but they\r\nwant to be sure their money is being properly used. To\r\nensure that public support for aid remains strong, we\r\nmust work with developing countries to improve\r\ngovernance, promote human rights, increase\r\ntransparency and stamp out corruption.\r\nAnd, finally, we know from our own experience\r\nthat reducing poverty needs strong economic growth\r\nand a vibrant private sector. We will work together\r\nwith Irish industry and partner companies in Africa to\r\npromote trade, investment and technology transfer.\r\nBy committing to the 0.7 per cent target, Ireland\r\nwill spend up to 8 billion on helping to tackle poverty\r\nand alleviate poverty in some of the worlds poorest\r\ncountries. By any standards this is a huge commitment\r\non behalf of the Irish people, but I know that they, and\r\nespecially the young people, will welcome it.\r\nGathered here, we have pledged to take action to\r\nmake the world more secure and more just. Now we\r\nmust follow through. We have taken a step forward, but\r\nthere is a long road still to travel.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in French):\r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by His\r\nExcellency The Honourable Winston Baldwin Spencer,\r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nAntigua and Barbuda.\r\nMr. Spencer (Antigua and Barbuda): Exactly\r\nfour years ago this past Sunday the 9/11 terrorist attack\r\non America united the world in horror and in\r\ncompassion. Today this sixtieth session of the General\r\nAssembly is taking place in a nation again traumatized.\r\nOur hearts go out to those unfortunate Americans and\r\ncitizens of other countries who lost everything,\r\nincluding loved ones, in the devastation that Hurricane\r\nKatrina has wrought.\r\nFortunately for Katrinas surviving victims, a\r\nsilver lining has broken through the dark clouds of the\r\nGulf Coast disaster. Sadly, the underprivileged in poor\r\ncountries have no hope for any silver lining to brighten\r\n39\r\nA/60/PV.4\r\ntheir permanently bleak existence. Adversity is the\r\ndominant feature of their existence and their\r\nexpectations.\r\nThere could be a silver lining for that global\r\nunderclass. This would happen if the riveting television\r\nimages of the ongoing agony of Katrinas victims could\r\nignite among all nations and among all peoples the\r\nrecognition that we all share the duty to be our\r\nbrothers keepers.\r\nIt would be to the immeasurable good of\r\nhumankind if members of this family of nations\r\nassembled for this High-level Plenary Meeting could\r\nembrace this shared responsibility. It should also\r\nunderline the imperative for comprehensive United\r\nNations reform that would make this Organization\r\nmore responsive  and more timely in its response \r\nto the vulnerabilities of, and pervasive threats to the\r\npoor in its smaller, developing Member States.\r\nShould we fail to respond in this fashion, we\r\nwould condemn ourselves to historys verdict that\r\nwhen called upon we would all be guilty of failing\r\nhumanity. That is a charge that we must not permit\r\nhistory to levy against us.\r\nAntigua and Barbuda is a small, twin-island\r\nnation of approximately 85,000 people. An estimated\r\nthirty-five percent of our population is immigrant, the\r\nvast majority of non-natives being from sister\r\nCaribbean countries to whom we opened our borders\r\nwhen they faced economic distress and natural\r\ndisasters.\r\nIn consequence of this, social and economic\r\ndevelopment is increasingly challenging for a\r\ndeveloping nation shouldering a debt burden out of all\r\nproportion to our economic capacities.\r\nWe recognize, nonetheless, that we live in a\r\nglobal and interdependent world, in which no State can\r\nstand alone. The current crippling impact of\r\ncontinually rising energy costs on our fragile\r\neconomies is a current case in point. Venezuelas offer\r\nof stable fuel supplies on concessionary terms through\r\nthe PetroCaribe Initiative is therefore a timely and\r\nwelcome intervention for member countries of the\r\nCaribbean Community.\r\nThese and other issues highlight the need for the\r\nexpansion of the partnership between developed and\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nMeeting the agreed official development\r\nassistance target of 0.7 per cent of GNP, including\r\nwithin the context of the Mauritius Strategy, must be\r\naddressed if small States are to devise strategic\r\ninfrastructural mechanisms for sustainable\r\ndevelopment and competitiveness.\r\nAntigua and Barbuda, like other members of the\r\nOrganization of Eastern Caribbean States, has limited\r\noptions for trade in a globalized world. We lack the\r\nfactors required for a viable manufacturing base. Our\r\nprincipal economic options are tourism and financial\r\nservices, and in the case of Antigua and Barbuda,\r\nInternet gaming.\r\nIt is thus not difficult to grasp Antigua and\r\nBarbudas compelling need to seek World Trade\r\nOrganization intervention in the dispute with the\r\nUnited States of America regarding Internet gaming.\r\nInternet gaming is one of the limited available options\r\nthrough which Antigua and Barbuda, as a small\r\ndeveloping State, can bridge the digital divide and use\r\ninformation and communications technology as an\r\ninstrument of economic development.\r\nRendering Antigua and Barbuda poorer by\r\nunlawfully denying market access to Internet gaming\r\nwill not make the United States richer. Forgiving the\r\ndisproportionate debt that continues to cripple\r\ndeveloping economies will not make creditor countries\r\npoor. Deporting hardened convicted felons to\r\nvulnerable Caribbean societies will not make America\r\nor any OECD country safer. Enabling developing\r\nnations to access vitally needed pharmaceuticals at\r\nrates reasonably close to the cost of production will not\r\nput transnational drug companies out of business.\r\nLast October, just seven months after our election\r\nto our first term of office, the Government of Antigua\r\nand Barbuda enacted an unprecedented trilogy of\r\nintegrity legislation, comprising an Integrity in Public\r\nLife Act, a Prevention of Corruption Act and a\r\nFreedom of Information Act. We are convinced that\r\ntransparency, accountability and integrity in\r\ngovernment are fundamental to economic and social\r\ndevelopment.\r\nWithout prompt solutions to the debt obligations\r\nof small and vulnerable economies, the targeted\r\neradication of poverty will remain an elusive\r\nMillennium Development Goal. A reformed United\r\nNations system must, therefore, devise special\r\n40\r\nA/60/PV.4\r\nmechanisms to reduce the debt burdens of low and\r\nmiddle-income countries.\r\nAn area of immediate potential for small States\r\nwould be assistance from the international community\r\nin capacity-building in information and\r\ncommunications technology.\r\nAs small-island developing countries of the\r\nOrganization of Eastern Caribbean States, Antigua and\r\nBarbuda and our immediate neighbouring islands face\r\nthe challenges of very limited land space, fragile\r\necosystems, and vulnerability to natural disasters and\r\nthe effects of climate change.\r\nCompounding these challenges is our heavy\r\ndependence on the natural environment to support our\r\ntourism industry, the lifeblood of the economies of our\r\nnations.\r\nThreats to our natural environment are therefore\r\nthreats to our very existence. We contribute the least to\r\nthe causes of climate change, yet we suffer the most\r\nfrom its effects.\r\nThe devastation wrought by the increased\r\nintensity of hurricanes can set back our development\r\nefforts by decades, and has indeed done so.\r\nAs we continue to invest in development of our\r\nhuman capital, HIV/AIDS continues to eat away at\r\nthose investments. We need the cooperation of our\r\ninternational partners to gain access to health-care\r\nresources.\r\nA reformed United Nations system must be\r\nempowered with the necessary financial and technical\r\nresources to assist its Member States in the fight\r\nagainst the spread of HIV/AIDS, the distribution of\r\nanti-retroviral drugs and the necessary resources for\r\nprevention programmes.\r\nThe United Nations plays a crucial role in\r\ninternational peace and security. Its reform is\r\nunavoidable in order to meet todays global challenges.\r\nAntigua and Barbuda fully believes that in order\r\nto respond to global threats and challenges, United\r\nNations reform must be multifaceted. It must be\r\nachieved through a process of democratic deliberations\r\ndesigned to achieve a consensus.\r\nReforms must take into consideration the goals of\r\ndeveloping countries, which make up two thirds of its\r\nmembership.\r\nIt is my countrys hope that the 60th session of\r\nthe General Assembly will achieve reform through\r\nunity and in the long-term interest of the membership\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nI trust that these reflections will remind all\r\nnations in whose names this High-level Plenary\r\nMeeting was convened that among these United\r\nNations the obligation falls to the bigger brother States\r\nto be their smaller brothers keepers.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): The Assembly will now hear an address by\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, Prime\r\nMinister of Malaysia.\r\nMr. Badawi: Sixty years ago, the founders of the\r\nUnited Nations pledged in writing that this\r\nOrganization should save succeeding generations from\r\nthe scourge of war, reaffirm the dignity of the human\r\nperson, uphold international law and promote social\r\nprogress and better standards of life in larger freedom.\r\nIndeed, much has been achieved but much, but\r\nmuch more remains to be done. Why are we continuing\r\nto witness many wars in our times? Why do we\r\ncontinue to see human rights trampled with impunity?\r\nWhy do States continue to commit serious breaches of\r\ninternational law? Why are hundreds of millions of\r\npeople still living in poverty and indignity?\r\nYet our best hopes still lie with this Organization.\r\nLet us therefore write another solemn pledge on this\r\noccasion, to put forth honest efforts and to take the\r\nnecessary steps to reform the United Nations so that it\r\ncan truly serve the purposes for which it was intended.\r\nMalaysia holds the view that the most\r\nfundamental objective to be achieved in any reform\r\nand renewal of the United Nations system must be the\r\nprotection and enhancement of multilateralism.\r\nI am aware of the growing consensus towards\r\naccepting that the existing provisions of the United\r\nNations Charter regarding the use of force are\r\nsufficient to address the full range of security threats;\r\nthat the only issue remaining is how to ensure that the\r\nuse of force is applied only as an instrument of last\r\nresort.\r\nHowever, any intervention must give due\r\nrecognition to Charter principles pertaining to\r\nsovereignty, territorial integrity and non-interference.\r\n41\r\nA/60/PV.4\r\nWhile the Security Council would appropriately\r\nbe the body to take decisions on these matters, it is\r\nMalaysias view that provision must also be made for\r\nthe General Assembly to have an oversight role in this\r\ncritical matter of the use of force to deal with threats to\r\ninternational security.\r\nMalaysia is convinced that an effective\r\nmultilateral system, centred upon an appropriately\r\nempowered General Assembly, is our best guarantee\r\nagainst the exercise of absolute power or disregard for\r\ninternational law.\r\nWe note that here is also a growing consensus to\r\naccept the justifiability of the use of force to protect\r\ncivilian populations from crimes against humanity,\r\nsuch as genocide and ethnic cleansing. I should like to\r\nsay that it is equally a crime against humanity to allow\r\npoverty and deprivation to persist in these modern\r\ntimes. How can we continue to stand by while eight\r\nmillion people around the world die each year because\r\nthey are too poor to stay alive?\r\nThere are over one billion people  that is, one\r\nin every six people around the world  who live in\r\nextreme poverty, subsisting on less than one dollar per\r\nday.\r\nPoverty has deprived more than 100 million\r\nchildren of the opportunity of going to primary school.\r\nIn this connection, a high premium must be\r\nplaced on providing educational opportunities and on\r\nthe capability of people to have access to education.\r\nEducation and the power of knowledge are the greatest\r\nequalizer among individuals in a society and the\r\ngreatest leveller that can bridge the prosperity gap\r\namong the nation States in this globalized world.\r\nThe United Nations is best placed to play the lead\r\nrole in embarking upon a capacity-building programme\r\nspecifically earmarked to eradicate poverty. We should\r\nnever renege on our commitments to achieve the\r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nI come now to my final point, which is why we\r\nneed effective multilateralism in order to fight\r\nterrorism successfully in all its forms and\r\nmanifestations.\r\nFirst and foremost, terrorism must be condemned.\r\nHowever, the global scope of the fight against\r\nterrorism requires the widest possible collaboration\r\namong all countries. It is only the United Nations that\r\ncan galvanize such a huge undertaking.\r\nWe must know the motives of terrorists in order\r\nto identify the root causes of their actions. These could\r\nbe political injustice, the denial of human rights, a\r\nbrutish life entrenched in pervasive poverty or\r\nsomething else yet to be uncovered.\r\nWe must take action to address the root causes so\r\nas to render their motivations irrelevant. It is possible\r\nto disrupt, capture or kill individual terrorists.\r\nHowever, unless the root causes are addressed and\r\nremoved, new recruits will take the place of leaders\r\nand groups killed or destroyed in the fight against\r\nterrorism. Terrorists deserve neither compassion nor\r\nsympathy. But we do need to know their minds and\r\ntheir mentality.\r\nWe must also maintain a distinction between acts\r\nof terrorism and the right of peoples fighting for self-\r\ndetermination. It is equally unjustifiable to associate\r\nterrorism with any particular race or religion. Terrorists\r\nmust be singled out only by their acts of terror and\r\nnothing else.\r\nLet me briefly refer to the Outcome Document\r\nbefore us, which we all know is a text that has finally\r\nemerged after many stages of painstaking negotiations.\r\nUndoubtedly, the language and content of the\r\ndocument reflect many degrees of compromises. This\r\nmeans that no one is fully satisfied.\r\nCertainly, many issues remain unresolved. Quite\r\nclearly, therefore, we have much unfinished business\r\non our hands in the months and years to come.\r\nWe have really no choice but to make the United\r\nNations relevant for now and for the future. The causes\r\nof future conflicts may come from a complex mix of\r\npolitical, economic and strategic reasons. The quests\r\nfor prosperity and security may very well intersect. We\r\nmust reform the United Nations to make it competent\r\nto address the interrelated and cross-cutting issues, and\r\nsucceed in preventing future conflicts. In settling\r\nconflicts, we want to use the United Nations, but a\r\nUnited Nations that is abused is of no use.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): The General Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Gerard Latortue, Prime\r\nMinister of the Republic of Haiti.\r\n42\r\nA/60/PV.4\r\nMr. Latortue (Haiti) (spoke in French): It is a\r\npleasure for me to take the floor at this summit and to\r\nshare with you the concerns and the wishes of the\r\nHaitian people on the issues being debated in this Hall.\r\nI should like to take this opportunity to congratulate\r\nthe Secretary-General and his team for this excellent\r\ninitiative, without which the Millennium Development\r\nGoals might well have remained no more than pious\r\nhopes.\r\nOn behalf of the people of Haiti, I should like to\r\nthank the brother countries of Latin America, Europe,\r\nthe Middle East, Asia and Africa, who have dispatched\r\ntroops as part of the United Nations military and police\r\ncontingents that are successfully contributing to\r\nrestoring peace, stability and security in my country.\r\nThese are essential prerequisites for holding the free\r\nand democratic elections that are planned for the end of\r\nthis year.\r\nI wish above all this evening to dwell on the\r\nreform of the structures of this universal Organization\r\nand the essential review of the mechanisms for\r\nformulating and evaluating cooperation projects, and\r\nalso for coordinating international development\r\nassistance.\r\nLet us begin with the Security Council. Haiti\r\ncontinues to support the enlargement of this organ\r\nthrough the admission of new permanent members to\r\nensure a more just and more balanced representation\r\nmore in line with the realities of todays world. The\r\nPresident of Senegal said earlier that if we do not reach\r\nan agreement on a formula, then perhaps we should\r\nrepair the historic injustice by giving a position to\r\nAfrica. I support his position, but I should like to add\r\nthat there has been a dual historic injustice in respect\r\nof Latin America and the Caribbean countries, which\r\nlikewise are not represented in the Security Council\r\nwith a permanent seat. I should also like to express my\r\ndeep conviction that the selection criteria for the new\r\nmembers should not be just their economic, financial\r\nor military power. I believe that any country that\r\nobserves the rules of good governance, respects human\r\nrights and ensures free elections should also be eligible\r\nfor a permanent seat on the Security Council.\r\nWith regard to the General Assembly, I believe\r\nthat it is important for it to play a much more important\r\nrole as a decision-making body. We will not reach this\r\ngoal by continuing to view the resolutions adopted by\r\nthe General Assembly as a catalogue of good\r\nintentions. It is time for a greater balance to be\r\nestablished between the powers of the Security Council\r\nand those of the General Assembly.\r\nWhat interests me most about this summit is that\r\nit is an opportunity to speak in a friendly way, but\r\nfrankly and objectively, of the shortcomings of the\r\nUnited Nations system with regard to the machinery\r\nfor providing, managing and coordinating development\r\naid. A strengthened Economic and Social Council with\r\na better structure and significantly enhanced resources\r\nshould be able to contribute to a more effective system\r\nof international development assistance.\r\nI should like to take an example, that of my own\r\ncountry, a founding Member of the United Nations and\r\nalmost the first developing country to enjoy United\r\nNations assistance. However, this assistance has left\r\nvery little in the way of tangible results. The\r\nRosenberg Mission was sent to Haiti from 1948-1950,\r\nand its mission report, entitled Mission to Haiti, is\r\nstill the authoritative reference document on the\r\nproblem of development in my country. However, after\r\nmore than fifty years of cooperation with the United\r\nNations, there is still very little sign of all this\r\nassistance that we have received over the years. Our\r\ninfrastructure is still in poor condition, our roads are\r\ncrumbling, electricity is still a luxury out of reach for\r\nmost of the population, more than half of Haitians are\r\nilliterate and there are many other problems, even\r\nworse than these. It is true that bad governance by the\r\nHaitian leaders is partially responsible for this state of\r\naffairs, but the international community must also call\r\nitself into question, engage in self-criticism and seek to\r\ndevelop a culture of efficiency.\r\nAnd we must begin by putting an end to this\r\nsterile competition amongst United Nations agencies,\r\nand between them and other bilateral and multilateral\r\norganizations. We wish for a sweeping review of\r\ncooperation policies and of the distribution of official\r\ndevelopment assistance. We understand that donors\r\nhave a political interest in planting their flag on each\r\nproject that they finance. But when they do so to the\r\ndetriment of the goals pursued and at the cost of\r\npositive results for beneficiaries daily lives, the\r\napproach must be changed.\r\nI would be remiss if I ended my statement\r\nwithout requesting a considerable reduction in the\r\npercentage of international assistance that goes to the\r\nremuneration of international experts. This is possible\r\n43\r\nA/60/PV.4\r\nif we make greater use of the qualified, experienced\r\nhuman resources available nationally, which are\r\navailable both inside and outside the beneficiary\r\ncountries.\r\nAnd finally, I should like to make a heartfelt\r\nappeal for greater coordination between the United\r\nNations agencies and the Bretton Woods institutions.\r\nWhatever one may say, the latter organizations do not\r\nseem to have a conception of development that can\r\nreally help our countries to achieve lift-off. This\r\ncoordination is essential to ensure greater effectiveness\r\nof international cooperation, particularly with regard to\r\nfinancing for development.\r\nAnd in talking about financing for development, I\r\nshould like to take the opportunity to welcome the\r\nexcellent initiative of Presidents Chirac and Lula da\r\nSilva, who have proposed innovative machinery for\r\nfinancing international development assistance. We\r\nsupport those proposals and we call upon all those who\r\ncan do so to support them in a concrete way and to\r\nmake them operational as soon as possible.\r\nIn conclusion, let me express the hope that the\r\nideas being discussed today will not end up as reports\r\npiling up in drawers along with the masses of other\r\nreports produced over the years in this prestigious\r\ninstitution, but, on the contrary, that they will give us\r\nfood for thought and influence behaviour and public\r\npolicy choices.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): The General Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Albert Pintat Santolària,\r\nPrime Minister of the Principality of Andorra.\r\nMr. Pintat Santolària (Andorra): Before I begin,\r\nI would like to express, on behalf of the people of the\r\nPrincipality of Andorra, our sympathy for and\r\nsolidarity with those who have suffered following the\r\nrecent hurricane on the American Gulf Coast.\r\n(continued in Catalan; English text provided by the\r\ndelegation)\r\nThis year is the sixtieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations. It is also the sixtieth anniversary of Hiroshima\r\nand Nagasaki. In the aftershock of the cataclysm of the\r\natomic bomb, a terrifying truth was revealed: that with\r\nevery technological leap forward, greater and more\r\nterrible dangers arise. The world recognized the need\r\nfor the United Nations, not only as a means of curbing\r\nthe dangers of our modem world but also as a forum\r\nfor reflection.\r\nIt is with the greatest respect and hope that I\r\nappear here today to address the United Nations. For in\r\ntodays world, a telephone call or an Internet message\r\ncan take us to the farthest reaches of the planet in a\r\nsplit second. All countries have become neighbours.\r\nAny war, wherever it may be taking place, affects us\r\nall directly, just the same as a natural disaster. We are\r\nwitnessing the birth of a global sensibility, of an ethical\r\nsense of fair play, decency and solidarity that\r\ntranscends national borders, languages and even\r\nreligions. Like it or not, fear it or accept it, we are all\r\ngradually merging into a single entity. What type of\r\nentity will this be? Will we live in a world where\r\nhuman rights are universally recognized? Where a\r\ndecent standard of living is enjoyed by all citizens?\r\nWhere medical care is available to everyone who needs\r\nit? Where education is prized as the foundation of\r\nspiritual well-being? Or will we be rent by\r\ndivisiveness, war, terror, misery, and ignorance?\r\nSmall States are in the majority amongst the\r\nMembers of the United Nations, and this place gives us\r\na forum in which our voices may be heard. I say may\r\nbe heard; since it is true that globalized media\r\nincreasingly control the dissemination of information.\r\nThis makes the United Nations all the more valuable as\r\na place in which original and courageous ideas can be\r\nproposed.\r\nMany countries are united in rejecting\r\nisolationism. We know that our borders are very close\r\nto each other. We know and trust our neighbours. The\r\ninterconnected nature of the global community comes\r\nas no surprise. Multilateralism is essential in a\r\nglobalized world. And for this very reason we must all\r\nsupport institutions such as the International Criminal\r\nCourt. In these uncertain times, as a new chapter in\r\nhistory dawns, we must all commit ourselves to\r\ninternational cooperation in an attempt to create a safer\r\nand more just world.\r\nThere is much talk about the reform of the United\r\nNations. I embrace the concept of reform. Who can be\r\nagainst the improvement of such a vital institution as\r\nthe United Nations at a time when the world so\r\ndesperately requires its vision and its mission to\r\npreserve peace?\r\nAt the same time, I would like to draw attention\r\nto all those parts of the United Nations system that\r\n44\r\nA/60/PV.4\r\nhave made such significant contributions over the past\r\nhalf century; for example, the United Nations\r\nChildrens Fund, the Food and Agriculture\r\nOrganization of the United Nations and the World\r\nHealth Organization, which have all made our world a\r\nbetter place. It is remarkable that the United Nations\r\nhas accomplished so much with so few resources. Of\r\ncourse, much remains to be done. We strongly support\r\nKofi Annan in his proposed reforms. We believe, like\r\nhim, that these reforms will enhance the credibility of\r\nthe Organization and good governance within it, and\r\nwill increase its transparency.\r\nOne of the great achievements of the United\r\nNations was the adoption of the Universal Declaration\r\nof Human Rights in 1948, and we must now support\r\nthe creation of a council with powers to reinforce the\r\nimplementation of human rights. Education must also\r\nbecome our priority. It is without a doubt one of the\r\nessential elements that are necessary to promote human\r\nrights and one of the most effective tools for the\r\ndevelopment of humankind.\r\nAndorra also supports the gradual\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nThese Goals were agreed on at a summit in 2000. At\r\nthat summit, we committed ourselves to act, not simply\r\nto mouth empty words.\r\nIn this globalized and interconnected world,\r\ngeographic barriers no longer protect us, nor can rich\r\ncountries ignore the hardships suffered in the poorest\r\ncountries. Not only must we recognize the principles of\r\nsocial equality, but words must be matched by deeds.\r\nThe abominable and unjustifiable acts of\r\nterrorism in New York, Madrid and London; the\r\ngenocide in Rwanda; recent wars and conflicts  all\r\nthese events have deeply troubled the international\r\ncommunity. And yet there is still hope in this imperfect\r\nworld.\r\nIn a famous meditation written over 400 years\r\nago, the Englishman John Donne wrote, No man is an\r\nisland, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the\r\ncontinent, a part of the main. ... Any mans death\r\ndiminishes me, because I am involved in mankind; and\r\ntherefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it\r\ntolls for thee.\r\nPerhaps we can turn his remarks around and\r\nmeditate on life, on the nature of the life that binds us\r\nall. Countering hunger, AIDS and terrorism,\r\novercoming poverty; working for more egalitarian\r\njustice: these are the goals and dreams which unite us\r\nhere in this Assembly. Achieving these goals is to live\r\nas a human being and ensure the certainty of a better\r\ntomorrow. Let us choose life together and continue the\r\nfight, united under the blue flag of hope of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): The General Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by Her Excellency Begum Khaleda Zia, Prime\r\nMinister of the Peoples Republic of Bangladesh.\r\nMs. Zia (Bangladesh): We gathered here five\r\nyears ago to adopt the Millennium Declaration. We had\r\nfaith in the document because it reflected the hopes and\r\naspirations of our peoples and also the seriousness with\r\nwhich we wanted to address the issues that confronted\r\nus. Today, we have an opportunity to review the\r\nprogress made and also chart the way forward to reach\r\nour common goals.\r\nThe Millennium Development Goals are a set of\r\ngoals to ensure development, peace and security, and\r\nhuman rights for our peoples. We have set for\r\nourselves a target to implement the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals by the year 2015. I cannot agree\r\nmore with the Secretary-General that it is within our\r\nmeans to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nWe can halve global poverty and stem the spread of\r\nmajor diseases, promote gender equality and empower\r\nwomen in 10 years time.\r\nProgress in achieving these Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals may have fallen short of\r\nexpectations, but we are not totally disheartened.\r\nWe in Bangladesh have the satisfaction of\r\nachieving two Millennium Development Goals already,\r\nnamely removing gender disparity in primary and\r\nsecondary schools and ensuring access to safe drinking\r\nwater. Despite numerous constraints, we have made\r\nsubstantive progress in six key socio-economic\r\ndevelopment areas.\r\nFirst, in the last 10 years we have achieved a\r\nsustained growth rate of over 5 per cent of our gross\r\ndomestic product (GDP). That was despite the floods\r\nand other natural disasters that so frequently visit our\r\ncountry.\r\nSecondly, as living conditions have improved, the\r\nincidence of poverty has fallen substantially. Indeed,\r\nour record exceeded that of most developing countries.\r\n45\r\nA/60/PV.4\r\nThe percentage of people living in poverty in\r\nBangladesh fell from over 70 per cent, in 1971, to less\r\nthan 45 per cent, in 2002.\r\nThirdly, food security has improved in the past\r\nfew years. Having suffered from chronic food deficits\r\nin the 1970s, Bangladesh is now very close to\r\nachieving food self-sufficiency.\r\nFourthly, we have enhanced our capacity to better\r\nrespond to, and manage, natural disasters. Despite last\r\nyears floods, and as a result of peoples resilience and\r\nprudent and effective post-flood economic measures,\r\nour GDP growth rate was 5.5 per cent.\r\nFifthly, there has been gradual improvement in\r\nthe physical quality-of-life index. That has been\r\nachieved through the Governments allocation of the\r\nhighest amount of resources to the education and\r\nhealth sectors year after year.\r\nSixthly, we have had laudable successes in key\r\nsocial sectors. Bangladesh has one of the highest\r\nprimary school enrolment rates in the developing\r\nworld. Most importantly, we have achieved gender\r\nparity in enrolment at the primary and lower-secondary\r\nlevels. The population growth rate has been drastically\r\nreduced, falling to 1.47 per cent in 2005 from 3 per\r\ncent in the 1970s. The total fertility rate has dropped\r\nby 50 per cent, from 6.3 to 3 births per woman over the\r\nlast two decades. Infant mortality has decreased by\r\nover 60 per cent since 1980. The empowerment of\r\nwomen has also gathered pace. Microcredit\r\nprogrammes have reached over 12 million people, most\r\nof whom are women.\r\nWe have finalized a poverty reduction strategy\r\npaper through wide-ranging consultations with all\r\nstakeholders. Our strategies include ensuring the\r\nparticipation of poor people and women in economic\r\ndevelopment; promoting good governance and sound\r\nallocation of resources; improving the quality of\r\ndelivery of services  such as in the areas of\r\nemployment, nutrition, education and health  to meet\r\nthe basic needs of the people; and ensuring sustainable\r\ndevelopment and environmental balance. At the same\r\ntime, we are making determined efforts to strengthen\r\ndemocratic institutions and ensure good governance\r\nand the rule of law. An anti-corruption commission has\r\nbeen established. The office of the tax ombudsman has\r\nbeen created. An independent human rights\r\ncommission will soon be constituted. The separation of\r\nthe judiciary from the executive branch is under way.\r\nAll those initiatives are expected to have a positive\r\nimpact on our overall socio-economic development.\r\nThe forces of intolerance, extremism and\r\nviolence have to be tackled vigorously. Bangladeshs\r\nunequivocal condemnation of all forms of terrorism is\r\nwell known. The root causes that lead to such wayward\r\nbehaviour must also be addressed. The problems of\r\npoverty, hunger, disease, illiteracy and environmental\r\ndegradation continue to haunt us. If we do not address\r\nthose problems effectively now, we will not be able to\r\ncontain the tensions and violence around us or build a\r\npeaceful and just tomorrow.\r\nThis meeting should provide the necessary\r\nimpetus to achieve the Millennium Development\r\nGoals. What we need today is firm political will to\r\nimplement the plans we have already agreed upon. In\r\nparticular, I appeal to developed countries to fulfil their\r\ncommitment as clearly stated in goal 8 of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. Let our meeting send\r\na strong signal that we are willing and ready to\r\ntranslate action plans into reality. Let our gathering be\r\nremembered by posterity as the one that made a\r\ndifference in peoples lives.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): The Assembly will now hear an address by\r\nHis Excellency The Honourable Lawrence Gonzi,\r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Malta.\r\nMr. Gonzi (Malta): This gathering of world\r\nleaders constitutes an impressive manifestation of our\r\ncollective determination to work together in the\r\npromotion of a more peaceful, just and prosperous\r\nglobal order. On the one hand, this meeting is a\r\nreaffirmation of the trust that our peoples put into the\r\nUnited Nations process in the pursuit of that objective.\r\nAt the same time, this meeting is an expression of\r\nconcern at the immense and growing challenges we\r\nface in that regard. We all share the sense of both risk\r\nand opportunity that arise from the contrasts and\r\nuncertainties of the current global order.\r\nOurs is a time characterized, as never before, by\r\nthe parallel existence of unbounded wealth and\r\nunrelievable poverty, of major scientific breakthroughs\r\nand pervasive illiteracy, of overwhelming gestures of\r\nkindness and charity and of atrocious acts of\r\nwickedness and inhumanity. That mix of contrasts has\r\nthe potential to seriously destabilize our societies and\r\nways of living. At the same time, however, it contains\r\nwithin it the germ of remedial and healing action.\r\n46\r\nA/60/PV.4\r\nEach one of us brings to this gathering his or her\r\nsocietys unique experiences of how those contrasts are\r\nunfolding at the grass-roots level. Some have been the\r\ndirect victims of acts of savagery and terrorism; others\r\nof catastrophic natural disasters. Many bring evidence\r\nof the ravages of poverty, malnutrition and ill-health;\r\nothers of the dehumanizing impact of internal conflict\r\nand political upheaval.\r\nMalta is today experiencing the influx of\r\noverwhelming and unregulated immigration flows,\r\nwhich is in itself a result of many of the other\r\nproblems. In our case that experience is all the more\r\nunnerving in that it has struck our small society with\r\nunexpected suddenness and magnitude.\r\nThe catalytic ingredient to transform all those\r\nchallenges from threats into opportunities lies in the\r\nreadiness to take collective action across the board.\r\nIn presenting his initial proposals for our\r\noutcome document, last March, Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan aptly reminded that us that the cause of larger\r\nfreedom can only be advanced if nations work together.\r\nWe have before us at this meeting a package of\r\nproposals which address the cause of larger freedom in\r\nall its dimensions  those relating to development, to\r\nsecurity and to human rights. We also have before us a\r\nset of proposals aimed at improving the effectiveness\r\nand responsiveness of the United Nations as an\r\ninstitutional structure.\r\nTogether with our partners in the European\r\nUnion, Malta has played an enthusiastic and\r\nconstructive role in the preparation of the outcome\r\ndocument. On this occasion, I wish to underline my\r\nfirm commitment and the commitment of the\r\nGovernment and people of Malta to the values and\r\nprinciples that we have been promoting throughout the\r\nprocess.\r\nMany aspects of the outcome document we have\r\nbefore us reflect the sense of solidarity, the humanistic\r\nspirit and the attachment to the rule of law which need\r\nto underpin international relations.\r\nI will not hide my feeling that we would have\r\nwished the document to have been even more\r\nambitious than it already is. In particular, we would\r\nhave wished to see a more forceful reference to the\r\nquestion of impunity, and especially to the important\r\nrole that is being played by the International Criminal\r\nCourt. We would also have wished to see more\r\nambitious sections on environment, on human rights\r\nand on disarmament.\r\nAt the same time we realize that the consensus\r\nthat has been achieved on a number of sensitive issues\r\nlays a good foundation for further measures of reform.\r\nThere are, in fact, many encouraging examples of how\r\nwe can achieve results, at times even against the odds.\r\nOne of those was the recent conclusion of the\r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of Acts\r\nof Nuclear Terrorism, which I will have the pleasure\r\nand honour of signing on behalf of Malta tomorrow\r\nmorning.\r\nEnunciations of principles and adherence to\r\nvalues have a necessary counterpart in the collective\r\nresponsibility to undertake concrete and action-\r\noriented measures. Our outcome document has\r\nidentified a number of such measures. Discussion of\r\nmany of them will continue through the sixtieth session\r\nof the General Assembly. Among other things, we are\r\ndefining long-term targets and objectives for\r\ndevelopment cooperation; we are laying the\r\ninstitutional foundations for two new organs within the\r\nUnited Nations  the peacebuilding commission and\r\nthe human rights council  and we are breaking new\r\nground in the areas of terrorism and of collective\r\nresponsibility. I would therefore like to affirm today\r\nMaltas readiness to engage itself with vigour and\r\ndetermination in the implementation of those measures.\r\nIt is appropriate that this important exercise is\r\nbeing conducted at a time when the United Nations is\r\ncommemorating the sixtieth anniversary since its\r\ncreation. Throughout those 60 years, the United\r\nNations  our United Nations  has served as a point\r\nof continuity and a beacon of hope. It provided\r\ncontinuity throughout the dark period of the cold war.\r\nIt provided hope throughout the complex and\r\ntransformative decolonization process.\r\nThough much has changed in our world over the\r\nlast 60 years, one thing has remained constant:\r\nmankinds yearning for peace, dignity and freedom. It\r\nis right that, on this occasion, we rededicate ourselves\r\nto the pursuit of that objective.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): The Assembly will now hear an address by\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Driss Jettou, Prime Minister of the\r\nKingdom of Morocco.\r\n47\r\nA/60/PV.4\r\nMr. Jettou (Morocco) (spoke in Arabic): I should\r\nlike at the outset to offer my most sincere\r\ncongratulations to the Co-Chairpersons of this\r\nunprecedented High-level Plenary Meeting on their\r\nelection.\r\nI also take this opportunity to express our thanks\r\nto Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his generous and\r\ntireless efforts to uphold the noble objectives of the\r\nUnited Nations in response to the aspirations of the\r\ninternational community. The principles of equality\r\namong States, respect for their sovereignty, national\r\nunity and territorial integrity, and the settlement of\r\ndisputes by peaceful means, in addition to the need to\r\nrefrain from the use or threat of use of force and to\r\nuphold human rights and international law, still\r\nrepresent the cornerstones of any world order.\r\nMorocco strongly believes that the prevention of\r\nconflicts and their settlement through peaceful means\r\nare the most efficient ways to preserve peace between\r\nStates and peoples, whatever the nature of the disputes\r\nor differences between the parties to the conflict, in\r\norder to genuinely abide by and maintain the noble\r\nprinciples of coexistence. We have always\r\ndemonstrated our sincere readiness to settle the\r\nartificial dispute over the Western Sahara with our\r\nneighbours in Algeria, and have demonstrated a strong\r\ndesire to develop our bilateral relations in an\r\natmosphere of solidarity, good-neighbourliness and\r\nfruitful cooperation, and within the framework of a\r\nstrategic approach to placing the Arab Maghreb Union\r\non strong and sound foundations. We sincerely hope to\r\nbe able to end our current dispute once and for all, and\r\nare looking forward to working with our brothers and\r\nMaghreb partners to strengthen cooperation, stability\r\nand integrated development in our region.\r\nFor several decades now, our country has also\r\ncontributed to international efforts to establish peace\r\nand security in regions of conflict and severe crisis,\r\nparticularly in the Middle East. We are also\r\nparticipating in and contributing to the consolidation of\r\npeace and stability in countries threatened by\r\nfragmentation and balkanization. That is why we now\r\nhave forces in the Congo and Haiti, and why we sent\r\ncontingents to Somalia, Angola and Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina in the past. The United Nations excellent\r\nrecord in peacekeeping operations is a clear\r\ndemonstration that the consolidation of peace and\r\nsecurity can guarantee economic growth particularly in\r\ndeveloping and poor countries, and allows them to face\r\nthe international crises that threaten humankind as a\r\nwhole.\r\nIn that connection, we reaffirm Moroccos strong\r\ncommitment to cooperating with regional and\r\ninternational parties in the fight against the heinous\r\nscourge of terrorism. We insist on the importance of\r\nthe international communitys engaging in such\r\ncooperation in order to address economic and social\r\nproblems, overcome endemic and fatal diseases, and\r\nface the other problems that hinder the stability and\r\ndevelopment of developing countries, especially in\r\nAfrica.\r\nThe Kingdom of Morocco is working to give the\r\nprofound hope to vulnerable populations that\r\ninternational solidarity will move from the phase of\r\npromises to that of actual fulfilment. To give substance\r\nto those international commitments, and while chairing\r\nthe Group of 77 and China in 2003, we strove to\r\nachieve the objectives we set ourselves, pursuant to\r\nMoroccos international commitments. We have also\r\nadopted a modern family code that ensures gender\r\nequality, guarantees childrens rights, and protects\r\nfamily cohesion and unity. Moreover, we have adopted\r\na national initiative for human development that is in\r\nline with the goals of the new millennium and is based\r\non a comprehensive vision and on the principles of\r\npolitical democracy, economic efficiency, social\r\ncohesion and responsible citizenship  all factors that\r\nensure the individuals integration into the process of\r\ndevelopment.\r\nMorocco is also pursuing tireless action to boost\r\nSouth-South cooperation and promote tangible\r\nsolidarity with our African brothers by opening our\r\nmarkets to exports from the least developed African\r\ncountries, and to alleviate their debts to our country.\r\nThe sixtieth anniversary of the United Nations is\r\nan opportunity that we should seize so we can go\r\nforward in developing it soundly and with fairness,\r\nirrespective of the difficulties and obstacles. Indeed,\r\nthe Organization is the most effective forum for\r\ndialogue and negotiation, for finding suitable solutions\r\nto complex issues, and for building a fair and\r\nmultilateral international order.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): The Assembly will now hear an address by\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Laurent Dona-Fologo, chairman of\r\nthe delegation of Côte dIvoire.\r\n48\r\nA/60/PV.4\r\nMr. Dona-Fologo (Côte dIvoire) (spoke in\r\nFrench): The President of the Republic of Côte\r\ndIvoire, Mr. Laurent Gbagbo, has been unable to join\r\nus here today on this great gathering on the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals and on the occasion of our\r\ncommemoration of the sixtieth anniversary of the\r\nOrganization, and he deeply regrets his absence. As\r\nMembers know, our country, Côte dIvoire, is going\r\nthrough a difficult time, and certain urgent tasks have\r\nkept him at home.\r\nHe has therefore asked me, humbly and on his\r\nbehalf, to convey the greetings of Côte dIvoire to the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly, the outgoing\r\nPresident, the Secretary-General and all participants\r\nhere. He also sends his respects to all his colleagues,\r\nthe heads of State and Government who have been able\r\nto attend.\r\nPrevious speakers have eloquently described all\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals, the hopes invested\r\nin them, and their aspirations to achieve the desired\r\nresults. Five years ago, Côte dIvoire, like all other\r\ncountries, subscribed to those Goals and joins in\r\nwelcoming all the efforts made to that end. At the same\r\ntime, we call for greater solidarity and efficiency in\r\naddressing the pending issues. We welcome in\r\nparticular the initiatives undertaken by the wealthy\r\ncountries, the Group of Eight and the leaders of\r\ndeveloped countries, including France through its\r\nPresident Chirac, the United Kingdom through Prime\r\nMinister Tony Blair, and the President of Brazil. All of\r\nthose initiatives are encouraging and deserve our\r\nsupport and gratitude.\r\nHowever, failures and disappointments linger, for\r\nexample with regard to the World Trade Organization\r\nand trade, where the farmers of the South still lack a\r\nlevel playing field with those of the North. That is\r\nembodied in the issue of cotton, which remains\r\ncontentious. We must have the courage to resolve such\r\nissues if we wish together to shape a better world.\r\nCôte dIvoire is making its humble contribution\r\nto the attainment of the Millennium Development\r\nGoals, but we all know that, as the Ivorian adage says,\r\none cannot ask a squatting frog for a chair. The frog\r\nsquats because it has no chair to offer. Today, Côte\r\ndIvoire, which has been listed among the emerging\r\ncountries of Africa, has been brought to its knees, but\r\nhas not yet been felled. We hope that the international\r\ncommunity, along with all the good will expressed\r\nhere, will help us from going under. Our struggle with\r\nregard to HIV/AIDS, literacy, women and children \r\nin a word, to the achievement of all the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals  cannot succeed without the\r\nprerequisites of peace nor security.\r\nOur long and bitter experience of war comes\r\nthrough human error, stupidity and a mutual lack of\r\nunderstanding. We therefore call on the international\r\ncommunity as a whole to help Côte dIvoire  as our\r\nbrothers of the Economic Community of West African\r\nStates; the African Union, through its mediator Thabo\r\nMbeki, whom we commend; and the Secretary-General\r\nof the United Nations have done  to prevent the\r\nworst from occurring. We can no longer afford to falter\r\nbetween democracy, embodied in a legally established\r\nGovernment, and those who take up arms in order to\r\nseize power.\r\nI believe that the United Nations and the\r\ninternational community encourage and protect\r\ndemocracy, and that Côte dIvoire cannot be an\r\nexception to that activity. The international community\r\nmust come to our aid, as it is doing with the\r\ndeployment of some 10,000 French and United Nations\r\ntroops on our territory, in order to avert the worst-case\r\nscenario. It is urgent that we cease wavering between\r\nthe rebel forces and the legal authority. I hope that\r\neveryone will come to understand that and that, above\r\nall, the international community, with all the means at\r\nits disposal, will stop Côte dIvoire from going under.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): We have heard the last speaker for this\r\nmeeting.\r\nThe meeting rose at 8.45 p.m.\r\n"
