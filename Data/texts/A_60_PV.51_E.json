As of today, as we \r\nknow, the death toll in Pakistan is still rising, and \r\nthousands and thousands of people are in danger of \r\nfreezing to death as winter sets in. A particularly \r\nintense and destructive hurricane season has left many \r\nthousands homeless as countries in the Caribbean as \r\nwell as Central and North America continue to grapple \r\nwith the effects of severe flooding and mudslides that \r\nthose storms left behind. \r\n Elsewhere, conflict-based man-made emergencies \r\ncontinue with varying intensity. Formerly warring \r\nparties in southern Sudan have signed a peace accord \r\nand entered a period of reconciliation. However, the \r\nA/60/PV.51  \r\n \r\n2 05-60137 \r\n \r\nconflict in the Darfur region of the Sudan has resulted \r\nin a severe humanitarian crisis. Food insecurity, fuelled \r\nby a lethal combination of conflict and drought, \r\ncontinues to affect close to 35 million people in sub-\r\nSaharan Africa, underlining the need for innovative \r\nand creative approaches to better predict and respond \r\nto acute malnutrition while tackling the underlying \r\ncauses of hunger and poverty. \r\n The complexity of today’s crises and the growing \r\nmagnitude of disasters require that humanitarian \r\nassistance remain one of the highest priorities of the \r\nwork of the United Nations. The 2005 world summit \r\noffered us an opportunity to reflect on the current \r\nhumanitarian system and to engage in serious, system-\r\nwide reforms. The events of the past year testify to the \r\nfact that reforms related to coordination and coherence \r\nare not only timely but urgent and, indeed, critical. \r\n Specifically, the summit outcome document \r\n(resolution 60/1) reaffirms the importance of the \r\nhumanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, \r\nimpartiality and independence. It further reinforces the \r\nneed for safe and unhindered access by humanitarian \r\nactors to populations in need. It calls upon us to \r\nstrengthen the capacity to prepare for and respond to \r\ndisasters and to improve the use of emergency standby \r\ncapacities under United Nations auspices for rapid \r\nresponse to humanitarian emergencies. Finally, it calls \r\nfor better predictability of humanitarian funding, \r\nnotably by improving the current Central Emergency \r\nRevolving Fund. \r\n For more than a decade, the Fund has played an \r\nimportant role in providing United Nations agencies \r\nwith readily available resources to allow them to \r\nrespond quickly to humanitarian emergencies. \r\nHowever, owing to its limited size and revolving \r\nnature, the Fund has faced difficulties in fulfilling its \r\naim of ensuring the provision of adequate resources for \r\nuse in the initial phase of emergencies. The proposed \r\nimproved Central Emergency Revolving Fund, which \r\nwill include a grant element, aims to promote early \r\nresponse in sudden-onset crises as well as to strengthen \r\nthe core elements of humanitarian response in \r\nunderfunded crises. \r\n Today’s debate is based on several reports from \r\nthe Secretary-General, including one on sub-item (c), \r\nconcerning the Chernobyl disaster (A/60/443). As next \r\nyear will mark the twentieth anniversary of that \r\ndisaster, we are reminded that both national and \r\ninternational efforts are still required to study, mitigate \r\nand minimize its long-term consequences. \r\n There is also a report of the Secretary-General on \r\nsub-item (d), on assistance to the Palestinian people \r\n(A/60/90). Humanitarian assistance from the United \r\nNations remains an urgent necessity for the Palestinian \r\npeople. \r\n Three draft resolutions have been submitted for \r\naction today: the first on the South Asian earthquake \r\ndisaster (A/60/L.18), the second on the Chernobyl \r\ndisaster (A/60/L.19) and the third on the Indian Ocean \r\ntsunami disaster (A/60/L.20). \r\n I look forward to constructive, creative and \r\ncompassionate deliberations during today’s debate. \r\nBehind the issues under discussion today are hundreds \r\nof thousands of human beings in grave need and, in far \r\ntoo many cases, in mortal danger. Our solidarity with \r\nthem must be unwavering. \r\n I call now on the representative of Pakistan to \r\nintroduce draft resolution A/60/L.18. \r\n Mr. Akram (Pakistan): In recent months, the \r\nworld has seen a succession of devastating natural \r\ndisasters, the frequency and intensity of which are \r\nunprecedented in living memory. The last 12 months \r\nhave been particularly devastating in terms of the \r\nhuman and material loss caused by scores of such \r\ndisasters. The report of the Secretary General on the \r\nstrengthening of the coordination of emergency \r\nhumanitarian assistance of the United Nations \r\n(A/60/87) states that, in 2004 alone there were 360 \r\ndisasters affecting more than 145 million persons and \r\ncausing more than $103 billion in material damage. \r\n The massive earthquake that took place off the \r\ncoast of Sumatra in December 2004 and the resulting \r\ntsunami brought untold misery to more than 12 nations \r\nand killed more than 240,000 people. The hurricanes \r\nthat struck the Caribbean in the fall of 2004 and that \r\nrevisited in 2005 in the form of Hurricanes Katrina and \r\nWilma were the strongest in a decade. Despite credible \r\nearly warnings, a swarm of desert locusts attacked \r\nmore than 10 countries in West and North Africa, \r\ndestroying millions of hectares of crops. The spectre of \r\navian flu threatens parts of Asia and Europe and the \r\ndisease could become a global pandemic. \r\n Five weeks ago, an earthquake registering 7.6 on \r\nthe Richter scale hit South Asia, causing colossal loss \r\nof life and material damage, especially in the North-\r\n A/60/PV.51\r\n \r\n05-60137 3 \r\n \r\nWest Frontier province of Pakistan, in Jammu and \r\nKashmir, in India and in Afghanistan. It was the worst-\r\never disaster in the region’s history. In Pakistan and \r\nAzad Kashmir, 73,000 people died, and more than \r\n74,000 were injured. Millions have been displaced and \r\nor are shelterless, even as the cruel Himalayan winter \r\ndescends over the region. The Secretary-General has \r\ndescribed the response to the South Asian earthquake \r\nas the most challenging relief operation ever faced by \r\nthe United Nations. \r\n On 7 November, the Under-Secretary-General for \r\nHumanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief \r\nCoordinator, Mr. Jan Egeland, said that the response to \r\nthe earthquake represented a test like no other for a \r\nMember State and the international community. He \r\nobserved that over the previous 10 days, extraordinary \r\nprogress had been made faced with extraordinary \r\nchallenges. He also paid tribute to Pakistan, its \r\nGovernment, its military and its people. He further \r\nnoted that the assistance efforts were still not reaching \r\nall those below the snow line and that an estimated \r\n200,000 people remained above the snow line. \r\nMeanwhile, the World Meteorological Organization \r\nhad warned that the winter might be unusually harsh. \r\n The United Nations has identified a number of \r\nimmediate priorities to meet that disaster, including the \r\nprovision of helicopters, heating, winterized tents, \r\nassistance for surgery, vaccinations, mobile health-care \r\nteams, blankets, generators, water and sanitation, \r\ntarpaulins, stoves and trauma recovery. \r\n On behalf of the Government and the people of \r\nPakistan, I wish to thank the international community \r\nfor its support and solidarity with Pakistan at this tragic \r\ntime. I express my profound appreciation to the \r\npeoples and the Governments of all Member States \r\nrepresented here, all United Nations agencies, relevant \r\ninternational organizations, civil society and the \r\nhundreds of non-governmental organizations for their \r\ntremendous outpouring of sympathy and support. \r\n We also wish to thank Secretary-General Kofi \r\nAnnan for his personal engagement in launching in \r\nGeneva the United Nations South Asia earthquake \r\n2005 flash appeal for $550 million and welcome his \r\nforthcoming visit to Pakistan for the international \r\ndonors conference to be held in Islamabad on \r\n19 November 2005. \r\n We would like to commend the excellent role \r\nplayed by the Under-Secretary-General for \r\nHumanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief \r\nCoordinator, Mr. Jan Egeland, and his entire team in \r\nthe Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian \r\nAffairs, as well as the admirable contributions of other \r\nUnited Nations entities and national, regional and \r\ninternational organizations for their prompt and active \r\nengagement in the field of relief and rescue operations, \r\nwhich have saved hundreds of thousands of precious \r\nlives. \r\n In addressing the recovery and reconstruction \r\nefforts, the sustained attention and contribution of the \r\ninternational community is vital. In that context, it is \r\nessential that international attention remain focused on \r\nthe long-term impact of the disaster and on the need to \r\nreconstruct the infrastructure that can enable the \r\nmillions of affected people to survive through the \r\nwinter, rebuild their homes, schools, hospitals, \r\nlivelihoods and rebuild their broken lives. \r\n Pakistan hopes that the international community \r\nwill support the medium- and long-term rehabilitation \r\nand reconstruction efforts of the Government and \r\npeople of Pakistan. This will be a long and arduous \r\ntask, spanning months and years. In that regard we \r\nwelcome the generous pledges made by a number of \r\nMember States to the long-term reconstruction projects \r\nin the affected areas and look forward to the concrete \r\nexpression of support at the reconstruction conference \r\nin Islamabad on 19 November. \r\n To affirm the solidarity of the international \r\ncommunity with all the victims of the earthquake \r\ndisaster in South Asia, Pakistan has initiated the draft \r\nresolution, contained in document A/60/L.18. This \r\ndraft is sponsored by 113 Member States, to all of \r\nwhom the Pakistan delegation is most grateful. The \r\npurposes of the draft resolution, which I now have the \r\nhonour to introduce on behalf of the sponsors, are self-\r\nexplanatory. \r\n The extensive list of sponsors is a demonstration \r\nof our solidarity as we stand together against the \r\ntragedies caused by such natural disasters and of our \r\nshared commitment to withstand their impact by a \r\nunited force of the peoples of the United Nations. \r\n May I take this opportunity to announce that in \r\naddition to the countries reflected in the document, the \r\nfollowing additional Member States have joined as \r\nsponsors of the draft resolution: Armenia, Austria, \r\nAustralia, Belgium, Brunei Darussalam, El Salvador, \r\nHaiti, Hungary, Grenada, Iceland, Ireland, Kyrgyzstan, \r\nA/60/PV.51  \r\n \r\n4 05-60137 \r\n \r\nMicronesia, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, \r\nRussian Federation, Timor-Leste, Ukraine and the \r\nUnited States of America. It is our hope that the draft \r\nresolution will be adopted unanimously by the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Disasters like the South Asian earthquake teach \r\nus some hard lessons, the primary one being that \r\nthough we cannot prevent natural disasters, we can \r\ncertainly work together to mitigate their devastating \r\nimpact. We need a comprehensive strategy to achieve \r\nsuch disaster management — including early warning \r\nsystems and disaster preparedness plans.  \r\n Secondly, the role of the United Nations and its \r\ndisaster coordination machinery — the Office for the \r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) — as \r\nwell as the role of the specialized agencies of the \r\nUnited Nations, with their specific expertise, is \r\nindispensable. This machinery needs to be strengthened \r\nto respond to such natural or human calamities. Even if \r\nsupport in such disasters is provided largely through \r\nbilateral channels, the United Nations overall \r\ncoordination role is crucial, especially in the early \r\nstages of such catastrophes.  \r\n Thirdly, and most important, it is imperative that \r\nthe United Nations be provided with adequate financial \r\nresources to respond quickly and effectively to such \r\ndisasters. Pakistan fully endorses the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s proposal for a $500 million Central \r\nEmergency Revolving Fund to be placed at his disposal \r\nfor that purpose. \r\n On other issues related to the agenda item, the \r\nPakistan delegation associates itself with the statement \r\nto be delivered by the representative of Jamaica. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to \r\nMr. Vladimir Tsalko, Chairman of the State Committee \r\non the issues of Chernobyl disaster consequences of \r\nthe Republic of Belarus, to introduce draft resolution \r\nA/60/L.19.  \r\n Mr. Tsalko (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): On \r\nbehalf of the sponsors I have the honour to introduce \r\nthe draft resolution entitled, “Strengthening of \r\ninternational cooperation and coordination of efforts to \r\nstudy, mitigate and minimize the consequences of the \r\nChernobyl disaster”, contained in document A/60/L.19. \r\nI am pleased to announce that since the draft was \r\npublished, the following States have joined as \r\nadditional sponsors: Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, \r\nBulgaria, Cambodia, Cape Verde, Croatia, Cyprus, \r\nCzech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Haiti, Hungary, \r\nIndia, Israel, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, \r\nMonaco, Myanmar, Norway, Peru, the Republic of \r\nKorea, Slovakia, Slovenia, Thailand and Viet Nam. \r\n Compared to similar previous General Assembly \r\ntexts, more than half of the provisions of this draft are \r\nnew, thereby reflecting the dynamism of international \r\ncooperation on Chernobyl and the great number of \r\nevents that have occurred in the area over the last two \r\nyears. It also reflects the essential element: the \r\nbeginning of a new stage in the development of \r\ninternational post-Chernobyl interaction. The main \r\nelement of this stage is not the delivery of emergency \r\nhumanitarian assistance but the comprehensive \r\nrehabilitation of the contaminated areas, including the \r\nrenewal of socio-economic activity in those regions \r\nwith a view to creating safe living conditions for \r\npeople in the area. \r\n Recently, we discussed that new United Nations \r\nstrategy at the international conference in Vienna in \r\nSeptember, within the context of the Chernobyl Forum. \r\nThe draft resolution reflects our agreements, many of \r\nthe provisions of which are directed towards the \r\nimplementation of the recommendations of the main \r\nreport of the Forum on the legacy of Chernobyl. I \r\nwould like to note first the importance of the \r\nspecialized medical, ecological, social and economic \r\nresearch into the consequences of the Chernobyl \r\ndisaster. \r\n The draft resolution aims to strengthen the United \r\nNations coordination mechanism to organize \r\ninternational post-Chernobyl interaction, as well as to \r\nenhance the role of the United Nations Coordinator on \r\nChernobyl in that mechanism. We are convinced that \r\nthe United Nations Development Programme \r\nAdministrator, Mr. Kemal Dervis, who was recently \r\nappointed to his post, will successfully implement the \r\nagreed approaches in this important matter. \r\n The draft resolution also expresses support for \r\nthe initiatives of the three affected countries — the \r\nRepublic of Belarus, the Russian Federation and \r\nUkraine — and is timed to coincide with the twentieth \r\nanniversary of the Chernobyl disaster. One of those \r\ninitiatives is to convene a special meeting of the \r\nGeneral Assembly in April 2006 to mark the twentieth \r\nanniversary of the disaster, not simply to speak again \r\nabout our post-Chernobyl problems, but mostly for the \r\n A/60/PV.51\r\n \r\n05-60137 5 \r\n \r\npurpose of discussing and coordinating our further \r\njoint steps to improve the living conditions of millions \r\nof people in the contaminated territories, in particular \r\nthe living conditions of children. \r\n We would like to thank all States that have \r\ncontributed so much to the improvement of the draft. It \r\nis now ready for consideration, and we hope it will be \r\nadopted by consensus, as was the case in previous \r\nyears. \r\n Now, in my national capacity, I would like to \r\ntouch upon some issues that the General Assembly is \r\nconsidering today. For Belarus, whose territory \r\nreceived some 70 per cent of the radioactive fall-out as \r\na result of the Chernobyl disaster, the problem of \r\nChernobyl is the most topical. Even now, almost 20 \r\nyears after the disaster, the entire range of post-\r\nChernobyl problems continues to be a heavy burden on \r\nthe shoulders of the people of Belarus. The area \r\ncontaminated with long-lived radioactive nuclides \r\nconstitutes 21 per cent of the country’s entire territory. \r\nThe population in that area continues to be subject to \r\nchronic internal and external irradiation because of the \r\nlong-lived radioactive nuclides present in the \r\nenvironment.  \r\n The economy of those regions, especially as \r\nrelated to agriculture and forestry, is in a dire situation. \r\nSafe production technologies are needed. Our experts \r\nhave been working for a long time in that area and \r\nhave managed to develop a number of technologies, \r\nmaking it possible to produce products which meet \r\nnon-contamination standards. We are ready to share \r\nthat invaluable experience with other States. \r\n The Republic of Belarus has already spent more \r\nthan $17 billion on efforts to resolve the range of its \r\npost-Chernobyl problems, including the resettlement of \r\n137,000 people. In order to comply with the next State \r\nprogramme for 2006-2010, we plan to allocate about \r\n$2 billion. However, State funding cannot fully cover \r\nthe economic damage inflicted by the Chernobyl \r\ndisaster, estimated by experts to be $235 billion. \r\n The accident in Chernobyl is a disaster, the \r\nmagnitude of whose consequences go far beyond the \r\neconomic capacities of one State or even of a group of \r\nStates. Therefore, it is very important to establish \r\nconstructive long-term international cooperation with \r\nthe United Nations carrying out liaison and \r\ncoordination. It is important to be guided by the \r\npriority needs of the affected States; otherwise, \r\ninternational interaction will lose its efficiency, and the \r\nfinancial resources will be spent without producing the \r\ndesired effect. \r\n We are grateful to the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme and the United Nations \r\nChildren’s Fund for giving the post-Chernobyl \r\nproblems of Belarus due attention in the 2005 draft \r\ncountry programme documents for the next five years. \r\nWe view this as a guarantee that the new United \r\nNations strategy on Chernobyl will be successfully \r\nimplemented in our country. The State and Government \r\nagencies of Belarus are prepared to engage in active \r\ncooperation with the organizations and agencies of the \r\nUnited Nations system on Chernobyl issues. We call \r\nupon donor countries to give the necessary financial \r\nsupport for the implementation of these country \r\nprogramme documents. \r\n To implement the new United Nations strategy, \r\nan international conference entitled “Twenty Years \r\nafter Chernobyl: Strategy for the Recovery and \r\nSustainable Development of the Affected Areas” is \r\nscheduled to be held in Minsk on 19 to 21 April 2006. \r\nWe invite all interested States and international \r\norganizations to take an active part in the lead-up to \r\nand the conduct of this important forum. The aim of it \r\nis to work out and agree on joint, coordinated actions \r\nby Governments of the affected countries and the \r\ninternational community for comprehensive \r\nrehabilitation of the affected areas in the territory for \r\nthe next 10 years. \r\n To put it plainly, we are talking about the \r\neconomic survival of these regions. However, when \r\nconsidering the Chernobyl topic from the standpoint of \r\neconomic recovery and sustainable development, we \r\nshould not forget the long-term medical and \r\nenvironmental aftermath of the disaster. We are \r\ngrateful to donor countries and to international \r\norganizations that have provided assistance in studying \r\nand overcoming the aftermath of the disaster. This \r\nparticularly pertains to diagnosing and the early \r\ndetection of oncological and cardiovascular diseases, in \r\nparticular those that affect children. I would like to say \r\nthat, at this stage, we have sufficient resources and \r\ncapacity for treating children and adolescents within \r\nour country. We still need modern medical equipment, \r\nthough, and we ask our donors to give priority \r\nattention to this area. \r\nA/60/PV.51  \r\n \r\n6 05-60137 \r\n \r\n Like all peoples, we in Belarus are extremely \r\nconcerned at the growing frequency of large-scale \r\nnatural disasters that have been occurring in recent \r\ntimes in various parts of the world. Countries with \r\nwhich Belarus has had longstanding, close and friendly \r\nrelations have suffered. The Chernobyl problem has \r\nheightened our awareness of the complexity of the \r\nsituation in which our friends find themselves. \r\nTherefore, Belarus has co-sponsored draft resolutions \r\non dealing with the consequences of the Indian Ocean \r\ntsunami and the earthquake in Pakistan. \r\n These natural disasters prompt two main \r\nconclusions with regard to the future. First, decisive \r\naction needs to be taken at all levels to implement the \r\nHyogo Declaration and the Hyogo Framework for \r\nAction 2005-2015, which were adopted at the 2005 \r\nWorld Conference on Disaster Reduction. Particular \r\nattention should be given to establishing an \r\ninternational early warning and threat reduction system \r\nfor natural disasters and for reducing the danger they \r\npose. \r\n Secondly, the financial capacity of the United \r\nNations to react to emergency humanitarian situations \r\nurgently needs to be increased. We welcome here the \r\nefforts of the Under-Secretary-General for \r\nHumanitarian Affairs, Mr. Jan Egeland, in particular \r\nhis efforts to strengthen the Central Emergency \r\nResponse Fund of the United Nations. The \r\nimplementation of that initiative would make it \r\npossible for the United Nations quickly and adequately \r\nto provide assistance to countries that are going \r\nthrough humanitarian crises. It would also make it \r\npossible to increase financing for recovery measures to \r\ndeal with the long-term consequences of large-scale \r\nnatural disasters and technological catastrophes that \r\nhave occurred over the last decade. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Malaysia, who will introduce draft \r\nresolution A/60/L.20 on behalf of the Association of \r\nSoutheast Asian Nations. \r\n Mr. Hamidon (Malaysia): I shall be speaking \r\nfirst on behalf of the Association of Southeast Asian \r\nNations (ASEAN) under agenda item 73, sub-item (a); \r\nand then I will present a statement in my national \r\ncapacity on sub-item (d). \r\n I have the honour to introduce draft resolution \r\nA/60/L.20, entitled “Strengthening emergency relief, \r\nrehabilitation, reconstruction and prevention in the \r\naftermath of the Indian Ocean tsunami disaster” on \r\nbehalf of the ASEAN member countries — namely \r\nBrunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao \r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, the \r\nPhilippines, Singapore, Thailand, Viet Nam, and my \r\nown country, Malaysia, and the other sponsors who are \r\nlisted in the draft itself. \r\n Let me first begin by thanking the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his reports prepared under agenda item 73 \r\non the strengthening of the coordination of \r\nhumanitarian and disaster relief assistance of the \r\nUnited Nations, including special economic assistance, \r\nand the strengthening of the coordination of emergency \r\nhumanitarian assistance of the United Nations. \r\n It has been proven time and again how vulnerable \r\nwe all are to the violent and destructive forces of \r\nnature. Natural disasters and calamities have often hit \r\nus without prior warning. For most of the countries in \r\nthe developing world, which lack sophisticated high-\r\ntech early warning equipment, natural disasters have \r\ninflicted untold misery, devastation of property and \r\nloss of human lives. As we have witnessed on many \r\noccasions, the impact of the destruction has placed a \r\nheavy burden on the social and economic fabric of the \r\naffected countries, particularly on the developing and \r\nleast developed countries. \r\n Many of us, in varying degrees, have experienced \r\nthe struggle to rebuild and recover from the devastation \r\nin the aftermath of natural disasters. The struggle to \r\ncope and rebuild from the pieces of destruction would \r\nhave been more painful and daunting, if not for the \r\nsupport and assistance that came in from around the \r\nworld in the name of humanity. Facing the pain and \r\nsuffering caused by natural disasters, the affected \r\ncountries could only seek solace in the overwhelming \r\nexpression of international cooperation, assistance, \r\nsolidarity and sympathy. We recall with a deep sense of \r\nappreciation such demonstrations of humanity by \r\nGovernments, rich and poor, non-governmental \r\norganizations (NGOs) and individuals all around the \r\nworld to offer a helping hand in the wake of the Indian \r\nOcean earthquake and tsunami of 26 December 2004. \r\n With a globalized media network, the response to \r\nthat tragedy was quick and unprecedented, enabling \r\ninternational organizations, including the United \r\nNations and other entities, to organize emergency \r\nassistance to reach the affected countries in due time. \r\nOnce again, we would like to take this opportunity to \r\n A/60/PV.51\r\n \r\n05-60137 7 \r\n \r\nacknowledge our appreciation to the international \r\ncommunity and the United Nations system for their \r\nsupport and assistance in saving thousands of lives and \r\nassisting millions of tsunami victims to rebuild their \r\nfuture. It is our responsibility to ensure the \r\nsustainability of international attention and the \r\ncontinuing support to the reconstruction efforts in the \r\ntsunami-affected countries, even though the issue no \r\nlonger enjoys broad international media coverage. \r\n Be that as it may, the Governments of affected \r\ncountries on the Indian Ocean rim have continued \r\nworking to fulfil their obligations regarding \r\nreconstruction and restoring normal life for their \r\npeople. At the same time, efforts have been made to \r\nensure that the necessary preventive measures are put \r\nin place to protect their people from such destructive \r\nforces in the future. \r\n In this context, we have agreed to take the \r\nnecessary measures, with the involvement of the \r\ninternational community, the United Nations system, \r\ninternational organizations, international financial \r\ninstitutions and civil society, as well as the private \r\nsector, as set out in General Assembly resolution \r\n59/279 of 19 January 2005 on strengthening emergency \r\nrelief, rehabilitation, reconstruction and prevention in \r\nthe aftermath of the Indian Ocean tsunami disaster. \r\n In the implementation of the resolution, we are \r\npleased to report that shelter programmes have been \r\nprepared and implemented, and that there were no \r\nmajor outbreaks of pandemic diseases in the affected \r\nareas. Nonetheless, we continue to be mindful of the \r\nremaining challenges in ensuring the full \r\nimplementation of medium- and long-term \r\nrehabilitation and community-driven reconstruction. \r\n We have to acknowledge that the task and the \r\nresponsibility of the affected Governments to \r\nundertake the efforts of reconstruction and \r\nredevelopment of the areas and provinces devastated \r\nby the tsunami are far from easy. Nonetheless, the \r\naffected Governments are committed to ensuring that \r\nthe reconstruction and redevelopment efforts are aimed \r\nat providing the people with a better future and safer \r\nenvironment, in line with the high expectations of their \r\npeople and the donor community. \r\n We have to be mindful that this is not only a \r\nchallenge to the tsunami-affected countries, but also \r\nfor the international community in ensuring a \r\ncontinued, effective management and coordination in \r\nthe transition between humanitarian assistance and \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n There is a need to look at the broader agenda with \r\nthe formulation of longer-term goals to assist the \r\ntsunami-affected populations. That would involve \r\neffective coordination among the Governments of \r\naffected countries, relevant bodies of the United \r\nNations system, donor countries, regional and \r\ninternational financial institutions, civil society and the \r\nprivate sector in ensuring equity of assistance among \r\nthe affected communities. \r\n It is our expectation that both the tsunami-\r\naffected countries and the donor communities must \r\nremain committed to promoting transparency and \r\naccountability with respect to the channelling and \r\nutilization of resources, which will facilitate the long-\r\nterm sustainability of the recovery and reconstruction \r\nefforts. Furthermore, the capacity of the United \r\nNations and the international community to respond \r\nand to deal with emergency humanitarian situations in \r\ncountries affected by natural disasters should be \r\nenhanced in order to address the problems promptly \r\nwith greater capacity, quality and accountability. \r\n The Association of Southeast Asian Nations \r\n(ASEAN) has undertaken several steps to strengthen \r\nregional and national capacity. In that connection, \r\nASEAN is pleased to inform that it has concluded the \r\nASEAN Agreement on Disaster Management and \r\nEmergency Response in July 2005. It is an agreement \r\nthat facilitates response and disaster reduction \r\nactivities in the region. In the same way, we also \r\nwelcome the establishment of a Multi-Donor Voluntary \r\nTrust Fund on Tsunami Early Warning Arrangements in \r\nthe Indian Ocean and Southeast Asia, which will \r\ncontribute to the setting-up of a network of early \r\nwarning systems and to the building up of capacity of \r\nthe region in dealing with natural disasters.  \r\n An ASEAN-United Nations seminar on \r\nhumanitarian assistance and rapid response capacity \r\nwas also held last October to identify concrete steps to \r\nenhance ASEAN’s response capacity.  \r\n Against that background, I am pleased to \r\nintroduce draft resolution A/60/L.20. We would like to \r\nthank delegations that have been cooperating with \r\nASEAN and all those delegations that, by co-\r\nsponsoring the resolution, join ASEAN and the \r\naffected countries in voicing their concerns and interest \r\nwith regard to this issue. \r\nA/60/PV.51  \r\n \r\n8 05-60137 \r\n \r\n The draft resolution essentially proposes to \r\nupdate General Assembly resolution 59/279 of \r\n19 January 2005, incorporating additional paragraphs \r\nfrom the Joint Asian-African Leaders’ Statement on \r\nTsunami, Earthquake and Other Natural Disasters, \r\nwhich was adopted at the Asian-African Summit of \r\n2005, and from the report of the Secretary-General on \r\nstrengthening emergency relief, rehabilitation, \r\nreconstruction, recovery and prevention in the \r\naftermath of the Indian Ocean tsunami disaster \r\n(A/60/86), as well as from the World Conference on \r\nDisaster Reduction and other initiatives.  \r\n The updated resolution focuses on seven main \r\naspects: first, the reaffirmation of the commitment of \r\nthe heads of State and Government as reflected in the \r\n2005 World Summit Outcome to work expeditiously \r\ntowards the establishment of a worldwide early \r\nwarning system for all natural hazards by building on \r\nexisting national and regional capacities, such as the \r\nnewly established Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning and \r\nMitigation System; secondly, the continued support \r\nand generous contributions of the international \r\ncommunity, particularly towards further rehabilitation \r\nand reconstruction; thirdly, the appointment of \r\nPresident Bill Clinton as the Secretary-General’s \r\nSpecial Envoy for Tsunami Recovery and the \r\nexpression of appreciation for the efforts undertaken by \r\nthe Special Envoy; fourthly, the establishment of the \r\nGlobal Consortium for Tsunami-Affected Countries to \r\nsustain the political will of the international \r\ncommunity to support medium- and long-term \r\nrehabilitation, reconstruction and risk reduction efforts \r\nled by the Governments of the tsunami-affected \r\ncountries; fifthly, the importance of transparency and \r\naccountability from the perspectives of donor and \r\nrecipient countries; sixthly, requesting the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to continue to explore ways to strengthen the \r\nrapid response capacities of the international \r\ncommunity to provide immediate humanitarian relief, \r\nbuilding on existing arrangements and ongoing \r\ninitiatives; and finally, the importance of developing \r\nstronger institutions, mechanisms and capacities at all \r\nlevels by promoting public education, awareness and \r\ncommunity participation. \r\n On behalf of the sponsors, I wish to inform you \r\nthat a correction is needed in draft resolution L.20 \r\nbefore you. In the eleventh preambular paragraph, the \r\nphrase “a multinodal early warning system network” \r\nshould be deleted and replaced with “an early warning \r\nsystem”.  \r\n The eleventh preambular paragraph should then \r\nread: \r\n “Welcoming also the establishment of the Multi-\r\nDonor Voluntary Trust Fund on Tsunami Early \r\nWarning Arrangements in the Indian Ocean and \r\nSoutheast Asia, which will contribute to setting \r\nup an early warning system and to building up the \r\ncapacity of the region in dealing with natural \r\ndisasters,” \r\n In conclusion, I wish to express that ASEAN \r\nlooks forward to the continuing support of the Member \r\nStates of the United Nations for this important \r\nresolution and to the adoption of the resolution by \r\nconsensus. \r\n I now turn to the next part of my intervention, \r\nwhich is a national statement on sub-item (d) of the \r\nagenda item, entitled “Assistance to the Palestinian \r\npeople”.  \r\n My delegation would like to express at the outset \r\nits appreciation to the Secretary-General for his report \r\nsubmitted under agenda item 73(d), entitled \r\n“Assistance to the Palestinian people”, in document \r\nA/60/90. \r\n It is clear to us from the report that the \r\nhumanitarian situation and the daily living and socio-\r\neconomic conditions in the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritories have not improved since the last report. The \r\nreport, especially paragraphs 8 through 13, contains \r\nrevealing and disturbing accounts and figures \r\nconcerning the deteriorating situation. The \r\ninternational community should be concerned with the \r\nsituation in the occupied Palestinian territories, since it \r\nhas been well documented in the reports by other \r\nUnited Nations agencies, in particular the Economic \r\nand Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA), \r\nthe United Nations Relief and Works Agency for \r\nPalestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) and the \r\nUnited Nations Office for the Coordination of \r\nHumanitarian Affairs (OCHA). \r\n Given the prevailing circumstances, the role \r\nplayed and efforts made by the relevant United Nations \r\nagencies, the United Nations Special Coordinator for \r\nthe Middle East Peace Process and Personal \r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General to the \r\nPalestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian \r\n A/60/PV.51\r\n \r\n05-60137 9 \r\n \r\nAuthority, and the World Bank, as well as other \r\nhumanitarian organizations, in extending the necessary \r\nhumanitarian and emergency assistance in the occupied \r\nPalestinian territories remain crucial and indispensable.  \r\n However, my delegation regrets that such \r\nassistance has been and continues to be provided under \r\ndifficult circumstances, owing primarily to the \r\nrepressive and restrictive measures imposed by Israel. \r\nMy delegation concurs with the observation made in \r\nparagraph 58 of the report that those restrictions \r\nclearly violate established principles of international \r\nlaw and have resulted in increased costs for operational \r\nagencies, which are ultimately borne by the \r\ninternational community.  \r\n Unless significantly eased, such policies and \r\nmeasures will continue to pose serious obstructions to \r\neconomic recovery and development opportunities for \r\nthe majority of Palestinians. We wish to reiterate our \r\ncall to Israel to allow unfettered access to staff \r\nmembers of United Nations agencies and humanitarian \r\nworkers in the occupied territories, so that they can \r\ncarry out their work effectively. As a matter of priority, \r\nIsrael must ease restrictions and work closely with \r\nUnited Nations agencies, donor countries and \r\nhumanitarian organizations to ensure that aid and \r\ndevelopment projects are delivered in a timely and \r\ncomprehensive manner. \r\n My delegation also wishes to reiterate its call to \r\nIsrael to comply with the Advisory Opinion concerning \r\nthe separation wall, rendered by the International Court \r\nof Justice in July 2004, and with General Assembly \r\nresolution ES-10/15. As highlighted in paragraphs 13 \r\nand 73 of the report (A/60/90), the separation wall and \r\nits associated regime has had, and will continue to \r\nhave, an adverse impact on the humanitarian situation \r\nand the living and socio-economic conditions of the \r\nPalestinian communities affected by its construction \r\nand completion. The separation wall and its associated \r\nregime also pose, and will continue to pose, problems, \r\nin terms of movement and access, for staff members of \r\nUnited Nations agencies and humanitarian workers in \r\ncarrying out their work in the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritory. \r\n My delegation commends the performance of all \r\nUnited Nations agencies for their efforts and for \r\ncarrying out programmes to provide a variety of types \r\nof economic, humanitarian and social assistance to the \r\nPalestinian people and public institutions, as reflected, \r\nin considerable detail, in paragraphs 14 through 53 of \r\nthe report. The remaining challenges, as well as the \r\nunmet and emerging requirements, as documented in \r\nparagraphs 67 through 74 of the report, require \r\nparticular attention. We believe that all those efforts \r\nand programmes that have been identified by United \r\nNations agencies could, if successfully implemented, \r\ncreate an environment that could contribute to the \r\nachievement of sustainable peace in the region. All of \r\nthose efforts and programmes require financial and \r\nother resources. We urge the international donor \r\ncommunity to continue to contribute generously to that \r\ncause. For our part, the Government and the people of \r\nMalaysia will continue to extend assistance, within our \r\nlimited means and capacity, to the people of Palestine. \r\n My delegation is pleased to note that, as called \r\nfor by many delegations in the past, the relevant United \r\nNations agencies and parties have established, and will \r\ncontinue to undertake, measures to harmonize and \r\ncoordinate their humanitarian and emergency \r\nassistance efforts and programmes, under the \r\ncoordination of the Office of the Special Coordinator \r\nfor the Middle East Peace Process and Personal \r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General to the \r\nPalestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian \r\nAuthority and with the participation of the Palestinian \r\nAuthority.  \r\n My delegation welcomes the launch of a new \r\nmedia-related inter-agency coordination mechanism \r\naimed at drawing attention to and providing \r\ninformation about the humanitarian situation in the \r\noccupied Palestinian territory and the United Nations \r\npresence in the region. \r\n We need to understand that financial resources \r\nand other technical assistance made available to the \r\nPalestinians will not, by themselves, resolve the \r\npolitical crisis affecting the lives of the Palestinians. \r\nThe solution remains to urge Israel to end the \r\noccupation and respect international law and relevant \r\nUnited Nations resolutions. We must achieve a \r\npeaceful resolution to the conflict based on a \r\ncomprehensive political dialogue and follow-up to the \r\nparties’ respective commitments and obligations under \r\nthe road map. My delegation considers the Israeli \r\ndisengagement from Gaza to be a positive move that \r\ncould contribute to peace and stability and to economic \r\nimprovement in the area.  \r\nA/60/PV.51  \r\n \r\n10 05-60137 \r\n \r\n In this connection, it is vital for both Israel and \r\nPalestine to establish and maintain close coordination \r\nwithin the context of the road map. Peace will remain \r\nelusive unless all parties concerned — those in the \r\nregion and the wider international community — are \r\nprepared to play their part responsibly, in good faith \r\nand with a high degree of political will to seek a long-\r\nlasting peace. \r\n Mr. Neil (Jamaica): I have the honour to speak on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China on agenda item \r\n73, “Strengthening of the coordination of humanitarian \r\nand disaster relief assistance of the United Nations, \r\nincluding special economic assistance”, and sub-tem \r\n(a), “Strengthening of the coordination of emergency \r\nhumanitarian assistance of the United Nations”. \r\n The past decade has seen a growing demand for \r\nUnited Nations humanitarian assistance. The increased \r\nfrequency and severity of natural disasters affecting \r\nnearly all parts of the globe during the past year, in \r\nparticular, has demonstrated our continued \r\nvulnerability to the vicissitudes of nature. As you, Mr. \r\nPresident, mentioned in your opening statement, we \r\nhave witnessed the devastation caused by the tsunami \r\nin south Asia in late December 2004, a disastrous \r\nearthquake that struck south Asia this past October, \r\nwith widespread destruction and loss of life affecting \r\nPakistan, and the intensive and destructive 2005 \r\nhurricane season, which wreaked havoc in the \r\nCaribbean, Central America and the south coast regions \r\nof the United States.  \r\n Such situations are additional to long-standing \r\ncomplex emergency situations, while new ones are \r\nrising as a result of armed conflicts, many of them in \r\ndeveloping countries. The frequency, changing nature \r\nand scope of such emergencies call for an increased \r\nresponse from the international community in terms of \r\nmore resources and the provision of the requisite skills \r\nin disaster prevention and management. \r\n Against that background, serious challenges have \r\nbeen posed for the United Nations humanitarian \r\nresponse mechanism. The need to strengthen its \r\ncoordination and disaster-relief capacity, including \r\nspecial economic assistance, so as to ensure that all \r\ncases of emergency are given due attention and that \r\nrelief supplies are based on the principles of neutrality, \r\nhumanity and impartiality, is therefore of paramount \r\nimportance. \r\n Addressing the funding capacity of the United \r\nNations system is one of the most critical steps in \r\nachieving the objective of improving the United \r\nNations emergency-response capacity. The reliability \r\nand predictability of funding is essential, if we are to \r\nensure that not only new and large-scale emergencies \r\nthat capture the attention of the media, but also other \r\nhumanitarian crises that are not given much publicity, \r\nreceive attention. This all results in increasing demands \r\non the Central Emergency Revolving Fund (CERF), \r\nwhich requires urgent review if it is to fulfil its \r\npurposes. \r\n In this regard, we believe that one of the most \r\nsignificant decisions taken by our leaders at the High-\r\nlevel Plenary Meeting this year was their endorsement \r\nof the Economic and Social Council recommendations \r\nmade in July this year to the General Assembly to \r\nimprove the Fund. \r\n The report of the Secretary-General on the \r\nCentral Emergency Revolving Fund, contained in \r\ndocument A/60/432, makes some useful \r\nrecommendations for improving the operations of the \r\nFund. The Group of 77 and China supports the \r\nexpansion of the Fund from its current base of $50 \r\nmillion to $500 million, and the inclusion of a grant \r\ncomponent to support rapid response. This will, we \r\nbelieve, significantly contribute to achieving a more \r\npredictable, timely response to humanitarian \r\nemergencies. \r\n We appreciate the contributions from the donor \r\ncommunity, and we especially commend the members \r\nof the European Union, in particular the United \r\nKingdom, which has made pledges towards the \r\nexpansion of the Fund that we anticipate will \r\nmaterialize in 2006. Non-traditional donors, such as \r\nthe private sector and the developing countries, are \r\nalso to be encouraged, and we are particularly pleased \r\nat the steps taken by some developing countries in \r\nmaking pledges. \r\n We look forward to further discussions on how \r\nbest to continue to improve existing financial \r\nmechanisms, such as the flash appeals process, as well \r\nas a possible review of the allocation of resources from \r\nthe regular budget to the Office for the Coordination of \r\nHumanitarian Affairs (OCHA) for more long-term \r\nhumanitarian response, bearing in mind the projected \r\nneeds. \r\n A/60/PV.51\r\n \r\n05-60137 11 \r\n \r\n Effective coordination of humanitarian and \r\ndisaster relief assistance requires cooperation between \r\nall stakeholders, including the United Nations system, \r\nand regional as well as national mechanisms. While \r\nacknowledging the coordinating leadership role of the \r\nUnited Nations, account should be taken of the role to \r\nbe played by national Governments in identifying \r\nnational priorities. The need for field-level \r\ncoordination is of paramount importance. We welcome \r\nthe announcement in July by the Under-Secretary-\r\nGeneral for Humanitarian Affairs of a programme for \r\nthe training and capacity-building of resident and \r\nhumanitarian coordinators, as well as to increase the \r\npool of experienced candidates for the coordinator \r\nsystem, so as to allow them to draw upon a reserve of \r\nexpertise in response to new crises. \r\n The Group of 77 and China recognize that it is \r\nthe primary responsibility of States to respond to the \r\nneeds of their citizens in emergency situations. At the \r\nsame time, international cooperation, not only in \r\nrelation to the provision of funding, but also in terms \r\nof the sharing of best practices and the transfer of \r\ntechnology to developing countries, is also of great \r\nimportance. Those should form part of a \r\ncomprehensive package of response to the relief and \r\ndevelopment dimensions of humanitarian disasters. \r\n The report of the Secretary-General in document \r\nA/60/227 addresses the issue of transition from relief \r\nto development. It makes some useful \r\nrecommendations, including that the United Nations \r\nand donor Governments should enhance the level of \r\npreparedness of countries prone to natural disasters, \r\nparticularly at the local level, by significantly \r\nincreasing funding for preparedness activities. It also \r\ncalls on Member States to implement the priorities set \r\nout in the Hyogo Framework for Action in support of \r\nthe International Strategy for Disaster Reduction and, \r\nin particular, to incorporate practical disaster reduction \r\nsteps into sustainable development and poverty \r\nreduction strategies, as well as disaster preparedness \r\nand response. We support that and other \r\nrecommendations in the report. \r\n We recognize the challenging role of the United \r\nNations in responding to complex emergency \r\nsituations. Efforts to respond to such situations must be \r\nbalanced against the need to ensure the security and \r\nprotection of humanitarian personnel. With that in \r\nmind, we welcome the efforts of the Secretary-General \r\nin establishing guidelines for complex missions and, at \r\nthe same time, reiterate the need to ensure that \r\nhumanitarian missions observe the relevant \r\ninternational legal instruments and principles in \r\nconducting multidimensional integrated peacekeeping \r\nmissions.  \r\n We also take this opportunity to congratulate you, \r\nSir, on the important contribution you made some years \r\nago, in another capacity, in developing the framework \r\nfor United Nations activities in humanitarian and \r\ndisaster assistance. An important legacy of your \r\ninvolvement is resolution 46/182, which contains the \r\nguiding principles for the strengthening of the \r\ncoordination of emergency assistance of the United \r\nNations system. The Group of 77 and China reaffirm \r\ntoday the centrality of that resolution. \r\n Finally, we take this opportunity to express our \r\nthanks and appreciation to Under-Secretary-General \r\nEgeland and his staff at OCHA for their outstanding \r\nand untiring efforts in coordinating humanitarian \r\nactivities on behalf of the United Nations. \r\n The President: I thank the representative of \r\nJamaica for his words about resolution 46/182 and the \r\nbasis it provides for the humanitarian work of the \r\nUnited Nations. Let me also, from this Chair, express \r\nmy pride in having Jan Egeland as one of my \r\nsuccessors in that important and sometimes sadly \r\ndepressing function inside the United Nations. \r\n Sir Emyr Jones Parry (United Kingdom): I have \r\nthe honour to speak on behalf of the European Union \r\n(EU) and those countries that have aligned themselves \r\nwith this statement. \r\n The European Union would like to thank the \r\nSecretary-General for the reports submitted for \r\nconsideration under this item. They clearly \r\ndemonstrate the immense challenges faced by the \r\nhumanitarian community in the last year, as well as the \r\ncontinuing need to provide more effective and \r\npredictable humanitarian assistance. The European \r\nUnion would like to take this opportunity to express its \r\ncondolences to and solidarity with all those affected by \r\nhumanitarian emergencies in the last year. We would \r\nalso like to thank all humanitarian personnel for their \r\ntireless and dedicated efforts to assist and protect \r\nvulnerable populations, often at great personal risk. \r\n Events this year, most recently and starkly in \r\nPakistan, have highlighted the importance of \r\nexpanding and improving our capacity to respond \r\nA/60/PV.51  \r\n \r\n12 05-60137 \r\n \r\nquickly and effectively to major disasters. The \r\nchallenge to us all is to sustain our response and our \r\ncommitment in the aftermath of a disaster. In Pakistan, \r\nthe European Union is committed to supporting the \r\nUnited Nations renewed appeal for assistance with the \r\nongoing tragedy as winter approaches. Similarly, the \r\ngrowing crises in southern Africa — often referred to \r\nas the triple threat — demonstrate yet again the urgent \r\nneed for early preventative measures, with the clear \r\nlesson that early intervention is much less costly than \r\nresponding later, once needs and suffering have \r\nescalated. \r\n The European Union fully supports the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s call in his report “In larger freedom” for a \r\nmore predictable humanitarian response, including in \r\nthe areas of standby arrangements, funding and \r\ncoordination capacity. All of those elements are \r\nmutually reinforcing and must be pursued together. \r\n In terms of standby capacity, the European Union \r\nvalues existing mechanisms, such as the United \r\nNations Disaster Assessment and Coordination teams, \r\nas well as the International Search and Rescue \r\nAdvisory Group, but the EU also attaches great \r\nimportance in terms of developing and sustaining \r\ndisaster risk reduction, preparedness and response \r\ncapacity at all levels. Experience has shown that more \r\nlives are saved in the aftermath of a disaster when \r\nresponse teams can deploy immediately, especially at \r\nthe local and national levels. We recognize that the \r\nrapid response capacity of the international community \r\nstill fails people in need of urgent assistance and we \r\ntherefore call for enhanced support to the United \r\nNations in its efforts to strengthen its response. \r\n On funding capacity, we have been given a clear \r\nmandate from the Economic and Social Council and \r\nfrom world leaders at the September United Nations \r\nsummit to improve the existing Central Emergency \r\nRevolving Fund (CERF). We welcome the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report on the proposed modalities for an \r\nupgraded CERF, which should enable quicker and \r\nmore effective responses to humanitarian emergencies, \r\nand hope that it will become operational early in 2006. \r\nWe also welcome the announcement of pledges, in \r\nprinciple, towards an upgraded CERF and invite \r\nfurther voluntary contributions to the Fund. From the \r\nEuropean Union perspective, it is essential that the \r\nFund’s accountability structures work retroactively in \r\norder to facilitate one of the primary objectives of the \r\nupgraded CERF — to respond immediately to life-\r\nsaving needs. An upgraded CERF should provide a \r\nuseful addition to existing fast-track disbursement \r\nprocedures, such as those provided by the European \r\nCommission’s Humanitarian Aid Office. \r\n The persistent underfunding of some \r\nemergencies, particularly in Africa, is especially \r\nconcerning. The proposal that the upgraded CERF \r\naddress critical humanitarian needs in underfunded \r\nemergencies is therefore welcome.  \r\n On coordination capacity, often a complex \r\nchallenge, the response to recent disasters has shown \r\nthat there is always room for improvement. In that \r\ncontext, one particular aspect to which the EU attaches \r\ngreat importance is the quality of humanitarian \r\ncoordinators. Further efforts must be made to improve \r\nthat critical function, especially in terms of training \r\nand support, and the right incentives must also be \r\nprovided to attract the best people for that crucial job. \r\nFurther efforts must also be made to improve the \r\nquality of, and therefore donor confidence in, the \r\nUnited Nations Consolidated Appeals Process. The \r\nProcess must provide for a more inclusive and better \r\ncoordinated assessment of need, and the projects \r\ncontained therein must be better prioritized. \r\n As donor Governments, we also recognize that \r\nwe need to enhance coordination amongst ourselves. \r\nThat is why we are committed to the Good \r\nHumanitarian Donorship initiative. It provides an \r\nunparalleled opportunity to promote innovation and \r\ngood practice in the way in which aid is provided and \r\nto enhance the predictability, adequacy and flexibility \r\nof humanitarian financing. \r\n Lessons learned are also an important part of \r\nensuring a more effective and predictable humanitarian \r\nresponse. In that respect, the European Union \r\nwelcomes the Humanitarian Response Review. It has \r\nhelped identify a number of gaps and weaknesses in \r\nthe international response system, and we are pleased \r\nthat the recommendations are now being actively \r\npursued. In particular, the EU welcomes work already \r\nunder way in identifying cluster, or sectoral, bids. We \r\nbelieve that is especially important in terms of ensuring \r\nsectoral capacity and leadership. \r\n There are also a number of lessons to be learned \r\nin the use and coordination of military and civil \r\ndefence assets. In some cases, the logistical support \r\nand expertise associated with such assets can prove \r\n A/60/PV.51\r\n \r\n05-60137 13 \r\n \r\ninvaluable in terms of transporting relief assistance and \r\nin reaching remote and vulnerable communities.  \r\n The European Union fully accepts the need to \r\nmake the international humanitarian system more \r\npredictable and effective in its response, including \r\nthrough lessons learned and the implementation of \r\nexisting commitments. But those efforts will be in vain \r\nif we cannot ensure better respect for international \r\nhumanitarian law, as well as reliable access and \r\nprotection for civilians in need and for humanitarian \r\nworkers. We strongly condemn attacks and acts of \r\nviolence on humanitarian workers, which jeopardize \r\nnot only their safety, but also the sustainability of relief \r\noperations. Such incidents must be immediately and \r\neffectively investigated and the perpetrators of such \r\nacts brought to justice. \r\n Finally, this past year in particular has posed \r\nmany challenges to the humanitarian community. We \r\nhave not always risen to the challenge. We must \r\ntherefore continue our efforts to improve the \r\neffectiveness and the predictability of humanitarian \r\nresponse. The European Union is determined to play its \r\npart to that end.  \r\n Ms. Rouse (Grenada): I have the honour to \r\nspeak, on behalf of the States members of the \r\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM) that are Members \r\nof the United Nations, on agenda item 73 (a), \r\n“Strengthening of the coordination of humanitarian and \r\ndisaster relief assistance of the United Nations, \r\nincluding special economic assistance: strengthening of \r\nthe coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance \r\nof the United Nations”. \r\n The CARICOM members wish to associate \r\nthemselves with the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of Jamaica on behalf of the Group of 77 \r\nand China on this agenda item. \r\n The heads of State and Government, during the \r\n2005 world summit, were in one accord regarding the \r\nrole of the United Nations in the twenty-first century. \r\nThey reminded us that the problems facing the world \r\nhad multiplied, natural disasters being one of them. We \r\nwere also requested to seek new and innovative ways \r\nto deal with those problems, and hence we welcome \r\nthe Secretary-General’s reports on this agenda item. \r\n We wish to make particular reference to the \r\nSecretary-General’s report, contained in document \r\nA/60/432, on the improvement of the Central \r\nEmergency Revolving Fund (CERF), especially the \r\ncall to address critical humanitarian needs in \r\nunderfunded emergencies. We applaud the proposal put \r\nforward by Mr. Jan Egeland, Under-Secretary-General \r\nfor Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief \r\nCoordinator, for renaming the upgraded Fund as the \r\nCentral Emergency Response Fund. We fully support \r\nefforts in the area of natural disaster mitigation, \r\nespecially in the light of recent global trends. In \r\ncommending the Emergency Relief Coordinator and \r\nhis staff on their excellent performance thus far, we \r\nrecognize the very difficult task which they face and \r\nresolve to continue our support for that department. \r\n We recall General Assembly resolution 46/182 of \r\n19 December 1991, which states that  \r\n “International relief assistance should supplement \r\nnational efforts to improve the capacities of \r\ndeveloping countries to mitigate the effects of \r\nnatural disasters expeditiously and effectively and \r\nto cope efficiently with all emergencies. The \r\nUnited Nations should enhance its efforts to \r\nassist developing countries to strengthen their \r\ncapacity to respond to disasters, at the national \r\nand regional levels, as appropriate.” (resolution \r\n46/182, para. 18) \r\n CARICOM member States are indeed pleased \r\nthat the United Nations agencies have continuously \r\nprovided necessary assistance over the years and we \r\nmust pay particular tribute to the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme in the Caribbean for its \r\nsterling support. However, with the increased \r\nmagnitude and frequencies of disasters in the region, \r\nwe recognize the need for further collaboration with \r\nother regional agencies. \r\n The 2005 world summit resolved to fully \r\nimplement the Hyogo Declaration and the Hyogo \r\nFramework for Action 2005-2015, adopted at the \r\nWorld Conference on Disaster Reduction, in particular \r\nthose commitments related to assistance to developing \r\ncountries that are prone to natural disasters and \r\ndisaster-stricken States in the transition phase towards \r\nsustainable physical, social and economic recovery, for \r\nrisk reduction activities in post-disaster recovery and \r\nrehabilitation processes. We now have to ensure that \r\nthis resolve is translated into action. \r\n The CERF report clearly shows that the \r\nconsolidated and flash appeals have been insufficient \r\nin meeting the needs of the various crises and \r\nA/60/PV.51  \r\n \r\n14 05-60137 \r\n \r\nemergencies. The mechanism must be able to disburse \r\nfunds in a rapid and transparent manner with the \r\nprimary aim of saving lives and providing immediate \r\nhumanitarian relief. \r\n It is clear to this body that, in the near future, \r\nincreased resources for rapid deployment of relief will \r\nbe required and that it will therefore be necessary to \r\nestablish not only a source of readily available funding, \r\nbut proper mechanisms to ensure immediate access to \r\nthose funds by disaster-stricken States. \r\n CARICOM has noted with dismay the poor \r\nresponse to appeals following recent disasters in the \r\nCaribbean region, as was experienced by Grenada and \r\nGuyana, where the destruction impacted heavily on \r\ntheir economies. It saddens me to say that, to date, only \r\na minor percentage of the pledges have been fulfilled. \r\n CARICOM member States have, at several world \r\nsummits and conferences, stressed the need for special \r\nand differential treatment for small island developing \r\nStates due, in great part, to our vulnerability to natural \r\ndisasters. The Secretary-General, in his report “In \r\nlarger freedom”, also made reference to the \r\nenvironmental and development challenges facing us in \r\nthe form of climate change, recognizing that the \r\ncountries that were most vulnerable included small \r\nisland developing States. \r\n We find ourselves in a unique position. Apart \r\nfrom our size, we are for the most part island States, \r\nand a region which is often visited by disasters brought \r\nabout by wind, water or other forces of nature that \r\nthreaten our very existence. We therefore make a \r\nsolemn appeal to members of this body to join hands \r\nwith us and work towards arriving at solutions to \r\nminimize the effects of those disasters, from which we \r\nhave no means of escape. Small island States \r\ncontinually run the risk of being forgotten by the media \r\nand, in turn, by the international community, since our \r\nsize does not attract sufficient attention. When Grenada \r\nwas hit by Hurricane Ivan in September of 2004, it was \r\nthe entire 344 square-kilometre island, with its 100,000 \r\ninhabitants, that sustained damage. All were affected. \r\nWe are fully aware that preparedness is necessary. \r\nHowever, since we cannot prevent the disaster or \r\npredict its magnitude, the recovery process is therefore \r\nof paramount importance. \r\n Disaster management is a complex portfolio, and \r\nthough most countries have an established national \r\ndisaster management agency, the magnitude of the \r\ndisaster is sometimes way beyond their capabilities — \r\nhence the apparent state of paralysis which follows. We \r\ntherefore welcome immediate intervention by the \r\nUnited Nations agencies when they are called upon to \r\nassist in such situations. \r\n CARICOM wishes to commend those States that \r\nhave pledged contributions to the Fund and encourage \r\nthose that are in a position to do so to join the \r\ncontributors’ list. We are also grateful to those \r\ncountries that have taken concrete steps in disaster \r\nmitigation and are working with CARICOM in that \r\nregard. CARICOM is pleased to lend its support to the \r\nupgraded Fund and to endorse the addition of a grant \r\nfacility of $450 million, targeted at a total of $500 \r\nmillion, to be operational by early 2006. We also \r\nendorse the establishment of an advisory group of 12 \r\nexperts, broadly representative of the humanitarian \r\ndonor community, as well as technical expertise from \r\ncountries affected by crises. We believe that that \r\ncomposition would contribute to a more balanced \r\napproach and be able to achieve better results. \r\n We support the need for transparency, \r\naccountability and visibility of the Fund, the active \r\ninvolvement and guidance of the General Assembly, \r\nand the suggested annual CERF donors consultation in \r\norder to keep relevant partners updated and for \r\nnecessary review. We are confident that, with strong \r\nand dedicated support from Member States, the newly \r\nrevived Fund will be able to provide timely and more \r\neffective response to humanitarian emergencies. \r\n In conclusion, CARICOM States resolve to work \r\nclosely with the Emergency Relief Coordinator and \r\nother United Nations agencies to ensure the success of \r\nthat new venture to strengthen the coordination of \r\nhumanitarian and disaster relief assistance. \r\n Mr. Siv (United States of America): I thank the \r\nSecretary-General for his comprehensive reports on \r\nhumanitarian assistance. They help us to maintain \r\nattention on continuing needs and to explore how the \r\nUnited Nations system can better work to meet them. \r\nAs a prominent contributor and participant in \r\nhumanitarian action throughout the world, the United \r\nStates recognizes many successes in saving lives and \r\nreducing suffering, but we also clearly see areas where \r\nthe international community can improve its collective \r\nresponse.  \r\n In the past year, we have faced tremendous \r\nchallenges. Protracted civil conflicts have provoked \r\n A/60/PV.51\r\n \r\n05-60137 15 \r\n \r\nsome of the largest occurrences of forced displacement \r\nin recent times. Natural disasters have also had a \r\ndestructive impact of exceptional scale. This year’s \r\nhurricane season hit my country very hard. I thank the \r\nUnited Nations and the international community for the \r\ngenerous contributions to the relief effort in the south-\r\neastern Gulf States. \r\n The international community, with United \r\nNations leadership, has met many of the challenges in \r\nthe past year, but humanitarian needs continue to \r\nrequire our collective will and capacity to provide a \r\nmore efficient and effective response, both at the \r\nmanagement and technical levels. Within the broader \r\ncontext of United Nations reform, much discussion has \r\nrevolved around ways to improve the United Nations \r\nhumanitarian response system. The United States \r\nsupports a stronger and more effective response in \r\nhumanitarian crises. \r\n We have followed with interest the proposal for \r\nan improved Central Emergency Revolving Fund \r\n(CERF). We believe that a centralized source of rapidly \r\navailable funding could help effectively address urgent \r\nneeds in rapid-onset emergencies and swiftly \r\ndeteriorating crises. We look forward to further \r\ndiscussion on the operational modalities of the \r\nenhanced CERF and on how the Fund links to other \r\ninitiatives, such as the Consolidated Appeals Process \r\nand the effort to standardize assessment \r\nmethodologies. The approach to humanitarian reform \r\nshould be comprehensive, aligning the benefits of the \r\nCERF alongside initiatives to broaden the donor base, \r\nsecure additional voluntary resources, strengthen early \r\nwarning systems, bolster response capacity, and \r\nenhance the overall coordination of disaster relief and \r\nmitigation efforts. \r\n Financial resources are critical to addressing \r\nhumanitarian needs, but effective response requires \r\nexperienced humanitarian personnel on the ground \r\nmaking tough decisions, coordinating numerous actors \r\nand ensuring that the aid reaches persons most in need. \r\nAdditionally, humanitarian personnel work in \r\nenvironments filled with enormous challenges, \r\nincluding lack of access, insecurity and difficult \r\nlogistics. Those obstacles require that we prepare for \r\nand anticipate emergencies before they begin by \r\ntraining staff, increasing agency capacity to absorb \r\nadditional funding, and better equipping responders to \r\noperate in challenging environments. \r\n One clear lesson from the past year is that the \r\nUnited Nations system must be able to shift into \r\nemergency mode smoothly and efficiently when a \r\nsituation deteriorates. The various operational \r\ncomponents of the United Nations must be able to \r\nrapidly implement relief activities. \r\n We have followed with equal interest recent \r\ndiscussions on reinforcing United Nations leadership \r\nfor specific sectors of humanitarian activity — sectors \r\nthat have historically suffered from ad hoc \r\ncoordination and direction. We applaud initial efforts in \r\nthat area and believe that, together, we can enhance the \r\ninternational response to meet needs in those critical \r\nsectors. \r\n Perhaps the most pressing of those, and one that \r\ntoo often falls into a gap without sufficient leadership, \r\nis the protection of persons affected by natural \r\ndisasters and civil strife. We support more coherent \r\nUnited Nations leadership in that area. Protection is a \r\ncomplex issue and involves a range of United Nations \r\noffices, other international organizations, the Red \r\nCross and Red Crescent Movement, and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations. Within the United \r\nNations, we believe that recent refinements to the \r\ncollaborative approach strengthen the framework for \r\naddressing the assistance and protection needs of \r\ninternally displaced persons, and we challenge United \r\nNations agencies to work further towards that goal. \r\n The ability to provide protection to vulnerable \r\npopulations is also closely linked to the safety of relief \r\nworkers. Initiatives to enhance funding mechanisms \r\nand clarify leadership roles will seem extraneous if we \r\nfail to safeguard the basic security of humanitarian \r\npersonnel. The United States applauds the efforts of \r\nhumanitarian workers throughout the world and \r\nrecognizes that their daily work brings relief and hope \r\nto millions of people in need. We must do everything \r\nwe can to ensure that humanitarian personnel are able \r\nto continue their invaluable work without becoming the \r\nvictims or the targets of conflict. In the past few \r\nmonths, we have seen humanitarian workers come \r\nunder direct attack in Darfur and northern Uganda. \r\nThat cannot be tolerated. The United States is \r\ncommitted to strengthening the security and safety of \r\nhumanitarian personnel, and we view the measures \r\ntaken by the General Assembly as important steps in \r\nallowing United Nations personnel and other \r\nhumanitarian workers to continue their critical work. \r\nA/60/PV.51  \r\n \r\n16 05-60137 \r\n \r\n I would like to express our appreciation to the \r\nOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs — \r\nwhich you, Mr. President, once led with distinction and \r\nwhich is now under the leadership of Under-Secretary-\r\nGeneral Jan Egeland — the other United Nations \r\nhumanitarian agencies and fellow Member States for \r\nstriving to seek improvements in the coordination of \r\nhumanitarian assistance. As we continue those \r\ndiscussions, we must not address elements of \r\nhumanitarian reform in isolation. Its components \r\nconstitute a package that helps ensure that the \r\nallocation of resources is driven by solid needs \r\nassessments and prioritizations. \r\n We reaffirm our support for the core humanitarian \r\nprinciples of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and \r\nindependence. They provide the foundation for \r\ninternational humanitarian work and must continue to \r\nguide our efforts, especially as we strive to address the \r\nrange of challenges we face today. Let us not lose sight \r\nof those straightforward yet profound values as we \r\nwork together to strengthen humanitarian assistance to \r\nhelp the millions of people in need around the globe. \r\n The United States is the largest single donor to \r\nhumanitarian and development programmes that \r\nbenefit the Palestinian people. Working within the \r\nUnited Nations system, our substantial financial \r\ncontribution to the United Nations Relief and Works \r\nAgency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East \r\n(UNRWA) amounted to $108 million in 2005. Since \r\n1998, we have contributed $588 million to UNRWA’s \r\nGeneral Fund in support of its educational, health, and \r\nemployment programmes serving 4.2 million \r\nPalestinian refugees. \r\n In addition, through the United States Agency for \r\nInternational Development (USAID), we have provided \r\nmore than $1.7 billion in economic assistance since \r\n1993. USAID operates six programmes for the benefit \r\nof the Palestinians: the promotion of democratic \r\nreform, infrastructure and water resources, the \r\nrevitalization of the private sector, community \r\nservices, health and training, and higher education. The \r\nUnited States encourages other countries, especially \r\ncountries from the region, to increase their \r\ncontributions to UNRWA’s core budget and to other \r\nhumanitarian and economic needs in that area. \r\n The President: I particularly want to bring to the \r\nAssembly’s attention the important work being done in \r\nthe Sixth Committee on the safety and security of \r\nhumanitarian personnel. I hope that we can conclude \r\ndiscussions soon and, by so doing, send a strong \r\nmessage on the importance of assuring the security and \r\nthe safety of personnel serving the peoples around the \r\nworld. \r\n Mr. Ozawa (Japan): Japan believes that a holistic \r\nand comprehensive approach is necessary in our efforts \r\nto strengthen the coordination of humanitarian and \r\ndisaster relief assistance of the United Nations. \r\nFunding arrangements are an important part of the \r\nissue, but we should put this matter in the perspective \r\nof the overall picture. \r\n We congratulate the Secretary-General for his \r\nbold report concerning the improvement of the Central \r\nEmergency Revolving Fund (CERF) (A/60/87). We \r\nalso commend Under-Secretary-General Jan Egeland \r\nfor his efforts to elaborate on the details of the \r\nproposal in his discussions with all regional groups. In \r\nessence, the proposal argues for a drastic \r\ntransformation of the existing CERF. We are not ready \r\nto make pledges with respect to a reformed CERF, but \r\nwe understand the good intentions behind the ideas and \r\nsee some merits in the proposal. Japan will continue to \r\nparticipate seriously in the forthcoming discussions on \r\nthat matter. \r\n Japan believes that reform is also necessary in the \r\nareas of needs assessment and common strategy for \r\nhumanitarian assistance. Without progress on those two \r\nfronts, an effective response is not really possible, even \r\nif there were sufficient financial resources and \r\nadequate assistance capacity.  \r\n The Niger food crisis is a case in point. The \r\nproblem of insufficient funding has been aggravated by \r\nthe tension between development policy goals on the \r\none hand and humanitarian assistance requirements on \r\nthe other. That tension hampered free food distribution \r\nfor fear of distorting the local economy.  \r\n We have often discussed the gap between \r\nemergency relief and development. We think that this \r\nmay not be a linear sequence of events. Even in a \r\nsituation where efforts are focused on longer-term \r\ndevelopment, emergency relief may sometimes be \r\nneeded, as we saw in the case of the Horn of Africa. \r\nWe welcome intensified dialogue between \r\nhumanitarian and development actors on ensuring \r\ntimely needs assessment and achieving a common \r\nstrategy for humanitarian assistance. In addition, in \r\norder to assess needs accurately, it is necessary to \r\n A/60/PV.51\r\n \r\n05-60137 17 \r\n \r\nensure the participation of all stakeholders, including \r\nnon-governmental organizations. \r\n Japan also attaches great importance to the \r\nimprovement of the coordination mechanism, in \r\nparticular to the ongoing discussion on the cluster lead \r\nand the strengthening of the role of humanitarian \r\ncoordinators. We welcome the recommendations of the \r\nHumanitarian Response Review on filling those gaps in \r\nthe existing arrangements where responsibility for \r\ncertain vital sectors for humanitarian assistance and \r\nprotection remains unclear.  \r\n At the same time, the proposed cluster lead would \r\nrequire thorough discussion among humanitarian \r\nactors, including non-governmental organizations, as \r\nwell as by the governing boards of all humanitarian \r\nentities, especially in terms of the proposal’s impact on \r\ntheir core mandate. We hope that the Member States \r\nare kept up to date through consultations in the Inter-\r\nAgency Standing Committee. We believe it is also \r\nimportant to strengthen the role of humanitarian \r\ncoordinators while at the same time fully reflecting the \r\nviews of humanitarian workers, especially those on the \r\nground. \r\n Japan believes that engagement with emerging \r\ndonors and the private sector needs to be further \r\npromoted with a view to expanding the financial \r\nresources available for humanitarian assistance. We \r\nneed to consolidate the positive trend observed in the \r\nresponse to the Indian Ocean tsunami and the \r\nearthquake in Pakistan by promoting even closer \r\ndialogue with those contributors that used to be outside \r\nthe humanitarian circle. In that regard, it might be \r\nworth considering, when a major humanitarian crisis \r\noccurs, setting up a briefing session in a format open to \r\nall Member States, possibly using the framework of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council. \r\n Last but not least, Japan wishes to emphasize the \r\nimportance of prevention and preparedness, especially \r\nin the context of natural disasters. The Hyogo \r\nDeclaration and the Hyogo Framework for Action, \r\nadopted in January of this year, urge us to integrate risk \r\nreduction into post-disaster recovery and development \r\nstrategies. Allocating relatively small amounts of \r\nresources to prevention and preparedness can lead to \r\ntremendous savings in terms of human lives and \r\nproperty. \r\n I wish to conclude by expressing my \r\nGovernment’s deep appreciation to all humanitarian \r\nworkers, especially those on the ground helping people \r\nin need under difficult conditions. \r\n Mr. Amorós Núñez (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nAt the outset, Cuba associates itself with the statement \r\nmade by the delegation of Jamaica on behalf of the \r\nGroup of 77 and China. \r\n Over the years, in the consideration of issues \r\ninvolving humanitarian assistance, priority has been \r\ngiven to complex emergencies, while natural disasters \r\nhave been held to be of secondary importance. The \r\npeoples of various brotherly countries of the Indian \r\nOcean basin had to suffer a catastrophe of enormous \r\ndimensions before United Nations action on that issue \r\nbegan to be reassessed. \r\n The impact of the current hurricane season on the \r\nCaribbean Basin, the Gulf of Mexico and Central \r\nAmerica and the disastrous effects of the most recent \r\nSouth Asian earthquake require a radical change in the \r\nmode of planning and coordinating humanitarian \r\nassistance in the United Nations system. Under these \r\ncircumstances, we must reaffirm the validity of the \r\nprinciples of humanity, neutrality and impartiality \r\nenshrined in General Assembly resolution 46/182. \r\n Although nature’s fury does not distinguish \r\nbetween developing and developed countries, the \r\nconsequences of the series of natural disasters in recent \r\nyears reflect as never before the grave crisis underlying \r\nthe international sustainable development agenda — a \r\ncrisis faced by the countries of the third world, who \r\nsuffer the ravages of the unjust conditions resulting \r\nfrom the current international order, which undermines \r\nnational capacities to respond immediately to the \r\nenormous challenges posed by the effects of natural \r\ndisasters. \r\n It is therefore essential that humanitarian \r\nassistance be accompanied by a serious and \r\nunconditional commitment to economic growth and \r\nsustainable development in developing nations. \r\nWithout that, contributions for humanitarian \r\nassistance — which must not be earmarked — only \r\nserve to undermine resources destined for international \r\ncooperation for development. \r\n The current situation requires that the transition \r\nfrom relief to development receive the attention it \r\ndeserves. Major efforts by the international community \r\nwill be needed to enable those recovering from the \r\ndamage caused by natural disasters to recommence \r\nA/60/PV.51  \r\n \r\n18 05-60137 \r\n \r\ntheir national plans for viable economic growth and to \r\ncontinue making progress towards sustainable \r\ndevelopment, which will generate the resources needed \r\nfor a long-term response to the earthquake\u0027s \r\nconsequences. \r\n In that connection, it will be crucial to undertake \r\nmeasures to restore socio-economic activity in the \r\naffected communities, such as cancelling, significantly \r\nrelieving or rescheduling external debt, providing \r\ncountries with a grace period that will help accelerate \r\ntheir relief, reconstruction and development efforts; \r\npromoting a common effort among various new and \r\nadditional sources of financial resources for affected \r\nnations, including the international financial \r\norganizations, particularly the World Bank; and \r\ngranting trade facilities and temporary trade \r\npreferences for specific national products — \r\nparticularly those from disaster-affected areas — in \r\norder to help rebuild their productive capacities and \r\nsupport labour recovery. Other actions could be \r\ninitiated through UNICEF, UNESCO and other bodies, \r\nagencies, funds and programmes of the United Nations \r\nsystem to support disaster-affected children —\r\nparticularly those who have been orphaned — with the \r\naim of promoting their physical and mental \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Mr. Loizaga (Paraguay), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n The growing magnitude of the negative effects of \r\nnatural disasters requires the strengthening of national \r\nprevention, mitigation and preparation activities and \r\nthe implementation of the outcome of the second World \r\nConference on Disaster Reduction, held this year in \r\nJapan. However, international cooperation mechanisms \r\nmust also be strengthened. The experiences suffered as \r\na result of the hurricanes that battered the Caribbean \r\nBasin, the Gulf of Mexico and Central America \r\nconfirm that.  \r\n Assistance provided in solidarity with those who \r\nneed it is one of the essential pillars of our country’s \r\nforeign policy, and our cooperation programme has \r\nbeen ongoing for more than 40 years. In that spirit, and \r\nbecause of the impact of Hurricane Katrina, the Henry \r\nReeve International Contingent of Doctors Specializing \r\nin Disaster Situations and Serious Epidemics was \r\nestablished on 19 September 2005. Its members will \r\nprovide assistance to populations requesting it, not \r\nonly in natural disaster situations, but also in other \r\nemergency situations such as the outbreak of epidemics \r\nor to help in the global fight against HIV/AIDS. Henry \r\nReeve members have already gone to Pakistan to \r\nprovide medical assistance to the victims of the \r\nearthquake there and to Guatemala to aid the victims of \r\nHurricane Stan. \r\n Moreover, Cuban specialists will soon join the \r\nUnited Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination \r\nTeam. Cuba will contribute specialists and engineers, \r\nwho will share Cuban national experience in assistance \r\nand emergency aid efforts, and doctors to save lives, \r\nease pain, fight epidemics and provide essential health \r\nservices for those who have lost everything and suffer \r\nthe terrible effects of neglect. Their only reward will be \r\nto go home with the satisfaction of having done their \r\nduty. They will not demand the frivolous celebrity \r\nprovided by coverage in the major international media. \r\nIt is possible that they will receive no prizes or laurels \r\nfor their humanitarian efforts; that is not what they \r\nseek. The gratitude of those whom they will heal and \r\nsave will be enough for them. \r\n The selfless solidarity of Cuba, a small, \r\nblockaded country of the third world, should serve as \r\nan example to spur other, immensely rich States and \r\nthe international bodies to offer the necessary aid to \r\nthose whom nature has harshly affected. It can be done; \r\nthe suffering of the victims is in sharp contrast to the \r\ntrillion dollars wasted annually on all kinds of \r\narmaments. \r\n We need ongoing mobilization, a true spirit of \r\nhuman solidarity and a strong political commitment to \r\nsolve the basic problems fuelling the incontrollable \r\nforces of natural disasters. Until that has been \r\naccomplished, the efforts of the Office for the \r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Assistance will be in \r\nvain. \r\n Mr. Al-Shamsi (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in \r\nArabic): Allow me, at the outset and on behalf of the \r\ndelegation of the United Arab Emirates to thank the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly for his valuable \r\nefforts in directing the work of the present session. I \r\nshould also like to thank the Secretary-General for his \r\nvaluable reports on this agenda item. \r\n I wish to associate myself with the statement \r\nmade by the representative of Jamaica on behalf of the \r\nGroup of 77 and China. \r\n A/60/PV.51\r\n \r\n05-60137 19 \r\n \r\n The recent unprecedented natural disasters and \r\nthe magnitude of the destruction and death that they \r\nhave caused in both developing and developed \r\ncountries have undeniably proved two facts. First, \r\ndeveloping countries are not prepared to deal with \r\nnatural disasters. Thus the damage caused by such \r\ndisasters is considerable, and recovery from their \r\ndevastating effects is slow. Secondly, countries need \r\none another, regardless of their capacities. Hence, \r\ninternational cooperation is the safest and most \r\nappropriate solution to protect humanity from natural \r\ndisasters and from disputes and conflicts among \r\nindividuals and nations.  \r\n In that context, we would like to express our \r\nappreciation and gratitude for the work done by the \r\nUnited Nations and its personnel in the field of \r\ndelivering relief and humanitarian assistance, whether \r\nat Headquarters or at disaster sites, and we would \r\nunderline the principal role of the United Nations in \r\nstrengthening and coordinating long-term humanitarian \r\nand relief assistance to affected countries. \r\n In the meantime, we reaffirm the importance of \r\nimplementing the recommendations of international \r\nconferences on international coordination in facing \r\ndisasters, which call for the implementation of an \r\ninternational strategy that deals with natural disasters \r\nat all stages, from early warning to relief, \r\nreconstruction and development. Such an international \r\nstrategy must include the necessary measures required \r\nfor helping poor countries to build their institutional \r\ncapabilities and to address the consequences of natural \r\ndisasters and war. \r\n In that regard, we urge donor countries and \r\ninternational financing institutions to increase their \r\ncontributions in order to fund humanitarian and relief \r\nactivities, in fulfilment of the principles of \r\ninternational solidarity and interdependence, and in \r\naccordance with the Charter of the United Nations. We \r\nalso emphasize the importance of settling disputes \r\namong nations and of eliminating the causes of armed \r\nconflicts, which have created humanitarian disasters, \r\nby strengthening the authority and role of international \r\nlaw. \r\n The United Arab Emirates is one of the largest \r\ncontributors to relief assistance activities in the world, \r\nas it has effectively participated in regional and \r\ninternational efforts aimed at providing long-term \r\nhumanitarian and emergency relief assistance to all \r\nregions of the world. This has included providing \r\ncontributions to United Nations humanitarian and \r\ndevelopment assistance agencies and extending direct \r\nfinancial and in-kind assistance to countries affected by \r\nnatural disasters and armed conflicts, and for assisting \r\nin rehabilitation and reconstruction operations. \r\n Total contributions made during the 2004-2005 \r\nperiod by the Government of the United Arab Emirates \r\nand the country’s Red Crescent Society for \r\nreconstruction operations in Afghanistan, Iraq and \r\nsome occupied Palestinian cities and for finalizing the \r\nfifth stage of the Emirates Solidarity Program for mine \r\nclearance in South Lebanon — which was completed in \r\nMay 2004 and resulted in the removal of 61,829 mines \r\nin an area of 4 million square metres — have exceeded \r\n$500 million. \r\n The Government of the United Arab Emirates has \r\nalso assisted the victims of natural disasters in Iran and \r\nother countries of South-East Asia affected by the \r\ntsunami, as well as the victims of Hurricane Katrina \r\nand the recent earthquake in India and Pakistan. The \r\nGovernment has also extended direct development \r\nassistance to many developing countries through its \r\nnational organizations, such as the Abu Dhabi \r\nDevelopment Fund, which since its inception has \r\nprovided financial assistance totalling $5 billion to 56 \r\ncountries in the form of concessionary loans and \r\ngrants. \r\n The United Arab Emirates Red Crescent \r\nSociety — the largest non-governmental charity agency \r\nin the country engaged in providing relief and foreign \r\nassistance — has extended total assistance in the year \r\n2004 of 340 million dirhams, i.e. $100 million, to more \r\nthan 95 countries, including those affected by, or \r\nrecovering from, conflicts. The Society has also funded \r\nprojects for rebuilding a number of Palestinian cities in \r\nthe occupied territories for a total of $122 million. \r\n As part of its international efforts aimed at \r\nsupporting and coordinating humanitarian and relief \r\nassistance worldwide, the Government has established \r\na relief warehouse in the city of Dubai for the \r\nprovision of integrated services and facilities to \r\nnational and international humanitarian organizations. \r\nIt has recently established a supply warehouse for \r\nhumanitarian assistance in Dubai that is used for \r\nstoring pre-packaged American relief assistance \r\nmaterial for immediate delivery to affected areas. \r\nA/60/PV.51  \r\n \r\n20 05-60137 \r\n \r\n Following the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and \r\nthe evacuation of some West Bank settlements, the \r\ninternational community expected to see some \r\nimprovement in the tragic humanitarian conditions of \r\nthe Palestinians. However, more than two months later, \r\nPalestinian living conditions have deteriorated \r\nmiserably due to the continuing control of the Israeli \r\nforces over border checkpoints and commercial sites in \r\nPalestinian cities, as well as the continued imposition \r\nof repressive closure policies and restrictions on \r\nmovement. Moreover, the continuing attacks on \r\nPalestinian citizens and their property and the policies \r\nof collective punishment policies and extrajudicial \r\nkillings have resulted in the deaths of more than 4,000 \r\ninnocent civilians, and tens of thousands more have \r\nbeen injured or disabled. \r\n Moreover, Israel, the occupying Power, is \r\ncontinuing to build the illegal expansionist separation \r\nwall, which has resulted in the confiscation of \r\nPalestinian lands, the destruction of wells and an \r\nincrease in the number of internally displaced persons. \r\nThat has led to huge losses for the Palestinian \r\neconomy, an increase in the number of Palestinian \r\ncivilians, up to two thirds, who live under the poverty \r\nline, and the spread of malnutrition among large \r\nnumbers of children. \r\n According to international reports, the \r\ninternational humanitarian assistance provided to the \r\nPalestinians in the occupied territories is not adequate \r\nfor alleviating their suffering. This can happen only if \r\nthe Israeli occupation comes to a complete end and an \r\nindependent and viable Palestinian State is established. \r\nWe therefore call upon the international community \r\nonce again to force Israel to immediately stop its \r\nattacks against civilians and to end its policy of \r\nclosures and siege. It must cease building and \r\ndismantle the constructed part of the illegal \r\nexpansionist wall, in accordance with internationally \r\nbinding resolutions and the principles of international \r\nhumanitarian law, including the Fourth Geneva \r\nConvention and human rights instruments, and to \r\nwithdraw completely from all Arab territories occupied \r\nsince 1967, in accordance with the relevant \r\ninternational resolutions. In the meantime, we urge \r\ndonor countries and international financial institutions \r\nto continue providing necessary assistance to the \r\nPalestinian people until the Palestinian occupied \r\nterritories are liberated and an independent Palestinian \r\nState is established, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its \r\ncapital. \r\n Ms. Smith (Australia): Please allow me to begin \r\nby again extending the Australian Government’s \r\ncondolences to the people affected by the South Asian \r\nearthquake, particularly in Pakistan. \r\n The South Asian earthquake is the most recent in \r\na string of severe and devastating natural disasters, \r\nincluding the Indian Ocean tsunami and numerous \r\nhurricanes and cyclones. Australia, as a country that \r\nitself is prone to natural disasters, is acutely aware of \r\nthe threat they pose and of the importance of disaster \r\nmitigation and preparedness. If 2005 has taught the \r\nworld anything, it is that disaster mitigation and \r\nemergency preparedness must be an even higher \r\npriority and must be integrated into development \r\nplanning. \r\n In the year since we last met to discuss \r\nhumanitarian action, while there has been massive \r\ndevastation and loss of life, there have also been \r\nincredible stories of survival and resilience. We would \r\nlike to take this opportunity to congratulate the \r\ninternational humanitarian community for its efforts in \r\nrising to the unprecedented challenges it has faced over \r\nthe past 12 months. This includes in particular \r\nAustralia’s recognition of those national authorities \r\nthat have worked courageously towards rebuilding \r\ntheir communities, restoring human dignity and \r\nalleviating the suffering of their peoples. This, we \r\nthink, highlights the importance of building national \r\ncapacities within the humanitarian system. \r\n Australia continues to play its part in \r\nhumanitarian response. We provide rapid and generous \r\nsupport for the survivors of crises and disasters, both \r\nwithin our region and globally. Most recently, Australia \r\nhas provided assistance to Pakistan, and earlier this \r\nyear we responded rapidly to the Indian Ocean \r\ntsunami. \r\n Farther afield, we have also assisted the \r\nresponses to protracted crises in Africa, including in \r\nthe Sudan, the Niger, Malawi and in southern Africa \r\nmore broadly.  \r\n While the international system has responded to \r\nmany natural disasters over the past 12 months, those \r\ndisasters have also served to remind us just how crucial \r\neffective and timely humanitarian response capacity is, \r\n A/60/PV.51\r\n \r\n05-60137 21 \r\n \r\nif lives are to be saved, livelihoods protected and \r\ncommunities restored. \r\n I should also make clear that we recognize that it \r\nis not just in the case of natural disasters that the \r\nhumanitarian community must be able to respond, but \r\nalso in complex emergencies, where there are many \r\nunique challenges. The complex environments in \r\nwhich we undertake humanitarian action highlight the \r\nneed to continue to strive for a strengthened \r\nhumanitarian response. \r\n Strengthening humanitarian response is the key \r\nobjective of the current humanitarian reform agenda \r\noutlined by the Secretary-General and led by the Office \r\nfor the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). \r\nAustralia is a strong supporter of humanitarian reform. \r\nOur interest is in demonstrated results on the ground \r\nand our goal is to better enable affected communities to \r\nrebuild their lives and restore dignity. \r\n We seek to achieve this through increasingly \r\neffective application of resources and heightened levels \r\nof coordination and collaboration between partner \r\nGovernments and humanitarian institutions. Good \r\nprogress has been made in a number of areas. \r\nHowever, we should continue to strive for further \r\nimprovement. We encourage the United Nations to \r\ncontinue to build coordination and collaboration links \r\nduring quiet periods as well as during times of crisis. \r\n We agree with the key elements of the reform \r\nagenda. We need improved capacity, improved \r\ncoordination and improved financing. We see them \r\nvery much as an interdependent and interconnected \r\npackage. Each element is, if you will, a leg of a three-\r\nlegged stool. All elements of the agenda must be taken \r\nforward at the same time; none can stand alone. Our \r\nstool needs three strong legs. \r\n The Australian Government considers more \r\neffective coordination, in particular a stronger \r\nHumanitarian Coordinator system, essential to \r\nimproving response. We are eager to hear more from \r\nOCHA on the progress of this work. Similarly, steps to \r\nimprove the capacity of the system and of individual \r\nagencies to respond in key sectors is important — we \r\nare watching with interest the use of the sector lead \r\nmodel in Pakistan and are looking forward to an update \r\nfrom agencies on this and other efforts to improve \r\ncapacity. Finally, but no less important, we agree that \r\nhumanitarian financing has to be more timely and \r\npredictable. A key initiative to this end is the upgrade \r\nof the Central Emergency Revolving Fund (CERF). We \r\nsupport, in principle, the CERF; we are encouraged by \r\nthe contributions that donors have made to date and, \r\nsubject to further discussions on its operation, are \r\nconsidering an Australian contribution. \r\n We stand ready to work with OCHA, other \r\nhumanitarian agencies and other donors to ensure that \r\nour humanitarian reform stool is strong and sturdy. We \r\nalso continue to be strong and unequivocal supporters \r\nof the key principles of humanitarian action. We are \r\ncommitted to continuing to work with others to ensure \r\nthe protection of civilians, unimpeded access for \r\nhumanitarian actors and the importance of an effective \r\napproach to protect and provide assistance for \r\ninternally displaced persons. In this spirit, we \r\nencourage stakeholders to continue dialogue through a \r\ntruly collaborative framework to improve the \r\nrelevance, effectiveness and responsiveness of \r\nhumanitarian action. \r\n Finally, I would like to highlight the important \r\nissue of the transition from emergency support to \r\ndevelopment. The challenges of this phase cannot be \r\nunderestimated, as we have seen in the aftermath of the \r\ntsunami. Coordination, capacity and financing are also \r\ncritical during this period, and we must all work \r\ntogether to ensure that transition is managed as \r\neffectively as emergency response. \r\n Mr. Chulkov (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): This year is a special one for the \r\ninternational humanitarian community. We are on the \r\nthreshold of decisions that should qualitatively \r\nimprove existing mechanisms and instruments for \r\ninternational humanitarian cooperation. After more \r\nthan a decade, we once again draw the conclusion that \r\nadditional measures of a global nature are needed to \r\nenhance this work. \r\n In particular, we are discussing an important \r\naspect of international cooperation, namely the health \r\nand epidemiological consequences of disasters. Russia, \r\nwithin the context of its presidency of the Group of \r\nEight in 2006, intends to devote constant attention to \r\nthis question. \r\n In the aftermath of the disasters caused by \r\ndangerous natural phenomena that we have \r\nexperienced this year and last year, it has become clear \r\nthat practical steps are needed to strengthen the \r\ncapacity to react to disasters, so that upon requests \r\nfrom Governments we can quickly launch a \r\nA/60/PV.51  \r\n \r\n22 05-60137 \r\n \r\nhumanitarian operation in any part of the globe with \r\nthe right management capacity, on the basis of \r\npreliminary comprehensive needs assessments and \r\nmaking use of cutting-edge technologies and services \r\nin this area. \r\n In order to cope with this job effectively, Member \r\nStates need to improve humanitarian coordination \r\nmechanisms at all levels. We consider that assigning a \r\nUnited Nations Humanitarian Coordinator or Resident \r\nCoordinator with the appropriate authority to \r\ncoordinate the humanitarian agencies working in the \r\nfield would serve to provide a better humanitarian \r\nresponse. However, we believe that this work can be \r\neffective only if there is a strong partnership between \r\nthe United Nations country team and the host \r\nGovernment. The same also applies to post-conflict \r\npeacebuilding and rehabilitation, where the role of \r\nHumanitarian Coordinators and Resident Coordinators \r\nhas been reassessed. Their appointment in \r\nmultidimensional peacekeeping operations as Deputy \r\nSpecial Representatives of the Secretary-General in the \r\nfield can enhance effectiveness and the smooth \r\ntransition from a humanitarian assistance operation to \r\ndevelopment activities, which we see as a guarantee of \r\nsuccess for the whole set of efforts relating to \r\ninternational humanitarian activities, post-conflict \r\npeacebuilding and the establishment of a basis for \r\ndynamic socio-economic development. \r\n These measures cannot be taken without a change \r\nof attitude towards the question of funding \r\ninternational humanitarian activities. Stable access to \r\nfinancial resources is essential for expeditious and \r\nproper humanitarian disaster response and for dealing \r\neffectively and in a timely fashion with the \r\nconsequences of complex emergencies. And here we \r\nagree with the assessment of the Secretary-General, \r\nthat the current system for funding humanitarian \r\nactivities has placed certain restrictions on the ability \r\nof humanitarian organizations to mobilize quickly the \r\nresources they need. A source of predictable \r\nhumanitarian funding is needed to ensure timely \r\nassistance to those in need. Although we continue to \r\nregard the inter-agency consolidated appeals process as \r\nthe main mechanism for mobilizing financial \r\nresources, we agree that these goals can be achieved \r\nthrough a reorganization of the Central Emergency \r\nRevolving Fund, by adding a grant component. \r\n We support the basic parameters for the \r\nreorganization of the Fund as well as its objectives, \r\nwhich are to facilitate a rapid response to people’s \r\nneeds at the early stages of humanitarian operations \r\nand to give special attention to so-called forgotten or \r\nchronically underfunded emergencies. We agree with a \r\nphased approach to its reorganization. \r\n However, in order to give a certain degree of \r\nindependence to the functioning of the renewed Fund \r\nand the entire global humanitarian machinery, we think \r\nthat it is extremely important to have criteria on which \r\nthis work would be based, taking into account that we \r\nare talking about fundamental changes in its \r\nfunctioning. Accordingly, we deem it exceptionally \r\nimportant that these criteria be agreed upon within an \r\nopen-ended intergovernmental process. That would \r\nlend greater legitimacy to the future activities in the \r\noperational management of the Fund. \r\n The United Nations and its Office for the \r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) play a \r\nkey role in efforts to strengthen international \r\nhumanitarian cooperation. We believe that OCHA \r\nshould continue to give priority attention to the \r\nfundamental principles for the provision of \r\nhumanitarian assistance — that is, humanity, neutrality \r\nand impartiality, as well as independence. This fully \r\napplies to the challenges on the agenda of the \r\nhumanitarian community. We cannot allow situations \r\nto arise that would undermine the trust of Member \r\nStates in these principles. \r\n Nowadays, the need to forecast emergency \r\nsituations and for disaster preparedness is becoming \r\nincreasingly evident. Here, we support measures to \r\nstrengthen mechanisms for planning for and dealing \r\nwith emergency situations caused by disasters. We call \r\nfor stronger national systems for early warning, \r\ndamage assessment and the mitigation of the \r\nconsequences of disasters, as well as for more \r\ninternational cooperation in this area. All these \r\nmeasures were considered at the Hyogo World \r\nConference on Disaster Reduction held in January \r\n2005. \r\n We support the work being done by UNESCO \r\nand the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission \r\nto launch a regional Indian Ocean tsunami early \r\nwarning system. We view this system as an important \r\nstage in the establishment of a global disaster early \r\nwarning system. Accordingly, we look forward to the \r\nThird International Conference on Early Warning, to be \r\nheld Bonn next March. \r\n A/60/PV.51\r\n \r\n05-60137 23 \r\n \r\n This morning the representative of Belarus \r\nintroduced for consideration by the Assembly a draft \r\nresolution on the strengthening of international \r\ncooperation and coordination of efforts to study, \r\nmitigate and minimize the consequences of the \r\nChernobyl disaster (A/60/L.19). Nearly 20 years after \r\nthe tragedy, this problem is still very much with us, \r\nbecause the consequences of the disaster continue to \r\nnegatively impact upon people’s health and the \r\nenvironment and hamper the steady socio-economic \r\ndevelopment of the affected areas of Belarus, Russia \r\nand Ukraine. A key element of the policy of the \r\nRussian Government regarding Chernobyl is the \r\nconsistent integration of the radiation factor in \r\nactivities to ensure the full recovery of affected areas, \r\nthe cost of which, in our country alone over these \r\nyears, has exceeded $5 billion. \r\n This work has yielded results. The main emphasis \r\nnow is on the socio-psychological rehabilitation of the \r\npopulation and the creation of a solid foundation for \r\nthe sustainable development of the affected areas. A \r\nfirm scientific foundation for the recovery strategy is \r\nimportant for dealing successfully with the \r\nconsequences of the disaster. We are pleased that our \r\nown experience here is consistent with the conclusions \r\nof authoritative scientific forums. This applies, first of \r\nall, to the outcome of the Chernobyl Forum, which \r\ntook place in Vienna last September under the aegis of \r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). \r\nClearly, the recommendations of the Forum will be \r\nvery useful for us. However, I wish to emphasize that \r\nwork to test and to coordinate the results of scientific \r\nresearch will still be relevant in the future. \r\n International cooperation on Chernobyl is \r\nmultifaceted and, throughout all these years, has been \r\nof great practical importance. We are pleased with the \r\nattention given by the world community to this \r\nproblem through the development of scientific \r\ncontacts, the provision of assistance in the area of \r\npublic health, and the support we have received for our \r\nefforts to rehabilitate our agriculture and to establish \r\ninformation exchange networks. We would view the \r\nconsensus adoption of this draft resolution as a \r\ndemonstration of the solidarity of the international \r\ncommunity with the work of the affected countries and \r\nthe willingness to continue to give Chernobyl \r\nnecessary international attention. \r\n A special catalytic and coordinating role is \r\ntraditionally assigned to the United Nations here, \r\nparticularly to the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme, which last year assumed the functions of \r\ncoordinating international cooperation in this area. We \r\nexpress gratitude to the leadership of the Programme \r\nfor the high level of interaction in achieving our \r\ncommon goals to improve the lives of the people in the \r\naffected territories. \r\n We would also like to say from this rostrum that \r\nwe support the two other draft resolutions, on \r\nstrengthening emergency relief, rehabilitation, \r\nreconstruction and prevention, one in the aftermath of \r\nthe South Asian earthquake disaster (A/60/L.18), and \r\nthe other in the aftermath of the Indian Ocean tsunami \r\ndisaster (A/60/L.20). The Russian Federation is a \r\nsponsor of both, and we hope that all delegations will \r\nsupport all three draft resolutions currently being \r\nconsidered. \r\n Mr. Latheef (Maldives): The frequency and \r\nmagnitude of natural disasters occurring all over the \r\nworld are increasing at an alarming rate. Those that \r\noccurred in the past year alone are testimony to this \r\nreality. These disasters have caused immeasurable \r\ndevastation and taken a heavy toll in terms of human \r\nlives and property. The suffering and pain they leave \r\nbehind are deep and long-lasting. The burdens imposed \r\non individuals, communities and countries are \r\nenormous, and the challenges at the national and \r\ninternational levels are formidable. \r\n Natural disasters know no boundaries. They \r\nimpact indiscriminately on both the poor in the South \r\nand the rich in the North. Harsh weather conditions are \r\nexperienced by millions of peoples all over the world, \r\ncausing despair and suffering. However, the level of a \r\ncountry’s development has a bearing on the degree to \r\nwhich such suffering can be sustained. Small, less \r\ndeveloped countries such as my own suffer more \r\nseverely due to their weak infrastructure, limited \r\nresources and their inability to recover.  \r\n Although the loss of life and extent of damage in \r\nmy country in the wake of the Indian Ocean tsunami \r\nwere small in quantitative terms, compared to others \r\naffected by the disaster, it has now become evident that \r\nin economic and relative terms, the impact of the \r\ntsunami on the Maldives is far worse, primarily as a \r\nresult of the country’s narrow economic base. More \r\nthan 62 per cent of the gross domestic product was \r\ntotally destroyed, and development progress — a \r\nblessing over the past two decades — has now been \r\nA/60/PV.51  \r\n \r\n24 05-60137 \r\n \r\nthwarted. Over 7 per cent of the population remain \r\ninternally displaced, while a third of the entire \r\npopulation need help. Twelve islands need complete \r\nresettlement, while the socio-economic infrastructure \r\nmust be rebuilt in more than one quarter of the \r\ninhabited islands. \r\n As we approach the first anniversary of the \r\ntsunami disaster, the country’s situation has not \r\nimproved. It is now clear that it will take time for the \r\ncountry to regain the level of development progress \r\nthat it had enjoyed before the disaster struck.  \r\n Resettlement and rehabilitation of displaced \r\ncommunities remains a daunting task. Providing \r\npermanent shelter and rebuilding livelihoods require \r\ncareful community consultations in order to avoid any \r\ninvoluntary resettlement. This has been one important \r\nreason for slowing down the pace of implementing the \r\nprogramme. At the same time, the capacity of the \r\nGovernment, due to the limited human resources \r\navailable, as well as the logistical difficulties of inter-\r\nisland transportation, are also proving to be major \r\nhurdles in the implementation of the recovery and \r\nreconstruction programme. Proper training and \r\ntechnical assistance in local capacity-building is \r\ntherefore now a priority for us. \r\n There is also a major funding gap in our national \r\nrecovery and reconstruction programme. Of a total of \r\n$470 million estimated for the programme, nearly one \r\nthird has yet to be pledged. It should be noted that the \r\nMaldives is the only country experiencing an \r\nunpledged funding gap for tsunami recovery plans. \r\nWhile we express our sincere appreciation to our \r\ndevelopment partners and to the entire international \r\ncommunity for the most generous assistance that they \r\nhave already extended to us, we would like to call upon \r\nthe international community for further support to help \r\nus bridge this funding gap as soon as possible. \r\n Our economy, which had been growing at an \r\naverage of 7 per cent per annum during the past two \r\ndecades, is now expected to register a 3 to 4 per cent \r\nnegative growth rate this year. Rising oil prices, \r\nunforeseen tsunami-related expenditures and revenue \r\nshortfalls from the tourism sector are creating \r\nsignificant, alarmingly intense fiscal pressures. As a \r\ndirect result, we are now faced with an acute financial \r\ncrisis for the first time in our history, and we are forced \r\nto appeal for budgetary support from our partners and \r\nfriends. This assistance is in addition to the funding we \r\nrequire for our recovery and reconstruction efforts. \r\n Addressing the challenges unleashed by natural \r\ndisasters of such epic proportions requires urgent and \r\ntimely action by the international community on an \r\nepic scale as well. Shifting from emergency disaster \r\nresponse to more proactive disaster prevention, risk \r\nreduction and mitigation will, in our view, be the key \r\nto success. A more comprehensive and coordinated \r\napproach to disaster management needs to be \r\ndeveloped. Disaster risk management, rather than ad \r\nhoc humanitarian issues, should become an integral \r\npart of our long-term development policies. The full \r\nimplementation of the Hyogo Declaration and the \r\nHyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015 would, we \r\nbelieve, contribute to that end. \r\n We also call on the international community to \r\nmake every effort to ensure the setting up of the Indian \r\nOcean tsunami early warning system, as well as the \r\nworldwide multihazard early warning system, as soon \r\nas possible. My country, the Maldives, pledges its \r\nreadiness to do its utmost to make this a reality, since \r\nwe believe that such a system will not only save lives \r\nin such disasters but also help economies such as ours, \r\nwhich depend on tourism for their survival, to enhance \r\nconfidence in the industry. \r\n The central role of the United Nations in \r\nextending humanitarian and disaster relief assistance \r\ncannot be overemphasized. The rapid response of the \r\nUnited Nations in the wake of natural disasters last \r\nyear, in particular the Indian Ocean tsunami, was \r\nremarkable and deserves much praise, recognition and \r\nadmiration. The critical role being played by Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan and Under-Secretary-General and \r\nEmergency Relief Coordinator Jan Egeland and his \r\ndedicated staff at the Office for the Coordination of \r\nHumanitarian Affairs are worthy of mention. \r\n We believe that further strengthening the \r\nOrganization’s rapid response capacity should be a \r\npriority for the international community. Only a well-\r\nstaffed, well-funded and well-equipped system can \r\nensure the ability to respond promptly and effectively. \r\nIn this regard, the Maldives fully supports the proposal \r\nof the Secretary-General for improving the Central \r\nEmergency Revolving Fund, since we sincerely believe \r\nthat it would further contribute to strengthening the \r\nOrganization’s coordination and humanitarian response \r\ncapacity. \r\n A/60/PV.51\r\n \r\n05-60137 25 \r\n \r\n The Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for \r\nTsunami Recovery, His Excellency Mr. William \r\nJefferson Clinton, and his able team have brought a \r\nmuch-needed boost to the efforts of the United Nations \r\nto help the countries affected by the tsunami. We \r\nsincerely thank President Clinton for his untiring \r\ncommitment to this cause. \r\n Transparency, proper coordination and \r\naccountability are crucial for achieving better and \r\nfaster results. In this regard, my country is extremely \r\npleased with the work being done by the Global \r\nConsortium for Tsunami-Affected Countries, set up by \r\nSpecial Envoy President Clinton. We believe this \r\nimportant tool will help sustain the political will of the \r\ninternational community to support medium- and long-\r\nterm rehabilitation, reconstruction and risk reduction \r\nefforts by the affected countries. We are also happy \r\nwith the financial tracking system, known as the \r\nDevelopment Assistance Database, now in place in the \r\nregion, including the Maldives. We are convinced that \r\nit will ensure the much-needed financial transparency \r\nand accountability and boost the confidence of the \r\ndonor community and private contributors. \r\n International efforts in providing humanitarian \r\nassistance and disaster risk management need to be \r\nsupplemented at regional and subregional levels. \r\nRegional cooperation can play an important role in this \r\nregard. We are happy to note that in the South Asia \r\nregion, which has experienced two of the world’s worst \r\nnatural disasters in a matter of ten months, the \r\nthirteenth summit of the South Asian Association for \r\nRegional Cooperation (SAARC), which concluded \r\nyesterday in Dhaka, highlighted the importance of \r\ncooperating in disaster preparedness and disaster \r\nmanagement and decided to establish a regional \r\ndisaster management centre in India. We believe that \r\ncentre will boost confidence in the region and help \r\nrealize the early establishment of an early warning \r\nsystem. Thanks go to the Indian Government for taking \r\nthe initiative. \r\n Over the past two decades, the Government and \r\nthe hard- working people of the Maldives, with the \r\nmost generous help from the international community, \r\nhave transformed the Maldives into a vibrant country. \r\nAs members are aware, just six days before the tsunami \r\nstruck, the General Assembly decided to remove the \r\nMaldives from the list of Least Developed Countries, \r\nprimarily on the basis of the country’s performance in \r\ndevelopment. At that time, the country’s gross \r\ndomestic product was growing at a remarkable rate and \r\nour future looked very promising. We were also among \r\nthe few countries on track to achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. \r\n However, with the devastation caused by the \r\ntsunami, our situation has become very dire. Instead of \r\nproceeding with the smooth transition process after \r\nhaving graduated from the list of least developed \r\ncountries, we are now totally tied up in the enormous \r\ntask of recovery and reconstruction. We have no \r\nchoice. While it is difficult to determine an exact time \r\nframe required to reach pre-tsunami levels, we assure \r\nthe international community that we will once again, \r\nwith their generous assistance, recover and rebound \r\nfrom this disaster in the shortest possible time and \r\nproceed with the graduation process as recommended. \r\n We are most delighted that the international \r\ncommunity has heard our plea for help and has agreed \r\nto postpone the commencement of the smooth \r\ntransition period for three years, which we think is \r\nreasonable. We understand that the Assembly will take \r\nthe formal decision in that regard shortly. We sincerely \r\nthank the international community, the members here, \r\nfor the understanding and solidarity they have extended \r\nto us. \r\n Humanity has the power and ability to limit, \r\nmanage and prevent natural disasters. Ironically, it also \r\nhas the power to cause disasters. The tool we need to \r\nlimit, manage and prevent disasters is political will. If \r\nwe can fulfil just our commitment to protect and \r\npreserve the global environment, achieve sustainable \r\ndevelopment and reduce and eliminate poverty — a \r\ncommitment we have all undertaken at various \r\nsummits and conferences over the past decade — that \r\nwould, in our view, make a world of difference. \r\n Mr. Yao Wenlong (China) (spoke in Chinese): \r\nThe Chinese delegation would like to express its \r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for the reports he \r\nhas submitted under the current agenda item. We \r\nassociate ourselves with the statement made by \r\nJamaica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Here, \r\nI would like to make three points in connection with \r\nthis agenda item. \r\n First, with regard to strengthening the \r\ncoordination of United Nations humanitarian \r\nassistance, in recent years the world has been hit by \r\nfrequent major natural disasters. The Indian Ocean \r\ntsunami and the recent massive earthquake in South \r\nA/60/PV.51  \r\n \r\n26 05-60137 \r\n \r\nAsia took the lives of hundreds of thousands of people \r\nand resulted in huge losses to many countries. In \r\naddition, the floods, hurricanes, snowstorms, locust \r\ninfestation and droughts that have occurred across the \r\nglobe have caused widespread devastation and a loss of \r\nlivelihood for hundreds of millions of people. The \r\nfrequency of natural disasters has increased demands \r\nfor the humanitarian assistance provided by the \r\ninternational community and severely challenged the \r\ncapacity of the United Nations humanitarian assistance \r\nsystem. \r\n However, the level of relief operations in the \r\nwake of the Indian Ocean tsunami and the South Asia \r\nearthquake has demonstrated the immense potential of \r\nthe international community, as well as the important \r\nrole of the leadership and coordination of the United \r\nNations in that regard. The Chinese delegation \r\ncommends Under-Secretary-General Egeland and the \r\nOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs \r\n(OCHA) under his leadership, for their tireless efforts \r\nin securing emergency funding and in providing and \r\ncoordinating humanitarian assistance. We will, as \r\nalways, support the work of OCHA. \r\n Since more and more organizations and agencies \r\nare taking part in humanitarian assistance work, it \r\nbecomes ever more important that relief assistance to \r\ndisaster-affected countries and areas be well \r\ncoordinated. Therefore, it is necessary to further \r\nstrengthen the leading role of OCHA and the resident \r\ncoordinators for humanitarian assistance to enable \r\nthem to work effectively in coordinating the relief \r\nactivities of the relevant bodies and agencies of the \r\nUnited Nations system, non-governmental \r\norganizations and civil society. It is important to \r\nclearly define their respective responsibilities in order \r\nto reduce overlap and to help Governments of affected \r\ncountries make the best use of international assistance \r\nin their post-disaster relief, recovery and reconstruction \r\nefforts. \r\n Secondly, emergency humanitarian assistance \r\nentails substantial funding requirements. Both the \r\nCentral Emergency Revolving Fund (CERF) and the \r\nConsolidated Appeal Process, established in \r\naccordance with General Assembly resolution 46/182, \r\nhave played an important role in the last decade or so.  \r\n The CERF has guaranteed timely funding for \r\nrelief agencies so they may respond promptly to \r\nemergencies. The Consolidated Appeal Process has \r\nbeen an effective financing and planning mechanism \r\nfor United Nations humanitarian assistance agencies. \r\nHowever, the funding provided through that channel \r\nhas been steadily declining in recent years, severely \r\nhampering the relief, recovery and reconstruction \r\nefforts of disaster-affected countries. Here, the Chinese \r\ndelegation would like to appeal to donor countries that \r\nhave the means to do so to demonstrate generosity and \r\nmake more funds available for humanitarian assistance \r\nto disaster-affected developing countries, especially the \r\nleast developed countries. \r\n The recommendations for upgrading the CERF, as \r\nproposed by the Secretary-General in his report \r\n(A/60/432), are an important and integral part of the \r\nreform programme for humanitarian assistance \r\noperations and are of positive significance to the \r\nfurther strengthening of United Nations humanitarian \r\nrelief coordination and response capabilities.  \r\n Concerning the proposed Central Emergency \r\nResponse Fund, further details need to be articulated \r\nwith regard to the scale of financing in the grant \r\ncomponent, recommendations for loan and grant \r\nfacilities, the operation of the Fund, and its \r\nadministration and management procedures. It is very \r\nimportant that all countries show their support in that \r\nregard, and we hope that through joint efforts, the Fund \r\nwill be able to begin operations and achieve expected \r\nresults. \r\n Thirdly, strengthening international and regional \r\ncooperation is an effective means to respond to natural \r\ndisasters. When providing assistance to affected \r\ncountries, the international community should also pay \r\nattention to their capacity for dealing with natural \r\ndisasters. It is important to help central and local \r\ngovernments of disaster-affected countries build up \r\ntheir capacities in disaster prevention, relief and \r\nmanagement.  \r\n While ensuring that relief assistance is properly \r\ndelivered, attention should also be given to disaster \r\nprevention and reduction, including helping the \r\naffected countries develop medium- and long-term \r\nplans for disaster reduction and establishing national \r\nand regional mechanisms for the monitoring, \r\nprevention and assessment of major disasters.  \r\n The United Nations enjoys clear advantages in \r\nthe areas of disaster prevention, relief and reduction. It \r\nhas extensive experience in policy formulation and \r\nprogramme design and implementation and has well-\r\n A/60/PV.51\r\n \r\n05-60137 27 \r\n \r\nestablished mechanisms. Hence it should play a greater \r\nrole in the future. \r\n China is also a disaster-prone developing country. \r\nThis year, floods alone have affected more than 200 \r\nmillion people and resulted in direct economic losses \r\nof $17 billion. Even so, the Chinese Government has, \r\nto the extent of its capacity, provided emergency \r\nhumanitarian assistance to other disaster-stricken \r\ncountries. The Chinese Government provided \r\nassistance in kind and cash valued at $83.1 million to \r\ncountries affected by the Indian Ocean tsunami, \r\nincluding a $20-million donation provided through the \r\nUnited Nations multilateral system. In the immediate \r\naftermath of the massive earthquake that struck \r\nPakistan, the Chinese Government provided emergency \r\nhumanitarian assistance totalling $6.2 million in cash \r\nand kind and dispatched search-and-rescue teams to the \r\ndisaster areas. \r\n In addition, the Chinese Government has \r\nprovided $500,000 and relief goods worth 500,000 \r\nyuan through the United Nations system. All of that is \r\na clear demonstration of the sympathy, solidarity and \r\nfriendship of the Chinese Government and people with \r\nthe Governments and peoples of the affected countries. \r\nThe Chinese Government will continue, together with \r\nother countries, to actively participate in international \r\nand regional cooperation in disaster prevention, relief \r\nand reduction. We will do our part to help disaster-\r\naffected countries overcome natural disasters, rebuild \r\ntheir homes and return to normalcy. \r\n Mr. Chimphamba (Malawi): I have the honour \r\nto take the floor on agenda item 73(a) on behalf of the \r\nSouthern Africa Development Community (SADC) \r\nmembers Angola, Botswana, the Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo, Lesotho, Madagascar, Mauritius, \r\nMozambique, Namibia, the United Republic of \r\nTanzania, Swaziland, South Africa, Zambia, Zimbabwe \r\nand my own country, Malawi. \r\n Let me thank the Secretary-General for the \r\ninformative reports before the Assembly that ably \r\noutline the progress made and challenges remaining in \r\nthe efforts of the United Nations to coordinate and \r\nstrengthen humanitarian emergency assistance at all \r\nlevels. \r\n In the last 12 months alone, the entire global \r\ncommunity has witnessed a series of particularly large \r\nand destructive disasters requiring rapid and \r\ncoordinated humanitarian interventions. Those \r\ndisasters have reminded us all of the vulnerability of \r\nhuman life to natural disasters and also of the \r\ndisproportionate effects they have on poor people. \r\nClearly, more determined efforts are required to \r\naddress the loss of livelihoods and quickly bring the \r\nsituation back to normalcy. \r\n SADC would like to stress the importance of the \r\ndiscussions of humanitarian policies and activities in \r\nthe General Assembly and the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil. We would like to stress that the resolutions \r\nand decisions adopted in these meetings can be \r\nmeaningful only if Member States ensure their full \r\nimplementation. \r\n While acknowledging the various serious crises \r\nin other parts of the world, I would like to focus on the \r\ndrought-induced food insecurity situation in a number \r\nof SADC countries. The Secretary-General, in his \r\nreport contained in document A/60/89, notes that the \r\nhumanitarian community vowed after the 1992-1993 \r\ndrought that it would never allow a similar food \r\ninsecurity situation to happen again. However, a \r\ndecade later, a regional crisis of immense proportions \r\nhas happened again. \r\n Clearly, something was missed in the responses. \r\nOur view is that the United Nations response must be \r\neither entirely different or radically scaled up in order \r\nto make a difference in supporting national and \r\ncommunity capacities to enable a multisectoral \r\nresponse to the current and future humanitarian crises. \r\nWe also believe that communities and households must \r\nbe placed squarely at the centre of programme design, \r\nanalysis and implementation. SADC would like to \r\nrender its full support to the notion that the dichotomy \r\nof humanitarian and development assistance must be \r\novercome and replaced by more innovative and \r\nsimultaneous humanitarian and development action \r\nthat takes into consideration the short-term shocks and \r\nthe long-term challenges. \r\n In view of that, besides launching regional \r\nappeals for food aid, SADC is focusing on programmes \r\naimed at mitigating the food insecurity situation in the \r\nlong term, including operationalizing the Regional \r\nIndicative Strategic Development Plan and, in \r\nparticular, the formulation of the Food Agriculture and \r\nNatural Resources Business Plan. In addition, SADC is \r\nfocusing on increasing sustainable agricultural \r\nfinancing and investment in line with the African \r\nA/60/PV.51  \r\n \r\n28 05-60137 \r\n \r\nUnion Maputo Declaration on Agriculture and Food \r\nSecurity of July 2003. \r\n Over and above emergency interventions under \r\nthe Regional Humanitarian Strategic Framework for \r\nSouthern Africa, the humanitarian community is \r\nmounting its response through country-specific \r\ninitiatives, including flash appeals and consolidated \r\nappeals. A number of donor Governments have \r\nresponded favourably to the appeals and we are \r\ngrateful for that. Of concern, however, is the fact that \r\nthe appeals remain critically underfunded. We would \r\ntherefore like to appeal to the international community \r\nto urgently address the shortfalls. \r\n SADC applauds the Special Envoy for \r\nHumanitarian Needs in Southern Africa, Mr. James \r\nMorris, for the special work he is doing in raising the \r\nawareness of the international community on the \r\ncurrent situation and its underlying causes. We note \r\nwith appreciation the work done to develop the inter-\r\nagency regional humanitarian strategic framework for \r\nsouthern Africa. That is an initiative that needs the \r\nmeaningful support of the international community, \r\nespecially given that it takes short-term responses into \r\nconsideration, whilst preventing and mitigating future \r\nvulnerabilities. \r\n Indeed, the experience of the donor response to \r\nthe Indian Ocean tsunami of 26 December, 2004, \r\nclearly indicated that donors are capable of large-scale, \r\nfast and flexible response. It is our sincere hope that \r\nthe donor community will maintain the high standards \r\nso established as it goes about addressing any crisis, \r\nhumanitarian or otherwise, regardless of its magnitude. \r\n We recognize the important role of the Office for \r\nthe Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and \r\nwould like to urge it to continue to make efforts to \r\nbroaden its donor base. It is our view that the Office \r\nshould benefit from adequate and more predictable \r\nfunding. We therefore appeal to the donor community \r\nto support OCHA generously. \r\n SADC takes note of progress made by donors to \r\nimprove their policies and practices of good donorship, \r\nincluding under the Good Humanitarian Donorship \r\ninitiative. We believe that this is a positive initiative \r\nwhich, when implemented, should enhance the delivery \r\nof humanitarian assistance.  SADC would also like to \r\nunderline the importance of international cooperation \r\non humanitarian assistance in the field of natural \r\ndisasters, from relief to development. In that regard, \r\nwe would like to endorse the recommendations \r\ncontained in the Secretary-General’s report (A/60/227). \r\n We welcome the Hyogo Declaration and the \r\nHyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015: Building the \r\nResilience of Nations and Communities to Disasters, \r\nadopted at the World Conference on Disaster \r\nReduction, held in January 2005, which identifies \r\nstrategic objectives and priority areas to reduce disaster \r\nrisks in the next 10 years. \r\n In conclusion, we would like to emphasize the \r\nfact that humanitarian crises must be tackled with \r\ncommon actions and joint resolve. Existing capacity \r\ngaps need to be filled by strengthening existing \r\npartnerships and increasing the involvement of the \r\nprivate sector. \r\n Mr. Maurer (Switzerland) (spoke in French): We \r\nwelcome the holding of this annual debate on the \r\nstrengthening of the coordination of humanitarian \r\nassistance. We believe that a great deal has been done \r\nin this field in the past year, notably in emergency \r\nsituations of unprecedented size and complexity. We \r\nwould like to express our gratitude for the work done \r\nby humanitarian personnel on behalf of millions of \r\npeople in distress throughout the world. \r\n We would like also to thank Mr. Jan Egeland, \r\nUnder-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, and \r\nhis colleagues for the remarkable work undertaken and \r\nfor his continued leadership in the humanitarian field. \r\n Access to civilian populations and the security \r\nconditions in which humanitarian organizations operate \r\nremain largely unsatisfactory and very worrisome. It is \r\nclear that long-term efforts must be made to ensure \r\nstrict compliance with international humanitarian law \r\nby all the actors involved. We believe also that a \r\ndetermined and long-term commitment by the \r\ninternational community is necessary with respect to \r\ninternational policy in areas such as security, \r\nsustainable development and human rights. \r\n We are encouraged by the provisions on these \r\ntwo fundamental issues contained in the final outcome \r\ndocument of the High-level Meeting held in mid-\r\nSeptember, and we urge that they be implemented in a \r\nconcerted and determined manner by all Member \r\nStates. \r\n Proposals regarding the adjustment of \r\ninternational humanitarian aid capacities are currently \r\nunder discussion. Such proposals are welcome, and we \r\n A/60/PV.51\r\n \r\n05-60137 29 \r\n \r\nsupport the objectives specified. However, it is \r\nimportant that those objectives fully take into account \r\nthe diversity of the humanitarian system, the specific \r\nroles and mandates of International Movement of the \r\nRed Cross and Red Crescent institutions, and the role \r\nplayed by non-governmental organizations and by local \r\nand national actors. Given that emergency situations \r\ntake a variety of forms, we believe that such an \r\nadjustment process should, above all, enhance and \r\nstrengthen the collective response of all actors \r\ninvolved, taking account of their comparative \r\nadvantages, their mandates and their particular skills. \r\n With respect to the reform of the Central \r\nEmergency Revolving Fund (CERF), Switzerland has \r\nannounced its intention to make available to CERF, at \r\nthe appropriate time, the sum of 5 million Swiss francs. \r\nHowever, we believe that there is a need for more \r\ndetailed discussions with all stakeholders so as to \r\nclarify its parametres of action and its specific working \r\nprocedures, in particular its internal and external \r\naccountability mechanisms. \r\n The cluster approach also deserves to be tested on \r\nthe ground and the lessons learned in the \r\nimplementation phase — such as those drawn from the \r\ncurrent response to the earthquake that hit South Asia \r\non 8 October — should be rapidly incorporated in \r\norder to optimize the international response system. We \r\nencourage the organizations and countries concerned \r\nnot to overlook the central role that local and national \r\ncapacities can play in the context of humanitarian \r\nresponse. \r\n Moreover, while we support the humanitarian \r\ncoordinator system and an improved definition of that \r\nfunction within the United Nations country team, we \r\nwish also to stress the need to maintain the \r\nindependence of humanitarian action in the framework \r\nof integrated United Nations missions. In our view, it \r\nwould be useful also to further clarify the relationship \r\nbetween United Nations and non-United Nations \r\nmembers of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee at \r\nthe strategic and operational levels as well as on the \r\nground with regard to the establishment of \r\naccountability mechanisms. \r\n Finally, we would like to stress the importance \r\nthat Switzerland attaches to the preservation of a \r\nsystem of humanitarian assistance that is based on, and \r\nimplemented according to, the principles of \r\nimpartiality, neutrality and independence and whose \r\npurpose is to save lives and preserve human dignity in \r\nall circumstances. \r\n Mr. Laurin (Canada) (spoke in French): This \r\nyear, natural disasters of unprecedented scale and \r\nongoing conflicts have forced millions of people to \r\nseek humanitarian assistance. The Indian Ocean \r\ntsunami, the food crisis in the Sahel, the earthquake in \r\nSouth Asia and protracted conflicts such as those in the \r\nDemocratic Republic of Congo and the Darfur region \r\nof the Sudan are just a few of the crises that have \r\nstretched humanitarian response capacities to their \r\nlimits. These crises have also highlighted the \r\nundeniable need to prioritize disaster management and \r\nmitigation. \r\n Reinforcing the coordination of humanitarian \r\nassistance within the United Nations has long been a \r\nCanadian foreign policy priority. We therefore \r\nwelcome the efforts made over the past year to \r\nstrengthen the international humanitarian system, with \r\na particular focus on ensuring more a predictable, \r\ntimely and effective United Nations response. \r\n The humanitarian response review is an important \r\nundertaking that has spotlighted issues requiring \r\nimmediate solutions. It has made a number of useful \r\nrecommendations that require action on our part. We \r\nlook to the Office for the Coordination of \r\nHumanitarian Affairs (OCHA) to provide us with an \r\nintegrated humanitarian reform action plan outlining \r\nhow OCHA, along with the Inter-Agency Standing \r\nCommittee, will implement those recommendations as \r\nwell as those contained in the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport. \r\n We congratulate the Emergency Relief \r\nCoordinator and the Inter-Agency Standing Committee \r\non their efforts to advance the cluster approach. \r\nCanada enthusiastically welcomes any proposal aimed \r\nat improving existing structures by making them more \r\npredictable and more accountable. We look forward to \r\na more thorough dialogue with Member States on its \r\noperational and budgetary implications. The current \r\nsituation in South Asia provides an opportunity to see \r\nhow well this new approach will work. \r\n(spoke in English): \r\n Canada strongly supports the Secretary-General’s \r\nproposal to expand the Central Emergency Revolving \r\nFund (CERF) and appreciates the efforts made by \r\nOCHA to incorporate Member States’ views in the \r\nA/60/PV.51  \r\n \r\n30 05-60137 \r\n \r\nreport. We view the expanded CERF as one important \r\ntool to achieve more timely and equitable humanitarian \r\nfunding, an issue at the heart of good humanitarian \r\ndonorship. \r\n We intend to make a significant contribution to \r\nthe Fund in 2006. We are prepared to make multi-year \r\ncommitments to the CERF if we are satisfied with its \r\noperations in the first year and if we see continued \r\nimprovements in the Consolidated Appeal Process and \r\nthe needs assessments which underpin them. \r\n The CERF can only be as effective as the analysis \r\nthat guides its allocations. In order to allocate funds to \r\nwhere the needs are greatest, we have to agree on what \r\nthose needs are and how best to address them. There \r\nhave been efforts to strengthen humanitarian needs \r\nassessments over the past few years, for example \r\nthrough the Standardized Monitoring and Assessment \r\nof Relief and Transition (SMART) initiative. Canada \r\nbelieves we must refocus our energy on this issue to \r\nensure that scarce humanitarian resources are indeed \r\nbeing allocated where needs are greatest. \r\n There must also be a renewed commitment to \r\nstrengthen the Consolidated Appeal Process, which \r\nremains the most important tool for ensuring strategic, \r\ncoordinated and effective humanitarian response. There \r\nhave been significant improvements to the Process \r\nover the past several years, yet quality remains \r\ninconsistent. Neither of these two issues — CERF or \r\nthe Consolidated Appeal Process — was explicitly \r\naddressed in the Humanitarian Response Review, \r\nalthough addressing them is critical to ensuring more \r\neffective humanitarian action. \r\n Finally, let me underscore the importance of \r\nstrengthening the role and capacities of humanitarian \r\nand resident coordinators. This was highlighted in the \r\nHumanitarian Response Review, which made specific \r\nrecommendations for follow-up. Over the next year, we \r\nwould like to see clear progress in the selection and \r\ntraining of Humanitarian and Resident Coordinators. \r\n The Consolidated Appeal Process, the CERF and \r\nthe clusters are all tools that should enhance the \r\nhumanitarian response of the United Nations. Above \r\nall, these tools and the other components must form a \r\ncohesive whole that is more effective than the sum of \r\nits parts. We believe that ongoing commitment from all \r\nMember States — be they new or traditional donors — \r\nremains essential. \r\n It is important to stress that all of these \r\nimprovements will be of little consequence to affected \r\npopulations if we do not put the protection of civilians \r\nat the heart of the international agenda. There are still \r\ntoo many flagrant violations of international \r\nhumanitarian law, and impunity continues to be present \r\nin several conflicts. In too many conflicts civilians \r\ncontinue to pay the price, as do humanitarian workers. \r\nRampant sexual and gender-based violence remain a \r\nreality in a number of contexts. Consequently, while \r\nthe fifth anniversary of Security Council resolution \r\n1296 (2000) is coming to a close, the protection of \r\ncivilians remains a source of serious concern for \r\nCanada, which will continue to maintain its \r\ncommitment in this area. \r\n Let me conclude by reiterating Canada’s \r\ncommitment to continue working with the Emergency \r\nRelief Coordinator and Member States in strengthening \r\nthe humanitarian system. Let us make a collective \r\ncommitment to ensure that all our efforts lead to real \r\nchange in the lives of people affected by crisis \r\neverywhere. \r\n The meeting rose at 1.15 p.m. \r\n"
