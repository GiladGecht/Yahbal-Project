(Sweden)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Hamidon\r\n(Malaysia), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 73 (continued)\r\nStrengthening of the coordination of humanitarian\r\nand disaster relief assistance of the United Nations,\r\nincluding special economic assistance\r\n(a) Strengthening of the coordination of emergency\r\nhumanitarian assistance of the United Nations\r\nReports of the Secretary-General (A/60/86,\r\nA/60/87, A/60/89, A/60/227, A/60/302, A/60/432)\r\n(c) Strengthening of international cooperation and\r\ncoordination of efforts to study, mitigate and\r\nminimize the consequences of the Chernobyl\r\ndisaster\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/60/443)\r\nDraft resolution (A/60/L.19)\r\n(d) Assistance to the Palestinian people\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/60/90)\r\nMr. Aliyev (Azerbaijan): Recent humanitarian\r\nemergencies have demonstrated the overall capability\r\nof the humanitarian community to launch a massive\r\nresponse when called upon. However, it is quite\r\nobvious that the quality of response needs\r\nimprovement. Humanitarian response does not always\r\nmeet the basic needs of affected populations in a timely\r\nway. It varies considerably from crisis to crisis, and\r\ncurrent capacity levels are not always sufficient to\r\nmeet the demands of major emergencies occurring at\r\nthe same time. While some of the factors affecting the\r\nresponse are specific to individual crises, some of the\r\nkey challenges seem to be systemic in nature.\r\nThe Humanitarian Response Review has\r\ntherefore highlighted a number of well-known and\r\nlong-standing gaps that the international humanitarian\r\nsystem has failed to address so far, in particular the low\r\nlevel of preparedness of the humanitarian organizations\r\nin terms of human resources and sectoral capacity.\r\nFurthermore, the way in which humanitarian crisis\r\nresponse is funded affects the system’s ability to react\r\npromptly, effectively and in a principled and impartial\r\nmanner.\r\nAzerbaijan supports efforts to reform the existing\r\nhumanitarian response system. We share the view that\r\npredictable humanitarian funding is one of the key\r\nelements of the reform package. In this context, the\r\nidea of upgrading the current Central Emergency\r\nRevolving Fund (CERF) through the addition of a\r\ngrant element is of particular importance for ensuring\r\ntimely and effective response both in cases of newly\r\nemerging crises and in under-funded and protracted\r\ncrises.\r\n2\r\nA/60/PV.52\r\nWith regard to the latter, it is worth mentioning\r\nthat even the overall increase in global humanitarian\r\nfunding has not ensured an equitable humanitarian\r\nresponse in all parts of the globe, and funding\r\ncontinues to be concentrated on high-profile crises that\r\nenjoy significant political and media attention.\r\nTherefore, the idea of allocating one third of the\r\nupgraded CERF’s grant facilities for under-funded\r\nemergencies is commendable. We believe, however,\r\nthat clear and objective eligibility criteria based on\r\nneeds assessment must be elaborated in order to ensure\r\nthe equitable and balanced funding of such\r\nemergencies. The disbursement of the Fund should\r\ntake into account the existing imbalance in spending\r\namong regions, as well as among sectors.\r\nAs far as humanitarian coordination is concerned,\r\nthe effective coordination of the humanitarian response\r\nat the field level is of paramount importance. In our\r\nview, close cooperation and effective coordination\r\namong all stakeholders is crucial for ensuring the\r\nefficiency of the United Nations system-wide capacity\r\nand of short- and medium-term relief efforts. In this\r\nregard, strengthening support for, and the capacities of,\r\nthe resident humanitarian coordinators and United\r\nNations country teams is critical.\r\nIt is clear that national ownership in the design,\r\nimplementation and coordination of programmes in\r\nboth post-disaster and post-conflict situations is\r\nessential in order to ensure the desired impact of those\r\nprogrammes and their sustainability. However, efficient\r\nburden-sharing between national authorities and\r\ninternational humanitarian and development actors is\r\nneeded, in particular in protracted humanitarian\r\nsituations with mass displacement and limited national\r\ncapacities to tackle all existing problems.\r\nBetter coordination by the United Nations of\r\ninternational efforts on the ground is needed in order to\r\navoid unnecessary duplication and to increase the\r\nefficiency of activities overall in situations such as\r\nthose to which I have referred. Humanitarian assistance\r\nand funding should not be limited to providing\r\nimmediate response to crises, but should also take into\r\naccount long-term needs in the transition phase.\r\nCapacity gaps in the United Nations coordination\r\nmechanisms in the transition phase must be adequately\r\naddressed so as to ensure an efficient response to\r\ntransition needs.\r\nFurthermore, the effective planning of activities\r\nin post-disaster and post-conflict transitions must be\r\nimproved. Regular monitoring and assessment of needs\r\ncould contribute to the consistent planning of the work\r\nof various stakeholders.\r\nWe note with concern the situation with regard to\r\ninternally displaced persons, the number of whom has\r\nincreased all over the world. Despite a considerable\r\ninternational response, an alarmingly high number of\r\ninternally displaced persons do not receive sufficient\r\nprotection and assistance. There is a strong need for\r\nconcerted action by the international community. There\r\nis no doubt that protecting and assisting internally\r\ndisplaced persons is particularly important in\r\nstabilizing affected countries, restoring economic and\r\nsocial life and paving the way for development.\r\nThe situation of internally displaced persons is an\r\narea with regard to which United Nations agencies\r\nmust strengthen their cooperation and revitalize their\r\ncollaborative actions in order to address the existing\r\ngaps in the international response to the issue. United\r\nNations entities should employ mechanisms that\r\nestablish a comprehensive and clear division of\r\nresponsibilities for system-wide action. In this regard,\r\nwe welcome the fact that the United Nations system\r\nhas begun to pay due attention to the problem of\r\ninternal displacement by reflecting on the matter of\r\nfurther strengthening the inter-agency response to the\r\nneeds and protection-associated challenges of\r\ninternally displaced persons.\r\nI would like now to turn to sub-item (c) of agenda\r\nitem 73, “Strengthening of international cooperation\r\nand coordination of efforts to study, mitigate and\r\nminimize the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster”.\r\nAzerbaijan attaches great importance to these\r\ndeliberations. We commend the Secretary-General for\r\nhis report contained in document A/60/443 and express\r\nour appreciation to the Governments of Belarus, the\r\nRussian Federation and Ukraine for their valuable\r\ninput. The report provides a useful overview of the\r\ncurrent situation and an impact analysis of activities\r\nfor the long-term development of the Chernobyl-\r\naffected areas.\r\nIn the year leading up to the twentieth\r\nanniversary, the observation that the region has not\r\nrecovered the livelihoods that were lost and that the\r\nramifications of the disaster still represent a serious\r\nchallenge to the economic, social and environmental\r\n3\r\nA/60/PV.52\r\ndevelopment of the most-affected countries causes\r\nparticular concern. Clearly, the maturity of the problem\r\nmakes it imperative that we reinforce international\r\nefforts to overcome the consequences, but on no\r\naccount should it be viewed as an old or forgotten\r\nproblem.\r\nEfficient post-disaster recovery and development\r\nrequire the targeted assistance of the international\r\ncommunity and synergy among the stakeholders. Thus,\r\nwe note with satisfaction that the comprehensive\r\nframework actions put in place in the most affected\r\ncountries have been complemented and coordinated at\r\nboth governmental and system-wide levels.\r\nWe welcome the positive change in the system-\r\nwide response for Chernobyl recovery efforts, and we\r\nlook forward to the further coherent and effective\r\nengagement of the organizations of the United Nations\r\nsystem, bearing in mind their mandates and\r\ncomparative advantages. Azerbaijan also values the\r\nrole of the United Nations Development Group in\r\ncoordinating these efforts and further maintaining the\r\nshift to a long-term development approach.\r\nWe also hail the work of the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency, both as the lead organizer of the\r\nChernobyl Forum and as a purveyor of technical\r\ncooperation programmes for reducing the radiological\r\nimpact of the accident and addressing its human\r\ndimension.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to emphasize the fact\r\nthat Azerbaijan believes that the current review will\r\ngive new impetus to reinforcing international\r\ncooperation in the areas of economic development and\r\nscientific research on the environmental and health\r\nconsequences of the disaster, and will increase the\r\nefficiency of preparations for the commemorative year\r\n2006.\r\nAzerbaijan, as a sponsor of the important draft\r\nresolutions before us under this agenda item —\r\nA/60/L.18, L.19 and L.20 — expresses its hope that\r\nthrough their implementation, we will succeed in\r\naddressing our concerns with regard to the\r\nstrengthening of mechanisms to prevent, mitigate and\r\nrespond to humanitarian emergencies worldwide.\r\nMr. Oosthuizen (South Africa): I should like\r\nfirst of all to align my delegation with the statements\r\nmade by the Ambassador of Jamaica on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China and by the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Malawi on behalf of the Southern\r\nAfrican Development Community, as well as to thank\r\nthe Secretary-General for his reports prepared under\r\nthis item.\r\nThe past year was indeed very challenging for the\r\nhumanitarian community. We were faced with many\r\nhurricanes, floods and earthquakes all over the world.\r\nWe remember in particular the recent devastating\r\nearthquake in Pakistan, emphasizing the point made by\r\nthe Secretary-General in his report (A/60/432) that the\r\nneed for effective humanitarian assistance has\r\nincreased dramatically.\r\nIn his earlier report, “In larger freedom”,\r\n(A/59/2005) the Secretary-General recognized that the\r\nhumanitarian system has generally worked well in most\r\nemergencies, given the means at its disposal. That\r\nwould imply, at least to us, that the United Nations\r\nsystem has tried its best, given the limited resources it\r\nhas received. Let me provide some examples of what I\r\nunderstand is meant by the phrase, “the means at its\r\ndisposal”, particularly having the African continent in\r\nmind.\r\nThe Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian\r\nAffairs (OCHA) highlighted, for example, during its\r\nUnited Nations Humanitarian Appeal 2005, that\r\nfunding obtained amounted to only 36 per cent of\r\noverall requirements, if the Indian Ocean Flash Appeal,\r\nlaunched at the beginning of the year to address the\r\neffects of the tsunami disaster, is excluded.\r\nMore troubling for the African continent was the\r\nsober analysis that the Djibouti Drought Flash Appeal\r\nattracted only 5 per cent of the required $7.5 million\r\nand the Benin Flash Appeal only 9 per cent of the\r\nrequired $4.6 million. As recently as the first week of\r\nSeptember 2005, the World Food Programme\r\nexpressed concern that it might not obtain enough\r\nfunding to address the food shortage in Mozambique,\r\nwhich only required $19 million to avert the crisis.\r\nWe are now receiving reports of the severe\r\nimpact of the drought in Malawi, which would also\r\nnecessitate further consideration for assistance. What is\r\nparticularly troubling about the African example is that\r\neven when appeals are made in advance to address\r\ncrises, they still do not get the desired response. The\r\nfurther tragedy of this is that a rapid response to these\r\ncrises could have mitigated the effects of the disasters.\r\n4\r\nA/60/PV.52\r\nIt is therefore obvious that we need to rethink the\r\nway we provide funding to address international\r\nhumanitarian responses, not only with regard to the\r\namount of funding, but also the unequal way in which\r\nfunding is being distributed. The recently adopted\r\noutcome document (resolution 60/1) clearly indicated\r\nour consensus agreement that the effectiveness of the\r\nhumanitarian response system could in part be\r\nenhanced by improving the Central Emergency\r\nRevolving Fund (CERF).\r\nIn the interest of time, allow me to make a few\r\nspecific comments on the proposals in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report before us. We support the\r\nmodernization of the current CERF so that it can\r\nrespond rapidly to emergencies, particularly forgotten\r\nor underfunded emergencies, many of which are in\r\nAfrica.\r\nOur support for timely response to identified\r\nneeds is based on real experiences in Africa. One\r\nrecent example is the locust crisis in the Sahel.\r\nAlthough the initial requests for support were modest\r\nin dollar terms, immediate action could have prevented\r\nthe hunger and starvation that followed the scourge of\r\nlocusts. The lack of an effective and immediate\r\nresponse often leads to the so-called forgotten or\r\nneglected emergencies, which, as I have already\r\nindicated, are often in Africa. The proposal by the\r\nSecretary-General to attend to those neglected\r\nemergencies, through the new Central Emergency\r\nResponse Fund, is therefore strongly supported.\r\nWe recognize the value of upgrading the CERF\r\nand providing it more financial support, especially\r\nthrough the addition of a grant facility. We would also\r\nsupport operationalizing the Fund as soon as possible,\r\nreminding ourselves that humanitarian response is\r\nindeed supposed to be immediate in order to address\r\nthe most basic humanitarian needs of affected\r\ncommunities. However, in line with the appeal made\r\nby the Secretary-General, we would request that\r\ndonors, in announcing their support for the new CERF,\r\nemphasize that that support would be additional\r\nfunding; it should not be funds redirected from other\r\ndevelopment budgets.\r\nIt is obvious that we need to further support\r\ncapacity-building within OCHA if we want to\r\nstrengthen the humanitarian response of the United\r\nNations system. We would also like to see the further\r\ndevelopment of the Financial Tracking System to better\r\nreflect and monitor humanitarian financing. That\r\nwould provide Member States with a better\r\nunderstanding of what has been promised and what has\r\nbeen delivered.\r\nWe recognize that addressing and improving the\r\nresponse of the international community to\r\nhumanitarian crises is not simply a matter of financing\r\nalone. We also need to look at issues such as leadership\r\nand response capacity, and at how to effectively\r\nidentify and respond to needs. Of particular importance\r\nis improving and strengthening the leadership and\r\nperformance of the resident coordinators and/or the\r\nhumanitarian coordinators. We also need to be clear\r\nabout the role envisaged for the United Nations\r\noperational agencies and the issue of governance and\r\naccountability within the United Nations system, as\r\nwell as better coordination, not only within the United\r\nNations system but also between that system and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations.\r\nWe need to ensure that the guiding principles for\r\nhumanitarian assistance are adhered to, particularly the\r\nnotion that humanitarian assistance should be provided\r\nin accordance with the principles of humanity,\r\nneutrality and impartiality. However, it is my opinion\r\nthat the proposals on the table to improve the CERF\r\nare a step in the right direction, and we need to\r\nseriously engage in that debate. We would also like to\r\nsee the humanitarian community continue to draw on\r\nthe national expertise of countries in order to increase\r\ntheir rapid-response capacity.\r\nWe have noticed with appreciation that in the past\r\nthe Secretary-General has recognized the role that\r\nregional organizations, particularly the African Union,\r\ncould and should play in addressing humanitarian\r\ncrises in the context of improved partnerships.\r\nMy delegation remains ready to participate\r\nactively in the debate in the coming days to further\r\ndiscuss the ways and means to strengthen humanitarian\r\ncoordination and response capacity, for we realize that\r\nmany issues are complicated and would need detailed\r\nattention. My delegation would also like to thank the\r\nUnder-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs,\r\nMr. Jan Egeland, and his team for the proposals made\r\nand for maintaining a focus on the need to improve\r\nhumanitarian assistance to affected communities, many\r\nof which are in developing countries.\r\nFinally, I would like to express my Government’s\r\nsincere appreciation to all humanitarian personnel,\r\n5\r\nA/60/PV.52\r\nworking often under very difficult situations to help\r\npeople in need.\r\nMr. Holosha (Ukraine) (spoke in Russian): The\r\ndelegation of the Ukraine aligns itself with the\r\nstatement made by the representative of the United\r\nKingdom on behalf of the European Union on the issue\r\nof strengthening the coordination of humanitarian\r\nassistance.\r\nWe would like to devote our statement to sub-\r\nitem (c) of agenda item 73, “Strengthening of\r\ninternational cooperation and coordination of efforts to\r\nstudy, mitigate and minimize the consequences of the\r\nChernobyl disaster”.\r\nFirst, allow me to express our sincere\r\ncondolences and support to the Governments and\r\npeople of countries that have suffered natural and\r\nhumanitarian disasters this year. Such tragedies always\r\nfind a response in the hearts of my compatriots,\r\nbecause, almost 20 years ago in Ukraine, at the fourth\r\nplant of the Chernobyl nuclear power station, there was\r\na technological catastrophe, enormous both in its scale\r\nand its consequences. That national tragedy doomed\r\nmillions of people to suffering, altered the environment\r\nand even affected people psychologically.\r\nThe accident showed how vulnerable States are\r\nwhen faced with global technological catastrophes in\r\npeacetime. More than 10 per cent of our country’s\r\nterritory was exposed to radioactive contamination.\r\nSome 160,000 people from 170 towns had to leave\r\ntheir homes forever and move to other areas. A total of\r\n3.5 million people in Ukraine suffered from the\r\ncatastrophe and its consequences, particularly those in\r\nrural areas.\r\nThe lack of specialized knowledge about\r\nradioactivity prevented people from evaluating for\r\nthemselves the truth of information provided by the\r\npress and the electronic mass media. The collapse of\r\nthe Soviet Union and the worsening environmental\r\nsituation led to a situation in which the accident at the\r\nnuclear power plant constituted a catastrophe for\r\nmillions of people living in contaminated areas. In an\r\ninstant, hundreds of thousands of ordinary citizens\r\nbecame the victims of the consequences of Chernobyl.\r\nFate and history have dictated that our nation, Ukraine,\r\nmust pay bills which it never signed for and atone for\r\nsins that it did not commit. We have to deploy major\r\nmaterial and financial resources to call for the affected\r\npeople, deal with the consequences of the catastrophe\r\nin the evacuated areas and rehabilitate the\r\nenvironment.\r\nOver the last 15 years, during which Ukraine, on\r\nits own, has been covering the costs of responding to\r\nthe consequences of the Chernobyl disaster, the\r\nexpenditures, representing from five to 10 per cent of\r\nour national budget, have not been decreasing. The\r\nexpenses associated with dealing with the\r\nconsequences of the disaster over those years represent\r\nabout $8 billion. Overall, the economic losses\r\nassociated with the Chernobyl accident represent some\r\n$180 billion. This is nine times the national budget of\r\nUkraine for the year 2005.\r\nIt should be said that for Ukraine dealing with the\r\nconsequences of the Chernobyl disaster has differed\r\nsignificantly from the experience of other affected\r\ncountries. This is due to the fact that the Chernobyl\r\nplant is located in Ukraine, as is the so-called “shelter”\r\nfacility, which for 19 years has served as a protective\r\nsystem covering the epicentre of the disaster.\r\nIn 1994, the international community, in the form\r\nof the leaders of the Group of Eight (G-8) and the\r\nEuropean Union, presented the Government of Ukraine\r\nwith a proposal to shut down the Chernobyl nuclear\r\npower plant ahead of schedule. In 1995, a\r\nmemorandum of understanding was signed in which\r\nUkraine undertook to close the plant early. In the\r\nmemorandum, the parties recognized that the complete\r\nclosure of the Chernobyl power station would have\r\nnegative economic consequences for Ukraine. Though\r\nit meant sacrificing its national interest to some degree,\r\nUkraine met its international obligations, and in 2000\r\nthe plant was closed down, although we were not\r\nprepared for this, either technologically or financially.\r\nThere was no project for decommissioning the\r\nChernobyl plant, although by law such a project should\r\nhave been approved five years in advance of the plant\r\nclosure. Financial support for decommissioning was\r\nalso lacking. Because of this, and according to the joint\r\nplan of action between Ukraine and the G-8, it was\r\nproposed that closure of the Chernobyl power station\r\nbe supported through grants that would enable Ukraine\r\nto implement a number of international plans aimed at\r\nincreasing safety.\r\nCurrently at the Chernobyl industrial site four\r\nmajor projects are being implemented. They differ as\r\nto size, projected completion dates and funding\r\nsources. In addition to Ukraine, the donors for this\r\n6\r\nA/60/PV.52\r\nproject include, more or less, all of the world’s\r\ndeveloped countries. However, and this cannot but be a\r\nsource of some alarm, there have been delays in\r\nimplementing these projects, ranging from one to six\r\nyears. The longest delay has occurred in a project that\r\nis central to the decommissioning of the Chernobyl\r\nnuclear plant, namely, the construction of a second\r\ndepleted nuclear fuel storage facility.\r\nUnfortunately, due to circumstances beyond\r\nUkraine’s control, work on this project has ground to a\r\nhalt. As a consequence, five years after the plant has\r\nbeen decommissioned, fuel remains in the reactors. We\r\nnow need to take decisions to offload the spent fuel\r\ninto temporary storage plants that will not be\r\nserviceable for much longer. And another important\r\npoint: the most important international project referred\r\nto in the memorandum between Ukraine and the G-7,\r\nthat of converting the shelter system into an\r\nenvironmentally safe system, is also several years\r\nbehind schedule. To ensure the successful\r\nimplementation of these international projects, we need\r\nadditional joint resources from donor countries to\r\nfinance this project, as well as contractors to complete\r\nthis project.\r\nThe Chernobyl disaster altered people’s lives in\r\nsocial, economic and medical terms, and also had an\r\nimpact on their inner lives. The problems that it\r\nengendered have not disappeared with the passage of\r\nyears, but are assuming different forms. Some of these,\r\nparticularly the social and economic effects, are\r\nworsening. Therefore, Ukraine believes that there\r\nneeds to be an integrated solution to these problems\r\nand that there must be a systematic approach on the\r\npart of the executive branch in setting up\r\nsocioeconomic and organizational conditions, as well\r\nas in providing guarantees of social services for the\r\naffected population and rehabilitating the contaminated\r\nareas.\r\nWhile we hope for assistance in addressing these\r\nproblems, Ukraine is itself doing everything it can to\r\nrespond to the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster.\r\nWe have adopted many forward-looking decisions, the\r\nmost important of which is a national programme to\r\nrespond to the consequences of the disaster between\r\nnow and 2010. This programme defines the priorities\r\nof the Government’s policy to respond to the\r\nconsequences of the Chernobyl disaster over the next\r\nfive years. The main objectives include protecting the\r\nhealth of victims, particularly women and children,\r\ndecommissioning the Chernobyl nuclear power station\r\nand converting the shelter into an environmentally safe\r\nsystem, strengthening and supporting radiation safety\r\nbarriers and cutting back on the release of\r\nradionucleides into the area beyond the exclusion zone,\r\nsocial support to the people and economic\r\nrehabilitation of the contaminated areas.\r\nOn the basis of experience gained over many\r\nyears and also pursuant to the recommendations of the\r\nVienna Chernobyl Forum in 2005, the main target\r\ngroups for medical supervision over the next 10 years\r\nwill be those who took part in disaster response, people\r\nwho were exposed to significant doses of iodine\r\nradiation as children and victims who have remained in\r\nareas contaminated with radionucleides. The social\r\nsupport policy gives particular attention to\r\nimplementing State programmes to rehabilitate the\r\ncontaminated area and to making sure that they are\r\nmade clean and attract investment, as well as to\r\ndeveloping infrastructure and creating jobs in places\r\nwhere victims make up a large proportion of the\r\npopulation.\r\nWe are pleased to note that the key principles in\r\nthe rehabilitation strategy prepared by the United\r\nNations are in line with the above-mentioned priorities\r\nof the Government of Ukraine. And here, we hope that\r\nthere will be greater cooperation with the United\r\nNations structures and with donor countries in\r\nimplementing projects, such as improved delivery of\r\nprimary health care services and improved medical aid,\r\nparticularly for women and children, carrying out\r\nprojects to ensure social and economic rehabilitation of\r\nthe affected areas, transitioning these areas into a phase\r\nof social and economic development, completing the\r\ninternational projects for decommissioning the\r\nChernobyl power plant, and transforming the shelter\r\nsystem into an environmentally safe system.\r\nThanks to the joint efforts of Ukraine and the\r\ninternational community, in particular, the United\r\nNations, we have been able to deal with many critical\r\nproblems associated with the consequences of the\r\nChernobyl disaster. However, many problems remain.\r\nAnd here it would be appropriate to refer to the words\r\nof Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who said,\r\n“Chernobyl is a word we would all like to erase from\r\nour memory … more than 7 million of our fellow\r\nhuman beings do not have the luxury of forgetting.\r\nThey are still suffering, every day, as a result of what\r\nhappened.”\r\n7\r\nA/60/PV.52\r\nAs the country and people who have suffered\r\nmost from the Chernobyl disaster and its long-term\r\nconsequences, we are entitled to count on the support\r\nof the international community. This support should\r\ncome both in the form of international assistance\r\nprogrammes, which are vital, and in the form of simple\r\nhuman understanding and compassion for our\r\nproblems.\r\nThe 20th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster\r\nfalls on 26 April 2006, and in connection with this\r\ntragic event, from 24 to 26 April 2006, in Kyiv, we will\r\nhold an international conference entitled “Twenty\r\nYears After the Chernobyl Disaster: Future Outlook.”\r\nThe conference will sum up what has already been\r\ndone, draw up a programme of action, both for the\r\ninternational community and for national organizations\r\nengaged in responding to the consequences of the\r\nChernobyl disaster, and assess the impact of the\r\ncatastrophe on the nuclear power industry as a whole.\r\nWe invite Member States as well as all interested\r\npartners to take part in the conference. We also feel\r\ncompelled to ask the President of the General\r\nAssembly to convene in late April and early May of\r\n2006 a special meeting of the General Assembly\r\ndevoted to this tragic anniversary. We believe this will\r\nprovide additional momentum for the adoption of\r\neffective measures to step up collaboration in the\r\ninternational community to continue responding to the\r\nafter-effects of the Chernobyl catastrophe.\r\nThe delegation of Ukraine, as a sponsor of the\r\ndraft resolution on Chernobyl at this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, attaches particular importance to its\r\nbeing adopted by consensus. We are convinced that this\r\ndocument will serve to increase international\r\ncooperation on Chernobyl issues.\r\nMr. Kariyawasam (Sri Lanka): Sri Lanka\r\nassociates itself with the statement made by the\r\nrepresentative of Jamaica on behalf of the Group of 77\r\non all sub-items under agenda item 73.\r\nIt is an unfortunate reality that within just one\r\nyear two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude\r\nstruck the region of South Asia. One hit from land; the\r\nother came from the sea. On 26 December 2004, tidal\r\nwaves struck two thirds of Sri Lanka’s coastal areas,\r\nleaving in their wake death and destruction of a scale\r\nhitherto unknown in our 2,500-year recorded history.\r\nFriendly Governments, the United Nations,\r\ninternational organizations, civil society and countless\r\nwell-wishers across the world reached out beyond the\r\nconfines of geopolitical and other man-made barriers to\r\nhelp. This boundless generosity rekindled in us a new\r\nconfidence in the power of people acting in unison for\r\nthe welfare of humankind. To all those who\r\nsympathized with us and assisted in rescue and relief\r\noperations, the people of Sri Lanka are profoundly\r\ngrateful.\r\nLet me also take this opportunity to extend a\r\nspecial word of thanks to President Clinton, the United\r\nNations Special Envoy for Tsunami Recovery, for his\r\ncommitment and leadership in coordinating the\r\nongoing international effort for our sustainable\r\nrecovery from the tsunami disaster.\r\nIn the aftermath of the tsunami disaster, there was\r\nno strong institutional framework to coordinate the\r\nrelief effort, owing to the lack of credible local disaster\r\nmanagement and mitigation procedures. However, the\r\nlatent capacities of the existing district administration\r\nand local civil society structures came to the fore. Even\r\nwith inadequate capacity and lack of experience, they\r\nresponded magnificently. The fact that there were no\r\ndeaths in Sri Lanka from starvation or ill health as a\r\nresult of the disaster is a credit to the immediate local\r\ninput.\r\nIt has become evident that building local capacity\r\nand ownership are essential for the success of long-\r\nterm rehabilitation and reconstruction. This requires a\r\npartnership with the locality and an understanding of\r\nspecific local conditions, as well as projects that will\r\nbe ultimately be owned by the people in the affected\r\nareas. In this context, Sri Lanka has now developed a\r\nblueprint for reconstruction, in cooperation and\r\nconsultation with the United Nations system, the\r\ninternational donor community and numerous civil\r\nsociety organizations. Most importantly, given the\r\nimportance of multi-stakeholder participation for\r\nsustainable recovery, this blueprint reflects the general\r\nwill of the people in each affected locality as well.\r\nSystem-wide consultations take place on a continual\r\nbasis that provide the scope and opportunity for\r\nbeneficiary inputs to the reconstruction programme.\r\nNatural disasters create huge setbacks, thus\r\nnegating development gains for developing countries.\r\nAs we approach the first anniversary of the tsunami\r\ndisaster, Sri Lanka is engaged in an inevitably long and\r\ncomplex reconstruction process. It has been estimated\r\nthat $1.8 billion will be required for reconstruction.\r\n8\r\nA/60/PV.52\r\nThe Government of Sri Lanka is committed to building\r\nback better. We are pleased that Sri Lanka’s economy\r\nis projected to resume its growth this year, as the\r\ninfrastructure damaged by the tsunami is being rebuilt,\r\nand the fisheries and tourism sectors of the economy\r\nare beginning to recover. We are also on course to meet\r\nthe construction target of 80 per cent of the 80,000\r\nhouses that had been destroyed.\r\nSince the initial stages of the recovery effort, Sri\r\nLanka has been committed to effective management of\r\nthe recovery effort, as well as to transparency and\r\naccountability in the disbursement of funds. In this\r\nconnection, the United Nations has worked with us to\r\ncreate a development assistance database system,\r\nwhich enables the Government to coordinate\r\nreconstruction efforts more effectively and identify\r\ngaps in the process. It also enables the public to view\r\nfinancial data and track progress in the activities of\r\ndonors and implementing partners. In our view, this is\r\na model worthy of emulation in similar situations.\r\nNatural disasters can strike anywhere, as we have\r\nwitnessed in the recent past. Unfortunately, it is\r\napparent that the rate of survival and the ability to\r\nrebuild depends on the relative wealth of the affected\r\ncountry. Therefore, there are several important steps\r\nthat our development partners can take to help\r\ndeveloping countries affected by disasters to attain\r\nsustainable recovery.\r\nGiven that many developing countries have\r\nopened up their economies on the basis that more\r\ntrade, not aid, will engender economic development,\r\ntrade barriers that exist in various forms in our export\r\nmarkets can be a drag on our recovery and growth.\r\nTherefore, market access for our exports, preferably\r\nunder concessionary terms, at least for a specific\r\nperiod, would accelerate the recovery process.\r\nMoreover, excessive debt burdens continue to be a\r\ngreat hindrance to our recovery potential, especially in\r\nthe light of escalating oil prices and the depression in\r\ncommodity prices. To give an example, before the\r\ntsunami disaster Sri Lanka had set aside $500 million\r\nfor servicing debt for the year, an amount we can ill\r\nafford now in the face of massive reconstruction\r\nexpenditure. We are grateful to several countries for\r\ncancelling some of our debt and for offers of\r\nmoratoriums on repayment of debts. However, we do\r\nneed for such humanitarian gestures to continue until\r\nthe recovery is completed.\r\nThe experiences of the Indian Ocean tsunami\r\ndisaster, of hurricanes that struck the Caribbean,\r\nHurricane Katrina, landslides in Guatemala and\r\nMexico, as well as the South Asian earthquake just last\r\nmonth, make apparent the need to develop effective\r\nand efficient disaster management and risk reduction at\r\nthe regional and global levels. This week the leaders of\r\nSouth Asia underscored this fact at their summit\r\nmeeting in Bangladesh. In this respect, initiatives for\r\nsetting up global early warning systems, incorporating\r\nregional, subregional and national systems, should\r\nreceive higher priority. Hence, we seek the support of\r\nall concerned parties to establish the proposed Indian\r\nOcean tsunami early warning system by January 2006,\r\nas scheduled.\r\nThe recent increase in natural disasters has also\r\nmet with the unfortunate situation of uneven funding\r\npatterns and donor interest. This glaring disparity in\r\nresource availability for each disaster may be a result\r\nof several factors, including donor fatigue.\r\nNevertheless, it is the responsibility of each Member\r\nState of the United Nations to empower this\r\nOrganization in such a manner as to even out those\r\nodds to the extent possible in view of our common\r\nhumanitarian concerns. This will, no doubt, enable the\r\nUnited Nations system to mobilize on short notice.\r\nWhenever a natural disaster occurs, anywhere in the\r\nworld, the United Nations should not be made to wait\r\nfor funds in order to commence work immediately. In\r\nthis context, Sri Lanka supports the proposal to\r\nupgrade the Central Emergency Response Fund\r\n(CERF), which is expected to be operational by\r\nJanuary 2006, with a renewed funding base. However,\r\nfor the Fund to succeed over the long term, it is\r\nessential to have standing pledges for its\r\nreplenishment. Moreover, the involvement of both\r\ntraditional and non-traditional donors, as well as the\r\nexperience of countries affected by natural disaster, in\r\nthe governance of the Fund will play an important role\r\nin its success.\r\nWe profoundly appreciate the way in which the\r\nUnited Nations system marshalled its energy and\r\nresources to alleviate the misery of those affected by\r\nthe tsunami disaster. In that regard, we emphasize once\r\nagain the important role of the United Nations in\r\ncoordinating humanitarian relief assistance throughout\r\nthe world for all natural disasters.\r\n9\r\nA/60/PV.52\r\nHaving recently faced such a natural disaster, we\r\nnote some important factors that, in our view, make the\r\ndelivery of assistance cost-effective and efficient.\r\nFirst, duplication must be avoided, both within\r\nthe United Nations system and with regard to\r\nassistance from civil society and non-governmental\r\norganizations. It would be best if the Office for the\r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs would work with\r\nnational Governments and all other donors and\r\nstakeholders to that end.\r\nSecondly, we must promote substantive and\r\nsubstantial national and local involvement in all relief,\r\nrecovery and reconstruction efforts. Such efforts must\r\nencompass not only national Government authorities\r\nbut also national civil society organizations.\r\nThirdly, locally available resources, in particular\r\nhuman resources, must be utilized. That substantially\r\ndecreases the overhead costs usually associated with\r\nUnited Nations operations and international donor\r\nprogrammes. Furthermore, the use of local raw\r\nmaterials and local processing can be cost-effective\r\nand engender sustainable development.\r\nFourthly, transparency should be promoted in\r\naction taken at the international level and, more\r\nimportantly, at the local level. That necessarily\r\nincludes disclosure as to financial outlays and how\r\ndonor funds have been utilized at the local level.\r\nGiven the current rapid advancements in\r\ntechnology and human capabilities and the exponential\r\naccumulation of wealth in some parts of the world, it is\r\nunconscionable to let less fortunate fellow human\r\nbeings suffer through neglect and apathy. The rapid\r\nglobalization of both economic and social forces can\r\nno longer bear such iniquity. It is in our enlightened\r\nself-interest to work in partnership to provide rescue\r\nand relief to all human beings, wherever they live and\r\nwhenever such needs arise. We need to continue to\r\nlearn from every disaster how we can improve our\r\nmethods of delivery and mobilize the conscience of\r\nhumanity for the noble goal of helping one another. To\r\nthat end, the Organization has a unique role to fulfil.\r\nAnd we, as Member States, must empower the\r\nOrganization with appropriate means and resources.\r\nWe cannot fail.\r\nMrs. Asmady (Indonesia): The Indonesian\r\ndelegation would like to express its appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General for his reports on humanitarian\r\nassistance, which have made clear the urgent need for\r\nchange in the approach for dealing with disasters and\r\ncomplex emergencies. We once again express our deep\r\nappreciation to Mr. Jan Egeland, Under-Secretary-\r\nGeneral for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency\r\nRelief Coordinator, and his team for their commitment\r\nto their role of coordinating the efforts of the United\r\nNations system, and in particular for their contributions\r\nduring the emergency relief phase in countries affected\r\nby the December 2004 tsunami.\r\nIn making its contribution to the discussion on\r\nthe subject, Indonesia aligns itself with the statement\r\nmade by the representative of Jamaica on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China and with the statement made by\r\nthe representative of Malaysia on behalf of the\r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations.\r\nBecause of ongoing conflicts and natural\r\ndisasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes and severe\r\nweather patterns that cause extensive damage for\r\nvulnerable populations in various parts of the world,\r\nthe demand for humanitarian assistance continues to\r\nescalate. The situation is compounded by the increase\r\nof worldwide epidemics such as the avian flu.\r\nIndonesia shares the view that the United Nations\r\nmust take steps to strengthen its current system, tools\r\nand competencies in order to effectively address\r\ncurrent and future humanitarian needs. The United\r\nNations needs increased resources and better\r\ncoordination of its efforts, so that its response time to\r\nfuture disasters is shortened by making the necessary\r\nfunding and appropriately trained personnel readily\r\navailable.\r\nAs part of that change and in order to ensure\r\nbetter coordination and avoid the duplication of\r\nprogrammes on the ground, it is essential to strengthen\r\nthe role of the Office for the Coordination of\r\nHumanitarian Affairs, the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme and other relevant bodies that intervene in\r\nthe humanitarian emergency phase and are involved in\r\nfollow-up rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts.\r\nThere must also be constant awareness that there are\r\nhumanitarian needs that extend well beyond the post-\r\nconflict recovery and reconstruction phase and which\r\nearly humanitarian arrangements do not cover. In\r\ngeneral, early transition activities tend to focus on\r\nstabilizing and re-establishing basic State infrastructure\r\nbefore full needs assessments can be completed.\r\n10\r\nA/60/PV.52\r\nAlong with those changes aimed at responding to\r\nthe full range of real needs on the ground, action must\r\nbe taken to address the persistent financial constraints\r\nthat affect humanitarian work. My delegation therefore\r\nfully supports the recommendation of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to convert the Central Emergency Revolving\r\nFund into an emergency response fund with a grant\r\nfacility. That would ensure immediate funding to\r\nsupport rapid responses to humanitarian crises. We\r\nmust give that proposal urgent consideration.\r\nIndonesia also welcomes the commitment of\r\nworld leaders at last September’s summit to address the\r\naforementioned challenges in humanitarian assistance,\r\nin particular to strengthen the capacities of developing\r\ncountries to respond rapidly to natural disasters and\r\nmitigate their impact. It is to the credit of our leaders\r\nthat they took the decision to further develop and\r\nimprove mechanisms that equip developing countries\r\nwith emergency standby capacities.\r\nWith respect to the specific case of those\r\ndeveloping countries affected by the December 2004\r\ntsunami, Indonesia notes that President William\r\nJefferson Clinton has been appointed to sustain the\r\npolitical will of the international community to support\r\nlong-term rehabilitation, reconstruction and risk\r\nreduction in countries impacted by the tsunami. Similar\r\ninitiatives should be taken in the future when\r\nunprecedented global catastrophes occur.\r\nBeing one of the countries that suffered the wrath\r\nof the December 2004 tsunami in the worst possible\r\nway, Indonesia remains deeply grateful for the\r\ngenerous contributions and the solidarity extended by\r\nthe international community. For its part, Indonesia has\r\nundertaken, and will persist in, its efforts to ensure that\r\nsuch contributions are managed in a fully transparent\r\nand accountable fashion.\r\nTo that end, Indonesia has adopted a master plan\r\nfor the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Aceh and\r\nNias Island. The plan provides a holistic,\r\ncomprehensive and integrated approach to a five-year\r\nrestoration and reconstruction programme for the\r\nworst-hit regions. The plan provides guidelines for:\r\ncreating understanding and building commitment\r\namong all stakeholders; coordinating, synchronizing\r\nand integrating the plans of various sectors;\r\ndisseminating and distributing data and information to\r\nthe local, national and international communities;\r\npromoting the solidarity, participation and involvement\r\nof civil society; and designing a system and mechanism\r\nfor the mobilization of funds.\r\nThe fruit of the plan was the establishment on\r\n29 April 2005 of the Rehabilitation and Reconstruction\r\nAgency. Its main mission is to restore livelihoods and\r\nstrengthen communities in Aceh and Nias by designing\r\nand overseeing a coordinated, community-driven\r\nreconstruction and development programme,\r\nimplemented in accordance with the highest\r\nprofessional standards.\r\nAlthough progress is under way, my delegation\r\nhas come to appreciate how certain aspects of this\r\nprocess can affect the pace of the implementation of\r\nthe overall programme. Coordination is one such\r\naspect. It must be implemented to guarantee that all\r\naffected communities are properly assisted, in\r\naccordance with their specified needs and priorities, by\r\nagencies in the field. If that is to be done successfully,\r\ncommunity leadership must be consulted and must\r\nform part of the recovery effort planning process.\r\nHowever, because various agencies have widely\r\ndivergent approaches, standards and speeds of\r\noperation, recovery work can be slowed by serious\r\ndisorganization.\r\nAnother important aspect of implementation is\r\ncommunity participation. The fact that that entails\r\npainstaking consultations with community leaders to\r\ndetermine what must be done and how to prioritize\r\nprojects so that efforts can be properly sequenced has\r\ncreated the false impression of slow progress. Once\r\nconsultations have been completed, however, it is\r\nexpected that the actual rehabilitation and\r\nreconstruction work will be carried out with speed and\r\nefficiency.\r\nThe value of this participatory approach also\r\nbrings home the fact that it is critically important that\r\nvulnerable countries develop regional and national\r\ncapacities to anticipate major natural disasters by using\r\nearly warning systems and to mobilize domestic\r\nresources to lessen the humanitarian impact. Since\r\nnational resources are available when disasters strike,\r\nthey represent the first line of defence against a rapid\r\ndeterioration of the situation in an affected community.\r\nIn addition, such resources constitute a vital\r\naspect of a disaster-prone country’s preparedness and\r\nits ability to help itself. Appropriate training must\r\ntherefore be provided to potential first responders,\r\nincluding civilian, military and other security forces\r\n11\r\nA/60/PV.52\r\nthat can act to prevent an unfortunate situation from\r\nbecoming tragic.\r\nWith regard to the situation in Aceh, the\r\nGovernment of Indonesia has developed the Recovery\r\nAceh Nias (RAN) database — which is based on the\r\nDevelopment Assistance Database of the United\r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP) — to\r\nmonitor and evaluate work being carried out in the\r\nprovince. The RAN database provides official\r\ninformation for project reporting and tracking,\r\ncovering all organizations involved in the recovery\r\nprocess and how they are responding to identified\r\ncommunity needs.\r\nFinally, I should like to touch upon the issue of\r\ninternational assistance to alleviate the suffering of the\r\nPalestinian people. Indonesia appreciates the\r\nSecretary-General’s report on that subject (A/60/90)\r\nand fully endorses the view that only a peace process\r\nand a full and definitive settlement of the conflict will\r\npermit a transition from crisis management and\r\nrecovery to sustainable development and prosperity.\r\nWe urge that the Palestinian people be allowed to\r\nexercise their right to self-determination, including by\r\nestablishing their own State.\r\nIndonesia, as a country affected by the tsunami in\r\nDecember 2004, also appreciates the practical value of\r\nthe various recommendations put forward by the\r\nSecretary-General in his other reports. However, it is\r\nnot enough for sound recommendations to be made;\r\nthey must inspire a rapid response on the part of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nMs. Juul (Norway): As we meet here in New\r\nYork, some 300,000 Pakistanis are facing the coming\r\nwinter in Kashmir without the necessary shelter and\r\nassistance. At the same time, an estimated 10 million\r\npeople are facing drought and severe food shortages in\r\nSouthern Africa. In both cases, the response from\r\ndonors to United Nations appeals has been slow. We\r\nmust face the fact that we have failed.\r\nWe believe that those two humanitarian crises\r\ncould have been handled differently — and more\r\neffectively — if the United Nations and the Office for\r\nthe Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) had\r\nbeen equipped with the tools necessary for dealing\r\nwith the fierce forces of nature or of man.\r\nThe role of the United Nations in emergency\r\nhumanitarian assistance is increasingly important,\r\nbecause its services are in great demand. Strengthening\r\nthe coordination of United Nations humanitarian\r\nassistance is required, because we have an obligation to\r\nsupply help to those in need.\r\nProviding the United Nations with the necessary\r\nresources is essential, because we want it to be a strong\r\ncoordinator. Norway therefore welcomes the upgrading\r\nof the Central Emergency Revolving Fund (CERF),\r\nwhich will make it a permanent emergency fund that\r\ncan quickly respond to — and possibly prevent —\r\ncrises like the one in Southern Africa. We are anxious\r\nto see an upgraded CERF operational as early as\r\npossible in 2006.\r\nMr. Gaspar Martins (Angola), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nIn keeping with the United Nations humanitarian\r\nreform agenda, the Fund’s main purpose is to improve\r\ninternational response capacity. That means improving\r\nthe speed, equity and predictability of humanitarian\r\nresponses on the ground. Indeed, that is required.\r\nIncreasingly, the United Nations and the donor\r\ncommunity are faced with demands for quick and\r\nflexible responses to sudden-impact, complex\r\nemergencies. Furthermore, an upgraded CERF is\r\nnecessary to ensure a better and more systematic focus\r\non neglected emergencies. It will provide funding that\r\nwill allow agencies to respond to appeals that donors\r\ncollectively have not yet been able to fund to the extent\r\nneeded.\r\nA new CERF is not a goal in itself. For Norway,\r\nthe key criterion for the success of humanitarian\r\nreform is that it more effectively meet humanitarian\r\nneeds on the ground. The Fund is an important step\r\ntowards that goal, and we intend to cooperate closely\r\nwith OCHA, with other relevant United Nations\r\nagencies and with Member States to ensure that CERF\r\nbecomes a successful financial mechanism.\r\nBut we will not be able to provide flexible and\r\nspeedy funding unless certain conditions are met.\r\nThere must be an unbureaucratic and flexible advisory\r\ngroup structure. There must be clear criteria for the\r\nallocation of resources. There must be strong\r\nleadership and a high degree of consensus — both\r\nbetween the United Nations and donors and between\r\nthe United Nations and non-governmental\r\norganizations (NGOs) — regarding how those criteria\r\nare to be applied in practice. There must be accurate\r\nneeds assessments and appropriate accounting and\r\n12\r\nA/60/PV.52\r\nreporting mechanisms. We would also like to see better\r\nand more systematic dialogue with NGOs on how we\r\ncan improve our response capacity.\r\nGood humanitarian donorship requires that\r\nhumanitarian financing be adequate, flexible and\r\npredictable. The new CERF will provide an\r\nopportunity for us to encourage higher levels of donor\r\nfunding and to demonstrate in practice the true value of\r\nour humanitarian principles. Our goal — our\r\nmandate — is improved humanitarian response, not\r\nfinancial redistribution.\r\nThe time has come to have done with the\r\nperpetual underfunding of standby and preparedness\r\nmechanisms. Therefore, the Norwegian Government\r\nhas pledged 200 million Norwegian kroner —\r\napproximately $30 million — to the Fund. Those are\r\nadditional fund. We urge other donors to contribute\r\nsimilar amounts.\r\nMr. Briz Gutiérrez (Guatemala) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): Guatemala associates itself fully with the\r\nstatement made on behalf of the Group of 77 and\r\nChina.\r\nWe wish to thank the Secretary-General for his\r\ncomprehensive reports on this subject. We shall\r\ncomment first on international cooperation on\r\nhumanitarian assistance in the field of natural disasters\r\nand secondly on the improvement of the Central\r\nEmergency Revolving Fund (CERF).\r\nThere can be no question that humanitarian issues\r\nare of fundamental importance in the context of\r\nemergencies. However, our debates and shared\r\nexperiences have demonstrated that risk reduction and\r\npreventive action with respect to vulnerable persons\r\nare the best way to contribute to reducing the impact of\r\ndisasters.\r\nFor that reason, Guatemala concurs with the\r\nSecretary-General’s recommendation that the relevant\r\nUnited Nations organizations and donor Governments\r\nshould strengthen the capacities of disaster-prone\r\ncountries in disaster mitigation, preparedness and\r\nresponse as well as post-disaster recovery, within a\r\ndisaster-risk-reduction framework.\r\nCoping with such problems requires a global\r\nresponse — hence the importance of strengthening\r\ncooperation with, and technical assistance to,\r\nGovernments, so that concrete actions may be taken in\r\nthe area of the prevention and mitigation of disasters.\r\nRecent storms and hurricanes, such as Stan,\r\nWilma and Beta, have, regrettably, confirmed Central\r\nAmerica’s vulnerability to natural disasters. It is a\r\nwell-known fact that during the June-November period\r\nthe region is prone to hurricanes, storms, floods and\r\nmudslides; that from November to June it can suffer\r\ndroughts and forest fires; and that during any one-year\r\nperiod beginning in June, it can be hit by volcanic\r\neruptions, earthquakes and tidal waves.\r\nGuatemala, by reason of its geographic position\r\nand geological characteristics, is a country of multiple\r\nand varied landscapes as well as climates — a country\r\nthat is highly vulnerable and exposed to various types\r\nof disasters.\r\nWe have learned in the hardest possible way that\r\na disaster, in addition to its devastating effects on\r\nhuman security and sustainable development, also can\r\npose serious threats to the social fabric. Last month’s\r\ncatastrophic mudslides, brought about by the torrential\r\nrain caused by hurricane Stan, not only inflicted\r\nserious damage on Guatemala’s infrastructure but also\r\nresulted in the deaths of a large number of people in\r\npredominantly indigenous communities, which was\r\nhighly detrimental to the social fabric of the country.\r\nConcerning the recommendation calling for\r\nenhancing the role played by regional organizations,\r\nwe concur as to the need to strengthen regional\r\ncooperation, which has enabled us to achieve a higher\r\nlevel of coordination in coping with disasters. That is\r\nwhy Guatemala firmly supports the efforts being made\r\nby the region in the context of the Central American\r\nIntegration System. We are cooperating with the other\r\ncountries of the region in that context as part of our\r\nefforts to support the work being done by the\r\nCoordination Centre for Natural Disaster Prevention in\r\nCentral America.\r\nTurning now to the enhancement of the Central\r\nEmergency Revolving Fund (CERF), Guatemala agrees\r\nthat there is a need to modernize it and welcomes the\r\nproposal to that effect contained in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report. We understand that upgrading the\r\npresent Fund would entail not just a reform of the\r\noverall United Nations system for responding to\r\nhumanitarian crises but the creation of a more efficient\r\nrapid-reaction mechanism endowed with predictable\r\nfunding available to all in an equitable manner.\r\nMy delegation supports the modernization of the\r\nFund and in particular improving humanitarian\r\n13\r\nA/60/PV.52\r\nresponse in under-funded crisis situations. We believe\r\nthat this is the best way to make sure that cases of\r\n“unnoticed” emergencies receive the attention they\r\ndeserve. My delegation considers that all natural\r\ndisasters are of equal importance and that they should\r\nnot be ranked according to the number of deaths, the\r\nmagnitude of the destruction or the scope of\r\ninternational media coverage. The Indian Ocean\r\ntsunami disaster clearly demonstrated that\r\nextraordinary amounts of financing can be mustered\r\nprovided the necessary political will and commitments\r\nexist.\r\nIn that respect, we wish to express our concern at\r\nthe criteria and guidelines that are to be used in the\r\noperation of the new Fund, particularly as regards the\r\nrole that the proposed advisory group will have in the\r\nallocation of funds. It is certainly normal procedure for\r\nfunds to have bodies or committees responsible for\r\ndeciding whether or not to grant financial assistance.\r\nWe consider, however, that this is not the most\r\nappropriate arrangement in the case of emergencies,\r\nwhere response time is of the essence. For the moment,\r\nmy delegation is looking into the matter, but we wish\r\nto point out that any process by which the group is\r\nselected must be based, as a minimum, on adequate and\r\nequitable geographical distribution.\r\nOur actions take place in the framework\r\nestablished by resolution 46/182, particularly the\r\nprinciples of neutrality, impartiality and humanity, with\r\nregard to humanitarian assistance.\r\nGuatemala deems it essential that the cultural\r\nspecificities of countries be taken into account. The\r\npopulation of Guatemala comprises a considerable\r\nproportion of indigenous peoples, whose community\r\ntradition is a fundamental contributing factor both to\r\nthe successful management of a system of\r\nhumanitarian crisis relief as well as to the success of\r\nsubsequent post-disaster recovery operations.\r\nThe aim of modernizing the Fund is to save lives,\r\nbut we cannot overlook the issue of post-disaster\r\nrecovery. As the Secretary-General quite rightly points\r\nout, gaps exist in the capacities of United Nations\r\nmechanisms to support post-disaster recovery.\r\nGuatemala supports the efforts of the United Nations to\r\nestablish an international recovery platform to bridge\r\nsuch gaps.\r\nWe are grateful for the efforts made to strengthen\r\nthe coordination of humanitarian disaster-relief\r\nassistance provided by the United Nations and by all\r\nthose countries that are part of the never-ending\r\nstruggle to mitigate the consequences of disasters. In\r\nthat respect, we appreciate the endeavours of the\r\nUnder-Secretary-General and of the Office for the\r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\r\nIn closing, I should like to express my\r\ndelegation’s gratitude to the international community\r\nfor its show of solidarity in the wake of the devastation\r\ncaused by Hurricane Stan. I wish also to thank Member\r\nStates for their support for the draft resolution\r\nsubmitted by my delegation on humanitarian and post-\r\nrecovery assistance for El Salvador and Guatemala,\r\nwhich was adopted by consensus by the Second\r\nCommittee last Friday.\r\nMr. Kazykhanov (Kazakhstan) (spoke in\r\nRussian): At the outset, I should like to thank the\r\nSecretary-General for having prepared and submitted\r\nreports on the strengthening of the coordination of\r\nemergency humanitarian assistance of the United\r\nNations. The documents contain a comprehensive\r\nassessment of the regions that are suffering from the\r\nconsequences of natural disasters and of the work\r\nbeing done by Governments, international\r\norganizations and non-governmental organizations to\r\nprovide assistance and to bring life back to normal in\r\nthose areas.\r\nThe reports contain concrete recommendations on\r\nenhancing and coordinating the joint efforts under way\r\nand also on providing assistance to mitigate the\r\nconsequences of natural and manmade disasters.\r\nThe past year has been an extremely difficult one\r\nin terms of the number of natural disasters that have\r\naffected many States, as a result of which hundreds of\r\nthousands of people have died. Millions of people have\r\nbeen left homeless, without any means of survival. The\r\ndestructive impact of the tsunami in the Indian Ocean,\r\nthe earthquake in Pakistan and India, the flooding in\r\nSouth Asia and the hurricanes in the United States and\r\nLatin America, as well as the mudslides and\r\nsnowstorms in Central Asia and other natural disasters,\r\nhave placed a heavy burden on the Governments and\r\nthe peoples of the affected countries. We are firmly\r\nconvinced that the international community cannot\r\nremain indifferent to such tragedies, which can strike\r\nanyone, anywhere. We believe that it is only by\r\npooling its efforts that the international community can\r\nmitigate the effects of natural disasters.\r\n14\r\nA/60/PV.52\r\nWe need to build upon initiatives, as soon as\r\npossible, to create a permanent early warning system\r\nfor natural disasters. Of critical importance here for the\r\ncountries and regions affected by natural disasters is\r\nthe timely provision of assistance.\r\nBased on our belief in common humanitarian\r\nvalues and principles, the Republic of Kazakhstan has\r\nprovided as much assistance as possible to victims of\r\nthe Indian Ocean tsunami and of the earthquake in\r\nPakistan. We believe that by meeting our obligations to\r\nprovide assistance, first of all by donor countries, and\r\nenhancing coordination and support by countries and\r\ninternational organizations, it will help overcome the\r\nconsequences of natural disasters and save the lives of\r\nthousands of people in the affected regions.\r\nAs the Secretary-General points out in his report\r\non optimizing the international effort to study, mitigate\r\nand minimize the consequences of the Chernobyl\r\ndisaster (A/60/443), 19 years after the accident at the\r\nChernobyl nuclear power plant, hundreds of thousands\r\nof people in Belarus, the Russian Federation and\r\nUkraine are still suffering the consequences, one of\r\nwhich has been an increase in the incidence of cancer.\r\nWe have not been able to rehabilitate the means\r\nof survival for people in the affected regions whose\r\nlives were destroyed by this disaster. Here I would like\r\nto point out that radiological disasters, unlike other\r\ndisasters, spread beyond the crisis area itself, and\r\novercoming the consequences takes decades.\r\nIn the years since the disaster occurred, major\r\nwork has been done by Belarus, the Russian\r\nFederation, Ukraine, the Governments of many other\r\ncountries, international organizations and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations to mitigate the\r\nconsequences of that accident, which affected the\r\npeople and environment in the region. Kazakhstan\r\nwelcomes the work carried out by United Nations\r\nagencies aimed at supporting a new rehabilitation\r\nstrategy for the affected regions. The practical steps the\r\nUnited Nations agencies and funds are taking in this\r\narea will indeed facilitate early rehabilitation for the\r\npeople and environment of the region.\r\nWe highly appreciate the assistance given by\r\ndonor countries in implementing various projects in the\r\naffected regions of Belarus, the Russian Federation and\r\nUkraine. I wish to mention the World Health\r\nOrganization’s Chernobyl Telemedicine Project; the\r\nUNICEF project on life skills and healthy lifestyle\r\neducation in Chernobyl-affected areas; and the Swiss\r\nproject to improve health care for mothers and\r\nchildren. These projects exemplify the search for new\r\nways to rehabilitate and provide assistance to all those\r\nwho have been affected by the Chernobyl accident.\r\nThe month of April 2006 will mark the twentieth\r\nanniversary of the catastrophe, one of the worst in\r\nhistory. We believe that that anniversary will be a\r\nmajor international event and will once again remind\r\nthe international community of the unpredictable\r\nconsequences of such types of accidents. It will also\r\ndraw the attention of the international community to\r\nthe needs of the people who have suffered from the\r\naccident and mobilize additional assistance to mitigate\r\nthe consequences of the disaster.\r\nWe support the proposal contained in the report\r\nof the Secretary-General to organize a special\r\ncommemorative meeting of the General Assembly\r\ndevoted to the twentieth anniversary of the Chernobyl\r\nnuclear power plant accident, as well as the proposal to\r\ndeclare 26 April as a day to commemorate the victims\r\nof radiation accidents.\r\nKazakhstan also supports the adoption of the\r\ndraft resolution (A/60/L.19), on Chernobyl, submitted\r\nto the current session of the General Assembly and is\r\none of its sponsors.\r\nMrs. Dashti (Kuwait): We would like to\r\nassociate ourselves with the statement made by the\r\nrepresentative of Jamaica on behalf of the Group of 77\r\nand China. My delegation would like to focus its\r\nstatement on agenda item 73 (a), on strengthening the\r\ncoordination of humanitarian and disaster relief\r\nassistance of the United Nations.\r\nKuwait would like to express its deepest\r\ncondolences and sympathy to the Governments and\r\npeople that were victims of the natural disasters that\r\nhave taken their toll on the livelihoods and economies\r\nof several countries in Southern Asia, the Caribbean\r\nand North America.\r\nThe rapid response of the international\r\ncommunity, Governments, non-profit organizations,\r\ncivil society and financial institutions in providing\r\nimmediate humanitarian relief efforts reflects a spirit\r\nof international solidarity and cooperation. Kuwait was\r\nprompt to respond to such crises by offering financial\r\nassistance and humanitarian relief, earmarking\r\n$100 million for the victims of the tsunami disaster and\r\n15\r\nA/60/PV.52\r\nanother $100 million for the victims of the latest\r\nearthquakes in Southern Asia.\r\nKuwait has entrusted the Kuwait National Red\r\nCrescent to coordinate with other international\r\norganizations and competent authorities in the affected\r\ncountries with the delivery of such aid. Beyond that\r\nimmediate relief, Kuwait will continue to address the\r\nissue of reconstruction and development. Indeed,\r\nKuwait has entrusted the Kuwait Fund to follow up on\r\nthe reconstruction aspect of its assistance programme.\r\nThe recent devastation caused by natural disasters\r\nshould alert us all to the need for closer cooperation\r\ntowards the establishment of an early warning system\r\nand the need for the coordination of efforts for the\r\nsupply of aid and relief immediately after the impact of\r\na natural disaster. The international community should\r\nfocus as well on enhancing existing national and\r\nregional capacities to meet demands for rehabilitation\r\nand reconstruction.\r\nWe commend the Office for the Coordination of\r\nHumanitarian Affairs for its efforts in promoting and\r\ncoordinating disaster response among the United\r\nNations humanitarian agencies and donor countries.\r\nWe support the continued effort by the international\r\ncommunity to find the means to strengthen rapid\r\nresponse capacity in providing humanitarian relief. We\r\nwould also like to recognize the significant role played\r\nby the national Red Cross and Red Crescent Society in\r\ndisaster response.\r\nIn conclusion, we emphasize the need for the\r\ninternational community, including donor countries and\r\nfinancial institutions, to deliver promptly on their\r\npledges to continue to provide the necessary funds and\r\nassistance to support reconstruction efforts.\r\nMs. Singh (Nepal): Nepal attaches great\r\nimportance to the work of the United Nations towards\r\nstrengthening humanitarian and disaster relief\r\nassistance to victims of natural and man-made\r\ndisasters. My delegation expresses sincere thanks to\r\nthe Secretary-General for his various reports providing\r\ncomprehensive information on the humanitarian work\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nMy delegation associates itself with the statement\r\nmade by the representative of Jamaica on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China. I would like to make some\r\nremarks on a couple of points that are of particular\r\nsignificance to my delegation.\r\nWe still have fresh memories of the massive loss\r\nof life and property that resulted from the Indian\r\ntsunami, the hurricanes in the Caribbean region and the\r\nearthquakes that occurred this year and in 2004. My\r\ndelegation shares in the expressions of deep\r\ncondolence and sympathy conveyed to all victims, their\r\nfamilies and the peoples of Afghanistan, India and\r\nPakistan, who suffered huge losses of life and property\r\ndue to the massive earthquake that occurred in South\r\nAsia last month. We express our appreciation to the\r\ninternational community for its united response in\r\nproviding humanitarian relief assistance to the victims\r\nof natural disasters. His Majesty’s Government of\r\nNepal was pleased to join others in making a modest\r\ncontribution to our friendly neighbouring countries in\r\ntheir hour of great need.\r\nObviously, natural disasters have done great\r\ndamage to socio-economic development, as well as to\r\ninfrastructure and the environment. Millions of people\r\nhave become homeless. The more vulnerable sectors of\r\nsociety, such as women and children — especially\r\norphans and widows — have been greatly affected. We\r\nthank the United Nations and its agencies for their\r\nvaluable work in providing emergency relief to these\r\nvictims, as well as their assistance for long-term\r\nreconstruction and rehabilitation work.\r\nRecurring natural disasters such as earthquakes,\r\nfloods and hurricanes pose a great challenge to the\r\ninternational community with respect to peace and\r\nsustainable development in the world. Many\r\ndeveloping countries, particularly the least developed\r\namong them, need technical and financial assistance to\r\nstrengthen national capacities for dealing with the\r\nvarious stages of natural disaster response, including\r\nprevention, preparedness, mitigation, recovery and\r\nreconstruction.\r\nMy delegation shares the concern expressed over\r\nthe inadequate response in terms of financial and\r\ntechnical resources for humanitarian assistance to the\r\nvictims of natural disasters. We support the efforts of\r\nthe United Nations to develop multipronged strategies\r\nfor enhancing national ownership and leadership and\r\nstrengthening disaster response capacities, including\r\nrisk reduction and resource mobilization. We welcome\r\nthe recommendation contained in the report of the\r\nSecretary-General (A/60/432) on the improvement of\r\nthe Central Emergency Revolving Fund to include a\r\ngrant element alongside the existing loan element in\r\n16\r\nA/60/PV.52\r\nthe Fund. We have no objection to changing the Fund’s\r\nname to the Central Emergency Response Fund.\r\nNatural disasters are among the major obstacles\r\nto sustainable socio-economic development in my\r\ncountry. Due to its geographical and geotectonic\r\nconditions, Nepal is prone to earthquakes. Major\r\ndisasters to which Nepal is vulnerable, in addition to\r\nearthquakes, include floods, drought, landslides,\r\nepidemics, glacial lake outburst floods, fire and\r\necological hazards. Over the years, my country has\r\nsuffered great loss of life and property, as well as\r\ndamage to development infrastructure, as a result of\r\nearthquakes and floods.\r\nAt the national level, Nepal’s 1982 Natural\r\nDisaster Relief Act, as amended, sets out the measures\r\nto be undertaken for the pre-disaster, preparedness,\r\nresponse and immediate relief, and post-disaster\r\nreconstruction and rehabilitation phases. Various\r\ninstitutional mechanisms ranging from the local to the\r\nnational level have been established. The Central\r\nNatural Disaster Relief Committee, headed by the\r\nHome Minister, is responsible for formulating policies\r\nand programmes and undertaking activities dealing\r\nwith natural disasters. His Majesty’s Government\r\nattaches importance to collaborative efforts with\r\nUnited Nations agencies, civil society, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and other stakeholders in\r\ncarrying out those programmes. The Participatory\r\nDisaster Management Programme has helped to create\r\npublic awareness and strengthen national disaster\r\nmanagement capacities.\r\nIn addition to natural disasters, terrorist activities\r\nin recent years have caused a great loss of life and\r\ndamage to property and the country’s development\r\ninfrastructure. His Majesty’s Government of Nepal is\r\nfully committed to ensuring the safety and security of\r\nthe people and to restoring peace and stability. It has\r\nalso provided humanitarian relief to internally\r\ndisplaced persons. My delegation urges the\r\ninternational community to provide support to\r\nstrengthen and complement our national efforts.\r\nHumanitarian assistance aims at lasting peace and\r\nsustainable development. The international community\r\nshould continue its cooperation with the countries\r\naffected by natural disasters with a view to\r\nstrengthening national capacities for providing\r\nenhanced emergency relief to victims of natural\r\ndisasters.\r\nMr. Berruga (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): My\r\ndelegation expresses its gratitude for the support and\r\noffers of assistance extended by the international\r\ncommunity to assist the Mexican communities badly\r\naffected by the passage of Hurricanes Stan and Wilma\r\nduring the present hurricane season.\r\nIn the past two years, we have witnessed natural\r\ndisasters that have caused great losses of life and the\r\ndestruction of infrastructure. As a sign of our solidarity\r\nand taking into account that we ourselves are in the\r\nprocess of recovery, Mexico has made financial and in-\r\nkind contributions to support the efforts to assist the\r\nvictims of the hurricanes in the United States,\r\nGuatemala and El Salvador.\r\nFurthermore, I have the honour to announce that\r\nmy country will actively participate in the donors\r\nconference to be held in Islamabad on 19 November.\r\nWe will shortly make an unearmarked contribution to\r\nthe Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian\r\nAffairs for the implementation of humanitarian\r\nassistance programmes in Pakistan.\r\nSome 300 million people have been affected by\r\nvarious natural disasters in recent months. Material\r\nlosses amount to hundreds of millions of dollars.\r\nRegrettably, in all those cases, the majority of victims\r\nhave been among populations with the least resources.\r\nFor that reason, we stress the need to redouble\r\nour efforts to strengthen strategies for responding to\r\nnatural disasters, with a long-term perspective and\r\nwithin a framework of a genuine culture of prevention,\r\nsupported by the promotion of development. Similarly,\r\nwe attach great importance to risk identification and\r\nmitigation, with the highest priority being given to the\r\nmost vulnerable sectors.\r\nIt is essential that we, the Member States of the\r\nOrganization, try to limit our endless debates on the\r\nconceptual framework and return to a more pragmatic\r\ndebate on fundamental questions such as the\r\nestablishment of the overall lines of action for the\r\nprompt and effective delivery of humanitarian\r\nassistance, as well as a coordination strategy involving\r\nStates, civil society and humanitarian organizations,\r\nwith the aim of channelling assistance towards a\r\nresponse to real needs and avoiding the uncoordinated\r\nflow of resources.\r\nMy delegation actively participated in the World\r\nConference on Disaster Reduction, held in Kobe, Japan\r\n17\r\nA/60/PV.52\r\nin January 2005, and considers that implementation of\r\nthe Hyogo Framework for Action is an excellent basis\r\nfor achieving the goals that I have just described.\r\nHowever, it should be noted that all those efforts\r\nwill be in vain if they are not accompanied by national\r\nand global plans for the protection of the environment.\r\nGiven the irrefutable proof of the link between the\r\ngrowing number of natural disasters and the continued\r\ndestruction of our environment, we deeply regret the\r\nrefusal of some States to sign or ratify the relevant\r\ninternational treaties — particularly the Kyoto\r\nProtocol — whose full implementation would\r\ncontribute significantly to the stability of our\r\necosystem.\r\nMexico supports the recommendations contained\r\nin the reports of the Secretary-General on this item. We\r\nreaffirm our commitment to the international\r\nframework regulating the provision of humanitarian\r\nassistance, in keeping with our guiding principles of\r\nhumanity, neutrality and impartiality and with full\r\nrespect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and\r\nnational unity of States, in conformity with General\r\nAssembly resolution 46/182.\r\nHowever, we note with deep concern the recent\r\ntendency to interpret those principles in a way that\r\nimpedes the access of humanitarian personnel to\r\naffected populations when the State exercising\r\njurisdiction over them is unwilling or unable to\r\nguarantee that it will fulfil its obligation to protect.\r\nIn addition, we are concerned at the selective\r\nattention given to the needs of countries experiencing\r\nhumanitarian crises. We firmly believe that the\r\nresources allocated for such emergencies should not be\r\ndetermined by political considerations or by interests\r\ninimical to the principles of humanitarian assistance.\r\nTherefore, the Mexican Government has adopted a\r\npolicy of making non-earmarked donations — such as\r\nthat announced by the representative of Pakistan — to\r\nenable United Nations humanitarian entities to provide\r\naid that meets needs on the ground.\r\nIn line with that position, my country has actively\r\nsupported expanding the Central Emergency Revolving\r\nFund, whose strengthening will accelerate the process\r\nof the Organization’s humanitarian crisis response and\r\nprovide funding for crises that lack of sufficient\r\nresources because of their low political profile. In that\r\nregard, I am pleased to inform the Assembly that the\r\nMexican Government is holding internal consultations\r\nto determine when we can contribute to the Fund.\r\nFinally, I should like to reaffirm the importance\r\nattached by my delegation to the phase of transition\r\nfrom emergency to development. We are convinced\r\nthat, insofar as we give greater priority to the phases of\r\nprevention, reconstruction and institutional\r\nstrengthening, we will create sustainable conditions for\r\npeace and social stability. Mexico therefore supports\r\nand is actively participating in the discussions on\r\nestablishing the Peacebuilding Commission. We hope\r\nto see those efforts translated into action as soon as\r\npossible, in keeping with the commitment expressed at\r\nthe 2005 world summit held in September.\r\nMrs. Holguín (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nMy delegation aligns itself with the statement made by\r\nthe representative of Jamaica on behalf of the Group of\r\n77 and China.\r\nWe thank the Secretary-General for his reports on\r\nhumanitarian assistance. We congratulate Jan Egeland\r\non his commitment and thank the Office for the\r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs for its work. We\r\ncongratulate the staff of the Office on its commitment\r\nand dedication to humanitarian aid.\r\nWe wish to reaffirm our solidarity with the\r\nvictims of the Indian Ocean tsunami, the earthquake in\r\nPakistan and the hurricanes in the Caribbean and the\r\nGulf of Mexico. The United Nations system has the\r\ngreat challenge of assisting in the reconstruction and in\r\nhelping to return to normal the lives of the people in\r\nthe affected areas, working closely with their\r\nGovernments to consolidate strategies and long-term\r\nprogrammes that will permit effective recovery\r\nmeasures.\r\nHumanitarian assistance must be provided with a\r\ndeep conviction to work and cooperate with States and\r\nto support Governments’ efforts to improve their\r\nresponse capacity and infrastructure so that they can\r\nbetter face such challenges. That is the only way to\r\nensure sustainability in dealing with emergencies.\r\nMoreover, assistance must be provided in a way that\r\nupholds the guiding principles of neutrality,\r\nimpartiality and humanity.\r\nWe must be strict about not politicizing\r\nhumanitarian assistance and respect its guiding\r\nprinciples. Failure to do so will weaken the system’s\r\nresponse capacity, resulting in a loss of legitimacy and\r\n18\r\nA/60/PV.52\r\ncredibility. Elaborating strategies that supplant States\r\nand weaken their response capacity will not produce\r\nthe desired benefits. Creating operative frameworks for\r\nspecific situations will not be positive for the system.\r\nShort-term success must not be confused with\r\nsustainability and the capacity to deal with\r\nemergencies.\r\nFocusing on needs is important; it ensures that\r\nprinciples are respected and that efficient and effective\r\nresponses are provided to solve specific problems. The\r\nexample of the International Committee of the Red\r\nCross (ICRC) should be the rule, not the exception, in\r\nhumanitarian assistance. The ICRC’s credibility and\r\nlegitimacy are due to its decades-long work throughout\r\nthe world in compliance with international\r\nhumanitarian law. The United Nations system should\r\nprofit from those successful experiences.\r\nThe Emergency Relief Coordinator has asked that\r\nwe study his proposal for the Central Emergency\r\nRevolving Fund. My delegation believes that efforts to\r\nimprove United Nations humanitarian coordination\r\ndeserve consideration and analysis, and that is one of\r\nthem. The General Assembly must review the proposal\r\nwithout weakening its decision-making capacity in this\r\narea. We do not agree that the Assembly should be\r\nasked to create new structures and then receive no\r\nreports about them later. If it did that the Assembly\r\nwould continue to lose its management, decision-\r\nmaking and oversight capacities.\r\nThe updating of the Fund must be carried out\r\nwith a view to accountability to the General Assembly,\r\nwhich must guide its work and priorities to ensure that\r\nthe Fund meets needs resulting from emergencies.\r\nAccountability to the Assembly goes far beyond an\r\nannual report on the Fund’s management, of which we\r\nwould only take note. We believe that the General\r\nAssembly must oversee the Fund’s management, and\r\nwe are prepared to work with other States to find the\r\nbest way to do that. This is a process that will make it\r\npossible to revitalize the General Assembly.\r\nThis year has been particularly difficult for\r\nhumanitarian assistance. My delegation supports\r\ninitiatives that seek to improve such assistance, ever\r\nmindful that the consent and cooperation of States are\r\nessential to its functioning.\r\nMr. Morote (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): I wish to\r\nthank the Secretary-General for his reports on\r\nhumanitarian assistance.\r\nMy delegation supports the statement made by\r\nthe representative of Jamaica on behalf of the Group of\r\n77 and China on strengthening of the coordination of\r\nhumanitarian and disaster relief assistance of the\r\nUnited Nations, including special economic assistance.\r\nThe Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of\r\nDisasters indicates that the economic costs of natural\r\ndisasters have increased fourteenfold since the 1950s,\r\nnot including losses of human lives. Those disasters\r\nshould alert us to the magnitude of the humanitarian\r\nchallenge and to the imperative need for more\r\ncoordinated and effective action throughout the United\r\nNations system. Such a new attitude must also face up\r\nto the Organization’s fundamental limitations in terms\r\nof the lack of human and financial resources for risk\r\nreduction and the need to improve and increase its\r\ndisaster-relief activities.\r\nIn that context, it is important to carefully\r\ndifferentiate among the origins, characteristics, damage\r\npotential and mitigation measures for each kind of\r\ndisaster. There are disasters of a clearly natural origin,\r\nsuch as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes and tsunamis,\r\nwhich cannot be prevented and which constitute only\r\n15 per cent of all disasters. Then there are disasters that\r\nare directly or indirectly influenced by humankind and\r\nwhich thus require that we modify our habits of\r\nproduction and consumption and our way of living to\r\nprevent them.\r\nAmong the damage-potential factors, the\r\nstrategies that are designed and implemented must take\r\ninto account the lack of political will, inappropriate\r\ndevelopment models, deficiencies in governance,\r\ninequalities within a population and the growing\r\nvulnerability of developing countries, countries in\r\ntransition and, in particular, countries suffering high\r\nlevels of poverty, conflict, disease and a lack of\r\nmedicines and healthcare facilities, among other\r\nthings.\r\nAccording to a recent Pentagon report on climate\r\nchange and security, the environment is now a factor of\r\ninternational stability and security. That affirmation is\r\nbased on the following conclusions.\r\nFirst, global warming could lead to an abrupt\r\nparalysation of the ocean currents, which would bring\r\nmore severe winters, a drastic reduction of soil\r\nmoisture, desertification, intense winds, forest fires,\r\ncyclones, more acute El Niño phenomena, torrential\r\n19\r\nA/60/PV.52\r\nrains, storms, typhoons and floods in certain regions of\r\nthe world.\r\nSecondly, climate change, whose effects would\r\nvary by area and season, would contribute to the loss of\r\nbiodiversity, affect a significant portion of the world’s\r\nfood production and have a severe impact on energy\r\nand freshwater resources.\r\nMy delegation wishes to underline the following\r\nnecessary strategies.\r\nFirst, we must act in a comprehensive and\r\nsystematic manner. We must establish timely and\r\nunrestricted early warning systems and improve rapid\r\nresponse capacities, taking advantage of local actors\r\nclose to the disaster site. We must put in place\r\npreventive measures, including public awareness\r\ncampaigns, programmes for disaster preparation,\r\nmitigation and recovery and programmes for\r\nrehabilitation, reconstruction and the restoration of\r\nauthority and the rule of law. In addition, we must\r\nfacilitate sustainable ways of living and create\r\nconditions conducive to development. North–South\r\nand South-South cooperation must be encouraged, as\r\nshould the participation of experts and the transfer of\r\ntechnology and practical know-how.\r\nWe must define the specific roles and improve the\r\ncapacities of States, of the United Nations and its\r\nrelevant bodies, of other international organizations\r\nincluding international financial institutions, of\r\nregional organizations, local governments,\r\ncommunities and military personnel, and of experts,\r\nnon-governmental organizations, private enterprise and\r\nthe media, among other civil society actors.\r\nThus Peru proposes that the United Nations adopt\r\nthe following specific actions.\r\nWe must improve our capacity for a rapid and\r\neffective response to natural disasters by making\r\nadjustments to the United Nations Disaster Assessment\r\nand Coordination Team with respect to damages and\r\nneeds assessment, and by strengthening the\r\nInternational Strategy for Disaster Reduction and the\r\nInter-Agency Task Force for Disaster Reduction.\r\nIt is important to strengthen the United Nations\r\nOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\r\n(OCHA) through the provision of adequate material,\r\nfinancial, technical and human resources support for its\r\ngoal of enhancing the quality and quantity of\r\nhumanitarian assistance. In that way, OCHA will be\r\nable to coordinate assistance to the victims of natural\r\nand man-made disasters with greater effectiveness.\r\nIn addition, in light of its vast experience and\r\nprestige in the area of humanitarian disaster assistance,\r\nOCHA should issue annual reports on its activities in\r\nnatural disaster relief containing an assessment of its\r\nexperiences and general and specific recommendations.\r\nIn that context, I wish to highlight the proposal\r\ncontained in the report of the Secretary-General with\r\nrespect to the participation of the private sector in\r\nhumanitarian emergency response. It is highly relevant\r\nand should be given consideration. I am certain that\r\nnumerous multinational corporations with global\r\nbusiness interests would be interested in participating.\r\nWe could perhaps promote a global compact for\r\ndisaster assistance between the United Nations and\r\nthose corporations.\r\nLikewise, we support the recommendation of the\r\nSecretary-General regarding an appropriate\r\ninstitutional synergy, through which each United\r\nNations mission, in each country where they are\r\ndeployed, could function as an integrated entity, thus\r\nenabling the Organization to more effectively respond\r\nto potential humanitarian crises anywhere in the world.\r\nPeru expresses its support for the establishment\r\nof an international humanitarian fund, and for the\r\nSouth Fund for Development and Humanitarian\r\nAssistance and the International Recovery Platform. It\r\nsupports the expansion of the Central Emergency\r\nRevolving Fund to include a grants element alongside\r\nits existing loans component. We look forward to\r\nlearning further details of the Secretary-General’s\r\nproposal to establish a standing global response\r\ncapacity under United Nations auspices.\r\nFinally, I wish to emphasize the role of the media,\r\nwhich can contribute indirectly to international\r\nfinancing by giving disasters a level of visibility equal\r\nto the severity of their impact.\r\nMr. Sen (India): At the outset, I would like to\r\nthank the Secretary-General for the reports that have\r\nbeen prepared for the discussion under this item. India\r\nwould also like to associate itself with the statement\r\nmade by the representative of Jamaica on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77.\r\nThe past year has, unfortunately, witnessed\r\nseveral major natural disasters in various parts of the\r\nworld. Some have affected India.\r\n20\r\nA/60/PV.52\r\nThe earthquake that occurred in the northern\r\nreaches of the Indian subcontinent on 8 October was\r\nparticularly devastating. Given the magnitude of the\r\nhuman tragedy, as a neighbour and a member of the\r\ninternational community, India promptly conveyed its\r\nreadiness to extend any assistance, including rescue\r\nand relief, that the Government of Pakistan might deem\r\nappropriate.\r\nDuring the meeting on assistance to communities\r\naffected by the South Asia earthquake, held in Geneva\r\non 26 October, India also pledged a contribution of $25\r\nmillion as assistance to the Government of Pakistan for\r\nrelief and rehabilitation of victims affected by the\r\nearthquake. Those funds are being made available by\r\nthe Government of India to the Government of\r\nPakistan for providing relief to victims, building\r\nhomes, rehabilitating people and reconstructing the\r\ninfrastructure and restoring essential services.\r\nThe Government of Pakistan is welcome to use\r\nthose funds for sourcing supplies of building materials\r\nsuch as cement and other items from India. The\r\ntechnology available in India for prefabricating\r\nearthquake resistant shelters can also be accessed by\r\nmeans of the fund.\r\nOne of the most important proposals for\r\nconsideration under the agenda item is that of the\r\nimprovement of the Central Emergency Revolving\r\nFund (CERF). We have repeatedly seen that timely and\r\nadequate funding of relief efforts in the initial phases is\r\ncrucial for saving lives and providing assistance to\r\nvictims of sudden natural calamities.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General (A/60/432)\r\nanalyses the funding shortages faced by the majority of\r\nflash appeals, especially in the initial phases of\r\nemergency operations. Late delivery of funds\r\nconstrains efforts to mount a rapid response and to save\r\nlives in the early days and months. An improved CERF\r\nwould indeed make humanitarian funding predictable.\r\nMoreover, by allocating one third of the Fund’s grant\r\nfacility to underfunded emergencies, the new Fund is\r\nexpected to address the needs of countries that do not\r\nhave the benefit of a “CNN effect”.\r\nThe report has provided details of funding\r\nreceived in the first month in response to flash appeals\r\nduring 2002-2005, as a percentage of total\r\nrequirements in each case. In eight cases the funding\r\nreceived in the first month was less than 20 per cent of\r\nwhat was needed. The report also cites the case of slow\r\nonset crises such as the desert locust problem in the\r\nSahel, where timely action would have saved about $90\r\nmillion later on. We therefore agree with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the need to improve the CERF and to have\r\nit operational by early next year.\r\nIt is important that the new CERF continues to\r\noperate in accordance with resolution 46/182 and the\r\nguiding principles annexed to the resolution. We have\r\nnoted that the report of the Secretary-General has\r\nincluded a section on the governance of the Fund along\r\nthose lines. The General Assembly has on numerous\r\noccasions, including in the guiding principles of\r\nresolution 46/182, stated that humanitarian assistance\r\nshould be provided with the consent of the affected\r\ncountry and on the basis of an appeal by it. It also\r\nemphasizes that humanitarian assistance must be\r\nprovided in accordance with the principles of\r\nhumanity, neutrality and impartiality. Moreover,\r\ncoordination of all types of external assistance must be\r\ndone by the recipient Government, to ensure better\r\ncoherence and coordination of the relief effort.\r\nWhile we support the idea of improving CERF,\r\nwe find that the report fails to outline clear criteria and\r\nguidelines for allocation of funds from the new CERF.\r\nThe report states that the Emergency Relief\r\nCoordinator will approve all grants awarded by the\r\nFund in accordance with its overall objectives. In case\r\nof competing demands, the discretion would seem to\r\nvest with the Coordinator. We feel that detailed criteria\r\nand guidelines for allocation of funds need to be\r\ndeveloped, with the approval of Member States, so that\r\nthe Coordinator would need to use discretion only in\r\nrare cases. In his annual report to the General\r\nAssembly on expenditures made from the improved\r\nCERF, the Cordinator should be required to provide\r\njustification for such exceptions for consideration of\r\nand future guidance by Member States.\r\nThe report claims that the modernized Fund will\r\ncontribute to the realization of other elements of\r\nhumanitarian reform, including strengthening of\r\nhumanitarian coordination and response capacity.\r\nHowever, the report does not help us to understand\r\nhow that would be achieved.\r\nThe new CERF has set itself an ambitious target\r\nof $500 million. Thus, as compared to the existing\r\narrangement of a $50 million revolving facility, the\r\nimproved CERF aims to raise $450 million on a yearly\r\nbasis. It is presumed that contributions made to CERF\r\n21\r\nA/60/PV.52\r\nwould not come at the expense of funding for\r\ndevelopment activities, but would be new and\r\nadditional to such funding. Moreover, CERF focuses\r\nonly on relief activities. The improved CERF would\r\nnot cover the rehabilitation and reconstruction needs of\r\ndisaster-affected countries.\r\nWhile improving the capacity to provide relief in\r\nthe wake of disasters, there is also a need to examine\r\nhow the gap between relief and development can be\r\nbridged. The Secretary-General, in his report entitled\r\n“The transition from relief to development” contained\r\nin document A/60/89, has also highlighted the need for\r\nadequate and timely funding of transitions to meet\r\nenduring humanitarian, recovery and peace\r\nconsolidation priorities, while simultaneously focusing\r\non building national and local capacities.\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 59/250, entitled\r\n“Triennial comprehensive policy review of operational\r\nactivities for development of the United Nations\r\nsystem”, urged the United Nations agencies and donor\r\ncommunity, in coordination with national authorities,\r\nto begin planning the transition to development and\r\ntaking measures supportive of that transition, such as\r\ninstitutional and capacity-building, from the beginning\r\nof the relief phase.\r\nThe resolution stressed the need for transitional\r\nactivities to be undertaken under national ownership\r\nthrough the development of national capacities at all\r\nlevels to manage the transition process. There is need\r\nto look at the issue of national capacity development\r\nand national ownership as a priority in post-conflict\r\nsituations.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report focusing on the\r\nIndian Ocean tsunami disaster, contained in document\r\nA/60/86, identifies the lessons learned from the\r\nhumanitarian efforts and key issues emerging from the\r\nongoing recovery efforts in the affected countries.\r\nGiven the scale of the damage caused by the tsunami\r\nlast December, the recovery effort would need to\r\ncontinue over a period of time.\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 59/279, on the\r\nIndian Ocean tsunami disaster, has emphasized the\r\nneed for the international community to maintain its\r\nfocus beyond emergency relief and to support the\r\nmedium- and long-term rehabilitation, reconstruction\r\nand risk-reduction efforts of the Governments of the\r\naffected countries. We fully endorse that approach.\r\nEarly warning is a crucial dimension and we are\r\nprepared to share our experience in this area with other\r\ncountries in the region. An early warning system\r\nagainst tsunamis devised by Indian scientists is being\r\nset up in Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, and is expected\r\nto become operational during 2006.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report entitled,\r\nInternational cooperation on humanitarian assistance in\r\nthe field of natural disasters, from relief to\r\ndevelopment, contained in document A/60/227, states\r\nthat it is possible to close the gap between relief and\r\ndevelopment and transform disasters into opportunities\r\nfor sustainable development. That is the case when\r\nefforts are made, among others, to support local and\r\nnational recovery processes at an early stage. India is\r\nconvinced of the need for continuing international\r\nengagement in the post-disaster period, for restoring\r\nlivelihoods, building resilience and reducing\r\nvulnerability. We hope that the Secretary-General will\r\nfocus on meeting that long-felt need, even as we work\r\ntowards improving CERF.\r\nInternational cooperation in tackling natural\r\ndisasters makes us realize once again that the world is\r\none family, as the ancient Indian thinkers had written.\r\nThis gives life to international solidarity and hope to\r\nmultilateralism by making that concept a part of the\r\nlives of ordinary people. As in the past, India is again\r\ncoordinating for the Group of 77 the draft resolution\r\nentitled “International cooperation on humanitarian\r\nassistance in the field of natural disasters, from relief\r\nto development”.\r\nMr. Boonpracong (Thailand): My delegation\r\nwishes to associate itself with the statements made by\r\nJamaica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, and\r\nby Malaysia on behalf of the Association of Southeast\r\nAsian Nations. My delegation would like to shed light\r\non some issues that are important to my delegation, as\r\nThailand is also a country affected by the tsunami\r\ndisaster last December.\r\nMy delegation sincerely commends the reports of\r\nthe Secretary-General, which clearly introduce an\r\ninsight into the obstacles and lessons learned from the\r\nhumanitarian response effort that come out of the\r\nongoing recovery effort in affected countries. Thailand\r\nis well aware that the more challenging tasks which lie\r\nahead are rehabilitation, reconstruction, recovery and\r\nprevention of the impact in the aftermath of the\r\ntsunami disaster. We have been making the utmost\r\n22\r\nA/60/PV.52\r\neffort at all levels in order to ensure that the people\r\nwho have been affected can return to their normal lives\r\nas soon as possible.\r\nAt the national level, financial and monetary\r\nrestrictions have been relaxed, among other measures,\r\nso as to help to provide local people and entrepreneurs\r\naffected by the tsunami with the time and space to\r\nrecover and restructure their businesses. At the\r\ninternational level, partnerships have been formed with\r\nmany countries and organizations, as well as with\r\nregional and international financial institutions, with a\r\nview to providing support to the affected communities\r\nand vulnerable groups to help in the restoration of their\r\nlivelihoods and in the recovery of their economic\r\nmeans of survival and their access to services.\r\nThailand accords priority to the strengthening of\r\nthe resilience of local communities in the affected\r\nareas. Greater knowledge and understanding among the\r\ngeneral public about natural disasters is also important\r\nand needs to be reinforced. We have integrated the\r\nsubject of tsunamis into education programmes so as to\r\nensure that our people are well aware of disaster risk\r\nand reduction. We also set up local early warning\r\ncentres. In addition, the first tsunami evacuation drill\r\nwas organized in Phuket in April 2005, and more than\r\n2,000 people, including members of the diplomatic\r\ncorps in Thailand, took part.\r\nThe aftermath of the tsunami has brought with it\r\na great and true sense of solidarity in the international\r\ncommunity, as witnessed by the outpouring of\r\nassistance in all forms and by all actors from around\r\nthe world. For its part, Thailand welcomes and is\r\ncommitted to the initiative agreed at the Global\r\nConsortium for Tsunami-Affected Countries, aimed at\r\nimproving and ensuring effective coordination and the\r\ntransparent, accountable and efficient use of the\r\nassistance provided for tsunami relief, recovery and\r\nreconstruction. We have established an online\r\nDevelopment Assistance Database, which provides\r\ndetails on all matters relevant to tsunami relief and\r\nrecovery, including project-level information on\r\ncommitments, disbursements, expenditures, donors and\r\nimplementers, as well as key outputs and information\r\nabout the progress made so far.\r\nAlso at the international level, a tsunami\r\nministerial meeting was held in Phuket, at which\r\ninitiatives to establish regional tsunami early warning\r\narrangements, as well as a voluntary trust fund on\r\ntsunami early warning arrangements in the Indian\r\nOcean and South-East Asia, were agreed. The\r\nvoluntary trust fund has now been instituted, and is\r\nadministered by the United Nations Economic\r\nCommission for Asia and the Pacific. It is aimed at\r\nenhancing national and regional tsunami early warning\r\ncentres, and complements and forms an integral part of\r\nthe Indian Ocean tsunami warning system being\r\ncoordinated by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic\r\nCommission of UNESCO. Since the trust fund is\r\nvoluntary, contributions from members and\r\nstakeholders, including international organizations,\r\nregional and international financial institutions, the\r\nprivate sector and individuals, are more than welcome.\r\nOn 26 December 2005, the Thai Government will\r\nbe organizing a tsunami commemorative event in\r\nhonour of those we lost and to express gratitude for the\r\nsympathy and generosity we received from around the\r\nworld. At the memorial service to mark the event, we\r\nwill lay the foundation stone for a tsunami memorial in\r\nremembrance of those who lost their lives. We invite\r\nall members to join us in commemorating that\r\nparticularly mournful day to remember those who lost\r\ntheir lives in the tragedy and to remind us how\r\nvulnerable we all are to the forces of nature.\r\nMr. Mansour (Palestine): We are gathered here\r\ntoday to discuss what has been a lifeline for the\r\nPalestinian people throughout the past decades of\r\noccupation and deprivation. International assistance to\r\nthe Palestinian people has, more recently, been a vital\r\ncomponent of the international community’s efforts to\r\nmake concrete the foothold of stability and peace in the\r\nregion. That assistance translated the Palestinian\r\npeople’s vision for sustainable development into\r\ntangible projects and programmes, which made\r\nPalestinians feel that they were not alone and that the\r\nworld wanted to see a brighter future for their children.\r\nUnfortunately, the international community’s good will\r\nand generous efforts were always confronted by the\r\nobstructive nature of the Israeli occupation. Following\r\n38 years of military occupation and the past five years\r\nof unabated military aggression, the Palestinian\r\neconomy now stands in ruins.\r\nAfter 1967, the Palestinian economy remained\r\nhostage to the occupying Power, forced to be\r\ncompletely dependant on it and forbidden from\r\nreaching its potential. Palestinian society and the\r\nPalestinian economy were neglected and fell decades\r\nbehind their neighbours in terms of development and\r\n23\r\nA/60/PV.52\r\ninfrastructure. When the Palestinian Authority was\r\nformed, therefore, it had to start from scratch. The\r\ncomponents of the economy were lacking — starting\r\nwith basic infrastructure like water and sewerage\r\nsystems. The task was daunting and the historical\r\nresponsibility was enormous.\r\nWorking hand in hand with the international\r\ncommunity, the Palestinian Authority has been able to\r\nachieve great progress in many areas, despite the\r\nrepeated setbacks caused by the occupying Power’s\r\nconcerted efforts to obstruct or disrupt the progress. A\r\nlitany of pretexts and excuses were used that only\r\ntranslated into the further frustration of the efforts\r\nmade to enable the Palestinian People to exercise their\r\neconomic, social and cultural rights, which are a basic\r\nconstituent of their inalienable right to self-\r\ndetermination. Those Israeli obstructions are also a\r\ngrave violation of international humanitarian and\r\nhuman rights law as well as signed agreements, in\r\nparticular the Paris Protocol.\r\nThe past five years have witnessed a downward\r\nspiral in the Israeli attitude towards international\r\nassistance efforts, which has gone from obstruction to\r\ndestruction. Israel, the occupying Power,\r\nsystematically destroyed a host of internationally\r\nfunded infrastructure projects, including the airport,\r\nthe sea port, roads and water networks and many\r\nothers. The most conservative estimates put the cost of\r\nthat destructive Israeli campaign at $3.5 billion. They\r\nalso estimate that, owing to those Israeli practices, the\r\nPalestinian economy lost approximately $6.4 billion in\r\npotential income and missed opportunities, bringing\r\ntotal Palestinian losses in the past five years alone to\r\n$9.9 billion. That staggering figure far exceeds the\r\noverall international assistance received by the\r\nPalestinian people between 1994 and 1999, when the\r\nprojects, now destroyed, were funded. A sizeable\r\nportion of that momentous loss was contributed by\r\ngenerous donors represented in the Assembly.\r\nConcurrent with the methodical destruction of\r\ninfrastructure and public and private property, the\r\noccupying Power has implemented a number of\r\ncollective punishment measures against the Palestinian\r\npeople, worsening an already dire situation. According\r\nto the most recent report of the Secretary-General\r\n(A/60/65), Israel, the occupying Power, has enforced a\r\nclosure regime of over 700 roadblocks and checkpoints\r\nthat severely restrict the movement of Palestinian\r\npersons and goods.\r\nAdditionally, the occupying Power has destroyed\r\nand confiscated Palestinian land and property that were\r\nin the way of the expanding illegal settlements. Also,\r\nIsrael’s wall, deemed illegal by the International Court\r\nof Justice in its 2004 Advisory Opinion, has caused\r\nuntold damage to the Palestinian economy. These\r\npractices all have contributed to an increase in the\r\nPalestinian people’s dependence on international\r\nassistance and shifted the emphasis of that assistance\r\nfrom development to relief. Numerous independent\r\ninternational studies and reports, including by the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development\r\n(UNCTAD) and the World Bank, have pointed out that\r\nthe regressive state of the Palestinian economy and\r\nliving standards are due to the aggressive Israeli\r\nmeasures I have just discussed.\r\nThe international community welcomed Israel’s\r\ndismantling of settlements and its exit from the Gaza\r\nStrip, only to be frustrated by the Israeli practices\r\nfollowing the exit. While we also noted that the Israeli\r\nexit represented a step towards implementing the road\r\nmap, we remain disappointed by the situation on the\r\nground thus far. Israel, the occupying Power, continues\r\nto close the Gaza Strip’s gateways to the world and to\r\nthe rest of the occupied Palestinian territory, forbid\r\nconstruction work on the Gaza seaport and airport, and\r\nattack its towns and neighbourhoods. In fact, Mr.\r\nJames Wolfensohn, the Quartet Special Envoy for\r\nDisengagement, summarized the situation in a letter to\r\nthe Secretary-General dated 16 October 2005, when he\r\nsaid that the occupying Power “is loath to relinquish\r\ncontrol, almost acting as though there has been no\r\nwithdrawal”. Mr. Wolfensohn has also emphasized that\r\nthere is no hope for economic revitalization in the\r\noccupied Palestinian territory if the Gaza Strip and\r\nWest Bank remain disjoined and the Gaza Strip\r\nremains sealed off from the rest of the world.\r\nDespite the dire situation I have just outlined, the\r\nPalestinian Authority insists on looking ahead and on\r\nworking for a brighter tomorrow — one that is marked\r\nby freedom and prosperity rather than by occupation\r\nand poverty. The international community shares that\r\nvision of peace and development with the Palestinian\r\nAuthority and has supported its achievement by\r\nassisting in the implementation of development plans\r\nformulated by the Palestinian Authority over the past\r\n10 years.\r\nThat shared vision also contributed to the\r\nestablishment of Palestinian institutions that continue\r\n24\r\nA/60/PV.52\r\nto work diligently towards being competent and\r\ntransparent, worthy of serving as a foundation for the\r\nfuture independent State. The Palestinian leadership\r\ntakes this task and responsibility very seriously, as\r\nevident in the continuous reform steps taken, which\r\nhave been applauded by several international\r\norganizations.\r\nThe Palestinian Authority has formulated a\r\nmedium-term development plan. We call on the\r\ninternational community to endorse that plan and to\r\nensure that the plan’s projects are funded promptly in\r\norder that optimum results may be reached. This\r\nshould be done in the context of guaranteeing an\r\nincrease in Palestinian ownership of the process. In\r\nthat regard, allow me to highlight the Palestinian\r\npeople’s deep gratitude for the international\r\ncommunity’s continued assistance and support as well\r\nas our sincere appreciation for the often selfless work\r\ndone and sacrifices made by the staff of international\r\naid agencies working in the occupied Palestinian\r\nterritory.\r\nWe also urge the international community to\r\nensure that their generous pledges correspond with the\r\nfunds disbursed later on, in order to ensure the\r\nuninterrupted and successful implementation of the\r\ndevelopment plan. Additionally, we call on the donor\r\ncommunity to give its full support to the United\r\nNations inter-agency consolidated appeals process for\r\nthe occupied Palestinian territory. It cannot be\r\noveremphasized that relief and development efforts in\r\nthe occupied Palestinian territory should go hand in\r\nhand, as both are vital for achieving the desired\r\ndevelopment goals.\r\nThe international community must not allow\r\nIsrael to continue defying its obligations as an\r\noccupying Power through the illegal policies and\r\npractices that have led to the state of economic\r\nregression Palestine now faces. Furthermore, it is\r\nincumbent upon the international community to ensure\r\nthat the occupying Power does not continue to carry\r\nout acts of aggression against the projects it funds and\r\nthe aid workers it employs with impunity, as these\r\nrepeated attacks have derailed the development process\r\nand frustrated assistance efforts.\r\nFinally, the cause of this state of utter destitution\r\nis known to all parties concerned and clearly identified:\r\nthe continued Israeli occupation. Hence, and as\r\nnumerous international organizations agree, full\r\neconomic recovery and rehabilitation in the occupied\r\nPalestinian territory, including East Jerusalem — the\r\ngoals driving international assistance — will be\r\npossible only when this occupation ends.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 49/2 of 19 October 1994,\r\nI call on the Observer for the International Federation\r\nof Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.\r\nMr. Schulz (International Federation of Red\r\nCross and Red Crescent Societies): On behalf of the\r\nInternational Federation of Red Cross and Red\r\nCrescent Societies (IFRC), let me express my\r\nappreciation for the opportunity to speak on this most\r\nimportant item. We are reminded of its urgency daily\r\nas we read the covers of our newspapers and are moved\r\nby stories of survival, loss, suffering and hope, from\r\nKashmir to Aceh, to the Sahel and southern Africa, and\r\nto the Gulf Coast and beyond.\r\nIndeed, 2005 has shown the dramatic impact that\r\ndisasters continue to have on lives, livelihoods and\r\nhard-won development gains. Climate change,\r\nenvironmental degradation and unsustainable\r\ndevelopment, coupled with inadequate mitigation\r\nefforts, suggest that the number of people and assets\r\naffected by disasters will continue to rise. Moreover, as\r\ndemonstrated by Hurricane Katrina, the vulnerable —\r\nnotably the poor, the sick, the elderly and the\r\nmarginalized — pay the largest price, in rich and poor\r\ncountries alike.\r\nMark Twain once wrote: “Whenever you find that\r\nyou are on the side of the majority, it is time to\r\nreform.” In celebrating the sixtieth birthday of the\r\nUnited Nations, Member States have generated an\r\nimpetus for change, and the United Nations provision\r\nof disaster and humanitarian relief is benefiting from\r\nsuch attention.\r\nThe International Federation welcomes efforts to\r\nstrengthen the coordination of humanitarian and\r\ndisaster relief assistance of the United Nations. Our\r\neight decades of experience in disaster relief have\r\ntaught us that effective coordination is the key to\r\nsuccess for all. We very much value our close\r\ncollaboration and coordination with the International\r\nCommittee of the Red Cross in complex emergencies,\r\nwhere armed conflicts and natural disasters combine\r\ntheir destructive forces. No single organization can\r\ntackle the increasing challenges posed by disasters. We\r\n25\r\nA/60/PV.52\r\nmust first and foremost work together for the benefit of\r\nall.\r\nThe Federation also welcomes the strengthening\r\nof the coordination of humanitarian and disaster relief\r\nof the United Nations as a trusted partner of the United\r\nNations system. While our humanitarian principles\r\nprompt us to work independently and with the utmost\r\nneutrality, we value our cooperation with United\r\nNations Member States and recognize that coordination\r\nwith United Nations agencies, funds and programmes\r\nadds to our effectiveness.\r\nAt the national level, Red Cross and Red\r\nCrescent Societies are recognized under the law as\r\nauxiliaries to their Governments. Internationally, the\r\nInternational Federation collaborates with United\r\nNations bodies on activities of joint interest. Our\r\ncoordination with the United Nations at Headquarters\r\nand at the field level is further enabled by our\r\nrelationship with the United Nations Office for the\r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs and by our\r\nstanding invitation from the Inter-Agency Standing\r\nCommittee. A few examples of our collaboration can\r\nbe found in Southern Africa and the Sahel, where we\r\ndistribute food with the World Food Programme; in the\r\nCaribbean and Central America, where we prepare\r\nannually for the hurricane season through joint\r\ncontingency planning; in tsunami-affected countries,\r\nwhere we work with the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme to elaborate coherent disaster management\r\nplans; and at Headquarters, where we are active\r\nmembers of the Global Consortium on Tsunami\r\nRecovery.\r\nReform provides many opportunities. The\r\nFederation welcomes the decisions set forth in the\r\noutcome document of the 2005 world summit, and\r\nsupports efforts to ensure greater predictability of\r\nhumanitarian action, funding and access. We would\r\nlike to provide just a few comments thereupon, while\r\nalso noting our support for the strengthening of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council, and our hope to\r\ncontinue playing a constructive role in this forum. The\r\ncluster approach, which aims to improve the\r\npredictability of humanitarian action by organizing\r\ncoordination on a sectoral basis, is being utilized for\r\nthe first time in response to the South Asia earthquake.\r\nSo far, it appears that the new approach has helped to\r\nidentify common challenges and sectoral gaps and has\r\nfocused relief on meeting humanitarian needs — and\r\nnot on the work of any one agency alone.\r\nAt the same time, however, the cluster approach\r\nmay have made a holistic response to disasters more\r\ndifficult — and possibly even detracted attention from\r\nother disasters, such as the devastation caused by\r\nHurricane Stan in Central America. We believe that\r\nthose mixed results will need to be assessed when the\r\ncritical emergency phase is over. The Federation also\r\nwelcomes efforts to strengthen coordination of relief\r\nprovided by the United Nations at the field level, by\r\nstrengthening the roles of the humanitarian and\r\nresident coordinators. While the Federation operates in\r\nan independent manner, it coordinates its work closely\r\nwith the United Nations and specifically with the\r\nhumanitarian coordinator.\r\nMost important, however, the Federation supports\r\nefforts by countries to strengthen their own capacities\r\nto prepare for and respond rapidly to natural disasters\r\nand to mitigate their impact. That is not only at the\r\ncentre of our work as auxiliaries to those Governments\r\nand at the heart of our philosophy to mobilize the\r\npower of humanity, it is also based on recognition that\r\nimproved national and local capacities enable\r\ncoordination of national and international humanitarian\r\nactors alike. The development of regional structures,\r\nsuch as the Pan-American Disaster Response Unit and\r\nthe regional disaster response team have proven\r\nequally successful in helping us respond to the\r\nhurricanes in Central America and to the South Asia\r\nearthquake.\r\nThe Federation welcomes United Nations efforts\r\nto improve the predictability of humanitarian funding,\r\nincluding the creation of a Central Emergency\r\nResponse Fund. The Federation’s own fund, called the\r\nDisaster Response Emergency Fund, helps us to\r\nimmediately deploy resources to respond to disasters,\r\neven before donors assess their ability to pledge any\r\nsupport. The Federation hopes that the Central\r\nEmergency Response Fund will bring additional\r\nresources, and not cause the reallocation of funds from\r\nother important programme areas. We also hope the\r\nFund will provide particular support for neglected and\r\nsudden-onset emergencies, and equally for neglected —\r\nbut most essential — programming, such as disaster\r\npreparedness.\r\nParadoxically, there is a continued lack of\r\nadequate funding for preparedness. It continues to be\r\neasier to mobilize support for post-disaster responses\r\nthan for preparedness and mitigation activities that\r\ncould avoid the loss of life and the destruction of vital\r\n26\r\nA/60/PV.52\r\nassets. Disaster preparedness has, for a long time, been\r\na core activity of the Federation, and as such, we very\r\nmuch welcome the United Nations focus on developing\r\na culture of prevention.\r\nWe believe that strengthening of the coordination\r\nof humanitarian and disaster relief must be done\r\nholistically, as is disaster management itself. That\r\nmeans that coordination must be strengthened during\r\nall phases, from response, to recovery, to preparedness,\r\nand on to development. As we have stressed before,\r\npreparedness and a culture of prevention are keys to\r\neffective relief. Coordination structures must therefore\r\nbe set up before a disaster occurs, and also be formed\r\nto specifically build disaster preparedness and early\r\nwarning systems.\r\nThrough their network of volunteers, Red Cross\r\nand Red Crescent societies participate in the\r\ndevelopment of multihazard early warning systems.\r\nThese are not slumbering systems; they encompass the\r\nensemble of activities that strengthen the resilience of\r\ncommunities. Volunteers translate warning signals into\r\na suitable language for wide dissemination and\r\ncommunity response. Because effective humanitarian\r\nand disaster relief depends equally on sustainable\r\ndevelopment, coordination should span the medium-\r\nand long-term phase as well.\r\nThe Federation actively cooperates with the\r\nUnited Nations on progress towards achievement of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. Partnerships with the\r\nWorld Health Organization to address measles and\r\nmalaria in Africa and with the Joint United Nations\r\nProgramme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) to reduce stigma\r\nand discrimination of people living with HIV/AIDS are\r\ngood examples of this.\r\nThe Federation also sustains recovery efforts\r\nduring the long-term when needed, as evidenced by the\r\nongoing work of the Chernobyl Humanitarian\r\nAssistance and Rehabilitation Programme, 19 years\r\nafter the disaster. The Federation has maintained its\r\ncoordination with the United Nations throughout this\r\ntime, and is a prominent member of two United\r\nNations initiatives, the International Chernobyl\r\nResearch and Information Network and Cooperation\r\nfor Rehabilitation of living conditions in Chernobyl\r\naffected areas in Belarus, which seek to promote\r\nsustainable development of regions affected by the\r\nChernobyl disaster. The Federation very much\r\nwelcomes and looks forward to adoption of draft\r\nresolution A/60/L.19, on Chernobyl.\r\nWe believe that to strengthen the coordination of\r\nhumanitarian and disaster relief, coordination must be\r\ninclusive of a myriad of actors. Naturally, national\r\nauthorities lead that coordination effort with the\r\npossible support of the United Nations system and\r\nother international organizations. Of utmost\r\nimportance, however, is for coordination to include\r\naffected communities, capturing their roles as first\r\nresponders and capitalizing on their resilience.\r\nRed Cross and Red Crescent Societies, with their\r\nexpertise in disaster response, extensive reach into\r\nvulnerable communities, and auxiliary relationships\r\nwith Governments, are ideal partners for Governments\r\nto that end. Early engagement with national societies at\r\nthe national and local levels, as well as ongoing\r\nsupport at the community level on a wide range of\r\nactivities, from reducing greenhouse gases to planning\r\nfor evacuations, can greatly improve collaboration and\r\nresults during the relief effort.\r\nTo conclude, opportunities for positive change\r\nare within reach. As a partner and in the name of our\r\nshared beneficiaries, the Federation supports efforts to\r\nstrengthen the coordination of United Nations\r\nhumanitarian and disaster relief. Indeed, we consider\r\nthat to be one of the Assembly’s most important\r\npriorities. Our staff and volunteers remind us daily —\r\nas does the President of this Assembly — that success\r\nis measured in our actions, and notably in our ability to\r\nalleviate human suffering. Mindful of the very realities\r\noutside of this Hall, we thus urge Member States to\r\ngive consideration to the wide-ranging impact of such\r\nreform.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 48/265 of 24 August\r\n1994, I now call on the Observer of the Sovereign\r\nMilitary Order of Malta.\r\nMr. Shafer (Sovereign Military Order of Malta):\r\nI should like to express my gratitude to the President of\r\nthe General Assembly for his good work in directing\r\nthe deliberations of the present session.\r\nThe Sovereign Military Order of Malta has more\r\nthan 80,000 humanitarian volunteers who carry out an\r\never-growing number of life-saving and livelihood-\r\nrestoring programmes around the world. Our\r\nvolunteers are motivated by one goal, powerful in its\r\n27\r\nA/60/PV.52\r\nsimplicity: to alleviate human suffering. The obstacles\r\nto the successful achievement of that mission are\r\nnumerous. Therefore, the Order of Malta works\r\nactively, in partnership with United Nations agencies,\r\nStates and local and international non-governmental\r\norganizations, to further strengthen a coordinated\r\nresponse to those challenges.\r\nHumanitarian aid workers throughout the world\r\nare often the first to respond to crises in the most\r\nunsafe areas and the last to remain long after financial\r\nsupport has ebbed. It is that very dedication and\r\ntenacity that makes them uniquely vulnerable to acts of\r\nviolence and persecution.\r\nThat regrettable fact is conveyed in the 2005\r\nreport of the Secretary-General on safety and security\r\nof humanitarian personnel and protection of United\r\nNations personnel (A/60/223), which reports an\r\nincrease in the number of security incidents involving\r\nUnited Nations staff. The most significant dangers to\r\npersonnel continue to be physical attacks, threats,\r\nrobbery and theft.\r\nThese numbers are more than just statistics to the\r\ncourageous field personnel of our Order. In early\r\nAugust of this year, Mohammed Idrees Sadiq and Emal\r\nAbdul Samad — two local staff members of the Order —\r\nwere killed in an ambush in south-eastern Afghanistan.\r\nThe two men had been working to support the return\r\nand reintegration of refugees, the building of local\r\nincome-generating measures and the efficient\r\ndevelopment of infrastructures as part of the United\r\nNations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan.\r\nAs an active partner in a number of United\r\nNations peacekeeping operations, the Order of Malta is\r\ndeeply concerned for the protection of all humanitarian\r\npersonnel. Allow me to observe that adequate measures\r\nfor the protection of all humanitarian personnel could\r\nbe included in the Security Council’s mandates. We\r\nmust neutralize the threats facing humanitarian\r\npersonnel so that they can continue to actively improve\r\nthe lives of those in distress.\r\nIn the wake of both man-made and natural\r\ndisasters, it is imperative not only that humanitarian\r\nassistance provide immediate relief to victims, but also\r\nthat comprehensive relief systems be developed to\r\ncarry out tasks including mitigation, prevention and\r\nreconstruction. The Order is convinced of that fact and\r\nhas demonstrated its ability to make the transition from\r\nimmediate relief to long-term development in many\r\ncontexts, not least the Indian Ocean tsunami disaster in\r\nDecember 2004. The Order had personnel on the\r\nground in the first days following the disaster, working\r\ncooperatively with other organizations and the local\r\ncommunities to provide medical care, water and vital\r\ngoods for survivors in India, Sri Lanka, Thailand and\r\nIndonesia.\r\nWhen the need for emergency relief subsides,\r\norganizations with the necessary capacity can make a\r\nseamless transition to reconstruction and development.\r\nIn affected countries, the Order buys goods locally to\r\nlimit transportation costs and strengthen the local\r\neconomy, providing a sustained impetus towards self-\r\nhelp. Projects with timetables of progress stretching\r\nfrom three to five years in the future are planned and\r\ncarried out in close consultation with national\r\nauthorities, ensuring the Order’s lasting and\r\nmeaningful assistance.\r\nBefore concluding these remarks, I should like to\r\nsay a few words about the Order’s humanitarian\r\nactivities to provide assistance to the Palestinian\r\npeople. The Order of Malta has operated the Holy\r\nFamily Hospital of Bethlehem-Palestine for 15 years.\r\nThe hospital has just celebrated its thirty thousandth\r\nhealthy delivery, despite having been besieged and\r\ndamaged as a consequence of the violence in the area.\r\nThe Order remains committed to the development of a\r\nsustainable health system for the Palestinian people.\r\nI should like to assure the Assembly that the\r\nOrder is responding daily to the challenges presented\r\nby humanitarian work. We will continue to follow\r\nclosely the leadership and initiatives of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 45/6 of 16 October 1990,\r\nI now call on the observer for the International\r\nCommittee of the Red Cross.\r\nMs. Petitpierre (International Committee of the\r\nRed Cross): It is a great pleasure to address the\r\ncommunity of nations on this topic, which is both\r\ntimely and of great importance. The International\r\nCommittee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is fully committed\r\nto humanitarian coordination. It strives to tie its\r\nactivities to the real needs of people affected by armed\r\nconflict and other situations of violence, but it certainly\r\ncannot meet all such needs, and it does not claim to do\r\nso. United Nations agencies are among the most\r\nimportant partners in that endeavour.\r\n28\r\nA/60/PV.52\r\nI would like to stress three elements related to\r\nhumanitarian coordination: first, the effort to improve\r\nhumanitarian coordination through reform of the\r\nUnited Nations humanitarian system; secondly, the\r\nneed to meet the humanitarian needs of internally\r\ndisplaced people; and thirdly, situations of transition.\r\nThe ICRC welcomes the United Nations process\r\nof reforming the humanitarian system. Any such\r\nprocess will ultimately lead to more effective and more\r\nreliable humanitarian response where it counts most: in\r\nthe field, among people affected by disaster or conflict.\r\nThat is true of the United Nations humanitarian system,\r\nand it is true of all humanitarian networks. The ICRC\r\nwill continue to participate in the process — notably as\r\na standing invitee of the Inter-Agency Standing\r\nCommittee and in situations of armed conflict and\r\ninternal strife — in its role as lead agency for relief\r\noperations involving the other component of the Red\r\nCross and Red Crescent movement.\r\nWe are willing to play an active role in efforts to\r\nimprove complementarity and interoperability among\r\nthe United Nations system, the Red Cross and Red\r\nCrescent network and the community of non-\r\ngovernmental organizations. That could be done, for\r\nexample, by developing common criteria for assessing\r\nneeds and measuring impact, by establishing clear\r\narrangements among humanitarian organizations\r\nregarding the geographic and thematic division of\r\nroles, and undertaking measures to facilitate\r\ncooperation among the United Nations Joint Logistics\r\nCentre, the ICRC and other logistics centres.\r\nWe cooperate with the United Nations\r\nhumanitarian system, to the extent that such\r\ncooperation is compatible with our responsibility, so\r\nthat we can always act as a neutral and independent\r\nintermediary and carry out our strictly and exclusively\r\nhumanitarian activities. For that reason, the ICRC does\r\nnot take part in United Nations integrated missions. It\r\nmust remain in a position to respond to the most\r\nimmediate needs at the onset of a crisis and to maintain\r\nits autonomous operational capability to intervene\r\nanywhere within 48 hours of the outbreak of an\r\nemergency.\r\nThe ICRC firmly believes in complementarity\r\namong humanitarian organizations. But it also believes\r\nin a pluralistic approach whereby various agencies\r\nperform various roles according to their respective\r\ncomparative advantages. The ICRC’s specific\r\ncomparative advantages are its neutral and independent\r\napproach, its operational capacities in the field and its\r\nproximity to people in need. While genuinely engaging\r\nin dialogue with humanitarian agencies, the ICRC will\r\nalso preserve its confidential bilateral dialogue with\r\nState and non-State actors.\r\nThe fate of internally displaced persons is one of\r\nthe main topics addressed through this reform process.\r\nI would like to emphasize that internally displaced\r\npersons are protected by international humanitarian\r\nlaw. Those who are living in situations of armed\r\nconflict are primarily civilians, and as such are\r\nprotected by international humanitarian law, which\r\nprovides for civilian immunity from attack and abuse\r\nand also sets forth the explicit right of civilians to\r\nreceive the assistance essential to their survival.\r\nThe needs of internally displaced persons are\r\nvery diverse. The ICRC is fully aware that responding\r\nto that wide range of needs demands the commitment\r\nof many bodies and organizations. Again, close\r\ncoordination with other agencies is the best — indeed,\r\nthe only — way to meet the needs of all those who\r\nhave been made to flee their homes and forced to\r\nsettle, temporarily, in makeshift dwellings, eagerly\r\nawaiting their return home.\r\nWe are, of course, aware that, unfortunately, the\r\nterm “temporarily” can mean anything, from a few\r\ndays or months to years, or even decades. Such drawn-\r\nout situations are all-too frequent, and situations of\r\ntransition today are the rule, rather than the exception.\r\nThis brings me to my third point. Transition is a\r\nparticularly sensitive phase characterized by a high\r\nlevel of uncertainty as to how a situation is going to\r\ndevelop – whether there will be lasting peace or new\r\nconflict. It may therefore be necessary to extend relief\r\noperations beyond the immediate post-war situation to\r\nensure that there is no gap between the phasing out of\r\nhumanitarian action and the phasing in of development\r\nprogrammes. Development agencies may have to delay\r\ntheir activities for security reasons or because financial\r\nresources have not yet been committed or cannot be\r\ndisbursed.\r\nIt is the ICRC’s hope that the planned\r\nPeacebuilding Commission will be able to remedy that\r\nsituation and find lasting solutions, allowing\r\ncommunities that have suffered from the scourge of\r\nwar to recover in dignity and look to the future with\r\nconfidence.\r\n29\r\nA/60/PV.52\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to stress the\r\nimportance of this momentum, which comes almost 15\r\nyears after the fundamental resolution adopted by the\r\nGeneral Assembly on the strengthening of the\r\ncoordination of humanitarian emergency assistance of\r\nthe United Nations. This year has witnessed many\r\ninitiatives, from different sources, to improve the\r\nhumanitarian system. The ICRC sees this debate as\r\nessential, and will continue to play its part in it.\r\nProfoundly convinced of the continuing necessity to\r\nbring a better humanitarian response to those in need,\r\nwe will do our utmost to pursue and deepen our\r\nprivileged relationship with United Nations agencies.\r\nAt the same time, we will constantly ensure that we\r\npreserve our own identity, for the good of the victims\r\nwhom we all strive to help.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 47/4 of 16 October 1992,\r\nI call on the Observer for the International\r\nOrganization for Migration.\r\nMr. Dall’Oglio (International Organization for\r\nMigration): The International Organization for\r\nMigration (IOM) welcomes the opportunity to take the\r\nfloor today on the very important topic of the effective\r\ncoordination of humanitarian assistance efforts. As an\r\nactive member of the Inter-Agency Standing\r\nCommittee (IASC), the IOM regards the IASC as the\r\nprincipal mechanism for the coordination of\r\nhumanitarian and disaster relief assistance and as a\r\nmodel of partnership among United Nations\r\nhumanitarian agencies, other intergovernmental bodies,\r\nthe Red Cross and Red Crescent movement and the\r\nnon-governmental organization community.\r\nAnother key coordination element of the\r\nhumanitarian community is the Consolidated Appeals\r\nProcess (CAP). The IOM recognizes the CAP as a\r\nstrategic planning and programming process, not just a\r\nresource mobilization tool. We have gradually\r\nexpanded our participation in that vital process. Final\r\npreparations are currently ongoing for the global\r\nlaunch in 2006, and we expect to take part in seven\r\nappeals out of a total of 12 CAPs.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nStrengthening coordination among different\r\nhumanitarian agencies requires us to take into account\r\nthe changing nature of various emergencies and the\r\nevolution of the participating agencies themselves.\r\nReform and innovative approaches are periodically\r\nneeded. The IASC has recently endorsed a cluster\r\napproach in nine key areas of intervention as a means\r\nto achieve stronger leadership, support and\r\naccountability. These, in turn, are expected to improve\r\nthe predictability, timeliness and effectiveness of the\r\nhumanitarian response to crisis. The cluster approach\r\nwas field tested for the first time during the inter-\r\nagency response to the devastating earthquake in South\r\nAsia, most notably in Pakistan. In responding to that\r\nemergency, IOM has been tasked with the role of\r\ncluster leader in the area of emergency shelter and is\r\nworking in active cooperation with other agencies to\r\nprovide tents and other shelter options through\r\nOperation Winter Race. We believe that that\r\ncoordination effort is bringing the first positive results,\r\nand we are committed to its effectiveness.\r\nClearly, such efforts require timely and\r\npredictable funding if they are to succeed. In this\r\nconnection, IOM welcomes the initiative being taken\r\nby the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian\r\nAffairs (OCHA) to propose an upgraded Central\r\nEmergency Revolving Fund. Facilitated and\r\nstreamlined access, as well as the introduction of a\r\ngrant facility, are important improvements which will\r\nhelp to front-load urgently needed funds and improve\r\nthe capacity for quick response.\r\nThe humanitarian community has been\r\nconfronted in the past year with natural disasters of\r\nunusual — if not unprecedented — magnitude and\r\nfrequency, epitomized by the Asian tsunami and, more\r\nrecently, by the earthquake in South Asia. The growing\r\nhuman, social and financial impact of natural\r\ncatastrophes has been identified as a clear and — at\r\nleast in the short term — irreversible trend, which can\r\nbe addressed only by reinforcing preparedness and\r\ndisaster-mitigation measures, as clearly spelled out in\r\nthe Hyogo Framework for Action.\r\nThe IOM’s humanitarian intervention in response\r\nto natural disasters encompasses assistance to\r\npopulations displaced by such events. Studies\r\nconducted some years ago indicate that 25 million\r\npeople had been forced to migrate owing to\r\nenvironmental disasters. Such disasters can trigger\r\nirregular migration as people are suddenly uprooted\r\nfrom their homes and forced to flee, either internally or\r\nto neighbouring countries, thus increasing the impact\r\nof such movements. People fleeing natural disasters are\r\noften separated from their families and have a high risk\r\nof contracting diseases owing to the breakdown of\r\n30\r\nA/60/PV.52\r\nsocial structures, including loss of access to health\r\ncare. Furthermore, let us not forget that in the\r\naftermath of such events the potential for trafficking in\r\nseparated or orphaned children may increase.\r\nFor all those reasons, we believe that such\r\nmigration movements not only deserve a prompt,\r\ncoordinated response in the short and medium term,\r\nbut that that they also must be fully taken into account\r\nwithin the Hyogo Framework.\r\nIn addition to numerous devastating natural\r\ndisasters, humanitarian agencies have continued to\r\naddress a number of man-made crises. IOM has high\r\nexpectations as to the decision taken at the recent\r\nworld summit to create a Peacebuilding Commission\r\naimed at enhancing the international community’s\r\ncapacity to support war-torn societies, so as to avoid a\r\nrelapse into conflict and to create conditions for\r\nsustainable peace. We believe that the activities of the\r\nPeacebuilding Commission will have strong\r\nimplications for humanitarian agencies active in post-\r\nconflict scenarios, and we look forward to establishing\r\nan open and fruitful cooperation with the Commission.\r\nAllow me to conclude my remarks by reaffirming\r\nthe value that IOM attaches to its participation in the\r\nInter-Agency Standing Committee and our support for\r\nthe ongoing collaborative efforts, including those I\r\nmentioned earlier, made by the Emergency Relief\r\nCoordinator to promote a shared environment for the\r\nattainment of key humanitarian policies and goals.\r\nFinally, we wish to take this opportunity to renew\r\nto Under-Secretary-General Jan Egeland and to his\r\nteam at the Office for the Coordination of\r\nHumanitarian Affairs (OCHA), on behalf of IOM’s\r\nDirector General, our sincere appreciation for the\r\nprofessionalism, dedication and inclusiveness they\r\nhave demonstrated in their collaboration with our\r\norganization.\r\nThe President: In accordance with General\r\nAssembly resolution 54/195 of 17 December 1999, I\r\nnow call on the Observer for the International Union\r\nfor the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources.\r\nMr. Bhagwat-Singh (International Union for the\r\nConservation of Nature and Natural Resources): The\r\nitem under consideration before the General Assembly\r\ntoday is of great relevance and importance. I wish to\r\ncommend the Secretariat for having prepared such\r\ncomprehensive reports on the subject under review.\r\nThe world has witnessed natural disasters of\r\ngrowing magnitude over the past few years, which\r\nhave resulted in heavy losses of life and serious\r\ndamage to the environment and to biodiversity, and\r\nsubsequent long-term damage to the affected areas.\r\nThe response by Governments, United Nations\r\nbodies and the public sector to all those disasters has\r\nbeen prompt, appropriate and very generous. The\r\nInternational Union for the Conservation of Nature and\r\nNatural Resources (IUCN), by nature of its\r\ncomposition, has played a significant role in early\r\nrelief and rehabilitation and in recommendations for\r\nlong-term environmental management. IUCN has a\r\nproven ability to mobilize its members — 82\r\nGovernments and more than 100 non-governmental\r\norganizations, as well as hundreds of practitioners and\r\nscientists, for a common cause. It also has the\r\ninfrastructure, through regional, national and project\r\noffices in 62 countries, to coordinate national and\r\ncross-regional activities.\r\nImmediately following the tsunami disaster,\r\nIUCN, with its regional staff, collaborated with all of\r\nthe organizations involved in the immediate relief,\r\nrehabilitation and recovery efforts. We have had a\r\nseries of meetings with the Secretary-General’s Special\r\nEnvoy for Tsunami Recovery and have submitted to\r\nhim our proposals regarding the restoration of\r\necosystems in the Indian Ocean. We have stressed in\r\nparticular the importance of the mangrove system in\r\nbuttressing coastal areas against environmental\r\ndegradation. In South Asia, mangroves, coastal forests\r\nand wetlands have declined in both surface area and in\r\nterms of their composition, and there is ample evidence\r\nthat fish stocks and other endangered marine species\r\nare also declining or fast disappearing.\r\nIUCN has a large presence in South Asia, and our\r\nstaff in the region was quick to respond to the\r\ndestruction caused by the recent earthquake. Apart\r\nfrom the enormous and tragic loss of life, there has\r\nbeen great damage to the environment, particularly to\r\nforests. Forest products are critical to the survival of\r\ndisaster victims in the coming winter, and the need for\r\nshelter, firewood and wood for reconstruction has\r\nresulted in a new threat to the surviving forests. It is\r\nessential that measures be taken to manage the forests\r\nin a sustainable manner, for the benefit both of the\r\nearthquake-affected people and for future generations.\r\n31\r\nA/60/PV.52\r\nIUCN will be transmitting a comprehensive\r\nversion of this statement electronically to all Missions.\r\nMeanwhile, we wish to assure delegates of IUCN’s\r\ncontinued collaboration and involvement in the support\r\nfor medium- and long-term rehabilitation,\r\nreconstruction and risk-reduction efforts in order to\r\nalleviate the effects of future natural disasters.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nthe debate on agenda item 73 and its sub-items (a), (c)\r\nand (d).\r\nWe shall now proceed to consider draft\r\nresolutions A/60/L.18 to A/60/L.20.\r\nBefore we proceed further, I should like to\r\nconsult the Assembly with a view to considering draft\r\nresolutions A/60/L.19 and A/60/L.20 at this meeting.\r\nIn that connection, since the two draft resolutions were\r\ncirculated only earlier today, it would be necessary to\r\nwaive the relevant provision of rule 78 of the rules of\r\nprocedure.\r\nThe relevant provision of rule 78 reads as\r\nfollows:\r\n“As a general rule, no proposal shall be discussed\r\nor put to the vote at any meeting of the General\r\nAssembly unless copies of it have been circulated\r\nto all delegations not later than the day preceding\r\nthe meeting.”\r\nUnless I hear any objection, I shall take it that the\r\nAssembly agrees with this proposal.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In connection with draft\r\nresolution A/60/L.18, I should like to give the floor to\r\nthe representative of the Secretariat.\r\nMr. Botnaru (Chief, General Assembly Affairs\r\nBranch): I should like to inform representatives that, in\r\nconnection with draft resolution A/60/L.18, I wish to\r\nplace on record the following statement of financial\r\nimplications on behalf of the Secretary-General.\r\nBy operative paragraph 6 of the draft resolution,\r\nthe General Assembly\r\n“Requests the Secretary-General to appoint\r\na special envoy in order to, inter alia, sustain the\r\npolitical will of the international community to\r\nsupport medium- and long-term rehabilitation,\r\nreconstruction and risk reduction efforts”.\r\nThe resources that would be required in\r\nconnection with the appointment of the special envoy\r\nwould be financed exclusively from extrabudgetary\r\nresources. Therefore, should the General Assembly\r\nadopt draft resolution A/60/L.18, there would be no\r\nfinancial implications for the regular budget.\r\nI should like to inform members that the title of\r\ndraft resolution A/60/L.18 on the reissued version that\r\nwas distributed in the General Assembly Hall earlier\r\nthis afternoon should read: “Strengthening emergency\r\nrelief, rehabilitation, reconstruction and prevention in\r\nthe aftermath of the South Asian earthquake disaster —\r\nPakistan”. The title will be reflected in the final\r\nversion of the draft resolution.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now take a\r\ndecision on draft resolutions A/60/L.18, A/60/L.19 and\r\nA/60/L.20.\r\nDraft resolution A/60/L.18 is entitled\r\n“Strengthening emergency relief, rehabilitation,\r\nreconstruction and prevention in the aftermath of the\r\nSouth Asian earthquake disaster — Pakistan”. There is\r\na list of additional sponsors, which I will read out:\r\nAndorra, Angola, the Bahamas, Cameroon, Cape\r\nVerde, Eritrea, Guyana, Iraq, Liechtenstein, Lithuania,\r\nLuxembourg, Madagascar, Malawi, Malta, the\r\nMarshall Islands, Mongolia, Nepal, Serbia and\r\nMontenegro, South Africa, Tajikistan and the United\r\nArab Emirates.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/60/L.18?\r\nDraft resolution A/60/L.18 was adopted\r\n(resolution 60/13).\r\nThe President: We now turn to draft resolution\r\nA/60/L.19, entitled “Strengthening of international\r\ncooperation and coordination of efforts to study,\r\nmitigate and minimize the consequences of the\r\nChernobyl disaster”. Additional sponsors are the\r\nfollowing: Angola, Bangladesh, Iceland, India, Malta,\r\nMongolia, the Republic of Korea, Slovakia and Spain.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/60/L.19?\r\nDraft resolution A/60/L.19 was adopted\r\n(resolution 60/14).\r\nThe President: We now turn to draft resolution\r\nA/60/L.20, entitled “Strengthening emergency relief,\r\nrehabilitation, reconstruction and prevention in the\r\n32\r\nA/60/PV.52\r\naftermath of the Indian Ocean tsunami disaster”. There\r\nis a long list of additional sponsors: Afghanistan,\r\nAndorra, Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas,\r\nBelgium, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,\r\nBulgaria, Cape Verde, Colombia, Côte d’Ivoire,\r\nCroatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Djibouti, Estonia,\r\nFrance, Grenada, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, India,\r\nIreland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Madagascar,\r\nMalta, Marshall Islands, Mongolia, Morocco,\r\nNicaragua, Norway, Oman, Poland, Qatar, Samoa,\r\nSerbia and Montenegro, Slovenia, Sweden, the former\r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Togo, Tunisia,\r\nTurkey, Tuvalu, Ukraine, the United States of America\r\nand Zambia.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the Assembly\r\nto adopt draft resolution A/60/L.20?\r\nDraft resolution A/60/L.20 was adopted\r\n(resolution 60/15).\r\nThe President: Before calling on representatives\r\nwho have requested to speak in exercise of the right of\r\nreply, I remind members that, in accordance with\r\nGeneral Assembly decision 34/401, statements in\r\nexercise of the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes\r\nfor the first intervention and to five minutes for the\r\nsecond and should be made by delegations from their\r\nseats.\r\nMs. Oron (Israel): As I listened to the statement\r\nof my Palestinian colleague, I realized to my regret that\r\nI was hearing the same recording that I have heard so\r\nmany times in the past. Unlike the situation in Israel\r\nand the Palestinian territories, which has dramatically\r\nchanged during recent years, my colleague’s statement\r\nemployed the same rhetoric, omissions, factual\r\ninaccuracies and crude generalizations.\r\nAlthough the Palestinian observer may want the\r\nAssembly to believe otherwise, the situation has\r\nchanged over the past years. Despite violence and\r\ndespair during the intifada, there was a peace process\r\nprior to it, during which the two sides signed\r\ninternational agreements and the Palestinian Authority\r\nwas created. Less than a year ago, new hope was\r\ncreated when Prime Minister Sharon and Chairman\r\nMahmoud Abbas met in Sharm el-Sheikh and when\r\nboth expressed a commitment to a peaceful settlement\r\naccording to the road map.\r\nThis past summer, Prime Minister Sharon took a\r\nbold and courageous move by disengaging all troops\r\nand civilians from all of the Gaza Strip and parts of the\r\nnorthern West Bank. Furthermore, constructive\r\nnegotiations are currently taking place over\r\ntransferring control of the Rafah border crossing\r\nbetween Gaza and Egypt. What has not changed,\r\nhowever, is the unwillingness of the Palestinian\r\nAuthority to confront terrorism and fulfil its first\r\nobligation under the road map, to dismantle the\r\nterrorist infrastructure and collect arms.\r\nPalestinian terrorists continue to kill Israeli\r\ncivilians and fire Qassam rockets onto Israeli towns\r\nand cities. There have been more than 26,000 terrorist\r\nattacks perpetrated against Israeli targets during the\r\npast five years. There should be no doubt about the\r\nimpetus for those attacks. They were carried out with\r\nthe sole intention to murder, targeting as many\r\nchildren, women and men as possible.\r\nNeither side has a monopoly on suffering; nor can\r\neither side fail to assume their commitments. I invite\r\nmy Palestinian colleagues to discontinue unhelpful\r\nrhetoric and utilize the current momentum for peace.\r\nIsrael will further elaborate on that subject when the\r\nGeneral Assembly takes action on the relevant draft\r\nresolution.\r\nThe President: I call on the observer of\r\nPalestine.\r\nMr. Hijazi (Palestine): It is easy to use red-\r\nherring arguments, as the Israeli representative just did,\r\nin order to divert attention from the indisputable\r\ninformation presented about the grave violations of\r\ninternational law that we referred to earlier in our\r\nstatement. The fact remains that until and unless Israel\r\nhalts its military campaign against the Palestinian\r\npeople, Israel will be held responsible for its practices.\r\nFurthermore, the systematic destruction of the\r\nPalestinian people’s infrastructure and all their\r\ndevelopment projects, as well as the deprivation of\r\ntheir sovereignty over their land and resources, are the\r\ndirect result of a clear policy adopted by the State of\r\nIsrael, the occupying Power.\r\nThe Israeli representative referred to the\r\nwithdrawal from Gaza. The exit, though significant in\r\nthat it set a precedent, was 38 years too late and was\r\ndone in a manner that left the Gaza Strip and its\r\n1.3 million inhabitants prisoners, denied access to the\r\nrest of the world and to the other parts of the occupied\r\nPalestinian territories. Furthermore, I would like to\r\n33\r\nA/60/PV.52\r\nremind the Israeli representative of a point that her\r\nGovernment often conveniently omits from the\r\ndiscussion on the Gaza Strip exit, and that is that\r\nIsraeli occupation forces continue to maintain effective\r\ncontrol over the Gaza Strip by land, sea and air.\r\nThe Gaza Strip was left in ruins and is now\r\nexperiencing the effects of never-before-used Israeli\r\nweapons, including artillery rounds. Gaza residents\r\nhave been violently shaken out of their sleep, as their\r\nwindows shatter from the effects of repeated sonic\r\nbooms over their skies at intensities never experienced\r\nbefore. That imprisoned population is now also held\r\nhostage and terrorized.\r\nNumbers and figures in this conflict are a\r\npowerful identifier of the aggressor and the aggressed-\r\nupon. It is interesting that the Israeli delegate chose to\r\nbring up numbers and figures, since she must know\r\nthat her occupying forces have, over the past four years\r\nalone, killed more than 4,000 Palestinians, including\r\n682 children. The delegate, no doubt, also knows better\r\nthan all of us the exact figure, totalling into the tens of\r\nthousands of rounds of ammunition, artillery and\r\nrockets weighing up to 1,000 kilos, that the Israeli\r\noccupation forces have used against Palestinian\r\npopulation centres. We invite her to share that figure\r\nwith us.\r\nIt is only when Israel, the occupying Power, puts\r\nan end to its occupation, and with that, an end to the\r\nsuffering of the Palestinian people for 38 years now,\r\nthat the international assistance would be fruitful and\r\nattain its desired and noble goal.\r\nThe President: In the course of today’s debate,\r\nspeakers referred to the unprecedented number and\r\nscale of disasters during this past year, and we have\r\nalso heard the views of Member States on the follow-\r\nup to the Chernobyl disaster. I have taken note of the\r\nviews of delegations for a special meeting of the\r\nGeneral Assembly in that regard.\r\nI am glad that speakers have underlined the\r\nimportance of humanitarian principles, as enshrined in\r\nresolution 46/182, as well as in the world summit\r\noutcome document. I also note the praise for the\r\nselfless work undertaken by the humanitarian workers\r\naround the world, under difficult conditions, and\r\nespecially the appeal for their free and unhindered\r\naccess to areas struck by disaster and devastation.\r\nThe envisaged transformation of the Central\r\nEmergency Revolving Fund was generally welcomed\r\nduring this debate. At the same time, the view was\r\nexpressed that it is also important to consider resources\r\nfrom actors not traditionally considered to be\r\nhumanitarian actors, such as the private sector and civil\r\nsociety. The necessity of the predictability of\r\nhumanitarian aid and assistance was stressed, together\r\nwith the importance of follow-up to the pledges made\r\nat donor conferences and better monitoring of\r\nhumanitarian assistance by way of an institutionalized\r\nmechanism. A similar mechanism has also been\r\nrequested in other fields of development.\r\nAs President of the General Assembly and former\r\nUnder-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, I\r\nvery much appreciate the fact that most speakers\r\nexpressed appreciation to Under-Secretary-General Jan\r\nEgeland for his important work and the work of his\r\nstaff, and I support the expressed need for the further\r\nstrengthening of capacity-building within the Office\r\nfor the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. In the\r\nsame vein, more needs to be done to strengthen the\r\nsystem-wide coherence and coordination of United\r\nNations efforts in the humanitarian field. Here,\r\ncountries’ expertise and the involvement of regional\r\norganizations are of great significance.\r\nFinally, I would like to emphasize that although\r\nwe have finished today’s debate, we are not closing\r\nthis very important item. I would like to recall the\r\nimportant work to which I referred earlier — aimed at\r\nthe security and safety of humanitarian personnel —\r\nthat is still going on in the Second and Sixth\r\nCommittees and elsewhere in the United Nations\r\nsystem. This debate has, in my view, reminded us of\r\nthe importance of the humanitarian imperative. It has\r\nalso reminded us that that imperative requires action:\r\naction in the field to save and improve the lives of\r\nmillions of vulnerable fellow human beings.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the General\r\nAssembly to conclude its consideration of sub-item (c)\r\nof agenda item 73?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: The General Assembly has thus\r\nconcluded this stage of its consideration of agenda item\r\n73 and its sub-items (a) and (d).\r\n34\r\nA/60/PV.52\r\nAgenda item 42 (continued)\r\nGlobal Agenda for Dialogue among Civilizations\r\nDraft resolution (A/60/L.17)\r\nThe President: Members will recall that the\r\nGeneral Assembly held the debate on agenda item 42,\r\njointly with agenda item 43, at its 35th and 36th\r\nplenary meetings, on 20 October.\r\nI give the floor to the representative of Mongolia\r\nto introduce draft resolution A/60/L.17.\r\nMs. Enkhtsetseg (Mongolia): I have the distinct\r\nhonour to introduce draft resolution A/60/L.17, entitled\r\n“Eight hundred years of Mongolian statehood”, on\r\nbehalf of the sponsors listed in the document: Austria,\r\nAzerbaijan, Bangladesh, the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea, France, Germany, Greece, Haiti,\r\nIndia, Jamaica, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Luxembourg,\r\nMalawi, Monaco, Morocco, the Philippines, Qatar, the\r\nRussian Federation, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Turkey, the\r\nUnited States of America and my own country,\r\nMongolia. In addition, I am pleased to announce that\r\nsince the publication of the draft resolution, the\r\nfollowing countries have joined the list of sponsors:\r\nAustralia, Canada, Iceland, Indonesia, Italy, Japan,\r\nOman, Romania, Slovenia, the Syrian Arab Republic,\r\nthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and\r\nTurkmenistan.\r\nCivilizational achievements constitute the\r\ncollective heritage of mankind. Embracing such action\r\nand working to achieve an objective understanding of\r\nall civilizations are of special significance for\r\nenhancing constructive interaction and cooperative\r\nengagement among all civilizations. Yet a rich and\r\ndiverse civilization created by nomadic peoples across\r\nthe globe — most notably on the vast expanses of the\r\nEuro-Asian steppe — as so far received little attention\r\nwithin the overall framework of the global agenda\r\naimed at dialogue among civilizations.\r\nNomadic civilization has existed mostly in\r\npeaceful symbiosis with sedentary societies and has\r\nplayed an important role in the development of\r\nextensive trade networks and in the creation of large\r\nadministrative cultural, religious and commercial\r\ncentres. Studies indicate that the nomadic peoples of\r\nArabic, Finnish, Mongolic, Turkic and other origins\r\nhave significantly influenced societies throughout the\r\nworld. Their mobility has been instrumental in making\r\npossible the free flow of ideas across regions, thus\r\ncontributing to the shape of the modern world.\r\nIndeed, nomadic civilization has served for\r\nthousands of years as a bridge between world\r\ncivilizations. The culture of living in harmony with\r\nnature, which is inherent in nomadic civilization,\r\nallows the preservation of the delicate ecological\r\nbalance of natural habitats. This ability of nomads to\r\nadapt to nature’s whims has a heightened validity today\r\nagainst the backdrop of current environmental threats\r\nand challenges.\r\nMongolia is a nomadic State. My nation’s\r\ntraditions, values and culture, as well as its very\r\nmentality and self-identity, stem from its nomadic\r\nroots. Mongolia is also an ancient country; it will\r\ncelebrate the eight hundredth anniversary of its\r\nstatehood next year. As my President said from this\r\nrostrum at the September summit, “Anniversaries\r\nprovoke recollections over the past and projections for\r\nthe future” (A/60/PV.5, p. 27). Therefore, the eight\r\nhundredth anniversary provides us with an opportunity\r\nnot only to look back at the legacies of our forefathers,\r\nbut also to take up more closely the study of nomadic\r\ncivilization.\r\nAccordingly, the draft resolution now before the\r\nAssembly has two main themes that are intricately\r\nintertwined and mutually reinforcing. First, it seeks to\r\nreinforce the concept of dialogue among civilizations,\r\nbringing the role and contribution of nomadic\r\ncivilization into the global agenda. It also reaffirms the\r\nimportance of preserving and developing the centuries-\r\nold traditions and culture of nomadic peoples in\r\nmodern societies. In addition, it seeks to encourage\r\nrenewed interest in studying various aspects of\r\nnomadic civilization on the part of relevant\r\ninternational organizations, civil society and academia,\r\nthus contributing to mutual understanding among\r\ncivilizations and cultures.\r\nThe draft resolution also acknowledges the\r\ncenturies-old statehood of Mongolia, welcomes the\r\nefforts of my Government to celebrate its eight\r\nhundredth anniversary next year and invites Member\r\nStates, the United Nations, other organizations,\r\nacademia and civil society to take part actively in the\r\nevents to be organized in celebration of this\r\nanniversary.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation wishes to express\r\nits wholehearted gratitude and appreciation to all our\r\n35\r\nA/60/PV.52\r\nfellow sponsors for their valuable support and\r\nsolidarity. On their behalf, we express our confidence\r\nthat the draft resolution will command the broadest\r\npossible support of the Assembly and that it will be\r\nadopted by consensus.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now take a\r\ndecision on draft resolution A/60/L.17, entitled “Eight\r\nhundred years of Mongolian statehood”.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/60/L.17?\r\nDraft resolution A/60/L.17 was adopted\r\n(resolution 60/16).\r\nThe President: May I take it that it is the wish of\r\nthe General Assembly to conclude its consideration of\r\nagenda item 42?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.30 p.m.\r\n"
