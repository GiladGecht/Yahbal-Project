subsidiary organs and\r\nother elections\r\n(c) Election of the Executive Director of the United\r\nNations Environment Programme\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/60/553)\r\nThe Acting Chairman: In his note, the\r\nSecretary-General informs the General Assembly that\r\nin its decision 56/312 of 21 November 2001 the\r\nAssembly re-elected Mr. Klaus Töpfer as Executive\r\nDirector of the United Nations Environment\r\nProgramme (UNEP) for a four-year term, beginning on\r\n1 February 2002 and ending on 31 January 2006.\r\nIn accordance with section II, paragraph 2, of\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 2997 (XXVII) and\r\nbearing in mind Mr. Töpfer’s decision not to seek a\r\nfurther term as Executive Director of the Programme,\r\nthe Secretary-General proposes a two-month extension\r\nof Mr. Töpfer’s appointment until 31 March 2006,\r\nwhich would allow time to identify a suitable successor\r\nand ensure continuity in the work of UNEP and its\r\nGoverning Council.\r\nAccordingly, may I take it that the General\r\nAssembly wishes to extend Mr. Klaus Töpfer’s\r\nappointment as Executive Director of the United\r\nNations Environment Programme for two months, until\r\nthe end of March 2006?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: The General Assembly\r\nhas thus concluded this stage of its consideration of\r\nsub-item (c) of agenda item 112.\r\nReports of the Fifth Committee\r\nThe Acting President: The General Assembly\r\nwill consider the reports of the Fifth Committee on\r\nagenda items 113 (a) to (e), 138 and 145.\r\nIf there is no proposal under rule 66 of the rules\r\nof procedure, I shall take it that the General Assembly\r\ndecides not to discuss the reports of the Fifth\r\nCommittee that are before it today.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: Statements will therefore\r\nbe limited to explanations of vote.\r\nThe positions of delegations regarding the\r\nrecommendations of the Fifth Committee have been\r\nmade clear in the Committee and are reflected in the\r\nrelevant official records.\r\nMay I remind members that, under paragraph 7 of\r\ndecision 34/401, the General Assembly agreed that:\r\n2\r\nA/60/PV.53\r\n“When the same draft resolution is\r\nconsidered in a Main Committee and in plenary\r\nmeeting, a delegation should, as far as possible,\r\nexplain its vote only once, that is, either in the\r\nCommittee or in plenary meeting, unless that\r\ndelegation’s vote in the plenary meeting is\r\ndifferent from its vote in the Committee.”\r\nMay I remind delegations that, also in accordance\r\nwith General Assembly decision 34/401, explanations\r\nof vote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made\r\nby delegations from their seats.\r\nBefore we begin to take action on the\r\nrecommendations contained in the reports of the Fifth\r\nCommittee, I should like to advise representatives that\r\nwe are going to proceed to take decisions in the same\r\nmanner as was done in the Fifth Committee, unless\r\nnotified otherwise in advance.\r\nI therefore hope that we may proceed to adopt\r\nwithout a vote those recommendations that were\r\nadopted without a vote in the Fifth Committee.\r\nAgenda

The relevant report of the Committee is\r\ncontained in document A/60/514, and the draft\r\nresolution recommended to the Assembly for adoption\r\nis reproduced in paragraph 7 thereof.\r\nUnder the terms of the draft resolution, the\r\nGeneral Assembly would, inter alia, approve the\r\nguidelines and recommendations regarding the\r\nexecution of the Programme for the biennium 2006-\r\n2007 and authorize the Secretary-General to carry out\r\nin the biennium the activities specified in section III of\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General on the Programme.\r\nIt would also request the Secretary-General to continue\r\nto provide the necessary resources to the budget for the\r\nProgramme for the next and future bienniums.\r\nFurthermore, the Assembly would recognize the\r\nimportance of United Nations recurrent legal\r\npublications listed in the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and strongly encourage their continued\r\npublication.\r\nThe Sixth Committee adopted the draft resolution\r\nwithout a vote, and I hope that the Assembly will be in\r\na position to do the same.\r\nI turn now to the report of the Sixth Committee\r\non agenda item 79, “Report of the United Nations\r\nCommission on International Trade Law on the work\r\nof its thirty-eighth session”. The report is contained in\r\ndocument A/60/515, and the two draft resolutions\r\nrecommended to the General Assembly for adoption\r\nare reproduced in paragraph 10 thereof.\r\nUnder the terms of draft resolution I, entitled\r\n“Report of the United Nations Commission on\r\nInternational Trade Law on the work of its thirty-eighth\r\nsession”, the General Assembly would, among others\r\nthings, endorse the efforts and initiatives of the\r\nCommission, as the core legal body within the United\r\nNations system in the field of international trade law. It\r\nwould also reaffirm the importance, in particular for\r\ndeveloping countries, of the work of the Commission\r\nconcerned with technical assistance in the field of\r\ninternational trade law reform and development and\r\nwould, in this connection, appeal to Governments, the\r\nrelevant bodies of the United Nations system,\r\norganizations, institutions and individuals to make\r\nvoluntary contributions to the relevant trust fund and to\r\nsupport the technical assistance programme of the\r\nCommission.\r\nFurthermore, the Assembly would encourage the\r\nCommission to further explore different approaches to\r\nthe use of partnerships with non-State actors in the\r\nimplementation of its mandate, in particular in the area\r\nof technical assistance. The Assembly would also take\r\nnote with appreciation of the preparation of digests of\r\ncase law relating to the texts of the Commission and\r\nwould welcome the Commission’s decision to hold a\r\ncongress on international trade law.\r\nI am pleased to note that draft resolution II under\r\nthis agenda item contains the annex to the United\r\nNations Convention on the Use of Electronic\r\nCommunications in International Contracts. Under the\r\nterms of the draft resolution, the General Assembly\r\nwould, after expressing its appreciation to the\r\nCommission for preparing the draft Convention, adopt\r\nthe Convention and request the Secretary-General to\r\nopen it for signature. It would also call upon States to\r\nconsider becoming parties to it. In accordance with its\r\narticle 16, the Convention shall be open for signature\r\nby all States from 16 January 2006 until 16 January\r\n2008.\r\nThe Sixth Committee adopted the two draft\r\nresolutions without a vote, and it is hoped that the\r\nAssembly will do the same.\r\nI now invite the Assembly’s attention to agenda\r\nitem 80, “Report of the International Law Commission\r\non the work of its fifty-seventh session”. The relevant\r\nreport of the Sixth Committee is contained in document\r\nA/60/516, and the draft resolution, which the\r\n5\r\nA/60/PV.53\r\nCommittee recommends to the Assembly for adoption,\r\nis set out in paragraph 8 thereof.\r\nBy the terms of the draft resolution, the General\r\nAssembly would, inter alia, take note of the report of\r\nthe International Law Commission on the work of its\r\nfifty-seventh session and encourage the Commission to\r\ncomplete work on those items which are near\r\ncompletion at its fifty-eighth session. The Assembly\r\nwould draw the attention of Governments to the\r\nimportance for the International Law Commission of\r\nhaving their views on the draft articles and\r\ncommentary on diplomatic protection and on the draft\r\nprinciples on allocation of loss in the case of\r\ntransboundary harm arising out of hazardous activities,\r\nboth of which were adopted at the fifty-sixth session of\r\nthe Commission in 2004.\r\nThe General Assembly would also invite\r\nGovernments to provide information on other topics, as\r\nrequested in chapter III of the Commission’s report.\r\nFurthermore, the Assembly would approve the\r\nCommission’s conclusions regarding summary records\r\nof the Commission and reaffirm its previous decisions\r\nconcerning the documentation and summary records of\r\nthe International Law Commission.\r\nThe Assembly would also encourage Member\r\nStates to consider being represented at the level of\r\nlegal adviser during the first week in which the report\r\nof the International Law Commission is discussed in\r\nthe Sixth Committee — International Law Week — so\r\nas to enable high-level discussions on issues of\r\ninternational law. In addition, the Assembly would\r\ndecide that the next session of the Commission would\r\nbe held at the United Nations Office at Geneva from 1\r\nMay to 9 June and from 3 July to 11 August 2006.\r\nThe Sixth Committee adopted the draft resolution\r\nwithout a vote, and it is hoped that the Assembly will\r\ndo the same.\r\nI turn now to agenda item 82, entitled “Report of\r\nthe Special Committee on the Charter of the United\r\nNations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the\r\nOrganization”. The report of the Sixth Committee on\r\nthis item is contained in document A/60/517. The draft\r\nresolution which the Sixth Committee recommends for\r\nadoption by the General Assembly is reproduced in\r\nparagraph 10 of the report.\r\nBy the terms of the draft resolution, the General\r\nAssembly would, among other things, request the\r\nSpecial Committee, at its next session in 2006, to\r\ncontinue its consideration of all proposals concerning\r\nthe question of the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security in all its aspects in order to strengthen the\r\nrole of the United Nations. The Special Committee\r\nwould also be requested to continue to consider, on a\r\npriority basis and in an appropriate substantive manner\r\nand framework, the question of the implementation of\r\nthe provisions of the Charter of the United Nations\r\nrelated to assistance to third States affected by the\r\napplication of sanctions under Chapter VII of the\r\nCharter and to consider, also on a priority basis, ways\r\nand means of improving its working methods and\r\nenhancing its efficiency.\r\nFurthermore, the Special Committee would be\r\nrequested to consider, as appropriate, any proposal\r\nreferred to it by the General Assembly in the\r\nimplementation of the decisions of the High-level\r\nPlenary Meeting of the sixtieth session of the General\r\nAssembly in September 2005 that concern the Charter\r\nof the United Nations and amendments thereto.\r\nAdditionally, the Assembly would welcome the\r\nestablishment of the trust fund to eliminate the backlog\r\nof the Repertory of Practice of United Nations Organs\r\nand would encourage States to make voluntary\r\ncontributions to it. It would also endorse the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s efforts to eliminate the backlog of the\r\nRepertoire of the Practice of the Security Council and\r\nwould encourage contributions to the trust fund for its\r\nupdating. It would further request the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to submit a report on both publications to the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-first session.\r\nThe Sixth Committee adopted the draft resolution\r\nwithout a vote, and I hope that the Assembly will be in\r\na position to do likewise.\r\nLet me now turn to agenda item 153, “Report of\r\nthe Committee on Relations with the Host Country”.\r\nThe report of the Sixth Committee on this item is\r\ncontained in document A/60/520.

Finally,\r\nthanks and appreciation are also due to all\r\nrepresentatives and colleagues for their invaluable\r\ncontributions to the success of this session.\r\nThe Acting President: If there is no proposal\r\nunder rule 66 of the rules of procedure, I shall take it\r\nthat the General Assembly decides not to discuss the\r\nreports of the Sixth Committee that are before the\r\nAssembly today.\r\n7\r\nA/60/PV.53\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: Statements will therefore\r\nbe limited to explanations of vote.\r\nThe positions of delegations regarding the\r\nrecommendations of the Sixth Committee have been\r\nmade clear in the Committee and are reflected in the\r\nrelevant official records.\r\nMay I remind members that, under paragraph 7 of\r\ndecision 34/401, the General Assembly agreed that\r\n“When the same draft resolution is\r\nconsidered in a Main Committee and in plenary\r\nmeeting, a delegation should, as far as possible,\r\nexplain its vote only once, that is, either in the\r\nCommittee or in plenary meeting, unless that\r\ndelegation’s vote in plenary meeting is different\r\nfrom its vote in the Committee.”\r\nMay I remind delegations that explanations of\r\nvote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by\r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nBefore we begin to take action on the\r\nrecommendations contained in the reports of the Sixth\r\nCommittee, I should like to advise representatives that\r\nwe are going to take decisions in the same manner as\r\nwas done in the Sixth Committee, unless the\r\nSecretariat is notified otherwise in advance.

That brings the total number of\r\nsponsors for this resolution to 88.\r\nOn 8 November, the President of the International\r\nCriminal Court presented the first annual report of the\r\nCourt to this body. We had a very constructive and in-\r\ndepth debate at that time, and I do not want to repeat\r\nthat discussion here today. Allow me, however, to\r\nhighlight just a few elements.\r\nThe report of the International Criminal Court\r\nand the debate in this body a few weeks ago underlined\r\nthe important role that the Court plays in our common\r\nmultilateral system that aims to end impunity and to\r\nestablish the rule of law, to promote and encourage\r\nrespect for human rights and to restore and maintain\r\ninternational peace and security. The establishment of\r\nthe Court was the most significant development in\r\nrecent years in the long struggle to eradicate impunity.\r\nWe are therefore very pleased that substantial progress\r\nhas been achieved in making the Court fully\r\noperational. The annual report clearly demonstrates\r\nthat progress.\r\nThe Court is now at the beginning of the judicial\r\nphase of its operations, involving both operations in\r\nthe field and courtroom proceedings. The issuance of\r\narrest warrants against five leaders of the Lord’s\r\nResistance Army is a clear indication of that fact. The\r\nreferral by the Security Council this spring of the\r\nsituation in Darfur to the International Criminal\r\nCourt’s Prosecutor and the opening of an investigation\r\ninto that situation by the Prosecutor were other\r\nimportant milestones. The fact that all Security Council\r\n10\r\nA/60/PV.53\r\nmembers were directly or indirectly supportive of that\r\nreferral was a very welcome development, and proof of\r\nthe growing support for the Court. The President of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court in his address to the\r\nGeneral Assembly stressed the fact that cooperation\r\nbetween the Court and the United Nations and\r\ncooperation with States, international organizations and\r\ncivil society are fundamental to an effective and\r\nefficient functioning Court, especially now that the\r\nCourt has started the judicial phase of its work. We call\r\non all concerned to heed his call.\r\nWhile all States are free to choose whether to\r\nbecome a party to the Rome Statute or not, recently we\r\nwere happy to welcome the one-hundredth ratification\r\nof the Statute by Mexico. We will continue to strive for\r\na universal membership to the Rome Statute and it is\r\ntherefore our sincere hope that more States will soon\r\nratify it.\r\nThe draft resolution before us today serves three\r\nmain objectives: first, to indicate political support for\r\nthe International Criminal Court as an organization, for\r\nits aims and for the work it carries out.\r\nSecondly, it underlines the importance of the\r\nrelationship agreement concluded with the United\r\nNations, which serves as a framework for the close\r\ncooperation between the two organizations. Thirdly, it\r\nserves to remind States of the need to cooperate with\r\nthe International Criminal Court as it carries out its\r\ntasks.\r\nThe Netherlands hopes that the adoption of the\r\ndraft resolution today will lead to even greater support\r\nfor the International Criminal Court in its fight against\r\nimpunity and in its attempts to hold those accused of\r\nvery serious crimes accountable for their actions. In\r\nthat context, we look forward to the second annual\r\nreport of the International Criminal Court and its\r\nconsideration during next year’s session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nThe Acting President: We shall now proceed to\r\nconsider draft resolution A/60/L.25. Before giving the\r\nfloor to the speakers in explanation of vote before the\r\nvote, may I remind delegations that explanations of\r\nvote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by\r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMs. Willson (United States of America): Our\r\nconcerns about the Rome Statute and the International\r\nCriminal Court (ICC) are well known. They include the\r\nCourt’s assertion of jurisdiction over nationals of\r\nStates not parties to the Rome Statute, including United\r\nStates nationals, and the lack of adequate oversight of\r\nthe Court’s activities, including those of the Prosecutor,\r\nwho may initiate cases without first seeking approval\r\nof the Security Council.\r\nAs in past years, those concerns require the\r\nUnited States to disassociate itself from consensus on\r\nthe draft resolution. While our concerns about the\r\nCourt have not changed, we would like to move\r\nbeyond divisiveness on the issue. We share the\r\ncommitment of parties to the Rome Statute to bring to\r\njustice those who perpetrate genocide, war crimes and\r\ncrimes against humanity. While we have honest\r\ndifferences on how accountability is best achieved, we\r\nmust work together to ensure that perpetrators of the\r\natrocities are held accountable for their actions.\r\nThe actions of the United States demonstrate\r\nclearly that we have been and continue to be among the\r\nmost forceful advocates of the principle of\r\naccountability for war crimes, genocide and crimes\r\nagainst humanity. We demonstrated our willingness to\r\nwork instructively on those matters in connection with\r\nDarfur, where it was the United States that concluded\r\nthat genocide had occurred and it was the United States\r\nthat called for and supported the creation of the\r\nInternational Commission of Inquiry on Darfur.\r\nWhile we would have preferred a different\r\nmechanism, we believed it was important for the\r\ninternational community to speak with one voice and to\r\nact decisively. Consequently, we accepted referral of\r\nthe Darfur situation by the Security Council to the\r\nCourt. Those events demonstrate that there can be\r\ncommon ground when both sides are willing to work\r\nconstructively.\r\nI would like to emphasize today what we have\r\nsaid in the past. We respect the right of other States to\r\nbecome parties to the Rome Statute. We ask in return,\r\nhowever, that other States respect our decision not to\r\ndo so. With respect to the draft resolution, we made\r\ngood faith efforts to work with supporters of the Court\r\non language that would reflect that simple principle.\r\nWe were deeply disappointed that our efforts to turn a\r\nnew page were rejected.\r\nAs we move forward, we urge Court supporters to\r\nreciprocate our efforts to seek common ground and\r\navoid divisiveness. In our view, that begins with an\r\nacknowledgement that there are honest differences of\r\n11\r\nA/60/PV.53\r\nview on the issues and an acknowledgement of the\r\nright of the United States and other States to decide not\r\nto become Parties to the Court and not to subject their\r\ncitizens and officials to its jurisdiction. That should not\r\nbe too much to ask.\r\nWe have noted in the past the importance we\r\nattach to the principle adopted by the General\r\nAssembly in resolution 58/318 that the costs of any\r\nassistance or services provided by the United Nations\r\nto the Court must be fully reimbursed to the United\r\nNations. We are pleased that the sponsors of the draft\r\nresolution were willing to make that clear in the draft.\r\nEfforts to include language in resolutions of the\r\nGeneral Assembly or Security Council that are\r\ninconsistent with the basic respect for the honest\r\ndifferences of views about the Court serve only to\r\nexacerbate divisions and make it more difficult for the\r\ninternational community to pursue common approaches\r\nin the fight against impunity. Not every issue needs to\r\nbe turned into a debate about the role of the Court. It is\r\nour hope, as we move forward, that efforts by all\r\nparties to work constructively and in good faith will\r\nallow us to spend less time arguing over the Court and\r\nmore time working together to ensure accountability\r\nfor serious crimes.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the only\r\nspeaker in explanation of vote before the vote. The\r\nAssembly will now take a decision on draft resolution\r\nA/60/L.25. May I take it that the Assembly decides to\r\nadopt draft resolution A/60/L.25?\r\nDraft resolution A/60/L.25 was adopted\r\n(resolution 60/29).\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is the\r\nwish of the General Assembly to conclude its\r\nconsideration of agenda item 81?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe Acting President: I would like to inform\r\nmembers that, in addition to the items already\r\nscheduled for Monday morning, 28 November, the\r\nGeneral Assembly will resume its consideration of the\r\nfollowing agenda items, to take action on several draft\r\nresolutions: agenda item 41, “Report of the Economic\r\nand Social Council”, to take action on draft resolutions\r\nA/60/L.21 and A/60/L.24; and agenda item 120,\r\n“Follow-up to the outcome of the Millennium\r\nSummit”, to take action on draft resolution A/60/L.26.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11.10 a.m.\r\n"
