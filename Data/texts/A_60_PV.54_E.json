(Sweden)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 75\r\nOceans and the law of the sea\r\n(a) Oceans and the law of the sea\r\nReports of the Secretary-General (A/60/63 and\r\nAdd.1 and Add.2 and A/60/91)\r\nReport of the United Nations Open-ended\r\nInformal Consultative Process on Oceans and\r\nthe Law of the Sea at its sixth meeting (A/60/99)\r\nDraft resolution (A/60/L.22)\r\n(b) Sustainable fisheries, including through the\r\n1995 Agreement for the Implementation of the\r\nProvisions of the United Nations Convention on\r\nthe Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982\r\nrelating to the Conservation and Management\r\nof Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory\r\nFish Stocks, and related instruments\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/60/189)\r\nDraft resolution (A/60/L.23)\r\nThe President: I give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Brazil to introduce draft resolution\r\nA/60/L.22.\r\nMr. Sardenberg (Brazil): Once again this year,\r\nunder sub-item (a) of agenda item 75, Brazil has had\r\nthe honour to coordinate informal consultations on\r\noceans and the law of the sea. On behalf of its\r\nsponsors, I have the pleasure today to introduce draft\r\nresolution A/60/L.22, entitled “Oceans and the law of\r\nthe sea”.\r\nI wish to inform members that since the\r\npublication of the draft resolution, the following\r\ncountries have also become sponsors: Australia,\r\nGreece, Italy, Jamaica, Madagascar, Micronesia, the\r\nRussian Federation and Tonga.\r\nThe draft resolution is the result of constructive\r\nand creative discussions. I would like to thank\r\nMr. Vladimir Golitsyn, Director of the Division for\r\nOcean Affairs and the Law of the Sea, and his staff for\r\ntheir highly professional assistance, which, as usual,\r\ncontributed decisively to the success of our work. I\r\nalso take this opportunity to express our appreciation to\r\nMs. Holly Koehler of the delegation of the United\r\nStates for coordinating the draft resolution on fisheries.\r\nThe draft resolution and today’s debate are\r\nexpressions of the commitment of the United Nations\r\nto this multidisciplinary and complex item on the\r\nagenda of the General Assembly, under which the\r\ninternational community has been making efforts in the\r\nareas of cooperation and the integration of activities\r\nand regulatory measures required by the landmark\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The\r\npre-eminent role of the Convention is clearly\r\nrecognized by the draft resolution, which refers to it as\r\n2\r\nA/60/PV.54\r\nthe legal framework within which all activities in the\r\noceans and seas must be carried out.\r\nThe draft resolution emphasizes the role of the\r\nConvention in the maintenance and strengthening of\r\ninternational peace and security, as well as in the\r\nsustainable development of the uses of, and activities\r\nin, the oceans and seas. It also reflects the importance\r\nof capacity-building for developing States so that they\r\ncan implement the Convention, fulfil their obligations,\r\nbenefit from ocean resources and participate in all\r\nforums and processes dealing with issues related to\r\noceans and the law of the sea.\r\nAmong other important achievements reflected in\r\nthe draft resolution, I would like to underline, first, the\r\nlaunching of the start-up phase of the regular process\r\nfor global reporting and assessment of the state of the\r\nmarine environment, including socio-economic\r\naspects, as agreed in the Plan of Implementation of the\r\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development; secondly,\r\nthe review and renewal of the mandate of the United\r\nNations Open-ended Informal Consultative Process on\r\nOceans and the Law of the Sea, with recommendations\r\nthat its discussions at its next meeting be focused on\r\nthe topic “Ecosystem approaches and oceans”; thirdly,\r\nthe agreement reached on participation in the Ad Hoc\r\nOpen-ended Informal Working Group on marine\r\nbiodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction.\r\nI now wish to make a few remarks on behalf of\r\nthe delegation of Brazil.\r\nBrazil has a coastline 7,500 kilometres long. Its\r\ncontinental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles, which is\r\ncurrently under examination by the Commission on the\r\nLimits of the Continental Shelf, is estimated to be\r\n953,525 square kilometres. More than 90 per cent of\r\nBrazil’s trade occurs through the seas. Such\r\ncharacteristics have always underscored our\r\ncommitment to the United Nations Convention on the\r\nLaw of the Sea, which is increasingly known as the\r\nconstitution of the oceans, as well as to efforts to put\r\nits provisions into practice — provisions that are\r\nalready becoming part of customary law.\r\nIt has been 23 years since the adoption of the\r\nConvention and 11 years since its entry to force.\r\nFollowing the adoption of the 1994 Agreement relating\r\nto the Implementation of Part XI of the Convention and\r\nthe 1995 Agreement for the Implementation of the\r\nProvisions of the Convention relating to the\r\nConservation and Management of Straddling Fish\r\nStocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, we have\r\njustifiably high expectations as to active participation\r\nin the discussions of the Ad Hoc Open-ended Informal\r\nWorking Group on marine biodiversity beyond national\r\njurisdiction. That seems to us the most important step\r\nthat the international community has taken in this area\r\nin the last 10 years.\r\nIn our view, it is essential that the international\r\ncommunity engage in discussions on marine\r\nbiodiversity and marine scientific research, in\r\naccordance with the Convention, in order to better\r\nunderstand and manage ocean resources and activities.\r\nUnder the Convention, activities in the Area are to be\r\ncarried out for the benefit of mankind as a whole,\r\ntaking into particular consideration the interests and\r\nneeds of developing States. Biological resources in the\r\nArea cannot be depleted or appropriated, but must be\r\nused for the benefit of present generations and\r\npreserved for future generations.\r\nBrazil welcomes the commitment to launch the\r\nstart-up phase of the regular process recommended by\r\nthe Johannesburg Plan of Implementation. We expect\r\nthat its work will be fruitful and that States will bear in\r\nmind the need for integration and coordination efforts\r\naimed at the conservation of the oceans. We recognize\r\nthe importance of the Informal Consultative Process in\r\nfacilitating this General Assembly debate by making\r\npossible a better understanding of the broad, complex\r\nand multifaceted issues related to oceans.\r\nWe are, however, very concerned about the topic\r\nto be focused upon next year, given that the\r\ninternational community has been unable to agree in\r\nother multilateral forums on any definition of an\r\necosystem approach. The next one-week meeting of the\r\nInformal Consultative Process must be organized in a\r\nvery objective way so as to allow adequate time for the\r\ndiscussion of other important issues to be considered in\r\nthe Secretary-General’s annual comprehensive report\r\non oceans and the law of the sea.\r\nThe draft resolution on sustainable fisheries is\r\ninspired by our common goal of establishing\r\nappropriate conservation and management measures to\r\nmake fisheries a sustainable activity. But our challenge\r\nis to implement such measures and to encourage States\r\nto comply with them in order to stop the depletion of\r\nfish stocks and the destruction of marine biodiversity.\r\nBrazil attributes the problem of excess fishing\r\ncapacity not only to the illegal, unreported and\r\n3\r\nA/60/PV.54\r\nunregulated fisheries, but also to the oversized fishery\r\nfleets of some developed States. That should not\r\njeopardize the efforts of developing States to engage in\r\nsustainable fishery activities, including by renovating\r\ntheir fishery fleets.\r\nAs we highlight the achievements and the current\r\nchallenges related to ocean issues, let us take this\r\nopportunity to rededicate our countries and the\r\ninternational community as a whole to the task and\r\nvision that we set ourselves in 1982, the year that the\r\nConvention was concluded.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of the United States of America to\r\nintroduce draft resolution A/60/L.23.\r\nMr. Bolton (United States of America): My\r\ndelegation has the honour to co-sponsor draft\r\nresolution A/60/L.22, entitled “Oceans and the law of\r\nthe sea”. We also have the honour to introduce, on\r\nbehalf of our fellow sponsors, draft resolution\r\nA/60/L.23, on sustainable fisheries. I would like to\r\nannounce that the following delegations have agreed to\r\nbe additional sponsors of draft resolution A/60/L.23:\r\nAustralia, France, Greece, Madagascar, Micronesia, the\r\nRussian Federation and Tonga.\r\nThe United States is very pleased with these draft\r\nresolutions. We believe that they will contribute\r\nsignificantly to the efforts of the international\r\ncommunity to deal with pressing challenges in the field\r\nof oceans and fisheries.\r\nA key element of the fisheries negotiations again\r\nthis year is the protection of certain sensitive\r\nunderwater features and vulnerable marine ecosystems\r\nfrom the impacts of fishing activities. We view the\r\nenhanced language in the draft resolution as\r\nunderscoring the importance to the international\r\ncommunity of addressing this issue and safeguarding\r\nthe biodiversity of these fragile and rare marine\r\necosystems.\r\nIn particular, the draft resolution continues to call\r\nupon States and regional fisheries management\r\norganizations to urgently take action to regulate bottom\r\nfisheries and the impacts of destructive fishing\r\npractices through the adoption of appropriate\r\nconservation and management measures. The draft\r\nresolution also strengthens provisions calling for a\r\nreport on this issue for consideration by the General\r\nAssembly next year.\r\nThe United States is encouraged by recent\r\nprogress made by both States and regional fisheries\r\nmanagement organizations in addressing the impacts of\r\nfishing on vulnerable marine ecosystems. We will\r\ncontinue to work cooperatively with all States in\r\ninternational bodies engaged in regulating fisheries to\r\ngive effect to those provisions.\r\nThis year’s draft resolution on fisheries continues\r\nto lay the foundation for the review conference\r\nmandated by the 1995 United Nations Fish Stocks\r\nAgreement. The review conference represents the best\r\nopportunity we have to strengthen the implementation\r\nof that vital Agreement with the goal of securing\r\nsustainable fisheries throughout the world. It is\r\nimperative that we seize that opportunity. The United\r\nStates strongly supports increasing membership in the\r\nAgreement and hopes that all States that have not yet\r\ndone so will consider becoming parties to it in advance\r\nof the review conference next May.\r\nWe also support the calls in this year’s draft\r\nresolution on fisheries for renewed efforts to achieve\r\nsustainable aquaculture, to combat illegal, unreported\r\nand unregulated fishing and to address fishing\r\novercapacity and harmful subsidies.\r\nIn addition, the United States is pleased that the\r\nfisheries draft resolution more explicitly addresses the\r\ncritical issue of marine debris and derelict fishing gear,\r\nwhich adversely affect marine living resources and\r\ntheir habitats. We view as an important step forward\r\nthe calls for specific action to prevent the decline of\r\nsea turtles and seabird populations by reducing\r\nbycatch. We applaud the language of the draft\r\nresolution dealing with the conservation of sharks, and\r\nwe look forward to continuing to work with all\r\ninterested States in implementing the Food and\r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)\r\ninternational plans of action for sharks and seabirds, as\r\nwell as the recent FAO guidelines on sea turtles.\r\nTurning to the draft resolution on oceans and the\r\nlaw of the sea, we are pleased with the progress made\r\nthis year on an array of diverse issues. The February ad\r\nhoc informal open-ended meeting on marine\r\nbiodiversity beyond national jurisdictions will be an\r\nopportunity for the international community to discuss\r\nsome complex issues. We look forward to a productive\r\nexchange of information and ideas.\r\nWe are pleased with the decision, provided for in\r\nthis year’s draft resolution, to renew the mandate of the\r\n4\r\nA/60/PV.54\r\nUnited Nations Open-ended Informal Consultative\r\nProcess on Oceans and the Law of the Sea. The annual\r\nmeetings of the Consultative Process have proved to be\r\nhelpful in expanding the international community’s\r\nknowledge and awareness of emerging issues affecting\r\nthe world’s oceans. Our decision to focus on ecosystem\r\napproaches and oceans at next year’s meeting will, we\r\nbelieve, continue in that helpful mode. We thank our\r\nCanadian colleagues for suggesting that topic.\r\nThis year’s draft resolution recognizes that the\r\nwork of the Commission on the Limits of the\r\nContinental Shelf will become increasingly significant\r\nas more States initiate the process of establishing the\r\nboundaries of their continental shelves. We look\r\nforward to further clarity with respect to information\r\noffered for the Commission’s consideration.\r\nAmong all of the positive outcomes of this year’s\r\ndraft resolution, however, there is one regarding which\r\nwe feel compelled to note a concern for possible future\r\ntrends. In our view, this draft resolution is not the best\r\nor most appropriate vehicle for the complex issue of\r\nthe trans-shipment of radioactive materials. Although\r\nwe recognize the importance that many delegations,\r\nparticularly those from small island developing States,\r\nattach to this issue, it is such a technical and difficult\r\none that, to be given fair consideration, it must be\r\nraised in organizations better equipped to do so. Those\r\norganizations are the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency and the International Maritime Organization.\r\nWe would encourage all Member States particularly\r\ninterested in the issue to join those organizations.\r\nThe United States would like to thank all\r\ndelegations that worked with good will and\r\ncooperation to achieve the balanced and constructive\r\ntexts of both these draft resolutions. We particularly\r\nappreciate the assistance given to my colleague Holly\r\nKoehler, the member of the United States delegation\r\nwho this year coordinated the negotiations on the draft\r\nresolution on fisheries. We also appreciate very much\r\nthe efforts of Commander Marcos de Almeida of\r\nBrazil, who very skilfully coordinated the negotiations\r\nthis year on the draft resolution on oceans.\r\nMr. Bradshaw (United Kingdom): I have the\r\nhonour to speak on behalf of the European Union and\r\nthe European Community as a party to the Convention\r\non the Law of the Sea. The following countries have\r\naligned themselves with this statement: the acceding\r\ncountries Bulgaria and Romania, the candidate country\r\nCroatia, the countries of the Stabilization and\r\nAssociation Process and potential candidates Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina, the former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia and Serbia and Montenegro, as well as\r\nother aligning countries, Moldova and Ukraine.\r\nThe European Union attaches great importance to\r\nthe international community’s development of a\r\ncoherent, integrated and equitable approach to the\r\nsustainable management and conservation of oceans\r\nand their resources, both in areas under the\r\nresponsibility of coastal States and beyond the limits of\r\nnational jurisdiction. The European Union’s\r\ndetermination to play its part is demonstrated by its\r\nrecent publication of its Thematic Strategy on the\r\nProtection and Conservation of the Marine\r\nEnvironment — the Marine Strategy — together with\r\nthe proposal for its legislative underpinning.\r\nThat must be seen in the wider context of an all-\r\nembracing maritime policy for the European Union, on\r\nwhich the European Commission will publish a\r\nconsultation document in the first half of 2006. The\r\nEuropean Union looks forward to discussing that\r\ndocument with both the Members of the United\r\nNations and relevant organizations of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe European Union attaches the highest priority\r\nto improving oceans and fisheries governance,\r\nincluding in areas beyond national jurisdiction. We see\r\nthat as a key theme in the very substantive work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly towards a comprehensive set of\r\nrecommendations and commitments in this year’s\r\noceans and fisheries draft resolutions. They provide an\r\nexcellent account of the many issues that need urgent\r\nattention from the international community.\r\nAmong them, two governance issues straddle the\r\ntwo draft resolutions, to which the European Union\r\nattaches particular importance: combating illegal,\r\nunregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing, and\r\naddressing the conservation of vulnerable marine\r\necosystems. IUU fishing is a fundamental threat to\r\nsustainable fisheries and ocean ecosystems. It also\r\nrepresents a major loss of revenue to States, notably\r\ndeveloping countries. Significant progress in\r\naddressing the problem is being made in certain areas,\r\nparticularly in southern oceans. That demonstrates that\r\ncombating IUU fishing effectively is indeed possible if\r\nparties act decisively on their commitments. However,\r\nmuch remains to be done.\r\n5\r\nA/60/PV.54\r\nWe welcome the important work being developed\r\nby the Food and Agriculture Organization and the Task\r\nForce on High-Seas Fishing. We also look forward to\r\ncontinuing our efforts, in cooperation with our\r\ncounterparts, to reinforce control schemes within\r\nregional fisheries management organizations. In that\r\nregard, the European Union places particular emphasis\r\non the need of major markets for fish and fish products\r\nto take measures to eliminate the commerce on which\r\nIUU fishing fleets rely. It is also necessary to continue\r\nand enhance assistance to developing States to develop\r\ncontrol and management capacities that will allow\r\nthem to contribute to this global effort. There must also\r\nbe a firm commitment by all parties to reinforce\r\ncontrols at port and to effectively regulate trans-\r\nshipment at sea.\r\nMost importantly, we need to address the crucial\r\nissue of the genuine link between States and their\r\nflagged vessels — an issue that is much broader than\r\nIUU fishing alone. The key in that regard is that flag\r\nStates must exercise effective control over ships flying\r\ntheir flags, taking all necessary measures to establish\r\neffective maritime administrations to ensure\r\ncompliance. In that connection, the European Union\r\nlooks forward to the introduction later this year, at the\r\nInternational Maritime Organization, of the Member\r\nState Audit Scheme.\r\nWith regard to the protection of vulnerable\r\nmarine ecosystems, the European Union would like to\r\ndraw the Assembly’s attention to two key processes set\r\nout in these draft resolutions. The first concerns\r\naddressing the impacts of fishing. We believe that\r\nevery effort must be made to ensure a successful\r\noutcome of the two-year process foreseen in paragraph\r\n71 of resolution 59/25, as confirmed this year. States\r\nmust be ready to take full account of the outcome of\r\nthat exercise, with a view to a frank discussion at the\r\nsixty-first session of the General Assembly.\r\nThe second key process is next February’s\r\nmeeting of the United Nations Ad Hoc Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on marine biodiversity in areas beyond\r\nnational jurisdiction. We see the meeting as an\r\nopportunity to engage with all key stakeholders about\r\nthe way forward. We recognize that, as well as tackling\r\nimmediate sectoral threats, the international\r\ncommunity may need to take additional integrated\r\nmeasures, including establishing marine protected\r\nareas. In that context, the European Union has already\r\nexpressed its support in principle for the elaboration of\r\nan implementation agreement consistent with the\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. We\r\nalso recognize the need to address the issue of genetic\r\nresources.\r\nTo ensure progress, the review of the state of play\r\nthat will be undertaken by the meeting in February\r\nmust be rigorous. Again, States must be ready to take\r\nfull account of the outcome of the meeting, with a view\r\nto frank discussion at the sixty-first session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. It is imperative that the General\r\nAssembly be able at that time to effectively address the\r\nprotection of biodiversity in areas beyond national\r\njurisdiction, as well as any shortcomings in the\r\ninternational fisheries management regime that might\r\nbe identified in that context. The European Union\r\nhereby declares its commitment to contribute actively\r\nto the attainment of those objectives.\r\nThe European Union (EU) would like to stress\r\nthe importance of the principle of freedom of\r\nnavigation, including the rights of innocent passage\r\nand transit passage through straits used for\r\ninternational navigation. In addition, port States should\r\nexercise their right with regard to access to their ports\r\nin a manner that is non-discriminatory and consistent\r\nwith the United Nations Convention on the Law of the\r\nSea and international law.\r\nOn the issue of security and safety at sea, the\r\nEuropean Union would like to highlight the adoption,\r\non 14 October 2005, of the two protocols amending the\r\nConvention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts\r\nagainst the Safety of Maritime Navigation and the\r\nProtocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against\r\nthe Safety of Fixed Platforms Located on the\r\nContinental Shelf. The European Union considers that\r\nthe 2005 protocols add important provisions to the\r\nexisting instruments, enhancing efforts against\r\nterrorism, and recommends their early ratification. The\r\nEU also urges States to take appropriate measures to\r\nensure their effective implementation.\r\nThe European Union fully supports the renewal\r\nof the mandate of the United Nation’s Informal\r\nConsultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the Sea\r\n(ICP). The Consultative Process has contributed\r\npositively, inter alia, and by facilitating the annual\r\nreview of the Secretary-General’s report on oceans and\r\nthe law of the sea. At the same time, we recognize that\r\nsome improvement in the workings and contents of the\r\nConsultative Process need to be made. We look\r\n6\r\nA/60/PV.54\r\nforward to the early appointment of the two\r\nco-chairpersons for the next meeting of the\r\nConsultative Process, so that they can begin effective\r\npreparations in conjunction with States and relevant\r\nbodies.\r\nIn that connection, we would note, however, that\r\nthe European Union attaches great importance to\r\nresolving the discrepancy that currently exists between\r\nthe observer status of the European Community and its\r\ncompetencies — whether exclusive or mixed — with\r\nrespect to many issues that have been discussed in\r\nprevious ICP meetings. The European Community is a\r\ncontracting party to the United Nations Convention on\r\nthe Law of the Sea and the United Nations 1995 Fish\r\nStocks Agreement in its own right, and has thus\r\naccepted legal obligations with respect to oceans and\r\nlaw of the sea that are particularly relevant to the\r\nConsultative Process. Although no solution could be\r\nfound this year, we welcome the commitment of\r\ndelegations to continue negotiations bilaterally with a\r\nview to resolving the problem in the near future.\r\nThe European Union welcomes the decision to\r\nlaunch the first regular phase of the Global Marine\r\nAssessment (GMA). We see the Assessment as an\r\nimportant vehicle for improved cooperation between\r\nthe agencies of the United Nations and other bodies, as\r\nwell as a firm basis for improved oceans policy-\r\nmaking.\r\nIn conclusion, we would like to express our\r\nappreciation for the annual report on oceans and the\r\nlaw of the sea provided by the Secretariat. It is an\r\ninvaluable compilation of recent developments. Let me\r\nreiterate on behalf of the European Union that we\r\nconsider the General Assembly to be the appropriate\r\nplace to discuss the report.\r\nMr. Neil (Jamaica): I have the honour today to\r\nspeak on behalf of the member States of the Caribbean\r\nCommunity (CARICOM). We thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report (A/60/63), which, as usual,\r\nprovides a comprehensive overview of recent and\r\nongoing activities relating to oceans and the law of the\r\nsea.\r\nWe also take the opportunity to commend the\r\nDivision for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea, as\r\nwell as its partners, such as the United Nations\r\nInstitute for Training and Research (UNITAR), for\r\ncontinuing to provide guidance and support to Member\r\nStates in implementing the provisions of the United\r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea. We look\r\nforward with interest to the Division’s plans to take a\r\nmore proactive approach in assisting States to face the\r\nchallenges of implementing the Convention and of\r\nderiving its benefits.\r\nCARICOM member States welcome the\r\nopportunity to reaffirm the integrity of the Convention\r\nas the overall legal framework governing ocean\r\nactivities. We are encouraged by the progress made\r\ntowards universal adherence to the Convention, and we\r\nare pleased to see that, since our last debate, the\r\nnumber of ratifications has increased, raising the\r\nnumber of States parties to 148. We are pleased that, at\r\nthe meeting of the States parties in June of this year,\r\nthe Secretary-General for the first time presented a\r\nreport in accordance with article 319 of the\r\nConvention.\r\nOver the past year the three institutions created\r\nby the Convention covered new ground in carrying out\r\ntheir mandates. The International Seabed Authority\r\ncontinued to make progress in developing the\r\nframework for cooperation in the area of seabed\r\nresources. It is moving closer to realizing the goal of\r\nelaborating regulations for the prospecting and\r\nexploration of polymetallic sulphides and cobalt-rich\r\ncrusts in the international seabed area and for the\r\nconservation of biodiversity in the seabed. As that\r\nprocess evolves, it is important that States parties\r\nremain actively engaged by ensuring their full\r\nparticipation through attendance at sessions of the\r\nAuthority.\r\nWe also commend the Authority for its\r\ncontinuing role in providing training through annual\r\nworkshops on the scientific and technical aspects of\r\nseabed mining and also on the critical area of\r\nprotection and preservation of the marine environment.\r\nWe have also seen progress and increased activity\r\nin the work of the Commission on the Limits of the\r\nContinental Shelf, which is now considering several\r\nnew submissions, with a number of additional ones\r\nforthcoming in the near future. We also wish to make\r\nspecial mention of the trust funds for assisting with\r\nsubmissions and for participation and support. We call\r\nfor additional resources to be made available to\r\nfacilitate the fullest participation in the work of the\r\nCommission.\r\nThe International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea\r\nhas established a reputation for addressing, in a timely\r\n7\r\nA/60/PV.54\r\nand efficient manner, the submissions received from\r\nStates for the settlement of disputes relating to various\r\nprovisions of the Convention. The range of cases for\r\nwhich judgement is sought is also an indication of\r\ngrowing confidence in the Tribunal. We welcome the\r\nsigning of the Headquarters Agreement between the\r\nTribunal and the Government of Germany, providing\r\nstable arrangements for the functioning of the Tribunal.\r\nSpecial emphasis has been given in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report to the importance of marine scientific\r\nresearch, which was brought into painful and sharp\r\nrelief by the Indian Ocean tsunami of December last\r\nyear. The States of the Caribbean Community have also\r\nrecognized the link between that often overlooked\r\naspect of the Convention and the use of marine\r\nresources for sustainable development, the\r\nimprovement of navigational safety and its\r\ncontribution to the prevention of disasters, especially\r\nin the development of early warning systems.\r\nThe report also highlights many recent\r\ndevelopments relating to the safety of navigation, the\r\nwelfare of seafarers and the protection of the marine\r\nenvironment, as well as capacity-building activities.\r\nThose are matters of prime importance to CARICOM\r\nStates from the standpoint of economic and social\r\ndevelopment and security interests.\r\nThe Caribbean Community places special\r\nimportance on the Mauritius Strategy for\r\nImplementation, adopted at the International Meeting\r\nto Review the Implementation of the Programme of\r\nAction for the Sustainable Development of Small\r\nIsland Developing States, held in January this year.\r\nUnder the Mauritius Strategy, CARICOM States\r\ncommit themselves to carrying out further\r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action in areas\r\nsuch as integrated ocean and coastal management,\r\nmaritime delimitation, the management of coral reefs\r\nand associated ecosystems, the development and\r\nimplementation of waste-management strategies and\r\nthe strengthening of sustainable and responsible\r\nfisheries management mechanisms. We reiterate the\r\ncall in the Mauritius Strategy for the international\r\ncommunity to provide the necessary support to enable\r\nsmall island developing countries to undertake their\r\nimplementation activities effectively.\r\nWe are convinced of the need to strengthen\r\nmarine scientific research in coastal States and are\r\ntherefore pleased at the evident increase in interest in\r\nthis area. In October this year, a Chinese research\r\nvessel made a visit to the region and to the\r\nheadquarters of the International Seabed Authority as\r\npart of the vessel’s first-ever round-the-world research\r\nmission, which began in April 2005. States of the\r\nCaribbean Community continue to make a contribution\r\nto global marine scientific research. However, we are\r\ndeveloping countries and there is a need to ensure\r\nstable financial and technical support to our countries\r\nif such efforts are to be sustained.\r\nThe Caribbean Community has a special interest\r\nin the protection of the Caribbean Sea. Our\r\nGovernments have long expressed concern about the\r\ntransportation of hazardous materials through the\r\nCaribbean Sea, given the risk of serious damage to its\r\nfragile ecosystems and marine resources, which are\r\nvital to our existence. Of special concern is the\r\ntransportation of nuclear waste materials, which we\r\nhave consistently opposed. We continue to urge the\r\nparties concerned to refrain from the use of the\r\nCaribbean Sea as a transit route for such shipments.\r\nAt the broader level, we recognize the importance\r\nof continuing to work towards the further development\r\nand strengthening of international regulatory regimes\r\nfor the transportation of hazardous materials by sea. In\r\nthis respect, encouraging progress is being made in the\r\nimplementation of the Action Plan for the Safety of\r\nTransport of Radioactive Material, which was\r\napproved by the Board of Governors of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency in March 2004.\r\nWe urge the States concerned to continue their efforts\r\nin the implementation of all areas of the Action Plan.\r\nThe past year also saw a number of activities in\r\nthe development and implementation of measures to\r\nstrengthen maritime transport safety and security.\r\nStates of the Caribbean Community commend the\r\nInternational Maritime Organization for its efforts,\r\nparticularly those aimed at improving flag State\r\ncontrol. We urge the organization and its member\r\nStates to continue to elaborate regulations to improve\r\nsafety standards for ships and to establish an effective\r\ncompensation regime in the event of accidents.\r\nWe join with other States in expressing concern\r\nabout the continued incidence of piracy, armed robbery\r\nand smuggling at sea and at the increasing level of\r\nviolence associated with those activities. We urge all\r\nStates to take seriously those threats to maritime safety\r\nand to continue to collaborate with all relevant\r\n8\r\nA/60/PV.54\r\nstakeholders, including the shipping industry, coastal\r\ncommunities and the international community, to\r\nproperly address those concerns.\r\nWe also wish to emphasize the importance of\r\nensuring cooperation in interdiction and other security\r\nmeasures to restrict illegal activities in the Caribbean\r\nSea. That should not be confined to concerns about\r\ndrug trafficking and weapons of mass destruction, but\r\nshould also extend to the illicit traffic in small arms\r\nand light weapons, which constitute a serious danger to\r\nstability in the region. We would also urge that creative\r\nmethods be found to assist CARICOM States in their\r\ninterdiction efforts, particularly in the acquisition of\r\nequipment and vessels, in the light of the extreme\r\ndifficulties of accessing concessional financing for\r\nsuch purposes.\r\nThe CARICOM States wish to express\r\nappreciation for the ongoing work of the Regional Seas\r\nProgramme of the United Nations Environmental\r\nProgramme, through the Caribbean Environment\r\nProgramme, which continues to assist in coordinating\r\nthe region’s implementation of the Cartagena\r\nConvention for the Protection and Development of the\r\nMarine Environment of the Wider Caribbean Region.\r\nWe have taken steps to implement action plans and\r\nadvance work in focus areas such as coral reef\r\nmanagement, sustainable tourism and environmental\r\neducation.\r\nThere is growing awareness in the region of the\r\nimpact of land-based sources of marine pollution,\r\nwhich is estimated to be responsible for about 80 per\r\ncent of all pollution entering the oceans. The concept\r\nof marine protected areas is also gaining greater\r\nunderstanding and support, with several territories in\r\nthe region having been designated such areas. The\r\nSecretary-General’s report highlights the growing\r\nproblem of marine debris and its link with land-based\r\nsources of pollution, as well as the issue of noise\r\npollution. We will, of course, do everything in our\r\npower, subject to our resource constraints, to\r\ninvestigate and address those two issues, and we\r\nsupport the call on States in the draft resolution before\r\nus to integrate the issue of marine debris with waste\r\nmanagement.\r\nThere is a need for stronger financial and\r\ntechnical support, as well as investment, on terms\r\nfavourable to CARICOM States, so as to enable them\r\nto establish and improve port reception facilities in\r\ntheir territories.\r\nThe CARICOM Regional Fisheries Mechanism,\r\nwhich was recently formed, has already begun to make\r\na positive contribution to the collaborative effort to\r\nimprove capacity in fisheries management in the\r\nregion. In this regard, we should mention that there is\r\nstill a great deal of concern about the persistence of\r\nillegal and unregulated fishing in Caribbean waters,\r\nwhich is challenging the economic and social viability\r\nof our fisheries and undermining the effectiveness of\r\nconservation management. In some areas those\r\nactivities are damaging the ecological systems of the\r\nCaribbean Sea.\r\nWhile CARICOM States have demonstrated their\r\ncommitment to the United Nations Convention on the\r\nLaw of the Sea by ratifying it, their ability to\r\neffectively implement the provisions is constrained by\r\ninadequate resources. In this context, we are requesting\r\nthat the International Hydrographic Organization\r\nintensify its efforts to build capacity in developing\r\ncountries for the production of electronic nautical\r\ncharts to provide data and information that can be used\r\nin fisheries activities and for other uses, such as the\r\ndelimitation of maritime boundaries.\r\nWith so many delimitation negotiations of great\r\ncomplexity to be undertaken and completed in the\r\nregion, broader regional cooperation is needed. In that\r\nconnection, we welcome the Conference on Maritime\r\nDelimitation in the Caribbean, an initiative of the\r\nGovernment of Mexico. It is our hope that the States of\r\nour region will take advantage of that mechanism\r\ncreated to assist the region’s coastal States in preparing\r\nfor maritime delimitation negotiations in accordance\r\nwith the provisions of the Convention.\r\nFinally, CARICOM States express their\r\nappreciation to the various partners that have\r\ncontributed technical and financial assistance to the\r\nStates of the Community over the years. We emphasize\r\nthe need for continued support for capacity-building in\r\norder to effectively implement the Convention and all\r\nassociated programmes in the area of oceans and the\r\nlaw of the sea.\r\nMs. Takaku (Papua New Guinea): As Papua\r\nNew Guinea is the current Chair of the Pacific Islands\r\nForum, I have the honour to speak on behalf of\r\nAustralia, Fiji, Kiribati, the Republic of the Marshall\r\nIslands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru,\r\n9\r\nA/60/PV.54\r\nNew Zealand, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga,\r\nTuvalu, Vanuatu and my own country, Papua New\r\nGuinea.\r\nIssues concerning oceans, fisheries and the law of\r\nthe sea are of great importance to Pacific Island Forum\r\ncountries. Our history, societies, cultures and\r\neconomies are heavily dependent on, and integrally\r\nlinked to, the sea. Although we differ in certain\r\nrespects, the members of the Pacific Island Forum\r\nshare a strong and unifying collective interest in the\r\nocean spaces that connect us. We have a common role\r\nas joint custodians of the sea and a common objective\r\nof realizing, over the long-term, the enormous value of\r\nits resources.\r\nWe are firmly committed to the proper\r\nconservation and management of the oceans. We are\r\npleased to support the draft resolutions under\r\nconsideration today.\r\nMembers of the Pacific Islands Forum launched\r\nthe Pacific Islands Regional Ocean Framework for\r\nIntegrated Strategic Action at the Mauritius\r\nInternational Meeting in January this year. We are\r\npleased with that initiative and look forward to\r\nproviding regular updates on implementation\r\nundertaken at the national level to achieve better,\r\nintegrated oceans management in the Pacific Islands\r\nregion.\r\nIn the context of integrated oceans management,\r\nPacific Island Forum members welcome the renewal of\r\nthe mandate of the United Nations Open-ended\r\nInformal Consultative Process on Oceans and the Law\r\nof the Sea. The focus of the Informal Consultative\r\nProcess on cross-cutting and practical oceans issues\r\nmakes an invaluable contribution to the annual oceans\r\ndebate.\r\nWe consider that the current broad participation\r\nin the Informal Consultative Process, including by non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and inter-governmental\r\norganizations, is important and ensures a rich and\r\ninformed discussion. Civil society participation in\r\nUnited Nations discussions on oceans and fisheries\r\nissues has brought new perspectives and challenges to\r\nthe positions of States. We look forward to the\r\nproductive and balanced continuation of that dialogue.\r\nWe also look forward to ongoing improvements in the\r\nfunctioning of the Informal Consultative Process.\r\nThe annual debate and resolutions on oceans and\r\nlaw of the sea are important and must continue. We see\r\nthem as part of the ongoing strengthening of oceans\r\ngovernance. We believe that the unique Pacific\r\nperspective must be incorporated into and reflected in\r\nthat process. However, participation in the whole menu\r\nof United Nations negotiations and consultations\r\npresents a continuing challenge for smaller States. We\r\nare pleased that, in this year’s draft resolution on\r\noceans and the law of the sea, the General Assembly\r\nhas addressed the problem of scheduling clashes in\r\nconcrete terms. We also support limiting the time\r\nframe for consultations next year to four weeks. Pacific\r\nIslands Forum members encourage United Nations\r\nMember States to do their utmost to ensure that the\r\ntime allocation is used efficiently and effectively.\r\nWe also note that the oceans and fisheries draft\r\nresolutions continue to grow in length. While it is good\r\nthat lively discussion on those issues grows, the same\r\ndoes not apply to resolutions. Much impact is lost with\r\nadded length. We encourage Members States to\r\nconsider innovative ways to ensure that the draft\r\nresolutions remain concise and salient expressions of\r\ncurrent oceans concerns.\r\nWe, the 14 members of the Pacific Islands Forum,\r\nsupport the establishment of the Ad Hoc Open-ended\r\nInformal Working Group on marine biodiversity\r\nbeyond national jurisdiction, which will meet in\r\nFebruary 2006. The whole range of issues falling\r\nwithin the mandate of the Working Group are of great\r\nimportance to us. We hope that the meeting will help\r\nus to identify ways the international community can\r\nwork together to improve the conservation and\r\nmanagement of the ocean’s biodiversity.\r\nAs we have said in the past, Pacific Islands\r\nForum members come from a region that has a high\r\nconcentration of vulnerable marine ecosystems,\r\nincluding coral reefs and underwater seamounts. We\r\nare well aware of the need to take urgent action to\r\nprevent, and manage the effects of, destructive fishing\r\npractices, including bottom trawling, which have an\r\nadverse impact on vulnerable marine ecosystems, and\r\nwe firmly support such action. We are seriously\r\nconcerned about the destruction caused by those\r\nactivities. In the communiqué issued by the Pacific\r\nIslands Forum in October this year, Forum leaders\r\nnoted the call for a moratorium on deep-sea bottom\r\ntrawling and for the creation of a legal framework to\r\nmanage that method of fishing in order to protect\r\n10\r\nA/60/PV.54\r\nbiodiversity in the high seas. Forum leaders are\r\nseriously concerned about the problem and have agreed\r\nto develop an appropriate legal framework for\r\nconsideration in 2006 and are giving thought to an\r\nappropriate legal framework within our region to\r\naddress that concern.\r\nClosely related to issues of governance of the\r\nhigh seas, Pacific Islands Forum members continue to\r\nview illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing\r\nwith concern. We regard it as one of the greatest threats\r\nto the future sustainability of our regional marine\r\nresources and environment. While significant effort is\r\nbeing expended in various forms to address the\r\nproblems caused by IUU fishing, we believe that we\r\nmust do more. Further study of the overall governance\r\nof the high seas is necessary if we are to move the\r\nissue forward. We continue to urge our partners to\r\ncooperate with us to achieve that end.\r\nWe welcome the review of the United Nations\r\nFish Stocks Agreement. In particular, we encourage\r\ngreater participation in, and the effective\r\nimplementation of, the Agreement.\r\nWe note the important work of the Commission\r\non the Limits of the Continental Shelf. This past year,\r\nthe Division of Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea\r\nhas undertaken valuable capacity-building efforts in\r\nthe Pacific region connected with the Commission’s\r\nwork. We would like to take this opportunity to point\r\nout the continued challenges faced by small island\r\ndeveloping States in the preparation of their\r\nsubmissions to the Commission.\r\nPacific Island Forum members welcome the focus\r\ngiven this year to the particular needs of small island\r\ndeveloping States with regard to the use and\r\ndevelopment of fisheries within their jurisdiction.\r\nPacific Island Forum countries have shown\r\nleadership in the conservation and management of the\r\nworld’s rich ocean resources. We continue to look\r\nforward to working with others towards that common\r\nobjective.\r\nFinally, we thank the coordinators for the\r\neffective manner in which they conducted the\r\nnegotiations, as well as all of the staff of the Division\r\nof Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea for their\r\ngreatly valued support.\r\nMr. Navoti (Fiji): Fiji associates itself with the\r\nstatement made by the representative of Papua New\r\nGuinea on behalf of the Pacific Islands Forum.\r\nThe future of our planet and our security depend\r\nupon an intimate understanding of ocean processes and\r\ntheir interaction. That has always been our belief in the\r\nPacific, and it has ensured our continued existence in\r\nour aquatic continent since time immemorial.\r\nWe thank the Secretary-General for his reports\r\nissued regarding this agenda item and commend the\r\nstaff of the Division of Ocean Affairs and the Law of\r\nthe Sea (DOALOS) for their continued assistance in\r\nmatters relating to oceans and the law of the sea. Fiji\r\nalso acknowledges the contribution of other United\r\nNations agencies and bodies, non-governmental\r\norganizations and interest groups, which have\r\ncontinued to contribute to ensure that our relationship\r\nwith the sea and its resources remains one that offers\r\nperpetual mutual benefits to all humanity.\r\nMr. Sardenberg (Brazil), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nFiji, like others, recognizes the inter-\r\ndependability of fisheries and food security and their\r\nimportance for the attainment of national economic and\r\nsocial goals and the well-being and livelihoods of\r\nfishing individuals and families. The rural fishery\r\ncentres, established in recognition of that fact, are part\r\nof an ongoing development programme that aims to\r\nfacilitate better market access for our local fishermen.\r\nThe sale of ice and ongoing subsidy programmes to\r\nassist rural-based fishermen with one- to two-thirds\r\nfunding assistance for boats and engines are two\r\nfurther initiatives to that end.\r\nIn order to conform with the universally accepted\r\nprinciple of sustainable fisheries management, the Fiji\r\nministry responsible for fisheries has set itself four key\r\ntargeted outcomes: the sustainable use of all fisheries\r\nproducts; the creation of livelihoods through small and\r\nmicro-enterprise development; support for community\r\nlivelihoods through competitive exports and efficient\r\nfood security; and the promotion of equitable\r\nparticipation by all in priority areas of socio-economic\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe Government of Fiji continues to consider as\r\nwell spent the allocation of money or other resources to\r\nfisheries, particularly given that an investment of\r\n11\r\nA/60/PV.54\r\n$5.9 million in 2004 realized a return to the local\r\neconomy of $347 million in the same year.\r\nThe acknowledgement by the Secretary-General\r\nin his report contained in document A/60/63 that the\r\nconcept of the precautionary approach has received\r\nwide recognition and that the increased adoption of\r\nmarine protected areas is an important tool for fishery\r\nconservation and management, indeed represents a\r\nwelcome and encouraging development. We have been\r\nworking with other organizations in the establishment\r\nof marine protected areas in Fiji. Earlier this month,\r\nthe World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) awarded Fiji\r\nthe WWF Leadership Award, to commend our\r\ncommitment to conservation and sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nFiji also understands the importance of the\r\ninteraction between fishing activities and ecosystems,\r\nparticularly as concerns its long-term impact, including\r\nthe adverse effects of removing numerous species from\r\nthe marine environment. To that end and despite the\r\nfact that the export of tuna constitutes about 94 per\r\ncent of all export earnings of fish, Fiji has reduced the\r\nnumber of tuna fishing licenses issued annually from\r\n103 in 2002 to 72 in 2005. Furthermore, we are now\r\nlooking at the feasibility of declaring all of Fiji’s\r\narchipelagic and territorial waters a reserve, of\r\nrestricting the use of longliners and purse-seiners and\r\nof enhancing game fishing in the context of\r\nrecreational fisheries as a viable option.\r\nCoral reef ecosystems are invaluable human\r\ntreasures. They support the most diverse marine\r\ncommunities and beautiful seascapes on the planet and\r\nprovide wave-resistant structures and resources for\r\nlocal communities, fisheries and tourism. That is true\r\nfor Fiji. It is disheartening to note that coral reefs are\r\nnow under serious threat of collapse owing to over-\r\nfishing and the development of coastal zones, which\r\nincludes dredging, landfills and terrestrial run-off, as\r\nwell as climate change. Such activities act\r\nsynergistically to stress coral reefs, leading to severe\r\nbleaching and extensive coral mortality.\r\nFiji notes the need for the mainstreaming of\r\nsustainable coral-reef management into national\r\ndevelopment strategies. We support the International\r\nCoral Reef Initiative and acknowledge the work carried\r\nout under the Jakarta Mandate on Marine and Coastal\r\nBiological Diversity. Local coral conservation\r\ninitiatives carried out in Fiji and in other parts of the\r\nworld by concerned and independent international\r\norganizations, such as the United Kingdom-sponsored\r\nCoral Cay Conservation Trust, to name but one, are\r\nalso worthy of our recognition. We make these remarks\r\nknowing full well that coral reefs add economic value\r\nto our tourism industry.\r\nRegulations relating to reserves, conservation,\r\nsustainable development, the reduction of fishing\r\nlicences and so forth cannot be enforced without the\r\ncooperation and commitment of our near, as well as our\r\ndistant, neighbours. This also requires a change in the\r\nattitude of unscrupulous businessmen, who think\r\nnothing of the damage sustained by the sea and focus\r\nsolely on profit.\r\nInternational cooperation is essential for the\r\nsuccessful implementation of the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).\r\nContinued global, regional and subregional\r\npartnerships will improve our understanding of ocean\r\nprocesses and ensure that its resources are preserved\r\nfor the enjoyment of our children. Fiji acknowledges\r\nthe cooperative efforts of regional fisheries\r\nmanagement organizations towards this partnership and\r\nencourages the sharing of scientific information\r\nbetween them for our general betterment. We would\r\nlike to take this opportunity to acknowledge the\r\nvaluable contribution of the Pacific Islands Forum\r\nfisheries agencies and other oceans and fisheries\r\norganizations in the Pacific for the advice they provide\r\nto Governments in our region on oceans and fisheries-\r\nrelated matters.\r\nWhile many small island developing States have\r\nintegrated the management of coastal and marine\r\nresources into broader ocean-management strategies\r\nsince the entry into force of UNCLOS, the\r\nimplementation of the Convention continues to be\r\nimpeded by financial constraints and lack of capacity.\r\nFiji has acknowledged, and will continue to\r\nacknowledge, all capacity-building initiatives and\r\nassistance rendered by Member States, United Nations\r\nbodies and agencies, international organizations, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and others that focus on\r\nthe sustainability and development of our national\r\ncompetencies.\r\nFiji is mindful of all its obligations under the\r\nConvention, in particular those relating to the limits of\r\nthe continental shelf. The first regional workshop on\r\nthe continental shelf — held in Fiji earlier this year and\r\n12\r\nA/60/PV.54\r\norganized by the Division for Ocean Affairs and the\r\nLaw of the Sea, the South Pacific Applied Geoscience\r\nCommission and the Commonwealth Secretariat —\r\nhelped enhance the knowledge and skills of our people\r\nand develop an in-depth understanding of the full\r\nprocedure for preparing the submission of the required\r\ntechnical and scientific data. In addition, various fields\r\nof expertise have to be combined to prepare\r\nsubmissions that are in conformity with the technical\r\nand scientific requirements of article 76 of the\r\nConvention and in accordance with the guidelines\r\nprepared by the Commission on the Limits of the\r\nContinental Shelf. For that, we are indeed grateful.\r\nWe reiterate our concern at the insufficiency of\r\nscientific information on the destructive environmental\r\nimpact of deep sea fishing practices, in particular\r\nbottom trawling. Pacific Island leaders have noted a\r\nproposal by the Republic of Palau for a moratorium on\r\ndeep sea bottom trawling and for the creation of a legal\r\nframework to manage that method of fishing in order\r\nto protect biological diversity on the high seas, and\r\nthey agreed to develop an appropriate legal framework\r\nfor consideration by the Pacific Islands Forum in 2006.\r\nThe Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency and the\r\nSecretariat of the Pacific Community were tasked with\r\nimplementation of that decision. We are keeping a keen\r\neye on further developments on that matter.\r\nFiji welcomes and supports the decision to\r\ncontinue the United Nations Open-ended Informal\r\nConsultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the Sea\r\nfor the next three years. We have always found that\r\nforum useful and are looking forward to continuing our\r\nparticipation in it. We also commend all delegates who\r\nhave worked in cooperation to finalize this session’s\r\ndraft resolutions on oceans and the law of the sea and\r\non sustainable fisheries. We endorse the content of\r\nthose draft resolutions and recommend their adoption.\r\nThe sea has always provided us with food to\r\nsustain us, sea lanes to facilitate our trade, minerals to\r\nprovide power, medicines to cure our many ills and a\r\nnatural moat to curb our warlike nature. How long that\r\ncommon heritage of mankind can continue to be kind\r\nto us is a question to which we must all find a\r\ncollective solution. It has always been our contention\r\nthat the sea can survive without us, but we cannot live\r\nwithout the sea.\r\nMr. Rodríguez Zahar (Mexico) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): At the outset, we thank the coordinators of\r\nthe two draft resolutions, Mr. Marcos Almeida and\r\nMrs. Holly Koehler. We also thank the Division for\r\nOcean Affairs and the Law of the Sea for their various\r\nreports and for administering various capacity-building\r\nprogrammes for developing countries.\r\nProgress has certainly been made. But,\r\nregrettably, we continue to see signs of deterioration of\r\nthe marine environment and States’ failure to fulfil\r\ntheir obligations in adhering to and implementing the\r\ninternational legal regime of the law of the sea. In that\r\ncontext, we believe that cooperation and coordination\r\nat all levels, the establishment of interdisciplinary and\r\ncomprehensive focal points for carrying out ocean-\r\nrelated polices and recognition of the jurisdiction of\r\nthe competent legal organs for providing peaceful\r\nsolutions to disputes will ensure the effectiveness of\r\nthe legal, technical and political tools at our disposal,\r\nin particular the 1982 Convention on the Law of the\r\nSea.\r\nOne of the technical tools that requires priority\r\nattention is the ecosystem approach in oceans\r\nmanagement. For that reason, we welcome the fact that\r\nthe next meeting of the United Nations Open-ended\r\nInformal Consultative Process on Oceans and the Law\r\nof the Sea will focus on that theme. It is essential to\r\nreach international consensus on the nature and the\r\nscope of that tool and its application in various sectors,\r\nsuch as fisheries management.\r\nIn that regard, we note that although a single\r\ntheme was chosen for the next meeting of the\r\nConsultative Process, it is Mexico’s understanding that\r\nthemes should be selected according to their nature,\r\ncomplexity and scope. The decision to address a single\r\ntheme should be an exception.\r\nMexico underlines the valuable work of the\r\nCommission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf,\r\nand we express our concern at the logistic implications\r\nthat the Commission’s significantly increased workload\r\nwill have in the foreseeable future. States parties to the\r\nConvention should reflect on the options for addressing\r\nthe problems created by the additional workload.\r\nMexico considers it important that the draft\r\nregulations for prospecting and exploration for\r\npolymetallic sulphides and cobalt-rich ferromanganese\r\ncrusts now being negotiated in the International Seabed\r\nAuthority reflect the principles of contemporary\r\ninternational law, in particular international\r\nenvironmental law, with the aim of establishing an\r\n13\r\nA/60/PV.54\r\nobjective regime of liability for damage to the marine\r\nenvironment of the Area. We believe it important that\r\nthe Authority consider the possibility of changing the\r\ndates of its meetings in order to improve attendance in\r\nKingston. It is essential that the meetings continue to\r\nbe held at the Authority’s headquarters.\r\nMexico reaffirms the importance of promoting\r\ncapacity in the preparation of reliable nautical charts\r\nthat ensure navigational safety and the protection of the\r\nenvironment, in particular vulnerable marine\r\necosystems such as coral reefs. It is essential for\r\nfinancial institutions to provide resources for the\r\ntransition to electronic nautical charts.\r\nThe international community should give special\r\nattention to the protection of the human rights of\r\nseafarers, especially because of the frequent violations\r\nof their right to due process. Thus, the Convention’s\r\nprovisions on the prompt release of vessels and their\r\ncrews, penalties for the pollution of the marine\r\nenvironment by foreign vessels and the recognized\r\nrights of the accused must be respected.\r\nWith respect to the maritime transport of\r\nradioactive materials and the lack of adequate regimes\r\nto establish responsibility and compensation in the case\r\nof accidents, while we recognize progress made in the\r\nframework of the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\n(IAEA), we share the Caribbean Community’s opinion\r\nthat more effective steps should be taken to address the\r\nconcern of small island and other coastal States.\r\nWith respect to the conservation and sustainable\r\nuse of marine biological diversity beyond national\r\njurisdiction, we look forward to the outcome of the\r\nefforts of the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group,\r\nwhich meets next February. We believe that all issues\r\nwithin the Working Group’s mandate should be\r\nexamined in detail. In addition, we want to emphasize\r\nthat, in accordance with resolution 59/25, consideration\r\nof substantive questions associated with the impact of\r\ndeep-sea bottom trawling on vulnerable marine\r\necosystems shall not be resumed until next fall.\r\nMexico believes it essential that States not parties\r\nto the 1995 Fish Stocks Agreement participate on equal\r\nfooting in the Agreement’s review conference and its\r\npreparatory process. The conference’s rules of\r\nprocedure should fully respect article 36 of the\r\nAgreement by allowing only intergovernmental and\r\nnon-governmental organizations to participate as\r\nobservers. Hearing the concerns of non-parties is the\r\nonly way to achieve the Agreement’s universality.\r\nResponsible international commerce is, without\r\ndoubt, crucial to ensuring that fishing contributes to\r\nsustainable development. Essential to achieving that\r\ngoal are the proposed systems for certification and eco-\r\nlabelling, provided that they are in conformity with\r\ninternational law. Real, non-discriminatory access to\r\nmarkets is needed, while unnecessary and hidden trade\r\nbarriers and distortion must be eliminated, in\r\naccordance with the principles contained in the Code\r\nof Conduct for Responsible Fisheries.\r\nMexico wishes to stress that it interprets the\r\nreference to marine protected areas in paragraph 75 of\r\nthe draft resolution on sustainable fisheries as referring\r\nto areas that serve purposes of protection and\r\nconservation in fisheries management, in accordance\r\nwith paragraphs 100 to 103 of the report of the twenty-\r\nsixth session of the Committee on Fisheries (COFI) of\r\nthe United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization\r\n(FAO). That sense is covered in Mexican legislation.\r\nMexico attaches special importance to the topic\r\nof capacity-building and the transfer of marine\r\ntechnology. We therefore commend the fact that the\r\ndraft resolution on sustainable fisheries notes the\r\nimportance of capacity-building in helping developing\r\ncountries to participate in high seas fishing. Similarly,\r\nMexico believes that capacity-building and cooperation\r\nat the regional level are crucial. Keeping that in mind,\r\nMexico has continued to provide financial resources to\r\nthe assistance fund of the Caribbean Conference on\r\nMaritime Delimitation.\r\nIn that respect, we are pleased by the recent\r\nelection of Jamaica as President of the Conference.\r\nFurthermore, Mexico believes it is crucial that there be\r\nspecialized technical mechanisms which, through the\r\ncoordination of various competent agencies, can\r\naddress the problems of oceans. Therefore, we support\r\nthe establishment of United Nations Ocean and Coastal\r\nAreas Network, whose results should be circulated to\r\nall States and whose deliberations should take into\r\naccount the views of Member States, in particular in\r\nthe work of its task forces.\r\nWe are pleased that agreement has been reached\r\non the start-up phase for the submission of periodic\r\nreports and evaluation of the status of the world’s\r\noceans — including socio-economic aspects, where\r\nthere must be significant participation by developing\r\n14\r\nA/60/PV.54\r\ncountries in the group of experts to be formed by the\r\nagencies that will lead that phase. We welcome the fact\r\nthat the General Assembly has called upon the United\r\nNations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the\r\nIntergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of the\r\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization (UNESCO) to participate in that work.\r\nHowever, we wish to note that in subsequent stages of\r\nthe process, we should consider which agencies should\r\ndeal with the task.\r\nThe scale and great variety of subjects covered by\r\nboth draft resolutions are clear proof of the strategic\r\nimportance of ocean affairs in the world in recent\r\nyears. The continued productivity of oceans depends\r\non whether the international community uses them in a\r\nsustainable manner, and requires that we properly\r\nrecognize that the problems of oceans are closely\r\ninterrelated and must be considered as a whole.\r\nGiven that the international community is faced\r\nat present with new challenges concerning oceans,\r\ncurrently as well as in the past, the Convention on the\r\nLaw of the Sea continues to provide the legal\r\nframework and focus for all ocean activities.\r\nMr. Chaabani (Tunisia) (spoke in French): At\r\nthe outset I would like to take the opportunity to thank\r\nthe Secretary-General of the United Nations for his\r\ncomprehensive reports on fisheries and on the oceans\r\nand the law of the sea. I would also like to thank the\r\ncoordinator of the informal consultations on the draft\r\nresolutions that are before us, as well as the Division\r\nfor Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea for their\r\nongoing contributions and their commitment to the\r\nsuccess of our work.\r\nWe also wish to take this opportunity to note with\r\npleasure the role and the work of the institutions that\r\nhave been set up under the United Nations Convention\r\non the Law of the Sea: the International Seabed\r\nAuthority, the International Tribunal for the Law of the\r\nSea and the Commission on the Limits of the\r\nContinental Shelf.\r\nNext year will be an important one for the oceans\r\nand the law of the sea, in particular with the launching\r\nof a process to establish a global international legal\r\nframework governing biological resources in sea areas\r\nbeyond national jurisdictions.\r\nNext year, we will also see the holding of a\r\nreview conference on the 1995 Agreement on the\r\nmanagement and conservation of fish stocks, which\r\ncomplements the Montego Bay Convention.\r\nThe current debate and the draft resolutions\r\nbefore us assert the commitment of the General\r\nAssembly to the issues concerning the oceans and the\r\nlaw of the sea in a context marked by the fear of the\r\nserious implications for future generations of the\r\ndeterioration of marine ecosystems and the excessive\r\nexploitation of marine biological resources.\r\nAs is shown by the outcome of the World Summit\r\non Sustainable Development, there is a growing\r\nawareness of the importance of the oceans and the seas\r\nfor land-based ecosystems. They play a critical role in\r\nensuring global food security — in particular in\r\ndeveloping countries — by maintaining economic\r\nprosperity and contributing to the well-being of current\r\nand future generations.\r\nWe believe that the General Assembly should\r\nplay a role in protecting and ensuring the sustainable\r\nuse of fisheries resources, in particular by managing,\r\ncoordinating and controlling programmes put in place\r\nby the specialized bodies and institutions.\r\nIn that context, my country is following with\r\ninterest the efforts aimed at establishing a moratorium\r\non deep-sea bottom trawling. However, my country\r\nbelieves that fisheries beyond national jurisdictions in\r\npartially closed seas, such as the Mediterranean, should\r\nbe controlled within the framework of regional\r\nfisheries organizations on the basis of work and studies\r\ncarried out by those bodies.\r\nHere, we support the unanimous decision taken\r\nby the General Fisheries Commission for the\r\nMediterranean, which bans trawling in the high seas\r\nwhere the sea depth is greater than 1000 metres. The\r\nprotection and preservation of the marine area and its\r\nresources is a source of constant concern for Tunisia,\r\nwhich is a developing coastal country whose territorial\r\nwaters are adjacent to the high seas.\r\nIn that context, Tunisia has adopted, last June, a\r\nlaw that creates an exclusive economic zone on its\r\nshores, in line with the relevant provisions of the\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and\r\nfollowing similar declarations made by various\r\ncountries in the region. We will, as necessary, delimit\r\nthe outer limits of that zone through joint work with\r\nthe neighbouring States concerned.\r\n15\r\nA/60/PV.54\r\nIn creating a regime for exploiting the seabed\r\nbeyond national jurisdictions that provides for fair\r\nsharing of the resources, the Convention reflects the\r\ndesire for a fair and equitable international economic\r\norder to control the oceans. The concept of humanity’s\r\ncommon heritage, as expounded upon in the\r\nConvention, embodies the hopes of developing\r\ncountries for a world based on peace, justice, solidarity\r\nand progress for all.\r\nFor that reason, while we understand the reasons\r\ngiven for reconsidering some of the aspects of the\r\nregime as set out in the Convention, including adapting\r\nthe Convention to current economic and political\r\nrealities, Tunisia stresses the interest of developing\r\ncountries to preserve the spirit of the Convention.\r\nWe therefore look forward to the launching of the\r\nwork of the Ad Hoc Open-ended Informal Working\r\nGroup, whose mandate is to study questions relating to\r\nthe conservation and sustainable use of marine\r\nbiological diversity in those areas beyond national\r\njurisdiction.\r\nMr. Shin Kak-soo (Republic of Korea): My\r\ndelegation thanks the Secretary-General for his\r\ncomprehensive and informative report on oceans and\r\nthe law of the sea (A/60/63). We also commend\r\nMr. Vladimir Golitsyn, Director of the Division for\r\nOcean Affairs and the Law of the Sea, and his staff for\r\ntheir dedicated work and their invaluable assistance to\r\nMember States. Finally, we would like to thank\r\nMr. Marcos Lourenço de Almeida of Brazil and\r\nMs. Holly Koehler of the United States for their\r\nexcellent work in coordinating the two draft resolutions\r\nbefore us.\r\nCurrently, the number of parties to the United\r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)\r\nstands at 149, while the number of parties to the\r\nAgreement relating to the implementation of Part XI of\r\nthe Convention has increased to 122. Given the\r\ncentrality of the Convention as the global legal\r\nframework for the governance of the oceans and seas,\r\nit is important that all activities in the oceans and seas\r\nbe carried out within that framework and that the\r\nintegrity of the Convention be maintained. We join\r\nother States in urging those that have not yet done so to\r\naccede to the Convention and to the Agreement as soon\r\nas possible.\r\nAs the implementing mechanisms of the\r\nConvention, the International Seabed Authority, the\r\nInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea and the\r\nCommission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf\r\nhave all played important roles. The Republic of Korea\r\nhas been actively participating in their work and will\r\ncontinue to do so. Because the omnibus draft resolution\r\nencourages all States parties to the Convention to\r\nattend the sessions of the International Seabed\r\nAuthority, wider participation should be ensured.\r\nThe oceans and seas are invaluable to the welfare\r\nof humanity, providing living and non-living marine\r\nresources and vital means of transportation.\r\nUnfortunately, however, maritime security is a serious\r\nconcern for many seafaring States. In particular, piracy\r\nand armed robbery at sea require vigilance at the\r\nsubregional, regional and international levels. To\r\neradicate the scourge of piracy and armed robbery\r\nagainst ships currently plaguing the waters of South-\r\nEast Asia, 16 countries have adopted a Regional\r\nCooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and\r\nArmed Robbery against Ships in Asia. As one of those\r\n16 countries, the Republic of Korea is in the process of\r\ncompleting the domestic process of signing that\r\nAgreement and advancing its early entry into force.\r\nThe development of marine science and\r\ntechnology is crucial in providing the data and\r\nevidence to enable the international community to\r\noptimize its resources for carrying out necessary\r\nmeasures. In that regard, my delegation underlines the\r\nimportance of scientific and technical cooperation in\r\nocean affairs, including the exchange of information,\r\nas well as joint research activities.\r\nTo achieve the conservation, management and\r\nsustainable use of living marine resources, States must\r\ncooperate to prevent, deter or eliminate illegal,\r\nunreported and unregulated fishing activities. In\r\nenhancing such cooperation, the international\r\ncommunity should set priorities for the measures that\r\nmust be taken.\r\nThe Republic of Korea has put in place a\r\nframework to prevent the operation of substandard\r\nvessels and to exercise effective control over vessels\r\nflying its flag in order to prevent or deter them from\r\nengaging in illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.\r\nWe are faithfully adhering to the international plan of\r\naction of the United Nations Food and Agriculture\r\nOrganization (FAO) against illegal, unreported and\r\nunregulated fishing. We will continue to work together\r\nwith other States, international organizations, such as\r\n16\r\nA/60/PV.54\r\nthe FAO and all regional fisheries management\r\norganizations, to achieve responsible fishing. The\r\nRepublic of Korea is also continuing to implement\r\nmeasures to protect the marine environment by\r\npreventing or reducing pollution from vessels and land-\r\nbased sources.\r\nThe United Nations Open-ended Informal\r\nConsultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the Sea\r\nheld its sixth meeting this year. Among the topics\r\ndiscussed was the very pertinent issue of fisheries and\r\ntheir contribution to sustainable development. With its\r\nthird three-year cycle beginning next year, the Informal\r\nConsultative Process should maintain its relevance and\r\nusefulness, as well as its inclusiveness and open-ended\r\nnature.\r\nCoordination and cooperation among various\r\nUnited Nations agencies, programmes and funds and\r\nother bodies related to international conventions are\r\nessential for the effective management of marine\r\nissues. In that regard, we expect that the Oceans and\r\nCoastal Areas Network will continue to strengthen its\r\nwork.\r\nThe Indian Ocean tsunami demonstrated clearly\r\nthat there is a strong need to establish an early warning\r\nand rapid response system for such disasters. To that\r\nend, the international community should engage in\r\ncapacity-building cooperation to help developing\r\ncountries strengthen their ocean-related infrastructures.\r\nThe Republic of Korea is doing its part to enhance\r\ninternational cooperation by transferring marine\r\ntechnology to developing countries through the Korea\r\nInternational Cooperation Agency’s funding and\r\ninternship programmes.\r\nIn conclusion, the international community has\r\nlong been collaborating to find common ground for\r\nensuring safe transport and the sustainable use and\r\nmanagement of marine resources. The United Nations\r\nhas been a vital forum where States can engage in\r\nconstructive dialogue on these important issues. As a\r\nresponsible maritime State, the Republic of Korea will\r\ncontinue to participate actively in the ongoing process\r\nof ensuring sound governance of the oceans and seas.\r\nMs. Banks (New Zealand): New Zealand warmly\r\nassociates itself with the statement presented by the\r\nrepresentative of Papua New Guinea on behalf of the\r\nStates of the Pacific Islands Forum, of which New\r\nZealand is a member.\r\nNew Zealand is pleased to once again co-sponsor\r\nboth the omnibus oceans draft resolution and the\r\nsustainable fisheries draft resolution. We would like to\r\nadd a few additional comments to the debate on our\r\nown behalf.\r\nWe all know that 2006 will be a busy year for\r\nwork on oceans and the law of the sea. States will\r\ntackle important cross-cutting oceans issues, such as\r\nmarine biodiversity in areas beyond national\r\njurisdiction, the review of the effectiveness of the 1995\r\nUnited Nations Fish Stocks Agreement and the\r\nimplementation of actions called for in last year’s\r\nAssembly resolution 59/25 with respect to vulnerable\r\nmarine ecosystems.\r\nIn February next year, an ad hoc open-ended\r\nworking group will meet to discuss complex issues\r\nrelating to the conservation and sustainable use of\r\nmarine biological diversity beyond areas of national\r\njurisdiction. It is clear to us that more must be done to\r\nprotect marine biodiversity in those areas. New\r\nZealand looks forward to the chance to discuss, under\r\nGeneral Assembly auspices, the full range of issues\r\narising within the mandate of the working group and to\r\nbegin consideration of the mechanisms necessary to\r\nensure proper protection, for the long term, of\r\nbiodiversity beyond national jurisdiction. New Zealand\r\nreaffirms its readiness to engage seriously with others\r\nto work through the relevant issues to enhance\r\nprotection of the marine environment.\r\nNew Zealand is a strong supporter of the United\r\nNations Fish Stocks Agreement and urges wide\r\nparticipation in next year’s review conference to assess\r\nthe effectiveness of the Agreement in securing the\r\nconservation and management of straddling fish stocks\r\nand highly migratory fish stocks. New Zealand\r\nstrongly encourages appropriate application of the\r\nAgreement’s general principles to discrete fish stocks\r\nin the high seas.\r\nNew Zealand warmly welcomes the renewal of\r\nthe mandate for the Informal Consultative Process. We\r\ncontinue to believe that that forum provides an\r\ninvaluable opportunity for integrated discussion on\r\nimportant oceans issues. It is a positive signal that\r\nStates, while recognizing the need to strengthen and\r\nimprove the efficiency of the Consultative Process, are\r\nsupportive of its role.\r\nNew Zealand is concerned about the negative\r\nimpacts of illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing,\r\n17\r\nA/60/PV.54\r\nparticularly the extent to which it undermines\r\nconservation and management measures adopted by\r\nregional fisheries management organizations and,\r\nultimately, the sustainability of fish stocks. We are\r\npleased to see support for increased coordination and\r\ncooperation in important areas such as data collection,\r\ninformation-sharing, capacity-building and training.\r\nWe hope those efforts will contribute to greater\r\ncompliance with conservation and management\r\nmeasures.\r\nNew Zealand continues to believe that action to\r\naddress the adverse impacts of fishing activities on\r\nvulnerable marine ecosystems is necessary and urgent.\r\nLast year we noted that New Zealand was taking its\r\nfirst steps towards the establishment of a new regional\r\nfisheries management organization in the Tasman Sea\r\narea — the area adjacent to New Zealand’s waters.\r\nThis year we are pleased to advise that in February\r\n2006, New Zealand, with the support of Australia and\r\nChile, will host the first intergovernmental meeting to\r\ndiscuss the establishment of a regional fisheries\r\nmanagement organization in the South Pacific to\r\nregulate those species not covered by existing\r\norganizations. We see that initiative as an important\r\nstep in extending the geographical coverage of such\r\norganizations and facilitating the adoption of robust\r\nconservation and management measures.\r\nThe Pacific Islands Forum addressed the need for\r\nmanagement of deep-sea bottom trawling at its Leaders\r\nmeeting in October. Like all members of the Pacific\r\nIslands Forum, New Zealand is seriously concerned\r\nabout the need to protect biodiversity from the adverse\r\nimpacts of that activity. We will also actively engage in\r\nthe regional context to ensure better protection of\r\nvulnerable marine ecosystems.\r\nDuring next year’s General Assembly, Member\r\nStates will meet to review progress on action taken\r\nconcerning the impact of fishing on vulnerable marine\r\necosystems. Together with regional organizations, we\r\nas Member States must take the time to provide\r\ncomprehensive information to the Secretariat on\r\nactions taken to regulate destructive fishing practices\r\nand bottom trawling that have adverse impacts on\r\nvulnerable marine ecosystems. Comprehensive\r\nreporting by States and regional organizations will\r\nensure that next year’s review is meaningful and that\r\nfuture decisions on further measures are well-informed.\r\nWe look forward to the first draft of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report, in July next year, on actions taken by\r\nStates.\r\nFinally, we thank the Secretary-General for his\r\nreport, which is, as always, comprehensive and of great\r\nassistance to delegations and to the wider oceans\r\nconstituency. We participated in the consideration of\r\nthe report during the Informal Consultative Process\r\nearlier this year, which identified key issues of\r\nconcern. As a sponsor, we fully support the reflection\r\nof those concerns and the conclusions reached in both\r\ndraft resolutions under the agenda item.\r\nMr. Sen (India): My delegation welcomes the\r\ncomprehensive reports of the Secretary-General on\r\noceans and the law of the sea. We have studied with\r\ninterest the Secretary-General’s report on issues\r\nrelating to the conservation and sustainable use of\r\nmarine biodiversity beyond areas of national\r\njurisdiction, which was made available to assist the Ad\r\nHoc Open-ended informal Working Group in preparing\r\nits agenda. We appreciate its high quality and are sure\r\nthat the Ad-Hoc Working Group will benefit from the\r\ndiverse information offered in the report.\r\nThe fisheries sector occupies an important place\r\nin the socio-economic development of India. It is a\r\npowerful income and employment generator, stimulates\r\nthe growth of a number of subsidiary industries and is\r\na source of cheap and nutritious food, besides being a\r\nforeign exchange earner. Most importantly, it is the\r\nsource of livelihood for many economically marginal\r\ncommunities.\r\nHarvesting of marine fish resources in India takes\r\nplace at three levels, namely, subsistence fishing,\r\nsmall-scale fishing and industrial fishing. The recently\r\nadopted marine fishing policy of the Government of\r\nIndia advocates the protection and encouragement of\r\nsubsistence fishermen, technology transfer to the small\r\nscale sector, and infrastructure support to the industrial\r\nsector. The policy also emphasizes that efforts should\r\nbe made to fully comply with international\r\nrequirements in post-harvest care of catch, so as to\r\nachieve the highest standards of food safety.\r\nIndia attaches high importance to the effective\r\nfunctioning of the institutions established under the\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\r\n(UNCLOS). Given the geography of India, with a\r\ncoastline extending 4,000 miles and with 1,300 islands,\r\nwe have a traditional and abiding interest in maritime\r\nand ocean affairs. The large population in our coastal\r\n18\r\nA/60/PV.54\r\nareas and in the islands has always looked to the sea\r\nfor sustenance. We will continue to extend our full\r\ncooperation and participate actively and constructively\r\nin all activities pertaining to the Convention and\r\nrelated agreements.\r\nIndia’s accession this month to the Agreement on\r\nthe Privileges and Immunities of the International\r\nTribunal for the Law of the Sea and to the Protocol on\r\nthe Privileges and Immunities of the International\r\nSeabed Authority demonstrates our commitment to\r\nwork closely with the institutions established under the\r\nConvention.\r\nAll of the subsidiary institutions under the\r\nConvention, namely, the International Seabed\r\nAuthority, the International Tribunal for the Law of the\r\nSea and the Commission on the Limits of the\r\nContinental Shelf, have made considerable progress in\r\ntheir respective areas of work over the past year. India\r\nhas been working closely with all of those institutions.\r\nWe have invested heavily in the exploration of\r\nminerals in the deep seabed. We continue to incur\r\nconsiderable expenditure for the collection of data as a\r\nprimary investor and now as a Contractor.\r\nThe International Seabed Authority is currently\r\ninvolved in the development of a legal regime for the\r\nprospecting and exploration of polymetallic sulphides\r\nand cobalt-rich crusts. We appreciate the role of the\r\nAuthority in the conservation of biodiversity in the\r\nArea, especially the elaboration of the rules,\r\nregulations and procedures to ensure the effective\r\nprotection of the marine environment, the protection\r\nand conservation of the natural resources of the Area\r\nand the prevention of damage to its flora and fauna\r\nfrom harmful effects that may arise from activities in\r\nthe Area.\r\nWe note with satisfaction the progress made by\r\nthe Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf.\r\nThe Commission becomes active as four coastal States\r\nhave submitted their claims under article 76 of the\r\nConvention and a number of countries have indicated\r\nthe coming submission of their claims between 2005\r\nand 2008. The developing countries that are in the\r\nprocess of preparing submissions to the Commission\r\nmight require help in some cases to enhance their\r\ncapacity. In that regard, we appreciate the regional\r\ntraining courses conducted by the Division for Ocean\r\nAffairs and the Law of the Sea in Fiji and Sri Lanka\r\nand welcome the efforts made by the Division to\r\norganize training courses in Ghana and Argentina.\r\nWe believe that States that have expertise in the\r\ndelineation of the outer limits of the Continental Shelf\r\nshould also extend such cooperation by providing\r\nassistance to developing States that require expertise to\r\nsubmit their claim under article 76 of the Convention.\r\nIn that regard, we would like to reiterate that India has\r\nthe requisite expertise for assessment and mapping of\r\nthe continental shelf. We have been and are willing to\r\nextend cooperation in training other developing\r\ncountries for that purpose.\r\nWe also welcome in that context the efforts of the\r\nDivision in publishing a training manual to assist\r\nStates in developing the requisite knowledge and skills\r\nin preparing their submission in respect of the outer\r\nlimits of the continental shelf. We are happy to note\r\nthat the checking of the comprehensive training manual\r\nhas been completed and its final version will be\r\navailable shortly.\r\nThe International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea\r\nhas been active as an independent judicial body\r\nestablished by the Convention to adjudicate disputes\r\narising out of its interpretation or application. It has\r\ndecided a number of cases involving a wide variety of\r\nissues, such as freedom of navigation and other\r\ninternationally lawful uses of the seas, the enforcement\r\nof customs laws, refuelling vessels at sea, the right of\r\nhot pursuit, conservation and sustainable use of fish\r\nstocks, provisional measures and matters involving\r\nland reclamation. The Tribunal enjoys a high\r\nreputation for fairness and integrity. We congratulate\r\nthe newly elected judges to the International Tribunal\r\nfor the Law of the Sea and its new President.\r\nThe international community has continued to\r\nfocus over the past year on issues relating to\r\nnavigation, the conservation and management of living\r\nmarine resources, and the conservation and\r\nmanagement of the biological diversity of the sea-bed\r\nin areas beyond national jurisdiction. The discovery of\r\nhighly complex and diverse ecosystems in areas\r\nbeyond national jurisdiction, coupled with advances in\r\nthe biotechnology sector, have led to increasing\r\ninterest and activities in relation to genetic resources\r\nbeyond national jurisdiction. As a corollary to those\r\ndevelopments, the general debate over the legal status\r\nof genetic resources located in the sea-bed in areas\r\n19\r\nA/60/PV.54\r\nbeyond national jurisdiction is also taking on\r\nincreasing intensity.\r\nThe need to devise new approaches within the\r\nconfines of UNCLOS to promote international\r\ncooperation aimed at the conservation and sustainable\r\nuse of living resources of the high seas and benefit-\r\nsharing of sea-bed resources located in the areas\r\nbeyond national jurisdiction cannot be\r\noveremphasized. The participation of developing\r\ncountries in devising such new approaches greatly\r\ndepends on the scientific information available to\r\nthem. The promotion of the flow of scientific data and\r\ninformation, and the transfer of knowledge resulting\r\nfrom marine scientific research, especially to\r\ndeveloping States, is therefore needed.\r\nIn the area of navigation, we would like to\r\nexpress our serious concern over the escalation of\r\npiracy and robbery at sea. Recent incidents involving\r\nthe killing of crew members, hostage-taking and the\r\nhijacking of a ship chartered by the World Food\r\nProgramme carrying food aid for Somali survivors of\r\nthe Indian Ocean tsunami represent grave threats to\r\nmaritime security. The international community must\r\nfind ways and means to end this menace.\r\nIt is a matter of serious concern that efforts to\r\nimprove the conservation and management of the\r\nworld’s fisheries have been hampered by the increase\r\nin illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing\r\nactivities on the high seas, in contravention of the\r\nconservation and management measures adopted by\r\nregional fisheries organizations and arrangements, and\r\nin areas under national jurisdiction, in violation of\r\ncoastal States’ sovereign right to conserve and manage\r\ntheir marine living resources.\r\nFishing over capacity is another negative factor\r\nwhich is responsible for creating a situation in which\r\nthe harvesting exceeds the amount of resource\r\navailable to harvest. Any action that would help in\r\nreversing the trend of over-fishing in many areas would\r\nhelp in the reduction of IUU fishing and guarantee the\r\nenforcement of the rights of developing coastal States.\r\nAnother way of eliminating IUU fishing is to eliminate\r\nsubsidies that contribute to illegal, unreported and\r\nunregulated fishing.\r\nIn the context of sustainable fisheries, the need to\r\nenable developing countries to develop national,\r\nregional, and subregional capacities for infrastructure\r\nand integrated management and the sustainable use of\r\nfisheries cannot be overemphasized. A better\r\nunderstanding of the oceans through the application of\r\nmarine science and technology and a more effective\r\ninterface between scientific knowledge and decision-\r\nmaking are central to the sustainable use and\r\nmanagement of the oceans.\r\nMarine scientific research can lead to a better\r\nunderstanding and utilization of the ocean and its\r\nresources in almost all aspects, including fisheries,\r\nmarine pollution and coastal zone management.\r\nAccordingly, it is vital that developing countries have\r\naccess to and share in the benefits of scientific\r\nknowledge on the oceans. Developing countries also\r\nneed to be provided assistance for capacity-building, as\r\nwell as for the development of information resources\r\nand related skills, to manage the oceans for their\r\neconomic development. We therefore particularly\r\nsupport operative paragraph 16 of the draft resolution\r\n(A/60/L.23) on sustainable fisheries, which, inter alia,\r\ninvites States and international financial institutions\r\nand organizations of the United Nations system to\r\nprovide assistance to developing States to enable them\r\nto develop their national capacity to exploit fishery\r\nresources.\r\nMr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese):\r\nMaintaining and strengthening the international order\r\nfor the oceans and seas and promoting ocean-related\r\nactivities contribute to achieving the goals of peace and\r\nsecurity as laid down in the Charter of the United\r\nNations; to the promotion of cooperation and friendly\r\nrelations among all countries on the basis of fairness\r\nand justice; and to global economic growth and social\r\nharmony. Endeavours in that regard are in keeping with\r\nhumankind’s desire, as evidenced today, to achieve the\r\ngoals of peace, cooperation and development. We hope\r\nthat consideration of the agenda item on oceans and the\r\nlaw of the sea at this session of the General Assembly\r\nwill make a further contribution to the attainment of\r\nthose goals.\r\nThe Chinese delegation believes that the legal\r\nregime set out in the 1982 United Nations Convention\r\non the Law of the Sea remains the legal basis for the\r\ncontemporary international order for the oceans. We\r\nare pleased to note that the number of States parties to\r\nthe Convention has increased to 149, evidence of the\r\ngrowing universality of the Convention. We hope to\r\nsee more States accede to it.\r\n20\r\nA/60/PV.54\r\nThree issues are of particular importance in the\r\ncontext of international ocean affairs: first, the further\r\nimplementation of the provisions of the Convention\r\npertaining to the protection and conservation of the\r\nmarine environment and research in marine science and\r\nin the development and transfer of marine\r\ntechnologies; secondly, building up the capacity of\r\ndeveloping countries so as to enable them to utilize\r\nmore effectively marine resources and make a greater\r\ncontribution to international ocean affairs; thirdly, the\r\nfull use of relevant international organizations and\r\nmechanisms and the strengthening of cooperation and\r\ncoordination among them.\r\nOcean-related issues are closely interlinked and\r\nmust be addressed in an integrated and holistic manner.\r\nThe United Nations is the most appropriate and\r\nauthoritative forum for dealing with these issues,\r\nwhich are of common concern to all countries. We\r\nsupport the Open-ended Informal Consultative Process\r\non Oceans and the Law of the Sea set up by resolution\r\n54/33 and extended by resolution 57/141. In the past\r\nsix years, that Process has served as an important\r\nforum in which all States, including non-parties to the\r\nConvention, can discuss issues about oceans and the\r\nlaw of the sea and coordinate their positions. It has\r\ntherefore contributed positively to the deliberations of\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nExperience has shown that the principles set out\r\nin resolution 54/33 for the Process have been critical in\r\nensuring that the wisdom of all participants is pooled\r\nand in advancing the consideration of agenda items.\r\nWe support the extension of the Process, based on\r\nexisting principles, for another three years and agree\r\nthat there is a need to improve its working methods in\r\norder to enhance its efficiency.\r\nThe protection of the marine environment calls\r\nfor urgent action. The Chinese Government attaches\r\ngreat importance to the protection of the marine\r\nenvironment and to the promotion of sustainable\r\ndevelopment. It took an active part in the 2002 World\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development and supports the\r\nearly establishment of the regular process for global\r\nreporting and assessment of the state of the marine\r\nenvironment, including socio-economic aspects, within\r\nthe United Nations framework, while making full use\r\nof existing regional assessment mechanisms. We\r\nwelcome the outcome of the second international\r\nworkshop held this June and hope to see the\r\n“assessment of assessments” begin at an early date on\r\nthat basis, so that the process can be launched soon.\r\nChina is ready and willing to participate directly in\r\nefforts towards that end and to contribute to the\r\nprocess.\r\nWith regard to the conservation and sustainable\r\nuse of marine biological diversity beyond areas of\r\nnational jurisdiction, the Chinese delegation welcomes\r\nthe establishment by resolution 59/24 of an ad hoc\r\nopen-ended informal working group. We believe that\r\nthe protection of biodiversity beyond areas of national\r\njurisdiction should take full account of existing\r\nregimes concerning the high seas and international sea-\r\nbed and give full play to the role of existing\r\ninternational organizations and institutions. This is\r\nvery important work, and China will actively take part\r\nin it.\r\nThe Review Conference of the 1995 United\r\nNations Fish Stocks Agreement will be held next year\r\nto evaluate the effectiveness of the Agreement in the\r\nconservation and management of straddling fish stocks\r\nand highly migratory fish stocks. Pursuant to article 36\r\nof the Agreement, the Secretary-General will, at that\r\ntime, invite to the Conference all States parties to the\r\nAgreement and States and entities entitled to become\r\nparties, as well as intergovernmental and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations entitled to participate as\r\nobservers in the Conference.\r\nThe Chinese delegation will seriously prepare for\r\nand actively participate in the Review Conference, as\r\nwell as in the preparatory meeting, and will play a\r\nconstructive role. The Chinese Government believes\r\nthat the entry into force of the 1995 Agreement has\r\nmade it easier to regulate fishing conduct on the high\r\nseas and to make it more uniform.\r\nThe key to the implementation of the Agreement\r\nis to be found at the regional level. Regional fishery\r\nmanagement organizations and arrangements should\r\ncontinue to play a significant role, act according to\r\ntheir respective circumstances and formulate and\r\nimplement fishery-related conservation and\r\nmanagement measures on the basis of full\r\nconsultations.\r\nChina is one of the developing countries that\r\nhave the largest number of fishermen and fishing\r\nfleets. Our fisheries are of vital importance to food\r\nsecurity, social stability and poverty reduction in\r\nChina. For the past decade or so, China, as a\r\nresponsible fishing State, has done a great deal to\r\n21\r\nA/60/PV.54\r\nstrengthen the conservation and management of fishery\r\nresources and has curbed its harvesting as much as\r\npossible in the interests of the sustainable development\r\nof global fisheries.\r\nThe Chinese delegation believes that when\r\nconsidering fishery issues, the international community\r\nshould aim at regulating conduct and achieving\r\nsustainable development. For those purposes, we need\r\nto achieve an appropriate balance in the relationships\r\nbetween, first, fishery production and the conservation\r\nof fishery resources; secondly, the conservation of\r\nfishery resources and the protection of the marine\r\nenvironment; thirdly, the needs of the present\r\ngeneration and those of future generations; fourthly,\r\ncoastal fisheries and high-seas fisheries; and, fifthly,\r\nthe practice of “first-come-first-served” and the need to\r\nensure the right of all countries, particularly\r\ndeveloping countries, to share fishery resources.\r\nIn the view of the Chinese delegation, building\r\nthe marine capacity of the developing countries is a\r\nmajor issue confronting the international community.\r\nMany developing countries must, as a matter of\r\nurgency, build up their capacities in the areas of\r\nnautical charts production, ship-building, the\r\nprotection of the marine environment, marine science\r\nresearch and development, law enforcement at sea and\r\nthe combating of maritime crimes.\r\nIn order to enhance the capacity of the\r\ndeveloping countries in marine conservation and\r\nmanagement, the developed countries should actively\r\nfacilitate the transfer of marine technologies to the\r\ndeveloping countries under fair and reasonable\r\nconditions, and the relevant international organizations\r\nshould assist the developing countries in carrying out\r\nregional or multilateral cooperation, in securing\r\nappropriate international funding for marine research\r\nand development and in personnel training. The\r\nChinese Government and people have had some\r\nsuccess in the area of marine capacity-building, and we\r\nare more than willing to share our experiences with\r\nother developing countries.\r\nSince ancient times, the oceans and the seas have\r\nconfronted the human race with numerous difficulties\r\nand challenges, while yielding bountiful harvests and\r\nproviding for its well-being. We need sufficient\r\ncourage to overcome the difficulties and challenges\r\nand sufficient wisdom to enjoy the harvests and the\r\nstate of well-being. China is ready to join with other\r\ncountries to uphold the spirit of the Convention, abide\r\nby international commitments and work for the cause\r\nof ocean affairs, as well as for peace, justice, harmony\r\nand the progress of humankind.\r\nMs. Juul (Norway): The General Assembly is the\r\nuniversal forum for discussing current issues regarding\r\nocean affairs and the law of the sea. That is underlined\r\nby the breadth of the issues currently being dealt with\r\nwithin the broader framework of the Assembly. It is\r\nessential that all important discussions on the broader\r\ndevelopments of the law of the sea should take place\r\nwithin this representative forum, and we believe that\r\nthe United Nations will continue to have an important\r\nrole to play.\r\nIn this regard, I would like to commend the\r\nDivision for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea on\r\nthe excellent job that it is doing to provide the\r\nAssembly with the necessary input on the topics under\r\ndiscussion. This year, as always, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s reports on the law of the sea and related\r\nissues are of the highest quality. Those reports are\r\ninvaluable tools for evaluating the dynamic\r\ndevelopments in ocean affairs.\r\nI will focus on three main topics in my statement\r\ntoday: the evaluation of the 1995 Fish Stocks\r\nAgreement, the sustainable management of living\r\nmarine resources and protection of the marine\r\nenvironment, and maritime security.\r\nThe 1995 Fish Stocks Agreement is an essential\r\ncontribution to the law of the sea as regards the\r\nmanagement of straddling and highly migratory fish\r\nstocks. We will evaluate the Agreement during a one-\r\nweek conference in May next year, only four years\r\nafter it came into force. The Agreement must be\r\nregarded as an infant in the context of international\r\nlaw, and we must keep that in mind when we review it.\r\nSo far, only 56 States have become party to the\r\nAgreement. That means that several important fishing\r\nnations are still outside that cooperation. At this stage,\r\nthe rather low number of parties is the Agreement’s\r\nmain weakness. The conference will provide an\r\nopportunity to take a closer look at what is keeping\r\nStates from joining and what measures we can take\r\ncollectively to get more States on board. The\r\nconference should take advantage of that opportunity\r\nand develop a systematic approach for encouraging\r\nmore States to join. Let me also take this opportunity to\r\n22\r\nA/60/PV.54\r\nencourage all States that are not party to the Agreement\r\nto join as soon as possible.\r\nAn important task for the conference will be\r\nevaluating the implementation of the provisions of the\r\nAgreement in the national legislation of the parties and\r\nin the mandates of the regional fisheries management\r\norganizations of which they are members. Those\r\norganizations and their parties have a heavy\r\nresponsibility as regards a broad range of challenges\r\nrelated to ecosystem-based resource management and\r\nthe conservation of biodiversity. States must make sure\r\nthat their regional fisheries management organizations\r\nand other arrangements have the mandates they need in\r\norder to make all necessary management and\r\nconservation decisions.\r\nAt the conference we must also consider what we\r\ncan do to expand the network of regional fisheries\r\nmanagement organizations and other arrangements, for\r\nexample by establishing new such bodies for areas that\r\nare not currently covered by any organization or\r\narrangement.\r\nThe United Nations Convention on the Law of\r\nthe Sea recognizes the responsibility of coastal States\r\nfor the sustainable management of living resources in\r\ntheir maritime zones. Through the Agreement, States\r\nare obliged to cooperate in the management of\r\nstraddling and highly migratory fish stocks. In\r\ndischarging those responsibilities, the coastal States\r\nand the regional fisheries management organizations\r\nare afforded a wide range of discretion when choosing\r\nthe most appropriate management measures.\r\nHowever responsible and precautionary the\r\ncoastal States and such organizations might be in their\r\nmanagement, the full purpose will not be served as\r\nlong as we are struggling with illegal, unreported and\r\nunregulated (IUU) fishing. Such fishing is the single\r\nmost serious threat to the world’s marine resources\r\ntoday. Curbing such fishing is therefore among the\r\nmost important measures we can take to protect marine\r\nresources. The responsibility for doing so\r\nunquestionably rests with each and every State\r\ninvolved in fishing or the fish trade in one way or\r\nanother. Here, obviously, a huge responsibility rests\r\nwith the flag States. Unfortunately, some States allow\r\nvessels to fly their flag without ensuring that the\r\nfishing practices of those vessels are legal and sound.\r\nThe substantial strengthening of targeted port State\r\ncontrol measures is also crucial in order to effectively\r\ncombat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.\r\nRecently, in the international debate on the\r\nsustainable management of marine resources and the\r\nprotection of marine ecosystems, there has been a\r\nstrong focus on the high seas. There are substantial\r\nchallenges related to biodiversity in areas outside\r\nnational jurisdiction. However, the high-seas focus\r\nmust not mislead us into thinking that the greatest\r\nchallenges related to resource management and\r\nconservation are to be found on the high seas. Rather,\r\nthe main problems are still to be found within national\r\nzones. The greatest challenge is to encourage the\r\nnecessary political will so that States will deal\r\neffectively with their domestic problems.\r\nWhile the main problems related to the marine\r\nenvironment and to marine resources are within\r\nnational zones, there are also obvious and huge\r\nchallenges on the high seas. In that regard, we have\r\ndiscussed the legal basis for taking measures in those\r\nareas. Some claim that the problem is that no State or\r\norganization has the jurisdiction to deal effectively\r\nwith these problems. That has led to calls for the\r\nnegotiation of new legal instruments. Some call for the\r\nformation of some kind of body with the authority to,\r\nfor example, establish marine protected areas. I would\r\nlike to make a few points in that regard.\r\nFirst, States have jurisdiction to regulate\r\nactivities carried out by their subordinates on the high\r\nseas.\r\nSecondly, there are several organizations that\r\nalready have regulatory competence on the high seas.\r\nRegional fisheries management organizations and the\r\nInternational Maritime Organization (IMO) are\r\nexamples of entities that can make decisions of a\r\nbinding nature regarding activities on the high seas\r\nwithin their respective mandates. The International\r\nSeabed Authority can and is supposed to regulate\r\nmining activities in the Area in such a way that any\r\nnegative effects on the marine environment are\r\nminimized or avoided.\r\nThirdly, our focus should be on identifying\r\npractical measures to deal with specific problems. The\r\nchallenge is to utilize existing instruments and\r\nmechanisms to the fullest extent possible within their\r\ncurrent mandates in order to manage and conserve\r\nmarine biodiversity in these areas.\r\n23\r\nA/60/PV.54\r\nFourthly, the limits on measures that may be\r\nimplemented within the framework of existing\r\ninstruments and mechanisms are determined by the\r\npolitical will of States. Negotiating new instruments is\r\ntime-consuming and difficult, and it diverts valuable\r\nresources and focus from the implementation of\r\nspecific measures that will have practical results in the\r\nshort term. Rather than focusing on developing new\r\ninstruments, States should cooperate more closely so as\r\nto utilize existing possibilities.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s latest report on oceans\r\nand the law of the sea refers to a large number of actual\r\nand attempted acts of piracy and armed robbery. It is\r\nreported that the level of violence has escalated and\r\nthat the areas most affected are in the Far East. This\r\nthreat to seafarers and the shipping industry is of great\r\nconcern to my Government. We commend those Asian\r\nGovernments that have taken an active interest in\r\ndeveloping cooperation to curb this problem, and we\r\nstand ready to cooperate further in an attempt to make\r\nshipping more secure. The IMO also deserves praise\r\nfor its efforts. We encourage that organization to\r\ncontinue its engagement in this field.\r\nAn important step to prevent and suppress\r\nterrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction at sea was taken in London last October,\r\nwhen the IMO Diplomatic Conference adopted a\r\nprotocol to amend the Convention for the Suppression\r\nof Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime\r\nNavigation. Those amendments provide for the\r\ncriminalization of additional international terrorist and\r\nnon-proliferation offences and a boarding regime for\r\ninterdiction on the high seas. That is a major\r\ncontribution to the implementation of Security Council\r\nresolutions 1368 (2001), 1373 (2001) and 1540 (2004)\r\nagainst terrorism and proliferation. I would like to\r\ncommend the International Maritime Organization on a\r\njob well done, and I encourage all parties to sign and\r\nratify the protocol as soon as possible.\r\nMr. Al-Mutairi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): I\r\nshould like at the outset to thank the Secretary-General\r\nfor his comprehensive reports on agenda item 75,\r\nregarding the United Nations Convention on the Law\r\nof the Sea (UNCLOS) and the commitments set out\r\ntherein.\r\nThe State of Kuwait welcomes the steady\r\nincrease in the number of parties to the Convention,\r\nwhich has now reached 149. We urge those countries\r\nthat have not yet joined the Convention to expedite\r\ntheir accession to the Convention in view of its\r\nuniversality and importance. We also wish to express\r\nour appreciation for the progress made by all the\r\ninstitutions established under the Convention’s\r\nprovisions, particularly the International Seabed\r\nAuthority, the International Tribunal for the Law of the\r\nSea and the Commission on the Limits of the\r\nContinental Shelf.\r\nStressing the importance of full implementation\r\nof the provisions of the Convention as the legally\r\nagreed framework for the peaceful uses of the oceans\r\nand seas, we express our belief that building the\r\ncapacities of States parties is key to the successful\r\nimplementation of the Convention, because it will\r\nenable developing nations to more effectively manage\r\nand conserve their marine resources.\r\nThe United Nations Convention on the Law of\r\nthe Sea defines the legal framework within which all\r\nactivities relating to the oceans and seas should be\r\ncarried out. It stipulates the limits of regional waters,\r\nareas of national jurisdiction and the limits of the\r\ncontinental shelf, in addition to the freedom of\r\nnavigation beyond the limits of national jurisdiction\r\nand the right of transit in regional waters and in straits\r\nused for international navigation. It also supports\r\nfriendly relations and cooperation among all countries.\r\nSuch integration in the provisions of the Convention is\r\nthe basis of the sovereignty of the law of the oceans\r\nand the seas. The State of Kuwait therefore calls for\r\nenhanced cooperation and coordination at all levels in\r\naccordance with the provisions of the Convention, in\r\norder to address all aspects of integrated management\r\nand sustainable development of the seas and oceans.\r\nWe attach great importance to the protection and\r\nconservation of the marine environment and its\r\nbiodiversity. Therefore, we must redouble our efforts to\r\ncombat and limit the pollution and degradation of\r\nmarine ecosystems. In that context, we must take into\r\nconsideration the proposals of the Johannesburg Plan\r\nof Implementation adopted at the World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development, which calls for the\r\nmaintenance of the productivity and biodiversity of\r\nimportant and vulnerable marine and coastal areas,\r\nincluding in areas within and beyond national\r\njurisdiction. We should also put an end to the use of\r\nfishing techniques that are harmful to the marine\r\nenvironment. We also join all delegations in calling for\r\n24\r\nA/60/PV.54\r\ntaking necessary measures to put an end to illegal\r\nfishing, in accordance with international law.\r\nThe State of Kuwait is fully committed to the\r\nissue of oceans and the law of the sea and acceded to\r\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\r\nin 1986 and to several other conventions, including, in\r\n2002 the Agreement relating to the implementation of\r\nPart XI of the United Nations Convention on the Law\r\nof the Sea.\r\nKuwait is also party to the Protocol concerning\r\nMarine Pollution Resulting from Exploration and\r\nExploitation of the Continental Shelf. Kuwait is also\r\nconsidering acceding to the 1995 United Nations Fish\r\nStocks Agreement, as well as other relevant\r\ninstruments. In April 2005, Kuwait submitted a report\r\non the matter to the Secretary-General.\r\nAt this time we would like to note that Kuwait is\r\nthe host country of the Regional Organization for the\r\nProtection of the Marine Environment (ROPME),\r\nwhich was established by regional agreement in 1978,\r\nin order to promote cooperation in protecting the\r\nmarine environment from pollution. It is an agreement\r\nthat seeks to coordinate the efforts of all countries of\r\nthe Gulf region for the protection and conservation of\r\nmarine resources.\r\nKuwait is also involved in other programmes\r\nwith the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)\r\nfor the protection of the marine environment.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to emphasize that my\r\ndelegation hopes to undertake joint efforts to improve\r\nthe lives of all peoples of the world through the\r\noptimum exploration and exploitation of marine\r\nresources and their conservation, which would enable\r\neach and every country to realize the environmental\r\nsustainability it seeks to achieve.\r\nMr. Ray (Australia): A year ago we marked the\r\nimportant milestone of the tenth anniversary of the\r\nentry into force of the United Nations Convention on\r\nthe Law of the Sea. Year by year, we have seen a\r\nstrengthening in the status of the Convention as the\r\nfoundation of the global community’s interaction with,\r\nand use of, the ocean and its resources.\r\nSince last year, we have moved closer to realizing\r\nthe objective of universal adherence to the Convention,\r\nand Australia congratulates those States that acceded in\r\nthe past year: Burkina Faso, Estonia and Latvia. It\r\ncannot be denied that significant portions of the\r\nConvention now form part of the corpus of customary\r\ninternational law.\r\nIn coming years, we should continue to focus on\r\nensuring effective oceans governance through\r\nimplementation of the Convention and related\r\ninstruments. We also need to continue our work in\r\nidentifying any gaps in the regime for high seas\r\ngovernance and work towards building cooperative\r\nmechanisms to properly conserve and sustainably\r\nmanage the living resources of the oceans.\r\nGiven the importance we attach to as-broad-as-\r\npossible participation by States in informal meetings\r\nfor the preparation of General Assembly draft\r\nresolutions, Australia wishes to express its concern at\r\nthe numerous scheduling conflicts with other essential\r\nmeetings this year. Those clashes have made our and\r\nother delegations’ effective participation in the\r\ninformal preparatory process extremely difficult, and\r\nwe call on the Secretary-General to ensure that the\r\nsituation is not repeated in coming years.\r\nWe express our thanks to the coordinators and the\r\nSecretariat, whose jobs seem to get harder every year\r\nas the resolutions get longer and longer. There are\r\nmany topical aspects of the law of the sea and\r\ninternational fisheries that are worthy of our close\r\nattention, but their prominence is only obscured by our\r\ncollective insistence on repeating the same things year\r\nafter year. We urge again that all Members endeavour\r\nto shorten the draft resolutions in future.\r\nAs usual, Australia will co-sponsor and, if\r\nnecessary, vote in favour of both draft resolutions\r\nbefore us. We are pleased with the attention given to\r\nthe issues, such as maritime security, the sustainable\r\nmanagement and conservation of marine living\r\nresources, and the work of the Commission on the\r\nLimits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS).\r\nThreats to maritime security cannot be ignored.\r\nThe potential impact of threats to maritime security on\r\nsea transportation, safety of navigation and the marine\r\nenvironment, as well as the threat posed to human lives\r\nand property, calls for effective countermeasures at the\r\ninternational, regional and bilateral levels.\r\nFor that reason, Australia welcomes paragraph 50\r\nof the omnibus draft resolution, and looks forward to\r\nworking with other States to continue to address threats\r\nto maritime security. We welcome and support\r\npractical measures to improve maritime security and\r\n25\r\nA/60/PV.54\r\nwould be ready to explore requests for technical\r\nassistance and capacity-building.\r\nIn particular, we welcome the recent adoption by\r\nthe International Maritime Organization in October this\r\nyear of two protocols amending the 1988 Convention\r\nfor the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the\r\nSafety of Maritime Navigation and its 1988 Protocol\r\nrelating to fixed platforms on the continental shelf.\r\nWhen implemented, the new definitions of\r\noffences under those Protocols will represent an\r\nimportant tool in the fight against terrorism and the\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Australia\r\nwill give early consideration to signing and\r\nimplementing the protocols in accordance with its\r\ndomestic treaty-making processes, and urges other\r\nStates to do the same, as soon as possible, in respect of\r\nboth the original Convention on the safety of maritime\r\nnavigation and the fixed platforms Protocol, as well as\r\nthe recently adopted amending protocols.\r\nIn addition, Australia welcomes the adoption in\r\nNovember 2004 of the Regional Cooperation\r\nAgreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery\r\nagainst Ships in Asia. The Agreement provides a\r\ntransparent means of engaging countries in the Asia-\r\nPacific region in maritime security through information\r\nsharing.\r\nAustralia welcomes paragraph 35 of the omnibus\r\ndraft resolution. Last year, Australia lodged with the\r\nCommission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf its\r\nsubmission on the outer limit of the shelf beyond 200\r\nnautical miles from the territorial sea baseline. We look\r\nforward to working with the Commission in the\r\ncoming months as it formulates the recommendations\r\non which our final and binding outer limit will be\r\nbased.\r\nWe are confident that those recommendations\r\nwill emerge within a reasonable timeframe. However,\r\nwe are concerned that, for reasons beyond the\r\nCommission’s control, it will not necessarily be the\r\ncase for States that follow us, given that the\r\nCommission now only has the capacity to deal in detail\r\nwith two submissions concurrently.\r\nWe welcome the work of the Division for Ocean\r\nAffairs and the Law of the Sea in assisting to build the\r\ncapacity of States preparing submissions. From\r\nAustralia’s viewpoint, we are pleased to be able to\r\nshare our experiences with other States undertaking the\r\nprocess of planning or preparing their own\r\nsubmissions.\r\nTurning to fisheries, Australia welcomes the\r\naccession, since our last session, of four more States to\r\nthe vitally important United Nations Fish Stocks\r\nAgreement: Belize, Guinea, Kiribati and Liberia. Wide\r\nacceptance of the Agreement’s provisions will add to\r\ntheir impact in enhancing the international law of\r\nfisheries.\r\nMoreover, the review conference on the\r\nAgreement coming in May 2006 will provide an\r\nimportant opportunity for States to take stock, critically\r\nassess the effectiveness of the Agreement and promote\r\ncooperative and sustainable fisheries management and\r\nthe international law of the sea more generally.\r\nRegional organizations play an important role in\r\nthe management of responsible and ecologically\r\nsustainable fishing, especially in areas where no\r\nmanagement regime currently exists. We welcome\r\nvarious developments in Australia’s region with\r\nrespect to regional fisheries management organizations.\r\nThe Western and Central Pacific Ocean Fisheries\r\nCommission (WCPFC), currently chaired by Australia,\r\nheld its first meeting in the Federated States of\r\nMicronesia in December 2004. The second meeting\r\nwill be held in a few days.\r\nThe stocks of the Western and Central Pacific are\r\na significant natural resource for Pacific coastal States.\r\nAustralia will continue to work hard with its\r\nneighbours to ensure that this regional fisheries\r\nmanagement organization employs world best practice\r\nin the sustainable management and the conservation of\r\nhighly migratory species. We warmly welcome the\r\naccessions to the Honolulu Convention this year of the\r\nPhilippines, Japan, Canada, Vanuatu and France. It is\r\nparticularly gratifying to see such a broad participation\r\nin the Commission by coastal States and distant-water\r\nfishing interests.\r\nWe look forward to the adoption in the near\r\nfuture of the southern Indian Ocean fisheries\r\nagreement. It too should bring best international\r\npractice to the conservation and the sustainable\r\nmanagement of all fish stocks in the relevant part of\r\nthe Indian Ocean.\r\nAustralia is also pleased to inform members of a\r\nrecent initiative of Australia, New Zealand and Chile to\r\ncommence negotiations on a new regional fisheries\r\n26\r\nA/60/PV.54\r\nmanagement organization to regulate currently\r\nunregulated fish stocks in the South Pacific, which is\r\none of the last remaining areas of the high seas without\r\na comprehensive international management regime for\r\ndiscrete and straddling stocks. The first formal\r\nnegotiating conference will be held in Wellington in\r\nFebruary 2006, and we invite all States and entities\r\nwith a genuine interest in fishery to consider actively\r\nparticipating in the new regional fisheries management\r\norganization at the earliest possible stage.\r\nThe recommendations of the sixth meeting of the\r\nUnited Nations Open-ended Informal Consultative\r\nProcess on Oceans and the Law of the Sea are the\r\nsource of much of the new language in the draft\r\nresolutions before the Assembly. That further attests to\r\nthe value of the Oceans Process and the role it plays in\r\nenhancing and informing the Assembly’s debate.\r\nAustralia supports and welcomes the renewed\r\nmandate of the Oceans Process and hopes that it will\r\ncontinue to bring focused and expert deliberation,\r\nincluding from civil society, to complex issues facing\r\noceans and the law of the sea.\r\nAustralia has been a longstanding champion of\r\nhigh seas biodiversity conservation and is seriously\r\nconcerned about the impact of a range of human\r\nactivities on the vulnerable ecosystems of the high\r\nseas. Damaging impacts are caused by a range of\r\ndestructive fishing techniques and by the ever-present\r\nscourge of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.\r\nWe should not limit our focus simply to the issue of\r\nbottom trawling.\r\nThe efficacy of measures taken will depend in\r\npart on the willingness of flag States to properly\r\nregulate and control the activities of their nationals.\r\nAustralia will continue to ensure that fishing is\r\nconducted responsibly and managed through the use of\r\nappropriate measures. We will also continue to work\r\nhard to improve governance on the high seas more\r\ngenerally.\r\nAustralia welcomes the participation of non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, industry representatives\r\nand scientists in the planned February meeting of the\r\nAd hoc Open-ended Informal Working Group studying\r\nthe conservation and sustainable use of marine\r\nbiological diversity in areas beyond national\r\njurisdiction. Those areas cover about half of the\r\nworld’s surface, and their unique biodiversity has been\r\nthe subject of much international discussion in recent\r\nyears. We hope that the meeting in February will help\r\nidentify options for better conserving and sustainably\r\nmanaging that biodiversity.\r\nWe welcome the language on marine debris.\r\nDiscarded fishing nets and other gear, such as plastics,\r\nconstitute a significant danger to marine mammals and\r\nturtles in Australia’s region and more generally.\r\nGreater international cooperation is required. The first\r\nphase of the Global Marine Assessment — the so-\r\ncalled assessment of assessments — will be important.\r\nBetter scientific information is crucial for improving\r\nour decision-making and for better focusing our\r\nconservation-based initiatives.\r\nAustralia would like to underline its strong desire\r\nfor enhanced measures to tackle illegal and unregulated\r\nfishing. We continue to act firmly against unlicensed\r\nvessels fishing in Australian waters and have\r\nresponded promptly to situations of apparently illegal\r\nor unregulated vessels in areas regulated by regional\r\nfisheries management organization, in turn raising\r\nawareness among Member States.\r\nAustralia recently boarded a vessel suspected of\r\nfishing illegally in the Australian exclusive economic\r\nzone, with the express consent of the flag state,\r\nCambodia. The Australian Government is grateful to\r\nthe Government of Cambodia for its cooperative\r\napproach, which sets an example for other States that\r\nbecome aware of illegal conduct by their flagged\r\nvessels.\r\nConsistent with the United Nations Fish Stocks\r\nAgreement, it is Australia’s strong view that States\r\nhave an obligation either to join relevant regional\r\nfisheries management organizations where entitled to\r\ndo so or, otherwise, to refrain from fishing in areas\r\nregulated by such fisheries organizations, unless those\r\nStates agree to apply all relevant conservation\r\nmeasures. Australia does not view the general\r\nobligations under the United Nations Convention on\r\nthe Law of the Sea and customary international law\r\nwith respect to the conservation and the sustainable\r\nmanagement of marine living resources as merely\r\naspirational or amorphous. They are concrete and\r\nsubstantive obligations with direct application.\r\nAustralia welcomes the reference in the omnibus\r\ndraft resolution (A/60/L.23) to the Ministerial\r\nDeclaration of the May 2005 Conference on the\r\nGovernance of High Seas Fisheries and the United\r\nNations Fish Agreement, entitled “Moving from Words\r\n27\r\nA/60/PV.54\r\nto Action” and held in St. John’s, Canada. The\r\nDeclaration calls on States to take practical steps to\r\nend unsustainable fishing practices and reinforces the\r\ncommitment of all nations to manage fisheries in a\r\nsustainable fashion. Australia welcomes the impetus\r\nthe Declaration gives to fleshing out the meaning of a\r\ngenuine link between the flag State and the vessel in\r\nthe registration of fishing vessels and would welcome\r\ngreater transparency in fishing vessel ownership across\r\nthe globe.\r\nFinally, Australia would like to leave other\r\nmembers with the thought that perhaps treating illegal,\r\nunreported and unregulated fishing as a single\r\nproblem, which gets reduced to the acronym “IUU”,\r\nhas outlived its usefulness. After all, IUU fishing is not\r\njust one problem but three, each of which requires\r\nseparate international responses. Those responses must\r\nfocus on flag States’ responsibility over their vessels\r\nwhen fishing on the high seas or in the exclusive\r\neconomic zones of other States. Flag State\r\naccountability should be the focus of our efforts.\r\nMr. Hannesson (Iceland): At the outset I would\r\nlike to commend the Secretariat, in particular the able\r\nstaff of the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of\r\nthe Sea, headed by Mr. Vladimir Golitsyn, for their\r\ncomprehensive reports on oceans and the law of the sea\r\n(A/60/63 and A/60/91) and on sustainable fisheries\r\n(A/60/189). I would also like to express our\r\nappreciation for the other activities of the Division,\r\nwhich reflect the high standard of assistance provided\r\nto Member States by the Division.\r\nLet me furthermore acknowledge the professional\r\nmanner in which the coordinators, Commander Marcos\r\nde Almeida of Brazil and Ms. Holly Koehler of the\r\nUnited States, conducted the informal consultations on\r\nthe omnibus and fisheries draft resolutions. The\r\nconsultations were both lengthy and challenging this\r\nyear, and we wish to thank all participants for their\r\nconstructive contributions. As reflected in the draft\r\nomnibus resolution, one of the conclusions of the\r\ninformal consultations was that their efficiency would\r\nhave to be further improved in the future by limiting\r\nthe period of consultations on both draft resolutions to\r\na maximum of four weeks in total and by ensuring that\r\nthe consultations are scheduled in such a way as to\r\navoid overlap with the period in which the Sixth\r\nCommittee is meeting.\r\nThe Convention on the Law of the Sea, which is\r\nwithout doubt one of the greatest achievements in the\r\nhistory of the United Nations, provides a legal\r\nframework for all of our deliberations on the oceans\r\nand the law of the sea. We welcome the recent\r\nratification of the Convention by Latvia, Burkina Faso\r\nand Estonia, bringing the number of States parties to\r\n149, and urge those States that have still have not\r\nratified the Convention to do so, with a view to\r\nachieving the ultimate goal of universal participation.\r\nIt is imperative that the Convention be fully\r\nimplemented and that its integrity be preserved. Issues\r\nthat were settled at the Third United Nations\r\nConference on the Law of the Sea should not be\r\nreopened. In this respect, it needs to be borne in mind\r\nthat the conclusions of the Conference were regarded\r\nas a package, with individual States prevailing in some\r\nareas but having to compromise in others.\r\nWe note with satisfaction that the three\r\ninstitutions established under the Convention on the\r\nLaw of the Sea are functioning well. The International\r\nSeabed Authority is actively preparing for the future\r\nexploitation of mineral resources in the international\r\nseabed area. The International Tribunal for the Law of\r\nthe Sea has already adjudicated a number of disputes in\r\nthis field. It is clear, however, that the jurisdictional\r\npowers of the Tribunal have not yet been fully utilized,\r\nand we welcome the Tribunal’s initiative to promote\r\nknowledge of its various procedures. One example of\r\nthat initiative is the organization of a round-table\r\ndiscussion to take place here at the United Nations\r\ntomorrow afternoon, on the topic “Advisory\r\nproceedings before the International Tribunal for the\r\nLaw of the Sea”.\r\nWe are pleased to note the progress in the work of\r\nthe Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf.\r\nThe Commission is currently considering three new\r\nsubmissions regarding the establishment of the outer\r\nlimits of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical\r\nmiles, and a number of coastal States, including\r\nIceland, have advised it of their intention to make\r\nsubmissions in the near future.\r\nWe welcome the steps taken by the Secretariat to\r\nimprove the facilities for the use of the Commission\r\nand urge the Secretary-General to take all necessary\r\nactions to ensure that the Commission can fulfil the\r\nfunctions entrusted to it under the Convention in the\r\nlight of its rapidly increasing workload. We\r\n28\r\nA/60/PV.54\r\nfurthermore encourage States to make additional\r\ncontributions to the two voluntary continental shelf\r\ntrust funds established by resolution 55/7.\r\nThe United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement is of\r\nparamount importance, as it strengthens considerably\r\nthe framework for the conservation and management of\r\nstraddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks\r\nby regional fisheries management organizations. The\r\nprovisions of the Agreement strengthen in many ways\r\nthe relevant provisions of the Convention on the Law\r\nof the Sea, and some of the Agreement’s provisions\r\nrepresent the further development of international law\r\nin this area. We welcome the encouragement, in the\r\ndraft fisheries resolution, to States to recognize, as\r\nappropriate, that the general principles of the\r\nAgreement should apply also to discrete fish stocks in\r\nthe high seas.\r\nWe look forward to taking part in the fifth round\r\nof informal consultations of States parties to the\r\nAgreement in March and in the Review Conference in\r\nMay, the role of which is to assess the effectiveness of\r\nthe Agreement in securing the conservation and\r\nmanagement of straddling and highly migratory fish\r\nstocks. In the view of Iceland, the effectiveness of the\r\nAgreement depends primarily on its broad ratification\r\nand implementation. We welcome the ratification of\r\nthe Agreement this year by Belize, Kiribati, Guinea\r\nand Liberia, bringing the number of States parties to\r\n56, and urge those States, in particular fishing States,\r\nthat still have not ratified the Agreement to do so as\r\nsoon as possible.\r\nWith respect to the implementation of the\r\nAgreement, we encourage States to make additional\r\ncontributions to the Assistance Fund under Part VII of\r\nthe Agreement. In fact, we encourage capacity-building\r\nin developing countries in order to enable them to reap\r\nthe benefit of fisheries within and beyond areas under\r\ntheir national jurisdiction.\r\nThe world community does not lack the tools to\r\nensure the conservation and sustainable utilization of\r\nliving marine resources. In addition to the Convention\r\non the Law of the Sea and the Fish Stocks Agreement,\r\nChapter 17 of Agenda 21, the Code of Conduct for\r\nResponsible Fisheries of the Food and Agriculture\r\nOrganization of the United Nations and the Convention\r\non Biological Diversity all exemplify such tools,\r\nproviding States with the means to develop their\r\nfisheries management systems in a sustainable manner.\r\nWhile global instruments are often called for, we\r\nshould bear in mind that the responsible management\r\nof living marine resources is best carried out at the\r\nlocal and regional levels, in partnership with those who\r\nare closest to and depend on the resources for their\r\nlivelihood.\r\nIt is the firm view of the Government of Iceland\r\nthat the General Assembly, in its deliberations on the\r\noceans and the law of the sea, should focus on specific\r\nissues that have global implications, and not on issues\r\nthat fall within the purview of the sovereign rights of\r\nStates or that are under the responsibility of regional\r\nfisheries management organizations. The Assembly\r\nshould address issues that are global in nature and that\r\ncan be solved only through global cooperation. We\r\nshould thus address, for example, marine pollution,\r\nwhich respects no boundaries and must therefore be\r\nmet with global action.\r\nThe conservation and sustainable utilization of\r\nliving marine resources is, on the other hand, a local\r\nand regional matter. We cannot, therefore, accept the\r\nopening of the door to the global micromanagement of\r\nfisheries, which are subject to the sovereign rights of\r\nStates or under the responsibility of regional fisheries\r\nmanagement organizations.\r\nIn that context, we were satisfied with the\r\noutcome of the thorough consultations on the fisheries\r\nresolution last year with respect to the impact of\r\nfishing on vulnerable marine ecosystems. The relevant\r\nparagraphs of resolution 59/25, which are reaffirmed in\r\nthe draft resolution on fisheries this year, recognize\r\nthat it is for States and regional fisheries management\r\norganizations, as appropriate, to regulate fisheries and\r\ntheir impact on vulnerable marine ecosystems and to\r\ntake decisions on any interim and long-term\r\nmanagement measures.\r\nIn the case of regional fisheries management\r\norganizations without such competence, their members\r\nare called upon to expand their competence, where\r\nappropriate, and in the case of high-seas areas not\r\ncovered by such organizations, relevant States are\r\ncalled upon to establish them, where necessary and\r\nappropriate.\r\nIceland, like many other coastal States, has for\r\nmany years been applying area restrictions and\r\nclosures as one of its fisheries management tools. The\r\nIcelandic authorities continue to work on protecting\r\nvulnerable marine ecosystems within their national\r\n29\r\nA/60/PV.54\r\njurisdiction. We are now in the process of closing five\r\nareas, covering a total of 80 square kilometres, to\r\nfishing with gear which adversely affects the seabed,\r\nwith the aim of protecting vulnerable cold-water\r\ncorals. We are working on the basis of scientific\r\ninformation, and we address the issue of protection on\r\na case-by-case basis. That approach ensures that we\r\ngive proper protection to the areas that need to be\r\nprotected, while not disrupting responsible fishing\r\npractices in other areas.\r\nAs the protection of vulnerable marine\r\necosystems is often presented as an issue on which the\r\nfisheries sector and environmental protection clash, it\r\nshould be pointed out that the approach followed in\r\nIceland makes such a clash unnecessary. Rather than\r\nimposing blanket closures of vast areas, we work with\r\nthe fisheries sector to determine which areas should be\r\nprotected. In fact, consultations with the fisheries\r\nsector have resulted in an increase in the size of the\r\nareas that are now being closed, compared to the\r\nsuggestions made in original proposals from our\r\nscientists.\r\nIceland is certainly not the only State that is\r\nprotecting vulnerable marine ecosystems within its\r\nnational jurisdiction; this is being done by many States\r\nall over the world. But this work is not being carried\r\nout only at the national level; regional fisheries\r\nmanagement organizations are also addressing this\r\nimportant issue.\r\nLast year, Iceland took part in establishing an\r\ninterim measure for the protection of vulnerable deep-\r\nwater habitats in the high seas of the North Atlantic\r\nocean. The North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission\r\n(NEAFC) agreed on an interim prohibition of fishing\r\nwith gear which adversely affects the seabed on a\r\nnumber of seamounts and in a section of the Reykjanes\r\nridge for a three-year period. During this interim\r\nperiod, NEAFC will assess its work on this issue, seek\r\nfurther scientific advice and assess possible\r\nenforcement issues that may arise, with the aim of\r\nhaving appropriate conservation and management\r\nmeasures in place by 2008. NEAFC has shown its\r\ncommitment to taking the necessary action to protect\r\nvulnerable habitats on case-by-case and scientific\r\nbases.\r\nAt NEAFC’s recent annual meeting, a proposal\r\nby Iceland to develop criteria and procedures within\r\nthe Commission for the protection of vulnerable areas,\r\nincluding area closures for certain types of fisheries,\r\nwas approved. The annual meeting furthermore\r\nrecommended that a performance review of NEAFC be\r\nestablished. The purpose of such a review is to provide\r\nfor a systematic check of the performance of the\r\nCommission and its consistency with the NEAFC\r\nConvention, the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement\r\nand other relevant international instruments.\r\nAssessment criteria and procedures for the\r\nperformance review, including terms of reference for\r\nthe review, will be developed, if appropriate, in\r\nconsultation with the Food and Agriculture\r\nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO) and other\r\nregional fisheries management organizations. This\r\nregional approach is in accordance with the draft\r\nfisheries resolution, which encourages States, through\r\ntheir participation in regional fisheries management\r\norganizations, to initiate processes for their\r\nperformance review.\r\nWe deem very important the meeting in February\r\nof the Ad Hoc Open-ended Informal Working Group to\r\nstudy issues relating to the conservation and\r\nsustainable use of marine biological diversity beyond\r\nareas of national jurisdiction. In our view, a major role\r\nof the meeting is to provide the General Assembly with\r\nan overview of the various issues falling under its\r\nbroad scope, described in omnibus resolution 59/24.\r\nThis is particularly relevant in the light of the fact that\r\nmany intergovernmental organizations and bodies are\r\ninvolved in work on these issues, resulting in some\r\noverlap. We look forward to a substantive, well-\r\ninformed and non-polemic discussion in February.\r\nAt its fifty-seventh session, the General\r\nAssembly decided to continue for three years the\r\nUnited Nations Open-ended Informal Consultative\r\nProcess on Oceans and the Law of the Sea. We would\r\nlike to thank the co-Chairmen of this period, Mr. Philip\r\nBurgess of Australia, Mr. Felipe Paolillo of Uruguay\r\nand Mr. Cristián Maquieira of Chile, for their valuable\r\ncontribution to the work of the Consultative Process.\r\nWe welcome the continuation of the Process for the\r\nnext three years on the same informal basis but note\r\nthe need to strengthen and improve its efficiency, as\r\nrecognized in the draft omnibus resolution. In our\r\nview, the meetings of the Consultative Process need to\r\nbe restructured in order to have more focused\r\ndiscussions and to give sufficient time for consultations\r\non the elements to be suggested to the Assembly. The\r\npreparatory meeting for the seventh meeting of the\r\n30\r\nA/60/PV.54\r\nConsultative Process provides a good opportunity in\r\nthat respect.\r\nDuring recent discussions on oceans issues, much\r\nattention has been devoted to integrative approaches,\r\nincluding an ecosystem approach to the management of\r\nthe marine environment. Iceland fully subscribes to\r\nsuch an approach, which forms the basis of our own\r\nmarine strategy, issued last year. Let me also take this\r\nopportunity to note in this context the European\r\nMarine Strategy, adopted by the European Commission\r\nlast month, which represents a significant contribution\r\nto our joint efforts to ensure the sustainable use of the\r\nworld’s oceans. The General Assembly recommends in\r\nits draft omnibus resolution that the Consultative\r\nProcess should, at its next meeting, focus its\r\ndiscussions on the topic “Ecosystem approaches and\r\noceans”. We look forward to a constructive and\r\ninformative discussion in June on the application of\r\necosystem approaches.\r\nIceland has actively encouraged an open\r\ndiscussion on marine pollution, an issue of\r\ninternational concern. It has long been recognized that\r\none of the most serious and extensive threats to the\r\nhealth of the marine ecosystem is pollution from land-\r\nbased sources.\r\nAs the implementation of the Global Programme\r\nof Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment\r\nfrom Land-based Activities has fallen short of\r\nexpectations, national or regional plans should play a\r\nleading role in redressing that issue. Only a few\r\ncountries have as yet adopted such plans, but a number\r\nof countries are in the final stages of adopting national\r\naction plans. However, more efforts are needed, and\r\nIceland strongly urges States that have not done so to\r\ndevelop their own plans of action, be it at the national\r\nor regional level, based on sound scientific advice.\r\nThe Second Intergovernmental Review of the\r\nGlobal Programme of Action will be held in Beijing\r\nnext year. This will be a valuable opportunity to review\r\nthe progress made, address future challenges and set\r\npriorities for the next five years.\r\nEfforts to strengthen international action to\r\nprotect the oceans from land-based pollution and other\r\nman-made threats have been hampered by the lack of\r\ninformation readily accessible to policy-makers on the\r\nstate of the marine environment. The lack of a\r\ncomprehensive overview is arguably one of the main\r\nreasons why measures to protect the marine\r\nenvironment have not been focusing on real priority\r\nissues. The decision in omnibus resolution 57/141 to\r\nestablish a regular process under the United Nations\r\nfor global reporting and assessment of the state of the\r\nmarine environment, including socio-economic\r\naspects, which is based on article 200 of the Law of the\r\nSea Convention, acknowledges that international action\r\nis needed to protect the marine environment from land-\r\nbased pollution and other human activity that causes\r\npollution or the physical degradation of the ocean.\r\nTwo years ago, in this very forum, Iceland drew\r\nattention to the relevance of the Arctic marine\r\nenvironment. The warming of the Arctic and the\r\ngrowing demand for the natural resources of the region\r\nare leading to a rapid increase in navigation in areas\r\npreviously considered inaccessible to commercial\r\nshipping. That trend calls for, among other things, a\r\nunified international approach to rights of navigation\r\nas well as cooperation on environmental issues,\r\nadaptation and emergency response.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.10 p.m.\r\n"
