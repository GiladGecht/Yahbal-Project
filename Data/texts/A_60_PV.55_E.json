(Sweden)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Hachani\r\n(Tunisia), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 75 (continued)\r\nOceans and the law of the sea\r\n(a) Oceans and the law of the sea\r\nReports of the Secretary-General (A/60/63 and\r\nAdd.1 and Add.2 and A/60/91)\r\nReport of the United Nations Open-ended\r\nInformal Consultative Process on Oceans and\r\nthe Law of the Sea at its sixth meeting (A/60/99)\r\nDraft resolution (A/60/L.22)\r\n(b) Sustainable fisheries, including through the\r\n1995 Agreement for the Implementation of the\r\nProvisions of the United Nations Convention on\r\nthe Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982\r\nrelating to the Conservation and Management\r\nof Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory\r\nFish Stocks, and related instruments\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/60/189)\r\nDraft resolution (A/60/L.23)\r\nMr. Ozawa (Japan): Today the number of States\r\nparties to the United Nations Convention on the Law of\r\nthe Sea is 149, and there are 122 States parties to the\r\nAgreement on the Implementation of Part XI of the\r\nConvention. We are pleased to see that these numbers\r\nare growing and that the Convention is coming to be\r\nwidely accepted by the international community. Japan\r\nbelieves that the role of the Convention is becoming\r\nincreasingly important as the international community\r\nfaces a range of new issues, including the increase in\r\ntransnational crimes such as terrorism, piracy and\r\nillegal trafficking in drugs, and the growing pressures\r\non the marine environment. Each of these new issues\r\nneeds to be addressed in a manner that respects the\r\nspirit and provisions of the Convention.\r\nJapan, a seafaring nation with a vast exclusive\r\neconomic zone and continental shelf, is committed to\r\nthe United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea\r\nand to the organs established under it, namely, the\r\nInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, the\r\nInternational Seabed Authority and the Commission on\r\nthe Limits of the Continental Shelf. As the largest\r\ncontributor, we have actively participated in the work\r\nof those organs and intend to contribute further to their\r\nactivities.\r\nWith regard to the Tribunal, Japan attaches great\r\nimportance to its role in the maintenance of order and\r\nstability with respect to the ocean. Japan is willing to\r\nwork steadily to establish and strengthen the rule of\r\nlaw and the principle of the peaceful settlement of\r\nconflicts through support for the Tribunal’s activities.\r\n2\r\nA/60/PV.55\r\nWith regard to the Commission on the Limits of\r\nthe Continental Shelf, the omnibus draft resolution\r\nrecognizes how important it is for States to exchange\r\nviews in order to facilitate the preparation of\r\nsubmissions to the Commission. To that end, Japan, in\r\ncooperation with the United Nations University, is\r\nplanning to host a symposium on scientific and\r\ntechnical aspects of the establishment of the outer\r\nlimits of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical\r\nmiles, to be held in Tokyo from 6 to 7 March 2006. We\r\nhope that many States will be able to participate in that\r\nsymposium.\r\nThe world continues to be plagued by threats of\r\npiracy and armed robbery at sea. We may recall the\r\nhijacking of a World Food Programme ship carrying\r\nfood assistance in the waters off the coast of Somalia\r\nin June this year. Last year, there were more than 300\r\nincidents of piracy around the world, nearly half of\r\nwhich occurred in Asia.\r\nJapan is pleased to note that the Regional\r\nCooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and\r\nArmed Robbery against Ships in Asia was adopted in\r\nTokyo last November after active negotiations that\r\nlasted more than three years. Japan took the initiative\r\nin proposing that agreement, believing that it would\r\nstrengthen regional cooperation among maritime\r\nsecurity organizations to establish an information-\r\nsharing system and a cooperative network dedicated to\r\ncombating piracy and armed robbery at sea. Japan,\r\nwhich signed that Agreement in April this year, hopes\r\nit will not only contribute to enhanced cooperation\r\namong States parties in Asia but will also serve as a\r\nmodel of regional cooperation.\r\nAllow me to speak on the subject of the marine\r\nenvironment. Surrounded by the sea, Japan considers\r\nthe preservation of the marine environment to be\r\nextremely important. The issue of marine debris in\r\nparticular is an urgent matter, as noted in the omnibus\r\ndraft resolution. The problem should be tackled at\r\nvarious levels. At the regional level, Japan is\r\nconsidering making use of the framework of the\r\nNorthwest Pacific Action Plan.\r\nAs a responsible fishing State and a State party to\r\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea,\r\nJapan is earnest about addressing conservation and\r\nmanagement problems, as well as sustainable use\r\nissues related to living marine resources, including\r\nstraddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks.\r\nThose efforts have been implemented individually,\r\nbilaterally and multilaterally.\r\nJapan is seriously concerned about illegal,\r\nunreported and unregulated (IUU) fishery activities and\r\nissues related to the overcapacity of global fisheries,\r\nwhich are becoming increasingly serious despite the\r\nefforts being made to promote the sustainable use of\r\nliving marine resources. My Government has shown\r\nthat it is committed to eliminating IUU fishing in order\r\nto conserve the marine ecosystem.\r\nIn that regard, we would like to stress once again\r\nthe importance of basing our discussions of the issues\r\nof conservation and management and of the sustainable\r\nuse of living marine resources on scientific evidence\r\nprovided by competent organizations such as the Food\r\nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\r\nand the regional fisheries management organizations.\r\nWe believe that regional organizations have the\r\nrequired specialized expertise to provide accurate\r\nassessments and thus offer a better forum than the\r\nUnited Nations for such discussions.\r\nIn our view, operative paragraph 46 of the omnibus\r\ndraft resolution on oceans and the law of the sea\r\n(A/60/L.22), which deals with the transport of radioactive\r\nmaterials, unfortunately does not reflect the spirit or\r\nthe substance of the series of thorough discussions on\r\nthis issue conducted by the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency and relevant organizations. Although\r\nJapan will not make an objection on that point, we do\r\nwish to express our dissatisfaction on that matter.\r\nIn concluding, I wish to reaffirm that Japan will\r\ncontinue to contribute to the stability of the legal\r\nframework on ocean affairs and, by so doing, promote\r\nprudent and equitable use of the sea by the\r\ninternational community, in accordance with the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea.\r\nMr. Panggabean (Indonesia): At the outset, I\r\nthank the Secretary-General for his comprehensive\r\nreports on oceans and the law of the sea and on\r\nsustainable fisheries.\r\nWe are all aware that management of our oceans\r\nis a complex and multidimensional undertaking, which\r\nwill become ever more complex as technological\r\nprogress opens the door to further exploration of the\r\npotential benefits of the ocean.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General on oceans\r\nand the law of the sea demonstrates that there is more\r\n3\r\nA/60/PV.55\r\nto the sea than the exploitation of traditional natural\r\nresources such as fisheries, oil and gas. The sea offers\r\nother economically valuable benefits to be exploited,\r\nsuch as genetic and biological resources.\r\nThat presents us with the challenge of ensuring\r\nthe availability of those resources in the long run.\r\nAlready, related issues have emerged, ranging from\r\nprotecting the environment to sharing the benefits. In\r\nmy delegation’s view, the problems have to be\r\napproached in a holistic manner, taking social,\r\neconomic and environmental aspects into account in\r\norder to ensure the sustainable use of the oceans for\r\nfuture generations.\r\nAll that was not entirely anticipated when the\r\nConvention was concluded in 1982. However, my\r\ndelegation reaffirms Indonesia’s conviction that the\r\nConvention serves as the main international instrument\r\non ocean affairs for governing all activities relating to the\r\nuse and the utilization of the oceans. The draft resolution\r\nunder consideration reflects that acknowledgement by\r\nreaffirming our commitment to preserving the\r\nConvention’s integrity. In the light of that\r\nconsideration, my delegation is pleased to learn of the\r\nprogress made by various institutions in the field in\r\ntheir efforts to meet the objectives of the Convention.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the progress made by\r\nthe Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf\r\nin considering the submissions of several coastal\r\nStates. We also commend the initiative of the Division\r\nfor Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea of convening\r\na series of workshops in various regions to disseminate\r\nmanuals and technical guidelines for delineation of the\r\nouter limits of the continental shelf of coastal States.\r\nThe workshops made a valuable contribution, in\r\nparticular by assisting developing countries to prepare\r\ntheir submissions and thus meet the time frame\r\ndesignated by the Commission.\r\nWe also attach great importance to the work of\r\nthe International Seabed Authority. My delegation is\r\npleased at the progress that has been achieved so far in\r\nthe management of the resources of the seabed area\r\nbeyond national jurisdiction. Its decision last August to\r\nprovide modalities for the participation of experts from\r\ndeveloping countries in research activities carried out\r\nin the Area by the pioneer investors is, indeed,\r\nconsistent with the objectives of technology transfer\r\nand sharing the benefits of the ocean as the common\r\nheritage of mankind.\r\nIn addition to providing details relating to the\r\nnew utilization of sea resources, the report also\r\nindicates persistent threats to commercial vessels. Acts\r\nof piracy and armed robbery at sea are still a major\r\nproblem in many parts of the world. The situation\r\npresents a challenge to the international community,\r\nwhich must find effective means to combat that\r\nmenace. Some analysts have gone further by linking\r\nterrorists and sea robbers, arguing that they could join\r\nforces and together wreak havoc in vital straits used for\r\ninternational navigation.\r\nMy delegation is fully aware that the safety of\r\nnavigation in such straits is a key and vital element in\r\npromoting foreign trade. We are also fully aware of\r\nconcerns about the seriousness of threats to maritime\r\nsecurity brought to light by reports relating to terrorist\r\nnetworks and individual terrorists linked to Al-Qaida.\r\nTerrorists and sea robbers should be taken seriously as\r\na matter of security. However, my delegation is of the\r\nview that we should not take an alarmist approach, as\r\nthat would inadvertently encourage the terrorists.\r\nWhile acknowledging the important war against\r\nterrorist acts in all their forms and manifestations, we\r\nshould not lose sight of the importance of upholding\r\nthe rule of law in conformity with international law.\r\nOnly by means of concerted multilateral efforts can\r\nStates effectively combat terrorism. As a result, the\r\ninternational community should respect the primary\r\nresponsibility and sovereign right of littoral States in\r\ntheir efforts to ensure the safety of navigation and\r\nmaritime security in the area.\r\nIn that connection, Indonesia, together with\r\nMalaysia and Singapore, has intensified its cooperation\r\nthrough the Tripartite Technical Expert Group on the\r\nsafety of navigation. Our most recent meeting, which\r\ntook place in Batam, Indonesia, in August, produced an\r\nunderstanding whereby we recognized the importance\r\nof and welcomed closer collaboration with the\r\ninternational community.\r\nIn the context of their collaboration with the\r\nInternational Maritime Organization (IMO), the three\r\ncountries further engaged in broader consultation and\r\ndialogue with other interested States and major shipping\r\nindustry actors at a meeting in Jakarta on 7 September\r\n2005. The conclusions of that meeting are contained in\r\ndocument A/60/529, and my delegation is pleased to\r\nshare them with members. In the context of\r\nstrengthening the safety of navigation and maritime\r\n4\r\nA/60/PV.55\r\nsecurity in the area, we further commend the assistance\r\nof the IMO in facilitating the Marine Electronic Highway\r\nproject for the Straits of Malacca and Singapore.\r\nIn view of the importance of fisheries for our\r\neconomy, Indonesia welcomes the fact that the review\r\nconference of the 1995 Fish Stocks Agreement will be\r\nheld next year. In connection with that review, the\r\nrelated draft resolution invites all States to participate\r\non an equal footing in a preparatory meeting to be held\r\nearly next year.\r\nThe Agreement provides a framework for the\r\nconservation and management of fish stocks in the high\r\nseas. To that end, it obliges States to practise caution\r\nwhen managing fish stocks and their ecosystems, as\r\nwell as to minimize activities that are harmful to the\r\noceans. However, noting the lack of State participation\r\nin the Agreement, my delegation is of the view that the\r\nreview should be directed at identifying the\r\nimpediments to States’ accession to it.\r\nWe believe that strengthening international\r\nfisheries governance by filling existing gaps in the\r\nAgreement should not be conducted in such a way as to\r\ndiscourage States from joining the Agreement. It would\r\nbe helpful to reflect on paragraph 12 of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report (A/60/189), which indicates that\r\narticle 21 of the Agreement has never been applied\r\nsensu stricto. We look forward to a discussion on the\r\nmatter next year.\r\nIndonesia is fully aware of the importance of\r\ncontinued efforts by the international community to\r\nfind a constructive approach to addressing various\r\nissues relating to ocean affairs and the law of the sea. It\r\nis therefore a distinct pleasure for my delegation to co-\r\nsponsor draft resolution A/60/L.22 on oceans and the\r\nlaw of the sea.\r\nBefore concluding, my delegation wishes to\r\nexpress its appreciation to coordinators Mr. Marcos\r\nAlmeida of Brazil and Ms. Holly Koehler of the United\r\nStates, as well as to the countries that contributed to\r\nthe consultations in a spirit of cooperation. It is our\r\nsincere hope that all Member States will support the\r\ndraft resolution.\r\nMs. Ridgeway (Canada): Canada is pleased to\r\noffer its perspectives on the challenges relating to this\r\nimportant agenda item.\r\nThe commitments manifested in the action-\r\noriented draft resolutions on sustainable fisheries and\r\non the law of the sea, which Canada is pleased to co-\r\nsponsor, come at a critical and complex time for\r\nfisheries and for the law of the sea. The need for\r\nconcrete, concerted and coherent actions that live up to\r\nour commitments relating to the conservation and\r\nsustainable use of oceans and their resources has never\r\nbeen so pressing.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nCanada, which has coastline on three oceans —the\r\nlongest coastline in the world — has a significant stake in\r\nensuring success. Our history and trade are inextricably\r\nlinked with the sea. Our oceans and their resources\r\nprovide a foundation for our coastal communities and\r\nplay a key role in our identity as Canadians.\r\nCurrent statistics on the state of the world’s\r\nfisheries and various reports setting out the threats to\r\noceans resources and biodiversity are well known. The\r\nincreased vulnerability of the oceans and their\r\nresources is a reality that has mobilized attention from\r\nvarious perspectives — citizens, communities, those\r\nwho rely on such resources for their livelihoods,\r\ninternational organizations, academia and civil society.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nWe have committed ourselves to addressing those\r\nrisks, including at the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment. However, many of those commitments\r\nremain elusive owing to lack of capacity and tools, and\r\neven lack of agreement on future steps, which could\r\nappear as lack of international resolve to move forward\r\ndecisively.\r\nIndeed, the very complexity of legal and other\r\ninstruments, management measures and forums dealing\r\nwith oceans issues makes it difficult to find coherent,\r\ncooperative and practical approaches that can garner\r\nboth domestic and international consensus.\r\nAn integrated, transparent, adaptive and\r\nenforceable regulatory framework is essential for\r\nfisheries and oceans sustainability and that of its\r\nindustries. The challenge is whether we can pull\r\ntogether the threads of fisheries and oceans\r\nconservation issues and create an agenda that\r\nconverges and plays to strengths coherently, rather than\r\none that diverges and fragments.\r\nWe will have an unprecedented opportunity for\r\nunited action for improvement if the international\r\ncommunity can unite its strengths.\r\n5\r\nA/60/PV.55\r\nLet us take the case of fisheries.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThis year has marked an important turning point\r\nin the momentum for change. We must capture that\r\nmomentum and build upon it. Millions of people\r\nworldwide depend on fisheries for work and millions\r\nmore depend on them for food. But overfishing is\r\ntaking a socio-economic and environmental toll.\r\nCombating overfishing is a top priority for\r\nCanada and for our Prime Minister, who has spoken\r\nabout the issue repeatedly at international conferences\r\nand bilateral meetings. But there can be no success in\r\nthat challenge without international cooperation.\r\nCanada is ready to play its role to help find solutions.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nThe international community has developed a\r\nseries of both legally binding and voluntary tools\r\ndealing with fisheries and oceans management. The\r\nUnited Nations Fish Stocks Agreement, in particular,\r\nneeds many more States parties in order to become the\r\nuniversal instrument that it is intended to be.\r\nThe world now needs to move from words to\r\naction so as better to use such instruments by fully\r\nimplementing their obligations. Canada looks forward\r\nto the 2006 review conference of the United Nations\r\nFish Stocks Agreement, which will examine the\r\nprogress made so far and point the way towards even\r\nmore effective implementation.\r\nThere has been an encouraging convergence of\r\nviews and momentum aimed at ensuring that\r\noverfishing and illegal fishing are not tolerated, either\r\ndomestically or on the high seas, and at ensuring that\r\nregional cooperation to manage high seas fisheries is a\r\nstrong part of the broader oceans governance agenda.\r\nSeveral events should be highlighted. The United\r\nNations Food and Agriculture Organization’s March\r\n2005 Rome Ministerial Declaration on illegal,\r\nunreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing provides a\r\nglobal commitment to action. The Conference on the\r\nGovernance of High Seas Fisheries and the United\r\nNations Fish Stocks Agreement, hosted by Canada in\r\nMay 2005, and the resulting St. John’s Declaration\r\nsigned by 19 Ministers or their designates constitute an\r\nimportant political commitment to international\r\ncooperation in the reform of fisheries governance. The\r\nsecond Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Oceans-\r\nRelated Ministerial Meeting in Bali, the Joint\r\nMinisterial Statement and the Bali Plan of Action set\r\nout a broad regional oceans strategy, including specific\r\npriorities for action to address the threats of IUU\r\nfishing. The continuing work of the ministerial High\r\nSeas Task Force on IUU Fishing, joined by Canada, the\r\nUnited Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Chile and\r\nNamibia, will soon recommend practical ways of\r\naddressing IUU fishing for which we will seek a\r\nbroader coalition of support to take that approach\r\nforward and make it a global reality.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nBut action to prevent overfishing, including the\r\nhard choices that will make those commitments real,\r\nstarts at home. A coalition of support for national,\r\nregional and global change is needed. That coalition\r\nmust also ensure that domestic overdependence and\r\novercapacity do not create unreasonable pressures that\r\nthreaten international cooperation.\r\nDomestically, Canada is building a strategy to\r\nimprove international cooperation in the fight on high\r\nseas overfishing. The strategy is built on vigilant\r\nmonitoring and surveillance to increase compliance on\r\nthe high seas, a diplomatic and advocacy strategy to\r\ncreate the conditions for change, and commitment and\r\ncapacity to work internationally for improved\r\ninternational fisheries and oceans governance.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nIn that effort, it is critical to develop country\r\ncapacity for fisheries and oceans management. Canada\r\nhas announced a contribution of 500,000 Canadian\r\ndollars under Part VII of the United Nations Fish\r\nStocks Agreement to help in that respect.\r\nBut the challenge for fisheries governance is not\r\njust to fix the problems of fishery but to ensure that it\r\nbecomes a reliable part of the foundation for integrated\r\nprotection, use and governance of oceans more broadly.\r\nCanada’s commitment to modern oceans\r\nmanagement is reflected in our Oceans Action Plan\r\nreleased in May 2005. Its basis is integrated oceans\r\nplanning, founded on an ecosystem approach to\r\nmanagement. Large Oceans Management Areas\r\nprovide the integrating framework, and that will\r\ninclude fisheries management renewal.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\n6\r\nA/60/PV.55\r\nThe Plan also recognizes that some marine\r\nenvironments and the resources they hold need special\r\nprotection and management. Many instruments are\r\navailable to provide special protection, including marine\r\nprotected areas. Canada has announced a strategy for a\r\nfederal network of marine protected areas in all three\r\nof our oceans. Last month, Canada designated three\r\nnew marine protected areas, bringing the total to five.\r\nThose areas protect diverse sensitive areas and\r\nelements that range from the Endeavour hydrothermal\r\nvents off our Pacific coast to a unique strain of Irish\r\nmoss and its habitat, Basin Head, in the Atlantic.\r\nThe lessons we and other participants have\r\nlearned from those domestic efforts help us understand\r\nthe challenges of the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment commitment to establish an international\r\nnetwork of marine protected areas. For its part, Canada\r\nwill soon host a workshop of international experts to\r\ndiscuss criteria in use to define ecologically and\r\nbiologically significant areas, which we hope will be\r\nuseful to the ongoing international debate.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nWe are looking forward to a successful meeting\r\nof the Ad Hoc Open-ended Informal Working Group on\r\nbiodiversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction,\r\nwhich we hope will improve our collective knowledge\r\non the issue of high seas biodiversity. The management\r\nof the agenda, in all its facets, is a challenge for States,\r\ninternational organizations and other participants. We\r\nneed a constructive debate that will help define the\r\noptions we face in protecting high seas biodiversity.\r\nThe implementation of an ecosystem approach to\r\nmanagement is a complex task. In fact, it is a challenging\r\nconcept for both developed and developing countries.\r\nCanada will be pleased to offer its perspective and\r\nexperience with States and others at the 2006 meeting of\r\nthe United Nations Open-ended Informal Consultative\r\nProcess on Oceans and the Law of the Sea, which will\r\naddress ecosystem approaches and oceans.\r\nCanada values that inclusive informal process,\r\nwhich engages open discussions on such issues, and we\r\nare pleased to see it continue. It helps us to understand\r\npossible joint solutions and the current discussion and\r\nto identify in which areas additional understanding and\r\nmechanisms are needed. That complicated topic\r\nrequires a well-managed debate and a clear delineation\r\nof the steps that will help us understand how to make\r\necosystem approaches a reality.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThe themes in the draft resolutions reflect a\r\ncollective, multidimensional and multidisciplinary\r\nagenda that must value balanced and reasoned\r\napproaches.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nCanada’s vision includes a strong understanding\r\nof fisheries and oceans, modernized and credible\r\ndomestic and international fisheries governance, a\r\nlinking-up of the domestic and international oceans\r\nagenda to all key players and mechanisms and the\r\nunderstanding that all involved will take up their roles\r\nwith determination. Many of the mechanisms are\r\nnothing more than the sum of the political will and the\r\ncapacities of States players. Canada is committed to\r\nhelping in that endeavour.\r\nMr. Ngunjiri (Kenya): At the outset, I express\r\nmy delegation’s appreciation to the Secretary-General\r\nfor the comprehensive reports on this item, which\r\ncontain developments relating to implementation of the\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\r\n(UNCLOS). Those documents provide a solid basis for\r\ntoday’s discussion.\r\nMy statement will focus on three issues that are of\r\nmajor concern to Kenya — namely, capacity building,\r\nmarine safety and security, and the marine environment.\r\nThe lack of adequate capacity in many\r\ndeveloping countries is a serious impediment to the\r\nimplementation of the Convention and its related\r\nagreements. The Convention acknowledges this\r\nproblem and emphasizes the need to build capacity and\r\nprovide technical assistance to developing countries,\r\nespecially in areas such as marine scientific research,\r\ntransfer of technology, activities in the Area and\r\npreservation of the marine environment.\r\nMy delegation notes with gratitude that the\r\nDivision for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea has\r\ncontinued to play a lead role in capacity-building\r\ninitiatives targeting developing countries. These\r\ninitiatives have contributed and continue to contribute\r\nsignificantly to the ability of developing States to meet\r\ntheir obligations under the Convention through\r\nenhancement of knowledge and skills in ocean affairs\r\nand the law of the sea. I refer specifically to the United\r\nNations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR)\r\nbriefings on development in ocean affairs and the law\r\nof the sea; the Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe\r\n7\r\nA/60/PV.55\r\nMemorial Fellowship Programme; the TRAIN-SEA-\r\nCOAST programme; and the Nippon Foundation\r\nsupported programme, for which we are grateful to the\r\nFoundation.\r\nThe series of training courses aimed at promoting\r\ncompliance with article 76 of the Convention have\r\nbeen particularly useful to developing States, which\r\nlack the capacity to undertake the complex delineation\r\nexercise envisaged under article 76. Experts from my\r\ncountry participated in the course for the Indian Ocean\r\nregion, held in Sri Lanka from 16 to 20 May 2005. The\r\ncourse, together with the comprehensive manual\r\ndeveloped by the Division on preparation of\r\nsubmissions to the Commission on the Limits of the\r\nContinental Shelf, has helped our experts to obtain a\r\nbetter understanding of the full procedures for the\r\npreparation of submissions. This will no doubt help\r\nspeed up the preparation of our submissions.\r\nWe urge that these initiatives be sustained\r\nthrough, inter alia, increased voluntary contributions to\r\nthe trust funds established under the Convention. In\r\nparticular, we call for further strengthening of regional\r\nand subregional scientific research capacities in\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nMaritime security and crimes at sea are an\r\nimportant element in the management of our oceans.\r\nMy delegation notes with concern the frequent\r\noccurrence of incidents of piracy and armed robbery at\r\nsea, as reported in paragraph 95 of the report of the\r\nSecretary-General (A/60/63). This is an indication that\r\nthe measures currently in place are far from adequate.\r\nWe recognize the ongoing efforts by the International\r\nMaritime Organization to coordinate international\r\nefforts to eradicate these crimes. However, we urge that\r\nmore focus be given to high-risk regions, especially in\r\nareas where national Governments lack the capacity to\r\neffectively patrol and provide security in their\r\nterritorial waters. The Eastern African coast, for\r\ninstance, has in the recent past experienced a series of\r\narmed attacks, particularly in the waters adjacent to\r\nSomalia. This year alone, it has been reported that\r\nabout 23 hijackings and attempted seizures have been\r\nrecorded off the Somali coast, including two ships\r\ncarrying aid for the United Nations World Food\r\nProgramme. A number of ships destined for my\r\ncountry have also been targets of attacks in the last few\r\nmonths. These attacks have had very grave\r\nramifications on our tourism industry and other\r\neconomic activities, since some ships that were\r\noriginally destined for the port of Mombasa have opted\r\nto divert to other destinations for fear of attacks.\r\nDeveloping coastal States need support in\r\nenhancing their control measures in order to effectively\r\ncombat the use of maritime transport by illicit\r\ntraffickers of narcotic drugs and psychotropic\r\nsubstances. We, therefore, welcome the recent\r\ninitiative by the United Nations Office on Drugs and\r\nCrime to support States’ control measures in\r\ndeveloping countries, through the provision of\r\nequipment and training to target illicit trafficking via\r\nmaritime freight containers. We hope that the pilot\r\nprogramme in Ecuador and Senegal will be replicated\r\nin other coastal developing States.\r\nMy delegation attaches great significance to the\r\nmarine environment and supports the implementation\r\nof Part XII of the Convention, which deals with the\r\nprotection and preservation of the marine environment\r\nand resources from pollution and physical degradation.\r\nWithin our coastal and marine areas, we have\r\nestablished national marine parks and reserves in order\r\nto enhance protection and conservation of the diverse\r\nand highly productive ecosystems therein. We have\r\nrecently amended our Merchants’ Shipping Act, with a\r\nview to reducing marine pollution from marine\r\ntransport activities and dumping. Kenya is also actively\r\ninvolved in the Eastern Africa Regional Seas\r\nProgramme and the Global Programme of Action for\r\nthe Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-\r\nBased Activities, and is the coordinator of the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development coastal and\r\nmarine thematic area.\r\nThree years ago, the World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development agreed to establish a regular\r\nprocess under the United Nations for global reporting\r\nand assessment of the state of the marine environment.\r\nMy delegation notes with satisfaction the progress that\r\nhas been made towards this end and welcomes the\r\nconclusions of the second international workshop on\r\nthe regular process for global reporting and assessment\r\nof the state of the marine environment. We endorse the\r\nlaunch of the start-up phase of the “assessment of\r\nassessments” as a preparatory stage towards the\r\nestablishment of the regular process. We also endorse the\r\nestablishment of an organizational structure that includes\r\nan ad hoc steering group to oversee the “assessment of\r\nassessments”. We urge that the membership of the ad\r\nhoc steering group should take into account the need\r\nfor balanced geographical representation.\r\n8\r\nA/60/PV.55\r\nFishery resources contribute greatly to food\r\nsecurity, poverty alleviation and the economic well-\r\nbeing of many countries. My delegation reiterates its\r\nprevious call for enhanced international cooperation in\r\nensuring sustainable exploitation of these resources\r\nthrough enforcement of measures to prevent\r\ndestructive fishing practices.\r\nHowever, we see the urgent need for capacity-\r\nbuilding, including the transfer of marine technology,\r\nto assist developing countries to meet their obligations\r\nand exercise their rights under international\r\ninstruments, in order to realize tangible benefits from\r\nfisheries resources. In this regard, my delegation notes\r\nwith satisfaction that the Assistance Fund under Part\r\nVII of the Agreement has began to operate and to\r\nconsider applications for assistance from developing\r\nStates parties. We urge States and international\r\nfinancial institutions that are in a position to do so to\r\nmake voluntary contributions to the fund.\r\nMy delegation also appreciates the work of the\r\nFood and Agriculture Organization, particularly for\r\ndeveloping guidance on the strategies and measures\r\nrequired for the creation of an enabling environment\r\nfor small-scale fisheries. No doubt many developing\r\ncountries, including my own, will find the document\r\nuseful in developing our fishing industries in a manner\r\nconsistent with the relevant international instruments.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to emphasize my country’s\r\ncommitment to the United Nations Convention on the\r\nLaw of the Sea, which sets out the legal framework\r\nwithin which all activities in the oceans and seas must\r\nbe carried out. We believe that the Convention\r\ncontinues to contribute significantly to the\r\nstrengthening of peace, security, cooperation and\r\nfriendly relations among nations and the economic and\r\nsocial advancement of all peoples of the world.\r\nMs. Monteiro (Palau): Palau aligns itself with\r\nthe statement made by Papua New Guinea at the 54th\r\nmeeting on behalf of the Pacific Islands Forum.\r\nPalau would like to offer its congratulations to all\r\nwho worked so hard to negotiate the draft resolutions\r\nbefore us today. We are pleased to support both draft\r\nresolutions and to be a sponsor of draft resolution\r\nA/60/L.23, on sustainable fisheries.\r\nThe vitally rich biodiversity of the sea bottom is\r\nthe common heritage of all people and must be\r\nprotected by all Member States. Last year, delegations\r\npledged to undertake a review of destructive fishing\r\npractices, including bottom trawling, and to take urgent\r\naction where regulations are inadequate.\r\nDuring the negotiations this year, Palau called for\r\nan interim prohibition on unregulated bottom trawling,\r\nas there is currently no effective mechanism for\r\nensuring the sustainability of marine living resources\r\nin the high seas. In making this proposal it was our\r\nhope to continue the dialogue on combating destructive\r\nfishing practices. While an interim ban was not agreed\r\nto, we were pleased to see the insertion of language\r\ncalling for a strengthened and more definite review\r\nprocess. This will ensure that meaningful examination\r\nand appropriate precautionary action can be taken over\r\nthe next year.\r\nOdious fishing practices are of particular concern\r\nto the small island States of the Pacific Ocean. As\r\nPalau’s President Remengesau recently stated,\r\n“For Palau, the environment is our economic\r\nfuture. We have no higher issue on our agenda\r\nthan the preservation of our natural resources.\r\nBecause of this, we recognize that a delicate\r\nbalance must be struck between growth and\r\nconservation”.\r\nAt the Pacific Islands Forum leaders meeting held\r\nthis October in Papua New Guinea, our leaders agreed\r\nthat the damage from bottom trawling is of serious\r\nconcern and renewed their determination to develop an\r\nappropriate framework for addressing the issue over\r\nthe next year.\r\nThe sustainable fisheries draft resolution stands\r\nas an undertaking by the international community to\r\nreview the impact of fishing activity on marine bed\r\necosystems. The critical factor now is to ensure that the\r\nreview process is thorough and prepares us well for\r\nnext year’s negotiations. We take this opportunity to\r\ncommend the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law\r\nof the Sea for undertaking this important review and\r\ntrust it will be comprehensive. However, Palau must\r\nnote with concern that, while we wait for this review to\r\ntake place, precious marine life and seamounts\r\ncontinue to be vulnerable to destructive fishing\r\npractices.\r\nLike the other sponsors of the draft resolution, as\r\nwell as those delegations participating in its\r\nnegotiation, we are looking forward to the upcoming\r\nsession of the United Nations Open-ended Informal\r\n9\r\nA/60/PV.55\r\nConsultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the Sea\r\nand to it fulfilling its ambitious agenda. We also invite\r\nthe States parties to respond in a detailed manner to the\r\nrequest from the Division for Ocean Affairs for\r\ninformation so that its stand-alone report on destructive\r\nfishing practices can be as useful and comprehensive as\r\npossible.\r\nPalau will continue to raise the issue of a\r\nprohibition on deep sea bottom trawling at all\r\ninternational forums until the legal infrastructure is in\r\nplace to deal with that destructive practice. We look\r\nforward to working constructively with the\r\ninternational community to address this urgent issue\r\nand to meet our shared promise to achieve\r\nsustainability in the oceans.\r\nMr. Kryzhanivsky (Ukraine): My delegation\r\naligns itself with the statement delivered by the United\r\nKingdom on behalf of the European Union. Allow me\r\nto draw your attention to additional issues that are\r\nimportant to my country.\r\nUkraine is firmly committed to the United\r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which\r\nrepresents a significant achievement by the\r\ninternational community and is important testimony to\r\nUnited Nations efforts to codify and develop the\r\ninternational law of the sea. This Convention is not\r\nonly a charter within which all activities related to\r\noceans and seas should be carried out; it is also a basis\r\nfor a comprehensive system of economic and political\r\ncooperation in marine-related matters.\r\nMy country had attached great importance to\r\nfisheries issues even before Ukraine became a party to the\r\nFish Stocks Agreement. Ukrainian legislation on fisheries\r\nwas developed on the basis of provisions and principles\r\nof the Agreement. After the Verkhovna Rada — the\r\nparliament of Ukraine — passed the Law on Accession\r\nto the 1995 Agreement, additional practical steps to\r\nimplement the provisions of the Fish Stocks Agreement\r\nare now being taken. These include, in particular, the\r\nadoption of a number of normative legal documents\r\ndesigned to enhance the role of the State in conducting\r\nocean fishing and increasing the responsibility of\r\nvessel owners.\r\nOver-exploitation of living marine resources\r\nthrough excessive fishing continues to be of grave\r\nconcern to the international community. As a\r\ngeographically disadvantaged country bordering a sea\r\nwhich is poor in living resources and suffering from\r\nthe depletion of fish stocks from its exclusive\r\neconomic zone, Ukraine places special emphasis on the\r\nproblem of illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing.\r\nWe strongly believe that all States should apply\r\neffective measures for the conservation, management\r\nand exploitation of fish stocks in order to protect living\r\nmarine resources and preserve the marine environment.\r\nBetter international cooperation in this sphere is\r\nneeded, and the crucial role here belongs to the\r\nrelevant regional organizations. It is important that\r\nregional fisheries enhance their cooperation with a\r\nlarger number of States, in particular with high-seas\r\nfishing States and geographically disadvantaged States.\r\nThe international legal framework within which\r\ncommercial vessels flying Ukraine’s flag can fish on\r\nthe high seas consists of the 1982 United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea, the Fish Stocks\r\nAgreement and the 1980 Convention on the\r\nConservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources. In\r\naddition, our State participates in the International\r\nCommission for the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries and\r\nin the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization.\r\nAfter joining the Food and Agriculture\r\nOrganization (FAO), Ukraine affirmed its adherence to\r\nmodern standards of sea fishing by accepting a long list\r\nof voluntary obligations, including codes and action\r\nplans elaborated by FAO to ensure the sustainable use\r\nof marine resources.\r\nIn 2002 Ukraine adopted a law on its national\r\nprogramme “On the building of fishing vessels”, for\r\n2002-2010. The year 2003 saw the adoption of the\r\nnational programme for the development of the fishing\r\nindustry in Ukraine up to 2010. The national bill on\r\nfishing has been elaborated and is now being\r\nconsidered by the Parliament of Ukraine.\r\nSubordinate legislation regulating fishing on the\r\nhigh seas under the Ukrainian flag is currently being\r\ndeveloped. Such legislation is aimed at regulating the\r\nactivities of the Ukrainian fishing fleet and includes a\r\nlist of commitments and priority actions for users.\r\nUkrainian delegations participate in the work of\r\nthe various bodies of the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries\r\nOrganization and of the North East Atlantic Fisheries\r\nCommission, advocating the obligatory presence of\r\nscientific observers on all marine vessels and in all\r\nfields of commercial fishing in the spheres of activity\r\nof those organizations. The State Department of\r\n10\r\nA/60/PV.55\r\nFisheries has recently undertaken voluntary\r\ncommitments relating to numerous standards for the\r\nexploitation and preservation of marine living\r\nresources. Those commitments include the Code of\r\nConduct for Responsible Fisheries; the international\r\nplan of action for reducing incidental catch of seabirds\r\nin longline fisheries; the international plan of action for\r\nthe conservation and management of sharks; and the\r\ninternational plan of action to prevent, deter and\r\neliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.\r\nWith respect to the problem of stock management\r\nand fishing, we would like to emphasize the need to\r\nintroduce stricter measures to limit the level of\r\nexploitation of most stocks. At present there is no\r\nuniversal approach to determining biological criteria\r\nfor an admissible level of stock exploitation.\r\nWe would emphasize the need to ensure effective\r\ncoordination and cooperation in the process of\r\nintegrated ocean management so as to promote\r\nsustainable fisheries, enhance maritime safety and\r\nprotect the marine environment from pollution.\r\nThe institutions established within the framework\r\nof the Convention are essential components of the\r\nglobal regime that provides for the rule of law and the\r\nmaintenance of peace and security in the oceans.\r\nWe note with satisfaction the effective\r\nfunctioning of the International Seabed Authority. It is\r\nimportant that the Authority, while examining the\r\nreports submitted by contractors, continue the\r\nelaboration of rules, regulations and procedures to\r\nensure the effective protection of the marine\r\nenvironment and the conservation of the natural\r\nresources of the Area.\r\nWe would underline once again the crucial role\r\nplayed by the International Tribunal for the Law of the\r\nSea in the process of the interpretation and\r\nimplementation of the 1982 Convention and the\r\nAgreement. Since the Tribunal handed down its first\r\njudgement, it has considered 11 cases, and we hope\r\nthat it will register new achievements in future.\r\nIn concluding my statement, I would like to\r\nconvey Ukraine’s appreciation to the Secretary-General\r\nfor both the quality and scope of the report, which\r\nitself is a powerful tool for facilitating international\r\ncooperation and coordination. The activities of the\r\nDivision for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea\r\ncontinue to be intensive and commendable.\r\nMr. Dhakal (Nepal): The United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) is\r\nconsidered a “constitution of the sea” that is expected\r\nto make significant contributions to maintaining\r\ninternational peace, security and order by governing\r\nocean affairs, and thus to socio-economic development\r\nin the world. The Convention reflects the significant\r\nprogress achieved in the codification and progressive\r\ndevelopment of international law relating to the sea. It\r\nprovides a comprehensive international legal\r\nframework for cooperation among Member States\r\ntowards the management of oceans for the benefit of\r\nall humankind.\r\nNepal attaches importance to the work of the\r\nUnited Nations with regard to the implementation of\r\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\r\nand other international instruments related to oceans\r\nand the seas. My delegation joins previous speakers in\r\nthanking the Secretary-General for having submitted\r\ncomprehensive reports for our consideration under the\r\nagenda item concerning oceans and the law of the sea.\r\nMy delegation has taken note of the reference\r\nmade in paragraph 15 of the Secretary-General’s report\r\n(A/60/63) concerning access to and from the sea by\r\nlandlocked developing countries and freedom of\r\ntransit.\r\nThe reports draw our attention to important issues\r\nfacing the United Nations, including the increasing\r\nadverse impact on marine ecosystems and the depletion\r\nof fish stocks resulting from illegal, unreported and\r\nunregulated fishing in the seas beyond areas of national\r\njurisdiction. We urge the international community to\r\ntake the necessary measures for the sustainable use of\r\noceans and for the conservation and management of the\r\nbiodiversity of the international seabed as the common\r\nheritage of humankind.\r\nMy delegation is concerned that the growing\r\ndeterioration of the marine environment and the\r\noverexploitation of living marine resources could have\r\na negative effect on global efforts to prevent the\r\ndegradation of the environment and to ensure\r\nsustainable development, including with regard to\r\ngeographical diversity and mountain ecosystems. In\r\nview of the biotechnological potential and vulnerability\r\nof living marine resources, we underline the need for\r\nefforts to ensure marine biodiversity and to prevent,\r\nreduce and eliminate pollution of the marine\r\nenvironment from ships and land-based activities.\r\n11\r\nA/60/PV.55\r\nWe also encourage the International Seabed\r\nAuthority to undertake the necessary measures with\r\nregard to the protection of the flora and fauna of the\r\nseabed, as provided for in article 145 of the\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea. There is also a need\r\nto regulate the prospecting for and exploration of\r\npolymetallic sulphides and cobalt-rich crusts.\r\nDespite our accomplishments over the years in\r\nterms of the institutionalization of international\r\ncooperation in the field of the law of the sea, the\r\nUnited Nations still faces great challenges in the\r\neffective implementation the Convention at the global,\r\nregional and national levels in order to realize its\r\nvarious provisions. Small developing, landlocked and\r\nleast developed countries in particular have faced\r\ndisadvantages due to lack of awareness, limited\r\ncapacity and geographical handicaps, impeding their\r\noptimal realization of the benefits from the world’s\r\noceans and seas.\r\nIt is encouraging to note that article 125 of\r\nUNCLOS provides for the right of access of\r\nlandlocked countries to and from the sea and freedom\r\nof transit through the territories of transit countries by\r\nall means of transport. The 2005 world summit\r\nunequivocally recognized the special difficulties and\r\nconcerns of landlocked developing countries in their\r\nefforts to integrate their economies into the multilateral\r\ntrading system.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the recommendation of\r\nthe Secretary-General that the international community\r\nprovide financial and technical support for the full,\r\ntimely and effective implementation of the São Paulo\r\nConsensus, adopted by the eleventh session of the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development\r\n(UNCTAD), held last year, and the Almaty Ministerial\r\nDeclaration and Almaty Programme of Action, which\r\ntake into account the special needs and vulnerabilities\r\nof landlocked developing countries, particularly the\r\nleast developed ones.\r\nWe underline the need for measures to further\r\nstrengthen cooperative and collaborative efforts to\r\naddress transit transport issues, among others; to\r\nimprove the physical infrastructure and non-physical\r\naspects of transit transport systems; and to develop\r\njoint ventures and strengthen institutions and human\r\nresources.\r\nIt is high time for all of us to rededicate our\r\ncontinued, coordinated and effective efforts to\r\nachieving the noble goals of UNCLOS and of other\r\ncommitments to ensure equity, justice and progress for\r\nall humankind.\r\nMr. Chowdhury (Bangladesh): May I just say\r\nhow good it is to see you, Mr. Vice-President, in the\r\nChair. We also thank the Secretary-General for his\r\nreports under this item.\r\nSome 140 million people live in Bangladesh, on a\r\nterritory of a mere 147,570 square kilometres.\r\nResources are scarce. It is not easy to provide that vast\r\npopulation with a decent standard of living, to which\r\nwe all aspire. Therefore, as a coastal country with\r\nseafaring traditions, we look to the sea for further\r\nresources. From that perspective, Bangladesh attaches\r\nparticular importance to the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea, to which it became\r\na party in 2001, as the legal framework for the peaceful\r\nuse of sea resources. It is heartening that the\r\nConvention is fast approaching its universalization,\r\nwith 148 States parties. My country is committed to\r\nfull implementation of the Convention.\r\nThe achievements of our generation are many. We\r\nhave split the atom. We have conquered Mount\r\nEverest. We have left our footprint on the moon.\r\nHowever, there exists a breathtaking gap in our\r\nscientific knowledge of the resources of sea. The\r\nseabed covers some 71 per cent of world’s surface. An\r\namazing variety of living organisms are present in the\r\nsea, which has become one of the major sources of\r\nfood for our peoples. Aside from the traditional non-\r\nliving resources of the sea, such as oil and gas, it is\r\nestimated that the seabed contains close to 300\r\nminerals, many of which may eventually prove worthy\r\nof exploration and exploitation for the benefit of\r\nmankind. The Convention should provide us with the\r\nnecessary guidance in our common endeavours in that\r\ndirection.\r\nThe authors of the Convention, which is often\r\nreferred to as the constitution of the sea, envisioned it\r\nas, among other things, an instrument for ensuring the\r\nequitable sharing of the living and non-living resources\r\nof the sea. It brought a modicum of order to a system\r\nfraught with potential conflict. Its scope of application\r\nis vast. It covers all uses of ocean space, including\r\nnavigation and overflight. It sets up rules for all uses of\r\nall living and non-living resources on the high seas, on\r\nthe ocean floor and beneath it, on the continental shelf\r\nand in the territorial seas. It provides guidance to\r\n12\r\nA/60/PV.55\r\nprotect the marine environment by ensuring the\r\nsustainable use of marine resources, and it contains\r\nprovisions for dealing with crimes committed at sea.\r\nOceans are of enormous value to the world’s\r\npopulation. They provide us with food, water, raw\r\nmaterials and energy. The combined value of ocean\r\nresources such as fish and minerals, including oil and\r\ngas, and ocean uses such as the recreation industry,\r\ntransportation and communications, is currently\r\nestimated at approximately $7 trillion per year.\r\nHowever, there exists a wide disparity between\r\ndeveloped and developing countries in the share of\r\nbenefits received from that vast wealth. We believe that\r\nenjoyment of marine resources must be conducted in a\r\nway that promotes and protects the interests of all.\r\nSuch an approach would give true meaning to the\r\nexpression “the common heritage of mankind”\r\nestablished by the Convention. We welcome the\r\nestablishment of reserved areas under the authority of\r\nthe International Seabed Authority in that regard. We\r\nalso call for expedited establishment of the Enterprise.\r\nEnhanced marine scientific research is critical for\r\nsustainable exploration and exploitation of marine\r\nresources. We are disappointed that the participation of\r\nmarine scientists from developing countries in marine\r\nscientific research has progressively become marginal.\r\nThat has effectively reduced the possibility of the\r\nparticipation of developing countries in marine\r\nresources exploration and exploitation. That trend must\r\nbe reversed. Expanding the knowledge base of\r\nscientists from developing countries is critical for their\r\nfull enjoyment of the rights set out in the Convention.\r\nBangladesh, a developing country, could also\r\nbenefit from technical cooperation with other States\r\nparties, developed and developing, and relevant\r\ninstitutions in the fields of capacity-building, technology\r\ntransfer and the development of expertise in the areas\r\ncovered by the Convention. Such cooperation might\r\ninclude training facilities and joint surveys. Training\r\non legal issues and on the preparation of national\r\nsubmissions regarding the delineation of the\r\ncontinental shelf would be of immense benefit in\r\nbuilding our national capacity. Joint surveys for coastal\r\nand seabed mapping, as well as a survey of the\r\nresources, would also be useful. We appreciate efforts\r\nof the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the\r\nSea in that regard. Bangladesh calls for strengthening\r\nand expanding the Division’s programmes in the area\r\nof human resource development.\r\nMore than half the world’s population now lives\r\nwithin 100 kilometres of the coast. The prospect of\r\nincreased economic activity at the sea’s edge will\r\ninevitably result in the increased movement of people\r\nto coastal areas. According to one estimate, up to three\r\nfourths of the world’s population will live in coastal\r\nareas by 2025. Such a large-scale movement of\r\npopulations to coastal areas, coupled with a significant\r\nincrease in economic activity and industrialization along\r\nthe coastline — including oil and gas exploration,\r\nmining, fish farming, tourism and the development of\r\nports — would put enormous pressure on coastal areas.\r\nWe ought to be prepared for the consequences, including\r\nthe environmental consequences, of such a large-scale\r\nrelocation of human and economic activities surrounding\r\nthe sea.\r\nThe offshore areas of Bangladesh, including its\r\nexclusive economic zone, have enormous riches in\r\nterms of biodiversity and energy potential. That natural\r\ntreasure house is now under the increasing threat of\r\npollution caused both by land-based activities and by\r\nocean-going vessels. Bangladesh would be particularly\r\nvulnerable to the devastating effects of a major oil\r\nspill. A single such incident could bring enormous\r\nsuffering to the lives and livelihood of people in the\r\ncoastal belt.\r\nIn that context, Bangladesh attaches the utmost\r\nimportance to an ecosystem-based approach in the\r\nexploration and the exploitation of all mineral and\r\nliving and non-living resources. Such an approach\r\nshould preserve biodiversity and not cause harm to the\r\nmarine environment. We must strike a balance between\r\nmarine resources exploitation and the conservation of\r\nthe marine environment. The pollution of the marine\r\nenvironment through our land-based activities such as\r\nthe dumping of waste, as well as unregulated shipping\r\nactivities, has become a concern for all. Illegal,\r\nunreported and unregulated fishing in areas within and\r\noutside national jurisdictions has become cause for\r\ngreat concern. We must act now to apply the provisions\r\nof the Convention in that regard if we are to preserve\r\nthe sea as a repository of resources.\r\nWe are also concerned by the continuing problem\r\nof crimes committed on the sea. Transnational crimes,\r\nincluding piracy and armed robbery, are threatening\r\nmarine safety and security. Their effect on the\r\ninternational sea trade, which moves approximately 90\r\nper cent of goods, has proven colossal.\r\n13\r\nA/60/PV.55\r\nWe value the work of the three bodies created by\r\nthe Convention: the International Tribunal for the Law\r\nof the Sea, the International Seabed Authority and the\r\nCommission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf. As\r\na State party, Bangladesh is committed to actively and\r\nconstructively engaging in their activities. We hope to\r\nwork with other States parties to realize our shared\r\nvision of the sustainable use of sea resources for the\r\ncommon welfare of mankind. In the process, we also\r\naspire to reap our due share of benefits for the people\r\nof Bangladesh.\r\nWe believe that the full, equitable and judicious\r\nimplementation of the United Nations Convention on\r\nthe Law of the Sea would advance our common\r\nendeavours for a substantial improvement of the living\r\nstandards of our peoples. I am sure that if we can\r\nachieve that, it will be one of the greatest contributions\r\ntowards building a prosperous world for our generation\r\nand for unborn generations. The route ahead of us\r\nmight be long and arduous, but we are determined to\r\nsail through the rough seas, for we all know that\r\nreaching port will be worth our while.\r\nMr. Nguyen Duy Chien (Viet Nam): First of all,\r\nwe join other speakers in thanking the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for a set of comprehensive reports, namely\r\ndocuments A/60/63 and its two addenda, A/60/91,\r\nA/60/99 and A/60/189, on developments and issues\r\nrelating to oceans and the law of the sea and to\r\nfisheries during the past year.\r\nSince last year, the number of States parties to the\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\r\n(UNCLOS) has risen from 145 to 149. Our delegation\r\nwarmly congratulates new UNCLOS States parties and\r\nbelieves that the current trend of broadening the\r\nmembership of the Convention will continue. The\r\nSecretary-General’s report to the General Assembly on\r\noceans and the law of the sea was also presented, for\r\nthe first time, to the fifteenth Meeting of States parties\r\nunder article 319 of the Convention. We welcome that\r\nnew development.\r\nWe also note with satisfaction the great work\r\ndone by the International Seabed Authority (ISA), the\r\nCommission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf and\r\nthe International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. Over\r\nthe last six years, the Open-ended Informal\r\nConsultative Process has made valuable contributions\r\nto the General Assembly’s annual deliberations on\r\nocean affairs and the law of the sea. We therefore\r\nsupport the renewal of the mandate of the Informal\r\nConsultative Process for the next three years. Last year,\r\nthe General Assembly also decided, in paragraph 73 of\r\nits resolution 59/24, to establish an ad hoc open-ended\r\ninformal working group to study issues relating to the\r\nconservation and sustainable use of marine biological\r\ndiversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction. We look\r\nforward to the upcoming discussions within the\r\nworking group.\r\nWe wish to take this opportunity to highlight\r\nrecent activities undertaken by Viet Nam in the field of\r\noceans and the law of the sea. At the national level, we\r\ncontinue our efforts to improve the legal framework\r\nregulating marine issues. In June 2005, the National\r\nAssembly of Viet Nam adopted the Maritime Code,\r\nwhich is in full conformity with the provisions of\r\nUNCLOS and other ocean-related international\r\ninstruments to which Viet Nam is a party. At present,\r\nthe preparation of a law on Viet Nam’s sea zones is\r\nalso under way.\r\nAt the regional level, we actively participated in\r\nnegotiating and adopting the Tokyo Regional\r\nCooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and\r\nArmed Robbery against Ships in Asia as well as in\r\nother activities within the framework of the\r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).\r\nRegarding the South China Sea — the Bien Dong\r\nSea — the Thirty-eighth ASEAN Ministerial Meeting,\r\nheld in Vientiane last July, continued to reaffirm the\r\nimportance of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties\r\nin the South China Sea — the Bien Dong Sea — as an\r\nimportant step towards a regional code of conduct in\r\nthe South China Sea. Viet Nam is committed to respect\r\nand implement its provisions and calls upon other\r\nsignatories to fully implement it, to continue to\r\nundertake confidence-building measures for the\r\nmaintenance of peace and stability in the region and to\r\ncommit themselves to resolving the dispute in the\r\nSouth China Sea through peaceful means in accordance\r\nwith international conventions, including UNCLOS.\r\nAt the international level, Viet Nam continues to\r\nattach great importance to the discussion of developments\r\nand issues relating to oceans and the law of the sea. We\r\nparticipated in the fifteenth Meeting of States parties,\r\nthe eleventh session of the International Seabed\r\nAuthority and other relevant and important meetings.\r\nIt is Viet Nam’s view that in implementing\r\nrelevant provisions of UNCLOS and other international\r\n14\r\nA/60/PV.55\r\nconventions, developing countries encounter multiple\r\ndifficulties due to the lack of technical, administrative\r\nand financial capacity. That reality requires continued\r\nefforts aimed at assisting developing countries to enhance\r\ncapacity-building and human resources development,\r\nto get access to advanced information and technology\r\nand to share in expertise involving oceans exploitation.\r\nIn that context, we welcome the valuable contributions\r\nmade by all donors to various trust funds of which\r\ndeveloping countries are beneficiaries.\r\nWe also appreciate efforts by the Division for\r\nOcean Affairs and the Law of the Sea in organizing\r\nspecific training courses and programmes for\r\nparticipants from developing countries such as the\r\nUnited Nations-Nippon Foundation Fellowship\r\nProgramme and the first regional workshop, held in\r\nFiji, relating to the issue of the delineation of the outer\r\nlimits of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical\r\nmiles.\r\nMr. Wali (Nigeria): The United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea, of 1982, remains a\r\nlandmark legal instrument of the contemporary world\r\nand, indeed, of all human civilizations and ages. There\r\nis no gainsaying that our treatment of the high seas will\r\nhave an impact on our shared goals for international\r\npeace and security and sustainable development.\r\nIndeed, the steadfast, efficient and effective application\r\nof the provisions of the Convention is central to the\r\ncontinued survival of all life on Earth. It is in the light\r\nof this that Nigeria, as a signatory to the Convention,\r\nwelcomes the increase in its adherence to 149 States\r\nparties.\r\nNigeria wishes to express its gratitude to the\r\nSecretary-General for his comprehensive yet succinct\r\nreports A/60/63, A/60/63/Add.1, A/60/63/Add.2 and\r\nA/60/91. We also note with appreciation that the\r\nreports incorporate information on the helpful\r\ninitiatives of the International Seabed Authority, the\r\nInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea and the\r\nCommission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf in\r\nfulfilment of their respective mandates under the\r\nConvention. We agree with the Secretary-General that,\r\nin spite of such efforts, our oceans and seas are still\r\nendangered by factors such as climate change, natural\r\ndisasters, environmental degradation, depletion of\r\nfisheries, loss of biodiversity and ineffective flag-State\r\ncontrol. There is, therefore, an urgent need for the\r\nenactment and rigorous implementation of concrete\r\nmeasures to address those challenges.\r\nWith regard to fisheries and related matters,\r\nwhich formed one of the cardinal topics examined at\r\nthe sixth meeting of the United Nations Open-ended\r\nInformal Consultative Process, we agree with the\r\nSecretary-General that the fisheries sector can\r\ncontribute to sustainable development only if it has\r\nitself been managed in a sustainable way.\r\nFisheries management should promote the\r\nmaintenance of the quality, diversity and availability of\r\nfishery resources in sufficient quantities for present\r\nand future generations in the context of food security,\r\npoverty alleviation and sustainable development. It\r\nshould also take account of the economic, social and\r\ncultural needs of fisheries-dependent communities, as\r\nwell as the need of developing countries to maintain\r\nthe revenues from trade that are necessary for their\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe constraints placed on small-scale fisheries in\r\nmany parts of the world are of critical concern to\r\nNigeria. Those constraints — comprehensively and\r\nsuccinctly presented in paragraphs 216 to 221 of the\r\nSecretary-General’s report contained in document\r\nA/60/63 — impoverish small-scale fisheries, reduce\r\nthe contributions of fisheries to sustainable\r\ndevelopment and damage the environment and the\r\nhealth of local people. We therefore endorse the\r\nSecretary-General’s call for relevant authorities to\r\nmake explicit choices to take on board the needs of\r\nsmall-scale fisheries, particularly to facilitate or\r\nmaximize food security and poverty alleviation.\r\nWith regard to factors limiting the contribution of\r\nfisheries to sustainable development, illegal,\r\nunreported and unregulated fishing and overfishing\r\nremain a primary challenge. Nigeria is concerned about\r\nthe relentless practices and engagements on the high\r\nseas that tend towards over-exploitation, excessive\r\nfleet sizes, the re-flagging of ships to escape controls,\r\nexcessive bycatch and the lack of enforcement of\r\nconservation measures, as well as unreliable databases\r\nand the lack of cooperation between States. Those\r\nproblems result from that lack of cooperation among\r\nMember States to forge a universal legal regime for the\r\nconservation and management of fisheries. They have\r\nbeen further compounded by the inability of regional\r\nfisheries management organizations, particularly those\r\nin developing countries, to effectively monitor the\r\nfishing vessels of non-contracting parties because the\r\nrelevant flag States are not parties to such\r\norganizations.\r\n15\r\nA/60/PV.55\r\nThe regulations of the organizations are often\r\nviolated with impunity, and their principal objective —\r\nto conserve and ensure sustainable use of the managed\r\nfisheries — is undermined. We enjoin States involved\r\nto rein in their fishing firms so that our shared\r\nresponsibilities and duties under the Convention and\r\nthe 1995 Agreement are not shirked.\r\nNigeria considers the forthcoming May 2006\r\nreview conference of the Fish Stocks Agreement to be\r\nof great importance for our efforts to manage fishery\r\nstocks. Indeed, that review should provide an\r\nopportunity for States to reaffirm their support for the\r\nabolition of policies and practices that have had, and\r\ncontinue to have, a negative impact on developing\r\ncountries. We should not shy away from measures that\r\nwould help to protect marine natural resources from\r\npollution or illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing.\r\nI hasten to add that such measures should include those\r\ntaken at national and regional levels with regard to\r\nwaters under national jurisdiction, particularly those\r\nbelonging to coastal developing countries.\r\nNigeria also welcomes the various initiatives and\r\nprogrammes directed at building and strengthening the\r\ncapacities of developing countries, including\r\ncontributions by the United Nations Institute for\r\nTraining and Research (UNITAR), the Hamilton\r\nShirley Amerasinghe Memorial Programme, the United\r\nNations-Nippon Foundation fellowship programme, the\r\nTRAIN-SEA-COAST programme, trust funds and\r\nother technical assistance packages. Those programmes\r\ncomplement others undertaken in collaboration with\r\nthe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United\r\nNations, such as the United Kingdom-funded\r\nSustainable Fisheries Livelihoods Programme, the\r\nGlobal Environment Facility of the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme and the Commonwealth\r\nSecretariat.\r\nIn the same vein, we believe regional training\r\ncourses — such as that relating to the preparation of\r\nsubmissions to the Commission on the Limits of the\r\nContinental Shelf on the outer limits of the continental\r\nshelf beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines\r\nfrom which the breadth of the territorial sea is\r\nmeasured, which has been proposed for Accra early\r\nnext month — reflect synergies that would redound to\r\nthe interests of participants. We commend the Division\r\nfor Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea, the Office of\r\nLegal Affairs, the Government of Ghana, the\r\nCommonwealth Secretariat, the African Union and the\r\nInternational Seabed Authority, which have jointly\r\norganized the course. There is a need to make such\r\ntraining programmes more sustained as part of the\r\nprocess.\r\nI wish to assure the Assembly that, in those\r\nefforts, Nigeria will continue to work closely with\r\nMember States.\r\nMrs. Ramos Rodríguez (Cuba) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): We are very pleased that the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea remains fully in\r\nforce today. We reaffirm its universal character and\r\nfundamental importance for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, as well as for the\r\nsustainable development of the oceans and seas.\r\nMy delegation places particular emphasis on the\r\nneed to strengthen international cooperation among all\r\nthe stakeholders involved in the management of the\r\noceans and seas, including information-sharing and\r\ncapacity-building — aspects of vital importance for\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nGiven its geography, my country is particularly\r\ninterested in issues relating to the seas and oceans.\r\nDespite the serious economic difficulties that it faces,\r\nit continues to make great efforts in implementing its\r\nnational strategies for sustainable development and the\r\nprotection of the marine environment with a view to\r\nensuring the coherent and effective application of the\r\nprovisions of the Convention.\r\nThe United Nations Convention on the Law of\r\nthe Sea establishes an appropriate and universally\r\nrecognized legal framework within which all activities\r\nrelating to the oceans and seas are carried out. It is for\r\nthat reason that we call attention to the policies and\r\ninitiatives of certain States that contravene the\r\nConvention, as in the case of the Proliferation Security\r\nInitiative. The practical implementation of that\r\ninitiative would require us to ignore the generally\r\naccepted standards relating to the interception of\r\nvessels and to the legal regimes that apply in various\r\nmaritime areas.\r\nThe President took the Chair.\r\nFurthermore, we would like to point out that any\r\ncommercially oriented activities concerning biological\r\ndiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction must be\r\ngoverned by the principles established by the\r\nConvention, which states that marine scientific\r\nresearch in the Area must be carried out exclusively for\r\n16\r\nA/60/PV.55\r\npeaceful purposes and for the benefit of all of\r\nhumankind.\r\nIn that context, we await with interest the\r\noutcome of the Ad Hoc Open-ended Informal Working\r\nGroup, which is scheduled to meet in February 2006 to\r\nstudy issues relating to the conservation and\r\nsustainable use of marine biodiversity beyond national\r\njurisdiction. We believe that all issues relating to the\r\nmandate of that Group must be studied in detail,\r\nincluding those relating to the common heritage of\r\nhumankind and the effective distribution of benefits in\r\naccordance with the principles of international law,\r\nincluding the Declaration of Principles Governing the\r\nSeabed and Ocean Floor, and the Subsoil Thereof,\r\nbeyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction, as\r\ncontained in General Assembly resolution 2749\r\n(XXV), and the United Nations Convention on the Law\r\nof the Sea.\r\nWe cannot conclude without thanking the\r\ncoordinators of the two draft resolutions before us\r\ntoday for their work.\r\nMrs. Picco (Monaco) (spoke in French): The\r\nPrincipality of Monaco has always been especially\r\nconcerned about the protection of the seas and the\r\noceans, as evinced by its involvement in the\r\nMediterranean region.\r\nAs in the past, the quality of the many reports\r\nsubmitted for our consideration under the agenda item\r\non oceans and the law of the sea attests to the\r\nexemplary work of the Division for Ocean Affairs and\r\nthe Law of the Sea and the dedication of its staff. That\r\nwork also reflects the central role played by the oceans\r\nand seas, including sustainable fisheries, in the future\r\nof our planet.\r\nAmong the various areas covered by the two draft\r\nresolutions that Monaco is co-sponsoring, I wish to\r\nhighlight the following points.\r\nThree years after the Johannesburg World\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development, the General\r\nAssembly is preparing to launch the initial phase of the\r\nregular process for global reporting and assessment of\r\nthe state of the marine environment, including socio-\r\neconomic aspects. The next two years, during which\r\nthe “Assessment of Assessments” will take place, will\r\nbe crucial to the establishment of the process.\r\nThe Principality of Monaco is very pleased that\r\nthe United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)\r\nand the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission\r\nof the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization were chosen as the lead organizations for\r\nthe important “Assessment of Assessments” phase. We\r\nhave confidence in that partnership. The research and\r\nsummarizing work to be carried out is mainly scientific\r\nat this stage. The results to be submitted by the experts\r\nwill serve as a basis for the policy decisions to be taken\r\nby our leaders. The conclusions to be submitted will be\r\nessential because they will constitute the basis of our\r\nfuture work in effectively implementing that\r\nindispensable process for ensuring the protection of the\r\nmarine environment and enhancing the socio-economic\r\naspects of the use of the oceans.\r\nAs the host country of the International\r\nHydrographic Organization (IHO), the Principality of\r\nMonaco gladly welcomes the fact that 21 June of each\r\nyear will be celebrated as the World Hydrography Day.\r\nThe role of hydrography in the security of navigation,\r\nthe preservation of human life at sea, and the\r\nprotection of the environment, including vulnerable\r\nmarine ecosystems, has too long been unknown by the\r\npublic at large. Obtaining observer status in the\r\nGeneral Assembly has allowed the IHO to develop its\r\nassistance in creating electronic maritime charts that\r\ncontribute to the sustainable exploitation of fisheries,\r\nother uses of the marine environment, the delimitation\r\nof maritime borders, and environmental protection.\r\nOver and above the tribute it pays to the work of\r\nhydrographers, the annual event will allow us to\r\npromote a scientific field that has remained in the\r\nshadows for too long.\r\nThe alarming UNEP report on marine debris only\r\nheightens our concern over the ever-growing\r\naccumulation of non-biodegradable debris in the\r\nmarine and coastal environments. Despite efforts to\r\ncreate a legal framework to protect seas and oceans,\r\nlacunae still exist both in the application and\r\nenforcement of international rules and norms, and in\r\nthe understanding by the principal actors and the public\r\nof the problem. And yet, marine debris has disastrous\r\nconsequences for the environment, the economy,\r\nsecurity and health. Very few studies exist to permit an\r\nassessment of the scale of the phenomenon, and its\r\neffects can be difficult to evaluate, particularly because\r\nof the very nature of such debris, such as that known as\r\nphantom fishing.\r\nAnother subject of concern is the issue of noise\r\npollution and its effects on marine biological\r\n17\r\nA/60/PV.55\r\nresources — a phenomenon that is new to many of us.\r\nWhile not yet the subject of international regulation,\r\nnoise pollution in the marine environment is\r\nresponsible for changes in behaviour and for injuries\r\nthat could lead to the deaths of marine mammals and\r\nother species. The various appeals launched in 2004 —\r\nparticularly by the International Whaling Commission,\r\nthe European Parliament, and the parties to the\r\nAgreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of\r\nthe Baltic and North Seas and the Agreement on the\r\nConservation of Cetaceans of the Black Sea,\r\nMediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area —\r\nshould urgently prompt us to undertake more thorough\r\nstudies and work that will allow us take the necessary\r\nmeasures at the regional and international levels.\r\n2006 will see the convening of the review\r\nconference of the States parties to the 1995 Agreement\r\nfor the Implementation of the Provisions of the United\r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea of\r\n10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation and\r\nManagement of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly\r\nMigratory Fish Stocks. The conference will allow us to\r\nassess the progress achieved with regard to illegal,\r\nunreported and unregulated fisheries; to the\r\nresponsibility of flag States, especially for the genuine\r\nlink; to tracing fish; to inventories of fishing vessels;\r\nand so on.\r\nI will conclude my statement with a reference to a\r\nlegal concept that needs to be strengthened: the\r\nprecautionary principle. This year, we commemorate\r\nthe tenth anniversary of the adoption of the Global\r\nProgramme of Action for the Protection of the Marine\r\nEnvironment from Land-based Activities, and we must\r\ncontinue to strengthen the protection of the marine\r\necosystem. The precautionary principle and the\r\necosystem approach are fundamental to the conservation\r\nand management of fishing resources. In that respect,\r\nmy delegation welcomes the adoption of the theme of\r\n“an ecosystem approach to oceans management” as the\r\ncentral element of the forthcoming meeting of the\r\nOpen-ended Informal Consultative Process.\r\nThe President: I wish to inform members that, at\r\nthe request of the sponsors of draft resolution\r\nA/60/L.26, action on the draft resolution is postponed\r\nto a later date, to be announced in the Journal.\r\nMr. Lobach (Russian Federation) (spoke in\r\nRussian): The discussion of maritime issues is\r\ntraditionally accorded considerable importance by the\r\nGeneral Assembly. The Russian Federation actively\r\nsupports efforts aimed at the progressive development\r\nof maritime law and at improving multilateral\r\ncooperation machinery to strengthen international legal\r\ncontrol of State activities on the high seas, the effective\r\nuse and conservation of marine resources, the protection\r\nof the marine environment, and the conduct of\r\nscientific research.\r\nI wish to note in particular the contribution of the\r\nSecretary-General in that sphere. His annual report on\r\nthe law of the sea and sustainable fisheries contains\r\nmuch useful information and provides a good basis for\r\na comprehensive assessment of the current situation\r\nand for defining future collective measures in that area.\r\nThe 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law\r\nof the Sea is an extremely important instrument for\r\nensuring effective multilateral cooperation on the high\r\nseas. In the years since it came into force, that unique\r\ninternational agreement has fostered a qualitative\r\nimprovement in the legal regime and strengthened\r\nmultilateral coordination in maritime affairs. We note\r\nin particular the Convention’s role in maintaining\r\npeace and security and in the use of the maritime space\r\nfor peaceful ends. We call on States that have not yet\r\ndone so to accede to the Convention in the near future.\r\nThe Russian Federation welcomes the outcome of\r\nthe work of the international organizations established\r\npursuant to the Convention, in particular the\r\nInternational Seabed Authority (ISA). Today, the ISA\r\nhas important and wide-ranging issues on its agenda,\r\nthe resolution of which will require persistent\r\nconsideration and significant resources. In that respect,\r\nwe continue to believe that it is not appropriate to task\r\nthat body with more work in the sphere of protecting\r\nbiological resources in the Area.\r\nIt is also a priority to ensure the uninterrupted\r\nfunctioning of the Commission on the Limits of the\r\nContinental Shelf, given the constantly increasing\r\nnumber of applications it is receiving. We urge the\r\nCommission to carry out its work in strict adherence to\r\nits mandates and procedures, which are set out in the\r\nrelevant provisions of the 1982 Convention. In\r\nparticular, we wish to emphasize the importance of\r\nbroadening multilateral cooperation aimed at\r\nenhancing flag States’ control over their vessels. We\r\nwelcome the efforts of the International Maritime\r\nOrganization to address that issue.\r\n18\r\nA/60/PV.55\r\nThe draft resolutions at the sixtieth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on the law of the sea and on\r\nsustainable fisheries, which we will be adopting at this\r\nmeeting, contain many provisions concerning the\r\nimportant follow-up work to be carried out by States.\r\nHere, we should like to note in particular the meetings\r\nof the Ad Hoc Open-ended Informal Working Group on\r\nissues related to the conservation and sustainable use\r\nof marine biodiversity beyond areas of national\r\njurisdiction. The fifth round of informal consultations\r\nof States parties to the 1995 United Nations Fish\r\nStocks Agreement will be held in March 2006. That\r\nevent will be a main forum for the preparation of the\r\nMay 2006 review conference on the Agreement. We\r\nbelieve that, if it is to be successful, the conference\r\nmust have the broadest possible participation.\r\nTherefore, we appeal once again to States that have not\r\nyet done so to accede to the 1995 Agreement as soon\r\nas possible.\r\nWith regard to the forthcoming annual meeting of\r\nStates parties to the United Nations Convention on the\r\nLaw of the Sea, we wish to stress the importance of\r\nkeeping the current mandate of that forum, which is to\r\nresolve administrative and budgetary issues related to\r\nthe functioning of the bodies established under the\r\nConvention.\r\nThe Russian Federation welcomes the fact that\r\nthe Informal Consultative Process will continue its\r\nwork for the next three years without changing its\r\ncurrent mandate. Today, the Consultative Process is\r\nplaying an important role by permitting a broader\r\nexchange of views on topical issues related to the law\r\nof the sea, with the participation of States, academics,\r\nexperts and practitioners.\r\nWe consider appropriate the decision to initiate\r\nthe regular global assessment of the state of the marine\r\nenvironment. That measure will enable us to identify\r\nexisting gaps in specific areas of knowledge and to\r\ndetermine what measures must be taken to fill those\r\ngaps. We hope that international bodies such as the\r\nIntergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of\r\nUNESCO and the United Nations Environment\r\nProgramme, which are the leaders in carrying out this\r\nprocess, will successfully accomplish the tasks given\r\nthem.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to express our\r\nsupport for both of the draft resolutions that we will be\r\nadopting at this General Assembly meeting. We thank\r\nthe coordinators, Ms. Holly Koehler and Mr. Marcos\r\nLourenço de Almeida, for their efforts in preparing\r\nthose extremely important documents.\r\nMs. Rivero (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): At the\r\noutset, my delegation wishes to thank in particular the\r\ncoordinators of draft resolutions A/60/L.22 and\r\nA/60/L.23, Mr. Marcos Lourenço de Almeida and\r\nMs. Holly Koehler, for their active and efficient work. We\r\nalso take this opportunity to express our gratitude to\r\nthe Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea\r\nfor its tireless assistance, from which we benefited\r\nduring the negotiations, and many other activities.\r\nFor Uruguay, ocean affairs are particularly\r\nimportant. As a developing country, we believe it is\r\nessential to ensure the sustainability of resources.\r\nTherefore, concerned at the persistent signs of\r\ndeterioration of the marine environment, we recognize\r\nthe need to take urgent conservation measures in\r\nvulnerable marine ecosystems, such as seamounts.\r\nHowever, such measures must be considered on a case-\r\nby-case basis, must be supported by reliable scientific\r\ninformation based on actual observations and must\r\nconform to the provisions of the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). In that\r\nconnection, we believe it is crucial that ocean policies\r\ncontinue to be based on cooperation and coordination\r\nat all levels and on the use of interdisciplinary and\r\ncomprehensive approaches.\r\nWe agree with those who believe that we must\r\nimprove conventional methods of fisheries\r\nmanagement. In order to do that, we must establish an\r\nintegrated ecosystem-based fisheries and oceans\r\nmanagement system. Therefore and because we attach\r\nthe utmost importance to the continuity of the ocean\r\naffairs consultation process, we note with special\r\ninterest the forthcoming meeting of the United Nations\r\nOpen-ended Informal Consultative Process on Oceans\r\nand the Law of the Sea. We trust that it will have\r\ninteresting results that will be of benefit to us. In that\r\nconnection, I wish to place on record that it is my\r\ndelegation’s understanding that the current choice of a\r\nsub-item will not create a precedent that will prevent\r\nus from addressing a greater number of items in future,\r\nso long as we can ensure their efficient consideration.\r\nMy country attaches great interest to several\r\nissues addressed in the draft resolutions under our\r\nconsideration, including the safety of navigation,\r\nmaritime transportation and the protection and\r\n19\r\nA/60/PV.55\r\nsustainable use of marine biodiversity. We hope to make\r\nsubstantive progress on those issues in the forthcoming\r\nnegotiations, particularly at the meeting of the Ad Hoc\r\nWorking Group to be held in February 2006.\r\nWe believe that building States’ fisheries\r\nmanagement capacity is important to ensure effective\r\ncontrol and sustainable use of their resources and the\r\ntransfer of marine technology. We are in favour of\r\nstudies on the impact of man-generated ocean noise on\r\nfisheries and ecologically related species. We\r\nparticularly support strengthening regional fisheries\r\nmanagement organizations in order to establish a\r\ncomprehensive, stable and predictable regulatory\r\nframework based on each regional ecosystem.\r\nWe believe it is not only our right, but also our\r\nobligation, to state that the international community\r\nmust focus all its efforts on limiting illegal, unreported\r\nand unregulated fishing, subsidies and any other\r\npractice that helps to diminish the contribution of\r\nfishing to sustainable development.\r\nMoreover, the international community must take\r\naction to avoid the impact of marine debris on health\r\nand productivity and the resulting economic losses. It\r\nis urgent that States reduce the amount of marine\r\ndebris by implementing national, regional and\r\nsubregional prevention and rehabilitation programmes.\r\nWith specific regard to the loss or release of fishing\r\ngear and related material, we encourage cooperation\r\nand coordination among fishing organizations,\r\nprogrammes and operators to determine its causes and\r\nto reduce them by proposing recycling, reuse and\r\nreduction strategies based on economic incentives.\r\nAlthough we wish to be optimistic about the 2006\r\nreview conference on the provisions agreed in\r\nresolution 59/25 on issues related to the impacts of\r\nbottom trawling on vulnerable marine ecosystems, we\r\ncannot fail to stress that the irreversible damage\r\nalready caused to the marine environment leaves us\r\nlittle room for manoeuvre. We therefore urge that\r\nmeasures be intensified to halt such undesirable\r\neffects.\r\nWith regard to the review conference, I wish to\r\nnote that my delegation, hoping to secure the broadest\r\npossible acceptance of the principles of the 1995\r\nAgreement and the greatest possible participation of\r\nStates, encourages the participation of States not\r\nparties on an equal footing with States parties.\r\nMs. Zanelli (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): My\r\ndelegation thanks the coordinators of the two draft\r\nresolutions before us, Mr. Marcos Lourenço de Almeida\r\nof Brazil and Ms. Holly Koehler of the United States.\r\nWe also wish to recognize the work of the\r\nDivision for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea,\r\nespecially its support in the consultation process and\r\nits training programmes, which are particularly helpful\r\nto the capacity-building of developing countries.\r\nPeru notes the renewal of the mandate of the\r\nOpen-ended Informal Consultative Process on Oceans\r\nand the Law of the Sea, as well as the agreement to\r\nactivate the initial phase of the regular process for\r\nglobal reporting and assessment of the state of the\r\nmarine environment, including socio-economic aspects.\r\nPeru awaits with interest the onset of the work of\r\nthe Ad Hoc Open-ended Informal Working Group to\r\nmeet in February 2006 to study questions related to the\r\nconservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity\r\nbeyond the limits of national jurisdiction. The themes\r\nincluded in the group’s mandate must be thoroughly\r\nstudied, including those relating to the common\r\nheritage of humankind and the effective distribution of\r\nbenefits in conformity with the principles of\r\ninternational law.\r\nPeru is particularly concerned by the issue of the\r\nmaritime transportation of radioactive materials. We\r\nrecognize that there have been developments in the\r\nframework of the International Atomic Energy Agency.\r\nWe intend to pursue efforts to implement the Action\r\nPlan for the Safety of Transport of Radioactive\r\nMaterial and to continue dialogue and consultations\r\nwith the States involved.\r\nPeru emphasizes the importance of the trade in\r\nfisheries products, particularly for the developing\r\ncountries, and thus attaches great significance to the\r\nappeal made in draft resolution A/60/L.23 for the\r\nelimination of barriers to trade and for effective, non-\r\ndiscriminatory access to markets.\r\nPeru recognizes the valuable contribution of\r\nfisheries to food security and to the fight against\r\npoverty, as well as the role played by craft fishing in\r\nthat area. It is important to stress the problems inherent\r\nto craft fishing, to provide financial support, and to\r\nsupport capacity training, including the transfer of\r\ntechnology. In that regard, we recognize the work of\r\nthe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United\r\n20\r\nA/60/PV.55\r\nNations and encourage States, financial institutions and\r\nintergovernmental organizations to support efforts to\r\nthat end.\r\nPeru reiterates the great importance for all States\r\nto participate on an equal footing in the review\r\nconference of the parties to the 1995 Agreement for the\r\nImplementation of the Provisions of the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December\r\n1982 relating to the Conservation and Management of\r\nStraddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish\r\nStocks, as well as in its preparatory process, in order to\r\npromote the Agreement’s universality. The rules of\r\nprocedure of the review conference must preserve the\r\nintegrity of article 36 of the Agreement, a provision\r\nallowing the participation of intergovernmental and\r\nnon-governmental organizations only in their\r\ncapacities as observers.\r\nPeru is convinced of the need to continue to\r\nincrease the efficiency of the informal consultations on\r\nthe two draft resolutions under consideration by the\r\nGeneral Assembly. One issue of great importance is the\r\nneed to ensure the effective participation of delegations\r\nin the consultations. Peru therefore welcomes the fact\r\nthat the concerns expressed by many delegations,\r\nincluding our own, have been taken into account in\r\nparagraph 113 of draft resolution A/60/L.22, whereby\r\nit would be decided to limit the period of the informal\r\nconsultations on both resolutions to a maximum of four\r\nweeks in total and to ensure that the consultations are\r\nscheduled in such a way as to avoid overlap with the\r\nperiod during which the Sixth Committee is meeting.\r\nThat programming improvement must be accompanied\r\nby a joint effort to reduce the length of the draft\r\nresolutions.\r\nThe President: In accordance with General\r\nAssembly resolution 54/195 of 17 December 1999, I\r\nnow call on the observer for the International Union for\r\nthe Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources.\r\nMs. Kimball (International Union for the\r\nConservation of Nature and Natural Resources): Once\r\nagain it is time to take stock of the world’s oceans and\r\nfisheries. For the International Union for the\r\nConservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN),\r\nthe conservation of natural resources and ecosystems is\r\na fundamental underpinning of world food security and\r\npoverty alleviation. That applies equally in the marine\r\nrealm. We welcome the reference to oceans in the\r\noutcome of the 2005 world summit.\r\nToday, challenges in the coastal zone are\r\nespecially severe, but impacts from human activities\r\nare expanding throughout the oceans. In areas beyond\r\nnational jurisdiction, collective action is essential for\r\neffective conservation and management, not only to\r\nsupport species and habitat recovery in more heavily\r\nimpacted zones, but also to maintain the biodiversity of\r\nthe international commons for the benefit of all.\r\nIUCN has supported three main avenues for\r\nmaking progress. Most critically, we need to improve\r\nhigh seas fisheries conservation and management, to\r\nensure ecosystem and precautionary approaches based\r\non the best available scientific information, and to end\r\nall forms of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.\r\nSecondly, we need to identify priority sites for\r\nspecial protection and management measures on a\r\nprecautionary basis in the short term, and, over the\r\nlonger term, through a more comprehensive and\r\nsystematic approach that advances the World Summit\r\non Sustainable Development target of representative\r\nmarine protected areas by 2012. It is particularly\r\nimportant to protect vulnerable deep sea ecosystems on\r\nan interim basis to allow regulatory regimes and\r\nscientific research to catch up with current threats,\r\nnotably destructive fishing methods.\r\nThirdly, we need to strengthen scientific data\r\ncollection, research and assessment, especially in deep\r\nsea areas, and to provide baselines for harvested\r\nresources and for other marine species, habitats and\r\necological relationships.\r\nOn the latter point, we are pleased that the start-\r\nup phase of the Global Marine Assessment (GMA) has\r\nnow been agreed. We urge the GMA process to build\r\non such important international research initiatives as\r\nthe Census of Marine Life. In order to enhance\r\nprospects for international agreement on effective\r\nmanagement, as the research community ventures\r\nfurther into deep sea environments, we encourage\r\nbroad international collaboration and widespread\r\navailability of data, samples and findings.\r\nOn another issue, IUCN is particularly pleased\r\nthat the effort to turn back the clock on gradual\r\nprogress towards transparency and wider participation\r\nby civil society and the private sector in United\r\nNations bodies has taken a pragmatic course. It is vital\r\nthat the tools the international community has\r\ndeveloped to further those goals and to balance the\r\n21\r\nA/60/PV.55\r\ninterests and needs of States be applied consistently\r\nand fairly.\r\nConcerning next year’s developments, IUCN\r\nwould like to see substantial efforts to halt unregulated\r\nand inadequately regulated high seas fisheries,\r\nespecially such destructive fishing practices as bottom\r\ntrawling that impact vulnerable marine ecosystems.\r\nLike other conservation groups, IUCN considers that\r\nnext year’s progress review on that issue offers major\r\nopportunities to improve high seas fisheries\r\ngovernance.\r\nWe will continue to support a performance review\r\nof regional fisheries management organizations based\r\non objective criteria. In our view, a global mechanism\r\nwill be necessary at some stage to promote the\r\nconsistent application of best practices by those bodies\r\nand to reflect the stake of the international community\r\nas a whole.\r\nAt the upcoming review conference for the\r\nAgreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of\r\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\r\nof 10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation and\r\nManagement of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly\r\nMigratory Fish Stocks, we will look for several\r\ncommitments to establishing a time frame for formally\r\napplying relevant provisions of the Agreement to\r\ndiscrete high seas fish stocks; ensuring regular review\r\nof the Agreement’s implementation over the longer\r\nterm; elaborating and endorsing technical guidance to\r\nflesh out the Agreement’s precautionary approach for\r\nnew and exploratory fisheries; expediting the work of\r\nthe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United\r\nNations (FAO) on technical guidelines to manage deep\r\nsea fisheries and on the use of marine protected areas\r\nin fisheries management; considering a global\r\nscientific mechanism to assist regional fisheries\r\nmanagement organizations in ensuring quality data\r\ncollection and assessment methods that support the\r\nAgreement’s ecosystem and precautionary approaches;\r\nand strengthening links among regional fisheries\r\nmanagement organizations and with FAO to create a\r\nseamless network of information on high seas fishing\r\nvessels, owners and operators, traded fish products,\r\nand actions by port, flag, coastal and market States so\r\nthat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing is truly\r\nbanished.\r\nWith regard to the meeting of the Ad Hoc Open-\r\nended Informal Working Group that is to take place in\r\nFebruary, the Union believes it will be important to\r\naffirm stronger collective responsibility on the part of\r\nall States to ensure the conservation and sustainable\r\nuse of marine biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction.\r\nWe hope that the Group will be able to move beyond\r\nthe debate — which no one will win — regarding\r\nwhether deep seabed genetic resources beyond national\r\njurisdiction are, or are not, the common heritage of\r\nhumankind. Instead, it could look to established\r\nprinciples that may provide common ground for further\r\ndeliberations.\r\nWe all know many of those principles. They\r\ninclude precautionary and ecosystems approaches;\r\nsustainable and equitable use of resources; the duty not\r\nto cause damage to the marine environment beyond\r\nnational jurisdiction, including rare or fragile\r\necosystems; prior environmental impact assessment;\r\nand, importantly, the promotion of international\r\ncooperation and capacity building in marine scientific\r\nresearch by making available information on proposed\r\nmajor scientific research programmes, their objectives\r\nand resulting knowledge, as specified in the\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea. Such principles can\r\nlead to the identification of both near-term\r\nprecautionary actions and medium-term initiatives.\r\nAnd there are others.\r\nIn the near term, we note especially the\r\nopportunity for the Working Group to link marine\r\nscientific research, the conservation agenda and the\r\nidentification of priority sites for special protection and\r\nmanagement measures. Those sites could serve\r\ndifferent purposes: as areas for managing the risks to\r\nmarine biodiversity in sensitive and vulnerable\r\necosystems; as relatively undisturbed areas for long-\r\nterm scientific research and environmental monitoring;\r\nor as genetic reservoirs for promoting the recovery of\r\nimpacted species and areas or encouraging scientific\r\nactivities related to bio-prospecting.\r\nFinally, like many others, we are grateful for the\r\ncontinually excellent reports produced by the\r\nSecretary-General.\r\nThe President: In accordance with General\r\nAssembly resolution 51/6, of 24 October 1996, I now\r\ncall on Mr. Satya Nandan, Secretary-General of the\r\nInternational Seabed Authority.\r\nMr. Nandan (International Seabed Authority): I\r\nshould like to express my appreciation for the\r\nSecretary-General’s reports on oceans and the law of\r\n22\r\nA/60/PV.55\r\nthe sea (A/60/63 and Add.1 and Add.2), as well as for\r\nthe report on sustainable fisheries (A/60/189). They\r\nprovide comprehensive accounts on recent\r\ndevelopments in the law of the sea and, together with\r\nthe report on the work of the Open-ended Informal\r\nConsultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the Sea\r\n(A/60/99), are essential background for the\r\nconsideration by the General Assembly of agenda item\r\n75, entitled “Oceans and the law of the sea.\r\nI would like to compliment the Secretariat of the\r\nDivision for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea for\r\npreparing the reports, specially its Director, Mr. Vladimir\r\nGolitsyn, whose leadership of the Division has given\r\nfocus and renewed impetus to its work.\r\nI would also like to express my appreciation to\r\nthe coordinators of the two draft resolutions before the\r\nAssembly, as well as to their colleagues, for their\r\nuntiring efforts in forging agreements on the two draft\r\ntexts. I am particularly appreciative of the references in\r\nthe omnibus draft resolution (A/60/L.22) to matters\r\nrelating to the International Seabed Authority.\r\nSince my statement to the Assembly at the fifty-\r\nninth session, the International Seabed Authority has\r\nheld its eleventh session in Kingston. That session was\r\nmarked by a significant event, namely, the submission\r\nof an application for approval of a plan of work for the\r\nexploration of polymetallic nodules by the Federal\r\nRepublic of Germany, as represented by the German\r\nFederal Institute for Geosciences and Natural\r\nResources. As required, the applicant has expended\r\nmore than $30 million in research and prospecting in\r\nthe deep seabed. The application pertains to the\r\nClipperton-Clarion Fracture Zone of the north-east\r\nPacific Ocean. It covers an area of 149,976 square\r\nkilometres that is divided into two areas of equal\r\nestimated commercial value, as required by the\r\nConvention and the regulations of the Authority.\r\nAmong other things, the applicant has provided a\r\nprogramme for its exploration activities and a\r\nprogramme for environmental monitoring, as well as a\r\ntraining programme for developing country scientists.\r\nIn accordance with the Authority’s mining code,\r\nthe application was reviewed by the Legal and\r\nTechnical Commission, which recommended its\r\napproval to the Council of the Authority, identifying\r\nthe area to be allocated to the applicant and the area to\r\nbe reserved for the Authority under the parallel system.\r\nThe Council, having considered the recommendations\r\nof the Legal and Technical Commission, approved the\r\nplan of work for exploration of polymetallic nodules\r\non 23 August 2005, and requested the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to issue a contract to the applicant in\r\naccordance with the regulations.\r\nThat application for a contract and its approval by\r\nthe Council constitute an important milestone in the\r\nlife of the Authority, as that was the first new\r\napplication received following the entry into force of\r\nthe 1982 Convention and the establishment of the\r\nAuthority. Germany now joins seven other contractors\r\nthat were initially registered as pioneer investors by the\r\nPreparatory Commission and were sponsored,\r\nrespectively, by China, France, India, Japan, the Republic\r\nof Korea, the Russian Federation and a consortium of\r\nEastern European countries based in Poland.\r\nDuring the Authority’s eleventh session, the\r\nAuthority made significant progress with regard to the\r\ndraft regulations on prospecting and exploration for\r\npolymetallic sulphides and cobalt-rich crusts submitted\r\nto it by the Legal and Technical Commission. The\r\nCouncil completed its first reading of the regulations\r\nand requested the secretariat to provide more detailed\r\nanalysis and elaboration on a number of issues in the\r\ndraft regulations: in particular on the size of the\r\nexploration areas, the proposed system for the\r\nallocation of exploration blocks and the way in which\r\nit would operate in practice, as well as on the proposed\r\nschedule for the relinquishment of one half of the\r\nexploration area.\r\nIt was noted that, compared to the regulations on\r\nprospecting and exploration for polymetallic nodules,\r\nthe draft regulations on polymetallic sulphides and\r\ncobalt-rich crusts contained additional provisions\r\naimed at the protection and preservation of the marine\r\nenvironment. It was recalled that some of the studies\r\ncarried out by the Authority had suggested that there\r\nwas a greater risk of environmental damage from\r\nexploration for sulphides and crusts as compared to\r\nexploration for polymetallic nodules.\r\nThe Council considered that it would be helpful if\r\nit could be provided with a more detailed analysis of\r\nthe proposed changes to the draft regulations and their\r\nrelationship to the provisions of the Convention and\r\nthe 1994 Agreement. The Council also noted that it\r\nwould be necessary for the draft regulations to include\r\nappropriate provisions consistent with the Convention\r\nand the Agreement for the resolution of overlapping\r\n23\r\nA/60/PV.55\r\nclaims. It was also noted that the draft regulations did\r\nnot appear to reflect fully the anti-monopoly provisions\r\ncontained in annex III of the Convention.\r\nThe Council will continue its consideration of the\r\ndraft regulations at its next session. In the meantime,\r\nthe secretariat has been requested to prepare a revised\r\ntext of the draft in order to address some of the\r\ntechnical issues that were raised during the session, as\r\nwell as to provide additional technical papers and\r\nanalyses of the more complex issues, in order to guide\r\nthe discussions in the Council.\r\nOver the last several years, the Authority has\r\nconvened a series of workshops on topics related to the\r\ndeep seabed environment and its resources. The\r\nparticipants in those workshops were experts with\r\npractical experience in research and exploration in the\r\ndeep ocean. The workshops provided the best available\r\nscientific information on deep seabed resources and the\r\necosystems in which they are found. The data and\r\ninformation obtained enables the Authority to develop\r\nregulations and recommendations for activities in the\r\nArea on the basis of objective scientific information.\r\nThe proceedings of those workshops are regularly\r\npublished and are available.\r\nIn 2006, the Authority will hold two further\r\nworkshops, the first of which will be held from 27 to\r\n31 March. It will focus on the distribution of potential\r\ncommercial deposits of cobalt-rich ferromanganese\r\ncrusts in the Area, the conditions leading to the\r\nformation of such deposits, an assessment of the\r\npatterns of diversity, endemism and scales of seamount\r\nfaunas, and the factors that appear to drive those\r\npatterns. The workshop will be held in collaboration\r\nwith scientists from the chemosynthetic ecosystems\r\ngroup and the seamounts group of the Census for\r\nMarine Life. The workshop should result in a bio-\r\ngeographic synthesis of seamount fauna based on\r\nresearch conducted by scientists from Australia,\r\nFrance, Japan, New Zealand and the Republic of\r\nKorea. Scientists from other countries will also be\r\ninvited to participate. The second workshop will focus\r\non economic and technological considerations for\r\nmining of polymetallic sulphides and cobalt-rich crusts\r\nand will be held from 31 July to 4 August, the week\r\nimmediately preceding the twelfth session of the\r\nAuthority. That should facilitate participation by\r\nrepresentatives of member States and members of the\r\nLegal and Technical Commission, in addition to the\r\ninvited experts.\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 2 of article 143 of\r\nthe Convention, the Authority is engaged in promoting\r\nmarine scientific research in the deep ocean and, to that\r\nend, it encourages and collaborates with groups of\r\ninternational scientists. It is apparent from those\r\nendeavours that scientists from developing countries\r\nare not involved in such research activities. At this\r\nearly stage in the research and exploration activities in\r\nthe Area, much of the scientific techniques that are\r\nused could also be used for research activities in\r\nnational areas. For example, the DNA techniques being\r\nutilized in the Kaplan project to assess the distribution\r\nof organisms in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, with\r\nwhich the Authority is associated as a sponsor, could\r\nbe readily used for research in the distribution of the\r\nbiodiversity in exclusive economic zones.\r\nIn order to facilitate the participation of scientists\r\nfrom developing countries, who have neither the\r\ncapacity nor the opportunities to benefit from some of\r\nthe advanced techniques in marine scientific research, I\r\nhave proposed to the members of the Authority that a\r\nvoluntary trust fund be established to provide\r\nopportunities for qualified scientists from institutions\r\nin developing countries to participate in research\r\nactivities in the Area conducted by international\r\nscientists and contractors. The training could be\r\nconducted at sea and/or in the laboratories of scientific\r\ninstitutions in advanced countries. In implementing\r\nthat programme, preference would be given to\r\nscientists affiliated with universities or research\r\ninstitutions in developing countries so that the\r\nknowledge and experience gained could be\r\ndisseminated widely through such institutions. That\r\ninitiative for capacity-building received the general\r\napproval of the members of the Authority and they\r\nhave requested that a more detailed proposal on the\r\nestablishment of the voluntary fund and the training\r\nprogramme be presented for consideration at the\r\ntwelfth session. Details on a further proposal to\r\nestablish an endowment fund from the fees paid to the\r\nAuthority by the contractors would also be presented to\r\nthe twelfth session. The income from that fund would\r\nbe used to supplement the voluntary trust funds of the\r\nAuthority.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to express\r\nmy appreciation to members of the Authority that have\r\ncontributed to the voluntary trust fund in order to\r\nenable the participation of members from developing\r\ncountries in the work of the Legal and Technical\r\n24\r\nA/60/PV.55\r\nCommission and the Finance Committee. It is\r\ngratifying to note that the contributions made to the\r\nfund have come from developed and developing\r\ncountries. I appeal to those that have not yet\r\ncontributed to consider doing so, as full participation in\r\nthe institutions of the Authority contributes to its\r\neffective operation.\r\nOne of the difficulties that the Authority\r\ncontinues to encounter is the lack of adequate\r\nparticipation of its member States in its annual\r\nsessions. Although much of the work being carried out\r\nby the Authority has universal effect, especially since\r\nthe rules and regulations being adopted are binding on\r\nmember States, the participation of member States over\r\nthe last few years has been less than one half of the\r\nmembership. That creates procedural difficulties for\r\nthe Assembly of the Authority and impedes its efficient\r\noperation, since the quorum required under the\r\nConvention is a presence of one half of the members.\r\nThis is a matter of serious concern and I am pleased\r\nthat it is addressed in paragraph 30 of the draft\r\nresolution contained in document A/60/L.22.\r\nI would like to appeal to all States members of\r\nthe Authority to attend its annual sessions and\r\nparticipate fully in its work. That is an obligation that\r\nstems from being a party to the Convention. The next\r\nsession of the Authority will be held from 7 to 18\r\nAugust 2006. It is always difficult to arrive at broadly\r\nacceptable dates for the annual sessions. Account has\r\nto be taken of the meetings relating to oceans and the\r\nlaw of the sea being held in New York and elsewhere,\r\nwhich are attended by a core group of the same\r\nparticipants, as well as the availability of conference\r\nservices in the overall programme of meetings of the\r\nUnited Nations. I take note of the concerns expressed\r\nin paragraph 30 of the draft resolution and we will\r\ncontinue consultations with conference services for\r\nmore suitable dates.\r\nSome eight years ago, I advocated in this\r\nAssembly for the establishment of a forum outside the\r\nGeneral Assembly session that would provide more\r\ntime for the in-depth consideration of current issues\r\nrelating to the law of the sea, in particular those arising\r\nfrom the implementation of the Convention. Such a\r\nforum would encourage consistent interpretation and\r\napplication of the Convention and facilitate\r\ncoordination and cooperation in ocean-related activities\r\nbeing carried out in different organizations and bodies.\r\nThe proposal was also designed to bring the\r\nconsideration of oceans and the law of the sea, which\r\nhad diminished after the conclusion of the Third\r\nUnited Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea in\r\n1982, back into the mainstream of activities of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nIt is gratifying that, over the past six years, the\r\nUnited Nations Open-ended Informal Consultative\r\nProcess on Oceans and the Law of the Sea has been\r\nhighly successful in providing an invaluable forum for\r\nthe exchange of views on emerging issues and has\r\nhelped States, international organizations and bodies,\r\nand civil society to consider in some detail the issues\r\nraised in the annual reports of the Secretary-General. It\r\nhas not only enabled the General Assembly to have a\r\nmore focused discussion, but also helped it to re-\r\nestablish its central role in matters relating to the law\r\nof the sea and ocean affairs. Furthermore, in\r\nconsidering the issues arising from the implementation\r\nof the Convention and in addressing new issues that\r\nhave arisen since the Convention was adopted within\r\nthe framework of the Convention and its implementing\r\nagreements, the Informal Consultative Process has\r\ncontributed to the strengthening of the regime for the\r\noceans and the seas contained in the 1982 Convention.\r\nIt is only appropriate, therefore, that the Assembly\r\nshould decide to extend the Informal Consultative\r\nProcess for at least a further three years.\r\nThe President: In accordance with General\r\nAssembly resolution 51/204 of 17 December 1996, I\r\nnow call on the President of the International Tribunal\r\nfor the Law of the Sea.\r\nMr. Wolfrum (International Tribunal for the Law\r\nof the Sea): On behalf of the International Tribunal for\r\nthe Law of the Sea, I wish to express my appreciation\r\nfor the opportunity given to me to address the General\r\nAssembly at its sixtieth session on the occasion of its\r\nannual examination of the item “Oceans and the law of\r\nthe sea”. I extend to you, sir, my personal\r\ncongratulations and those of the Tribunal on your being\r\nelected President of the General Assembly.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to report to\r\nthe General Assembly on the developments which have\r\ntaken place with respect to the Tribunal since the last\r\nmeeting of the General Assembly. I will then make\r\nsome remarks regarding the jurisdiction of the\r\nTribunal.\r\nAs regards organizational matters, I can inform the\r\nGeneral Assembly that, on 22 June 2005, the Meeting of\r\n25\r\nA/60/PV.55\r\nStates Parties elected seven judges to the Tribunal for a\r\nterm of nine years. Two judges of the Tribunal —\r\nJudge Choon-Ho Park of the Republic of Korea and\r\nJudge Dolliver Nelson of Grenada — were re-elected.\r\nThe judges newly elected are Mr. Stanislaw Pawlak of\r\nPoland, Mr. Shunji Yanai of Japan, Mr. Helmut Türk of\r\nAustria, Mr. James Kateka of Tanzania and Mr. Albert\r\nHoffmann of South Africa. They, as well as Judges Park\r\nand Nelson, will serve until 30 September 2014.\r\nIn the course of 2005, the Tribunal held its\r\nnineteenth and twentieth sessions, which were devoted\r\nto legal and judicial matters, as well as administrative\r\nand organizational issues. On 30 September 2005, my\r\npredecessor, Judge Dolliver Nelson, completed his\r\nthree-year term as President of the Tribunal. On 1\r\nOctober 2005, I was elected President of the Tribunal\r\nfor a three-year term and the Tribunal elected Judge\r\nJoseph Akl of Lebanon as Vice-President and Judge\r\nHugo Caminos of Argentina as President of the Seabed\r\nDisputes Chamber.\r\nAs regards its judicial work, in December 2004\r\nthe Tribunal dealt with the Juno Trader case. That was\r\nthe thirteenth case submitted to the Tribunal. It\r\ninvolved urgent proceedings concerning the prompt\r\nrelease of the vessel Juno Trader and its crew under\r\narticle 292 of the Convention. Proceedings were\r\ninstituted on 18 November 2004 by an application filed\r\non behalf of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines against\r\nGuinea-Bissau. The Tribunal delivered its judgment on\r\n18 December 2004. It may be noted that, in keeping\r\nwith its jurisprudence, the Tribunal applied to the Juno\r\nTrader case the various factors relevant to an\r\nassessment of the reasonableness of bonds or other\r\nfinancial security which it had identified in previous\r\njudgments.\r\nI am pleased to state that the judgment of the\r\nTribunal in the Juno Trader case was adopted\r\nunanimously and that the vessel was released pursuant\r\nto the judgment. It is also important to note that, for\r\nthis case, use was made for the first time of the trust\r\nfund which is administered by the United Nations to\r\nassist developing countries in the settlement of\r\ndisputes through the Tribunal.\r\nSince the commencement of its activities in\r\nOctober 1996, 13 cases have been brought before the\r\nTribunal. While the Tribunal has broad jurisdiction\r\nover any dispute regarding the interpretation and\r\napplication of the Convention or any agreement related\r\nto the purposes of the Convention, the majority of those\r\ncases have been confined to instances in which the\r\njurisdiction of the Tribunal is compulsory — the prompt\r\nrelease of vessels and crews and the prescription of\r\nprovisional measures pending the constitution of an\r\narbitral tribunal. It is safe to say that the jurisdictional\r\npowers of the Tribunal have not yet been exhausted.\r\nFor that reason, I would like to thank the sponsors of the\r\ndraft resolution for noting the Tribunal’s continued and\r\nsignificant contribution to the settlement of disputes by\r\npeaceful means in accordance with Part XV of the\r\nConvention and for underlining the important role and\r\nauthority of the Tribunal concerning the interpretation or\r\napplication of the Convention and the Agreement relating\r\nto the Implementation of Part XI of the Convention.\r\nThe jurisdiction of the Tribunal is based not only\r\non the United Nations Convention on the Law of the\r\nSea, but also on any international agreement related to the\r\npurposes of the Convention which specifically confers\r\njurisdiction on the Tribunal. Seven such multilateral\r\nagreements have already been concluded. An important\r\nexample of an international agreement conferring\r\njurisdiction on the Tribunal is the 1995 Agreement for the\r\nImplementation of the Provisions of the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982\r\nrelating to the Conservation and Management of\r\nStraddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks,\r\nwhich provides that any dispute between States parties to\r\nthe Agreement concerning the interpretation or\r\napplication of the Agreement — whether or not they are\r\nalso parties to the law of the sea Convention — is subject\r\nto the mechanism for settling disputes which is set out\r\nin Part XV of the Convention. The straddling fish stocks\r\nAgreement also makes that mechanism applicable to\r\ndisputes concerning subregional, regional or global\r\nfisheries agreements relating to straddling or highly\r\nmigratory fish stocks. It is interesting to note that the\r\nstraddling fish stocks Agreement has modified the\r\nTribunal’s competence to prescribe provisional measures,\r\nsince it allows the Tribunal to prescribe provisional\r\nmeasures not only to protect the rights of the parties,\r\nbut also to prevent damage to the fish stocks in\r\nquestion. Likewise, the Tribunal is empowered to order\r\nprovisional measures pending agreement between\r\ncoastal States and fishing States as concerns the\r\nconservation and management of straddling stocks.\r\nI should also like to draw the Assembly’s\r\nattention to a further international agreement conferring\r\njurisdiction on the Tribunal: the 2001 Convention on\r\n26\r\nA/60/PV.55\r\nthe Protection of Underwater Cultural Heritage.\r\nSimilarly, that Convention applies Part XV of the law\r\nof the sea Convention mutatis mutandis to any dispute\r\nbetween parties to it, whether or not they are parties to\r\nthe law of the sea Convention.\r\nThose international agreements are indeed useful\r\ndevelopments and we would like to encourage States to\r\nconsider making use of the possibility of including\r\nsimilar provisions in future agreements concerning the\r\nlaw of the sea that are the subject of international\r\nnegotiations. I am grateful to the sponsors of the draft\r\nresolution for having noted that States parties to an\r\ninternational agreement related to the purposes of the\r\nConvention may submit to the Tribunal any dispute\r\nconcerning the interpretation or application of that\r\nagreement which is submitted to it in accordance\r\ntherewith.\r\nA provision conferring jurisdiction on the\r\nTribunal could also be included in bilateral agreements\r\nin respect of disputes arising out of the interpretation\r\nor application of the relevant agreement. According to\r\nsuch a provision, a dispute concerning the agreement\r\nshould, at the request of any party to it, be submitted to\r\nthe Tribunal or to an ad hoc chamber of the Tribunal if\r\nthe dispute is not solved by diplomatic means within a\r\ncertain period. The provision could also contain details\r\nof the method of selecting the judges or judges ad hoc\r\nwho would sit in the chamber. In that respect, the\r\nprocedure set out in article 3 of Annex VII to the\r\nConvention could serve as a model.\r\nThe inclusion of such provisions in international\r\nagreements is a fully logical development. It follows a\r\npattern established during the nineteenth century as\r\nregards arbitration and during the twentieth century in\r\nrespect of the International Court of Justice. As for the\r\nTribunal, such a development would certainly enhance\r\nthe central role it plays in the settlement of disputes\r\nregarding law of the sea matters. May I refer, in that\r\nrespect, to a statement made by Mr. Joe Borg,\r\nCommissioner for Fisheries and Maritime Affairs of\r\nthe European Union, on the occasion of his visit to the\r\nTribunal on 2 September 2005. He said that\r\n“the European Union, where appropriate, could\r\nalso offer to include a provision in the\r\nagreements relating to the law of the sea which it\r\nconcludes with third countries binding the parties to\r\nrefer the settlement of any disputes to the\r\nInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea”.\r\nMay I further emphasize that parties may at any\r\ntime conclude a special agreement to submit a dispute\r\nto the Tribunal or to an ad hoc special chamber of the\r\nTribunal, in accordance with article 15, paragraph 2, of\r\nthe Statute. An ad hoc special chamber is a suitable\r\nalternative for parties considering arbitration. In fact,\r\nthe composition of the ad hoc special chamber is\r\ndetermined by the Tribunal with the approval of the\r\nparties, giving them control over the chamber’s\r\ncomposition. The parties are entitled to choose from\r\namong the 21 judges of the Tribunal those whom they\r\nwant to sit in the chamber, while they may also appoint\r\njudges ad hoc if the chamber does not include a\r\nmember of the nationality of the parties. The parties\r\nmay at any time consult with the President of the\r\nTribunal on any questions regarding the composition of\r\nthe chamber. They have at their disposal the rules of\r\nthe Tribunal, which, in particular proceedings, may be\r\namended at their request. In their special agreement,\r\nthe parties may indicate the specific questions upon\r\nwhich the chamber is requested to give a judgment, and\r\na judgment issued by an ad hoc chamber is considered\r\nto have been rendered by the full Tribunal. Finally, the\r\nparties do not have to bear the expenses of proceedings\r\nbefore the Tribunal or one of its chambers.\r\nIn the Case concerning the Conservation and\r\nSustainable Exploitation of Swordfish Stocks in the South-\r\nEastern Pacific Ocean, a case which is still pending on\r\nthe docket, Chile and the European Community have\r\ntaken advantage of the ad hoc system. At their request,\r\nthe Tribunal constituted a chamber composed of five\r\nmembers, four of whom are judges of the Tribunal and\r\none is a judge ad hoc chosen by Chile. It may be\r\nrecalled that by the Tribunal’s Order dated 16\r\nDecember 2003, the time limit for making preliminary\r\nobjections with respect to the case was extended, at the\r\nrequest of the parties, until 1 January 2006 in order to\r\nenable them to reach a settlement.\r\nSo far, the swordfish case is the only one to have\r\nbeen submitted to an ad hoc chamber. In my view, the\r\npotential offered by that alternative, which we call\r\narbitration within the Tribunal, has not yet been fully\r\nrealized. In that connection, I would like to thank the\r\nsponsors of draft resolution A/60/L.22 for noting the\r\npossibility provided for in the Tribunal’s Statute of\r\nsubmitting disputes to a chamber of the Tribunal.\r\nI wish to take this opportunity to draw attention\r\nto the fact that the Seabed Disputes Chamber not only\r\nis competent to deal with disputes regarding activities\r\n27\r\nA/60/PV.55\r\nin the international seabed area but is also empowered\r\nto give advisory opinions. The Chamber can exercise\r\nits advisory competence and give an advisory opinion,\r\nfirst, at the request of the Assembly or the Council of\r\nthe International Seabed Authority “on legal questions\r\narising within the scope of their activities” (Convention\r\non the Law of the Sea, article 191) and secondly, when\r\ncertain procedural requirements are met, at the request\r\nof the Assembly, “on the conformity with [the]\r\nConvention of a proposal before the Assembly on any\r\nmatter” (Convention on the Law of the Sea, article 159,\r\nparagraph 10). Such opinions are given as a matter of\r\nurgency. The advisory jurisdiction, although non-\r\nbinding in nature, could assist the Assembly or the\r\nCouncil of the International Seabed Authority in\r\novercoming any differences in legal opinions which\r\nmay arise as they perform their activities.\r\nIn that respect, I would like to mention that\r\nadvisory proceedings are not limited to matters relating\r\nto Part XI of the Convention. Under article 138 of the\r\nrules of the Tribunal, the Tribunal may also be\r\nrequested to give an advisory opinion on a legal\r\nquestion if an international agreement related to the\r\npurposes of the Convention specifically provides for\r\nthe submission of a request for such an opinion.\r\nThe advisory function of the Tribunal is a\r\nsignificant innovation in the international judicial\r\nsystem, provided it can be given a broad interpretation.\r\nIn that case, it may offer a potential alternative to\r\ncontentious proceedings and could be an interesting\r\noption for those seeking a non-binding opinion on a\r\nlegal question or an indication of how a particular\r\ndispute may be solved through direct negotiations.\r\nSuch proceedings could be of particular assistance to\r\nparties to a dispute in the process of reaching a\r\nsolution by negotiation, for example in maritime\r\ndelimitation cases. It should not be forgotten that\r\nArticle 33 of the United Nations Charter states that\r\nnegotiations are the primary means of settling\r\ninternational disputes.\r\nIn that respect, the parties could ask the Tribunal\r\nto determine the principles and rules of international\r\nlaw applicable to a delimitation dispute and undertake\r\nthereafter to establish the boundary on that basis. The\r\nparties can always specify in the agreement the\r\nquestions upon which the Tribunal would be requested\r\nto render an advisory opinion. Certainly, recourse to\r\nbinding settlement procedures could ultimately also be\r\nmade, if necessary.\r\nThe Tribunal’s advisory function is based on article\r\n21 of the Statute, which states that the jurisdiction of the\r\nTribunal comprises all disputes and all applications\r\nsubmitted to it and all matters specifically provided for in\r\nany other agreement which confers jurisdiction on the\r\nTribunal. Accordingly, future international agreements,\r\npossibly between States or between States and\r\ninternational organizations, could provide for recourse to\r\nthe Tribunal’s advisory procedures. A request for an\r\nadvisory opinion is to be transmitted to the Tribunal by\r\nwhichever body is authorized to make the request in\r\naccordance with the provisions of the relevant\r\ninternational agreement. The term “body” refers to the\r\ncompetent organ of any entity, State or organization that\r\nis empowered under the agreement to submit the request.\r\nAs the Tribunal feels that knowledge of its\r\nprocedures should be widely promoted, it is planning\r\nto hold, during the course of next year, conferences in\r\ndifferent areas of the world to present the work of the\r\nTribunal. Those conferences will benefit from the\r\nparticipation of judges from the corresponding region.\r\nI am glad to report that the Tribunal has taken\r\nfurther steps to develop its relationships with other\r\ninternational organizations and bodies; this year, an\r\nadministrative arrangement was concluded between the\r\nTribunal and the United Nations Environment\r\nProgramme.\r\nI would like to mention that, since November last\r\nyear, eight States have acceded to the Agreement on\r\nthe Privileges and Immunities of the Tribunal, which\r\nbrings the total to 21. In that context, I refer to General\r\nAssembly resolution 59/24, in which the Assembly\r\ncalled upon States that have not yet done so to consider\r\nratifying or acceding to the Agreement. That\r\nrecommendation has also been included in this year’s\r\ndraft resolution. We appreciate that.\r\nAs of 31 October 2005, there was an unpaid\r\nbalance of assessed contributions to the overall budget\r\nof the Tribunal amounting to approximately €2.5\r\nmillion for the period from 1996-1997 to the 2005\r\nbudget of the Tribunal. The Tribunal is aware of the\r\ndifficulties that situation may cause with respect to its\r\nfunctioning. The Registrar will send notes verbales to\r\nthe States parties concerned in December 2005,\r\nreminding them of their outstanding contributions to\r\nthe budget of the Tribunal. We are grateful to the\r\nsponsors of the draft resolution for incorporating an\r\nappeal to States parties in that regard.\r\n28\r\nA/60/PV.55\r\nI wish to draw the attention of representatives to\r\nthe Tribunal’s internship programme and to the grant\r\nprovided by the Korea International Cooperation\r\nAgency for funding the participation of candidates\r\nfrom developing countries in the programme. On\r\nbehalf of the Tribunal, I wish to convey our deep\r\ngratitude to the Korea International Cooperation\r\nAgency for that generous contribution.\r\nMr. President, I should like to conclude by\r\nexpressing my appreciation to you and to\r\nrepresentatives for the opportunity given me to address\r\nthis meeting. I wish also to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, the Legal Counsel and the Director of the\r\nDivision for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea for\r\ntheir support and in particular for their excellent\r\nreports. I should like also to wish the General\r\nAssembly every success in its important deliberations\r\nat this session.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nthe debate on agenda item 75 and its sub-items (a) and\r\n(b).\r\nBefore we proceed further, I should like to\r\nconsult the Assembly with a view to proceeding with\r\nthe consideration of draft resolutions A/60/L.22 and\r\nA/60/L.23 today. Since the draft resolutions have been\r\ncirculated only today, it would be necessary to waive\r\nthe relevant provision of rule 78 of the rules of\r\nprocedure. The relevant provision of rule 78 reads as\r\nfollows:\r\n“As a general rule, no proposal shall be discussed\r\nor put to the vote at any meeting of the General\r\nAssembly unless copies of it have been circulated\r\nto all delegations not later than the day preceding\r\nthe meeting.”\r\nUnless I hear any objection, I shall take it that the\r\nAssembly agrees with this proposal.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: We shall now proceed to consider\r\ndraft resolutions A/60/L.22 and A/60/L.23.\r\nIn connection with draft resolution A/60/L.22, I\r\nwould like to give the floor to the representative of the\r\nSecretariat.\r\nMr. Botnaru (Chief, General Assembly Affairs\r\nBranch): I would like to inform members that under the\r\nterms of operative paragraphs 21, 34, 99 and 101 of\r\ndraft resolution A/60/L.22, the General Assembly\r\nwould, first, request the Secretary-General to convene\r\nthe sixteenth Meeting of States Parties to the\r\nConvention in New York from 19 to 23 June 2006 and\r\nto provide the services required; secondly, approve the\r\nconvening by the Secretary-General of the seventeenth\r\nsession of the Commission in New York from 20 March\r\nto 21 April 2006, and of the eighteenth session of the\r\nCommission from 21 August to 15 September 2006, on\r\nthe understanding that the following periods will be used\r\nfor the technical examination of submissions at the GIS\r\nlaboratories and other technical facilities of the\r\nDivision: 20 to 31 March 2006; 10 to 21 April 2006;\r\n23 August to 5 September 2006; and 11 to 15 September\r\n2006.\r\nThirdly, the General Assembly would also\r\nreaffirm its decision to undertake an annual review and\r\nevaluation of the implementation of the Convention\r\nand other developments relating to ocean affairs and the\r\nlaw of the sea, welcome the work of the Consultative\r\nProcess over the past six years, note the contribution of\r\nthe Consultative Process to strengthening the annual\r\ndebate of the General Assembly on oceans and the law\r\nof the sea, and decide to continue with the Consultative\r\nProcess for the next three years, in accordance with\r\nresolution 54/33, with a further review of its\r\neffectiveness and utility by the Assembly at its sixty-\r\nthird session; and, fourthly, it would request the\r\nSecretary-General to convene the seventh meeting of\r\nthe Consultative Process in New York from 12 to 16\r\nJune 2006, to provide it with the necessary facilities\r\nfor the performance of its work and to arrange for\r\nsupport to be provided by the Division, in cooperation\r\nwith other relevant parts of the Secretariat, as\r\nappropriate.\r\nAs concerns the conference servicing requirements\r\nfor the anticipated meetings referred to in paragraphs 21,\r\n34 and 101, it should be noted that the sessions have\r\nalready been programmed in the draft calendar of\r\nconferences and meetings for 2006. Necessary\r\nresources for servicing those meetings are included in\r\nthe proposed programme budget for 2006-2007.\r\nAccordingly, should the General Assembly adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/60/L.22, no additional requirements\r\nwould arise under the proposed programme budget for\r\nthe biennium 2006-2007.\r\nThe President: I shall now give the floor to those\r\nrepresentatives wishing to speak in explanation of vote\r\nbefore the voting.\r\n29\r\nA/60/PV.55\r\nMay I remind delegations that explanations of\r\nvote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by\r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese):\r\nThe Chinese Government attaches great importance to\r\nthe review conference to be held next year on the 1995\r\nUnited Nations Fish Stocks Agreement as well as to its\r\npreparatory meeting.\r\nHere we would like to register our reservations\r\non the wording contained in operative paragraph 25 of\r\nthe draft resolution (A/60/L.23) on fisheries. The Chinese\r\nGovernment is of the view that the Agreement is a major\r\nextension of the United Nations Convention on the\r\nLaw of the Sea. Its signing and entry into force have had\r\na significant impact on the conservation and management\r\nof fishing resources on the high seas and also on\r\ninternational cooperation in the fishing industry.\r\nThe review conference is intended for the\r\ninternational community, represented by the United\r\nNations, to review the Agreement in order to evaluate\r\nits efficacy in ensuring the conservation and\r\nmanagement of straddling fish stocks and highly\r\nmigratory fish stocks and put forward relevant\r\nrecommendations where necessary. It needs to be\r\nemphasized that this conference is a United Nations\r\nreview conference, not a review conference of the\r\nStates parties. The broad participation, on an equal\r\nfooting, of both States parties and States that are not\r\nparties to the Agreement, as provided for in article 36\r\nof that Agreement, is pivotal to the success of the\r\nreview conference.\r\nThe preparatory meeting for the review\r\nconference is an integral part of the review process.\r\nAlthough it is taking the form of the fifth round of\r\ninformal consultations of States parties to the\r\nAgreement, its objectives and agenda are devoted to\r\nthe review conference.\r\nThe preparatory meeting is a United Nations\r\nmeeting, not just a meeting of the States parties, and\r\ntherefore States that are not parties to the Agreement\r\nshould enjoy rights equal to those of States parties.\r\nWe welcome the wording in operative paragraph\r\n25 inviting States which are not parties to the\r\nAgreement to participate fully on an equal footing with\r\nStates parties and reaffirming that every effort will be\r\nmade to adopt recommendations on the basis of\r\nconsensus.\r\nHowever, we regret to note that the same\r\nparagraph specifies that States that are not parties to\r\nthe Agreement will participate in the meeting without\r\nvoting rights. We believe that this wording tends not\r\nonly to erode the mutual trust between States parties\r\nand State non-parties but also to undermine the rights\r\nof States non-parties and that it is therefore not in the\r\ninterest of broad participation in the review conference\r\nand its preparatory meeting.\r\nThe Chinese Government highly commends the\r\nefforts made by the international community with\r\nrespect to the draft resolution on fisheries. For the\r\nreasons I mentioned earlier, however, we have\r\nreservations relating to the wording contained in\r\noperative paragraph 25 with regard to States non-\r\nparties participating without voting rights. We have\r\ntherefore decided not to join the General Assembly\r\nconsensus on this draft resolution, but we will not\r\nstand in the way of its adoption without a vote.\r\nMr. Erciyes (Turkey): With regard to the two\r\ndraft resolutions before us under agenda item 75,\r\nTurkey will vote against the draft resolution contained\r\nin document A/60/L.22, entitled “Oceans and the law\r\nof the sea”. The reason for my delegation’s negative\r\nvote is that some of the elements contained in the\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea,\r\nwhich have prevented Turkey from approving the\r\nConvention, are again retained in this year’s draft\r\nresolution.\r\nTurkey supports international efforts to establish\r\na regime of the sea based on the principle of equity,\r\nwhich can be acceptable to all States. However, in our\r\nopinion, the Convention does not make adequate\r\nprovision for special geographic situations and, as a\r\nconsequence, is not able to establish an acceptable\r\nbalance between conflicting interests. Furthermore, the\r\nConvention makes no provision for the registering of\r\nreservations on specific clauses.\r\nAlthough Turkey agrees with the Convention in\r\nits general intent, and with most of its provisions, it is\r\nunable to become a party to it because of those serious\r\nshortcomings. That being the case, Turkey cannot\r\nsupport the draft resolution, which also calls on States\r\nto become parties to the Convention and to harmonize\r\ntheir national legislation with its provisions.\r\nAs for the draft resolution on sustainable\r\nfisheries, contained in document A/60/L.23, my\r\ndelegation would like to state that Turkey is fully\r\n30\r\nA/60/PV.55\r\ncommitted to the protection, conservation, management\r\nand sustainable use of marine living resources and\r\nattaches great importance to regional cooperation to\r\nthat end. For that reason, Turkey supports draft\r\nresolution A/60/L.23. However, I would like to\r\nreaffirm once again the position of my country vis-à-\r\nvis the Convention. For the reasons that I have just\r\noutlined, Turkey is not able to consent to certain\r\nreferences to the Convention made in the draft\r\nresolution, in particular operative paragraph 3, in\r\nwhich States are called on to become parties to the\r\nConvention. Turkey therefore disassociates itself from\r\nthe consensus on those particular references.\r\nMr. Journès (France) (spoke in French): I am\r\ntaking the floor with regard to paragraph 46 of the draft\r\nresolution A/60/L.22, “Oceans and the law of the sea”,\r\nunder section VIII, on maritime safety and security.\r\nFrance did not co-sponsor the draft resolution this\r\nyear. France takes note of the concerns that the\r\ntransportation of radioactive materials raises among\r\nsome island States. We regret, however, the specific\r\nfocus on that issue, since safety and security measures\r\nin general should be strengthened for the maritime\r\ntransportation of all hazardous materials and\r\npollutants, particularly hydrocarbons.\r\nFrance, for its part, has on a number of occasions\r\nbeen the victim of accidents, raising questions about\r\nthe maritime transportation of hydrocarbons and its\r\nserious environmental impact. France would like to\r\nstress once again that the maritime transport of\r\nradioactive materials should take place with full\r\nrespect for the international law of the sea and under\r\nthe strictest safety standards, drawn up and regularly\r\nreviewed by the most competent authorities in that\r\nmatter — the International Atomic Energy Agency and\r\nthe International Maritime Organization.\r\nThe safety record with regard to the maritime\r\ntransportation of radioactive material is excellent; no\r\naccident has ever occurred. France is itself a coastal\r\nState and has a direct interest in the greatest possible\r\nrespect for safety and security of such transport.\r\nFinally, France wishes to recall its readiness to\r\nengage in a technical dialogue with the States\r\nconcerned on the question of the safety of the maritime\r\ntransport of radioactive materials. With a view to\r\nenhancing mutual trust, France has already taken part\r\nin many technical consultative meetings with the States\r\nconcerned and has for many years carried out\r\ninformation programmes on a voluntary basis.\r\nThe President: I ask for the indulgence and\r\nunderstanding of members, but there is a technical\r\nproblem that, it seems, cannot be easily resolved,\r\nwhich will result in a delay. As the Assembly knows,\r\nthe interpreters have a deadline in 15 minutes. Given\r\nthat a number of representatives wish to speak in\r\nexplanation of vote and that we still have to take action\r\non the draft resolutions, we will not make the deadline.\r\nI therefore intend to adjourn the meeting now. We will\r\ntake up this item again tomorrow morning at 10 a.m.,\r\nbefore moving on to agenda item 17 and sub-item (e)\r\nof item 73.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.15 p.m.\r\n"
