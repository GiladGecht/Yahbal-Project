(Sweden)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.15 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 15\r\nQuestion of Palestine\r\nReport of the Committee on the Exercise of the\r\nInalienable Rights of the Palestinian People\r\n(A/60/35)\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/60/539)\r\nDraft resolutions (A/60/L.28, A/60/L.29,\r\nA/60/L.30 and A/60/L.31)\r\nThe President: This morning, I had the honour to\r\naddress the Committee on the Exercise of the\r\nInalienable Rights of the Palestinian People on the\r\noccasion of the commemoration of the International\r\nDay of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. I\r\nrecalled the United Nations permanent responsibility\r\nwith regard to the question of Palestine until the\r\nquestion is resolved in all its aspects in accordance\r\nwith international law, as stated in resolution 59/31.\r\nIndeed, solidarity with the Palestinian people is an\r\nintrinsic part of our common responsibility to support\r\nthe Middle East peace process.\r\nIt is in that context that the General Assembly, in\r\nthe same resolution of last year, recalled the relevant\r\nSecurity Council resolutions and welcomed the\r\naffirmation by the Security Council of the vision of a\r\nregion in which two States, Israel and Palestine, live\r\nside by side within secure and recognized borders. That\r\nconstitutes the foundation for the peace process.\r\nLet me also use this occasion to express\r\nappreciation to all Governments, regional\r\norganizations, United Nations agencies, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and individuals for their\r\nuntiring work and dedication to achieving lasting peace\r\nand security in the Middle East and to providing\r\nhumanitarian and economic assistance to the\r\nPalestinian people.\r\nWe must spare no effort to assist both Israel and\r\nthe Palestinian Authority to achieve a comprehensive,\r\njust and lasting solution to decades of Palestinian-\r\nIsraeli confrontation and conflict.\r\nI was particularly gratified to hear this morning\r\nthe message of the President of the Palestinian\r\nAuthority, Mr. Mahmoud Abbas, to the Committee on\r\nthe Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian\r\nPeople, in which he stated that the Palestinian\r\nAuthority has “chosen peace and negotiations as the\r\npath to reaching a just and comprehensive peace”. And,\r\nhe added, “our hands remain outstretched for peace”.\r\nThis year has already marked some real progress.\r\nThe Palestinian people demonstrated their commitment\r\nto democracy during the presidential election in\r\nJanuary. The international community welcomed the\r\nIsraeli withdrawal and dismantlement of settlements in\r\nthe Gaza Strip and parts of the northern West Bank in\r\nthe late summer. Last week, on 25 November,\r\nfollowing an agreement by both sides on movement\r\n2\r\nA/60/PV.57\r\nand access, the President of the Palestinian Authority\r\nformally reopened the Gaza Strip’s border crossing\r\nwith Egypt, thus giving the Palestinians control over\r\none of their frontiers for the first time in their history.\r\nAn important step was thus taken to fulfil the vision of\r\na future Palestinian State.\r\nAll those who made that possible through\r\npainstaking and complicated negotiations, with\r\npersistence and tenacity of effort, are to be\r\ncommended. The parties are encouraged to continue\r\ntheir cooperation on outstanding issues related to\r\ndisengagement, supported by the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nThe road map, supported by the Quartet, provides\r\na solid basis for the continued work for peace. The\r\ninternational community must intensify its engagement\r\nin helping the parties to end a conflict which for far too\r\nlong has tormented the region and its peoples. It is\r\ncrucial that Palestinians and Israelis now cooperate to\r\nthe fullest extent possible. Actions which could\r\naggravate the situation and increase suspicions and\r\nmistrust must not be undertaken. Violence and acts of\r\nterror must cease.\r\nIn the meantime, everything must be done to\r\nalleviate the daily plight of the Palestinian people.\r\nAccess and mobility are crucial for dealing with\r\nunemployment and poverty. International assistance\r\nshould focus not only on humanitarian relief, but also\r\non capacity-building programmes as part of a\r\ndevelopment strategy for a future Palestinian State.\r\nLet us hope and let us be determined that, with\r\nthe full backing of the United Nations and the world\r\ncommunity, the peace process will be reactivated so\r\nthat we can finally see the realization of the vision of a\r\nregion in which two States, Israel and Palestine, face\r\nthe future together in peace and cooperation.\r\nI give the floor to Mr. Paul Badji of Senegal, in\r\nhis capacity as Chairman of the Committee on the\r\nExercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian\r\nPeople, who will introduce draft resolutions A/60/L.28\r\nto A/60/L.31 in the course of his statement.\r\nMr. Badji (Senegal) (spoke in French): In order\r\nto express their unswerving support for the Palestinian\r\npeople in its quest for a comprehensive, just and lasting\r\nsolution to the question of Palestine, many\r\nrepresentatives of Member States, observer States,\r\nintergovernmental organizations, agencies of the\r\nUnited Nations system and civil society organizations\r\nresponded this morning to the invitation of the\r\nCommittee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of\r\nthe Palestinian People and participated in the solemn\r\nmeeting that was held, as it is every year on\r\n29 November, to observe the International Day of\r\nSolidarity with the Palestinian People. As Chairman of\r\nthe Committee, I thank them all for their keen interest,\r\nstaunch support and active participation in the quest for\r\na peaceful settlement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\r\nBefore I introduce the four draft resolutions that\r\nhave been submitted by the Committee under agenda\r\nitem 37 of the sixtieth session of the General\r\nAssembly, I should like to make a few brief comments\r\nabout the situation in the occupied Palestinian territory\r\nand developments in the political process.\r\nThe past year has been marked by promise and\r\nhope, as well as by one development in the situation on\r\nthe ground that has further complicated efforts to\r\nrevive the political process for the implementation of\r\nthe road map. The death more than a year ago of the\r\nnational leader Yasser Arafat has posed a real\r\nchallenge for the Palestinian people and its institutions.\r\nThe transition was democratic and peaceful, and\r\nfollowing free and fair elections, Mr. Mahmoud Abbas\r\nwas elected President of the Palestinian Authority.\r\nWith the assistance of the international community, and\r\nparticularly that of Egypt, the first summit meeting to\r\nbe held in a long time was convened in February 2004\r\nin Sharm el-Sheikh between the Prime Minister of\r\nIsrael, Mr. Ariel Sharon, and the President of the\r\nPalestinian Authority, Mr. Abbas. The commitments\r\nundertaken by the two parties — especially with regard\r\nto the cessation of all acts of violence, the return to\r\nPalestinian Authority control of five Palestinian towns\r\nof the West Bank, and the release of a number of\r\nPalestinian prisoners — have created a new momentum\r\nconducive to the resumption of the political process.\r\nIn September, the Committee welcomed Israel’s\r\nwithdrawal from the Gaza Strip and from four\r\nsettlements in the northern West Bank. The Committee\r\ndeemed the withdrawal to be one of the most\r\nsignificant political developments of recent years in the\r\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict and recognized the resolute\r\nefforts of the Palestinian Authority to coordinate the\r\nwithdrawal with the Israeli side in order to ensure the\r\nsmooth management of the new situation created\r\nthereby. That positive development was helpful in the\r\nresumption of security coordination between the\r\n3\r\nA/60/PV.57\r\nparties and gave rise to hope that could be exploited\r\nand built on to secure better cooperation between the\r\nIsraelis and the Palestinians.\r\nA very broad sector of international opinion held\r\nthat the withdrawal from Gaza was a promising stage\r\nthat could help to relaunch negotiations within the\r\nframework of the road map and advance the political\r\nprocess that had long been deadlocked. Committee\r\nmembers believe that the withdrawal from Gaza should\r\nbe complete and irreversible, and enable the\r\nPalestinian Authority to exercise control over Gaza’s\r\nborders, air and maritime spaces, and the transit points\r\nbetween that part of the territory and the rest of\r\nPalestine. They also deem it essential to obtain Israeli\r\nguarantees concerning the unimpeded circulation of\r\npersons and goods in and out of Gaza.\r\nThe building and use of a maritime port and an\r\nairport, as well as the establishment of a permanent\r\ngeographic link to the West Bank, are absolutely\r\ncrucial to Gaza’s economy. It is precisely for those\r\nreasons that we welcomed the agreements concluded\r\non 15 November between Israel and the Palestinian\r\nAuthority on movement and access from and to Gaza.\r\nIt is now crucial that those agreements be scrupulously\r\nand promptly implemented in order to give Palestinians\r\nand Israelis alike a sense of hope and progress\r\nfollowing the positive developments of recent months.\r\nFurthermore, the Committee remains profoundly\r\nconcerned about the intensified expansion of\r\nsettlement activity in the West Bank, including in East\r\nJerusalem, and the accelerated construction of the\r\nillegal wall in the occupied Palestinian territory.\r\nSettlement activities have been accompanied by\r\ndisturbing information concerning plans to establish\r\npermanent links between several West Bank\r\nsettlements, particularly in East Jerusalem and its\r\nenvirons. All of that runs counter to Israel’s obligations\r\nunder the road map, which calls for a freeze in the\r\nbuilding of settlements. Israel’s policy and the facts\r\nthat it has created on the ground are also violations of\r\ninternational law and of the advisory opinion of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice.\r\nMoreover, Israel’s ongoing incursions into urban\r\nand rural Palestinian centres throughout the year,\r\nextrajudicial executions, demolition of homes, arrests\r\nand other actions, as well as the violent reprisals they\r\nhave provoked — including four suicide bombings —\r\njeopardize the hope for a speedy return to political\r\ndialogue. Those actions have also had a harmful effect\r\non the positive momentum created by Israel’s\r\nwithdrawal from Gaza and the Sharm el-Sheikh\r\nagreements concluded between the Palestinian and\r\nIsraeli sides early in the year.\r\nAt this critical juncture, on behalf of the\r\nCommittee, I call on the Government of Israel to\r\nrefrain from taking any action that might further\r\ndestabilize the situation. Israel must, in particular,\r\nrenounce its policy of developing settlements and halt\r\nthe construction of the wall on the West Bank. It is to\r\nbe hoped that Israel will facilitate the preparations for\r\nand holding of the forthcoming elections for the\r\nPalestinian Legislative Council scheduled for January\r\n2006, in which the Palestinians of East Jerusalem must\r\nbe able to participate fully. Furthermore, Israel must\r\ntake steps to improve significantly the humanitarian\r\nsituation of Palestinians by lifting curfews and\r\nreducing restrictions on the movement of people and\r\ngoods.\r\nThe international community’s readiness to help\r\nthe parties in that complex process, leading to a\r\nresumption of direct negotiations, has been\r\nencouraging. The Committee welcomes the efforts of\r\nthe Quartet and by each of its members to help the\r\nparties to move towards the implementation of the road\r\nmap. The appointment of Mr. James Wolfensohn as the\r\nQuartet’s Special Envoy was crucial to facilitating\r\neconomic and logistic measures that are essential to\r\nimproving the daily lives of the Palestinian population\r\nof Gaza. We recognize in particular the personal\r\ncontribution of Mr. Wolfensohn to that task.\r\nInternational donors have pledged substantial financial\r\ncontributions to improve the economic and social\r\nsituation in Gaza following the Israeli withdrawal. The\r\nEuropean Union is prepared to provide a third-party\r\npresence at the Rafah crossing.\r\nOur Committee firmly believes that the United\r\nNations should continue to exercise its permanent\r\nresponsibility over the question of Palestine until it is\r\neffectively resolved in all of its aspects. Ultimately,\r\nonly the implementation of United Nations\r\nresolutions — in particular Security Council\r\nresolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973), 1397 (2002) and\r\n1515 (2003) — will guarantee a permanent solution\r\nconsisting in the creation of two States and based on\r\nthe 1967 borders and the exercise of the inalienable\r\nrights of the Palestinian people to independence and\r\nnational sovereignty.\r\n4\r\nA/60/PV.57\r\nThis month, the Committee on the Exercise of the\r\nInalienable Rights of the Palestinian People\r\ncommemorated the thirtieth anniversary of its\r\nestablishment by the General Assembly. Members of\r\nthe Committee are aware that some Member States are\r\nquestioning its raison d’être and that some are critical\r\nof its activities, which they deem to be imbalanced and\r\npartial. In that regard, allow me respectfully to remind\r\nthose that offer such critiques that the Committee is the\r\nonly intergovernmental body of the United Nations\r\ndealing solely with the political aspects of the question\r\nof Palestine. It was created by the General Assembly\r\nspecifically to promote the exercise by the Palestinian\r\npeople of its inalienable rights in order to arrive at a\r\ncomprehensive, just and lasting solution to the question\r\nof Palestine.\r\nUnfortunately, progress in that respect has been\r\nvery slow, at best, notwithstanding certain positive\r\ndevelopments. The situation on the ground remains\r\nmost unstable and the occupation of Palestinian land\r\ncontinues, with all its repercussions. Thanks to its\r\ninteraction with the main organs of the United Nations,\r\nin particular the Security Council and the General\r\nAssembly; thanks to its contacts with Member States\r\nand intergovernmental organizations; and thanks to the\r\nSecretariat’s Division for Palestinian Rights and the\r\nassistance it provides through its programme of\r\ninternational meetings and conferences, its\r\npublications, its updating of the United Nations\r\nInformation System on the Question of Palestine — a\r\nunique and rich electronic resource containing\r\nthousands of United Nations documents on this issue—\r\nand its cooperation with civil society, the Committee\r\nbelieves that it is raising international public awareness\r\nof all aspects of the question of Palestine and\r\npromoting the inalienable rights of the Palestinian\r\npeople.\r\nFurthermore, as a concrete and practical means of\r\nsupport, since 1996 the Committee’s programme of\r\nwork has included an annual training programme for\r\nofficials and professionals of the Palestinian Authority.\r\nTwenty young Palestinians, specializing in various\r\nfields, have acquired in-depth knowledge of the United\r\nNations system and work undertaken on the question of\r\nPalestine. That very useful programme, organized by\r\nthe Division for Palestinian Rights, has been frequently\r\ncommended by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nPalestinian Authority.\r\nSince its establishment, the Committee has\r\nadvocated for a peaceful solution to the question of\r\nPalestine, pursuant to the principles of international\r\nlaw. It welcomed the peace process launched in the\r\nMiddle East in 1991 at the Madrid peace conference,\r\nand subsequently actively encouraged the parties’\r\nimplementation of the Oslo Accords. It gave its full\r\nsupport to the road map initiated by the Quartet in\r\norder to realize the vision of two States, Israel and\r\nPalestine, living side by side within secure and\r\nrecognized borders. At the same time, and pursuant to\r\nits mandate, the Committee continues to promote the\r\nfull exercise of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian\r\npeople and to mobilize international assistance on\r\nbehalf of the Palestinian people and solidarity with it.\r\nIn that context, I should like to introduce to the\r\nGeneral Assembly the four draft resolutions adopted by\r\nthe Committee, the texts of which have been circulated\r\nunder agenda item 37 in documents A/60/L.28,\r\nA/60/L.29, A/60/L.30 and A/60/L.31. The Lao\r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic has joined the list of\r\nsponsors of draft resolution A/60/L.28 and Namibia is\r\nnow a sponsor of all four draft resolutions.\r\nThe first three draft resolutions relate\r\nrespectively to the work of the Committee on the\r\nExercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian\r\nPeople, the Division for Palestinian Rights and the\r\nDepartment of Public Information. They reaffirm the\r\nimportant mandates entrusted by the General Assembly\r\nto that subsidiary body and those Secretariat structures.\r\nAs it has in the past, the Committee intends to ensure\r\nthat the resources made available to it are used\r\neffectively for all of its mandated tasks. The three draft\r\nresolutions have been duly updated.\r\nThe fourth draft resolution, entitled “Peaceful\r\nsettlement of the Palestinian question”, reiterates the\r\nGeneral Assembly’s position vis-à-vis the essential\r\nelements of such a settlement and refers to\r\ndevelopments in the situation over the course of the\r\npast year. In particular, this year’s draft stresses the\r\nneed for the implementation of the Sharm el-Sheikh\r\nunderstandings concluded between Israel and Palestine\r\nin February 2005 and to put an end to Israeli settlement\r\nactivities in the Gaza Strip and parts of the northern\r\nWest Bank.\r\nThe four draft resolutions that I have just\r\nintroduced outline positions, mandates and\r\nprogrammes that are of special importance, particularly\r\n5\r\nA/60/PV.57\r\nat this critical stage. I appeal to members of the\r\nGeneral Assembly to vote in favour of the draft\r\nresolutions and to support the important objectives\r\ncontained therein.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to Mr. Colin\r\nScicluna, who will introduce the report of the\r\nCommittee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of\r\nthe Palestinian People on behalf of the Committee’s\r\nRapporteur.\r\nMr. Scicluna (Malta): It is an honour for me to\r\npresent to the General Assembly, on behalf of the\r\nRapporteur of the Committee on the Exercise of the\r\nInalienable Rights of the Palestinian People,\r\nAmbassador Victor Camilleri, the annual report of the\r\nCommittee, contained in document A/60/35.\r\nIn the course of the past year, the Committee has\r\ncontinued to carry out the mandate given to it by the\r\nGeneral Assembly. The report I am about to present\r\ncovers developments relating to the question of\r\nPalestine, the peace process and the activities of the\r\nCommittee since last year’s report, through 5 October\r\nof this year.\r\nThe introduction of the report outlines the\r\nCommittee’s objectives and its general perspective of\r\nevents that have taken place in the course of the year.\r\nChapters II and III summarize the General\r\nAssembly mandates of the Committee, the Division for\r\nPalestinian Rights and the Department of Public\r\nInformation, and give an account of the organization of\r\nthe Committee’s work during the year.\r\nChapter IV reviews the situation relating to the\r\nquestion of Palestine and the relevant political\r\ndevelopments, as monitored by the Committee during\r\nthe year. Reviewed here are various aspects of the\r\nsituation on the ground, including the passing of the\r\nPalestinian Authority President, Mr. Yasser Arafat, in\r\nNovember 2004; the election of Mr. Mahmoud Abbas\r\nas Palestinian Authority President; Israeli actions in the\r\noccupied Palestinian territory, such as the recent\r\ndisengagement from the Gaza Strip and four\r\nsettlements in the northern West Bank; the expanding\r\nsettlement activities; the implications of the ongoing\r\nconstruction of the wall in the West Bank and around\r\nEast Jerusalem; the situation with respect to Palestinian\r\nprisoners; the humanitarian situation and the state of\r\nthe Palestinian economy; the situation with respect to\r\nwater resources available to the Palestinians; action by\r\nthe United Nations system; and the continuing\r\noperational difficulties faced by the United Nations\r\nRelief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the\r\nNear East. In this Chapter, the Committee also states\r\nits position with regard to extrajudicial executions of\r\nPalestinians and terrorist attacks against Israeli\r\ncivilians.\r\nChapter V reviews the action taken by the\r\nCommittee. It is divided into two main sections.\r\nSection A describes action aimed at promoting\r\nPalestinian rights in the United Nations, including the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council. This\r\nsection makes reference to the communications\r\naddressed by the Chairman of the Committee to the\r\nSecretary-General and the President of the Security\r\nCouncil, and includes information on the participation\r\nby the Chairman at events organized by civil society in\r\nsupport of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian\r\npeople.\r\nSection B contains a detailed account of the\r\nimplementation of the programme of work of the\r\nCommittee and the Division. It provides information\r\non the continued dialogue between the Committee and\r\nmembers of the European Union and the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union. Sub-section 1 gives an account\r\nof the various international meetings and conferences\r\norganized in the course of the year.\r\nThis section also deals with the Committee’s\r\ncooperation with intergovernmental organizations and\r\ncivil society; research, monitoring and publications\r\nwork of the Division; the United Nations Information\r\nSystem on the Question of Palestine (UNISPAL); the\r\ntraining programme for staff of the Palestinian\r\nAuthority; and the observance of the International Day\r\nof Solidarity with the Palestinian People.\r\nChapter VI provides an overview of the work\r\ndone over the year by the Department of Public\r\nInformation in pursuance of General Assembly\r\nresolution 59/30 of 1 December 2004.\r\nThe last chapter of the report contains the\r\nconclusions and recommendations of the Committee.\r\nIn this Chapter, the Committee welcomes the Israeli\r\nwithdrawal from the Gaza Strip and four small\r\nsettlements in the northern West Bank as a rare window\r\nof opportunity that should be used to revive\r\nnegotiations within the framework of the road map and\r\nmove the stalled political process forward. It expresses\r\nparticular concern about the intention of the Israeli\r\n6\r\nA/60/PV.57\r\nGovernment to expand large settlement blocks in the\r\nWest Bank, isolating East Jerusalem from the West\r\nBank and separating the southern West Bank from its\r\nnorthern part. The Committee reiterates its position of\r\nprinciple that the settlements and the wall constructed\r\nby Israel in the occupied Palestinian territory, including\r\nEast Jerusalem, are contrary to international\r\nhumanitarian law and numerous resolutions of the\r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly adopted\r\nsince 1967, as well as provisions of the road map.\r\nThe Committee states that it has been encouraged\r\nby renewed efforts of the international community to\r\nrevitalize the road map, to facilitate the dialogue\r\nbetween the parties and to implement their\r\ncommitments under the road map. The Committee\r\naffirms its intention to continue to promote support for\r\nthe road map and the important work of the Quartet as\r\nthe best way to achieve a comprehensive, just and\r\nlasting solution of the question of Palestine based on\r\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973),\r\n1397 (2002) and other relevant resolutions, and the\r\nexercise by the Palestinian people of its inalienable\r\nrights.\r\nThe Committee expresses its appreciation to\r\nGovernments, intergovernmental organizations, United\r\nNations entities and civil society for their involvement\r\nin its programmes of international meetings and\r\nconferences. It expresses its intention to address such\r\nissues as the need to end the occupation of all\r\nPalestinian land; support of the Palestinian Authority’s\r\nefforts to rehabilitate the economy, especially that of\r\nthe Gaza Strip; the responsibility of all Governments to\r\napply international law to all aspects of the question of\r\nPalestine; the adverse consequences of the settlement\r\npolicy and the construction of the wall for the\r\nachievement of a two-State solution.\r\nThe Committee further commends civil society\r\norganizations for their efforts to uphold international\r\nlegitimacy with regard to the question of Palestine\r\nthrough advocacy and by mobilizing public opinion, as\r\nwell as for their unremitting initiatives to provide relief\r\nand assistance to the Palestinian people.\r\nThe Committee stresses the essential contribution\r\nof the Division for Palestinian Rights of the Secretariat\r\nin support of the Committee’s objectives and requests\r\nit to continue its programme of publications and other\r\ninformational activities, including the further\r\ndevelopment of the UNISPAL documents collection.\r\nThe Committee also notes the usefulness of the annual\r\ntraining programme for staff of the Palestinian\r\nAuthority, in spite of the difficulties on the ground, and\r\nrequests the Division to continue it.\r\nThe Committee expresses the view that the\r\nspecial information programme on the question of\r\nPalestine of the Department of Public Information has\r\nmade an important contribution to informing the media\r\nand public opinion on the relevant issues. The\r\nCommittee requests the programme’s continuation,\r\nwith the necessary flexibility, as warranted by\r\ndevelopments relevant to the question of Palestine.\r\nFinally, wishing to make its contribution to the\r\nachievement of a just and lasting settlement of the\r\nquestion of Palestine and in view of the many\r\ndifficulties facing the Palestinian people and besetting\r\nthe peace process, the Committee calls on all States to\r\njoin in that endeavour and invites the General\r\nAssembly again to recognize the importance of its role\r\nand to reconfirm its mandate with overwhelming\r\nsupport.\r\nI trust that the report I have just introduced will\r\nbe of assistance to the General Assembly in its\r\ndeliberations on this very important issue.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the\r\nChairman of the observer delegation of Palestine.\r\nMr. Al-Kidwa (Palestine) (spoke in Arabic): I\r\nshould like at the outset to thank you, Sir, for your\r\nstatements earlier at this meeting and at this morning’s\r\nofficial meeting in observance of the International Day\r\nof Solidarity with the Palestinian People.\r\nA few weeks ago, the Committee on the Exercise\r\nof the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People\r\ncommemorated the thirtieth anniversary of its\r\nestablishment by the General Assembly. That occasion\r\nembodied a great many of the issues related to the\r\nquestion of Palestine. It highlighted the permanent\r\nresponsibility of the United Nations on the question of\r\nPalestine until its resolution in all its aspects, and the\r\ncommitment of the members of the Committee to fulfil\r\nthe mandate entrusted to them.\r\nIt also highlighted, however, the tragic reality\r\nthat the Palestinian people, despite the passage of so\r\nmany years and the positions of the United Nations and\r\nits various organs, is still being denied its inalienable\r\nrights, particularly its right to self-determination and\r\nnational independence, all as a result of Israel’s\r\n7\r\nA/60/PV.57\r\nrejection of the will of the international community and\r\nof international law, and its ongoing colonization of\r\nPalestinian land.\r\nIt is difficult, if not impossible, to imagine a\r\nsimilar case in which an entire people has been living\r\neither in exile for 57 years or under occupation for 38\r\nyears and subject to a de facto colonial settlement\r\ncampaign, while the occupying Power continues to\r\nrefuse to implement any of the numerous resolutions of\r\nthe United Nations and continues to violate\r\ninternational law, including international humanitarian\r\nand human rights laws.\r\nWe wish to express our deep appreciation to the\r\nChairman of the Committee and its members, and call\r\non the States Members of the United Nations to\r\nmaintain their support in the face of Israel’s\r\nintransigence and rejection in order to resolve the\r\nquestion of Palestine and achieve genuine peace based\r\non the two-State solution and the 1949 Armistice Line\r\nor what are commonly referred to as the 1967 borders,\r\nwith East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine.\r\nIf that is to occur, the central task of the\r\ninternational community must be to achieve a real\r\ncessation of the colonizing of Palestinian territory,\r\nwhich is being pursued through the construction and\r\nexpansion of settlements and the building of a wall on\r\nPalestinian land, including in and around East\r\nJerusalem. Israel continues to construct settlements in\r\ndefiance of the provisions of international law; of\r\nrelevant United Nations resolutions, including those of\r\nthe Security Council; and of the peace process and the\r\nprovisions of the road map. Israel continues to build its\r\nwall despite the advisory opinion issued by the\r\nInternational Court of Justice and the resolutions\r\nadopted by the General Assembly at its tenth\r\nemergency special session. Israel also continues to take\r\nillegal measures in and around East Jerusalem aimed at\r\nthe Judaization and de facto annexation of the city,\r\ndespite all of the foregoing.\r\nIsrael has thus been striving relentlessly to create\r\nconditions on the ground that, if allowed to persist,\r\nthreaten to close the window of opportunity to achieve\r\nthe two-State solution. Israel alone will be responsible\r\nfor the collapse of the solution, but all of us —\r\nbeginning, of course, with the Palestinian people —\r\nwill pay the price. It is incumbent upon the\r\ninternational community to prevent that from\r\nhappening and to safeguard the two-State solution. The\r\nfirst step must be to halt the settlement activities, the\r\nconstruction of the wall, and the Israeli measures in\r\nEast Jerusalem.\r\nIn September, Israel carried out its\r\ndisengagement plan in the Gaza Strip and parts of the\r\nnorthern West Bank. We consider that action to be an\r\nimportant development, and believe that the cessation\r\nof the colonization of parts of our Palestinian land,\r\nthrough the dismantling of the settlements and the\r\nwithdrawal of the settlers and the Israeli occupying\r\nforces from the Gaza Strip, is a positive development\r\npotentially leading to others. However, the\r\ndisengagement plan remains unilateral and Israel, in\r\nimplementing it, wrought widespread destruction in the\r\nsettlement areas and left many important issues\r\nunresolved, including those of the checkpoints, the\r\nairport, the seaport and the link between the West Bank\r\nand the Gaza Strip.\r\nDespite all that, agreement was recently reached\r\non some of these important issues, first and foremost\r\nthat of the Rafah crossing between the Gaza Strip and\r\nEgypt — an agreement which we hope will be\r\nimplemented in full and appropriately and will lead to\r\nagreement on all the other pending issues. That is\r\ncrucial to improving the living conditions of the\r\npopulation of the Gaza Strip, a small and impoverished\r\nregion that is the most densely populated in the world.\r\nWe are also in urgent need of more assistance and\r\nits expeditious delivery in order to bear our additional\r\nburdens, not only in the Gaza Strip, but also in the\r\nWest Bank, including East Jerusalem. We wish to\r\ncommend the efforts of the Special Envoy of the\r\nQuartet, Mr. James Wolfensohn, to secure that\r\nassistance and to help the two parties to reach\r\nappropriate solutions.\r\nOf great importance now, in addition to all of the\r\nforegoing, is guaranteeing that developments will not\r\nstop with the Gaza Strip. There must be a real\r\nopportunity to return to the road map, beginning with\r\nthe implementation of the Sharm el-Sheikh\r\nunderstandings, including an Israeli withdrawal from\r\ncities and areas to pre-September 2000 positions and\r\nthe release of Palestinian prisoners and detainees. I\r\nreiterate that, whether or not we succeed in returning to\r\nthe road map, we must definitely ensure the genuine\r\ncessation of settlement activities, the construction of\r\nthe wall and other Israeli measures in Jerusalem. That\r\n8\r\nA/60/PV.57\r\nis all mandatory under international law and essential\r\nto the preservation of any hope for peace.\r\nTo that end, we need the Quartet to adopt specific\r\nand practical positions and an agreement on measures\r\nto be taken by Member States. We need action from\r\neveryone, including the Secretariat, which should, inter\r\nalia, implement the General Assembly resolution on\r\nthe preparation of a register of damages caused by the\r\nconstruction of the wall.\r\nThe Palestinian people, the Palestinian Authority\r\nand the Palestinian leadership find themselves\r\nshouldering the responsibility of fulfilling post-conflict\r\ntasks while remaining, in their entirety, under foreign\r\noccupation and subject to the ongoing colonization of\r\ntheir land. Such a situation has never arisen before and\r\nthere is no precedent to draw upon. Nevertheless, we\r\nare making extraordinary efforts to succeed and have\r\nachieved reasonable results thanks to the resolve and\r\nimagination of our people, international political\r\nsupport and foreign assistance.\r\nWe are making efforts to build State institutions\r\nin order to achieve the rule of law and to strengthen the\r\nsocial fabric of our people. We are also in the process\r\nof filling the large vacuum left behind by the passing\r\nof our leader, President Yasser Arafat, and have\r\nmanaged to achieve a smooth transition of power and\r\nto hold new presidential elections that resulted in the\r\nelection of President Mahmoud Abbas and his\r\nassumption of his duties.\r\nIn that context, we are also in the process of\r\nholding our second legislative elections. We wish to\r\nemphasize our opposition to any interference by Israel\r\nor any other party in those elections, which should be\r\ntruly democratic and open to all Palestinians and all\r\npolitical groups and should be held throughout the\r\noccupied Palestinian territories, including East\r\nJerusalem. The participation of all parties and groups\r\nwill enhance the democratic process and the rule of\r\nlaw, and should be combined with and followed by\r\nmeasures and laws to consolidate the political system,\r\nincluding in areas related to weapons and other\r\nsecurity issues.\r\nIsrael should not create obstacles to any of those\r\nimportant political processes, in particular with regard\r\nto freedom of movement and the participation of the\r\ninhabitants of Jerusalem. Through a responsible\r\nnational dialogue, we have been able to reach\r\nagreement on a unilateral approach to promoting calm\r\nand we understand the need to continue that process. In\r\nthat regard, we believe the elections will have a\r\npositive impact.\r\nAs part of the international community, we\r\nreiterate our condemnation of terrorism in all its forms,\r\nincluding the latest terrorist attacks in the Jordanian\r\ncapital, Amman. It so happens that one of the victims\r\nof the attacks was a colleague of ours from the Foreign\r\nMinistry. We must enhance our collective efforts to\r\nconfront that phenomenon and must fortify our will\r\nthrough a clear and strong legal framework supported\r\nby all. We must all agree that any targeting of innocent\r\ncivilians, anywhere at any time, regardless of the\r\nreasons, constitutes a condemnable terrorist act that we\r\nmust combat.\r\nWe must also all agree that cases of armed\r\nconflict, including foreign occupation, are governed by\r\ninternational humanitarian law and are in accordance\r\nwith those rules and provisions. We are convinced of\r\nthose positions and will work tirelessly to achieve full\r\ncompliance with all of those rules and provisions,\r\nincluding in our region. We also hope to contribute to\r\nthe achievement of a consensus among all parties\r\nconcerned to conclude a comprehensive convention to\r\ncombat international terrorism.\r\nWe must save our region from future\r\nconfrontations and conflicts. We are working hard to\r\nensure that the Palestinian element in the region is\r\npositive. In that context, we wish Lebanon every\r\nsuccess and prosperity and reaffirm that Palestinians in\r\nLebanon are not party to any internal issues and that\r\nthey are not above the law.\r\nWe also hope that Syria will be able to solve the\r\nproblems related to Security Council resolution 1636\r\n(2005) in a way that helps the investigation and\r\npreserves the dignity and sovereignty of Syria on the\r\nbasis of respect for that resolution.\r\nNaturally, we look forward to the return to\r\nnormalcy in Iraq and to ending the violence and\r\nterrorism, while at the same time preserving Iraqi\r\nunity, sovereignty and territorial integrity.\r\nThere have been many extraordinary\r\ndevelopments in the region, including in our country\r\nand in Israel. We hope those developments will\r\nenhance the potential for a speedy return to\r\nnegotiations and to the actual implementation of the\r\nroad map towards the achievement of peace in and\r\n9\r\nA/60/PV.57\r\nbetween two States, Israel and Palestine, as well as in\r\nthe region and in the world in its entirety.\r\nMr. Al-Shamsi (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in\r\nArabic): On behalf of the delegation of the United\r\nArab Emirates, I am honoured to express to Mr. Paul\r\nBadji, Chairman of the Committee on the Exercise of\r\nthe Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, to\r\nmembers of the Committee and to the staff of the\r\nDivision for Palestinian Rights our appreciation for\r\ntheir commendable efforts to achieve justice for the\r\nPalestinian people.\r\nOn the occasion of the International Day of\r\nSolidarity with the Palestinian People, the United Arab\r\nEmirates wishes to reaffirm its solidarity and support\r\nto the Palestinian people in their just struggle to\r\nachieve their legitimate aspiration to establish an\r\nindependent State, like other peoples of the world.\r\nIn spite of some positive developments since last\r\nSeptember, including Israel’s military withdrawal from\r\nthe Gaza Strip and the agreement on the Rafah border\r\ncrossing, the expected outcome of those developments\r\nhas not yet been fully realized due to the obstacles\r\ncreated by the Israeli forces, which have prevented the\r\nachievement of full independence of the Gaza Strip and\r\nits crossings. Those obstacles include intensive and\r\nillegal settlement activities by Israel in the West Bank\r\nand East Jerusalem and continued daily violations\r\nagainst the Palestinian people. They have led to\r\nsubstantial losses in various sectors of the Palestinian\r\neconomy, including the health, education, tourism and\r\nservices sectors. This has made many Palestinian\r\ninstitutions economically sluggish and has led to acute\r\nincreases in unemployment, poverty and disease among\r\nthe Palestinian people. These Israeli policies in the\r\nPalestinian territories have impeded efforts and\r\nopportunities for achieving a just, lasting and\r\ncomprehensive peaceful solution to the Palestinian\r\nquestion.\r\nThe annual reports of various United Nations\r\ncommittees and agencies, supported by documents and\r\nstatistics, continue to reflect Israel’s true intentions and\r\nambitions in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the\r\nGolan. The reports confirm the increasing numbers of\r\nPalestinians who are killed or injured as a result of\r\ncontinued Israeli air strikes, the excessive use of force,\r\ntargeted killings and the detention and displacement of\r\nthousands of civilians in the Palestinian territories\r\nadministrated by the Israeli authorities, under the\r\npretexts of combating terrorism and of self-defence.\r\nDuring the past four years that Government has\r\nmethodically torn away Palestinian agricultural lands\r\nand economic resources and destroyed more than 4,000\r\nPalestinian homes in East Jerusalem and its environs. It\r\nhas built new settlements, residential units and new\r\nbypass roads, confiscated thousands of acres of\r\nPalestinian land and imposed military authority and\r\nadministration for the purpose of constructing the so-\r\ncalled separation wall. The wall has isolated thousands\r\nof Palestinian people in separate cantons, and dozens\r\nof villages have been annexed, separating the northern\r\nand southern parts of the West Bank. Palestinians have\r\nbeen deprived of the right of access to their homes,\r\nrelatives in East Jerusalem and to sacred sites.\r\nAll of those Israeli actions violate United Nations\r\nresolutions, including those adopted at the Assembly’s\r\ntenth emergency special session, and disregard the\r\nadvisory opinion of the International Court of Justice,\r\nwhich considers the construction of the wall to be\r\nillegal and invalid and calls for its immediate\r\ndismantling. The separation wall also obstructs the\r\nestablishment of a viable and independent Palestinian\r\nState and the principles of the road map, which calls\r\nfor the realization of a vision of two States living side\r\nby side in peaceful coexistence.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates reiterates its strong\r\ncondemnation of those Israeli practices, including the\r\nillegitimate and illegal measures taken in the West\r\nBank and East Jerusalem, which constitute a unilateral\r\nattempt to change the demographic, political and legal\r\nnature of the Palestinian territories and impose a fait\r\naccompli. We consider such attempts to be null and\r\nvoid. Such measures must be brought to an end before\r\nfinal status negotiations can begin, as they constitute a\r\nblatant violation to the road map, international and\r\nhumanitarian law, the United Nations Charter and\r\nresolutions and international conventions, including the\r\nFourth Geneva Convention of 1949.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates is extremely\r\nconcerned about the serious consequences of those\r\ndangerous Israeli policies being ignored by the\r\ninternational community, policies that have fuelled\r\nfrustration and despair among the peoples of the region\r\nand increased violence, tension and instability. We\r\ntherefore emphasize once again the main common\r\nresponsibility of the international community,\r\n10\r\nA/60/PV.57\r\nrepresented by the United Nations and its specialized\r\nagencies, in this regard. We call on the Security\r\nCouncil, and the Quartet in particular, to put the\r\nnecessary pressure on Israel to end its hostile\r\ncampaigns against the Palestinians and their National\r\nAuthority, including collective punishment, State\r\nterrorism and incitement, with a view to creating an\r\nenvironment suitable for reinvigorating the peace\r\nprocess and resuming negotiations.\r\nIn this context, we call, first, for Israel to be\r\nforced to cooperate with the Palestinian Authority\r\nregarding its full withdrawal from all territories of the\r\nWest Bank and East Jerusalem, to stop all illegal\r\nsettlement activities in those territories and to\r\ndismantle those settlements as well as the separation\r\nwall, in accordance with the advisory opinion of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice and relevant resolutions\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nSecondly, Israel must provide protection for the\r\nPalestinian people, their national institutions and their\r\nsacred sites, the religious identity of which Israel is\r\nattempting to change especially the Al-Aqsa Mosque.\r\nWe also call on the international community to compel\r\nIsrael to fulfil its commitments in accordance with\r\ninternational law and to prevent it from changing the\r\nhistorical landmarks of Jerusalem.\r\nThirdly, we call on the international community\r\nto provide political, financial and moral support to the\r\nPalestinian Authority, which has demonstrated its\r\ndetermination to fulfil its commitments in accordance\r\nwith the road map and to carry out the necessary\r\nreforms in its national institutions, above all its\r\nsecurity institutions. Such reforms will enable the\r\nPalestinian security institutions to fully discharge their\r\nnational responsibilities, which include the\r\nmanagement of the next legislative elections, the\r\nreconstruction of destroyed development sectors, the\r\nimprovement of the painful humanitarian and social\r\nconditions in the Palestinian territories and the\r\nstrengthening of its control over all Palestinian\r\nterritories. Here, we cannot fail to welcome the\r\ncommendable efforts of the Governments of Jordan\r\nand Egypt, the representative of the Quartet, James\r\nWolfensohn, and the European Union in this respect.\r\nFourthly, we reaffirm the fundamental principles\r\nof the Palestinian question with regard to settlements,\r\nborders, refugees and the status of Jerusalem, as\r\nstipulated in internationally binding resolutions,\r\nnotably General Assembly resolutions 181 (II) and 194\r\n(III) and Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338\r\n(1973), 1397 (2002) and 1515 (2003), which are all\r\nconsistent with the Arab Peace Initiative adopted at the\r\n2002 Beirut Summit.\r\nWe believe that an appropriate Israeli response to\r\nthe just demands of the Arab people would lead to\r\nsecurity and stability for the Israeli people and for the\r\nentire region. In this regard, we look forward to\r\nstrengthening our peace efforts in order to reinvigorate\r\nthe road map, as well as peace negotiations in the\r\nregion, in fulfilment of the commitments included in\r\nresolutions of international legitimacy and in\r\naccordance with the principle of land for peace based\r\non 1967 borders, in order to bring stability, prosperity,\r\ncooperation and development to the people of the\r\nentire region.\r\nMr. Hachani (Tunisia) (spoke in Arabic): I\r\nwould like to express deep appreciation to you,\r\nMr. President, for having convened this annual\r\nmeeting, which has been held for half a century, to\r\nfocus the attention of the General Assembly on the\r\nquestion of Palestine and the struggle of Palestinian\r\npeople. There can be no doubt that this central issue,\r\nwhich has attracted the attention of the entire\r\ninternational community, remains the most important\r\nissue affecting peace and stability in the Middle East,\r\nthe cradle of civilizations.\r\nThe situation in the Middle East is at a very\r\ndelicate stage. The entire international community, in\r\nparticular the influential parties, are called upon to\r\nmake efforts to end the cycle of violence and conflict\r\nin the region, to bring about a return to dialogue and\r\nnegotiation and to embark on serious and responsible\r\nwork with a view to putting an end to the conflict and\r\nto achieving a just, comprehensive and lasting solution\r\nthat guarantees the liberation of all occupied Arab\r\nterritories and allows for peaceful coexistence among\r\nthe peoples of the region.\r\nTunisia, like other peace-loving countries, has\r\nfrom this podium often warned the Assembly about\r\ndangers that will result from a failure of the peace\r\nprocess and the non-implementation of agreements\r\nwith the Palestinian party, as well as the cessation of\r\nnegotiations on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks,\r\nbecause they all represent a setback to the peace\r\nefforts.\r\n11\r\nA/60/PV.57\r\nThere can be no doubt that the intransigence of\r\nthe Israeli Government with regard to its attitude\r\ntowards Palestinian civilians, its expansionist policies\r\nand its insistence on the construction of the separation\r\nwall is counterproductive, as the advisory opinion of\r\nthe International Court of Justice makes clear, and is\r\nnot in the interests of the region. The provisions of the\r\nGeneva Convention relative to the Protection of\r\nCivilian Persons in Time of War have become\r\nineffective because of such Israeli policies and\r\npractices. Violence only generates more violence.\r\nThere is no way to break the cycle unless there is\r\ngenuine and responsible engagement in the peace\r\nprocess and in the principles of the road map so that\r\nthe vision of two States living side by side in peace,\r\nsecurity and good-neighbourliness can be realized.\r\nThe establishment of a just and comprehensive\r\npeace in the region requires a full and unconditional\r\nwithdrawal by Israel from the occupied Syrian Golan\r\nand from the remaining occupied Lebanese territories,\r\nin accordance with all the relevant resolutions and\r\nterms of reference.\r\nThe Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and\r\nthe opening of the Rafah Crossing are both positive\r\ndevelopments within the framework of the\r\nimplementation of the road map. We hope they will be\r\nfollowed by similar and expeditious measures in the\r\nWest Bank and in other occupied Palestinian territories.\r\nWe must not allow internal considerations in the region\r\nto further delay the search for peace.\r\nThe road towards peace remains long and\r\ndifficult. It will require all our efforts to protect the\r\npeace endeavour and to refrain from making\r\nconfrontational statements, which only undermine trust\r\nand confidence between the parties to the conflict. It is\r\nessential for the international community to learn from\r\npast experiences so as to avoid all elements and\r\nshortfalls that impeded the peace process. We look\r\nforward with hope to the Quartet’s efforts to reactivate\r\nthe road map, to restore trust between the Palestinians\r\nand Israelis and to open the way for the resumption of\r\npeace negotiations in order to enable the Palestinian\r\npeople to enjoy its legitimate rights, particularly the\r\nright to establish its own independent State with\r\nJerusalem as its capital.\r\nTunisia’s strong belief in the just cause of the\r\nPalestinian people and its constant commitment to\r\nsupport them in their hour of need will only enhance\r\nefforts to reach a peaceful, just and comprehensive\r\nsettlement in accordance with the Madrid terms of\r\nreference and the Arab Peace Initiative, adopted at the\r\nBeirut Summit in March 2002. Tunisia will continue its\r\nbilateral, regional and international efforts under the\r\nleadership of its President, His Excellency Mr. Zine El\r\nAbidine Ben Ali, to achieve a comprehensive, just and\r\nlasting settlement of the Palestinian question that will\r\nenable the Palestinian people to enjoy their legitimate\r\nrights and will establish security, stability and peaceful\r\ncoexistence in the region so that its peoples can focus\r\non development and reconstruction.\r\nHere, we cannot fail to express our heartfelt\r\nappreciation for all efforts made by the United Nations,\r\nas the guarantor and protector of the principles of\r\ninternational legitimacy, to address the crisis in the\r\nMiddle East and the Arab-Israeli conflict. In particular,\r\nwe should like to commend the Committee on the\r\nExercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian\r\nPeople, under the skilful leadership of Ambassador\r\nBadji, and other United Nations committees and bodies\r\nthat are working to establish peace in the region. They\r\nmust continue their efforts until they complete their\r\nmandates under the relevant General Assembly\r\nresolutions.\r\nMrs. Ismail (Malaysia): At the outset, my\r\ndelegation would like to associate itself with the\r\nstatement made earlier by Mr. Paul Badji, Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Senegal to the United Nations, in his\r\ncapacity as Chairman of the Committee on the Exercise\r\nof the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People. We\r\nthank the Committee for its report (A/60/35). We also\r\nthank the Secretary-General for his report submitted\r\nunder agenda item 15 (A/60/539). We continue to\r\ngreatly appreciate the indispensable work carried out\r\nby the Committee, by the Secretariat’s Division for\r\nPalestinian Rights and by other organs within the\r\nUnited Nations system concerning the question before\r\nus. We highly commend the commitment, efforts and\r\ncontribution of the Secretary-General and his Office in\r\nthat regard. We hope that they will persevere in\r\ncarrying out their mandates and tasks until peace is\r\nachieved in the region and a State of Palestine is\r\ncreated, with East Jerusalem as its capital.\r\nToday, we are observing the International Day of\r\nSolidarity with the Palestinian People. The Prime\r\nMinister of Malaysia, in his capacity as Chairman of\r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), has transmitted a\r\nmessage for that occasion, which outlines the concerns\r\n12\r\nA/60/PV.57\r\nand aspirations of NAM on the question of Palestine.\r\nThe statement should be read in conjunction with that\r\nmessage.\r\nThe reports of the Committee and of the\r\nSecretary-General continue to contain very disturbing\r\naccounts and revelations and to reflect stark realities\r\nconcerning the situation on the ground. There have\r\ncertainly been too many deaths, too many injuries, too\r\nmuch destruction and indescribable suffering —\r\nespecially among the Palestinians — as a result of\r\nrepressive policies, practices and measures carried out\r\nby Israel. All this is contrary to Israel’s obligation\r\nunder international law, international human rights law\r\nand international humanitarian law. The international\r\ncommunity must prevail upon Israel to respect its legal\r\nobligations, just as other States are expected to do. We\r\nhave a duty at the United Nations to stop all the\r\ncontinuing atrocities and abhorrent policies and\r\npractices committed by Israel against the Palestinian\r\npopulation.\r\nWe should not consider the casualties and\r\ndestruction on both sides in terms of numbers or\r\npercentages alone. The life of each human being —\r\nman, woman or child — is sacred and precious, and it\r\nmust be protected. Any act of violence inflicted upon\r\ninnocent civilians in this conflict, be they Palestinians\r\nor Israelis, is unacceptable and deserves equal\r\ncondemnation by all of us.\r\nThe period under review has seen several\r\nmeasures and efforts by both the Palestinians and the\r\nIsraelis towards peace within the framework of the\r\nroad map. However, the path towards peace remains a\r\ndifficult and complicated process. The difficulties\r\ncould be overcome by stronger political will among all\r\nparties concerned. In that connection, my delegation\r\nconsiders the resumption of dialogue at the highest\r\nlevel between Palestinian and Israeli leaders, as well as\r\nrenewed efforts by members of the Quartet, to be a\r\nvery encouraging development. We also commend\r\nEgypt and Jordan for their role in facilitating the peace\r\nprocess. We are confident that all parties concerned\r\nwill persevere in their important efforts.\r\nIn addition, we consider Israel’s withdrawal from\r\nthe Gaza Strip and from parts of the northern West\r\nBank last September to be a positive move. However,\r\nwe strongly oppose the expansion and planned further\r\nexpansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank,\r\nincluding East Jerusalem. They are contrary to Israel’s\r\nobligations under the road map.\r\nWe welcome the historic reopening three days\r\nago of the Rafah Crossing, a crucial link between the\r\nGaza Strip and the outside world. That positive\r\ndevelopment not only has provided the 1.3 million\r\nmostly impoverished Palestinians in that area with\r\naccess to various types of humanitarian assistance in\r\nneighbouring Egypt and offered them greater\r\nopportunities for economic activity and employment,\r\nbut, most important, it has marked the regaining by the\r\nPalestinian people of an important part of their\r\nfreedom and control of their own borders in that area\r\nafter 38 years of Israeli occupation.\r\nIsrael’s ongoing construction of the separation\r\nwall in the occupied Palestinian territory, including in\r\nand around East Jerusalem, seriously endangers the\r\nprospects for comprehensive peace in the region. The\r\nimpact of the wall on all aspects of Palestinian life in\r\nthe areas concerned, as documented in several United\r\nNations reports, is overwhelming. The wall threatens\r\nthe territorial integrity of a future State of Palestine, as\r\nenvisaged in Security Council resolution 1397 (2002)\r\nand upheld in the road map.\r\nThe wall is one of the most visible signs of the\r\ntransformation of the territory into a vast open-air\r\nprison — something that is unprecedented in modern\r\nhistory. The wall is a visible and clear act of territorial\r\nannexation by Israel under the guise of self-defence\r\nand security. As we are all aware, the wall was\r\ndeclared contrary to international law by the\r\nInternational Court of Justice, the principal judicial\r\norgan of the United Nations, in its advisory opinion\r\nrendered on 9 July 2004. The General Assembly\r\nconsequently adopted, by an overwhelming majority,\r\nresolution ES-10/15 outlining several important\r\nfollow-up and concrete measures and, inter alia,\r\ndemanding that Israel stop the construction of the wall,\r\ndismantle and remove the completed sections of the\r\nwall, and pay reparations to all those affected by the\r\nconstruction of the wall in the occupied Palestinian\r\nterritory. We renew our call on Israel to take all\r\nnecessary measures to comply with the International\r\nCourt of Justice advisory opinion and resolution ES-\r\n10/15. We find it highly regrettable that the Security\r\nCouncil has not been able to look into the specific\r\nquestion of the separation wall in accordance with its\r\nfunctions and powers under Article 24 of the United\r\nNations Charter.\r\n13\r\nA/60/PV.57\r\nThe question of Palestine remains high on the\r\nagenda of both the Non-Aligned Movement and the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC).\r\nMalaysia, as Chair of NAM and the tenth OIC summit,\r\nhas initiated several high-level initiatives relating to\r\nthe question of Palestine this year. Some of those\r\ninitiatives are as follows.\r\nFirst, Malaysian civil society organizations, under\r\nthe sponsorship of Peace Malaysia, successfully convened\r\na World Civil Society Conference on Peace in Palestine\r\nin Putrajaya, Malaysia, from 28 to 30 March 2005. The\r\nConference, which was held pursuant to a decision by\r\nNAM and attended by representatives of civil society\r\norganizations from many parts of the world, including\r\nIsrael, agreed, inter alia, to establish an international\r\ncentre on Palestine for civil society in the south, to be\r\nlocated in Malaysia. The international centre would\r\nserve as a focal point for the global civil society\r\ncampaign in support of Palestine. It is the Movement’s\r\nhope that the international campaign will be able to\r\nmobilize international public opinion against the\r\ncontinued Israeli occupation and illegal construction of\r\nthe wall and settlements, and in support of the early\r\nrealization of an independent and sovereign State of\r\nPalestine.\r\nSecondly, the foreign ministers of NAM, who met\r\nin Doha in June and in New York in September, and the\r\nForeign Ministers of OIC, who met in Sana’a in June\r\nand in New York in September, expressed, inter alia,\r\ntheir solidarity and support for the Palestinian people,\r\nas well as the need for the members of the Quartet to\r\nfulfil their responsibility to fully implement the road\r\nmap towards the viable creation of an independent and\r\nsovereign State of Palestine.\r\nThirdly, the foreign ministers of the NAM\r\nCommittee on Palestine, who met in New York on\r\n19 September, agreed on a number of measures to be\r\ntaken by NAM in the context of the Movement’s strong\r\nsupport for the Palestinian cause, aimed at moving the\r\npeace process forward.\r\nFinally, the NAM and OIC ministerial delegations\r\non Palestine met with their counterparts from the\r\nQuartet and permanent members of the Security\r\nCouncil at the margins of the High-level Plenary\r\nMeeting and the general debate of the General\r\nAssembly at its sixtieth session. During those\r\nmeetings, they conveyed the position of NAM and OIC\r\non the urgency of pushing the peace process forward,\r\nbeginning with salvaging the road map, as well as the\r\nconcerns of both organizations on the continuing\r\nconstruction of the separation wall and the Israeli\r\nsettlements in occupied Palestinian territory.\r\nIt is incumbent upon Israel to demonstrate to the\r\ninternational community that it is genuinely committed\r\nto a peaceful solution rather than to a military one.\r\nIsrael must realize that there can never be a military\r\nsolution to the conflict. Similarly, the Palestinian\r\nAuthority, with assistance from the international\r\ncommunity, should continue with efforts to reform its\r\nrelevant institutions and improve its security apparatus.\r\nMy delegation commends the Palestinian Authority for\r\nwhat it has achieved in that regard, despite various\r\nconstraints. We urge both sides to continue to create,\r\non the basis of and in compliance with the road map,\r\nthe necessary environment that would enable\r\nnegotiations to take place. The objective of a\r\npermanent two-State solution of Israel and Palestine,\r\nliving side by side in peace and security within secure\r\nand recognized borders, is achievable. The\r\ninternational community has a collective role to play in\r\nthat regard. We must all work together to facilitate and\r\nredouble our efforts to attain a just, comprehensive and\r\nlasting settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\r\nThe United Nations, including the General\r\nAssembly and the Security Council, has a permanent\r\nresponsibility towards the question of Palestine until it\r\nis resolved in all its aspects on the basis of the Charter\r\nand the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly\r\nand the Security Council. The question should also be\r\nresolved in accordance with international law. In that\r\nconnection, my delegation reaffirms its support for the\r\nimportant efforts of the Quartet and other concerned\r\nparties in pursuing the difficult and complicated path\r\ntowards peace. The General Assembly is the last\r\nbastion of hope for the Palestinian people. The\r\nAssembly must uphold the rule of law and the purposes\r\nand principles of the Charter. In that connection,\r\nMalaysia is pleased to join other delegations in\r\nsponsoring the four draft resolutions initiated by the\r\nCommittee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of\r\nthe Palestinian People, which have been presented by\r\nthe Chairman of the Committee for consideration by\r\nthe Assembly under this important agenda item.\r\nMr. Abdelaziz (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): The\r\nGeneral Assembly is meeting once again to discuss the\r\nquestion of Palestine, an international issue that the\r\n14\r\nA/60/PV.57\r\ninternational community has failed to settle over more\r\nthan half a century.\r\nOur discussion today is of special importance,\r\ncoinciding as it does with our observation of the\r\nOrganization’s sixtieth anniversary and with efforts to\r\nimplement the outcome document of the High-level\r\nPlenary Meeting in order to establish a more effective\r\nUnited Nations capable of upholding the principles on\r\nwhich it was founded and that are the indispensable\r\nbasis of a more peaceful, prosperous and just world, in\r\nparticular the principles of justice and equality and the\r\nrights of peoples suffering under colonial control and\r\nforeign occupation to exercise self-determination.\r\nIn that respect, the spirit of the United Nations\r\nsixtieth anniversary should embody the spirit of the\r\nresolutions adopted every year by the General\r\nAssembly on the question of Palestine, which call on\r\nIsrael to withdraw from all Palestinian and Arab\r\nterritories occupied in 1967 and to restore the full\r\nrights of the Palestinian people, foremost among which\r\nare the right of return of Palestinian refugees; the right\r\nto self-determination; the right to establish their\r\nindependent State on their own land, with East\r\nJerusalem as its capital; and the right to live free of all\r\nviolations of their human rights, including their right to\r\nlife.\r\nThe spirit of our tireless work should also extend\r\nto including Palestine in the implementation of the\r\nfinal document of the world summit, which marked the\r\nsixtieth anniversary of the United Nations. The\r\nprinciples and values that we have all reaffirmed\r\nshould be applied to that question. We should strive to\r\nenhance the values of justice and equality, and we\r\nshould strengthen the understanding of Israel’s\r\nresponsibility as an occupying Power, until the\r\nPalestinian State is established as soon as possible. We\r\nshould also intensify our efforts for the establishment\r\nof a Palestinian State living side by side with Israel in\r\npeace and security.\r\nSimilarly, our quest to increase respect for human\r\nrights and to decrease selectivity, politicization and the\r\nuse of double standards requires us to put an end to all\r\nviolations of the human rights of the Palestinian\r\npeople. We should address the human rights of\r\nPalestinians and Israelis on an equal and just basis. We\r\nshould put an end to the inhumane practices against the\r\nPalestinians resulting from the policies of siege,\r\nclosure, continued settler expansion, confiscation of\r\nland, destruction of agriculture and the construction of\r\nthe separation wall within the Palestinian territories.\r\nThis separation wall is in clear violation of the legal\r\nand moral values of the International Court of Justice’s\r\nadvisory opinion in the case concerning the Legal\r\nConsequences of the Construction of a Wall in the\r\nOccupied Palestinian Territory.\r\nFurthermore, our work to enhance the system of\r\ncollective security requires us to enhance the security\r\nof the Palestinian people within the borders of their\r\noccupied territories. We should put an end to the policy\r\nof assassinating activists and provide the Palestinian\r\nAuthority with the full opportunity to perform its\r\nrole — to control the security situation on Palestinian\r\nlands without interference, and to strengthen its\r\nauthority to implement the security needs of those\r\nlands as the Palestinian people desire.\r\nProceeding from the same basis, the United\r\nNations should maximize its use of the Peacebuilding\r\nCommission when it is established, to enable it to take\r\nthe Palestinian people, economically and socially, to a\r\nnew level. They could then realize their wishes and\r\naspirations for a better life and advance from the status\r\nof occupation to one of freedom and stability within\r\nthe framework of effective international support, a\r\nstatus based on the democratic practices that will be\r\nconfirmed by the elections to be conducted, freely and\r\nwithout interference, in 2006.\r\nSimilarly, our work in the field of institutional\r\nreform should be based on the promotion and\r\nreactivation of the work of all committees, bodies and\r\nsecretariats in charge of guaranteeing the full exercise\r\nby the Palestinian people of their rights. Such work\r\nshould not be replaced by attempts for whatever reason\r\nto limit the activities of the United Nations in that\r\nimportant field.\r\nTherefore, we call upon all Member States to\r\nendorse all draft resolutions submitted under the\r\npresent agenda item. Based upon our strong belief in\r\nthe crucial role of the United Nations, Egypt, together\r\nwith other internationally influential parties, strongly\r\nsupports the special role played by the Quartet to\r\nguarantee the success of efforts aimed at the\r\napplication of the road map towards final status\r\nnegotiations.\r\nWe call upon the United Nations to make every\r\neffort in that regard until those objectives are realized.\r\nWe would also like to reiterate that we will make every\r\n15\r\nA/60/PV.57\r\npossible effort whenever such effort is required, until\r\nan independent Palestinian State is established.\r\nIn that context, we welcome the Israeli\r\nwithdrawal from the Gaza Strip and from some\r\nPalestinian cities in the West Bank, as well as the\r\nopening of the Rafah crossing between Egypt and the\r\nGaza Strip. We call upon the Israeli Government to\r\nproceed further by withdrawing from all occupied\r\nPalestinian territories and to implement its obligations\r\nunder the road map so that we can achieve our common\r\nobjective — the establishment of two independent\r\nStates, Palestine and Israel, living side by side in peace\r\nand security.\r\nThat achievement should be based on a number\r\nof principles and values, the most important of which\r\nis that the Israeli withdrawal should be part of the\r\nimplementation of the road map and should be\r\nfollowed by other steps, such as withdrawal from the\r\nremaining Palestinian territories in the West Bank and\r\nfrom Jerusalem, and an agreement on a final\r\nsettlement. That withdrawal should also include all\r\ncrossings, seaports and airports and should guarantee\r\nthe freedoms of the Palestinian people. The Israeli\r\npolicies of incursion, invasion and assassination,\r\nbesieging the Gaza Strip and targeting its population on\r\nany pretext should end.\r\nInternational consensus on the promotion of the\r\nmultilateral order should contribute to the realization\r\nof the vision of the two States in an equitable and just\r\nmanner, in strict implementation of the stipulations of\r\nthe road map, without bias or selectivity, and through\r\nthe creation of a genuine partnership among the major\r\nparties on the international scene — foremost among\r\nwhich is the Quartet — in order to achieve a just and\r\ncomprehensive settlement of the question of Palestine.\r\nOnly then can we recognize that the United\r\nNations has achieved its objectives in terms of respect\r\nfor its values and principles and in guaranteeing\r\nsecurity and respect for human rights. That is when all\r\nof the international efforts to assist the Palestinian\r\npeople in building a better future will also be realized.\r\nWe hope that that will occur as soon as possible.\r\nMr. Sen (India): India has warmly welcomed the\r\nagreement concluded between Israel and the\r\nPalestinian Authority on the Rafah border crossing for\r\ntravel between Gaza and Egypt and for building a\r\nseaport in the Gaza Strip. We believe that that was a\r\nsignificant development that will go a long way\r\ntowards improving the lives and economy of the\r\nPalestinian people living in the Gaza Strip. There also\r\nseems to be a need for a floating dock or some other\r\nsuch arrangement, which can be operationalized\r\nquickly, because the belief that there is no guaranteed\r\nborder outlet seems to be holding back foreign\r\ninvestors.\r\nThe opening of the Rafah border crossing last\r\nSaturday, which enabled 1,548 Palestinians to cross\r\ninto Egypt without being subject to Israeli checks for\r\nthe first time, has raised hopes for further progress in\r\nefforts to revitalize the Middle East peace process.\r\nThere have also been other signs generating optimism\r\nthis year. The election of President Mahmoud Abbas in\r\nJanuary 2005 demonstrated the commitment of the\r\nPalestinian people to democracy.\r\nIn September, Israel withdrew from the Gaza\r\nStrip and parts of the northern West Bank, marking\r\nIsrael’s first withdrawal from occupied Palestinian\r\nterritory since 1967. That landmark event set an\r\nimportant precedent for the eventual realization of a\r\ntwo-State solution. India welcomed the withdrawal as a\r\npositive development and the beginning of a process\r\nthat, we hoped, would take forward the negotiations in\r\naccordance with the road map and the relevant Security\r\nCouncil resolutions. The elections for the Palestinian\r\nLegislative Council, scheduled for January 2006, will\r\nprovide further incentive for the Palestinians to fully\r\nengage in the democratic process.\r\nWith a renewed sense of optimism also comes the\r\nhard reckoning of reality. The report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the agenda items under consideration,\r\ncontained in document A/60/539 and dated\r\n7 November 2005, draws attention to the fact that the\r\nhumanitarian situation of the Palestinian people in\r\n2004 remained grave. About half lived below the\r\nofficial poverty line of $2.10 per day, compared to just\r\n22 per cent in 2000. Furthermore, 16 per cent of\r\nPalestinians — approximately 560,000 people — were\r\nin deep poverty. Unemployment increased more than\r\nthreefold since 2000, reaching a figure of 238,000\r\nunemployed in 2004, largely as a result of roadblocks\r\non roads within and leading to the occupied Palestinian\r\nterritory. Palestinians continued to face problems\r\nreaching their places of work, schools and hospitals,\r\nand standards of health and education continued to\r\ndeteriorate. In some parts of the territory, Palestinians’\r\nneeds for additional humanitarian assistance rose\r\nsharply as a consequence.\r\n16\r\nA/60/PV.57\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General also\r\nexpresses concern over Israel’s continued settlement\r\nexpansion and unilateral construction of the wall in the\r\nWest Bank. It points out that lack of action to remove\r\nillegal settlement outposts erected since 2001 has\r\nseverely undermined trust in Israel’s intentions and that\r\nGovernment-sponsored settlement activity has a\r\nnegative impact on the territorial contiguity of\r\nPalestinian territory and thus remains a source of\r\nserious concern.\r\nAccording to the road map, Israel has an\r\nobligation to freeze all settlement activity, including\r\nnatural growth, and immediately dismantle outposts\r\nerected illegally since March 2001. The report also\r\nstates that Israel continues its unilateral construction of\r\nthe wall on Palestinian land and that, along with\r\ncontinued Israeli settlement activity, this constitutes a\r\nkey challenge to the fulfilment of the road map’s goal\r\nof a two-State solution.\r\nAt this critical stage, it is all the more important\r\nfor the international community to take steps for the\r\nsmooth implementation of Palestinian trade and transit\r\naccess, both within its territories and with the outside\r\nworld. It is equally important for Israel to stop\r\nsettlement activity, lift curfews and ease restrictions on\r\nthe movement of persons and goods and thereby\r\nsignificantly improve the humanitarian situation in the\r\nPalestinian territories. Israel’s actions should not\r\nprejudge final status issues or threaten longer-term\r\nprospects for peace by making the creation of a viable\r\nand contiguous Palestinian State much more difficult.\r\nThe problem is that settlement activity leads to\r\ncantonization and changes patterns of transportation\r\nand access. The wall’s encroachment on Palestinian\r\nland and interests creates great hardships for the\r\nPalestinian people affected by its construction and\r\nexacerbates the situation by placing populations,\r\nagricultural land and a part of the West Bank aquifer\r\nbeyond their reach. Moreover, the continued\r\nconstruction of the wall on Palestinian land threatens to\r\nprejudge the eventual outcome of the final status\r\nnegotiations between the parties. We therefore reiterate\r\nour call on Israel to abide by its legal obligations as set\r\nforth in the 9 July 2004 advisory opinion of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice and resolution ES-10/15\r\nof the General Assembly.\r\nFor its part, the Palestinian Authority has to\r\nshoulder its responsibility by undertaking action on the\r\nground to halt violence. As the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral points out, the Palestinian Authority must push\r\nahead with efforts to reform the Palestinian security\r\nservices. Decisive action in that regard should help to\r\nrestore law and order.\r\nOver the years, India has assisted the Palestinian\r\nAuthority through development projects and human\r\nresources development. Indian assistance projects in\r\nthe Palestinian Authority include the construction and\r\nestablishment of the Jawaharlal Nehru Library at the\r\nAl-Azhar University in Gaza City and the Mahatma\r\nGandhi Library and student activity centre at the\r\nPalestinian Technical College at Deir Al-Balah in the\r\nGaza Strip.\r\nDuring the visit of President Abbas to India in\r\nMay 2005, the Prime Minister of India announced a\r\ngrant of $15 million to Palestine for developmental\r\nprojects, in addition to a grant announced earlier this\r\nyear. Those grants will, inter alia, fund hospitals and\r\ninformation technology centres in Gaza and Ramallah,\r\nan Indian Chair at Al-Quds University and a school in\r\nAbu Dis.\r\nWe wish also to recall the late Palestinian\r\nPresident Yasser Arafat, who passed away on\r\n11 November 2004. For nearly four decades, he\r\nrepresented the national aspirations of the Palestinian\r\npeople. On this occasion, we wish to pay homage to his\r\nmemory and recall his everlasting contribution to the\r\nPalestinian cause.\r\nWe urge both Palestinians and Israelis to make\r\noptimal use of the opportunities provided by that new\r\nbeginning. The ceasefire concluded at the Sharm el-\r\nSheikh summit in February 2005 has broadly survived,\r\nresulting in a noticeable improvement in the security\r\nsituation, marked by a decrease in the number of\r\ndeaths since then. It is necessary to renew and redouble\r\nefforts so the peace process can move forward in\r\naccordance with the relevant United Nations\r\nresolutions, the Quartet’s road map and international\r\nlaw. The international community must press both\r\nparties to renew parallel action on their obligations\r\nunder the road map, which constitutes for both Israel\r\nand the Palestinians the best opportunity to move\r\nbeyond the conflict towards peace, security and\r\nprosperity. The international community must also\r\ncontinue to assist the parties to simultaneously address\r\neconomic, humanitarian, security and political issues.\r\n17\r\nA/60/PV.57\r\nMr. Cabral (Guinea-Bissau), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nWe hope that a negotiated solution to end the\r\nconflict will be quickly found. The vision of an\r\nindependent, democratic and viable Palestinian State\r\nliving side by side with Israel within secure and\r\nrecognized borders remains as valid as at any other\r\ntime — and that vision is perhaps more attainable now.\r\nIndia urges the parties concerned and the international\r\ncommunity to press for a just and comprehensive\r\nresolution of the conflict and the broader achievement\r\nof peace, security and stability for the entire region at\r\nthe earliest possible time, based on Security Council\r\nresolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973), 1397 (2002) and\r\n1515 (2003).\r\nIndia has advocated a comprehensive solution to\r\nthe situation in the Middle East as the logical next step\r\nin the resolution of the wider Israeli-Arab conflict at\r\nthe regional level, as envisaged by the Saudi Arabian\r\npeace initiative. The principle of land for peace is\r\nequally valid in addressing the other tracks of the\r\nMiddle East conflict. We sincerely hope that the\r\ncomprehensive political process can be revived at the\r\nearliest possible time.\r\nMr. Baali (Algeria) (spoke in French): The report\r\nof the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable\r\nRights of the Palestinian People (A/60/35) under\r\nconsideration by the Assembly today describes in a\r\nlucid and impartial fashion the tragic situation in which\r\nthe Palestinian people continue to live in their\r\nhomeland, occupied by Israel. The report places our\r\nconsideration of the Palestinian question in a\r\nparticularly worrisome context. It shows — if it were\r\nstill necessary to do so — that it is essential that the\r\nCommittee pursue its work and activities in accordance\r\nwith its mandate as long as Israel continues to occupy\r\nPalestinian territories and persists in its flagrant\r\nviolations of international law.\r\nThe year that has just ended has been marked by\r\nIsrael’s pursuit of its policy of colonization and\r\nrepression, leaving a trail of atrocities, abuses and\r\nconfiscations in its wake. Amid that atmosphere of\r\ndeath and destruction. a glimmer of hope appeared\r\nwith Israel’s withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. For this\r\nwithdrawal to mark a genuine break with the past and\r\nto relaunch the dynamic of peace, it must be part of the\r\nbroader framework of the road map, opening the way\r\nto the withdrawal of Israel forces and the\r\ndismantlement of all settlements in the West Bank and\r\naround Al-Quds Al-Sharif.\r\nThe continuing construction of the separation\r\nwall, the intensification and expansion of settlement\r\nactivities in the West Bank and the continued isolation\r\nof East Jerusalem from the rest of the West Bank\r\nremain sources of grave concern for my delegation and\r\ngive rise to serious misgivings about Israel’s real\r\nintentions with respect to the final status of the\r\nterritory. Through those measures, Israel is, in reality,\r\ndrawing a new map of the occupied territories on the\r\nground, thus severely compromising the chances of a\r\nfuture independent Palestinian State. Those measures\r\nfurther jeopardize the integrity and the territorial\r\ncontiguity of the future State.\r\nMy country reaffirms its principled position that\r\nthe settlements and the wall being constructed by Israel\r\nin the occupied Palestinian territories, including East\r\nJerusalem, violate international law and Security\r\nCouncil and General Assembly resolutions and are\r\ncontrary to the provisions of the road map.\r\nMy country is deeply concerned about the very\r\nserious deterioration of the humanitarian, economic\r\nand social aspects of the situation in the occupied\r\nPalestinian territories, and we reiterate our strong\r\ncondemnation of the inhuman practices of the Israeli\r\narmy against the Palestinians, their property and their\r\ninstitutions.\r\nToday, on the International Day of Solidarity with\r\nthe Palestinian People — who have now seen another\r\nmilestone in this long period of destruction and\r\ninjustice — my country, Algeria, reaffirms its firm\r\nsupport for the struggle of that brave people to achieve\r\ntheir inalienable national rights.\r\nThe time has come for the international\r\ncommunity to shoulder its responsibilities and put an\r\nend to the Israeli policy of occupation. The Security\r\nCouncil has recently been seen acting with uncommon\r\nspeed, vigour and effectiveness to bring about a\r\nwithdrawal of foreign forces in that same region. If the\r\nCouncil wishes to maintain its credibility in the eyes of\r\nthe international community, it must act with the same\r\nresolve, including by invoking Chapter VII of the\r\nCharter, to ensure that Israel withdraws\r\nunconditionally and without delay from all the\r\noccupied Palestinian and Arab territories, in\r\ncompliance with international law. The withdrawal\r\nshould be accompanied by the total and unconditional\r\n18\r\nA/60/PV.57\r\nfreeze of settlement activity throughout the occupied\r\nPalestinian territories and the cessation of the wall’s\r\nconstruction, as well as by the demolition of those\r\nsections that have already been completed, in\r\naccordance with the advisory opinion of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice and as endorsed by the\r\nAssembly. Those actions would ensure a successful\r\noutcome to the withdrawal from Gaza and a serious\r\nresumption of negotiations on the issue of final status,\r\nwhich has been postponed for too long.\r\nThe international community, represented by the\r\nQuartet, is called upon to become further engaged in\r\norder to bring a lasting and just solution to the Middle\r\nEast conflict based on compliance with Security\r\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973), 1515\r\n(2003) and 1544 (2004), the principle of land for peace\r\nand full implementation of the road map endorsed by\r\nthe Security Council.\r\nWhile reaffirming my country’s support for a\r\npeaceful, negotiated solution based on international\r\nlaw, as President Abdelaziz Bouteflika solemnly\r\nrecalled at the Summit of South American and Arab\r\nCountries held in Brasilia in May 2005, we are more\r\nconvinced than ever that a final settlement of the Arab-\r\nIsraeli conflict must be based on an end to the\r\noccupation and the withdrawal of the Israeli army from\r\nall occupied Arab territories, including the Syrian\r\nGolan and the last remaining occupied enclave in\r\nLebanon, the cessation of all settlement activities\r\nthroughout the occupied Palestinian territories, the\r\ndismantling of existing settlements, the cessation of the\r\nbuilding of the separation wall and the renunciation of\r\nall policies tending to inflame passions and jeopardize\r\nthe success of the peace process.\r\nThe Assembly must respond adequately to the\r\nrational aspiration of the Palestinian people to recover\r\ntheir legitimate rights, in particular the right to self-\r\ndetermination and the right to create their own\r\nindependent State with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its\r\ncapital.\r\nMr. Almansoor (Bahrain) (spoke in Arabic): The\r\ndebate on the question of Palestine coincides with the\r\noccasion of the International Day of Solidarity with the\r\nPalestinian People. When the General Assembly\r\nadopted resolution 32/40 B of 2 December 1977\r\nestablishing the International Day, no one had any\r\ndoubt that the Assembly was aware of its\r\nresponsibilities towards the Palestinian people and\r\ntheir hardships or that it was aware of the need to work\r\ntirelessly to find a comprehensive and just solution to\r\nthe question of Palestine. The observance of the\r\nInternational Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian\r\nPeople is of special importance because it affords the\r\ninternational community an opportunity to renew that\r\ncommitment.\r\nMy delegation thanks the Committee on the\r\nExercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian\r\nPeople for their commendable efforts with respect to\r\nthe question of Palestine and for their important annual\r\nreport (A/60/35). We thank the Chairman and the\r\nmembers of the Committee for their efforts. We are\r\naware of the difficulties they face in the examination\r\nand analysis of the facts of this important issue as they\r\nseek to help the Palestinian people exercise their\r\ninalienable rights.\r\nThe Committee’s report illustrates several points\r\nthat had been ambiguous due to efforts to distort and\r\nconceal the facts. Continued illegal actions exacerbate\r\nthe situation in the occupied Palestinian territories. Our\r\nconcern about settlement expansion and the\r\nconstruction of the illegal separation wall in the\r\noccupied Palestinian territories is growing more acute\r\nbecause of the intensified expansion of existing\r\nsettlements and the building of new ones, and the\r\naccelerated pace to complete the construction of the\r\nseparation wall.\r\nAccording to the report of the Special Rapporteur\r\nof the Commission on Human Rights on the situation\r\nof human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied\r\nby Israel since 1967, contained in document A/60/271,\r\nthe construction of the wall and the expansion of the\r\nsettlements — two outcomes of the occupation — are\r\ntwo factors that undermine the fundamental right of the\r\nPalestinian people to self-determination.\r\nThe violation of all other rights of the\r\nPalestinians derives from the violation of that\r\nfundamental right of self-determination, since\r\noccupation by its very nature leads to human rights\r\nviolations. Those violations take place before the eyes\r\nof the international community, in contravention of\r\ninternational law and instruments and international\r\ndecisions and resolutions, including Security Council\r\nresolution 446 (1979) on the issue of Israeli settlements\r\nand the lack of any legal basis for the construction of\r\nsuch settlements. Council resolution 465 (1980) calls\r\nfor existing settlements to be dismantled.\r\n19\r\nA/60/PV.57\r\nIsrael’s policy and practices with respect to the\r\nsettlements and its welcoming of new immigrants to\r\nthem is in flagrant violation of the Geneva Convention\r\nrelative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of\r\nWar. The continuation of those practices seriously\r\nimpedes the implementation of a comprehensive,\r\nlasting and just peace in the Middle East. Likewise,\r\nsuch practices are in violation of the advisory opinion\r\nof the International Court of Justice of 9 July 2004,\r\nwhich states that the building of the separation wall is\r\nillegal and calls for its dismantlement.\r\nRather than comply with international law, the\r\nadvisory opinion of the International Court of Justice\r\nand United Nations resolutions, Israel continues to\r\nbuild and expand settlements in the West Bank, in\r\nviolation of article 49, paragraph 6, of the Fourth\r\nGeneva Convention. That practice continues without\r\ninterruption even before Israel carries out a new plan\r\nthat would establish the largest settlement project,\r\nresulting in the confiscation of territory in the West\r\nBank that exceeds the Gaza Strip in size. Those\r\nconstruction activities have continued in flagrant\r\nviolation of international instruments and the Quartet’s\r\nroad map, and, as the Special Rapporteur notes in his\r\nreport, will create a situation in which the road map\r\nwill become essentially meaningless.\r\nNo one doubts that the situation is worsening as a\r\nresult of the occupying Power’s ongoing construction\r\nof the separation wall in the West Bank, which has\r\nbeen condemned by the international community. In\r\naddition, the construction of the separation wall around\r\nJerusalem violates Security Council resolution 476\r\n(1980), which rejected laws adopted by the Israeli\r\nparliament to make Jerusalem the permanent capital of\r\nIsrael, and resolution 478 (1980) of 20 August 1980,\r\nwhich reaffirmed the Council’s determination that all\r\nlegislative and administrative measures that have\r\nsought to alter the character and status of Jerusalem, in\r\nparticular the basic law on Jerusalem and other such\r\ndecisions, are null and void.\r\nIt appears that Israel is building the separation\r\nwall in the West Bank and around Jerusalem in an\r\nattempt to achieve its expansionist aims in occupied\r\nPalestinian territory. That can be seen from the\r\ncommitment made by the Prime Minister of Israel,\r\nduring the High-level Meeting on 15 September, to\r\ncomplete the construction of the separation wall. That\r\ndeclaration prompted the Palestinian Rights Committee\r\nto reiterate in its report its concern that Israel was\r\nattempting to unilaterally define the future borders of\r\nthe Palestinian State.\r\nAmong the separation wall’s negative\r\nconsequences are its effects on the economic and social\r\nsituation of the Palestinians. The destruction of\r\nPalestinian land and property has irreversible\r\nconsequences and will undermine the ability of\r\nPalestinians to rebuild and revitalize their economy,\r\nwhich has become more fragile since September 2000.\r\nPalestinians have spared no effort to end the\r\ntragic situation. They have signed peace agreements.\r\nArab leaders as well have explored all avenues in the\r\nquest for a comprehensive and just peace in the region\r\nand have endorsed various peace initiatives reflecting\r\nthat approach, such as the Arab peace initiative\r\nadopted at the 2002 Beirut summit.\r\nThe withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Gaza\r\nStrip was welcomed as an indicator of further steps to\r\nbe taken. The Committee on the Exercise of the\r\nInalienable Rights of the Palestinian People confirmed\r\nthat the withdrawal could help revive peace\r\nnegotiations within the context of the road map, with\r\nthe goal of creating an independent, contiguous\r\nPalestinian State living side by side in peace and\r\nsecurity with Israel.\r\nThe road map remains the logical and proper\r\nframework for achieving a just and lasting solution to\r\nthe Palestinian question based on the 4 June 1967\r\nborders and implementation of Security Council\r\nresolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) 1397 (2002) and\r\n1515 (2003).\r\nMr. Alsaidi (Yemen) (spoke in Arabic): The\r\ndebate on the question of Palestine is particularly\r\nimportant, as it deals with an issue that has serious\r\nhumanitarian and security implications. It is indeed a\r\npainful exercise to discuss an issue such as the\r\nquestion of Palestine, which involves grave injustice,\r\nrepression and suffering that surpasses all limits.\r\nThe report of the Special Committee to\r\nInvestigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human\r\nRights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the\r\nOccupied Territories (A/60/380) and the report of the\r\nCommittee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of\r\nthe Palestinian People (A/60/35) state that the situation\r\nis indeed a painful one of limitless suffering. The\r\ncontinued construction of the separation wall, in spite\r\nof its illegality according to the advisory opinion of the\r\n20\r\nA/60/PV.57\r\nInternational Court of Justice, has led to the annexation\r\nof even more Palestinian territory and has created\r\nisolated plots of land where freedom of movement of\r\nPalestinians is prevented. Family members cannot visit\r\none another, and health care and educational\r\ninstitutions have become inaccessible. The problems\r\ncreated by the wall have increased the suffering of\r\nwomen, children and the elderly, who are deprived of\r\nmedical attention and access to education.\r\nPalestinians are forced into living on destroyed\r\nplots or are displaced as a result of continued military\r\naggression, house demolitions, the uprooting of trees,\r\nthe destruction of infrastructure, the closure of roads\r\nand crossings, the intensification of sieges and the\r\nincrease in Israeli settlement activities. Israeli actions\r\ntarget entire communities, preventing people from\r\npractising their livelihoods, from attending schools and\r\nuniversities or visiting health and social institutions.\r\nAs a result, poverty is exacerbated among the\r\nPalestinians, causing economic hardship and\r\ndeteriorating living conditions. Israel progressively and\r\nsystematically seeks to crush and obliterate all the\r\nelements that would help in the creation of a future\r\nState of Palestine as a contiguous geographical entity\r\nand a viable State, which would be a factor in\r\nconsolidating peace and stability in the region and the\r\nworld.\r\nThis year’s debate on the question of Palestine\r\ncomes after the issuance of the report of the Special\r\nCommittee, which describes the feelings of despair that\r\nexist in the region as a result of the suffering among\r\nPalestinians caused by Israeli practices. The\r\ninternational community has the responsibility to spare\r\nno effort to put an end to the Israeli practices and\r\nmeasures against the unarmed Palestinian population.\r\nIt must also ensure that Israel complies with its\r\nagreements and international resolutions, allows the\r\nPalestinian elections to proceed on time and according\r\nto plan and to be successful, allows all Palestinians,\r\nincluding the inhabitants of East Jerusalem, to\r\nparticipate in the elections, lifts the blockades\r\nunconditionally imposed on the Palestinian people and\r\nends the construction of the racist separation wall,\r\ndismantling those sections that have already been\r\ncompleted.\r\nIsrael must end all colonial settlement planning\r\nand activities and withdraw from the territories it has\r\noccupied since 1967 in Palestine, the Syrian Golan and\r\nthe Shaba’a farms area in southern Lebanon.\r\nThe international community must also reject as\r\nillegitimate all Israeli resolutions and measures that are\r\ncontrary to international legitimacy, including all\r\nattempts to undermine the sovereignty of the Holy\r\nCity, which will be the capital of the Palestinian State.\r\nA just solution to the refugee problem must be found,\r\nin accordance with international resolutions, including\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 194 (III). The Palestinian\r\npeople must be allowed to establish an independent\r\nState on their national soil.\r\nThe world’s hopes were revived following\r\nIsrael’s withdrawal from the Gaza Strip as a first step.\r\nThe international community must now put further\r\npressure on Israel to push it along that same track and\r\ntake further steps to withdraw to the borders of 4 June\r\n1967 in order to achieve a lasting, comprehensive and\r\njust settlement of the conflict, based on the belief that\r\nall individuals have the right to live in peace and not at\r\nthe expense of others. The settlement must be based as\r\nwell on a return to the peace process in conformity\r\nwith the Arab peace initiative, the Madrid Conference,\r\nthe relevant resolutions of international legitimacy, the\r\nroad map and the principle of land for peace so that the\r\nPalestinian people can create an independent State on\r\ntheir national soil.\r\nWe commend the recent efforts of the Secretary\r\nof State of the United States, which led to an\r\nagreement on the freedom of movement at Palestinian\r\ncrossings, as well as the efforts of the Quartet to\r\nadvance the peace process in the region.\r\nMs. Nuñez Mordoche (Cuba) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): The consideration of the items on the\r\nAssembly’s agenda at today’s joint debate takes on\r\nspecial importance during this month of November, as\r\nmuch because of recent events in the Middle East as\r\nbecause of the historic events currently being\r\ncommemorated. Only a few days ago, on 11 November,\r\nwe commemorated the first anniversary of the passing\r\nof Yasser Arafat. The historic leader of the Palestinians\r\ndied before seeing his and his people’s great dream\r\nrealized. The establishment of an independent\r\nPalestinian State with East Jerusalem as its capital\r\nremains a chimera.\r\nIn addition, today we are celebrating the\r\nInternational Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian\r\nPeople, a date on which all peoples and Governments\r\nof goodwill extend their support to that heroic people\r\n21\r\nA/60/PV.57\r\nin their efforts to achieve independence and self-\r\ndetermination.\r\nHowever, instability continues in the Middle\r\nEast, a situation characterized by the expansion of\r\nIsraeli settlements in the West Bank, the ongoing\r\nforeign occupation of Iraq and the threats being\r\nprepared against Syria, which make use of\r\ninconsistencies orchestrated in the Security Council.\r\nIn the past we had the opportunity to be informed\r\nof the situation prevailing in the occupied Arab\r\nterritories thanks to the valuable and dedicated work of\r\nthe various bodies established by the Organization to\r\ninvestigate actions committed against the Palestinian\r\npeople and to alleviate their suffering.\r\nThe statistics speak for themselves. From\r\n1 January to 19 August 2005 — in just seven and a half\r\nmonths — 146 Palestinians died in the West Bank and\r\nthe Gaza Strip. Since the beginning of the second\r\nintifada, 3,663 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli\r\nforces. The destructive fury of Israeli bulldozers has\r\nexpelled more than 16,000 Palestinians from their\r\nhomes in the past year. Clearly, an entire people is\r\nbeing massacred in a flagrant, massive and systematic\r\nmanner.\r\nIn spite of its withdrawal from the Gaza Strip,\r\nIsrael continues to illegally occupy or control great\r\nexpanses of Palestinian, Syrian and Lebanese territory,\r\nwhile failing to heed the numerous resolutions of the\r\nAssembly and the Security Council demanding the\r\nreturn of those territories. In that context, Cuba wishes\r\nto reaffirm the need for full compliance, without\r\nexception or discrimination, with all Security Council\r\nand General Assembly resolutions on the situation in\r\nthe Middle East, especially Council resolutions 242\r\n(1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978).\r\nIt is also worth mentioning that the Security\r\nCouncil has experienced ongoing obstruction by the\r\nUnited States with regard to this issue, especially\r\nduring the last five years of Republican\r\nAdministration. The historic tally of the Security\r\nCouncil’s work includes 29 vetoes, with many threats\r\nof more, in instances when the Council has attempted\r\nto adopt a draft resolution that would contribute to\r\nending the massacre of an entire people. The\r\ncustomary application of double standards and the\r\nvetoes and threats of veto to which I referred have\r\nsimply led to stagnation in the Council as regards this\r\nmatter.\r\nAs we have said before, we should not be\r\nconfused by the recent unilateral withdrawal of Israeli\r\ntroops from the Gaza Strip and the evacuation of\r\nsettlements there. We should not think that that is the\r\nbeginning of the end of Israel’s genocidal policy in the\r\narea or that it represents a way to reach a definitive\r\nsolution to the Palestinian issue. Israel continues to\r\ncontrol the airspace, the territorial borders and the sea.\r\nIsrael continues to be the occupying Power exercising\r\ncontrol over the area.\r\nIsrael is also continuing to build the illegal\r\nseparation wall, confiscating arable land from the\r\nfuture State of Palestine, separating families and\r\nimpeding the freedom of movement. The wall has left\r\nmore than 20,000 Palestinians without a way to earn a\r\nliving and has stripped them of their patrimony. It has\r\nalso led to the confiscation of thousands of hectares of\r\nland and water wells in the West Bank, which is\r\ntantamount to the de facto seizure of approximately 60\r\nper cent of the territory, including East Jerusalem.\r\nEntire Palestinian areas have been deprived access to\r\nvital basic services, including education, health and\r\nemployment.\r\nThe provisions of resolution ES-10/15 have also\r\nbeen ignored. In quoting the advisory opinion of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice, resolution ES-10/15\r\nstates, in its twentieth preambular paragraph, that\r\n“The construction of the wall being built by\r\nIsrael, the occupying Power, in the Occupied\r\nPalestinian Territory, including in and around\r\nEast Jerusalem, and its associated regime, are\r\ncontrary to international law”.\r\nThe United Nations should continue to work to\r\nachieve just and lasting peace in the region. The\r\ninternational community and this Organization have\r\nlong owed the Palestinian people its own State. All the\r\ntime and resources devoted to that goal are\r\ninsignificant compared to the debt owed by humankind\r\nto that suffering and heroic people. In that\r\nundertaking — as necessary as it is urgent — Cuba is\r\nmaking its usual constructive contribution and extends\r\nits support and solidarity to the United Nations and the\r\ninternational community.\r\nOur own country, which has been subjected to a\r\nharsh blockade by the Government of the United States\r\nfor over 45 years, is convinced that no wall, fence, or\r\nrepression — however violent or inhumane — is\r\ncapable of breaking the Palestinian people’s ardent\r\n22\r\nA/60/PV.57\r\ndesire for sovereignty and independence. It is for that\r\nreason that, thanks to our experience during more than\r\n45 years of resistance, Cuba supports a peaceful and\r\nnegotiated solution to the Palestinian issue. Cuba\r\nwould also like to reiterate its strong support for the\r\ninalienable right of the Palestinian people to establish\r\nan independent and sovereign State, with East\r\nJerusalem as its capital. We also demand the\r\nunconditional return of all Arab territories occupied by\r\nIsrael, and we reaffirm the illegal character of all\r\nIsraeli settlements in Arab territories occupied since\r\n1967, including the occupied Syrian Golan.\r\nIn conclusion, Cuba calls upon all delegations to\r\nvote in favour of the draft resolutions introduced under\r\nthe two agenda items under consideration, thereby\r\nexpressing their unwavering support to the just cause\r\nof the Palestinian people.\r\nMr. Abdelbari (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): The\r\nquestion of Palestine, which is at the heart of the\r\nconflict in the Middle East, is undoubtedly a focal\r\npoint for the entire world. The Palestinian tragedy has\r\nbecome a tragedy for the human conscience. The\r\ndeteriorating security situation and the continuing\r\nescalation of violence speak loudly to every human\r\nconscience and call for a firm stand against Israeli\r\narrogance and intransigence.\r\nIsrael’s arrogant attitude vis-à-vis resolutions of\r\ninternational legitimacy, on the one hand, and the\r\ninternational community’s lenience, on the other, have\r\nled Israel to commit massacres and barbaric acts\r\nagainst civilians and unarmed innocent people in all\r\nPalestinian areas, especially in the Gaza Strip\r\nfollowing the so-called withdrawal. They have even led\r\nIsrael to brutalize the Palestinian people with complete\r\nimpunity and to reject all relevant international\r\nresolutions.\r\nThe steadfast Palestinian people continues to face\r\nunjust Israeli practices and policies. Homes are\r\ndemolished with their inhabitants inside; land is\r\nconfiscated; elderly persons, the young, women,\r\nchildren and other unarmed Palestinians are killed.\r\nMore important and grave is the fact that Israel is\r\ncontinuing to build its illegal wall on usurped\r\nPalestinian territory, including in East Jerusalem. Israel\r\nis continuing its wanton aggression by destroying\r\nhomes and confiscating land, in clear and direct\r\nviolation of international law, international\r\nhumanitarian law and other international human rights\r\ninstruments.\r\nIsrael is also continuing to disregard General\r\nAssembly resolution ES-10/15, adopted at the tenth\r\nemergency special session, as well as the International\r\nCourt of Justice advisory opinion on the wall it is\r\nbuilding. The Court has declared that wall illegal and\r\nhas called for Israel to immediately cease its\r\nconstruction and to demolish what has already been\r\nbuilt, to repeal all legislation relating to the wall and to\r\npay compensation to those who have been harmed by\r\nit.\r\nThe credibility of this Organization should be\r\nreflected in its ability to uphold the Charter and\r\nimplement international law. The fact that this matter\r\nhas not been resolved is a testament to the existence of\r\na policy of double standards and selectivity in the\r\napplication of Security Council resolutions and\r\ninternational law as adopted by the General Assembly\r\nand the Economic and Social Council.\r\nThat fact also attests to the shameful silence that\r\nexists with regard to a clear violation of the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations and of the principles of\r\ninternational humanitarian law, in particular the fourth\r\nGeneva Convention of 1949 and The Hague\r\nConventions of 1899 and 1907, and other agreements.\r\nIt is incumbent upon all concerned to oblige\r\nIsrael fully to withdraw from Arab territories occupied\r\nsince 4 June 1967, including Jerusalem and the\r\noccupied Syrian Golan, as well as the Shaba’a Farms in\r\nLebanon, in implementation of the principle of land for\r\npeace and of the relevant United Nations resolutions,\r\nforemost among which are General Assembly\r\nresolution 181 (II) and Security Council resolutions\r\n242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 1397 (2002), and in\r\nkeeping with the decisions taken at Oslo and Madrid,\r\nother relevant Security Council resolutions, and the\r\nroad map that has been agreed to by all.\r\nMy delegation would like to urge the\r\ninternational community and its member States\r\nurgently to provide economic and technical assistance\r\nto the Palestinian people and to the Palestinian\r\nNational Authority during this delicate phase in order\r\nto help alleviate the suffering of the Palestinian people\r\nand to enable it to rebuild its economy and the basic\r\ninfrastructure of the State of Palestine.\r\n23\r\nA/60/PV.57\r\nWe would like also to reiterate our unswerving\r\nsupport for the Palestinian cause and for the draft\r\nresolutions submitted to the General Assembly in that\r\nregard. We would like also to urge all Member States\r\nto take the same stance as they have in the past.\r\nMr. O’Brien (United States of America): The\r\nUnited States remains firmly committed to achieving a\r\njust and lasting peace in the Middle East. We\r\nwelcomed the successful withdrawal of Israeli settlers\r\nfrom the northern West Bank and Gaza earlier this\r\nyear. United States efforts continue to focus on\r\nsustaining momentum on economic and security issues\r\nafter disengagement in order to make progress along\r\nthe road map towards President Bush’s vision of a two-\r\nState solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\r\nThe 15 November agreement on movement and\r\naccess between Israel and the Palestinian Authority is\r\nan important step forward. For the first time since\r\n1967, Palestinians will control access at the Rafah\r\ncrossing, which opened on 25 November. We will\r\ncontinue to work via the Quartet Special Envoy and\r\nUnited States Security Coordinator missions on the\r\neconomic and security agenda and maintain the\r\nmomentum for disengagement. The Quartet’s recent\r\ndecision to extend the Special Envoy mission through\r\nMarch 2006 and the President’s recent nomination of\r\nMajor General Keith Dayton to serve as our new\r\nSecurity Coordinator in the region highlight our\r\ncontinued commitment in that regard.\r\nAll parties have obligations that they must fulfil\r\nin order to achieve the objective of two democratic\r\nStates, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace\r\nand security. While the United States shares concerns\r\nabout the hardships facing the Palestinian people, the\r\ndraft resolutions that the General Assembly will\r\nconsider today and tomorrow reflect neither the\r\ncomplexities of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict nor the\r\nneed for both parties to take steps to advance the goal\r\nof peace and security for Israelis and Palestinians alike.\r\nThe General Assembly is being asked to view\r\nevents in the region through the distorted lens of one-\r\nsided perceptions. Endorsing draft resolutions that\r\ncondemn Israeli actions but fail to address Palestinian\r\nactions or inaction has real consequences. One-sided\r\ndraft resolutions such as the ones before us today\r\nundermine the ability of the United Nations to play a\r\nconstructive role in furthering peace.\r\nSpecifically, in the view of the United States, the\r\n1975 mandate establishing the Committee on the\r\nExercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian\r\nPeople and the 1977 mandate establishing the Division\r\nfor Palestinian Rights within the Secretariat perpetuate\r\na skewed and biased approach to the Middle East\r\nconflict. Those bodies reflect a cold-war era gone by\r\nand have long since outlived whatever usefulness they\r\nmay once have had. Member States should eliminate\r\nthose bodies and seek ways to reinvigorate the United\r\nNations as an even-handed partner in seeking peace\r\nbetween the Israelis and Palestinians, committed to the\r\nroad map and to the realization of the two-State vision.\r\nDuring this sixtieth session of the General\r\nAssembly, as the United Nations considers historic\r\nsteps to reform itself and its institutions to better face\r\nthe challenges of a new century, it must examine old\r\nmandates such as these with a critical eye and confront\r\nthe reality that the time for such bodies has passed.\r\nThe United States would welcome a draft\r\nresolution that reflected a balanced and pragmatic\r\napproach consistent with that of the Quartet.\r\nUnfortunately, it appears that we will be considering\r\ntexts that put the General Assembly in the position of\r\nattempting to prejudge and prejudice the settlement of\r\nfinal status issues. To achieve a just and lasting peace,\r\nthose issues must be decided through negotiations\r\nbetween the parties themselves, consistent with their\r\npast agreements and with the relevant Security Council\r\nresolutions. Therefore, we will not support these\r\nunbalanced draft resolutions, which do nothing to\r\nfurther the cause of peace between Israel and the\r\nPalestinians, and we urge other Member States to\r\nwithhold their support as well.\r\nMr. Sallam (Saudi Arabia) (spoke in Arabic):\r\nThe report of the Committee on the Exercise of the\r\nInalienable Rights of the Palestinian People confirms\r\nreports of the perpetration by the Israeli occupying\r\nPower of inhumane acts against the Palestinian people\r\nand the tragic situation of the Palestinian people,\r\ntrapped in their own territory and suffering all types of\r\nrepression, including acts of violence and\r\nassassinations.\r\nAfter 38 years, the Israeli occupation continues to\r\nbear down on the Palestinian people. Their standard of\r\nliving continues to deteriorate, as does their security,\r\neconomic and social situation, because of Israeli\r\n24\r\nA/60/PV.57\r\npolicies and practices that violate international and\r\ncustomary humanitarian law.\r\nDespite all the international efforts deployed by\r\nthe Quartet, which led to the road map as a means of\r\nsettling the conflict by providing a timetable for the\r\ngranting to the Palestinian people of their legitimate\r\npolitical rights, Israel continues obdurately to refuse to\r\nyield and to reject one initiative after the other. It has\r\nrefused to resume negotiations, and it continues to\r\nerect obstacles and to create new realities on the\r\nground in order to prevent the resumption of\r\nnegotiations, showing a great indifference to the\r\ncontinuing cycle of violence, tension and instability in\r\nthe region.\r\nThe policies and arbitrary actions carried out by\r\nthe Israeli Government will not bring security to the\r\nIsraeli people; to the contrary, they only increase the\r\nlevel of violence and suffering for the victims,\r\nthreatening stability in the region while dispelling any\r\nhope for peace. Security cannot be achieved by\r\nconfiscating land, denying rights, murdering\r\nneighbours, demolishing houses and destroying crops\r\nand farm lands, thereby making people hungry and\r\npreventing them from earning a living. Security cannot\r\nby achieved by arrogantly announcing lists of\r\nPalestinian political activists whom the Israeli\r\nGovernment intends to assassinate or by defying the\r\nhundreds of United Nations decisions concerning\r\nIsrael’s practices and activities, its flouting of the 1949\r\nFourth Geneva Convention, its contempt for\r\ninternational resolutions on Jerusalem and its refusal to\r\nrecognize resolutions concerning the deportation of\r\ncivilians and the protection of Palestinian rights and\r\npeople.\r\nThe path towards the settlement of international\r\ndisputes can be found only by complying with the\r\nresolutions and principles of international legality. That\r\nis the only way to reduce tension and to prevent\r\nfrustration and despair from reaching the boiling point\r\nas a result of occupation, injustice and aggression. We\r\nmust work together to find a comprehensive and just\r\nsolution to the Arab-Israeli conflict. Therefore, we\r\nmust mobilize all our efforts to lend renewed impetus\r\nto the peace process in the Middle East, which has\r\nbeen stagnant for so long because of the double\r\nstandards and selectivity that gave rise to continued\r\nviolations of international resolutions and principles.\r\nSaudi Arabia reaffirms its full support for the\r\nstruggle of the Palestinian people to recover all its\r\nlegitimate political rights. We call upon Israel to\r\nhonour its commitments and to abide by Security\r\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973),\r\ntogether with all other relevant international\r\nresolutions concerning the Palestinian question. These\r\ninclude the principle of land for peace, the Arab peace\r\ninitiative, bilateral agreements between Israel and the\r\nPalestinian Authority and the road map with all its\r\nprovisions. Furthermore, we call upon Israel to stop\r\ntormenting the Palestinian people, to stop building the\r\nseparation wall and to release Palestinian detainees.\r\nSaudi Arabia believes that Israel’s pullout from\r\nGaza is a first step that should be followed by\r\nadditional steps, in accordance with the relevant United\r\nNations resolutions, in order to pave the way for the\r\nestablishment of an independent Palestinian State on\r\nPalestinian territory with East Jerusalem as its capital.\r\nWe call for the resumption of the peace process so that\r\nIsrael can withdraw from the occupied Syrian Golan to\r\nthe 4 June 1967 borders and from other occupied Arab\r\nterritories in southern Lebanon with a view to a\r\nnegotiated and comprehensive solution aimed at\r\nestablishing a lasting, just and comprehensive peace in\r\nthe region, which can lead to a Middle East free from\r\nweapons of mass destruction.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): We\r\nhave heard the last speaker on the list for agenda item\r\n15 at this meeting. One delegation has asked to speak\r\nin right of reply.\r\nI now give the floor to the observer of Palestine.\r\nMr. Mansour (Palestine): My delegation did not\r\nintend to take the floor again after the statement of our\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs. However, we found\r\nourselves in a position to respond to some of the\r\ncomments made by a delegation that asked for the\r\nelimination of two important Committees established\r\nthrough General Assembly resolutions. That delegation\r\nalso asked the Assembly to re-examine the mandate of\r\nthose two Committees.\r\nWe believe that, on the basis of democracy and\r\nacceptance of the will of the Member States of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, programmes related to Palestine are\r\nevaluated in a democratic manner by the entire\r\nmembership of the General Assembly. It has been the\r\nwill of the overwhelming majority of the Assembly to\r\ndecide every year to extend the mandates of those\r\n25\r\nA/60/PV.57\r\nimportant Committees and programmes until a just\r\nsolution to the question of Palestine can be found on\r\nthe basis of the will of the international community.\r\nFurthermore, we were surprised to hear a\r\nstatement suggesting that a General Assembly\r\nresolution prejudged the settlement in the Middle East.\r\nSo is it that Assembly resolutions reflecting\r\ninternational law and reiterating principles of\r\ninternational law prejudge the settlement, while illegal\r\nsettlements on the ground, illegal construction of the\r\nwall and the illegal actions carried out by the Israeli\r\noccupying Power in suppressing the Palestinian people\r\nand in committing oppressive and abhorrent violations\r\nof the rights of the Palestinian people do not prejudge\r\nthe settlement? We leave it up to all countries and their\r\ndelegations to make a true and accurate determination\r\nas to what is really correct, what is fair, what is one-\r\nsided and what is balanced.\r\nI wish to conclude by referring to two other\r\nissues. First, the position of the delegation to which I\r\njust referred is, frankly speaking, extremely political. It\r\nis a traditional position that shields Israel from the wall\r\nof all the relevant decisions of the international\r\ncommunity and from international law. That position,\r\nshielding the wrong thing — the illegal acts that Israeli\r\nis committing — is what allows Israel to continue its\r\nintransigence in refusing to fulfil its Charter\r\nobligations and to implement all those resolutions.\r\nSecondly, the statement and the position of that\r\ndelegation are, frankly speaking, anti-Palestinian. We\r\nhave been very positive in our attitude towards\r\nestablishing a relationship and carrying out dialogue\r\nand meetings in good faith with that specific country,\r\nin the spirit of implementing United Nations and\r\nSecurity Council resolutions and the mandate of the\r\nQuartet. But I find that statement — which I cannot\r\ndescribe in any other way than as anti-Palestinian —\r\nvery unfortunate, especially as we are extending our\r\nhand in a positive way to that country in order to\r\nestablish a very positive relationship and so that that\r\ncountry can take a balanced and fair position with\r\nregard to the conflict. As we have heard it expressed\r\nthis evening, we find that anti-Palestinian position very\r\nunfortunate. We hope that country will reconsider its\r\nposition in future interventions.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): We\r\nhave heard the last speaker in the debate on agenda\r\nitem 37 for this meeting.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nI should like to remind members that the General\r\nAssembly will continue consideration of agenda item\r\n17, “The situation in Afghanistan and its implications\r\nfor international peace and security”, and sub-item (e)\r\nof agenda item 73, “Emergency international assistance\r\nfor peace, normalcy and reconstruction of war-stricken\r\nAfghanistan”, tomorrow morning at 10 a.m., as the\r\nfirst item. As members will, recall there were speakers\r\nstill remaining on the list at this morning’s debate.\r\nThe Assembly will also resume its consideration\r\nof agenda item 41, “Report of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil”, to take action on draft resolutions A/60/L.21\r\nand A/60/L.24. After that, we will continue debate on\r\nagenda item 15.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.05 p.m.\r\n"
