(President of the Gabonese Republic)\r\nCo-Chairperson: Mr. Göran Persson . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Sweden)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAddresses on the occasion of the High-level Plenary\r\nMeeting (continued)\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Serene Highness\r\nPrince Albert II of the Principality of Monaco.\r\nPrince Albert (spoke in French): It is with\r\nemotion and gratitude that I take the floor to address\r\nthe Assembly today, for I recall the tribute paid by the\r\nGeneral Assembly to my father, Prince Rainier III, on\r\nthe very day of his passing, 6 April 2005. His\r\ncommitment to multilateralism and his firm belief in\r\nthe irreplaceable role of the United Nations were\r\nrightly evoked. I should like to state that I fully share\r\nhis values.\r\nMy thoughts, sympathy, compassion and\r\nfriendship go out to the southern states of the United\r\nStates grieved by the destruction caused by hurricane\r\nKatrina, as well as to the families of the victims and all\r\nthose who have been sorely affected by that natural\r\ndisaster.\r\nI should like to congratulate President Jan\r\nEliasson, whose election coincides with the centennial\r\nanniversary of the birth of his illustrious countryman\r\nDag Hammarskjöld. I express my deep gratitude to\r\nPresident Ping for his exceptional contribution to the\r\nreform of our Organization. Lastly, I wish to commend\r\nthe tireless commitment of Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan. Without their devotion, the outcome document\r\nbefore us, which has my countrys support, would not\r\nhave succeeded in charting the course for the renewal\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nAlong road lies ahead, however. It is\r\nunacceptable that poverty, hunger and disease continue\r\nto afflict so many regions of the world, and in\r\nparticular in Africa. It was for that reason that I wished\r\nMonaco to subscribe to the Declaration on innovative\r\nsources of financing for development. In that\r\nconnection, I reaffirm the commitment of my country\r\nto the Millennium Development Goals. In the coming\r\nyears, we will significantly increase our official\r\ndevelopment assistance through a very intensive\r\ncooperation policy that we are already implementing,\r\neither directly through targeted multilateral and\r\nbilateral action or alongside the effective non-\r\ngovernmental organizations that we actively support.\r\nPromoting development does not mean\r\nsacrificing the environment. Aware as we are of our\r\ncommon responsibilities towards the least developed\r\ncountries, we should not exacerbate the imbalances of\r\nour planet. Let us bear in mind future generations.\r\nSince the oceanographic expeditions led a century ago\r\nby my forebear, Prince Albert I, Monaco has always\r\nbeen deeply involved in the protection of the oceans\r\nand the planet.\r\nPrince Rainier III, my father, supported extensive\r\nresearch in this field and contributed to the\r\n2\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\nestablishment of protected marine zones in the\r\nMediterranean.\r\nFor my part, I have thus requested the start,\r\nwithout further delay, of the procedures to allow\r\nMonaco to ratify the Kyoto Protocol and support the\r\nconversion of the United Nations Environment\r\nProgramme into a specialized agency with a broader\r\nmandate.\r\nWe must also work on implementing the Plan of\r\nAction adopted at the Hyogo Conference by\r\nstrengthening international cooperation to better\r\nprevent and reduce risks of natural disasters and to\r\ngive ourselves an organization and more effective\r\nmeans to make the world a safer place.\r\nFaced with genocide, ethnic cleansing and crimes\r\nagainst humanity, we must adopt the responsibility to\r\nprotect principle as a basis for collective action. I can\r\nonly endorse the often-expressed sentiment that it is\r\nthe international communitys duty to act to protect\r\npeople in danger when that responsibility is not\r\nassumed by the State concerned or by the regional\r\norganization to which it belongs.\r\nThe international community must also protect\r\nchildren from odious crimes of which they are the\r\nvictims, and, in addition to the provisions of existing\r\nconventions, I believe it is essential to adopt rules\r\naimed at ensuring that the perpetrators of such crimes\r\ndo not go unpunished.\r\nI also unequivocally condemn terrorism. It\r\nviolates all religious and moral principles by purposely\r\nattacking helpless human beings and too often,\r\nchildren. Let us combat terrorism and finalize without\r\ndelay a comprehensive international convention for the\r\nprevention and control of terrorism, as we did with\r\nrespect to the International Convention against Nuclear\r\nTerrorism, which I have just signed.\r\nLastly, let us lay the groundwork for a partnership\r\namong civilizations, based on genuine dialogue. This\r\nindeed is the wise choice and the only way to settle\r\nconflict and defuse the crises that are tearing apart\r\ntodays societies.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Victor\r\nYushchenko, President of Ukraine.\r\nPresident Yushchenko (spoke in Ukrainian;\r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): The\r\nanniversary of the United Nations is a celebration of\r\nhope for all humanity. The whole history of our unique\r\nforum convinces us that peoples of different nations\r\nand cultures are able to hear and support each other.\r\nChurchill said, We must make sure that [the United\r\nNations] is  a true temple of peace  and not merely\r\na cockpit in a Tower of Babel. I truly believe that we\r\nwill live up to humanitys expectations.\r\nAt this meeting, the international community is\r\nestablishing new guidelines for the third millennium.\r\nThe new Ukraine, free and independent, is following\r\nthis process, along with the whole family of democratic\r\nnations. I believe that the efforts and experience of my\r\ncountry will contribute to finding important\r\nbenchmarks.\r\nI am the son of a soldier who fought in World\r\nWar II, whose lot it was to see battle, be wounded and\r\nexperience the horrors of Auschwitz. Millions did not\r\nsurvive. Millions of men and women died. Every\r\nUkrainian family has a living memory of pain and loss.\r\nThanks to its heroic contribution to the victory over\r\nNazism, Ukraine gained the honour and the right to\r\nbecome one of the founders the United Nations. We\r\ncontributed our aspiration for peace.\r\nWe always stand ready to counteract the threat of\r\nwar everywhere. I hope that Ukrainian peacekeepers\r\nunder the United Nations flag will once again prove\r\ntheir courage and professionalism. As a representative\r\nof a nation which, shoulder to shoulder with free\r\nnations, liberated humankind from the Nazi threat, I\r\nam convinced that we can liberate humanity from other\r\ndeadly threats.\r\nIn recent days, we honoured the memory of those\r\nwho died on 11 September. Ukraine is an active\r\nparticipant in the fight against terrorism. We believe\r\nthat the international community should do everything\r\npossible to eradicate the breeding ground of the virus\r\nof terror: intolerance, tyranny, poverty and humiliation.\r\nUkraine has already contributed much to security\r\nin the world by giving up its nuclear weapons. We can\r\nput nuclear technologies under rigid international\r\ncontrol. We must prevent the proliferation of nuclear\r\nweapons.\r\nNext year will mark the twentieth anniversary of\r\nthe Chernobyl disaster. I strongly believe that this will\r\nbe an important opportunity to grasp the universal\r\n3\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\nsocial and cultural extent of the tragedy. It will enable\r\nus to join our efforts to deal with the aftermath.\r\nWe must prevent crimes against humanity. I speak\r\nto you as the representative of a nation that lost ten\r\nmillion lives to deliberately caused famine. At that\r\ntime, many other countries turned their back on our\r\ntragedy. We insist that the international community tell\r\nthe truth about that crime. Only by doing so can we\r\nensure that tolerance never encourages criminals.\r\nThe high ideals of the United Nations have\r\nalways encouraged people to fight for their\r\nindependence and freedom. The peaceful victory in\r\nIndependence Square in Kyiv opened up new\r\nopportunities. Our nation put an end to the past and\r\nnobody can now turn back. We are determined to create\r\na free market society with an economy that will be\r\nintegrated into the world economy. We have received a\r\nhistoric opportunity to be a part of United Europe and\r\nwe have the road map which will bring us closer to\r\nEurope.\r\nUkraine is very conscious of its responsibilities,\r\nand once again we would like to reconfirm our\r\ncommitment to international development as enshrined\r\nin the Millennium Declaration. We are ready to provide\r\nour support for that achievement, ready to act as\r\npartners in all humanitarian, economic and social\r\nprojects and ready to look for opportunities to\r\nconsolidate the efforts. I am quite sure that those\r\nefforts will expand as United Nations reform goes\r\nforward, and the key element will be the reform of the\r\nUnited Nations Security Council. In order to become\r\nmore active, the composition of the Security Council\r\nshould reflect the realities of today. It will be fairer if\r\nall regions, including Eastern Europe, are represented.\r\nSixty years ago, Franklin Roosevelt said that we\r\nshould secure and share our friendship with the world.\r\nIf this was achieved, we would be able to meet the\r\ngreat goals of humanity. The United Nations has\r\nsucceeded in establishing the foundation for that. Thus,\r\nwe can proceed together. We hope that peace, welfare,\r\nfreedom and justice for every nation will be achieved.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, President of\r\nEquatorial Guinea.\r\nPresident Obiang Nguema Mbasogo (spoke in\r\nSpanish): Five years after the Millennium Summit, we\r\nhave agreed to come together once again, in this global\r\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly\r\nto assess the degree of implementation and the results\r\nof the measures and strategies that were agreed on in\r\n2000 and at other summits of the United Nations\r\nsystem, with a view to bringing about a more\r\ndeveloped and integrated world, safeguarded by\r\ncollective peace and security and where men and\r\nwomen can live in dignity and enjoy their inalienable\r\nrights under the protection of the law.\r\nWe have followed  horrified  the terrible\r\ndamage done by Hurricane Katrina as it crossed the\r\nGulf coast of the United States of America, causing the\r\nloss of many lives and harm to property. This disaster\r\nand others like the tsunami call upon us to act with\r\nsolidarity in order to prevent further sacrifice. We\r\nexpress our condolences to the Government of the\r\nUnited States of America and to the victims. To them\r\nwe express our solidarity and our desire that their lives\r\nwill soon be able to return to normal.\r\nWe congratulate the United Nations, which over\r\nthe past 30 years has been encouraging and facilitating\r\nencounters such as this one, fostering the growth of a\r\nuniversal conscience so that our endeavours to restore\r\nhuman dignity may lead to peace, stability and socio-\r\neconomic development.\r\nNevertheless, we observe with concern that\r\ndespite this arduous labour of awakening the worlds\r\nconscience, the excellent declarations adopted and the\r\nprogrammes agreed upon, we are still a very long way\r\naway from bringing about a world of well-being for all.\r\nIn point of fact, the difficult subject of poverty  so\r\ncomplex to eradicate  requires multidimensional\r\nefforts and the involvement of all players in human\r\nsociety so that both the poor and the rich, the victims\r\nand the beneficiaries of the current social\r\ninequalities  everyone  should be crucial players in\r\nthe fight against the sorry state of humankind.\r\nIndeed, many feel that poverty, which is the fruit\r\nof underdevelopment, arises because of the lack of\r\nresponsibility of some Governments that have been\r\nunable to judiciously administer their economic\r\nresources and cultural values, conforming to oligarchic\r\nsystems imposed by current trade relations. Certainly,\r\nwe are facing a situation that calls out to us all,\r\nbecause we are being asked to abandon the practices of\r\nthe old system, which does not recognize the positive\r\nvalues of humanity. We are trying to put an end to a\r\n4\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\nlong history of unfair competition that can only\r\nperpetuate the poverty of the weakest, insecurity,\r\ninstability and violence.\r\nThe situation demands our attention because the\r\nexperience of the United Nations shows that the\r\ninterdependence of nations must take precedence in\r\nrelations between States. It has been shown that\r\nhowever economically or militarily powerful a nation\r\nis, it cannot fight alone against the effects of the\r\nchilling terrorism that the nations of the world are\r\ncurrently facing. We have also understood that the\r\nhunger, dire poverty and underdevelopment endured by\r\nmany countries cannot be eliminated without the help\r\nof wealthy countries  which became so at the\r\nexpense of the weak ones.\r\nThe United Nations is called upon to act because\r\nits Members are afraid of their own resolutions. Many\r\nmighty nations do not want to reallocate their military\r\nbudgets to aid poorer countries. They are afraid of\r\nspending a minimal percentage of their gross national\r\nproduct to support development programmes for the\r\ncountries in greatest need and are resisting forgiving\r\nthe debt of the poorest countries at whose expense they\r\nhave been able to accumulate their capital reserves.\r\nIn that regard, we would like to congratulate the\r\ncountries of the Group of Eight for having forgiven the\r\ndebt of some poor countries.\r\nIn the light of this selfishness and lack of\r\nsolidarity and in the absence of international\r\ncooperation, Equatorial Guinea has understood that the\r\nmain responsibility for achieving the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals falls directly on ones own\r\nGovernment. In Equatorial Guinea we stress a policy\r\nthat focuses on the people: a practical humanism that\r\nattempts to put a human face on democracy, justice,\r\nfreedom, cooperation and globalization.\r\nIn order to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger,\r\nto achieve universal primary education, to promote\r\ngender equality and freedom for women, to reduce\r\ninfant mortality, to improve maternal health, to fight\r\nagainst HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases, to\r\nguarantee the sustainability of the environment and to\r\npromote a world association for development in\r\naddition to the programmes currently being\r\nimplemented, my Government has just set up a social\r\ndevelopment fund which accounts for 40 per cent of\r\nthe general State budget for the year 2005.\r\nClearly, without money no country can achieve,\r\neven minimally, the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nWe understand the problems faced by countries not\r\nlucky enough to possess exploitable economic\r\nresources, so we call upon the richer countries to\r\ndemonstrate their solidarity and humanism by releasing\r\nfunds and transferring technology, in the manner set\r\nout in the draft outcome document that is before the\r\nGeneral Assembly (A/60/L.1).\r\nObviously, we need huge sums of money to\r\nachieve our goals. That is why, in support of the\r\nFrench proposal to adopt innovative mechanisms for\r\nfinancing, we feel it is necessary to establish national\r\nand international solidarity levies. We therefore agree\r\nthat a levy should be imposed on airline tickets in order\r\nto deal with such grave, endemic diseases as\r\nHIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. My delegation\r\nwould be even happier if such a solidarity levy could\r\nalso be extended to the investments made by major\r\nmultinational companies, because of the benefits that\r\nthey receive from the poorest countries.\r\nI would like to conclude my statement by\r\nencouraging everyone to act in a spirit of solidarity in\r\nadopting the draft outcome document submitted by the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly and to take the\r\nnecessary action to implement its provisions for the\r\nbenefit of all humankind.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Hifikepunye Pohamba, President of the Republic\r\nof Namibia.\r\nPresident Pohamba: I wish to congratulate the\r\nCo-Chairpersons on their election and on the efficient\r\nmanner in which they are guiding the deliberations of\r\nthis High-level Plenary Meeting.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to express\r\nour sympathy and condolences to the people of the\r\nUnited States of America for the loss of life and the\r\ndestruction caused by Hurricane Katrina.\r\nSince the achievement of our independence 15\r\nyears ago, the Government of Namibia has assumed the\r\nhistoric task of redressing the human, social and\r\neconomic consequences suffered by our people during\r\nthe years of apartheid colonialism. In 1990, the World\r\nBank estimated our per capita income at $1,200,\r\nranking Namibia as a low middle-income country.\r\n5\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\nHowever, on a closer look, that figure reveals many\r\ncontradictions.\r\nWe inherited a dual society with the worst income\r\ndisparities seen anywhere in the world. Five percent of\r\nthe population had access to modern infrastructure and\r\nto a formal economy, and approximately 0.3 per cent\r\nowned 44 per cent of the land, while the remainder of\r\nthe population occupied only 41 per cent. On the other\r\nhand, 95 per cent of the people lived in poverty. They\r\ndid not have access to electricity, clean water or\r\nsanitary facilities. They suffered the effects of poor\r\nnutrition and diseases. One out of 10 children died\r\nbefore the age of 5.\r\nThose are stark legacies of apartheid colonialism.\r\nSince independence, we have moved with a clear intent\r\nto reverse them, and we have made tremendous\r\nprogress. We are moving with the same resolve to\r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nTherefore, we count on our development partners to\r\njoin us in our efforts to translate the noble development\r\nobjectives into concrete outcomes so that we can\r\npromote social justice, democracy, peace and the\r\nwelfare of all our people.\r\nBy adopting the Millennium Development Goals,\r\nMember States have taken a bold and historic step. Our\r\nresolve should therefore propel us towards a new dawn\r\nof hope to conquer poverty, hunger, ignorance and\r\ndisease. We must mobilize resources and bring within\r\nthe reach of billions of people the hope that they and\r\ntheir children can have a better life.\r\nLet us join hands and move forward to find\r\npractical solutions to the challenges of our time. We\r\nhave a sacred duty and a noble mission. We should not\r\nbe found wanting.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Kessai\r\nNote, President of the Republic of the Marshall\r\nIslands.\r\nPresident Note: A warm greeting of Iokwe from\r\nthe people of the Republic of the Marshall Islands at\r\nthis pivotal gathering.\r\nOn behalf of the people and the Government of\r\nthe Marshall Islands, I wish to express our condolences\r\nand sympathies to the victims and families who have\r\nsuffered severely as a result of the recent catastrophic\r\nHurricane Katrina in the United States.\r\nI join my colleagues in commending the\r\nSecretary-General for his report In larger freedom:\r\ntowards development, security and human rights for\r\nall (A/59/2005).\r\nI reaffirm the commitment of the Marshall\r\nIslands to the principles of democracy, respect for\r\nhuman rights and the right of peoples to self-\r\ndetermination, in conformity with the principles of\r\njustice and international law. The 23 million people of\r\nTaiwan represent too significant a portion of the\r\nworlds population to be denied membership again and\r\nagain in an Organization that adheres to the principles\r\nof universality and self-determination among the\r\npeoples of the world.\r\nFor 60 years, the vision, values and principles\r\nespoused in the Charter of the United Nations have\r\nguided the Organization, which remains our last, best\r\nhope, in an age when new dangers are emerging, for\r\nfinding practicable measures that will lighten for\r\npeace-loving peoples the crushing burdens of\r\ninfectious diseases, terrorism, armaments and the\r\nfallout of nuclear-weapon tests.\r\nFounded to provide for the collective security of\r\nsovereign nations, the Organization is now charged\r\nwith managing a number of new dangers that require\r\nour joint response. Once charged with protecting\r\nnational borders, we are all called upon to address\r\ndangers that know no borders.\r\nAs important to the Marshall Islands as potential\r\nterrorist threats are the social, economic and\r\nenvironmental vulnerabilities that we continue to face\r\nand endure. The support of the international\r\ncommunity and the full implementation of\r\ninternationally agreed principles and goals are crucial\r\nfor our sustainable development.\r\nAround the world, the exploitation of people,\r\nlands, oceans and the environment continue to pose\r\nreal and immediate threats to the very existence of\r\nMarshall Islands. Global warming and sea-level rise\r\ncontinue to threaten us. The Marshall Islands reiterates\r\nits call to those States that have not ratified the Kyoto\r\nProtocol to do so without delay and to take further\r\nsteps fully to implement the Framework Convention on\r\nClimate Change and the Protocol. Without such global\r\nactions to mitigate climate change and arrest sea-level\r\nrise, our national efforts towards sustainable\r\ndevelopment will be rendered meaningless, and my\r\npeople will become environmental refugees.\r\n6\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\nThe Marshall Islands power lies not in our\r\neconomic strength but in our ability to cooperate. We\r\nremain an active Member of this Organization despite\r\nthe resultant financial burden on our small economy.\r\nWe are hopeful that our smallness and remoteness will\r\nnot hinder us from receiving the benefits that this\r\nOrganization provides to small island States like mine.\r\nThe Marshall Islands is grateful to those Member\r\nStates that continue to provide us access to training and\r\ntechnology, as well as to the United Nations funds,\r\nprogrammes and specialized agencies that support our\r\ncapacity-building. Continued commitment is vital in\r\nnurturing the development of the Marshallese people\r\nso that they can become self-reliant.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration we adopted five\r\nyears ago has led to the articulation of eight specific\r\nMillennium Development Goals to be achieved by\r\n2015. While many countries are on track, broad regions\r\nare far off track to achieve most or all of the Goals.\r\nThe Marshall Islands remains committed to reaching\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals and targets.\r\nAchievement of the Goals, however, cannot be fully\r\naccomplished in the absence of the complete\r\nimplementation of the Mauritius Strategy for the\r\nFurther Implementation of the Programme of Action\r\nfor the Sustainable Development of Small Island\r\nDeveloping States.\r\nWorking together, we can leave our children the\r\nlegacy of a better future by setting a new global agenda\r\nentailing bold actions and by shaping an effective and\r\nreformed United Nations. I wish to emphasize my\r\nsupport of the reform of the United Nations Secretariat\r\nand of the Security Council, in particular the inclusion\r\nof Japan as a permanent member; and the\r\nestablishment of the Peacebuilding Commission, the\r\nHuman Rights Council, Democracy Initiatives and the\r\nDemocracy Fund.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Valdas\r\nAdamkus, President of the Republic of Lithuania.\r\nPresident Adamkus: Allow me to begin by\r\nexpressing my appreciation for the leadership of\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan and for the\r\ndetermination of outgoing General Assembly President\r\nJean Ping for having taken up and promoted with great\r\ndedication and vigour the comprehensive reform\r\nagenda of the Organization.\r\nThe world has changed significantly since the\r\nfoundation of the United Nations, and our Organization\r\nmust change accordingly in order to be able to fully\r\nand effectively respond to the expectations of our\r\nnations. I believe, therefore, that the implementation of\r\nthe Millennium Declaration and a comprehensive\r\nreform of the Organization must go hand in hand.\r\nThe courage to change must be an essential\r\nattribute of this summit  the courage to embrace a\r\nUnited Nations reform that reaffirms and locks in the\r\nintrinsic links between development, security and\r\nhuman rights, and the courage to implement to the\r\nfullest the United Nations goal of being a centre for\r\nharmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of\r\ncommon ends.\r\nWe cannot approach this summit as business as\r\nusual. There can be no business as usual in a world\r\nwhich explores the farthest reaches of the universe yet\r\ncontinues to watch millions of people die from\r\nstarvation  a world where terrorism spreads fear and\r\nhorror among nations, where transnational crime,\r\nlawlessness and corruption make a mockery of human\r\nhopes for a decent existence, where preventable\r\ninfectious diseases and natural disasters destroy\r\nnumerous lives and wipe out entire areas. The United\r\nNations, created to deal with the legacy of the Second\r\nWorld War, must now stand up to these new threats and\r\nchallenges. For it to be able do so, a comprehensive\r\nreform of the United Nations is necessary, including a\r\nmajor management overhaul aimed at ensuring greater\r\naccountability, transparency, efficiency and\r\nprofessionalism.\r\nWe can no longer delay reform of the Security\r\nCouncil, an essential body which should be fully\r\nequipped and enjoy the requisite legitimacy to operate\r\nin a world that presents it with increasingly challenging\r\ntasks. Lithuania has consistently maintained that the\r\nSecurity Council should be expanded in both\r\ncategories of membership, with the inclusion of new\r\nmajor international actors as permanent members.\r\nIt is essential that we reaffirm our previous\r\ncommitments. But we must go much further. We must\r\nbuild a United Nations for the twenty-first century.\r\nInsistence on preserving the status quo of this most\r\ninclusive multilateral Organization will not protect us\r\nfrom the horrors of poverty and extremism or from the\r\nthreat of weapons of mass destruction getting into the\r\n7\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\nhands of terrorists, or from the increasing threat of\r\nenvironmental degradation.\r\nOur shared responsibility as world leaders is\r\nparamount. It is our duty to adopt here, in New York,\r\nsubstantial and far-reaching decisions. We, developed\r\nand developing countries alike, must work together to\r\naccelerate progress towards achievement of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals across the globe and\r\nespecially in Africa. The recent commitment by the\r\nEuropean Union (EU) to increase levels of official\r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) underlines the priority\r\nthat the EU attaches to this immense task.\r\nAs a new donor country, Lithuania fully\r\nsubscribes to those commitments. We know that it will\r\ntake us time to measure up to common donorship\r\nlevels. But we are moving ahead, providing advice and\r\nassistance from our immediate neighbourhood to the\r\nSouth Caucasus, to Iraq and Afghanistan. We are\r\ndetermined to continue, because we remember the\r\nvalue of the assistance extended when we needed it\r\nmost, and we know it is our responsibility to help\r\nothers in our turn.\r\nFor us  who for decades survived by hope of\r\nfreedom alone  this summit is also about hope. We\r\nmust make sure that the individual, as the main\r\nelement of the world community of nations, is placed\r\nat the centre of the United Nations as a whole.\r\nMainstreaming human rights into all areas of activities\r\nof the United Nations and promoting democracy and\r\nthe rule of law, as well as the responsibility to protect,\r\nmust be part and parcel of the United Nations of the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nWe therefore call on all nations to take\r\nexpeditious decisions enabling the creation of an\r\neffective Human Rights Council with a robust\r\nmandate, a Council that would be fully operational\r\nwithout delay.\r\nTerrorism threatens our very right to life, our\r\nright to live free from fear and open to the diversity of\r\nthe cultures and civilizations around us. The relevance\r\nof the United Nations as the truly universal and\r\ninclusive Organization will be measured by how we are\r\nprotected from the horror of terror, including the threat\r\nof weapons of mass destruction falling into the hands\r\nof terrorists.\r\nWe join other nations in the full condemnation of\r\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations,\r\ncommitted by whomever, wherever and for whatever\r\npurpose, and we fully support the earliest possible\r\nadoption of a comprehensive counter-terrorism strategy\r\nas well as a relevant convention on international\r\nterrorism.\r\nWe, the United Nations, must also offer hope to\r\npeople in countries emerging from conflict by ensuring\r\nthat the vicious cycle of destruction, lawlessness,\r\nimpunity and poverty is broken with the help of the\r\ninternational community. We welcome the creation of\r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission as a significant building\r\nblock of a renewed United Nations and urge that it be\r\nmade operational before the end of this year.\r\nThe responsibility to protect is also about hope.\r\nThe responsibility to protect is our joint commitment to\r\nan individuals right to life, and a promise that he or\r\nshe will not fall victim to genocide, war crimes or\r\nethnic cleansing while the rest of the world goes about\r\nits business as usual.\r\nWe, the leaders of the world gathered here this\r\nweek, share a unique momentum and the responsibility\r\nfor reform. As heads of State or Government, we must\r\nsend a loud and clear message, regarding the scope and\r\ndirection of change. We must pledge to continue to\r\nimplement vigorously a comprehensive package of\r\nreforms that will bring out the very best of the United\r\nNations  our United Nations  as a unique vehicle\r\nfor concerted multilateral action. Because, as the\r\nSecretary-General noted yesterday and as we all\r\nwitness increasingly, in this interrelated world of the\r\ntwenty-first century we all stand or fall together.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Janez\r\nDrnovek, President of the Republic of Slovenia.\r\nPresident Drnovek (spoke in Slovenian;\r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): This Meeting\r\nis an opportunity to take a close and critical look at the\r\nreality of humanitys situation and the effectiveness of\r\nthe United Nations. I think it would make little sense\r\nfor this High-level Plenary Meeting to be just one more\r\nof the many meetings where we politely exchange\r\nfriendly words, adopt a general declaration and go our\r\nvarious ways, leaving nothing substantially changed.\r\nThe findings of experts in examining the\r\nachievement of some of the Millennium Development\r\nGoals are frightening. World poverty is not decreasing,\r\nbut is in fact growing. More than a billion people live\r\n8\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\nbelow the threshold of absolute poverty and in critical\r\nmedical conditions. The reasons for this state of affairs\r\nare known.\r\nAccess for developing countries to rich and\r\ndeveloped markets and their access to financial\r\ninstitutions, new technologies and medicines is still\r\nbeing thwarted or at least significantly limited. Global\r\ntrade relations are also unfair. The pressures of\r\nagricultural policy, especially from the developed\r\ncountries, are such that they are literally destroying\r\nagriculture in the developing countries. As the\r\ncalculations at Oxfam indicate, an improvement in\r\naccess to world markets of a mere one per cent each for\r\nAfrica, East Asia, South Asia and Latin America could\r\nlift as many as 128 million people out of poverty.\r\nFinancial relations are extremely unfair.\r\nDeveloping countries today are paying enormous\r\namounts just to service the interest on debt. Much of\r\nthis debt has never been used for the benefit of people\r\nand has, therefore, been defined as illegitimate or\r\nodious debt. Lenders knew very well that they were\r\nmaking loans to corrupt regimes and that these would\r\nnot help people in hardship. Repaying such debt has\r\nrendered poor countries even poorer. In recent months\r\nand years, some significant efforts have been made.\r\nThe recent writing-off of the multilateral debt of the\r\npoorest countries of the world is welcome, but not\r\nenough. For numerous countries that are struggling to\r\nattain the Millennium Development Goals, their debt\r\nshould be written off without any further conditions.\r\nOfficial development assistance is growing\r\nextremely slowly. While we welcome the recent\r\nagreement on increasing aid by 2010, we must be\r\naware that this commitment was first made in 1970 and\r\nhas not been honoured right up to the present day. In\r\nrecent years, several innovative proposals have been\r\nmade to increase development funds, yet none of them\r\nhas broken through the inertia of the financial\r\ninstitutions. And it is completely clear that we cannot\r\nexpect any positive breakthroughs using the existing\r\nfinancial instruments.\r\nPoverty is not the only danger that burdens the\r\nworld. Our very existence on the planet is under threat.\r\nI wish to draw attention to climate change and\r\natmospheric warming. There appears to be an emerging\r\nconsensus among scientists that each year we are\r\nwitnessing increasing numbers of catastrophic events\r\nlinked to global warming: hurricanes, floods and\r\ndroughts. It is in this area that it is perhaps most\r\nillustrative and clear to everyone on this earth that we\r\nare in fact all connected and interdependent. Under the\r\naegis of the United Nations, we must work together to\r\nfind more effective, more determined solutions that\r\nraise the general awareness of people, especially\r\npoliticians.\r\nOne could continue to list staggering facts and\r\nfigures ad infinitum. The consequences of a world\r\nwithout balance are becoming increasingly\r\ncatastrophic. Global imbalances are growing and are\r\nnow at their highest level in the history of humanity. It\r\nis, therefore, an illusion to expect that the world will be\r\nbalanced, that there will be no wars, no terrorism,\r\ncorruption and crime of the most brutal dimensions, if\r\nsuch trends continue.\r\nNo kind of security measure and no kind of\r\nprotection against terrorism and global threats can give\r\nanyone complete security. We will all be defeated. So\r\nburying our heads in the sand is a reflection of our lack\r\nof responsibility to humanity today and to all future\r\ngenerations.\r\nThe developed world in particular should assume\r\na decisive role in that regard: the biggest and most\r\nadvanced countries and all those international\r\norganizations that, together with the United Nations,\r\nhave a decisive impact on the evolving situation of\r\nhumankind and bear the responsibility for its\r\ndevelopment. An extraordinary responsibility is\r\nincumbent upon all of us participating at this High-\r\nlevel Meeting.\r\nIf we wish to pass on a more just, sustainable and\r\nhumane world to the next generation, we must be\r\nprepared to significantly alter our habits and beliefs.\r\nWe have to be aware of the suffering of a large part of\r\nhumankind and strengthen our sensitivity towards\r\npeople around the world who live in distress.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Armando Emílio Guebuza, President of the\r\nRepublic of Mozambique.\r\nPresident Guebuza: On behalf of the people and\r\nthe Government of the Republic of Mozambique, and\r\non my own account, I would like to join previous\r\nspeakers in congratulating the delegation of Gabon and\r\nSweden on their election to chair this important and\r\nhistoric High-level Plenary Meeting of the General\r\n9\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\nAssembly. We are confident that, under their\r\nenlightened and skilful guidance, our deliberations will\r\nbe crowned with success.\r\nAllow me to take this opportunity to reiterate the\r\nsolidarity and condolences of the people and the\r\nGovernment of Mozambique to the people of the\r\nUnited States and to its Government in connection with\r\nthe human losses and destruction caused by Hurricane\r\nKatrina.\r\nWe wish to commend the Secretary-General for\r\nhis leadership and tireless efforts aimed at reforming\r\nthe United Nations with a view to making it more\r\neffective in addressing present and future challenges.\r\nIn that context, we congratulate him on his report\r\nentitled In larger freedom: towards development,\r\nsecurity and human rights for all (A/59/2005), which\r\nconstitutes the basis for our discussions.\r\nThe celebration of the sixtieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations offers us an opportunity to evoke the\r\nsuccesses of our international institution over the past\r\nsix decades. Indeed, since its inception, the United\r\nNations has been able to fulfil the basic principles\r\nenshrined in its Charter.\r\nThe adoption five years ago of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration and the Millennium Development Goals\r\n(MDGs), represented a firm commitment by the\r\ninternational community to halving extreme poverty,\r\naccelerating human development and facilitating the\r\ngradual and effective integration of the developing\r\nworld into the global economy.\r\nDespite the progress made so far, we note with\r\ngreat concern that abject poverty remains a feature of\r\nthe majority of developing countries. In Africa, for\r\ninstance, available data indicate that most countries in\r\nour continent are far from achieving all or most of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. In that regard, we call\r\nupon the international community to increase the flows\r\nof official development assistance (ODA) and foreign\r\ndirect investment. We also call for the establishment of\r\na fairer world trade system and for total debt\r\ncancellation for poor countries.\r\nAt the same time, however, we are encouraged by\r\nrecent positive developments. The decision by\r\ndeveloped countries to achieve the target of 0.7 per\r\ncent of gross national produce (GNP) for official\r\ndevelopment assistance by no later than 2015 is\r\npraiseworthy. Equally commendable is the decision\r\ntaken by Group of Eight countries leading to a\r\ndoubling of development aid to Africa and debt relief\r\nfor highly indebted poor countries, including my own\r\ncountry, Mozambique.\r\nAs a result of successful elections in\r\nMozambique, we have been bestowed with the\r\nresponsibility of succeeding Mr. Joaquim Alberto\r\nChissano, a statesman with whom most of those\r\npresent in this Hall interacted a great deal. As we take\r\nthe floor for the first time in the General Assembly, we\r\nwould like to express our hope that Mozambique will\r\ncontinue to be able to count on the Assemblys support\r\nand encouragement for the successful implementation\r\nof our five-year programme and subsequent\r\nprogrammes, all of which focus on poverty reduction.\r\nWe also welcome private investment, given its role in\r\nrealizing our strategic objectives against poverty.\r\nIt is our hope that the momentum created by this\r\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting and the proposals of the\r\nSecretary-General will give a new impetus to our\r\ncommitment to make the world a better place for all\r\nhumankind. It is imperative that we all translate our\r\npolitical commitment into concrete action.\r\nWe would like to conclude our remarks by\r\nreiterating the pledge of the Government of the\r\nRepublic of Mozambique to continue its efforts\r\ntowards the attainment of internationally agreed\r\ndevelopment goals, including those contained in the\r\nMillennium Declaration.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Heinz\r\nFischer, Federal President of the Republic of Austria.\r\nPresident Fischer: In three months, in December\r\nof this year, Austria will celebrate 50 years of\r\nmembership in the United Nations. Austria joined the\r\nUnited Nations in 1955, during a crucial period of its\r\nhistory and right after regaining its independence.\r\nDuring its 60 years of existence, the United\r\nNations has been lauded as well as criticized.\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan has constantly worked\r\ntowards improving our Organization so that it can\r\nbetter deal with the challenges of the twenty-first\r\ncentury. With his report entitled In larger freedom\r\n(A/59/2005), he initiated another ambitious reform\r\nprocess. The large number of heads of State or\r\nGovernment gathered here proves the importance of\r\nthat common effort. We truly and strongly believe that\r\n10\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\nthe United Nations will emerge from this summit with\r\nan enhanced capacity to deal with todays threats and\r\ntomorrows challenges.\r\nThe draft summit outcome (A/60/L.1) contains\r\nvaluable commitments in the field of development, as\r\nwell as new common understandings on peace and\r\nsecurity, human rights, the rule of law and the\r\nstrengthening of the Secretariat. As the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has pointed out, we are, on the other hand,\r\nconcerned about the lack of agreement in the areas of\r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation. However, the\r\npackage as a whole is a good start. I would like to take\r\nthis opportunity to thank the President of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-ninth session, Mr. Jean Ping, and\r\nhis able facilitators  all those who have done this\r\ndifficult work  for their great efforts.\r\nAllow me to highlight some issues of particular\r\nimportance for my country, Austria.\r\nOne of the most important results of this summit\r\nwill be the decision to establish a Peacebuilding\r\nCommission. It will provide valuable support for\r\ncountries emerging from conflict situations and ensure\r\na coordinated and coherent response from the\r\ninternational community. The European Union, as a\r\nmajor global donor with a strong record for worldwide\r\nand sustained efforts in the field of peacebuilding, must\r\nbe able to contribute to the work of the Commission.\r\nAustria welcomes the agreement on a Human\r\nRights Council. The new body should improve the\r\nefficiency and credibility of the United Nations in the\r\nfield of human rights. We must now find the proper\r\nstructures and procedures for the Council. Austria also\r\ndeems it important that the Council be a standing body,\r\nwhich must have the ability to address serious human\r\nrights violations and ensure opportunities for the\r\nparticipation of observer States and civil society.\r\nIn my opinion, adherence to the rule of law is a\r\nfundamental prerequisite for peaceful international\r\nrelations as well as for democracy and stability within\r\nStates. It is my conviction that it was a long and\r\ndifficult but rewarding process for many of our\r\nsocieties to ensure that the principle of the rule of law\r\nhas prevailed in the framework of democratic national\r\nStates. It will now be a task for coming years and\r\ndecades to fully implement that principle in the field of\r\ninternational relations as well.\r\nThis summit is a test of our collective political\r\nwill to give sufficient impetus to the implementation of\r\nthe Millennium Declaration. The Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals will only be attained, first, if the\r\nquantity and quality of official development assistance\r\nis increased; secondly, if the development dimension of\r\nthe Doha round is fully secured; and thirdly, if conflict\r\nprevention and post-conflict reconstruction and\r\nreconciliation processes are given more prominence in\r\ninternational cooperation. Violence is deadly for\r\ndevelopment.\r\nOver the past 50 years the United Nations and the\r\nprinciples of the Charter have been at the heart of\r\nAustrias foreign policy. A modern, efficient and\r\nstrengthened United Nations is of particular\r\nimportance for Austria. We feel privileged to host one\r\nof the United Nations headquarters in Vienna and\r\nappreciate the valuable and important work and\r\nactivities of its institutions.\r\nWe are committed to continue our active and\r\nconstructive contribution in the various forums and\r\nbodies of the United Nations. In that context, we would\r\nvery much appreciate it if Member States put their\r\nconfidence in Austria and supported Austrias\r\ncandidature for a non-permanent seat on the Security\r\nCouncil for the term 2009-2010.\r\nIn conclusion I would like to reiterate my\r\nconviction that this reform summit will strengthen the\r\nUnited Nations and make it fit to address the threats to\r\npeace and security facing todays world. The\r\ncommitments contained in our draft outcome document\r\nwill still need to be implemented and deadlines will\r\nhave to be met. Let us make good use of the political\r\nmomentum created by the draft outcome document in\r\norder to ensure the lasting success of this world summit\r\nand a world of peace.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Ivo\r\nMiro Jović, President of the presidency of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina.\r\nPresident Jović (spoke in Bosnian; English text\r\nprovided by the delegation): Allow me at the outset to\r\nexpress my gratitude and appreciation to Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan; to the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges\r\nand Change, which provided us with a most\r\ncomprehensive document (A/59/565) as the backbone\r\nof our discussions and deliberations; and to the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth\r\n11\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\nsession, Mr. Jean Ping, who made an outstanding effort\r\nin coordinating the open-ended working group and\r\npreparing the draft outcome document for the\r\nconsideration of this impressive gathering of world\r\nleaders.\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to\r\nconvey the resolve of all the peoples of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina to support the United Nations, as well as\r\ntheir preparedness to assume their fair share of\r\nobligations and tasks in order to reinvigorate the\r\nOrganization at this pivotal moment in its existence.\r\nBack in the early 1960s, at the peak of the cold\r\nwar, during the Cuban crisis, there was a discussion\r\naround a dinner table among diplomats accredited to\r\nthe United Nations here in New York. As the\r\ndiscussion became heated over how soon the world\r\nwould face imminent destruction and disappearance,\r\nand while the diplomats agreed that we were doomed\r\nto perish but continued arguing about who was to be\r\nblamed, a quiet gentleman at the far end of the table\r\nraised his hand to get the attention of his peers.\r\nSincerely, my dear friends, he said, I fail to\r\nunderstand what the real cause of your argument is,\r\nwhen all this will be recorded in history as a mere 50\r\nyears of turmoil.\r\nWell, fortunately, he was right, and those 50 years\r\nof turmoil are behind us, as is the cold war, the silly\r\narms race, the imminent threat of nuclear disaster and\r\nthe divided world as we used to know it. Today, we\r\nface a new 50 years of challenges and threats, and we\r\nare determined to do something about it. In the\r\nmeantime, our Organization has grown three times in\r\nsize, colonialism has been relegated to the history\r\nbooks, bricks from Berlin wall have become collectors\r\nitems and Brazil still rules the soccer field. The world\r\nhas become a better place.\r\nOr has it? The rich are getting richer and the poor\r\nare still poor. We had the same number of inter-State\r\nwars in 1990s as we had in the 1950s. Instead of\r\ntuberculosis we now have retroviruses and avian flu.\r\nSome women still cannot vote, and many children still\r\ndo not go to school. I wish that the list of problems we\r\nare dealing with were exhausted at the number of\r\nparagraphs of the draft outcome document. But it is\r\nnot.\r\nI come from a small, but brave and proud\r\ncountry. It is among those that comprise almost half of\r\nthe membership of the United Nations, those with\r\nfewer than 5 million citizens. And we are one of those\r\nwith under $1,500 of gross national product per capita.\r\nWe are referred to as a post-conflict society. We are\r\nstill tending the wounds of a tragic war. We are still\r\nchasing war criminals. And we are still desperately\r\nseeking mutual forgiveness and reconciliation.\r\nThis year we will commemorate the tenth\r\nanniversary of the Dayton Peace Agreement, the\r\naccord that indeed ended the war but failed to provide\r\nthe foundations for sustainable peace. The solid\r\nfoundation of lasting peace provides for the equality of\r\nall nations and citizens, but that is not what we have\r\nnow: one State, two entities and three nations is the\r\nnon-functional structure bequeathed to us by Dayton.\r\nWe therefore decided, through negotiations and\r\nconsensus among all three constituent nations, to\r\nchange it for the better and to adjust it to our needs and\r\nwants.\r\nDespite the complexity of our political and\r\nconstitutional structure, we are committed to improve\r\nby consensus the Constitution that was given to us as a\r\ngift, and to take the ownership of the State from the\r\nOffice of the High Representative.\r\nWe are committed to ensuring that our citizens\r\nenjoy the highest standards of human and civil rights,\r\nas set out in the European Convention on Human\r\nRights, including their rights as Croats, Bosniacs and\r\nSerbs, members of three constituent nations, to be\r\ninformed and educated in their native languages.\r\nWe thus intend to meet our international\r\nobligations as set out in the Millennium Development\r\nGoals: stability, prosperity, good governance,\r\ntransparency and the fulfilment of our international\r\nlegal obligations. We rightly believe that we belong to\r\nthe European family of nations, and even though we\r\nare sometimes neglected, we believe that we can\r\nbecome a factor of stability in the region of the\r\nBalkans.\r\nI am proud to inform the Assembly that our\r\nForeign Minister has just signed the United Nations\r\nConvention Against Corruption. Prior to coming here,\r\nthe State presidency, of which I am President, gave the\r\nauthority to our Permanent Representative here in New\r\nYork to sign the International Convention for the\r\nSuppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, and the\r\nHouse of Representatives of the State Parliament\r\napproved the ratification of the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We pay our dues to the\r\n12\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\nUnited Nations and affiliated organizations regularly\r\nand in a timely manner, and we have peacekeepers in\r\nHaiti, Ethiopia/Eritrea, Cyprus, Liberia and the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nAs far as United Nations reform is concerned,\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina has been closely following all\r\nthe recent developments. We have regular consultations\r\nwith our neighbours, countries from the region and\r\nmembers of the Eastern European regional group. We\r\nare committed to supporting any and all reform\r\nsolutions that stand a chance of receiving consensus\r\nfrom the majority of Member countries, including the\r\nPeacebuilding Commission, the Human Rights Council\r\nand the expansion of the Security Council. Respecting\r\nunreservedly the United Nations Charter, we support\r\nthe principle that any decision by the United Nations or\r\nits bodies that affects or in any way limits the\r\nsovereignty of a Member State needs to be made\r\nunanimously or by consensus.\r\nWe share the view of our fellow developing\r\ncountries that we need better representation in the\r\nSecurity Council. But it would be a pity  and the\r\nwhole reform process would lose its momentum  if\r\nwe exhausted ourselves deliberating the pros and cons\r\nof model A and model B. The bottom line is that we\r\nneed a stronger, more efficient, better financed, more\r\nagile, more alert Organization to address the threats to\r\ninternational peace and security in the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nWe stand ready to take on our shoulders a fair\r\nshare of that load.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Georgi\r\nParvanov, President of the Republic of Bulgaria.\r\nPresident Parvanov (spoke in Bulgarian;\r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): The collective\r\nvoice of reason calling for peace and cooperation has,\r\nas a rule, prevailed in world politics in the wake of a\r\ndreadful cycle of destructive wars and social\r\ncataclysm. Today, 60 years after the end of the most\r\ndevastating armed conflict in history, humanity has a\r\nchance to break that deplorable cycle. I am confident\r\nthat at this crucial moment we, the leaders and the\r\npeoples of the United Nations, will be able to mobilize\r\nour political will and resources and prove that the\r\nlessons of the past have taught us to meet the\r\nchallenges of the present.\r\nI am here today to add the voice of the Republic\r\nof Bulgaria to the shared affirmation of political will\r\nexpressed by participants at this High-level Meeting\r\naimed at speeding up implementation of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals and strengthening the\r\nefficiency of our Organization. It is clear that our\r\naspiration to live in an environment of collective\r\nsecurity will be doomed to failure if we do not make\r\nradical progress in overcoming hunger and poverty,\r\nhalting the spread of HIV/AIDS and other mass\r\nepidemics, protecting the environment and expanding\r\naccess to modern education.\r\nWe cannot be content with what has been\r\nachieved in the past five years. If the current pace of\r\naction is maintained, we cannot expect to meet the\r\ninternationally agreed development goals before the\r\nend of the century. That is why we must agree to\r\nredouble our efforts today and to stand united in our\r\nmission to save humankind.\r\nMy country welcomes the draft outcome\r\ndocument (A/60/L.1)  the product of a very intensive\r\ndiplomatic effort over the past several months. We\r\nregard it as a solid basis for implementing further the\r\npackage of commitments made, then reaffirmed and\r\ndeveloped at this rostrum.\r\nThe meaning of security today differs\r\nsubstantially from what the founding fathers of the\r\nUnited Nations perceived it to mean 60 years ago \r\nand even from what we meant by it five years ago.\r\nThreats have become much more diverse, subtle and\r\nunpredictable. We need responsible thinking, expressed\r\nin a culture of global solidarity, cooperation and\r\nmutual assistance. Fighting the destructive force of\r\nterrorism, which totally rejects all principles of\r\nhumaneness and democracy, continues to be a task of\r\nprimary significance. The new challenges dictate our\r\npriorities: the United Nations agenda emphasises the\r\nnon-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, arms\r\ncontrol, the early prevention of crises and conflicts and\r\nthe expansion of the capacity of the United Nations to\r\nconduct a wide range of peace operations. In this\r\ncontext, the establishment of a Peacebuilding\r\nCommission has become an urgent task.\r\nA safer world of freedom, democracy and\r\nprosperity cannot be built if we do not effectively\r\ncombat international terrorism. However, we must\r\nmeet that challenge without infringing upon the\r\nprinciples of democracy, pluralism and human rights.\r\n13\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\nFor us, the concept of human rights goes beyond the\r\nwell-known standards set out in United Nations\r\ninstruments and further developed in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration. This is where we see a role for the new\r\nHuman Rights Council. We endorse the concept of the\r\nresponsibility to protect. We also call for a greater\r\nrole and more resources for the Office of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights, and\r\nsupport the United Nations Democracy Fund.\r\nLast but not least, in order for the United Nations\r\nto be able to cope with a highly challenging\r\nenvironment, no effort should be spared in carrying out\r\nthe projected institutional reform or in radically\r\nimproving transparency, accountability and the overall\r\nefficiency of the Organization. Learning from our\r\nfailures, we support the policy of zero tolerance for\r\nabuse, corruption or mismanagement. Bulgaria is in\r\nfavour of well-balanced, constructive solutions aimed\r\nat ensuring the better functioning of the Security\r\nCouncil and the Economic and Social Council and the\r\nstreamlining of the work of the General Assembly and\r\nits committees.\r\nThis Meeting clearly demonstrates the urgency of\r\nreaching a new, action-oriented consensus among\r\nMember States on issues of key importance to our\r\nworld. Identifying adequate responses to urgent issues,\r\ncompleting the necessary reform of the activities and\r\nstructures of the United Nations, enabling the\r\nOrganization to maintain its role as a universal\r\ninternational organization: all these are crucial for the\r\nfuture of humankind.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Majesty Sultan Haji\r\nHassanal Bolkiah Muizzaddin Waddaulah, Sultan and\r\nYang Di Pertuan of Brunei Darussalam.\r\nSultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah Muizzaddin\r\nWaddaulah: My warmest greetings go to all my\r\nfriends and colleagues. The opportunity to meet like\r\nthis is a rare privilege, and I very much appreciate the\r\nchance to hear their views and to share their\r\nexperiences. So I would like to thank the\r\nCo-Chairpersons and the Secretary-General very much\r\nindeed for bringing us all together again. Perhaps\r\nabove all, at this time, it gives me the opportunity to\r\nexpress my peoples deepest sympathy and\r\ncondolences to our American hosts, whose people have\r\nsuffered so much from the effects of Hurricane Katrina.\r\nIn assessing our progress in Brunei Darussalam\r\ntowards the Millennium Goals, one thing has become\r\nclearly apparent: the Goals have taken on an even\r\ndeeper significance than perhaps we initially realized.\r\nAt first, they seemed to represent a kind of\r\ndevelopment checklist. Some set national aims such as\r\nhalving extreme poverty, establishing universal\r\nprimary education, reducing infant and maternal\r\nmortality, reversing the spread of HIV/AIDS and\r\nendemic diseases and setting economic targets. Others\r\nwere aimed at universal objectives, promoting gender\r\nequality, sustaining the environment and developing\r\ninternational partnerships.\r\nLooking at them in that way, our people at first\r\ntended to see them as targets that applied mainly to\r\nother countries in the world beyond our shores. In fact,\r\nthey felt that they had already reached most of the\r\nspecific social, economic and cultural goals. So the\r\ninstinctive feeling that the Millennium Goals applied\r\nlargely to other countries was perhaps quite\r\nunderstandable.\r\nThat was five years ago. Since then, there have\r\nbeen profound changes. They have led to a far deeper\r\nunderstanding among our people. This development\r\nhas been prompted by real events. The outside world\r\nhas imposed itself on our region in dramatic fashion.\r\nOur people have witnessed terrorist attacks, natural\r\ndisasters, climate change, strange new viruses, often\r\nbewildering new technology and rapid and sometimes\r\nequally bewildering economic change.\r\nAll this has shown us that in todays reality the\r\nexpression the world beyond our shores does not\r\nhave a great deal of meaning. There may be other\r\ncountries beyond our shores, but there is, in fact, just\r\none world, which we all share.\r\nThe new realizations which have resulted can be\r\nput quite simply: the future will involve more and more\r\ncontact with the rest of the world; we will be more and\r\nmore affected by what happens outside our borders;\r\nand we will be more and more dependent on that\r\noutside world. That means one thing: future peace,\r\nprosperity and confidence depend not just on\r\nourselves, but on the success of all nations. Hence, we\r\nare all partners, no matter what our backgrounds,\r\ncultures, faiths and histories.\r\nIn other words, our people have begun to realize\r\nthat confidence in the future for one community can be\r\nachieved only if all communities feel similar\r\n14\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\nconfidence. For us, this understanding has been the\r\nmost important result of the establishment of the\r\nMillennium Goals. We have realized that unless the\r\nGoals are reached by everyone, there will be no lasting\r\nsecurity. Each failed objective will be a root cause of\r\ninsecurity.\r\nThat places the Millennium Goals in an extra\r\ndimension. It reveals them not only as crucial for each\r\nindividual nation and its people, but as central to the\r\nprofound political, economic, cultural and social\r\nchallenges we must all meet together. Achieving the\r\ngoals will help to consign to history the twentieth-\r\ncentury concept of first-, second- and third-world\r\ncountries. It will help to develop a single twenty-first-\r\ncentury world in which we will all have shared\r\nresponsibilities and shared hopes. In this way, our\r\npeople see the Millennium Goals as a historic United\r\nNations task, and we will continue to work with our\r\nfellow Members to do whatever we can to ensure that\r\nwe all reach the targets that we have accepted.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Majesty King Mswati\r\nIII, Head of State of the Kingdom of Swaziland.\r\nKing Mswati III: I bring with me greetings from\r\nmy country on this auspicious occasion, the sixtieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations. We also express our\r\nsympathies to the people of the United States of\r\nAmerica for the tragic aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.\r\nI am happy to address a high-level plenary\r\nmeeting of the General Assembly once again, having\r\ndone so not too long ago when we, the heads of State\r\nor Government, gathered here to adopt the historic\r\nMillennium Declaration in 2000. The Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), adopted as a road map\r\nfor achieving that vision, compelled the international\r\ncommunity to commit to working collectively to\r\nimprove the standard of living of our peoples in a safer\r\nand more secure world.\r\nIt is good that today we are meeting to review\r\nprogress in our implementation of the MDGs and to\r\ncollectively reaffirm our commitment to the millions of\r\npeople who deserve a better and more decent standard\r\nof living in this millennium. The success of that action\r\nrequires the political will and the firm commitment of\r\nboth the developing world and our development\r\npartners.\r\nI am pleased to report that we of the Kingdom of\r\nSwaziland went back home and immediately acted on\r\nthe United Nations Millennium Declaration by setting\r\nour priorities for fighting poverty through the creation\r\nof jobs in manufacturing, construction, tourism,\r\nagribusiness and other areas.\r\nIn the past five years we have recorded some\r\nfavourable results in our fight to reduce poverty. Job\r\nand wealth creation has always been at the centre of\r\nour plans and strategies.\r\nBefore coming to this meeting, we conducted a\r\nreview of our millennium development programme,\r\nwhich has clearly shown us that we are still, however, a\r\nlong way from overcoming the challenges of poverty\r\nreduction and human development. Our gains continue\r\nto be eroded by formidable challenges, including\r\nnatural disasters such as droughts, floods, the\r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic, and the reduction of preferential\r\nmarkets for our goods. One major outcome of all those\r\nfactors has been increasing unemployment, which\r\ncontinues to pose a serious threat to our economic\r\nprogress.\r\nWe have therefore embarked on a new economic\r\napproach which emphasizes that while we continue to\r\nattract and welcome foreign direct investment, we must\r\nat the same time create our own vibrant business\r\ncommunity that will spearhead sustainable economic\r\ngrowth. To that end we have already crafted and are\r\nimplementing a national small and medium enterprise\r\npolicy, which emphasizes capacity-building through\r\nthe training and funding of our entrepreneurs.\r\nIt was in line with that new economic approach\r\nthat we recently held a national job creation summit at\r\nwhich we raised more that 1.6 billion emalangeni,\r\nwhich should enable us to kick-start our economy. That\r\npublic-private sector partnership initiative aims at\r\ncreating more than 50,000 new jobs.\r\nHaving played our part in mobilizing domestic\r\nresources as a developing economy, it is proper for us\r\nto request our international development partners to\r\nmeet us halfway through grants and other official\r\ndevelopment support. It would not be fair to neglect\r\nour case just because we have been classified in a\r\nhigher category. It should be recognized and\r\nappreciated that our country is where it is because of\r\nour continued efforts. We deserve to be supported in\r\norder to keep moving forward. We also hope that the\r\ninternational financial institutions will continue\r\n15\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\nsupporting us with more concessional loans to enable\r\nus to meet our targets for achieving the MDGs.\r\nThe main key to our success is the availability of\r\nexternal and, in particular, preferential markets, which\r\nare vital for the growth of our economy. By continuing\r\nto provide us with preferential markets our\r\ndevelopment partners would enable us to reach a level\r\nthat might allow us one day to compete on an equal\r\nfooting. As an agricultural economy we are determined\r\nand have planned to continue diversifying our products\r\nwith more emphasis on adding value through\r\nprocessing and quality control.\r\nOn another note, I am very pleased to report that,\r\nin pursuit of larger freedom, the Swazi nation has\r\ncrafted a new Constitution that embodies fundamental\r\nhuman rights. That Constitution is a result of extensive\r\nconsultation at the grass-roots level. We do not claim\r\nto have made a perfect document. But like all nations\r\nof the world, we shall continue to improve our\r\nConstitution through amendments as the need arises. I\r\nshould like to thank all those who helped us during the\r\ndrafting process, especially the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme and the Commonwealth.\r\nLet me now briefly comment on the great work\r\nwe have embarked on to reform the United Nations in\r\norder to make it stronger, more representative and\r\neffective in its noble mandate of managing global\r\naffairs.\r\nAs you are aware, the African Union articulated a\r\nCommon Position on this matter following a lengthy\r\ndebate on the report of the Secretary-Generals High-\r\nlevel Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change\r\n(A/59/565). Our Position states that\r\nAfricas goal is to be fully represented in\r\nall the decision-making organs of the [United\r\nNations], particularly in the Security Council,\r\nwhich is the principal decision-making organ of\r\nthe [United Nations] in matters relating to\r\ninternational peace and security. (African Union\r\ndocument Ext/EX.CL.2 (VII))\r\nFor our representation to be effective, Africa\r\nmust be allowed to play its role both in the permanent\r\nand non-permanent categories.\r\nWe believe that a more effective United Nations\r\nsystem should be able to reduce tensions and conflicts\r\nwithin and between States, so that peace as a condition\r\nfor development and economic growth will prevail. We\r\nshare the Secretary-Generals desire to have a decision\r\ntaken on this matter at this summit, as inaction will\r\ncontinue to delay the development agenda, thereby\r\nprolonging the suffering of many of our poverty-\r\nstricken peoples.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Azali\r\nAssoumani, President of the Union of the Comoros.\r\nPresident Assoumani (spoke in French): On\r\nbehalf of the delegation of the Union of the Comoros\r\nlet me at the outset express once again to the entire\r\npeople of the United States of America the sympathy\r\nand support of the Government and the people of the\r\nComoros in the wake of the terrible blow inflicted by\r\nthe passage of Hurricane Katrina, which severely\r\nshook this country and caused the loss of thousands of\r\nhuman lives and unprecedented physical damage.\r\nNext, I should like to congratulate the Co-\r\nChairpersons on their wisdom and clear thinking in\r\nguiding the work of this session, which is a key\r\nmoment for the future of the world and humanity.\r\nMy country welcomes the decision taken by the\r\nGeneral Assembly in resolution 58/291 of 6 May 2004\r\nto hold this summit meeting, and I should like to\r\ncongratulate the outgoing President, Jean Ping, for the\r\neffective work achieved.\r\nFive years ago, the highest leaders of the member\r\ncountries of the community of nations made a firm\r\ncommitment to pool their efforts to wage a war \r\norganized and relentless  against poverty and all the\r\nensuing scourges, which pose a serious threat to\r\ninternational peace and security and are a major\r\nobstacle to the process of development in our\r\ncountries.\r\nThis summit will allow us to take full stock of the\r\nprogress made, but also to correct our errors, to adjust\r\nour methods and to target our action better, and in\r\nparticular to reiterate our collective commitment to the\r\nMillennium Development Goals up to 2015.\r\nMy country welcomes all of the work undertaken\r\nin preparation for this decisive landmark session, and\r\npays a well-deserved tribute to Kofi Annan, Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations, for his report, entitled\r\nIn larger freedom (A/59/2005), where he rightly\r\nunderscores the need to promote a world of dignity,\r\nfree from fear and want.\r\n16\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\nThe Union of the Comoros is heartened by the\r\nproposals made in the draft outcome document of the\r\nsummit (A/60/L.1).\r\nAs such, we subscribe to the draft outcome,\r\nbecause its contents can truly give rise to the\r\ninternational momentum that is necessary to achieve\r\nthe MDGs. My country also supports the draft\r\ncomprehensive convention against terrorism and\r\nstrongly supports the proposals made with respect to\r\nestablishing a peacebuilding mechanism aimed at\r\nassisting countries emerging from crisis. Similarly, we\r\nwelcome the proposal to establish a fund to promote\r\ndemocracy worldwide.\r\nWe encourage the efforts undertaken worldwide\r\nto promote peace and stability. Specifically, we\r\nencourage initiatives undertaken recently in the Middle\r\nEast. The establishment of a viable Palestinian State is\r\nthe only means of creating the necessary conditions for\r\nharmonious coexistence between the Palestinian and\r\nIsraeli peoples.\r\nWe believe that the international community,\r\ngiven the worlds current level of development, has the\r\nmeans to promote the implementation of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. We remain convinced\r\nthat, given this level of development and with a\r\nconsistent commitment on the part of the developed\r\ncountries, key victories can be achieved in the areas of\r\nimproving maternal health; fighting hunger, poverty,\r\nterrorism, HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases;\r\npromoting a sustainable environment; and in terms of\r\nour shared concern to establish a global partnership for\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThat is why the Union of the Comoros takes this\r\nopportunity to pay tribute to the G-8 countries, which\r\nshowed their solidarity vis-à-vis certain developing\r\ncountries by granting them total debt relief and for the\r\nreadiness they expressed to extend that generous and\r\nwelcome measure to other developing countries.\r\nMy country also welcomes the will expressed\r\nduring the most recent summit of the Group of 77 and\r\nChina, held at Doha, Qatar, to establish a global\r\ndevelopment fund. We pay tribute also to the readiness\r\nexpressed by Qatar to contribute $20 million to that\r\nfund.\r\nMy country supports the efforts made by Jacques\r\nChirac, President of the French Republic, and supports\r\nhis proposal for an air ticket levy to finance efforts to\r\nfight pandemics.\r\nFinally, my country deeply appreciates the\r\nproposals made at the summit by the President of the\r\nPeoples Republic of China, Mr. Hu Jintao, which are\r\nvery proactive and reflect a strong commitment to the\r\npromotion of peace, security and development.\r\nThe Union of the Comoros is working steadfastly\r\nto implement the MDGs, despite its extremely limited\r\nresources. In that context, we have just put together,\r\ntogether with the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme, our second report, for 2005, on the MDGs,\r\nfollowing on from the 2003 report. This latest report\r\nincludes, inter alia, a stocktaking of the situation and\r\nforecasts looking to 2015.\r\nTo that end, our Government has made\r\nconsiderable efforts to ensure financing of several\r\nmajor projects within the framework of the\r\nestablishment of basic development infrastructure. The\r\nportion of the State budget allocated to basic\r\ninvestment has risen from 10 to 30 per cent in the past\r\nfive years. However, during the same period, official\r\ndevelopment assistance declined by two thirds.\r\nSimilarly, action has been taken in the framework\r\nof a national plan to promote girls education, to\r\noperationalize structures aimed at addressing the\r\nempowerment of women, and to raise awareness with\r\nrespect to the implementation of the family code that\r\nhas just been enacted by the National Assembly.\r\nOnce all of the new institutions of the country\r\nwere established, in April 2004, our authorities decided\r\nto make our countrys socio-economic development a\r\npriority for the State, in order to build upon the gains\r\nresulting from national reconciliation; to make\r\nirreversible the democratic process that is under way,\r\nin the framework of the promotion of the rule of law,\r\ngood governance, human rights; and, lastly, to promote\r\nthe well-being of our people.\r\nIn that context, the authorities intend to mobilize\r\nall necessary resources in order to ensure the success\r\nof the elections, to be held in 2006 as part of the\r\ndemocratic process and which, for our country and the\r\nworld watching us, will be a key yardstick in terms of\r\nour ability to achieve democracy, the rule of law and\r\ngood governance.\r\nHence the will of the Government of the Union of\r\nthe Comoros  with the support of all of its partners,\r\n17\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\nin particular the African Union, the Republic of South\r\nAfrica and Mauritius  to mobilize the necessary\r\nefforts to ensure the success of the donor conference\r\nfor the Union of the Comoros, in accordance with the\r\nvarious agreements signed as part of the national\r\nreconciliation process.\r\nLet me also take this welcome opportunity\r\nformally to invite eminent representatives of the\r\ncountries attending this summit to take part in the\r\ndonor conference for the Union of the Comoros, to be\r\nheld under the auspices of the African Union on 8\r\nDecember next in Mauritius. I should like to thank the\r\nPrime Minister and the Government of Mauritius for\r\nhaving agreed to host that conference.\r\nOn behalf of my country, let me pay well-\r\ndeserved tribute to the international community as a\r\nwhole, which, under the auspices of the African Union,\r\nhas provided unswerving support to my country in the\r\nframework of resolving the Comorian crisis and laud it\r\nfor its tireless commitment to providing us valuable\r\nsupport throughout our development process.\r\nI reiterate our sincere gratitude to the Republic of\r\nSouth Africa, in its capacity as a coordinator country\r\nfor the Comoros, in the framework of national\r\nreconciliation, for the tireless support it has provided\r\nmy country. Let me specifically thank President Thabo\r\nMbeki of South Africa and Mr. Navinchandra\r\nRamgoolam, Prime Minister of Mauritius, for the\r\nassistance they have lent my country and for their\r\nreadiness to co-chair the donors conference for the\r\nComoros.\r\nI hope that our work will be crowned with\r\nsuccess, and I believe that our efforts will lead to a\r\nconstructive outcome for us all, for our respective\r\npeoples, and for future generations.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Hugo\r\nChávez Frías, President of the Bolivarian Republic of\r\nVenezuela.\r\nPresident Chávez Frías (spoke in Spanish): The\r\noriginal aim of this meeting has been totally distorted.\r\nThe central topic for debate that has been imposed on\r\nus is the so-called process of reform, which has\r\nrelegated to the sidelines the most urgent issue  what\r\nthe peoples of the world are calling for urgently \r\nwhich is the adoption of measures to deal with the real\r\nproblems that are hampering our countries efforts\r\ntowards development and a better life.\r\nFive years after the Millennium Summit, the\r\nharsh reality is that the great majority of the Goals that\r\nwere set, modest as they were, will not be achieved.\r\nWe had hoped to halve the number of people suffering\r\nfrom hunger  842 million  by 2015. At the current\r\nrate of progress, this will be achieved only in the year\r\n2215. I wonder who of us will be here to mark that\r\noccasion. That is, if the human race can actually\r\nsurvive the destruction threatening our environment.\r\nWe had proclaimed our aspiration to achieve by\r\n2015 universal primary education. At the current rate\r\nof progress, that goal will be achieved only after the\r\nyear 2100. So again, let us prepare to celebrate that.\r\nThis necessarily leads us to a bitter conclusion:\r\nthat the United Nations has outgrown its model. It is\r\nnot just a question of simple reform. The twenty-first\r\ncentury requires profound changes that will be possible\r\nonly if the Organization is truly recast.\r\nThis is the reality of the situation. We believe that\r\nthe changes to which Venezuela is referring involve\r\ntwo phases: the immediate phase, and that of dreams\r\nand utopia.\r\nThe first phase is marked by agreements that are\r\nweighed down by the old system. We do not shy away\r\nfrom this, and we have made specific short-term\r\nproposals within this model. However, the dream of\r\nworld peace, of a we the peoples not burdened by the\r\nshame of hunger, disease, illiteracy and extreme want,\r\nnot only needs roots; it also needs wings in order to fly.\r\nWe know that there is a terrifying neo-liberal\r\nglobalization afoot; but there is also the reality of an\r\ninterconnected world. We need to look at this, not as a\r\nproblem, but as a challenge. On the basis of our\r\nrespective national realities, we can exchange\r\nknowledge, complement one another and integrate our\r\nmarkets. But at the same time we have to understand\r\nthat there are problems that still do not have a national\r\nsolution: neither a radioactive cloud, nor world prices,\r\nnor a pandemic, nor global warming nor the hole in the\r\nozone layer are national problems.\r\nAs we move towards a new model for the United\r\nNations, one that will solidly espouse the concept of\r\nwe, the peoples, there are four urgent and essential\r\nreform proposals that we bring to this Assembly. The\r\nfirst is the expansion of the Security Council, in both\r\n18\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\nthe permanent and the non-permanent categories; this\r\nwould allow entry to new countries, developed and\r\ndeveloping, as new permanent members.\r\nThe second is the much-needed improvement of\r\nthe working methods in such a way as to increase\r\ntransparency and not to reduce it; to increase respect\r\nand not to diminish it; and to increase inclusion.\r\nThe third is the immediate removal  and\r\nVenezuela has been saying this now for six years  of\r\nthe veto in the decisions of the Security Council. This\r\nelitist remnant of the past is incompatible with the very\r\nidea of equality and of democracy.\r\nFinally, the role of the Secretary-General must be\r\nstrengthened. His political functions in the framework\r\nof preventive diplomacy should be enhanced.\r\nThe seriousness of the problems calls for deep-\r\nrooted change. Reforms on their own will not be\r\nenough to restore the we hoped for by the peoples of\r\nthe world. Beyond reforms, we in Venezuela are asking\r\nfor a recasting of the United Nations. As we in\r\nVenezuela know very well from the words of Caracass\r\nSimón Rodríguez, known also as Samuel Robinson,\r\neither we invent or we err.\r\nIn January 2005, we attended a meeting of the\r\nWorld Social Forum in Porto Alegre, Brazil. Various\r\npersonalities there called for United Nations\r\nHeadquarters to leave the United States if that country\r\ncontinued to violate international law. Today we know\r\nthat there were never weapons of mass destruction in\r\nIraq. The American people have always been very\r\nrigorous in demanding the truth from their leaders, as\r\nhave the people of the world. There were never\r\nweapons of mass destruction. However, in spite of this,\r\nand going over the head of the United Nations, Iraq\r\nwas bombed and occupied, and it continues to be\r\noccupied. That is why we propose to this Assembly\r\nthat the United Nations leave a country that does not\r\nrespect the very resolutions of this Assembly. Some\r\nproposals have suggested the alternative of a Jerusalem\r\nconverted into an international city. That proposal has\r\nthe merit of offering a response to the conflict\r\nexperienced by Palestine, but it may be too thorny and\r\ndifficult an idea to bring about.\r\nIn this respect, we have another proposal, as\r\nenshrined in the Letter from Jamaica, written by\r\nSimón Bolívar, the great liberator of the South, in\r\n1815, 190 years ago. Bolívar proposed the creation of\r\nan international city that would serve as capital for the\r\nunified entity he was putting forward. He was a\r\ndreamer, and his dreams are our present realities. We\r\nfeel it is time to think about the creation of an\r\ninternational city under the sovereignty of no State,\r\npossessing the moral force to represent the nations of\r\nthe world. But that international city must balance five\r\ncenturies of imbalance. The new headquarters of the\r\nUnited Nations will have to be in the South. In the\r\nwords of Uruguayan poet Mario Benedetti, the South\r\ntoo exists.\r\nThis city, which may already exist, or which\r\ncould be invented, could be at the crossroads of several\r\nborders or it could be in a territory symbolizing the\r\nworld. Our continent can offer the land for building the\r\nbalanced universe of which Bolívar spoke in 1825.\r\nToday we are facing an unprecedented energy\r\ncrisis, where we see the dangerous combination of an\r\nunstoppable increase in energy consumption, the\r\ninability to increase the supply of hydrocarbons and the\r\nprospect of a decline in proven reserves of fossil fuels.\r\nOil is starting to run out. By 2020, the daily demand\r\nfor oil will be 120 million barrels. Without even taking\r\ninto account future growth, this would mean that in a\r\nperiod of 20 years we will consume as much oil as\r\nhumanity has consumed to the present time. This will\r\ninevitably mean an increase in the emissions of carbon\r\ndioxide that, as we know, are increasing the Earths\r\ntemperature every day.\r\nHurricane Katrina has been a sad, painful\r\nexample of the consequences brought when man\r\nignores these realities. The warming of the oceans is\r\nthe main reason for the devastating increase in the\r\nforce of hurricanes that we have seen in recent years.\r\nOnce again, we would like to express our sympathy\r\nand condolences to the people of the United States,\r\nwhich is also a fraternal people among the peoples of\r\nAmerica and the world at large.\r\nIn both practical and ethical terms, it is\r\ninadmissible to sacrifice the human race by madly\r\ninvoking a socio-economic model whose destructive\r\ncapacity is dramatically rising. It is suicidal to insist on\r\ndisseminating that model and imposing it as an\r\ninfallible remedy for evils of which it is actually the\r\nmain cause.\r\nA short while ago, the President of the United\r\nStates attended a meeting of the Organization of\r\nAmerican States, and he proposed to Latin America\r\n19\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\nand the Caribbean an increase in trade measures and\r\nthe opening up of markets. In other words, he proposed\r\nneo-liberalism, when that is precisely the basic cause\r\nof the great evils and tragedies that our peoples are\r\nexperiencing. It is neo-liberal capitalism  the\r\nWashington consensus  that has increased dire\r\npoverty and inequality and that has caused the infinite\r\ntragedy of the peoples of this continent.\r\nToday, more than ever, we need a new\r\ninternational order. Let us remember that the General\r\nAssembly, at its sixth special session, held in 1974 \r\nsome in this Hall had not even been born or were just\r\ntoddlers, I am sure  31 years ago, adopted the\r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action on the\r\nEstablishment of a New International Economic Order\r\n(resolution 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI)). In addition,\r\nthe Assembly adopted, on 14 December of that same\r\nyear, 1974, the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties\r\nof States (resolution 3281 (XXIX)), which defined the\r\nnew international economic order, and which was\r\nadopted by an overwhelming majority of 120 in favour\r\nto 6 against, with 10 abstentions.\r\nThat was at a time when we voted in the United\r\nNations, because now there is no voting: now, we\r\nadopt documents, such as this outcome document that\r\non behalf of Venezuela I denounce as illegal, null and\r\nvoid. It was approved in violation of the rules of the\r\nUnited Nations. This document is not a valid\r\ndocument. We will have to discuss this document. The\r\nGovernment of Venezuela is going to make this\r\ndocument known to the world. But we cannot accept\r\nopen and brazen dictatorship in the United Nations.\r\nThese matters must be discussed; and that is why I\r\nrespectfully appeal to my fellow heads of State or\r\nGovernment represented here.\r\nI just met with President Néstor Kirchner of\r\nArgentina, and I pulled out the document. This\r\ndocument was delivered to our delegates at five\r\nminutes notice, in English only. And it was approved\r\nwith a dictators hammer. I denounce it before the\r\nworld; it is illegitimate, null and void. If we are going\r\nto accept this, then we are lost. Let us just turn off the\r\nlights and close the doors and windows. The last thing\r\nwe should do is to accept dictatorship here in this Hall.\r\nAs I was saying, now more than ever we need to\r\ntake up again what we have left unfinished, including\r\nthe proposal adopted by this Assembly in 1974 for a\r\nnew international economic order. Article 2 of the\r\nCharter of Economic Rights and Duties of States\r\n(resolution 3281 (XXIX)) confirms the right of States\r\nto nationalize any property or natural resources in the\r\nhands of foreign investors, and proposes the creation of\r\ncartels of raw-material producers. In resolution 3201\r\n(S-VI) of May 1974 the Assembly expressed its\r\ndetermination to work urgently for the establishment\r\nof a new international economic order based on equity,\r\nsovereign equality, interdependence, common interest\r\nand cooperation among all States, irrespective of their\r\neconomic and social systems. This order would\r\ncorrect inequalities and redress existing injustices ...\r\nbetween the developed and the developing countries\r\nand ensure steadily accelerating economic development\r\nand peace and justice for present and future\r\ngenerations. The aim of the new international\r\neconomic order was to change the old economic order\r\nestablished at Bretton Woods.\r\nI think that the President of the United States\r\nspoke for 20 minutes here yesterday, according to what\r\nI have been told. So I would ask the Assemblys\r\nindulgence so that I can finish my statement.\r\nThe aim of the new international economic order\r\nwas to change the old economic order established at\r\nBretton Woods in 1944, which was to remain in effect\r\nuntil 1971 and the collapse of the international\r\nmonetary system. Just good intentions, but no will to\r\nfollow through. However, we feel that that is still the\r\npath to be followed. Today, the people, and in this case\r\nthe people of Venezuela, are calling for a new\r\ninternational economic order. But we also need a new\r\ninternational political order. We cannot allow a handful\r\nof countries to attempt to reinterpret with impunity the\r\nprinciples of international law in order to introduce a\r\ndoctrine such as preventive war  it is enough that\r\nthey threaten us with preventive war  and the so-\r\ncalled responsibility to protect. We need to ask\r\nourselves, who is going to protect us and how are they\r\ngoing to protect us?\r\nI think that one of the peoples requiring\r\nprotection is the people of the United States, as has\r\nbeen painfully evident during the tragedy of Hurricane\r\nKatrina. They do not have a government that protects\r\nthem from natural disasters that are foreseen, if we are\r\ntalking about protecting each other. These are very\r\ndangerous concepts smacking of imperialism and\r\ninterventionism and trying to legalize lack of respect\r\nfor the sovereignty of countries. The principles of\r\ninternational law and the United Nations Charter\r\n20\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\nshould be the cornerstone of international relations in\r\ntodays world and the basis for the new international\r\norder that we are proposing.\r\nAllow me once again as I move towards my\r\nconclusion to quote Simón Bolívar, our liberator. When\r\nhe speaks about the integration of the world and the\r\nworld parliament, a congress of parliamentarians, we\r\nshould look at many of his proposals, such as the\r\nBolivarian.\r\nAs Bolívar said in Jamaica in 1815 (I would like\r\nto read a sentence from his letter from Jamaica): How\r\nbeautiful it would be if the Isthmus of Panama could be\r\nfor us what the Isthmus of Corinth was for the Greeks!\r\nWould to God that some day we may have the good\r\nfortune to convene there an august assembly of\r\nrepresentatives of republics, kingdoms and empires to\r\ndiscuss the noble interests of peace and war with the\r\nnations of the other three parts of the world. This type\r\nof organization may come to pass in some happier\r\nperiod of our regeneration.\r\nI urge members to face effectively, of course,\r\ninternational terrorism, but not to use that as an excuse\r\nfor unleashing unjustified military aggression that\r\nviolates international law and that has been enthroned\r\nas a doctrine since 11 September. Only close and real\r\ncooperation and an end to the double standards which\r\nseveral countries in the North apply to the subject of\r\nterrorism can eliminate this terrible scourge.\r\nIn just seven years, the Bolivarian revolution and\r\nthe people of Venezuela have been able to accomplish\r\nimportant social and economic progress. Out of a total\r\nof approximately 25 million people, 1,406,000\r\nVenezuelans have learned to read and write in one and\r\na half years. In a few weeks, we shall be able to declare\r\nour country free from illiteracy. Three million\r\nVenezuelans previously marginalized by poverty have\r\nbenefited from primary, secondary and university\r\neducation. Almost 70 per cent of the population, 17\r\nmillion people, for the first time in our history have\r\nbeen given free health care, including medication.\r\nWithin a few years, all Venezuelans will have free\r\naccess to excellent medical care. Today, we provide\r\nmore than 1,700,000 tons of food at modest prices to\r\n12 million people, almost half of all Venezuelans. One\r\nmillion of them receive this free of charge as a\r\ntransitional measure. This has led to a high level of\r\nfood security for those that need it the most.\r\nWe have created more than 700,000 jobs,\r\nreducing unemployment by nine percentage points. All\r\nthis in the midst of internal and external aggression \r\nincluding a military coup paid for by Washington and\r\nan oil coup also paid for by Washington  and in spite\r\nof conspiracies and calumnies on the past of the media\r\nand the permanent threat of the Empire and its allies,\r\nincluding incitement to assassinate a head of State. The\r\nonly country where a person can freely ask for another\r\nhead of State to be assassinated is the United States.\r\nThis happened recently when a preacher called Pat\r\nRobertson, a very close friend of the White House,\r\npublicly asked for my assassination; he remains a free\r\nman. This is an international crime, international\r\nterrorism. Well, we shall fight for Venezuela, for Latin\r\nAmerican integration and for the world. Here in this\r\nroom, we declare our infinite faith in man, who longs\r\nfor peace and justice in order to survive as a species.\r\nSimón Bolívar, our liberator and the guide of our\r\nrevolution, swore that he would not rest until he saw\r\nAmerica free. Let us not rest in body or in soul until\r\nwe have saved humanity.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The problem\r\nwith long speeches is that this will be a late evening for\r\nmany of you. But I suppose many of you are prepared\r\nfor it. The Assembly will now hear an address by His\r\nExcellency Mr. Tabaré Vázquez, President of the\r\nEastern Republic of Uruguay.\r\nPresident Vázquez (spoke in Spanish): As we\r\nsay in our small, beautiful and beloved country, it is\r\ndifficult for a capricorn to pitch his ideas following a\r\nspeech by President Chávez Frías, to use a metaphor\r\nborrowed from the zodiac. I will certainly do my best.\r\nOn behalf of the Eastern Republic of Uruguay, I\r\ncongratulate The Co-Chairpersons on convening this\r\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting, and I greet the\r\nparticipating delegations. I also wish to express our\r\ngratitude for the report entitled In larger freedom:\r\ntowards development, security and human rights for\r\nall (A/59/2005), which is to serve as a reference point\r\nfor this Meeting.\r\nThe Eastern Republic of Uruguay reaffirms its\r\nadherence to and unconditional respect for\r\ninternational law and the United Nations Charter. It is\r\nonly on the basis of such respect and the repudiation of\r\nall unilateral or collective action that violates\r\ninternational law and global multilateralism that we\r\ncan ensure international peace and security.\r\n21\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\nThe preamble of the Charter of the United\r\nNations states that We the peoples of the United\r\nNations are determined to promote social progress\r\nand better standards of life in larger freedom. Those\r\nwise and visionary words provide a broad and essential\r\nconception of freedom, including the well-being of the\r\nindividual and the advancement of society. Without\r\nsuch broad principles, the idea of liberty would be\r\nunacceptably circumscribed and peace and security\r\nwould be mortgaged by a lack of social guarantees.\r\nThere is no freedom in poverty. Poverty is not\r\njust ethically inadmissible; its very existence endangers\r\ndemocracy at home and peace abroad. That is why the\r\nfight against individual, national and governmental\r\npoverty must be the first international and domestic\r\npriority, expressed through specific and urgent actions\r\nand initiatives, because the poor of the world cannot\r\nafford the luxury of waiting.\r\nThe Uruguayan Government, which took power\r\non 1 March, is implementing a comprehensive plan to\r\ncombat domestic poverty that calls for the adoption, in\r\nsolidarity and with respect, of international decisions\r\nand efforts to eliminate that global scourge, which\r\npunishes many and heaps shame on us all.\r\nPoverty is very often linked to corruption and the\r\nsiphoning off of development funds. That is why we\r\nmust also battle corruption with the same resolve with\r\nwhich we need to fight terrorism and poverty\r\ndomestically and internationally. Similarly, universal\r\nrespect for human rights is another priority and the\r\nguarantee of a dignified life for every human being and\r\nof a more prosperous humankind.\r\nTerrorism is another scourge. It is an inhuman\r\nundertaking that must be repudiated and is\r\nincompatible with tolerance and the search for justice\r\nthrough democracy and freedom. Without prejudice to\r\naddressing the causes of terrorism, injustice,\r\ndiscrimination, the denial of human rights, the flouting\r\nof the rights of peoples, and obliviousness to the\r\npositive nature of cultural diversity, the fight against\r\nand punishment of terrorism are an unshirkable\r\nnational and international duty.\r\nInternational cooperation, the improvement of\r\nexisting instruments and, above all, their full\r\napplication in good faith and respect for international\r\nand humanitarian law, must be enhanced and\r\nstrengthened. To that end, Uruguay reaffirms its\r\ncommitment to the fight against terrorism.\r\nThis High-level Plenary Meeting of the General\r\nAssembly must establish a plan for the effective reform\r\nof the United Nations Charter, which, pursuant to the\r\nwishes of the international community and the needs of\r\ntodays world, must be updated. I cannot refer to all the\r\naspects of such essential reform, but wish to focus on\r\ntwo that are especially important to Uruguay.\r\nFirst, we agree that we should increase the\r\nnumber of seats on the Security Council. Moreover,\r\nUruguay has always questioned the existence of the\r\nright of veto. Although the conditions for its\r\nelimination do not now exist, our country, consistent\r\nwith its historical position, cannot support any\r\nexpansion of a right that it has always considered\r\nunjust and therefore cannot agree that any new member\r\nof the Council resulting from its expansion should\r\nenjoy the right of veto.\r\nSecondly, Uruguay endorses the establishment of\r\na human rights council as a principal organ of the\r\nUnited Nations made up of members designated by the\r\nGeneral Assembly. Replacing the current Commission\r\non Human Rights, it must enjoy powers commensurate\r\nwith its new nature and serve as a coordination focal\r\npoint for the promotion and protection of international\r\nhuman rights.\r\nThe Government and citizens of the Eastern\r\nRepublic of Uruguay are committed to supporting the\r\nUnited Nations and its work to promote international\r\npeace and security based on justice and law. With that\r\ncommitment, born of a history that propels us forward\r\nand a future that summons us as a nation, we address\r\nthis Meeting of heads of State and Government to share\r\nwith the citizens of the world our hopes and the\r\nchallenges and tasks that lie ahead.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency El Hadj\r\nOmar Bongo Ondimba, President of the Gabonese\r\nRepublic.\r\nPresident Bongo Ondimba (spoke in French):\r\nWith the Millennium Summit, the Monterrey\r\nConference and the Johannesburg Summit in particular,\r\nthe international community has laid the necessary\r\nfoundations for eradicating poverty throughout the\r\nworld.\r\nMy country, Gabon, has endorsed those\r\ncommitments. It has therefore begun the reform\r\nnecessary to attain the objectives that were set forth.\r\n22\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\nThe reforms address areas that are as varied as\r\nimproving public finance, administrative reform,\r\nprivatization, good governance and transparency. They\r\nalso involve creating the necessary conditions for\r\ndeveloping the private sector, which creates jobs and\r\ndrives development.\r\nIn social terms, although it is not considered to be\r\na heavily indebted poor country, Gabon has prepared a\r\npoverty reduction and growth strategy paper. At the\r\nsame time, we need to acknowledge that, while\r\nconsiderable efforts have been taken in the areas of\r\npublic housing, rural water supply, basic education and\r\nprimary health care, much remains to be done.\r\nIn addition, my country is firmly committed to\r\nfight AIDS, in particular with free care for the poorest\r\namong the sick, and by building outpatient treatment\r\ncentres throughout the country.\r\nCleaning up public finances, diversifying the\r\neconomy and undertaking thorough reform will not be\r\nsufficient to achieve the Millennium Goals. Putting\r\norder in public investment policy will not yield results\r\nif the budget is unable to allocate sufficient resources\r\nto priority sectors. That is the case in Gabon today,\r\nwith debt repayment eating up 45 per cent of our\r\npublic resources every year.\r\nWe therefore need an appropriate plan for our\r\ndebt. Without this my country will not be able\r\ncomprehensively and sustainably to meet the\r\nchallenges it is facing.\r\nYet, we have a number of assets to create a\r\npartnership that will provide development and\r\nprogress. Among them, by way of illustration, I would\r\ninclude those related to the environment and\r\nbiodiversity. Thirteen national parks have been created,\r\ncomprising 10 per cent of our national territory, and are\r\navailable and ready to be brought to the fore as part of\r\nthe diversification of our economy.\r\nI therefore call on all the members of the donor\r\ncommunity to pay particular attention to the case of\r\nmiddle-income indebted countries, such as Gabon.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Mathieu Kérékou, President and Head of the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Benin.\r\nPresident Kérékou (spoke in French): Five years\r\nago the international community adopted the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. This High-level\r\nPlenary Meeting provides us with an opportunity to\r\nassess progress made in the implementation of those\r\nGoals.\r\nToday, new challenges have emerged that require\r\nour Organization, after 60 years in existence, to\r\nundertake reform with courage and determination. The\r\nimplementation of those reforms should enable our\r\ncommon institution to be more effective, more credible\r\nand better adapted to the realities of our time.\r\nIn that connection, we pay a well-deserved tribute\r\nto Secretary-General Kofi Annan, for having submitted\r\nrobust proposals to us, laying out guidelines for\r\npromoting the long-awaited qualitative changes.\r\nIf there is one area where United Nations action\r\nneeds to be considerably strengthened, it is the area of\r\npromoting development. Development challenges are\r\nespecially urgent for the group of least developed\r\ncountries, the most vulnerable link in the international\r\ncommunity. Quantifiable, targeted commitments have\r\nbeen undertaken with a specific timetable for those\r\ncountries. We need to acknowledge that\r\nimplementation of those commitments falls far short of\r\nthe outcomes that had been anticipated.\r\nAs Chair of the Least Developed Countries\r\nGlobal Coordination Bureau, we issue a new appeal to\r\nthe international community  particularly to our\r\ndevelopment partners and to the institutions of the\r\nUnited Nations system, including the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions  to support preparations for the mid-term\r\nreview of the Brussels Programme of Action by the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-first session in 2006.\r\nIt is necessary that the international community\r\ncontinue its efforts to maintain international peace and\r\nsecurity. However, the concept of a threat to peace and\r\nsecurity needs to be redefined and restated in order to\r\nprevent certain abuses of a kind that we have seen in\r\nrecent years. For Benin, the non-use of unilateral force\r\nin international relations needs to continue to be a\r\nfundamental principle of our system of collective\r\nsecurity. That is why regional organizations henceforth\r\nneed to play an increased role in issues related to\r\nmaintaining peace and security. They therefore need to\r\nbuild upon their capacity to take action in the area of\r\nconflict resolution. We call upon the international\r\ncommunity to firmly support the African Unions\r\nefforts to that end.\r\n23\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\nIt has become necessary to establish the\r\nPeacebuilding Commission to capitalize on the\r\nprogress made in the area of support for countries\r\nemerging from conflict or crisis. The international\r\ncommunity must strengthen its action in the fight\r\nagainst the recruitment and use of children in armed\r\nconflicts. Following the adoption, on 26 July 2005, of\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1612 (2005) on such\r\nworrisome situations, it is now essential to give the\r\ninternational community the tool it needs to halt the\r\nrecruitment and use of children in armed conflicts.\r\nThat is why Benin proposes that a discussion be held in\r\nthe context of a General Assembly working group to\r\nreclassify the scourge of child soldiers as a crime\r\nagainst humanity instead of as a war crime.\r\nRespecting, protecting and promoting basic\r\nfreedoms and human rights, including the right to\r\ndevelopment, are of paramount importance at all\r\nlevels. The Secretary-General has made interesting\r\nproposals in this area aimed at transforming the\r\nCommission on Human Rights into a human rights\r\ncouncil. Whatever the form of the new structure might\r\nbe, the objective is to ensure the full enjoyment of all\r\nhuman rights by all the worlds citizens on an\r\nobjective, non-discriminatory and non-selective basis.\r\nTherefore, this is the time and the place to\r\nreaffirm our trust in the United Nations, which is\r\nundoubtedly the only universal forum for cooperation\r\namong States. Benin also places legitimate hopes in the\r\nvast undertaking of institutional reform of the\r\nOrganization, including redefining the functions of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council, streamlining the work of\r\nthe General Assembly and expanding the Security\r\nCouncil. Specifically with regard to expanding the\r\nCouncil and revising its working methods, we must\r\nfinally offer Africa just representation that takes into\r\naccount the number of African States and the specific\r\nnature of African issues.\r\nWe are at a critical stage in the history of\r\nhumanity. We have no right to fail in the quest for\r\nlasting solutions to our common challenges. We are\r\nconvinced that the skill with which the\r\nCo-Chairpersons are presiding over this summit is\r\nalready an indication that our work will lead to\r\nconcrete results that meet the expectations of our\r\npeoples.\r\nFinally, we should like to express our highest\r\nappreciation to Mr. Jean Ping, outgoing President of\r\nthe General Assembly, for his excellent work in\r\npreparing for the High-level Plenary Meeting of the\r\nsixtieth session.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Arnold\r\nRüütel, President of the Republic of Estonia.\r\nPresident Rüütel (spoke in Estonian; English\r\ntext provided by the delegation): Todays world poses\r\nnew challenges for the international community and for\r\nthe United Nations. Five years ago, world leaders\r\ngathered at the Millennium Summit to agree on the\r\nmain development goals for the twenty-first century.\r\nToday, we are here to have a midterm review of the\r\nimplementation of those goals, to set new goals for the\r\nfuture and to take decisive steps to make the United\r\nNations a more efficient Organization.\r\nEstonia welcomes the draft summit outcome\r\n(A/60/L.1), because it gives us guidelines for the\r\nfuture. I believe that our discussion will lay the\r\nfoundation for necessary reforms of the United Nations\r\nsystem and for the achievement of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nI believe that perhaps the most significant issue\r\nwe are considering at the summit is cooperation to\r\nreduce the gaps between the various development\r\nlevels of the worlds nations. We consider it extremely\r\nimportant to speed up the process aimed at achieving\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. To that end, we\r\nmust further deepen global partnerships and\r\ncooperation, increase official development assistance\r\nand ensure its more effective use.\r\nWe are convinced that cooperation can be\r\neffective only if the countries benefiting from it feel\r\nthat they own its results. We believe that the primary\r\nresponsibility for development lies with countries\r\nthemselves. Strengthening national governance,\r\nfighting corruption and better regulating the economic\r\nenvironment are significant prerequisites for enhancing\r\nthe impact and effectiveness of development\r\nassistance. If such assistance is to bear fruit, it must be\r\nbased on local needs and on sufficiently ambitious\r\nnational development strategies elaborated by the\r\nrecipient countries themselves.\r\nWorld peace and stability are also important\r\npreconditions for development. United Nations\r\npeacekeeping, to which Estonia has contributed\r\nconsistently over the years, has an important role to\r\n24\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\nplay in that regard. But countries emerging from\r\nconflict also need more international attention and\r\nassistance to ensure their development and to prevent\r\nthe recurrence of conflict. Estonia therefore supports\r\nthe establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission,\r\nwhich is to be one of the summits outcomes. We hope\r\nthat we will soon see the results of its work.\r\nAs recent terrorist attacks in the world have\r\nshown, terrorism continues to pose a serious threat to\r\ninternational peace and security. Here, Estonias\r\nposition is very clear: there can be no justification for\r\nterrorism. We are firmly convinced that terrorism can\r\nbe fought effectively only through close international\r\ncooperation that complies with international law. We\r\ntherefore believe that it is essential to adopt a\r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism. I\r\nam pleased to have signed yesterday, on Estonias\r\nbehalf, the International Convention for the\r\nSuppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, which is a\r\nsignificant step forward in developing the legal\r\nframework for anti-terrorist cooperation.\r\nWe are convinced that development and security\r\ngoals cannot be achieved without ensuring the\r\nprotection of human rights. We believe that the United\r\nNations mechanism for protecting human rights must\r\nhave the capacity to carry out that responsibility more\r\neffectively. Estonia also considers the strengthening of\r\nthe role of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nHuman Rights and of her Office, as well as an\r\nagreement on the funding of the Office and closer\r\ncooperation between the High Commissioner and the\r\nrest of the United Nations system, to be a very\r\nimportant part of United Nations reform.\r\nIt is noteworthy that we were able to reach\r\nagreement on the principle of the responsibility to\r\nprotect. Of course, each country has the primary\r\nresponsibility for protecting its own people. However,\r\nit is also important that we do everything possible at\r\nthe international level to prevent genocide, crimes\r\nagainst humanity and war crimes. It is crucial to ensure\r\nthat such crimes will not go unpunished. Here, Estonia\r\nsupports the work of the International Criminal Court.\r\nEstonia remains committed to making a\r\ncontribution by sharing its experience in establishing\r\ndemocratic institutions and engaging civil society. We\r\nalso consider the establishment of a Democracy Fund\r\nto be important so as to provide support to nations for\r\ndemocratic development.\r\nThe protection of the rights of women and\r\nchildren deserves special attention, as does the\r\nprotection of the rights of indigenous people. We\r\nsincerely hope that the process of drafting the\r\ndeclaration on the rights of indigenous peoples will be\r\ncompleted in the near future.\r\nThe efficient performance of the United Nations\r\nis crucial for peace, stability and development\r\nthroughout the world. Our world has changed in recent\r\ndecades; new threats and challenges have emerged that\r\nmake it imperative for us to strengthen and improve the\r\nOrganization. That, in turn, requires institutional\r\nreform and better coherence throughout the entire\r\nUnited Nations system.\r\nEstonia believes that the capacity of the United\r\nNations to protect human rights is one of the main\r\npillars of the Organizations credibility. That is why we\r\nsupport the speedy creation of a permanent Human\r\nRights Council. We believe, however, that it is equally\r\nimportant for that Council to have the necessary status\r\nand competence to enable it to effectively protect\r\nhuman rights.\r\nI believe that we can carry out the tasks that are\r\nbefore us; that during this session of the General\r\nAssembly we will take a significant step towards\r\nachieving the goals that we have set; and that we will\r\nalso manage to carry out the necessary reforms.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by Her Excellency\r\nMrs. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, President of the\r\nRepublic of the Philippines.\r\nPresident Macapagal-Arroyo: The mantra of the\r\nUnited Nations on its sixtieth anniversary is the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. However, the process\r\nof implementing those goals is in danger of\r\nunravelling. Why? Because of terrorism, the energy\r\ncrisis and the debt burden of developing countries.\r\nOn the debt burden, we applaud debt relief for the\r\nhighly indebted poor countries. But there are also many\r\nmiddle-income countries that are highly indebted and\r\nhave large populations that survive on less than $1 a\r\nday. In such cases, we propose a large-scale, 50 per\r\ncent conversion of debt for Millennium Development\r\nGoals (MDG) anti-poverty financing programmes. We\r\nare not asking for debt forgiveness or debt cancellation.\r\nWhat we propose is that the debt service or principal\r\namount should be converted into equities in new\r\n25\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\nprojects of at least equal value and with their own\r\npotential earnings. I hope that this debt-for-MDG\r\nproposal will find its way into the summit outcome and\r\nthat the Paris Club, the Governments of the Group of\r\nEight countries, the International Monetary Fund, the\r\nWorld Bank, the regional development banks and the\r\nworlds large commercial banks will approve it.\r\nWe are offering this option amidst the energy\r\ncrunch. On the energy crisis, we propose that the\r\nUnited Nations take the lead in collective action to\r\nease the effects of oil prices. For instance, the\r\ncollective development of alternative and indigenous\r\nenergy sources could include converting cane sugar to\r\nethanol or obtaining diesel oil from coconuts. Wind\r\nfarms and rural solar energy projects could be set up.\r\nCollective oil rationing, energy conservation and\r\nregional stockpiling could also be considered.\r\nIn addition, there could be collective efforts to\r\nintensify oil and gas exploration, similar to the\r\ncooperative seismic operations that China, Viet Nam\r\nand the Philippines started last August in areas of the\r\nSouth China Sea that they claim competitively.\r\nWe also call on the Organization of Petroleum\r\nExporting Countries to recycle petrodollars and\r\nextraordinary profits from the oil trade in the form of\r\nequity investments and long-term, low-interest loans to\r\nmedium and poor oil-importing States. We feel\r\njustified in making this call, because our overseas\r\nFilipinos contribute tremendously to the economies of\r\nthe petroleum-exporting countries.\r\nOur overseas Filipinos  8 million of them \r\nare the reason why we sponsored the inclusion of\r\nmigration in the outcome document of this High-level\r\nPlenary Meeting, as well as the holding of a high-level\r\ndialogue on migration and development. We are\r\ndetermined to leverage an effective global consensus to\r\nprotect the rights and welfare of overseas Filipinos,\r\nincluding protecting them against global terrorism.\r\nOn terrorism, the Philippines reaffirms its\r\ncommitment to fight this terrible evil. As the\r\nSecretary-General said in Madrid last March, terrorism\r\nis a threat to all States and to all people. Like many\r\ncountries, the Philippines has been struck by the pain\r\nof terror. But we have fought back with the vigilance of\r\nordinary citizens, a strong bilateral and regional\r\nsecurity network, the tools of interfaith dialogue and\r\nour strategic alliance with the United States. Our peace\r\nprocess is perhaps the only one in the world that\r\nincorporates an anti-terrorism component. Our\r\nceasefire agreement with the rebels in southern\r\nPhilippines includes the interdiction of terrorist cells.\r\nIn the fight against terrorism, interfaith dialogue\r\nhas gained legitimacy as a serious alternative approach\r\nto conflict. Religions are the bedrock of cultures and\r\ncivilizations. Religions must be respected as we pursue\r\ndevelopment. We expect the United Nations to be\r\nsensitive to the deep Catholicism of the vast majority\r\nof the Filipino people. The funding given by the United\r\nNations to our national Government for reproductive\r\nhealth will be dedicated to training married couples in\r\na natural family planning technology which the World\r\nHealth Organization has found effective compared with\r\nartificial contraceptives.\r\nThe Population Council of New York has found\r\nthat artificial contraception contributes only 2 per cent\r\nto the decline of birth rates, while the combination of\r\nimproving the economic condition of the family,\r\nurbanization and breastfeeding contributes 98 per cent.\r\nThus we ask the United Nations and donor countries to\r\ndirect their assistance towards the improvement of\r\nfamily productivity and income.\r\nThe vastness of our challenges  the deepening\r\ncut of poverty, the relentless surge of terrorism, the\r\nburgeoning debt problem and the soaring price of\r\noil  bids us find courage in our solidarity. On the\r\noccasion of this sixtieth jubilee, we reaffirm the role of\r\nthe United Nations as the primary instrument of that\r\nsolidarity.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Tassos\r\nPapadopoulos, President of the Republic of Cyprus.\r\nPresident Papadopoulos: Sixty years after the\r\nend of the Second World War, which brought untold\r\nsorrow to mankind, the High-level Plenary Meeting of\r\nthe General Assembly has rightly gathered here an\r\nunprecedented number of heads of State or\r\nGovernment to mark a historic event. It is a mark of\r\nesteem for the 60 years of firm resolution of all the\r\npeoples of the United Nations to combine their efforts\r\nto accomplish the noble aims enshrined in the Charter\r\nof the United Nations, and it is a mark of renewal of a\r\nsixty-year commitment to an international order based\r\non the rule of law. We must seize this opportunity to\r\ntake stock of the progress in the implementation of the\r\nMillennium Declaration and revitalize the consensus\r\n26\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\non new and old challenges, which need urgent\r\ncollective action.\r\nIn this respect, allow me first to thank the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, for his inspired report entitled In larger\r\nfreedom (A/59/2005) and Mr. Jean Ping, President of\r\nthe fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly, for the\r\nleadership and outstanding ability with which he\r\nguided the work of preparation for this meeting.\r\nMore than ever, today, the world needs a strong\r\nUnited Nations if we are to successfully confront the\r\nmany challenges we all face and are to honour\r\nlongstanding commitments, as last reaffirmed in the\r\nMillennium Declaration. In the five years that have\r\nfollowed the adoption of the Millennium Declaration\r\nand our jubilation at the beginning of a new\r\nmillennium, the world has witnessed unprecedented\r\nruthless terrorist attacks and a severe crisis in our\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe Republic of Cyprus believes that the United\r\nNations remains the cardinal expression of effective\r\nmultilateralism and a unique framework for the\r\ndevelopment of an international system based on clear\r\nand foreseeable rules.\r\nIt is incumbent upon us at this historic juncture to\r\nagree on joint actions for the much-needed reform of\r\nour Organization and to give it a restored purpose. That\r\ncan be achieved through the adoption of a\r\ncomprehensive and action-oriented strategy. Equal\r\nweight and attention should be given to development,\r\npeace and security, and human rights. We firmly\r\nbelieve that the strengthening of the rule of law, at both\r\nthe national and international levels, is an essential\r\nelement for the successful achievement of those goals.\r\nAdherence to commonly agreed rules and trust in the\r\nsystems ability to prevent or sanction the violation of\r\nthose rules are underlying principles of effective\r\nmultilateralism.\r\nIn a world where more than a billion people, in\r\nparticular in Africa, face extreme poverty and hunger\r\nand live in miserable conditions, our fundamental\r\nresponsibility is to declare in a credible way that\r\ndevelopment is a central issue on the agenda of the\r\nUnited Nations. We urgently need to move from\r\nrhetoric to action, because the gap between the haves\r\nand the have-nots is widening dramatically instead of\r\nnarrowing. We need to honour past commitments and\r\ntake concrete measures to achieve the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nCyprus, as a State member of the European\r\nUnion, fully subscribes to the statement delivered\r\nearlier by the United Kingdom on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union and will play its part by increasing its\r\nofficial development assistance, in accordance with the\r\nrelevant European Union decisions.\r\nThe United Nations should be empowered to deal\r\neffectively with the changing nature of threats to\r\ncollective security, such as terrorism, weapons of mass\r\ndestruction and transnational crime, while not\r\nforgetting the settlement of old disputes. Detecting the\r\nseeds of conflict at an early stage and preventing\r\nconflicts should become the cornerstone of our\r\ncollective security.\r\nThe Security Council, which has primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security, should reinforce the fundamental\r\nobligation of Member States under the Charter to\r\nrefrain from the threat or use of force and to avoid\r\naggression. The Republic of Cyprus, which has\r\nsuffered from the use of force and foreign aggression\r\nand is still suffering from occupation, firmly believes\r\nthat we need to reform the Security Council in order to\r\nreinforce its credibility and legitimacy, through, inter\r\nalia, the improvement of its working methods and its\r\ndecision-making procedures. Securing efficiency in the\r\nimplementation of its resolutions remains an absolute\r\nnecessity. In fact, our Organization will be as strong\r\nand as effective as its membership wishes or allows it\r\nto be.\r\nEven though the 60-year legacy of the United\r\nNations human rights programme is impressive and\r\nprovides a wide-ranging body of norms and standards,\r\ntoday the system for protecting human rights at the\r\ninternational level is under considerable strain. The\r\ncurrent United Nations human rights institutional\r\nframework faces considerable problems in the\r\nimplementation of those norms and standards. The\r\nmainstreaming of human rights in the entire United\r\nNations system has yet to be achieved. The respect and\r\nthe promotion of the human rights of all people, in\r\nparticular internally displaced persons, refugees and\r\nmissing persons, are of vital importance to Cyprus.\r\nIn an era of globalization and interdependence, in\r\nwhich global challenges require global responses and\r\nconcerted action, we ought to send a signal in no\r\n27\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\nuncertain terms that the clash of civilizations will\r\nsimply not take place, because we all share a universal\r\ncivilization, which is based on a belief in mankind, as\r\nencapsulated in the United Nations Charter. The\r\nCharter remains our common and unique political,\r\nlegal and moral compass.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by Her Excellency The\r\nHonourable Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga,\r\nPresident of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri\r\nLanka.\r\nPresident Kumaratunga: At the outset, I extend\r\nour sympathy and solidarity to the people and the\r\nGovernment of the United States of America as they\r\nbegin reconstruction and rehabilitation, following the\r\nrecent hurricane disaster on the Gulf Coast. We do so\r\nwhile recalling the generous and spontaneous response\r\nof the peoples and the Governments of so many States\r\nMembers of the United Nations, including the United\r\nStates, as well as that of the United Nations and other\r\ninternational agencies, when the tsunami waves struck\r\nSri Lanka last December.\r\nI had the honour to deliver my first address to the\r\nAssembly in my capacity as President of Sri Lanka at\r\nthe historic session of 1995, when the United Nations\r\ncelebrated its fiftieth anniversary. It is therefore a\r\ndistinct pleasure to revisit this forum ten years later, all\r\nthe more so because this year we commemorate both\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of Sri Lankas membership in\r\nthe United Nations and the sixtieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations. It is time to take stock and remain\r\nfocused, with a view to moving forward. We have a\r\nsubstantial unfinished agenda and new challenges to\r\ndeal with.\r\nThe United Nations is the most representative\r\nuniversal body in which to legitimately seek common\r\nsolutions to common problems that are acceptable to\r\nour diverse membership.\r\nAs recognized by the High-level Panel and by the\r\nSecretary-General in his report, In larger freedom:\r\ntowards development, security and human rights for\r\nall (A/59/2005), the United Nations, despite its many\r\nachievements, and because of its great potential, has to\r\ndo more to keep pace with the changes that have\r\noccurred in the world since its inception 60 years ago.\r\nReform of the United Nations must be in the\r\nmultilateral interest and embrace all facets of United\r\nNations activities.\r\nThe vision that we will adopt at this summit\r\nshould, indeed, be decisive. It should serve as a road\r\nmap to catalyse further change and reform. Reform\r\nmust affect our entire agenda, the mechanisms we\r\nadopt to implement it and the resources we make\r\navailable. It cannot be piecemeal, and it must benefit\r\nall Member States equitably. An integrated approach to\r\nsecurity, development and human rights is the key to\r\nthat.\r\nAllow me to revisit an issue of current\r\nsignificance  global terrorism, which was taken up\r\nboth in 1995 and at the Millennium Summit in 2000 \r\non which action remains pending internationally, even\r\nas we in Sri Lanka are trying out an integrated\r\napproach to resolving our problem in the face of great\r\nchallenge.\r\nMore than 10 years ago, my Government\r\nlaunched a bold policy of negotiated settlement in\r\nplace of conflict, and opted for a federal solution, as\r\nagainst a separate State, as demanded by the rebels.\r\nWith the support of a broad multi-ethnic coalition of\r\nparties, I proceeded to talk with the rebel armed\r\ngroup  the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam\r\n(LTTE)  about ending the conflict, and discussed\r\nwith all the parties in parliament a new, more inclusive,\r\npolitical Constitution that would share power with all\r\ncommunities. That policy shift laid the groundwork for\r\na new approach to fighting terrorism and to the peace\r\nprocess in my country that simultaneously addressed\r\nsecurity, development and human rights.\r\nWe engaged the rebels in a ceasefire that we\r\nhoped would save lives and allow people, particularly\r\nthose living in the conflict-affected areas, to live and\r\nwork more freely. That, we believed, would have a\r\npositive influence on the overall climate for peace, thus\r\nimproving security. We increased development work in\r\nconflict-affected areas because we believed that all of\r\nour citizens, irrespective of where they live, what\r\nethnic group they belong to, or even what authority\r\nthey are forced to live under, must have access to\r\nhealth, education and jobs. We believed that that would\r\ngive the LTTE  the rebel group  an opportunity to\r\nengage in useful and constructive work that could\r\nbenefit the people directly, rather than preparing for\r\nconflict.\r\nWe took a number of steps to improve the human\r\nrights of all the people of the country, with a special\r\n28\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\nfocus on the concerns of ethnic communities that have\r\nnot been fully included in the past.\r\nAs part of the peace process, successive\r\nGovernments have given the LTTE all facilities as a\r\nparty to negotiations, including access to foreign\r\nentities and Governments  at times using the good\r\noffices of the facilitators, the Norwegian Government,\r\nwho have made considerable efforts to move the\r\nprocess forward under difficult circumstances.\r\nHowever, that process of engagement and\r\naccommodation does not seem to have persuaded that\r\ngroup to move away from terrorism, as evidenced by\r\ntheir recent killing of my Foreign Minister, their\r\ncontinued recruitment of child soldiers and their\r\nkillings of political rivals.\r\nSuch actions of an armed group engaged in a\r\npeace process tests the commitment of a vast majority\r\nof the people of the country to pursuing a negotiated\r\nsettlement. Although we had the option of a military\r\nresponse, we rejected it, choosing instead a different\r\napproach. We have reiterated our commitment to a\r\nceasefire and a political solution, while reviewing the\r\nprevious approach to negotiating with that group. That\r\nreview has begun with a call to the international\r\ncommunity to help exert real pressure on the LTTE\r\nwith a view to engaging them in a process that leads to\r\nlasting peace, bringing about democracy and human\r\nrights.\r\nThe challenge we face in Sri Lanka is not unique.\r\nVulnerable democracies that have undertaken bold,\r\npolitical initiatives to address the root causes of\r\nterrorism and seek political solutions by engaging with\r\nruthless armed groups find themselves in a genuine\r\ndilemma as to how to develop a credible and\r\nacceptable approach to such negotiations.\r\nIf a democratic State, which consistently\r\nconforms to international norms and laws and uses\r\nnon-military means to address the problem of\r\nterrorism, grows weak as a result of the activities of\r\nterrorists, chaos and lawlessness will follow.\r\nExtremism, fundamentalism and tribalism will reign\r\nsupreme. As a result, peace and security, within and\r\namong States, as well as universally accepted human\r\nrights norms and fundamental freedoms, will suffer. It\r\nwill also lead to the weakening of the\r\nintergovernmental system, which is the bedrock of this\r\nOrganization. The intergovernmental system chain can\r\nonly be as strong as its weakest link. It is therefore\r\nessential to strengthen the collective ability of the\r\nsystem to combat and address terrorism.\r\nIn this regard, we must be absolutely clear that\r\ncontacts with armed non-State actors in the interest of\r\npeacemaking should not be at the expense of the\r\ncapability for democratic governance of a sovereign\r\nState that is conducting itself according to\r\ninternationally accepted laws and norms. The United\r\nNations and the international community can help in\r\ndeveloping mechanisms that support States engaging in\r\nsuch peace processes and impose sanctions on the\r\nterrorist groups that undermine them.\r\nIt is therefore timely for the Assembly to address\r\nthe question of practical means to deny external access\r\nand support to such entities to sustain their military and\r\nfund-raising activities, which are detrimental to\r\nongoing peace processes. We hope that the mechanisms\r\nalready put in place by the Security Council against\r\nsuch offending non-State actors will eventually\r\nrepresent an effective deterrent against such activities.\r\nIn the absence of such measures, those groups may\r\ncontinue to engage in illicit financing and arms\r\nprocurement, while enjoying the political privileges\r\ngained through engagement in peace processes. That,\r\nin turn, will erode the credibility of all our\r\npeacemaking efforts, including those of the United\r\nNations, as well as years of work in codifying\r\ninternational legal and other measures against\r\nterrorism.\r\nEven with rebel groups engaged in peace\r\nprocesses, we must, on the one hand, adopt procedures\r\nthat reward genuine peacemaking and, on the other,\r\nimpose sanctions for acts of terrorism. Without that,\r\nvulnerable democracies will find it extremely difficult\r\nto launch and sustain effective negotiations with armed\r\ngroups.\r\nIn his In larger freedom report, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral correctly observes that a small network of non-\r\nState actors  terrorists  have created new\r\nchallenges for the international community. The forces\r\nof globalization have aggravated that situation.\r\nTransnational networks of terrorist groups have\r\nacquired global reach and made common cause in\r\nposing threats to democracy, peace and security within,\r\nand among, States.\r\nIf we are to fight global terrorism, poverty and\r\ndisease, we must take an integrated approach to\r\nsecurity, human rights and development, both\r\n29\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\nnationally and internationally. We must act together as\r\na United Nations system to support and strengthen\r\nStates that are addressing those challenges\r\ncomprehensively. This would form an essential part of\r\nthe mission of the United Nations for the next decade.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Samuel Schmid, President of the Swiss\r\nConfederation.\r\nPresident Schmid (spoke in French): Sixty years\r\nof the United Nations existence have proved that it is\r\ntruly a universal Organization. There is no substitute\r\nfor its framework for cooperation between the nations.\r\nIt is the driving force behind efforts for development.\r\nAnd it is the promoter of peace and collective security.\r\nAnd yet, conflicts erupt and persist. The battle against\r\nfamine and poverty must still be waged. Inequality and\r\noppression remain a reality. That is why the United\r\nNations is indispensable and must be equipped to rise\r\nto the challenges of our time.\r\nIn the draft outcome document we are to adopt,\r\nwe recognize that human rights and democracy, peace\r\nand security and development are interdependent and\r\nthat they constitute the very foundation of our security\r\nand well-being. They are the three pillars of the work\r\nof the United Nations. In that regard, I would like to\r\nexpress our gratitude to Secretary-General Kofi Annan\r\nand to Mr. Jean Ping, President of the fifty-ninth\r\nsession of the General Assembly, for their efforts and\r\ncommitment to this process.\r\nMy country expresses its satisfaction with regard\r\nto the establishment of the Human Rights Council. By\r\nestablishing that Council, we should be able to adapt\r\nthe architecture of the United Nations to make human\r\nrights as much a priority as development, peace and\r\nsecurity. In Switzerlands view, that new body will\r\nhave to be both more legitimate and more efficient,\r\nhold a higher place in the United Nations hierarchy\r\nthan the current Commission on Human Rights and be\r\nbased in Geneva. Switzerland is resolutely determined\r\nto pursue the efforts undertaken over the last few\r\nmonths in order to reach the ambitious goal the\r\nAssembly has set in this crucial area.\r\nIn order to achieve the task of maintaining peace\r\nand security, it is essential that we reaffirm our\r\ncommitment to the peaceful settlement of disputes. The\r\nuse of force should remain the exception, and when it\r\nis used it should be in conformity with the inviolable\r\nprinciples of international law. There is also a need for\r\nus to better assume our responsibility to protect,\r\nindividually as well as collectively, and to make every\r\neffort to define together the criteria for its\r\nimplementation.\r\nFurthermore, we welcome the creation of the\r\nPeacebuilding Commission, which will be a new\r\ninstrument to promote collective security, ensuring the\r\ninterlinkage between the security of citizens, the\r\nre-establishment of the rule of law, humanitarian work\r\nand development. It is just as important that its\r\ncomposition be representative of the actual\r\ncontributions of United Nations Members in those\r\ncontexts.\r\nWe also feel that it is necessary that the Security\r\nCouncil become more representative and that its\r\nworking methods be reformed with a view to increased\r\ntransparency, in order to produce strengthened\r\ninteraction with non-members of the Council.\r\nSwitzerland equally wishes to reaffirm here its\r\nsupport for peacekeeping operations and its\r\ncommitment to the fight against terrorism and the\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction,\r\nparticularly nuclear weapons. That commitment was\r\nstrengthened by the signing of the International\r\nConvention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear\r\nTerrorism, which I had the honour to undertake\r\nyesterday.\r\nEnsuring security also means respecting the law.\r\nIt is therefore of the utmost importance to keep in mind\r\nthat the crucial fight against terrorism should not be\r\npursued at the expense of international law and respect\r\nfor human rights.\r\nDevelopment is an essential component of\r\nsecurity. That is why we unambiguously reaffirm here\r\nthe commitments that we made at the Millennium\r\nSummit, and then reiterated at Monterrey and\r\nJohannesburg. Increased and coordinated efforts by all\r\ndevelopment partners  industrialized countries and\r\ndeveloping countries alike, the public and private\r\nsectors, Governments and civil society  are needed if\r\nwe are to attain these objectives by the deadlines set.\r\nFor Switzerland, there is but one development\r\npath to follow: that of sustainable development in the\r\neconomic, social and environmental spheres.\r\nOur natural-resource base is running out, and\r\nunless we hasten to focus far greater attention on its\r\n30\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\npreservation, particularly in the areas of climate and\r\nbiodiversity, we will not achieve our development\r\ngoals.\r\nFor nearly 30 years, Switzerland has been giving\r\npriority to the poorest countries when it comes to\r\nassistance. Today nearly half of our aid goes to Africa,\r\na policy which we will resolutely maintain in the\r\nfuture. The aid we provide to developing countries is\r\nof high quality, and it is implemented in partnership\r\nwith its beneficiaries.\r\nHowever, coordination among the international\r\naid systems actors must be further improved. In that\r\ncontext, Switzerland fully adheres to the Paris agenda\r\non aid effectiveness and is convinced that harmonizing\r\naid remains crucial to achieving the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nSince the Monterrey Conference, Swiss official\r\naid has grown continuously and today has reached the\r\nlevel we pledged at the Conference, allocating 0.41 per\r\ncent of its gross national income to official\r\ndevelopment assistance. Switzerland now ranks among\r\nthe top 10 donors of the Organization for Economic\r\nCooperation and Development (OECD) countries.\r\nDevelopment aid will be one of the few items on our\r\nnational budget which will grow in coming years, as it\r\nis set to increase by a further 8 per cent overall for the\r\nperiod 2005-2008. Switzerland will consider increasing\r\nits quota for development aid beyond 2008 in order to\r\nfurther enhance its role in international burden-sharing.\r\nIn closing, I wish to underline that the question of\r\nmigration must be taken more seriously into\r\nconsideration. In that regard, Switzerland expresses its\r\ncommitment in the context of the Global Commission\r\non International Migration in view of the 2006 high-\r\nlevel dialogue on migration and development.\r\nAs this is the International Year of Sport and\r\nPhysical Education, allow me to conclude with a sport-\r\nrelated exhortation, with the wish that it might apply to\r\nthe United Nations: Faster, higher, stronger  in\r\nother words, greater effectiveness, transparency and\r\nsolidarity.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by Mr. Alfred Moisiu,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Albania.\r\nPresident Moisiu (spoke in Albanian; English\r\ntext provided by the delegation): It is a special honour\r\nfor me to address this summit, which, because of the\r\nimportant decisions that will be taken here and the\r\nbroad participation of world leaders, represents a\r\nmilestone in the history of the United Nations. This\r\nonce-in-a-generation meeting entails for us an immense\r\nresponsibility: to take decisions of global importance\r\nand to follow them up with global actions.\r\nAlbania has faith in the United Nations and in its\r\nimportant role in the international arena. We believe\r\nthat an effective multilateral system is helpful in facing\r\nchallenges and threats and that it ensures stable\r\ndevelopment and guarantees respect for human rights.\r\nWe subscribe to the view that the United Nations is the\r\nkey institution for translating into reality the values of\r\nmultilateralism.\r\nWe believe that development is a priority and an\r\nobjective in and of itself. We also value the importance\r\nof partnership in development. Developed and\r\ndeveloping countries have a shared and urgent\r\nresponsibility to transform that partnership into a\r\nsuccess story, and all countries have an obligation to\r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).\r\nI am pleased to be able to state that Albania is\r\ntoday an active and trusted partner in the context of\r\nglobal cooperation and action. This is having a\r\nconstructive and motivating impact on regional\r\ndevelopments in South-East Europe. Albania is also\r\nmaking ongoing efforts to fulfil all of its international\r\ncommitments.\r\nThe Albanian Government has endeavoured to\r\nintegrate the MDGs into its main national strategies.\r\nThat objective came into even clearer focus when the\r\ncountrys Assembly approved a resolution on the\r\nMillennium Declaration in July 2003.\r\nAlbania is a new democracy at the end of a\r\ntransition period with very ambitious goals in the area\r\nof national development. Thus the Albanian\r\nGovernment, in collaboration with the international\r\ncommunity, has elaborated a unification position\r\ndocument which harmonizes the development process\r\nand brings it into line with the provisions of the\r\nStabilization and Association Agreement with the\r\nEuropean Union and the National Strategy for\r\nEconomic and Social Development, as well as with the\r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nAlbania fully embraces the spirit of the\r\nMillennium Declaration and the Monterrey Consensus.\r\n31\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\nTerrorism poses a real threat to the international\r\ncommunity. It knows no borders and it threatens us all;\r\nhence the response to it must be joint and at all levels.\r\nAlbanian strongly condemns all types of terrorism. We\r\nbelieve that it is dangerous to wait. One does not need\r\nto become a victim of terrorism to grasp the full extent\r\nof the threat it poses. That is why we believe in and\r\nsupport international cooperation in fighting terrorism.\r\nMy country fully supports the powerful message\r\nof this summit as to the need to condemn terrorism and\r\nundertake concerted action to fight it. Albania\r\nappreciates and encourages the efforts being made to\r\nelaborate a comprehensive convention on international\r\nterrorism and supports its adoption during this session\r\nof the General Assembly. Albania believes that such an\r\ninstrument would represent an important achievement\r\nin the context of the global efforts made by the United\r\nNations to fight terrorism.\r\nAlbania attaches special significance to the issues\r\nof disarmament and of halting the proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction, with a view to\r\nstrengthening international security. The dangers posed\r\nby weapons of mass destruction, their proliferation and\r\nthe possibility of terrorists acquiring them remain the\r\ngreatest threats to international peace and security. We\r\nare ready to support firm language on this issue as well\r\nas to redouble our efforts to face such threats.\r\nAlbania is committed to implementing the United\r\nNations Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and\r\nEradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light\r\nWeapons in All Its Aspects. Albania supports the\r\ninitiative to create the Peacebuilding Commission as an\r\nimportant part of United Nations reform, in the belief\r\nthat peacebuilding strategies form the core of all\r\nnational reconstruction efforts.\r\nAlbania has accorded, and continues to accord,\r\ndue attention to the respect of human rights in all its\r\naspects. Albania has submitted to the relevant United\r\nNations commissions six initial reports related to\r\ncompliance with the provisions of the principal\r\nconventions in the area of human rights, and it is\r\ncurrently preparing to submit other periodical reports.\r\nAlbania believes that the creation of a Human\r\nRights Council represents a core reform proposal at\r\nthis summit. We believe that there is a need for better\r\ncoordination and greater focus of the international\r\ncommunitys efforts on promoting democracy and good\r\ngovernance. Albania comes to this summit with the\r\nfirm resolve to endorse the move for the creation of a\r\nUnited Nations democracy fund.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council, a principal\r\ninstitution in the field of collective security and the\r\nprotection of international peace, is an important step\r\ntowards the foundation of a more representative,\r\neffective and transparent institution. To make such\r\nreform as stable as possible and to give proper\r\nlegitimacy to the reformed Security Council in taking\r\nand implementing decisions, we believe that that the\r\nreform must enjoy broad consensus. We cannot fail to\r\nnote that it will take time to achieve that goal, which\r\nshould be acceptable to the majority of Member States.\r\nAny unjustifiable haste might lead to undesirable\r\ndiscord within the United Nations.\r\nAs a member of the Group of Eastern European\r\nStates, which has almost doubled in size since 1991,\r\nAlbania supports the proposal that any increase in the\r\nnumber of non-permanent seats on the Security\r\nCouncil must ensure an increased representation of that\r\nregional group, giving it at least one more non-\r\npermanent seat in the reformed Security Council.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to express my conviction\r\nthat this summit, with the large array of issues before it\r\nand with the prospects it opens for our universal\r\nOrganization, will be remembered as the new\r\nMillennium Summit, worthy of the name of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Halldór\r\nÁsgrimsson, Prime Minister of the Republic of Iceland.\r\nMr. Ásgrimsson (Iceland): Next year will mark\r\nthe sixtieth anniversary of Icelands accession to the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nNewly independent in 1946, the Icelandic people\r\nsought the clear recognition of sovereignty which\r\nmembership of the United Nations gives. The need to\r\nreinforce the countrys security through membership of\r\nan Organization committed to maintaining peace and\r\nsecurity in the world was also an important\r\nconsideration.\r\nThe sovereign equality between nations provided\r\nby the United Nations Charter, the promise of living in\r\npeace as good neighbours, and the condemnation of the\r\nuse of armed force except in the common interest  all\r\nthose were valuable principles which the new Republic\r\nof Iceland wished to subscribe to.\r\n32\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\nBut Iceland has never looked on the United\r\nNations as a mechanism solely for safeguarding\r\nsovereignty and for mediating relations between\r\nGovernments. The Charter addresses not only how we\r\nas Governments conduct our relations between\r\nourselves, matters of sovereign equality and territorial\r\nintegrity, but also how we conduct ourselves towards\r\nour own peoples  what the Secretary-General has\r\ncalled the accountability of States to their citizens \r\nand indeed, how we conduct ourselves towards the\r\npeoples of other countries.\r\nIt is my view that, up to now, the key\r\ncommitments to the peoples enshrined in the United\r\nNations Charter have not been given their due weight.\r\nThe text proposed for endorsement makes significant\r\nstrides towards redressing the imbalance.\r\nIn particular, we have established the concept of\r\nthe responsibility to protect. That idea is implicit in the\r\nUnited Nations Charter. It is therefore right that this\r\nsummit underlines the responsibility that Governments\r\nhave to their people and the duty of the international\r\ncommunity to intervene in a timely and decisive\r\nmanner if national authorities manifestly fail in their\r\nresponsibilities.\r\nWith the creation of the human rights council, the\r\nUnited Nations will obtain a powerful tool in\r\npersuading States to live up to their responsibility to\r\nprotect. It is in line with our decision to increase\r\nresources to the human rights machinery and will equip\r\nthe United Nations to fulfil its duties towards its\r\npeoples, those individuals whose human rights need\r\nwatchful and impartial protection. Work on that project\r\nmust proceed rapidly.\r\nThe decision to establish a peacebuilding\r\ncommission will provide another tool which will help\r\nto create a better future for individuals and nations.\r\nIceland welcomes its foundation and believes that, if\r\ngiven the necessary institutional weight, it could\r\nachieve much in establishing lasting peace following\r\nconflict.\r\nLarge strides have been made on development\r\nmatters. Still, there is far to go if we are to attain the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. The clear recognition\r\nof the particular problems of Africa is most welcome.\r\nThe clear restatement of the fundamental responsibility\r\nand right of developing countries to conduct their own\r\ndevelopment, the importance of private investment\r\ncapital, and the massive increase in direct development\r\naid promised by developed nations is a major\r\nachievement.\r\nThe Doha round must also make significant\r\nprogress towards creating an international trade regime\r\nthat gives developing countries access to the globalized\r\neconomy. Development assistance from developed\r\ncountries has a vital role to play in the fight against\r\npoverty and injustice. But developing countries, with\r\nthe help of the international community, need to create\r\npolitical and legal environments in which sustainable\r\ndevelopment has a real chance.\r\nIceland also welcomes the text on terrorism,\r\nalthough a universal definition is still needed.\r\nTerrorism is a threat to us all and must be condemned\r\nin all its forms. We therefore have a duty to conclude\r\nan international convention on terrorism by the end of\r\nthis session of the General Assembly.\r\nThe United Nations has made a great difference\r\nto many, but it has also failed many. If we do not\r\nreform the Security Council, we will lack the necessary\r\nstrength and power to protect and to secure and\r\nmaintain peace. Iceland believes that, with the\r\nassistance of the President of the General Assembly,\r\nthat matter can be settled before the end of the year.\r\nFinally, we believe that Iceland can make a\r\ncontribution to peace and to the welfare of all Member\r\nStates. It is for that reason that Iceland is for the first\r\ntime a candidate for a non-permanent seat on the\r\nSecurity Council for the term 2009-2010.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency The\r\nHonourable Sir Allan Kemakeza, Prime Minister of\r\nSolomon Islands.\r\nMr. Kemakeza (Solomon Islands): First of all, I\r\nwould like to take this opportunity to extend our\r\ndeepest sympathy to the Government and people of the\r\nUnited States for the tragic loss of life and property\r\nresulting from the recent hurricane in the Gulf States.\r\nAllow me to congratulate Ambassador Eliasson\r\non his assumption of the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly at its sixtieth session. Solomon Islands wish\r\nto assure him of our support during his term in office. I\r\nwish to also register, through him, my delegations\r\nsincere appreciation to the outgoing President, Mr. Jean\r\nPing, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Gabon, who has\r\nworked tirelessly with all members of this body in\r\n33\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\naddressing our fears and charting the future direction\r\nof this Organization.\r\nTwenty-seven years ago, Solomon Islands joined\r\nthis noble institution, believing in the principles and\r\nvalues it stands for. Unfortunately, this institution has\r\nnot reconciled itself with the ever-changing\r\nenvironment. Countries such as Solomon Islands have\r\nslipped from being developing to being least developed\r\nand, most recently, into being vulnerable States.\r\nRepresenting a country from a region identified\r\nas off-track in terms of meeting its Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, my delegation is positive that this\r\nsummit will revitalize our efforts towards achieving\r\nthose Goals.\r\nDevelopment remains the most important pillar of\r\nthe outcome document. Poverty reduction and socio-\r\neconomic growth are achievable if global partnership is\r\nfocused on the weak and vulnerable Members of the\r\nUnited Nations. It is the sick that need the doctor. In\r\nthis case, it is the most vulnerable countries that should\r\nbe the focus of all United Nations programmes. The\r\ngrowing number of least developed countries indicates\r\nthat the world has taken a complex approach to dealing\r\nwith the basic needs of the poorest of the poor. The\r\noutcome document shows that various development\r\nframeworks remain unsatisfactorily implemented. The\r\nMauritius Strategy recently adopted by the General\r\nAssembly, as well as the upcoming review of the\r\nBrussels Programme of Action for the least developed\r\ncountries, provide an opportunity to kick-start and\r\nredefine future cooperation between States with\r\nrenewed commitment.\r\nThe Millennium Development Goals are\r\nmultidimensional, multisectoral and interdependent.\r\nThey cannot be unilaterally achieved. A genuine\r\npartnership between developed and developing\r\ncountries is key to achieving the Goals. With the\r\nassistance of our development partners, Solomon\r\nIslands is working towards achieving, amongst other\r\nMillennium Development Goals, universal primary\r\neducation, improved maternal health, better sanitation\r\nand clean water supply, and, of course, the eradication\r\nof malaria.\r\nMore than 90 per cent of todays conflicts occur\r\nwithin States; more than half originate in least\r\ndeveloped countries. Solomon Islands welcomes the\r\nestablishment of the peacebuilding council. The\r\nAustralian-led Regional Assistance Mission to the\r\nSolomon Islands (RAMSI) represents North-South and\r\nSouth-South cooperation. RAMSIs success in creating\r\nan environment conducive to peace has given our\r\npeople the opportunity to rebuild their lives and foster\r\na secure and peaceful future.\r\nSolomon Islands is committed to addressing past\r\nharmful economic policies, including the lack of fiscal\r\ndiscipline and good governance. The country requires\r\nhuman and physical capital to raise productivity and\r\nachieve sustained growth. In order to attract and build\r\ncapital, my Government is initiating a strategy to\r\nestablish a stable macroeconomic environment. That\r\nincludes creating friendly tax and regulatory regimes\r\nand improving infrastructure.\r\nSolomon Islands debt level remains crippling.\r\nWork is under way to develop a comprehensive debt\r\nstrategy. Meanwhile, we welcome the proposal by the\r\nPresident of the Philippines to have debts converted\r\ninto Millennium Development Goal projects. Solomon\r\nIslands calls on the International Monetary Fund and\r\nthe World Bank to further explore that proposal.\r\nOver the years, Solomon Islands has consistently\r\ncalled for Security Council reform. The Council must\r\nbe more representative, democratic, transparent and\r\naccountable. It should also reflect the current\r\ngeopolitical realities. After years of debate, we\r\nunderstand how difficult it is to get a consensus on that\r\nmatter. It is our hope that the expansion of the Security\r\nCouncil will ensure a stronger focus on matters of\r\ninterest to small island developing States. Solomon\r\nIslands supports Japan, Germany, India and Brazils\r\nbids for permanent seats within the Council.\r\nMuch has been said about the challenges and\r\nopportunities of globalization. While terrorism remains\r\na global concern, the United Nations must continue to\r\naddress its development agenda. In that regard, the\r\nDoha Development Round should offer concrete\r\nproposals for all States, including the least developed\r\ncountries.\r\nIt is unfortunate that the United Nations\r\ncontinues to deny the right of the 23 million people of\r\nthe Republic of China to have a voice in this forum.\r\nTaiwan is a major player in the international system\r\nand should be accorded due recognition as a full and\r\nequal member of the United Nations family. Solomon\r\nIslands enjoys productive and vibrant relations with the\r\nRepublic of China. Solomon Islands calls on the\r\nUnited Nations to address the threats in the China\r\n34\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\nStraits. My delegation feels that preventive diplomacy\r\nmust dictate the actions of the international\r\ncommunity. Therefore, we must be proactive and\r\nresponsible. Failure to act will undermine the\r\ncredibility of the United Nations.\r\nIn closing, this is the moment for us to ensure\r\nthat the Millennium Development Goals are fully\r\nimplemented. As leaders, much is expected of us. We\r\nare duty-bound to create a world that is peaceful,\r\nprosperous and just  a world in which we can\r\nconfidently guarantee a brighter future for our children.\r\nThe draft outcome document (A/60/L.1) has something\r\nfor everyone. The challenge is to translate our\r\ncommitments into actions, lest history judge us harshly.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Royal Highness Prince\r\nSultan Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, Crown Prince of the\r\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia.\r\nCrown Prince Sultan Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud\r\n(Saudi Arabia) (spoke in Arabic): It gives me great\r\npleasure to convey the compliments of the Custodian\r\nof the Two Holy Mosques, King Abdullah Bin\r\nAbdulaziz, and his best wishes for a successful\r\nmeeting. I should also like to extend my thanks to the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly, to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, and to all those who contributed to the\r\npreparatory work for this international gathering.\r\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, by virtue of its\r\nrole in the international arena, and as the home of the\r\nTwo Holy Mosques to which all Muslims turn, is\r\ndetermined to contribute to the success of this historic\r\ngathering.\r\nThis international summit is being held five years\r\nafter the United Nations Millennium Summit, whose\r\nagreed-upon objectives still require more effort for\r\nthem to be achieved. Today we are in dire need of an\r\neffective United Nations, one that is capable of\r\nfulfilling its responsibilities to maintain international\r\npeace and security, foster sustainable development and\r\nsafeguard human rights, while respecting the specific\r\ncharacteristics of societies and cultures and their\r\ndiversity.\r\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia attaches great\r\nimportance to sustainable development. We have\r\nallocated a significant portion of our expenditure to\r\nhuman development, which has enabled the Kingdom\r\nto achieve many of the Development Goals set out in\r\nthe Millennium Summit. The Kingdom has also\r\ncontributed to development efforts in developing\r\ncountries throughout the world. Over the last three\r\ndecades, Saudi Arabia has contributed an annual\r\naverage of 4 per cent of its GDP to foreign aid. Eighty-\r\nthree developing countries have benefited from this\r\naid, making the Kingdom the foremost contributor in\r\nthe world. The Kingdom is also one of the leading\r\ncontributors to international development assistance.\r\nFurthermore, Saudi Arabia has taken the initiative of\r\ncancelling more than 6 billion US dollars of the debt\r\nowed it by some of the least developed countries, and\r\nalso has provided debt relief to countries eligible under\r\nthe international debt reduction initiative.\r\nFrom this podium, we call upon all developed\r\nnations to honour their commitments to allocate\r\n0.7 per cent of their GDP to development assistance.\r\nWe therefore emphasize the importance of attaining\r\ninternational consensus on identifying new and\r\ninnovative sources for development funding without\r\nstraining the resources of other developing countries.\r\nTerrorism threatens the entire world. It is\r\nimperative that we make a collective effort to combat\r\nit. In keeping with our Islamic faith, our heritage and\r\nour moral values, the Kingdom reaffirms its rejection\r\nand condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and\r\nmanifestations. In order to promote international\r\ncooperation in this area, last February Saudi Arabia\r\norganized an international counter-terrorism\r\nconference. The final communiqué issued at that\r\nconference, known as the Riyadh Declaration,\r\nreaffirmed the unified global will to combat terrorism\r\nand extremism and proposed practical measures to that\r\nend. The conference also adopted practical\r\nrecommendations for drying up the sources of\r\nfinancing terrorism. In addition, it supported the\r\nproposal of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques,\r\nKing Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz, to establish an\r\ninternational counter-terrorism centre, a proposal that\r\nhas received wide international support. Therefore, the\r\nKingdom is pleased to present a draft resolution to the\r\nGeneral Assembly calling for the establishment of a\r\ntask force to review the recommendations of the\r\nRiyadh Declaration, including the creation of an\r\ninternational counter-terrorism centre. We greatly hope\r\nthat the draft resolution will be endorsed so that we can\r\ntake yet another step towards greater international\r\ncooperation in fighting terrorism, which is not specific\r\nto any nationality, ethnicity or religion.\r\n35\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia appreciates the\r\nvital role played by the United Nations agencies and\r\nhopes that efforts to reform our Organization will\r\nstrengthen those agencies and enhance their\r\ncapabilities to better meet the aspirations of our people.\r\nThe Kingdom supports international consensus on\r\nexpansion of Security Council membership and\r\nrestricting veto power by prohibiting its use against the\r\nimplementation of resolutions previously adopted by\r\nthe Security Council.\r\nSaudi Arabia calls for the General Assembly to\r\nregain its mandate as the principal body of the United\r\nNations, as prescribed by its Charter.\r\nThe realization of peace and security requires\r\nadherence to the principles of the United Nations\r\nCharter, untainted by double standards in the\r\nimplementation of its resolutions. The Kingdom\r\nrenews its call to establish a zone free of weapons of\r\nmass destruction in the Middle East and the Gulf\r\nregion. It also reiterates that respect for resolutions\r\nadopted by the international community is the means to\r\nresolve global conflicts. Therefore it is important to\r\nsupport the peace process in the Middle East.\r\nThe Arab countries have affirmed their\r\ncommitment to a just peace by endorsing the initiative\r\nof the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King\r\nAbdullah Bin Abdulaziz. We hope that concerted\r\ninternational efforts will lead to the realization of the\r\nlegitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people by\r\nending the occupation and establishing an independent\r\nState, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.\r\nWith respect to the situation in Iraq, the Kingdom\r\nof Saudi Arabia reaffirms Iraqs territorial integrity and\r\nArab identity, and hopes that the fraternal Iraqi people\r\nwill overcome their differences in order to achieve the\r\ndesired objectives.\r\nFinally, I pray to God to grant us success in\r\ncreating a world of harmony and peace.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Junichiro Koizumi, Prime Minister of Japan.\r\nMr. Koizumi (Japan): Before beginning my\r\nremarks, I would like to express my deepest\r\ncondolences to those who have lost loved ones in\r\nHurricane Katrina. We stand firm in our support of\r\nthose who are struggling to recover from the horrifying\r\ndevastation.\r\nToday, I would like to share a vision of a new\r\nUnited Nations. We need a caring United Nations that\r\nreaches out to those who struggle with extreme poverty\r\nand that lends a hand to those who strive to help\r\nthemselves. We need a strong United Nations that lays\r\na path towards peacebuilding and that takes an active\r\nrole in the fight against terrorism. We need an effective\r\nUnited Nations that reflects our aspirations and the\r\nstandards of todays world, not those of 60 years ago.\r\nThe caring United Nations needs to enhance its\r\nefforts for the attainment of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. Achieving the Goals demands\r\naction, not just statements of good intentions.\r\nImplementation of the enhanced commitments made by\r\ndeveloped countries, including Japan, will serve as a\r\nfoundation for a better world. But efforts should not\r\nstop at financing. The new United Nations will need to\r\nencourage ownership by developing countries through\r\npartnership with the international community, focusing\r\non a human-centred approach that we call human\r\nsecurity.\r\nPeace does not automatically prevail when a\r\nconflict ends. The new, strong United Nations, with the\r\nproposed Peacebuilding Commission in place, must\r\nshow initiative in ensuring a smooth transition from\r\nceasefire to nation-building and to reconciliation,\r\njustice and reconstruction. Japan is ready to play its\r\npart in that challenging but vital undertaking.\r\nIn the fight against terrorism, the new United\r\nNations must play an active norm-setting role. In that\r\nspirit, I today signed the International Convention for\r\nthe Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. I also\r\ncall for an early conclusion of negotiations on a draft\r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism.\r\nThe world has changed dramatically over the past\r\n60 years. Asia and Africa, once under the shackles of\r\ncolonialism, are now significant players in our global\r\ncommunity. For the past 60 years, Japan has\r\ndeterminedly pursued a course of development as a\r\npeace-loving nation, making a unique and significant\r\ncontribution to the peace and prosperity of the world.\r\nThe composition of the Security Council must\r\nreflect those fundamental changes. Japan is convinced\r\nthat Security Council reform is a just cause for the\r\ninternational community, as is the deletion of the long-\r\nobsolete enemy State clauses from the United\r\nNations Charter. In a reformed Council, Japan is ready\r\nto play a larger role as a permanent member.\r\n36\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\nLast year, from this rostrum, I called upon my\r\ncolleagues to rise to that fundamental challenge. Now,\r\nfor the first time in United Nations history, there is a\r\nreal prospect that action will be taken, with extensive\r\nsupport from Member States. Building upon that\r\nmomentum, we must pursue an early decision for\r\nSecurity Council reform at this session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nA renewed United Nations system, including a\r\nrenewed Secretariat, must have the unwavering trust\r\nand support of all Member States and their citizens.\r\nThe new, effective United Nations must therefore open\r\nitself to rigorous public scrutiny. Japan will work with\r\nlike-minded countries to make that happen\r\nexpeditiously.\r\nReform is always a challenge, as it requires us to\r\nconfront the status quo. But that is no justification for\r\ninaction. Let us all unite in an endeavour to make this\r\nsession of the General Assembly a session for action:\r\naction to achieve the comprehensive renewal of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): The Assembly will now hear an address by\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Göran Persson, Prime Minister of\r\nthe Kingdom of Sweden.\r\nMr. Persson (Sweden): For decades, solidarity\r\nwith the poor and the oppressed has been a guiding\r\nprinciple for Sweden in international affairs. The\r\nUnited Nations has provided the structure needed to\r\nturn that solidarity into effective measures for peace\r\nand security.\r\nToday, we need the United Nations not only for\r\nexpressing solidarity; multilateral cooperation has\r\nbecome a necessity for all of us. To be sure, one can try\r\nto deal in isolation with climate change, terrorism,\r\nweapons of mass destruction, famine and disease. But\r\nmost likely, such efforts will fail.\r\nRarely has the need for joint action been so\r\nobvious as in the current Doha round. The benefits to\r\ndevelopment from trade can be realized only through\r\ngreater market access and reduced subsidies.\r\nOur times demand multilateral cooperation. That\r\nneed increases over time and is as valid for large\r\nnations as for small ones. It requires a common agenda\r\nbased on the recognition of shared responsibility. We\r\nall share the praise for progress. We all share the blame\r\nfor problems. We all share the responsibility for\r\nensuring change.\r\nTomorrow night, we will agree on a common\r\nagenda. It has many strengths. It demonstrates that\r\npeace and security, development and human rights\r\nform part of one single entity. It reminds us that we\r\nwill not succeed in one area if we ignore the others. It\r\naffirms important principles, such as our collective\r\nresponsibility to protect our populations from genocide\r\nand ethnic cleansing. It paves the way for important\r\nconcrete measures such as the establishment of a\r\nPeacebuilding Commission, the creation of a Human\r\nRights Council and the conclusion of a convention on\r\nterrorism.\r\nBut there are also areas in which we need to\r\nadvance multilateral cooperation much further.\r\nFirst, the recent lack of progress in the area of\r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation constitutes a\r\nfailure. The risks emanating from nuclear and other\r\nweapons of mass destruction are far from fading. We\r\nneed urgent measures for both disarmament and\r\nnon-proliferation. Advancement in one area will bring\r\npressure for progress in the other.\r\nSecondly, tougher action must be taken to address\r\nclimate change. A functioning Kyoto Protocol is a\r\ncrucial start, but we must also look to the period after\r\n2012. We must become better at combining economic\r\ngrowth with environmental sustainability.\r\nThirdly, we must agree on reforming the Security\r\nCouncil. The Charter includes all the provisions we\r\nneed to address the threats of our times. It requires no\r\nrevision when it comes to the use of force. What we do\r\nneed is a Security Council that better lives up to its\r\nresponsibility. We must improve the representation of\r\nAfrica, Asia and Latin America. The Councils\r\nefficiency must be safeguarded. No extension of the\r\nveto power should take place.\r\nFourthly, developed nations must increase the\r\nlevel of their official development assistance. If we are\r\nto reach the Millennium Goals, more resources are\r\nneeded for womens and childrens rights, sexual and\r\nreproductive health, the fight against HIV/AIDS and\r\nfor environmental protection. Also, measures must be\r\ntaken to ensure good governance, freedom from\r\ncorruption and strong political and economic\r\ninstitutions in all countries.\r\n37\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\nThe founders of the United Nations knew that\r\nStates working together would be able to achieve\r\nthings that are beyond what even the most powerful\r\nState can accomplish by itself. Today, we need the\r\nvision, determination and political will of those men\r\nand women. As political leaders, we have an obligation\r\nto our citizens to abide by the common agenda agreed\r\nhere. It is only through personal commitment by all of\r\nus that this will succeed.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): The General Assembly will now hear a\r\nstatement by His Excellency Mr. Guy Verhofstadt,\r\nPrime Minister of the Kingdom of Belgium.\r\nMr. Verhofstadt (Belgium) (spoke in French): I\r\nwould like to begin my statement by congratulating\r\nand thanking Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who has\r\nseized the occasion of the sixtieth anniversary of our\r\nOrganization to strengthen its effectiveness and\r\nlegitimacy. In fact, the need for the United Nations is\r\nmore palpable now than ever before. I must say that\r\nmy country, Belgium, agrees with the Secretary-\r\nGenerals ambitious proposals, as set forth in his report\r\nIn larger freedom (A/59/2005).\r\nUnfortunately, the draft outcome document\r\n(A/60/L.1) arrived at on Tuesday is not as ambitious;\r\nnevertheless, it represents a fresh start and can, I\r\nbelieve, give the United Nations a strategic impetus.\r\nOur Organization will thus be better equipped to\r\nrespond to the needs of the twenty-first century. I\r\nwould like to thank, in particular, Mr. Jean Ping for his\r\nperseverance in providing the United Nations with a\r\nnew mandate and new guidelines.\r\nBelgium fully supports the basic idea that\r\nsecurity, development and human rights are\r\ninseparable. This strategy can succeed only if we build\r\nupon powerful and representative institutions.\r\nMy country wishes to express its full support to\r\nthe speedy establishment of the Human Rights Council.\r\nWe are pleased that the concept of responsibility to\r\nprotect has finally been recognized. Let us all hope\r\nthat henceforth this should enable us to avoid tragedies\r\nlike the one in Rwanda in 1994.\r\nAt the same time, we reaffirm our commitment to\r\ncombat terrorism, to fight against the proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction and against weapons that\r\nspread instability, poverty or misery.\r\nAbove all, let us not forget the need to invest in\r\ndevelopment. If we want to create a safe, free and\r\ndemocratic world, investment in development is an\r\nabsolute necessity. This is why, five years ago, in this\r\nvery Hall, we jointly proclaimed the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals that we are reconfirming today.\r\nIt is true that some progress has been made,\r\nwhich is encouraging; but today we all must also\r\nrealize that the results, unfortunately, have\r\nsystematically fallen far short of the objectives, as\r\nshown by the limited progress in Africa. Let us, for\r\nexample, consider Goal 1, reducing extreme poverty by\r\nhalf. If the current trend continues, Africa will achieve\r\nthis Goal not in 2015 but instead in 2150  that is, 135\r\nyears late.\r\nToday, while the United Nations is celebrating its\r\nsixtieth anniversary, life expectancy in Africa does not\r\nexceed 46 years of age. Six out of 10 youngsters are\r\ncarriers of HIV. Twenty-five million people have\r\nalready died from HIV/AIDS, and just as many are\r\nliving now with this dire perspective. Of the 35 poorest\r\ncountries in the world, 31 are in Africa. Since 1998,\r\nmore than four million people have died in armed\r\nconflicts in central Africa. This is the highest death toll\r\nsince the Second World War. If this number of victims\r\nwere to be found in another part of the world, for\r\nexample in Europe, we would call it a World War.\r\nNowadays, we only speak of regional conflict. One out\r\nof every five African children today succumbs to\r\nstarvation, malnutrition or an easily curable disease.\r\nThis is unacceptable. This situation is morally\r\nunacceptable, politically dangerous and, economically\r\nspeaking, a mistake that constitutes gross misconduct.\r\nWe must help Africa out of this vicious circle, and we\r\nknow how to do it. We know what Africa needs:\r\npolitical and economic stability in order to allow\r\neconomic growth; investment in infrastructure, in\r\nhealth care, as well as equitable opportunities in the\r\nworld marketplace and, of course, peace.\r\nPeace is the first step, and it is time for us to put\r\nan end to arms trafficking. That is why Belgium has\r\nproposed starting, as soon as possible, negotiations on\r\nan international agreement on the arms trade.\r\nLike peace, good governance is indispensable,\r\ngovernance that can achieve results. We can only\r\nrealize this goal if we coordinate our aid and efforts\r\nworldwide. I am convinced that the establishment of\r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission will play a crucial role.\r\n38\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\nBelgium wants to contribute actively to this objective\r\nand is fully prepared to share her experience with\r\ntransition in the Congo and Burundi.\r\nNonetheless, and this is very important, we do\r\ninsist that agreements should be honoured and that\r\npromises should be kept. Too many promises have\r\nbeen broken: promises made by several African\r\nleaders, by several Western leaders and especially the\r\npromises of the entire international community.\r\nCurrently, Belgium spends 0.45 per cent of its GDP for\r\nofficial development assistance, thus respecting its\r\ncommitment, I am pleased to confirm, to reach the\r\ntarget of 0.7 per cent by 2010.\r\nDuring this High-level Plenary Meeting, we must\r\naccomplish one thing: we must strengthen our\r\ncommitment and, above all, carry out the promises we\r\nmade five years ago to offer hundreds of millions of\r\npeople more prosperity, more peace and more freedom.\r\nThose millions of people want to hear only one\r\nmessage: that we shall keep our word, that we shall\r\nkeep our promise.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency The\r\nHonourable Said Wilbert Musa, Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Finance, National Development and Public\r\nService of Belize.\r\nMr. Musa (Belize): Five years ago, I stood at this\r\nvery rostrum, committing my country and my\r\nGovernment to a global compact for development. As\r\nleaders, we agreed to eradicate extreme poverty and\r\nhunger, achieve universal primary education, promote\r\ngender equality and empower women, reduce child\r\nmortality, improve maternal health, halt and begin to\r\nreverse the spread of HIV/AIDS as well as the\r\nincidence of malaria and other major diseases, ensure\r\nenvironmental sustainability and develop a global\r\npartnership for development.\r\nIn addition to meeting those targets, small\r\ncountries like Belize have to find effective solutions to\r\nother grave concerns such as crime and violence in our\r\nsocieties and our vulnerability to natural disasters.\r\nThe terrible tragedy unleashed by Hurricane\r\nKatrina on a major city in the United States of America\r\nand the stunning paralysis and vulnerability it exposed\r\nshould leave a very clear idea of the damage that is\r\ndone to entire economies of small countries like Belize\r\non an annual basis, away from the glare of\r\ninternational media attention. Our sister Caribbean\r\ncountry, Grenada, is but the latest example.\r\nIn the face of these economic, social and\r\nenvironmental challenges, some would say our goals\r\nare too ambitious, too idealistic, but idealism grounded\r\nin reality is what provides the passion for concerted\r\naction.\r\nLike most other Member States, Belizes first\r\nMillennium Development Goals report shows mixed\r\nresults in the progress towards the achievement of the\r\ntargets. While there is a positive outlook for achieving\r\nuniversal primary education, eliminating gender\r\ndisparity in education at all levels, reducing child\r\nmortality and improving maternal health, there are\r\nconsiderable challenges to meeting the time-bound\r\ntargets for poverty eradication and for halting and\r\nreversing the spread of HIV/AIDS and the incidence of\r\nmalaria and other major diseases.\r\nAs a young, developing nation, we are faced with\r\nvarious demographic and economic challenges. For\r\nexample, 52 per cent of our population is less than 19\r\nyears of age, 51 per cent of our people live in rural\r\nareas and the population density is 10.9 persons per\r\nsquare kilometre, which increases the cost of\r\ninfrastructural development.\r\nGrowing inequality and income disparity, the rise\r\nin poverty hotspots especially within urban and\r\nindigenous communities, youth unemployment and\r\nmalnutrition are critical MDG-related challenges that\r\nBelize is facing.\r\nWhile we have made significant progress with\r\nrespect to reversing the spread of malaria and\r\ntuberculosis, new emerging non-communicable\r\ndiseases, such as diabetes and hypertension, are on the\r\nrise.\r\nIn addition, our vulnerability to external shocks\r\nsuch as exploding oil prices, the dismantling of\r\npreferential access to industrial countries for\r\nagricultural commodities and vulnerability to\r\ndestructive hurricanes make it difficult for countries\r\nlike Belize to avoid high public debt, which in turn\r\nrestricts our ability to invest in public and social\r\nservices to reach all our people.\r\nMy Government has taken a head-on approach in\r\nmeeting these challenges. We are very advanced in\r\ndeveloping our five-year National Poverty Elimination\r\nStrategy and Action Plan. This plan, which will be\r\n39\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\ncompleted by January 2006, is incorporating a results-\r\noriented approach to poverty reduction using specific\r\npoverty-reduction targets based on the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nAn updated medium-term economic strategy is\r\nalso under way that will incorporate debt management,\r\nfiscal policy, public-sector investment and growth with\r\nequity as integral components.\r\nAt the same time, we recognize that the\r\neradication of poverty and the improvement of the\r\nquality of lives of Belizeans will only be sustainable if\r\ngovernment is effective, transparent and accountable.\r\nSince 1998, my Government has been building a strong\r\nnational integrity system, including an independent\r\njudiciary with security of tenure, a broad-based\r\nGovernance Improvement Commission that is working\r\nto strengthen oversight institutions, like the Auditor-\r\nGeneral, the Contractor-General and the Ombudsman,\r\nand modern legislation that safeguards accountability\r\nin the administration of public finances.\r\nIt is the position of my Government that the\r\nUnited Nations and its development system are\r\nindispensable to the achievement of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals in 2015. For millions of poor\r\npeople around the world, a reformed United Nations\r\nwith an agenda for international cooperation,\r\npromoting peace and security, and development and\r\nhuman rights can literally mean life over death, hope\r\nover despair.\r\nOut of necessity, small countries like Belize tend\r\nto be more concerned with poverty and development,\r\nwhile the developed world tends to be more concerned\r\nwith security issues. These differing perspectives might\r\nbe the biggest obstacle to international cooperation in\r\nachieving the MDGs. The Secretary-Generals report\r\nIn Larger Freedom (A/59/2005) vividly and\r\ngraphically demonstrates the links between security\r\nand development. They are two sides of the same coin.\r\nCollective security can never be built on a global\r\nminefield of poverty and injustice. What is needed is\r\nthe global political will to make good on our respective\r\npledges of five years ago.\r\nAlthough the primary responsibility for\r\ndevelopment rests with national Governments, it is also\r\nessential that our developed partners follow through on\r\nthe assistance to which they committed. International\r\nassistance is a key investment in human development.\r\nThe Government of Belize, therefore, supports the call\r\nthat, for aid to be effective, the volume of aid must be\r\nincreased, aid must be more easily accessible and at\r\nlesser transaction costs, and aid must have country\r\nownership.\r\nWe must commend the efforts of the Group of\r\nEight to cancel the debt of those developing countries\r\ndesignated by the United Nations as heavily indebted\r\npoor countries. This is the type of partnership that we\r\nmust develop if we are to accomplish the full\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals\r\nin the decade to come.\r\nThe Government of Belize accepts that trade has\r\nthe potential to advance the prosperity of the poorer\r\ncountries of the world. Unfair trade practices not only\r\nlimit that potential but also are inconsistent with the\r\nGoals.\r\nAgricultural subsidies in rich countries continue\r\nto stifle the prosperity of efficient agriculture sectors in\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nThe Doha development round was launched in\r\n2000 with the overarching objective of ensuring that\r\nthe multilateral trade rules account for the needs of\r\ndeveloping countries. There are high stakes for Belize\r\nin a successful conclusion of the round, that is, a\r\nconclusion that embodies the needs and concerns of\r\ndeveloping countries, especially those with smaller\r\neconomies.\r\nThe great achievements of the past century and\r\nthe current wave of globalization have created more\r\nwealth and knowledge than ever before, making it\r\npossible for the first time in human history to eradicate\r\npoverty and improve the quality of life for men,\r\nwomen and children.\r\nYet, there is persistent poverty and growing\r\nhuman insecurity. Our strategy of achieving sustainable\r\neconomic growth together with social equity requires\r\nfundamental reform of social policies to reflect\r\nprinciples of universality, inclusion and solidarity. We\r\nmust all recognize that we are our brothers and our\r\nsisters keepers. For Belize, the United Nations and its\r\nCharter epitomize these core and indispensable\r\nprinciples. The lives of millions around the world hang\r\nin the balance. Let us not lose this opportunity to\r\nchange our world for the betterment of all.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by Her Excellency\r\n40\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\nMs. Truong My Hoa, Vice-President of the Socialist\r\nRepublic of Viet Nam.\r\nMs. Truong My Hoa (Viet Nam) (spoke in\r\nVietnamese; interpretation provided by the delegation):\r\nFive years ago leaders from 189 countries solemnly\r\nadopted the Millennium Declaration out of a deep\r\ndesire for humanity to live in a more peaceful,\r\nprosperous and just world. Looking back over those\r\nyears, we rejoice to note the progress achieved in\r\nimplementing the Millennium Development Goals\r\n(MDGs). Nevertheless, we cannot help but be\r\nconcerned about the lack of progress or efficiency in\r\nthe implementation of the MDGs in a large number of\r\ncountries and regions. While we recognize\r\nshortcomings in national development policies and\r\ninstitutional capacity, we can all clearly see that those\r\ndifficulties also arise from the international political\r\nand economic environment, which has become more\r\ncomplex, especially with the rise of terrorism and the\r\ngrowing tendency to use force in international relations\r\nand to resort to protectionism in trade.\r\nFor a long time the Vietnamese people have been\r\nhighly esteemed by the international community for\r\ntheir resolve and courage in the struggle to protect\r\npeoples human rights to live in freedom and\r\nindependence and to determine their own destiny.\r\nNowadays Viet Nam is commended for its important\r\nsocio-economic achievements and its implementation\r\nof the MDGs. I take this opportunity to draw members\r\nattention to the fact that, as of 2004, Viet Nam had\r\nreduced poverty rates by three fifths as compared with\r\n1993, thus attaining the MDG of halving poverty 10\r\nyears ahead of schedule. Regarding universal primary\r\neducation, Viet Nam eliminated illiteracy and achieved\r\nuniversal primary education back in 2000 and at\r\npresent  universal junior secondary education exists\r\nin nearly half of the provinces in Viet Nam. Significant\r\nprogress in promoting gender equality is clearly\r\nreflected in the constant rise of Viet Nams gender\r\ndevelopment index, from 0.668 in 1998 to 0.689 in\r\n2004. More than 27 per cent of parliamentarians in the\r\nVietnamese National Assembly are women, ranking\r\nViet Nam among the leading countries for this\r\nindicator in the Asia-Pacific region. Women are today\r\nfully recognized for their significant role in the family\r\nand in society. As for the other MDGs, the under-five\r\nmortality rate has been halved and the maternal\r\nmortality rate has been reduced by one third as\r\ncompared with 1990.\r\nThe Vietnamese Government has submitted a\r\nnational report on the implementation of the MDGs in\r\nViet Nam, to contribute to discussions during this\r\nsummit. The root cause of the encouraging results in\r\nViet Nam just mentioned is the determination to\r\npromote the cause of socio-economic development\r\nevinced by the State and the people of our country.\r\nOther positive factors contributing to implementation\r\nof the MDGs in Viet Nam include perseverance in\r\nreform, integration of the MDGs into national socio-\r\neconomic development and international cooperation\r\nprogrammes, mobilization of domestic resources,\r\nactive integration into the global economy, expansion\r\nof external economic relations, a combination of\r\neconomic growth and promotion of social welfare,\r\nadministrative reforms and enhancement of the\r\ncapacity and wide participation of the people.\r\nLet me, on behalf of the Vietnamese Government\r\nand State, take this opportunity to express our high\r\nappreciation to United Nations organizations, bilateral\r\nand multilateral donors, international non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and foreign friends for the\r\nvaluable assistance extended to Viet Nam for our\r\ndevelopment.\r\nAlthough the implementation of the MDGs is the\r\nprimary responsibility of each country, the assistance\r\nof the international community is very important. To\r\nbetter assist developing countries in successfully\r\nachieving the MDGs by 2015, we wish to make the\r\nfollowing recommendations: first, honour the\r\ncommitment to allocate 0.7 per cent of gross national\r\nproduct to development assistance, reduce and write\r\noff debt for developing nations and facilitate the\r\naccession of the developing countries to the World\r\nTrade Organization; secondly, implement the MDGs\r\nand other commitments made at global conferences\r\nover the previous decade; thirdly, assist developing\r\ncountries in framing strategies and building capacity to\r\nachieve the MDGs and increase coordination of donor\r\nassistance; fourthly, strengthen support for South-\r\nSouth cooperation, including the two plus one\r\ncooperation programmes between Viet Nam and a\r\nnumber of African countries.\r\nFor a long time we have agreed on the need to\r\nreform the United Nations to make the Organization\r\nmore efficient in fulfilling the mandates enshrined in\r\nthe United Nations Charter and to reflect the enormous\r\nchanges in the world over the past 60 years. On this\r\nissue, Viet Nam shares the views of a large number of\r\n41\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\nnations that the reform of the United Nations must be\r\nbased on the fundamental principles of the United\r\nNations Charter and must be conducted in a balanced\r\nand comprehensive way, with a view to ensuring\r\ndemocracy, transparency and representativeness of the\r\nOrganization, as well as to increasing its efficiency in\r\nthe interest of all Member States.\r\nRecent complex developments in the world give\r\nadded urgency to the task of bridging the development\r\ngap and promoting equitable and sustainable\r\ndevelopment within and between countries with a view\r\nto rooting out the causes of instability in the world\r\ntoday. The MDGs are a crucial means to that end.\r\nFor its part, Viet Nam reiterates its commitment\r\nto the implementation of the MDGs. In fulfilling and\r\nsurpassing those Goals, we will also help to achieve\r\nthe common goal of our people, namely, to build a\r\nstrong Viet Nam with prosperous citizens, and a just,\r\ndemocratic and civilized society.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Ahmad\r\nZia Massoud, Vice-President of the Islamic Republic of\r\nAfghanistan.\r\nMr. Massoud (Afghanistan) (spoke in Farsi;\r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): At the outset,\r\nallow me, on behalf of the Government and the people\r\nof Afghanistan, to express my heartfelt condolences to\r\nthe Government and the people of the United States of\r\nAmerica in connection with the tragic loss of life and\r\nthe widespread destruction caused by Hurricane\r\nKatrina.\r\nIt is a great and distinct privilege for me to\r\naddress the High-level Plenary Meeting of the sixtieth\r\nsession of the General Assembly on behalf of the\r\nIslamic Republic of Afghanistan. This occasion\r\nprovides a unique opportunity for all Member States to\r\nreview lessons learned and assess the present situation\r\nand future prospects.\r\nFor the past 60 years, the United Nations has\r\nbeen engaged in the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security, development and the protection and\r\npromotion of human rights. The values and principles\r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations are still\r\nvalid. However, the end of the cold war, the new\r\ngeopolitical realities of todays world and the\r\nemergence of new threats and challenges require a\r\nrethinking of the Organizations role.\r\nWe welcome the presentation of the three\r\ncomprehensive reports: the report of the High-level\r\nPanel on Threats, Challenges and Change, entitled A\r\nmore secure world: our shared responsibility\r\n(A/59/565); the report of the Millennium Project,\r\nentitled Investing in Development (A/59/727); and\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General entitled In larger\r\nfreedom: towards development, security and human\r\nrights for all (A/59/2005).\r\nAt the time of the Millennium Summit in\r\nSeptember 2000, Afghanistan, owing to the situation\r\nprevailing in the country, was unable to adopt a\r\nnational strategy for the achievement of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). However,\r\nsince the Bonn process began, Afghanistan, with the\r\nassistance of the international community, has made\r\nimpressive gains in the social, political and economic\r\nfields.\r\nWe have convened two loya jirgas. The first led\r\nto the formation of a Transitional Government. The\r\nsecond adopted a new constitution establishing a\r\ndemocratic Islamic State. Furthermore, we successfully\r\nheld presidential elections, and, in less than three days,\r\nwe will hold parliamentary and provincial elections.\r\nMore than 5 million children, including girls,\r\nhave returned to school throughout Afghanistan, and\r\napproximately 4 million refugees have returned to their\r\nplace of origin from neighbouring countries. However,\r\nthe effects of the armed conflicts imposed on my\r\ncountry persist. Poverty, the high rates of infant and\r\nmaternal mortality and the lack of resources for basic\r\nsocial services make the international communitys\r\ncontinued assistance indispensable.\r\nThe successful holding of the parliamentary\r\nelections will mark the last step towards\r\nimplementation of the historic Bonn Agreement of\r\nDecember 2001. The international communitys\r\nsustained support and engagement are required over\r\nthe coming years for the rehabilitation and the\r\nreconstruction of the country, as well as for the\r\nconsolidation of peace and security.\r\nIn that regard, we emphasize the following key\r\nprinciples for the further enhancement of cooperation\r\nbetween the Afghan Government and the international\r\ncommunity: the Afghan Governments leadership role\r\nin all aspects of the reconstruction process; the need\r\nfor a just allocation of resources throughout the\r\ncountry; the need to ensure that international efforts\r\n42\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\nserve to build lasting capacity and sustainable\r\ninstitutions; and, finally, the need to ensure public\r\ntransparency and accountability at all levels.\r\nAfghanistan is in the process of preparing its\r\nnational development strategy, which includes a\r\nprogramme of action to achieve the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. Owing to the circumstances\r\nAfghanistan faced at the time of the 2000 Summit, we\r\nhave fixed 2020, rather than 2015, as our target date\r\nfor achieving the Goals.\r\nAfghanistan is one of the least developed\r\ncountries of the world. We firmly stress the importance\r\nof implementing the Programme of Action of the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on the Least Developed\r\nCountries held in Brussels in May 2001.\r\nWe also underline the need for continued,\r\ncoordinated and effective international support for\r\nachieving the development goals in countries emerging\r\nfrom conflict. In that context, my Government\r\nwelcomes, and expresses its full support for, the\r\nproposal of the High-level Panel on Threats,\r\nChallenges and Change to establish a Peacebuilding\r\nCommission and a Peacebuilding Support Office\r\nwithin the framework of the United Nations.\r\nWhile recognizing the Security Councils primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security, the Islamic Republic of\r\nAfghanistan would like to stress the importance of the\r\nlong needed reform of the Council in terms of both its\r\ncomposition and its working methods.\r\nTerrorism continues to be one of the main threats\r\nto international peace and security. More than any\r\nother country, Afghanistan continues to suffer that\r\nglobal menace. The Government of Afghanistan\r\nstrongly condemns terrorism in all its forms and\r\nmanifestations and reaffirms its commitment to\r\ncooperate with the international community to\r\neliminate that scourge. In that context, Afghanistan\r\nwelcomes and supports the ongoing efforts carried out\r\nwithin the framework of the United Nations to finalize\r\nthe draft comprehensive convention on international\r\nterrorism.\r\nLet me conclude by expressing Afghanistans full\r\nsupport for the outcome document before us. We are\r\nconfident that this historic gathering of world leaders\r\nwill result in a more efficient and more effective\r\nOrganization, better able to address the challenges of\r\nthe twenty-first century and ensure the prosperity,\r\nsecurity and dignity of the peoples of the world.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by Mr. Roberto de Almeida,\r\nPresident of the National Assembly of Angola.\r\nMr. Almeida (Angola) (spoke in Portuguese; text\r\nprovided by the delegation): It is for me a great honour\r\nto address the Assembly on behalf of His Excellency\r\nMr. José Eduardo dos Santos, President of the Republic\r\nof Angola.\r\nAllow me, at the outset, to congratulate the Co-\r\nChairpersons and to reiterate how pleased we are to see\r\nthem presiding over the High-level Plenary Meeting of\r\nthe sixtieth session of the General Assembly.\r\nAlso, we wish to express our sincere sympathy\r\nand solidarity with the victims of Hurricane Katrina.\r\nThe reports on implementation of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration and the report of the Secretary-General\r\nentitled In larger freedom (A/59/2005), prepared as\r\ninput for this summits debates, highlight the\r\ncomplexity of the challenges faced by the international\r\ncommunity. Indeed, the international community is no\r\nlonger in a phase of reaffirming commitments; rather,\r\nthe time has come for it to muster the political will to\r\nmobilize the resources required to fulfil the obligations\r\nit has committed to in all major United Nations\r\nconferences, among which I would highlight the World\r\nSummit for Social Development; the Millennium\r\nSummit; the Monterrey Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment; and the Johannesburg World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development.\r\nIn this context, there is an imperative need to\r\ncorrect the anomalies currently affecting international\r\ntrade so that it can become a true driver of\r\ndevelopment; to broaden South-South cooperation; to\r\nforgive the debt of poor countries; and to promote\r\nscience and technology as critical factors influencing\r\nthe progress of developing countries.\r\nOther essential questions are those relating to the\r\nrole of education and its adaptation to the realities and\r\nneeds of emerging countries; gender; and the fight\r\nagainst the HIV/AIDS pandemic, which is today one of\r\nthe main threats to the peoples of Africa and other\r\nregions of the world.\r\nWe are in absolute agreement with the analysis\r\nand conclusions contained in the Secretary-Generals\r\n43\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\nreports. I would like to take this opportunity to\r\ncommend the Secretary-General for his personal\r\ncommitment, dedication and leadership, as well as for\r\nhis outstanding contribution to the reaffirmation of the\r\nobjectives and principles set out in the United Nations\r\nCharter, the sixtieth anniversary of which we very\r\nproudly commemorate.\r\nWe welcome the draft political Declaration before\r\nthe Assembly at this summit. The Angolan delegation\r\nis very pleased with the agreements achieved on the\r\nfour main topics of the development cluster, namely,\r\nthe Millennium Goals, foreign debt, trade and\r\ndevelopment aid. Furthermore, we would like to stress\r\nthat in the final document references have been\r\nincluded to the special needs of Africa.\r\nOn the subject of terrorism, the recent adoption\r\nof the International Convention for the Suppression of\r\nActs of Nuclear Terrorism demonstrates that it is also\r\npossible to reach an agreement when the subject is the\r\nfight against terrorism, including arriving at a\r\ndefinition. The Angolan delegation shares the view that\r\nthe fight against terrorism requires a worldwide\r\nstrategy, and for that reason we commend current\r\nefforts to conclude an international convention against\r\nterrorism.\r\nWe support the creation of the Peacebuilding\r\nCommission, the objective of which, as set out in the\r\nfinal document, is to assist countries emerging from\r\nconflict in the process of their economic recovery,\r\npreservation and peacebuilding. However, based on our\r\nown experience, we believe the mandate of the\r\nPeacebuilding Commission would not be complete if it\r\ndid not include a conflict prevention component.\r\nThe Angolan delegation supports the idea that we\r\nmust pay attention to the specificities of post-conflict\r\ncountries that are facing problems of an economic and\r\nsocial nature, the resolution of which has a direct\r\nbearing on the preservation and consolidation of peace.\r\nRegrettably, those aspects are not always given due\r\nattention and, since the funds required for\r\nreconstruction are not mobilized in sufficient measure,\r\nsuch countries are unduly penalized. Such is the\r\ncurrent situation in Angola  a situation that we\r\nconsider to be extremely unfair.\r\nThe Angolan delegation is pleased to note that\r\nthere is a broadening and  hopefully  continuing\r\ndebate on such sensitive issues as the use of force in\r\ninternational relations, the responsibility to protect and\r\nthe Human Rights Council.\r\nIn proposing a series of measures designed to\r\nstrengthen the United Nations, the Secretary-General\r\nprovided an opportunity for institutional reform. That\r\neffort will be able to succeed only if United Nations\r\nagencies are able to fully perform their functions as set\r\nout in the Charter. We therefore reaffirm the central\r\nrole of the General Assembly as the main deliberative\r\nbody of the United Nations.\r\nWith regard to the Security Council, we agree\r\nthat it should be more representative, efficient and\r\ntransparent. The international community, on behalf of\r\nwhich the Security Council makes its decisions based\r\non the Charter, must feel that it is integral to the\r\ndecision-making mechanism.\r\nAnother problem which must be of concern to the\r\ninternational community is the illicit exploitation of\r\nnatural resources. This constitutes a threat to both\r\npeace and security, prevents the development of\r\naffected countries and contributes to massive human\r\nrights violations.\r\nIn this regard, the Angolan delegation underlines\r\nthe importance of ensuring respect for international\r\nhumanitarian law, particularly as it relates to the\r\nprotection of civilians in conflict situations. In my\r\ndelegations view, the prevailing lack of respect for\r\nhumanitarian law deserves particular and urgent\r\nattention from the United Nations.\r\nIn Angola, we have been trying to implement the\r\nMillennium Development Goals, and we are continuing\r\nto make every effort to consolidate peace and promote\r\nnational reconciliation so as to ensure both economic\r\nand social stability for our country. At the same time,\r\nwe are committed to bringing political activity back to\r\nnormal, and to ensuring that democratic institutions are\r\nfully operational. Preparations for general elections in\r\n2006 are at an advanced stage.\r\nLet me conclude by underscoring our belief that\r\nnever before has humankinds destiny has been so\r\ninterconnected as in our time. We must respond in a\r\ncollective manner with unity of action that safeguards\r\nthe interests of not just a few, but all of us. Thus the\r\npreservation of the central role of the United Nations in\r\ninternational relations is of the utmost importance.\r\nGiven its mandate, its universal character and the\r\nnumber of its organizations and programmes, the\r\n44\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\nUnited Nations is well positioned to consider the issues\r\nthe world faces in the twenty-first century. The nature\r\nand complexity of those issues will evolve over time,\r\nbut their overarching characteristic is that their effects\r\ndo not respect borders. Thus only farsighted and wide-\r\nranging actions on the part of the international\r\ncommunity can provide the positive answers that\r\nhumankind expects and deserves.\r\nIn conclusion, I hope that the final document to\r\nbe adopted at this summit will represent a major\r\ncontribution to the Millennium Goals and targets:\r\npeace, collective security, sustainable development and\r\nthe promotion of human rights.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Joschka Fischer, Deputy Federal Chancellor and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Germany.\r\nMr. Fischer (Germany) (spoke in German;\r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): In the world\r\nof the twenty-first century, we are confronted almost\r\ndaily with new risks and dangers. How can we avert\r\nconflicts about limited resources? How can we\r\npreserve the global ecosystem? How can we overcome\r\nthe growing gap between rich and poor? How should\r\nwe shape globalization? How do we ensure\r\ndevelopment opportunities for everyone? How do we\r\nprevent global conflicts?\r\nAbove all, security in the twenty-first century\r\nmeans investment in development, in democracy and in\r\nhuman rights. All of those challenges are inseparably\r\nlinked. They are our core tasks.\r\nFive years after the Millennium Summit, we, the\r\nmembers of the United Nations, must assess together\r\nthe extent to which we have achieved the Goals laid\r\ndown in 2000. We must discuss how we want to\r\nproceed in order to implement the Millennium\r\nDeclaration further and in full. And we must make the\r\nUnited Nations, as the mainstay of multilateralism,\r\nstronger and more efficient. We therefore welcome the\r\nfact that the international community has succeeded,\r\nafter all, in agreeing on a summit document (A/60/L.1).\r\nThat paper provides a point of departure for further\r\nnegotiations, even if it falls short of our expectations in\r\nmany areas.\r\nThe Millennium Development Goals are the\r\nsocial Magna Carta of our time. Our actions must be\r\nguided by them. Now we must continue to work to\r\nmake them binding. For we cannot accept that well\r\nover 1 billion people are living on less than one dollar\r\na day. We cannot allow a situation to exist in which 11\r\nmillion children die each year before their fifth\r\nbirthday.\r\nWe must greatly strengthen the rights of women,\r\nand we must do everything we can to ensure that\r\nwomen finally have equal opportunities in education,\r\nin vocational training and at work. We must ensure that\r\nenvironmental protection and the principles of\r\nsustainable development become key components of\r\ninternational policy. Only in that way can hunger,\r\npoverty and disease be overcome on a lasting basis.\r\nOnly in that way can we stop the ever-greater\r\ndestruction of the sources of life on our planet.\r\nGermany is aware of its responsibility in that\r\nrespect. We want to increase our development aid, and\r\nwe have agreed with our European partners on a step-\r\nby-step plan until 2015 to that end. We are also\r\nconsidering new instruments to finance development.\r\nWe are working with other States on the Action\r\nAgainst Hunger and Poverty alliance initiated by\r\nPresident da Silva. Fairer trade conditions \r\nespecially free access to markets  are vital for lasting\r\ndevelopment. However, it must also be said that lasting\r\nsuccesses will be achieved only through developing\r\ncountries own efforts  in particular, good\r\ngovernance and the implementation of rule-of-law\r\nprinciples.\r\nDevelopment is also inextricably linked to\r\nclimate protection. We therefore must do everything in\r\nour power to implement the Framework Convention on\r\nClimate Change and to further develop the Kyoto\r\nProtocol. The steady rise in the number of natural\r\ndisasters means that vigorous action must be agreed\r\nupon at the international level.\r\nDiscussing those issues today as representatives\r\nof our States, we must not forget that people in our\r\ncountries are not interested in debates about agendas or\r\nprocedure. They want our discussion to be decision-\r\nand result-oriented. Therefore, Germany would have\r\npreferred a document with a clearer mandate for action\r\nin many areas. It is regrettable that no agreement could\r\nbe reached on the key issue of disarmament and non-\r\nproliferation or on the definition of terrorism. Our task\r\nmust now be to discuss how we can nonetheless make\r\nprogress in those spheres of key importance to\r\ninternational security.\r\n45\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\nAlthough I welcome the proposal contained in the\r\nsummit document to establish a human rights council,\r\nit raises serious questions. Without universal protection\r\nof human rights and without the promotion of\r\ndemocracy and the rule of law, we will neither achieve\r\nsustainable development nor be able to guarantee\r\nlasting peace and stability. Therefore, we must do\r\neverything we can to make the new body a powerful\r\ninstrument. The negotiating body set up for that\r\npurpose should present its proposals as quickly as\r\npossible, preferably by the end of the year.\r\nThe proposal to establish a Peacebuilding\r\nCommission is also of great significance, because\r\npreserving world peace and international security\r\nremains the most important undertaking for the United\r\nNations. The Commission will fill a gap in the\r\nOrganizations institutional structure.\r\nIf we want to make the United Nations equal to\r\nthe task of securing peace, stability and development\r\ncomprehensively and globally, then we must equip it to\r\ncope with the challenges of the twenty-first century.\r\nThe pressure of globalization and international crises\r\nand conflicts have made radical reform essential in all\r\nspheres.\r\nI am firmly convinced that the ultimate success of\r\nsuch reforms will largely depend on reform of the\r\nSecurity Council. Excuses and half-hearted or bad\r\ncompromises will not advance our cause. The group-\r\nof-four countries have submitted a proposal that meets\r\nthe needs of the United Nations, its Member States and\r\nits regions. Those reforms must stay on the agenda. I\r\ncall upon all Members to resume consultations on\r\nreforms at this sixtieth session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nIn the twenty-first century, the world will need a\r\nstrong United Nations that has been renewed in every\r\nsphere. Either we act now and shape globalization\r\nthrough cooperation and partnership, or the crises and\r\nconflicts of the globalized world will force us to\r\nrespond. We will therefore join forces with our partners\r\nand friends and will work with determination and the\r\nnecessary patience to strengthen the United Nations by\r\nrenewing it.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): I now give the\r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Jean Asselborn, Deputy\r\nPrime Minister, Minister for Foreign Affairs and\r\nImmigration of Luxembourg.\r\nMr. Asselborn (Luxembourg) (spoke in French):\r\nSixty years ago, on 26 June 1945, the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations, which created the Organization and\r\nwhose humanist and generous spirit continues to\r\ninspire our action to the present day, was signed in San\r\nFrancisco. That fundamental and innovative act  the\r\nlesson drawn by the international community from the\r\nfailure of the League of Nations and from the\r\ntribulations of war  still arouses our admiration\r\ntoday. My country, Luxembourg, is very proud to have\r\nbeen among the founding members that carried the\r\nUnited Nations to the baptismal font.\r\nToday, 60 years later, we are meeting on the\r\nbanks of the East River to show the same courage and\r\nthe same vision for the benefit of our common\r\nendeavour, the United Nations. It is up to us to be\r\nworthy of the heritage we have received and to take up\r\nwith firm and confident hands the torch handed to us\r\nby our predecessors.\r\nAs so well stated by our Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, whose action at the head of the\r\nOrganization we commend, the United Nations is\r\nindeed at a crossroads. We must adopt the policies and\r\ndecisions that will lead to a genuine renewal of\r\nmultilateralism, with the United Nations at its core.\r\nThat is the challenge we face; that is what is at stake at\r\nthis summit.\r\nA great debate began in January this year under\r\nthe enlightened guidance of the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-ninth session, Mr. Jean\r\nPing. Here, I should like to pay public tribute to his\r\nmany presidential qualities. During much of that time,\r\nmy country had the honour to serve in the presidency\r\nof the European Union and thus was able not only to\r\nlead our internal work with a view to developing the\r\nEuropean Unions positions on the various subjects\r\nunder discussion, but also to present and defend\r\nEuropean points of view during the debates conducted\r\nunder the aegis of the Assembly presidency. In parallel,\r\na broad consultation process was initiated by the\r\nEuropean Union in New York, in capitals and at many\r\nministerial meetings with groups of third countries or\r\nindividual countries to launch the political momentum\r\nthat must form the very basis for United Nations\r\nreform.\r\nThroughout that work, now continued\r\nenergetically under the British presidency, the\r\nEuropean Union has shown itself to be a determined\r\n46\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\nand committed partner motivated by a strong will to\r\nachieve ambitious and balanced results, in keeping\r\nwith the objective set during the European Council of\r\nMarch 2005. That ambition obviously continues to\r\nguide us. The search for innovative solutions is\r\ninevitable, given that we see a growing\r\ninterdependence of challenges and threats.\r\nIncreasingly, peace and security, development, human\r\nrights, democracy and the rule of law are all linked\r\nthrough close interactions.\r\nFaced with this situation, the answer is clear: we\r\nneed an effective and overhauled multilateralism that is\r\nadapted to the special circumstances of the beginning\r\nof the twenty-first century and provided with sufficient\r\ninstruments and resources to carry out its mission fully.\r\nDevelopment is and must remain the focus of\r\ninternational attention. Whereas many studies, the\r\nlatest of which is the 2005 Human Development\r\nReport, confirm that progress towards the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals is still uneven and that delays and\r\neven setbacks are regrettably occurring in certain\r\nregions, particularly in Africa.\r\nGiven the scourge of underdevelopment, we must\r\nact and act quickly. In May of this year, under our\r\npresidency, the European Union took a major decision\r\nto mobilize substantial additional official development\r\nassistance and to reach the target of 0.7 per cent of\r\ngross national income between now and 2015.\r\nMy country is proud to be part of the group of\r\ncountries, still too small, that will achieve the 0.7 per\r\ncent of gross national income rate in a few years.\r\nSubstantial efforts must be made by donor and\r\nrecipient countries to improve the quality of assistance,\r\ngood practices, good governance and to combat\r\ncorruption.\r\nTrade questions will be at the top of the world\r\nagenda as the World Trade Organization Ministerial\r\nConference in Hong Kong approaches. Humanitarian\r\ndisasters, the tsunami, recent famines in Africa and\r\nHurricane Katrina have reminded us, if there ever was\r\na need, of the fact that we need to have instruments\r\nwith sufficient financial resources that can be\r\nmobilized more quickly and on a more predictable\r\nbasis.\r\nWith this in mind, my country strongly supports a\r\nreview of the Central Emergency Revolving Fund\r\n(CERF) and has already announced its determination to\r\ncontribute substantially to a strengthened CERF.\r\nToday, our Minister for Cooperation announced that\r\nLuxembourg will give four million dollars to this fund.\r\nImproved continuity and consistency must mark the\r\naction of the international community in post-conflict\r\nsituations. This idea is central to the new\r\nPeacebuilding Commission, which we opportunely\r\ndecided to create and which should be set up quickly.\r\nThis Commission will allow us to improve our\r\nmanagement of crises and humanitarian activities and\r\nwill re-launch the development process.\r\nInternational intervention must be based on the\r\nfundamental axiom that there is no peace without\r\ndevelopment and no development without peace.\r\nIn the spring of 2005 in this very same Hall\r\nduring a very dignified and moving ceremony, we\r\ncommemorated the sixtieth anniversary of the\r\nliberation of the Nazi concentration camps. May that\r\nreminder of the horrors of the Holocaust be a constant\r\nreminder for the international community that we\r\nshould no longer remain powerless and passive when\r\nfaced with genocide, ethnic cleansing, war crimes and\r\ncrimes against humanity.\r\nThat is why what we call the responsibility to\r\nprotect must become a concrete reality when the\r\nsituation calls for it.\r\nIn the same light, we should strengthen our\r\nmachinery for protecting human rights, given that\r\nhuman rights are the third pillar of United Nations\r\nactivities, along with development and security, which\r\nare in constant interaction.\r\nThe early establishment of a Human Rights\r\nCouncil, which we are preparing to create, should\r\nstrengthen United Nations activities in this sphere and\r\nallow for closer follow-up and more effective\r\nmonitoring of the status of human rights throughout the\r\nworld.\r\nThese topics, to which we should add other\r\nimportant topics such as, obviously, combating\r\nterrorism, the environment, sustainable development,\r\nand disarmament and non-proliferation, should be\r\ndebated and dealt with within a multilateral framework\r\nof legitimate and effective institutions supported by\r\nservices whose quality, objectiveness and probity are\r\nabove any suspicion.\r\n47\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\nThe reforms, already begun or planned, will, I am\r\nquite sure, help to achieve fully the goals that we all\r\nshare.\r\nGiven the ambitious goals that I have just stated,\r\nhave we really managed to move forward? Are we\r\nworthy of the heritage left by the founding fathers of\r\nthe United Nations? Of course, I would have preferred\r\nthat we were more capable of advancing agreement and\r\nof taking bolder decisions that would make us more\r\nimmediately operational, but that has proved\r\nimpossible.\r\nNonetheless, this High-level Plenary Meeting has\r\nagreed on certain orientations and taken decisions in\r\nprinciple that lay the groundwork for future progress.\r\nConcerning certain questions, precise mandates and\r\ndetailed schedules outline the steps to follow and to\r\nimplement those decisions quickly and with\r\ndetermination. The bases have been established. Now,\r\nwe must build so that the structure does not remain\r\nwithout a roof. Let us all make a firm and irreversible\r\ncommitment motivated by a true sense of urgency in\r\norder to finish this important task as of this General\r\nAssembly.\r\nAn American intellectual recently stated, Like\r\nfairies and paper money, the United Nations ceases to\r\nexist if people stop believing in it.\r\nThrough our vigorous activities sixty years after\r\nthe founding of the United Nations, we must show that\r\nwe continue to believe firmly in this Organization that\r\nwe share.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): I now give the\r\nfloor to His Excellency Lyonpo Khandu Wangchuk,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Bhutan.\r\nMr. Wangchuk (Bhutan): I bring the greetings\r\nand good wishes of our King, His Majesty Jigme\r\nSingye Wangchuk, to this meeting and to the United\r\nNations at its sixtieth anniversary year.\r\nAt the outset, I would like to convey Bhutans\r\nsympathy and solidarity with the United States in its\r\nefforts to recover from the ravages of Hurricane\r\nKatrina.\r\nWe would like to thank all those who worked\r\nmeticulously to prepare for this meeting. The people of\r\nthe world have high expectations from this gathering.\r\nThe outcome document that we will approve, while not\r\nmeeting all expectations, does contain important\r\nagreements that have to be implemented. This is\r\ncrucial if we are to deliver on our promises to our\r\npeople.\r\nIn the words of the Secretary-General, the\r\nhuman family will not enjoy security without\r\ndevelopment, will not enjoy development without\r\nsecurity, and will enjoy neither without respect for\r\nhuman rights (A/60/341, annex II). Today, more than\r\never before, we live in an interconnected and\r\ninterdependent world and face challenges and threats\r\nthat no nation can tackle alone. Therefore, global\r\naction to address the issues facing humanity is the need\r\nof our time. Collective action calls for an effective\r\nmultilateral system, with the United Nations at its core,\r\nto maintain international peace and security and\r\npromote international cooperation. Towards this end,\r\nwe must reform and strengthen the Organization and its\r\ninstitutions.\r\nGlobal action can sustain and become credible\r\nonly if we seriously follow up on our commitments and\r\nimplement the goals and objectives agreed upon at the\r\nMillennium Summit and other major United Nations\r\nconferences. Our community of 191 Member States is\r\nnot a homogenous one and, although the challenges are\r\nthe same, perceptions vary and the nature and scale of\r\nchallenges faced differ from country to country and\r\nregion to region. It is therefore important to ensure that\r\nwe approach all issues in a holistic and balanced\r\nmanner and that the principles and purposes of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter are respected and upheld at all\r\ntimes.\r\nAs noted by the Secretary-General in his report\r\n(A/60/81), the progress made by the least developed\r\ncountries (LDCs) is insufficient to achieve the goals of\r\nthe Brussels Programme of Action and the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). As the primary\r\nresponsibility for development rests on individual\r\ncountries, we must increase our own efforts to tackle\r\nproblems that impede development. At the same time,\r\nour development partners must scale up their\r\nassistance, provide full debt relief, assist and enhance\r\ntrade and facilitate technology transfer. We urge the\r\ndeveloped countries to fulfil their aid commitment of\r\n0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product and\r\nallocate 30 per cent of that assistance to the LDCs. We\r\ncommend those countries that have already reached or\r\nexceeded the 0.7 per cent target. Accelerated global\r\npartnership between the LDCs and the international\r\ncommunity is urgent as the General Assembly prepares\r\n48\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\nto undertake the mid-term review of the Brussels\r\nProgramme of Action next year.\r\nA recent United Nations report states that the\r\nrelatively poor performance of the Asia-Pacific LDCs\r\nis overshadowed by the fast growth of other countries\r\nin that region. It also reports that those LDCs receive\r\nless than half the average per capita aid given to LDCs\r\nin other regions. That is a matter of serious concern\r\nand we urge the international community to address the\r\nsituation faced by the 14 LDCs of the Asia-Pacific\r\nregion where 260 million people live.\r\nThe Royal Government of Bhutan is deeply\r\ncommitted to the Millennium Development Goals and\r\nhas assumed national ownership of our effort to\r\nachieve them. We are hopeful that, with the continued\r\nsupport of our development partners and the\r\ninternational community, we will be able to achieve\r\nmost of the Goals by 2015. Achievement of the Goals\r\nwill go a long way towards realizing our national\r\ndevelopment goal of increasing gross national\r\nhappiness.\r\nPermit me to briefly touch upon this development\r\nparadigm. For over two decades, Bhutans development\r\nprocess has been guided by the concept of gross\r\nnational happiness  a concept enunciated by His\r\nMajesty King Jigme Singye Wangchuk. It stems from\r\nthe belief that the ultimate goal of every human being\r\nis happiness and its attainment should be the purpose\r\nof development. We believe that the State should\r\npursue policies and strategies to address the holistic\r\nneeds of the human individual  both physical and\r\nspiritual  and thus create the conditions for achieving\r\nhappiness. Increasing gross domestic product enhances\r\nphysical comfort but on its own cannot promote overall\r\nwell-being. There are other elements that must be\r\naddressed, which we have determined to be the\r\nfollowing: conservation of the natural environment,\r\npreservation of culture and good governance. In our\r\nview, that is a more holistic and sustainable approach\r\nto development, which could perhaps provide some\r\nanswers to the many ills that afflict our societies. I call\r\nupon the international community to reflect on this.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): I call next on\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Kassymzhomart Kemelevich\r\nTokaev, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Kazakhstan.\r\nMr. Tokaev (Kazakhstan): This anniversary\r\nsummit is a milestone event in the history of the United\r\nNations. We are duty bound here to adopt decisions\r\ndesigned to radically improve the functioning of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nIn our view, United Nations reform should be\r\ngeared, first and foremost, towards the consolidation of\r\nthe international community in pursuit of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. Kazakhstan believes\r\nthat it is crucial to create the political and economic\r\nconditions needed to ensure the inseparability and\r\ncomplementarity of the three main pillars of the\r\nmodern world: development, freedom and peace. The\r\nUnited Nations should not tolerate such phenomena as\r\nmisery and poverty, the proliferation of weapons of\r\nmass destruction, the spread of dangerous diseases,\r\ndiscrimination and terrorism. Regrettably, none of\r\nthose human vices have been eradicated yet. To make\r\nthings even worse, threats to peace, security and\r\nhuman health have grown manifoldly.\r\nThat is why we should focus our efforts on\r\nenhancing the effectiveness of our Organization, a task\r\nthat is all the more important in view of serious lapses\r\nthat have occurred in the work of the United Nations.\r\nAs members of the community of nations, we should\r\nwork to improve the image of the United Nations as the\r\nbastion of peoples hopes and aspirations. The quality\r\nof decisions taken by the United Nations should be\r\nimproved, their implementation should be monitored\r\nmore closely and human resources management should\r\nbe enhanced. In that context, it is very important to\r\nstrengthen the functions of the United Nations\r\nSecretariat.\r\nKazakhstan believes that a greater role and a\r\nhigher status for the United Nations General Assembly\r\nas the main deliberative, decision-making and\r\nrepresentative body of our Organization would promote\r\ngenuine democracy in international relations.\r\nAs for the enlargement of the Security Council,\r\nwe believe that the issue should ultimately be resolved\r\non the basis of broad international agreement in\r\naccordance with the principle of equitable geographical\r\nrepresentation and taking into account the contribution\r\nof States concerned towards the development of the\r\nworld economy and regional and global security.\r\nPeacekeeping functions of the United Nations\r\nshould be enhanced. Moreover, our Organization\r\nshould not simply observe efforts to save victims of\r\nmajor natural and man-made disasters from the\r\nsidelines.\r\n49\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\nThe destiny of the United Nations is in our hands\r\nand that is why we should strive to promote mutual\r\nunderstanding, constructive approaches, responsibility\r\nand competence. Those are the principles that have\r\nalways guided Kazakhstans foreign policy.\r\nAs the first State in the world to voluntarily close\r\ndown its nuclear testing ground and give up its nuclear\r\narsenal, Kazakhstan is a committed and consistent\r\nchampion of an enhanced non-proliferation regime. We\r\nare deeply disturbed by the fact that, essentially, the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\n(NPT) is not working, as demonstrated by the outcome\r\nof the recent NPT Review Conference in New York.\r\nThere should be no room for double standards in our\r\napproach to the issue of non-proliferation of nuclear\r\nweapons, since any ambiguity in this matter may result\r\nin the spread of those deadly weapons, new conflicts\r\nand stand-offs, with the potential use of weapons of\r\nmass destruction.\r\nThe efforts being undertaken at the global level to\r\ncombat international terrorism are not sufficiently\r\neffective. The potential of the United Nations and\r\nrelevant regional organizations in addressing that most\r\ndangerous threat to humanity should be tapped to a\r\nfuller extent. It is our principled position that without\r\njoint efforts and effective practical action we will not\r\nbe able to win the war against international terrorism.\r\nKazakhstan has already come up with a proposal\r\nto set up a special body on regional organizations and\r\nwelcomes the establishment of a committee on the\r\nsubject.\r\nSpeaking about the reform of the United Nations,\r\nwe have to bear in mind that the world is becoming\r\nincreasingly more diverse. The problems that exist in\r\nCentral Asia are specific to that region and yet they are\r\nalso typical of the other parts of the world. Along with\r\nthe other countries in Central Asia, Kazakhstan is\r\nmaking every effort to address such pressing\r\nchallenges as international terrorism and religious\r\nextremism, illegal migration and the drug trade,\r\ntrafficking in human beings and shortages of water\r\nresources.\r\nDespite all the difficulties and challenges, over\r\nthe 60 years of its history, the United Nations has\r\nestablished itself in the international community as a\r\nuniversal organization for which there is no alternative.\r\nIn the final analysis, we are the United Nations, and we\r\nalone determine the future of this Organization.\r\nHaving firmly embarked on the path of social and\r\neconomic reform, Kazakhstan has emerged as one of\r\nthe most dynamically developing and successful States\r\nin the world. The Government of Kazakhstan has been\r\nimplementing a social programme, unprecedented in\r\nscope, to raise the standards of living in the country.\r\nAnd yet our efforts in this area have not been duly\r\nrecognized by the United Nations. We disagree with\r\nhow the United Nations experts calculate the human\r\ndevelopment index in our country. Such assessments,\r\nbased on uncorroborated sources and data, only serve\r\nto undermine the credibility of the United Nations in\r\nthe eyes of the international community and breed\r\nmistrust towards our Organization.\r\nMy country is a universally recognized leader in\r\nCentral Asia. The President of Kazakhstan is\r\nconfidently leading the country along the path of\r\neconomic progress and genuine democracy.\r\nKazakhstan cannot imagine a prosperous future for\r\nitself without close and active cooperation with the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): I call next on\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Youssouf Ouedraogo, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Burkina Faso.\r\nMr. Ouedraogo (Burkina Faso) (spoke in\r\nFrench): First, allow me to express to the President of\r\nthe United States of America, His Excellency\r\nMr. George W. Bush, and to the Government and the\r\npeople of America, the compassion and solidarity\r\nwhich Burkina Faso feels following the natural disaster\r\nin Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi caused by\r\nHurricane Katrina.\r\nThis session of the General Assembly is being\r\nheld at a time when we face two issues, the mid-term\r\nreview of the Millennium Development Goals and\r\nUnited Nations reform.\r\nI wish to congratulate the Secretary-General for\r\nhis vision, admirably laid out in the report In Larger\r\nFreedom (A/59/2005), which he has submitted to us. I\r\nwould like as well to pay well-deserved tribute to our\r\noutgoing president, Mr. Jean Ping, and through him, to\r\nhis country, Gabon, and to that countrys president, His\r\nExcellency El Hadj Omar Bongo Ondimba, for the\r\nhonour they have brought to Africa.\r\nBy adopting in 2000 the Millennium Declaration,\r\nthe leaders of the world pointed the way towards the\r\ncreation of a new world order that would be more just\r\n50\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\nand less stricken by poverty. Five years have now\r\npassed; it is time for a stocktaking. What sober\r\nconclusions can we draw? Despite a particularly\r\ndifficult international environment and subregional\r\ncontext, Burkina Faso has forced open the doors to\r\nprogress to achieve average economic growth of 6 per\r\ncent per year and has improved a considerable number\r\nof social indicators.\r\nThe stability of public institutions and good\r\neconomic governance have contributed in particular to\r\nthese results. While the impact of macroeconomic\r\nprogress has remained limited in terms of the general\r\nlevel of poverty, the implementation of the Strategic\r\nFramework to Combat Poverty drafted by our\r\nGovernment offers better prospects.\r\nIn the area of education, a strategic sector for\r\nsustainable development, the school population grew\r\nby 6.7 per cent on average between 1990 and 2004,\r\nwhile the gross school rate went from 30 per cent to\r\n57.6 per cent. But despite this positive trend, achieving\r\nuniversal schooling by 2015 will call for greater efforts\r\nand stronger initiatives, in particular in the area of\r\ninfrastructure and human resource development. In\r\naddition, considerable headway has been achieved in\r\nthe area of gender equality. By 2004, the ratio of girls\r\nto boys attained 0.77 in primary education and 0.67 in\r\nsecondary education.\r\nThe health situation has improved on the whole.\r\nThe overall rate of infant and child mortality dropped\r\n35 points between 1998 and 2003, and the maternal\r\nmortality rate dropped 82 points between 1993 and\r\n1998.\r\nIn the fight against HIV/AIDS, which is being\r\npersonally overseen by the head of State, considerable\r\nprogress has been achieved. According to UNAIDS\r\ndata from sentinel sites and the results of a population\r\nand health survey, the HIV/AIDS rate went from 7.17\r\nper cent in 1997 to 6.5 per cent in 2001, to 4.2 per cent\r\nin 2002 and finally to 1.9 per cent in 2003.\r\nOn the other hand, malaria is still an endemic\r\nillness. It is the main cause of death among children\r\nunder the age of five. The Government is working to\r\ninitiate programmes to combat this scourge, but, to be\r\nhonest, effectively combating malaria requires\r\nincreased mobilization on the part of the international\r\ncommunity, as is the case for AIDS.\r\nThe need for sustainable environmental\r\nmanagement has led us to elaborate and implement\r\nspecific programmes by subsector to speed up\r\nprotection of and rational use of natural resources. As\r\nfor access to better water sources, a priority objective,\r\nthe needs of the people are now 80 per cent taken care\r\nof. Continued efforts by the Government and its\r\npartners should eventually ensure drinking water for\r\nall.\r\nBurkina Faso has been selected as a candidate for\r\nfast-track implementation of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). We see this not only as\r\nan acknowledgement of our results, but especially of\r\nthe need to redouble efforts to meet this major\r\nchallenge.\r\nWe firmly believe that there is room for hope.\r\nTherefore the joint and coordinated action of the\r\nnations of the world must be pursued resolutely and be\r\nstrengthened to create everywhere an environment\r\nwhich will promote peacebuilding, security and\r\nprogress for all. Burkina Faso welcomes the decisions\r\ntaken to reduce the poor countries debt burden. We\r\nalso welcome the recent initiatives to combat hunger\r\nand poverty, to find new funding to finance\r\ndevelopment and to open industrialized countries\r\nmarkets to products from countries of the South. We\r\nhave a duty to respect fully the commitments we have\r\nundertaken together to the benefit of our respective\r\npeoples. We have the means to do so. Globalization has\r\nirrevocably linked our respective destinies and we have\r\nno choice but to succeed together.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): I call next on\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ghirmai Ghebremariam, Chairman\r\nof the delegation of Eritrea.\r\nMr. Ghebremariam (Eritrea): I deliver this\r\nstatement on behalf of the late Minister of Foreign\r\nAffairs of the State of Eritrea, His Excellency Mr. Ali\r\nSaid Abdella, who passed away on 28 August 2005.\r\nMr. Abdella had been designated to head the Eritrean\r\ndelegation to the General Assembly at its sixtieth\r\nsession, and would have loved to personally address\r\nthe Assembly. I would like to take this opportunity to\r\nthank, on behalf of the people and the Government of\r\nEritrea, all the countries that sent kind condolences.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration of 2000 embodied\r\nthe noble development goals that humanity aspired to\r\ncollectively achieve by 2015. However, five years after\r\nthe Declaration, it is becoming increasingly clear that,\r\n51\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\nin spite of significant progress made in many regions\r\nand countries, most low-income countries will not be\r\nable to meet the Millennium Development Goals\r\n(MDGs). The case of sub-Saharan Africa is of\r\nparticular and immediate concern. Almost all the\r\ncountries of that region are off track, and the prospects\r\nof achieving most  let alone all  of the Goals by\r\n2015 are remote.\r\nIf the commitments to the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals are to be taken seriously and\r\ncountries are to have a realistic prospect of meeting the\r\ntargets, there are two crucial factors that have to be\r\nmet. First, while pro-poor policy reforms by the\r\nrecipient countries are necessary conditions for\r\nmeeting the Millennium Goals, developed countries\r\nshould turn pledges and promises into concrete action\r\nby providing the financing needed for achieving them.\r\nSecondly, development assistance is more effective\r\nwhen recipients own the development process.\r\nNational policies and programmes to promote poverty\r\nreduction and achieve development goals should be\r\nformulated by a broad group of stakeholders within a\r\ncountry.\r\nAt independence, the new Eritrean Government\r\ninherited a devastated economy and infrastructure,\r\nineffective institutions, a large exiled population and\r\nan empty treasury. Yet by mid-1991, the de facto\r\nindependence year, the Government was able to take\r\neffective steps to reconstruct the economy by, inter\r\nalia, establishing the regulatory and institutional\r\nframework and investing in infrastructure, including\r\nschool and health systems, water and sanitation\r\nfacilities and roads. The private sector responded to the\r\nfavourable investment climate by investing in services,\r\nconstruction and other resource-based industries. As a\r\nresult, Eritrea embarked on a promising journey of\r\neconomic progress and, during the period 1992-1997,\r\nthe Eritrean economy registered an impressive growth\r\nrate of 7.4 per cent.\r\nUnfortunately, Eritreas promising start was to be\r\ndisrupted by the outbreak of a border conflict with\r\nEthiopia in May 1998, which quickly escalated into\r\nwar. During the period 1998-2000, Eritrea also suffered\r\nits worst drought in many years. Following the signing\r\nof the Algiers Peace Agreement in 2000, the\r\nGovernment of Eritrea embarked on an economic\r\nrecovery and reintegration programme. Eritreans had\r\nhoped for a speedy border demarcation based on the\r\nruling of the Boundary Commission. Unfortunately, we\r\nhave not been able to fully turn our attention and\r\nresources to tackling the most pressing development\r\nchallenges because of Ethiopias refusal to abide by the\r\nfinal and binding decision of the Eritrea-Ethiopia\r\nBoundary Commission, which was sanctioned and\r\nguaranteed by the United Nations, and because of the\r\nrefusal of the Security Council to fulfil the legal\r\nobligations of the United Nations.\r\nLet me turn now to the Millennium targets.\r\nNotwithstanding the obstacles to which I have referred,\r\nI am happy to report that Eritrea is projected to achieve\r\neight of the 10 targets by 2015. We realize, however,\r\nthat that is no cause for celebration, for three reasons.\r\nFirst, Eritrea is off track in two crucial areas, namely\r\nthe eradication of extreme poverty and the achievement\r\nof universal primary education. Secondly, the\r\nMillennium Goals, even if they were to be fully\r\nachieved, represent only the minimum benchmarks for\r\ndevelopment. Thirdly, Eritreas road map to 2015 was\r\nprepared on the basis of some crucial assumptions\r\nincluding the resolution of the no-war no-peace\r\nsituation and the return to normal rainfall.\r\nWe believe that Eritreas MDG status shows that,\r\neven with modest resources, countries can go a long\r\nway in achieving the Goals if they have the right\r\npolicies and strong Government commitment.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to assure the\r\nAssembly that Eritrea will, as in the past, continue to\r\ntake the necessary steps and make sacrifices to achieve\r\nthe Millennium Goals. In that endeavour, we seek the\r\ncommitment of our development partners in providing\r\nadequate finances to meet those goals. Even more\r\nimportant, I call upon the international community to\r\nenforce the Boundary Commissions decision on the\r\nEritrea-Ethiopia border, if only because peace and\r\nstability have a crucial bearing on the achievement of\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): I would like to\r\noffer condolences to the delegation of Eritrea, on my\r\nown behalf and on behalf of all delegations, on the loss\r\nof Mr. Ali Said Abdella, Foreign Minister of Eritrea.\r\nBefore adjourning the meeting, I would like to\r\ninform representatives that tomorrow we will have to\r\nenforce stricter discipline when it comes to the length\r\nof statements. We gained some leeway today since we\r\nworked through lunch and late into the evening  I am\r\nsure that some representatives will have missed other\r\nevents. But tomorrow we have further business to do.\r\n52\r\nA/60/PV.6\r\nWe will hear reports from the round tables, and the\r\ndraft outcome document is to be adopted. We therefore\r\nneed to stick to the five-minute limit. Perhaps those\r\nwho are here today will spread the word to those who\r\nare not present that tomorrow we must work faster.\r\nOtherwise, we will have to sacrifice the whole of our\r\nlunch break tomorrow.\r\nI would like to thank representatives for their\r\ngreat patience and for having made this meeting such\r\nan important one.\r\nThe meeting rose at 9 p.m.\r\n"
