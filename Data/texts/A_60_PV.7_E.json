Corrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\r\n05-51185 (E)\r\n*0551185*\r\nCo-Chairperson: El Hadj Omar Bongo Ondimba . . . . . . . . . . . . . (President of the Gabonese Republic)\r\nCo-Chairperson: Mr. Göran Persson . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Sweden)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 9.10 a.m.\r\nOrganization of work\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): Before giving the floor to the first speaker, I\r\nshould like to draw the attention of members to a draft\r\nresolution, which has been issued as document\r\nA/60/L.1, entitled 2005 World Summit Outcome.\r\nMembers also have the correct version of paragraph\r\n60 (a) in English only; the correct version will appear\r\nin the other official languages in the final document.\r\nWith regard to document A/60/L.1, I should also like to\r\ndraw the attention of members to a statement submitted\r\nby the Secretary-General in accordance with rule 153\r\nof the rules of procedure of the General Assembly,\r\nissued as document A/60/355. Those two documents\r\nhave been circulated to delegations this morning and\r\nhave been distributed in the Hall.\r\nAddresses on the occasion of the High-level Plenary\r\nMeeting (continued)\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): I should like to\r\ndraw the attention of members to the fact that the\r\nmeetings of the General Assembly for the past two\r\ndays have extended far beyond the scheduled time. As\r\nmembers are aware, for this mornings meeting we\r\nhave 40 speakers inscribed on the list and for the\r\nafternoon meeting we have 44 speakers. Also, during\r\nthe afternoon meeting, the Chairpersons of the four\r\nround-table sessions will present orally the summaries\r\nof their respective round-table sessions. Thereafter, the\r\nGeneral Assembly will take action on draft resolution\r\nA/60/L.1.\r\nIn order for us to conclude our work at a\r\nreasonable hour, I do not see any other alternative than\r\nto ask members to honour the agreed-upon time limit\r\nof five minutes per statement. Yesterday, several\r\nspeakers presented abbreviated versions of their\r\nsometimes-long written statements. That is certainly a\r\nmethod of work that we would encourage. In order to\r\nhelp speakers facilitate our work, we shall remind them\r\nafter five minutes have elapsed that they have exceeded\r\nthe time limit. We hope that the statements will then be\r\nconcluded promptly. I thank members for their\r\ncooperation, which is in the interests in concluding this\r\nmeeting at a reasonable hour. Such cooperation is\r\nhighly essential for the success of this High-level\r\nPlenary Meeting.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): The Assembly will now hear an address by\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Nicanor Duarte Frutos, President\r\nof the Republic of Paraguay.\r\nPresident Duarte Frutos (spoke in Spanish): At\r\nthe outset, I congratulate the Co-Chairpersons on their\r\nwell-deserved election. Their outstanding records\r\nguarantee the excellent guidance of this summit, which\r\nParaguay hopes will produce results that enable us to\r\nmake significant progress towards the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\n2\r\nA/60/PV.7\r\nToday, more than ever before, we need effective\r\naction that will reduce the inequalities of development\r\nand lead to greater investment by more developed\r\nnations. Our peoples, with emerging economies, do not\r\nneed charity, but solidarity. Our peoples do not need\r\ngracious concessions, but equitable distribution of the\r\nwealth that everyone in the world produces.\r\nA central policy of my Government is to focus on\r\nthe social sectors where there is poverty and need. If\r\nwe are to move forward and overcome the precarious\r\nsituation of much of our population, we must have the\r\ncapacity to act, political leaders who are able to fight\r\ncorruption and judges who have the courage to apply\r\nthe law and impose justice. Likewise, we know that our\r\ndevelopment also depends on businesspeople who are\r\nprepared to leave the informal sector in order to\r\nincrease competitiveness and generate jobs to reduce\r\npoverty. But we also need to say in this forum that the\r\nprotectionism of rich countries is like a vice that,\r\ntragically, is strangling our peoples.\r\nIt will be difficult to reduce world poverty while\r\nthe wicked concentration of wealth continues. There\r\nmust be a new world order that gives everyone a\r\nchance to participate and thus contributes to the\r\nuniversalization of human dignity. The unilateral flow\r\nof profits to the developed countries, to the detriment\r\nof less fortunate countries, is not only unjust but a real\r\nthreat to world peace. The multidirectional allocation\r\nof resources to all nations is the real way to fund\r\ndemocracy.\r\nThat is why, the Paraguayan Government is\r\nstriving to fight poverty. When the Government came\r\nto power in 2003, the extreme poverty rate was 20.1\r\nper cent. In 2004, we were able to bring it down to 17.1\r\nper cent. In 2002, the total poverty rate in my country\r\nwas 46.4 per cent because of decades of neglect.\r\nToday, according to the most recent data, we have\r\nmanaged to reduce the total poverty rate from 46.4 per\r\ncent in 2002 to 39.2 per cent. From 2003  when our\r\nGovernment came to power  to 2004, our growth rate\r\nwas 7.8 per cent according to the updated information\r\nof the Central Bank of Paraguay.\r\nWe hope that the United Nations will regain its\r\ncoordinating role and put an end to the grave\r\ninequalities and injustices that afflict the planet. It is\r\npainful to see that priority continues to be given to the\r\ninterests of those who have more, that the promises\r\nmade to the Organization by the richest nations are not\r\nbeing kept and that the United Nations is becoming a\r\nbureaucracy incapable of creating standards which\r\neveryone conforms to, so that the abuses of\r\nglobalization do not end up causing a new world war.\r\nWhile fundamentalist terrorism causes anxiety\r\nand pain in those regions and in other regions with\r\nclose historical ties to us, the true threats to fragile\r\ndemocracies, freedom and peace in Latin America are\r\nthe refusal to give our products access to the major\r\nmarkets of the so-called first world, our exclusion from\r\nthe bodies where major decisions are taken and the\r\ndestruction of the ability of nation States to take action.\r\nIt is precisely in order to improve the distribution of\r\nincome that we are promoting the implementation of a\r\nnational strategy to combat poverty and inequality.\r\nIn the field of education, Paraguay has\r\nsignificantly reduced illiteracy and increased school\r\nenrolment, and will continue to reduce the deficit in\r\nand improve the quality of basic and primary\r\neducation. That Millennium Development Goal can be\r\nfulfilled by 2015. Today, illiteracy in Paraguay stands\r\nat 6.4 per cent, and my Governments objective is to\r\nobtain the United Nations Educational, Scientific and\r\nCultural Organizations certification of zero illiteracy\r\nin Paraguay by 2008. There has been an exponential\r\ngrowth in secondary, higher and university education.\r\nGender parity in access to and duration of education\r\nhas also been achieved at all levels.\r\nSimilarly, in recent years we have seen the\r\ngrowing participation of women in the development\r\nprocess and the strengthening of the legal system that\r\nprotects their rights. We are fighting violence against\r\nwomen and human trafficking, and raising awareness\r\nof those problems. Womens participation in the three\r\nbranches of Government has increased via the\r\nnomination of women ministers, the election of women\r\nparliamentarians and the appointment of women judges\r\nand of women in other Government bodies.\r\nThe reform of the health system stagnated in\r\nrecent years, but has now been reactivated by my\r\nGovernment through the strengthening of public\r\npolicies to improve basic health indicators, as reflected\r\nin the latest United Nations Human Development\r\nReport. We have done a great deal to reduce the levels\r\nof infant and maternal mortality, malnutrition and\r\nendemic diseases, and have been deeply involved in\r\nthe fight against HIV/AIDS. We are working generally\r\nto ensure the accuracy of registries and statistics and\r\n3\r\nA/60/PV.7\r\nthe application of greater human and technical\r\nresources in the health field. The Government will\r\ncontinue to implement all its programmes in order to\r\nfurther progress towards the goals that we have set\r\nourselves.\r\nThe Government of Paraguay has incorporated\r\nthe principles of sustainable development into national\r\nand sectoral policies, programmes and projects, which\r\nhave reversed the deterioration of the environment.\r\nWith the creation of an environmental secretariat and\r\nthe cooperation of local Governments and civil society,\r\nwe have successfully implemented environmental\r\nprogrammes, although we have a great deal more to do\r\nin that sector. This year, we approved a national\r\nenvironmental policy focused on the conservation and\r\nappropriate usage of our natural and cultural heritage\r\nso as to guarantee the sustainability of development,\r\nthe fair distribution of profits, environmental justice\r\nand the quality of life of present and future\r\ngenerations.\r\nWe still face the task of bridging the gaps in the\r\nprovision of housing, water and basic sanitation, which\r\nhave a negative impact on our people through\r\novercrowding and the contamination of soil, food and\r\nwater. Pursuant to the goals it has established, the\r\nGovernment is upgrading city neighbourhoods and\r\nsettlements.\r\nWe believe that, if we are to meet the\r\ndevelopment partnership Goal, a fair and equitable\r\ntrade regime is of the highest importance to the\r\ndevelopment of our countries in Latin America. To that\r\nend, we reject any attempt to perpetuate the\r\nprotectionist measures of the developed world, in\r\nparticular subsidies for the production and export of\r\nagricultural products, as well as the use of technical\r\nregulations as barriers to manufactured products.\r\nTechnological progress should be at the service of\r\nhumankind, but it is hindered by the digital divide,\r\nwherein 80 per cent of Internet users are concentrated\r\nin the developed countries while half the people on the\r\nplanet have not yet had the experience of making a\r\ntelephone call. That pathetic contrast will inevitably\r\nlead to even greater inequality, because it will widen\r\nthe existing disparities. In light of such circumstances,\r\nwe need a new approach to managing research and\r\npromoting technology and innovation so as to set the\r\nstage for a new development model with a human face,\r\nbased on intelligence, knowledge and the historic\r\nconscience of our citizens.\r\nParaguay calls for national and international\r\nplayers to combine their efforts to create fair social\r\ndevelopment within a model of democratic\r\ncoexistence. We will continue to struggle to that end,\r\nand hope soon to submit a report that will reflect even\r\ngreater progress towards the well-being and prosperity\r\nof our people, because freedom and justice can be\r\nconsolidated only in an environment of development\r\nfor all.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): The Assembly will now hear an address by\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Kurmanbek Bakiev, President of\r\nthe Kyrgyz Republic.\r\nPresident Bakiev (spoke in Russian): The\r\npresent summit is taking place during the sixtieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations, a milestone not only\r\nfor the further destiny of the Organization, but also for\r\nthe entire world community and the entire system of\r\ninternational relations. This forum gives us a rare\r\nopportunity to find collective answers and to develop\r\njoint approaches to such contemporary global issues\r\nand threats as poverty, hunger, disease, international\r\nterrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction.\r\nWhile giving due credit to the foresight of the\r\nOrganizations founders, we should note that the\r\nactivities of the United Nations can and should be\r\nfurther advanced in light of modern realities and the\r\nprospects for world development.\r\nToday, the peoples of our countries justifiably\r\nexpect from all of us the adoption of measures for the\r\nfurther transformation of the United Nations into an\r\neffective tool for addressing the problems of the new\r\nmillennium. In that regard, Kyrgyzstan supports the\r\nneed to reform the General Assembly and to strengthen\r\nthe coordinating functions of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil. We also support the expansion of the Security\r\nCouncil and its geographical representativity, and the\r\nenhancement of its efficiency.\r\nThe Kyrgyz Republic confirms its full and\r\ncomprehensive adherence to the universal goals and\r\nobjectives reflected in the Millennium Declaration. The\r\nnational mid-term programme of action now drafted in\r\nKyrgyzstan will be closely connected to the\r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\n4\r\nA/60/PV.7\r\nWe intend to ensure through the programme the\r\nstrengthening of democratic government and economic\r\ngrowth in our country. We believe that it will help to\r\nresolve our outstanding social and economic problems,\r\nincluding overcoming poverty and corruption,\r\nimproving the standard of living and creating\r\nconditions for comprehensive human development.\r\nThat being said, a high level of external debt is\r\none of the barriers impeding efforts towards\r\nsustainable development in our Republic, where 94 per\r\ncent of the territory is mountainous. The enormous\r\nexternal debt  the repayment of which requires a\r\nhuge outlay  is preventing us from providing our\r\nregions with due support for development. Kyrgyzstan\r\nsupports the view that an acceptable debt level needs to\r\nbe defined and that measures are urgently required to\r\nlighten the debt burden for developing countries. The\r\npositive decisions of the Paris Club to reduce the\r\nexternal debt of the country will be an important factor\r\nin the further social and economic development of\r\nKyrgyzstan, and in the long term will help our country\r\nto achieve the Millennium Development Goals. In our\r\nopinion, the world community should consider the\r\nquestion of additional support to mountainous\r\ndeveloping countries for the realization of sustainable\r\ndevelopment goals.\r\nThis year  2005  is exceptionally important\r\nfor Kyrgyzstan and will forever have a place in its\r\ncenturies-old history. On 24 March, our people\r\nresolutely pronounced their commitment to a\r\ndemocratic path to development and the noble ideals of\r\nfreedom. The new leadership of the Kyrgyz Republic\r\nintends to make every possible effort to bridge the gap\r\nbetween the people and the State. The future certainly\r\nbelongs to them. We want the world to see the positive\r\neffects of the changes in Kyrgyzstan and call on the\r\ninternational community to give active support and to\r\nhelp our people so that they can resolve the problems\r\nof sustainable development.\r\nSince the early 1990s, our country has travelled a\r\ntortuous path. For some of the people of Kyrgyzstan\r\nmany of the difficulties and trials are already behind\r\nthem. Despite all the complexities of the transition\r\nperiod, our people have learned a great deal, gaining a\r\nsense of freedom and democracy and laying the\r\nfoundations for a market economy, applying advanced\r\neconomic formulas and drawing on international\r\nexperience.\r\nProtecting the fundamental principles of freedom\r\nand democracy in the Kyrgyz Republic, we have laid\r\ndown a broad basis for the development of a civil\r\nsociety. I firmly believe that the country cannot be\r\nrenewed without the participation of the people. We are\r\ndeeply convinced that civil society should be the\r\npartner of Government and that human rights are a\r\nfundamental value of society.\r\nSince the March revolution, civil society has\r\nclearly called on the Government to ensure\r\ntransparency and dismantle corruption. In our\r\nuncompromising struggle against corruption we are\r\ncommitted to using the internationally accepted\r\nmechanisms. We have already taken the first steps. In\r\nJune this year the Kyrgyz Parliament ratified the\r\nUnited Nations Convention against Corruption. A State\r\nstrategy to combat corruption is being developed in the\r\nform of a plan of action, and active steps are being\r\ntaken to set up a nationwide anti-corruption body. We\r\nare firmly committed to the eradication of corruption in\r\neach and every cell of the body of society, from its\r\noutlying villages to its highest State institutions.\r\nProtection of human rights, the observance of\r\ndemocratic principles in practice and not just in words,\r\nis one of the priorities for our new Kyrgyzstan. We\r\nconsider that the sustained and effective protection of\r\nhuman rights is an important precondition for the\r\nmaintenance of world stability and prosperity, in each\r\ncountry individually, as well as at the global level.\r\nFor the Kyrgyz Republic it is a great honour to be\r\npart of the community of free nations that recently\r\nestablished the United Nations Democracy Fund in\r\nNew York. We entirely support the creation of the Fund\r\nand we trust that it will serve to give a powerful\r\nimpetus to the promotion of democracy in many\r\ncountries of the world.\r\nThe Kyrgyz Republics firm adherence to its\r\ninternational obligations regarding fundamental human\r\nrights, freedom of speech, assembly and the press, the\r\nrule of law and democracy, including the rights of\r\nrefugees, has already been demonstrated through its\r\nconcrete actions.\r\nIn that connection, the people of Kyrgyzstan have\r\nthe right to hope that they will not be left to deal\r\nunaided with their own problems, but that the United\r\nNations, other international organizations and donor\r\ncountries will give due support to Kyrgyzstan to help it\r\n5\r\nA/60/PV.7\r\nrealize its noble aspirations to freedom, democracy and\r\nto development.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to express the hope\r\nthat this forum will be an important step towards the\r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nThe Kyrgyz Republic, for its part, is ready to do its\r\nutmost to contribute to the prompt implementation of\r\nthe lofty principles of peace, stability and development\r\nenshrined in the Millennium Declaration.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): The Assembly will now hear an address by\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Indonesia.\r\nPresident Yudhoyono: I come here to speak for\r\n220 million Indonesians as their first directly elected\r\nPresident. I also carry the message of 4.6 billion people\r\nof Asia and Africa represented in the New Asian-\r\nAfrican Strategic Partnership formed in Jakarta last\r\nApril. I wish to convey to you the commitment of the\r\nAsia-Pacific region, embodied in the Jakarta\r\nDeclaration, to achieve the Millennium Development\r\nGoals. For them, I intend to speak of security,\r\ndevelopment, human rights and United Nations reform.\r\nWhen I say development, I mean the challenge of\r\npoverty. Poverty is a killer. Eight million human\r\nbeings  most of them in Asia and Africa  die every\r\nyear because they are too poor to live. To stop this\r\nkiller we must attain the Millennium Development\r\nGoals. We must form a global partnership for\r\ndevelopment. We must faithfully respond to the\r\noutcomes of major United Nations conferences on\r\ndevelopment. There must be a flow of financing for\r\ndevelopment. Exports from developing countries must\r\nhave access to markets in a rules-based international\r\ntrading system.\r\nThe developing countries must achieve good\r\ngovernance, fight corruption, make efficient use of\r\ntheir limited resources, and plan and carry out\r\nappropriate development strategies. For their part,\r\ndeveloped countries must fulfil their commitment to a\r\ngenuine and mutually beneficial global partnership for\r\ndevelopment.\r\nAs to global security, we need a reformed\r\nSecurity Council with a membership that reflects\r\nglobal realities. The Asia-Pacific region, home to more\r\nthan half of the human race and cradle of ancient\r\ncivilizations and religions, should have more seats on\r\nthe Council. New permanent members should be\r\nchosen on the basis of a set of appropriate criteria. We\r\nmust also do away with the right of veto, which often\r\nparalyses the Council.\r\nWe need a disarmament and non-proliferation\r\nregime that leads to the elimination of weapons of\r\nmass destruction. But we must encourage the peaceful\r\nuse of nuclear energy for development.\r\nWe need a Peacebuilding Commission that works\r\nin coordination with both the Security Council and the\r\nEconomic and Social Council and under the mandate of\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nWe need consensus on the responsibility to\r\nprotect people from genocide, ethnic cleansing and\r\ncrimes against humanity. To this end, force should be\r\nused only when all other means have failed.\r\nIn the fight against terrorism, we must develop\r\neffective international cooperation to deal with this\r\nthreat. No human right may be sacrificed. We must find\r\nand deal with the root causes of terrorism.\r\nWe in Indonesia believe that interfaith dialogue\r\nand empowering the moderates can reduce violent\r\nradicalism.\r\nWe need to empower the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil so that it can effectively review and coordinate\r\ninternational cooperation in development.\r\nThe projected Human Rights Council should be a\r\nsubsidiary body of the General Assembly. It must be\r\nfree of politicization and double standards.\r\nNo effort at United Nations reform is complete\r\nunless it affirms and brings into reality the central role\r\nof the General Assembly as the main body of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nIndonesia will continue to support any efforts to\r\nstrengthen and revitalize the effectiveness of the\r\nUnited Nations in facing new challenges. In this\r\nregard, Indonesia urges that the United Nations reform\r\nshould be made in a comprehensive, step-by-step and\r\nsustainable manner. Basically, reforming the United\r\nNations is no different from reforming a nation. It is all\r\nabout working for democracy so that democracy will\r\nwork for us. In the process, change must be as\r\ndemocratic as possible. We are experiencing this in\r\nIndonesia. We face many challenges, but we are\r\ngrateful that reforms and democratization are working.\r\nWe are reconstructing our economy. We are creating\r\n6\r\nA/60/PV.7\r\njobs to reduce the number of our poor. Committed to\r\ngood governance, we are winning the fight against\r\nterrorism. We are building the peace in Aceh.\r\nIf we succeed in reforming ourselves and in\r\nattaining democracy and good governance as\r\nindividual nations and as an international Organization,\r\nthe world will change; but, in order to achieve a world\r\nof peace, justice and equitable prosperity and a\r\nreformed United Nations, we must have the will and\r\nthe spirit, the necessary consensus and the commitment\r\nto work together.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): The General Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Vladimir Voronin,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Moldova.\r\nPresident Voronin (spoke in Moldovan; English\r\ntext provided by the delegation): The report of the\r\nSecretary-General entitled In larger freedom\r\n(A/59/2005), and the report of the High-level Panel on\r\nThreats, Challenges and Change (A/59/565) not only\r\ndescribe with accuracy the threats and challenges that\r\nexist today in the area of peace, security, development\r\nand human rights, but also show the right direction and\r\nmeasures that need to be undertaken in order to address\r\nthem. These actions are meant to confer a new\r\ndynamism to the process of implementing the\r\nMillennium Declaration, including the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), a process that has been\r\nadversely affected by the complexity of the\r\ninternational climate following 11 September 2001.\r\nAlong with other Member States, the Republic of\r\nMoldova believes that these new circumstances require\r\nthat we revitalize the consensus on major challenges\r\nand priorities and convert this new consensus into\r\ncollective action that could lead, inter alia, to the\r\nrenewal and strengthening of the United Nations\r\nsystem.\r\nIn this regard, I deem it very important to declare\r\nat this Summit my countrys continuing commitment to\r\nthe United Nations and to pledge our firm support to\r\nthe Organization and to the draft outcome document\r\nthat we shall be adopting. The Republic of Moldova\r\nsupports the adoption of the necessary decisions by the\r\nMember States, including those to be adopted within\r\nthe framework of this meeting, that will lead to the\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly, the reform and\r\nexpansion of the Security Council, an increase in the\r\neffectiveness of the Economic and Social Council and\r\nthe United Nations Secretariat and the creation of a\r\nHuman Rights Council and a Peacebuilding\r\nCommission. We also favour the elimination of certain\r\nobsolete references in the United Nations Charter\r\nregarding the Trusteeship Council and enemy States.\r\nAs a country facing the difficulties of transition\r\nand still affected by the consequences of an unsettled\r\ninternal conflict, which has been inspired and\r\nsupported from abroad, the Republic of Moldova is\r\ndeeply interested in promoting, at the national level,\r\nthe values that form the foundation of the\r\naforementioned documents. I wish to emphasize, in\r\nthis context, that unless the factors of external\r\npressure, including the foreign military presence are\r\nremoved, unless Transnistria is democratized and\r\ndemilitarized and unless the State borders on the\r\nperimeter of this area are controlled, it will be\r\nimpossible to settle the conflict, to stop the illegal\r\ntrafficking of arms, drugs and human beings and to\r\nprovide stability and security for this part of the\r\nEuropean continent.\r\nWe will also continue to work vigorously to\r\nfurther develop the rule of law and democracy and to\r\nensure a maximum level of protection of human rights\r\nthroughout the territory of the Republic of Moldova, so\r\nthat our citizens in the area controlled by the\r\ntotalitarian separatist regime from Tiraspol can also\r\nenjoy them.\r\nLikewise, we pledge to make all efforts to ensure\r\nsustained economic development, to increase the\r\nwelfare of our citizens and to improve socio-economic\r\nindicators, including the achievement of the MDGs.\r\nThese specific priorities are complementary to those\r\nrelated to European integration, which has become an\r\nirreversible strategic objective of our internal and\r\nexternal policies.\r\nFrom this perspective, we hope that our efforts\r\nwill be supported more actively by the international\r\ncommunity in the spirit of the global partnership that\r\nwe are trying to reaffirm at this summit.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to join previous speakers\r\nwho have appealed for the renewal of commitments\r\nand for concrete actions. This is the only way to move\r\non towards a world of liberty, prosperity, justice and\r\npeace. It is precisely this collective vision that is\r\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter and in support\r\nof which the Republic of Moldova continues to remain\r\n7\r\nA/60/PV.7\r\na faithful and committed member of the world\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): The General Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Majesty King Abdullah Bin Al Hussein,\r\nKing of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.\r\nKing Abdullah Bin Al Hussein: Five years ago,\r\nthe worlds leaders met here to declare a new vision for\r\na new age. The Millennium Summit was a response to\r\na global moral consensus; our world can no longer\r\ndeny the basics of life and peace to billions of people.\r\nFive years later, it is clear that we acted not a\r\nmoment too soon. Humanity has seen the dangers of a\r\nglobal system that excludes people, especially youth,\r\nfrom opportunity and hope. Now, the people of the\r\nworld are looking to us to bring our nations together, to\r\nact with urgency and to achieve results.\r\nI am honoured to report that Jordan is on track to\r\nachieve the majority of its Millennium development\r\ntargets. The challenges are real, and there is much to be\r\ndone. But gains are being made in poverty reduction,\r\nhealth, education, gender equality, the environment and\r\nmore. This effort is only part of Jordans much larger\r\nnational strategy  a comprehensive, inclusive\r\napproach to reform and development.\r\nYet, we do not act in a vacuum. Our country, our\r\nregion and the world are all affected by the prospects\r\nfor peace. One critical step is to ensure zero tolerance\r\ntowards those who promote extremism. Jordan has\r\nworked with the international Muslim community to\r\noppose extremist interpretations of Islam. Jordan wants\r\ntrue, moderate, traditional Islam to replace\r\nfundamentalist, radical and militant Islam everywhere\r\nin the world for every single Muslim.\r\nIn November 2004, we issued the Amman\r\nMessage, which sought to clarify the true nature of\r\nIslam: what it is and what it is not. Then last July, over\r\n180 scholars met in Amman. They represented 45\r\ncountries and were supported by fatwas from 17 of the\r\nworlds greatest Islamic scholars. Together, they\r\nachieved for the first time in history a unanimous\r\nconsensus on a number of critical issues.\r\nFirst, the declaration they issued recognized the\r\nlegitimacy and common principles of all eight of the\r\ntraditional schools of Islamic religious law.\r\nSecondly, it defined the necessary qualifications\r\nand conditions for issuing fatwas. This exposes the\r\nillegitimacy of the extremist fatwas justifying\r\nterrorism, which contravene the traditional schools of\r\nIslamic religious law and are in clear violation of\r\nIslams core principles.\r\nThirdly, the declaration condemned the practice\r\nknown as takfir (calling others apostates)  a practice\r\nthat is used by extremists to justify violence against\r\nthose who do not agree with them.\r\nEven as we work for peace, development must go\r\nforward. Important in this effort is Millennium Goal 8:\r\ninternational partnership.\r\nWhen developed nations commit to active,\r\nincreased development support, they advance global\r\nprogress for all. The world knows what is needed: fair\r\ntrade, increased direct assistance and debt relief. The\r\nrecent G8 agreement on debt relief for the poorest\r\nnations was a positive step. The European Union has\r\nput forward a calendar on increased assistance. We\r\nneed to continue and expand such efforts.\r\nThis is particularly important with regard to the\r\nkey group of lower-middle-income and middle-income\r\ncountries. Our countries have a major role in regional\r\nand global stability. Many of us have been forging\r\nahead with reforms at full steam and are on the verge\r\nof reaching higher levels of income. That success can\r\ntranslate into real development gains, only if it is\r\nnourished and sustained. A group of determined\r\nleaders, mostly from middle-income countries, are\r\ndiscussing shared concerns: free and fair trade, targeted\r\naid and more. We have agreed to continue our\r\ndiscussions on ways to reach accord with the\r\ndeveloped nations.\r\nThis world summit recognizes that our globe is\r\none of shared dependence and shared opportunity. We\r\nhave a strategic and also a moral mission. It is now in\r\nour hands to prove to the worlds people, especially our\r\nyouth, that our international institutions work and that\r\nglobal justice is real.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): The General Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Martín Torrijos,\r\nPresident of Panama.\r\nPresident Torrijos (spoke in Spanish): Panama\r\nhas a clear, unequivocal and compelling commitment\r\nto fulfilling the Millennium Development Goals. Ours\r\n8\r\nA/60/PV.7\r\nis not a statement of rhetoric or mere protocol. We\r\nhave adopted the goals, targets and indicators as a\r\nreference framework for drawing up our public\r\npolicies. We have made them mandatory, and we are\r\ndetermined to fulfil them as vigorously as we would an\r\ninternational treaty.\r\nWe are making a great effort to eradicate poverty\r\nand hunger, focusing on less fortunate populations,\r\ncreating redistributive polices through comprehensive\r\ntax reform and transferring direct and indirect\r\nresources to populations that have been marginalized\r\nfrom development for decade after decade.\r\nPoverty does not affect just poor people. Poverty\r\nholds back the development of a whole country.\r\nPoverty prevents us from moving forward as an\r\nintegrated society that shares the same aspirations and\r\nenjoys the same opportunities for achieving them.\r\nWe are close to achieving universal primary\r\neducation. Our aim is to provide high-quality education\r\nfor all, with relevant content, and to expand pre-school\r\neducation.\r\nWe have made progress, although still\r\ninsufficient, in reducing infant mortality and are fully\r\nconfident that we shall be able to reduce maternal\r\nmortality since, for the first time in the history of\r\nPanama, we have established universal and free\r\ncoverage for all prenatal care and hospital deliveries.\r\nWe have a real challenge fighting HIV/AIDS, and\r\nwe recognize the need to be innovative and more\r\ncreative in promoting effective prevention and in\r\nraising the awareness of populations at risk,\r\nparticularly women and young people.\r\nPanama, for its part, has heavily stressed building\r\na society without exclusion, where those with\r\ndisabilities can feel that they are participating in their\r\nown development instead of feeling discriminated\r\nagainst and can fully enjoy the fundamental human\r\nrights.\r\nPanama welcomes the fact that the United\r\nNations has set measurable and quantifiable goals in\r\norder to evaluate country-by-country progress towards\r\nachieving the Millennium Goals within a broader\r\nconcept of freedom.\r\nWe fully share, and this is a key part of the\r\nGovernments programme, the conviction that without\r\nsecurity there can be no development and that security\r\nand development can only be maintained when human\r\nrights are fully in effect.\r\nPanama has supported the High-level Meetings\r\ndraft outcome document (A/60/L.1), not because it is\r\nin full agreement with it but because it understands that\r\nthe document is the beginning of a process of reform.\r\nIn particular, I consider its approach on legal and\r\nillegal trafficking of small arms and light weapons\r\ninstruments, which are the instruments of crime, to be\r\nvery timid, and it shows very little progress on the\r\nissue of development.\r\nWe regret that the document that we are about to\r\nadopt is not more clear and forceful on the issue of\r\nhuman rights, in particular with regard to creating a\r\nhuman rights council as a principal organ of the\r\nOrganization, with a clear and precise mandate in order\r\nto avoid the politicization and the discrimination that\r\ncan be seen on this issue in the Organization today.\r\nThe fact that we have devoted such great effort to\r\nthe reform of the Organization and to the High-level\r\nMeetings draft outcome document is tacit recognition\r\nof that reforms shortcomings and weaknesses and of\r\nthe need to bring it up to date with our times.\r\nNevertheless, we express our pride and satisfaction that\r\nthe United Nations has been vital to the world over the\r\npast 60 years. We must ensure that it continues to be\r\nvital in the imperative task of eradicating poverty.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Aleksander Kwaśniewski, President of the\r\nRepublic of Poland.\r\nPresident Kwaśniewski: The United Nations\r\ntoday is facing the unprecedented challenge of\r\nproviding humanity with new hope to build the\r\ncivilization of the twenty-first century on a solid\r\nfoundation of universal values: freedom, security,\r\ndemocracy and solidarity.\r\nPolish dedication to those values draws strength\r\nfrom our past experiences. This year in Poland we\r\ncommemorate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the\r\nSolidarity movement, which inspired profound changes\r\nin Central and Eastern Europe. Above all, it mobilized\r\nnations and societies around fundamental values and\r\nnoble principles. In that spirit, the anniversary\r\ncelebrations attended by numerous heads of State and\r\nGovernment concluded with the appeal to make 31\r\nAugust the World Day of Freedom and Solidarity.\r\n9\r\nA/60/PV.7\r\nToday, I wish to repeat that appeal and call for a world\r\nunited in freedom and solidarity.\r\nSolidarity should be considered a key principle of\r\ninternational relations. It combines respect for diversity\r\nand a readiness to provide assistance. As His Holiness\r\nPope John Paul II underlined, it is based on the\r\ncooperation of one person with another  not one\r\nperson against another  and on unity prevailing over\r\ndivisions. The solidarity of nations should always\r\nprevail over national egoism. The European Union has\r\nproved that it is possible to build structures and\r\nmechanisms of cooperation in a spirit of true solidarity.\r\nThe principle of solidarity remains inextricably\r\nlinked to that of freedom. For many, freedom remains\r\nan unfulfilled dream. On several continents, people are\r\ndeprived of their basic rights. However, freedom\r\ncannot be imposed from the outside. It must grow from\r\nwithin and from below. Democratic changes do not\r\noccur because they are masterminded somewhere else,\r\nbut because people want them. We must learn how to\r\nadvance freedom without imposing anything and how\r\nto foster freedom without relieving States of their\r\nprimary responsibility towards their citizens. The\r\nUnited Nations should make us feel confident that the\r\ninternational community will provide people with the\r\nnecessary protection and assistance when the State is\r\nunable to deliver.\r\nI hope that the recently established United\r\nNations Democracy Fund, which Poland supports and\r\nto which it is ready to contribute, will offer genuine\r\nassistance for those that aspire to and uphold freedom\r\nand solidarity.\r\nWe must also show greater determination in our\r\nresponse to problems such as violence, poverty, social\r\nexclusion, terrorism and the proliferation of weapons\r\nof mass destruction. We must stand up to those who\r\nignore the unity of our world and see it as a battlefield\r\nof fighting religions, nations and races. Therefore, the\r\nUnited Nations must pursue a far-reaching and\r\ncomprehensive vision of change and play a more\r\ndecisive and effective role in shaping a broad\r\ndevelopment policy that contributes to improving life\r\nin all parts of the world.\r\nAs our contribution to that change, the Republic\r\nof Poland has reaffirmed on numerous occasions the\r\nneed to elaborate a new political act of the United\r\nNations for the twenty-first century. In fact, the Polish\r\nvision of United Nations reform reflects our strong\r\ncommitment to fundamental values and principles, as\r\nwell as to effective multilateralism, which should serve\r\nas a guiding principle of United Nations activities.\r\nThe High-level Meetings draft outcome\r\ndocument reflects many of the ideas proposed by the\r\nPolish Government. At the same time, it reflects, in\r\nmany ways, a lower than expected consensus and\r\nshould be taken as the basis for further reform efforts.\r\nThere is no need to say how much we regret that\r\nneither arms control nor non-proliferation issues are\r\ncovered in the document. Despite our great\r\ndetermination, we were not able to achieve unity in\r\nconfronting all the problems facing the United Nations.\r\nOn the other hand, we should not expect that each\r\nand every summit meeting will bring revolutionary\r\nchanges. The real breakthrough usually comes in the\r\nwake of a lengthy and gradual process of change and\r\nadaptation. Indeed, the draft outcome document, the\r\npreparatory process and the discussions that took place\r\nat the meeting all provide many substantial insights\r\nand ideas and very useful recommendations that further\r\nmerit our serious consideration. How to implement\r\nthem, how to translate them into concrete action and\r\nhow to build practical consensus around them remain a\r\nserious challenge for the sixtieth session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nPoland will continue to strive for a genuine and\r\ncomprehensive reform that helps strengthen the\r\neffectiveness of the United Nations. We cannot build a\r\nsecure and just world without a strong commitment to\r\nact together through the United Nations. Freedom,\r\nsecurity, democracy and solidarity must serve as the\r\nkey guides to lead the Organization in the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Faure\r\nEssozimna Gnassingbé, President of the Togolese\r\nRepublic.\r\nPresident Gnassingbé (spoke in French): Allow\r\nme at the outset to extend once again to the\r\nGovernment and the people of the United States the\r\ndeepest condolences and sympathy of the Government\r\nand the people of the Togolese Republic in connection\r\nwith Hurricane Katrina, which caused great damage to\r\nthat country.\r\nAssembled in this Hall five years ago, heads of\r\nState or Government of the whole world undertook to\r\n10\r\nA/60/PV.7\r\nset the new guidelines that could help us meet the\r\nnumerous challenges and threats confronting the\r\ndawning twenty-first century, while reaffirming their\r\nfaith in the principles enshrined in the United Nations\r\nCharter. Since then, considerable ground has been\r\ncovered, as human communities have advanced\r\ntowards greater justice and solidarity and as they have\r\nsought for concerted solutions to world problems. The\r\nresolve made at the historic Summit to free people\r\nfrom the abject and dehumanizing conditions of\r\nextreme poverty (resolution 55/2, para. III.11),\r\ncontinues to underpin our common determination to\r\nassume our responsibilities as leaders and promoters of\r\na vast movement in the world towards shared,\r\nimproved well-being and to the preservation of peace\r\nand security. The improved design and functioning of\r\ninternational institutions have led to a new dynamic\r\nbased on respect for the rule of law and for procedures\r\ndefined at the successive sessions of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nWe have thus seen emerge, step by step, the right\r\nof peoples to self-determination, the protection of\r\nsovereignty and development mechanisms that reflect a\r\nmore effective sense of solidarity. Thus, in spite of\r\npersistent conflicts and hot spots, the world has moved\r\nresolutely ahead along the exhilarating path of positive\r\nchange, thereby giving people a better chance of\r\ncontrolling their fate.\r\nThe impact of the Millennium Summit, through\r\nthe recommendations and guidelines it produced, has\r\nshown the will of the States Member of our\r\nOrganization to pool their efforts and energy to resolve\r\nthe problems of our planet and to seek together the\r\nprogress and security of their peoples. It could not be\r\notherwise in a world which is more and more\r\ninterdependent, where threats, whatever their nature,\r\nspare no State. For example, the lightning spread of\r\ncertain pandemics and the violence of natural disasters,\r\nwhich for several months have been wreaking havoc\r\nwherever they have struck, remind us that no country\r\ncan face up to such situations alone.\r\nBy the same token, the fight against poverty,\r\nhunger, illiteracy and inequality, indeed all efforts to\r\nreduce poverty and promote socio-economic\r\ndevelopment, call for an active partnership.\r\nIn spite of delays in the achievement of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) and as in the\r\nimplementation of the results of world forums on\r\nfinancing for development, Togo, my country, strongly\r\nhopes that the fresh impetus given by the current\r\nsummit will lead our partners of the North to honour\r\ntheir commitments.\r\nIn this context, we should welcome all the recent\r\ninitiatives for development, including the decisions of\r\nthe last G-8 Summit at Glen Eagles and the proposals\r\nconcerning the search for new sources of financing for\r\ndevelopment or the eradication of obstacles to\r\ninternational trade.\r\nEfforts to achieve the MDGs need to go hand in\r\nhand with a bold reform of the United Nations and an\r\nimprovement in the functioning of its bodies, if we\r\nwish to strengthen the overall system and make it more\r\neffective and more credible. Thus it would make sense,\r\nespecially in the case of the Security Council, to ensure\r\nthat the reform effort does not aim at merely satisfying\r\nthe ambitions, legitimate though they are, of certain\r\nmajor countries, but to ensure that all the regions of the\r\nworld, and particularly Africa, are equitably\r\nrepresented in it.\r\nTogo reaffirms its readiness to participate\r\nactively in this debate and its commitment to make its\r\nown modest contribution to action to promote social\r\nprogress and better standards of life in larger freedom,\r\nas the Organizations Charter urges us to do.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, President of the\r\nRepublic of Bolivia.\r\nPresident Veltzé (spoke in Spanish): In this brief\r\nstatement to the 2005 summit, I wish to convey the\r\ncommitment of my country to participate actively in\r\nthe collective effort to achieve the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). We are convinced that\r\nthese are ambitious but absolutely legitimate goals.\r\nNevertheless, we would point out that there are\r\nessential preconditions here, such as coordinated and\r\nharmonious international cooperation, and that isolated\r\nefforts will not meet the expectations of nations still\r\nsuffering from the effects of an unjust international\r\norder and seeking within themselves new paths to\r\nequity and social inclusion, as being part and parcel of\r\nthe concept of freedom.\r\nThe people of Bolivia share the need to establish\r\nthe basic conditions to guarantee freedom from\r\npoverty. This is because poverty also includes factors\r\n11\r\nA/60/PV.7\r\nthat need to be dealt with in universal terms, since it\r\nhas to do not only with aspects such as debt relief, but\r\nalso with the liberalization of trade.\r\nNational security and the well-being of the\r\ninternational community are sorely affected by the\r\ndifficulty of combating the drug trade. Cooperation to\r\nthat end cannot be simply a question of money. It\r\nrequires the establishment of joint policies to give\r\nthose in the affected areas renewed opportunities and\r\nfresh hopes. At the Summit of the Americas in 2002 in\r\nQuebec, the presidents of the countries of our region\r\nundertook to open up markets for products that would\r\nbe alternatives to the crops used for the manufacture of\r\ndrugs. This policy, if implemented and extended to\r\nother regions as well, would play an important part in\r\nenabling people to live with less hardship and greater\r\ndignity. If democracy means the rule of law, ensuring\r\nthat the majority and minorities live together in\r\nharmony and respect, it should also be the guarantee of\r\nthe right to live without fear.\r\nMy country will participate in all efforts made\r\ncollectively within the United Nations, as well as\r\nbilaterally, to fight terrorism, which is an expression of\r\nintolerance.\r\nBolivia considers that the United Nations has in\r\nits 60 years of existence fulfilled the goals of its\r\nfounders. They were six decades fraught with tensions\r\nand threats, but that also saw the expansion of our area\r\nof dialogue and cooperation. We must accept that the\r\nworld Organization is not now representative of current\r\nrealities. In its structure, global confrontation continues\r\nto smolder. This is why we need to renew its structures\r\nand procedures without losing its core, which is an\r\nexpression of efforts for peace and, of course, mutual\r\ncooperation. We support the reform that will help to\r\ngive us a fresh start. Bolivia will join the initiatives to\r\nexpand the Security Council and to strengthen the\r\nEconomic and Social Council, which should play a\r\ncrucial role in ensuring that the MDGs are achieved,\r\nand in mobilizing efforts to facilitate dialogue and\r\nmutual consultation, to alleviate hunger, a scourge for\r\nmany nations, and to promote cooperation directed\r\ntowards improved levels of well-being. As we are well\r\naware, this will also make a vital contribution to peace.\r\nHowever, my Government is extremely interested\r\nin seeing the international community come together in\r\nthe establishment of an institution that is fundamental\r\nto civic freedom: the human rights council. We also\r\nbelieve that the creation of the peacebuilding\r\ncommission is of great significance and will lead to\r\ninternational cooperation and harmony.\r\nMy country is resolved to strengthen its own\r\ninstitutions. The Bolivian people has gone through\r\ndifficult times recently and is selflessly and maturely\r\nreinvigorating its democratic process as an essential\r\nelement of life in our Republic. In that complex\r\nsituation, Bolivia reiterates its determination to\r\ncontinue striving for significant progress towards the\r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nEnunciating goals is only one part of the story.\r\nOur diverse countries suffer a wide spectrum of\r\nproblems and obstacles. It would be simply pointless to\r\ntry to assess a countrys efforts and successes without\r\ntaking its particular circumstances into account. We\r\nneed instead, constructively and jointly, to follow up\r\nthe Goals and offer more cooperation to those that need\r\nit most and have the greatest difficulties. We must\r\nobsess not over deadlines, but over our work, which\r\nshould be shared fairly and equally.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): The Assembly will now hear an address by\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Stjepan Mesić, President of the\r\nRepublic of Croatia.\r\nPresident Mesić (spoke in Croatian; English text\r\nprovided by the delegation): Today, 60 years after our\r\npredecessors established this unique Organization,\r\nwhose programme is suggested by its very name, the\r\nUnited Nations, we can face one another as their\r\nsuccessors and say contentedly: We have succeeded.\r\nAt the same time, however, six decades after the\r\nestablishment of the United Nations, we must face one\r\nanother with a sense of bitter reality and say: We have\r\nfailed. Both are true.\r\nBoth statements speak not only about the world in\r\nthe recent past, but most of all about ourselves,\r\nbecause, as has often been said, with good reason, the\r\nUnited Nations is as good as its Member States. Of\r\ncourse, those States determine by their behaviour the\r\nworld in which we live. It is an indisputable fact that\r\nthe world that founded the United Nations was much\r\nmore united than the present world. It was a world\r\nunited by a common goal  opposition to the ideology\r\nand practice of fascism and Nazism  and determined\r\nto prevent any repetition of the horrors of aggressive\r\n12\r\nA/60/PV.7\r\nwars and of the Holocaust, the full truth of which had\r\njust begun to reach the public.\r\nOur Organization was founded at the end of the\r\ngreatest conflict in the history of humankind to date. It\r\nwas founded with the noble intention, as stated in its\r\nCharter, of saving succeeding generations from the\r\nscourge of war. That is precisely the first element that\r\nprovides the basis for my initial statements. Yes, we\r\nhave preserved peace on the global scale, there has\r\nbeen no new world war, and to that extent we have\r\nbeen successful. But we have not been able to save the\r\nworld and humankind from a protracted series of cruel\r\nand bloody wars, and in that context we have\r\nundeniably failed.\r\nThe principles of freedom  national and\r\nindividual freedom  and of equality in international\r\nrelations were among the priorities of the new world\r\nthat was being built. The issue of development and the\r\nclosing of the ever larger gap between the developed\r\nand the underdeveloped have long been on the agenda\r\nof the General Assembly. We have also discussed\r\nterrorism  to be sure, mainly that subsumed under\r\nthe rubric of State terrorism. Lacking the strength to\r\nprevent them, we have endeavoured to heal the\r\nconsequences of wars and armed conflicts. The results\r\nof all those efforts have been incomplete and partial;\r\nwe have achieved progress, but no issue has been dealt\r\nwith conclusively.\r\nOur current tasks were formulated very well at\r\nthe millennial meeting five years ago. On behalf of the\r\nRepublic of Croatia, I welcome the declaration on the\r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nAlthough it does not fully conform to its original\r\nintent, the declaration testifies to the prevailing mood\r\nin favour of supporting the Goals and tasks that have\r\nbeen identified as key and imperative issues.\r\nThe fact remains, however, that we have partly\r\nsucceeded but also partly failed with respect to the\r\nbasic principles governing relations in the international\r\narena, the development of the underdeveloped, and\r\narmed conflicts and terrorism. Thus, if today, 60 years\r\nlater, we must answer the question Can we be\r\nsatisfied?, the only honest answer is: Only partly.\r\nWhat, in that case, are we to do? First of all, our\r\nOrganization  imperfect but irreplaceable,\r\nunderefficient but imperative, sometimes deliberately\r\nmarginalized but, luckily, never fully relegated to the\r\nbackground  must become the reflection and the\r\nexpression of our world, an Organization capable of\r\ntackling its problems vigorously and efficiently. The\r\nUnited Nations must be reformed.\r\nThere is no alternative to that, and that should be\r\nclear to everyone who wants this Organization to play\r\nthe role envisioned by its founders. The Republic of\r\nCroatia is the successor to one of the founding\r\ncountries of the United Nations, and my country\r\ncherishes the sublime ideals governing the founders of\r\nthe Organization.\r\nThe key agencies of the United Nations in\r\ngeneral, and their structure in particular, reflect the\r\nworld as it was at the end of the Second World War \r\na world that no longer exists. That calls for a change.\r\nThe United Nations I have in mind must reflect the\r\nworld in which we live today and even anticipate the\r\nworld of tomorrow. Can we be unanimous on that \r\nlet me stress this point again  imperative reform? I\r\ndo not think so. Should that deter us from reform? On\r\nno account.\r\nLet me be completely clear. The concept of\r\nreform must proceed from current reality; it must\r\nconsider the foreseeable trends of future development;\r\nand, most importantly, it must be acceptable to a\r\nconvincing majority of the Members of our global\r\nOrganization. This is our Organization and we are the\r\nones it should serve.\r\nThe majority in this Organization is against war\r\nand in favour of peace; against force and the use of\r\nforce and in favour of negotiation and the peaceful\r\nsettlement of issues; against poverty, falling behind and\r\nunderdevelopment and in favour of global development\r\nand prosperity; against all forms of terrorism and in\r\nfavour of the security of States and citizens; against\r\ndiscrimination and intolerance of any kind and in\r\nfavour of equality and recognition of diversity; and\r\nagainst the sacrificing of our environment to fast profit\r\nand in favour of the preservation of the plant and\r\nanimal worlds, the bases of life on our planet.\r\nThe United Nations must become qualified to\r\nachieve those goals. The Organization must draw its\r\nstrength from our firm commitment to building a world\r\nthat will not only be better than the world of 60 years\r\nago, but even better than our current world. It must\r\nnever become a mere ornament on the international\r\nscene. Even more importantly, it must never become a\r\nscreen providing legitimacy to any policy clearly\r\nopposed to the mood of the majority  our mood, the\r\n13\r\nA/60/PV.7\r\nmood of the nations and States united in the effort to\r\nbuild a better future world.\r\nNevertheless, in spite of that only partial success,\r\nwe have achieved a lot. There are great goals and\r\ndifficult tasks ahead of us. We are now faced with a\r\nquestion that calls for an answer by deeds rather than\r\nwords: Can we be united in order to survive, in order to\r\nliterally save our world for future generations?\r\nI hope and believe that we will have the strength\r\nand the wisdom to answer that question in the\r\naffirmative. We owe it not only to the founders of the\r\nUnited Nations but also to our children and to their\r\nchildren. We must not betray them.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Runaldo Ronald Venetiaan, President of the\r\nRepublic of Suriname.\r\nPresident Venetiaan: My delegation is pleased to\r\nsee the delegations of Gabon and Sweden presiding\r\nover this very important meeting.\r\nSuriname joins the rest of the international\r\ncommunity in expressing its profound sorrow at the\r\ntremendous loss of life and property caused by\r\nHurricane Katrina to the Gulf Coast of the United\r\nStates of America.\r\nThis significant gathering should be testimony to\r\nthe resolve of the international community to\r\ncollectively arrive at adequate responses to the many\r\nchallenges it is facing. It should also represent the\r\ngenuine beginning of an era of concerted actions aimed\r\nat implementing the commitments made at major\r\nUnited Nations conferences. This requires a reformed\r\nUnited Nations that can effectively deal with such\r\nchallenges.\r\nThe outcome document we are about to adopt\r\noutlines concrete measures to ensure effective follow-\r\nup to a number of commitments we have solemnly\r\nmade over the past 60 years. As concerns some of the\r\nmajor issues, we still need to adopt measures in order\r\nto reach the lofty goals we have set ourselves.\r\nSuriname recently submitted a baseline report on\r\nthe national implementation of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. I am pleased to report that we are\r\nmaking progress in some areas, especially in the areas\r\nof education and of the environment. However, like the\r\nrest of the world, we are still encountering difficulties\r\nin other areas. My Government remains committed to\r\nworking with national stakeholders, as well as with\r\nregional and international partners, to achieve the\r\nMillennium Development Goals, and we have taken the\r\nnecessary steps to set up a network of State and non-\r\nState actors to monitor the national implementation of\r\nour international commitments.\r\nMy Government is aware of its own\r\nresponsibility in the development process. However,\r\nlike most other developing countries, we have\r\nencountered some serious obstacles, such as unfair\r\ntrade and high debts, which have a negative influence\r\non this process.\r\nA particularly important and longstanding\r\nundertaking which has yet to be realized relates to the\r\nissue of official development assistance (ODA). With a\r\nfew exceptions, the developed countries have not yet\r\nmet the targets to which they committed themselves.\r\nOn the contrary, ODA has declined.\r\nThe Caribbean Community (CARICOM), a\r\nregion of small and vulnerable economies, has\r\nexperienced this significant decrease in ODA. It is to\r\nbe hoped that the appeal contained in the Secretary-\r\nGenerals report will be heeded. The report calls on\r\nthose developed countries that have not yet established\r\na timetable to achieve the 0.7 per cent of GDP goal for\r\nODA to do so, starting with significant increases no\r\nlater than 2006, reaching 0.5 per cent by 2009, and 0.7\r\nper cent no later than 2015.\r\nSuriname agrees that there can be no\r\ndevelopment without security, and no security without\r\ndevelopment. Neither can there be sustainable\r\ndevelopment if human rights are not respected.\r\nReform of the human rights machinery, as is the\r\ncase for many United Nations reforms, is now long\r\noverdue. The Government of Suriname can generally\r\naccept the creation of a Human Rights Council. We\r\nsupport the view that the open-ended working group\r\nwhich will be set up should embark on an elaborate\r\ndiscussion on the modalities, mandate, review process\r\nand composition of such a Council.\r\nThe international community has witnessed\r\nnoticeable setbacks with regard to disarmament and\r\nnon-proliferation. It is regrettable, therefore, that this\r\nimportant issue is not mentioned in the outcome\r\ndocument we are about to adopt.\r\n14\r\nA/60/PV.7\r\nIn closing, I would like to stress the fact that the\r\nsituation in the world can improve only if we all live\r\nup to our commitments. Our people depend on us to\r\nlead them on the path towards a decent life for each\r\nhuman being, in a peaceful world, free of famine and\r\nfree of poverty.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Jorge\r\nFernando Branco de Sampaio, President of the\r\nPortuguese Republic.\r\nPresident Sampaio (spoke in Portuguese;\r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): I am\r\naddressing the General Assembly for the last time as\r\nPresident of the Portuguese Republic this year  a\r\nyear in which we are celebrating the sixtieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations. I feel, on this\r\nhistoric date, that the generation to which I belong is\r\ncharged with a responsibility that cannot be put off: the\r\nresponsibility of responding to global challenges \r\nwhich increasingly demand integrated, collective\r\nanswers  and of fulfilling the just aspirations of\r\nmillions of individuals for whom day-to-day life is no\r\nmore than an ongoing, inglorious struggle for survival.\r\nIt is the duty of the United Nations to articulate such\r\nresponses and to point the way forward to meeting\r\nthose expectations.\r\nThe United Nations has always occupied a central\r\nposition on the international stage; it has been a\r\nconstant focal point for the hopes of humankind.\r\nPeace, development and the protection of human rights\r\non a global scale were the fundamental aspirations of\r\nits founders. But early on the latter were confronted\r\nwith the harsh realities of power and conflicting\r\ninterests. Not everything was a success. But their\r\nidealism and hope, because they corresponded to the\r\nmost basic of human aspirations  dignity, freedom\r\nand economic development  have continued to\r\nprevail and have preserved their vitality, even in\r\nadversity.\r\nDuring these six decades, much progress has been\r\nmade in the areas of life expectancy, health, education\r\nand quality of life. Unfortunately, however, we also\r\nknow that there are still many millions of human\r\nbeings who still live and die in the most extreme\r\npoverty.\r\nAt this summit, the international community\r\nrenews its commitment to the founding ideals of the\r\nOrganization. The Millennium Development Goals\r\nmake it possible for those ideas to be translated into\r\nconcrete achievements that will meet the needs of the\r\npoorer and more vulnerable segments of society in\r\nparticular. Achieving the Goals is a moral and political\r\nimperative to ensure a more secure future for all\r\nhumankind. Portugal reiterates its support to these lofty\r\nobjectives and its commitment to an effective\r\nmultilateral system, which is essential for their\r\nachievement.\r\nThe Millennium Summit was a turning point for\r\nglobal partnership. Since then, considerable awareness\r\nhas been created among Governments and public\r\nopinion alike of the absolute priority of reducing\r\npoverty. How can we be at peace with our conscience\r\nwhile, in this era of abundance unprecedented in our\r\nhistory, millions of human beings die of poverty?\r\nAchievement of the Goals that we set is within\r\nour grasp. If politics is the art of the possible, then we,\r\nas political leaders, are charged with making things\r\npossible. As a member of the European Union,\r\nPortugal is committed to ensuring that European aid\r\nrises to 0.56 per cent in 2010 and to 0.7 per cent in\r\n2015. As to national aid, we intend to increase our\r\nvolume of official development assistance to 0.51 per\r\ncent of our gross domestic product (GDP) by 2010.\r\nPortugal has directed a large part of its effort to\r\ncountries in which the scourge of poverty is felt most\r\nkeenly. We attach particular importance to the least\r\ndeveloped countries, particularly those in Africa, to\r\nwhich we devote 0.2 per cent of our GDP, fully\r\nmeeting our stated objectives. The relationship that\r\nPortugal has maintained with that continent over\r\ncenturies fully warrants that, as do the situation of\r\nextreme poverty and the manifest delay in meeting the\r\nestablished goals.\r\nWe support the movement towards debt\r\nforgiveness, and we also believe in the creative\r\nidentification of alternative sources of financing aid for\r\ndevelopment. We are focusing attention on pandemics\r\nin particular, as they are affecting those countries so\r\nseverely, and we recently increased to $5 million our\r\ncontribution to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,\r\nTuberculosis and Malaria. In Africa in particular, those\r\ndiseases constitute the greatest threat to human\r\nsecurity. What will future generations think if, with the\r\nresources and information available to us, we show that\r\nwe are incapable of dealing with such threats?\r\n15\r\nA/60/PV.7\r\nOn the issue of cooperation for development, aid\r\ndonors and recipients have a shared responsibility,\r\nsince aid will never be sufficient if it is not properly\r\napplied. We therefore attach particular importance not\r\nonly to good governance, but especially to the primacy\r\nof law and the consolidation of democracy, and also to\r\nthe restoration of the States capabilities in performing\r\nits basic functions.\r\nWithout security there can be no sustainable\r\ndevelopment. Only a coherent, integrated strategy can\r\nallow for effective action in preventing conflicts or \r\nshould that prove impossible  in providing the\r\nnecessary support for reconstruction and the restoration\r\nof the capabilities of States and institutions during the\r\npost-conflict period. That is the twofold task of the\r\nPeacebuilding Commission, which was initially\r\nproposed by Portugal in 2003. The establishment of\r\nthat body will surely constitute one of the landmarks of\r\nthis summit.\r\nWe believe that the United Nations has an\r\nimportant part to play in the fight against international\r\nterrorism, ensuring an effective, multilateral response\r\nto that terrible new threat. The negotiation and\r\nconclusion of a global convention on terrorism should\r\ncontinue to be a priority.\r\nThere is also an urgent need to relaunch\r\ndiscussions on disarmament and the non-proliferation\r\nof weapons of mass destruction within the framework\r\nof this Organization.\r\nWe attach particular importance to the issue of\r\nhuman rights. We believe that the new Human Rights\r\nCouncil should reflect, with courage and ambition, the\r\ngrowing demands of the international community in\r\nthat regard.\r\nThe document that is to be adopted during this\r\nMeeting will be a step in the right direction. It\r\ndemonstrates the ability of the international community\r\nto unite around the great principles upon which the\r\nUnited Nations was founded and it renews and\r\nreiterates the commitment to the development goals of\r\nthe Millennium Declaration. It will begin the process\r\nof the reform of the Organization so as to render it\r\nbetter able to respond to the challenges of this century.\r\nThe course has been charted. It is now for the\r\nAssembly to assume the great responsibility of\r\nbringing to completion the process that we have begun.\r\nFor its part, Portugal reiterates its firm\r\ncommitment to multilateralism, to the United Nations\r\nand to an international order in which the collective\r\ninterest is not systematically sacrificed to expediency\r\nand self-centred interests. Now, as at the time of its\r\nfoundation, the United Nations must constitute the\r\nessential anchor of a system of international relations\r\nbased on law and justice. Strengthening the authority,\r\nthe legitimacy and the relevance of the United Nations\r\nis an essential task if the twenty-first century is to be\r\none of peace, progress and respect for the dignity of all\r\nhuman beings.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Leonel\r\nFernández Reyna, President of the Dominican\r\nRepublic.\r\nPresident Fernández Reyna (spoke in Spanish):\r\nIt is a great honour for me to address the Assembly on\r\nbehalf of the Government and the people of the\r\nDominican Republic at this global summit, the High-\r\nlevel Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly, which\r\nhas been convened to review progress towards\r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals\r\n(MDGs).\r\nThis summit will provide us with an opportunity\r\nto reaffirm commitments and redefine strategies so that\r\nwe can continue to make progress in this complex but\r\npromising process on which the global community\r\nembarked five years ago with a view to achieving the\r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs).\r\nAs for the Dominican Republic, I reaffirm our\r\npolitical will to foster a national consensus, promote\r\npublic policies and ensure the technical and\r\ninstitutional capacity, as well as the financial resources,\r\nto make possible the gradual achievement of those\r\nGoals.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to reaffirm\r\nmy profound conviction that the true purpose of\r\ngovernment, which exercises power from the\r\nprivileged position bestowed upon it by the citizens\r\nthrough democratic elections, is to create economic\r\nand educational opportunities for all; to fight poverty,\r\ninequality, social exclusion and insecurity; and to\r\nimprove the general living conditions and health of all\r\nour people.\r\nThe Millennium Development Goals enable us to\r\nbetter understand what needs to be done, while\r\n16\r\nA/60/PV.7\r\nconfronting us with the challenge of designing a\r\nstrategy and obtaining sufficient resources to make\r\ntheir achievement possible.\r\nThe Dominican Republic has created a\r\nPresidential Commission on the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals to continuously monitor progress\r\nin the achievement of those objectives and to provide\r\nsupport to various ministries and Government\r\ndepartments with a view to keeping the focus on the\r\nimplementation of the commitments entered into at the\r\nMillennium Summit.\r\nThe Presidential Commission also aims to\r\nmaintain a dialogue and ensure an exchange of\r\ninformation with civil society entities, since we believe\r\nthat only by redoubling our efforts, encouraging\r\nsynergies and harnessing the goodwill of the public and\r\nprivate sectors, will we be able to achieve the Goals.\r\nOne of the first tasks we undertook upon taking\r\nup the reins of Government in August 2004 was to\r\nanalyse the financial costs of achieving the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, established by this world\r\nOrganization. After several inter-ministerial and inter-\r\nagency consultations, we came to the conclusion that\r\nthe Dominican Republic needs between 29 to 30 billion\r\ndollars over the course of the next 10 years in order to\r\nachieve the MDGs at our national level. For a country\r\nwith a gross domestic product of 21 billion dollars,\r\nthose are truly impressive figures.\r\nWe ask ourselves the following. How are we\r\ngoing to obtain those resources? How are we going to\r\nfinance our social development in a national context\r\nmarked by major fiscal constraints? How will that be\r\npossible, following the domestic reforms stipulated in\r\nour agreement with the International Monetary Fund?\r\nFinally, how will we succeed, after having to keep at\r\nbay an economic crisis bequeathed to us, which several\r\nindependent analysts consider to be one of the most\r\nsevere and profound in Dominican history?\r\nIt is obvious that, domestically, we do not have\r\nanything like such resources. Consequently, we must\r\nturn to multilateral financial institutions, seek foreign\r\ncapital investments and the cooperation of developed\r\ncountries governmental agencies.\r\nAlthough we accept the principle established in\r\nthe Monterrey Consensus that each country is\r\nresponsible for its own development, that principle\r\nceases to be valid if countries do not possess the\r\nresources needed to implement the MDGs. Effective\r\naction in that regard must mean greater reliance on the\r\nimagination, a bolder approach and more cooperation.\r\nThe call by some nations whose economies, like\r\nthat of the Dominican Republic, can be considered as\r\nemerging, for a debt swap programme to help achieve\r\nthe MDGs makes sense in such a context. The\r\nprogramme would follow guidelines recently set out by\r\nthe Government of Spain, aimed at contributing to the\r\nhuman development of Ibero-American member\r\ncountries by carrying out educational and cultural\r\nprogrammes to replace the debt owed by those\r\ncountries to Spain.\r\nA fundamental responsibility of Governments is\r\nto have public policies that promote macroeconomic\r\nstability, stimulate investment and create a reliable,\r\npredictable legal and institutional environment.\r\nWe are satisfied with what we have achieved in\r\nthis regard, given that, in slightly more than one year,\r\nthe Dominican Republic has begun to be well on the\r\nway to recovery.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to say is that, after so\r\nmany efforts to stabilize our national economy, and\r\nafter the various actions undertaken to fulfil our\r\ncommitment in respect of the MDGs, we have been\r\naffected by a particularly dramatic misfortune, namely,\r\nthe rise in oil prices on the international market.\r\nNothing could be more harmful today to the effective\r\nperformance of the world economy than the steady\r\nincrease in the price of fuel. We know that as the cost\r\nof this commodity rise, so the growth rate of the global\r\neconomy decreases. And what could ultimately arise\r\nfrom this worrying situation is a global recession. A\r\nworld recession would have disastrous consequences\r\nfor the economies of developing countries. Their\r\ninternational trade could become paralysed. Inflation\r\nwould unleash its fury upon the most vulnerable\r\nsectors. Many jobs would be lost. Social tension would\r\nprevail, and our main population centres would fall\r\nprey to uncertainty.\r\nTherefore, in order to guarantee political stability,\r\ngood governance and international peace and security,\r\nin accordance with the principles enshrined in the San\r\nFrancisco Charter, which established this great\r\nOrganization, we call upon the world community to\r\nplace the current energy crisis as a top priority on the\r\ninternational agenda.\r\n17\r\nA/60/PV.7\r\nWe are firmly convinced that a meeting of this\r\nmagnitude and nature can allay the anxieties of\r\nhumanity, holding out the hope that the most powerful\r\nand influential forces on the planet will find the\r\nformula that will make it possible to ensure that we all\r\ncan follow the path to peace, calm and progress.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): I would remind\r\ndelegates in the Hall to keep their voices down and\r\navoid loud conversations in the corridors out of respect\r\nfor the speakers. I should also like to remind members\r\nof the five-minute rule; it will be necessary to follow\r\nthis rule today if we are to finish the deliberations in\r\ntime.\r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by His\r\nExcellency Mr. BounNhang Vorachit, Prime Minister\r\nof the Lao Peoples Democratic Republic.\r\nMr. Vorachit (Lao Peoples Democratic\r\nRepublic) (spoke in Lao; English text provided by the\r\ndelegation): Since the Millennium Summit, five years\r\nago, when the Millennium Declaration was adopted,\r\nthe implementation of the Millennium Development\r\nGoals (MDGs), which set out concrete measures and\r\nactions, including time-bound targets, has been far\r\nfrom satisfactory. In Africa, most countries have sunk\r\ndeeper into poverty. In Asia and the Pacific, the region\r\nis still home to two thirds of the worlds poor.\r\nOver the last decade, the Lao Peoples\r\nDemocratic Republic has recorded a number of\r\nsignificant achievements in its socio-economic\r\ndevelopment. Following sustained progress, the\r\ncountry was ranked 135th in the Human Development\r\nIndex out of 177 countries in 2004, compared to 141st\r\nout of 173 countries in 1993. One of the lessons\r\nlearned is that the gains are due to the Governments\r\nconsistent policy of promoting all economic sectors\r\nthrough a market-based mechanism, coupled with the\r\nbroadening of external cooperation so as to exploit\r\nuntapped national potential.\r\nDespite the aforementioned progress and\r\nachievements, the Lao Peoples Democratic Republic is\r\nstill facing various challenges. These include the poor\r\nsocio-economic infrastructure and isolation from world\r\nmarkets owing to its being a landlocked least\r\ndeveloped country. The spread of infectious diseases,\r\nsuch as malaria, avian flu and HIV/AIDS, although\r\nprevalence is low, continues to pose a serious threat to\r\nthe nation because of its land links to countries in the\r\nGreater Mekong subregion.\r\nThe provision of permanent employment for\r\npeople practising shifting cultivation and opium-\r\ngrowing remains a daunting task that needs to be\r\naddressed through integrated rural development\r\nprojects aimed at ensuring sustained livelihood and\r\nbetter alternatives for the people. Furthermore, the\r\ninsufficient general knowledge and unskilled labour of\r\nthe people limit our capacity to respond to the\r\ncountrys development needs with the introduction of\r\nmodern and innovative technology.\r\nFor the Lao Peoples Democratic Republic, the\r\nsupport and assistance of the international community\r\nin addressing the aforementioned challenges are of the\r\nutmost importance if we are to achieve the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. We highly value the assistance of\r\nthe donor community, including grant aid, soft loans\r\nand foreign investment, such as the assistance of the\r\nWorld Bank in the construction of the Nam Theun 2\r\nhydropower dam.\r\nIn terms of official development assistance, the\r\nLao Peoples Democratic Republic would like to see\r\ngreater coherence among donors, in keeping with the\r\nsocio-economic development plan of the recipient\r\ncountries. In addition, grant aid in the social sector is\r\npreferable to loans, as the latter would drive the nation\r\ninto heavy debt. Similarly, loans for economic\r\ndevelopment should be extended at a concessionary\r\ninterest rate with a long-term payback schedule.\r\nMoreover, maximum benefits for recipient countries\r\nshould be ensured in the utilization of grant aid in\r\nvarious forms while avoiding high spending on\r\ninternational consultancy.\r\nWe welcome the policy recently enunciated by\r\nthe developed countries, particularly the European\r\nUnion and the G-8, in the area of official development\r\nassistance and debt relief in favour of the poorest\r\ncountries. Moreover, we are encouraged by a number\r\nof initiatives on innovative sources of financing for\r\ndevelopment that were raised at the separate meeting\r\non financing for development. Likewise, the United\r\nNations system plays an equally vital role in assisting\r\nthe vulnerable countries in meeting their objectives and\r\ngoals. However, the focus of that support should be\r\nplaced on development projects corresponding to\r\nnational development needs and priorities.\r\nOur High-level Plenary Meeting is indeed of the\r\nutmost importance. I hope that the international\r\ncommunity will further intensify its cooperation and\r\n18\r\nA/60/PV.7\r\nmake every effort to attain the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. However, developing a nation and\r\neradicating poverty requires an environment of lasting\r\npeace and dynamic international cooperation. In that\r\nspirit, the Lao Peoples Democratic Republic reaffirms\r\nits commitment to further cooperating with the\r\ninternational community in the fight against terrorism\r\nin all its forms and manifestations, and in the\r\npromotion of development cooperation.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Kostas\r\nKaramanlis, Prime Minister of the Hellenic Republic.\r\nMr. Karamanlis (Greece): I wish to thank both\r\nCo-Chairpersons of the High-level Plenary Meeting, El\r\nHadj Omar Bongo Ondimba, President of Gabon, and\r\nMr. Göran Persson, Prime Minister of Sweden, for\r\npresiding over this meeting.\r\nI also wish to extend our deepest appreciation to\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan for his tireless efforts\r\nfor the realization of this historic high-level event.\r\nFive years ago, through the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, the leaders of the world set ambitious but\r\nattainable objectives, encompassing the aspirations of\r\nthe international community in the new century for a\r\nworld united by common values and striving with\r\nrenewed determination to achieve peace and decent\r\nstandards of living for every man, woman and child.\r\nMuch has happened since then. Considerable\r\nprogress has been achieved in the eradication of\r\npoverty and hunger. The Millennium Development\r\nGoals were established and the Monterrey Consensus\r\nwas adopted. In that global effort, Greece has\r\nsignificantly increased its development assistance.\r\nTogether with the rest of our European Union partners,\r\nwe set the ambitious goal of increasing it to 0.56 per\r\ncent of our gross national income by the year 2010,\r\nwith particular attention to and emphasis on Africa.\r\nDespite the progress achieved, a lot remains to be\r\ndone. Significant differences persist between\r\ndeveloped and developing countries. Extreme poverty\r\nand hunger are the disgrace of our century. Today, we\r\nhave the means to eradicate them. We must persevere\r\nin that goal, as indeed in all of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, in order to achieve them by 2015.\r\nFive years ago, we proclaimed our collective\r\nresponsibility to uphold the principles of human\r\ndignity, equality and equity at the global level. We\r\nhave established a comprehensive normative\r\nframework with core human rights treaties, historic\r\ndeclarations and decades of jurisprudence from treaty\r\nbodies and international tribunals. Nevertheless, there\r\nis still a dangerous lack of enforcement and\r\nimplementation at the global level. We must take\r\nconcrete steps to reduce selective application, arbitrary\r\nenforcement and breach without consequence. Those\r\nsteps will give new life to the commitments made in\r\nthe Millennium Declaration. In the document we have\r\njust adopted, those commitments have been\r\nconsiderably reinforced.\r\nSignificant events since the Millennium\r\nDeclaration have had far-reaching consequences and\r\nchanged dramatically the way we perceive peace and\r\nsecurity. The terrorist attacks in New York and\r\nelsewhere have brought new global threats and\r\nchallenges to light.\r\nIn these constantly evolving times, the\r\ndeclaration we are adopting today is an opportunity to\r\nreaffirm our commitment to certain basic principles,\r\nsuch as the obligation to refrain from the threat or use\r\nof force in any manner inconsistent with the United\r\nNations Charter; the peaceful resolution of disputes, in\r\naccordance with the United Nations Charter and\r\ninternational law; the authority of the Security Council\r\nto take action to maintain and restore international\r\npeace and security; and the full implementation of\r\nSecurity Council resolutions. Only through such\r\ncommitment can we hope to successfully face\r\nterrorism, global pandemics, extreme poverty, natural\r\ndisasters, weapons of mass destruction, transnational\r\norganized crime, massive human rights violations and\r\nother scourges of our world.\r\nThis year, we celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of\r\nour Organization, which, built for a different era, has to\r\nadapt in order to be effective in the new international\r\nenvironment. The United Nations, the only truly global\r\ninstitution of humanity, endowed with a unique\r\nlegitimacy, must respond to the new realities and\r\nchallenges.\r\nThe draft outcome document (A/60/L.1) we are\r\nadopting today constitutes, in our view, a good\r\nbeginning on the long path of necessary reforms. It is a\r\nstrong political call encompassing most of the\r\nsuggested ideas in development, peacebuilding, human\r\nrights, peacekeeping and United Nations institutions.\r\n19\r\nA/60/PV.7\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency The\r\nHonourable John Howard, Prime Minister of Australia.\r\nMr. Howard (Australia): As one of the 51\r\noriginal countries to sign the Charter, Australia has had\r\na long and active involvement in the United Nations. In\r\nthis, the sixtieth anniversary year of the United\r\nNations, Australia can look back on a strong record of\r\ninvolvement in a multitude of United Nations-\r\nsponsored processes and active membership in the\r\nOrganization. We have supplied personnel for\r\npeacekeeping operations around the world since 1947\r\nand have been at the forefront of efforts to reform the\r\noperations of the Organization.\r\nWe should not think that the United Nations can\r\nsolve all of the worlds problems or that it should even\r\nattempt to do so. The type of multilateralism embodied\r\nin organizations such as the United Nations can only be\r\none element of a comprehensive foreign policy.\r\nThe nation-State remains the focus of legitimate\r\naction for order and justice in our world. As nation-\r\nStates, our collective challenge and responsibility is to\r\nidentify those things that the United Nations can do\r\nand to ensure it is equipped to do them.\r\nIt is a grim but inescapable fact that our world\r\nlives under the shadow of global terrorism. I have this\r\nweek signed the International Convention for the\r\nSuppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism on behalf of\r\nAustralia. We support the counter-terrorism outcomes\r\nof this High-level Plenary Meeting, including the\r\nmomentum to conclude an international convention on\r\nthe suppression of terrorism. More, however, could\r\nhave been achieved. And there has been\r\nunderstandable disappointment and criticism at the\r\nlack of language on disarmament and non-\r\nproliferation, particularly given the risk of proliferation\r\nof weapons of mass destruction to terrorists.\r\nThis meeting has seen much discussion about aid\r\nlevels, and I was pleased to announce earlier this week\r\nmy Governments goal to double its overseas aid\r\nallocation from 2004 levels to about $4 thousand\r\nmillion by 2010.\r\nBut we should not merely be focusing on the\r\namount of such aid, important though it is. What is just\r\nas important, if not more so, is the effectiveness of aid.\r\nGenuine and sustained poverty alleviation will\r\nonly occur in an environment of good governance,\r\nprivate sector growth and respect for private-property\r\nownership. With aid comes a reciprocal responsibility\r\non the part of recipient Governments to tackle\r\ncorruption, strengthen governance and promote\r\ninstitutional reform.\r\nThose will remain key objectives of Australias\r\naid programme, not least as it rises to meet the\r\nchallenges posed by HIV/AIDS, and the re-emerging\r\nthreat of avian influenza, which will require global\r\npolitical leadership in which Australia will play its\r\npart.\r\nThere has been strong emphasis in recent days on\r\nthe fact that trade barriers in the developed world cost\r\npoor countries more than twice the amount of the\r\nofficial aid they receive. There could, in truth, be no\r\ngreater gift to the developing world than lower trade\r\nbarriers and an end to subsidies. I warmly welcome\r\nPresident Bushs pledge and challenge to us all on\r\nWednesday that the United States of America is ready\r\nto eliminate all tariffs, subsidies and other barriers to\r\nthe free flow of goods and services if other nations are\r\nwilling to do the same.\r\nWe must also recognize the high cost of ignoring\r\nfragile States. Responding to their challenges requires\r\na new way of acting that recognizes the links between\r\nsecurity and economic development. Australias\r\nleadership of the Regional Assistance Mission to\r\nSolomon Islands speaks for our experience in this area,\r\nwhich we look forward to sharing. In this context,\r\nAustralia welcomes the establishment of the\r\nPeacebuilding Commission, and I am pleased to\r\nannounce a contribution of $3 million over three years\r\nto its new Standing Fund.\r\nOn human rights and the rule of law, endorsement\r\nby leaders of the concept of a responsibility to\r\nprotect is a significant step forward. But we are\r\nconcerned at the limited outcome with respect to the\r\nHuman Rights Council. Australia supports a strong\r\nCouncil that is capable of responding to serious human\r\nrights abuses effectively and with credibility. Member\r\nStates must work assiduously during this session to\r\ninject substance into the agreed negotiations on the\r\nCouncils modalities.\r\nWe welcome the resolve to strengthen the Office\r\nof the High Commissioner for Human Rights and will\r\nmake our own additional contribution to its operations.\r\n20\r\nA/60/PV.7\r\nI was also pleased to announce here this week a\r\ncontribution of $10 million to the Democracy Fund.\r\nHistory has shown that the most stable and prosperous\r\nnations over time have responsive political institutions\r\nas their common link.\r\nWe could have hoped for more progress on\r\nmanagement reforms for the Organization, particularly\r\nin light of the findings of the Independent Inquiry\r\nCommittee into the United Nations Oil-for-Food\r\nProgramme (the Volcker inquiry), and we support the\r\nongoing need for reform. We remain hopeful that a\r\nformula for Security Council expansion that will better\r\nreflect todays geopolitical realities, including through\r\nthe permanent membership of Japan, can be worked\r\nout.\r\nIn summary, we welcome the outcome document\r\nas a reasonable balance of issues overall. The challenge\r\nfor the United Nations now is to redefine its authority\r\nand responsibility in the global environment in which\r\nwe find ourselves. Australia, as always, will be an\r\nactive player in these deliberations.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Kjell\r\nMagne Bondevik, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of\r\nNorway.\r\nMr. Bondevik (Norway): Five years ago, we\r\nagreed on the Millennium Development Goals. We\r\nshould keep our promises. I, therefore, welcome our\r\ncommitment to increase our official development\r\nassistance.\r\nThe world is expecting us to make poverty\r\nhistory, to turn poverty into something our great\r\ngrandchildren will read about, but not really\r\nunderstand. We can do it, and we must do it: by\r\nincreasing our support to the efforts by the developing\r\ncountries, by involving women fully in our noble\r\nundertaking based on gender equality, by reducing\r\nbarriers to trade, by promoting investment and social\r\ndevelopment and by mobilizing business and civil\r\nsociety in both rich and poor countries in the war on\r\npoverty. And, like a good farmer, we must manage the\r\nearth and its resources so that they will benefit not only\r\npresent but also future generations.\r\nDevelopment also requires good governance. It\r\ncalls for determined efforts to fight corruption. It\r\nentails responsible and transparent government, by and\r\nfor the people.\r\nUltimately, good governance is about democracy\r\nand human rights. Freedom of expression, freedom to\r\nseek information, freedom from discrimination \r\nrights like these enable people not only to use and\r\ndevelop their God-given talents, but also to make\r\ngreater contributions to their societies. Human rights\r\nmust be fully integrated into all United Nations\r\nactivities. I thus welcome the strengthening of the\r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nHuman Rights.\r\nWhen a fellow human being needs our protection,\r\nwe have a duty to help. One of the achievements of this\r\nsummit is our readiness to take collective action \r\nthrough the Security Council  to protect. We will do\r\nso if peaceful means are found to be inadequate and if\r\nnational authorities manifestly fail to protect their\r\npopulations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic\r\ncleansing and crimes against humanity.\r\nMaintaining peace and security was, and still is,\r\nthe aim of the Organization. Preventing and ending\r\narmed conflicts, stabilizing and rebuilding failed or\r\nfailing States  these are huge and complex tasks. I\r\nbelieve that the Peacebuilding Commission and the\r\nPeacebuilding Fund will make the United Nations\r\nbetter able to take on such challenges. I am happy to\r\nannounce that Norway will contribute $15 million to\r\nthe Peacebuilding Fund and the same amount to the\r\nhumanitarian fund.\r\nBut the United Nations cannot do much on its\r\nown. We need the commitment of the Member\r\nStates  all of us here today  and we need a new\r\npartnership between the United Nations and regional\r\norganizations. We, the Member States, must take\r\ncollective and effective measures to maintain peace\r\nand security and to prevent or remove threats to\r\nhumanity.\r\nOne of our most urgent priorities is the area of\r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation. We see a growing\r\nrisk of proliferation, of catastrophic terrorism. All\r\nStates must work for disarmament and non-\r\nproliferation. Yet our world summit could not generate\r\nany consensus on how to address those truly global\r\nthreats. We regret this deeply. Norway will continue to\r\nseek a new consensus and to achieve results.\r\nBy their evil actions, terrorists are attacking the\r\nvalues held by all the great religions and by the United\r\nNations. We must do whatever we can within the\r\nframework of international law to stop them. The war\r\n21\r\nA/60/PV.7\r\nagainst terrorism cannot be won by military means\r\nalone; we need a broad approach. I believe that the best\r\nstrategy is to address the root causes of terrorism, such\r\nas armed conflict and occupation, intolerance and\r\nrepression, humiliation and hopelessness.\r\nThese were the very tasks we entrusted to the\r\nUnited Nations in 1945. They are just as relevant\r\ntoday. And we, the peoples of the United Nations,\r\nneed, more than ever before, a strong United Nations to\r\naccomplish them. So let us together live up to our\r\ncommitments and make the United Nations the strong\r\nand flexible Organization we so desperately need. Let\r\nus agree to act now.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency The Right\r\nHonourable Keith Claudius Mitchell, Prime Minister of\r\nGrenada.\r\nMr. Mitchell (Grenada): At the outset, let me\r\nexpress, on behalf of the Government and the people of\r\nGrenada, profound sympathy to the people of the\r\nUnited States of America for the massive destruction\r\nand loss of life caused by Hurricane Katrina,\r\nparticularly in the states of Louisiana and Mississippi.\r\nWe can certainly empathize with their pain and loss.\r\nI wish to express, on behalf of the delegation of\r\nGrenada, warm congratulations to the Co-Chairpersons\r\non their election and on steering these deliberations so\r\nefficiently. I also salute the Secretary-General, who has\r\nbeen guiding the Organization through a very difficult\r\nperiod and whose vision for the future we will adopt at\r\nthe conclusion of this summit.\r\nI am deeply honoured to address this High-level\r\nPlenary Meeting on the occasion of the sixtieth\r\nanniversary of the founding of this body and to\r\nassociate myself with the statements made by the\r\nPrime Minister of Jamaica, on behalf of the Group of\r\n77 and China, and by the Prime Minister of Saint Kitts\r\nand Nevis, on behalf of the Caribbean Community, at\r\nthe special meeting on financing for development.\r\nFive years ago, we came together to share our\r\nvision of the role of the United Nations in the twenty-\r\nfirst century and adopted the Millennium Declaration.\r\nSince then, the United Nations has been confronted\r\nwith several world problems: conflicts of varying kinds\r\nrelated to humanitarian disasters, natural disasters and,\r\nof course, terrorism. Those national and global\r\nchallenges, unforeseen 60 years ago, are forcing us to\r\nthe conclusion that new and innovative ways to uphold\r\nthe purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter\r\nare required.\r\nWe are gathered here to take decisive action on\r\nthe very important issues of development, peace and\r\nsecurity, and human rights, which will affect us for a\r\nlong time to come. We share the expressed view that\r\ndevelopment, human rights, and peace and security are\r\ndependent on one another, and we applaud initiatives\r\ntaken in those areas.\r\nGrenada fully supports the proposal to effect\r\npositive change within the Secretariat and within all\r\norgans of this body. We agree that change must come,\r\nbut also that it must come with increased effectiveness.\r\nWe welcome the decisions taken in the area of\r\ndevelopment, and we commend those developed\r\ncountries that have committed themselves to the 0.7\r\nper cent target for official development assistance\r\naimed at reducing poverty and improving health and\r\neducation, as well as to trade liberalization and debt\r\nrelief to countries in need. We urge other countries to\r\nfollow suit.\r\nWe find it difficult, however, to understand the\r\ndecisions taken by the European Union concerning\r\nreform of the sugar and banana markets, which will\r\nvirtually destroy the Caribbean banana and sugar\r\nindustries and will wreak havoc on vulnerable farming\r\ncommunities and dependent groups. Those policies run\r\ncounter to the attainment of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, for small economies, particularly\r\nin the Caribbean region.\r\nDespite being faced with the major task of\r\nrebuilding our country and its economy, Grenada\r\ncontinues to remain committed and dedicated to its\r\nobligations in support of the work of this Organization.\r\nOn Tuesday, 7 September 2004, our country,\r\nGrenada, was devastated by Hurricane Ivan. Sustained\r\nwind speeds of 150 miles per hour laid waste the\r\ncountrys social and economic infrastructure and left\r\nthe population severely displaced, homeless and in a\r\nravaged state of psychological trauma. With the\r\nassistance of many friendly countries and multinational\r\nagencies, we have been able to commence the\r\nrecovery. But 10 months later, on July 14 2005, another\r\nhurricane, Emily, hit Grenada. Although, less severe,\r\nHurricane Emily wiped out the post-Ivan gains that we\r\nwere able to make in agriculture and food production,\r\n22\r\nA/60/PV.7\r\nand further severely undermined the agricultural and\r\nhousing stocks.\r\nPrior to 7 September 2004, the economy had been\r\non a path of positive economic growth driven by\r\nadvances in the tourism, agricultural, transportation\r\nand communications sectors. The setback in economic\r\nand social progress points to the vulnerability of small\r\nStates to natural disasters and the way in which several\r\ndecades of progress can be wiped out in a matter of\r\nhours.\r\nWe applaud the efforts to improve the Central\r\nEmergency Revolving Fund to strengthen the\r\neffectiveness of the United Nations humanitarian\r\nresponses, as well as the mechanisms for the use of\r\nemergency stand-by capacity for a timely response to\r\nhumanitarian emergencies. We expect that this support\r\nfor small island developing States will strengthen their\r\nability to respond more efficiently and effectively to\r\nnatural disasters and to mitigate their impacts.\r\nThe passage of those two hurricanes reversed all\r\nthe gains we had made towards achieving the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. In fact, it is now\r\nunlikely that Grenada will achieve the Goals by the\r\nyear 2015. However, with further and more aggressive\r\nassistance from the international community, Grenada\r\nwill continue to pursue its efforts to meet the Goals as\r\nsoon as possible.\r\nMay I therefore take this opportunity, on behalf\r\nof the Government and people of our country, to thank\r\nall members of this body for the kind and generous\r\nassistance granted to Grenada in the aftermath of both\r\nhurricanes. That is where we experienced the privilege\r\nof belonging to such a diverse family of nations.\r\nThe economic and fiscal situation remains a\r\nmajor challenge to our country and we therefore\r\napplaud the efforts of the International Monetary Fund\r\nin calling on the international community and donor\r\nagencies to provide more grant financing and technical\r\nassistance to support the countrys reconstruction and\r\nrebuilding efforts.\r\nAs we embark on a new era in the history of the\r\nUnited Nations, let us, as leaders, challenge ourselves,\r\nwhatever our national capacity, to work assiduously\r\ntowards the elimination of poverty, hunger,\r\ndiscrimination, war and other ills, and to make this\r\nOrganization function efficiently to meet the objectives\r\nof universal peace and progress.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Thaksin Shinawatra, Prime Minister of the\r\nKingdom of Thailand.\r\nMr. Shinawatra (Thailand): At the outset, on\r\nbehalf of the people of Thailand, let me convey our\r\ndeepest sympathy and condolences to all the people\r\nwho suffered from Hurricane Katrina. As we\r\nexperienced a similar trauma because of the tsunami,\r\nour wishes are with them all the way for speedy\r\nrecoveries.\r\nAllow me also to congratulate Ambassador\r\nEliasson on his election as President of the General\r\nAssembly at its sixtieth session. Our profound\r\nappreciation also goes to the outgoing President for the\r\nsuccessful preparation of this summit.\r\nFor many people, 60 is the age to retire, but far\r\nfrom that, the United Nations at 60 must be further\r\nrejuvenated, further strengthened or even reinvented in\r\norder to be a more effective, more efficient, more\r\ntransparent and more accountable global body to serve\r\nthe international community.\r\nOur modern world of globalization demands a\r\nUnited Nations that is dynamic in outlook, flexible in\r\nstructure, and firm in its commitment to the enduring\r\nideals for which it was created. After the cold war, the\r\nworld today is a significantly changed place,\r\ncharacterized by the pre-eminence of a single political\r\nand economic system of democracy and capitalism,\r\nwhich are two sides of the same coin.\r\nIt is generally recognized that capitalism, whose\r\nhallmark is free competition, provides the best\r\nopportunity for our peoples to pursue their dreams.\r\nHowever, free competition must also be fair.\r\nUnfortunately, not everyone is equally fit to race in the\r\nsame free competition. I equate this situation with a\r\npatient who has just been released from the intensive\r\ncare unit of a hospital being forced to run a race under\r\nthe same rules with a supremely fit athlete. It is a free\r\ncompetition, but is it also fair?\r\nIn Asia, in Latin America and in Africa, poverty\r\nalleviation must remain at the top of our agenda to\r\npromote human dignity, human rights and human\r\nsecurity, to reduce injustice and conflicts, to mitigate\r\nresentment and radicalism, and to combat violence and\r\nterrorism. However, as I have done in Thailand in the\r\nlast few years, the progress of poverty alleviation\r\n23\r\nA/60/PV.7\r\nresults from the combination of opening up\r\ninternational market access and self-help.\r\nThe ability to take part in fair trade is the\r\nopportunity for a nation to help itself. To encourage\r\nself-help, international efforts must ensure that free\r\ncompetition goes together with fair competition. The\r\nMillennium Development Goals will not be achievable\r\nsimply through the internationally committed official\r\ndevelopment assistance percentage alone. It will\r\ndepend just as much on the ability of the international\r\ncommunity to deliver a fairer system of world trade.\r\nThat must be an agenda that the United Nations reform\r\ncannot ignore.\r\nAs enshrined in our Charter, it is We the\r\npeoples whom the United Nations is representing. It is\r\ntherefore imperative that the United Nations be kept a\r\nglobal citizen-centred Organization in its perceptions,\r\nits outlooks, its tasks, its actions and its\r\nresponsibilities.\r\nOn the other hand, as we the peoples pledge our\r\nefforts to unite for a more united Organization, we\r\nmust remember to be aware that the United Nations\r\ncannot truly be united as long as its Members are\r\ndivided on the basis of domestic interests and political\r\ngains.\r\nToday, therefore, is the test of our leadership.\r\nAnd leadership starts from a realization that we must\r\nbe prepared to trade disunity for unity, narrow interests\r\nfor shared responsibility, and a bitter past in favour of a\r\nbetter future. Our leadership must accept change. Our\r\nleadership must accept that the world of globalization\r\nand the new landscape mean that there is a need to\r\nthink beyond our national boundaries for the common\r\ngood and to bring peace and prosperity to the globe.\r\nOur leadership must also show the ability to respond\r\npromptly, with compassion and generosity, to those in\r\nimmediate need, those suffering from severe starvation\r\nand those hit by famine, such as in Niger.\r\nThe revitalization of the General Assembly, the\r\nstrengthening of the Economic and Social Council to\r\nplay a more assertive role in development and the\r\nestablishment of the Peacebuilding Commission, the\r\nHuman Rights Council and the Democracy Fund may\r\nbe key reform proposals, but reform of this magnitude\r\nmust be accompanied by a major overhaul of the\r\nmanagement system. Thailand, under my\r\nadministration, has gone through major economic and\r\npolitical reforms, which were successful only because I\r\nlaunched a management reform of unprecedented scale\r\nat the same time.\r\nAs the problems of the world become more\r\ncomplex and intertwined, so do the tasks and\r\nresponsibilities of the United Nations and its agencies.\r\nFor the United Nations to be a global, citizen-centred\r\nOrganization that fulfils such tasks and for it to remain\r\nrelevant to citizens from all walks of life, improved\r\ncoordination between agencies and with countries and\r\npeople on the ground must be part of the reform.\r\nBut all of this requires total commitment, both\r\nfrom the United Nations and from all of us, the 191\r\nMembers. So, to be fair, let us ask not if the United\r\nNations can do more, but rather what more we can do\r\nfor the United Nations.\r\nReform is a process. Today, as the draft outcome\r\ndocument is endorsed, that process will begin. Its\r\nsuccess depends on the continued support of all players\r\nand the management ability of the Organizations\r\nleadership to see it through.\r\nToday We, the peoples begin the process of\r\nmillennium reform. Tomorrow, through our support,\r\nwe shall ensure that the process is implemented by a\r\nmanagement that is itself well-reformed and by a\r\nleadership well-prepared to deliver us a more global,\r\ncitizen-centred United Nations.\r\nEvery word in the document bears the fingerprint\r\nof each and every Member State. All of us have a\r\nshared responsibility to make the United Nations work.\r\nWe shall have to answer to ourselves and to future\r\ngenerations if we fail.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by Mr. Otmar Hasler, Prime\r\nMinister of the Principality of Liechtenstein.\r\nMr. Hasler (Liechtenstein): The sixtieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations coincides with the\r\nfifteenth anniversary of our membership in the\r\nOrganization. Joining the United Nations on 18\r\nSeptember 1990 was a historic step for Liechtenstein.\r\nTo this day we consider our membership a cornerstone\r\nof our national sovereignty.\r\nEffective multilateralism, as envisioned by the\r\nCharter of the United Nations, is more important than\r\never. The challenges and threats of today are manifold,\r\nand most of them require collective action based on a\r\nfunctioning international framework and the rule of\r\n24\r\nA/60/PV.7\r\nlaw. Environmental and health threats, terrorism,\r\nnatural disasters and humanitarian crises are but a few\r\nexamples that amply illustrate this fact. The United\r\nNations is the only organization that can provide the\r\nframework for such global collective action. At the\r\nsame time, todays world and the challenges it poses\r\ndiffer greatly from those for which the Organization\r\nwas originally designed. The United Nations clearly\r\nneeds new tools to address new threats, and this is the\r\nreason why we have all gathered here in New York at\r\nthe Summit level.\r\nWe welcome the fact that the original purpose of\r\nthe Summit  the review of the implementation of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals  has found a central\r\nplace in the draft outcome document. We also\r\nsubscribe fully to the underlying philosophy of the\r\ndraft outcome document that development, security and\r\nhuman rights are mutually reinforcing and\r\ninterdependent.\r\nWe had hoped that far-reaching and bold\r\ndecisions would be ready for our common agreement at\r\nthis Summit, in particular in the area of institutional\r\nchange. No less was required from us in order to make\r\nthe United Nations fit for the challenges ahead and to\r\nprevent the repetition of past mistakes, such as those\r\nthat occurred in the management of the oil-for-food\r\nprogramme. Success on the many reform issues before\r\nus is uneven. The next months must bring more\r\nprogress.\r\nEfforts to strengthen the various arms of the\r\nUnited Nations system are needed to tackle\r\ninstitutional imbalances. The strengthening of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the only universal organ of the\r\nOrganization, is one essential element in that respect.\r\nWe must therefore restore to the Assembly a central\r\nplace in our multilateral system. We are encouraged by\r\nthe efforts to make the work of the Security Council\r\nmore representative, accountable and transparent vis-à-\r\nvis todays membership.\r\nThe establishment of a Peacebuilding Commission\r\nto help countries emerging from conflicts will close an\r\ninstitutional gap. That body has the potential to improve\r\ndramatically the performance of the United Nations in\r\nthe area of conflict prevention by assisting countries to\r\nmake the transition to long-term recovery and by\r\npreventing the relapse into conflict.\r\nWe support the early conclusion of the work to\r\ndesign a Human Rights Council that reflects the central\r\nposition of human rights among the core activities of\r\nthe Organization. The agreed doubling of the resources\r\nfor the Office of the High Commissioner will help give\r\nhuman rights activities their rightful place within the\r\nUnited Nations system.\r\nOn the conceptual side, we are particularly\r\npleased that the Summit recognizes the responsibility\r\nof the international community to protect civilian\r\npopulations when Governments fail to do so. There\r\nshould have been greater advances in the areas of\r\nterrorism and the use of force, and we deplore that the\r\nSummit has failed to reach any agreement in the areas\r\nof disarmament and impunity, including on the role of\r\nthe International Criminal Court.\r\nWe have taken important decisions but fallen\r\nshort of what is necessary in some areas. We must turn\r\na corner and create a new basis for an organization that\r\nhas been experiencing difficulty in keeping up with the\r\nspeed of global change. Work on the many issues\r\nbefore us should continue with great intensity and must\r\nlead to greater real change.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency, the\r\nHonourable Ralph E. Gonsalves, Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Finance, Planning, Economic\r\nDevelopment, Labour, Information and Legal Affairs\r\nof St. Vincent and the Grenadines.\r\nMr. Gonsalves (Saint Vincent and the\r\nGrenadines): The world is paying special attention to\r\nthe United Nations at this critical juncture in its 60-\r\nyear history. We cannot afford to fail the 6 billion\r\ninhabitants of planet Earth. It cannot be business as\r\nusual. Tired diplomatic postures and ritual incantations\r\nare not what these challenging times demand. Neither\r\nan arrogant triumphalism nor a learned helplessness\r\nwill do. Let us be truly focused on the strategic issues\r\nat hand and work together to uplift our human\r\ncivilization, materially, in spirit, and in peaceful\r\nsolidarity. Let not the humbug of vanity, lodged in\r\npersonal, institutional or national spaces, encumber us\r\nin our collective quest for a better world.\r\nAs my country sees it, this High-level Plenary\r\nMeeting is required to work urgently and diligently on\r\na threefold agenda: first, to advance the development\r\nagenda in practical terms focusing on the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), and beyond them to work\r\nto achieve a sustainable condition based on the\r\nprinciples of solidarity, complementarity, equity, and\r\n25\r\nA/60/PV.7\r\nhumanitys ennoblement; secondly, to strengthen the\r\nrole of the United Nations in the management of\r\nfundamental global economic, security, social and\r\npolitical issues touching and concerning mankind; and,\r\nthirdly, to redress appropriately the systemic problems\r\nin international trade, international finance, money and\r\ntechnology transfers, financing for development, and\r\nglobal decision-making, in such a manner as to reflect\r\nthe apt, time-honoured principles of justice, equity,\r\ndemocracy, transparency, accountability and\r\ninclusiveness.\r\nIt is surely unacceptable for so many of the\r\nworlds richest nations to make repeated pledges of\r\nincreased official development assistance (ODA) and\r\nthen break them routinely, with impunity. Those rich\r\ncountries are failing woefully to meet their own\r\nsolemnly declared targets of ODA amounting to 0.7 per\r\ncent of their gross domestic product. Further, ODA is\r\noften delivered in a one-sided and discretionary way \r\nas distinct from a juridically based manner  that can\r\nbe, and frequently is, insulting to the dignity of the\r\ndonors and the recipients alike. Moreover, the\r\nassistance winds its way to the recipient country at a\r\nsnails pace, and through labyrinthine procedures,\r\nwhich evince a certain parsimony, and even cruelty.\r\nAt the same time, those developing countries that\r\nfail and/or refuse to embrace an active\r\nconstitutionalism, day-to-day democratic practices,\r\ngood governance, and internationally accepted norms\r\nof political behaviour and political hygiene, have little\r\nright to complain about the donors indifference to\r\nthem. Everyone must get his or her act together and\r\ncome to the table with clean hands.\r\nIt is evident that  principally due to the unequal\r\nand unfair system of international trade, the dominant\r\nneoliberal economic arrangements globally, the\r\ndamning neglect of poor countries by many rich ones,\r\nthe ravages of nature, and poor governance in many\r\ndeveloping countries  progress towards the\r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals\r\nhas been significantly retarded. That awful state of\r\naffairs demands appropriate action all around.\r\nExcellent ideas for progress exist but their\r\nimplementation awaits more frustratingly distant days.\r\nAt this meeting, the appropriate lead must be taken. It\r\nis the central obligation of our times. It is a great\r\ncause, and great causes have never been won by\r\nhesitant men and women.\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines is well on the\r\nway towards achieving the central MDGs. Indeed,\r\nseveral of them have been accomplished and surpassed.\r\nYet, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines remains\r\nextremely vulnerable due to its small size, limited\r\nresources, the insufficiency of its economic\r\ndiversification, its huge dependence on exports and the\r\nawesome impact of natural disasters. This vulnerability\r\nis currently being further stretched by the threat to our\r\nbanana industry as a consequence of the changing\r\nmarket regime and altered market conditions in Europe\r\nand by the massive increase in the price of oil\r\ninternationally. I call on the United Nations and its\r\nMember States to heed the plight of the poor banana\r\nfarmers and workers in the Caribbean. Specifically, I\r\nurge our dear friends the Latin American countries, the\r\nEuropean Union, the United States of America and the\r\nAfrican Caribbean and Pacific group to work together\r\ntowards a negotiated settlement of this most important\r\nissue.\r\nI am obliged to applaud President Hugo Chávez\r\nof the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela for his timely\r\nPetrocaribe initiative on the export of oil and\r\nassociated energy products on very favourable terms to\r\nthe Caribbean. This is an excellent example of South-\r\nSouth cooperation and good-neighbourliness. It\r\nresonates with the spirit of Franklin Roosevelt and\r\nSimon Bolívar.\r\nThe international community has an obligation to\r\nassist the Caribbean Community, especially the poorer\r\nand more vulnerable countries like Saint Vincent and\r\nthe Grenadines in meeting their central challenges.\r\nWhile we are pleased to have an outcome\r\ndocument for this summit, we are profoundly\r\ndisappointed that there has been a derailing of certain\r\nsatisfactory arrangements previously agreed upon by\r\nthis Organization over the past months for achieving a\r\nmore secure world, free from want, free from fear, and\r\nwith the freedom to live in dignity. There has been\r\ninsufficient boldness in the admirable quest to reform\r\nthe structure of the United Nations system.\r\nOver the past year, the list of tragedies arising\r\nfrom nature or human conduct has grown longer than\r\nusual. In the Caribbean, Hurricane Ivan laid Grenada to\r\nwaste. Enormous international assistance is still needed\r\nfor that country. Meanwhile, Haiti continues to bleed\r\nunder an undemocratic and cynical rule that does\r\n26\r\nA/60/PV.7\r\nnothing to reduce poverty. Hurricane Katrinas victims,\r\ntoo, are in our thoughts, prayers and actions.\r\nFinally, the tensions and the contradictions within\r\nthe international political system cry out for\r\nreconciliation, if not resolution. People the world over\r\nare watching and waiting on us all to produce tangible\r\nresults that touch their lives for the better. The United\r\nNations is their beacon of hope; it is their light. Let the\r\nbrightness of that light illuminate but not blind. This\r\nhumble voice from a small place so pleads!\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency The Right\r\nHonourable Paul Martin, Prime Minister of Canada.\r\nMr. Martin (Canada): The international response\r\nto the devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina\r\nreminds us once again that there are connections\r\nbetween people that have nothing to do with a common\r\nlanguage, race or creed and everything to do with the\r\nmost fundamental considerations of what it means to\r\nbe a human being, what it means to be a person with\r\nrights, needs and responsibilities towards others. This\r\nis indeed one world.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nMoreover, the document In larger freedom\r\n(A/59/2005) is eloquent in that regard: security,\r\ndevelopment and human rights, the three pillars of\r\nhuman freedom, are not abstract concepts. It is thus our\r\nresponsibility and that of all agencies and Members of\r\nthe United Nations to achieve them.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nCanada cannot conceive of the world succeeding\r\nwithout the United Nations. But make no mistake: the\r\nUnited Nations needs reform. I want to talk today\r\nabout security, development and human rights within\r\nthe context of that need for reform.\r\nSecurity represents the protection of life and thus\r\nis the basis for everything we do. That is why our\r\ndiscussions of Security Council reform are so\r\nimportant, and why there has long been an argument\r\nthat the Security Council should be more\r\nrepresentative. We agree. But we believe it is even\r\nmore important that the Council be effective. Too\r\noften, permanent members have used the veto  real\r\nor threatened  to prevent effective action. Too often,\r\nwe have debated the finer points of language while\r\ninnocent people continue to die. Darfur is only the\r\nlatest example.\r\nClearly, we need expanded guidelines for\r\nSecurity Council action. The responsibility to protect is\r\none such guideline. It seeks rules to protect the\r\ninnocent against appalling assaults on their life and on\r\ntheir dignity. It does not bless unilateral action. To the\r\ncontrary, it stands for clear, multilaterally agreed\r\ncriteria concerning what the international community\r\nshould do when civilians are at risk.\r\nThe responsibility to protect is a powerful norm\r\nof international behaviour. And this week, we have\r\ntaken a very important step towards that end. We are\r\nproud of the responsibility to protect and of its\r\nCanadian lineage. We are proud that it is now a\r\nprinciple for all the world. That being said, our\r\ncollective responsibility does not end there. I would\r\nhave hoped that we could have now agreed to make the\r\nnew Peacebuilding Commission operational. Building\r\nthe peace is a huge undertaking, and to do it well, we\r\nneed to bring order out of chaos.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThat leads me to the second pillar: economic\r\ndevelopment. Here, the record is far from brilliant.\r\nDonor countries must do more, and we have begun to\r\ndo so. But our policies most also be more consistent.\r\nWhat good comes from lamenting the lot of the poor\r\nwhile seeking to sell the maximum number of weapons\r\nto as many developing countries as possible? How can\r\nwe preach the virtues of free trade while denying least\r\ndeveloped countries access to our markets?\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nDeveloping countries must do more as well. True\r\ndevelopment will not take place until local populations\r\nhave the confidence to invest their own resources in\r\nmaking a better future for themselves. They will gain\r\nsuch confidence only when they see their Governments\r\ninvesting in areas that make a tangible difference in\r\ntheir own lives  not disproportionate military\r\nexpenditures, but investments in health, in education,\r\nin good governance and in creating an environment\r\nthat frees up the entrepreneurial spirit that exists in all\r\nour countries.\r\nWe want to see the world through the eyes of the\r\npeople we are trying to help, and we must meet\r\nbenchmarks that matter to them. How many more\r\ninfants have been vaccinated this year compared with\r\n27\r\nA/60/PV.7\r\nlast? How many more children can read and write?\r\nHow secure is a familys title to its land? How many\r\nsmall businesses have survived for more than three\r\nyears?\r\nLet me turn now to the third pillar of the United\r\nNations: respect for human rights. Our reform efforts\r\nwill ultimately fail unless they are grounded in respect\r\nfor individuals: respect for their rights; respect for their\r\ncultures, traditions and beliefs; and respect for their\r\nopinions, dissenting or not.\r\nRespect for human rights is the living heart of\r\ndemocracy, the key to unlocking the potential of every\r\nperson to contribute to his or her own welfare and to\r\nthe prosperity and security of his or her own\r\ncommunity. The United Nations Commission on\r\nHuman Rights has a serious credibility problem. Its\r\nmembership, its increasing politicization and its overall\r\nlack of effectiveness at tackling human rights\r\nviolations around the world have overwhelmed its\r\nachievements.\r\nWe need a standing body at a higher level in the\r\nUnited Nations system  one that is commensurate\r\nwith the importance of human rights. That is why we\r\nsupport the proposal for an effective human rights\r\ncouncil. I cannot disguise Canadas profound\r\ndisappointment that we were not able to agree at this\r\nsummit on all of the elements required to make such a\r\ncouncil operational. Let me assure members that\r\nCanada will not cease actively to promote bringing into\r\nbeing a standing council with credible membership\r\ncriteria. In the meantime, we welcome the universal\r\nendorsement of the work of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights, Louise Arbour, and\r\nour collective decision to double the resources\r\navailable to her Office.\r\nI have talked about the three pillars. Each poses\r\nits own unique challenges. But there is also one\r\nelement common to all three: we need new and\r\ninnovative approaches to global challenges \r\napproaches to which every country contributes and as a\r\nresult of which every country shares in the benefits.\r\nA striking example of that is climate change. This\r\nNovember, Canada will host the United Nations\r\nConference on Climate Change. Our goal is clear:\r\nclimate change is real, and the world must recognize it;\r\nhuman activity is a defining cause, and the world must\r\nact on it.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nOur mandate in Montreal will be twofold: first,\r\nthe signatories of the Kyoto accord must build on it by\r\nmaking further progress on the commitments already\r\nundertaken; then, in order to achieve genuine and\r\nsubstantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, we\r\nmust work on creating a global regime.\r\nAs the Secretary-General has observed, the\r\nUnited Nations is at a crossroads. If United Nations\r\nreform is to be lasting and effective, the Organization\r\nmust thoroughly reform its administration and its\r\nmanagement methods, and create verification\r\nmechanisms with more muscle. Such reform is crucial.\r\nWe want to work with other Member States and with\r\nthe Secretary-General to ensure that this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly endorses a set of reforms that meet\r\nthe requirements of the twenty-first century.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nLet me simply say in conclusion that the status\r\nquo and, too often, the empty rhetoric must make way\r\nhere for a new, effective and pragmatic multilateralism\r\nmeasured by concrete results. Our citizens want\r\nsecurity based on international law. They want\r\nopportunity based on more effective aid. They want\r\nempowerment based on respect for human rights. And\r\nthey want a clean environment. Those are not utopian\r\ndreams; they are among the most urgent challenges we\r\nface as a world. All of us here  representatives  are\r\nnational leaders. In todays world, we cannot serve our\r\nown interests well unless we rise above narrow\r\nnational interests. If we fail to act responsibly on the\r\nworld stage, we will fail our own people at home.\r\nIt is one world. That simple statement finds its\r\nmost profound expression here, in our hopes for the\r\nUnited Nations. We face difficult decisions, but with\r\ncourage and vision we can build a United Nations for\r\nthe future, a United Nations that serves all the worlds\r\npeople, because that is the best way to serve every\r\nsingle one of us.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Andranik Margaryan, Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Armenia.\r\nMr. Margaryan (Armenia) (spoke in Russian): I\r\nshould like first of all to congratulate Mr. Jan Eliasson\r\non his election as President of the General Assembly at\r\nits sixtieth session.\r\n28\r\nA/60/PV.7\r\nFive years have passed since heads of State or\r\nGovernment adopted the Millennium Declaration here\r\nin the General Assembly, thereby committing\r\nthemselves to attaining the Millennium Development\r\nGoals (MDGs). By signing on to the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, Armenia included the development goals\r\nin its long-term strategy programmes. With the\r\nassistance of various international organizations, in\r\nAugust 2003 the Armenian Government adopted a\r\nstrategic poverty reduction programme.\r\nThat programme includes measures aimed at\r\nachieving the MDGs and in keeping with the\r\ndevelopment strategy of our country. It takes our\r\nspecific national characteristics into account and\r\nenjoys broad support from both civil society and\r\ninternational organizations.\r\nTerrorism remains the greatest threat to\r\nhumankind. Acts of terrorism  in the United States\r\non 11 September 2001, in Beslan, in Madrid, in\r\nLondon and in other parts of the world  make it clear\r\nthat States must act in close cooperation, uniting their\r\nefforts to combat that scourge. Armenia strongly\r\ncondemns terrorism in all its manifestations.\r\nWe welcome the efforts of the Secretary-General\r\naimed at preventing acts of genocide in the future. In\r\nthis connection, I would like in particular to underline\r\nthe importance of including, in the outcome document\r\nof the summit, the concept of the responsibility to\r\nprotect populations against genocide, war crimes,\r\nethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.\r\nThe international community must make every\r\neffort to prevent genocide. Armenians, as a people who\r\nexperienced the first genocide of the twentieth century,\r\nknow full well the horror of genocide.\r\nOne of the guarantees of security and stability in\r\nour region is the peaceful settlement of regional\r\nconflicts. Armenia remains committed to the peaceful\r\nresolution of the Nagorny Karabakh conflict. The\r\npeople of Nagorny Karabakh have exercised their right\r\nto self-determination, in accordance with the principles\r\nof international law, just as that right has been\r\nexercised in recent years by certain countries\r\nrepresented here. We are convinced that only mutual\r\nrespect and tolerance and the will to recognize\r\nhistorical truth will secure peaceful and good-\r\nneighbourly relations in our region.\r\nRegional cooperation is extremely important in\r\nbuilding mutual trust in the southern Caucasus.\r\nUnfortunately, that is hampered by the embargo\r\nimposed on Armenia, as well as by the unwillingness\r\nof some countries in our region to engage in such\r\ncooperation.\r\nArmenia supports efforts to reform the United\r\nNations, especially those aimed at enhancing and\r\nstrengthening the role of the General Assembly,\r\ncreating a Human Rights Council and increasing the\r\neffectiveness of the working methods of the Security\r\nCouncil. We are convinced that a reformed United\r\nNations will be able to withstand successfully the ever-\r\nincreasing challenges of our modern-day world.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency The\r\nHonourable Maatia Toafa, Prime Minister and Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs and Labour of Tuvalu.\r\nMr. Toafa (Tuvalu): The people of Tuvalu extend\r\ntheir deepest sympathy to the people and the\r\nGovernment of the United States of America on the\r\ntragic loss they have suffered as a result of Hurricane\r\nKatrina. Our thoughts and prayers are with them as\r\nthey recover from the calamitous effects of the disaster.\r\nWe are meeting together, in this great Assembly\r\nHall of the United Nations, because we are confronted\r\nwith enormous challenges and because we have been\r\nentrusted by all of our citizens with the task of\r\ncollectively agreeing on actions to address those\r\nchallenges.\r\nThe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)\r\nhave been set as an ambitious pathway for eradicating\r\npoverty  a pathway that should also lead to ensuring\r\nlong-term sustainable development, peace and security\r\nin all countries of the world.\r\nTuvalu commends the extensive reports on the\r\nachievement of this pathway and the work on the\r\noutcome document for the High-level Plenary Meeting.\r\nWe sincerely thank the outgoing General Assembly\r\nPresident, Mr. Jean Ping, for his sterling leadership in\r\npreparing the document for our summit.\r\nThere is no doubt that much has been achieved\r\nover the past five years. The goodwill of the\r\ninternational community to complement national\r\nefforts in this process is greatly appreciated.\r\n29\r\nA/60/PV.7\r\nHowever, much more remains to be done. As we\r\nhave observed, the poverty statistics in many regions\r\nare discouraging, particularly with regard to sanitation,\r\naccess to safe drinking water, child mortality,\r\nchildcare, environmental degradation and access to\r\nbasic quality education. There is also a need to\r\nimprove access to sexual and reproductive healthcare,\r\nparticularly in relation to maternal health and\r\nHIV/AIDS.\r\nIn many least developed countries, including\r\nTuvalu, the achievement of the MDGs is not on course.\r\nWe are hampered by a lack of access to financial and\r\ntechnical assistance, a lack of human and\r\ninfrastructural capacity and, unfortunately, a lack of\r\nattention and coordination. The least developed\r\ncountries need financial and technical assistance, and\r\nwe therefore appeal for full and effective\r\nimplementation of the Brussels Programme of Action\r\nfor the Least Developed Countries.\r\nTuvalu supports the recommendations in the\r\nSecretary-Generals report, In larger freedom\r\n(A/59/2005), relating to the importance of global\r\nsecurity. But in focusing on that issue we cannot allow\r\nunilateralist political agendas to divert attention from\r\nother security issues and the main MDG task of\r\neradicating poverty. Global security must be advanced\r\non a multilateral and multidimensional basis. We must\r\nfocus attention on poverty eradication and sustainable\r\ndevelopment, as these tasks are fundamental if we are\r\nto ensure global peace and security and human rights\r\nfor all.\r\nTuvalu supports the reforms proposed for the\r\nUnited Nations, including the expansion of the\r\npermanent and non-permanent membership of the\r\nSecurity Council and the review of the Councils\r\nworking methods and the rationalization of the General\r\nAssemblys work. We reaffirm our view that Japan,\r\nGermany, Brazil and India should be considered for\r\npermanent membership in an expanded Council. We\r\nalso support the call for the establishment of a Human\r\nRights Council in recognition of the centrality of\r\nhuman rights as a founding pillar among the ideals of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nThere is a much broader security issue, relating to\r\nenvironmental security. As we live in a very fragile\r\nisland environment, our long-term security and\r\nsustainable development are closely linked to the\r\nissues of climate change, the preservation of\r\nbiodiversity and the management of our limited forests\r\nand water resources.\r\nAs witnessed the world over, a natural disaster\r\nsuch as a cyclone, made worse by the effects of climate\r\nchange, can have a devastating effect on economies\r\nand lives. For Tuvalu, the effects are frightening.\r\nThose are the security issues to which we believe the\r\nUnited Nations should be paying more attention.\r\nSmall island developing States such as Tuvalu\r\nface a number of other unique challenges, which are\r\nwell-acknowledged and highlighted in the Mauritius\r\nStrategy for the Further Implementation of the\r\nProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development\r\nof Small Island Developing States. The full and\r\neffective implementation of the Strategy is key to those\r\nStates attaining the MDGs and sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nWe are making every effort to ensure our own\r\nsustainable development. Last year, my Government\r\nheld a national conference to map out a national\r\ndevelopment strategy based on the principles of\r\nsustainable development and closely linked to the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. The strategy\r\ndocument that resulted from that conference, called Te\r\nKakeega II, provides my Government with a good\r\nassessment of the progress made in meeting the MDGs\r\nand of what further action is needed.\r\nBut there are global issues that are beyond our\r\ncontrol, on which Tuvalu needs the supporting hand of\r\nregional bodies in the Pacific and of the international\r\ncommunity. There is also great need of a physical\r\npresence of the United Nations in isolated small island\r\ndeveloping States such as Tuvalu, and we call for the\r\nSecretariat to give special consideration to that need.\r\nWe are hopeful that this Summits draft outcome\r\ndocument will be the vehicle needed to further advance\r\nour efforts to reach the MDGs and ensure sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nFinally, the achievement of the MDGs is not\r\npossible without the full participation of all\r\ndevelopment partners. Recognizing the contribution of\r\nthe Republic of China to international development and\r\nnoting its economic and democratic reforms, we\r\nsupport its inclusion as a partner in our joint\r\ncollaborative efforts and as a United Nations Member.\r\nGod bless the United Nations. God bless Tuvalu.\r\n30\r\nA/60/PV.7\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Mari\r\nBin Almude Alkatiri, Prime Minister of the Democratic\r\nRepublic of Timor-Leste.\r\nMr. Alkatiri (Timor-Leste): At the outset, I\r\nwould like to express the solidarity of the Timorese\r\npeople with the victims of Hurricane Katrina and with\r\nthe people and the Government of the United States.\r\nIt is my great pleasure to be here today to share\r\nwith the Assembly the progress and the steps taken so\r\nfar in Timor-Leste to achieve the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. The history of Timor-Leste has\r\nshown us that the spirit and dedication of the Timorese\r\npeople are not easily defeated. The fundamental values\r\nof peace, security and freedom ensured by the United\r\nNations are also held dearly by the Timorese, reflecting\r\nour strength in building Timor-Leste to become a\r\nstrong and sustainable nation. In these three short years\r\nas a sovereign country, we have made significant\r\nprogress towards the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nHealth, education, gender equality and good\r\ngovernance remain among the key priorities of the\r\nGovernment of Timor-Leste. Our Constitution\r\nexpressly states the need for the family, the community\r\nand the State to provide special protection for children\r\nand recognizes the child as an individual entitled to\r\nspecial individual rights. It also affirms the childs\r\nentitlement to the rights enshrined in international\r\ntreaties and conventions ratified by Timor-Leste in\r\nDecember 2002.\r\nThe Government continues to prioritize the social\r\nsectors, in line with the great interest expressed by our\r\ncitizens during the process of developing our national\r\ndevelopment plan. The countrys health indicators are\r\nthe lowest in East Asia. The Government is making\r\nefforts to procure and ensure the distribution to all\r\nhealth facilities of essential drugs and equipment for\r\nantenatal and postnatal care and for the effective\r\nmanagement of childhood illnesses. My Government\r\nhas adopted a reproductive health policy that aims to\r\nreduce maternal and neonatal mortality through social\r\nmobilization to increase the use of health services by\r\npregnant women and to promote vaccination against\r\nmaternal and neonatal tetanus. Over the past decade,\r\nthe infant mortality rate has been reduced from 126 to\r\n60 deaths per 1,000 live births.\r\nSince 2000, the Government has been able to\r\nimplement four school years at all levels of the\r\neducational ladder. Schooling has been extended to\r\nmore than three quarters of the 285,000 school age\r\nchildren in the country. Currently operational projects\r\naddress grass-roots needs in education. These include\r\nthe training of school principals and teachers; the\r\ndevelopment of active, participatory learning; the\r\npromotion of accountability, democratic decision-\r\nmaking and transparency through the effective\r\nutilization of the school budget; the establishment of\r\nparent-teacher associations; and the development of\r\nmodels for school-based management.\r\nAn education management information system\r\nhas been established; it contains information on\r\napproximately 90 per cent of all primary schools in\r\nTimor-Leste. The Government is focusing on skills\r\neducation for adolescents and preventive HIV/AIDS\r\neducation. That strengthens the capacities of young\r\npeople, communities and service providers, thus\r\nensuring informed decision-making and appropriate\r\nskills, which contributes to the prevention of HIV\r\ninfection among young people both in and out of\r\nschool. Also, a national youth policy is being\r\ndeveloped by the Government with the support of\r\nUNICEF and the World Bank.\r\nGood governance is also a priority of Timor-\r\nLeste. Transparency and accountability are two\r\nimportant factors for democracy. They also enable\r\ncitizens to participate actively in the countrys\r\ndevelopment. Timor-Leste has taken measures to\r\nprevent corruption and mismanagement. My\r\nGovernment and our people are fully committed to\r\nensuring that resources are used as efficiently as\r\npossible. A petroleum fund, aimed at managing and\r\navoiding corruption and the mismanagement of\r\nrevenues from oil and gas, has been established,\r\nfollowing wide consultation with civil society and the\r\nmost important institutions of the country.\r\nThe Provedor for Human Rights and Justice \r\nthe Ombudsman  has been sworn in and has\r\nlaunched his initiatives for the current year. The Office\r\nof the Inspector General has launched a website with\r\nsummary reports of its investigations, underlining the\r\nGovernments dedication to transparency. This is\r\nanother institution that promotes transparency and\r\nprevents corruption.\r\nThe Government of Timor-Leste has taken\r\nmeasures aimed at improving the justice system in\r\norder to ensure access to justice for all and to prevent\r\n31\r\nA/60/PV.7\r\nimpunity from taking root. With the new Civil Service\r\nAct in place, we are working hard to instil values of\r\nexcellence and integrity.\r\nGender equality is a principle that is promoted\r\nwidely in the country. More than one third of the seats\r\nin our National Parliament and one quarter of\r\nGovernment posts are held by women, as is the case\r\nwith other important institutions, and, for the first time,\r\nwomen head up community-level authority structures.\r\nTimor-Leste is aware of the need for and\r\nimportance of international and regional cooperation in\r\ncontributing to peace, stability and economic\r\ndevelopment in the world. It is in this context that we\r\nare a member of the Regional Forum of the Association\r\nof Southeast Asian Nations and other international and\r\nregional organizations.\r\nWe are also aware that to reach the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals we must have the capacity to\r\nexecute the programmes aimed at reaching those\r\nGoals. So, institutional building is of paramount\r\nimportance.\r\nFinally, I would like to express, on behalf of the\r\nTimorese people and on my own account, our sincere\r\ngratitude to His Excellency the Secretary-General, our\r\nfriend Kofi Annan, for the support that he has given to\r\nour people.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Carlos\r\nGomes, Jr., Prime Minister of the Republic of Guinea-\r\nBissau.\r\nMr. Gomes (Guinea-Bissau) (spoke in\r\nPortuguese; interpretation from French text provided\r\nby the delegation): First and foremost, I would like to\r\nreiterate to the Government and the people of the\r\nUnited States our sympathy on the loss of human lives\r\nand the enormous material damage caused by\r\nHurricane Katrina.\r\nFive years after the adoption of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, and at a time when we are celebrating the\r\nsixtieth anniversary of the founding of the United\r\nNations, we still have doubts and questions about the\r\nreal possibility of poor countries attaining the\r\nMillennium Development Goals by 2015. We also have\r\nquestions about the existence of a real and effective\r\npartnership between rich countries and the most\r\nunderprivileged, as well as about whether there exists\r\nan unequivocal political will on the part of the\r\ninternational community to respect commitments it has\r\nmade.\r\nConsideration of the very slow steps taken so far\r\nforces us to recognize that much has yet to be done to\r\nact upon the decisions taken over the past decade. I\r\nwould like to thank the Secretary-General for his\r\ntimely initiative to organize this High-level Meeting to\r\ntake stock of progress made on the commitments\r\ncontained in the Millennium Declaration, and for the\r\nconcrete, realistic and constructive proposals that he\r\nhas submitted for consideration and approval by\r\nMember States to improve and to strengthen our\r\nOrganization as well as its role in a world confronted\r\nwith old and new challenges, such as international\r\nterrorism.\r\nThe draft outcome document submitted for\r\napproval to this High-level Meeting is the fruit of\r\ncommendable and concerted effort under the\r\nexemplary and effective guidance of the outgoing\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth\r\nsession, His Excellency Mr. Jean Ping. While there is\r\nroom for improvement, the document offers some\r\ncourageous and innovative solutions that are within\r\nreach, as long as the international shows the interest.\r\nHowever, we believe that we must do our utmost,\r\ncollectively and in a concerted way, to save human\r\nlives everywhere and in all circumstances where this is\r\nrequired. Likewise, at both the national and the\r\ninternational levels, we must spare no effort to\r\nguarantee the full enjoyment of human rights, the\r\npromotion of democracy and good governance, the\r\nprotection of the environment and the rational use of\r\nour planets resources to achieve sustainable\r\ndevelopment for our countries.\r\nWe are aware that the responsibility falls first and\r\nforemost to us to ensure the development of our\r\ncountries and the creation of the best possible\r\nconditions for our peoples. However, given the nature\r\nand complexity of the difficulties that most of us face,\r\ninternational assistance is indispensable, due to the\r\nlack of adequate financial, human and material\r\nresources in most developing countries. We believe\r\nthat this High-level Meeting could lead to specific\r\ndecisions that would make it possible by 2015, if not to\r\ncompletely eliminate, then perhaps to reduce\r\nconsiderably, the number of poor countries in the\r\nworld, to guarantee access to drinking water and\r\neducation without discrimination against women and\r\n32\r\nA/60/PV.7\r\ngirls and, in particular, to reduce maternal and infant\r\nmortality, guarantee gender equality and fight endemic\r\ndiseases such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria,\r\nwhich continue to ravage African countries.\r\nWe all recognize that many speeches have been\r\nmade here and elsewhere on the issue of development.\r\nWe believe it is very important to act in a concerted\r\nand determined way at the world level. My country,\r\nGuinea-Bissau, is on the point of concluding a process\r\nto return to constitutional normality with the recent\r\nholding of presidential elections. This was possible\r\nthanks to internal efforts and technical, material and\r\nfinancial assistance provided by the countries of our\r\nsubregion within the framework of the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS), and by\r\nmembers of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking\r\nCountries, the European Union, the African Union and\r\nthe United Nations system.\r\nFrom this rostrum I would like to confirm that the\r\nstanding commission of the Peoples National\r\nAssembly of Guinea-Bissau has set the date of\r\n1 October 2005 to inaugurate the president-elect. We\r\nare seriously committed to taking into account and\r\nmobilizing our countrys human and material potential\r\nto further its development. We will do everything to\r\nestablish an effective and lasting partnership with all\r\nmembers of the international community in order to\r\ngain further their fraternal understanding, their\r\ninvaluable solidarity and their constant support in\r\npursuing the Millennium Development Goals,\r\nespecially with regard to improving our peoples living\r\nconditions.\r\nWith this in mind, our authorities have developed\r\ntheir own national Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper\r\nwhich serves as a basis for organizing a round table on\r\nGuinea-Bissau scheduled for the end of the year. We\r\nwould like to be able to count on the support and\r\ncontribution of all our development partners to ensure\r\nthat this event will be successful. Its success is\r\nnecessary to create the conditions for re-launching our\r\neconomy, for ensuring national reconciliation and for\r\nbuilding peace and stability.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency,\r\nMr. Ricardo Alarcón de Quesada, President of the\r\nNational Assembly of the Peoples Power of the\r\nRepublic of Cuba.\r\nMr. Alarcón de Quesada (Cuba) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): We have been brought together to review the\r\nprogress made in complying with the commitments\r\ncontained in the Millennium Declaration and those\r\nderived from major United Nations conferences and\r\nhigh-level plenary meetings, but that purpose has been\r\ncompletely distorted.\r\nThere were eight goals and 18 targets  quite\r\nmodest ones, actually  that were to be achieved in\r\nmost cases by 2015. The goals are to eradicate extreme\r\npoverty and hunger, achieve universal primary\r\neducation, promote gender equality and empower\r\nwomen, reduce child mortality, improve maternal\r\nhealth, combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases,\r\nensure environmental sustainability and develop a\r\nglobal partnership for development.\r\nVery little has been done to achieve those goals.\r\nIn the case of several goals, there has been an outright\r\ndeterioration.\r\nThat was what we were to discuss here today so\r\nthat we could take resolute and urgent steps that would\r\nallow us to move forward. That was our obligation at\r\nthis High-level Plenary Meeting.\r\nBut we are confronted with an unforgivable\r\nsham. The purpose of this meeting was kidnapped\r\nthrough tortuous manipulations. Those who fancy\r\nthemselves owners of the world do not even want to\r\nremember those promises, which were proclaimed with\r\nhypocritical bragging.\r\nWhat is worse, they seek to impose an alleged\r\nreform of the United Nations that merely intends to\r\nsubjugate the Organization completely and transform it\r\ninto an instrument of their worldwide dictatorship.\r\nThey would have war and hegemony become\r\nnorms that the whole world should abide by without\r\nquestioning. Along the way, with the help of\r\nsubmissive coryphées, they tear up the Charter, seek to\r\nreduce the Secretariat to a servile tool and insult the\r\nAssembly and the world so that the Organization\r\nrepresents them and only them.\r\nIn the name of what? In the name of a power\r\nwhose limits they cannot see because of their\r\nignorance? Because of a phony war on terrorism that\r\nmassacres entire populations and takes thousands of\r\nyoung North Americans to their death? A policy that\r\nmeanwhile cynically protects a convicted and\r\nconfessed terrorist like Luis Posada Carriles and keeps\r\n33\r\nA/60/PV.7\r\nfive innocent people in prison, punishing them because\r\nthey did combat terrorism in violation of the very laws\r\nof the United States of America?\r\nGreed, selfishness and irrationality will visit\r\ncatastrophe upon us, from which those who refuse to\r\naccept a different world born of solidarity and justice\r\nwill not be spared.\r\nA world without hunger or poverty; one that\r\noffers everyone a healthy life, education and dignity; a\r\nworld free from oppression and discrimination, without\r\nwar or genocidal blockades, where the exploitation of\r\nthe weak has been eliminated.\r\nAlthough the powerful pretend not to believe it,\r\nthe poor have the right to development and will\r\ncontinue to fight for it.\r\nThey will continue to seek it beyond these walls,\r\noutside of this Hall. Despite the blockade, the\r\nharassment and threats, the Bolivarian Alternative for\r\nLatin America and the Caribbean looms large, the\r\nresult of the longstanding leadership and generosity of\r\nPresident Hugo Chávez Frías, whose accusation here\r\nyesterday reflected the aspirations of the people; an\r\naccusation that we fully support.\r\nThe Bolivarian Alternative for Latin America and\r\nthe Caribbean is exemplary of the solidarity that brings\r\nhope to many, proposes true integration and\r\ndevelopment and ushers in a better world that we know\r\nhow to fight for. The new dawn is advancing from the\r\nSouth.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Eduardo Stein Barillas, Vice-President of the\r\nRepublic of Guatemala.\r\nMr. Stein Barillas (Guatemala): Five years ago,\r\nheads of State and Government met in this Hall and\r\nagreed upon a number of historic goals, summarized in\r\nthe Millennium Declaration.\r\nWe are now gathered once again to assess the\r\nachievements and shortcomings in fulfilling our\r\ncommitment to address, comprehensively, the triple\r\nchallenge of advancing development, providing\r\nsecurity to all our citizens and consolidating\r\ndemocracy and respect for human rights.\r\nAs we know, the general goals contained in the\r\nMillennium Declaration have been laid down in\r\nnumerous United Nations global conferences and\r\nsummarized in the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nThose goals are a true source of democratic pride\r\nfor us. They fully coincide with those outlined in the\r\npeace agreements signed in Guatemala in December\r\n1996 and those contained in the Governments action\r\nplan.\r\nWe have prepared a report containing our\r\nevaluation on Guatemalas progress along the road\r\ntowards achieving those goals. Without going into\r\ndetail, I can state that in Guatemala, as in many\r\ndeveloping countries, the panorama is a mixture of\r\nbright and dull spots.\r\nIn Guatemala, there has been significant progress\r\nduring the past 18 months in the fields of education,\r\nhealth, child nutrition and in the construction of the\r\ninstitutions supporting development. This progress still\r\ndoes not appear in most of the multilateral reports\r\nbased on data from several years ago.\r\nAt the same time, we recognize that we have not\r\nprogressed sufficiently in combating poverty. Almost\r\nten years after having signed the peace agreements and\r\nin the context of a process that has been overall\r\nsuccessful, we still face challenges in consolidating of\r\nthe rule of law and promoting democracy.\r\nIt is for that reason that we have made special\r\nefforts to consolidate the progress already achieved and\r\nto accelerate our dealing with the many obstacles that\r\nhinder speedier economic growth and the consolidation\r\nof a system of democratic government that is\r\nparticipatory and inclusive. We have formulated and\r\nare now implementing a programme for reactivating\r\nthe economy and society, combining more dynamic\r\ngrowth with increased attention to providing social\r\nservices and job creation, all with the aim of reducing\r\npoverty and hunger.\r\nOur policies are geared towards the most\r\nvulnerable, including the rural population and\r\nindigenous peoples. We have exerted considerable\r\neffort to advance rural development and in these past\r\nweeks have adopted a public agenda for indigenous\r\npeoples based on the principles of inclusion and\r\nmulticulturalism.\r\nI can also confirm that our Government is\r\npromoting the advancement of the women. One\r\nexample is in the area of primary education, where the\r\n34\r\nA/60/PV.7\r\ndisparity between girls and boys is rapidly becoming\r\nless marked.\r\nIndeed, our concern for the vulnerable population\r\nof Guatemala extends beyond our borders to include\r\nthose Guatemalans that have migrated abroad  some\r\n11 per cent of our population.\r\nMoreover, we are firmly committed to\r\nshouldering our responsibility to promote our own\r\ndevelopment. Nevertheless, we also trust that the\r\ninternational system will offer conditions that will\r\nmake it easier to combine the domestic efforts of our\r\ncountries with a genuine partnership with the main\r\ndeveloped economies of the world, particularly in the\r\nareas of trade, financing and the application of\r\ntechnology. We need access to markets and require\r\nboth public and private foreign financing to\r\ncomplement our own domestic efforts, which have now\r\nbeen made even more complicated by the\r\nunprecedented rise in the price of fuel.\r\nWe are at the same time eager to strengthen our\r\ncooperation with other countries. Particularly\r\nnoteworthy here are the Latin American Conference on\r\nChronic Hunger held in Guatemala four days ago and\r\nthe decision taken by the Governments of the Central\r\nAmerican Integration System and Brazil to propose to\r\nthe rest of the region an initiative to ensure a Latin\r\nAmerica free from hunger.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration also refers, in\r\nchapter VIII, to strengthening the United Nations. In\r\nview of time constraints, I shall confine myself to the\r\nfollowing points in that regard.\r\nWe reiterate our full support for the United\r\nNations, an institution we consider indispensable if\r\nfuture challenges are to be met. We recognize the\r\npressing need to adapt the Organization to the\r\nconditions of the twenty-first century. We support the\r\nglobal strategy against terrorism proposed by the\r\nSecretary-General. We also support the creation of the\r\nproposed peacebuilding commission, in view of our\r\nown national experience since 1996. We support the\r\nestablishment of a Human Rights Council and the\r\nstrengthening of the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights. We believe it is the\r\nprimary and primordial responsibility of each State to\r\nprotect its population and for that reason we fully\r\nsupport the concept of the responsibility to protect. We\r\nshare the view that the General Assembly should be\r\nrestored to its central role as the chief policymaking\r\nbody within the Organization. We agree that the\r\nEconomic and Social Council should be converted into\r\nthe principal body for analysing development issues.\r\nWe support the expansion of the Security Council\r\nthrough the addition of a limited number of new\r\nmembers, both permanent and non-permanent, so as to\r\nbalance the need for flexibility in its functioning with\r\nthat of making it more representative. Finally, we\r\nregret that the opportunity to make progress in the area\r\nof nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament was\r\nmissed.\r\nMy delegation will elaborate on these ideas in the\r\ncourse of the general debate that will shortly take place\r\nin the General Assembly.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Highness Shaikh\r\nSalman bin Hamad Al-Khalifa, Crown Prince and\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Bahrain Defence Force of\r\nthe Kingdom of Bahrain.\r\nShaikh Salman bin Hamad Al-Khalifa\r\n(Bahrain) (spoke in Arabic): I have the honour to\r\nconvey to all participants the greetings of the King of\r\nBahrain, Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa, and his best wishes\r\nfor the success of this conference.\r\nIt is our great honour and pleasure to participate\r\nin this High-level Meeting at the United Nations,\r\nwhich is celebrating its sixtieth anniversary at the start\r\nof the twenty-first century, by launching the\r\nmillennium initiative  a plan whereby we hope to\r\nachieve new prospects for international cooperation\r\nwithin an unshakeable United Nations system that\r\nreinforces collective security and an international order\r\nin which the choices of all nation States are respected.\r\nMay I take this historic opportunity to reaffirm\r\nthe Kingdom of Bahrains adherence to the purposes\r\nand principles of the United Nations, as enshrined in\r\nthe Charter, and its commitment to the\r\nrecommendations that will be adopted during this\r\nmeeting, which re-emphasize the importance of the\r\nhistoric and legal responsibilities of the United Nations\r\nto build peace, achieve collective security and speed up\r\nthe development process, as well as reinforcing the role\r\nof the United Nations while promoting human rights\r\nand the rule of law.\r\nWe concur with the Secretary-Generals report\r\n(A/59/2005) that there is a direct link between\r\ndevelopment, security and human rights. We believe\r\n35\r\nA/60/PV.7\r\nthat this Organization can address those needs and\r\nprepare the ground for putting into effect the valuable\r\nrecommendations set out in the Secretary-Generals\r\nreport, as major goals of the United Nations.\r\nWhile the United Nations has achieved much\r\nover the past six decades, it has faced many obstacles\r\nand challenges, especially at this current historic\r\njuncture. Indeed todays international context and\r\nchallenges are unprecedented and include poverty,\r\nhunger, epidemic diseases, the serious threat posed to\r\nall humanity by weapons of mass destruction, and the\r\nspread of civil war and terrorism  which has become\r\none of the most dangerous challenges facing the\r\ninternational community today, and which requires\r\nconcerted international efforts and cooperation to\r\neradicate it.\r\nTo avoid conflicts and strife within countries, we\r\nbelieve in raising religious beliefs above politics, and\r\nkeeping them beyond day-to-day disagreements based\r\non changing interests, so that religious beliefs or\r\nethnicity are not misused for political ends. While\r\npolitics is constantly on the move, beliefs and ethnic\r\norigins are inherited and unchanging.\r\nToday more than ever, our Organization is in\r\nneed of reform. The main bodies of the United Nations\r\nmust be restructured to enhance its effectiveness, make\r\nit more democratic and representative of its 191\r\nMembers. The Security Council does not reflect\r\npresent international realities and therefore should be\r\nexpanded and its working methods reviewed to\r\nenhance its transparency.\r\nDevelopment requires the establishment of a just\r\nmultilateral trading system, worthy of the vital role of\r\ninternational commerce. It is therefore important that\r\nwe honour the content of the Doha Round, as\r\nreconfirmed by the Executive Council of the World\r\nTrade Organization on 1 August 2004, in accordance\r\nwith the Monterrey Consensus.\r\nThis historic Summit of the United Nations, with\r\nthe wide participation of world leaders, is an\r\nopportunity not to be missed to fulfil the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals and to renew our commitment to\r\nachieving those Goals by the year 2015.\r\nToday, we are called upon to increase our efforts\r\nto achieve those basic human goals through the\r\nparticipation of both civil society and the private sector\r\nin implementing the international communitys\r\nDevelopment Goals and realizing the aspirations for\r\nprogress, knowledge and reconstruction of peoples\r\nthroughout the world. Such goals animate peoples\r\nhopes and ambitions for freedom and a dignified life\r\nwithin an integrated partnership intended to give all a\r\nprosperous future through cooperation, coexistence,\r\nand advancement.\r\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain remains committed to\r\nits principles, will continue on the path of reform and\r\nopenness in order to achieve its sustainable\r\ndevelopment goals, enhance the values of tolerance and\r\ndialogue among all, without violence or bias, and will\r\nparticipate effectively in the establishment of security,\r\nstability and peace throughout the world.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Eminence Angelo\r\nCardinal Sodano, Secretary of State of the Holy See.\r\nCardinal Sodano (Holy See) (spoke in French): I\r\nhave the honour of conveying the cordial greetings of\r\nPope Benedict XVI, to the Co-Chairpersons and to the\r\nheads of State or Government gathered here.\r\nI would like my voice to echo the voices of\r\nCatholics throughout the world who see the United\r\nNations as an institution that is ever more necessary for\r\npeace and the progress of all humankind.\r\nSixty years have passed since the birth of the\r\nOrganization destined to implement the principal goals\r\nproclaimed in the Preamble of its Charter. Over the\r\nyears, much has been done in the service of\r\nhumankind. However, this Organization, like all things\r\nhuman, has shown signs of wear over the years. It now\r\nseems to all that it must be renewed in order to respond\r\nto the great challenges of the present.\r\nClearly, the United Nations is not a super-\r\ngovernment. Rather, it is the result of the political will\r\nof each of its Member States. Ordinary people say to\r\nthe leaders of nations: give us a modern institution able\r\nto take decisions and ensure that they are enforced.\r\nThis is the appeal of men and women discouraged by\r\nso many promises made but not kept and by decisions\r\nadopted but not enforced. May their cry give us the\r\nfirm determination to undertake an institutional reform\r\nof the United Nations that responds to the real demands\r\nof our peoples rather than to the balancing of power.\r\nThe long history of peacekeeping operations,\r\nwith its failures and successes, provide a wealth of\r\nexperience with which to develop means of action able\r\n36\r\nA/60/PV.7\r\nto resolve the conflicts of the future. In that context,\r\nthe Holy See favours the creation of a body that\r\nrestores peace in countries that have suffered armed\r\nconflict. The Holy See thus favours the creation of the\r\nPeacebuilding Commission, which could lay out an\r\nambitious strategy for overcoming the factors of ethnic\r\nrivalry which are the root cause of conflicts and can\r\nalways reignite them.\r\nThe tragedies that have taken place in the\r\nBalkans, the Middle East and Africa must lead us to\r\nreflect. Our current commitment to creating a culture\r\nof conflict prevention is important, but we should also\r\nmore thoroughly explore the problem of the use of\r\nforce to disarm aggressors. The responsibility to\r\nprotect is born of a very important political and legal\r\nconcept that has gradually been enhanced over the 60\r\nyears of the existence of the United Nations. Its core\r\nessence derives from the fact that the dignity of all men\r\nand women as persons has pre-eminence over the State\r\nand all ideological systems.\r\nWith respect to the important question of\r\ndevelopment, it has be acknowledged that in recent\r\nyears, Governments have taken some promising steps.\r\nFor example, proposals for new mechanisms of\r\nfinancing for development are very much appreciated.\r\nBut much hard work remains to mobilize economic and\r\nfinancial support. Clearly, the initiatives of developed\r\ncountries must be matched by a renewed sense of\r\nresponsibility on the part of the Governments of\r\ndeveloping countries, which have the duty to fight\r\ncorruption, ensure the rule of law and, especially,\r\nredouble their efforts in the area of social development,\r\nincluding education and basic health care for all.\r\nThe mission of the Holy See is, above all,\r\nspiritual. And it is precisely because of that mission\r\nthat it has the duty to be present in the lives of nations\r\nand is committed to bringing justice and solidarity\r\namong people. With that conviction, the Holy See\r\nreaffirms its full support for the goals of this summit,\r\nand it will do everything in its power so that the\r\nsummit can soon realize the hoped-for fruits and so\r\nthat an era of peace and social justice can soon begin.\r\nThe words the late Pope John Paul II pronounced\r\nduring his apostolic visit to Chile retain all their\r\nrelevance: the poor cannot wait.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency The\r\nHonourable Sato Kilman, Deputy Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Vanuatu.\r\nMr. Kilman (Vanuatu): Nearly two weeks ago,\r\nHurricane Katrina caused widespread destruction,\r\nmaking it one of the worst natural disasters on record\r\nin the history of the United States of America. I take\r\nthis opportunity to convey the condolences and the\r\ndeepest sympathy of my Government and people to the\r\nGovernment and the people of the United States of\r\nAmerica, in particular to the families who lost loved\r\nones. We express our solidarity with them throughout\r\nthis difficult period of rebuilding homes and the\r\ndevastated areas.\r\nHurricane Katrina is a stark reminder of the\r\nincreasing vulnerability of todays global environment,\r\nin which nature respects no boundaries. The severe\r\nimpact of natural disasters will constantly remind us of\r\nthe harsh experiences and the critical development\r\nchallenges confronting many island countries.\r\nIt is therefore our fervent hope that the\r\ninternational community will be able to do more to\r\ngive credible recognition to the natural characteristics\r\nand vulnerabilities of so many of our countries. In this\r\ncontext, I would like to associate Vanuatu with the\r\nstatements made by other island countries.\r\nAt the Millennium Summit we adopted a plan of\r\naction, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs),\r\nwhich aimed to halve poverty by the year 2015. This\r\nwas followed by the Monterrey Conference, which\r\naddressed the challenges of financing for development.\r\nVanuatu committed itself by instituting the a\r\nnational MDG task force to spearhead national\r\nimplementation. Targeted goals have been established,\r\nbut the constraining factor for us  and I believe this\r\napplies to many of us in the developing world  is a\r\nshortage of financial and technical resources. Recent\r\nreports on global implementation clearly indicate that\r\nthere has been limited progress, a fact that must be\r\nattributed to the lack of genuine financial support from\r\nthe international donor community. We urge\r\ndevelopment partners to increase flows of development\r\nassistance to the developing world.\r\nI have been encouraged by the United States\r\ncommitment to the MDGs, as stated by President Bush\r\non Wednesday (see A/60/PV.2), and I believe this is the\r\ninspiration we need to move forward with the global\r\ndevelopment agenda. The establishment of the\r\n37\r\nA/60/PV.7\r\nMillennium Challenge Account, after Monterrey, is a\r\nwelcome development and provides an impetus for\r\ncountries to improve on governance issues as a\r\nprerequisite to improving and sustaining economic\r\ngrowth.\r\nVanuatu also strongly welcomes the commitments\r\nmade by Qatar, the Peoples Republic of China and the\r\nEuropean Union to assist developing countries in\r\nattaining the Goals. We are also encouraged by the\r\ninnovations proposed by France and a number of other\r\ncountries with respect to additional sources of funds to\r\nmeet the MDGs. We also applaud countries that have\r\ntaken steps to reach the 0.7 per cent United Nations\r\ntarget for official development assistance (ODA).\r\nNevertheless, more remains to be done by other\r\nmembers of the international donor community.\r\nA snapshot of the global map clearly reveals\r\ndisturbing evidence of deterioration in human security.\r\nPolitical and civil strife, disease, poverty and other\r\nhuman tragedies have forced many of our societies into\r\nbondage. Additionally, the emergence of other new\r\nravaging situations will present very serious threats to\r\nnational cohesion; and, unless these are dealt with\r\nimmediately, the impact on the global level will present\r\nmost difficult challenges for us.\r\nThe prosperity of many of our nations\r\ncamouflages the harsh realities in most of our\r\ncountries. History has seen more rhetoric, and we must\r\nbe able to transform this into genuine political will so\r\nas to trigger quantifiable action that produces tangible\r\nresults. Bold decisions must be taken. Our peoples\r\nwant change  change that will provide them with\r\nimproved living standards, change that will bring them\r\nhope, change that will enable them to lead responsible\r\nlives in our communities and societies, and change that\r\ncreates a freer, fairer and safer place to live.\r\nThe United Nations must continue to have the\r\ncentral role in managing this process and maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security. But if we are to\r\nresolutely defend the Organizations principles and\r\nmandates, then reform is essential in order to make it\r\nmore representative and effective. The process begins\r\nwith tolerance and mutual respect. Our attitudes must\r\nchange. There must be fairness and equal justice for\r\nall. Equally important, there must be fair opportunities\r\nfor all to participate in the work and decision-making\r\nof the United Nations. Justice and human rights: these\r\nmust not be based entirely on Western concepts but\r\nshould take into equal consideration our diversity. It is\r\nthe harmonizing of these differences that presents\r\nchallenges, yet, if we are to succeed, this is the\r\nassurance that is required to allow all nations to be\r\ntreated with dignity and as equal partners. Furthermore,\r\ndemocratic principles vigorously pursued by some\r\nmust be cultivated carefully. Ultimately, the\r\napproaches of the big players must be conducive to\r\nfriendship, must reconcile with and embrace nations\r\nthat have been alienated and have felt threatened by\r\noppressive policies. Intimidation is not the solution.\r\nStronger nations must show transparent and genuine\r\nleadership in engendering majority support for our\r\nuniversal goals for the common good of all humanity.\r\nAs it embarks on its structural reforms, the\r\nUnited Nations must also be able to once and for all\r\naddress the contentious issues that have over the years\r\nundermined the credibility of the Organization. We\r\nmust work jointly in good faith to remove any doubts\r\nabout past unjust decisions that over many decades\r\nhave affected the lives of millions of innocent people.\r\nThere can be no contradiction in decisions if the United\r\nNations is our guarantor for peace, security and justice.\r\nIn conclusion, Vanuatu remains firmly opposed to\r\nthe development and production of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. Consequently, my Government has this\r\nyear ratified the Ottawa Convention on Landmines, the\r\nChemical Weapons Convention and the Comprehensive\r\nTest-Ban Treaty. We also ratified the Stockholm\r\nConvention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. The legal\r\ninstruments are being deposited with the United\r\nNations this week.\r\nPublic opinion will always focus on our failures.\r\nWe have each committed ourselves to enhancing the\r\nuniversal role of the United Nations; projecting a\r\npositive image of the Organization remains one of our\r\nbiggest challenges. We cannot fail this time.\r\nMay we seek the almighty Creators wisdom in\r\nguiding us into the future.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): I now give the\r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Elyor Ganiev, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Uzbekistan.\r\nMr. Ganiev (Uzbekistan) (spoke in Russian): It is\r\nwith great satisfaction that, on behalf of the Republic\r\nof Uzbekistan, at this anniversary session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, I greet leaders and other\r\n38\r\nA/60/PV.7\r\nrepresentatives and wish them all success in the work\r\nof this session.\r\nFive years ago, the Millennium Summit adopted\r\nthe Development Goals for the comprehensive\r\nimprovement of the human condition. In an initial\r\nassessment of this programme of action, we have to\r\nrecognize a certain sluggishness in tackling certain\r\nissues, a lack of intensity in implementing the\r\nobligations assumed and a lack of attentiveness to the\r\nneeds and realities of the developing world.\r\nUzbekistan is hoping for full implementation of\r\nthis document. It calls upon the international\r\ncommunity to look seriously at the Secretary-Generals\r\nproposals in this area and to take appropriate action.\r\nThe Secretary-Generals recommendations are timely\r\nwith regard to the reform and renewal of the General\r\nAssembly, the Economic and Social Council and the\r\nSecretariat and the establishment of a Peacebuilding\r\nCommission. This last proposal is especially relevant\r\ngiven the growing trend towards the spread of conflict\r\nin our world. Moreover, the inability of the\r\ninternational community to take effective measures to\r\nprevent and root out causes of conflicts and crises, as\r\nwell as the current confrontations and differences in\r\nour world, are of growing concern.\r\nFinding solutions to transcend differences related\r\nto the reform of the Security Council is of the utmost\r\nimportance. This body must truly reflect the\r\ngeographical and regional representation of our\r\nMember States and must become more balanced and\r\nobjective. The solutions to this persisting problem\r\nmust, in our view, enhance the role and effectiveness of\r\nthis high-level United Nations body and avoid action\r\nthat foments divisiveness and antagonism.\r\nWe see no need to transform the Commission on\r\nHuman Rights into a small Council which could be\r\nused selectively by certain influential forces and\r\ngroups as an instrument to promote their interests, to\r\nthe detriment of others.\r\nThe events currently unfolding in Central Asia\r\nclearly demonstrate the interconnectedness of many\r\nnegative developments  developments that are to be\r\nfound throughout the world to varying degrees. The\r\ncontinuing systemic relationship between terrorism,\r\nextremism, separatism and drug trafficking is clearly\r\napparent.\r\nCombating terrorism is an issue of great\r\nimportance, and it has been the focus of our Presidents\r\nstatements here on several occasions since 1993. We\r\nare convinced that terrorism cannot be defeated by\r\nmerely trying to eliminate or neutralize individual\r\nterrorist groups or terrorists. Concrete results will be\r\nachieved only if we can eliminate the ideological\r\ncentres that fuel international terrorism and the\r\nfinancial and organizational forces behind it, and if we\r\ncan somehow develop new approaches to assessing that\r\nvery dangerous phenomenon.\r\nIn this regard, we believe that the proposals to\r\nadopt preventive measures within the United Nations\r\nframework are timely and necessary in order to deal\r\nwith individuals and organizations that foster\r\nextremism and terrorism. The tragic events that have\r\ntaken place in Beslan, Madrid, London, Sharm el-\r\nSheikh and in our region have shown us that we must\r\nundertake a critical assessment of international\r\ncooperation arrangements to counter that evil. We do\r\nnot have the right to slow our pace, as has happened in\r\nthe attempt to create a single United Nations structure\r\nto fight terrorism.\r\nWe call upon the international community to\r\nmake a genuine attempt to pool its efforts to counter\r\nterrorism, making use of the normative framework that\r\nhas recently been strengthened by relevant Security\r\nCouncil resolutions and other instruments. At the same\r\ntime, we believe that it is important to examine and\r\nexpedite the process of adopting a comprehensive\r\nconvention on international terrorism that does not\r\nallow for the possibility of applying double standards\r\non this issue.\r\nThe situation in Afghanistan has become very\r\nproblematic. The country has, needlessly, remained in a\r\npost-conflict situation. The many promises made have\r\nnot been acted upon. One very serious problem is the\r\nlack of coordinated activity to fight the drug trade,\r\nwhich is conducted on a large scale in Afghanistan and\r\nis continuing to grow. The reality is that today Central\r\nAsia is a transit zone for drugs on the way to the\r\ndeveloped countries. In this context, we do not\r\nunderstand why there is such a long-drawn-out process\r\nwith regard to the creation in Central Asia of an\r\ninformation and coordination centre to fight that evil.\r\nGiven that situation, the demilitarization of the\r\nCentral Asian region is of great importance. Resolving\r\nsocio-economic issues is no less important for stability\r\n39\r\nA/60/PV.7\r\nin the region. We must step up the process of creating a\r\ncommon market in Central Asia so as to ensure the\r\nrational and effective use of our great potential and\r\nrich resources.\r\nThe Governments of our region are united in their\r\ncall for the creation in our region of a nuclear-weapon-\r\nfree zone. We call upon the permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council to formulate a consolidated position\r\nwith the States of the region on this fundamental issue,\r\nwhich is an important element for ensuring security in\r\nour region and beyond, as it would make an important\r\ncontribution to the non-proliferation of weapons of\r\nmass destruction.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to express the hope\r\nthat this anniversary summit will be a turning point and\r\nthat it will make a productive contribution to the\r\ndevelopment of humankind.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): I now give the\r\nfloor to His Excellency The Honourable Frederick\r\nMitchell, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Public\r\nService of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas.\r\nMr. Mitchell (Bahamas): I should like at the\r\noutset offer the condolences of The Right Honourable\r\nParry Christie, Prime Minister of the Bahamas, as well\r\nas of the Government and the people of the Bahamas,\r\nto the people of the United States in connection with\r\nHurricane Katrina, which claimed so many victims.\r\nI am honoured to address this body, particularly\r\nas we  at perhaps the most promising gathering of\r\nthe international community  come together on the\r\nsixtieth anniversary of the United Nations to review the\r\nprogress we have made in addressing the daunting\r\nchallenges that face us all as inhabitants of this planet.\r\nOn behalf of the delegation of the\r\nCommonwealth of the Bahamas, I extend warm\r\ncongratulations to the delegations of Sweden and of\r\nGabon on their election to preside over this Meeting.\r\nWe are here today to renew our commitment to\r\nthe global partnership envisioned in the outcomes of\r\nthe major United Nations summits and conferences of\r\nthe past 15 years. The Bahamas is of the view that the\r\nfull implementation of the outcomes of the major\r\nUnited Nations summits and conferences should be the\r\npriority of the international community.\r\nWe reaffirm the long-standing commitment to the\r\ntarget of 0.7 per cent of gross national income for\r\nofficial development assistance (ODA) and welcome\r\nthe commitments made, especially by the European\r\nUnion and others, to that end. We urge those that have\r\nnot yet done so to take positive steps in that regard, in\r\norder that we may be able to achieve the global\r\ndevelopment goals within the agreed time frames.\r\nAs a small island developing State which has\r\nconsistently taken primary responsibility for its own\r\ndevelopment, the Bahamas is encouraged in particular\r\nby the international communitys recognition of the\r\nspecial needs and vulnerabilities of small island\r\ndeveloping States. We wish especially to highlight the\r\nserious issue of climate change and the need to take\r\nglobal action to address its attendant dangers.\r\nThe issue of the reform of global economic\r\ngovernance to strengthen the voice and participation of\r\ndeveloping countries in international economic\r\ndecision-making and norm-setting is also of critical\r\nimportance to the Bahamas. It is for that reason that we\r\nvalue the Monterrey Consensus. The Bahamas would\r\nwelcome any initiative to ensure the effective,\r\npermanent representation of developing countries,\r\nparticularly small developing countries, in international\r\neconomic, trade and financial institutions, including\r\nthe Bretton Woods institutions and the World Trade\r\nOrganization.\r\nWith regard to HIV/AIDS, the Bahamas\r\nwelcomes the strong commitment at this High-level\r\nMeeting to fully implement the measures contained in\r\nthe Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS\r\n(resolution S-26/2), as well as commitments regarding\r\nthe provision of resources for prevention, treatment,\r\ncare, support and access to reproductive health\r\nservices. We must put ourselves back on track to\r\nachieve our goal of reversing the spread of HIV/AIDS\r\nby 2015; those commitments are a right step in that\r\ndirection.\r\nThe Bahamas strongly welcomes the historic\r\nrecognition by all heads of State or Government, for\r\nthe first time, of the concerns of small island\r\ndeveloping and coastal States regarding the risks\r\ninherent in the transport of radioactive materials by\r\nsea. The Bahamas, along with its Caribbean\r\nCommunity partners, has consistently expressed its\r\ngrave concerns regarding the threat posed to the\r\nsecurity and environmental and economic\r\nsustainability of the small island developing States of\r\nthe region by the trans-shipment of nuclear waste\r\n40\r\nA/60/PV.7\r\nthrough the Caribbean Sea. It is a peril that cannot be\r\noverstated, as it threatens our very survival and way of\r\nlife. Accordingly, we continue to call on States\r\ninvolved in trans-shipment to desist from that practice.\r\nThe Bahamas supports the reform of the United\r\nNations. Any efforts made in that area must be to the\r\nadvantage of both the Member States and the\r\nSecretariat. We support the position of the Group of 77\r\nand China in this regard.\r\nWe support all efforts to reinvigorate the United\r\nNations system so as to better serve our needs,\r\nincluding through the comprehensive reform of the\r\nSecurity Council. The Bahamas supports efforts to\r\nreform the United Nations human rights machinery to\r\nbring greater credibility and efficacy to this pivotal\r\narea of the work of the United Nations, and we have\r\nbeen following the proposal to establish a\r\nPeacebuilding Commission with keen and positive\r\ninterest. We hope that the Assembly will be able to\r\ncomplete negotiations in order to bring these two new\r\nbodies into being before the end of this sixtieth\r\nsession.\r\nLikewise, we encourage this Assembly to bring\r\nthe negotiations for a draft comprehensive convention\r\non terrorism to a conclusion during this session as well.\r\nIn this regard, The Bahamas recalls and fully supports\r\nthe recommendation of the High-level Panel on\r\nThreats, Challenges and Change to improve the\r\ncooperative nature of the United Nations counter-\r\nterrorism machinery, to promote greater dialogue and\r\nprovide greater assistance to States in meeting counter-\r\nterrorism obligations.\r\nIt is incumbent upon this summit to move the\r\nprocess forward and to take us one step closer towards\r\nmeeting the needs, hopes and aspirations of the peoples\r\nof the world, whom we represent.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): I call next on\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Norman José Caldera Cardenal,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Nicaragua.\r\nMr. Cardenal (Nicaragua) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nWe support the process of fully reforming the United\r\nNations. Reform for reforms sake is not what this is\r\nabout, nor is it about increasing or reducing the\r\nmembership of specific bodies to fill or save physical\r\nspace. What we need are tangible results, otherwise we\r\nwill have lost precious opportunities and wasted\r\ninvaluable effort.\r\nThese reforms are across the board. They must\r\nnot focus on just one body alone, nor be taken in\r\nisolation from the rest of the system. The United\r\nNations is a single and indivisible mechanism geared\r\nto common goals. Reforming the Security Council is an\r\nimportant undertaking, but not an end in itself.\r\nPresident Bolaños said as much in 2004, when he noted\r\nthat the Security Council designed after the Second\r\nWorld War to keep the peace in the post-war world is\r\nnot the Security Council needed for the new age of\r\ninformation technology and globalization.\r\nThe Security Council must be expanded, in both\r\nits permanent and non-permanent membership, and\r\noffer an opportunity for permanent voices of the\r\ndeveloping world to be heard. Those voices must\r\nconvey the needs of the worlds poorest nations and\r\ngive us, the least developed countries, a sense of co-\r\nownership. Seeking consensus continues to be\r\nnecessary, yet this does not mean that we should put\r\noff the reforms indefinitely.\r\nAs regards the General Assembly, we support the\r\nmeasures adopted to strengthen its role and authority,\r\nwhile ensuring its coordination with the other main\r\nbodies of the Organization. We support the\r\nPeacebuilding Commission as a means of continuing\r\nthe work done by the Organization in a field where, as\r\nPresident Lagos of Chile noted yesterday, and I quote,\r\nThe contribution [of the United Nations] to the\r\nsettlement of 170 conflicts and in 60 peace missions\r\nsince 1948 bears witness to its fundamental presence\r\n(A/60/PV.5). We support the effective operation of the\r\nDemocracy Fund and the adoption, as a matter of\r\nurgency, of a global anti-terrorism convention. We are\r\nalso in favour of the establishment of a Human Rights\r\nCouncil to take the place of the current Commission\r\nand hope that the operating problems of the present\r\nstructure will be overcome.\r\nIn July 1997, the Secretary-General affirmed that\r\nthe United Nations is a noble experiment in human\r\ncooperation. Cooperation amongst human beings,\r\nsocieties and entire peoples would be far more\r\neffective and successful if we were to update\r\nmultilateral channels. Globalization compels us to seek\r\nthese reforms. This phenomenon is not confined to the\r\neconomic arena; indeed, there is always the risk that\r\nany local political conflict may spill over beyond\r\nregional lines and turn into a possible threat to world\r\npeace and security. This comprehensive renewal must\r\ngive an unqualified impetus to the mandate we\r\n41\r\nA/60/PV.7\r\nenshrined in the Millennium Declaration, translating\r\nthe contents of that Declaration into deeds.\r\nThe best way to measure and evaluate this\r\nprocess is to show tangible results in wiping out\r\nextreme poverty, achieving primary education for all,\r\npromoting gender equity, reducing maternal and child\r\nmortality, fighting HIV/AIDS and achieving\r\nenvironmental sustainability and a global partnership\r\nfor democratic governance and development.\r\nJust recently, we commemorated the fourth\r\nanniversary of one of our most terrible manifestations\r\nof terrorism, a phenomenon that continues to be\r\nrepeated in various parts of the world. Our debates are\r\nunfolding against a backdrop of escalating oil prices,\r\nwhose worst fallout we may have yet to see. The\r\nassaults of nature do not distinguish between the rich\r\nand the poor or the developed or less developed, in\r\ndealing devastating blows to human beings and\r\ninfrastructure. Transnational crimes such as drug\r\ntrafficking, illicit arms trafficking and organized crime\r\nare expanding and acquiring additional resources.\r\nDemocratic governance is affected by anything\r\nthat impacts upon the constitutional order and the rule\r\nof law. Against such a backdrop we can wait no longer.\r\nWe must make the United Nations the efficient and\r\neffective mechanism needed to address the ills\r\nafflicting us.\r\nYesterday, the Secretary-General said that to\r\nremain standing upright we must support one another,\r\nwhich will not be possible unless the United Nations is\r\nreformed. Keeping alive our hopes for peace and\r\ndevelopment depends on just how strong our\r\ncommitment to multilateralism really is.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Allam-\r\nMi Ahmad, Minister for Foreign Affairs and African\r\nIntegration of Chad.\r\nMr. Ahmad (Chad) (spoke in French): His\r\nExcellency Mr. Idriss Deby, President of the Republic\r\nof Chad, who is unable to be here, has asked me to\r\nrepresent him at this High-level Meeting and to deliver\r\nthe following message to you.\r\nTo bring about a better world in which peace and\r\nsecurity will prevail, we are convinced that we must\r\ntake into account a large proportion of humanitys\r\nlegitimate aspirations for economic and social\r\nprogress. From that perspective, we have for decades\r\nnow been unceasingly advocating answers to questions\r\nof deteriorating terms of trade, the debt crisis, constant\r\nenvironmental degradation, the need for a gradual\r\nincrease in Official Development Aid and the necessity\r\nof fair and equitable international trade. And the list\r\ngoes on. The results fall short. How then can we not\r\nreaffirm our need for expertise and know-how from the\r\nrich countries? Our needs for the mechanical and\r\nindustrial wherewithal to develop our small and\r\nmedium-sized enterprises and industries, our need for\r\ndigital solidarity to speed our development? To put it\r\nclearly, we need to emphasize the need for a real\r\npartnership between rich and poor based on mutual\r\nrespect.\r\nAnother way of saying this is that the essential\r\nissues we should be asking ourselves constantly  and\r\nthe ones we must find answers to  have indeed been\r\nbrought to the fore by the Secretary-General. How can\r\nwe live free from want, live free from fear, live in\r\ndignity and achieve collective action?\r\nThat is why Chad, along with a number of other\r\ndeveloping countries, adopted a nationwide strategy for\r\npoverty reduction in 2003 that directly dovetails with\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals.\r\nIn addition, our Government has made sustained\r\nefforts to forever anchor the rule of law and sound\r\ngovernance in our country in the context of respect for\r\nthe rights and duties of our citizens. In that connection,\r\nwe can say that Chad need not envy any other country\r\nin the world in terms of the guarantees it provides of\r\nthe security of its citizens and respect for their rights,\r\nincluding the freedoms of expression and opinion.\r\nHaving endured the horrors of war for decades,\r\nChad knows better than any other country the need to\r\nlive free from want through economic and social\r\ndevelopment, which is in turn a product of peace and\r\nsecurity. That is why, now more than ever, we must\r\nredouble our vigilance to consolidate our stability by\r\nfighting against the threats looming over us,\r\nparticularly those stemming from terrorism.\r\nMy country welcomes the cooperation that links\r\nit to the countries bordering the Sahara in their\r\ncommitment to fight against the terrorism that is\r\nbrewing there and to deal with any eventuality. By the\r\nsame token, the question of the crisis of Darfur is still\r\nwith us. Our fear is that that crisis may spread and\r\nbecome a firestorm engulfing the entire subregion.\r\n42\r\nA/60/PV.7\r\nMy country was called upon by the international\r\ncommunity to do something with regard to the crisis\r\nfrom its earliest hours, and continues to fulfil its\r\nmission of mediation in strict respect for the principles\r\nof impartiality and neutrality.\r\nAbove and beyond our efforts at mediation, we\r\nhave welcomed into our own territory over 200,000\r\nrefugees  more than three times the population of the\r\nhost areas. Among the impacts that can be attributed to\r\nthe presence of the refugees is a growing insecurity,\r\nenvironmental destruction, food shortages, damaged\r\npastures and water sources, disrupted trade and the\r\ndeterioration of roads used by humanitarian convoys.\r\nThe full financial weight of all these consequences of\r\nthe war in the Sudan are being borne by our own\r\nmeagre national resources. Humanitarian institutions\r\noperating in the affected areas should not lose sight of\r\nthe need to come to the aid of our country and lighten\r\nthe load that we are bearing.\r\nElsewhere, we are encouraged by the resolution\r\nof the conflict in south Sudan, and it is with real relief\r\nthat we hail the outcome of the peace negotiations in a\r\nnumber of regions of Africa and around the world.\r\nWe would be still more encouraged if our\r\nOrganization were to become more effective through\r\nthe indispensable reforms that are expected from our\r\nHigh-level Meeting and reflected in a new world\r\norder  a world we hope to see that will be more equal\r\nand more democratic. Above and beyond the\r\nfundamental issues of restructuring the General\r\nAssembly, the Secretariat, the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil and the Commission on Human Rights, we\r\nnote the need to establish a peacebuilding commission,\r\nwhich is of particular concern to my continent.\r\nI could hardly fail to urge the no less fundamental\r\nexpansion of the Security Council. In that connection,\r\nAfrica is fully entitled to claim its permanent seat on\r\nthe Security Council, side by side with the other\r\ncontinents. This is a matter of our dignity and our right\r\nto make our contribution to deliberations on questions\r\nof peace and security in our world and to the\r\nelaboration and implementation of just and fair\r\nsolutions to those questions.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): I now give the\r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Elmar Maharram oglu\r\nMammadyarov, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nAzerbaijan.\r\nMr. Mammadyarov (Azerbaijan): Today is a\r\ntruly significant moment in the history of\r\nmultilateralism. We have gathered here to reaffirm our\r\nfaith in this house and our unyielding commitment to\r\nits Charter. We have pledged to contribute to a shared\r\nvision of global solidarity and collective security with\r\na strong United Nations at its core.\r\nWe have recognized the valuable contribution of\r\nmajor United Nations conferences and summits in\r\nmobilizing the efforts of Member States for achieving\r\nthe United Nations development agenda. Azerbaijan\r\nconsiders development to be a central goal and, to that\r\nend, reiterates its commitment to fully implement the\r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). We believe\r\nthat the more active involvement of all segments of\r\nsociety, particularly of youth, is crucial in the process\r\nof implementing national development agendas and\r\nachieving the MDGs.\r\nIn the draft outcome document we have\r\nacknowledged that Member States have a shared\r\nresponsibility for each others security, since no State\r\ncan stand alone against transnational threats.\r\nManifestations of international terrorism, extremism,\r\naggressive separatism and occupation of the territory of\r\nMember States are not the problems of the affected\r\nState alone. Therefore, prompt response and collective\r\nremedial action to protect the millions of civilians \r\nin particular women and children, who are the major\r\nvictims of armed conflicts and negligence  are\r\nimperative in order to effectively provide security for\r\nall States and peoples and to realize the goals\r\nenvisaged in the outcome document.\r\nThe notorious occupation by one United Nations\r\nMember State of the territory of another Member State,\r\nas well as carrying out ethnic cleansing, must be\r\nstrongly condemned and brought to an end.\r\nThis meeting is a landmark event in the ongoing\r\ndiscussions on reform of the United Nations.\r\nAzerbaijan, like many other States, is concerned about\r\nthe decline in the General Assemblys prestige and its\r\ndiminishing profile in the Organizations activities. The\r\nAssembly must take bold measures to further\r\nstrengthen its role and authority, as set out in the\r\nCharter of the United Nations, and should discuss\r\nissues pertaining to the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security, in particular through the\r\nconsideration of agenda items of special political\r\nimportance and urgency. Review of its agenda and the\r\n43\r\nA/60/PV.7\r\nimprovement of its working methods are other ways to\r\nenhance the General Assemblys role, authority,\r\neffectiveness and efficiency as the chief deliberative,\r\npolicymaking and representative organ of the United\r\nNations. We welcome in that regard adoption of\r\nresolution 59/313 entitled A strengthened and\r\nrevitalized General Assembly.\r\nAzerbaijan strongly believes that reform of the\r\nSecurity Council should not be limited to its\r\nenlargement. It is of vital importance to ensure greater\r\ntransparency in the decision-making process,\r\naccountability in performance and access and better\r\nparticipation of non-Member States in the work of the\r\nCouncil. Given the non-implementation of a number of\r\nUnited Nations resolutions, in particular those related\r\nto regional conflicts, we attach great importance to the\r\nestablishment of a mechanism that would provide for\r\nmonitoring and implementation of those resolutions.\r\nAzerbaijan supports strengthening the role of the\r\nUnited Nations in global economic governance and in\r\nits capacity to promote development. Furthermore, we\r\nrecognize the increasing role of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council in addressing the economic and social\r\ndimensions of armed conflicts, including protracted\r\nones, through the proposed peacebuilding commission,\r\nfor instance.\r\nWe also believe that in order to effectively meet\r\npresent challenges, the United Nations human rights\r\nmachinery could be improved, with due regard being\r\npaid to the principles of sovereignty and non-\r\ninterference in internal affairs of Member States and in\r\na way conducive to their efforts to protect and promote\r\nhuman rights.\r\nThe principle of indivisibility of security requires\r\na global response to current threats and challenges,\r\nwhich in turn entails substantial cooperation on a\r\nregional level. Azerbaijan makes a valuable\r\ncontribution to regional security through cooperation in\r\ndrug interdiction operations, efforts to counter the\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, illegal\r\nmigration and other types of criminal activity, and its\r\nparticipation in peacekeeping missions in hot spots\r\naround the globe.\r\nFrom the very beginning, we have been actively\r\nparticipating in the global fight against terrorism. Just\r\nyesterday, I signed the International Convention for the\r\nSuppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. Azerbaijan\r\nalso promotes global energy security through\r\ndevelopment of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline\r\nand the Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum gas pipeline, as well as\r\nthrough the Baku-Tbilisi-Akhalkalaki-Kars railroad\r\nproject.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to express confidence\r\nthat this High-level Plenary Meeting, so well\r\norganized, will be a significant step towards\r\nimplementation of the goals and tasks before the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): I call next on\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ramesh Nath Pandey, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Kingdom of Nepal.\r\nMr. Pandey (Nepal): I have the honour and\r\nprivilege to bring the warm greetings and best wishes\r\nof His Majesty King Gyanendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev,\r\nHis Majestys Government and the people of the\r\nKingdom of Nepal for the success of this High-level\r\nPlenary Meeting.\r\nThe people of Nepal are proud to celebrate this\r\nyear the fiftieth anniversary of Nepals membership in\r\nthe United Nations. We would like to reiterate our\r\nunflinching faith in and commitment to the founding\r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter and pledge to\r\nwork together with fellow Member States for creating a\r\nworld order to realize the aspirations of humanity.\r\nOver the years, the United Nations has become a\r\nbeacon of hope for a just, equitable, and peaceful\r\ninternational order. The principles and purposes\r\nenshrined in the Charter reflect the true aspirations of\r\nhumanity. This institution has made significant strides\r\nfor the sake of world peace, security and development.\r\nIt has proven the centrality of multilateralism in\r\nmanaging global affairs. We must revitalize the United\r\nNations to make it more capable of realizing the\r\naspirations of succeeding generations and equip it to\r\novercome newer challenges ranging from the spread of\r\nweapons of mass destruction, terrorism, poverty,\r\nenvironmental degradation and HIV/AIDS and other\r\npandemics.\r\nFive years ago in September 2000, this Assembly\r\nadopted the Millennium Declaration, which sought to\r\nmake the United Nations the indispensable common\r\nhouse of the entire human family. The Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals can be achieved only if aid targets\r\nare met, debts are cancelled and barriers to trade are\r\nlifted, especially in the case of countries with special\r\nneeds such as the least developed and landlocked\r\n44\r\nA/60/PV.7\r\ncountries like Nepal. These goals can be achieved only\r\nwhen we seriously implement the commitments agreed\r\nupon at Almaty, Brussels, Doha, Johannesburg and\r\nMonterrey.\r\nTerrorism poses a serious threat to democracy, the\r\nrule of law and the very soul of human civilization. It\r\noperates without borders. It knows no logic, no\r\nlanguage or religion. No country, no person, no\r\nreligion is totally immune from the scourge of\r\nterrorism. Whether it is an attack in New York, Madrid,\r\nBali, Belsan, London, Cairo or Madi in Nepal, its\r\ntargets have been innocent civilians.\r\nTerrorism anywhere is a threat to peace and\r\nprosperity everywhere and it must be fought\r\ncomprehensively, collectively and resolutely, and\r\ncondemned in all its forms and manifestations. There\r\ncan be no selective standards in fighting terror, as there\r\ncan be no good or bad terrorism. Violence can never be\r\nan instrument of political change.\r\nNepal has been the victim of senseless terror for\r\nover a decade now. Terrorism has seriously undermined\r\nour socio-economic development efforts. Terrorists in\r\nNepal are spreading violence in the name of the\r\noutdated, rejected and failed ideology of totalitarianism.\r\nHis Majestys Government is committed to\r\nresolving the problems confronting Nepal with\r\npatriotism as the point of convergence. The\r\nGovernment has been making sincere efforts to restore\r\npeace and security, rebuild destroyed infrastructure,\r\nenergize democratic institutions and ensure that people\r\nenjoy their basic rights in a free and democratic\r\natmosphere. Our road map to peace includes an\r\ninclusive process to make democracy meaningful and\r\nto provide good governance for the people.\r\nWe are open to all sincere efforts leading to peace\r\nand stability in Nepal. However, lasting peace is\r\npossible only when terrorism is totally rejected as a\r\nmeans of furthering political objectives.\r\nBecause the twenty-first century belongs to\r\nmultiparty democracy, we in Nepal are working to\r\ncreate an effective system of governance. To this end,\r\npreparations are under way to hold municipal elections\r\nby April 2006. This, we believe, will pave the way for\r\nnational elections.\r\nWe greatly cherish universal values and the ideals\r\nof democracy. However, the one-size-fits-all model\r\ndoes not apply to people with different historical,\r\nsociocultural, and economic backgrounds. All\r\nsovereign and independent countries and peoples are\r\nfree to choose the form of governance that best suits\r\ntheir conditions and requirements.\r\nNepal is committed to the protection and\r\npromotion of human rights. We have unequivocally\r\nexpressed our readiness to fulfil all obligations arising\r\nfrom the international human rights instruments.\r\nAtrocities committed by the terrorists have seriously\r\nundermined human rights in Nepal. We cannot equate\r\nthe constitutional duty of the Government to protect\r\nthe life and property of ordinary citizens with that of\r\nthe dreadful activities of terrorists. The security forces\r\nin Nepal have been maintaining the highest standards\r\nof human rights despite the most difficult conditions;\r\njust as they have demonstrated sterling performance in\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations around the\r\nworld.\r\nIt is our firm conviction that the United Nations\r\nis best positioned to take up the responsibility to meet\r\nthe challenges of our times because of its universal\r\ncharacter and widespread reach. We firmly believe in\r\nthe indispensability of the United Nations. While\r\naddressing this Assembly in 1967, His Late Majesty\r\nKing Mahendra said, and I quote,\r\nMy country has come to the United\r\nNations with as much faith in its organization as\r\nin its Charter, with as much faith in its\r\neffectiveness as in its ideal. (A/PV.1595, p. 1)\r\nThe King added that there was no alternative to the\r\nUnited Nations and that the only real alternative to the\r\nUnited Nations was an even more powerful United\r\nNations. Those assertions are still relevant and valid\r\ntoday.\r\nIt is our deep conviction that the strength of the\r\nUnited Nations lies in its universality, neutrality and\r\nimpartiality. All sovereign independent nations, big or\r\nsmall, rich or poor and powerful or weak look up to the\r\nUnited Nations as the best hope for a shared destiny. It\r\nis, therefore, our solemn duty to reshape the world\r\nOrganization and make it more vibrant and dynamic in\r\nthe face of changing realities.\r\nI am confident that the decisions we shall adopt\r\ntoday in the draft outcome document, including\r\nmeasures for reform of the United Nations, will have a\r\nfar-reaching impact on making the world a safer and\r\nbetter place for humanity to live and prosper.\r\n45\r\nA/60/PV.7\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency The\r\nHonourable Knowlson Gift, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Trinidad and Tobago.\r\nMr. Gift (Trinidad and Tobago): Five years have\r\nelapsed since we were last here in New York to embark\r\non an ambitious yet much-needed programme of action\r\nto address what at the time were identified as the most\r\ncritical issues facing our societies. Our commitment\r\nwas based on the recognition of our collective\r\nresponsibility as global leaders to work towards\r\nconfronting the existing challenges in such crucial\r\nareas as the eradication of poverty, sustainable\r\ndevelopment, health, education, human rights, gender\r\nequality, peace and security and good governance. We\r\nalso pledged to take targeted actions aimed at\r\nprotecting the more vulnerable sectors of our societies,\r\nproviding for the special needs of Africa and\r\nstrengthening institutional arrangements in support of\r\nthose actions.\r\nAt the 2000 Summit, we also affirmed our faith\r\nin, and commitment to, the purposes and principles of\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. On this fifth\r\nanniversary of that historic undertaking, our review of\r\nthe progress made in achieving the targets that we set\r\nourselves must also involve, in one or all of its several\r\ndimensions, an in-depth examination  an exercise in\r\nintrospection as it were  of the efficiency and the\r\neffectiveness of the Organization itself.\r\nSuch a review will, by its nature, be polemical.\r\nThe global processes that have brought into sharp\r\nfocus how inextricably intertwined our common\r\ninterests are has at the same time served to highlight\r\nthe stark differences that inform the national and group\r\npositions among and within geographic, economic and\r\npolitical blocs. Our recent and ongoing experience with\r\nthe reform of the United Nations, and particularly of\r\nthe Security Council, is but one of many such\r\nexamples.\r\nOf more immediate and direct interest to Trinidad\r\nand Tobago and to similarly placed small middle-\r\nincome island countries are the inequities inherent in\r\nthe existing asymmetrical international economic\r\nstructures and the reticence of several influential\r\nplayers to apply remedial measures to redress the\r\nimbalances. Of particular concern are the many issues\r\non the international trade agenda and the disturbing\r\nlack of momentum towards the successful conclusion\r\nof the Doha development round.\r\nSince the Millennium Summit, we have, at the\r\nhighest levels, focused our efforts on those burning\r\nissues and elaborated far-reaching recommendations in\r\nareas of special interest to developing countries. Those\r\nareas include development financing, sustainable\r\ndevelopment, HIV/AIDS and children. We have also\r\nsought to give institutional attention to the special\r\ncircumstances of least developed and landlocked\r\ndeveloping countries and small island developing\r\nStates and have formulated a comprehensive\r\nprogramme for Africas development. Yet the impact of\r\nour interventions has, to date, been limited. We need to\r\ndo more. We must do more.\r\nIn the context of the sterling efforts of many\r\ndeveloping countries to take ownership of their\r\ndevelopment responsibilities and overcome at times\r\nseemingly insurmountable challenges, we welcome the\r\ninitiatives that have been taken to reduce the debt\r\nburden of the most economically disadvantaged among\r\nus.\r\nWe also applaud those developed country\r\npartners that have achieved the official development\r\nassistance donor targets and those that continue to seek\r\ninnovative means to supplement development\r\nfinancing shortfalls.\r\nIn Trinidad and Tobago, we have aspired to\r\nachieve the objectives contained in our 20/20 Vision\r\nfor national development and have provided assistance\r\nto others in our own region and beyond to the extent\r\npermitted by resources and attendant circumstances.\r\nYet, as we speak, more than 1 billion people\r\ncontinue to live in extreme poverty, and tens of\r\nthousands die from preventable diseases every day.\r\nOnly recently, we were confronted with a situation\r\nwhere in excess of 1 million people faced starvation in\r\nthe Niger.\r\nWe also continue to face the threat posed by\r\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations, the threat\r\nof the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and\r\nthe untenable situation of those large sectors of\r\nhumanity that are affected by civil war and less than\r\nacceptable human rights practices.\r\nAt the same time, we share the view that there\r\ncan be no security without development and,\r\nconversely, no development without security. We are\r\n46\r\nA/60/PV.7\r\nequally concerned that discontent will continue to be\r\nbred and fuelled in societies in which the benefits of\r\nglobal economic growth do not reach the majority, and\r\nin a world where cultures and civilizations are\r\nmarginalized on the basis of differences in world view.\r\nIn closing, we maintain that the real test of our\r\nreview must be the extent to which it identifies those\r\nelements that serve to chart a course forward and\r\nensure that the result of the process redounds to the\r\nbenefit of children, women and men everywhere and\r\nnot narrowly serve defined interests.\r\nOur decisions and actions should be geared to\r\ntimely implementation, with an eye on the desired\r\noutcomes which we have already identified in several\r\nforums. The undertakings and the call for effective\r\nconcrete measures that we have heard in the statements\r\nover the last few days by the leaders of the worlds\r\nmajor economies inspire real hope.\r\nHowever, our political will and commitment must\r\ntranscend the words that we have uttered and speak to\r\nthe well-being of each and every individual beyond the\r\nwalls of our conference halls. Accordingly, our actions\r\nmust speak louder than our words.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): I call now on\r\nHer Excellency Ms. Rosemary Banks, Chairperson of\r\nthe delegation of New Zealand.\r\nMs. Banks (New Zealand): As Member States,\r\nwe stand together at the threshold of a new era in the\r\nevolution of the United Nations. If we are to honour\r\nand fulfil the vision of 1945, we have to renew our\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe draft outcome document will give impetus to\r\nthat renewal. We would have liked a more ambitious\r\nresult. But in New Zealands view, we have a solid\r\nbasis on which to move forward. In the spirit of the\r\nMonterrey Consensus, a sensible balance has been\r\nstruck between the shared responsibilities of developed\r\nand developing countries to eradicate poverty.\r\nNew Zealand is making its contribution to the\r\nglobal partnership for development. This year, we\r\nincreased our official development assistance by 23 per\r\ncent. We welcome recognition in the agreed document\r\nof the special needs of small island developing States.\r\nThe spread of HIV/AIDS calls for increased\r\ncommitment through our development programmes.\r\nNew Zealand will continue to advocate for the\r\nstrengthening of womens equality and empowerment\r\nand sexual and reproductive health and rights, which\r\nare critical to the achievement of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nNew Zealand welcomes the establishment of a\r\nPeacebuilding Commission. Our challenge now is to\r\nmake sure that by the end of the year we have it up and\r\nrunning and able to deliver practical help.\r\nAt this critical moment in the history of our\r\nOrganization, we welcome the fact that Member States\r\nhave agreed that we share a responsibility to protect\r\npopulations from the most horrific of crimes. The\r\nprinciple of non-intervention cannot be used to shield\r\ngenocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes\r\nagainst humanity. We must seize this opportunity to\r\nshow that we can confront terrorism. We must\r\ndemonstrate that the General Assembly can deliver\r\nresults by concluding the comprehensive convention on\r\nterrorism. We must agree on the Secretary-Generals\r\ncounter-terrorism strategy.\r\nNew Zealand welcomes the emphasis on human\r\nrights in the outcome document. We are particularly\r\npleased that the budget of the Office of the High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights is to be doubled and\r\nher office strengthened. Undoubtedly, it is an\r\nachievement that we have agreed on a new Human\r\nRights Council. But I cannot hide New Zealands\r\ndisappointment that we did not go further. Over the\r\nnext weeks and months, we must maintain that\r\nmomentum and meet our commitment to establish the\r\nCouncil during the sixtieth session of the General\r\nAssembly. New Zealand is committed to renewed\r\nefforts to agree on an expanded membership of the\r\nSecurity Council to make it more representative of\r\ntwenty-first century realities, as well as to further\r\nimproving working methods and practices. We believe\r\nthat an expanded Security Council must include Japan.\r\nWe have endorsed substantial Secretariat and\r\nmanagement reform. Those are essential elements of\r\nthe renewal we seek.\r\nBut for all that is positive in the outcome\r\ndocument, there are gaps. Divisions in some areas were\r\ntoo deep to be bridged, and some are serious. The\r\nimpossibility of agreeing language on disarmament and\r\nnon-proliferation is of deep concern to New Zealand.\r\nThat absence sends a misleading message and one that\r\nwe must strive to correct, given the urgency of\r\n47\r\nA/60/PV.7\r\naddressing that aspect of international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nDespite its shortcomings, this weeks agreement\r\npresents us all with an opportunity to breathe new life\r\ninto our United Nations. We cannot afford to fail.\r\nEffective multilateralism is the foundation stone of\r\nglobal order and the rule of law.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Nasser\r\nAl-Kidwa, chairman of the observer delegation of\r\nPalestine.\r\nMr. Al-Kidwa (Palestine) (spoke in Arabic): I\r\nhave the honour to deliver the statement of President\r\nMahmoud Abbas, who has had to remain at home,\r\ngiven the current difficult circumstances. It reads as\r\nfollows.\r\nI address the General Assembly today as a\r\nrepresentative of my people, conveying their\r\nmessage and carrying their pain, their hopes and\r\ntheir trust in members commitment to their\r\ncause, which has been before the Assembly for\r\n58 years now. It was on behalf of that noble cause\r\nthat our late leader, President Yasser Arafat, stood\r\nbefore the Assembly for the first time in 1974 and\r\ndelivered his historic speech for the sake of his\r\npeople and of peace and security in the region.\r\nWe in Palestine face today two historic\r\ntasks and are determined to fulfil them: the task\r\nof achieving independence and peace and the task\r\nof development and the building of our State\r\ninstitutions.\r\nThe first priority, therefore, is to end the\r\noccupation and achieve freedom. The way to end\r\nthe occupation is clear. It has been defined by the\r\nnumerous resolutions of international legitimacy\r\nand the steps towards its achievement were laid\r\ndown in the road map, which enjoys international\r\nconsensus and was endorsed by the Security\r\nCouncil in resolution 1515 (2003). The goal, as\r\nelaborated in the Arab peace initiative and the\r\nvision of President Bush, is the achievement of\r\npeace on the basis of the two-State solution \r\nPalestine and Israel  with borders based on the\r\narmistice line of 1949.\r\nAs we strive to achieve independence and\r\nstatehood, we are working to promote a culture of\r\npeace and to reject violence and eliminate its\r\ncauses, for we want to build a society that will\r\ntransform the suffering of the Palestinian people\r\nthroughout the decades into a creative,\r\nconstructive energy, whereby the Palestinian\r\ncause will become an example of democracy and\r\nprogress, and not a tool abused by those who\r\nwant to exploit the feelings of the worlds\r\noppressed and encourage terrorism or foment a\r\nconflict between civilizations.\r\nToday, we have an opportunity to relaunch\r\nthe peace process, an opportunity provided in the\r\naftermath of the disengagement in the Gaza Strip\r\nand parts of the northern West Bank, which we\r\ndealt with positively, despite the fact that it was\r\nunilateral, and indeed succeeded in ensuring that\r\nit was completed in a quiet and secure manner.\r\nIt is incumbent upon Israel to turn that\r\nunilateral withdrawal into a positive step in a\r\ntangible way. We must quickly resolve all\r\noutstanding major issues, including the Rafah\r\nborder crossing with Egypt, the airport and the\r\nseaport, as well as the establishment of a direct\r\nlink between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.\r\nWithout that, Gaza will remain a huge prison.\r\nThe Sharm el-Sheikh understandings must also be\r\nimplemented and Israel must withdraw to its pre-\r\n28 September 2000 positions, release its\r\nPalestinian prisoners and create an atmosphere of\r\nhope and trust.\r\nHowever, any serious revival of the peace\r\nprocess cannot be achieved without the complete\r\ncessation of all settlement activities, the\r\nconstruction of the wall, and the continued\r\ndissection that is transforming the West Bank into\r\nisolated cantons and scattered islands,\r\nparticularly in Jerusalem. Jerusalem is the key to\r\npeace. East Jerusalem is the capital of our State.\r\nIts siege and encirclement by the separation wall,\r\nits isolation from its surroundings, the destruction\r\nof its livelihoods and the deprivation of its\r\nPalestinian citizens  Muslim and Christian\r\nalike  from access to their holy places can only\r\ndestroy the foundations of peace.\r\nPartnership is the key to success in all\r\nsteps, because, even if they partially succeed,\r\nunilateral policies will be only temporarily\r\nsuccessful and definitely not comprehensive.\r\nTherefore, the best way to achieve progress is to\r\n48\r\nA/60/PV.7\r\nproceed immediately to final status negotiations\r\nto resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in such a\r\nway that guarantees the establishment of the State\r\nof Palestine along the 1967 borders, with East\r\nJerusalem as its capital, and a just and agreed-\r\nupon resolution of the plight of the refugees in\r\naccordance with resolution 194 (III).\r\nUpon my election as the President of the\r\nPalestinian National Authority, we reached a\r\nnational agreement to achieve calm unilaterally,\r\nwhich endured despite repeated provocation. We\r\nalso launched a comprehensive process to unify\r\nand rehabilitate our destroyed security apparatus,\r\nand have achieved considerable progress despite\r\nthe obstacles that we have faced. In parallel, we\r\ninitiated a reform process that will provide the\r\ninfrastructure for the establishment of a modern\r\ndemocratic Palestinian State. We held municipal\r\nelections and have begun preparations for\r\nlegislative elections, which will be held early\r\nnext year, with a view to firmly establishing the\r\nfoundation for pluralism, democracy and the\r\npeaceful transfer of authority.\r\nWe have made important accomplishments\r\nin the reform and development of our\r\ngovernmental institutions and our financial\r\nsystem to prepare for the economic development\r\nproject that we wish to establish and that we will\r\nwork with the international community to\r\nachieve. In that context, I must express my\r\ngratitude to all brotherly and friendly States for\r\ntheir ongoing support, as well as for the outcomes\r\nof the London conference and the G-8 summit.\r\nOur people hope that the support will be\r\nincreased, because peace cannot be achieved in\r\npoverty and development cannot be achieved\r\nunder occupation.\r\nAllow me to take this opportunity to affirm\r\nour conviction in Palestine of the need for a\r\nstrong and reformed United Nations, including its\r\nSecurity Council, in order to confront the\r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century. We also\r\naffirm the need for compliance with the purposes\r\nand principles of the Charter and international\r\nlaw, particularly with regard to the protection of\r\nhuman rights, freedom and dignity, so that the\r\ninternational community can address the\r\nchallenges that face all of us, such as foreign\r\noccupation, international terrorism, the spread of\r\nweapons of mass destruction, poverty, hunger and\r\nepidemic diseases.\r\nFinally, we affirm that we, particularly\r\nthose of us in the Middle East, now stand at a\r\ncrossroads. Either we achieve real and effective\r\nprogress towards peace, stability, security,\r\nconstruction and coexistence, or we return to the\r\nvicious cycle, under the constant threat of\r\nviolence and terrorism, far from the real and\r\nnecessary solutions to the challenges that we\r\nface. I am confident that the Assembly will push\r\nfor the first option.\r\nThe meeting rose at 2.20 p.m.\r\n"
