(President of the Gabonese Republic)\r\nCo-Chairperson: Mr. Göran Persson . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Prime Minister of the Kingdon of Sweden)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAddresses on the occasion of the High-level Plenary\r\nMeeting (continued)\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Alvaro\r\nUribe Vélez, President of the Republic of Colombia.\r\nPresident Uribe Vélez (spoke in Spanish): Allow\r\nme to congratulate Sweden on its election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly.\r\nColombia reaffirms its commitment to the United\r\nNations and to a broad and inclusive multilateralism.\r\nThe reform process must have as its main objective the\r\nstrengthening of States and of their capacity to respond\r\neffectively to the needs of their populations. The\r\nMillennium Development Goals are achievable, so\r\nlong as we all make efforts and concessions.\r\nDeveloping countries will be able to meet the Goals\r\nwhen they are able to compete and to have free market\r\naccess. That could be made possible through the\r\nelimination of subsidies, in particular those that benefit\r\nagriculture in developed countries.\r\nWith the achievement of the Goals, in addition to\r\ndeepening an approach based on assistance and aid,\r\ncountries must consolidate their national capacities and\r\nprospects for sustainable development, which provide\r\nfor the generation of wealth, progress and prosperity.\r\nColombia understands that we must be make haste to\r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals so that in\r\ntime we can achieve the democratic legitimacy that\r\nemerges from security, public freedoms, the\r\nindependence of institutions and transparency.\r\nIn my country, we have incorporated the\r\nMillennium Development Goals into our national\r\ndevelopment plan and into a discussion project we\r\nhave named “Visión Colombia Segundo Centenario”,\r\nwhich will make it possible to achieve the Goals by\r\n2015.\r\nHand in hand with democratic security to defeat\r\nterrorism and to guarantee the freedoms of all my\r\ncompatriots, along with transparency and citizen\r\nparticipation to defeat corruption, we have made a\r\ncommitment to eradicate poverty and improve equity.\r\nToday, our social policy has seven pillars, some\r\nof which I would like to touch on.\r\nAn educational revolution, the axis of social\r\ncohesion, is the path by which we will be able to\r\nensure equity, a fair distribution of income and the\r\nopening of new channels of social services, without\r\nwhich democracy remains only half realized.\r\nWe must also focus on strengthening micro-\r\nbusiness and small and medium-sized enterprises in\r\norder to overcome the barriers blocking access to\r\ncredit. We so despise the discrimination that sullies\r\ndemocracy and social protection that we are committed\r\nwithin three years to ensure access to health services\r\nfor all the poor, to make strides in providing food for\r\n2\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nchildren and facilitate their access to education, and to\r\nprovide care for the elderly.\r\nBy the end of this year, Colombia’s goal is to\r\nhave 500,000 families with children in school\r\nreceiving State aid for the feeding and education of\r\ntheir children. In the near future that will rise to 1\r\nmillion families. This will ensure that they are part of\r\nthe educational revolution. By 2006, 10 million\r\nchildren will benefit from food aid programmes and\r\n570,000 elderly will receive financial and food\r\nsubsidies.\r\nWe are also making serious efforts to help the\r\ninternally displaced, aiding some 20,000 ex-\r\ncombatants from violent groups that have been\r\nreintegrated into society and 33,000 families in the\r\nGuardabosques forest protection programme, who are\r\npaid a stipend to give up drugs cultivation and who are\r\nnow helping both in the recovery of tropical forests as\r\nwell as keeping their areas free of illegal drugs. Aid to\r\nthose three sectors of society — the displaced, the\r\nreintegrated and the Guardabosques families — will\r\ncost $300 million in 2006 alone.\r\nWith regard to the reform of United Nations\r\norgans, we believe that bodies entrusted with\r\ndevelopment should be strengthened and made into real\r\nforums for addressing the issues facing developing\r\ncountries in all their diversity, including middle-\r\nincome countries.\r\nThe proposal to create a peacebuilding\r\ncommission must focus on establishing policies and\r\nstrategies for national development programmes and\r\ninitiatives for countries emerging from conflict.\r\nThe success of the United Nations will become\r\nclear when, having completed its mission, it withdraws\r\nfrom those countries that have asked for its help. It\r\nfails when it remains in place for decades and creates a\r\ndependency of the national structures on the\r\ninternational system. The United Nations fails when it\r\ntakes over the State’s responsibilities rather than\r\ncreating a national capacity for autonomous and\r\nindependent governance. The role of States cannot be\r\nreplaced by the Organization. Every nation must be\r\nendowed with the means and mechanisms to overcome\r\nchallenges and respond efficiently to the needs of its\r\npeople.\r\nRegarding the proposal to create a human rights\r\ncouncil, we believe that it must be approached with a\r\nview to cooperating with States and building national\r\ncapacity in each country. In the new council, the\r\npunitive approach and finger-pointing that have\r\npoliticized the matter and weakened the capacity of the\r\nUnited Nations to contribute and support States in the\r\npromotion and protection of human rights must not\r\nprevail.\r\nConsensus must guide decision-making in the\r\nreform process. Only in that way will it be possible to\r\nmeet the expectations of true and significant change.\r\nWe must all participate in the reform process,\r\nrespecting the principle of sovereign equality and\r\nguided by the principles and purposes of the United\r\nNations Charter.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Elías\r\nAntonio Saca González, President of the Republic of\r\nEl Salvador.\r\nPresident Saca González (spoke in Spanish): El\r\nSalvador sets great store by the United Nations as a\r\nforum for dialogue and understanding geared towards\r\ndeveloping forms of collective cooperation for\r\naddressing the global threats of the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nFrom that perspective, we have participated with\r\ngreat interest in the comprehensive reform process of\r\nthe United Nations system, in particular in order to\r\nendow it with greater democracy, transparency and\r\nlegitimacy to respond in a balanced manner to the\r\ninterests of all its Member States.\r\nWe believe that the outcome document of this\r\nMeeting will provide a basis for the ongoing process of\r\nchange that the Organization truly requires. However, I\r\nmust say that the outcome document does not meet our\r\nexpectations and that discussion must continue until a\r\nbroader consensus has been obtained. The\r\nimplementation of the commitments that have been\r\nmade will require effort, resources and, above all,\r\npolitical resolve on the part of States. We believe that\r\nthe United Nations, with its wealth of experience, is\r\nthe ideal institution for coordinating and harmonizing\r\ninternational cooperation towards consolidating those\r\nefforts, in particular with respect to fulfilling the\r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nI wish to touch upon several issues that I feel to\r\nbe of particular interest and great relevance to the goals\r\nwe have established.\r\n3\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nEl Salvador shares the view that democracy does\r\nnot belong to any single country or region. Instead, it is\r\na universal right and our country therefore supports the\r\nestablishment of the democracy fund.\r\nWe all know the negative impact that global\r\nchallenges have had on peace, security, stability and\r\nthe development of peoples. We believe that the most\r\nsuitable mechanism for addressing such challenges is\r\none based on global consensus and collective security,\r\nas enshrined in the Charter. In that context, we warmly\r\nwelcome the proposal to establish a peacebuilding\r\ncommission. We believe that such a commission would\r\nchannel the peacebuilding processes by establishing\r\nclose links between peacebuilding, political\r\nagreements, and short-, medium- and long-term\r\nsecurity and development.\r\nIn all humility and great confidence, I reaffirm\r\nthat the people of El Salvador offer one of the best\r\nexamples of a true desire for peace. After many years\r\nof deadly conflict, the peace agreements of 1992 came\r\ninto force under the auspices of this Organization and\r\nwith the cooperation of friendly Governments. That, in\r\nturn, paved the way for the people of El Salvador to\r\nforge a society that now lives in peace and democracy\r\nand fights for its well-being and development.\r\nMy Government feels that comprehensive\r\ndevelopment must be one of the fundamental and\r\npriority objectives of the United Nations. We fully\r\nsupport the concept linking it intrinsically and\r\ninterdependently to peace and security. We are\r\ncommitted to the Millennium Development Goals and\r\nsupport the establishment of a global partnership for\r\ndevelopment, which we feel should be based on\r\nsolidarity and generosity, taking account of the\r\ndifferences between regions and countries, their level\r\nof development, capacities, resources and constraints.\r\nEl Salvador wishes to draw the attention of the\r\ninternational community to the category of low and\r\nmedium income countries, to which we belong. Given\r\nour level of development, we have been marginalized\r\nfrom international cooperation, which has had an\r\nimpact on our national development programmes and\r\nour attainment of the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nWe believe that a special mechanism could be\r\nestablished to valorize the efforts of States to\r\nimplement economic and social programmes and to\r\nfulfil the Millennium Development Goals. It would\r\nserve as a basis for identifying special treatment in\r\ntechnical and financial cooperation programmes as a\r\nway to reward and motivate such domestic\r\ndevelopment policies.\r\nIn that context, we feel that it is important to be\r\nable to depend on international support for the creation\r\nof innovative development financing mechanisms,\r\nincluding the cancellation of foreign debt in favour of\r\nsocial programmes, especially in the areas of education\r\nand health care.\r\nFive years ago, we committed ourselves to\r\nattaining the Millennium Development Goals, and our\r\npeople has expectantly watched us work towards their\r\naccomplishment. Fair and balanced globalization has\r\nprovided many with an opportunity to progress towards\r\ngreater development, and each and every country must\r\nshoulder its responsibility for accomplishing its own\r\ndevelopment agenda. We know that all national efforts\r\nmust be supplemented and complemented by the\r\nsolidarity and cooperation of the international\r\ncommunity. As leaders, we are duty-bound to redouble\r\nour efforts to fully meet those objectives, and thus to\r\nwork to improve the living conditions of all humankind\r\nby shaping a world that is freer, safer and free from\r\nmisery for all — a task to which we remain fully\r\ncommitted.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Bharrat Jagdeo, President of the Republic of\r\nGuyana.\r\nPresident Jagdeo: The international development\r\ngoals, especially the Millennium Development Goals,\r\nwhich we set ourselves at the Millennium Summit five\r\nyears ago and which we are called upon to review at\r\nthis Meeting, have been a major benchmark for\r\ndevelopment. Addressing as they do such fundamentals\r\nas health and education, they constitute important\r\nprerequisites for our economic and social\r\nadvancement.\r\nDespite serious financial and human constraints,\r\nmy country has made appreciable progress towards\r\nthose objectives. Through a progressive poverty-\r\nreduction strategy and the allocation of more budgetary\r\nresources to the social sector, we have managed to\r\nreach the poor in our society and to provide them with\r\nincreased opportunities to improve their lives.\r\nSad to say, however, our hard-won gains are now\r\nthreatened by forces and influences that are well\r\n4\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nbeyond our control. An example of this is the fact that,\r\nalthough Europe has declared support for the\r\nMillennium Development Goals, the European\r\nCommission has nonetheless made proposals to\r\ndrastically reduce the price of sugar exports from the\r\nAfrican, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States, which,\r\nif implemented, will deal a devastating blow to their\r\neconomies, forcing a large number of people into\r\nextreme poverty. In the case of Guyana, our economy\r\nstands to lose some $40 million per annum, a sum that\r\nnegates the $8 million in debt relief which is expected\r\nto flow from the recent G-8 decisions. That action is\r\ntypical of some developed countries, which, while\r\ngiving with great fanfare some assistance to the\r\ndeveloping countries, quietly take away even more\r\nthrough harmful trade and economic policies. Worse\r\nyet, despite their asseverations of partnership and\r\ncommitment to consultation and coherence, they decide\r\nunilaterally on measures that adversely affect the lives\r\nof millions in the developing countries. As it is,\r\ntherefore, we will be hard put to achieve the\r\nMillennium Development Goals within the time-frames\r\nset.\r\nAltogether, our experience — one that I know is\r\nshared by many others — has been daunting. We\r\ncannot but conclude that, while the realization of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals provides the necessary\r\nfoundation for national development, adequate\r\neconomic and social progress cannot be achieved in the\r\nabsence of a more comprehensive framework that\r\nencompasses significant development and investment\r\nflows, wider debt relief, more equitable trade and\r\neconomic cooperation as well as the transfer of science\r\nand technology for development purposes.\r\nThese economic and social challenges are made,\r\nas the Secretary-General’s report reminds us, all the\r\ngreater by the political insecurity that is the defining\r\nreality of today’s world. The threats to the security of\r\nStates — more particularly small and vulnerable\r\nones — have been greatly magnified by the spread of\r\nterrorism, transboundary crime, disease, arms and drug\r\ntrafficking. Most of our countries are ill-equipped,\r\nbecause of scarce resources, to defend themselves\r\nagainst such encroachments.\r\nContemporary circumstances have brought us to a\r\nwatershed moment. The multiplication of threats to our\r\ncommon existence, whatever their genesis, represents\r\nas foreboding a scenario as any the scourge of war\r\ncould conjure up. We must act to contain such dangers\r\nby strengthening the United Nations so that it can\r\nperform its functions.\r\nFor more than a decade, we have been engaged in\r\nthe examination of ways and means to reform the\r\nUnited Nations. On the basis of the recommendations\r\nthat have emerged, we must take action at this session\r\nof the General Assembly to make the Organization\r\nmore democratic in its decision-making and more\r\neffective in the discharge of the many mandates with\r\nwhich it has been entrusted.\r\nOf particular urgency is the need to reform the\r\nSecurity Council — the organ responsible for the\r\nmaintenance of global peace and security — to allow it\r\nbetter to cope with the various threats to our safe and\r\nsecure existence. The records of the Working Group\r\nwhich was set up for this purpose will show that\r\nwidespread agreement had been reached on the\r\nexpansion of the Council in both categories of\r\nmembership to provide greater balance in\r\nrepresentation and greater credibility to the Council’s\r\nactivities. This has presented us with a window of\r\nopportunity which, if we do not take advantage of it,\r\nmay close again and remain indefinitely closed.\r\nLet us therefore not be faint-hearted, but rather\r\nboldly accelerate and complete the process of reform,\r\nso that the principles and purposes for which the\r\nUnited Nations stands may be fully implemented.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Alhaji\r\nAhmad Tejan Kabbah, President of the Republic of\r\nSierra Leone.\r\nPresident Kabbah: This summit offers us a\r\nunique opportunity to improve the effectiveness of the\r\nUnited Nations system and to further strengthen\r\ninternational cooperation for global security and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe events of the past few days clearly\r\ndemonstrate that we all are deeply committed to the\r\nachievement of those objectives. It is also clear that\r\ndifferences remain among us on the appropriate\r\nmethods for accomplishing our objectives, as reflected\r\nin the outcome document that is before us for adoption.\r\nWe note the general progress that has been made\r\nby many countries towards the achievement of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). We are\r\nconcerned, however, that many sub-Saharan countries,\r\n5\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nparticularly post-conflict countries, have not achieved\r\nas much as their efforts would have justified.\r\nWe are encouraged by the fact that several\r\ninitiatives, including those by the Africa Commission,\r\nchaired by The Right Honourable Tony Blair, have\r\nbeen proposed to identify the obstacles to our progress\r\nand to determine the appropriate strategies for\r\novercoming them.\r\nMany of the recommendations from these\r\ninitiatives have already been endorsed by the donor\r\ncommunity, including the G-8 and multilateral\r\nfinancial institutions. We therefore urge that their\r\nimplementation be accelerated, particularly in the areas\r\nof financing for infrastructural development,\r\nagriculture and capacity-building in the public sector.\r\nWe should also move quickly to restructure the\r\npartnership between the donor community and\r\nrecipient countries to allow for greater flexibility in the\r\nutilization of development assistance and better\r\nrecognition of the development priorities set by our\r\ncountries.\r\nEfforts should also be made by the six out of 22\r\ndonor countries that have not pledged to achieve the\r\n0.7 per cent of gross national product (GNP) for\r\nofficial development assistance, since their GNPs add\r\nup to roughly half of the global total.\r\nWithin our limited capacity, we have made\r\nconsiderable efforts to create a conducive environment\r\nfor achieving the MDGS through the strengthening of\r\ndemocratic institutions, including the judicial system\r\nand public accountability mechanisms, principally the\r\nanticorruption commission. We have also decentralized\r\nGovernment to allow local communities to have greater\r\nsay in the way they are governed and to be able to hold\r\npublic officials accountable. We are restructuring our\r\npublic financial management system to enhance\r\ntransparency in the use of public funds. We have\r\nestablished an independent public procurement\r\nauthority and introduced regular public expenditure\r\ntracking systems.\r\nWe have also developed a poverty-reduction\r\nstrategy paper and adopted a national plan for meeting\r\nthe MDGS. These actions are complemented by a far-\r\nreaching restructuring of our security institutions,\r\nnamely the police and the armed forces, in order to\r\nenhance their operational effectiveness in defending\r\nthe security of our country and to strengthen their\r\nrespect for human rights.\r\nWith the assistance and cooperation of\r\nUNAMSIL and the International Military Advisory and\r\nTraining Team, the Republic of Sierra Leone Armed\r\nForces have assumed their full constitutional\r\nresponsibility for the security of the State. We have\r\nalso made special efforts to consolidate the peace by\r\npromoting national cohesion and by addressing the\r\nspecial needs of war victims, including through the\r\npayment of reparations as provided for by the Lomé\r\nPeace Agreement. In this connection, we would\r\nappreciate contributions from the international\r\ncommunity towards the operationalization of a trust\r\nfund to be set up for that purpose.\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General that the\r\ndraft outcome document provides a basis for\r\nrecommendations to reform the Organization. We\r\nwelcome the agreements reached on several elements\r\nof the reform process, including the establishment of a\r\nPeacebuilding Commission and a Human Rights\r\nCouncil, as well as the conclusion of an international\r\ninstrument against terrorism. We also welcome\r\nprogress in the negotiations in the areas of Secretariat\r\nand management reform, impunity, peacekeeping and\r\nagreement to support the development of capacity-\r\nbuilding programmes within the African Union over a\r\nperiod of 10 years.\r\nWe urge that effective measures be taken to\r\nimplement decisions that have already been agreed, so\r\nthat we can build a foundation for rapid progress\r\ntowards reaching agreement on the outstanding issues.\r\nIt is important to quickly resume negotiations on such\r\noutstanding issues as the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil and related institutions of the United Nations,\r\nin order to take full advantage of understandings\r\nalready reached in other areas.\r\nSpeaking from this rostrum at the Millennium\r\nSummit five years ago, I, like other leaders, referred to\r\nthe imperative of adaptation. We urged the United\r\nNations to continue to adapt and equip itself to deal\r\nwith the perennial problems of human insecurity and\r\nunderdevelopment and, in particular, the new\r\nmanifestations of those problems, namely, terrorism\r\nand extreme poverty. Five years on, rather than\r\nsubsiding, those problems seem to have escalated,\r\nposing serious threats to international peace and\r\nsecurity. We must therefore strengthen our resolve to\r\nadopt effective measures to eradicate those problems.\r\nA reinvigorated United Nations can play a crucial role\r\nin this endeavour.\r\n6\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, President of the\r\nRepublic of Uganda.\r\nPresident Museveni: I am not able to read out\r\nmy entire statement, as it is long; I will just summarize it.\r\nRegarding the Millennium Development Goals\r\n(MDGs), I would like to make three points. First, they\r\nare good minimum targets for the human race.\r\nSecondly, Uganda will not only achieve those Goals,\r\nbut will surpass them — a factor highlighted by our\r\nachievement of a human development index (HDI)\r\nrating of 0.508, terrorism in northern Uganda and other\r\nforms of interference notwithstanding. Thirdly, I\r\nsuggest better prioritization in our strategy to achieve\r\nthese goals.\r\nFirst, these are, obviously, good minimum\r\ndevelopment and social goals. Following the Second\r\nWorld War and the emergence of the welfare State in\r\nWestern countries, societies in North America, Western\r\nEurope and Japan attained and surpassed goals\r\ncomparable to the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nSome of the formerly colonized Asian countries have\r\ndone likewise. The challenge is to spread such\r\nachievements to the rest of the world. Hence the\r\ndecisions of the 2000 Millennium Summit.\r\nSecondly, Uganda will achieve those Goals. Our\r\ntarget of poverty eradication is not 28 per cent by 2015,\r\nbut 10 per cent by 2017. In spite of the vicious\r\nterrorism campaign orchestrated against us by some of\r\nour neighbours for much of the 1990s, as well as the\r\nmistake of underspending on defence at one stage,\r\nUganda’s HDI value is now 0.508, and we have entered\r\nthe medium-performing group of countries, having\r\ngraduated from the low-performing group.\r\nWe have performed beyond the targets set in the\r\nfollowing areas: the provision of safe drinking water;\r\nprimary school enrolment; HIV/AIDS; and reducing\r\npoverty levels. Our performance in infant mortality and\r\nmaternal mortality has not been so good.\r\nThe Bible, in Matthew 6:33, says, “Seek ye first\r\nthe kingdom of God and ... all these things shall be\r\nadded unto you”. My recommendation is that we first\r\nseek human resource development, that is, education\r\nand health for all; add value to the raw materials of\r\nAfrica and the other backwater countries, which have\r\nbeen stolen for centuries; and expand trade-related\r\ninfrastructure and increase market access to internal,\r\nregional and international markets. And then the rest\r\nwill be added unto us. In other words, we need to\r\nempower each country, at the earliest opportunity, in\r\norder to be able to endogenously generate resources\r\nthat will fuel the sustainable implementation of the\r\nMDGs in each country.\r\nHow will external aid sustainably fuel this\r\nimplementation, given the complications and possible\r\ndistortions that are concomitant with aid relationships?\r\nAid-led vision has never worked. Vision-led aid can\r\nwork; but such aid is not always available. Mr.\r\nMcNamara, the former President of the World Bank,\r\nrecently told me how glad he was that the South\r\nKoreans ignored his advice in the 1960s. He had\r\nopposed their plans to build an integrated steel\r\nindustry.\r\nIn Uganda, most of our successes have been\r\nattained in the face of opposition, indifference or\r\ndistracting, superficial heckling by quite a number of\r\nour external partners. I do not have time to go into all\r\nthe details, but they can be read in my written\r\nstatement. My question is, how can we sustainably\r\nimplement the MDGs by depending on aid alone? The\r\nfuture of Uganda and the future of Africa is our\r\nresponsibility; it cannot be the responsibility of the\r\ndonors — I do not like this emphasis on donors, as if\r\nthey are the ones who own our countries. We are the\r\nones who own those countries, and we are the ones to\r\ndevelop them primarily, with assistance from other\r\npeople.\r\nThe 2005 Human Development Report states, on\r\npage 117,\r\n“Sub-Saharan Africa graphically demonstrates\r\nhow losses from trade can outweigh the benefits\r\nassociated with aid and debt relief. If Africa\r\nenjoyed the same share of the world exports today\r\nas it did in 1980, its exports today would be some\r\n$119 billion higher (in constant 2000 dollars). That\r\nis equivalent to about five times aid flows and\r\nbudget savings from debt service relief provided by\r\nhigh-income countries in 2002.”\r\nThus, the money we are getting from aid is much,\r\nmuch less than we would earn from the removal of\r\ntrade distortions.\r\nI have two final points. My first point is in the\r\nform of a question to the General Assembly, and it is\r\n7\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nincluded in my statement. How can the MDGs be met\r\nif we do not solve the problem of employment, of job\r\ncreation? Will aid alone solve this problem? If we look\r\nat the structure of employment comparing the United\r\nKingdom and Uganda, the picture is as follows. In the\r\nUnited Kingdom, the people who work in agriculture\r\nare only 1.5 per cent of the working population. In\r\nUganda, that figure is 82 per cent. The number\r\nemployed in industry in the United Kingdom is 19.1\r\nper cent versus 5 per cent in Uganda. Services, in the\r\ncase of the United Kingdom, weigh in at 79 per cent; in\r\nthe case of Uganda, that figure is 13 per cent. This is\r\nthe crux of the problem — a backward society. Can we\r\nmaintain a backward society and, at the same time,\r\nachieve these MDGs, even if the countries of the\r\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and\r\nDevelopment give aid up to the level of 0.7 per cent, as\r\nrequired?\r\nHere, I would mention that my statement is\r\navailable in written form, and I would like delegates to\r\nread all of it. It is 12 pages long; I could not read it out\r\nwithin the five-minute limit.\r\nIn conclusion: seek ye first Human Resource\r\nDevelopment — that is to say, education and health for\r\nall — value added — that is to say, industrializing our\r\ncountries — expanded trade-related infrastructure —\r\nand the rest shall be added unto you.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Joseph\r\nUrusemal, President of the Federated States of\r\nMicronesia.\r\nPresident Urusemal: We gather this year against\r\nthe backdrop of many recent natural disasters. The\r\ndespair caused by these natural disasters and their\r\napocalyptic nature has shocked us all. Please allow me\r\nto offer, on behalf of my Government and people, our\r\ndeepest sympathy and sincere condolences to the\r\nGovernment and people of the United States and to\r\nother Governments whose people have been devastated\r\nby the ravages and furies of these natural calamities.\r\nThe recent spate of devastation caused by these\r\nnatural disasters brings into sharper focus the extreme\r\nvulnerability of low-lying coastal areas and small\r\nisland developing States. It further highlights the\r\ndaunting challenges posed by extreme weather on our\r\nability to achieve the Millennium Development Goals\r\n(MDGs) and to pursue sustainable development.\r\nNo amount of engineering advances can fully\r\ndefend and save our small island developing States and\r\nlow-lying coastal areas from the perils of the surging\r\nwaters and rising tides of the sea, caused by the\r\nadverse impact of climate change. The stronger and\r\nmore frequent hurricanes and typhoons in the\r\nCaribbean and the Pacific yet again prove this fact.\r\nI am convinced, however, that if all nations,\r\ndeveloped and developing, in this Assembly approach\r\nthe critical problem of climate change and global\r\nwarming in a concerted effort, what no engineering\r\nfeat can arrest will and can be mitigated by renewed\r\npolitical will and commitment to carry out our\r\nobligations pursuant to the United Nations Framework\r\nConvention on Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol\r\nand other relevant international agreements. We,\r\ntherefore, appeal to those countries that have not\r\nratified the Kyoto Protocol to do so without delay.\r\nOur global world demands concerted global\r\naction to mitigate the adverse impact of climate\r\nchange. My delegation has strongly supported the call\r\nto initiate negotiations to develop a more inclusive\r\ninternational framework for climate change beyond\r\n2012. To be effective and of any relevance, the\r\nframework must include all major emitters, both\r\ndeveloped and developing countries. In this vein, let us\r\napproach the concept of common but differentiated\r\nresponsibilities, not as a licence to pollute but as a\r\nmandate to preserve Mother Earth.\r\nFive years ago we committed ourselves to the\r\nMillennium Declaration. The MDGs remain relevant as\r\nthe basis of our sustainable development.\r\nUnfortunately, it is the experience of my country, and\r\nour general observation in Micronesia, that we face an\r\nuphill battle in meeting and implementing these Goals.\r\nIt is widely recognized that Oceania remains one of the\r\nidentified regions of the world that is worst off in\r\nmeeting its Millennium Development Goals. Even with\r\nthis recognition, we find more often than not that the\r\ninternational community has not followed up with fair\r\nand proportionate allocation of resources to these more\r\nvulnerable small island developing States. For too\r\nlong, our islands of the Pacific have been overlooked.\r\nWe, therefore, appeal to the United Nations and\r\nthe international donor community to apply a fair and\r\nmore proportionate allocation of development\r\nassistance to our region if we are to achieve these\r\ngoals.\r\n8\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nWe are very encouraged by the commitments\r\nmade by many developed members of this\r\nOrganization to meet the internationally agreed goals\r\nof 0.5 per cent of gross national product as official\r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) by 2010 and 0.7 per\r\ncent by no later than 2015. As a beneficiary of this\r\ndevelopment assistance, Micronesia remains grateful\r\nfor the support of our donor partners and the\r\ninternational donor community for the continued\r\nassistance extended to us. We support the call made by\r\nmany in this Assembly to those countries that have not\r\ndone so to make every effort to achieve the agreed\r\ngoals of ODA.\r\nWhile grateful for the assistance of the United\r\nNations in our national development efforts, we\r\nrecognize the need for further strengthening of\r\ncooperation and closer linkage between the United\r\nNations and many of its Member States in the Pacific,\r\nsuch as my country. I refer here to the need to establish\r\na physical presence of the United Nations system\r\nwithin our national borders. The United Nations system\r\nmust be seen to be directly involved in our\r\ndevelopment process and our national efforts to\r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals on a\r\nsustained and regular basis. Such presence can only\r\ncontribute to better coordination, strengthening our\r\ncapacity, a more effective use of resources and an\r\neffective delivery of assistance. It would demonstrate\r\nthe United Nations system’s commitment to its most\r\nvulnerable members.\r\nIn this era of advances in information and\r\ncommunication technology, my Government applauds\r\nthe United Nations and the International\r\nTelecommunication Union for their commitment to\r\nensuring that information and communication\r\ntechnologies are placed in the service of humankind in\r\nthe ongoing noble task of economic development. For\r\nisland countries like the Federated States of\r\nMicronesia, whose population is spread over a vast\r\narea of the Pacific Ocean, access to reliable and\r\naffordable information and communication technology\r\nis critical to our nation-building. It is for this reason\r\nthat my Government strongly supports the Declaration\r\nof Principles and Plan of Action as adopted during the\r\nfirst phase of the World Summit on the Information\r\nSociety and looks forward to the convening of the\r\nsecond phase in Tunisia in November 2005.\r\nEver since the earliest days of the Trust Territory\r\nof the Pacific Islands, the people of Micronesia have\r\nplaced their faith in the United Nations Charter. As we\r\nleave this critical High-level Plenary Meeting, that\r\nfaith is refreshed and strengthened. I call upon all\r\nMember States to apply the outcome of this meeting in\r\norder to achieve real momentum towards enrichment of\r\nthe lives of all people, especially the most needy\r\namong us.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Anote\r\nTong, President of the Republic of Kiribati.\r\nPresident Tong: It is indeed a pleasure for me to\r\nrepresent the people of Kiribati at this august\r\ngathering, to extend their greetings to all and to present\r\ntheir views on the agenda before us.\r\nAt the outset, allow me to thank our gracious\r\nhost, the people and Government of the United States\r\nof America for their hospitality. Allow me also to\r\ncongratulate our Co-Chairpersons for their effective\r\nleadership of this meeting, which I am confident, will\r\nbe successful.\r\nWe gather here on the sixtieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations, confronted with the daunting and\r\nongoing challenge of making this world in which we\r\nall live better for us, our children and our children’s\r\nchildren. The task before us is not an easy one. The\r\ndecisions we must make here will affect the future of\r\nthis Organization and the future of humanity.\r\nWe all agree that development, in particular\r\nsustainable development, is fundamental to the\r\nachievement of international peace and security. We\r\nalso agree that the main responsibility for the\r\nachievement of sustainable development lies, in the\r\nfirst instance, with individual countries, but we also\r\nacknowledge the fact that developing countries, in\r\nparticular small island developing States, cannot\r\nachieve this on their own.\r\nA more effective and meaningful partnership is\r\nrequired in order to achieve sustainable development.\r\nThe framework for these partnerships has been\r\ndeveloped over the past sixty years and includes\r\ninternational initiatives, such as the Johannesburg Plan\r\nof Implementation, the Brussels Programme of Action\r\nfor Least Developed Countries, the Mauritius Strategy,\r\nthe Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States and\r\nthe Monterrey Consensus.\r\n9\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nRegional initiatives, such as the Pacific Plan,\r\nhave also been or are in the process of being developed\r\nto encourage South-South cooperation. These\r\ninitiatives will also benefit from these partnerships.\r\nMy Government is committed to fulfilling the\r\ndevelopment aspirations of our people. Our national\r\npolicy objective is to achieve the equitable distribution\r\nof development benefits to all our people based on the\r\nprinciples of good governance.\r\nWe are committed to the Millennium Declaration\r\nand are on track in our national efforts to achieve the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. These have been\r\nintegrated and mainstreamed into our national\r\ndevelopment strategy formulated through a\r\nmultisectoral and multi-stakeholder consultative\r\nprocess.\r\nImplementation of our national development\r\nstrategy is progressing positively. This is a result of a\r\ngood partnership that has been forged between my\r\nGovernment, our development partners, civil society\r\nand the private sector. We recognize and value the\r\ninputs and involvement of all stakeholders in the\r\ndevelopment process.\r\nWe acknowledge the invaluable support our\r\ndevelopment partners have extended and call on them\r\nto assist in the implementation of the initiatives\r\nmentioned earlier, especially for the developing\r\ncountries and the small island developing States.\r\nWe recall their commitment to increase their\r\nofficial development assistance to a level equivalent to\r\n0.7 per cent of their gross national income. We applaud\r\nthose countries that have voluntarily met these targets\r\nand call upon those which have yet to do so to exert\r\nmore effort in this regard.\r\nWe firmly believe that we are able to achieve\r\nsustainable development and reduce reliance on\r\ninternational aid assistance. The abundant fisheries\r\nresources within our exclusive economic zone —\r\ncurrently being harvested exclusively by distant-water\r\nfishing nations — could provide the basis for this. We\r\nare encouraged by the ongoing negotiations for an\r\neconomic partnership agreement with the European\r\nUnion in the area of fisheries, because this provides an\r\nopportunity for a genuine partnership through\r\ninvestment in this sector.\r\nWe seek to maximize returns from our fisheries\r\nresources and to this end endorse the report on the\r\nwork of the United Nations Open-ended Informal\r\nConsultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the Sea\r\nat its sixth meeting. We welcome in particular the\r\nconclusions that: resource owners should participate in\r\nfisheries activities in order to achieve better economic\r\nreturns and to enhance their role in resource\r\nmanagement; distant-water fishing nations should\r\nnegotiate access agreements with developing coastal\r\nStates on a basis that is equitable and sustainable; and\r\ndistant-water fishing nations should increase\r\nprogressively the participation of coastal States in\r\nfisheries activities, including the processing of the\r\ncatch within the territory of the resource owners,\r\nthereby creating employment and further contributing\r\nto the sustainable development of developing coastal\r\nStates.\r\nWe note with deep regret and concern the\r\ndevastating impact of Hurricane Katrina in New\r\nOrleans, causing thousands of deaths and extensive\r\ndamage. We offer our deepest sympathies to those\r\naffected by this natural calamity and pray that they find\r\npeace and comfort during this difficult time.\r\nThis recent disaster is a stark reminder of the\r\nextreme vulnerability of all mankind, regardless of\r\nnationality, to the forces of nature. A vulnerability that\r\nis so many times magnified for low-lying small-island\r\nStates like Kiribati. I would like to place on record\r\ntoday our invitation to this august gathering to\r\nundertake a risk assessment of the likelihood of similar\r\ndisasters occurring in small-island States and to make a\r\nconscious decision on the most appropriate response.\r\nWe commend and are grateful for the efforts of\r\nthose organizations and countries that are assisting us\r\nin our efforts to adapt to the short-term effects of\r\nclimate change. But, given the small land masses of\r\nlow-lying coral atolls, there is a limit to the extent to\r\nwhich their populations can adapt.\r\nWith regard to peace and security, we agree that\r\nthe foundation for sustainable development is a\r\npeaceful, secure and stable environment.\r\nWe are committed to international efforts aimed\r\nat disarmament and non-proliferation. In that regard,\r\nwe have become a party to major international treaties\r\non this subject.\r\nThe new global challenges posed by terrorism\r\nand transnational organized crime do not respect\r\nborders. We must not be complacent in our efforts to\r\n10\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\ncollectively tackle those challenges. Kiribati is\r\ncommitted to the international fight against terrorism\r\nand transnational organized crime. I am pleased that\r\nyesterday, I signed the thirteenth counter-terrorism\r\nconvention and deposited with the Secretary-General\r\nour instruments of accession to four of the counter-\r\nterrorism conventions and major treaties on\r\ntransnational organized crime. Soon, we will also be\r\nacceding to the remaining eight counter-terrorism\r\nconventions and depositing our instruments of\r\naccession with the appropriate depositaries.\r\nWe have also adopted legislation to implement all\r\ncounter-terrorism conventions and major treaties on\r\ntransnational organized crime. While this is an\r\nimportant step forward, the challenge of effectively\r\nenforcing and implementing the legislation still lies\r\nahead. We will therefore continue to need assistance in\r\nthose areas that are beyond our capacity.\r\nWith regard to strengthening the United Nations,\r\nKiribati firmly supports comprehensive reform of the\r\nOrganization to better align and equip it to respond\r\neffectively to the challenges of this ever-changing\r\nworld. We also support the provision of sufficient\r\nresources to the Organization to enable it to fulfil its\r\nmandated role on the basis of equitability and\r\ndifferentiated responsibilities.\r\nWe reaffirm our commitment to the values and\r\nprinciples upon which the United Nations was founded.\r\nWe recall Article 4 of the Charter, which invites “all\r\nother peace-loving states” to join this global\r\nOrganization. To that end, we reiterate our call for the\r\nOrganization to discard its exclusionary practices and\r\nembrace as equal partners all nations, such as Taiwan,\r\nthat are able and willing to contribute to international\r\ncollaborative efforts in the pursuit of global peace,\r\nsecurity and development. For it is only when all\r\nnations are treated as equal partners in the international\r\ncommunity that we can expect significant strides to be\r\nmade in our collective efforts.\r\nConcerning the Security Council, Kiribati\r\nsupports the expansion of the permanent and non-\r\npermanent Council memberships to better reflect the\r\nrealities of our world today. We strongly believe that\r\nMember States that are major contributors to United\r\nNations programmes, especially those involving the\r\nmaintenance of global peace and security, should be\r\naccorded permanent membership.\r\nWe note that a deadline has not been set for the\r\nfinalization of negotiations on Security Council reform,\r\nand we urge that the same deadline for other\r\ncomponents of reform — for example, the\r\nestablishment of a Human Rights Council — be\r\napplied to Security Council reform to maintain the\r\nmomentum of the process.\r\nOur peoples demand that we, as world leaders,\r\nwork individually and collectively to improve the\r\nworld in which we live. That is an important\r\nresponsibility we owe to the people we serve. To fulfil\r\nthat responsibility, we need to work together and\r\naddress the challenges we all recognize: challenges to\r\ndevelopment, challenges to security in its widest\r\ncontext and challenges to our working together as an\r\ninternational community.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Charles Gyude Bryant, Chairman of the National\r\nTransitional Government of the Republic of Liberia.\r\nMr. Bryant: The people of Liberia extend their\r\nprofound thanks to the United Nations for its continued\r\nassistance in dealing with the challenges that our\r\ncountry has faced. Indeed, we are grateful to all who\r\nhave stood by us, and continue to do so, to bring about\r\nthe significant transformation we see in our country\r\ntoday. We wish to acknowledge the invaluable role\r\nbeing played by the United Nations Mission in Liberia\r\nand by the troop-contributing countries.\r\nWith the critical assistance of the United Nations\r\nand with commendable donor partnership, our\r\nTransitional Government has made definite gains in the\r\nexecution of its mandate. The guns are silent, our\r\ndisarmament and demobilization process has been a\r\nresounding success, rehabilitation and reintegration are\r\nongoing, our people are returning to their communities,\r\nGovernment authority has been extended throughout\r\nthe country and elections are on schedule for\r\n11 October.\r\nAlthough there is a shortfall in funding for the\r\ncritical elements of reintegration and security sector\r\nreform, those processes are also ongoing. Let me\r\nemphasize that the net effect of successful reintegration\r\nand security sector reform in Liberia will be\r\nsustainable peace and stability not only for our country,\r\nbut for the entire West Africa subregion.\r\n11\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nThere is an encouraging sense of renewed hope in\r\nthe emergence of democratic and stable post-conflict\r\ncountries in our region. However, the challenges of\r\nrebuilding communities and directing people —\r\nparticularly our young people — away from deviant\r\nsocial behaviours remain daunting.\r\nSixty years ago, our country was among those\r\nthat brought this institution into being. Since then,\r\nglobal priorities have changed. Millions of the world’s\r\npeople — particularly women and children — continue\r\nto live in life-threatening poverty and ignorance. More\r\nthan 20,000 people die daily because of poverty and\r\ndiseases; yet, many of those diseases are preventable\r\nand curable.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration and the Brussels\r\nProgramme of Action offer realistic ways forward to\r\neffectively overcome such worldwide scourges as\r\npoverty, global warming, HIV/AIDS, malaria, cancer\r\nand other fatal diseases, particularly as they affect\r\npoorer Member States.\r\nWe believe that Member States must commit\r\nthemselves now, more than ever before, to respect\r\nhuman rights and the dignity of all persons,\r\nirrespective of the size and global standing of their\r\nrespective countries. This approach can help to\r\nminimize the polarization of international politics as\r\nwe have known it, especially since in recent history,\r\nour world has witnessed the exploitation of the poor\r\nnot only by rich nations, but also by rich individuals in\r\npoor countries in support of terrorism. That is why my\r\nGovernment fully supports the ongoing consultations\r\nfor reform of the United Nations. We must however,\r\nensure that the reform process is based on broad\r\nconsultation and consensus involving all Member\r\nStates.\r\nThe success of Liberia’s transition process thus\r\nfar demonstrates how much can be achieved by the\r\ninternational community through the United Nations.\r\nLet me seize this opportunity to once again thank the\r\nSecretary-General, Kofi Annan, under whose inspired\r\nleadership the international community rallied to our\r\ncause. We will continue to count on the international\r\ncommunity as we strive to peacefully attain the last\r\ncomponent of our two-year mandate — the holding of\r\nfree, fair and transparent elections — and thereafter\r\nundertake the overwhelming post-conflict\r\nreconstruction agenda that awaits the democratically\r\nelected Government in a conflict-free Liberia.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): I would like at\r\nthis point to inform members of the programme of\r\nwork for this closing meeting of the High-level Plenary\r\nMeeting. First, we will continue to hear statements by\r\nMember States, which will be followed by brief oral\r\nsummaries of the work of the four round tables.\r\nThereafter, the Assembly will take action on draft\r\nresolution A/60/L.1, entitled “2005 World Summit\r\nOutcome”. The Secretary-General will be present at the\r\ntime of the adoption of the draft resolution. After that,\r\nthe Assembly will continue with the remaining\r\nspeakers. That will be followed by closing remarks by\r\nthe Co-Chairpersons and the closure of the High-level\r\nPlenary Meeting.\r\nFor us to avoid working late in the evening, it is\r\nnow very important that statements not exceed five\r\nminutes. I appeal to all to respect that time limit.\r\nAs members are aware, draft resolution A/60/L.1,\r\nwhich contains the draft 2005 world summit outcome,\r\nwas distributed during the meeting this morning. In\r\nthat connection, I would like to inform members that\r\nthe draft resolution contains a few technical errors: in\r\nparagraphs 60 (a), 163 and 164 (c). The correct version\r\nof those paragraphs is now being distributed in the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddresses on the occasion of the High-level Plenary\r\nMeeting (continued)\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Emile\r\nLahoud, President of the Lebanese Republic.\r\nPresident Lahoud: I am honoured to represent\r\nmy country at this extremely important meeting of\r\nworld leaders to assess action on the commitments we\r\nmade at the Millennium Summit five years ago, most\r\nnotably on upholding the principles of human dignity,\r\nequality and justice and on the establishment of a just\r\nand permanent peace worldwide, and to review the\r\nsteps taken and achieved in that regard.\r\nAllow me to commend the Co-Chairpersons and\r\nthank them for their fine handling of the Meeting and\r\ntheir efforts to ensure the Meeting’s success. I would\r\nlike also to thank the Secretary-General, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Kofi Annan, for all his endeavours and,\r\nmost notably, for his valuable report entitled “In larger\r\nfreedom” (A/59/2005), which provides a precise\r\n12\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\ndiagnosis of our world’s challenges and problems and a\r\nblueprint for a new era of cooperation in tackling them.\r\nSecurity challenges to our world stand out as\r\nparticularly imminent. The global reach of terror\r\nmakes it imperative for us to look carefully at the main\r\nroots of that plague and not be satisfied with merely\r\nfighting its symptoms. A politically secure world\r\ncommunity can be achieved only through a multilateral\r\nworld order based on respect for the rule of\r\ninternational law, human rights and the non-\r\ndiscretionary implementation of the resolutions of\r\nworld legitimacy.\r\nIn that regard, the Middle East region, to which\r\nLebanon belongs, remains a prime example of a region\r\nsuffering from the endemic failure to implement\r\nresolutions of world legitimacy.\r\nThat question leads us directly to the debate\r\nsurrounding the need for and the importance of an\r\nimmediate and radical overhaul of the United Nations.\r\nIn that regard, Lebanon welcomes the creation of a\r\nPeacebuilding Commission, as proposed by the\r\nSecretary-General, and hopes to see the adoption of his\r\nproposals for the Security Council to properly weigh\r\nconsiderations grounded in principle when\r\ncontemplating the use of force.\r\nThe Security Council must be reformed to make\r\nit more inclusive and more representative of the current\r\nmake-up of the United Nations. Needless to say,\r\nLebanon attaches a great deal of importance to this\r\nmatter; that emanates from its great appreciation of the\r\nroles of the United Nations and the Security Council\r\nand from its respect for their resolutions.\r\nI would like to stress here that Lebanon will\r\ncontinue to look to the United Nations and the\r\ninternational community to support our people’s\r\naspirations and our Government’s broad and bold\r\nprogramme of reforms. Their interest in my country\r\nexemplifies the world’s support of freedom in its\r\nbroader sense and gives precedence to the language of\r\nmoderation.\r\nIn Lebanon, in keeping with the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, we have established two\r\ninstitutions: the Fund for Social and Economic\r\nDevelopment and the Project for Domestic\r\nDevelopment. In that regard, in cooperation with the\r\nUnited Nations, in 2003 the Government of Lebanon\r\nreleased its first report on the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals and will publish a follow-up report\r\nin 2007. The report noted great progress in the fight\r\nagainst poverty, the great efforts made in making\r\nprimary education accessible to all, greater gender\r\nequality and a dramatic decrease in infant and maternal\r\nmortality.\r\nLebanon supports the French proposal for the\r\nparticipation of the International Civil Aviation\r\nOrganization in support of developmental programmes\r\nin poor countries. That would surely lead to greater\r\njustice and stability worldwide.\r\nLebanon’s message to the Assembly is that of a\r\nsmall country that has endured wars, occupation and\r\nconspiracies for more than three decades. We stress the\r\nresponsibility of all nations and peoples to safeguard\r\npeace, preserve security and further world justice.\r\nThe will for change derives from respect for\r\nhuman values, no matter how hard the path looks. It is\r\nour collective responsibility to achieve such change. It\r\nis well within our grasp to make the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals a reality.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, President of the\r\nRepublic of the Maldives.\r\nPresident Abdul Gayoom: Let me begin by\r\ncongratulating the Co-Chairpersons on their election to\r\njointly preside over this important summit.\r\nI also commend the Secretary-General for his\r\ninspiring report.\r\nBefore I proceed further, I extend sincere\r\ncondolences to the American people and Government\r\nfollowing the tragic deaths and massive destruction\r\ncaused by Hurricane Katrina. Despite the smallness of\r\nour country and its severe economic difficulties, I am\r\nhappy that we were able to make a modest contribution\r\nto the efforts to alleviate the suffering of the people\r\naffected by the hurricane.\r\nTime, indeed, is precious. Therefore, I shall not\r\nspend the time allotted to me speaking at length. I\r\nwould rather dial 999, for my people are today facing\r\nan unprecedented crisis.\r\nFive years ago, I left this Hall not only sharing\r\nthe euphoria over the Millennium Declaration, but also\r\nwith the confidence that the Maldives could and would\r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals. As our\r\n13\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\n2005 country report would show, the Maldives has\r\nalready achieved the Goals of halving poverty and\r\nachieving universal primary education. We are also on\r\ntrack to achieve the targets of reducing child mortality,\r\nattaining greater gender equality and improving\r\nmaternal health.\r\nBut today I speak with a heavy heart, grieving\r\nover the losses my people have suffered as a result of\r\nthe devastating tsunami of last December. The\r\nMaldives is the only country to have faced a\r\nnationwide disaster from the tsunami. Our economic\r\nasset losses are estimated at a staggering 62 per cent of\r\nour gross domestic product. Tourism, which has been\r\nthe engine of our national economic growth for the past\r\nthree decades, has suffered a sharp decline.\r\nLivelihoods destroyed by the tsunami have not been\r\nrestored. Surging oil prices are draining our foreign\r\nexchange revenues. And, for the first time ever, the\r\nMaldives is in need of significant budgetary support.\r\nClearly, if that alarming trend continues, our\r\nability to catch up with the Millennium Development\r\nGoals will continue to slip. We are indeed grateful to\r\nall those who assisted us in the relief phase following\r\nthe tsunami. Many continue to help us with the\r\nrecovery, and we thank them all. Much as we believe\r\nthat development is our responsibility, our means of\r\nself-reliance are woefully insufficient.\r\nIn forums that have discussed the economic\r\nfuture of the Maldives, we have signalled the critical\r\nimportance of the decade ahead of us. One need only\r\nlook at the demographic challenge facing the country.\r\nOver the past 40 years, the population has tripled.\r\nFurthermore, we have a very young population.\r\nAlthough we have successfully brought the population\r\ngrowth rate down, the task is only half complete. We\r\nnow need to ensure that every working-aged Maldivian\r\nfinds gainful employment. Achieving the target of\r\nenvironmental sustainability is also a formidable\r\nchallenge. The recent environmental tragedies around\r\nthe world show yet again that we all have much to do\r\nto protect our global environment. Indeed, the decade\r\nahead will make or break our vision 2020.\r\nDespite the unprecedented setback caused by the\r\ntsunami, we are resolute in our quest of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. Our view is that, even though a\r\ngoal may become elusive, we should neither change the\r\ntarget nor abandon our vision. Rather, we should speed\r\nup our actions, as we have done in the pursuit of our\r\nnational agenda for democratization, reform, good\r\ngovernance and human rights protection.\r\nBut for our people to enjoy the fruits of greater\r\ndemocracy, we need urgent international economic and\r\nfinancial assistance. At this critical time, a mere\r\nsmooth transition period of graduation from the status\r\nof least developed country would not be adequate. It is\r\nimperative that our country’s graduation be deferred\r\nuntil we return to pre-tsunami levels of development.\r\nIf a country of a mere 300,000 people cannot be\r\nsaved from poverty, despair and ruin, the credibility of\r\nour hopes to save the entire world in 10 years will\r\nindeed be in serious doubt. Small States like the\r\nMaldives happen to be on the front line of most of the\r\ncrises that afflict or threaten the world. From\r\nenvironmental degradation through international\r\nlawlessness to energy crises, it is the small States that\r\nare often the first victims. But the good news is that\r\nwe, the small States, will also be among the first to\r\nknow if the world has really found the will to act. I\r\nhope that, as I conclude my remarks, my urgent call\r\nwill have gone through to 999.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Bingu\r\nWa Mutharika, President of the Republic of Malawi.\r\nPresident Mutharika: I am pleased to be given\r\nthis opportunity to make a contribution on the\r\nstructure, challenges and implementation of and\r\nfollow-up to the Millennium Development Goals. But\r\nbefore doing so, I wish to underscore the fact that the\r\nrationale for the Goals is as valid today as it was some\r\nfive years ago.\r\nLet me start by stating that my country, Malawi,\r\nhas made heroic efforts in meeting the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. Our report, entitled “Malawi and\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals: challenges and\r\nachievements” has been distributed. The report\r\npresents in a graphic form what we had planned to do\r\nin order to achieve the Goals; the challenges we are\r\nfacing; our achievements despite the challenges; and\r\nthe way forward.\r\nAs can be seen from the report, we in Malawi\r\nhave taken the stand that, while the challenges are\r\nindeed enormous and while we need huge resources to\r\nsucceed, we will still forge ahead to achieve whatever\r\nwe can with our limited financial resources and\r\ncapacity. I am pleased to state that we have made a\r\n14\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nsolid start and hope that the United Nations will\r\nrecognize those efforts.\r\nIn our efforts to implement the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals during the past five years, we have\r\nlearned a number of lessons that are essential in\r\nmeeting the targets laid down in the Goals by the year\r\n2015.\r\nThe first lesson is that the MDGs made\r\nassumptions that cannot be validated. For instance, the\r\nGoals were set on the assumption that the goods,\r\nservices, food and income required to meet them were\r\nreadily available and could be produced and sourced in\r\nthe poor African countries, and that what we needed\r\nwas merely to reorganize the distribution structures.\r\nThat is not the case. The reality is that no goods and\r\nservices are available, and hence our countries cannot\r\nmeet the MDGs without first creating new wealth.\r\nAbove all, the United Nations ignored the need to\r\nestablish new production structures in sub-Saharan\r\nAfrica to supply the goods and services needed to meet\r\nthe MDGs. In short, the MDGs were based on a supply\r\nof services that do not exist in the poor countries. That\r\nis the greatest challenge related to the MDGs.\r\nThe second MDG-related assumption is that\r\ninstitutional capacity is available in all of the poor\r\ncountries. The United Nations appears to have\r\nunderestimated the challenges that sub-Saharan\r\nAfrican countries face in putting together a system of\r\ngood governance that would have resulted in kick-\r\nstarting macro-economic growth in the context of a\r\nstable political and economic environment. It also\r\nunderestimated the devastating impact of HIV/AIDS on\r\nthe growth process.\r\nThe third assumption is that the United Nations\r\nunderestimated the flight of capital and the erosion of\r\ngrowth due to external debt servicing. It also assumed\r\nthat there would be a fair and equitable global trading\r\nsystem that would boost the exports of the poor\r\ncountries. In other words, it ignored the reluctance by\r\nindustrialized countries to conclude the Doha round of\r\nmultilateral trade negotiations, which would have\r\ngiven African countries greater access to the global\r\nmarkets for their products.\r\nIn other words, the poor countries cannot benefit\r\nfrom globalization if the industrialized countries are\r\nnot cooperative.\r\nBefore concluding my remarks, let me underscore\r\nthe fact that the Millennium Development Goals\r\npresent a serious challenge to both developing and\r\ndeveloped countries. We will therefore require greater\r\ncooperation among nations than ever before to achieve\r\nthe Goals. We have no choice but to cooperate.\r\nIn conclusion, let me offer Malawi’s deep\r\ncondolences to President George Bush and to the\r\nGovernment and the people of the United States of\r\nAmerica for the heavy loss of life and property due to\r\nHurricane Katrina. Malawi is praying for the people of\r\nthat great nation to overcome that great catastrophe.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency The\r\nHonourable Laisenia Qarase, Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of the Fiji Islands.\r\nMr. Qarase (Fiji): My country offers its\r\ncongratulations to the presidency of the special plenary\r\nand extends its compliments to both Co-Chairpersons\r\nand to the Secretary-General.\r\nMay I, on behalf of the Government and the\r\npeople of the Fiji Islands, extend to the President and\r\nthe people of the United States our sincere sympathy\r\nwith respect to the widespread devastation caused by\r\nHurricane Katrina. Our prayers and condolences go to\r\nthose who lost their loved ones and their homes.\r\nI commend Mr. Kofi Annan for his incisive report\r\ncovering many aspects of United Nations and\r\ninternational affairs, including the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. It contains much that will take us\r\nfurther along the difficult road to development,\r\nfreedom and peace on earth.\r\nFiji congratulates the Secretary-General for the\r\ninitiative he has taken to begin the implementation\r\nplans to reform and strengthen the United Nations in\r\nthe context of its various responsibilities.\r\nWhat is now required, if we are to complete the\r\njourney, is an effort of our collective will. It requires\r\nsacrifices and compromises and a renewed\r\ncommitment of support both to the United Nations and\r\nto one other. If this can be accomplished, we can\r\nachieve the United Nations mission to benefit\r\nhumankind.\r\nLet us ensure then that from here on the United\r\nNations goes forward in a spirit of renewal and reform\r\n15\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nthat generates real hope, purpose and prosperity for the\r\nglobal family.\r\nWe must all help to create a United Nations that\r\nis more efficient and accountable. It must function\r\nalways with integrity and urgent concern for the needs\r\nof the Member States. Above all, we must help the\r\nUnited Nations to concentrate, as never before, on\r\nreducing the shameful gap between developed and\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nFiji reaffirms its commitment to what the United\r\nNations stands for. As always, we are for peace; that is\r\nwhy we have sent so many of our soldiers and police\r\nofficers to serve with United Nations peacekeeping and\r\npeacebuilding forces. Many precious lives have been\r\nlost, but we have accepted that ultimate sacrifice as our\r\ncontribution to the global effort for peace and security.\r\nThere should be no pause in United Nations\r\nendeavours to establish and maintain international\r\npeace, security and stability. This remains the primary\r\nrole of the United Nations, and we support all\r\nmeasures to strengthen it.\r\nFiji acclaims the proposal to create a\r\nPeacebuilding Commission. We will gladly share with\r\nsuch a Commission our own experience of\r\nreconstructing our country following the civil unrest\r\nwhich almost tore the country apart in 2000. With\r\nGod’s help, we quickly restored our economy and\r\nbegan the task of bringing our diverse communities\r\ntogether. The ongoing challenge for our country is to\r\nstrengthen the foundation for unity and harmony.\r\nIn adopting many measures and initiatives to\r\ncreate a culture of peace, we have attached the utmost\r\nimportance to reconciliation and forgiveness. Now we\r\nseek to take this forward by introducing, through\r\nlegislation, the concept of restorative justice.\r\nFiji is fully dedicated to a Security Council\r\nmembership which reflects current geopolitical\r\nrealities. We support the inclusion of India and Japan\r\nto join with the United States and China as permanent\r\nrepresentatives from the Pacific and Asia region.\r\nWe look forward to the moment when peace\r\nfinally reigns in the Middle East, and we commend all\r\nof those countries that are helping to promote that\r\nglobal cause.\r\nWith respect to our Pacific Ocean region, it is our\r\nfervent hope that the Korean people as a whole will\r\nfind lasting harmony. On the future of Taiwan, Fiji\r\nrecognizes that this is a domestic issue and encourages\r\nand supports its resolution through dialogue and\r\nmutual agreement.\r\nThis age of globalization is marked by the\r\nadoption of universal principles governing such\r\nmatters as democracy, human rights and trade and\r\ndevelopment. Today, I reaffirm here that Fiji accepts\r\nthose precepts; there is no question about that. But we\r\nalso say that countries like ours, which is undergoing a\r\nprofound transition, should not be held to unrealistic\r\nstandards. We need time to evolve and to adapt. We\r\nneed time for adherence. Do not judge us by what\r\nmight be inappropriate at our stage of development.\r\nMeasure us by the progress we are making towards the\r\nuniversal ideals and the level of our commitment to\r\nchange.\r\nFiji fully respects the principle of equal human\r\nrights. We endorse the proposal for a Human Rights\r\nCouncil that would be directly accountable to the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nFor our country, it is vitally important, as a factor\r\nfor long-term stability, always to maintain a careful\r\nbalance between the rights of individuals and those of\r\ncommunities. The special interests of the indigenous\r\npeople, including their right of ownership to their\r\nnatural resources, must also be protected. We therefore\r\nstrongly endorse the proposal to bring before the\r\nAssembly a final draft declaration on the rights of\r\nindigenous peoples. It has particular relevance for a\r\nmulticultural country such as ours.\r\nIn accordance with the Millennium Development\r\nGoals, we are pursuing many policies to improve the\r\nquality of life of our citizens. For Fiji and other\r\nvulnerable States, there is one overriding issue that is\r\ncritically vital to our economic survival: market access\r\nand remunerative prices for our exports. What meaning\r\ndo the Millennium Goals have if developing countries\r\ncannot gain access to markets or a fair return on their\r\nexports?\r\nThere must be real recognition of the economic\r\ndisparities and the conditions of inequality that make a\r\nmockery of the very idea of free trade. The removal of\r\nthe certainty of access through the termination of\r\nquotas and reductions in assured commodity prices,\r\nwithout accompanying financial assistance or trade\r\nsupport measures, pose a serious threat to our\r\neconomic growth and sustainability. Unrealistic and\r\n16\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\ninequitable world trade policies simply make it that\r\nmuch harder for our countries to eliminate poverty.\r\nI therefore commend those developed States that\r\nare prepared to support developing nations and assist\r\nthem in cushioning the impact of World Trade\r\nOrganization compliance. I pay particular tribute to the\r\nEuropean Union for its willingness to provide that type\r\nof assistance to its developing partners in Africa, the\r\nCaribbean and the Pacific. We call on our European\r\nUnion (EU) partners to provide adequate long-term\r\nsupport as the EU begins to reduce preferential access\r\nfor sugar from African, Caribbean and Pacific States.\r\nI also express our appreciation to our close\r\nneighbours Australia and New Zealand for their\r\nsupport in helping us gain better access to their\r\nmarkets and their important areas of development\r\nassistance.\r\nThe Millennium Development Goals can be met,\r\nbut only if the United Nations commits itself to trade\r\nreforms that reflect a realistic appreciation of the plight\r\nof all developing countries, including vulnerable island\r\nnations.\r\nMay we find the strength and the conviction to do\r\nwhat is right.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Amadou Hama, Prime Minster of the Republic of\r\nthe Niger.\r\nMr. Hama (Niger) (spoke in French): Allow me\r\nat the outset, on behalf of the Niger and the delegation\r\naccompanying me, to associate myself with the\r\nheartfelt congratulations extended to the Co-\r\nChairpersons, on their election to preside over our\r\nwork. Knowing their personal qualities, I remain\r\nconvinced that under their enlightened leadership the\r\noutcome of our discussions will meet our expectations.\r\nThe people of the Niger, facing an acute food\r\ncrisis following a farming season marked by severe\r\nfood shortages and locust invasions, expresses its full\r\ngratitude to the agencies of the United Nations system\r\nand to the entire international community for the\r\nefforts made to help our country in such difficult\r\ncircumstances.\r\nWe express our complete gratitude to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan, who visited our country to\r\nprovide his support to the people of the Niger. The\r\nsituation, far from being merely the result of present\r\ncircumstances, clearly reveals the extreme fragility of\r\nour system of production and, furthermore, the\r\nprecariousness of the situation and the living\r\nconditions of the people of the Niger. In short, it\r\nexplains my country’s shortcomings in achieving the\r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nIn the light of the Niger’s experience this year,\r\nfive years after our solemn Declaration of 2000, today\r\nit has to be acknowledged with great bitterness that\r\nmany countries, including mine, remain very far from\r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals. For\r\nmany of those countries, the situation has even\r\ndeteriorated greatly. Poverty has worsened, becoming\r\nthe scourge of modern times. The economies of many\r\ndeveloping countries have declined, making them\r\nvictims of the inequality of the international trading\r\nsystem, the steady decline in official development\r\nassistance, their excessive foreign debt burden and low\r\nlevels of investment. Globalization has become one\r\nmore painful ordeal for countries such as the Niger,\r\nwhich, despite its real economic potential, is\r\ncondemned to living in the most abject poverty, and its\r\npeople are condemned to live in despair and all manner\r\nof frustration. In such a situation, how can a country\r\nsuch as mine achieve the Millennium Development\r\nGoals?\r\nIn spite of the structural constraints on the\r\neconomy of the Niger, since 2001 the Government has\r\nbeen firmly committed to achieving the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. It has worked to strengthen its\r\ncooperation with international financial institutions and\r\nhas undertaken to draft and implement our poverty-\r\nreduction strategy and the special programme of the\r\nPresident of the Republic, Mr. Tandja Mamadou.\r\nFollowing the actions taken in that framework,\r\nmeaningful progress has been made in the areas of\r\ndemocracy, basic freedoms, governance, access to\r\nbasic social services and economic reforms.\r\nFurthermore, the results obtained so far demonstrate\r\nthat my country has not been idle and that, despite its\r\nscarce resources and constraints of all kinds, it is\r\nstriving to end the vicious circle of poverty.\r\nIt is normal to expect that well-managed\r\ncountries, those that have carried out good economic\r\nreforms and created conditions that promote\r\ndemocracy and good governance, would show the best\r\neconomic and social performance. Furthermore, in the\r\nopinions of the International Monetary Fund, the World\r\n17\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nBank, the European Union, the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme and many other bilateral and\r\nmultilateral development partners, the Niger is well-\r\nmanaged. Thus, we are faced with a paradox that\r\nthrows up a challenge to both rich and poor countries.\r\nSimply put, freedom, good governance and good\r\nmacroeconomic policies in themselves are not enough\r\nto escape the poverty trap.\r\nI believe we need considerable, ongoing\r\ncontributions of outside resources to finance more\r\nambitious investments in infrastructure and the\r\nproductive sectors, which create jobs for young people.\r\nI would like to speak about additional resources\r\nbeyond the contribution of debt cancellation pledged\r\nby the Group of Eight, which we welcome. Such\r\nadditional resources are increasingly difficult to find,\r\nin a situation where the Bretton Woods institutions,\r\nwhile reducing the debt burden of the Niger, require\r\nour country not to contract new loans for investment\r\nunless 60 per cent of such financing consists of grants.\r\nThat condition is simply unrealistic. It is simply not\r\nfeasible. Really, it is tantamount to making\r\ndevelopment financing for our countries dependent on\r\ngrants.\r\nAre grants in themselves sufficient for the\r\neconomic development of a country? Definitely not.\r\nFor proof, we need only turn to the Millennium Project\r\nreport, in which the financing requirements of a\r\ncountry such as mine in order to attain the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals are estimated at $900 million per\r\nyear. At present, we receive only $120 million in\r\ncombined loans and grants. Worse, the amount of\r\nofficial development assistance we receive is declining\r\nannually. Today it stands at barely half its level of 15\r\nyears ago. The Niger receives just $20 per inhabitant\r\nper year, which equals $1.60 per person per month.\r\nProgress on achieving the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals by the target dates set is a matter\r\nof shared responsibility. The rich countries need to be\r\nconvinced that the fight against poverty is closely\r\nlinked to the burning questions of the moment, in\r\nparticular to the genuine concerns of security and\r\nimmigration.\r\nWhat we need then is a big push — that is,\r\nmassive resources capable of profoundly transforming\r\nthe structure of our economies in order to create a\r\nproductive, diversified base that could better integrate\r\nour countries into international trade and provide work\r\nfor unemployed young people who, in the years to\r\ncome, if nothing is done as of now, will explode like a\r\nbomb and wreak havoc in the world.\r\nConsequently, the many pledges made here by the\r\nrich countries must be delivered upon very quickly if\r\nwe want to genuinely achieve the MDGs and ensure\r\nsocial peace in our countries. For our part, shouldering\r\nour responsibility will mean working to strengthen\r\ndemocracy and good governance, peacebuilding and\r\nfighting against blind violence and terrorism.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by Her Excellency\r\nMrs. Lineth Saborío, Vice-President of the Republic of\r\nCosta Rica.\r\nMrs. Saborío (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nToday, on the sixtieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations, I am honoured to reaffirm Costa Rica’s\r\nunconditional commitment to the principles and\r\npurposes of this Organization. We reaffirm our faith in\r\nthe United Nations as the international community’s\r\nmain instrument to maintain peace.\r\nWe reiterate our full confidence in this\r\nOrganization’s capacity to fight for human rights and\r\nthe well-being of all peoples. We renew our\r\ncommitment to universal disarmament and to the\r\nefforts to promote sustainable development. For these\r\nreasons, we deem it indispensable for the United\r\nNations to play a leading role in the creation of a better\r\nworld.\r\nIn the area of international peace and security, we\r\naffirm our full confidence in the Security Council as\r\nthe legitimate mechanism to confront the main threats\r\nto peaceful relations among nations. We reaffirm our\r\ncommitment to Security Council reform with a view to\r\nmaking it more democratic, transparent and effective\r\non the basis of the principles of sovereign equality\r\namong all States, rotation, periodic elections and\r\naccountability. We favour an increase in the number of\r\nnon-permanent members of the Security Council with\r\nthe right to be re-elected, and we support a deep reform\r\nof its working methods. In order to increase the\r\nCouncil’s legitimacy and efficiency, we have advocated\r\nfor the elimination of the right of veto in matters such\r\nas genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and\r\nmassive violations of human rights. Regrettably, that\r\ninitiative was not reflected in this summit’s draft\r\noutcome document (A/60/L.1). We believe that the\r\n18\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nquestion of limiting the right of veto should be\r\nreconsidered in the coming months.\r\nCosta Rica firmly supports all efforts to\r\nstrengthen the international human rights mechanisms.\r\nWe endorse fully the idea of transforming the\r\nCommission on Human Rights into a Human Rights\r\nCouncil and would have liked the outcome document\r\nto contain concrete provisions on the mandate and\r\nstructure of the new Human Rights Council. In their\r\nabsence, we must devote the coming months to\r\ndesigning that new institution. Furthermore, we\r\nendorse the idea of increasing substantially the budget\r\nof the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights, and we welcome the\r\ninitiatives to strengthen the monitoring mechanisms\r\nestablished by treaties with a view to creating, in due\r\ntime, a unified system. In order to protect persons\r\nliving with disabilities, we believe that it is necessary\r\nto conclude as soon as possible the convention on the\r\nrights of persons with disabilities.\r\nWe stress the importance of law and justice in\r\ninternational relations, and we reaffirm our faith in the\r\nInternational Court of Justice as the best mechanism\r\nfor the peaceful settlement of disputes. We should like,\r\ntherefore, to urge all nations to accept, without\r\nconditions, the jurisdiction of the Court. Similarly, we\r\nreaffirm our support for the work of the International\r\nCriminal Court as an indispensable instrument to\r\nprevent and punish crimes committed against\r\nhumanity.\r\nWe regret that the draft outcome document does\r\nnot mention either the International Criminal Court or\r\nthe need to prevent impunity at the global level. We\r\nalso regret the fact that the outcome document does not\r\nreaffirm commitments already made regarding\r\ndisarmament, non-proliferation and small arms.\r\nWe are convinced that the United Nations must\r\ntake the leading role in the fight against international\r\nterrorism. Therefore, we should like to reiterate the\r\nproposal made last year by His Excellency Mr. Abel\r\nPacheco de la Espriella, President of Costa Rica, to\r\ncreate a High Commissioner against Terrorism, as an\r\nindependent, professional and permanent body, located\r\nwithin the Secretariat, with a view to ensuring greater\r\ncoordination and better use of the resources available\r\nat the global level for the fight against terrorism.\r\nFurthermore, we support the rapid conclusion of the\r\nComprehensive Convention against International\r\nTerrorism by the end of this year.\r\nRegarding development, I wish to reiterate our\r\ncall to fulfil the Millennium Goals. In particular, we\r\nurge the developed nations to honour their commitment\r\nto devote 0.7 per cent of their gross national product to\r\ndevelopment assistance and to eliminate all barriers\r\nand subsidies that have a negative impact on the\r\nexports of developing countries.\r\nSimilarly, it is essential for us to always keep in\r\nmind the importance of ecologically sustainable\r\ndevelopment and, in particular, the need to protect our\r\nnatural resources. In this context, I should like to\r\nhighlight the initiative led by Costa Rica and Papua\r\nNew Guinea of creating a “Rainforest Coalition” to\r\nprotect all forests and ensure payment for the\r\nenvironmental services that they provide us.\r\nRegarding management, and with a view to\r\nensuring the unique legitimacy of this Organization, we\r\nconsider it indispensable to strengthen the\r\nOrganization’s monitoring and oversight mechanisms,\r\nand we request the General Assembly to consider in\r\ndepth the recommendations of the Volcker report. We\r\nbelieve it is necessary to face up with absolute\r\ntransparency to the mismanagement cases and the\r\nallegations of corruption that have surfaced within the\r\nOrganization in recent months.\r\nToday we have been called upon to reaffirm our\r\nfaith in this Organization and in its capacity to create\r\nthe necessary conditions for human development, such\r\nas universal access to health services, education, social\r\nsecurity, housing, safe water and job training. These\r\ntopics must have the same priority in our\r\nOrganization’s agenda as the challenges of ensuring\r\nlasting peace and of eradicating terrorism.\r\nAt this point in the history of humankind, it is\r\nabsolutely necessary to create the conditions for an\r\ninclusive, just and equitable global society. Such are\r\nthe real prerequisites for attaining peace and security.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): I call now on\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Rashid Meredov, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Turkmenistan.\r\nMr. Meredov (Turkmenistan) (spoke in Russian):\r\nFirst of all, I should like to express sincere gratitude\r\nfor the honour of addressing you from this rostrum and\r\nto convey, on behalf of the President of Turkmenistan,\r\n19\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nSaparmurat Ataevich Niyazov, best wishes for peace\r\nand prosperity to the peoples of all nations.\r\nThis session has special value for Turkmenistan,\r\nwhich this year is celebrating the tenth anniversary of\r\nthe adoption by the General Assembly of its resolution\r\n50/80 A, on the permanent neutrality of Turkmenistan.\r\nPresident Niyazov had proposed that initiative at the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations.\r\nTurkmenistan values its universally recognized\r\ninternational legal status of permanent neutrality and\r\ndemonstrates with practical actions its commitment to\r\nits international obligations in this regard and to the\r\nhigh ideals of the community of nations.\r\nAs the major international organization, and by\r\nvirtue of its universality and vast political experience,\r\nthe United Nations occupies a unique place in the\r\nsystem of international relations. It plays a major role\r\nin solving the most urgent problems of modern times.\r\nThe fundamental provisions of the United\r\nNations Charter have now been further developed in\r\nthe Millennium Declaration, which is based on the\r\nprinciples of sustainable development, strengthening\r\npeace and collective security, promotion of human\r\nrights and the rule of law. It is these principles that\r\nconstitute a basis of our interaction for the future.\r\nOne of the Organization’s main tasks is\r\npreventing threats to the world community. This in turn\r\nrequires establishing a system of preventive measures\r\nand defining the legal tools and mechanisms for\r\nimplementing them. Fully aware of the value of\r\npreventive action, Turkmenistan is engaged in practical\r\napproaches to promoting such action. In particular,\r\nTurkmenistan was the venue for the first round of the\r\nForum on Conflict Prevention and Sustainable\r\nDevelopment for Central Asia, which took place under\r\nUnited Nations auspices. We consider this to be an\r\nimportant process necessary for enhancing\r\nunderstanding and cooperation among States.\r\nIn our view, the attention that the United Nations\r\ndevotes to issues of strengthening security and\r\npreventive activities in Central Asia is timely and\r\nnecessary. In this connection, the idea of establishing\r\nthe Regional Centre for Preventive Diplomacy for\r\nCentral Asia, with its headquarters in our capital,\r\nAshgabat, is a significant international initiative. We\r\nare grateful to the Secretary-General for his intention\r\nto create the Centre, as set out in his annual report on\r\nthe work of the Organization (A/60/1, para. 32). We are\r\nalso grateful for the support of so many States for this\r\nimportant international initiative. The creation and\r\nfunctioning of the Regional Centre will promote\r\ncomprehensive understanding and resolution of\r\nquestions related to the prevention of conflict\r\nsituations, combating terrorism and illegal drug\r\ntrafficking and promoting sustainable development in\r\nCentral Asia.\r\nA key activity of the international community is\r\nthe fight against terrorism and transnational organized\r\ncrime. In this context, Turkmenistan, having supported\r\nthe United Nations initiative to create an international\r\ncoalition against terrorism, has become an active\r\nparticipant in it. Not only do we resolutely condemn\r\nacts of terrorism worldwide; we are also implementing\r\nspecific legislative and practical measures to fight this\r\nscourge and prevent its spread.\r\nTurkmenistan supports effective implementation\r\nof a comprehensive system of counter-terrorism\r\nmeasures, including active cooperation from States in\r\nfinding and bringing to justice those who plan and\r\nperpetrate acts of terrorism. In this connection, we\r\nconsider it timely and necessary that a comprehensive\r\nconvention on international terrorism be completed and\r\nadopted.\r\nThe non-proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction is a pressing issue being considered at the\r\npresent High-level Plenary Meeting. As a party to the\r\nmain international non-proliferation instruments, our\r\ncountry — whose neutral status involves such\r\nimportant obligations such as not to produce, deploy or\r\nproliferate weapons of mass destruction — fully\r\nsupports the efforts of the international community in\r\nthis area and participates in their implementation. One\r\npractical step is Turkmenistan’s active participation\r\nunder United Nations auspices in the process aimed at\r\nestablishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia.\r\nOne of the primary tasks facing the world\r\ncommunity is fighting and preventing disease. In this\r\narea, Turkmenistan is closely cooperating with the\r\nUnited Nations and other international organizations in\r\nimplementing its national health programme. As a\r\nresult of such interaction, we have put in place a\r\nnumber of joint projects and programmes whose\r\neffectiveness has been recognized at the international level.\r\nAnother important theme of this Meeting is\r\nensuring ecological sustainability. The solution of\r\nthese tasks in Turkmenistan is addressing this issue\r\n20\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nboth nationally and through the implementation of\r\ninternational environmental programmes. Our close\r\npartnership with the United Nations Environment\r\nProgramme, the Caspian Ecological Programme, the\r\nAral Sea Rescue Fund and a number of other\r\ninternational environmental initiatives shows how\r\nregional and global environmental protection issues\r\ncan be tackled.\r\nThe human dimension has a special place in the\r\nMillennium Declaration. Here, Turkmenistan\r\nconsistently undertakes efforts to create and develop\r\ngenuine guarantees to ensure the rights of citizens. Our\r\ncountry is carrying out such activities together with\r\ninternational organizations, primarily United Nations\r\nhumanitarian agencies. As a result of this kind of\r\nconstructive partnership, we have established a\r\ndialogue with the Commission on Human Rights and\r\nare actively interacting with the Office of the High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights; this has produced\r\npractical results. Specifically, just over a month ago,\r\nmore than 16,000 refugees living in Turkmenistan were\r\ngranted Turkmenistan citizenship or residence permits\r\nby decree of the President of Turkmenistan.\r\nWe shall continue our efforts on all these issues\r\nand stand ready to cooperate with all States and\r\ninternational organizations.\r\nWe share the widely held view that today the\r\nUnited Nations requires effective reform, but only if\r\nsuch reform strengthens the Organization and broadens\r\nits role in the world. We believe that one key area is\r\nstrengthening the role of the General Assembly as the\r\nprimary consultative and representative body of the\r\nUnited Nations. This, in turn, calls for improving the\r\nmodel for General Assembly activities, so that it\r\nreflects modern-day problems facing the world\r\ncommunity.\r\nA prominent aspect of reforming of the United\r\nNations is improving the work and the structure of the\r\nSecurity Council. Given the significance of that body,\r\nwe believe that the optimal composition must be\r\nadopted on the basis of broad agreement.\r\nThe initiative to create the Peacebuilding\r\nCommission and proposals to specifically define its\r\nactivities as a United Nations institution along the lines\r\nof the Economic and Social Council are timely and\r\nsignificant.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to note that only by\r\npooling our common efforts and being aware of the\r\nrole and responsibility of every country will we ensure\r\nsuccessful implementation of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals and resolve the diverse tasks\r\nfacing Member States.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): I now give the floor to His Excellency\r\nMr. S. Jayakumar, Deputy Prime Minister of\r\nSingapore.\r\nMr. Jayakumar (Singapore): This is not the best\r\nof times for the United Nations. The Organization is\r\nunder attack — and from many directions. However,\r\ntension between the interests of nations and the idea of\r\nthe international community is inherent in the very\r\nnature of the State system. Seldom in the 60 years of\r\nits existence has the United Nations been entirely free\r\nof crisis and controversy. Debate over the role of the\r\nUnited Nations and its future is a sign of its continued\r\nengagement with the issues of our day.\r\nWe may complain about the United Nations, yet\r\nwe instinctively turn to it as we seek to organize life in\r\nan ever more interdependent world, confronted with\r\nsuch urgent new challenges as terrorism, the\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, pandemic\r\ndiseases and tsunamis. By and large, those\r\ncontroversies are over the extent to which and how best\r\nthe United Nations should be involved. But that the\r\nUnited Nations should be involved is taken for granted.\r\nThe real problem is perhaps not that the United\r\nNations is ignored, but that all too often we demand\r\ntoo much of the United Nations. The continuing\r\nvalidity of Charter principles does not absolve its\r\nMembers of national responsibilities in an international\r\nsystem in which the State is still the central actor and\r\nState interests are the essential motor of international\r\nrelations. The United Nations is only one diplomatic\r\ninstrument in a repertoire.\r\nAt the same time, it is a fact that only the United\r\nNations has a global mandate and near universal\r\nlegitimacy. It is the only Organization equipped to\r\nfacilitate cooperation between sovereign nation-States.\r\nTherein lies the crux of the issue. The United Nations\r\nCharter principles are vitally valid, but the Charter is\r\nnot a sacred text because principles need to be\r\noperationalized to be relevant. United Nations reform\r\nis not something that should seize us only on\r\nanniversaries. It would be a mistake to consider the\r\n21\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nsixtieth or indeed any other anniversary as a make-or-\r\nbreak occasion. Change and adaptation must be a\r\ncontinual part of the evolution of every living entity.\r\nThe key purpose of this year’s gathering is to\r\nreview the progress made since the Millennium\r\nSummit five years ago. Improving the lives of our\r\npeoples is the criterion by which history will judge us.\r\nIt is from that perspective that I will offer my\r\ndelegation’s comments on three core areas contained in\r\nthe outcome document: management, human rights and\r\npeacebuilding.\r\nManagement reforms directly pit the interests of\r\nMembers against those of the Organization as a whole.\r\nThey are difficult, but they cannot be avoided, as they\r\nare vital to restoring public confidence and support.\r\nThe demands on the United Nations are always\r\ngrowing, but resources are finite. More effective use of\r\navailable resources is therefore imperative if\r\ndevelopment and other goals are to be achieved.\r\nThe draft outcome document has set out a\r\ncomprehensive set of proposals, and in that regard the\r\nproposals for an independent oversight advisory\r\ncommittee to assist the General Assembly and for an\r\nevaluation of the United Nations entire internal control\r\nand oversight system acquire special urgency under\r\ncurrent circumstances.\r\nOn human rights, empowering our peoples with\r\neconomic, social as well as political and civil rights\r\nmust be both the end and the means of development.\r\nMy delegation has an open mind on the proposal to\r\ntransform the Commission on Human Rights into a\r\nhuman rights council, but the question is: Are the\r\nessential problems only structural? It is a fact that all\r\nbut a handful of what are asserted to be rights are\r\nessentially contested concepts. The basic function of\r\nthe United Nations is to enforce agreed norms as well\r\nas to expand the consensus on what constitutes agreed\r\nnorms. But the penchant of some States to present their\r\nviews as universal norms inevitably provokes\r\nresistance, unnecessarily politicizes the process and is\r\nultimately unhelpful to the cause of human rights.\r\nUnless that deeper issue is adequately addressed, any\r\nchange will be only superficial.\r\nOn peacebuilding, stability and the ability to\r\ngovern are fundamental prerequisites for development.\r\nBitter experience has shown us that instability in one\r\nState can have a powerful contagion effect far beyond\r\nits borders. The manner in which internal\r\ndevelopments in one State have wider ramifications is\r\nonly one illustration of how narrow notions of\r\nsovereignty no longer hold today. We believe that the\r\nproposal to create a peacebuilding commission is\r\nworthy of support, but given the complexities and\r\nsensitivities inherent in its proposed functions, we must\r\nbe flexible in our approach and envisage changes in\r\nstructure and functions over time and in different\r\ncircumstances. In so doing, we must acknowledge that\r\nthe concept of absolute sovereignty will not always be\r\na viable operating principle. For that reason,\r\nestablishing a peacebuilding commission will be a\r\ncontentious enterprise, but that should not deter us\r\nfrom pursuing a worthy goal.\r\nIn the run-up to this sixtieth anniversary summit,\r\nexpansion of the Security Council has dominated\r\ndiscussions on United Nations reform. That is to be\r\nexpected, as the Security Council lies at the heart of\r\nthe United Nations system. Because of the huge stakes,\r\nnational positions have become sharply polarized.\r\nSingapore continues to believe that there should be an\r\nexpansion of the Security Council to better reflect\r\ncontemporary geopolitical realities. However, our view\r\nis that the new permanent members should not have the\r\nveto, because that would make it even more difficult\r\nfor the Security Council to be an effective instrument\r\nof world peace.\r\nLet us continue to explore compromises on the\r\nreform of the Security Council and other issues that are\r\nbefore us. We should not, because of our inability to\r\nmake progress on any one particular issue, lose interest\r\nin the other issues that are no less important. Where\r\nthere is consensus, let us take big strides. Where the\r\nissues are still contentious, let us be prepared to take\r\nsmaller steps.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): I now give the\r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Ahmed Aboul Gheit,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Egypt.\r\nMr. Aboul Gheit (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): It\r\ngives me pleasure to deliver the statement of Mr. Hosni\r\nMubarak, President of the Arab Republic of Egypt, to\r\nthe High-level Plenary Meeting of the General\r\nAssembly on the occasion of its sixtieth anniversary.\r\nIn September 2000, we identified our common\r\nvision for the future of the United Nations and\r\ncommitted ourselves to undertaking certain\r\nresponsibilities towards our peoples, our societies and\r\nthe international community at large. We also\r\n22\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\ncommitted to shouldering our responsibility towards\r\nour Organization, which we established 60 years ago as\r\na forum to uphold the principles of human dignity,\r\nequality and justice and to maintain international peace\r\nand security.\r\nToday, and while the world has witnessed\r\nsignificant events over the past five years, we gather\r\nonce again in New York to consider which of those\r\nbasic commitments we have managed to fulfil and to\r\nagree on the way forward towards achieving the other\r\nobjectives that we have failed to fulfil. We should carry\r\nout our examination of the future with a common\r\nunderstanding of the nature of the threats and\r\nchallenges we are facing, and on the basis of our\r\nconviction in the uniformity of our purposes and\r\nprinciples enshrined in the United Nations Charter,\r\nwhich has been and will remain the solid foundation\r\nupon which we will stand and confront the threats and\r\nchallenges facing the international community.\r\nBefore we address our ambitious plans to reform\r\nour Organization, we must first agree on a number of\r\npremises and basics to secure our path towards the\r\nrealization of our common objectives.\r\nFirst, what brings us together must not be the\r\nurge to impose our personal will, lifestyle and values.\r\nWe must come together around the desire for mutual\r\nunderstanding and joint endeavour to identify and\r\naddress the common risks facing humanity.\r\nSecondly, we should view efforts to achieve\r\neconomic development as a human commitment to\r\nwhich we must all subscribe, not as a means of\r\nexerting pressure to achieve non-development\r\nobjectives.\r\nThirdly, any successful effort to achieve\r\ncomprehensive development will remain hostage to our\r\nability to achieve peace and stability and to consolidate\r\nthe principles of international legitimacy, justice and\r\nequality. We must reject the concept of the use of force\r\nand forced occupation of the lands of others. We must\r\nresolve international conflicts through peaceful means,\r\nin accordance with the principles of international law\r\nand legitimacy.\r\nIn 2000, we made a commitment to promote\r\ndemocracy, the rule of law and respect for human\r\nrights and fundamental freedoms, including the right to\r\ndevelopment. Egypt has taken significant steps in that\r\ndirection on the basis of plurality and increased\r\nparticipation in the decision-making process — efforts\r\nthat culminated in the holding of open presidential\r\nelections a few days ago, in which the candidates from\r\n10 political parties competed, for the first time in\r\nEgypt’s history, to win the confidence of the people.\r\nWe continue to support the structural reform of\r\nthe human rights machinery and the establishment of\r\nthe Human Rights Council. We stress that such reform\r\nshould be substantive and not merely a change of\r\nnames. We should also avoid politicizing such\r\nprocesses and engaging in double standards. We should\r\nreach common understandings that take into account\r\ncultural, educational and social diversity. And we\r\nshould avoid using the proposed Human Rights\r\nCouncil to achieve political ends.\r\nEgypt has also consistently called for the reform\r\nof the Security Council with view to adapting it to the\r\nneeds of our changing world.\r\nIf the reform effort is to achieve its objectives,\r\nEgypt believes that it should be based on a number of\r\nprinciples, which I will briefly outline. First, we must\r\nrestore the former balance between the main organs of\r\nthe United Nations and return to the General Assembly\r\nits central role as the main legislative body, as\r\nenshrined in the Charter.\r\nSecondly, we must reform the working methods\r\nof the Security Council to make it more transparent and\r\ncredible. We should also increase the membership of\r\nthe Council to make it more representative of the\r\ndeveloping countries, particularly the African\r\ncountries, which have not yet received their fair share\r\nof representation in the Council.\r\nThirdly, we must allow the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil to play a greater role in drawing up\r\ninternational policies in the economic and social areas\r\nand following up on their implementation. This would\r\ncomplement international efforts in the development\r\nprocess and help developing countries to achieve the\r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs).\r\nFourthly, we believe that the Peacebuilding\r\nCommission will prove to be an efficient tool for\r\nbuilding the national capacities of countries emerging\r\nfrom armed conflict and for assisting those countries\r\non the path towards stability and reconstruction,\r\nwithout imposing trusteeship on them or undermining\r\ntheir national sovereignty.\r\n23\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nAll international efforts, including institutional\r\nreform within our Organization, must take place in\r\nparallel with efforts to combat terrorism. Egypt calls\r\nonce again for a collective international effort, through\r\nthe General Assembly, to deal with that scourge,\r\nwhich, if unchecked, will undermine all attempts by\r\nthe international community to enhance international\r\npeace and security and to achieve development. The\r\ninternational community has yet to come up with a\r\nstrategy in this regard, although it is crystal clear that\r\nno State, however powerful, can deal with the\r\nphenomenon alone.\r\nWe hope that our agreement, as reflected in the\r\nsummit outcome document, will represent a new\r\nbeginning for our common endeavours. We must\r\nensure the implementation of that agreement so as to\r\nfulfil the common aspirations of our peoples for a\r\nbetter and more prosperous future through a new order\r\nbased on cooperation, complementarity and\r\ninternational democracy — one that guarantees their\r\nrights and requires them to fulfil their obligations.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): I call next on\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Nyan Win, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Myanmar.\r\nMr. Win (Myanmar): I should like at the outset to\r\nconvey the deepest sympathy of my delegation to those\r\naffected by Hurricane Katrina on the Gulf coast of the\r\nUnited States of America.\r\nI should like, at this largest-ever assembly of\r\nworld leaders, to congratulate Mr. Eliasson on his\r\nelection to his high office.\r\nIn the Millennium Declaration, world leaders\r\npledged that the world in 2015 would be better than the\r\none that we lived in at that time. They made solemn\r\ncommitments to implement the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), which aim to guarantee\r\npeace and security through disarmament; alleviate\r\npoverty through development; and protect the\r\nenvironment and promote human rights, democracy\r\nand good governance through the establishment of\r\nagreed international norms. Progress in achieving the\r\nMDGs is far from what was originally envisaged. We\r\nshould not despair, however, but must continue to\r\nendeavour to meet the agreed targets.\r\nIn the view of my country, priority areas include\r\ncombating the scourge of terrorism and transnational\r\ncrime; enhancing cooperation in meeting the\r\nchallenges of the proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction and those of nuclear disarmament; ensuring\r\nthat development is sustainable and that the\r\nenvironment is protected; intensifying the international\r\ncommunity’s efforts to prevent, mitigate the effects of\r\nand eradicate communicable diseases, including the\r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic and avian flu.\r\nIn Myanmar, we are making satisfactory progress\r\ntowards reaching the Millennium Development Goals\r\nby 2015. In our drive to eradicate poverty, we have\r\nachieved significant results through the designation of\r\n24 special development zones in the states and\r\ndivisions, with a view to achieving equitable and\r\nbalanced development throughout the country.\r\nIn the area of ensuring education for all,\r\naccording to our estimates, by 2015, net enrolment in\r\nprimary level education will be 84.5 per cent. In the\r\nhealth sector, we have designated HIV/AIDS, malaria\r\nand tuberculosis as diseases of national concern. We\r\nare also actively participating in the international\r\ncommunity’s efforts to combat the scourge of\r\nHIV/AIDS through our membership in the\r\nCoordination Board of the Joint United Nations\r\nProgramme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS).\r\nMyanmar is endeavouring to achieve\r\ndevelopment, relying mainly on its own resources,\r\nwithout assistance, including from the international\r\nfinancial institutions. With external financial\r\nassistance, our development efforts could be\r\naccelerated.\r\nIf the world is to achieve economic development\r\nand social progress in a secure environment, then\r\nconsolidated international efforts are urgently needed\r\nto solve global economic issues through\r\nimplementation of the goals set out in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, by both developed and developing\r\ncountries. The United Nations, as the only\r\nOrganization with global reach and a global mandate,\r\nis the best entity to assist Member countries in those\r\ncritical tasks. The United Nations must therefore be\r\nreformed so as to increase its efficiency and\r\neffectiveness and to strengthen its capacity to meet and\r\novercome the threats and challenges of the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nThe United Nations must be reformed, and its\r\nsacrosanct principles of national sovereignty, territorial\r\nintegrity, equality, non-interference in internal affairs,\r\nsettlement of disputes by peaceful means, and the non-\r\n24\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nuse or threat of use of force should remain inviolate.\r\nThose guiding principles have withstood the test of\r\ntime and are as relevant and valid today as on the day\r\nthey were adopted.\r\nWe are confident that the Assembly will reaffirm\r\nthe cardinal principles upheld and consolidated by the\r\nUnited Nations as the world body representing all\r\nnations on the basis of equality, solidarity, tolerance,\r\ncooperation and multilateralism.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): I give the floor\r\nto His Highness Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al\r\nNahyan, Minister of Information and Culture, Personal\r\nRepresentative of the President of the United Arab\r\nEmirates.\r\nSheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan (United\r\nArab Emirates) (spoke in Arabic): Let me say at the\r\noutset that it gives me great pleasure to convey to the\r\nAssembly the congratulations of His Highness Sheikh\r\nKhalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the United\r\nArab Emirates, on the election of Mr. Eliasson, the\r\nrepresentative of a friendly country, as President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixtieth session. I should like\r\nalso to express our appreciation to the President of the\r\nGabonese Republic for the efforts made by his country\r\nin guiding the work of the previous session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates expresses its\r\nappreciation for the efforts made by Mr. Kofi Annan,\r\nthe Secretary-General, to strengthen and promote the\r\nrole of the United Nations.\r\nOn this occasion, I should like also to convey, on\r\nbehalf of the Government and the people of the United\r\nArab Emirates, our heartfelt condolences and sympathy\r\nto the Government and the people of the United States\r\nof America and to the families of the victims of\r\nHurricane Katrina for the tragic loss of life and\r\nproperty caused by the hurricane.\r\nWe consider this meeting a valuable opportunity\r\nto take stock of the progress made in the\r\nimplementation of the Development Goals which we\r\npledged in the Millennium Declaration, which\r\nrepresents a road map for international efforts to\r\nachieve prosperity and dignity for our peoples\r\naccording to the principles of equality, justice and\r\nfairness. This meeting also provides an opportunity to\r\ndevelop a collective vision as to how to effectively\r\naddress present challenges and the resulting new\r\ndimensions of collective security.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates reaffirms the central\r\nrole of the United Nations and stresses the importance\r\nof its Charter — the main point of reference for\r\nbuilding international relations on the basis of respect,\r\nfreedom, equality, tolerance and joint responsibility. In\r\nthat context, the United Arab Emirates would like to\r\nre-emphasize the importance of strengthening the\r\nUnited Nations and the reform of its principal organs to\r\nenable it to meet its growing responsibilities and to\r\nstrengthen its role.\r\nThe benefits of the progress made in the\r\neconomic, social and humanitarian fields have reached\r\nonly a very small number of peoples. Indeed, a large\r\npercentage of the world’s population continues to\r\nsuffer from poverty, hunger, serious diseases,\r\nunemployment, illiteracy and displacement. They\r\nsuffer also from the negative effects of armed conflict\r\nand foreign occupation, in addition to the proliferation\r\nof weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear\r\nweapons, transnational organized crime, drug\r\ntrafficking, terrorism, and human rights violations, all\r\nof which pose grave threats to international peace and\r\nsecurity, and impede sustainable development, which\r\nwe are striving to realize.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates is firmly convinced\r\nthat development is the most important issue of our\r\ntime, since it represents the way to the elimination of\r\npoverty, hunger, and the achievement of security and\r\nstability for peoples. From that perspective, we\r\nemphasize the importance of addressing international\r\nchallenges in the context of a clear vision of collective\r\nsecurity based on the view that development and the\r\nwelfare of the people are main concerns — a vision\r\nthat can be translated into a global partnership that\r\nensures the commitment of developed and developing\r\ncountries to take practical and concrete steps to\r\nexpedite the implementation of the recommendations\r\nof all United Nations summits and conferences.\r\nProceeding from that conviction, we believe also\r\nthat the international efforts towards development will\r\nnot bear fruit in the absence of international peace and\r\nsecurity, the achievement of justice and equity for all\r\npeoples, the respect of cultural diversity and the right\r\nof people to self-determination; and the end of foreign\r\noccupation wherever it exists, including the occupation\r\nsince 1961 by Iran of the three islands which belong to\r\n25\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nthe United Arab Emirates — Greater Tunb, Lesser\r\nTunb and Abu Musa.\r\nThere should be a comprehensive and just\r\nsettlement of the Middle East issue and the Palestinian\r\nquestion. We must strengthen international efforts to\r\ncombat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations\r\nand to prevent the proliferation and production of\r\nweapons of mass destruction, especially nuclear\r\nweapons.\r\nIn conclusion, we renew our commitment to the\r\nspirit and objectives of the Millennium Declaration,\r\nand we hope that this meeting will succeed in reaching\r\na common vision as concerns ways to eliminate the\r\nobstacles impeding the full implementation of the\r\nDevelopment Goals and will enables us to translate our\r\nundertakings and commitments into a tangible reality.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): I give the floor\r\nto His Highness Sayyid Haitham Bin Tariq Al-Said,\r\nMinister of National Heritage and Culture, Special\r\nEnvoy of His Majesty the Sultan of Oman.\r\nSayyid Haitham Bin Tang Al-Said (Oman)\r\n(spoke in Arabic): I have the honour to convey to the\r\nAssembly greetings from His Majesty Sultan Qaboos\r\nBin Said, Sultan of Oman, and his best wishes for\r\nsuccess in its endeavours to achieve the desired goals\r\nand objectives.\r\nI sincerely hope that this high-level summit will\r\nbe able to agree on implementable and practical\r\ncollective recommendations on the financing of\r\ndevelopment and on the implementation of the\r\nprogrammes and strategies approved by United Nations\r\nconferences with a view to achieving the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs).\r\nThis summit has particular importance as it\r\nrepresents a historic opportunity to consider a number\r\nof questions that are key to continued international\r\ncooperation, in particular to the realization of the\r\nMDGs. There is no doubt that the achievement of\r\ncomprehensive and sustainable development has been,\r\nand still is, the primary goal of all major meetings of\r\nworld leaders.\r\nWe share the vision of the Secretary-General,\r\nwho believes that there can be no security without\r\ndevelopment, and no development without security.\r\nDevelopment and security are complementary, hence\r\nthe importance of this summit, which rests on four\r\nprincipal pillars determined by the Millennium\r\nSummit. Those pillars are economic development;\r\nsocial development; conservation of natural resources;\r\nand protection of the environment.\r\nOf course, these main themes overlap with other,\r\nno less important issues such as those of awareness-\r\nraising, education, institution-building and the\r\nintegration of women and youth, in addition to training\r\nand information.\r\nAlthough my Government agrees with the\r\nrecommendations made by the Secretary-General on\r\nsustainable development, we would like to note here\r\nthe importance of giving developing countries greater\r\nfreedom to promote their development programmes\r\naccording to their national priorities and the particular\r\ncircumstances of each country, and in consonance with\r\ninternational development strategies. Because my\r\ncountry’s Government wishes to make people the focus\r\nand purpose of development, it has placed the\r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) at the\r\nforefront of its national policies, and is doing its best to\r\nconnect the social and economic dimensions of the\r\nGoals through the use of monitoring indicators, which\r\nhave shown that the Sultanate has already gone a long\r\nway towards attaining them and that, with God’s help,\r\nit will manage to achieve the Millennium Development\r\nGoals on schedule.\r\nAt the international level, my country has been\r\nfollowing with concern the situations of many peoples\r\nin many regions of the world, who have been working\r\nvery hard to achieve a level of development that would\r\nenable them to overcome epidemics, poverty and the\r\nconsequences of natural disasters. We believe that\r\nhumanitarian responsibility dictates that developed\r\ncountries should give others the opportunity to share in\r\nthe fruits of the global economy. They should do that\r\nby reviewing their policies in order to cancel debts and\r\noffer all types of economic support, including\r\npermission for poor and developing countries to\r\nmanufacture medicine and provide it at affordable\r\nprices to people suffering from AIDS, malaria and\r\ntuberculosis.\r\nIn view of this, we believe that it is time for the\r\ninternational community to adopt concrete, practical\r\nsteps to enable those countries and regions, especially\r\nin the African continent, to benefit from the\r\nopportunities of globalization in a true world\r\npartnership. That can never be achieved through\r\npromises, but through a clear implementable\r\n26\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\ninternational strategy based on debt cancellation,\r\nprovision of development aid and unrestricted access to\r\nworld markets for the exports of developing and least\r\ndeveloped countries.\r\nAs for the situation in the Middle East, the latest\r\ndevelopments relating to the Palestinian question,\r\nincluding the withdrawal of Israel from the Gaza Strip,\r\nrepresent a first step in the right direction towards the\r\napplication of resolutions establishing international\r\nlegitimacy. We hope that Israel, in cooperation with the\r\nPalestinian Authority and neighbouring countries, will\r\ntake similar steps towards withdrawal from all\r\noccupied Arab territories and the establishment of a\r\nfully sovereign Palestinian State.\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General’s contention\r\nthat the absence of a comprehensive international\r\nagreement to combat terrorism, based on a clear\r\ndefinition of the phenomenon and a clear knowledge of\r\nits causes and roots, has weakened international efforts\r\nto combat it. We nevertheless believe that it is time to\r\nput into effect an international counter-terrorism\r\nstrategy based on cooperation and exchange of\r\ninformation among countries and the need to\r\ndistinguish between the legitimate right to self-defence\r\nand resist oppression and terrorist acts committed by\r\noutlaw individuals or groups that kill and terrorize\r\ncivilians as both a means and an end.\r\nThere is no doubt that the United Nations and all\r\nits subsidiary bodies and relevant international\r\ninstitutions need development and modernization to\r\nenable them to better serve the interests of States and\r\nadapt to new international developments. Accordingly,\r\nthe development and modernization process should go\r\nbeyond the mere expansion or reduction of the\r\nmembership of certain councils and committees. It\r\nshould be based on a new concept that focuses on\r\ngiving a strong new impetus to all those bodies and\r\ncouncils, to enable them to perform the functions\r\nentrusted to them in the service of security, stability\r\nand comprehensive development in the world.\r\nAs for the process of improving the performance\r\nof the United Nations, we should like to affirm that for\r\nthat process to succeed, it must be continuous and\r\ncomprehensive, without time frames or deadlines.\r\nMoreover, it should include all bodies of the United\r\nNations, and take into consideration new developments\r\non the international scene, in a manner that would help\r\nimprove the performance of collective international\r\naction and provide a prompt response to the challenges\r\nfaced by our contemporary world.\r\nIn view of all the foregoing, it has become\r\nessential to create the right balance between the\r\nfunctions and mandates of the principal organs of the\r\nUnited Nations, improve procedures, and reduce the\r\nitems on the agendas of some of these organs to better\r\nreflect the current challenges facing the international\r\ncommunity. Such measures should not impair the\r\nability of those organs to deal with important\r\nsubstantive matters. The United Nations should play a\r\ndecisive and central role in designing international\r\neconomic policies. The role of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council should not be limited to reviewing\r\nprogrammes approved by the United Nations. That\r\nCouncil must develop its dialogue and solidarity with\r\nthe Bretton Woods institutions and the World Trade\r\nOrganization, especially in the field of world economic\r\npolicymaking.\r\nIt would also be useful to coordinate efforts\r\namong international and regional organizations in the\r\ninterests of complementarity.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency President\r\nZine El Abidine Ben Ali, President of the Republic of\r\nTunisia, delivered on his behalf by His Excellency\r\nMr. Abdelwaheb Abdallah, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Tunisia.\r\nMr. Abdallah (Tunisia) (spoke in Arabic): I have\r\nthe honour to convey the sincere greetings of His\r\nExcellency President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Tunisia, and to deliver His\r\nExcellency’s address to this United Nations High-level\r\nMeeting.\r\n“I am pleased to express my deep\r\nappreciation of the efforts made by all parties to\r\nensure an excellent preparation for this United\r\nNations High-level Meeting. I wish also to\r\ncommend the role played by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan in providing the optimum\r\nconditions for its success.\r\n“Let me also convey to the Government of\r\nthe United States and the friendly American\r\npeople our condolences and sympathy with\r\nrespect to the hurricane, express the solidarity of\r\nthe Tunisian people with the bereaved families\r\n27\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nand voice the hope that they may promptly\r\novercome the challenges now facing them.\r\n“This special meeting, which is part of the\r\nprocess of assessing progress in the\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Summit Goals\r\nadopted by the United Nations General Assembly\r\nfive years ago, assumes today a special\r\nsignificance, as peoples around the world expect\r\nit to live up to their aspirations for peace,\r\nsecurity, development and prosperity.\r\n“Tunisia helped to crystallize those noble\r\nobjectives by presenting a number of proposals\r\nand initiatives. My country will continue to\r\npromote its effective role in developing methods\r\nof multilateral action based on its firm\r\ncommitment to the United Nations Charter and\r\nthe establishment of a world order based on the\r\nprinciples of solidarity, justice and equality.\r\n“It gives us cause for pride that the results\r\nachieved in Tunisia on the path of reform,\r\ndevelopment and modernization over the past two\r\ndecades are in line with the Development Goals\r\nset by the Millennium Summit, particularly in\r\nterms of reducing the rate of poverty, improving\r\nthe Gross Domestic Product, spreading education\r\nthroughout the country, strengthening gender\r\nequality, promoting reproductive health, and\r\nintegrating the principles of sustainable\r\ndevelopment into national policies.\r\n“Those results are the fruits of continued\r\nnational efforts in the process of comprehensive\r\nreform based on the primacy of law, the\r\nanchoring of the mechanisms of good\r\ngovernance, and the establishment of a close\r\ncorrelation between democracy, the protection\r\nand development of human rights in all their\r\ndimensions as an indivisible whole, and the\r\nachievement of economic and social\r\ndevelopment.\r\n“Tunisia remains convinced that achieving\r\nthe Millennium Goals requires joint efforts by the\r\ninternational community — Governments and\r\norganizations alike — in order to further promote\r\nthe values of solidarity in helping developing\r\ncountries, particularly in the African continent, to\r\nimplement their development programmes and\r\nplans and meet the challenges of modernity and\r\nprogress.\r\n“In that respect, we welcome the steps taken\r\nby a number of developed nations to allocate 0.7\r\nper cent of their gross domestic product to the\r\nachievement of those Goals by 2015. We also\r\nhope that similar measures and initiatives will be\r\ntaken to provide medium-income developing\r\ncountries with the means and mechanisms\r\nnecessary to increase their development efforts\r\nand bolster their economic and social\r\nprogrammes.\r\n“Poverty, destitution, famine and other\r\nscourges confronting many regions of the\r\nworld — particularly in Africa — require that, as\r\na matter of urgency, we address their root causes\r\ncomprehensively through a movement of\r\nsolidarity involving the various components of\r\nthe international community. In that context, we\r\nbelieve the time has come to provide the financial\r\nresources needed to enable the World Solidarity\r\nFund to begin the work for which that United\r\nNations mechanism was established — following\r\nits adoption by the General Assembly on the basis\r\nof a Tunisian proposal — to eradicate poverty,\r\nexclusion and marginalization, in accordance\r\nwith the Millennium Summit policy guidelines.\r\n“Our 1998 appeal for the convening of the\r\nWorld Summit on the Information Society\r\nreflected our resolve to establish a global\r\nknowledge society offering everyone equal\r\nopportunities for access to the benefits of\r\nscientific and technological progress, which\r\nwould help to narrow the digital and\r\ndevelopmental divide between developed and\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\n“Tunisia, which is working to provide the\r\nbest possible conditions for the holding of the\r\nsecond phase of that important international event\r\nfrom 16 to 18 November 2005, looks forward to\r\nmassive and high-level participation by Members\r\npresent at this summit through representatives of\r\nGovernments, non-governmental organizations\r\nand the private sector so as to ensure the success\r\nof its proceedings and the achievement of the\r\nobjectives pursued, which are essentially in line\r\nwith those set out in the Millennium Declaration.\r\n“The changes occurring in the international\r\nsphere require that we all work to establish a\r\nsound framework for reforming the United\r\n28\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nNations system and restructuring its bodies in\r\nline with the requirements of the current phase,\r\nparticularly with regard to expanding the Security\r\nCouncil and strengthening the role of the General\r\nAssembly and of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil.\r\n“It is our hope that this Meeting will result\r\nin the adoption of consensual practical measures\r\nthat will support development programmes\r\nthroughout the world and strengthen the\r\nfoundations of collective security — particularly\r\nby combating terrorism, tackling its root causes\r\nand reducing the number of weapons and the\r\nspread of weapons of mass destruction — in\r\norder to enshrine the pivotal role that the United\r\nNations is called upon to play in all those vital\r\nareas and to enable the Organization to continue\r\nto work to implement the lofty goals for which it\r\nwas founded 60 years ago.\r\n“I am confident that the Gabonese and\r\nSwedish co-chairpersons of this important\r\nmeeting will assist in the achievement of the\r\ndesired goals and that recommendations will be\r\nissued that will consolidate the foundations of\r\nsecurity, stability and sustainable development\r\nthroughout the world.”\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): I now give the\r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Raymond Ramazani Baya,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and International\r\nCooperation of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nMr. Ramazani Baya (Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo) (spoke in French): I should like at the\r\noutset to express, on behalf of the Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo, my feelings of support and solidarity to\r\nthe American people, who have been hit hard by a\r\nnatural disaster. I welcome the movement of solidarity\r\nin the international community, in conjunction with the\r\nefforts of the American Government, to restore some\r\nhope and ease the suffering of the people affected by it.\r\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo, for its\r\npart, is emerging from a long armed conflict\r\nconsidered to be the first “African world war” — a war\r\nthat has deeply divided the country, shattered its\r\neconomy and destroyed its basic infrastructure, its\r\nschools, its hospitals and its administration. For three\r\nyears, the Government of National Unity has been\r\nstriving to get the country working again, to complete\r\nits reunification by re-establishing transportation\r\nnetworks, rebuilding schools and hospitals, restoring\r\nState authority throughout the national territory,\r\nestablishing a national republican army and, above all,\r\npreparing for the first general elections in more than 40\r\nyears.\r\nAgainst that difficult background my country has\r\nincorporated the Millennium Development Goals into\r\nits anti-poverty strategy. But, despite that difficult\r\ncontext, the results are not negligible. Economic\r\ngrowth has been between 6 and 7 per cent for three\r\nyears, the financial and legal framework has been\r\ntightened up, the national currency exchange rate has\r\nbeen stabilized, inflation has been brought under\r\ncontrol, and peace and security have been restored in\r\nmost of the national territory. Those are considerable\r\nachievements, given the realities of the recent past.\r\nHere, I should like to commend the essential role\r\nplayed by the international community in the upturn in\r\nmy country’s political and economic situation.\r\nAs we can see, the progress made by my country\r\nis real, even if its pace is still slow — too slow, given\r\nthe acute needs and problems that exist. HIV/AIDS,\r\nmalaria and tuberculosis ravage the most dynamic parts\r\nof the population. We must therefore redouble our\r\nefforts to provide everyone easier access to health care,\r\neducation and employment.\r\nThe challenges that must be met to achieve the\r\nMillennium Development Goals are considerable. The\r\nresolve of the Congolese people and the involvement\r\nof their Government will not be enough; more\r\nresources will need to be allocated, as a matter of\r\npriority, to the fight against poverty.\r\nThat is why the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo wishes, first, to reaffirm its faith in the\r\nMonterrey Consensus, which is a key factor in\r\nmobilizing the necessary financial resources for\r\ndevelopment. Secondly, we welcome the handling of\r\nthe debt issue through the outright cancellation of the\r\ndebt of 18 of the poorest countries. It is our desire and\r\nhope that that measure will be extended to other\r\ndeveloping countries. Thirdly, we wish to congratulate\r\nthe developed countries, particularly France, on the\r\ninitiative to identify new financing sources — in\r\nparticular, a levy on air tickets — and on the\r\ncommitment to devote 0.7 per cent of their gross\r\nnational product to official development assistance by\r\n2015.\r\n29\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nGiven the new threats overshadowing our planet,\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo believes it\r\ncrucial that we reinforce the international\r\npeacebuilding and conflict prevention structures. We\r\nmust combat terrorism in all its forms. We must also\r\nadopt clear principles governing the use of force and\r\nmust strengthen the United Nations capacity in this\r\nfield.\r\nI wish to take this opportunity to once again\r\nthank the Secretary-General, the Security Council and\r\nthe entire United Nations system, on behalf of the\r\nCongolese Government and President Joseph Kabila,\r\nwho was unable to travel to New York. We convey to\r\nthem our thanks for the tireless efforts made in order to\r\nresolve the crisis in the Great Lakes region.\r\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo believes\r\nin the United Nations, and we hope that the ongoing\r\nreform process, a process that is relevant and\r\nnecessary, will reflect all the changes that have taken\r\nplace since the creation of the Organization in 1945.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): I call next on\r\nHis Excellency The Honourable Siosiua ’Utoikamanu,\r\nMinister of Finance of Tonga.\r\nMr. Siosiua ’Utoikamanu (Tonga): At the outset,\r\nI take this opportunity to express Tonga’s deepest\r\ncondolences and heartfelt sympathy to the Government\r\nand people of the United States of America for the\r\nlosses suffered in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina\r\non the Gulf Coast.\r\nThe historic Millennium Declaration adopted in\r\n2000 set a number of specific and time-bound Goals\r\nwith the universal vision of the Member States for a\r\nmore peaceful, prosperous and just world, in which all\r\nhuman beings can live better and safer lives. We meet\r\nagain here in New York to take stock of where we are,\r\nreview our overall achievements, highlight the issues\r\nand constraints and appraise the options available to us\r\nas a collective group in order to bring us back on track\r\nand ensure that the specified targets that we, as a\r\nglobal community, set are met by 2015.\r\nWe need to be constantly reminded as to why the\r\nGoals are important, and Professor Sachs in his report\r\non the Millennium Project aptly summarizes the\r\nmanifold reasons as follows: for the international\r\npolitical system, they are the fulcrum on which\r\ndevelopment policy is based; for the billion plus people\r\nliving in extreme poverty, they represent the means to a\r\nproductive life; for everyone on Earth, they are the\r\nlinchpin of the quest for a more secure and peaceful\r\nworld.\r\nWhat have we achieved over the last five years?\r\nAt a global level, although considerable progress has\r\nbeen made in achieving many of the goals, progress\r\nhas been disproportionate across regions and countries.\r\nProgress has also been disproportionate in relation to\r\nthe Goals. At the same time, there have been many\r\nmissed opportunities. The final score as we step on the\r\nscale is that we are found wanting. But all is not lost,\r\nbecause we once again have this unique opportunity to\r\npull together and renew our commitments to truly\r\nmake a difference.\r\nAs far as my own country, Tonga, is concerned,\r\nwe have achieved targets such as universal primary\r\neducation and gender equality through the provision of\r\nfree primary school education for children of ages 5 to\r\n14 years, as stipulated in our Constitution.\r\nConsiderable improvements have also been achieved in\r\nsecondary enrolment rates. Tonga’s performance on the\r\nHuman Development Index and the Human Poverty\r\nIndex reflects a high level of expenditure in health and\r\neducation, stagnant population growth and sustained\r\nhigh levels of investment in the social sector. The\r\nHuman Development Report 2005 ranked Tonga 54th\r\namong 177 countries. However, much still needs to be\r\ndone in terms of further improvement in the quality\r\nand level of delivery of services, and this is currently\r\nbeing addressed by the Government through a\r\ncomprehensive health and education sector-wide\r\nprogramme jointly financed by domestic resources,\r\noverseas development assistance (ODA) and loan\r\nfunds. The majority of the population has access to\r\nsafe water and sanitation facilities in both rural and\r\nurban areas.\r\nOne of the areas where Tonga needs to make\r\nmore progress is in the participation of women in\r\ndecision-making, both at the local and national levels.\r\nThe current level of women’s participation is largely\r\nattributed to cultural overtones, and there are\r\nsignificant efforts to educate and promote the greater\r\ninvolvement of women in the political arena.\r\nSmall island developing countries, including\r\nTonga, face many unique challenges because of our\r\nsmall populations, remoteness and dispersed locations,\r\nnarrow resource endowment and vulnerability to\r\nexternal shocks, including from international market\r\n30\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nfluctuations and natural disasters. The development of\r\nregional and international alliances, such as the Pacific\r\nPlan, as well as the Mauritius Strategy adopted at the\r\nInternational Meeting to Review the Implementation of\r\nthe Programme of Action for the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States, held\r\nin January 2005, play a crucial role in addressing these\r\nunique challenges in an environment subject to rapidly\r\nchanging forces.\r\nThe Pacific Plan promotes three main approaches\r\nto regionalism. The first of these is regional\r\ncooperation through intergovernmental dialogue and\r\nthe sharing of experiences and lessons learned. Second\r\nis the regional provision of goods and services that can\r\nbenefit from the pooling of national services at the\r\nregional level. Third of all is regional integration\r\nthrough the lowering of market and technical barriers\r\nbetween countries.\r\nThe continuing escalation in the price of oil and\r\nits consequent negative impact on our development\r\nefforts is of concern to us, and we therefore support\r\naccelerated efforts to research alternative sources of\r\nenergy.\r\nWhile we fully recognize that the national\r\nGovernments should take responsibility for their\r\ndevelopment efforts, we are also cognizant of the fact\r\nthat domestic financial resources on their own will not\r\nbe sufficient to finance our respective countries’\r\ndevelopment programmes. The Monterrey Consensus\r\nfully recognized that for a number of countries,\r\nincluding small island developing States, overseas\r\ndevelopment assistance is still the largest source of\r\nexternal financing and is critical for the achievement of\r\nthe Development Goals and targets of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration and other internationally agreed\r\ndevelopment targets.\r\nTonga, therefore, welcomes the renewed\r\ncommitment made by donor partners to meeting the\r\ntarget of 0.7 per cent ODA of their gross national\r\nincome by 2015. We also welcome the United Nations\r\ndeclaration on innovative sources of financing for\r\ndevelopment that provides mechanisms to increase and\r\nsupplement traditional sources of finance. However, we\r\nalso recognize that ODA, while necessary, will not be\r\nsufficient and will have to be complemented by foreign\r\ndirect investment, trade and development partnership.\r\nTonga supports the proposal for a comprehensive\r\npackage of reforms to revitalize the General Assembly,\r\nas well as the strengthening of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council, in order to fulfil its mandate as\r\nenvisaged by the Charter. We also support the ongoing\r\nwork of the Secretary-General to continuously improve\r\nthe efficiency and effectiveness of the Secretariat.\r\nOn the issue of the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil, we support a Security Council that is more\r\nbroadly representative of the international community\r\nas a whole and the geopolitical realities of today and\r\nthe expansion of its membership to meet these goals. In\r\nthis regard, Tonga maintains its support of Japan’s\r\nproper and permanent place on any enhanced Council.\r\nIn conclusion, the achievement of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals by 2015 is still a reality, but it can\r\nonly be made possible if all the parties concerned fulfil\r\ntheir respective roles and obligations. Let us deliver on\r\nour promises and truly make a difference.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): I now give the\r\nfloor to His Excellency The Right Honourable\r\nSir Rabbie Langanai Namaliu, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs and Immigration of Papua New Guinea.\r\nMr. Namaliu (Papua New Guinea): Mr. President,\r\nwe congratulate you on your assumption of the\r\npresidency of the sixtieth session of the United Nations\r\nGeneral Assembly. We compliment Gabon and, in\r\nparticular, The Honourable Jean Ping, whose tenure as\r\nPresident of the fifty-ninth session of the Assembly\r\nwill be remembered as a fulcrum of critical change\r\ninitiated at the United Nations.\r\nDifficult as it has been, the draft outcome\r\ndocument provides something for everyone. We\r\nacknowledge that much more could have been\r\nincluded. However, in our view, there is sufficient\r\ndetail in the document to allow for critical reform\r\nissues to be followed up and elaborated on, particularly\r\nduring the sixtieth General Assembly.\r\nWe are extremely pleased that the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), which provide each of\r\nour countries with a set of focused benchmarks for\r\naddressing critical development issues, have been\r\nmaintained in full.\r\nWe also strongly support the underlying\r\nprinciples of the Jakarta Declaration, to which His\r\nExcellency the President of Indonesia referred this\r\nmorning. We therefore call upon the international\r\ncommunity and the United Nations to respond to and\r\nsupport this important Declaration.\r\n31\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nThe challenge to the MDGs, in our view, is to\r\nnationalize and localize them in order to achieve the\r\noverall performance targets by 2015. While we endorse\r\nthe importance of ensuring that those global targets are\r\nreached, we also strongly believe that we need to focus\r\non the sustainability of the MDGs beyond 2015.\r\nAs a nation we have reviewed the MDGs and the\r\nmethods to achieve them. In a recently completed joint\r\nreport with the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme, Papua New Guinea’s scorecard indicated\r\nthat much more needed to be done. A number of ways\r\nhave been considered to implement the MDGs. The\r\nmedium-term development strategy adopted by our\r\nGovernment this year is an attempt to provide a road\r\nmap for implementation. The medium-term\r\ndevelopment strategy will tie the MDGs into the\r\nnational development process and enable funding for\r\ntheir implementation through our national budgetary\r\nprocess.\r\nAs part of the development agenda, we also note\r\nwith great satisfaction the inclusion of the Mauritius,\r\nBrussels and Almaty action plans. We call upon the\r\ninternational community to continue assisting all\r\ncountries in meeting the aims elaborated in each of\r\nthose plans and the associated declarations.\r\nWe strongly believe that the principles of\r\ndevelopment and security — being intertwined and\r\ninseparable — must continue to underpin the\r\ninternational peace and security paradigm. Needless to\r\nsay, it is our collective global responsibility. Papua\r\nNew Guinea has assisted and will continue to assist the\r\nglobal process by acceding to and continuing to\r\ncomply with international treaties relating to terrorism\r\nand measures to combat that scourge as part of our\r\nresponsibility and contribution to addressing this\r\ncritical issue. However, we do note that issues relating\r\nto surveillance and other critical practical measures to\r\ncombat terrorism need to be addressed along with their\r\nhigh operational costs.\r\nNext month the leaders of the Pacific Islands\r\nForum will endorse a Pacific plan. Security along with\r\neconomic growth, sustainable development and good\r\ngovernance will provide the four central pillars and\r\npriority areas for the region.\r\nIn recent times, multinational regional forces,\r\nboth armed and unarmed, have been engaged in\r\nconflict and post-conflict operations. With strong\r\nlogistical support from Australia and New Zealand,\r\nregional member countries have contributed troops and\r\npolice to restore peace and order successfully on the\r\nisland of Bougainville in Papua New Guinea and in the\r\nSolomon Islands. In the case of Bougainville, we\r\nacknowledge and greatly appreciate the strong support\r\nfrom the United Nations, in particular from the\r\nSecurity Council, and from United Nations agencies.\r\nThose two regional initiatives just mentioned\r\ngive credence to the call for stronger regional\r\ncooperation to supplement national and global efforts\r\nto achieve peace and stability for the enhancement of\r\neconomic prosperity.\r\nMy country became a 30-year-old democracy\r\ntoday, and the hopes and aspirations we had when we\r\njoined the United Nations 30 years ago as its one\r\nhundred and forty-second member still remain. We\r\nhave had difficulties and successes. We have had\r\nsuccess, for instance, in maintaining a continuous but\r\nchallenging democratic political system along with its\r\nrelated institutions. As we have moved on as a\r\ndemocracy we have learned many lessons including\r\nthis one: that the application of democratic principles,\r\nmuch like the development process, is not a one-size-\r\nfits-all process. While the ideals of democracy provide\r\nus with the best options for development, the\r\nimposition of the experiences of others is not\r\nnecessarily conducive to it. Like other Member States,\r\nwe are keen to work for and with the United Nations\r\nDemocracy Fund.\r\nFinally, we look forward to the adoption of the\r\ndraft outcome document as it provides us with a good\r\nbasis to move the United Nations reform agenda\r\nforward.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): I now give the\r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Mustafa Osman Ismail,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Sudan.\r\nMr. Ismail (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): At the\r\noutset, allow me to express my country’s heartfelt\r\ncondolences and sympathy to the people and\r\nGovernment of the United States of America for the\r\nlosses caused by Hurricane Katrina.\r\nI wish to congratulate the Co-Chairpersons, on\r\ntheir election to preside over this historic and\r\nimportant meeting. I am fully confident that their\r\nwisdom and political and diplomatic expertise will\r\nguide us towards the desired results. I wish also to\r\nexpress my deep appreciation to Mr. Jean Ping for his\r\n32\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nable conduct of the work of the fifty-ninth session of\r\nthe General Assembly, which made all the preparations\r\nfor this Meeting. I commend His Excellency Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, Secretary-General of the United Nations, for\r\nhis commitment and persistence in leading this\r\ninternational Organization on the path of reform,\r\nmodernization and advancement towards its noble\r\ngoals and purposes.\r\nThe concerted and constructive efforts exerted by\r\nthe international community and crowned by this\r\nhistoric Summit are most praiseworthy. This is a\r\ncourageous initiative that demonstrates the awareness\r\nand responsiveness of the international community in\r\nassuming its responsibilities. At the same time, it\r\nreflects our sincere desire to work collectively and to\r\nconfront steadfastly the challenges that lie ahead of us\r\nin building a new international order based on justice,\r\nequality and respect for human dignity and governed\r\nby the principles of international law.\r\nThis is a historic and unique opportunity for us to\r\nshoulder our responsibilities and face present threats\r\nsquarely, strengthening the central role of the United\r\nNations and enabling it to assume its function of\r\neffectively maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity. The Organization has been and should remain\r\nthe common platform for collective responsibility,\r\nmultilateralism, and a firm resolve to create a stable\r\nand secure world.\r\nIn that regard, this Summit represents a real test\r\nof the international community’s will to effect the\r\nchanges that all Member States of the Organization seek.\r\nAt the forefront of the priorities of this Summit is\r\nthe issue of sustainable development and the liberation\r\nof billions of people from poverty, disease and hunger.\r\nIn this respect, we are deeply concerned about the\r\nmodest progress made in implementing the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, which have allowed millions of\r\npeople to hope for a world in which they can live in a\r\nminimum of human dignity.\r\nThe economic and social conditions in the least\r\ndeveloped countries continue to deteriorate badly.\r\nMoreover, the number of least developed countries has\r\nincreased since the Millennium Summit. That grave\r\ndevelopment should remind us that what we decide to\r\ndo to help those countries during this summit will be\r\nthe criterion for measuring the credibility of our\r\ncommitment to development and poverty reduction.\r\nThe least that we can do is to assist those countries to\r\nimplement the Brussels Programme of Action on time.\r\nIt is necessary to formulate strategies and policies\r\nthat address the concerns and needs of developing\r\ncountries with respect to enhancing capacity-building\r\nand economic progress. Collective security will remain\r\nillusory until we fulfil the needs of developing\r\ncountries. We cannot achieve a secure world while the\r\nAfrican continent continues to suffer the burdens of\r\ndebt, poverty, disease and the extreme inequality of the\r\ninternational economic and trading systems. To restore\r\nthe global economic balance, it is essential to cancel all\r\ndebts, fulfil official development assistance obligations\r\nand allow developing countries to take their place in\r\nthe international trading system.\r\nDeeply believing that terrorism is a threat to\r\ninternational stability and security, the Sudan reaffirms\r\nits condemnation of all forms and manifestations of\r\nterrorism and calls for the intensification of efforts to\r\ncombat terrorism through concerted international\r\nefforts guided by the principles of international\r\nlegitimacy. In that context, we support the call to hold\r\nan international conference to reach agreement on a\r\ndefinition of terrorism and to find ways and means of\r\ncombating it. It is also important to distinguish\r\nterrorism from the legitimate right of peoples to resist\r\nforeign occupation.\r\nWe emphasize the need to respect the principles\r\nof international legitimacy in combating terrorism by\r\npreventing all unilateral measures and violations of\r\ninternational law.\r\nIn that context, we recall that since 1998, the\r\nSudan has repeatedly called on the United Nations and\r\nthe international community to take a just position\r\nconforming with the principles of justice and\r\ninternational law regarding the 1998 attack on the al-\r\nShifa pharmaceutical factory on the pretext of\r\ncombating terrorism. That attack negatively affected\r\nmy country’s development efforts and deprived my\r\npeople of basic medicines. Today, we reiterate our call\r\non the United Nations to take just and necessary\r\nmeasures in accordance with international law, and we\r\nappeal to the entire international community to support\r\nour just and legitimate demand.\r\nThe Sudan firmly believes that the idea of a clash\r\nof civilizations is a fallacy. We are all striving to build\r\na humanitarian world whose peoples enjoy peace,\r\nsecurity, stability and a peaceful coexistence. My\r\n33\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\ncountry therefore welcomes and supports the initiative\r\nof the Prime Minister of Spain calling for a dialogue\r\namong civilizations. The Sudan is committed to\r\nsafeguarding the dignity of humankind and respect for\r\nits rights, guided by its values, heritage and beliefs.\r\nThe problems arising in the field of human rights are a\r\nresult of selectivity, double standards and the\r\nmisappropriation of the issue of human rights for\r\npolitical ends. Thus, what is basically required is a\r\nreform of practices, not only of institutions.\r\nMembers have undoubtedly followed the\r\ndevelopments of the Sudanese situation, which led to\r\nthe signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement\r\nnow being assiduously implemented in both letter and\r\nspirit. In that connection, I express my sadness at the\r\nloss of Mr. John Garang, who was a genuine and strong\r\npartner in the achievement of that peace agreement. I\r\nexpress our deep appreciation to the international\r\ncommunity for its support during the years of war,\r\nwhen it provided necessary humanitarian essentials and\r\nsupport for the peace efforts. We are confident that the\r\ninternational community will continue to accompany\r\nus along our path to peace and stability. The Oslo\r\ndonors conference and its outcome are a great\r\ntestimony to that support. The Sudan requires\r\nconsiderable resources for reconstruction, the\r\nrehabilitation of the displaced and refugees and the\r\npromotion and strengthening of peace.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): I now give the\r\nfloor to Mr. Mohamed Ould El Abed, Minister for\r\nEconomic Affairs and Development of Mauritania.\r\nMr. El Abed (Mauritania) (spoke in Arabic): It is\r\nan honour for me to take the floor before the Assembly.\r\nThe President of the Military Council for Justice and\r\nDemocracy and head of State, Colonel Ely Ould\r\nMohamed Vall, has asked me to convey his regrets that\r\nhe was unable to be here because of pressing\r\nengagements connected with the democratic transition\r\nin Mauritania and requested me to convey his best\r\nwishes for the success of the meeting.\r\nLike many countries, Mauritania hoped to benefit\r\nfrom the winds of democracy that have blown across\r\nthe world since the beginning of the 1990s. However,\r\nthe attempt to achieve democracy was aborted after the\r\ncaricatural implementation of the 1991 Constitution\r\nand the excessive personalization of power. A deep\r\npolitical crisis ensued, characterized by the stifling of\r\npublic freedoms and the arrest of politicians, opinion\r\nleaders and intellectuals. Clandestine movements\r\nemerged, and a number of coups d’état were attempted.\r\nAt the same time, economic reforms faltered, and poor\r\nmanagement was rampant, contributing to the\r\ncontinued deterioration of the people’s living\r\nconditions. The lack of political prospects, in particular\r\nthe impossibility of changing the situation through\r\nelections, posed a serious threat to the country and its\r\nfuture, leading the armed forces and the national\r\nsecurity forces to decide unanimously to take\r\ncorrective measures on 3 August 2005 to halt the\r\ncountry’s dangerous slide. That change, which was\r\ncarried out peacefully, without bloodshed and without\r\ndisturbing people’s everyday lives, was greeted with\r\ngreat joy and tremendous popular support\r\nunprecedented in the history of our country.\r\nA national consensus formed around the\r\nobjectives of the corrective measures, as was witnessed\r\nby delegations from fraternal and friendly countries\r\nand the missions of regional and international\r\norganizations that visited our country recently. The\r\nobjective of the measures was to create the conditions\r\nfor the establishment of a genuine rule of law and a\r\npluralist democracy, which alone can ensure respect for\r\nhuman rights and good, transparent management of\r\npublic affairs. The restructuring was to be\r\naccomplished within two years, with the participation\r\nof all political, economic and social actors of the\r\ncountry. Those conditions are indispensable for the\r\nsuccess of any development policy and for the effective\r\nand optimal use of official development assistance and\r\nof the national and international resources needed to\r\nfinance development.\r\nAt this historic moment in our country’s life,\r\nwhich coincides with the summit to review the\r\nprogress towards the Millennium Development Goals\r\nand the means to finance them, we express our\r\nsatisfaction with this meeting. We believe that\r\ndeveloping countries have special challenges above\r\nand beyond national consensus on development and the\r\nneed to establish policies based on equity, justice and\r\nequal opportunity. Those challenges cannot be met\r\nwithout the dynamic and effective solidarity and\r\ncooperation of the international community, especially\r\nthe rich countries.\r\nMauritania welcomes the major important topics\r\nthat were articulated in United Nations summits and\r\nmeetings. In that regard, the Monterrey Consensus was\r\nthe starting point of the partnership for development\r\n34\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nbetween rich and poor countries. The objectives of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), to which we\r\nfully subscribe, are a point of reference for\r\ndevelopmental strategies and for assessing progress.\r\nMauritania’s achievement of the MDGs will\r\nrequire long and arduous efforts. Members of our\r\nOrganization surely know of our political situation\r\nbefore 3 August 2005, which I have just described.\r\nThat situation did not enable us to make significant\r\nprogress towards implementation of the MDGs. On the\r\ncontrary, the situation was not at all conducive to\r\neffective governance or to effective allocation of\r\nfinancial resources. The result of this was that public\r\npolicies had a limited impact on reducing poverty.\r\nA recent evaluation of the implementation of the\r\nMDGs in Mauritania has found that only a few targets\r\ncan be implemented by 2015, while a number of\r\nothers — and some of them very important ones, such\r\nas health and the environment, among others —\r\ncannot, unless major economic and political changes\r\nare made. The Government is mindful of this situation,\r\nand we have committed ourselves to integrating in our\r\nupcoming national plans the achievement of the MDGs\r\nas a fundamental priority. Emphasis will be placed on\r\nnational appropriations for MDGs, institutional\r\ncapacity-building, improvement of the legal framework\r\nand promotion of a dialogue with the various actors,\r\nparticularly the private sector and civil society.\r\nThese new trends, in terms of good\r\ngovernance — in particular, reducing costs for security,\r\nscrupulous management of public finances and the\r\npriority allocation of resources to social sectors to\r\ncombat poverty — will provide a new impetus to speed\r\nup the implementation of the MDGs in Mauritania.\r\nNevertheless, the scope and requirements of the task go\r\nbeyond the country’s capacity and call for ongoing\r\nmobilization on the part of the donors to help finance\r\ndevelopment and overcome poverty.\r\nThe determined wish of Mauritania’s Military\r\nCouncil for Justice and Democracy to build a\r\ndemocratic society is apparent from the agenda for a\r\ndemocratic transition, which sets out the following\r\npoints: first, organizing a constitutional referendum\r\nwithin 12 months; secondly, organizing legislative and\r\npresidential elections that are free and transparent, in\r\ntwo years at the most; thirdly, reform of the judiciary\r\nto guarantee its independence and transparency; and,\r\nfourthly, the establishment of a system of good\r\neconomic governance. The various measures adopted\r\nsince the correctionist movement of 3 August 2005 will\r\nensure the carrying out of this agenda and will usher in\r\na new democratic era, one that will be full of hope for\r\nthe people of Mauritania. The implementation of these\r\nmeasures will be in addition to the formation of a\r\ntransitional civil Government, the release of all\r\npolitical prisoners sentenced for their opinions, the\r\nineligibility of the present members of the Military\r\nCouncil to stand in future legislative and presidential\r\nelections and, lastly, the opening up of public media.\r\nThis climate of freedom and national harmony\r\nwill create conditions favourable to the success of the\r\ndemocratic transition process and to the mobilization\r\nof all Mauritanian citizens in achieving the MDGs, the\r\npurpose of the Summit that brings us together today.\r\nIn conclusion, I sincerely thank both fraternal and\r\nfriendly countries and the international and regional\r\norganizations for their support. We reiterate our appeal\r\nto them for encouragement as we build and develop a\r\ndemocratic and prosperous Mauritania.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): I give the floor\r\nnext to His Excellency Mr. Abdurrahman Mohamed\r\nShalghem, Secretary of the General People’s\r\nCommittee for Foreign Liaison and International\r\nCooperation of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.\r\nMr. Shalghem (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke\r\nin Arabic): At the outset, I would like to express the\r\ncondolences of the Libyan people and their leader,\r\nColonel Muammar Al-Qadhafi, to the people and\r\nGovernment of the United States of America for the\r\ntragedy spawned by Hurricane Katrina.\r\nIt gives me great pleasure to congratulate the Co-\r\nChairpersons on their election to preside over the\r\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting. Undoubtedly, the\r\ndeliberations of this forum will be guided effectively\r\nand will achieve optimal results, thanks to their\r\nwisdom and competence. I would like also to take this\r\nopportunity to express our satisfaction with the manner\r\nin which their predecessor, Mr. Jean Ping, Foreign\r\nMinister of Gabon, steered the deliberations of the\r\nprevious session of the General Assembly and the\r\nintensive consultations that were conducted throughout\r\nthe past year in preparation for this meeting.\r\nWe wish also to express our gratitude for the\r\nefforts exerted by Secretary-General Kofi Annan to\r\ncarry out the decisions of the Organization, to fulfil the\r\n35\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\ngoals of the Charter and to embark on a comprehensive\r\nreform process of all United Nations bodies.\r\nSince the founding of the United Nations, our\r\ncountries have convened regularly at this forum in\r\norder to realize the objectives embodied in the Charter\r\nand achieve the aspirations of our peoples to the\r\nattainment of peace, security, progress and prosperity\r\nthrough joint efforts. A great deal has been achieved in\r\nsome areas, but many challenges remain. Some of\r\nthese challenges are older than this Organization, such\r\nas poverty, ignorance, disease and armed conflict.\r\nOthers are new, brought about by the changes and\r\nscientific progress that the world has witnessed in\r\nrecent decades. These challenges include eliminating\r\nweapons of mass destruction, countering terrorism and\r\ntransnational organized crime, reaping maximum\r\nbenefits from the information revolution and making\r\noptimum use of biotechnology, taking into account\r\nethical norms and considerations.\r\nInternational solidarity, translated into concrete\r\naction, is the only way to establish an equitable global\r\neconomic system that would achieve sustainable\r\ndevelopment and lead to partnership on an equal\r\nfooting between North and South. Such solidarity\r\nwould be conducive to realizing the objectives\r\nexpressed in the Millennium Declaration.\r\nTo reach all these goals, we have to find ways of\r\nachieving the objectives set out in the Millennium and\r\nDoha Declarations and by the Monterrey and\r\nJohannesburg Conferences for optimal use of the\r\nearth’s resources, for putting an end to conflicts,\r\npoverty, illiteracy, epidemic diseases such as AIDS and\r\nmalaria, for provision of water for all and for\r\nachievement of sustainable development.\r\nWe also need effective international cooperation,\r\nunder the umbrella of the United Nations, in order to\r\neradicate terrorism and transnational organized crime,\r\neliminate all weapons of mass destruction and ensure\r\nfull respect for human rights and the rule of law.\r\nMoreover, we need to strengthen international\r\nsolidarity in combating racism and xenophobia and\r\nimplementing our obligations to protect the\r\nenvironment and counter desertification.\r\nIt is also incumbent upon us to work seriously\r\ntowards the achievement of our target of halving the\r\nnumber of people suffering from hunger by the year\r\n2015, take decisive action to resolve the problem of\r\nexternal debt, which burdens a number of developing\r\ncountries, and remove the obstacles that impede the\r\naccess of their products to international markets.\r\nDeveloped countries also have an obligation to\r\nprovide as official development assistance to\r\ndeveloping countries the agreed-upon percentage of\r\ntheir gross national income. Furthermore, developed\r\ncountries that impose coercive measures on some\r\ndeveloping countries must put an end to such measures\r\nin a show of respect for international decisions that\r\nhave condemned such measures and have asked for\r\ntheir cancellation.\r\nWe seize this occasion to urge creditors, from\r\nboth developed countries and international institutions,\r\nto cancel the debts of poor countries. We call for the\r\nintensification of international efforts to eradicate\r\nagricultural pests, introduce low-cost water\r\ndesalination plants, combat desertification, and reclaim\r\nlands and render them suitable for agriculture.\r\nSixty years have elapsed since this Organization\r\nwas founded. Yet, despite all the sincere efforts that\r\nhave been made, it has not lived up to its Charter\r\npromises in such matters as alleviating human\r\nsuffering caused by war, poverty, disease and illiteracy.\r\nThis state of affairs has resulted from the fact that the\r\nvictorious countries that wrote the Charter conferred on\r\nthemselves rights and privileges which led to the\r\nmarginalization of the General Assembly and rendered\r\nthe Security Council, in its present form, inequitable\r\nand unbalanced. Those factors made the Organization\r\nless democratic and led to abuse of the veto privilege.\r\nThose States deemed friends have received support\r\neven when they were wrong, enabling them to enjoy\r\nimpunity and escape condemnation. Other States,\r\nhowever, have been unjustly punished by sanctions\r\nbecause their policies were considered inharmonious\r\nwith those of several of the privileged countries on the\r\nSecurity Council. The United Nations has thus failed to\r\nadminister justice to all peoples, making it imperative\r\nfor all of us to endeavour to reform the Organization.\r\nIn view of the fact that there are now 191\r\nMember States and that new problems impeding\r\nemancipation and growth have arisen — including\r\ndevelopment, terrorism, the environment, poverty and\r\nepidemics — reform requires that decision-making\r\npower rests solely with the General Assembly. All\r\nseats in the General Assembly should be equal, and the\r\nSecurity Council should become a mechanism for\r\n36\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nimplementing General Assembly resolutions, not a\r\nforum for vetoing them.\r\nWe have made our position known in document\r\nA/59/876 of 18 July 2005. Africa is the only continent\r\nthat does not have the permanent seat on the Security\r\nCouncil that it deserves. This should be taken into\r\naccount in reforming the United Nations. Such reform\r\nshould enable the continent to compete for new\r\npermanent seats on the Security Council.\r\nAs a member of the African Union, we affirm our\r\nadherence to the African Common Position issued by\r\nthe fifth African Union Summit, held in Sirte on 4 and\r\n5 July 2005, and reaffirmed by the fourth extraordinary\r\nsession of the Assembly of the African Union, held in\r\nAddis Ababa on 4 August 2005. That Position holds\r\nthat two permanent Security Council seats should be\r\nallocated to Africa, with full privileges, including the\r\npower of veto, in addition to five non-permanent seats.\r\nIt also calls for strengthening the lead role of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nWe prefer that the two permanent African seats\r\nbe reserved for the African Union rather than for\r\nspecific countries. We thank Members for having\r\nresponded to our proposal to postpone discussion of\r\nSecurity Council reform in order to allow for the\r\npossibility for reaching a practical formula that would\r\nserve peace, security, stability and progress in the\r\nworld.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): I now give the\r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Abdullahi Sheikh Ismail,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Somali Republic.\r\nMr. Ismail (Somalia): It gives me great pleasure\r\nto address this assembly of world leaders and to\r\npresent our sincere congratulations to the Co-\r\nChairpersons on their well-deserved election. We are\r\nconfident that they will guide our deliberations to a\r\nsuccessful conclusion. Let me also commend Mr. Jean\r\nPing for the able manner in which he conducted the\r\nwork of the Assembly during his presidency.\r\nOn behalf of the Transitional Federal Government\r\nof Somalia allow me first and foremost to convey our\r\nsincere condolences to the President and the people of\r\nthe United States of America, in particular to the\r\npopulations living on the Gulf coast, where a ferocious\r\nhurricane has killed and displaced thousands of people,\r\ndestroying cities and infrastructure, causing untold\r\nhardship and suffering. We are indeed happy and\r\nencouraged by the overwhelming support and\r\ninternational solidarity extended to the victims of that\r\ntragedy and hope that the distressed families will\r\nregain normal life as soon as possible. The Somali\r\npeople truly associate themselves with the anxieties\r\nand pain experienced by the people of the United\r\nStates of America, and we feel that our human\r\nsolidarity could be considered as a most valuable\r\nexpression of compassion and moral help.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to\r\ncongratulate the United Nations upon its sixtieth\r\nanniversary and to express our renewed confidence and\r\ncommitment to this world body working for\r\ninternational peace and the progress of humanity. We\r\nalso commend the Organization for the tireless and\r\ninvaluable contribution it has made towards the\r\nattainment of sustainable peace and socio-economic\r\ndevelopment, as well as for upholding the political\r\nrights of all people, irrespective of race, gender, social\r\nstatus or beliefs.\r\nOf course, nobody can deny that setbacks and\r\ngeneral disappointments were unavoidable in the\r\nhistory of the United Nations and that certain\r\nexpectations were not completely fulfilled, but the\r\nideals remain intact and as valid as on the day of the\r\nOrganization’s inception.\r\nThe world is still ravaged by conflicts, political\r\nmisperceptions and poverty that still need to be\r\naddressed so that harmony, understanding and an\r\nequitable sharing of resources can be attained in the\r\ninterest of world peace and unprejudiced international\r\ncooperation.\r\nThe recognition of the right of the Palestinian\r\npeople to a State of their own alongside Israel and a\r\npeaceful Middle East region are still fundamental aims\r\nto be achieved so as to strengthen world peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nIn this new post-cold-war era, internal conflicts\r\nare replacing inter-State confrontations in international\r\naffairs. Any new situation demands a fresh approach,\r\nso there is a need for a new outlook in order to have\r\nsustainable regional and international stability.\r\nPoverty and underdevelopment cannot be\r\ndissociated from the increased international tension\r\nand conflict that afflict political stability in various\r\nparts of the world, thus poisoning normal relationships\r\nbetween nations, because boundaries are pointless in\r\n37\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nthis age of global interaction. There can be no human\r\nsecurity unless this reality of interconnectedness is\r\ntaken into proper consideration in all our policy and\r\ndecision-making processes. Today, the balance of\r\nrational reasoning is the only guarantee of international\r\nsecurity and comprehension; we cannot rely on\r\nimbalances of force.\r\nReforming the United Nations is one of the key\r\nways to face all of these new challenges of the new\r\nmillennium by making the Organization more\r\ndemocratic, transparent, efficient and capable of\r\nresponding to the diverse aspirations and concerns of\r\nthe various components of the international community\r\nat the continental and regional levels.\r\nLet me now turn to the current developments in\r\nmy country, Somalia. The conflict that has prevailed in\r\nSomalia for the past 14 years is attributed basically to\r\nthe absence of an adequate international response. It is\r\nwell known that the upsurge of civil war has led to a\r\ntotal collapse of our national institutions and\r\ninfrastructure, with drastic consequences and grave\r\nimplications for the stability of the entire region and\r\nfor international peace and security.\r\nI am not here to dwell at length on the causes of\r\nthe conflict, but on its costs and consequences, since\r\nevil can originate from imperceptible man-made\r\ntragedies and circumstances. International political\r\nindifference and a sense of inertia have characterized\r\nthe conduct of the international community, which has\r\naggravated the civil war and allowed unabated human\r\nsuffering and environmental destruction to continue in\r\nmy country. What the Somali people desire and deserve\r\nis active engagement on the part of the international\r\ncommunity and not abandonment or a surrender of\r\nhope.\r\nThe past, with all its sorrows, is past but the\r\nrepercussions of forgotten international obligations are\r\nstill vivid and present. The international community\r\nmust contribute to the revival of our State and to stand\r\nby our side in our effort to rebuild our nation rather\r\nthan indulging in trivialities. Here, there must be\r\nsynergy of great minds and principled commitments to\r\nhelp the Somali people overcome their political and\r\nhuman debacle rather than assuming a pathetic or\r\npassive attitude.\r\nIn this context, however, we cannot forget the\r\ncritical role of States members of the\r\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD),\r\nthe African Union, the IGAD Partners Forum, the\r\nEuropean Union, the Arab League and the United\r\nNations in providing support and encouragement for\r\nthe Somali national reconciliation process that took\r\nplace in Kenya for almost three years.\r\nAt this juncture, allow me to express our deep\r\ngratitude to the Government and the people of Kenya\r\nfor hosting the Somali National Reconciliation\r\nConference. We also thank our brothers in Kenya and\r\nin all neighbouring countries for sheltering thousands\r\nof Somali refugees in their territory throughout these\r\nyears of turmoil and conflict.\r\nMoreover, a special tribute goes to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Kofi Annan for his tireless efforts to\r\nbring the Somali conflict to an end and for all the\r\nhumanitarian aid that has been provided during these\r\nlong years of unrest and civil strife.\r\nThe culmination of all these efforts was the\r\nestablishment of a Transitional Federal Government,\r\nwhose delegation to this summit is guided by His\r\nExcellency Mr. Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, President of\r\nthe Federal Republic of Somalia.\r\nNow, as we speak, the new state institutions are\r\noperating from within our country, temporarily from\r\nJowhar, the provincial capital of the lower Shabelle\r\nregion, situated only 90 kilometres from Mogadishu,\r\nthe capital city of Somalia.\r\nThe Transitional Federal Government is actively\r\nengaged in promoting a favourable political and\r\nsecurity climate and is committed to establishing\r\noperational offices in the capital and in other parts of\r\nthe country as an essential part of its political\r\nobligation to reach out to the entire population and\r\npromote broad-based, grassroots reconciliation.\r\nThe Transitional Federal Government is\r\ncommitted to the strengthening and consolidation of\r\nthe transitional institutions as pillars of democratic\r\ngovernance without, at the same time, condoning the\r\nuse of domestic differences of opinion to undermine\r\nthe achievements of a two-year-long reconciliation\r\nprocess and perpetuate anarchy and chaos again.\r\nHowever, direct dialogue will be our key\r\ninstrument to promote inter-institutional cooperation\r\nwithout sacrificing the aspirations of our people. No\r\ngroup will ever be denied the opportunity to have an\r\nindependent political platform, within the context of\r\n38\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nnormal and acceptable parliamentary and constitutional\r\ntraditions.\r\nWe feel that the stability of Somalia should not be\r\nthe work of the Somalis alone, as wickedly — I repeat\r\nwickedly — propagated and as often repeated. Though\r\nthe responsibility for past failure is partly ours, the\r\ninternational community has no excuse for distancing\r\nitself, regardless of what situation prevails. It is,\r\ntherefore, our firm belief that the international\r\ncommunity should support us fully in this crucial\r\nconsolidation period so as to restore peace and stability\r\ncompletely for the sake of nation-building and the\r\nreconstruction of our country, since everything has to\r\nstart from scratch.\r\nThe absence of firm support for the readmission\r\nof Somalia into the fold of the international community\r\nand for making it stable will only play into the hands\r\nof international terrorism and of those who promote the\r\ncontinuation of an environment of chaos and\r\nlawlessness.\r\nIn conclusion, the Transitional Federal\r\nGovernment deems this rostrum the appropriate place\r\nfrom which to launch a vibrant appeal to the members\r\nof the international community to come to the aid of\r\nSomalia with all their determination and resources, to\r\nhelp our people overcome 14 years of civil war and the\r\nconsequent deterioration in all spheres of life. That will\r\nhelp not only to safeguard regional stability but also to\r\nsafeguard the stability of the international community\r\nas well.\r\nThe Transitional Federal Government strongly\r\nurges the United Nations to support the current\r\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development and\r\nAfrican Union efforts to send a peace stabilization\r\nmission to Somalia in order to help restore peace and\r\nsecurity and prevent a reoccurrence of hostilities and\r\nviolence, so that the transition period will be\r\ninstrumental in establishing the democratic society to\r\nwhich we aspire and which will permit us to achieve\r\nlong-lasting peace once again.\r\nFor the values of solidarity to prevail as far as\r\nSomalia is concerned, we urgently call upon the\r\ninternational community to act swiftly, without wait-\r\nand-see attitudes, which could produce an undesired\r\nslide backwards instead of forward movement towards\r\nstability and institutional consolidation.\r\nIn the name of our people — men, women,\r\nchildren, elders, all the displaced families and our\r\ndeprived younger generation — I strongly appeal to the\r\nAssembly and, in all humility, hope that our plea will\r\nbe heeded.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): I call next on\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Mario Fortín Midence, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Honduras.\r\nMr. Fortín Midence (Honduras) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): Multilateralism is a political necessity.\r\nHonduras feels protected by an effective multilateral\r\nsystem based on full respect for international law and\r\nbuilt on the foundations of the purposes and principles\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nAs we assess these 60 years of our Organization’s\r\nhistory — an anniversary we celebrate with joy — we\r\nview this summit and this General Assembly as an\r\nopportunity for hope, change and renewal. Never\r\nbefore in history have so many heads of State and\r\nGovernment been present and participated in the\r\ndebates as during these three days. That encourages us.\r\nNonetheless, we are concerned that we have not\r\nyet been able to achieve a higher level of\r\nunderstanding on elements that are vital to allow our\r\nOrganization to assume greater responsibility vis-à-vis\r\nthe challenges of this millennium. It was with some\r\ndisappointment that we received the report dealing\r\nwith the comprehensive reform of the United Nations.\r\nWe would have liked further progress rather than the\r\ndeferral of a decision to an uncertain date. It would\r\nhave been gratifying to come out of this meeting with\r\nan agreement on the reform of the Security Council\r\nand to see admitted to the Council new States that are\r\nnet contributors to the economic and social\r\ndevelopment of peoples, such as Japan and Germany.\r\nWe would also have been pleased to return to our home\r\ncountry with a stronger agreement to ensure the full\r\nimplementation of fundamental human rights. We\r\nregret the fact that work was not completed in time for\r\nthe creation of the Human Rights Council, an initiative\r\nproposed by the Secretary-General which we\r\nenthusiastically support.\r\nOur Charter enshrines universality of\r\nparticipation as well as the inalienable right of all\r\npeace-loving people that abide by its principles to be\r\npresent in our deliberations and to be stakeholders in\r\nthe agreements adopted here. For this reason, we\r\nunderstand the aspiration of the people of Taiwan, who\r\n39\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nwant to share with us the responsibility of building a\r\nbetter world for all.\r\nConscious of our commitment to international\r\npeace and security, we express our hope that a\r\ncomprehensive convention on terrorism will be\r\nconcluded as soon as possible. Terrorism is a scourge\r\nthat tramples all principles underfoot, be they moral or\r\nreligious, and violates all human rights. For this\r\nreason, we welcome the assessment document as an\r\ninstrument to speed our work and to make new and\r\nstronger agreements possible.\r\nFive minutes to assess progress and evaluate\r\nobstacles on the path to the attainment of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals is very little time.\r\nHonduras is following the course charted by our\r\nnational consensus, reflected in the formulation of a\r\nstrategy for poverty reduction and a policy for its\r\nimplementation. Honduras is taking firm steps towards\r\nbuilding a more inclusive democracy.\r\nOur gross domestic product (GDP) has exceeded\r\nthe goals we set, and investment in the fight against\r\npoverty, has, as a proportion of GDP, also been slightly\r\nhigher than forecast. Indicators in education, the\r\nenvironment, gender issues and other areas are also\r\nencouraging, but they have not reached the level to\r\nwhich my Government aspires.\r\nIt is our hope that the resources released through\r\nforeign debt cancellation, in the framework of the\r\nHighly Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative, the\r\nParis Club and the G-8, and the redirection of those\r\nfunds to finance integral development through the fight\r\nagainst poverty will do much to help us meet the\r\ndeadline in attaining our goals for the year 2015. All\r\nHondurans are firmly committed to this.\r\nEqually important in this regard are the funds\r\nfrom the Millennium Challenge Account, which are\r\ngeared towards the sectors of road infrastructure and\r\nagricultural productivity. Although some progress has\r\nbeen made, that very progress is jeopardized by high\r\nprices for petroleum products. In fact, these high prices\r\nundermine, threaten and compromise the fight against\r\npoverty and all the goals that we have established and\r\npledged to fulfil by the year 2015. The increase in fuel\r\nprices in recent months represents for Honduras an\r\nexpenditure 25 times higher than what is invested each\r\nyear in free school lunches for all the children of our\r\ncountry. These prices are unacceptable. They constitute\r\nan affront to the poor, who thereby become further\r\nimpoverished.\r\nOur Organization must, as a matter of urgency\r\nand without excuses, seek a mechanism that can help to\r\nstem this constant increase, the impact of which on\r\ndeveloping countries is really dramatic.\r\nNo less dramatic and moving are the scenes\r\nshowing the tragedy in the southern states of the\r\nUnited States of America. Hundreds of thousands of\r\npersons, including a very large number of Hondurans,\r\nare now trying to find a way to overcome the\r\ndevastating effects of Hurricane Katrina. We extend to\r\nall of them the warm solidarity of the people of\r\nHonduras and of the Government of President Ricardo\r\nMaduro.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): Before giving\r\nthe floor to the next speaker, I wish to inform members\r\nabout the corrected versions of paragraphs 60 (a), 163\r\nand 164 (c) of the draft outcome document (A/60/L.1).\r\nPlease discard earlier versions and use only the 6.30\r\np.m. version, which is now being distributed. The 6.30\r\np.m. version is the only valid one.\r\nI also wish to inform members that delegations\r\nhaving linguistic concerns about draft resolution\r\nA/60/L.1 should transmit them in writing to the\r\nSecretariat. Such linguistic corrections will be reflected\r\nin the final version of the draft resolution.\r\nI call now on His Excellency Mr. Abdullah\r\nMohamed Alsaidi, Chairman of the delegation of\r\nYemen.\r\nMr. Alsaidi (Yemen) (spoke in Arabic): First of\r\nall, I should like to congratulate Ambassador Eliasson\r\non his election to the presidency of this session.\r\nIt is an honour to participate in this Meeting,\r\nwhere we are considering the extent to which the\r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) have been\r\nachieved in an effort to create a world of prosperity\r\nand progress.\r\nIt is my duty to present the condolences and\r\nsympathies of the Government and the people of the\r\nRepublic of Yemen to the people and the Government\r\nof the United States of America in the wake of the\r\nrecent natural disaster, Hurricane Katrina. We must\r\ncreate an international mechanism within this\r\nOrganization to strengthen and coordinate efforts\r\naimed at alleviating the suffering of victims of natural\r\n40\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\ndisasters, and also to design early warning systems to\r\nreduce the colossal losses and damage caused by them.\r\nNow that we have entered the twenty-first\r\ncentury, we must take another look at the state of\r\ninternational relations, so that they will be based on\r\ntrust, dialogue and cooperation. We must, therefore,\r\nfocus totally on United Nations reform, reconciling\r\nviewpoints, while avoiding fragmented interests that\r\nwould not help us to achieve the goals of such reform.\r\nWhile the reform process will allow us to expand\r\nsome bodies or to create other bodies, the aim must be\r\nto strengthen credibility and transparency, while at the\r\nsame time enhancing the role of the Organization and\r\nits effectiveness in maintaining and building peace.\r\nThe Republic of Yemen stresses the importance\r\nof implementing the MDGs adopted in 2000, as well as\r\nthe Monterrey Consensus and the outcome of the\r\nJohannesburg Summit, in order to free humankind from\r\nwant, poverty and disease. At the same time, we are\r\nconvinced that those lofty objectives cannot be\r\nachieved unless there is equity in international trade\r\nrelations. Indeed, trade barriers and protectionism clash\r\nwith the objectives of the World Trade Organization\r\nand undermine the attainment of the MDGs in\r\ndeveloping countries. It is also important for developed\r\ncountries to fulfil their commitments, by providing\r\nsupport and the necessary investments to help build\r\ncapacities in the least developed countries.\r\nWe are convinced of the importance of the MDGs\r\nand how to achieve them; therefore, our country has\r\nundertaken some financial, administrative and legal\r\nreforms and measures with the involvement of non-\r\ngovernmental organizations (NGOs) and civil society\r\npartners, which are essential in helping us achieve\r\nsocio-economic progress in our country.\r\nMoreover, the Government of Yemen, in\r\ncooperation with donor countries, international\r\norganizations and specialized agencies, has established\r\nits second five-year plan to curb poverty by means of\r\nquick-impact projects to train professionals, provide\r\nhealth services and build roads, so that all public\r\nservices reach all parts of the country. We should also\r\ncommend the G-8 countries on what they have done to\r\nprovide debt relief to 16 African countries; but other\r\ncountries also suffer from debt, and the G-8 should\r\ngive similar attention to countries that have the same\r\nproblems.\r\nI am certain that if international efforts to achieve\r\neconomic and political reform, promote good\r\ngovernance and combat poverty were to go beyond\r\nmere words and become programmes and plans of\r\naction, humanity would know stability and prosperity\r\nand international relations would be marked by mutual\r\nunderstanding, genuine partnership and converging\r\ninterests.\r\nFinally, I should like to thank Secretary-General\r\nKofi Annan for his ongoing efforts to reform our\r\nOrganization. I also wish to thank Mr. Jean Ping,\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth\r\nsession, for guiding the difficult negotiations that\r\nculminated in the draft outcome document (A/60/L.1).\r\nWe extend to him our best wishes.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): We shall now\r\nhear brief oral presentations by the Chairpersons of the\r\nfour round-table sessions. I first give the floor to the\r\nDeputy Permanent Representative of Australia,\r\nAmbassador Frances Lisson, who, on behalf of the\r\nChairman of the round-table session held on\r\nWednesday afternoon, His Excellency Mr. John\r\nHoward, Prime Minister of Australia, will present a\r\nsummary of that round table.\r\nMs. Lisson (Australia): I have the honour to\r\npresent to the General Assembly, on behalf of the\r\nChairman of round table 1, His Excellency Mr. John\r\nHoward, the Prime Minister of Australia, a brief\r\nsummary of the round table, which was held on\r\nWednesday, 14 September 2005. Prime Minister\r\nHoward had to leave this afternoon and has asked me\r\nto present the statement on his behalf.\r\nThe broad sentiment that was shared in the round\r\ntable was a sense of optimism for the future of the\r\nUnited Nations. That prevalent sentiment was evident\r\ndespite some ambivalent comments around the table on\r\nthe draft outcome document (A/60/L.1) to be adopted\r\nby the Assembly later this evening. Most of the\r\nparticipants felt that the draft outcome document\r\nexcluded many things which should have been at its\r\nheart and that it has not gone far enough in other\r\nmatters. As one participant put it, this view is the result\r\nof the politics of expectation: the expectations of this\r\nsummit were much higher and much more wide-\r\nranging than what is contained in the draft outcome\r\ndocument. The major sense of disappointment relates\r\nto neglect of the issues of disarmament and the risk of\r\nnuclear proliferation.\r\n41\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nHowever, on the positive side, strong support was\r\nexpressed for the Peacebuilding Commission, the\r\nrevamping of the United Nations human rights\r\nmachinery and the recognition of the mutual\r\ninterdependence of the developed and the developing\r\nworlds. The other significant trend in our discussions\r\nwas the strong emphasis on poverty eradication and on\r\nmeeting our commitments for the realization of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nIn summary, the overall sense of the round table\r\nwas that the draft outcome document represents a\r\ngeneral balance of issues and that it contains clear\r\nbenefits that are achievable through the Peacebuilding\r\nCommission, the Democracy Fund, the “responsibility\r\nto protect” and development outcomes.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): I give the floor\r\nto the Permanent Representative of Poland,\r\nMr. Andrzej Towpik, who, on behalf of the Chairman\r\nof the round-table session held yesterday morning, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Aleksander Kwasniewski, President of\r\nthe Republic of Poland, will present the summary of\r\nthat round table.\r\nMr. Towpik (Poland): Half an hour ago, the\r\nPresident of Poland, Mr. Aleksander Kwasniewski, had\r\nto leave the Hall, with great regret, for technical\r\nreasons. I will read out his report.\r\n“More than 26 world leaders and\r\nrepresentatives of United Nations entities, took\r\nthe floor to evaluate our draft outcome document\r\n(A/60/L.1), to highlight its gaps and other\r\ndeficiencies, to bring out the promising elements\r\nand to make further suggestions for reforms.\r\nThese leaders emphasized that multilateralism\r\nwas the only way to respond to the challenges\r\nand threats of the increasingly interdependent and\r\nglobalized age of the twenty-first century. There\r\nwas a remarkable call to make the summit the\r\nsummit of solidarity, especially with Africa, the\r\nsummit of responsibility in a broad partnership\r\nfor development, the summit of the individual\r\nwith progress on human rights and the new\r\nHuman Rights Council, and, last but not least, the\r\nsummit of courage to accelerate the reform of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\n“My impression of the round-table\r\ndiscussion is that we share a positive feeling\r\nabout the sixtieth-anniversary summit of the\r\nUnited Nations. As one of the participants said,\r\nthe train is moving in a good direction, but we\r\nneed to ensure that there are no accidents on the\r\nway. The reforms at all levels have to be pursued\r\nwith a sense of justice, fair play and respect for\r\nhuman rights, fundamental freedoms and civil\r\nliberties. As another participating leader put it,\r\nour global village needs global democracy. The\r\ngeneral view was that the reforms are not a one-\r\noff event but a process, a step in a long journey.\r\n“My second impression is that the\r\nparticipants strongly supported the idea of\r\nenhancing our efforts to promote development,\r\nincluding making the Millennium Development\r\nGoals an operational reality. Development and\r\npoverty eradication remain one of the most\r\nimportant pillars of the United Nations, and we\r\nmust not be found lacking in energy in realizing\r\nthose ambitious Goals when we reach 2015.\r\nInternational solidarity for development seems to\r\nbe a necessity, and all domestic efforts must be\r\ncomplemented by those of the international\r\ncommunity at large.\r\n“My third general observation on the round-\r\ntable discussion concerns the strong support\r\nexpressed for the initiatives of strengthening\r\nhuman rights and promoting democracy. The\r\nlaunching of the Democracy Fund and the\r\nintention to continue work on the establishment\r\nof the Human Rights Council need to be\r\nconsolidated, and our objectives in this regard\r\nshould be reinforced and carried out.\r\n“The three hours of discussions in an\r\ninformal, interactive mode lead me to conclude\r\nthat there are more areas of convergence than of\r\ndivergence. The summit has provided us with an\r\nexcellent opportunity for candid exchanges, and I\r\nconclude by sharing the sense of optimism for the\r\nfuture of multilateralism and the role of the\r\nUnited Nations. But there is a long way to go,\r\nand determination and the full implementation of\r\nour decisions and resolutions will be required.”\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): I now give the\r\nfloor to the Chairperson of the round-table session held\r\nyesterday afternoon, His Excellency The Honourable\r\nWinston Baldwin Spencer, Prime Minister of Antigua\r\nand Barbuda.\r\n42\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nMr. Spencer (Antigua and Barbuda): It was an\r\nhonour and a privilege for me to chair round table 3,\r\nand now I face the daunting task of presenting to the\r\nAssembly a summary of the complex discussion. I\r\nwould like to thank those leaders who participated\r\nactively in round table 3 for what I believe was an\r\ninspiring exchange of views on a broad canvas of\r\nissues.\r\nAt a general level, my sense of the round table is\r\nthat the leaders expressed both enthusiasm and\r\nfrustration, enthusiasm on the progress made in some\r\nareas and, at the same time, frustration with the lack of\r\nprogress in other areas. I believe that while much\r\nremains to be done for a world free from want and fear,\r\nthe discussion underscored that the steps taken so far\r\nare significant in helping to meet the aspirations and\r\nthe concerns of people everywhere. The summit, after\r\nall, is not the proverbial silver bullet but the launch of\r\na process and the indication of the collective will for\r\nchange.\r\nMany of the statements around the table focused\r\non development. Participants stressed the importance\r\nof the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).\r\nExamples were provided of how the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals were systematically used by\r\nnational institutions to assess and guide public policies\r\nin the economic and social fields. Some leaders spoke\r\nof the adoption of new targets, for example, on\r\ndomestic violence. And the idea of strengthening the\r\nglobal partnership to implement the MDGs was\r\nsupported.\r\nSpeakers underlined the need for a coherent\r\npolicy on trade and aid, as well as the need to assess\r\nthe impact of aid policies, for example, procurement\r\nrules on the quality of aid. Some mutually reinforcing\r\ndeficits were highlighted as undermining the\r\nachievement of MDGs, namely the deficit of resources\r\nand limited implementation.\r\nThe unique challenges of landlocked and small\r\nisland developing nations were addressed. Several\r\nparticipants underscored the potential of information\r\nand communications technologies (ICT) to help\r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals and other\r\ndevelopment goals and, in light of this, the importance\r\nof improving developing countries’ access to ICT.\r\nConcerns about the global environment, especially the\r\nvulnerability of small island developing States, pointed\r\nto the need for tackling diverse problems in a spirit of\r\nsolidarity.\r\nThe increased presence of United Nations field\r\noffices in small island developing States was\r\nconsidered necessary to cover the wide geographic\r\nareas over which the islands are spread, ensuring\r\nenvironmental sustainability, resolute action on climate\r\nchange before the expiry of the Kyoto Protocol in 2012\r\nand concrete measures on desertification were all\r\nstressed as key global challenges.\r\nThe General Assembly’s decision to cancel debt\r\narrears for several highly indebted poor countries was\r\npraised, yet participants noted that the quality and\r\neffectiveness of aid were equally important and that all\r\nofficial development assistance should be equally\r\nprovided to all countries in need.\r\nOf concern was the lack of progress in addressing\r\nthe debt problem of middle-income countries.\r\nParticipants were also concerned about the issue of\r\nconditionality attached to debt cancellation and the\r\nimpact this would have on the quality of aid.\r\nIn addition, the need for coherence of aid and\r\ntrade policies was underlined in order to ensure that\r\nofficial development assistance, trade and debt relief,\r\nwhen taken together, would lead to a net result that was\r\npositive for development.\r\nThe hope was expressed that the G-8 commitment\r\nto double aid to Africa by 2010 would be realized.\r\nEfforts made by Africa to stand as a solid counterpart\r\nto its development partners were emphasized. The New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) was\r\nrecognized as a good home-made initiative which\r\ndeserved strong external support.\r\nThe importance of making international trade a\r\nreal engine for development was emphasized. The\r\nearly completion of the Doha round of multilateral\r\ntrade negotiations was considered essential.\r\nParticipants welcomed the reference in the outcome\r\ndocument to access and benefit sharing in relation to\r\ngenetic resources and underlined the importance of\r\nglobal cooperation in developing information and\r\nknowledge-based societies as a vehicle to nurture\r\ndemocracy and eradicate poverty.\r\nThe link between humanitarian assistance and\r\ndevelopment was emphasized and the need for greater\r\ninternational cooperation to establish the context for\r\n43\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nevolving durable solutions and addressing root causes\r\nof crises, abuse and instability highlighted.\r\nParticipants welcomed the proposed reform of the\r\nUnited Nations human rights machinery. Some called\r\nfor the development of a set of criteria against which\r\nthe human rights record of all countries would be\r\nassessed.\r\nSpeakers stressed the need for United Nations\r\nreform and emphasized that this historic opportunity to\r\nstrengthen the United Nations should not be missed\r\nand that the reform process should be guided by open\r\nand extensive consultations.\r\nIt was also stressed that the interests of\r\ndeveloping countries, which account for two thirds of\r\nUnited Nations membership, should be safeguarded in\r\nthe process. The need for a more representative\r\nSecurity Council was emphasized, including through\r\nan increased presence and weight of African countries.\r\nA reformed United Nations would give developing\r\ncountries a sense of ownership in the Organization,\r\nmaking the decisions of its organs easier to implement.\r\nDespite the mixed views we have on the details\r\nof the draft outcome document (A/60/L.1), it was\r\nheartening for me to hear the continued faith expressed\r\nin multilateralism through the United Nations in order\r\nto meet the aspirations of our people. I hope that the\r\npromise of the draft outcome document will be realized\r\nthrough quick progress on the commitments contained\r\ntherein. Where further action is needed, the General\r\nAssembly should work extra hours and hard to ensure\r\nthat the contours of the ideas are transformed into firm\r\nlegislative and operational realities before momentum\r\nis lost.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): I give the floor\r\nto the Chairman of the round-table session held this\r\nmorning, His Excellency Mr. Olusegun Obasanjo,\r\nPresident of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\r\nPresident Obasanjo: It gives me great pleasure\r\nto present to the General Assembly a brief summary of\r\nround table 4, which was held this morning and which\r\nI had the honour to chair. Members have heard\r\nsummaries of three round tables already, and, while not\r\nbreaking new ground, round table 4 added its own\r\nperspectives to the forthcoming deliberation.\r\nMy overall impression of this morning’s candid\r\ndiscussion is that our shared assessment of the summit\r\nis that it is a success. Not an unqualified success in the\r\nsense that all 191 Member States can go home and\r\nclaim that they have achieved everything that they\r\nwanted. But a success in that we reaffirmed our faith in\r\nthe multilateral system. We have also prepared the\r\ngroundwork for the significant changes and reforms in\r\nwhich this Assembly must actively engage to give\r\neffective meaning in a legislative and operational\r\nsense.\r\nThe outcome document clearly emphasizes the\r\nvital role that the United Nations has to play in the\r\ntwenty-first century, particularly in its broad\r\nrecognition of the interconnection between security\r\nand development, the creation of the Peacebuilding\r\nCommission, the establishment of the principle of the\r\nresponsibility to protect, and the emerging will to give\r\nshape to a Human Rights Council.\r\nOf course, gaps and omissions remain. These\r\ninclude the failure to agree on reform of the Security\r\nCouncil, which no longer represents the realities of\r\n2005, or on measures to further non-proliferation and\r\ndisarmament, and a sense of disappointment that the\r\nhigh expectations on a broad range of issues, including\r\nthe concept of impunity and the role of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court, were not met. The\r\nlanguage on the right to protect crystallizes a\r\ncommitment to make sure that we do not see a repeat\r\nof Rwanda, Darfur and other terrible events that have\r\ncharacterized the past decade.\r\nThis is a truly significant achievement. It must be\r\naccompanied with a will to protect. Participants also\r\nreiterated their condemnation of terrorism as one of the\r\ngreatest threats to international peace and security and\r\nemphasized the importance of redoubling efforts\r\ntowards a global convention against terrorism.\r\nThe need to assist developing countries lacking\r\ncapacity to combat terrorism was also stressed. One\r\narea that was singled out was the need for safe\r\ntransportation by sea and air. Security of the sea lanes\r\nmust be enhanced. Development must remain at the\r\ncentre of trade negotiation. Moreover, globalization\r\nmust be more inclusive and equitable. The specific\r\nneeds of developing countries must be taken into\r\nconsideration and favourable access to markets should\r\nbe granted to small countries. Special efforts have to be\r\nmade to help developing countries, and especially\r\nthose in Africa, to build an environment able to attract\r\nforeign investment.\r\n44\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nA concern regarding the capacity of low- and\r\nmiddle-income countries to reach the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals was also expressed. One\r\nsuggestion was to facilitate access to international\r\nfinancial institutions for countries listed as low- and\r\nmedium-income States. We need reform of the\r\ninternational monetary and financial institutions, as\r\nwell as to set right other systemic imbalances, to\r\nensure equitable development.\r\nAnother cause for optimism is the promise of the\r\nreform of the management and budget of the United\r\nNations. A broad consensus emerged with regard to the\r\nneed to strengthen and reform the United Nations so\r\nthat it can effectively play its vital role in addressing\r\nthe multidimensional challenges faced by the\r\ninternational community in the twenty-first century.\r\nEmphasis was laid on the need to heighten\r\ndemocratization in the decision-making of international\r\norganizations. In that connection, one participant called\r\nfor the strengthening of the power of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council so that it can address the integration of\r\ntrade and finance and development issues.\r\nFinally — and this will be the greatest challenge\r\nof all — national commitments must now be fulfilled.\r\nThe gap between commitments and actions should not\r\ncontinue, and we should return home, after the summit,\r\ndetermined to take action at the national and\r\ninternational levels. In that context, the role of national\r\nparliaments in defining and implementing development\r\npolicies was identified — a role which could be\r\nmaximized through a strategic partnership between the\r\nInter-Parliamentary Union and the United Nations.\r\nI leave here today with a profound sense of\r\noptimism for the days ahead. While it is clear that\r\nmuch work remains to be done by the international\r\ncommunity at the sixtieth session of the General\r\nAssembly, nevertheless the progress achieved by the\r\nsummit in its draft outcome document must not be\r\nunderestimated. The momentum gained must continue\r\nin order to move forward with the implementation of\r\nthe broad agreement achieved.\r\nItems 48 and 121 of the provisional agenda\r\nIntegrated and coordinated implementation of and\r\nfollow-up to the outcomes of the major United\r\nNations conferences and summits in the economic,\r\nsocial and related fields\r\nFollow-up to the outcome of the Millennium Summit\r\nDraft resolution (A/60/L.1)\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): We shall now\r\nturn to draft resolution A/60/L.1, entitled “2005 World\r\nSummit Outcome”.\r\nWe, the leaders of the world, have for three days\r\ndiscussed how the United Nations can be strengthened\r\nto meet the challenges of the twenty-first century. The\r\nbasis for our deliberations has been the draft outcome\r\ndocument negotiated under the able leadership of\r\nMr. Jean Ping, former President of the General\r\nAssembly, and referred to the summit by the General\r\nAssembly earlier this week. It is a package of changes\r\nto enhance the system of collective security. Following\r\nthe Millennium Declaration, it reviews progress and\r\nmakes recommendations in the areas of development,\r\npeace and security, human rights and institutional\r\nreform. The Assembly has before it document\r\nA/60/L.1. It is my sincere hope that this Meeting can\r\nadopt the document entitled “2005 World Summit\r\nOutcome”, thereby sending a strong political message\r\nabout our collective commitment to the United Nations\r\nand its Charter.\r\nBefore proceeding further, I should like to consult\r\nthe Assembly, with a view to proceeding with the\r\nconsideration of draft resolution A/60/L.1, entitled\r\n“2005 World Summit Outcome”. In that connection,\r\nsince the draft resolution has only been circulated this\r\nmorning, it would be necessary to waive the relevant\r\nprovision of rule 78 of the rules of procedure. The\r\nrelevant provision of rule 78 reads as follows:\r\n“As a general rule, no proposal shall be discussed\r\nor put to the vote at any meeting of the General\r\nAssembly unless copies of it have been circulated\r\nto all delegations not later than the day preceding\r\nthe meeting.”\r\nUnless I hear any objection, I shall take it that the\r\nAssembly agrees with my proposal to waive that\r\nprovision of rule 78 of the rules of procedure.\r\n45\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): We shall now\r\nproceed to consider draft resolution A/60/L.1.\r\nI call on the representative of the Bolivarian\r\nRepublic of Venezuela, who wishes to speak in\r\nexplanation of position before action is taken on the\r\ndraft resolution.\r\nMr. Rodríguez Araque (Venezuela) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): These have been very bright, warm days in\r\nNew York. In contrast, however, the decision with\r\nregard to the outcome document, which may very\r\npossibly be endorsed in the next few minutes, will be a\r\nrather grim one. It was conceived in darkness and\r\nbrought forth from the shadows to be approved here, in\r\nviolation of the basic democratic processes governing\r\nthe practice of sound democracy in the world.\r\nThis process did in fact begin with a wide-\r\nranging debate that aroused the hope that, given the\r\nscope of that debate and the consultations that occurred\r\ninitially, it would also be possible for there to be a\r\nbroad and informed discussion that enjoyed the\r\nmeasured agreement of the Assembly. But then the\r\nanalysis and preparation of the document was restricted\r\nto a small group of 32 persons, and subsequently to an\r\neven smaller group of 15 persons. It is my\r\nunderstanding that, in the end, many of the comments\r\nmade from various quarters were put aside by an even\r\nsmaller group.\r\nIn the reservation that I was obliged to express on\r\nbehalf of the delegation of the Bolivarian Republic of\r\nVenezuela at the fifty-ninth session, I indicated that the\r\nprocedure followed was so grotesque that it did not\r\neven allow us an opportunity to express an opinion in\r\nfavour of the aspects of the draft document with which\r\nwe agreed. For the delegation of Venezuela and the\r\nvast majority of delegations represented at the\r\nAssembly there was absolutely no possibility to\r\nexpress the opinions that had been consistently\r\nexpressed during the deliberations in which we had\r\nbeen invited to participate as sovereign countries. As\r\nsovereign countries, we have exactly the same rights as\r\nevery other country in the General Assembly.\r\nMoreover, in view of all the document’s\r\nshortcomings, we could have left it pending, rather\r\nthan considering it concluded as is now being\r\nattempted, and continued the debate in order to enrich\r\nand improve it in the course of the sixtieth session of\r\nthe General Assembly. Instead of doing that and\r\npromoting a democratic and productive discussion, it\r\nwas decided from the beginning to bring the document\r\nhere. And it will now be insisted that we adopt a\r\ndocument that contains parts, which I will shortly\r\nenumerate, that will have serious consequences for the\r\ngreat majority of the nations that are Members of the\r\nAssembly. In the words of a well-known Venezuelan\r\npolitician, the Assembly will now almost certainly\r\nadopt that document under duress and while holding its\r\nnose. It seems evident that the ends have been a\r\npretext, if not a justification, for the abhorrent and anti-\r\ndemocratic means that have been utilized. This is a\r\nvery grave precedent. Nothing good awaits the\r\nOrganization if it engages in such practices.\r\nI shall be brief, as time does not permit me to\r\nspeak for as long as the situation deserves. But I should\r\nlike to cite some of the omissions, as well as some of\r\nthe issues included, in the document that should merit a\r\nvery broad-ranging, careful and in-depth debate in the\r\nAssembly.\r\nWith regard to terrorism, the document makes no\r\nreference whatever to a fact that constantly impairs the\r\nsovereignty of weak countries, namely, State terrorism.\r\nIt would seem that acts of terrorism, as condemnable as\r\nthey are, are only condemnable if they are carried out\r\nby individuals or organizations. It is as though there\r\nwere no real proven danger of State terrorism. The\r\ndocument makes no distinction between terrorist acts\r\nand the legitimate action of peoples to protect their\r\nsovereignty. This is an attempt to tie the hands of\r\ncountries that cherish their sovereignty and\r\nindependence and want to fight in defence of those\r\ninalienable principles.\r\nThe document establishes a Peacebuilding\r\nCommission. Who will be the members of the\r\norganizational committee charged with establishing\r\nthat body? They will be the Security Council, financial\r\ninstitutions and the main contributors to the\r\nOrganization. One can therefore already foresee the\r\nestablishment of a veritable monopoly and dictatorial\r\ncontrol over the exercise of the Commission’s\r\nfunctions.\r\nThe document also refers to two interrelated\r\nmatters, namely, the so-called responsibility to protect\r\nand the Human Rights Council. A reading of the\r\npertinent paragraphs in the document immediately\r\nraises the question of who is in a position to “protect”\r\n46\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nunder the terms of the document, as well as who is in a\r\nposition to send troops many thousands of miles away.\r\nWho has the financial resources, weapons and logistics\r\nto carry out actions to protect, especially given that, as\r\nI have emphasized, the concept of responsibility to\r\nprotect is related to the Human Rights Council? In that\r\nconnection, I would propose for discussion that\r\ncountries that have not ratified international human\r\nrights conventions should not be part of the Human\r\nRights Council. For it is truly inconceivable that States\r\nthat have not ratified such conventions should have any\r\ninfluence in the area of human rights.\r\nThe document also sets up the Democracy Fund.\r\nHow will it be administered? How large will it be?\r\nApart from the very generic terms used to describe it,\r\nwhat are to be its objectives? We in Venezuela have\r\nsome experience with the promotion of democracy\r\nbeing used as a pretext. There has been brazen\r\ninterference in the internal affairs of our country,\r\nincluding the financing of groups that, in the guise of\r\noperating as non-governmental organizations, have\r\nacted as political parties and have even taken part in\r\nviolent acts against the State of Venezuela. That\r\nincluded such clearly illegal acts as the coup of April\r\n2002, which, together with the oil coup, caused losses\r\nto Venezuela of approximately $20 billion in 2002\r\nalone.\r\nThe document makes absolutely no reference to\r\none of the worst threats to humankind’s future or to the\r\nuniversal and profoundly human yearning for\r\ncomprehensive and unconditional nuclear\r\ndisarmament. Today the major powers possess weapons\r\nof mass destruction capable of destroying all life on the\r\nplanet many times over. And yet there is not even the\r\nmost tepid, faint or remote reference to that very heart-\r\nfelt desire on the part of the vast majority of the\r\nworld’s people.\r\nFar from contributing to the strengthening of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, as the most basic principle and\r\nfundamental exercise of democracy would suggest, the\r\ngeneral trend is to restrict the competence of the\r\nAssembly and to increasingly concentrate power in\r\nsmall groups, such as the ones to which I have just\r\nreferred: the Human Rights Council, the Peacebuilding\r\nCommission and the Democracy Fund. In short, this\r\nrepresents an increasing and ever-more-dangerous\r\ncurtailment of the exercise of democracy in the General\r\nAssembly, which is the essential precondition for the\r\nactual empowerment that the General Assembly should\r\nenjoy. And as if that were not enough, this meeting,\r\nwhich was convened to draw up a balance sheet of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals, will not have enabled\r\nus to leave the Assembly and return to our countries\r\nwith a clear picture of the situation vis-à-vis the\r\nobligations and commitments made.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): We have heard\r\nthe only statement in explanation of position before the\r\nadoption of draft resolution A/60/L.1.\r\nWe shall now proceed to consider draft resolution\r\nA/60/L.1, entitled “2005 World Summit Outcome”. In\r\nthat connection, I would like to draw the Assembly’s\r\nattention to the statement regarding programme budget\r\nimplications contained in paragraph 14 of document\r\nA/60/355, which reads as follows:\r\n“The Fifth Committee will examine during the\r\nsixtieth session of the Assembly both a detailed\r\nstatement of the programme budget implications\r\narising from the draft resolution and the report of\r\nthe Advisory Committee on Administrative and\r\nBudgetary Questions thereon. Consequently,\r\nappropriate financial provisions will be\r\nincorporated within the budget appropriations to\r\nbe adopted before the close of the first part of the\r\nsixtieth session.”\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly wishes to adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/60/L.1, entitled “2005 World\r\nSummit Outcome”, as corrected?\r\nDraft resolution A/60/L.1, as corrected, was\r\nadopted (resolution 60/1).\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): Before giving\r\nthe floor to speakers in explanation of position\r\nfollowing the adoption of the resolution, may I remind\r\nspeakers that explanations of position are limited to 10\r\nminutes and should be made by delegations from their\r\nseats.\r\nMr. Bolton (United States of America): The\r\nUnited States of America has joined the consensus on\r\nthe adoption of the outcome document. We thank\r\nPresident Ping and President Eliasson, their staffs,\r\nfacilitators and advisers for their assistance in\r\npreparing the document. They had a difficult job. We\r\nalso thank other Member States for coming to\r\nagreement after two weeks of difficult negotiations.\r\nWe are pleased that Member States have agreed\r\nto denounce terrorism in all its forms, advance the\r\n47\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\ncause of development, reform the management of the\r\nUnited Nations, establish a Peacebuilding Commission\r\nand create a Human Rights Council.\r\nI do wish to make one point clear: the United\r\nStates understands that reference to the International\r\nConference on Population and Development, the\r\nBeijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the\r\nuse of the phrase “reproductive health” in paragraphs\r\n57 (g) and 58 (c) of the outcome document do not\r\ncreate any rights and cannot be interpreted to constitute\r\nsupport, endorsement or promotion of abortion.\r\nThe outcome document represents an important\r\nstep in a long process of United Nations reform. We\r\ncannot allow the reform effort to be derailed or to run\r\nout of steam. The United States, through its\r\nrepresentatives at the United Nations, will work\r\ntirelessly during the sixtieth session of the General\r\nAssembly and beyond to ensure that reform occurs. We\r\ncan assure you that the American people, and all\r\npeoples of the world, will be watching closely as we\r\nproceed.\r\nMr. Pérez Roque (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): The\r\nGeneral Assembly has just adopted draft resolution\r\nA/60/L.1, which contains the outcome document of the\r\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting. As the Assembly is aware,\r\nduring the closing meeting of the fifty-ninth session,\r\nCuba expressed its reservations and comments with\r\nregard to the document, which we should now like to\r\nreiterate.\r\nThe gross irregularities in the negotiating\r\nprocess — which included the imposition of terms,\r\nsecrecy, exclusion and discrimination — have now\r\nbeen compounded by the grave omissions in this\r\ndocument. We did not even include references to\r\nnuclear disarmament or general and complete\r\ndisarmament, which have been aspirations of the\r\nmajority of the international community for the last\r\nfour decades. Nor was it agreed to include concrete\r\nsteps to attempt to meet the Millennium Development\r\nGoals, which, despite their inadequacies in the face of\r\nthe serious problems currently confronting third-world\r\ncountries, seem very unlikely to be achieved by the\r\ntarget dates agreed five years ago. Concerns about\r\ndevelopment, trade, the environment and other issues\r\nof fundamental interest to most Members of the\r\nOrganization have suffered an unforgivable setback.\r\nOn the other hand, without even taking into\r\naccount the fact that the last-minute submission of 750\r\namendments jeopardized the summit, the delegation of\r\nthe United States and its closest allies insisted\r\ninordinately on the establishment of funds, councils,\r\ncommissions and controls of all sorts that, instead of\r\nstrengthening the role of the Organization, serve to\r\ndilute and distort it and to undermine the unity\r\nessential to saving the lives of the many millions of\r\npeople in the world who today suffer from poverty,\r\nhunger and ill health. In addition, under enormous\r\npressure, concepts such as the responsibility to protect\r\nand human security have been included. Those\r\nconcepts run the risk of being invoked in the future as\r\na pretext for aggression against our countries.\r\nThis has been the summit of selfishness,\r\narrogance and lies: a summit at which some have\r\nsought to present as a great achievement the increase in\r\nofficial development assistance through the\r\ncancellation of given amounts of foreign debt that\r\ndebtor countries could not have paid in any case.\r\nWhere in the document are the concrete commitments\r\nto work towards a new international order that is more\r\njust and equitable? What we have heard in the Hall\r\ninstead have been threatening and aggressive\r\nstatements, including some bordering on insult. My\r\ndelegation does not believe that we should congratulate\r\nourselves on the outcome of this meeting, and much\r\nless on the content of the outcome document.\r\nYesterday afternoon, President Hugo Chávez of\r\nthe Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela was very clear in\r\npointing out the serious problems that this\r\nOrganization, which was established to safeguard and\r\npromote peace, dignity, justice and development\r\nthroughout the world, has, and will continue to have, in\r\nfulfilling the purposes of its Charter so long as the\r\npowerful insist on preventing those whom the Charter\r\nitself defined as “We the peoples” from guiding the\r\nfuture of the United Nations. Cuba fully and\r\nunreservedly supports the words of President Chávez.\r\nNow we are facing a new stage in which we need\r\nto implement the decisions we have taken today; we\r\nbelieve that it will be a decisive one. In the new\r\nnegotiation process that lies ahead we cannot repeat the\r\nmanipulations of the past: the negotiations must be\r\ntruly open, truly democratic and participatory, and\r\nwithout any extraneous demands whatsoever. We know\r\nthat there are already delegations working to ensure\r\nthat that is not the case. Our delegation hopes,\r\nMr. President, that you will become the guarantor of\r\njustice and equity in the process that is now beginning.\r\n48\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nMr. Martynov (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): A\r\nfew minutes ago this Hall shook with applause that\r\nresounded sadly in our ears. The statements by\r\nVenezuela and Cuba reflect that sadness; we\r\nunderstand the feelings articulated by those\r\ndelegations.\r\nThe Charter of our Organization opens with the\r\nwords “We the peoples of the United Nations”, but has\r\nthe document we have just adopted really brought our\r\nnations and peoples together? I am afraid the answer to\r\nthat is clear to all of us. Does that document strengthen\r\nthe fundamental freedoms of States to chose their path\r\nto development on the basis of United Nations\r\nprinciples and objectives? Does it strengthen and\r\ndevelop the instruments that the community of nations\r\nneeds to achieve the Millennium Development Goals?\r\nDoes it arm us with the weapons we need to defend the\r\ndefenceless? I am afraid that the answers to those\r\nquestions are equally clear.\r\nHaving adopted the outcome document, the\r\nRepublic of Belarus appeals to all delegations to\r\ncontinue to work to bring together all States — large\r\nand small, weak and powerful — to achieve the\r\npurposes of the Charter and the Millennium\r\nDeclaration.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): We have heard\r\nthe last speaker in explanation of position.\r\nI now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. El\r\nHadj Omar Bongo Ondimba, President of the Gabonese\r\nRepublic and Co-Chairperson of the High-level\r\nPlenary Meeting.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Gabon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): Our work has culminated in the adoption of\r\nthe World Summit Outcome document of the High-\r\nlevel Plenary Meeting and that is good reason for us to\r\nbe pleased. That declaration reminds us that the threats\r\nand challenges facing the world require a collective\r\nunderstanding and a collective response.\r\nThe United Nations is both the bedrock of and the\r\nindispensable tool for building an effective multilateral\r\nsystem. We must continue to pursue its reform to\r\nensure that the Organization is managed in a more\r\nmodern way, better suited to its many missions. We\r\nmust also continue our efforts to revitalize the General\r\nAssembly and, of course, the Security Council. Today\r\nmillions of people throughout the world are looking to\r\nus; the multilateral solidarity embodied in the United\r\nNations offers their one and only hope. Let us find a\r\nway to make the next 60 years of the United Nations an\r\nera of prosperity, peace, and justice for all the peoples\r\nof the world.\r\nI now give the floor to the His Excellency\r\nMr. Göran Persson, Prime Minister of Sweden and Co-\r\nChairperson of the High-level Plenary Meeting.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): During the\r\ndebate at this world summit, leaders from around the\r\nworld have reaffirmed their strong commitment to\r\ninternational cooperation as the tool for meeting global\r\nchallenges. Indeed, our commitment to the United\r\nNations and its Charter has been clearly illustrated by\r\nour gathering here in such great numbers.\r\nTonight we have adopted the World Summit\r\nOutcome, a document that takes decisive steps to\r\nstrengthen the United Nations and the collective\r\nsecurity system. It also reaffirms our commitment to\r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015.\r\nThe Millennium Development Goals give us hope\r\nfor a better future, but the political message that\r\nemerged from our debate is clear: we need to redouble\r\nour efforts. Additional resources must be mobilized\r\nand more forceful measures must be taken. We owe\r\nthat to the millions of men, women and children who\r\nsuffer from diseases that could be cured, from conflicts\r\nthat could be prevented and from hunger that could be\r\nalleviated.\r\nNegotiations to address future action on climate\r\nchange will continue at the global level in order to\r\nreduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and stop\r\nhuman interference with the climate system.\r\nWe urgently need to conclude a comprehensive\r\nconvention and agree on a strategy to counter\r\ninternational terrorism, one of the most serious threats\r\nto international peace and security.\r\nWe have decided to establish a Peacebuilding\r\nCommission to help countries emerging from conflict\r\nto lay the necessary foundation for lasting peace and\r\nsustainable development.\r\nWe will create a Human Rights Council to\r\npromote respect for human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms for all. And we have decided to double the\r\nregular resources allocated to strengthen the Office of\r\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Human\r\n49\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nRights and to further mainstream human rights\r\nthroughout the United Nations system.\r\nThe prospect that weapons of mass destruction\r\nwill once again be used is terrifying. We cannot afford\r\nto let that happen. Our failure to address at this summit\r\nthe threat presented by those weapons leaves us with a\r\ncrucial task ahead. States need to stand by their\r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation commitments and,\r\nmost urgently, we need to breathe new life into\r\nmultilateral regimes for managing such weapons. We\r\nhave taken good decisions to strengthen the efficiency,\r\neffectiveness and accountability of the United Nations\r\nSecretariat. I have heard many voices calling for a\r\nSecretariat fit for the challenges of the twenty-first\r\ncentury. We will follow with keen interest the\r\nimplementation of the measures spelled out in the\r\nSummit Outcome.\r\nTrue political leadership is about both words and\r\ndeeds. Over the last few days, we have heard the\r\nwords. As Co-Chairperson of this High-level Meeting,\r\nI very much appreciate what I have heard in this great\r\nHall. On some issues, views have differed. On others,\r\nconsensus has been reached. That is not surprising.\r\nNeither is it a problem. Instead, it shows that the\r\nUnited Nations is a relevant, vibrant body for debate\r\non the issues that concern all of us today. That is\r\nexactly the United Nations we need and want.\r\nLater tonight, this High-level Meeting will close,\r\nbut our work is only just beginning. After the words\r\nhave been spoken comes the time for deeds. The\r\nmomentum created in this Hall must be maintained for\r\nthe months and years ahead. I urge all political leaders\r\nto remain personally committed in order to ensure that\r\nthe decisions we have taken tonight will turn into\r\nreality. This summit should be seen as a starting point\r\nfor the reform process. I can assure you of my own\r\npersonal commitment as well as that of Sweden and of\r\ncourse that of Ambassador Jan Eliasson to this cause,\r\nin his capacity as President of the General Assembly.\r\nLet us join forces in making the sixtieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations a year of change. We\r\nowe it to our citizens. We owe it to coming\r\ngenerations. We owe it to ourselves.\r\nWe shall now continue with the remaining\r\nspeakers for the High-level Plenary Meeting.\r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by His\r\nExcellency Mr. Amre Moussa, Secretary General of the\r\nLeague of Arab States, delivered on his behalf by His\r\nExcellency Mr. Yahya Mahmassani, Permanent\r\nObserver of the League of Arab States.\r\nMr. Mahmassani (League of Arab States) (spoke\r\nin Arabic): Allow me to read out a statement on behalf\r\nof the Secretary-General of the League of Arab States,\r\nMr. Amre Moussa.\r\n“I should like first to express my\r\nappreciation to Mr. Jean Ping, President of the\r\nfifty-ninth session of the General Assembly, for\r\nhis tireless efforts to prepare the draft summit\r\noutcome document (A/60/L.1). It is a document\r\nthat awakens hopes and provides for reform in\r\naccordance with current international interests\r\nand international consensus. In any case, it is a\r\nstarting point, although it does not meet all the\r\nexpectations of a world yearning for stability,\r\nprogress, justice and peace.\r\n“I also want to welcome Mr. Jan Eliasson,\r\nPresident of the sixtieth session of the General\r\nAssembly. We are convinced that this able\r\nSwedish diplomat will lead the deliberations of\r\nthis historic session to complete success.\r\n“This is not the first time that I am\r\naddressing the General Assembly, having already\r\nhad the honour of doing so on a number of\r\noccasions, most recently at the Millennium\r\nSummit, which proposed a global plan of action\r\nfor a more just and more equitable world. But this\r\nis the first time that I am addressing the\r\nAssembly as Secretary-General of the League of\r\nArab States.\r\n“It is very significant that our gathering\r\ntoday coincides with the sixtieth anniversary of\r\nthe United Nations and the sixtieth anniversary of\r\nthe League of Arab States: 60 years of\r\ncoordination and cooperation between the\r\ngreatest of international organizations and the\r\noldest regional organization; 60 years of creative\r\ninteraction during which we have experienced\r\ntogether the same events and met the same\r\nchallenges and have worked together to make this\r\ninternational Organization one that works\r\ntowards new prospects of freedom and prosperity\r\nwithout exclusion or discrimination.\r\n“The draft outcome document emphasizes\r\nthe need to reach agreement on collective\r\n50\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nsolutions to major issues related to stability in the\r\nworld, especially in the areas of development,\r\npeace, collective security, human rights, the rule\r\nof law and the strengthening of the United\r\nNations. This is a commitment on the part of us\r\nall, States and regional and international\r\norganizations alike.\r\n“That is why the commitment of the League\r\nof Arab States within this framework is a legal\r\nand moral commitment which I reiterate before\r\nthe Assembly. I pledge to work towards the\r\nattainment of that objective and to ensure that my\r\nregional organization truly contributes to it.\r\n“When the Secretary-General appeals to all\r\nleaders of the world to support and implement the\r\nreform programme, as he did in this Hall, the\r\nLeague of Arab States, as a regional organization\r\ndedicated to promoting collective development\r\nand political action, understands the value of\r\ncollective endeavour and commitments in this\r\ncontext.\r\n“The content of the draft outcome document\r\nregarding the role of regional organizations and\r\nthe strengthening of that role in accordance with\r\nChapter VIII of the Charter opens new prospects\r\nfor collective endeavour at the regional and\r\ninternational levels to make the reform agenda\r\nsuccessful, thereby ushering in a better future for\r\nhumankind.\r\n“I should like to raise a few points that we\r\nhope will have an effect on our working\r\nprocedures, with a view to the implementation of\r\nthe contents of this historic document.\r\n“The first point is that the reform to which\r\nwe all fervently aspire must be a real practical\r\nreform — a comprehensive reform — that is\r\naimed at regulating relations among nations in\r\nconformity with the purposes and principles of\r\nthe Charter. I have no doubt that reform is of\r\nconsensual interest to all of us, just as I have no\r\ndoubt that we all agree that the concept of\r\ndemocracy is our principal objective.\r\n“But I believe that national and\r\ninternational policy reform are two sides of the\r\nsame coin. Democratic international relations are\r\nthe underpinning of democratic national policies;\r\nthat means that the United Nations must have a\r\nleadership role in democratic practice among\r\nnations, which requires support for the proposed\r\nreforms, as contained in the outcome document\r\nand stressed by the Secretary-General.\r\n“That is why the role and position of the\r\nGeneral Assembly is vital. The General Assembly\r\nis from any democratic perspective the legislative\r\nbody par excellence in this Organization — hence\r\nthe United Nations must ensure follow-up of all\r\nthe other subsidiary bodies that may be created in\r\nfuture.\r\n“The second point I should like to make is\r\nthat the reform we want for the United Nations is\r\nthe result of a historic process to which the Third\r\nWorld has contributed in terms of demands and\r\npositions. This has been made concrete in\r\ncollective responsibility and in the reaffirmation\r\nof multilateral diplomacy and the need to work by\r\nconsensus on all aspects relating to the future of\r\nour world.\r\n“I believe that the collective negotiations\r\nthat have led to this document contain a clear\r\nmessage, and that is that the world needs to be\r\nguided collectively so that the international\r\ncommunity can commit itself to implementing all\r\nthe recommendations made and decisions taken.\r\n“What we seek today is a commitment\r\nbased on conviction not on pressure, coercion or\r\nassumptions. This is closely related to the\r\ncredibility crisis prevailing with respect to the\r\nUnited Nations. We all agree that we cannot\r\nresolve international crises if reform does not\r\nreflect the will of the international community, as\r\nexpressed through negotiation and consensus.\r\n“This brings me to my third point, which is\r\nthat the desired reform must be comprehensive\r\nand integrated. To reform some aspects without\r\nreforming others can only lead to an imbalance in\r\nour system’s structure and performance. This is\r\nsomething that we have long known, and we have\r\nworked towards comprehensive reform within the\r\nLeague of Arab States: reform of its instruments\r\nand its working methods, the creation of new\r\ninstitutions such as the Arab Parliament, which\r\nreflects relations among peoples and which\r\nallows civil society to participate fully and\r\neffectively. I mention this model because I am\r\nconvinced that reform of the United Nations and\r\n51\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nof regional organizations must be consistent.\r\nReform of one goes hand in hand with reform of\r\nothers, and regional organizations can provide\r\nreal support to the United Nations in its\r\nendeavours to maintain international peace and\r\nsecurity and to achieve economic and social\r\ndevelopment worldwide. That is clearly reflected\r\nin recent resolutions adopted by the Arab States.\r\n“I am certain that we all agree that reform,\r\nany reform, is an ongoing, indivisible process.\r\nThe eradication of poverty cannot be achieved\r\nwithout sustainable development; development\r\ncannot be achieved without security; and security\r\ncannot be achieved if we do not struggle against\r\nterrorism, violence, war and foreign occupation.\r\nThe eradication of all of those scourges can be\r\nachieved only through the rule of law, and this, in\r\nturn, can be accomplished only in the framework\r\nof a just and equitable international system.\r\n“I believe that, with this document, we are\r\nmaking progress in that direction. That is the very\r\nphilosophy of the Charter — a philosophy that\r\nmust be preserved, just as we must safeguard the\r\nCharter itself and its principles, which relate to\r\nthe very future and progress of nations and\r\npeoples.\r\n“The Arab delegations to the United\r\nNations made a constructive contribution to the\r\nfinal document because they are aware of the\r\nmajor challenges that we are confronting and\r\nbecause they want the Organization to be\r\npreserved and reformed in order to ensure an\r\neffective and equitable international system. Real\r\nand balanced reform of the United Nations must\r\nbe a principal step in the reform of the entire\r\ninternational system, and I am certain that\r\nreform, in the broader sense, is a requirement, not\r\njust an option.”\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): I give the floor\r\nto Mrs. Benita Ferrero-Waldner, member of the\r\nEuropean Commission.\r\nMs. Ferrero-Waldner (European Commission):\r\nStanding here, facing this great Hall, brings back\r\nhappy memories of my previous work here. But today I\r\nam speaking in my current capacity as European\r\nCommissioner for External relations, and, from this\r\nvantage point, on behalf of the European community, I\r\nwelcome the promising results of this meeting.\r\nPresident Ping and his team have been untiring in\r\npushing for this worthwhile outcome, and none of it\r\nwould have been possible without Secretary-General\r\nKofi Annan’s leadership and vision. The European\r\ncommunity is happy that we were able, together with\r\nmany others, to contribute to that outcome.\r\nHow do we now see the results? Do they meet\r\nour original aspirations? Not everything has been\r\nattained. Compromises were inevitable, but we have\r\nlaid a solid foundation as we seek to rebuild the United\r\nNations so as to enable it to meet the challenges of the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nDevelopment, security and human rights are\r\nindeed the three pillars of our common vision of the\r\nfuture. But how do we measure up against that vision?\r\nWhen it comes to development assistance, the\r\nEuropean Union leads the world. From the outset, we\r\nhave led the efforts to increase this assistance to 0.7\r\nper cent of gross national income by 2015. We have set\r\nfor ourselves an intermediate goal of 0.56 per cent by\r\n2010. We very much hope to see other donors follow\r\nour lead and to see our partner countries, with our\r\nsupport, make a serious effort to reinforce good\r\ngovernance.\r\nTrade is also key to development. The European\r\ncommunity remains firmly committed to making a\r\nsuccess of the World Trade Organization (WTO)\r\nnegotiations, including by the elimination of expert\r\nsubsidies.\r\nOur serious offer made earlier this year still\r\nstands. We hope that others will follow with similar\r\ncommitments on export as well as domestic subsidies.\r\nThe European Community’s “Everything But Arms”\r\ninitiative has been in place for more than three years,\r\nand it is time that others follow. The European\r\nCommunity this summer pledged to increase our\r\nassistance for trade capacity-building still further to €1\r\nbillion a year.\r\nEven in the wake of Katrina and the tsunami, we\r\nhave not focused enough attention on the environment.\r\nClimate change and environmental sustainability have\r\nto be taken as seriously as they deserve. In that\r\nperspective, will it be enough to just explore the\r\npotential of the current institutional set-up? We believe\r\nthat we should continue to work towards creating a\r\nstrong, functional, action-oriented United Nations\r\nenvironmental organization.\r\n52\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nLet me say that the European Community\r\nwelcomes and strongly supports the initiative of\r\nPresident Bush concerning the looming danger of avian\r\nflu’s becoming a pandemic.\r\nAgreeing on a peacebuilding commission is\r\nwithout doubt one key result in the area of peace and\r\nsecurity. We must now ensure that it begins its work by\r\nthe end of this year. The European Community has\r\nlong-standing experience in helping to stabilize\r\ncountries emerging from conflicts in all possible\r\ncorners of the world — from the Balkans to Indonesia,\r\nfrom Afghanistan to Africa. We look forward to taking\r\nan appropriate place at the table, side by side with\r\nother key institutional donors.\r\nAnother important outcome is our recognition of\r\nour collective responsibility to protect populations\r\nagainst atrocities. I have always strongly advocated\r\nthat people must be at the heart of security concerns.\r\nThe United Nations credibility is therefore much\r\nreinforced by adopting that concept.\r\nHuman rights are universal, and putting them on\r\nthe same level as development, peace and security\r\nunderscores that fact. The Commission on Human\r\nRights has lost its ability to act effectively on behalf of\r\nvictims, and thus its credibility. Forming a new, smaller\r\nand more functional human rights council will help the\r\nUnited Nations become a real driving force behind\r\nhuman rights protection. I confess being disappointed\r\nat the meagre outcome in the summit document, which\r\ndoes not meet our ambitions. Let us not lose the\r\nmomentum, therefore, and let us finish this important\r\nchapter by February 2006. I express our full confidence\r\nin President Eliasson’s leadership to fulfil that mandate\r\nbefore us.\r\nFinally, let me say a word on United Nations\r\nmanagement reform, where we also have not come as\r\nfar as we would have liked. The Secretary-General\r\nshoulders an awesome responsibility, yet it is not\r\nalways clear that he has the necessary authority over\r\nthe administration to deliver.\r\nEffective multilateralism is the hallmark of the\r\nEuropean Union’s external policy. The United Nations\r\nsystem is its cornerstone. Let me pledge today that we\r\nwill do everything in our power to ensure that the\r\nUnited Nations will be a lean, fit and energetic\r\nOrganization for the twenty-first century.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, Secretary General of the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference.\r\nMr. Ihsanoglu (Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference): It gives me great pleasure to address this\r\nAssembly on behalf of the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference (OIC) as the General Assembly, five years\r\nafter the adoption of the Millennium Declaration,\r\npauses to review the state of affairs of the world in\r\ngeneral, and the achievements realized in\r\nimplementing the Millennium Development Goals in\r\nparticular.\r\nToday, five years after the Millennium Summit,\r\nmany developing countries perceive that the political\r\nwill to forge ahead in implementing what was agreed\r\nupon is not vigorous. Looking at that matter from the\r\nMuslim world’s vantage point, and despite our sincere\r\nintentions to take comfort from the promising\r\nobjectives enshrined in the Millennium Declaration, we\r\nin the Muslim world are still awaiting and hoping to\r\nsee a better world.\r\nDespite the prevalence of the lofty principles of\r\nrespect for human rights and the supremacy of the rule\r\nof law, international law and international humanitarian\r\nlaw, and at a time when the issues of people’s right to\r\nself-determination have almost been settled, the\r\nMuslim world finds itself still exposed to numerous\r\ninjustices, violations of rights and campaigns of\r\ndefamation.\r\nAt the same time, we are fully aware of the fact\r\nthat the OIC member States should do more in the\r\nprocess of implementing the Millennium Development\r\nGoals. I would like to emphasize that defamation\r\ncampaigns are still being waged and have even\r\nintensified against Muslims and Islam itself. The\r\ngrowing phenomenon of Islamophobia is the best\r\nexample of that trend. We hope that the idea of\r\ntransforming the present Commission on Human\r\nRights into a human rights council will help to uphold\r\nour rights.\r\nIn the face of that situation, we in the OIC are\r\nmaking every effort to deal with that reality in the\r\ninterests of global harmony and peace. The leaders of\r\nthe Muslim world will hold an extraordinary summit in\r\nMecca to consider the situation. The OIC general\r\nsecretariat is also pursuing a process of overhauling the\r\norganization, rewriting its charter and objectives with\r\n53\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nthe aim of bringing its activities into the mainstream of\r\nthe concerns of the international community, especially\r\nin the field of social development, and contributing to\r\ninternational cooperation with concrete projects.\r\nRepresenting 57 Muslim countries and the\r\nIslamic world at large, the OIC rejects and condemns\r\nviolence and terrorism. We note, however, that the\r\nglobal war on terrorism has yielded no convincing\r\nresults because it has focused mainly on military\r\nmeans. What is needed, we believe, is to address the\r\nroot causes of terrorism, using the art of persuasion\r\nthrough local approaches while resorting to diplomacy\r\nand financial and economic measures, and encouraging\r\nmoderate trends.\r\nI would like here to emphasize, in that regard,\r\nthat the sanctity of life is one of the paramount values\r\nof Islam and that terrorism is a heretical deviation from\r\nour religion. We believe that the frequent placing of the\r\nepithet “Islamic” before “terrorism” is a sacrilege.\r\nMoreover, it is highly dangerous. We should be careful\r\nnot to create a perception that might lead to bitter\r\nenmity, based on religious grounds, between hundreds\r\nof millions of people.\r\nMuslims around the world have never been under\r\nsuch pressure and intensive scrutiny. What we need is a\r\nconcerted effort to quell that phenomenon through\r\ngreater understanding and in an open, critical and\r\ntranscultural dialogue among all civilizations. On the\r\nother hand, we share the view of the many who are\r\ncalling for the democratization of the United Nations\r\nsystem, and especially the composition of the\r\nmembership of the Security Council. The United\r\nNations reforms should take into consideration the\r\nrepresentation of the Muslim world and the realities of\r\nthe contemporary world.\r\nThe OIC member States have endorsed the eight\r\nMillennium Development Goals that are to be achieved\r\nby 2015. We hope that we will be able to meet this\r\ntarget. We also support the idea of repositioning the\r\nEconomic and Social Council in order to enhance its\r\neffectiveness in dealing with the new challenges of\r\neconomic and social development in the world, thus\r\nushering in an era of greater social justice and a more\r\ndemocratic world order.\r\nIn conclusion, at a moment when our world\r\nstands at the crossroads of a promising future, or a\r\nthreatened one, let us not miss the opportunity being\r\noffered by this high-level forum of nations of striving\r\nto save humanity from the ravages of poverty, illiteracy\r\nand social disintegration. Let future generations\r\nremember this moment as a time when world leaders\r\nrose to the occasion to lay the foundation for a healthy\r\nand progressive global village; this remains our\r\ndestination in the new millennium. In achieving this\r\ngoal, I pledge the fullest cooperation and partnership of\r\nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference in the times\r\nahead.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Anders\r\nJohnsson, Secretary-General of the Inter-Parliamentary\r\nUnion (IPU), who will speak on behalf of the World\r\nConference of Speakers of Parliaments of the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union.\r\nMr. Johnsson (Inter-Parliamentary Union): The\r\nPresident of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU),\r\nSenator Sergio Paez Verdugo, regrets very much that\r\npressing political engagements in his country, Chile,\r\nprevent him from being with you today. At his request,\r\nI therefore have the honour to report on the outcome of\r\nthe Second World Conference of Speakers of\r\nParliaments.\r\nDuring three days last week, more than 150\r\nspeakers of parliaments met in this very Hall to discuss\r\nthe growing role of parliaments in the work of the\r\nUnited Nations. They came with the intention of\r\ngalvanizing that role into a new strategic partnership\r\nbetween the United Nations and parliaments and\r\npledged to build political momentum for reform of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nWe have made available copies of the declaration\r\nadopted by the speakers at the close of their\r\nproceedings, the result of a long and careful process\r\nthat included extensive consultations with parliaments\r\naround the world. The document is short and to the\r\npoint, built around a single, focused message, which is\r\nthat parliaments have an essential role to play to bridge\r\nthe democracy gap in international relations.\r\nThe declaration takes up the subject of United\r\nNations reform. The text does not mince words.\r\nParliamentarians want to see the reform proposals\r\ndebated, and they want to see their Governments acting\r\non them now, not in five or ten years from now. They\r\nwant reform, and they want it to be comprehensive.\r\nReforms must recognize the intrinsic link between\r\ndemocracy, security, development and human rights.\r\n54\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nThe declaration calls for change and political\r\naction to achieve the Millennium Development Goals\r\n(MDGs) and to identify additional financial resources\r\nfor development. It also calls for the conclusion of a\r\ncomprehensive treaty on terrorism, with a clear\r\ndefinition of terrorism, and real advances in nuclear\r\ndisarmament, non-proliferation and arms control\r\nissues. Frankly speaking, the stakes are too high for the\r\npresent impasse to be allowed to continue. The text\r\nalso reaffirms that the promotion and protection of\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms for all are\r\nessential for development, peace and security.\r\nThe Speakers of Parliament want to see a stronger\r\nUnited Nations. They call on States, including their\r\nparliaments, to demonstrate leadership and political\r\nwill to provide the United Nations with more efficient\r\nmechanisms, appropriate human and financial\r\nresources and real management reform.\r\nOver the past year, stimulated by the Cardoso\r\nPanel’s report (A/58/817), many parliaments have\r\ndiscussed how best to organize cooperation between\r\nparliaments and the United Nations. The conclusions of\r\nthose debates are also reflected in the declaration. It\r\naffirms that parliaments in all countries have a\r\nconstitutional role to represent the will of the people\r\nand, on their behalf, adopt laws, including the national\r\nbudgets and overseeing the Government. This\r\nresponsibility is carried out at home, but it includes a\r\nresponsibility to follow closely the multitude of\r\ninternational negotiations that take place in multilateral\r\nforums.\r\nParliaments want to make sure that they are well\r\ninformed of those negotiations, that they have an\r\nopportunity to debate what is being negotiated, that\r\nthey can question ministers and influence the\r\nnegotiating positions they are advancing on behalf of\r\ntheir people. And, once negotiations have concluded, it\r\nis for the parliaments to ratify agreements and see to\r\ntheir implementation. This involves amending or\r\nadopting legislation, voting on budgets and, of course,\r\nholding Governments to account as far as\r\nimplementation is concerned.\r\nThe declaration adds that parliaments should\r\nincrease their international work in partnership with\r\nthe IPU, which they consider to be a unique global\r\nparliamentary counterpart of the United Nations. The\r\nSpeakers of Parliament are not in support of the\r\ncreation of new parliamentary assemblies at the United\r\nNations or elsewhere. Rather, they want the IPU to\r\nmobilize expertise, which exists in parliamentary\r\nstanding and select committees, and to work on issues\r\non the international agenda. They want the IPU to\r\nfacilitate the provision of more and better information\r\nto national parliaments on the activities of the United\r\nNations. They want us to stage more parliamentary\r\nhearings and specialized meetings at the United\r\nNations, and they want us to stimulate and cooperate\r\nmore closely with official regional parliamentary\r\nassemblies and organizations.\r\nActing in this manner, parliaments and the IPU\r\nseek to strengthen the United Nations, assist in\r\nimplementing decisions taken there and hold it\r\naccountable to the people it serves throughout the\r\nworld. All of this represents a large agenda for\r\nparliaments and for the IPU.\r\nThe Speakers came to New York with a\r\ncommitment from their respective parliaments to put it\r\ninto effect. They are now turning to participants in this\r\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly,\r\nto seek their commitment and support for turning this\r\nagenda into a reality, including by making it possible\r\nfor all members of parliaments to come to New York\r\nfor meetings we organize at the United Nations.\r\nIn conclusion, the principle that problems must\r\nbe solved through dialogue represents the cornerstone\r\nof both democracy and the United Nations. The\r\nSpeakers of Parliament invite the Assembly to build on\r\nthat foundation to construct a strategic partnership\r\nbetween the United Nations and parliaments, through\r\nthe Inter-Parliamentary Union.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by Mr. Zhang Deguang,\r\nSecretary-General of the Shanghai Cooperation\r\nOrganization.\r\nMr. Zhang Deguang (Shanghai Cooperation\r\nOrganization) (spoke in Chinese): I am grateful for this\r\nopportunity to address the Assembly. This is the first\r\ntime that a representative of the Shanghai Cooperation\r\nOrganization (SCO) has spoken from this rostrum.\r\nAllow me, on behalf of all the member States and\r\nobserver States of the SCO, to extend our warmest\r\ncongratulations on the sixtieth anniversary of the\r\nfounding of the United Nations. I hope that this High-\r\nlevel Meeting will achieve many fruitful results.\r\n55\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nSince its creation, the United Nations has been\r\nworking to fulfil humankind’s most cherished dream —\r\nnamely, that the tragedy of war should never be\r\nrepeated and that the sun of peace could always shine\r\non the world. On numerous occasions in the past the\r\nAssembly has heard strong appeals and genuine calls\r\nfor peace from many countries. This Hall has been the\r\nscene of great efforts and outstanding contributions by\r\nthe United Nations to the cause of safeguarding peace.\r\nTremendous changes have taken place in today’s\r\nworld; humankind has left behind an era of war and\r\npeace and has entered a new era of peace and\r\ndevelopment. Nevertheless, the United Nations\r\ncontinues to play an irreplaceable role in international\r\naffairs today. The fundamental principles enshrined in\r\nthe United Nations Charter remain an indisputable\r\ncornerstone of modern international relations.\r\nUpholding the central role and the authority of the\r\nUnited Nations remains a common responsibility and\r\nmission of the international community.\r\nIt goes without saying that the United Nations\r\nalso needs to carry out rational and necessary reforms\r\nin order to respond more effectively to the new\r\nsituations, challenges and threats of the globalized\r\nworld, and to more effectively accomplish the difficult\r\ntask of promoting world peace and development. In\r\nreforming the United Nations, we must respect the\r\nprinciple of achieving broad consensus. No timetable\r\nshould be set for United Nations reform. And no vote\r\nshould be forced on controversial draft resolutions.\r\nCompared to the 60-year history of the United\r\nNations, the history of the Shanghai Cooperation\r\nOrganization (SCO) has just begun. Four years ago in\r\nthe city of Shanghai, the leaders of Kazakhstan, China,\r\nKyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan\r\nannounced the birth of this new organization of\r\nregional cooperation.\r\nThe SCO is committed to strengthening good-\r\nneighbourly relations, mutual trust and friendship\r\namong its member States; enhancing member States’\r\ncooperation on the economy, trade, transport, energy,\r\ntourism, environmental protection and humanitarian\r\naffairs; combating terrorism, separatism and\r\nextremism; safeguarding peace, security and stability\r\nin the region; and promoting the creation of a\r\ndemocratic, just and rational international political and\r\neconomic order. Internally, the SCO is guided by the\r\nspirit of Shanghai, based on mutual trust, mutual\r\nbenefit, equality, mutual consultations, respect for the\r\ndiversity of cultures and the aspiration of joint\r\ndevelopment. Externally, the SCO observes the\r\nprinciples of openness and non-alignment and stands\r\nagainst the targeting of other States and regions.\r\nWithin a short period of several years, the SCO\r\nhas basically completed its work on mechanism-\r\nbuilding and has achieved noticeable progress in\r\nvarious fields and on establishing external ties. A\r\nrecent summit in Astana outlined strategic plans for the\r\nSCO’s further development. And, following the\r\nadmission of Mongolia as an observer State of the\r\nSCO, Pakistan, Iran and India were accepted as new\r\nobservers. We are pleased to note that the purposes and\r\nthe principles of the SCO have received broad\r\nrecognition and that the SCO is now moving towards\r\nits fifth anniversary with confidence and determination.\r\nIn December 2004, the SCO was granted observer\r\nstatus at the General Assembly. That signalled a good\r\nstart in establishing our cooperation with the United\r\nNations. The SCO has already established close ties\r\nand cooperative relations with the Economic and\r\nSocial Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the United\r\nNations Development Programme and other United\r\nNations agencies. The SCO has also signed\r\nmemorandums of understanding with the Association\r\nof Southeast Asian Nations and the Commonwealth of\r\nIndependent States. We are ready to expand our\r\ncooperative ties with more international organizations\r\nin order to make a joint contribution to peace and\r\ndevelopment in our region and in the world.\r\nThe Shanghai Cooperation Organization\r\nrepresents an area which has a population of nearly 1.5\r\nbillion people and covers three fifths of the Eurasian\r\ncontinent. We are very aware of our responsibilities,\r\nand we are ready to carry out that historic mission with\r\ngreat courage.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): I now call on\r\nMr. Achim Steiner, Director General of the\r\nInternational Union for the Conservation of Nature and\r\nNatural Resources.\r\nMr. Steiner (International Union for the\r\nConservation of Nature and Natural Resources): Before\r\nI begin my prepared remarks, I would like to express\r\nmy delegation’s sympathies to the Government and the\r\npeople of the United States in the wake of Hurricane\r\nKatrina. The worldwide outpouring of sympathy and\r\nsupport following both the tsunami and now Hurricane\r\n56\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nKatrina demonstrated the united voice of humanity and\r\nindeed serves as a reminder and a sign of solidarity\r\nwith so many people who have died in recent months\r\nas a result of natural disasters.\r\nFive years ago, in this very Hall, the assembled\r\nworld leaders adopted an ambitious set of targets and\r\ngoals to promote peace and prosperity. Five years later,\r\nwe must acknowledge that the pace of progress\r\ntowards meeting those goals is too slow. We must\r\nredouble our efforts and refocus our approaches.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General entitled “In\r\nlarger freedom”, the foundation for our deliberations\r\nhere today, boldly declares that\r\n“We fundamentally depend on natural\r\nsystems and resources for our existence and\r\ndevelopment. Our efforts to defeat poverty and\r\npursue sustainable development will be in vain if\r\nenvironmental degradation and natural resource\r\ndepletion continue unabated.” (A/59/2005, para. 57)\r\nThat bold declaration is supported by the findings\r\nof the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, a\r\ncomprehensive assessment of the state of the planet’s\r\necosystems by nearly 1,400 leading experts from 95\r\ncountries. It finds that\r\n“The loss of services derived from\r\necosystems is a significant barrier to the\r\nachievement of the Millennium Development\r\nGoals to reduce poverty, hunger, and disease.”\r\n(Living Beyond Our Means, p. 2)\r\nThat stark message was echoed by the\r\nMillennium Project, which declared that integrating the\r\nprinciples and practices of environmental sustainability\r\ninto country policies and planning programmes is\r\ntherefore key to successful poverty reduction\r\nstrategies.\r\nThe International Union for the Conservation of\r\nNature and Natural Resources — the World\r\nConservation Union — welcomes the outcome\r\ndocument for its comprehensive treatment of nearly all\r\nthe major issues currently on the multilateral agenda.\r\nYet, like many who have spoken before me, we are\r\ndisappointed that it could not go further.\r\nOn the one hand, the outcome document reaffirms\r\nthe essential importance of sustainable development as\r\npart of the overarching framework for the United\r\nNations, and it addresses the crucial role of\r\nconservation, sustainable development and the\r\nmanagement of natural resources in eradicating poverty\r\nand in achieving the other Millennium Development\r\nGoals.\r\nHowever, on the other hand, the outcome\r\ndocument fails to appreciate how much we still have to\r\ndo to achieve environmental sustainability and, indeed,\r\nall the other Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).\r\nFifteen of the 24 essential services provided by the\r\necosystems we have at our disposal — ranging from\r\nfood production to water quality and availability,\r\ndisease management and climate regulation — are\r\nbeing used unsustainably and are persistently eroded.\r\nThis situation requires an urgent response. We\r\nmust ensure that the United Nations, civil society and\r\nthe private sector nurture and maintain the\r\nenvironmental foundation of sustainable livelihoods.\r\nAllow me to note that in some ways it is a shame\r\nthat civil society and the private sector could not take\r\npart in this summit in a more active way and that they\r\nhave been reduced to holding events in hotels and on\r\nthe street around the summit, because their role in\r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals are so\r\ncentral to the objectives of the United Nations.\r\nRather than being a tax on development,\r\ninvesting in environmental sustainability should be\r\nseen as an effective and efficient means to achieve\r\ndevelopment. To cite just one example, replacing the\r\ntraditional biomass fuels used by the poor yields\r\nmultiple benefits in terms of time savings for women\r\nand children, improved health through reduced indoor\r\nair pollution, reduced environmental damage from the\r\ncutting of fuel wood and improved soil quality. This\r\nmay seem a simple technological issue, but it affects\r\nmany more than 2 billion people on our planet every day.\r\nFor our part, the World Conservation Union will\r\ncontinue to support the multilateral process with all our\r\nenergy and will therefore support the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals by bringing the best knowledge\r\nand science available to decision-making today.\r\nWe also pledge to work with the Poverty-\r\nEnvironment Partnership and our 1,072 government\r\nand non-government members in the World\r\nConservation Union to make conservation work more\r\neffectively for the poor. This week, we announced our\r\nConservation for Poverty Reduction initiative, a $300\r\nmillion plan of worldwide action with more than 100\r\n57\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\npartner organizations, which will target, along with\r\nconservation, improved livelihood security for 50\r\nmillion people in 20 countries.\r\nThis initiative is only one more stride and one\r\nmore contribution in the race to achieve the MDGs by\r\n2015, to eradicate poverty and to ensure sustainable\r\nlivelihoods.\r\nWhen we refer to the environment, we should\r\nremember that we are not talking about one sector.\r\nWhen we refer to the environment, we should note that\r\nit means tourism. When we refer to the environment,\r\nwe mean agriculture. When we refer to the\r\nenvironment, we mean fisheries — and energy, and\r\nforestry, and health and water and sanitation, to\r\nmention just some examples of what the environment\r\nreally stands for. People are the target of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nIn order to make poverty history, we need to\r\nmake the environment the future.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): I call on\r\nMr. Terry Davis, Secretary General of the Council of\r\nEurope.\r\nMr. Davis (Council of Europe): I shall abbreviate\r\nmy statement in view of the lateness of the hour.\r\nI stand before the General Assembly as the\r\nSecretary General of the Council of Europe — an\r\nintergovernmental organization of 46 member States.\r\nWe have been working with the United Nations for\r\nmore than half a century, as partners in promoting\r\npeace and justice. The United Nations and the Council\r\nof Europe share the same goals. The ideals,  values and\r\nprinciples of the Council of Europe are those enshrined\r\nin the Charter of the United Nations. That is why the\r\nheads of State or Government of the 46 States members\r\nof the Council of Europe, at our Summit in May,\r\nencouraged the Council of Europe to step up\r\ncooperation with the United Nations and its specialized\r\nagencies.\r\nHuman rights, democracy and the rule of law\r\nfigure prominently in the Declaration to be adopted at\r\nthis High-level Plenary Meeting. They are also at the\r\nheart of the mission of the Council of Europe. Our\r\nEuropean Convention on Human Rights, which is\r\ndirectly and expressly derived from the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, remains one of the\r\nforemost examples of the implementation of that\r\nDeclaration’s values at the regional level.\r\nThe relationship between the Council of Europe\r\nand the United Nations is not restricted to words. There\r\nis also  practical cooperation in many areas involving\r\nhuman rights, including the battles against terrorism,\r\ntorture, trafficking in human beings, racism and\r\nviolence against children and women.\r\nOne threat to human rights is terrorism; the\r\npeople of New York know it well. Europe, too, has\r\nsuffered from appalling atrocities over the past two\r\nyears in Russia, Turkey, Spain and the United\r\nKingdom.\r\nTerrorism seeks to destroy our way of life and to\r\nundermine freedom, democracy and the rule of law. It\r\nis unjustifiable under any circumstances and in any\r\nculture. We must resolutely defend those values and\r\nrights, on which both the United Nations and the\r\nCouncil of Europe were founded, and we must also\r\nmake sure that measures taken by Governments do not\r\ncurtail those same values and rights. That is why we\r\nmust continue our efforts to prevent torture and\r\npreserve freedom of expression and information.\r\nI welcome the efforts of the Counter-Terrorism\r\nCommittee of the Security Council to work with\r\nregional organizations in the struggle against terrorism.\r\nI also welcome the decision to establish a Human\r\nRights Council, and I hope that it will retain the\r\npositive features of the current system and that it will\r\nalso work closely with regional organizations.\r\nWinston Churchill put it well in a speech in 1948.\r\nWhen referring to a future Council of Europe and its\r\nrelationship with the United Nations, he called for\r\n“regional councils, august but subordinate”, which\r\nwould be the “pillars upon which the world\r\norganization would be founded in majesty and calm”.\r\nNearly 60 years later, I am not sure the Council of\r\nEurope can be described as august or that the United\r\nNations can be described as majestic and calm, but I do\r\nbelieve that the strengthened relationship between the\r\nUnited Nations and regional organizations, advocated\r\nin the Declaration to be adopted at this world summit,\r\nis a step in the right direction.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): I call on\r\nMs. Florence Mugasha, Deputy Secretary-General of\r\nthe Commonwealth Secretariat.\r\nMs. Mugasha (Commonwealth Secretariat): the\r\nSecretary-General of the Commonwealth Secretariat,\r\nThe Right Honourable Don McKinnon, regrets that he\r\n58\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nis unable to deliver this statement in person, due to\r\nanother pressing engagement. He has therefore asked\r\nme, as his deputy, to deliver his speech, which reads as\r\nfollows.\r\n“I was privileged to speak in this Hall five\r\nyears ago when world leaders agreed on the\r\nMillennium Declaration — a vision for a fairer,\r\nsafer and more prosperous world. I am honoured\r\nto speak today on the same subject, once again on\r\nbehalf of the 53 nations of the Commonwealth.\r\n“One of the great things about meeting here\r\nin New York City is that we see what can be\r\nachieved through prosperity and technological\r\nadvances: going into space; sending information,\r\npictures and even money around the world in\r\nmilliseconds; finding cures for age-old maladies.\r\n“Here in New York, as in many other\r\ndynamic cities throughout the world, we can also\r\nglimpse on the horizon what growth and\r\nprosperity could offer in the future. But we must\r\ncontrast that with what we also see in many\r\ncountries day after day. We see children who we\r\nknow will never see the inside of a classroom,\r\nand young and old people who will die of\r\ndysentery, malaria, tuberculosis and other curable\r\ndiseases. For most, drinking water is a\r\ndiminishing resource that is either unaffordable\r\nor simply unavailable. We see people condemned\r\nto inferior status because of their gender or\r\nreligion or the colour of their skin, or simply\r\nbecause they happened to be in the wrong place\r\nat the wrong time.\r\n“Members will have heard many statistics\r\nover the past three days. The picture is a sombre\r\none, and we are all affected. Our limited success\r\nin achieving the Millennium Development Goals\r\n(MDGs) after five years should, above all, shock\r\ninto action those of us here who can do more.\r\nThose with the means must be more committed\r\nand more generous to those in the statistical\r\nspotlight.\r\n“This year, the Group-of-Eight countries\r\nhave pledged increased aid and debt cancellation\r\nfor low-income countries. I applaud those\r\ninitiatives. The test, as always, is ‘delivery,\r\ndelivery, delivery’ — ensuring that the funds\r\nmade available are spent with wisdom,\r\nresponsibility, accountability and effectiveness.\r\nIn the Commonwealth, 11 of our 53 members\r\nhave already recorded significant progress on the\r\nMDGs, but 31 have made slow progress, and\r\nsome are actually going backwards. The\r\nCommonwealth will have to redouble its efforts\r\nto achieve the MDGs, and it will do so.\r\n“We will help to build or rebuild those\r\ndemocratic institutions which we know go hand\r\nin hand with stable and prosperous societies. We\r\nwill continue our work on issues relating to small\r\nStates, international trade, gender and\r\nsustainability, using official and civil society\r\nnetworks and partnerships. That is the\r\nCommonwealth way.\r\n“This year marks 60 years of the United\r\nNations. This institution embodies mankind’s\r\ncollective will to live and progress together in a\r\ncollaborative way and in a community of nations.\r\nMultilateralism is the only way in which common\r\nproblems can be solved in a substantive way and\r\nin which the future can be secured for all of us.\r\nGlobal challenges require global responses.\r\n“My colleague, Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan, has placed before Governments a wide-\r\nranging series of proposals to move the United\r\nNations forward as an institution and to promote\r\nthe priority global issues with which it deals. I\r\nespecially welcome the proposed strengthening of\r\nthe United Nations work in the areas of peace-\r\nbuilding, human rights and anti-terrorism, as well\r\nas the special attention it devotes to development\r\nand democracy.\r\n“Development can no longer be thought of\r\nsimply in terms of gross domestic product.\r\nDevelopment is about possibilities first and\r\nproduction second. It is about touching the lives\r\nof everyone.\r\n“Democracy, too, is about expanding\r\nopportunities and strengthening human\r\ncapabilities. Only if democracy and development\r\nlive in the hearts of the people of a country and\r\nhave real meaning for them, will that country’s\r\ninstitutions work as they should and sustainable\r\nprosperity be realized.\r\n“With the requisite will, partnerships and\r\nresources, it is not too late to achieve the\r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDG) by 2015.\r\n59\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nThe political will was there in 2000. There is\r\ntherefore no excuse not to recommit to the MDGs\r\nthis week, to make the necessary pledges and to\r\nsay, ‘We will do it’. The Commonwealth will\r\ncontinue to play its part.”\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): I now call on\r\nMr. Haruhiko Kuroda, President of the Asian\r\nDevelopment Bank.\r\nMr. Kuroda (Asian Development Bank): We\r\nstand today at a crossroads of great opportunity and\r\ngreat uncertainty. The actions that follow this pivotal\r\nUnited Nations summit will determine whether the\r\nworld achieves the Millennium Development Goals\r\n(MDG). With two thirds of the world’s poor residing in\r\nAsia and the Pacific, it is clear that the region holds the\r\nkey to solving the global poverty challenge. No other\r\ndeveloping region of the world has been more\r\nsuccessful in creating economic growth and alleviating\r\nabsolute poverty. But achieving all the MDGs by 2015\r\nwill still require massive investment, given the scale of\r\ndeprivation in Asia and the Pacific. The region has\r\nmore people with inadequate nutrition, more living in\r\nslum conditions and more without access to water and\r\nsanitation than any other region of the world. However,\r\nthe MDGs can be achieved, provided efforts are\r\nintensified considerably.\r\nSustained, rapid and broad-based growth is\r\nfundamental to our task. But growth will not be\r\nsustained unless it is inclusive. This will require more\r\nresources for basic services, as well as ensuring that\r\nwomen, indigenous peoples and the poor are not left\r\nout. Growth will not be sustained if we neglect the\r\nenvironment. The same extraordinary growth that has\r\nlifted millions up from poverty in our region now\r\nthreatens millions more as environments become\r\ndegraded, pollution increases and people migrate to\r\novercrowded towns and cities. Sound policies are\r\nneeded to reverse those problems. Growth will also not\r\nbe sustained if Asia’s huge needs for investment in\r\ninfrastructure, technology and human capital remain\r\nunmet. Clearly, we need greater private-sector\r\nparticipation. For this, laws and institutions that protect\r\nproperty rights, encourage openness, improve financial\r\ngovernance and strengthen capital markets are needed.\r\nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) has placed its\r\nresources and advisory services behind that agenda.\r\nIncreasingly, the economic integration of the Asia\r\nand Pacific region is becoming an imperative for its\r\ngrowth and development. Regional initiatives have\r\nenhanced connectivity through infrastructure and\r\nreduced poverty and barriers to trade and investment.\r\nIntraregional trade has increased and financial and\r\nmonetary cooperation has intensified. Continued\r\nprogress in these areas will increase the region’s\r\nresilience and growth potential. Regional cooperation\r\nmust also be expanded to directly impact the MDGs in\r\nsuch areas as environmental degradation,\r\ncommunicable diseases and the migration of workers.\r\nThe task before us is urgent and imminent. The\r\nADB is committed to fighting poverty. We will do so in\r\npartnership with others. The Paris Declaration on Aid\r\nEffectiveness provides an excellent framework for\r\ndeveloping and deepening cooperation. We also value\r\nvery highly our partnership with United Nations\r\nagencies. We recently released a regional MDG report\r\nthat was jointly authored by the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme, the Economic and Social\r\nCommission for Asia and the Pacific and the Asian\r\nDevelopment Bank.\r\nThe prerequisites I have outlined are fully\r\nconsistent with the desires and commitments of Asia\r\nand the Pacific. The momentum that has been\r\ngenerated must be translated into action in the years\r\nremaining before 2015. We hope that this summit’s\r\noutcome will trace a clear road map towards that end.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): I now give the\r\nfloor to Mr. Donald Kaberuka, President of the African\r\nDevelopment Bank.\r\nMr. Kaberuka (African Development Bank): I\r\nam honoured to have this opportunity to address the\r\nGeneral Assembly in the name of the African\r\nDevelopment Bank, whose presidency I assumed this\r\nmonth.\r\nThe African Development Bank welcomes the\r\noutcome of this special gathering, which is an\r\nopportunity for the international community to review\r\nthe progress made towards achieving the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) and to assess the extra\r\npush that is needed. It has been a unique opportunity\r\nfor both developing countries and their partners to\r\nrededicate for the achievement of the MDGs with\r\nrenewed optimism and vigour.\r\nThe leaders who have preceded me in this historic\r\nHall have articulated issues surrounding the greatest\r\nchallenges of our time. There is unanimity on the\r\n60\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nsituation. Many regions in the developing world are\r\nmaking satisfactory progress in eliminating poverty\r\nand achieving the MDGs. The major challenge now is\r\nmainly to assist the African continent and, of course,\r\nother relevant low-income countries, to accelerate\r\nprogress towards the MDGs.\r\nAs Africa’s leading development financing\r\ninstitution, we welcome the commitments made over\r\nthe last two days, coming so soon after the decision of\r\nthe G-8 at Gleneagles on official development\r\nassistance (ODA), debt and trade. The prospects for\r\nachieving the MDGs in Africa have improved\r\nconsiderably in recent years. Conflicts are waning in\r\nmuch of the continent, thanks to the efforts of the\r\nAfrican Union. Democratic reforms and significant\r\nimprovements in systems of governance are taking root\r\nin more and more of our countries. An increasing\r\nnumber of our countries are implementing sound\r\nmacroeconomic policies.\r\nAt the regional level, the NEPAD initiative is not\r\nonly advancing regional cooperation and integration, it\r\nis also promoting the principles of democracy, good\r\ngovernance and sound economic policies through the\r\nAfrican Peer Review Mechanism.\r\nWe believe that an unprecedented window of\r\nopportunity exists today. However, we have in the past\r\ntoo often fallen short of our own pledges, which have\r\nbeen made but not fully delivered on, or scaled down\r\nover time. It is imperative this time that we ensure the\r\nfull implementation of our pledges, as we must\r\nimplement the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.\r\nWe, like everyone here, have expressed the hope and\r\ndetermination that the Doha round to be held in\r\nDecember in Hong Kong will be a success, particularly\r\nwith respect to the removal of trade-distorting\r\nagricultural subsidies and tariff and non-tariff barriers.\r\nIn their determination to overcome the challenges\r\nof development, the African founding fathers\r\nestablished the African Development Bank 40 years\r\nago. To date, the Bank has provided considerable\r\nresources and technical assistance to support the efforts\r\nof its regional member countries.\r\nIn the context of NEPAD, Africa’s leaders and the\r\ninternational donor community have identified the\r\nBank as a privileged partner in the new initiatives to\r\nsupport Africa. The Bank is repositioning itself\r\ntowards that end.\r\nWe have noted that the outcome document of this\r\nconference calls for a greater role for the African\r\nDevelopment Bank, to enable it, inter alia, to play a\r\nkey part in efforts to close the infrastructure gap. We\r\nare prepared to do so and are building up our capacities\r\nand partnerships with others to play that role. It is self-\r\nevident that the MDGs will be that much harder to\r\nattain as long as Africa’s infrastructure gap is not\r\nclosed.\r\nWe will work with other institutions to establish a\r\nconcrete framework to deliver on the G-8 initiative on\r\ndebt. For us, the key issue is that of additionality and\r\nof strengthening the long-term capacity of the African\r\nDevelopment Bank to finance the development of its\r\nmember countries.\r\nIn that context, we look forward to the initiative’s\r\nbeing extended to cover also the debts owed to the\r\nAfrican Development Bank window and to other\r\nmembers of the Bank Group, which are often referred\r\nto as middle-income countries. Many of them have\r\nlarge pockets of poverty, and some are large economies\r\nwith very significant neighbourhood effects. What\r\nhappens in those countries is important for Africa’s\r\nattainment of the MDGs.\r\nWe are intensifying our capacity to support\r\ncountries in post-conflict situations as well as the\r\nso-called fragile States. We are convinced that Africa’s\r\ndependence on aid will diminish as growth prospects\r\nimprove. Dependence will decline as the international\r\ntrade regime improves. That is why the success of the\r\nHong Kong meeting is of such critical importance to\r\nus.\r\nAs I come to the end of my statement, allow me\r\nto mention an issue of concern which was not foreseen\r\nin the year 2000 but which has now become so crucial\r\nit must be addressed. As we meet here today, the\r\ndramatic increase in oil prices is threatening to roll\r\nback growth possibilities in many African nations,\r\nworsening their internal and external imbalances. It is\r\nno longer a short-term external shock; it is having an\r\nimpact on growth, inflation, the balance of payments\r\nand public expenditure to fight poverty in a lasting\r\nway. It is imperative that the international community\r\nbear in mind this factor, which was not so acute when\r\nwe adopted the MDGs in the year 2000. We must\r\nattempt to identify and put in place a suitable response\r\nthat can protect African countries’ achievements and\r\npreserve them in future. For our part, we will work\r\n61\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nwith the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the\r\nWorld Bank to determine how we can best provide the\r\nrequisite level of support to those countries, with a\r\nview to safeguarding prospects of attaining the MDGs.\r\nAs this unique summit ends, we are encouraged\r\nby its outcome. It did not provide everything we would\r\nhave liked to see, but it is a way forward. The African\r\nDevelopment Bank stands ready to play its role in this\r\ncommon fight for humanity.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): I give the floor\r\nto Mr. Guy Rider, General Secretary of the\r\nInternational Confederation of Free Trade Unions.\r\nMr. Ryder (International Confederation of Free\r\nTrade Unions): I speak this evening for the 145 million\r\nworking men and women united in the International\r\nConfederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and also\r\non behalf of the World Confederation of Labour. I\r\nspeak also as one of the spokespersons here for the\r\nGlobal Call to Action against Poverty (GCAP), of\r\nwhich the ICFTU is a founding member.\r\nBut, given that I and my fellow representatives of\r\ncivil society are speaking after the adoption of the\r\nsummit’s final outcome document, I have to say that it\r\nwould be unfortunate indeed if civil society, which has\r\ncontributed so energetically to this endeavour, were to\r\nbe perceived as no more than an afterthought in its\r\nproceedings.\r\nPoverty and hunger remain the lot of billions of\r\npeople worldwide, a situation which is unconscionable\r\nand unsustainable. This is the time for Member States\r\nto show vision and leadership and the capacity to work\r\ntogether to implement the commitments they have\r\nmade at the major United Nations conferences and\r\nglobal summits of recent years.\r\nPolitical leaders must recognize and must act\r\nupon the need to foster global solidarity in order to\r\nadvance commonly shared global objectives and lend\r\nfull support to the achievement of national\r\ndevelopment priorities.\r\nWe therefore reiterate the call of the GCAP:\r\nWake up to poverty. Urgent solutions must be found.\r\nThe right policy choices to achieve the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) are possible; they are\r\nwithin our reach; and they must be adopted so that the\r\nsituation can be turned around and a virtuous circle of\r\ngrowth with equity brought about.\r\nFirst and foremost, we need an enabling global\r\npolicy environment, as called for by MDG 8, and by\r\nthat I mean, of course, fair trade, more and better aid,\r\ndebt cancellation and debt relief, and a new, strong\r\nsocial dimension to the policies of the international\r\nfinancial institutions and the World Trade Organization\r\n(WTO).\r\nWe need effective national-level policies with a\r\nfocus on pro-poor, gender-sensitive growth strategies,\r\non participation of civil society, including trade unions,\r\nand on respect for workers’ rights and human rights in\r\ngeneral. Globally and nationally, we need a strong\r\nfocus on a decent work agenda as the most significant\r\nway out of poverty, as was called for by the\r\nInternational Labour Organization’s (ILO) World\r\nCommission on the Social Dimension of Globalization.\r\nDecent work carried out in respect for fundamental\r\nworkers’ rights provides the empowerment that women\r\nand men need to improve their living standards and to\r\nparticipate in decisions affecting their lives and\r\nlivelihoods and, ultimately, to work their way out of,\r\nand escape from, poverty.\r\nThe United Nations system, including the ILO,\r\nwith its body of norms, provides the social pillar of the\r\nmultilateral system as the anchor for establishing\r\npolicy coherence, and it must be strengthened, not\r\nweakened. Therefore, the proposals contained in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report to enhance United Nations\r\neffectiveness through a revitalization of the Economic\r\nand Social Council and of the Security Council, a new\r\nHuman Rights Council and a new Peacebuilding\r\nCommission, and other proposals require and deserve\r\nthe support of all Member States.\r\nTough as negotiations can be on these issues, they\r\nsimply cannot be shelved. The process is much too\r\nimportant to be dropped now. So those parts of the\r\nreform agenda that have not been agreed in the\r\noutcome document of this summit should be the\r\nsubject of further discussion during the sixtieth session\r\nof the General Assembly, and they should be\r\nnegotiated in good faith, with a view to achieving win-\r\nwin outcomes for the benefit of the peoples of the\r\nplanet.\r\nThrough these and all the issues raised in his\r\nreport entitled “In larger freedom”, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral reminds us of our responsibilities — today,\r\nglobal responsibilities — to stand together against\r\npoverty and exclusion and against arms spending, and,\r\n62\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\ninstead, to stand together for peacebuilding and the\r\npeaceful resolution of conflicts. And as we weigh\r\ntoday the urgent need to act on these critical challenges\r\nof the twenty-first century, let us ponder also the dire\r\nconsequences of inaction: a world no longer secure and\r\nfit to pass on to our children. At this time of deep\r\ninsecurity and conflict in the world, we should recall\r\nthat social justice remains the surest guarantee of\r\nuniversal and lasting peace.\r\nJoining together to achieve that justice is our best\r\ncontribution to making sure that we and our children\r\ncan live in a world free from poverty, desperation and\r\nconflict in future years. The United Nations has known\r\nits greatest successes and won its lasting authority from\r\nthose occasions when its Member States have risen\r\nabove narrow self-interests to the uplands from which\r\nthe vision of a better common future becomes clear.\r\nThe peoples of the United Nations are watching to see\r\nhow their leaders have met their responsibilities at this\r\nsummit and how they have honoured solemn\r\ncommitments already made. And, as is proper, that\r\nscrutiny will continue in the future.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): Let me say that\r\nI very much appreciate those comments. They will be\r\nmade known to the full membership; I hope that I will\r\nbe able to make some brief comments at the end, which\r\nI hope will be relevant to all.\r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by\r\nMrs. Virginia Vargas, Founding Director and Executive\r\nBoard Member of the Flora Tristan Centre for Peruvian\r\nWomen.\r\nMrs. Vargas (Flora Tristan Centre for Peruvian\r\nWomen) (spoke in Spanish): Before beginning, I wish\r\nto protest about the way in which the outcome\r\ndocument was adopted, the way in which the list of\r\nspeakers was changed and the anti-democratic way in\r\nwhich civil society has been left out of this summit. As\r\nan activist in world civil society I would echo the\r\ninsistent and disenchanted voices of world social\r\nmovements who say to the heads of State who are or\r\nwere present at this Meeting that the world as it is now\r\nis ethically unacceptable, politically devastating and\r\neconomically and environmentally unsustainable.\r\nThose movements affirm, as we have affirmed in the\r\nWorld Social Forum, that other worlds are possible, but\r\nto achieve this, radical change is required, change\r\nwhich places men and women at the centre of\r\ndevelopment. Those movements wish to say to this\r\nGeneral Assembly that it is missing a historic\r\nopportunity to shoulder its responsibilities and keep its\r\npromises to create a more just world, that its lack of\r\ncommitment to the mission of the United Nations is\r\nkeeping the Organization from being an Organization\r\nof “We the peoples”, and that urgent changes required\r\nby the world can be possible only through the\r\ndismantling of unjust, anti-democratic world forces,\r\nmaintained by powerful countries and their allies,\r\nnamely neo-liberalism, militarism and fundamentalism\r\nof every kind.\r\nA life free from want is possible only if we alter\r\nthe development mindset which puts economic growth\r\nbefore human development. In a world where the\r\nproduction of wealth is enormous and at the same time\r\npoverty and exclusion have increased dramatically, the\r\ncentral problem is tremendous inequity in the\r\ndistribution of wealth. This situation is legitimized by\r\nan unjust international order that favours the most\r\npowerful. Where are the new instruments of\r\naccountability and global taxation on multilateral\r\ncorporations? How long will the treatment of deadly\r\ndiseases such as AIDS continue to be secondary to the\r\nearnings of transnational companies, and where,\r\nfinally, are the democratic proposals to deal with\r\nindecent and immoral debt, paid for many times over?\r\nThat debt is ethically unrecoverable for the peoples of\r\nthe world.\r\nA life without fear will not be possible while\r\npolitical power is allied with the economic power of\r\nthe arms producers. This alliance lacks the legitimacy\r\nto decide whether a situation is an imminent threat or a\r\npotential danger. It in itself is a threat and a danger\r\nbecause it resorts to lies and to arbitrary unilateralism\r\nto feed its constant need for war. We require\r\ndisarmament not be gradual and selective, we need\r\ngeneral disarmament. We need a change in the way in\r\nwhich conflicts are resolved. We need also to address\r\nother causes of fear. A life without fear is built when\r\nwe confront violence against women in all spheres and\r\nwhen we confront racism, recognizing the rights and\r\nautonomy of indigenous peoples. It is built by\r\naffirming the rights of social movements such as\r\nwomen’s movements, which contribute to the peace\r\nagenda. It is built by respecting international\r\nagreements, which are a global ethical responsibility.\r\nGovernments reluctant to sign the Kyoto Protocol\r\ntoday have a responsibility for the disaster and\r\nsuffering caused by Hurricane Katrina. Governments\r\n63\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nwho claim impunity with respect to war crimes,\r\nrefusing to strengthen international law, will have to be\r\naccountable to history. The fight against terrorism\r\ncannot ignore human rights.\r\nHow can we live in freedom in these conditions?\r\nWhat freedom are we building when we know that\r\nhunger is depleting resources that will be irretrievable\r\nfor the new generations? What freedom can there be\r\nwithout recognizing individuals’ sexual and\r\nreproductive rights and the rights to different forms of\r\nsexuality and expressions of love? Living in freedom\r\nwill be possible only if human rights, which are\r\nindivisible, universal and interdependent, are placed at\r\nthe heart of the structure and policies of States and of\r\nthe United Nations, only if States are secular, governed\r\nby all citizens and not by particular religious interests,\r\nand only if we correct the imbalance of power in the\r\nSecurity Council, which cannot be resolved solely by\r\nadding or removing Members, but rather by\r\neliminating the right to the veto.\r\nThe United Nations, to fulfil its mission, must\r\nrise to the challenges of the new millennium. The\r\nUnited Nations cannot simply consist of Governments,\r\nas has been the case at this summit. Its democratic\r\nreform must be open to all contributions from social\r\nmovements and democratic forces, in order to build a\r\ndifferent world without poverty or exclusion. The\r\nUnited Nations must recover its mission. It must be of\r\n“We the peoples”, or it will cease to be.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): I will come\r\nback with some comments of my own later on.\r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by\r\nMr. Bamanga Tukur, Group Chairman of BHI Holdings\r\nLimited.\r\nMr. Tukur (BHI Holdings Limited): It is a great\r\nhonour for me to have the unique opportunity to\r\naddress this distinguished assembly of world leaders on\r\nbehalf of the private sector. This High-level Meeting of\r\nthe General Assembly is a milestone in the history of\r\ninternational public-private dialogue. I should like to\r\nexpress sincere appreciation to the Co-Chairpersons of\r\nthe World Summit 2005. Their efforts to bring together\r\ndistinguished heads of State or Government to\r\ndeliberate on contemporary regional and global issues\r\nare to be applauded.\r\nAllow me also to use this opportunity to pay\r\ntribute to Secretary-General Kofi Annan, a leader\r\nwhose commitment to the values of the United Nations\r\nis outstanding. His intense work to ensure that this\r\ngreat Organization addresses the most critical issues of\r\nour time is remarkable.\r\nThis world summit is an important step, coming\r\non the heels of the G-8 Meeting in Gleneagles, where\r\nhistoric decisions were taken concerning the\r\ndevelopment agenda. Of late, several initiatives, such\r\nas the New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD) framework, have been put in place, focusing\r\non the most basic issues of reducing poverty and\r\ndelivering sustainable development. In spite of these\r\nactions, it is still widely agreed that much more needs\r\nto be done.\r\nThe goals being pursued by the General\r\nAssembly and the larger international community are\r\nof great importance and relevance to the private sector.\r\nIn today’s global society, business interests\r\nincreasingly overlap with development objectives.\r\nBusiness operations — from microenterprises to\r\nmultinationals — are greatly impacted by health,\r\nsecurity and economic development factors. Adequate\r\ninfrastructure, access to finance and better regulation\r\nwould enhance foreign and domestic investment\r\ninflow. There is also a need to strengthen the capacity\r\nof private sector institutions to contribute towards\r\nsustainable development.\r\nBusiness and economic development reinforce\r\none another; they are infinitely compatible. Business is\r\ngood for development and development is good for\r\nbusiness. Business development is central; it is the key\r\nto opening the door of opportunity for employment and\r\nthe ability to prosper. Business leaders are acutely\r\naware of that linkage. We are undertaking responsible\r\nbusiness practices, such as conducting transparent\r\ntransactions, investing in local infrastructure and\r\nimplementing programmes to combat HIV/AIDS and\r\nother diseases, which are part of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goal objectives.\r\nThe United Nations Global Compact initiative\r\nprovides the enabling context for the private sector to\r\nparticipate actively in the development effort. The\r\nGlobal Compact advocates that corporate strategies and\r\noperations be rooted in core values in the areas of\r\nhuman rights, labour standards, the environment and\r\nanti-corruption.\r\nBusiness is a willing and able partner in the call\r\nto raise living standards for billions of people. In order\r\n64\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\nto maximize our common contribution to the\r\ndevelopment of stable economies, a business-friendly\r\nclimate is essential. An enabling environment\r\nencourages entrepreneurship, allows local companies\r\nto thrive and attracts foreign investment. It offers\r\ncompanies a fair chance to achieve returns. Political\r\nstability, good governance, clear property rights and\r\nreasonable tax structures are just some of the essential\r\nfactors for fostering private sector growth.\r\nThe least developed countries will continue to\r\nneed special attention and aid because of their\r\nparticular circumstances. The effectiveness of such\r\nassistance can be improved by applying business\r\nknow-how and proven business solutions, and by\r\nbuilding valuable partnerships between public and\r\nprivate sector actors. In that regard, it is heart-warming\r\nthat the African Business Roundtable (ABR), over\r\nwhich I preside, was identified in the United Nations\r\nMillennium Project report as a critical partner for\r\nattaining development goals. As the only continent-\r\nwide, pan-African grouping of business leaders, the\r\nABR and other private sector groupings accept that\r\nenormous responsibility and will meet the challenge\r\nthrough our resolve. Poverty can be made history only\r\nif the bad habits of autocracy and corruption are\r\nreplaced with democracy, good governance and\r\naccountability.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to express the confidence\r\nof the business sector in the General Assembly. Its\r\ncommitment to addressing the challenges facing the\r\ngoals set at the Millennium Summit is encouraging. Its\r\nsupport is needed to empower the private sector to\r\ncontribute fully to the achievement of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals and sustainable development\r\nworldwide, especially in Africa and the diaspora. It\r\nrepresents a new dawn for Africa.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): There are no\r\nmore speakers on my list for this part of the High-level\r\nPlenary Meeting.\r\nGiven the lateness of the hour, I will say just a\r\nfew words to the Assembly.\r\nFirst, as President of the General Assembly, I\r\nwant to express my deep regret that the outcome\r\ndocument was adopted before some speakers made\r\ntheir statements. This meeting, as members know, was\r\nseriously delayed because of the length of the\r\ninterventions, which were supposed to be limited to\r\nfive minutes but rarely were, and world leaders were\r\nleaving New York one by one at a time when a very\r\nimportant document was to be adopted.\r\nI am the first to regret that the decision was made\r\nto finish the deliberations after the Governments had\r\nspoken, and therefore that some speakers had to wait.\r\nTheir statements certainly deserved a full audience. I\r\ncount approximately 80 delegations present, and I\r\ncommend those that have been here so faithfully. All of\r\nus here have a duty to spread the word. We also have\r\nan obligation, via any statements that may be issued to\r\nthe press, to make sure that their message is sent. I also\r\nknow that this Meeting is being broadcast live all over\r\nthe world via the United Nations webcast.\r\nThose message are absolutely crucial. I myself\r\nwas Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian\r\nAffairs. I was in Somalia, Mozambique and the Sudan,\r\nand I was proud to work side by side with civil society,\r\nnon-governmental organizations, banks, trade unions\r\nand churches. They are extremely important partners.\r\nThat might ring hollow to those present here at this late\r\nhour, but I really want to assure them that, in the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixtieth\r\nsession, I will do my very best to make sure that their\r\nvoices are heard.\r\nWe also need the regional organizations; we need\r\ncivil society; we need the non-governmental\r\norganizations. The United Nations cannot exist if we in\r\nthis Hall do not introduce two realities. One reality is\r\nthe dreams and aspirations of people throughout the\r\nworld, many of whom are members of the\r\norganizations represented here. They are absolutely\r\ncrucial if we are to bring vitality into the United\r\nNations. The United Nations is facing a serious\r\nsituation right now, and we need that help. So the first\r\nreality that has to be brought into this Hall is the\r\nexpectations and dreams of the people of the world,\r\nand those here represent that.\r\nThe second reality that also needs to be brought\r\ninto these rooms is the real problems in the world: the\r\npoverty, the starving children, the sick — particularly\r\nthose suffering from preventable diseases — the\r\nnatural disasters, the environmental threats, the\r\ngrowing suspicions and fear that exist in this world. All\r\nthose realities need to come in here, too, and those\r\npresent represent that.\r\nI just want to tell them that I appreciate\r\nenormously their understanding, if they still have\r\nunderstanding. I highly appreciate their stamina and\r\n65\r\nA/60/PV.8\r\npatience in coming here and sending their message to\r\nthe world, and hope that they will consider us\r\npartners — partners at an historic stage, when\r\nmultilateralism is at stake. We will work together and I\r\nvery much count on their support. We need each other.\r\nWith those words, I thank everyone for their\r\npresence. I will certainly remember everything they\r\nhave said. They will see it, hopefully, in my speeches\r\nin the year to come. I know that the members of the\r\ndelegations here will also spread the word, but we will\r\nalso think of other ways to make the voices that have\r\nbeen raised heard in this Hall in years to come. I thank\r\neveryone for their contributions.\r\nI also want to thank the staff here, including the\r\ninterpreters who have been struggling day and night\r\nand the wonderful team from General Assembly\r\nAffairs, which has faithfully been at our side here as\r\nGabon and Sweden have co-chaired this Meeting.\r\nThis is the end of the biggest summit that, I think,\r\nhas ever taken place, and the document that was\r\nadopted — prematurely, unfortunately, for some of\r\nthose here — was extremely welcome. Circumstances\r\nwere such that the decision was perhaps\r\nunderstandable.\r\nMinute of silent prayer or meditation\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): I shall close this\r\nmeeting by inviting representatives of the peoples and\r\ncountries of the world to stand and observe one minute\r\nof silent prayer or meditation.\r\nThe members of the General Assembly observed a\r\nminute of silent prayer or meditation.\r\nClosure of the High-level Plenary Meeting\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Sweden): I declare closed\r\nthe High-level Plenary Meeting of the General\r\nAssembly of September 2005.\r\nThe meeting rose at 9.55 p.m.\r\n"
