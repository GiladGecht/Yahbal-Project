(Sweden)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nItem 111 of the provisional agenda\r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the work of\r\nthe Organization (A/60/1)\r\nThe President: In accordance with the decision\r\ntaken at the 1st plenary meeting, held on 13 September\r\n2005, the General Assembly will hear a presentation by\r\nthe Secretary-General of his annual report on the work\r\nof the Organization. I have the pleasure and honour of\r\ngiving the floor to the Secretary-General.\r\nThe Secretary-General: We meet at the end of a\r\nhistoric week for the United Nations. Progress has been\r\nmade across a broader front than on any other single\r\noccasion in the 60-year history of the Organization.\r\nWorld leaders have met to prohibit incitement to\r\nterrorism, pledge money to support democracy and\r\ndiscuss the threat of HIV/AIDS, malaria and bird flu.\r\nThe United Nations and the Association of Southeast\r\nAsian Nations agreed to closer relations. The leaders of\r\nthe European Union three and Iran met to seek a way\r\nforward. Important discussions were held on the\r\nMiddle East, Burundi, Côte d’Ivoire and Haiti.\r\nBut by far the most important achievements were\r\nat the World Summit itself. We did not achieve\r\neverything. After all, we were ambitious and set the bar\r\nvery high. But by tackling a range of issues together,\r\nwe clearly achieved a great deal.\r\nThe Summit made breakthroughs in adopting\r\nstrategies to fight poverty and disease, creating new\r\nmachinery to win the peace in war-torn countries and\r\npledging collective action to prevent genocide. It made\r\nreal progress on terrorism, human rights, democracy,\r\nmanagement of the Secretariat, peacekeeping and\r\nhumanitarian response. And it opened doors to further\r\naction on global public health, global warming and\r\nmediation.\r\nNow, we turn to a new task: to implement what\r\nhas been agreed and to keep working to bridge\r\ndifferences that remain. The Summit Outcome\r\n(resolution 60/1) imposes responsibility on each of us\r\nindividually and on all of us collectively. Many items\r\nmust be completed during the sixtieth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nWith so much work to do in one year, I propose\r\nthat we start with an accountability pact. Let us each\r\npledge to live up to what the Summit Outcome requires\r\nof us and hold each other to account for doing so.\r\nI intend to follow through on every action asked\r\nof me, and I ask Member States to tell me immediately\r\nif they think I am not doing so. I will also keep score\r\non the progress they make in implementing what has\r\nbeen agreed, and I will speak plainly if I believe they\r\nare falling behind. I have no doubt that global public\r\nopinion will keep a close eye on our progress. Let me\r\nremind the Assembly of some of the important items\r\non our checklist and of what each of us must do to\r\nmake sure that we tick them off on time.\r\n2\r\nA/60/PV.9\r\nFirst, with regard to management reform, the\r\nsummit document gives the go-ahead for extensive\r\nmanagement reforms to make the Secretariat more\r\nefficient, more effective and more accountable. I will\r\nstart, on Monday, to drive that process forward. Here is\r\nwhat I intend to do, as the Assembly has requested.\r\nTo update our work practices and improve\r\neffectiveness and efficiency, I will make\r\nrecommendations to assist the Assembly’s review of all\r\nongoing mandates agreed in the first 55 years of the\r\nOrganization. I will also undertake a thorough\r\nassessment of our budget and human resources rules,\r\nand recommend ways of adapting them so that the\r\nSecretariat is administered in the most up-to-date\r\nmanner. And I will offer the Assembly a detailed\r\nproposal for a one-time staff buyout, to ensure that we\r\nhave the personnel best suited to carry out the priorities\r\nthe Assembly has set.\r\nTo promote accountability, after commissioning a\r\nfull and independent review of our oversight and\r\nmanagement system, I will present a blueprint for an\r\nindependent oversight audit committee. I will also very\r\nsoon submit the details of the independent ethics office\r\nthat I intend to create, which will protect whistle-\r\nblowers and ensure more extensive financial\r\ndisclosure. I will also make proposals to ensure that, in\r\nthe future, the Secretary-General is fully equipped to\r\ndischarge his responsibilities as chief administrative\r\nofficer, and that Member States are able to hold him to\r\naccount.\r\nI ask the Assembly to live up to its commitments\r\nto follow through on those items and to meet its pledge\r\nto provide greater funding for internal oversight. Let us\r\nstay focused in the year ahead, and make those reforms\r\na reality. That is the way to restore the confidence of\r\npeople everywhere in the Organization’s integrity and\r\nability to deliver.\r\nSecond, we must strengthen our human rights\r\nmachinery. The High Commissioner for Human Rights\r\nwill move ahead in implementing her plan of action,\r\nand the Assembly has pledged to assist her in\r\nstrengthening her Office and doubling its budget. The\r\nAssembly has also agreed to strengthen the human\r\nrights treaty bodies. Most important, the Assembly has\r\nagreed to create a Human Rights Council. President\r\nEliasson needs the Assembly’s full support in\r\nconducting negotiations to finalize agreement on\r\nimportant details in the coming months. I believe\r\nnegotiations should resume on the basis of the detailed\r\nlanguage developed in the lead-up to the summit,\r\nwhich enjoyed the support of the overwhelming\r\nmajority of Member States. I believe that the majority\r\nmust lead, and that those who have reservations should\r\nmake an extra effort to show flexibility. Let us have a\r\nHuman Rights Council that commands respect and\r\nachieves results.\r\nThird, we must move forward on terrorism. The\r\nsummit contains, for the first time, an unqualified\r\ncondemnation by all Member States of terrorism in all\r\nits forms and manifestations, committed by whomever,\r\nwherever and for whatever purposes. As the Assembly\r\nhas agreed, it must build on that simple statement to\r\ncomplete a comprehensive convention against\r\nterrorism in the year ahead and forge a global counter-\r\nterrorism strategy that weakens terrorists and\r\nstrengthens the international community. We can do it,\r\nand we must do it.\r\nFourth, we must get the Peacebuilding\r\nCommission up and running. Almost all the key details\r\nhave now been agreed. The Assembly’s task in the next\r\nfew months is to finalize and operationalize the\r\nCommission; mine is to set up a small support office\r\nand a standing fund to support the Commission. Let us\r\neach do our part so that the Peacebuilding Commission\r\ncan begin its work before the end of the year.\r\nFifth, and particularly important, we must meet\r\nour commitments on development. This has been a\r\nhistoric year for development. After this week, any\r\ndoubt that the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)\r\nenjoyed universal support has been removed. We have\r\nan ambitious commitment to add $50 billion a year to\r\nthe fight for development within five years. The scale\r\nof that achievement seems to have been missed by\r\nsome. So let us make sure we live up to our promises\r\nto the world’s poor.\r\nEvery developing country is now pledged to\r\nformulate, and begin to implement by next year, a\r\nnational strategy bold enough to achieve the\r\ninternationally agreed development objectives,\r\nincluding the MDGs, by 2015. For their part,\r\ndeveloped countries must deliver on their pledges to\r\nboost financing for development and relieve debt. We\r\nalso have hopeful signs that progress is possible\r\ntowards the universal, rule-based, open, non-\r\ndiscriminatory and equitable multilateral trading\r\nsystem envisaged in the summit document. Let us build\r\n3\r\nA/60/PV.9\r\non that promise and press ahead with the Doha trade\r\nround.\r\nSixth, we must keep working on Security Council\r\nreform. We have tried hard to find a way forward on\r\nthat vital issue. It has not been easy, and we have not\r\nyet succeeded. But world leaders agree that early\r\nCouncil reform is, in their words, “an essential element\r\nof our overall effort to reform the United Nations”\r\n(resolution 60/1, para. 153). They have called for a\r\nreview of progress by the end of this year. Let all\r\nparties make a genuine effort to find a solution that can\r\ncommand wide support, not for the sake of any\r\nparticular group but for the sake of the Organization.\r\nSeventh, we must urgently begin to remedy our\r\ndistressing failures on nuclear non-proliferation and\r\ndisarmament. The consensus underlying the Treaty on\r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) is\r\nbadly frayed. Twice this year — at the NPT Review\r\nConference and now at this summit — months of\r\nnegotiation have yielded silence. States could not even\r\nagree to reaffirm their existing commitments or find a\r\nway forward, even at the level of principles. They have\r\nbeen content to point fingers at each other, rather than\r\nwork for solutions.\r\nYet we face the growing risks of proliferation and\r\ncatastrophic terrorism, and the stakes are too high to\r\ncontinue down a dangerous path of diplomatic\r\nbrinksmanship. Let us instead work together to\r\nstrengthen all three pillars of the regime: non-\r\nproliferation, disarmament and peaceful uses. I\r\nencourage Norway, Australia, Chile, Indonesia,\r\nRomania, South Africa and the United Kingdom to\r\ncontinue their efforts to find a way forward. All States\r\nshould support their initiative to address this existential\r\nthreat.\r\nSometimes multilateral solutions seem\r\nimpossibly difficult, but from time to time it pays to\r\nstep back and see how far we have come.\r\nI first spoke from this rostrum in 1999 on the\r\nneed for the international community to act in the face\r\nof genocide. My remarks caused intense debate among\r\nthe membership. Yet now, six years later, after many\r\nStates have worked hard, civil society has become fully\r\nengaged and genuine concerns have been addressed,\r\nyou have come together to acknowledge your solemn\r\nresponsibility not just to care, but to act. You will be\r\ntested on that commitment in the years ahead.\r\nMake no mistake. This is a hard-won revolution\r\nin international affairs and a signal of hope for the\r\nweakest in our world. And it teaches us a vital lesson:\r\nif we persevere, we can find collective answers to our\r\ncommon problems.\r\nSo let us work together, confident and\r\ndetermined. If we do that, and if we do what we have\r\npromised this week, we will help save millions of lives\r\nand give hope to billions of people. That would be a\r\nfitting achievement to mark the sixtieth anniversary of\r\nthe United Nations and a platform from which to do\r\neven more in the years ahead.\r\nThe President: I thank the Secretary-General for\r\nhis address.\r\nStatement by the President\r\nThe President: The 2005 world summit is now\r\nconcluded. We have thoroughly reviewed progress\r\ntowards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)\r\nand the reform process facing the United Nations. Our\r\npolitical leaders, who have come in such great numbers\r\nto New York, have instilled new energy into our efforts\r\nto meet those common development goals and to\r\nprepare the United Nations for the weighty demands\r\nplaced on multilateral cooperation in the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nOver the past three days, our leaders brought into\r\nthe General Assembly their peoples’ expectations of\r\nthe United Nations but also their pain and anger\r\nresulting from unmet needs and unfulfilled aspirations.\r\nIn stark terms, they brought the realities of the\r\nproblems of the world into this historic Hall. They told\r\nus unequivocally that progress towards the goals we\r\nagreed at the Millennium Summit, and towards the\r\ncommitments we made at Monterrey, has been\r\ninsufficient. The cost is being counted in the\r\ninnumerable lives lost or made intolerable as a result of\r\npreventable poverty and in the failure to unleash the\r\nmassive potential of so many of our men, women and\r\nchildren around the world.\r\nBut the summit also registered strong agreement\r\non the way forward — for example, on the need for\r\ndeveloping countries to be fully in the lead through\r\nbold national strategies for achieving the MDGs by\r\n2015. We heard a strong welcome for recent progress\r\non aid and debt, although many members expect\r\nfurther action on debt, more quickly and in more\r\ncountries. And, with regard to trade, I trust that the\r\n4\r\nA/60/PV.9\r\nworld will have heard the overwhelming message of so\r\nmany of our leaders that failure to make real and\r\nsubstantial progress in Hong Kong must not be an\r\noption. On this, and on all the actions needed to\r\nachieve the MDGs, the Organization must continue to\r\nscrutinize progress and demand greater effort wherever\r\nit is needed.\r\nWhat else did we hear from our leaders? Most\r\nimportant, we heard an unfailing commitment to\r\ninternational cooperation and to the United Nations and\r\nthe purposes and principles enshrined in its Charter. It\r\nwas particularly gratifying to note the central role that\r\nour leaders expect a revitalized and relevant General\r\nAssembly to play.\r\nThe basis for our reform agenda is the 2005\r\nWorld Summit Outcome document (resolution 60/1),\r\nthe result of much thought, much labour and much\r\npainstaking scrutiny; I think everyone would agree on\r\nthat. I want to join those speakers who have paid\r\ntribute to the Secretary-General and to my predecessor,\r\nJean Ping, for their tireless efforts. I also want to pay\r\ntribute to all members; the final document is very much\r\ntheir achievement.\r\nI believe the outcome document is a strong and\r\nsubstantial foundation for our work on development,\r\nsecurity and human rights, as well as the structure of\r\nthe United Nations. Many see it as a solid basis for the\r\nmost ambitious reform agenda in the history of the\r\nUnited Nations. Others argue that it will make little\r\ndifference in the outside world. Still others are\r\nfrustrated that issues important to them are missing or\r\ninsufficiently clear, whether they relate to\r\ndevelopment, human rights, disarmament and non-\r\nproliferation, or Security Council reform.\r\nWho is right? The answer, I believe, is up to us.\r\nThe document should, as one speaker put it, be a\r\nbeachhead of common ground from which we launch\r\nourselves forward with urgency and common purpose.\r\nThe world will be watching to see if we do so during\r\nthis important sixtieth session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nFollow-up and implementation of the summit\r\noutcome has been agreed as the major theme of this\r\ngeneral debate, starting today. I very much hope that\r\nMember States will use this opportunity to bring out\r\ntheir observations and ideas about both the substance\r\nof our issues — the sombre realities of today’s\r\nworld — and the process and work ahead.\r\nMembers’ views on the areas in which we are\r\nexpected to finish the work outlined in the summit\r\noutcome document will be of particular interest: these\r\nare, primarily, the Peacebuilding Commission, the\r\nHuman Rights Council, terrorism and Security Council\r\nand management reform. As I indicated at the opening\r\nof the sixtieth session, once we have absorbed all the\r\ncontributions to the general debate, I plan to present an\r\noutline of work related to summit follow-up for the\r\nyear ahead. At that point, I also intend to share with\r\nmembers some thoughts on the revitalization of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nLet us now face those tasks energized by the\r\nrealities brought into our deliberations by our leaders,\r\nnever forgetting that we are here to serve the peoples\r\nof the world — a world where there is so much\r\nsuffering, insecurity and oppression. I also hope that\r\nour leaders will continue to place the United Nations\r\nhigh on their agendas and that they will continue, in\r\nvarious formats and forums, to press for the fulfilment\r\nof the MDGs and the implementation of the summit\r\noutcome.\r\nIn our work here at the United Nations, let us be\r\nas practical and concrete as possible and organize\r\nourselves so that we can deliver results. That will\r\nrequire a spirit of compromise, civility and discipline.\r\nAnd I want us to conduct our work with transparency,\r\nefficiency and fairness. I look forward to our\r\ncooperation and count on the support of members in\r\nthis, our common and vital endeavour.\r\nItem 9 of the provisional agenda\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: Before giving the floor to the\r\nfirst speaker in the debate, I should like to remind\r\nmembers that the list of speakers has been formed on\r\nthe basis that statements will have a time limit of 15\r\nminutes. I should like to appeal to speakers to deliver\r\ntheir statements at a normal speed, so that\r\ninterpretation can be provided properly.\r\nI should also like to draw the attention of\r\nrepresentatives to the decision taken by the Assembly\r\nat previous sessions that the practice of expressing\r\ncongratulations inside the Hall after a statement has\r\nbeen made is strongly discouraged. In this connection,\r\nI should like to invite speakers in the general debate,\r\nafter having delivered their statements, to exit the\r\n5\r\nA/60/PV.9\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall through room GA-200, located\r\nbehind the podium, before returning to their seats.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly agrees to\r\nproceed in the same manner during the general debate\r\nof the sixtieth session?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I give the floor to His Excellency\r\nMr. Celso Luiz Nunes Amorim, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Brazil.\r\nMr. Amorim (Brazil) (spoke in Portuguese;\r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): I should like\r\nto extend my warmest congratulations to you, Sir,\r\nAmbassador Jan Eliasson of Sweden, on your\r\nassumption of the presidency of the General Assembly\r\nat its sixtieth session. I should also like to express\r\nfraternal greetings to Secretary-General Kofi Annan,\r\nwhose wisdom and commitment to multilateralism\r\nhave made an immense contribution to progress here at\r\nthe United Nations. Minister Jean Ping of Gabon\r\ndeserves special recognition for the competent and\r\ndedicated manner in which he presided over the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-ninth session.\r\nThis is a rare and historic opportunity to promote\r\nchange; let us not waste it. Peace, development,\r\ndemocracy and respect for human rights are objectives\r\nthat unite us. Reform must be our motto.\r\nThe final document adopted yesterday at the\r\nsummit (resolution 60/1) has unquestionably fallen\r\nshort of our expectations. However, it provides us with\r\nguidelines that will enable us to carry out our work.\r\nThe General Assembly must be strengthened.\r\nMore than ever, we need a forum with universal\r\nrepresentation, in which the crucial issues of today’s\r\nworld can be democratically debated. The General\r\nAssembly must provide leadership and political\r\nguidance to the Organization as a whole. In supporting\r\nthe authority of the General Assembly by enabling it to\r\nact more speedily and be more productive, we are\r\nsupporting the very essence of the United Nations.\r\nThe Economic and Social Council must again\r\nbecome a dynamic and influential organ. It must help\r\nus to come together on issues related to trade, finance\r\nand development in an environment free from\r\nprejudice and dogma. The Economic and Social\r\nCouncil should be a privileged, deliberative forum in\r\nour quest for reconciliation between the objectives of\r\nsustainable economic growth and the reduction of the\r\ninequalities caused by asymmetric globalization.\r\nPresident Lula suggested this year, at the summit of the\r\nGroup of Eight (G-8) at Gleneagles, that we could start\r\nraising the profile of the Economic and Social Council\r\nby organizing a high-level segment, with the\r\nparticipation of the Finance Minister of the country\r\nholding the G-8 presidency. The Economic and Social\r\nCouncil must also help to promote peace and stability\r\nin partnership with the Security Council, as provided\r\nfor in Article 65 of the Charter.\r\nThe establishment of a Peacebuilding\r\nCommission will bridge an important institutional gap.\r\nIt will be a link between security and development.\r\nCurrently, there is no such link.\r\nThe structures and mechanisms of the\r\nOrganization in the human rights field must be\r\nimproved and reinforced. We support the creation of a\r\nHuman Rights Council, based on the principles of\r\nuniversality, dialogue and non-selectivity. The\r\nelaboration of an annual global report on human rights\r\nby the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights, covering all\r\ncountries and situations, will help to increase the\r\ncredibility of the United Nations human rights system.\r\nThe Secretary-General has called for better\r\ncoordination in our work to protect victims of grave\r\nand systematic violations of human rights.\r\nInternational cooperation in the field of human rights\r\nand humanitarian assistance must be guided by the\r\nprinciple of collective responsibility. We have\r\nmaintained on several occasions — in our region and\r\nelsewhere — that the principle of non-intervention in\r\nthe domestic affairs of States must be associated with\r\nthe idea of “non-indifference”.\r\nWe have been called upon to deal with new\r\nconcepts, such as human security and the responsibility\r\nto protect. We agree that they merit a proper place in\r\nour system. But it is an illusion to believe that we can\r\ncombat the dysfunctional politics at the root of grave\r\nhuman rights violations by military means alone, or\r\neven by economic sanctions, without fully utilizing\r\ndiplomacy and persuasion.\r\nHuman security is mainly the result of just and\r\nequitable societies that promote and protect human\r\nrights, strengthen democracy and respect the rule of\r\nlaw, while creating opportunities for economic\r\ndevelopment and social justice. The United Nations\r\n6\r\nA/60/PV.9\r\nwas not created to disseminate the notion that order\r\nshould be imposed by force. That extreme expedient\r\ncan be considered only when all other efforts have\r\nbeen exhausted and peaceful solutions have proved not\r\nto be viable. A judgement as to the existence of such\r\nexceptional circumstances must always be a\r\nmultilateral one.\r\nThe Charter foresees two situations in which the\r\nuse of force is permissible: to restore or maintain\r\ninternational peace and security, and in the case of the\r\nright to self-defence. Mixing those two concepts would\r\nblur the meaning of the very tenets of this\r\nOrganization.\r\nSecurity Council reform is the centrepiece of the\r\nreform process in which we are engaged. The vast\r\nmajority of Member States recognize the need to make\r\nthe Security Council more representative and\r\ndemocratic.\r\nAt this historic juncture, no Security Council\r\nreform effort will be meaningful unless it contemplates\r\nan increase in the number of permanent and non-\r\npermanent seats, with developing countries from\r\nAfrica, Latin America and Asia included in both\r\ncategories. We cannot accept the perpetuation of\r\nimbalances that run contrary to the very spirit of\r\nmultilateralism.\r\nAbove all, a more efficient Council must be\r\ncapable of ensuring that its decisions are implemented.\r\nIt is not reasonable to expect the Council to continue to\r\nexpand its agenda and responsibilities without\r\naddressing its democracy deficit.\r\nTwo years ago, President Luiz Inácio Lula da\r\nSilva declared before the Assembly that every nation\r\nthat is committed to democracy at the domestic level\r\nmust strive for more transparent, legitimate and\r\nrepresentative decision-making processes in its\r\nexternal relations. In the same spirit, Secretary-General\r\nKofi Annan pointed out the contradictions to be\r\novercome, stating:\r\n“We are the ones who go around the world\r\nlecturing everybody about democracy. I think it is\r\nabout time we apply it to ourselves, and then\r\nshow that there is effective representation”.\r\nWe are still far from accomplishing the goals of\r\nthe Millennium Declaration. This week’s summit has\r\nstressed the importance of a renewed commitment to\r\ndevelopment assistance and contributed to promoting\r\nuniversal acceptance of the target of 0.7 per cent of\r\ngross national product devoted to official development\r\nassistance. At the same time, we must continue to work\r\non innovative and additional sources of financing. I\r\nnote with satisfaction that since the Summit of World\r\nLeaders for Action against Hunger and Poverty,\r\nconvened last year by President Lula, we have\r\nachieved significant progress. A growing number of\r\nGovernments and non-governmental organizations\r\nhave joined in the effort to eradicate hunger and\r\npoverty. This is the only war in which we are engaged.\r\nThis is the only war we can all win.\r\nThis year we witnessed yet again brutal acts of\r\nterrorism. Innocent civilians, women and children are\r\ntoday victims of groups who stand as adversaries to the\r\nvalues we share. As a country whose identity cannot be\r\ndissociated from the notions of tolerance and diversity,\r\nBrazil rejects in the strongest terms those abhorrent\r\nacts, which go against the very notion of humanity. We\r\nwill continue to lend our support to increased\r\ninternational cooperation in the fight against terrorism\r\nand in the struggle to eliminate its deep-rooted causes.\r\nSuch efforts must be undertaken with due respect\r\nfor international law and human rights. The fight\r\nagainst terrorism cannot be viewed in terms of police\r\nrepression alone. Nor can such repression result in\r\nabsurd and indiscriminate killing like terrorism itself.\r\nDespite the fact that there is no automatic linkage\r\nbetween poverty and terrorism, communities can be\r\nexposed to extreme attitudes by fanatical groups as a\r\nresult of grave social and economic problems,\r\nespecially when associated with the absence of civil\r\nand political liberties. I wish to express Brazil’s\r\nreadiness to work intensively with a view to the prompt\r\nconclusion of a comprehensive convention against\r\nterrorism.\r\nWe recognize the risks of the proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction. At the same time, we\r\ncannot disregard the importance of reducing and\r\ndismantling existing arsenals of all such weapons. We\r\nregret that the seventh Review Conference of the\r\nParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons did not produce tangible results.\r\nTogether with non-proliferation efforts, we must\r\ncontinue to work tirelessly towards nuclear\r\ndisarmament.\r\nIn addition to the challenges I have just referred\r\nto, we are faced with two crises of global scope: the\r\n7\r\nA/60/PV.9\r\npandemic explosion of HIV/AIDS and the serious\r\nthreats posed by climate change. Brazil will continue to\r\npromote the implementation of existing multilateral\r\ninstruments to fight those scourges.\r\nBrazil is committed to reinforcing the strategic\r\nalliance with its main partner in our region —\r\nArgentina — and to the promotion of a prosperous,\r\nintegrated and politically stable South America,\r\nbuilding upon our experience in the Southern Cone\r\nCommon Market (MERCOSUR). We will tirelessly\r\nstrive for MERCOSUR’s advancement in the economic\r\nand political fields. The South American Community\r\nof Nations, which was founded last year in Cuzco,\r\nPeru, can be seen as a driving force for integration in\r\nLatin America and the Caribbean as a whole.\r\nOur efforts in establishing partnerships with other\r\ndeveloping countries go beyond our immediate region.\r\nThe India-Brazil-South Africa Dialogue Forum (IBSA)\r\nhas brought together three large democracies from\r\nAfrica, Asia and Latin America that are keen on\r\ndeepening the economic, political and cultural ties\r\nbetween them and between their regions. Together with\r\nother partners, we have joined in setting up the Group\r\nof Twenty (G-20), which places developing countries\r\nat the centre of agricultural trade negotiations of the\r\nWorld Trade Organization’s Doha round. Thanks to the\r\nrole played by the G-20, it has been possible to\r\ncombine trade liberalization with social justice in the\r\ncontext of the multilateral trading system.\r\nStrengthening our ties with Africa has been a\r\nlong-standing aspiration of Brazil’s. No previous\r\nGovernment has pursued that objective with the\r\nresolve demonstrated by President Lula. Trade and\r\ncooperation between Brazil and Africa have grown\r\nsignificantly. Political dialogue has intensified. We\r\nhave been contributing to the consolidation of peace\r\nand democracy in countries such as Guinea-Bissau and\r\nSao Tome and Principe. We have helped to fight\r\nhunger, develop agriculture and combat the scourge of\r\nHIV/AIDS in various brother countries of Africa.\r\nThe same sense of solidarity inspires us to\r\nparticipate in United Nations peace efforts in Haiti.\r\nThe Brazilian and Latin American presence in Haiti is\r\nunprecedented, in terms of both troops and political\r\ncommitment. We are motivated by three main\r\nobjectives: establishing a safe environment, promoting\r\ndialogue among the various political actors with a view\r\nto a genuine democratic transition and securing\r\neffective international support for institutional, social\r\nand economic reconstruction. Haiti is likely to be the\r\nfirst test case for the Peacebuilding Commission.\r\nBrazil and the Arab world are renewing their ties\r\nof friendship, inspired by strong historical and cultural\r\naffinities. Apart from bilateral initiatives, Brazil has\r\nbeen strengthening its relations with regional\r\ngroupings such as the Gulf Cooperation Council and\r\nthe Arab League. In May 2005, an unprecedented\r\nsummit of South American and Arab States took place\r\nin Brasilia. That pioneering initiative brought together\r\ntwo regions of the developing world in a concrete\r\ndemonstration of harmony of civilizations.\r\nOn several trips to the Middle East, I had the\r\nopportunity to talk to variety of people, including\r\nleaders from Israel and Palestine. They are aware of\r\nBrazil’s willingness to support the work of the Quartet\r\nas a partner for peace. The practice of tolerance and\r\nrespect for others, as well as the harmonious co-\r\nexistence of different communities in our country,\r\nconstitute our comparative advantage. I believe that\r\nconviction is shared by eminent persons and political\r\nleaders from both Israel and Palestine.\r\nAt the beginning of this new chapter in the life of\r\nthe United Nations, Brazil remains committed to the\r\nideals that led to the creation of the only Organization\r\nof universal scope, the only body that can guarantee a\r\nfuture of peace and prosperity — not for the few, but\r\nfor all.\r\nThe President: I now call on Her Excellency\r\nMs. Condoleezza Rice, Secretary of State of the United\r\nStates of America.\r\nMs. Rice (United States of America): On behalf\r\nof President Bush and all of the American people,\r\nwelcome to New York City.\r\nIn the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, my fellow\r\ncitizens have experienced the compassion of the United\r\nNations. I want to thank Secretary-General Annan for\r\nmobilizing the support of this institution. I also want to\r\nthank the representatives of the 126 countries that have\r\noffered assistance in our relief efforts. The United\r\nStates will never forget their generosity in our time of\r\nneed.\r\nIn moments of tumultuous historical change,\r\nleaders must become architects of a better world. We\r\nmust survey the new international landscape, lay firm\r\nfoundations of moral principle and build institutions\r\n8\r\nA/60/PV.9\r\nthat reflect our unique moment in history. It is those\r\ninstitutions that enable citizens of conviction to lead us\r\never closer to the ideals of justice that stir every soul:\r\nthe universal desire for security, prosperity, liberty and\r\ndignity.\r\nSixty years ago was just such a time of\r\ntransformation. After one of the greatest cataclysms in\r\nworld history, the United States joined with visionary\r\nbuilders from over 50 countries to create the United\r\nNations. We placed the enduring principles of human\r\nrights and fundamental freedoms at the foundation of\r\nthe United Nations Charter. We built an institution that\r\nhas helped to support a peaceful world order for six\r\ndecades. Today, however, with the end of the cold war\r\nand the rise of globalization and the emergence of new\r\nthreats, the very terrain of international politics has\r\nshifted beneath our feet. In this new world we must\r\nagain embrace the challenge of building for the future.\r\nThe time to reform the United Nations is now. We\r\nmust seize this opportunity together. Chapter I, Article\r\n1, of the Charter of the United Nations proclaims the\r\nfour purposes of the United Nations, great aspirations\r\nthat have stood the test of time. But consider what\r\ndifferent forms they take today, in 2005, as opposed to\r\n1945, when they were first declared.\r\nThe first purpose of the United Nations is to help\r\nmaintain international peace and security. In 1945 the\r\nmost serious threats to peace and security emerged\r\nbetween States, and were largely defined by their\r\nborders. Today, however, the greatest threats we face\r\nemerge within States, and melt through their borders:\r\ntransnational threats like terrorism and the proliferation\r\nof weapons, pandemic disease and trafficking in human\r\nbeings.\r\nThe second purpose of this institution, as written\r\nin the United Nations Charter, is to develop friendly\r\nrelations among nations, based on equal rights and the\r\nself-determination of all peoples. In 1945, a life of\r\nliberty and dignity was more an aspiration than a\r\nreality for a majority of the world’s people. Today,\r\nhowever, more nations than ever have enshrined the\r\nprinciples of democracy and human rights — a true\r\nmoral triumph that will be complete only when all\r\nindividuals are secure in their basic freedoms.\r\nThe third purpose of the United Nations is to\r\nachieve international cooperation in solving\r\ninternational problems. In 1945, the fear was that\r\nstrong, aggressive States, eager and able to expand\r\ntheir frontiers with force, would be the primary cause\r\nof international problems. Today, however, it is clear\r\nthat weak and poorly governed States, unwilling or\r\nincapable of ruling their countries with justice, are the\r\nprincipal source of global crises, from civil war and\r\ngenocide to extreme poverty and humanitarian disaster.\r\nThe final purpose of the United Nations, as the\r\nCharter states, is to be a centre for harmonizing the\r\nactions of nations in the attainment of common ends.\r\nIn 1945, the world’s leaders joined together to build an\r\ninstitutional partnership that could address the shared\r\nchallenges of their time. Today, faced with the realities\r\nof a new world, we must transform the United Nations\r\nto meet the shared challenges of our time.\r\nThe Members of this body must work together to\r\nstrengthen security in a world threatened by stateless\r\nextremists. Today, I call on the nations of the world to\r\nratify the comprehensive convention on terrorism. No\r\ncause, no movement and no grievance can justify the\r\nintentional killing of innocent civilians and non-\r\ncombatants. That is unacceptable by any moral\r\nstandard. It is time for every Member of the United\r\nNations to outlaw acts of international terrorism.\r\nWe must also work together to promote\r\nprosperity and development in a world of great\r\npotential. The United States is committed to the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. And at the Monterrey\r\nConference three years ago all nations agreed that\r\ndevelopment must be a two-way street. Donor\r\ncountries have a responsibility to increase their\r\nassistance to developing nations. And developing\r\nnations have a responsibility to govern justly, advance\r\neconomic liberty and invest in their people. The\r\nMonterrey Consensus is working.\r\nNow is not the time to revert to old, failed\r\nthinking about development. Countries representing\r\nthree quarters of the developing world’s population are\r\non a pace to meet the targets of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration by 2015.\r\nAnd, as President Bush said on Wednesday, the\r\nUnited States is prepared to take new action to\r\naccelerate this progress: we will eliminate all tariffs\r\nand subsidies that distort free trade — as other nations\r\ndo the same.\r\nMembers of the United Nations must work\r\ntogether as well to support democracy in a world of\r\nexpanding liberty. To advance this common purpose, in\r\n9\r\nA/60/PV.9\r\n2004 President Bush proposed the creation of a\r\ndemocracy fund. With the broad support of this body,\r\nwe have made it a reality. The Fund is now receiving\r\ndonations in cash and in kind from countries large and\r\nsmall that wish to help other nations lay the\r\nfoundations of democracy. Showing its leadership as\r\nthe world’s largest democracy, India made the generous\r\nopening pledge of $10 million.\r\nNow, to be sure, when speaking about democracy,\r\nthe United States has every reason for humility. After\r\nall, it was only in my lifetime that America guaranteed\r\nthe right to vote for all its citizens. Obviously, the path\r\nto democracy is long and imperfect and different for\r\nevery nation. But the principles of democracy are\r\nuniversal, as is the desire for them. And the United\r\nNations must support every country that embraces the\r\nchallenge of self-government. In Afghanistan, Iraq,\r\nLebanon, the Palestinian territories and throughout the\r\nworld, peoples who want to build democracy deserve\r\nour help.\r\nThe many goals we share are great indeed. And\r\nthe United Nations has a major role to play in their\r\nachievement. But for this institution to become an\r\nengine of change in the twenty-first century, it must\r\nnow change itself. The United Nations must launch a\r\nlasting revolution of reform.\r\nThe United Nations summit declaration\r\n(resolution 60/1), which every head of State endorsed\r\nthis week, expresses a global consensus on the fact that\r\nreform is imperative. I want to thank former General\r\nAssembly President Ping for his tireless hard work.\r\nOur challenge now, under President Eliasson’s\r\nleadership, is to enact the vital reforms that will make\r\nthe United Nations more accountable to its Members,\r\nmore suited to new challenges and more faithful to its\r\nfounding purposes.\r\nThe United States welcomes the commitment of\r\nall leaders to establish a new Peacebuilding\r\nCommission. Now, we must embrace the difficult task\r\nof implementing that vision. A Peacebuilding\r\nCommission should plan for post-conflict missions\r\nbefore crises erupt. And it must help to coordinate\r\nreconstruction efforts after the fighting stops. In a\r\nworld threatened by civil strife, the United Nations\r\nneeds to be better prepared to help countries rebuild in\r\nthe aftermath of conflict.\r\nWe are also pleased that the world’s leaders have\r\nrecognized the importance of establishing a new\r\nHuman Rights Council. But it will take a lot of hard\r\nwork in the coming months to realize that goal. The\r\nHuman Rights Council must have fewer members, less\r\npolitics and more credibility. And it should never,\r\nnever, empower brutal dictatorships to sit in judgement\r\nof responsible democracies. The Human Rights\r\nCouncil must have the moral authority to condemn all\r\nviolators of human rights, even those that sit among us\r\nin this Hall.\r\nFinally, we welcome the promise of the world’s\r\nleaders to make the United Nations a more effective\r\nand a more principled institution. As President Bush\r\nsaid on Wednesday (see A/60/PV.2), the United\r\nNations must stand for integrity and live by the high\r\nstandards it sets for others. For the United Nations to\r\nchampion democracy more legitimately, we must\r\nincrease the transparency and the accountability of this\r\ninstitution. For the United Nations to promote\r\nprosperity more credibly, tougher ethics rules and\r\ngreater internal oversight are needed to ensure the\r\nhighest professional standards. And to make the United\r\nNations relevant to the challenges of today, the purpose\r\nand the performance of all United Nations programmes\r\nmust be reviewed thoroughly, consistently and\r\ncomprehensively.\r\nOur fellow citizens deserve a United Nations that\r\ncommands their respect and is worthy of their hard-\r\nearned tax dollars. In a democracy, leaders must be\r\nable to justify that their people’s money is indeed being\r\nwell spent.\r\nReal progress on those fundamental reforms will\r\nprove that the United Nations can address greater\r\nissues of change, in particular the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council. We want that important body to\r\nreflect the world as it is in 2005, not as it was in 1945.\r\nThe United States is open to expanding the Security\r\nCouncil. We have long supported a permanent seat for\r\nJapan. And we believe that developing countries\r\ndeserve greater representation on that body. All this\r\nwould make for a more effective Security Council.\r\nAnd the Security Council must be effective. It\r\nmust be able to deal with great challenges such as\r\nterrorism and nuclear proliferation, especially when it\r\nfaces real threats and when countries such as Iran\r\nthreaten the effectiveness of the global non-\r\nproliferation regime. When diplomacy has been\r\n10\r\nA/60/PV.9\r\nexhausted, the Security Council must become involved.\r\nQuestions about Iran’s nuclear activities remain\r\nunanswered, despite repeated efforts by the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency. And after\r\nagreeing to negotiate with Europe, Iran unilaterally\r\nwalked away from the talks and restarted its nuclear\r\nprogrammes. Iran should return to the negotiations\r\nwith the European Union three and abandon forever its\r\nplans for a nuclear-weapons capability.\r\nThe experience of recent years has reinforced the\r\nuniversal truth that international institutions are only as\r\nstrong and effective and relevant as their members\r\nchoose to make them. The United Nations is no\r\ndifferent.\r\nThe United States believes in a United Nations\r\nthat is strong and effective. And we have ambitious\r\nhopes for its future.\r\nSo in this year, as the United Nations marks its\r\nsixtieth anniversary, let us recommit ourselves to\r\nprincipled action. Let us embrace the same spirit of\r\ncreation that moved the builders and leaders of 1945.\r\nAnd let us reform this great institution to meet the\r\nchallenges of a new era.\r\nAddress by Mr. Olusegun Obasanjo, President of the\r\nFederal Republic of Nigeria\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Federal Republic of\r\nNigeria.\r\nMr. Olusegun Obasanjo, President of the Federal\r\nRepublic of Nigeria, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Olusegun Obasanjo,\r\nPresident of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, and to\r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Obasanjo: On behalf of the\r\nGovernment and the people of Nigeria, and in my\r\ncapacity as the current Chairman of the African Union\r\n(AU), I would like to extend my sincere\r\ncongratulations to you, Sir, and your country, Sweden,\r\non your election as President of the sixtieth session of\r\nthe General Assembly. I should also commend you for\r\nthe leadership you provided at the High-level Plenary\r\nMeeting over the past three days. The theme you have\r\nchosen for this year’s general debate — “For a stronger\r\nand more effective United Nations: the follow-up and\r\nimplementation of the High-level Plenary Meeting in\r\nSeptember 2005” — is indeed most appropriate and\r\ntimely, as it encapsulates our common desire for a\r\nrenewed and invigorated Organization. I assure you of\r\nthe full support and cooperation of the Nigerian\r\ndelegation. I would also like to express appreciation to\r\nyour predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Jean Ping of the\r\nRepublic of Gabon, for his leadership and dedication.\r\nI commend the Secretary-General, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Kofi Annan, for his tenacity and\r\nleadership qualities, which sustain the role of the\r\nUnited Nations and underlie the current reform process\r\nof the United Nations system.\r\nYou, Sir, have assumed the presidency of the\r\nsixtieth session at a time when the United Nations is\r\nwitnessing epoch-making historic events. The session\r\nhas in the last three days taken the assessment and\r\nreview of the five-year implementation of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). Besides\r\npursuing the reform process, launched by the report of\r\nthe Secretary-General’s High-level Panel on Threats,\r\nChallenges and Change, entitled “A more secure world:\r\nour shared responsibility” (A/59/565), and the\r\nSecretary-General’s own report entitled “In larger\r\nfreedom” (A/59/2005), the session will also mark the\r\ntenth year of implementation of the Declaration and\r\nPlatform for Action of the Fourth World Conference on\r\nWomen and the Declaration and Programme of Action\r\nof the World Summit for Social Development, held in\r\nBeijing and Copenhagen, respectively.\r\nI have no doubt, Sir, that, with your vast\r\nexperience in diplomacy and statecraft, you will pilot\r\nthe session to a successful conclusion.\r\nThe United Nations continues to play a pivotal\r\nrole in the lives of all people with its vast network of\r\nactivities. In this regard, Nigeria is firmly anchored in\r\nits belief, commitment to and support for the\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations and the protection\r\nof its ideals, in particular, the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, prevention and\r\nprotection of human rights and fundamental freedoms\r\nand promotion of international cooperation in solving\r\ninternational economic, social, cultural and\r\nhumanitarian problems. There remains so much to do\r\nin these areas that only a rejuvenated United Nations\r\ncan optimally respond to the challenges.\r\n11\r\nA/60/PV.9\r\nLast year, the situation in the Sudan, including\r\nthe Darfur region, was a cause of serious concern to\r\nAfrica and indeed to the international community.\r\nHowever, with the combined efforts of the United\r\nNations, the African Union and the Intergovernmental\r\nAuthority on Development (IGAD), we have managed\r\nto usher in an era of hope in that country. A\r\nComprehensive Peace Agreement has been signed and\r\nimplemented on the long-drawn north-south conflict,\r\nand the fifth round of inter-Sudanese peace talks on\r\nDarfur resumed in Abuja in June 2005 and is currently\r\nin progress. I take this opportunity to once again appeal\r\nto the parties to shed their hard-line approach to\r\nnegotiation and adopt a policy of give-and-take in the\r\ninterest of posterity.\r\nThe international community has demonstrated\r\ntremendous goodwill in facilitating the peace process\r\nin Darfur, and this must be sustained by the parties.\r\nSimilarly, it is equally important to maintain and\r\nsustain the current level of peace between northern and\r\nsouthern Sudan. In this connection, I salute the courage\r\nof the late Mr. John Garang in leading the southern\r\nSudanese people into reaching an accord with the\r\nGovernment of the Sudan. We regret the death of\r\nMr. John Garang and extend our heartfelt sympathy to\r\nhis family and to the Government and people of the\r\nSudan.\r\nThe situation in Somalia continues to give hope\r\nto the ability of the contending parties to resolve their\r\ndifferences in the higher interest of their beloved\r\ncountry. The African Union will continue to play an\r\nactive role in this regard, together with the IGAD and\r\ncountries in the region to help Somalis realize their\r\ndream of a united and peaceful country.\r\nIn the West African subregion, the African Union\r\nand the Economic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS) have continued to remain fully engaged\r\nwith efforts to find a lasting solution to the crisis in\r\nCôte d’Ivoire. In this connection, we acknowledge the\r\nvaluable support of the United Nations to the peace\r\nprocess. We appreciate the efforts deployed by\r\nPresident Thabo Mbeki of South Africa to mediate in\r\nCôte d’Ivoire on behalf of the AU. In view of President\r\nMbeki’s report of 30 August 2005 and the recent\r\ndeclaration that the elections scheduled for October\r\nmay not take place, it would be necessary for\r\nECOWAS, and then the AU, to revisit the situation in\r\nCôte d’Ivoire. We will do so in full consultation with\r\nthe Secretary-General and the Security Council of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nWe commend the evolving return to democracy,\r\nreconciliation, security and development in Togo, and\r\nwe appreciate the efforts of the United Nations, the\r\nEuropean Union (EU) and other development partners\r\nin this regard. The elections in Guinea-Bissau have\r\ncome and gone. The reconciliation process that will\r\nprecede the inauguration of the newly elected President\r\nhas begun. Both Togo and Guinea-Bissau will need\r\nsubstantial support to build their economies, without\r\nwhich their situations could deteriorate. We call on the\r\nUnited Nations and its institutions, along with the\r\nEuropean Union and other development partners, to\r\nhelp.\r\nThe AU stands resolutely by its policy of not\r\naccepting to include among its members any\r\nGovernment that emanates from outside a Constitution\r\nand democratic processes. That is the situation now\r\nwith regard to Mauritania. We are of course\r\nmaintaining a constructive dialogue and recommending\r\nan expeditious return to democracy, including national\r\nreconciliation and the necessary reforms and\r\nlegislation to move the country forward.\r\nWe welcome the elections in Burundi and the\r\nGovernment resulting from that election, which is\r\nbased on the newly agreed Constitution. We appreciate\r\nthe role played by all the friends of Burundi who\r\nhelped to make that happen. Like Togo and Guinea-\r\nBissau, Burundi will need special assistance to be able\r\nto consolidate its reconciliation and democracy.\r\nWe applaud the Secretary-General’s proposal\r\ncontained in his recent report on the situation in Sierra\r\nLeone. In particular, we welcome his intention to keep\r\nthe security, political, humanitarian and human rights\r\nsituation under close review. The AU is also pleased\r\nabout the six-month extension of the mandate of the\r\nUnited Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL)\r\nand recognition of the need for a strong United Nations\r\npresence in the country after the withdrawal of\r\nUNAMSIL. We believe the presence of the United\r\nNations system will foster confidence and guarantee\r\nstability during the critical months following its\r\nwithdrawal. We call upon the international community\r\nto continue to extend assistance to the Government of\r\nSierra Leone in its efforts to develop a credible,\r\neffective and sustainable police force, armed forces and\r\n12\r\nA/60/PV.9\r\njudiciary, as well as rebuild damaged infrastructure\r\nnecessary to revamp economic and social activities.\r\nThe peace process in Liberia is in its most critical\r\nphase, and calls for the cooperation of all parties in the\r\ncountry. The AU is closely monitoring developments\r\nthere. We are optimistic that the elections scheduled for\r\nnext month will lead to a successful transition. In that\r\nconnection, the use of propaganda to direct attention to\r\nissues unrelated to the conduct of the forthcoming\r\npresidential elections should be avoided and resisted.\r\nIt is pertinent for me to repeat here what I said\r\nbefore on the issue of Charles Taylor, who was\r\nencouraged to leave Liberia in order to avoid a\r\nbloodbath. He was encouraged by the leaders of Africa\r\nat the level of the Economic Community of West\r\nAfrican States (ECOWAS) and the AU to voluntarily\r\ngive up power and leave his country, in the interests of\r\nLiberia, West Africa and Africa, and of world peace\r\nand security. He was escorted to Nigeria by President\r\nKuffor, who was the Chairman of ECOWAS at the\r\ntime, and Presidents Mbeki and Chissano, who were,\r\nrespectively, the outgoing and incoming Chairmen of\r\nthe AU. We believe that the cause of peace in Liberia\r\nwill be served if Charles Taylor stays away, or is kept\r\naway, from Liberia during the transition or early stages\r\nof nation-rebuilding in that country following the\r\nelections.\r\nWith regard to the Great Lakes region, we have\r\ntaken note of the realistic decision of the two houses of\r\nParliament in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to\r\nextend, for a period of six months, the transition period\r\nthat expired on 30 June 2005, in accordance with the\r\nprovisions of the Global and All Inclusive Agreement,\r\nsigned in Pretoria in December 2002, and in line with\r\narticle 196 of the transitional Constitution. The AU is\r\ndetermined to continue to work with the United\r\nNations to facilitate the peaceful resolution of the\r\nconflict. In that connection, we reiterate the AU’s call\r\nto all parties to the conflict in the Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo to respect that decision. We hope that this\r\nwill ensure that the elections provided for by the\r\nAgreement take place satisfactorily. With the\r\ncooperation of all parties concerned and the active\r\nsupport of the international community, we are hopeful\r\nfor an orderly return to normality and the restoration of\r\npeace and stability in the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo.\r\nNigeria’s commitment to nuclear non-\r\nproliferation has never been in doubt. We have always\r\nsupported the view that it should involve all States.\r\nDisarmament conventions merit the support of all\r\nStates, small or large, nuclear or non-nuclear. My\r\ndelegation regrets the failure of the 2005 Review\r\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We should not allow\r\nthe relative stability in our world to lure us into the\r\nbelief that the need for total disarmament no longer\r\nexists. Nor can we separate disarmament from non-\r\nproliferation. Through that we can achieve the goal of\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations of saving succeeding\r\ngenerations from the scourge of war and destruction.\r\nThe availability and wide circulation of small\r\narms and light weapons poses the greatest danger to\r\npeace and security, especially in our region. Those\r\nweapons have helped to prolong conflicts and to\r\nundermine stability, social peace and security. They\r\nhave also wreaked devastation on the economies of\r\naffected States. Nigeria therefore welcomes the\r\nagreement of June 2005 on an international instrument\r\nthat would enable States to identify and trace illicit\r\nsmall arms and light weapons in a timely and reliable\r\nmanner. However, that is only a stop-gap measure.\r\nWhat we need is a legally binding international\r\ninstrument that will regulate, control and monitor the\r\nillicit trade in small arms, including their transfer to\r\nnon-State actors. By pronouncing ourselves clearly and\r\npositively in that regard, Member States would send a\r\nmessage of their resolve not to encourage or condone\r\nthe diversion of those weapons to illicit networks.\r\nTerrorism remains a great threat to peace and\r\nsecurity at the local, national and international levels.\r\nIt is inimical to the rule of law, human rights,\r\ndemocracy and freedom. It impedes sustainable\r\ndevelopment through the destabilization of States,\r\nparticularly emerging democracies and nations in\r\ntransition. Nigeria reaffirms its conviction that\r\nterrorism cannot be justified under any circumstance,\r\nand should therefore be combated in all its forms and\r\nmanifestations. To that end, my country welcomes the\r\nadoption, on 13 April 2005, of the International\r\nConvention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear\r\nTerrorism, and commits itself to work with others to\r\nmobilize the political will necessary to ensure the early\r\nentry into force of a comprehensive convention on\r\nterrorism. We also welcome the Security Council\r\n13\r\nA/60/PV.9\r\nresolution against the incitement of terrorism and\r\nterrorist acts.\r\nAs we embark upon a review of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), the challenges of hunger,\r\npoverty and disease continue to override our\r\nconscience as well as the conscience of the\r\ninternational community. It was our concern regarding\r\nthose challenges that compelled African leaders to\r\ncommit themselves to the ideals of the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), whose\r\nprincipal objective was to encourage good governance,\r\ndemocracy, the rule of law, security, stability and\r\nmacro-economic reforms, among other things. Four\r\nyears on, NEPAD has made some modest progress that\r\nreflects our determination to make Africa work for\r\nAfricans in an interdependent world and towards the\r\nachievement of sustainable development.\r\nHowever, notwithstanding our efforts, poverty\r\nremains endemic in Africa. The dangerous correlation\r\nbetween grinding poverty and alienation from\r\ngovernment as a veritable source of political instability\r\non the continent leaves much to be desired. We are,\r\nhowever, grateful for the renewed commitment of our\r\ndevelopment partners to redeem their ODA pledges,\r\nincrease foreign direct investment, remodel trading\r\narchitecture and provide better and effective technical\r\nand structural support to our efforts. We have also\r\nbegun to emphasize well-managed and development-\r\nfocused tourism as a veritable source of wealth and job\r\ncreation and an effective contributor to several of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs).\r\nWe remain committed to providing the necessary\r\nconducive environment that will encourage investment\r\nand generate wealth and liberate our peoples from\r\npoverty. Our agricultural policies and practices are\r\ntailored to expansion capable of feeding our people,\r\nexporting some of the produce and providing raw\r\nmaterials for our industries.\r\nThe pivotal role of trade as a veritable engine for\r\neconomic growth cannot be overstated. Access to\r\nmarkets of developed countries, withdrawal of\r\nagricultural subsidies as well as elimination of\r\ndistorting tariffs are measures that should be addressed\r\ndecisively by our industrialized development partners\r\nto enhance the ability of developing countries to\r\nbenefit from trade. The successful completion of the\r\nDoha multilateral trade negotiations would be a litmus\r\ntest of our resolve.\r\nI wish to recognize the statesmanship displayed\r\nby members of the Paris Club, which recently granted\r\nAfrican countries, among others, debt cancellation and\r\ndebt relief. We urge the international community to\r\nadopt an effective, comprehensive, durable and\r\ndevelopment-oriented solution to the debt problem of\r\ndeveloping countries, which has become for them a cog\r\nin the wheel of development, growth and progress.\r\nSince 1986, the HIV/AIDS epidemic has rapidly\r\ngrown into a monster all over the world. In tackling the\r\nscourge, many African countries, including Nigeria,\r\nhave adopted the multisectoral response strategy\r\nrecommended by the United Nations.\r\nNigeria has followed with great interest and\r\nparticipated actively in the various proposals on the\r\nreform of our Organization, the United Nations. We\r\nstrongly support the proposal for the establishment of a\r\nPeacebuilding Commission, since this will go a long\r\nway in filling a yawning gap in the consolidation of\r\nsustainable peace and security in post-conflict\r\ncountries, particularly in Africa.\r\nWe also support the proposed Human Rights\r\nCouncil. However, we do not believe that the mere\r\nexchange of the Commission on Human Rights for the\r\nproposed Council would address perceived deficiencies\r\nin the promotion and protection of human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms, unless the proposed Council\r\nadopts a new culture of treating all cases of violation\r\nwith a standard yardstick capable of attracting wide\r\nsupport and generating confidence.\r\nAs far as the proposal for the expansion of the\r\nSecurity Council is concerned, Nigeria has consistently\r\nsupported, and as a member of the African Union\r\nFollow-up Mechanism remains faithful to, the\r\nimplementation of the Ezulwini Consensus. We have\r\ndone so without any second thought or national\r\ncolourations with the sole aim of achieving the best for\r\nAfrica in the obligatory negotiations with other regions\r\nand Members of the United Nations, whose support\r\nAfrica must necessarily attract to achieve its\r\nfundamental requirement of increasing the number and\r\nquality of its membership on the Security Council.\r\nFinally, as Chairman of the African Union for the\r\npast year, I have had the privilege of working closely\r\nwith brother African heads of State or Government in\r\ntransforming the African Union into a truly potent and\r\neffective organization for the development of African\r\npeoples. Through our collective efforts, we have\r\n14\r\nA/60/PV.9\r\nbrought hope and confidence to Africa. We do not,\r\nunder any circumstances, intend to waver in this\r\nrenewed commitment of repositioning Africa for peace,\r\nsecurity, stability, growth, sustainable development and\r\nenduring democracy. I am optimistic that with the\r\ninvaluable cooperation of the United Nations, our\r\ndevelopment partners and the international community\r\nwith respect to the MDGs and other NEPAD initiatives,\r\nthe African Union will successfully pursue the noble\r\nobjectives enshrined in its Constitutive Act.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Federal\r\nRepublic of Nigeria for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Olusegun Obasanjo, President of the Federal\r\nRepublic of Nigeria, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Martín Torrijos, President of the\r\nRepublic of Panama\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Martín Torrijos,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Panama.\r\nMr. Martín Torrijos, President of the Republic of\r\nPanama, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Martín Torrijos, President\r\nof the Republic of Panama, and to invite him to address\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Torrijos (spoke in Spanish): Allow\r\nme, Sir, to express the congratulations of the\r\nGovernment of Panama on your election to preside\r\nover this historic session of the General Assembly.\r\nI would like to congratulate warmly the\r\nSecretary-General for the dedicated manner in which\r\nhe has undertaken the difficult task of reforming the\r\nUnited Nations so as to ensure that it will be able to\r\naddress the challenges of the twenty-first century.\r\nI wish to express my special thanks in particular\r\nto the outgoing President of the General Assembly,\r\nMr. Jean Ping, for his efforts in leading the\r\nconsultations and reflections in order to attain\r\nagreement and, in particular, for placing his trust in the\r\ndelegation of Panama in order to facilitate this process.\r\nThe United Nations was conceived on a\r\nfundamental premise, that of the legal equality of\r\nStates, which at the time was more of an aspiration\r\nthan a reality. However, much progress has been made\r\non the path towards building a world where the power\r\nof reason, justice and dialogue settle disputes between\r\nnations and not military or economic power.\r\nMy country can confirm that the United Nations\r\nand the international community have created effective\r\ninstruments and institutions to ensure that equality\r\nprevails over the deep divide between the\r\nindustrialized countries and the developing countries.\r\nPanama has gained full control of its territory and\r\nrecovered the Canal thanks to its visionary leaders, but\r\nalso to a large extent due to the implementation of the\r\nprinciples of international law that the United Nations\r\nhas staunchly defended and through the support of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nPanama can never remain indifferent to the\r\ndestiny of the Organization. As one of the signatories\r\nof the Charter and beneficiary of its institutions,\r\nPanama understands the need to adapt the Organization\r\nto the reality of our time. The formulas used for\r\nbringing this adaptation about must focus on increased\r\nparticipation of States in the Organization’s decisions\r\nand must aim at the full legal equality of all States, an\r\naspiration that has yet to become a reality, but which,\r\nnevertheless, remains the mainstay of the United\r\nNations.\r\nWe cannot afford to delay in bringing about a\r\nradical change in the rules that currently govern\r\neconomic relations among States, because, while in the\r\nUnited Nations we are slowly progressing towards\r\nequality and agreement, the world is rushing towards\r\nan abyss of inequality and disagreement.\r\nDespite the efforts undertaken by a number of the\r\nleast developed countries to adapt their institutions to\r\nmodels that were supposed to help reduce inequalities,\r\npractice has shown that there is no one-size-fits-all\r\nsolution that can be applied across the board to all\r\ncountries. Indeed, the application of rigid solutions has\r\ncontributed rather to a further widening of the gap\r\nbetween countries.\r\nAmid such uncertainty concerning our public\r\ndevelopment policies, unforeseeable events — natural\r\ndisasters, epidemics and, currently, the rising price of\r\noil, an indispensable driver of production and\r\n15\r\nA/60/PV.9\r\ngrowth — have completely altered the balance of\r\nforeign and domestic affairs. Moreover, it is unclear\r\nwhether the negative impact those events have had on\r\nour economies will vanish automatically once the\r\nphenomena that have created them disappear. Indeed, it\r\nappears that we are caught in a vicious and hopeless\r\ncircle: the differences that have led us to accept urgent\r\nchanges have, in turn, created more difference and\r\ngreater resentment in the least developed countries,\r\nwith more failed States and therefore greater insecurity\r\nin the global village.\r\nThe price of oil for non-producing countries has\r\nfurther deepened that divide, as it takes away from the\r\nresources necessary for their development. To give an\r\nexample, over the past three years the cost of net\r\nimports of oil for Panama has shown a 250 per cent\r\nincrease. That is the situation for the majority of the\r\ncountries in our region, as well as for those in other\r\ncontinents, with very few exceptions. Countries like\r\nours that are net importers of oil have to produce more\r\nin order to export more and thereby to be able to\r\nimport the same number of barrels of oil.\r\nRising oil prices are due to the sharp increase in\r\ndemand by the major consumers, which have not\r\nadopted effective policies to reduce their dependency\r\non hydrocarbons.\r\nEven more serious is the fact that fuel prices have\r\nrisen so dramatically and have wreaked such havoc in a\r\nnumber of countries they threaten to create political\r\ninstability and provoke economic crises.\r\nIt is only with the technical and financial\r\ncooperation of developed countries — in particular in\r\nthe field of energy — that we can achieve the transfer\r\nof technologies that can help us to produce cleaner and\r\ncheaper energy. As a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol,\r\nPanama has submitted projects with clearly identified\r\nrequests for financing that deserve to be supported by\r\nmultilateral funding institutions and by those countries\r\nthat cause the greatest pollution.\r\nEnergy dependency is compounded by the\r\ndifficulties that countries face in importing technology\r\nand holding on to their human resources, in particular\r\nthe most qualified among them. Workers that have\r\nmigrated to richer countries send home financial\r\nremittances that can temporarily supplement the\r\nincome generated by our national economies but that,\r\nin the long term, prevent us from exploiting our most\r\nimportant asset — our most highly qualified human\r\nresources. Those workers contribute to the innovative\r\ngrowth that our nations require. The result is the\r\naccumulation of innovative capital and productive\r\nlabour in the most developed countries, with a\r\ncorresponding impoverishment of countries most in\r\nneed of those resources, generating yet greater\r\ndivergence and more inequalities. In other words, the\r\nexodus of human capital, while providing a source of\r\ncurrency in the short term hampers our countries’ long-\r\nterm development.\r\nOur countries must be able to compete even in\r\nthe absence of a level playing field. We must as a\r\npriority put an end to tariff barriers to trade, which\r\nprevent developing countries from putting their\r\nproducts on the markets of rich countries and from\r\nhaving access to better technology, not only productive\r\nbut also information technology.\r\nAs a result of the widening gap with regard to\r\naccess to technology, our countries have fallen behind\r\nin their efforts to advance and to ensure the well-being\r\nof their people. Moreover, it has served to perpetuate\r\nthe differences in living conditions between developed\r\ncountries and those that are still struggling to emerge\r\nfrom underdevelopment.\r\nThe situation is similar with regard to the\r\nobstacles that impede access to basic medicines to\r\nimprove public health in areas as sensitive as AIDS\r\nand malaria. Those obstacles take the form of patents\r\nthat grant quasi-monopolistic powers to the\r\npharmaceutical companies that produce those\r\nmedicines.\r\nIn addition, the already devastating differences\r\nthat exist between States are even greater than the\r\nstatistics currently show, using simplistic and rigid\r\ncriteria such as per capita income, which does not\r\naccurately reflect reality. Forty per cent of the\r\nPanamanian population lives below the poverty line,\r\nbut we are nevertheless statistically designated as a\r\nmedium- to high-income country and therefore our\r\naccess to external aid is very limited. Figures provide\r\nonly a lifeless snapshot of a country. Behind that, or\r\nperhaps in spite of that, there is a human reality: that of\r\nmen, women and children who suffer from hunger and\r\nconstraints. Those people are not even aware of the\r\nexistence of the United Nations, but they are fully\r\nentitled to the benefits of modernity. Instead, their way\r\nof life is being relentlessly handed down from one\r\ngeneration to the next.\r\n16\r\nA/60/PV.9\r\nThe international community has demonstrated\r\ngreat resolve in the fight against terrorism and\r\ninsecurity and it is prepared to make even further\r\nsacrifices, if necessary. However, it is time to\r\nrecognize that hunger and poverty also undermine the\r\ninternal security of our countries and endanger\r\ndemocracy. It appears that the world only responds to\r\nheadlines, but every day poor countries suffer from\r\nmisfortunes and constraints that do not produce\r\nheadlines for the tragic reason that the international\r\ncommunity seems indifferent in some cases or has\r\nquite simply resigned itself to them.\r\nThere is no point in asking a developing country\r\nto rectify so many deficiencies within a reasonable\r\ntime frame if it cannot even have access to funds on\r\nmore favourable and predictable terms than those\r\ncurrently being offered by the international capital\r\nmarket.\r\nImproving the quality of life of our citizens — a\r\ngoal that the United Nations has set itself — depends\r\non the increasing use of physical and financial capital,\r\nas well as the national labour force, in activities that\r\ngenerate growth and promote innovation. The material\r\nwell-being of our societies will be achieved when more\r\npeople work and each of those workers is more\r\nproductive.\r\nOur countries are not begging for favours. What\r\nwe are demanding is a more level playing field. The\r\nmarkets of industrialized countries are blocked by\r\nprotectionist tariffs and by non-tariff barriers, which\r\nimpede access to them by the rest of the world. The\r\nmost developed countries pursue agricultural policies\r\nthat seriously exacerbate poverty in developing\r\ncountries. For one thing, their domestic production\r\nreceives billions of dollars in subsidies. The surplus\r\nthus created is then dumped on world markets at prices\r\nthat significantly reduce the income of the traditional\r\nexporting countries.\r\nTherefore Panama welcomes the commitment of\r\nthe United States of America, announced last week\r\nfrom this very rostrum by its President, to eliminate all\r\nsubsidies that — as he himself recognized — have\r\ncreated poverty in many countries. If all those\r\ncountries that subsidize their products to the detriment\r\nof free trade were to adopt here a similar commitment\r\nand to implement it swiftly, then the United Nations\r\nwould have solid grounds to celebrate its sixtieth\r\nanniversary as an historic and highly significant\r\noccasion.\r\nFor its part, Panama reiterates today that the\r\ncanal linking the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans will\r\nremain open and secure, demonstrating the high degree\r\nof efficiency to which the international community is\r\naccustomed. We have analysed the needs of\r\ninternational trade and, aware of Panama’s role in the\r\nera of globalization, we shall take a definitive decision\r\non the canal’s extension through a national referendum.\r\nOur countries should not be condemned to\r\nstagger from one crisis to the next. By emphasizing the\r\nneed to combat the alarming levels of poverty and\r\nabject poverty, humankind’s collective conscience will\r\nemerge in favour of development and progress. This\r\nOrganization was created at the end of the cruelest war\r\nof all times in order to protect humankind from the\r\nhorrors of a similar conflict and to ensure that peace\r\nand harmony would prevail throughout the world.\r\nPanama welcomes the progress that has been\r\nmade towards that goal and rejects any attempt to delay\r\nthe application of peaceful solutions to regions that\r\ncontinue to suffer a high level of political tension that\r\nseriously endangers peace. That is our vision of the\r\ninequalities of a society founded on the principles of\r\nthe twentieth century, and an expression of cautious\r\noptimism about the opportunities to blaze a new trail\r\nfor the benefit of our people, who want to leave their\r\nfears behind and to attain the dreams that all are\r\nentitled to simply by virtue of being alive.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Panama for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Martín Torrijos, President of the Republic of\r\nPanama, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. John Agyekum\r\nKufuor, President of the Republic of Ghana\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Ghana.\r\nMr. John Agyekum Kufuor, President of the\r\nRepublic of Ghana, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\n17\r\nA/60/PV.9\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. John Agyekum Kufuor,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Ghana, and to invite him\r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Kufuor: After the celebratory and\r\npowerful statements made here by leaders from all four\r\ncorners of the world during these past few days\r\ncommemorating the sixtieth anniversary of this\r\nOrganization, all that is left for Ghana to do is to\r\nemphasize a few points in this annual general debate of\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nThe record attendance of heads of State and\r\nGovernment at this year’s meetings is evidence that,\r\nmore and more, nations of the world are accepting and\r\nlooking up to the United Nations to provide the moral\r\nand practical framework and leadership for the shaping\r\nand governance of the onrushing global village.\r\nWithout doubt, the Organization has become both the\r\nmain centre for the mobilization and deployment of\r\nresources for the relief of victims of natural and man-\r\nmade disasters alike, and also the chief agency and\r\ncatalyst for the spread of opportunities for progress and\r\ndevelopment for all humankind. Reassuringly, it is\r\ngalvanizing the conscience of humankind to resist and\r\ndesist from inhuman conduct, whilst putting in place a\r\nglobal social safety net for the poor, the weak and the\r\nhandicapped in a world of strident competition.\r\nGhana will therefore continue to contribute to the\r\nongoing debate on United Nations reform, especially\r\nthe strengthening of the Organization’s institutions at\r\nall levels. The reforms must radiate the spirit of\r\ncommon humanity in which each person is his\r\nbrother’s keeper. That will engender the trust needed to\r\nanchor the tolerance and goodwill which must be the\r\ncornerstone of the globalization process.\r\nThe increasing realization of our common\r\nhumanity will lessen the divisive tendencies of racial,\r\nreligious, political, gender, cultural and other social\r\ncategorizations. Already, the world, under the\r\nleadership of this Organization, is doing well in its\r\nmany dramatic rallies in rushing aid to victims\r\nwherever disaster occurs, such as the Indian Ocean\r\nStates after the tsunami and the aftermath of Hurricane\r\nKatrina in New Orleans, here in the United States of\r\nAmerica.\r\nIn spite of those positive developments, however,\r\nthe persistent and worsening carnage and mayhem\r\ncaused by terrorism still seem to lurk everywhere.\r\nNowhere and nobody seems to be safe any longer.\r\nWhatever its cause, terrorism cannot be justified or\r\nrationalized in terms of a solution, since its effects do\r\nnot discriminate between the perceived guilty and the\r\ninnocent. That is why the world must stand together\r\nand try to eradicate it.\r\nAfrican nations are now showing a strong\r\ndetermination to end the conflicts that have bedevilled\r\nthe continent for decades. The setting-up of the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) and\r\nthe African Peace and Security Council under the\r\nauspices of the African Union is a demonstration of\r\nthat resolve. Through NEPAD, Africa has identified the\r\nfactors of good governance, the culture of democracy,\r\nthe rule of law, free and fair elections, sound economic\r\nmanagement of States, and State support for and\r\npartnership with the private sector as critical for\r\nsustained socio-economic development, peace and\r\nstability.\r\nFor accelerated economic growth, Africa is\r\ngenerally agreed that the way forward is through\r\npartnerships among the African nations and with the\r\nrest of the world to create economies of scale and to\r\nattract both domestic and foreign direct investment.\r\nThat will create opportunities for employment, the\r\ntransfer of know-how and markets to combat the\r\ndebilitating poverty. The world community must\r\nsupport Africa in those ground-breaking efforts.\r\nAfrica believes that the realization of the agenda\r\nunder the Doha Round could also bring significant\r\nbenefits to developing countries. But alongside those\r\nefforts must come support for the call for greatly\r\nenhanced economic aid from the United Nations and\r\nthe developed world for the struggling third world to\r\nnurture itself into the fitness required for the\r\ncompetitiveness that the global market demands. The\r\nsame rationale must back the various initiatives aimed\r\nat providing assistance for the prevention, care and\r\ntreatment of HIV/AIDS, malaria and other infectious\r\ndiseases. It is only by containing those diseases that the\r\ncontinent’s development can be kept on course.\r\nThe empowerment of women and children is\r\nmoving apace on the continent. In that regard, Ghana\r\nhas established a Ministry of Women’s and Children’s\r\nAffairs to spearhead policies and programmes to\r\npromote gender equality and enhance the status of\r\nwomen.\r\nThis is a historic moment of truth for the\r\ninternational community. The destiny of the United\r\n18\r\nA/60/PV.9\r\nNations and humankind is in our hands. We have the\r\nchoice to save it, and the time to act is now.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Ghana for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. John Agyekum Kufuor, President of the\r\nRepublic of Ghana, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Kurmanbek Bakiev,\r\nPresident of the Kyrgyz Republic\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Kyrgyz Republic.\r\nMr. Kurmanbek Bakiev, President of the Kyrgyz\r\nRepublic, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Kurmanbek Bakiev,\r\nPresident of the Kyrgyz Republic, and to invite him to\r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Bakiev (spoke in Russian): At the\r\noutset, I would like to congratulate you, Sir, on your\r\nelection to the important post of President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixtieth anniversary session\r\nand to wish you every success in your responsible and\r\ndifficult task. May I also extend our thanks to your\r\npredecessor, Mr. Jean Ping, for his successful\r\npresidency of the previous session of the Assembly.\r\nThe summit that ended yesterday demonstrated\r\nthat the United Nations remains the universal\r\nOrganization capable of making an important\r\ncontribution to strengthening international peace and\r\nsecurity, achieving sustainable development and\r\nfinding adequate answers to new global challenges and\r\nthreats. In that regard, I hope that this sixtieth\r\nanniversary session of the General Assembly will\r\nbecome a major event in and give people some hope\r\nfor the future.\r\nThe rapid changes in today’s world have not\r\nbypassed Kyrgyzstan. Our people, not indifferent to its\r\nown destiny and future, in March of this year chose its\r\nown path to development, progress and creativity.\r\nAnother page has been turned in Kyrgyzstan’s modern\r\nhistory. We enter the twenty-first century full of\r\nresolve to achieve our deepest aspirations and hopes\r\nfor peace, prosperity, progress and freedom. We are\r\nconfident that that the goals reflected in the\r\nMillennium Declaration will be achieved in the Kyrgyz\r\nRepublic as elsewhere.\r\nIf it is to preserve the respect and to justify the\r\nhopes of peoples, the United Nations must not lag\r\nbehind the swift and ever accelerating changes taking\r\nplace in the world today. It must not only adapt to\r\ncurrent realities, but also create more effective\r\nmachinery for addressing new challenges and risks.\r\nKyrgyzstan is convinced that United Nations\r\nreform should fully reflect the will, fundamental rights\r\nand interests of all States Members and peoples.\r\nIn recent years, the Security Council has been\r\nrepeatedly criticized for its failures in the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security. It is therefore\r\nextremely important that the Security Council find the\r\nmost effective way to meet its basic responsibility for\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nKyrgyzstan has consistently advocated expansion of\r\nthe membership of the Security Council and reform of\r\nits working methods in order to make it more\r\nrepresentative, democratic and, above all, more\r\neffective. We believe that the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil should be based on the principles of\r\nuniversality, efficiency and broad geographic\r\nrepresentation. The Council’s decisions must be as\r\ntimely as possible and their implementation\r\ncorrespondingly expeditious and effective.\r\nThe Kyrgyz Republic shares the position that\r\nUnited Nations reform will be successful only if\r\nSecurity Council reform is followed by reform of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil. We support efforts to enhance the activities of\r\nthe General Assembly and to strengthen the\r\ncoordinating functions of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil. Effective coordination among the three\r\nprincipal organs is extremely important in addressing\r\nthe complex problems facing the world today.\r\nWe all realize how great and complex are the\r\nchallenges facing the United Nations in the\r\nmaintenance of peace and security. Kyrgyzstan intends\r\nto make its contribution to those tasks. For the first\r\ntime, it has offered its own candidature for non-\r\npermanent membership of the Security Council for the\r\nterm 2012-2013. We understand the great responsibility\r\nthat membership of that crucial organ of the United\r\nNations entails. I would venture to assure the\r\n19\r\nA/60/PV.9\r\nAssembly that Kyrgyzstan will make every effort to\r\nincrease its cooperation with Member States in all\r\nregions and to become a reliable partner in resolving\r\nglobal political issues.\r\nToday, the United Nations and its agencies are\r\nmore engaged with issues of development than with\r\nthose of security. While many United Nations agencies\r\ndeal every day with the problems of development,\r\nthere is only one permanent organ that deals with\r\nsecurity issues. In our opinion, given globalization and\r\nthe interrelationship of all issues relating to man-made\r\nand natural disasters, along with international terrorism\r\nand extremism, the United Nations capacity to\r\nmaintain global security must be considerably\r\nstrengthened. We believe that development\r\nprogrammes should be endowed with preventive\r\npowers to ensure security and safety.\r\nThe history of international relations in the\r\nsecond half of the last century shows that it is virtually\r\nimpossible to preserve international peace and security\r\nwhen certain basic conditions of life remain unmet.\r\nPoverty and deprivation lead to tension, which in turns\r\nleads to breaches of international peace and security. It\r\nis no accident that it is precisely the poorest regions of\r\nthe world that suffer the most serious regional\r\nconflicts. If it is to achieve its security and\r\ndevelopment targets, the international community must\r\nadopt a more balanced policy.\r\nThe world community must work actively to\r\novercome disparities and inequalities between the\r\ncountries of the North and the South. We feel that the\r\nUnited Nations needs to establish interactive\r\nmachinery to resolve the issues that cause the poorest\r\ncountries to opt out of the process of global\r\ndevelopment and decision-making. The countries of the\r\nSouth should become full partners in decisions\r\ninvolving global problems.\r\nKyrgyzstan remains committed to the Monterey\r\nConsensus, whereby the developed countries will\r\nincrease their development assistance and poor\r\ncountries will adapt themselves to using that assistance\r\nmore effectively. At various high-level forums, we\r\nhave come to understood the concepts of sustainable\r\neconomic development and sustainable human\r\ndevelopment. We fully support those concepts, with\r\nsubstantive provisions reflected in our national strategy\r\nand programmes.\r\nFurthermore, the successful implementation of\r\nthe national development programmes of many\r\ncountries is directly linked to regional and international\r\ncooperation. It is at the juncture where all of those\r\ninterests meet that the United Nations and its agencies\r\nmust further enhance their role and coordinate their\r\nefforts.\r\nWe support the proposal for national development\r\nstrategies to be adopted by 2006 and implemented by\r\n2015 as indicators for the implementation of the\r\ndevelopment goals set out in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration. In our opinion, the United Nations should\r\nmobilize new resources, strengthen coordination and\r\nincrease its contribution to the resolution of\r\ndevelopment issues.\r\nDonor countries must now move from paying lip-\r\nservice to their obligations to concrete action. In that\r\nregard, the Kyrgyz Republic welcomes the decision of\r\nthe European Union to allocate 0.7 per cent of its gross\r\nnational income to official development assistance by\r\n2009. Kyrgyzstan also advocates the identification of\r\nan acceptable level of indebtedness and the adoption of\r\nurgent and commensurate measures to ease the debt\r\nburden of developing countries.\r\nKyrgyzstan is a landlocked, mountainous country.\r\nMountain States are characterized by remoteness,\r\ndifficult accessibility, the scarcity of information, harsh\r\ngeo-climatic conditions, and high costs of living. While\r\nreceiving financial aid from the developed countries,\r\nKyrgyzstan itself is a donor of environmental services\r\nwhose value increases yearly. So, for example, the\r\nKyrgyz Republic is one of the principal repositories of\r\nglaciers and suppliers of fresh water in the region.\r\nMoreover, in the context of the International\r\nConvention on Biological Diversity, Kyrgyzstan also\r\noperates a network of biosphere areas and releases\r\nmuch less greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than\r\nmost other countries of the world, thus contributing to\r\nthe preservation of the planet’s ozone layer.\r\nAt the same time, unfortunately, in our territory,\r\nour many stockpiles of radioactive waste are an\r\ninheritance from the military-industrial complex of the\r\nformer Soviet period. Their maintenance and the\r\nprevention of further potential ecological accidents for\r\nthe entire Central-Asian region are an excessive burden\r\nfor Kyrgyzstan. We believe that the international\r\ncommunity, with a coordinating role for the United\r\nNations, should more actively involve itself in those\r\n20\r\nA/60/PV.9\r\nareas of environmental risk and provide more financial\r\nand technical assistance to avert global and regional\r\necological disasters.\r\nWe also believe that the United Nations should be\r\nmore active in assisting poor and developing countries\r\nregarding sustainable development by creating\r\nmachinery to shift the burden of external debt to\r\nsustainable development. A significant amount of our\r\nincome goes to servicing our debt, hindering the socio-\r\neconomic development of mountainous areas.\r\nIn addition to disaster preparedness and\r\nmitigation, Kyrgyzstan supports initiatives on the\r\ncreation of a worldwide early warning system for\r\nnatural disasters. As a mountain country, Kyrgyzstan\r\nregularly faces serious and frequent natural disasters,\r\nsuch as earthquakes, landslides, avalanches, and the\r\nflooding of cities and settlements. In our harsh\r\nexperience, the consequences of such natural disasters\r\ndivert huge sums from economic and social\r\ndevelopment and highlight the importance of\r\nstrengthening ecological security. As a first step,\r\nKyrgyzstan offers the use of its territory as a pilot area\r\nfor the prevention and mitigation of such natural\r\ndisasters.\r\nI would also like to express our support for the\r\nestablishment of a committee of regional organizations\r\nunder United Nations auspices. Such a committee\r\nwould enable the exploitation of untapped potential of\r\nthe regional and subregional organizations in the\r\nprevention and settlement of conflicts and other\r\nimportant regional problems. Regional structures with\r\nsuch potential that are now operating effectively should\r\nplay a mutually complementary role in facing new\r\nthreats and challenges. Kyrgyzstan supports the\r\nparticipation in the work of the committee of such\r\norganizations as the Shanghai Cooperation\r\nOrganization, the Collective Security Treaty\r\nOrganization, the Euro-Asian Economic Union and the\r\nCentral Asian Cooperation Organization.\r\nWe also support measures to enhance the\r\neffectiveness of peacekeeping operations and welcome\r\nthe Secretary-General’s proposal on United Nations\r\nstandby forces of peacekeepers and civilian police.\r\nThe Kyrgyz Republic is the only country in\r\nCentral Asia that participates in United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations. We have sent military\r\nobservers and staff officers to the United Nations\r\nmissions in Liberia, Burundi, Sierra Leone, Serbia and\r\nMontenegro, and the Sudan. We are proud of our\r\ncontribution and are resolved to continue supporting\r\nthat noble endeavour.\r\nKyrgyzstan actively supports the efforts of the\r\ninternational community to restore and strengthen\r\npeace in Afghanistan and has opened its territory to the\r\nforces of the counter-terrorism coalition and the\r\nCollective Security Treaty Organization to provide\r\nregional security measures.\r\nWe remain committed to the establishment of a\r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia. The text of\r\nthe agreement on such a zone has been agreed by five\r\ncountries of our region and we are pleased that the\r\nKyrgyz Republic is to be the depositary of the treaty.\r\nWe feel that this is evidence of the great respect and\r\ntrust in which our Republic is held with regard to the\r\ninitiative to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone. I am\r\nfirmly convinced that the establishment of such a zone\r\nin our region will strengthen global security and\r\nregional stability. We hope to obtain the corresponding\r\nsupport of the world community.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to note that the world\r\ncommunity is going through a difficult phase in the\r\nestablishment of a new system of international\r\nrelations. Clearly, it will be a long, drawn-out process.\r\nThe States Members of the United Nations should\r\naffirm their readiness to find practical solutions to the\r\nmost essential problems of our time: combating\r\npoverty, famine and disease and to work for sustainable\r\ndevelopment. This session of the General Assembly\r\nwill be remembered as the session of reforms.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Kyrgyz\r\nRepublic for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Kurmanbek Bakiev, President of the Kyrgyz\r\nRepublic, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Alvaro Uribe Vélez,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Colombia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Colombia.\r\nMr. Alvaro Uribe Vélez, President of the Republic\r\nof Colombia, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\n21\r\nA/60/PV.9\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Alvaro Uribe Vélez,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Colombia, and to invite\r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Uribe Vélez (spoke in Spanish): We\r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election and wish you\r\nevery possible success in the ongoing reform process.\r\nThe celebration of the sixtieth anniversary is an\r\nideal moment to reiterate my country’s commitment to\r\nthe goals and principles of the United Nations. We\r\nexpress our support for the task of reforming the\r\nOrganization.\r\nColombia’s adherence to multilateralism is based\r\non its active participation throughout the United\r\nNations process, from the signing of the Charter in San\r\nFrancisco on the June 26 1945 to today, with many of\r\nits agencies present in my country supporting our\r\nnational policies to solve the problems we face.\r\nIt is a source of pride that many Colombians have\r\nleft their mark on the Organization. It is worth\r\nmentioning, among others, former President Alberto\r\nLleras Camargo, one of the first and most fierce and\r\nefficient defenders of the principle of legal equality\r\nbetween States. He was also a champion of common\r\ndefence, which compels democratic States to come to\r\none another’s defence should one of them be the victim\r\nof aggression.\r\nColombia had the privilege of presiding, through\r\nEduardo Zuleta, over the opening of the first session of\r\nthe General Assembly. His vision of the Organization\r\nis as valid today as it was 60 years ago, as you, Sir,\r\nrecently acknowledged in your speech to the Assembly.\r\nThe diversity and evolution of thought are human\r\ngifts. To exercise those faculties, it is necessary for\r\nStates to guarantee democratic opportunities that allow\r\neach individual to contribute to and compete in the\r\nquest for the collective good. There can be no room for\r\nany form of ideological stasis, which would discourage\r\nemulation, fail to recognize intelligence, and paralyse\r\ncreativity in the search for solutions to people’s\r\nproblems.\r\nRecognizing diversity and the evolution of\r\nthought is the source of our vocation for pluralism. It\r\nguides the struggle against terrorism that we have\r\ncarried out with democratic conviction for three long\r\nyears. Now that dictatorships are expressions of the\r\npast and democracy is an indestructible paradigm, it is\r\ntime to review certain concepts that are becoming\r\nobsolete and must be replaced with more useful and\r\ncontemporary ones.\r\nThe mindset that characterizes Governments as\r\nbeing of the left or of the right is a simplistic view that\r\nproduces a polarized political atmosphere. It has\r\ntriggered irreconcilable emotions and sensitivities that\r\nare inconsistent with the actions of our Governments\r\nand threaten the unity of our countries.\r\nI dare suggest that, in their place, we use five\r\nparameters to qualify our democracies. They are\r\nsecurity with a democratic scope; the effective\r\nprotection of public freedoms; transparency as a factor\r\nof confidence; social cohesion as a principle of\r\ndemocratic sustainability; and the independence of\r\ninstitutions. With these parameters, we can define a\r\ndemocracy as institutional or only skin-deep; as\r\ngoverned by judicial order or by personal whim; as\r\nprogressive or backward, inclusive or exclusive.\r\nColombia is working on a concept of democratic\r\nsecurity, enshrined in global security. We call it\r\ndemocratic because it differs from the doctrine of\r\nnational security that was applied in the continent and\r\nused to suppress freedoms, punish democracy,\r\nstigmatize the opposition and frustrate dissent. Our\r\nsecurity is aimed at deepening democracy. We have\r\ngone to great lengths to ensure that this process of re-\r\nestablishing security is recognized as a democratic\r\nvalue by all schools of thought. We are determined that\r\nsecurity shall be provided on equal terms, efficiently\r\nand transparently, to those closest to the Government,\r\nas well as to its most hardened opponents.\r\nIn Colombia, the security problem has been the\r\nproduct of the weakness of the State in facing\r\ncriminals. We wish to reconfigure the equation and to\r\nfinally have a State that is strong enough to guarantee\r\nColombians the effectiveness of their freedoms and\r\nprotect them from all threats. Given a democracy that\r\nis deep-rooted and without ambiguities, no violent\r\naction can enjoy a veneer of legitimacy; on the\r\ncontrary, it must be disqualified and branded as\r\nterrorist. We therefore express our solidarity with those\r\nwho have suffered from the actions of terror.\r\nFor three consecutive years, the number of\r\nhomicides, kidnappings and other terrorist crimes has\r\nfallen in Colombia. We have not yet won the struggle\r\nagainst terrorism, but we are winning it. That victory\r\n22\r\nA/60/PV.9\r\nwill bring peace and progress to our country and, with\r\nillicit drugs uprooted from our soil, the world will feel\r\ngreat relief. To that end, we need the participation and\r\nsupport of the international community.\r\nThe opposition in Colombia has always had\r\nsafeguards, but today those guarantees are truly\r\neffective thanks to democratic security. Colombia has\r\nalways embraced the cause of human rights, but those\r\nare now enjoying more tangible respect thanks to\r\ndemocratic security.\r\nWhile strengthening citizen’s confidence in their\r\ninstitutions, the concept of security that we profess and\r\npractice requires those who opt for violence to cease\r\nhostilities and prepare to negotiate a lasting peace. The\r\ndecisive and firm action to thwart those who practice\r\nterror, along with a generous policy for those who\r\nchoose to abandon armed intimidation, have allowed\r\nthe demobilization and reintegration of 20,000 out of\r\nsome 50,000 terrorists. The Government’s door\r\nremains open to negotiation so long as the agreement\r\non cessation of hostilities remains accepted.\r\nWe need the world to support our plans for\r\nreintegration. I ask members to imagine the magnitude\r\nof the challenge. We have 20,000 former\r\ncombatants — a number that could double in coming\r\nyears — individuals who have hitherto lived by the gun\r\nand are accustomed to killing. What better contribution\r\ncould there be to peace than the definitive rejection of\r\nillegality? To that end, we need the world’s help in\r\nproviding new opportunities for rehabilitation and\r\nsocial integration.\r\nWe are implementing a law on justice and peace,\r\nwhich is applicable to all terrorist groups. By\r\ncomparison with earlier Colombian laws and those of\r\nother countries, our law raises the bar in terms of\r\njustice and reparations for victims.\r\nWe have increased fumigation to rid our country\r\nof the illicit drugs that finance terrorism, and we are\r\noptimistic with regard to manual eradication. By the\r\nend of 2005, some 30,000 hectares of illegal crops\r\nshould be destroyed. We require greater support from\r\nthe international community in order to provide our\r\npeasants with alternative opportunities.\r\nDemocratic security has allowed investors to\r\nregain their confidence, and we have begun to see early\r\nsigns of declining unemployment. In that way, we will\r\nfind the resources to face yet another challenge — that\r\nof overcoming poverty and building a nation based on\r\ntotal social cohesion. Our social policy is framed by a\r\nlong-term vision and short-term goals under constant\r\nreview, in keeping with the Millennium Development\r\nGoals, the fulfilment of which we reaffirmed yesterday\r\nin this Hall.\r\nI wish to cite three of the seven chapters of our\r\nsocial policy. The educational revolution is an axis of\r\nsocial cohesion and the road towards equality, the\r\nredistribution of income, and the opening of new\r\nchannels for social mobility, without which democracy\r\nwill remain incomplete.\r\nPromoting a country of owners emphasizes the\r\nfinancing of medium, small and micro enterprises in\r\norder to overcome the barrier of access to credit, a\r\nhateful form of discrimination that hinders democracy.\r\nComprehensive social protection, which in three\r\nyears’ time will provide health insurance to all people\r\nliving in poverty, has allowed us to register progress in\r\nthe provision of child nutrition, to ensure access to\r\neducation and to improve the well-being of the elderly.\r\nThis year, 500,000 families will be involved in\r\nColombia’s programme — poor families that receive a\r\nState subsidy to feed and educate their children. In the\r\nnear future, that number will rise to 1 million, in\r\naddition to the increase budgetary efforts undertaken\r\nunder the aegis of the educational revolution. In 2006,\r\n10 million children will benefit from our nutrition\r\nprogrammes, and 570,000 elderly citizens will receive\r\nstipends to cover their most pressing needs.\r\nOur social policy also comprises ongoing efforts\r\nto strengthen alternative development programmes in\r\norder to allow us definitively to overcome the problem\r\nof illicit drugs. Through such programmes, the\r\ninternational community has a unique opportunity to\r\ncontribute to and implement the principle of shared\r\nresponsibility.\r\nThe “forest-keeper families” programme,\r\ninvolving some 33,000 families committed to\r\nmaintaining their areas free from drugs and to\r\nsupervising the recovery of the tropical forest, as well\r\nas a programme to provide care to the displaced and\r\nreintegrated, will cost Colombia some $300 million\r\ndollars next year.\r\nWe stand firm in the fight against terrorism and in\r\nour conviction that a sustained and permanent victory\r\ndepends upon the success of each individual country in\r\n23\r\nA/60/PV.9\r\nthe struggle for social cohesion. In projecting our\r\nsecurity policy as a mainstay of the State, we believe it\r\nto be intrinsically linked to the ongoing improvement\r\nof the social conditions of our people. The distinction\r\nbetween authority and social policy is erroneous. Peace\r\nstems from authority, but lasting peace will require us\r\nto weave a social fabric of equity.\r\nLet this be an opportunity to draw attention to the\r\nthreat of rising oil prices and the lack of energy\r\nalternatives for poor countries that are net importers.\r\nThere are already signs of disturbance that could lead\r\nto grave disruptions of institutional stability. Ignoring\r\nthat problem could raise greater obstacles in our fight\r\nagainst poverty and prevent us from achieving the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. Many countries,\r\nincluding brotherly countries in Central America and\r\nthe Caribbean, require immediate action to help\r\nfinance the supply of fuel and the development of new\r\nfuel sources.\r\nI would like to reiterate the gratitude of the\r\nColombian people for the effective presence and\r\nsolidarity of the United Nations in our country.\r\nWe hope that the debate on the issue of reform\r\nwill further strengthen multilateralism. We also hope\r\nthat the Organization will emerge strengthened from\r\nthat debate, in order that it may effectively promote\r\ninstitutional democracy governed by progressive and\r\ninclusive legal processes in every country comprising\r\nthe community of nations.\r\nLed by the United Nations, contemporary\r\ndiplomacy must become more austere in its spending\r\nand rely more upon the Internet and modern\r\ncommunications than on travel, in order to avoid\r\nbecoming a heavy and debilitating burden upon\r\ncountries and to ensure that the resources saved on\r\norganizations, expenditures and contractors can truly\r\nreach communities in need. I wish to reiterate that the\r\nissue of austerity vis-à-vis world diplomacy is absent\r\nin our approach to United Nations reform, and we\r\nshould include it.\r\nEvery country, as well as the United Nations, as\r\nour universal Organization, can contribute to making\r\nthese hopes a reality and to bringing peace, security\r\nand comprehensive development to our peoples,\r\nthereby reaching the goals we set for ourselves for the\r\nearly years of this century.\r\nOur warm regards go out to the people of the\r\nUnited States, which has been battered by Hurricane\r\nKatrina. We wish to express our resolute solidarity\r\nwith those who have been its victims. It is our hope\r\nthat, in a few days, relief and rescue experts from\r\nColombia will be on the ground in affected\r\ncommunities in the United States.\r\nWe are all committed to one task, namely,\r\nmeeting the social goals of the millennium.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Colombia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Álvaro Uribe Vélez, President of the Republic\r\nof Colombia, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nItem 9 of the provisional agenda (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by The Most Honourable Percival\r\nJames Patterson, MP, Prime Minister and\r\nMinister of Defence of Jamaica\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Prime Minister and Minister of Defence\r\nof Jamaica.\r\nThe Most Honourable Percival James Patterson,\r\nMP, Prime Minister and Minister of Defence of\r\nJamaica, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Excellency The Most Honourable\r\nPercival James Patterson, MP, Prime Minister and\r\nMinister of Defence of Jamaica, and inviting him to\r\naddress the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Patterson (Jamaica): I would like to\r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the\r\npresidency of the current session of the General\r\nAssembly. May I also express our deep appreciation to\r\nMr. Jean Ping for so ably guiding the work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly during its fifty-ninth session.\r\nI am honoured to address the General Assembly\r\ntoday in my capacity as Chairman of the Group of 77\r\nand China. Five years ago, I was among the leaders of\r\nnations, rich and poor, who met here under the auspices\r\nof the United Nations and made a compact to rid the\r\nworld of the most dehumanizing conditions afflicting a\r\n24\r\nA/60/PV.9\r\nlarge portion of humankind. That was a solemn pledge\r\nmade by us to the most disadvantaged peoples of our\r\nworld — the poor, the hungry, the illiterate, the\r\nhomeless, the sick — to infants, mothers and the\r\nunborn, as well as to nature, which must sustain the\r\nexistence of the whole human race.\r\nThis year’s Human Development Report of the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP)\r\nreveals that one fifth of humanity survives on less than\r\n$1 per day, and that 2.5 billion people fail to earn $2\r\ndaily. The recently concluded High-level Plenary\r\nMeeting has revealed that we have made slight\r\nprogress, more so in a few regions, to meet some of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). But we are\r\nnowhere on track to achieving the promises of any of\r\nthe major development-oriented United Nations\r\nconferences or summits held since the adoption of the\r\nMDGs. Progress has been uneven. At the current pace,\r\nsome regions and countries will miss several of the\r\nMDGs by decades. In certain areas, such as the\r\nelimination of hunger, we could be centuries away.\r\nWe are likely to miss global targets in the areas of\r\ninfant and maternal mortality, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis,\r\nmalaria and other infectious diseases and\r\nenvironmental sustainability. Limited financial\r\nresources, debt, restricted asymmetrical trade\r\nopportunities and HIV/AIDS have been identified as\r\nmajor inhibiting factors. Beyond those constraints,\r\nduring the past five years many developing countries\r\nhave suffered devastating natural disasters, which have\r\ndisrupted economic growth, damaged production,\r\ndestroyed infrastructure and dislocated populations,\r\ncausing economic losses that amount to years of gross\r\ndomestic product (GDP). Development goals and\r\ntargets cannot be met within the time frames without a\r\nmassive addition of resources, both financial and\r\ntechnical. No one can remain safe and secure, or even\r\ncontent, while living in an oasis of wealth surrounded\r\nby a desert of poverty.\r\nNot to be forgotten is the unfulfilled agenda of\r\ngender equity. The empowerment of women must be a\r\nvital ingredient in all our social and economic\r\nprogrammes.\r\nWe agreed at Monterrey on a comprehensive\r\napproach to mobilize the financing needed for real\r\nglobal development that specified the contributions\r\nrequired from developing and developed countries\r\nalike. Our review has revealed that, as a group,\r\ndeveloping countries have delivered on their\r\ncommitments. Most have achieved a level of economic\r\ngrowth and have increased domestic resources and\r\nforeign-exchange reserves. There has been a\r\nstrengthened focus on South/South cooperation, which\r\nhas seen trade among developing countries growing\r\nfaster than their total export trade and an increasing\r\nflow of investment.\r\nAt the second South-South Summit, held in Qatar\r\nin June, we agreed on a major programme of\r\nSouth/South cooperation that is already having results.\r\nI shall cite just two examples. First, the Governments\r\nof Qatar, China and India pledged donations at the\r\nSummit to launch a South fund for development and\r\nhumanitarian assistance. Secondly, last week at\r\nMontego Bay, Jamaica, the President of the Bolivarian\r\nRepublic of Venezuela signed, with several Caribbean\r\nGovernments, the Petrocaribe Energy Cooperation\r\nAgreement to enhance energy security, facilitate socio-\r\neconomic development and advance regional economic\r\nintegration in the Caribbean. This is a most positive\r\ninitiative at a time of high and volatile energy prices\r\nand insecure supplies.\r\nFrom our partners in the developed world there\r\nhas been a gradual recovery of private foreign direct\r\ninvestment and in the provision of official development\r\nassistance (ODA). We welcome the increase in debt\r\nrelief, including debt cancellation, for many of the\r\nmost highly indebted poor countries, as well as the\r\nrenewed focus on Africa and on HIV/AIDS.\r\nHowever, the review has also revealed some\r\ntrends that are cause for anxiety, and therefore worthy\r\nof our attention. First, a significant part of the\r\nresources mobilized by developing countries has been\r\nused to finance debt-servicing payments to multilateral\r\ndevelopment banks and to increase foreign-exchange\r\nreserves held in developed countries. That has led to\r\nnet transfers to developed countries every year since\r\n1998. Secondly, foreign direct investment has been\r\nconcentrated in, and is becoming almost confined to,\r\nthe larger, faster-growing developing countries.\r\nThirdly, the increase in ODA since 2000 has largely\r\nbeen the result of resources targeted for emergency\r\nassistance, debt relief and technical assistance.\r\nTogether they accounted for 50 cents of every aid\r\ndollar in 2004. Fourthly, debt relief has been limited to\r\nthose highly indebted poor countries which have\r\nsatisfied International Monetary Fund (IMF) conditions\r\nfor disbursements. Fifthly, the terms of trade continue\r\n25\r\nA/60/PV.9\r\nto work against commodity- and preference-dependent\r\ndeveloping countries. And sixthly, the sudden erosion\r\nof trade preferences has created significant economic\r\nhardships for many developing countries without the\r\nresources or time to diversify their export base. The net\r\nresult is that there have been insufficient new resources\r\navailable to the vast majority of developing countries\r\nto invest in meeting long-term development goals.\r\nPolicy space for developing countries to act\r\neffectively and the timing and quality of the resource\r\nflows are also very important. In this regard, the Group\r\nof 77 and China calls for the elimination of aid\r\nconditionalities which restrict the policy options for\r\ndeveloping countries and thereby the real effectiveness\r\nof development cooperation.\r\nFurther, we stress the need to cease the use of\r\nunilateral coercive measures against developing\r\ncountries. It is wrong to apply the weight of economic\r\npower to pressure developing countries for political\r\npurposes. This causes severe hardships and jeopardizes\r\ndevelopment efforts, including the achievement of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nThere are developing countries which face\r\npeculiar, if not unique, development challenges. The\r\nGroup of 77 and China has consistently argued that\r\nAfrica, the least developed countries, the landlocked\r\ndeveloping countries and the small island developing\r\nStates face special and tremendous challenges. These\r\nare magnified in a globalized, liberalized and\r\ncompetitive international economic environment and\r\nwith the increasing incidence of more devastating\r\nnatural disasters.\r\nThe arguments are gaining acceptance. There are\r\nnow internationally agreed programmes for the last\r\nthree named groups and an emerging consensus for a\r\nspecial programme for Africa under African\r\nleadership. The special programmes for these groups of\r\ncountries were reaffirmed at our High-level Plenary\r\nMeeting. We now need to implement them with\r\nurgency.\r\nWe have long recognized that export trade is the\r\nmost sustainable source of resources for development\r\nas well as the best stimulant to investment and\r\nemployment. The current international trading rules\r\nand systems are heavily stacked against developing\r\ncountries. We must resolve to transform international\r\ntrade into an engine of growth. The policies, rules and\r\nmodalities of global trade must have development\r\nfocus. Why have we failed so miserably to fulfil the\r\nDoha mandate for a development round? We sent only\r\nthe feeblest of messages from the High-level Plenary\r\nMeeting to our trade ministers, but unless they are\r\ngiven firm instructions to afford special and differential\r\ntreatment to developing countries, the December\r\nMinisterial Conference of the World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO) in Hong Kong will, like those\r\nheld in Seattle and Cancun, yield a dismal collapse.\r\nWe agreed in Monterrey that it was necessary to\r\nreform the international economic system and make it\r\nmore coherent and supportive of the development\r\npolicies of Member States. We also agreed that it was\r\nnecessary to increase the voice and participation of\r\ndeveloping countries in the international financial and\r\ntrade institutions. Yet nothing has happened. We cannot\r\nallow the Bretton Woods institutions to remain forever\r\nimpervious to our calls. To attain the agreed\r\ndevelopment objectives, there must be a renunciation\r\nof the ill-conceived policies imposed on a number of\r\ndeveloping countries under structural adjustment\r\nprogrammes begun three decades ago.\r\nWe might dispute the causes and the sharing of\r\nresponsibility, but no longer do we dispute the\r\nawesome reality of climate change. The evidence that\r\nclimate change poses a long-term challenge to every\r\npart of the globe is irrefutable.\r\nDeveloping countries have maintained that\r\nclimate change and other unsustainable pressures on\r\nour environment demand urgent attention. Developed\r\ncountries must take the lead in changing production\r\nand consumption patterns: in an approach to the\r\ndevelopment and transfer of environmentally sound\r\ntechnology to developing countries on a preferential\r\nbasis; in their level of commitment and support to fight\r\nagainst desertification and land degradation; and in the\r\nresources to be devoted to the management of waste\r\nand in the change towards the promotion of a culture of\r\nrecycling. We must keep on pressing for the\r\ndevelopment and adoption of strategies that mitigate,\r\nand build resilience to, the impact of climate change.\r\nI have spoken thus far on development issues.\r\nBut these are closely related to other critical areas of\r\nthe international agenda. One such area is disarmament\r\nand arms control, which is in danger of becoming a\r\nneglected and forgotten goal of the United Nations.\r\nThe link between disarmament and development is\r\neven more relevant today. The figures are indeed\r\n26\r\nA/60/PV.9\r\nstartling. Roughly $1 trillion is now spent annually on\r\nweapons and military equipment of all kinds,\r\nconsuming a massive share of the world’s resources. If\r\nsuch resources were channelled into development, the\r\nworld would not only be more prosperous, it would be\r\nmuch safer and more secure.\r\nOur concern is not just about nuclear weapons. It\r\nis also about the proliferation of guns of every\r\ndescription, which endangers the lives of ordinary\r\ncitizens, undermines the rule of law and threatens\r\nsocial stability. Those who manufacture such weapons\r\nmust exercise greater control and support anti-\r\nproliferation efforts.\r\nThe United Nations was established 60 years ago\r\nto bring peace and security to the world, and also to\r\nplay a major role in promoting development. The\r\nUnited Nations must not allow, as has appeared to be\r\nthe case in recent years, any part of its mandate to be\r\nusurped.\r\nThe Bretton Woods institutions and the General\r\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade, now the World Trade\r\nOrganization, have taken dominant positions on\r\npolicies in areas of their specialization. These policies,\r\nhowever, have far-ranging implications across the\r\neconomic, social and environmental spectrum. There is\r\na glaring gap in overall international development\r\npolicymaking, and in the capacity to secure coherence\r\nacross the development, finance, trade and technology\r\nareas.\r\nWith renewed priority to development and the\r\nMillennium Development Goals, United Nations\r\nreform should empower the Organization by providing\r\nthe resources and a clear mandate to do at least three\r\nthings. First, it should ensure system-wide coherence,\r\nincluding with the Bretton Woods institutions and the\r\nWTO, in respect to the policies and operational\r\nactivities which impact the achievement of the agreed\r\ndevelopment goals. Secondly, it should bring the\r\nresources of the development-oriented arms of the\r\nUnited Nations system to focus on development\r\npriorities that have been identified by Member States.\r\nAnd, thirdly, it should promote dialogue and\r\npartnership, review trends, particularly in resource\r\nmobilization, and implement measures to ensure that\r\nthe Development Goals can be met within the agreed\r\ntime frames. These should be the responsibility of a\r\nrevitalized Economic and Social Council.\r\nThe future of generations to come rests not so\r\nmuch on the vigour of our debate and the declarations\r\nat the sixtieth session of the General Assembly, but on\r\nthe action we take, commencing right here in New\r\nYork, to make the United Nations stronger and more\r\neffective.\r\nAll our citizens are demanding that collectively\r\nwe emerge with a clear vision, that we display the\r\ncourage and unrelenting commitment to build a world\r\nof peace, justice and equity, which we can inhabit\r\ntogether in true harmony. They are convinced that it is\r\nwithin our power to rid the only planet where human\r\nlife prevails of hunger, ignorance, disease and strife.\r\nThey believe we can provide shelter to the homeless\r\nand eradicate poverty everywhere; that once we have\r\nthe political will and determination, we can prevent\r\ngenocide and combat terrorism; that irrespective of\r\ngender, race, colour or religious creed, we can ensure\r\nfor every person the inalienable right of human dignity.\r\nLet us spare no effort to build a single world free\r\nfrom want and fear, free from exploitation and\r\noppression: a mother Earth where justice, liberty,\r\nprosperity and the wisdom of creative minds prevail in\r\nabundance. Let us here resolve to build one world in\r\nwhich every man, woman and child can realize the true\r\npurpose of life and enjoy its fulfilment. Let us\r\ndetermine that the time for action is now and sound the\r\ntrumpet of hope for all mankind.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of\r\nJamaica for the statement he has just made.\r\nThe Most Honourable Percival James Patterson,\r\nPrime Minister of Jamaica, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency The\r\nRight Honourable Jack Straw, MP, Secretary of State\r\nfor Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs of the United\r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\r\nMr. Straw (United Kingdom): Let me begin, Sir,\r\nby paying tribute to your predecessor, Jean Ping, for\r\nhis extraordinary work — above all on the world\r\nsummit, but also throughout his year as President —\r\nand by offering my congratulations to you on\r\nbeginning your year in office.\r\nI should also like to express, on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union and all its member States, our deepest\r\nsympathy and solidarity to the people of the United\r\n27\r\nA/60/PV.9\r\nStates, particularly those in the Gulf states, in their\r\nhour of need.\r\nIn early July, my first duty in the presidency of\r\nthe European Union was to go to Srebrenica to mark\r\nthe tenth anniversary of the massacre there, the worst\r\nin Europe since the end of the Second World War.\r\nMore than 8,000 people, mainly Muslim, were taken\r\naway and killed as the international community just\r\nstood to one side. To be sure, we had shown the right\r\nconvictions in words, but shamefully, we had failed to\r\nact. The lesson of that massacre — and of the even\r\ngreater horror of Rwanda a year before — was that we\r\nall needed better means to turn our collective will into\r\ndecisive action. I think that we in the European Union\r\nhave learned in the intervening period. Today, the\r\nUnion is on the ground as a military, police or civilian\r\npresence in Bosnia, in Aceh, in Iraq, in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo and, with the African Union, in\r\nDarfur.\r\nI also think that the United Nations has learned\r\nthe lessons of the past decade. At the summit this\r\nweek, we agreed on the further steps that we need to\r\ntake for the Organization to be even more effective. Of\r\nall that was agreed at the summit, I believe it will be\r\nthe agreement on our “responsibility to protect” that\r\nwill be seen in the future as having the greatest\r\nsignificance of all. If we follow through on the\r\nresponsibility to protect, then never again will\r\ngenocide, ethnic cleansing and crimes against\r\nhumanity be allowed to take place under our noses\r\nwith nothing done.\r\nThe responsibility to protect is, of course, a\r\nreflection of our common morality. But it is also a\r\nrecognition that the world in which we now live is too\r\nsmall for us to be unaffected by, or indifferent to, the\r\ninnocent victims of murder and oppression. This\r\nshrinking of the world has been as sudden as it has\r\nbeen profound. When the Berlin wall fell, a generation\r\nof ideological certainties was swept away. People could\r\nsuddenly see partners where before they had only\r\nglimpsed adversaries. And as that very visible barrier\r\nwas noisily being breached, a revolution in information\r\ntechnology was quietly erasing the barriers of distance\r\nand time. Continents and cultures are now cabled\r\ntogether and bound by trade and services in a way that\r\nwas unimaginable even a decade ago.\r\nIn this new world, we can no longer safely\r\ntolerate the general threat that can come from a\r\nparticular human tragedy, wherever it takes place. To a\r\ngreater extent than ever before, we share the same\r\nworld: the same threats and responsibilities, the same\r\nopportunities and interests. And precisely because the\r\nboundaries of our world have contracted, the\r\nhorizons — the ambitions — of many people around\r\nthe globe have infinitely expanded. For the first time in\r\nour history, mankind has the ability to realize the\r\npotential of individuals in societies of all kinds and in\r\nevery region through an open exchange of goods,\r\ninvestment, technology and, above all, ideas.\r\nNot least in all of this, it is the rise of India and\r\nof China that is reordering the world economy.\r\nHundreds of millions there and elsewhere have been\r\nlifted out of poverty. A new global market has been\r\ncreated that ignores the divide — which seemed so\r\nfundamental for so many decades — between East and\r\nWest.\r\nCurrently, not everyone has the chance to share in\r\nall of that. Much of sub-Saharan Africa remains\r\nblighted by poverty, disease and conflict. The\r\nEuropean Union has now set a clear timetable to\r\nachieve the 0.7 per cent target for aid. Debt relief, trade\r\nreform and development aid are all vital, but none of\r\nthem can work alone. Fundamental to making poverty\r\nhistory are the Governments of the developing world\r\nthemselves. And where Governments fail, their own\r\npeoples are the victims, as United Nations Special\r\nEnvoy Anna Tibaijuka’s damning assessment of the\r\nsituation in Zimbabwe only too graphically shows.\r\nSub-Saharan Africa is not alone in having yet to\r\nachieve its potential. The American author Thomas\r\nFriedman, in his recent book The World Is Flat,\r\nhighlights an extraordinary anomaly: it was the Arab\r\npeoples whose forebears devised algebra and the\r\nalgorithms upon which our entire digital age is based,\r\nbut those peoples are now right at the rear of today’s\r\ntechnological revolution, with, for example, fewer than\r\n2 per cent of those populations having Internet access.\r\nThree United Nations Development Programme Arab\r\nHuman Development Reports have now set out clearly\r\nhow limited economic prospects and stunted political\r\nfreedoms have led young and talented people towards\r\nalienation and disillusionment.\r\nThe answer, however, does not lie in easy\r\nstereotypes about some clash of civilizations. It is only\r\nthe terrorists and the preachers of hate who want us to\r\nbelieve that Islam and the West are fundamentally\r\n28\r\nA/60/PV.9\r\ndifferent. Theirs is a philosophy of mistrust and\r\ndespair, and we reject it utterly. Indonesia and\r\nTurkey — to name just two — are both striking\r\nexamples of how countries with predominantly Muslim\r\npopulations can embrace democracy and modernity.\r\nWe in the European Union have seen the vibrant\r\nMuslim communities in our own countries, and from\r\nthat experience have seen how Islamic and Western\r\ncultures can be partners in a global society.\r\nEveryone knows that the Arab peoples want\r\nprosperity, freedom and democracy every bit as much\r\nas anyone in Europe or America. So the fact that the\r\nArab world has the lowest scores in regional\r\nmeasurements of democratic practices, civil freedoms\r\nand good governance is not some cultural inevitability,\r\nbut a temporary failure of human will. In that regard,\r\nthe international community has a clear responsibility\r\nto encourage regionally led political, social and\r\neconomic reform. The European Union strongly\r\nsupports such reform and will continue to do so.\r\nEqually, it has been our active foreign policy that has\r\nplaced us in the lead with regard to Iran, especially on\r\nthe nuclear dossier.\r\nWith our High Representative Javier Solana and\r\nmy French and German Foreign Minister colleagues,\r\nwe have made detailed proposals for the relationship\r\nbetween the European Union and Iran to be based on\r\ncooperation and respect for international norms and\r\ntreaties.\r\nOur proposals envisage a high-level, long-term\r\npolitical and security framework between the European\r\nUnion and Iran, in which we would work together in\r\npolitical, economic, scientific and technological areas,\r\nincluding the civil nuclear field, in return for Iran\r\nproviding guarantees about its intentions and\r\ncapabilities concerning nuclear weapons. So, we will\r\nlisten very carefully to and reflect on this afternoon’s\r\nspeech by the new President of the Islamic Republic of\r\nIran, Mr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.\r\nOn Iraq, the European Union now has a\r\ncomprehensive programme of engagement and has put\r\nbehind it divisions over the military action two and a\r\nhalf years ago. We are supporting the goal of a\r\npeaceful, prosperous, democratic and stable nation.\r\nWe are also giving very active support to the\r\nQuartet’s efforts to secure a just and lasting peace\r\nbetween Israel and the Palestinians, with two States\r\nliving side by side. We salute Prime Minister Sharon’s\r\nbrave decision to withdraw from the Gaza Strip, and\r\nwe salute President Mahmoud Abbas’s work to build\r\nthe first stage of an effective, viable State of Palestine.\r\nIn July, the European Union again suffered the\r\nhorror of a major terrorist atrocity. This time the target\r\nwas my country, the United Kingdom: its capital,\r\nLondon. But none of us is safe from the threat of terror.\r\nInternational terrorism requires an international\r\nresponse; otherwise, we all pay the price for each\r\nother’s vulnerabilities. The ratification of a\r\ncomprehensive treaty on terrorism is, therefore, at the\r\nhighest priority.\r\nBut the threat from terrorists and the political\r\ninstability they bring is made worse by the easy\r\navailability of weapons in what has become an\r\nanarchic, unregulated international trade. These same\r\nweapons fuelled the killings in Rwanda and in Bosnia a\r\ndecade ago and are fuelling the conflicts in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and in Darfur today.\r\nWe already have international instruments to regulate\r\nchemical, biological and nuclear weapons. We in the\r\nEuropean Union have a comprehensive arms control\r\nregime. But I suggest to the General Assembly that the\r\ntime has now come for this Organization to embrace\r\nthe idea of an international arms trade treaty, which\r\nwould build on and strengthen existing initiatives.\r\nIt was in the killing fields of Europe, in two\r\nsuccessive wars, that the twin ideas of the United\r\nNations and of the European Union became imperative.\r\nToday, the European Union’s commitment to the\r\nUnited Nations is profound; it has never been stronger.\r\nAnd it is reflected in what we give in voluntary\r\ndonations and to the regular budget and peacekeeping\r\noperations.\r\nThe fundamental purpose of the United Nations\r\nremains today what it was at its foundation: to remove\r\nthe scourge of war, to reaffirm the worth of the human\r\nperson and to promote social progress and better\r\nstandards of life. In this changed and changing world,\r\nit is the responsibility of us all to ensure that this\r\nOrganization has the powers and the resources to\r\nachieve all these aims.\r\nThe President: I want to express my appreciation\r\nfor the respect demonstrated for the time limit on\r\nstatements.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.55 p.m.\r\n"
