(Bahrain) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 3.15 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Denis Sassou Nguesso, President of \r\nthe Republic of the Congo \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of the Congo. \r\n Mr. Denis Sassou Nguesso, President of the \r\nRepublic of the Congo, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Denis Sassou Nguesso, \r\nPresident of the Republic of the Congo, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly. \r\n President Nguesso (spoke in French): Madam, \r\nyour election to the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-first session is the sign of a \r\nfavourable turn of events in the world. I congratulate \r\nyou and I welcome you not only as an experienced \r\ndiplomat, with established skills and qualifications, but \r\nalso as a great advocate of human rights. I wish also to \r\ncommend, through you, your country, the State of \r\nBahrain, for its tremendous contribution to the \r\npromotion of the values of peace, freedom and \r\nequality. \r\n I should like also to express our deepest gratitude \r\nto Mr. Jan Eliasson for the wisdom and competence \r\nwith which he guided the previous session. He \r\ndeserves plaudits for having led to a successful \r\noutcome the difficult negotiations on the establishment \r\nof the Human Rights Council and of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission. I would also like to congratulate a great \r\nson of Africa, a friend and brother, Mr. Kofi Annan, for \r\nhis work as Secretary-General. His outstanding work \r\nwas recognized at the seventh session of the \r\nConference of the African Union held last July at \r\nBanjul and was given a moving and memorable tribute \r\nthat I would like to reiterate here. Mr. Secretary-\r\nGeneral, the world is grateful to you; Africa is proud of \r\nyou. Furthermore, I would like to welcome \r\nMontenegro as a Member State, whose admission \r\nreinforces the universal character of our Organization. \r\nWe wish that country a warm welcome. \r\n This session opens at a time when the overall \r\nsituation in the world is becoming more and more \r\ncomplex with reasons for concern and reasons for \r\nhope. It is our responsibility to ensure through \r\nmultilateralism that hope overcomes fear and that the \r\nworld becomes safer for future generations. We must \r\nreaffirm our faith in multilateralism, because the many \r\nchallenges of our time must be confronted collectively; \r\nno State can deal with them alone. The same is true for \r\nthe environment, terrorism, drug trafficking etc. Since \r\nits creation, the United Nations has never slackened in \r\nthe search for ways and means to assume its \r\nresponsibilities. \r\n But today more than ever, it is necessary to \r\nencourage the search for collective solutions for the \r\nmany sorts of phenomena that weaken global peace. \r\nToday more than ever, we must join our energies to \r\nbuild a world in which human beings can live where \r\nA/61/PV.11  \r\n \r\n06-52737 2 \r\n \r\nthey wish in dignity, safe from need and fear. That is \r\nthe purpose of our joint activities. \r\n In order to eradicate armed violence, we must \r\nwork for peace through the prevention and settlement \r\nof conflicts. The situation in the Middle East continues \r\nto be a serious threat to international peace and \r\nsecurity. It is urgent that a just, lasting and \r\ncomprehensive solution be found to this conflict that is \r\nravaging this region. We need a solution based on the \r\nagreed proposals, such as the Road Map and the \r\nrelevant resolutions of our Organization. The role of \r\nthe Quartet in this respect is crucial. The cessation of \r\nhostilities, after one month of pointless violence in \r\nLebanon, must be consolidated in order to achieve a \r\nlasting ceasefire. \r\n As for Africa, positive advances have been made \r\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo with the \r\nholding of general elections. Every effort must be \r\nmade to ensure the successful conclusion of the \r\nelectoral process, namely the second round of the \r\npresidential elections. The fact that we are now \r\nspeaking of peacebuilding in Burundi, Liberia and \r\nSierra Leone is not only a reason for satisfaction but \r\nalso a reason for hope for other countries still in a state \r\nof conflict. At the same time, in many other situations, \r\nsuch as those in Côte d’Ivoire, the Sudan or in \r\nSomalia, the search for the way to solve those conflicts \r\nis still on the agenda. We wish to develop a natural \r\npartnership between our regional organization, the \r\nAfrican Union, and the United Nations in managing \r\nthese crises in accordance with the provisions of \r\nChapter VII of the Charter. This is the case in Côte \r\nd’Ivoire with the creation of an international working \r\ngroup. \r\n By deciding to hold the meeting of its Peace and \r\nSecurity Council on Darfur here in New York City, the \r\nAfrican Union has reiterated its willingness to consider \r\nall constructive proposals regarding this conflict. The \r\nAfrican Union’s unflagging efforts to ensure peace in \r\nDarfur has never been in question. The seriousness of \r\nthe situation in this region of the Sudan calls for more \r\nenergetic and more effective action. We solemnly call \r\non the Government of the Sudan to make a full \r\nassessment of the tragedy that is taking place before \r\nour eyes. \r\n In the case of Somalia, we appeal to the \r\ninternational community to provide its support to \r\nefforts to re-establish peace and reconciliation in \r\nSomalia. The international community must not lose \r\npatience faced with the meagre results in the search for \r\npeace in several of the African conflicts. The \r\ninternational community must provide strong support \r\nfor the efforts undertaken at many levels with, of \r\ncourse, the agreement of the countries concerned. As \r\nthe current chair of the African Union, we promise to \r\nwork fully to promote peace and security on the \r\ncontinent. \r\n I do not wish to end my statement on this subject \r\nwithout recognizing the courage of peacekeepers \r\nthroughout the world, especially in Africa. Our \r\ngratitude also goes out to the civil society and \r\nhumanitarian organizations that work courageously and \r\nwith dedication to relieve the suffering of people. \r\n One of the major challenges that I mentioned \r\nearlier is that of development. The international \r\ncommunity dealt especially with this question during \r\nthe Millennium Summit by establishing the \r\nMillennium Development Goals to be achieved before \r\n2015. The assessment that we conducted last year \r\nrevealed serious weaknesses. It was clearly apparent \r\nthat resources were lacking and that it was essential to \r\nlook for new sources of financing. \r\n Also, we must give due credit to the initial \r\nresponses to the appeal launched here a few months \r\nago during the High-Level meeting held on eradicating \r\nHIV/AIDS, within the framework of our commitment \r\nto achieve universal access to HIV/AIDS prevention, \r\ntreatment and care by 2010. \r\n We welcome the International Drug Purchase \r\nFacility (UNITAID) initiative launched by the French \r\nGovernment to mobilize resources derived from the \r\ntaxation of airplane tickets. Congo, among other \r\ncountries, has joined this initiative. This effort is in \r\nline with the Abuja Declaration and Framework for \r\nAction for the Fight Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis \r\nand Other Related Infectious Diseases. It is also in line \r\nwith the Brazzaville Commitment, which presents the \r\ncommon African position. The African Union summit \r\nalso declared a state of emergency in Africa with \r\nregard to those diseases. \r\n In discussing the issue of migration and \r\ndevelopment a few days ago in this Hall, the United \r\nNations took a look at an area of involvement that has \r\nnot been sufficiently studied, specifically that of \r\nindividuals and other entities — business and \r\n A/61/PV.11\r\n \r\n3 06-52737 \r\n \r\neconomic institutions — in bringing people together \r\nand sharing the common goods of our planet. \r\n The African Union, meeting in Banjul, took this \r\nopportunity to declare a common position that \r\nemphasized the positive nature of the role that should \r\nbe played by migration if it is correctly integrated into \r\nan approach to profitable development for the \r\nreceiving countries, as it is for the countries of origin \r\nof the migrants. \r\n Our Organization has launched a vast reform \r\nprogramme, of which some results are already tangible. \r\nA few moments ago, I talked about the establishment \r\nof the Human Rights Council, as well as the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission. Organizational reform \r\nseeks to adapt our Organization to changes that have \r\noccurred throughout the world over the past 60 years.  \r\n The African Union has made the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council and the reinvigoration of the General \r\nAssembly a major issue of concern. We must improve \r\nthe representative nature of the Security Council, \r\nwhich is the true lynchpin of the entire institutional \r\narchitecture of the United Nations. \r\n The African proposal for an equitable \r\nenlargement of the membership of the Council \r\nconstitutes a fundamental pursuit, which cannot be \r\nreplaced by simple palliative measures. We also \r\nbelieve that the Security Council must improve its \r\nprocedures and its working methods to lay the basis for \r\nconsensual work. On subjects as serious as counter-\r\nterrorism or nuclear non-proliferation, seeking a \r\nconsensus must continually be pursued through \r\ncooperation and dialogue. Between those who give \r\npriority to compliance with the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and those who, \r\nrightly or wrongly, call for effective, concomitant \r\ndisarmament and the recognition of a universal right of \r\naccess to technologies in all areas, there is no doubt \r\nmuch to be discussed, but this must be done in good \r\nfaith. \r\n We must refrain from radicalizing our attitudes \r\nby turning the discussion into a conflict of values or \r\ncivilizations, because, most often, the problem is really \r\nonly due to a lack of dialogue and communication. \r\n All these problems and challenges prove, if even \r\nthere was a need to do so, the importance of the United \r\nNations. The United Nations is necessary because it is \r\nthe instrument of international relations; it is the \r\nenzyme that can give us global peace and security; it \r\nis, really, the conscience of mankind. The world would \r\nnot be what it is, without the United Nations. \r\n Still, our Organization has not succeeded, in spite \r\nof this confident affirmation of its role, in changing \r\nwith times to fulfil the deepest aspirations of nations \r\nand peoples. We know that the United Nations can \r\nachieve that goal if the nations that created it, nations \r\nthroughout the world, from the most powerful to the \r\nmost humble, were to give to the United Nations, \r\nwithout hindrance or hypocrisy, the means that it needs \r\nto serve humanity. \r\n Africa, I can assure you, is prepared to do its part \r\nin this highly anticipated debate. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof the Congo for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Denis Sassou Nguesso, President of the \r\nRepublic of the Congo, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Vicente Fox, President of the United \r\nMexican States \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the United Mexican States. \r\n Mr. Vicente Fox, President of the United Mexican \r\nStates, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Vicente Fox, President of \r\nthe United Mexican States, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly. \r\n President Fox (spoke in Spanish): Twenty-one \r\nyears ago, on a day like today, a terrible earthquake \r\nbattered my country. We remember the victims, and we \r\nexpress our ongoing solidarity with their family \r\nmembers. \r\n Madam President, on behalf of Mexico, let me \r\ncongratulate you on your election to the presidency of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-first session. We wish \r\nyou every success. \r\n The Mexican people thank Mr. Jan Eliasson for \r\nhis leadership during the Assembly’s sixtieth session \r\nA/61/PV.11  \r\n \r\n06-52737 4 \r\n \r\nand for his contribution to the United Nations reform \r\nprocess. \r\n Mexico warmly welcomes the people of \r\nMontenegro to this Organization of free and juridically \r\nequal nations. We welcome all nations that today have \r\njoined the free and democratic nations, through \r\ngenuine representation of their peoples, and are united \r\nin the struggle against terrorism and in favour of \r\nhuman rights. \r\n A few days ago, we commemorated the fifth \r\nanniversary of a terrorist act that plunged many \r\nfamilies of this and other countries into mourning. We \r\noffer our sympathy to those who have suffered the \r\nviolence and cruelty of terrorism. Mexico strongly \r\ncondemns that terrible evil, as it condemns all acts of \r\naggression or violence. We repudiate any action that \r\nundermines peace or conflicts with the noble principles \r\nand purposes of our Organization. \r\n Throughout the past six decades, the peoples of \r\nthe United Nations have seen that the use of force does \r\nnot solve problems; on the contrary, it often aggravates \r\nthem. Peace and development are the fruit of mutual \r\nrespect and the cooperation to which such respect gives \r\nrise. \r\n The peoples of the United Nations are well aware \r\nthat the deterioration of peace and security is the result \r\nof insufficient international dialogue and cooperation. \r\nWe know, too, that many of the setbacks — such as \r\nthose in the field of disarmament and those that take \r\nthe form of aggression against other people or the \r\nenvironment — are caused by a lack of respect among \r\nnations. \r\n These are very challenging times. Our peoples \r\ntoday face such situations as the persistence of long-\r\nstanding international conflicts or the emergence of \r\nnew tensions and threats to international peace. They \r\nalso must tackle problems ranging from poverty, \r\ndisease and illiteracy to inequality of opportunity and \r\nthe urgent need for more inclusive dialogue aimed at \r\nincreasing mutual understanding. \r\n Humanity is desperately seeking respect, \r\nunderstanding, and cooperation among nations. There \r\nwill be no peace without respect among nations, no \r\ndevelopment without cooperation among them. \r\n These are challenging times, but also times of \r\nhope. I believe that hope and goodness alone can give \r\nus the necessary strength and drive to achieve our goals \r\nand fulfil our dreams. \r\n This house, the foremost of the international \r\nforums established by mankind, is built upon the \r\nprinciples and values shared by all peoples, the product \r\nof their common essence. Here, we summon up what is \r\nbest in us. Here, we show that what unites us is not \r\nforce and animosity, but hope and solidarity. Here, we \r\nare united by our ideals and our will to preserve future \r\ngenerations from the scourge of war. Here, we work \r\ntogether to foster the dignity and worth of the human \r\nperson, and, shoulder to shoulder, we promote the \r\neconomic and social progress of all of our peoples. \r\nHere, we make firm commitments, such as the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, and we work \r\nenthusiastically in order to go forward and achieve \r\nthose goals. This is no small task. There are many \r\nchallenges, because the goals are ambitious. The \r\nmagnitude of the challenges cannot and should not \r\novershadow the scope of our common will. \r\n Mexico’s message is one of hope and of faith in \r\nwhat we are capable of achieving together. It is a \r\nmessage of confidence in the work done by our United \r\nNations. This is the message of Mexico, whose people \r\nconquered democracy in 2000 and in so doing inspired \r\nhope for a new future of prosperity and justice. \r\n Mexico is a country with well-established \r\ninstitutions which guide and lead our nation. It is \r\ncurrently experiencing unprecedented freedoms. My \r\npeople live and work in peace, enjoy stability and have \r\ntheir eyes set on new horizons of well-being and \r\njustice. \r\n The democratic Mexico is firmly committed to \r\nprotecting human rights. We are very proud to be a \r\nfounding member of the Human Rights Council and to \r\noccupy its first presidency. We will continue working \r\nwith enthusiasm and determination in order to make \r\nthe Council an organ that responds effectively to the \r\nchallenges posed by human rights. \r\n Mexico is a country that cherishes its roots and \r\ntraditions and treasures its heritage as a land of many \r\nand diverse cultures. We prize the legacy of our \r\nindigenous peoples and are proud of our indigenous \r\npresent. We are actively engaged in the recognition and \r\npromotion of the rights of indigenous peoples at the \r\ninternational level. \r\n A/61/PV.11\r\n \r\n5 06-52737 \r\n \r\n In May, a Rarámuri woman from the state of \r\nChihuahua named Isabel said to me, “Mr. President, it \r\nis certainly true that all human beings are different \r\nfrom one another, that we see the world through \r\ndifferent lenses and that we do not all share the same \r\nbeliefs. Nevertheless, all human beings are equal in \r\ndignity and stature”. She asked me to pass on that \r\nmessage. I promised her that I would do so, and today I \r\nam keeping my word by bringing Isabel’s voice and \r\nthose of our other indigenous sisters and brothers to \r\nthis forum. Isabel’s voice is the voice of all Mexican \r\nwomen and men who are fighting discrimination. \r\n Thanks to the commitment of the members of the \r\nHuman Rights Council, the General Assembly will \r\nhave before it for consideration a draft United Nations \r\nDeclaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. On \r\nbehalf of the indigenous peoples of Mexico and of the \r\nrest of the world, I call upon each and every State \r\nMember of this Organization to adopt that draft \r\nDeclaration and to endow it with the means necessary \r\nfor it to promote respect for the rights of indigenous \r\npeoples. \r\n Five years ago, in a spirit of great enthusiasm and \r\nin the quest for a more just and human-centred world \r\nfor millions of people with disabilities, my country, \r\nMexico, presented the General Assembly with a \r\nproposal for a draft United Nations convention on the \r\nprotection and promotion of the rights and dignity of \r\npersons with disabilities. We now have a draft text that \r\nwill prompt Governments and society to pay more \r\nattention to people with disabilities. I urge all nations \r\nto sign and ratify that legal instrument — proposed by \r\nmy country and already endorsed by many of the \r\nnations represented here — with a view to creating a \r\nworld of greater justice, humanity and dignity for all. \r\n Mexico believes in the United Nations — in its \r\npresent and in its future. We have always worked here \r\nin a constructive manner, promoting consensus and \r\nharmony and putting forward initiatives to address the \r\ngreatest challenges of our times. \r\n I would like to thank and pay tribute to the heads \r\nof State of Algeria, Australia, Canada, Colombia, \r\nChile, Germany, Japan, Kenya, the Netherlands, New \r\nZealand, Pakistan, Singapore, Spain and Sweden for \r\ntheir support for the Mexican initiative to establish the \r\nGroup of Friends for United Nations Reform. Together, \r\nwe presented proposals that were taken up in the \r\nSecretary-General’s report of March 2005 (A/59/2005). \r\n I am certain that our commitment to reform of the \r\nUnited Nations will result in a stronger Organization \r\nthat is capable of accomplishing the lofty objectives for \r\nwhich it was created. Mexico is convinced of the need \r\nto promote a reform of the Security Council that can \r\nguarantee the Council’s representativeness, efficacy \r\nand transparency, as well as ensure accountability. That \r\nobjective will not be reached by creating new \r\npermanent seats. \r\n We are an Organization based on the principle of \r\nthe juridical equality of States. The reform of the \r\nSecurity Council should ensure more frequent \r\nparticipation by all Member States in the activities of \r\nthat body. That is why Mexico proposes an increase in \r\nthe number of non-permanent seats, with the \r\npossibility of immediate re-election. \r\n As this is the last time that I will speaking in the \r\nAssembly in my capacity as President of Mexico, I \r\nwould like to express my gratitude to all Member \r\nStates for their support for all of our efforts and \r\ninitiatives over the past six years. \r\n I would like to express my deep appreciation to \r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan, a good friend of \r\nMexico. He will be remembered for his efforts to \r\nreform and strengthen this Organization and for his \r\npassion for peace and harmony among nations. \r\n I would like to reaffirm my country’s \r\nunconditional commitment to the objectives of the San \r\nFrancisco Charter, to the reform process currently \r\nunder way and to our common quest for a world free \r\nfrom poverty, fear and despair — a world of mutual \r\nrespect, peace and harmony. \r\n From this rostrum I appeal, on behalf of Mexico, \r\nfor respect and peace among nations. In particular, I \r\ncall on the United Nations to continue to promote an \r\neffective peace process in the Middle East. \r\n There is no greater enemy or obstacle than \r\nhopelessness, unkindness and lack of solidarity. Let us \r\nbuild a future based on the strength of our ideals and \r\nvalues, confident that our United Nations can achieve \r\ngreat things. \r\n In the same spirit that made our peoples free, \r\nsovereign, democratic and human-centred nations, I \r\ninvite the Assembly today to set its sights on a future \r\nof greater freedom, justice, brotherhood and solidarity \r\namong human beings. \r\nA/61/PV.11  \r\n \r\n06-52737 6 \r\n \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the United \r\nMexican States for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Vicente Fox, President of the United Mexican \r\nStates, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mrs. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, President of \r\nthe Republic of Liberia \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Liberia. \r\n Mrs. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, President of the \r\nRepublic of Liberia, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations Her Excellency Mrs. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Liberia, and to invite her \r\nto address the Assembly. \r\n President Johnson-Sirleaf: It is a great honour \r\nfor me to address the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nfirst session on behalf of the people of Liberia, not just \r\nin my capacity as a leader, but as the first \r\ndemocratically elected woman President in Liberia and \r\nin Africa. \r\n Let me congratulate you, Madam, on your \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at this \r\nsession. We are proud of you, as the first Arab Muslim \r\nwoman and the third woman to occupy this noble \r\nposition. One of your women predecessors, Angie \r\nBrooks, hailed from Liberia. I was pleased to honour \r\nher last Friday in a moving ceremony here in New York \r\nfor her dedicated services to our country. \r\n Let me also seize this opportunity to pay a well-\r\ndeserved tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson \r\nof Sweden, for his insightful knowledge and \r\nenlightened leadership in steering the affairs of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixtieth session. \r\n I wish also to welcome and congratulate the \r\nRepublic of Montenegro for its admission as the one \r\nhundred ninety-second Member of the Organization \r\nand to assure its delegation of Liberia’s friendship, \r\nsolidarity and support. \r\n Let me now pay special tribute to Mr. Kofi \r\nAnnan, the outgoing Secretary-General. I had the \r\nprivilege of working with him as a former senior staff \r\nmember of the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme (UNDP), and I am personally aware of his \r\ndedication and commitment to the Organization, \r\nparticularly the reform of the United Nations and the \r\nstrengthening of its institutions. As I said to him during \r\nan honouring ceremony in Monrovia in July, we are \r\nproud of his record of enhancing the responsibility of \r\nthe United Nations: the responsibility to protect the \r\npoor from the rich; the weak from the strong; and the \r\nhumble from the arrogant. The Liberian people, and \r\nindeed all the people of Africa, are proud of him and \r\nhis accomplishments. \r\n Sixty-one years ago, when countries gathered in \r\nSan Francisco to address issues related to the scourge \r\nof, and the scars left by, the Second World War, and the \r\nneed for peace in a post-conflict world, Liberia was \r\nthere and was a signatory to the Charter of the United \r\nNations. The purposes and principles of the Charter \r\nhave proved to be of durable value over the years. \r\n Times have changed, and the world, too, has \r\nchanged, beyond what we could have imagined when \r\nthe Organization was established. Today we are truly a \r\nglobal village, interconnected physically and \r\nelectronically, increasingly bound by a shared \r\ncommitment to confront and overcome the challenges \r\nthat threaten global peace, stability and the well-being \r\nof our human family. \r\n Yet the original aims and objectives of the United \r\nNations remain today as relevant as they were when \r\nthe Charter of the Organization was signed 61 years \r\nago. The need to maintain international peace and \r\nsecurity, to cultivate friendly relations among nations, \r\nto achieve international cooperation in solving global \r\neconomic, cultural, social and humanitarian problems, \r\nand to promote respect for human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms constitute, and still remain, the \r\ncardinal objectives of the Organization. \r\n Thus the main focus of this year’s \r\ndeliberations — the implementation of a global \r\npartnership for development — serves to remind us \r\nthat at this session the General Assembly must \r\nvigorously consider how to bring equity to the present \r\ninternational financial, trade and development \r\nstructures; how to do more to create the conditions that \r\nwill improve the standard of living of humankind \r\neverywhere; how to be sensitive to the needs of \r\ndeveloping countries and assure them the dividends of \r\nglobalization. \r\n A/61/PV.11\r\n \r\n7 06-52737 \r\n \r\n In the new millennium, the United Nations should \r\nnot operate on the basis of structures designed 61 years \r\nago. We must therefore review the issue of the \r\ninequitable representation of the world’s peoples, as \r\nreflected by the present structure of the Security \r\nCouncil. It is in that regard that reform of the United \r\nNations is urgent, especially with respect to the \r\ndecision-making process in a Security Council which is \r\nundemocratic and hegemonic. The apparent continued \r\nviolations of the United Nations Charter by some \r\nMember States on account of national interests \r\nrepresent a disguised threat to world peace and \r\nsecurity. \r\n Hence we must now find an acceptable solution \r\nunder which nations large and small will receive equal \r\ntreatment, in consonance with the Charter. The United \r\nNations was conceived to promote world peace, \r\ndemocracy and equity for all. \r\n I strongly support women and gender equality, \r\nand I look forward with interest to the report of the \r\nHigh-level Panel on System-wide Coherence, \r\nappointed by the Secretary-General earlier this year. It \r\nis expected to submit its final recommendations on \r\nUnited Nations reform. It is my hope that the \r\nestablishment of a new, independent United Nations \r\nfund or programme for the empowerment of women \r\nand gender equality will be fully supported by Member \r\nStates, and that such a fund will have sufficient \r\nresources to support targeted programmes for the \r\nempowerment of women. \r\n Three years ago, representatives of contending \r\nwarring factions, political parties and civil society in \r\nLiberia gathered in Accra under the auspices of \r\ninternational partners and signed the Comprehensive \r\nPeace Agreement. Under provisions of that Agreement, \r\na National Transitional Government was installed in \r\nOctober, 2003, with a mandate to disarm combatants \r\nand prepare our country for elections. In October and \r\nNovember, 2005, legislative and presidential elections \r\nwere held, leading to our historic and landmark \r\nelection by the Liberian people. The United Nations \r\nplayed a pivotal role in that national transformation. \r\nFor and on behalf of the Liberian people, I wish to \r\nthank the United Nations and other international \r\npartners for the mammoth role they played in securing \r\npeace and bringing sanity to Liberia. \r\n I wish also to express the deep appreciation and \r\ngratitude of the people of Liberia and their friends \r\neverywhere to the men and women of the United \r\nNations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) for their active \r\nrole in securing and enhancing peace and security in \r\nour country. I am proud to say that the leadership, \r\ncommanders, men and women of the various \r\ncontingents of UNMIL have largely comported \r\nthemselves well and performed their mission with \r\ndiligence and dedication. They have sacrificed greatly \r\nand persevered in a very challenging peacekeeping \r\nenvironment. The Special Representative of the \r\nSecretary-General deserves particular commendation \r\nfor his foresight and support of our country’s \r\nreconstruction efforts. I thank them all sincerely on \r\nbehalf of the Liberian people. \r\n There are others to whom we owe a huge debt of \r\ngratitude. The Economic Community of West African \r\nStates (ECOWAS), the African Union, the United \r\nStates of America, the European Union and the \r\nPeople’s Republic of China have been selfless and \r\ngenerous in their material, financial and moral support \r\nof our cause. I would be remiss if I did not single out \r\nthe sacrifices made by our West African brothers and \r\nsisters to bring peace and sensibility to a suffering \r\npeople. We thank them. \r\n While we are enjoying a semblance of peace, we \r\nare particularly concerned about conflicts in other parts \r\nof the world. Of notable concern is the protracted crisis \r\nin the Middle East, which continues to create a state of \r\nrestlessness and threatens world peace and security. \r\nFrom our experience, we have learned that no matter \r\nhow protracted a conflict, the parties must sit around \r\nthe table to iron out their differences and make peace. \r\nBoth the Israeli and the Palestinian authorities owe \r\ntheir respective peoples, and the rest of us in the world, \r\nan obligation to break out of their cocoon of pride to \r\nresolve their differences harmoniously. We call for the \r\nactive engagement of the United Nations in the \r\npeaceful and amicable resolution of the Middle East \r\ncrisis. \r\n Elsewhere in Africa, and especially in \r\nneighbouring Côte d’Ivoire, the standoff in the peace \r\nprocess is troubling. We call on the parties in Côte \r\nd’Ivoire to save their people from further punishment \r\nby resolving their differences. We call upon the United \r\nNations to continue strong and decisive intervention to \r\nprevent it from becoming a wider subregional and \r\nregional crisis. \r\nA/61/PV.11  \r\n \r\n06-52737 8 \r\n \r\n The situation in Darfur and the slow pace with \r\nwhich it is being addressed require urgent attention. \r\nThe continued stalemate over whether an African \r\nUnion or a United Nations force should be deployed or \r\nmaintained in the region exposes weaknesses in \r\ninternational cooperation and collaboration and \r\ndemonstrates a lack of international will to address the \r\nsufferings and yearnings of the citizens and residents \r\nof Darfur, who plead everyday for international \r\nintervention. Darfur represents a potential \r\nhumanitarian catastrophe. The world must not allow a \r\nsecond Rwanda to happen. In the new millennium, \r\ncivilized nations must not be indifferent to any \r\nconflict, internal or external, regardless of the factors \r\nthat fuel it. \r\n The United Nations obligation to protect the \r\nhelpless and innocent must remain paramount in that \r\nregard. My Government therefore calls on this General \r\nAssembly and the Security Council to exercise \r\nChapter VII authority to restore peace, security and \r\nstability to Darfur. \r\n On the other hand, my delegation is pleased with \r\nthe successful holding of peaceful democratic elections \r\nin the Democratic Republic of Congo for the first time \r\nin 40 years. We look forward to seeing a peaceful \r\nconclusion of the final stage of that process and the \r\nushering-in of a Government elected by the people of \r\nthat country. It is our hope that the democratic gains \r\nmade in the Democratic Republic of the Congo will be \r\nsustained to enable the new Government to employ the \r\nvast national resources of that country for the benefit \r\nand welfare of its people. \r\n Globalization has significantly altered the world \r\nand economic transactions among States. Africa will \r\nremain on the periphery of the global village unless \r\nwe, as leaders, awaken to the imperatives of the ever-\r\nchanging requirements. The first step towards that \r\nprocess of awakening is the promotion of democracy, \r\nfree enterprise, good governance, human rights and \r\nsocial justice in our countries and across our continent. \r\n There is increasing evidence that shows a direct \r\ncorrelation between the material and moral well-being \r\nof a people and their country, and the quality of their \r\ndemocratic environment. My Government is keenly \r\naware of that reality. We have therefore promulgated \r\npolicies that support openness, transparency, \r\naccountability and the equitable distribution of our \r\nmeagre resources, while endeavouring to address the \r\ndevelopment and reconstruction challenges of the \r\ncountry. \r\n Five years ago on 11 September, 2001, a few \r\nmiles from this very Hall, terror of unimaginable \r\nproportions struck, shocked the world and claimed \r\nclose to 3,000 precious and innocent lives. As the \r\npeople of the United States and the families of the \r\ninnocent dead remember their tragic and irreparable \r\nloss this month, the people of Liberia join me in \r\naffirming our identification with their loss. We \r\nmourned with them then and we mourn with them now. \r\nWe also resolve, as all civilized nations should, to join \r\nthe global effort to fight terrorism anywhere in the \r\nworld, recognizing that it is today the most signal \r\nchallenge to world peace and collective freedom. \r\n The world has witnessed a significant \r\nachievement in science and technology, leading to \r\nrapid industrialization and the improvement of the \r\nstandards of living of humankind. Although the gains \r\nhave led to the development of new medicines and \r\nother scientific knowledge, they also pose a threat to \r\nthe environment and human survival. \r\n Rapid industrialization and scientific discoveries \r\ncan have a damaging impact on the environment. \r\nUnless there is a modification in our activities, the \r\npleasure derived from successes in scientific \r\nachievement could, sadly, lead to tragedy and doom. \r\n Thus, in the race for modernization and \r\ndevelopment, we cannot ignore the potency of the \r\nthreats posed to our survival by environmental \r\ndegradation. Saving the planet is required for the \r\ncontinued existence of its more than 5 billion \r\ninhabitants. \r\n It is in that regard that my delegation supports the \r\nefforts of the Commission on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, the Kyoto Protocol and the decision \r\nreached on Agenda 21 during the 1992 United Nations \r\nConference on Environment and Development, \r\nintended to raise international awareness about the \r\ndegradation of the environment and the need to reverse \r\nthe negative trend. We trust that environmental issues \r\nwill remain a priority on the global agenda. \r\n Among the many impediments to social and \r\neconomic development in Africa are poverty, poor \r\nhealth delivery systems, intraregional wars and civil \r\nconflicts. The devastating impact of HIV/AIDS, \r\nmalaria and other diseases has contributed significantly \r\n A/61/PV.11\r\n \r\n9 06-52737 \r\n \r\nto the slowing of progress on the African continent. \r\nWhile countries in the developed world are leaping \r\nahead in science and technology, we are still groping to \r\nfind the means to combat curable diseases and to join \r\nin the search to address incurable ones. \r\n The twenty-fifth anniversary of the emergence of \r\nHIV/AIDS brought into focus the recognition that that \r\ndeadly virus has eluded the sophistication of science \r\nand technology, thereby posing one of the greatest \r\nchallenges to our development effort. The political will \r\nof Africa is challenged to act speedily to eradicate the \r\nvirus and combat this health crisis. \r\n The Government of Liberia welcomes the partial \r\nlifting of the arms embargo and the ban on timber \r\nimposed by Security Council resolution 1521 (2003). \r\nWe also look forward to the lifting of the ban on \r\ndiamonds as we seek to meet the requirements of \r\nCouncil resolution 1343 (2001). My Government \r\npledges its fullest cooperation in the attainment of the \r\nobjectives set out in those resolutions. We remain \r\ngrateful to the international community for the \r\ncontinuous assistance and support provided to our \r\ncountry in its search for peace, security and post-war \r\nreconstruction and development. \r\n Today, I stand here in testimony to the rebirth of \r\nmy country — to our re-emergence to assume once \r\nmore our enviable and critical role as one of the first \r\nindependent African republics. We are aware that we \r\nface awesome challenges: the challenge of rebuilding \r\nour infrastructure, including education, health and \r\nother institutions; the challenge of addressing \r\ngenerations of gender imbalance, especially as it \r\nrelates to the education of the girl child; and the \r\nchallenge of promoting democracy, participation and \r\nfundamental freedoms and rights in an environment of \r\nequal opportunity. \r\n We have made important beginnings, and we \r\nremain encouraged by the bilateral support provided by \r\nour bilateral and multilateral international partners. \r\nThe recent visit of the Secretary-General and other \r\nsimilarly important visits by leaders of our continent \r\nand of international financial institutions clearly \r\nunderscore the commitment of the United Nations and \r\nthe rest of the international community to working with \r\nour Government to nurture and strengthen peace and to \r\nfoster development. \r\n In closing, let me say that today, as in the past, \r\nLiberia wishes to reaffirm its commitment to the \r\nUnited Nations, this timeworn but irreplaceable \r\nmachinery and indispensable framework for \r\ninternational peace and international relations. We \r\nmust all join our steadfast forces to make this \r\ninstitution work for the good of humankind. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Liberia for the statement she has just made. \r\n Mrs. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, President of the \r\nRepublic of Liberia, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by His Majesty King Abdullah Bin  \r\nAl Hussein, King of the Hashemite Kingdom  \r\nof Jordan \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the King of the Hashemite \r\nKingdom of Jordan. \r\n King Abdullah Bin Al Hussein, King of the \r\nHashemite Kingdom of Jordan, was escorted into \r\nthe General Assembly Hall. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Majesty King Abdullah Bin Al \r\nHussein, King of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n King Abdullah Bin Al Hussein: May I extend \r\nthe warmest congratulations to you, Sheikha Haya, on \r\nyour election as President of the General Assembly. \r\nAllow me also to say a word of gratitude and \r\nadmiration to Secretary-General Kofi Annan. Jordan \r\napplauds the progress achieved in United Nations \r\nreform under Secretary-General Annan’s tenure. In \r\nparticular, we welcome the recent creation of the \r\nHuman Rights Council and of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission. \r\n I come before the Assembly today with a deep \r\nsense of urgency. Never has it been more important for \r\nthe world community to act decisively for peace in my \r\nregion. The recent crisis in the Middle East is a crisis \r\nfor all nations. There can be no just global order when \r\naggression and occupation are permitted to take the \r\nplace of international law. When these occur in a \r\nregion as strategic as the Middle East, the shockwaves \r\nrun worldwide. Our young people are asking, where is \r\nthe justice, where is the will, of the global community? \r\nWe must answer them by establishing a lasting peace \r\nA/61/PV.11  \r\n \r\n06-52737 10 \r\n \r\nbased on the international legality that we have \r\npledged to uphold. \r\n That means a new focus on the core problem. The \r\nregion’s contemporary crises are outgrowths of a \r\ncentral grievance felt throughout the Middle East and, \r\nindeed, the world. That grievance, plain and simple, is \r\nIsraeli occupation and the denial, over decades, of \r\nPalestinian rights. Until we end that wrong, conflict \r\nwill breed more conflict, year after year. \r\n The Middle East conflict has repeatedly come \r\nbefore this institution. And the United Nations position \r\nhas been repeatedly articulated in resolutions \r\ncondemning aggression and occupation, affirming \r\nPalestinian self-determination and supporting a process \r\nfor peace. Yet, each year without progress has brought \r\nus another crisis, more suffering and more division. It \r\nis time to take a better path. \r\n We must, of course, respond immediately to help \r\nthose who suffer the terrible destruction of conflict. In \r\nLebanon we must ensure that the Government can \r\nextend its sovereignty and control over all Lebanese \r\nterritory. The Arab world and the international \r\ncommunity must make every effort and must support \r\nreconstruction and development. Those are vital \r\nmeasures; but in the Middle East they are only partial \r\nmeasures. \r\n We can solve the Arab-Israeli conflict only by \r\naddressing the issue at its core: the restoration of \r\ninternationally recognized Palestinian rights. In 2002, \r\nthe 22 Arab States — agreeing unanimously — led the \r\nway with a breakthrough peace proposal. Our vision \r\nand our commitment is a viable and independent \r\nPalestinian State living side by side with a secure \r\nIsrael. Under the Arab peace initiative, Israel’s security \r\nwould be guaranteed and the occupation of Palestine \r\nwould end, in accordance with United Nations \r\nresolutions. \r\n Events show clearly that there can be no \r\nunilateral solution to the conflict. There must be a \r\ngenuine partnership among all parties, in the context of \r\ninternational legality and justice. \r\n Such a global partnership for peace is directly \r\nconnected to the global partnership for development. \r\nAround the world, nations at peace are moving forward \r\nwith economic growth and development: investing in \r\neducation, building communities and helping to shape \r\nthe future of the world. But no nation succeeds in \r\nisolation. All nations and all people — especially our \r\nyoung people — must be able to share in a promising \r\nfuture. \r\n We must make peace a priority. We must do so \r\nnow. No session of this great institution could make a \r\ngreater contribution to a future of justice and hope. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the King of the Hashemite \r\nKingdom of Jordan for the statement he has just made. \r\n His Majesty King Abdullah Bin Al Hussein, King \r\nof the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, was \r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall. \r\nMr. Wali (Nigeria), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. John Agyekum Kufuor, President of \r\nthe Republic of Ghana \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nGhana. \r\n Mr. John Agyekum Kufuor, President of the \r\nRepublic of Ghana, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. John Agyekum Kufuor, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Ghana, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly. \r\n President Kufuor: Ghana, like many other \r\nnations here, is delighted and feels proud that a \r\ndistinguished lady endowed with excellent diplomatic \r\nskills has been elected to the presidency of this body. \r\nWe have no doubt that she will continue the skilful \r\nstewardship of her predecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, the \r\nForeign Minister of Sweden, who presided over the \r\nsixtieth session of the General Assembly. \r\n Ghana would also like to welcome the Republic \r\nof Montenegro as the 192nd Member of the United \r\nNations, and looks forward to the day when the \r\nOrganization will attain full global and universal \r\nmembership. \r\n A year ago, we met at this historic venue to adopt \r\nthe 2005 World Summit Outcome Document \r\n(resolution 60/1), in which we acknowledged that \r\npeace and security and development and human rights \r\n A/61/PV.11\r\n \r\n11 06-52737 \r\n \r\nwere the pillars of the United Nations system and the \r\nfoundations of our collective well-being. We also \r\nrecognized that those pillars were interlinked and \r\nmutually reinforcing and that, while each country had \r\nthe primary responsibility for its own development, \r\nindividual efforts should be complemented by \r\nsupportive global programmes, measures and policies \r\naimed at expanding development opportunities, \r\nespecially for developing countries. \r\n Ghana therefore attaches the utmost importance \r\nto the Summit’s decision that developing countries \r\nshould adopt and begin to implement by 2006 such \r\nrequisite national strategies as would enable them to \r\nachieve the goals and objectives that have been agreed \r\nupon, including the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). Ghana has therefore been working \r\nrelentlessly towards that end, in the firm belief that our \r\ndevelopment partners, both bilateral and multilateral, \r\nwill support us in our efforts to improve the living \r\nconditions of our people. For effective implementation, \r\nall concerned must show commitment and dispatch. \r\n Ghana recognizes good governance as crucial to \r\nsustainable development. We have therefore worked \r\nassiduously at establishing a robust culture of \r\ndemocracy, sound economic management and \r\nadherence to the rule of law. The free and fair elections \r\nthat have been held successfully in Ghana over the past \r\n15 years bear eloquent testimony to the determination \r\nof Ghanaians to create an equitable, free and stable \r\nsociety in which each individual can develop his or her \r\nfull potential. The media, freed from intimidating \r\nlegislation, have blossomed into a vibrant watchdog for \r\nthe probity and accountability expected of the \r\ngovernors and the responsibility expected of the \r\ncitizens. \r\n It is against that background that Ghana readily \r\nsubmitted itself to the African Peer Review Mechanism \r\nunder the New Partnership for Africa’s Development to \r\nhave an objective assessment of its institutional \r\nstructures and their functioning for the improvement of \r\nits governance. \r\n But our collective objective within this \r\nOrganization to alleviate the economic plight of the \r\nmajority of mankind may continue to elude us unless \r\nthe pursuit of international peace and security is \r\neffectively and satisfactorily addressed. Ghana \r\ntherefore views with grave concern the continuing \r\nspread and persistence of terrorist activities. The \r\ninternational community must rally to contain and \r\neffectively eradicate that menace to mankind. \r\n In that regard, the Secretary-General’s proposal \r\nfor a Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy is welcome. \r\nIndeed, it is the view of Ghana that there must be a \r\nquick conclusion of the deliberations on the proposed \r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism. \r\n Yet another scourge to the security of the world \r\nare the snail-paced talks on the elimination of nuclear \r\nweapons and the added threat of the proliferation of \r\nthose weapons. Ghana shares the concerns of the \r\nmajority of Member States that this body must \r\ncontinue with and intensify its pressure for the total \r\nelimination of those weapons, for as long as 27,000 \r\nnuclear weapons continue to exist, as they do now, our \r\nworld will remain vulnerable to the threat of mass \r\ndestruction. \r\n We make this appeal not unaware of the positive \r\nuses of nuclear energy, but so long as those nations \r\nwhich already possess these weapons and those on the \r\nverge of breaking into the mastery of the technology do \r\nnot show transparency with their know-how, the world \r\nwill feel insecure. So Ghana appeals to such nations to \r\nshow candour and transparency in their cooperation \r\nwith the International Atomic Energy Agency by their \r\ncompliance with the terms of the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons. \r\n The spread of small arms and light weapons is yet \r\nanother scourge, especially for Africa. This \r\nOrganization’s collective efforts to rein in that menace \r\nsince 2001 have indeed yielded significant results. \r\nHowever, we are still far from achieving the desired \r\ntarget. That was borne out by the outcome of the recent \r\nReview Conference of the United Nations Programme \r\nof Action. Ghana therefore welcomes the current \r\nmomentum within the international community to \r\nmove closer to the ultimate goal of drastically \r\nremoving the menace. \r\n Without a doubt, the United Nations \r\nresponsibility for maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity has been tremendously facilitated by \r\npeacekeeping operations in many troubled spots around \r\nthe world. Ghana has been a dedicated and regular \r\ncontributor to those operations. It is thus committed \r\nbecause of its conviction that the lack of peace and \r\nstability in any country can have far-reaching negative \r\nrepercussions beyond its immediate borders. We \r\ntherefore commend moves to enhance the United \r\nA/61/PV.11  \r\n \r\n06-52737 12 \r\n \r\nNations peacekeeping activities that bring hope to \r\nvictims of conflict. \r\n African nations are more and more demonstrating \r\ntheir proactive commitment to the management and \r\nresolution of conflicts on their continent. That is why \r\nGhana commends and supports the Secretary-General’s \r\ndetermination to take the necessary measures to effect \r\nthe envisaged close partnership between the \r\nOrganization and the African Union in that sphere, \r\nwith particular reference to Darfur, in order to save the \r\nmany lives threatened by the looming crisis there. \r\nDeepening Africa’s peacekeeping capacity to meet that \r\nchallenging mission through training, logistical and \r\nfinancial support is crucial to the success of that goal. \r\nThe decision taken at the 2005 World Summit in that \r\nregard must therefore be expeditiously implemented. \r\n A monumental product of the Summit was the \r\nbirth of the Peacebuilding Commission, of which \r\nGhana is a member. Our expectation is that the 30-\r\nmember Commission will discharge its functions \r\ndiligently. Another significant milestone achieved by \r\nthis Organization was the establishment of the Human \r\nRights Council. I must express appreciation to this \r\nAssembly for electing Ghana with the highest number \r\nof votes to the Council. \r\n The many resolutions and the launching of \r\nvarious Commissions clearly indicate the \r\ndetermination of our Organization to make the world a \r\nbetter and safer place for mankind. The truth is, \r\nhowever, that if this desire is to be actualized, the \r\nUnited Nations must undergo more radical reforms and \r\nbe better equipped to effectively implement its \r\ndecisions. Such a streamlined Organization will create \r\nthe critical mass for tackling effectively the many \r\nchallenges that threaten international peace and \r\nsecurity. Thus, the debate to reform the Security \r\nCouncil based on the principles of democracy, the \r\nsovereign equality of States and equitable geographical \r\nrepresentation, among others, is very much in order \r\nand must be supported. \r\n Permit me at this stage to try to discharge an \r\nhonourable duty that I feel uniquely placed to \r\nundertake. That is to pay tribute to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, who is my compatriot and \r\nmy friend, at the end of his exemplary tenure. He has \r\nbrought much honour and distinction to our nation, \r\nGhana, by his excellent stewardship of the United \r\nNations over the past 10 years. Indeed, his entire adult \r\ncareer over the past 40 years has been at the exclusive \r\nservice of this Organization, through the ranks of \r\nwhich he rose until he attained the pinnacle 10 years \r\nago. His dedicated and illustrious service during the \r\nfirst 30 years led to his historic election as the first-\r\never career officer to become Secretary-General. \r\n Destiny also marked him out as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to see out the last century and also usher the \r\nOrganization into the twenty-first century. It cannot be \r\ndisputed that these 10 years of his tenure have \r\nwitnessed the phenomenal acceleration of the world in \r\nthe process towards globalization. He can also claim \r\nsome credit for having succeeded in shepherding our \r\nOrganization deftly through the complicated and \r\ntransformational challenges that the times confronted it \r\nwith. He has been able to provide this masterful \r\nleadership not only through competent administration, \r\nbut also in ideas as well as lofty humanistic ideals. His \r\nvision for a more proactive Organization, able to \r\nrespond to the challenges of the twenty-first century, \r\nhas been lucidly published in his report “In larger \r\nfreedom: towards development, security and human \r\nrights for all”. \r\n He is a much decorated personality all over the \r\nworld, and his winning the Nobel Peace Prize \r\nespecially attests to the quality of the human being he \r\nis. There is no doubt that he retires with an enviable \r\nlegacy of contributing immensely to shaping the \r\ndestiny of this Organization and the affairs of the \r\nworld. Ghana is proud of him and looks forward to \r\nreceiving him heroically at home. I say to him in our \r\nlanguage “Ayekoo”, meaning “well done!” \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Ghana for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. John Agyekum Kufuor, President of the \r\nRepublic of Ghana, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Moritz Leuenberger, President of the \r\nSwiss Confederation \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by His Excellency Mr. Moritz \r\nLeuenberger, President of the Swiss Confederation. \r\n Mr. Moritz Leuenberger, President of the Swiss \r\nConfederation, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n A/61/PV.11\r\n \r\n13 06-52737 \r\n \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Moritz Leuenberger, \r\nPresident of the Swiss Confederation, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly. \r\n President Leuenberger (spoke in French): We \r\nrecently celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the death \r\nof Albert Einstein. He recommended the construction \r\nof the atomic bomb to President Roosevelt, yet always \r\ndescribed himself as a militant pacifist. He shared his \r\nqualms of conscience with Sigmund Freud. In the \r\ncourse of their correspondence, the two men agreed in \r\nparticular that, if all peoples were to live in peace on \r\nthis planet, the world needed an international \r\norganization with which all people could identify. \r\nEmpathy towards that organization could provide it \r\nwith the authority to counter war. It was in that \r\nconviction and with the same emotion that the men and \r\nwomen of my country voted in favour of Switzerland’s \r\naccession to the United Nations almost five years ago. \r\n Today, I affirm that we are glad to have taken that \r\nstep. \r\n Switzerland may not have experienced war within \r\nits own borders for a number of centuries, but that is \r\nnot enough to satisfy us, for war is not only there \r\nwhere bombs fall, killing men, women and children. \r\nWe are all involved in the conflicts that ravage our \r\nplanet. So long as these wars continue, no one can talk \r\nconvincingly of peace. We can overcome that feeling \r\nof powerlessness in the face of armed conflict by \r\njoining together to work towards peace. The country \r\nthat I have the honour to represent is convinced that the \r\nUnited Nations is the most important means of \r\npursuing that vision. The United Nations embodies our \r\nhopes for peace, solidarity and justice throughout the \r\nworld. \r\n Only through a common alliance of all nations do \r\nwe have that opportunity. No country is capable of \r\nmeeting the challenges of globalization alone. War, \r\nterrorism, drug trafficking, the offshoring of jobs and \r\nenvironmental and climate-related disasters are all \r\nglobal threats. They know no borders, not even those \r\nof powerful nations. No State, not even the strongest, is \r\nthe master of its own fate. Only through an inclusive \r\nnetwork with universally applicable norms can might \r\nand violence be replaced by justice. The United \r\nNations has been the world’s most successful effort to \r\nachieve that end. \r\n Every nation and every community is guided by \r\nits own historical and cultural experiences in dealing \r\nwith conflicts. Nations behave and organize themselves \r\naccordingly. In Switzerland, our values are based on \r\nthe three pillars of democracy, the rule of law and \r\nsocial equilibrium. That influences our view of how the \r\ninternational community could address conflicts \r\nworldwide by helping the victims of violence or \r\ndisaster, establishing a legal system and enforcing it, \r\nand examining the deeper causes of violence and \r\nseeking to redress them. \r\n The first reaction of a human being towards a \r\nsuffering victim is to help that person. The United \r\nNations has stood by victims of natural disasters with \r\nhumanitarian assistance, be it after a tsunami or in a \r\ndrought. It also assists people affected by war. In so \r\ndoing, it has succeeded in building up positive empathy \r\nand in strengthening trust in it worldwide. \r\n Should the United Nations fail in its humanitarian \r\ntask, however, desperation and the tendency towards \r\nviolence increase and intensify conflicts. That can be \r\nseen with brutal clarity in the Middle East and in \r\nDarfur. \r\n Why should the international community not \r\nestablish norms just like a State does? I refer here to \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals, human rights, the \r\nclimate change Protocol and international law. States \r\nhave adopted penal codes to prosecute criminals, bring \r\nthem before a court, sentence them and have their \r\nsentence enforced. Doing justice to victims prevents \r\nacts of vengeance and a never-ending spiral of further \r\nviolence. It also serves as a deterrent to potential \r\ncriminals. \r\n What is good for a State should also be good for \r\nthe international community. It must treat war \r\ncriminals according to the same rules. The \r\ninternational community has to fight terrorism. There \r\nis no alternative to absolute respect for the rule of law, \r\nhuman rights and international law. The Geneva \r\nConventions are no hindrance to that; on the contrary, \r\nif the appropriate instruments are lacking, new ones \r\ncan be created, such as the convention on terrorism. \r\nAbove all, however, we must not betray our principles \r\nand our values. Torture or any other illegal procedure \r\nhas no place in our struggle and represents the radical \r\nnegation of the rule of law. Recourse to such means \r\nstrips the fight against terrorism of all its legitimacy. \r\nA/61/PV.11  \r\n \r\n06-52737 14 \r\n \r\n The establishment of the International Criminal \r\nCourt (ICC) was a key date in the history of humanity. \r\nIt is in this Court that war criminals are tried, found \r\nguilty and sentenced. Unfortunately, the process can \r\nsometimes take a long time, as we have seen in the \r\ncase of Liberia, and sometimes it can take far too much \r\ntime, as in the case of the Balkans. War criminals must \r\nbe extradited so that justice can be done. All war \r\ncriminals, including those from the Darfur conflict, \r\nmust be made aware of the consequences of their \r\ncrimes and know that they will not go unpunished. \r\n Respect for the law implies that all States, from \r\nthe smallest to the largest, become parties to the ICC \r\nStatute. Public international law, while it is of \r\nfundamental importance for small countries which are \r\nunable to defend themselves on their own, also serves \r\nthe interests of large States, and even super-Powers, if \r\nthey do not want to find themselves accused of \r\narbitrary acts of imperialism. \r\n We all know that no State can function purely on \r\nthe basis of laws and ordinances. Laws and ordinances \r\nmust have the full support of the public. The same is \r\ntrue for the United Nations. That is why the Human \r\nRights Council in Geneva will search for solutions \r\nthrough dialogue partnerships rather than by issuing \r\nthreats. That will take time, a great deal of time. The \r\nexistence of the Peacebuilding Commission at the \r\nUnited Nations clearly shows that the United Nations \r\npeacekeepers cannot bring about or enforce peace by \r\nthemselves. There need to be blueprints for peace and \r\nexpert evaluations, together with a long-term “variable-\r\ngeometry” commitment on the part of the international \r\ncommunity, in order to prevent conflicts. \r\n Critics who believed that the United Nations was \r\nincapable of reform now have before them proof to the \r\ncontrary. By establishing a Human Rights Council and \r\na Peacebuilding Commission, the United Nations has \r\ndemonstrated that it wanted to give new life to values \r\nsuch as the protection of human rights and that it could \r\ndevelop new peacekeeping instruments. \r\n Just as a democracy strives to involve all its \r\ncitizens in political decisions, regardless of their \r\nbackground or financial standing, the United Nations \r\nmust not allow small groups of States or individual \r\nStates to impose their law on others. A broad consensus \r\nmust prevail. That is why we would like to see the \r\nreform and enlargement of the Security Council, which \r\nwould undoubtedly strengthen its legitimacy. Given \r\nthat we have still a long way to go before that point is \r\nreached, let us, rather, remain pragmatic and content \r\nourselves with short-term improvements to the \r\nCouncil’s working methods, in particular, the right of \r\nveto. \r\n Every State will try to find the underlying causes \r\nof threats to its cohesion and endeavour to overcome \r\nthem, and so it is with a community of States. \r\n Environmental disasters give rise to mass \r\nmigration and legions of refugees. The signatories of \r\nthe Kyoto Protocol want to cut off this evil at the root. \r\nBut, here again, all States, without exception, must set \r\nfor themselves the same goals as were set at Kyoto \r\nand, above all, take appropriate measures. \r\n Every military conflict and every terrorist attack \r\nstems from economic inequalities and social injustices. \r\nThat is why we must do our utmost to fight poverty, \r\nlack of future prospects and political impotence. \r\n Religious conflicts are also born of economic and \r\nsocial inequalities. In reality, the East-West divide is \r\nperhaps more a North-South divide. If we want to \r\npromote religious tolerance, we must pay the price, \r\nwhich is greater social and economic justice. By \r\nadopting the Millennium Development Goals, the \r\nworld has set itself the task of reducing extreme \r\npoverty by half by 2015. Let us give ourselves and the \r\nUnited Nations the means for keeping that promise. \r\n It is through dialogue that it is possible to address \r\nthe conflict in the Middle East, the stabilization of Iraq \r\nand the nuclear crisis with Iran, and all the parties \r\nconcerned should do everything they can to avoid \r\nfanning the flames of discord. Respect for the basic \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations is just \r\nas essential. In other words, no State is entitled to deny \r\nthe right of another to exist. Lastly, we cannot \r\ndisappoint those who aspire to self-determination if \r\nthey have the law on their side. \r\n When there is a clash of cultures, the response \r\nmust be dialogue between cultures and between \r\nreligions. We have no other choice. Humiliation and \r\nlack of respect for other cultures undoubtedly serve as \r\nbreeding grounds for terrorism. Since all States are \r\nrepresented here, the United Nations is a forum unlike \r\nany other. We are looking forward to the issuance of \r\nthe report on the alliance of civilizations by the High-\r\nlevel Group appointed by the Secretary-General. \r\nSwitzerland will be very active in this endeavour. \r\n A/61/PV.11\r\n \r\n15 06-52737 \r\n \r\n Switzerland is a neutral country. Our neutrality \r\nhas never authorized us to look upon the world with \r\nindifference or to stand on the sidelines. It has always \r\nmeant that we have the obligation to work to establish \r\npeace. We have never wanted to be, and have never \r\nbeen, neutral towards victims of oppression and \r\nviolence or the rules of the international community \r\nand of international law. The only legitimate ally of a \r\nneutral country is public international law. Neutrality \r\nmeans refusing all forms of hegemony and \r\nchampioning the peaceful coexistence of all countries, \r\nwhich all enjoy equal rights. That is how Switzerland \r\nunderstands neutrality and how it intends to exercise it \r\nhere. \r\n As I said at the outset, Albert Einstein concluded \r\nthat the empathy that people would come to feel for \r\ncommunity institutions could become the means to \r\nprevent war. But how is such empathy brought about? \r\nIt develops thanks to people who, in word and deed, \r\ncommit themselves in these institutions and thereby \r\ngenerate optimism about justice and peace. \r\n Secretary-General Kofi Annan is one of these \r\npeople. He has given the United Nations the face it has \r\ntoday, thank to his commitment in all areas of United \r\nNations activity, sometimes in the most delicate of \r\nsituations. We are greatly indebted to him, and we ask \r\nhim to accept our very sincere thanks. Switzerland is \r\nparticularly grateful for his personal involvement in \r\nsupport of our country’s joining the United Nations. \r\nAnd yes, I confirm once again today, we are glad that \r\nwe took that step. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Swiss \r\nConfederation for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Moritz Leuenberger, President of the Swiss \r\nConfederation, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. José Manuel Zelaya Rosales, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Honduras \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nHonduras. \r\n Mr. José Manuel Zelaya Rosales, President of the \r\nRepublic of Honduras, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. José Manuel Zelaya \r\nRosales, President of the Republic of Honduras, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Zelaya Rosales (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nfeel very honoured to be the emissary of the Honduran \r\npeople, who send to all at this General Assembly \r\nbrotherly, warm and effusive greetings on the occasion \r\nof the sixty-first session of the Assembly. \r\n We come here today before the representatives of \r\nthe nations of the world to merge the larger part of our \r\ndreams and hopes in order, together, to achieve the \r\ngreatest goals for world peace. Our high aspirations, \r\nalong with the worthiness of the members of the \r\nAssembly, are part of humanity’s common purpose of \r\nattaining international law and justice. \r\n But we also have to recognize that there are \r\nthings that are difficult to understand in an \r\nenvironment that is supposed to be conducive to peace \r\nand development: the contrast we see among different \r\nlatitudes of the Earth; the immense needs of peoples; \r\nthe contrast of poverty; drums of war that resound \r\neverywhere; nuclear threats; cruel situations for nations \r\nand peoples. \r\n Rather than narrowing, social divides have grown \r\nwider in recent decades. Morality is not being \r\ncombined with economy or science. Morality is \r\nmoving away from the principles and values of a just \r\nand true God. That is why our presence in this \r\nimportant Assembly is needed to focus clearly on the \r\nfact that humanity needs to seek its objectives \r\naccording to healthy principles that will dignify our \r\npeoples. \r\n When the last half of the twentieth century came \r\nto an end, we sincerely believed that we had put an end \r\nto political, ideological and religious tyrannies. But \r\ntoday we see them cropping up again, together with the \r\ntyrannies of trade, which are often more cruel than the \r\nothers. Today, they want to sell us a free-market policy, \r\nbut ultimately that is a ruthless, insensitive economic \r\npolicy that is protectionist for many sectors. Instead of \r\nopening the door to a social approach to the market, \r\nwhere freedom is for people, we only have freedom for \r\ninvestment, and we forget about individuals and \r\ncitizens and the rights of women and children, the most \r\nvulnerable groups who, although lacking in power, \r\nyearn for a better life. \r\nA/61/PV.11  \r\n \r\n06-52737 16 \r\n \r\n Certainly, we need to have protection, but not just \r\nprotection for investments and big capital. We also \r\nneed protection for the vulnerable of the world: for \r\nchildren and young people, for farmers who sow their \r\nsmall plots; for those businesspeople who cannot get a \r\nfoothold on the ladder of international trade; for the \r\nowners of microenterprises who are reaching out in \r\nsearch for the well-being and dignity they deserve. \r\n All of us, of course, want a free market, but an \r\nethical one. We want to live in a globalized world — \r\nbut one in which respect for identity, patriotism and the \r\ndignity and sovereignty of peoples are also global. So \r\nwe are here to denounce hypocrisy, double-talk and \r\nmoral double standards on the part of those who \r\nproclaim and promote a solution to our problems \r\nthrough democracy and free trade, but who seize and \r\nhold hostage the concepts of internal and external \r\nspaces and promote a system of privileges, oligopolies \r\nand monopolies, half-truths and flawed markets that \r\nthey hold captive. They are insensitive to the demands \r\nof the majority, very often tortured by hunger, \r\nunemployment, indifference and exclusion. \r\n We have come to this Assembly to wish everyone \r\nthe best, but also to point the finger at those who \r\npreach false free trade that only deepens poverty and \r\nseek to seduce us with the erratic mirage of remittances \r\nthat we so easily accept but which in fact are the fruit \r\nof a labour force that we have exported; the result of \r\nthe cruel fate of our emigrants; the inexorable and evil \r\ntragedy of people caught between freedom, \r\nmarginalization and slavery. \r\n My Government and the people of Honduras \r\ncondemn the monopolistic controls, the privileges and \r\nthe absurd exceptions that prevent us from building \r\ntrue freedom with democracy and market access, the \r\nparadigm that we all want to move towards without the \r\nprotectionism we all condemn. \r\n The Governments of the world must be led by \r\nmen and women who long for peace and not by \r\nmultinational corporations that promote war. Here, \r\ncivil society organizations could play a major role in \r\ncorrecting this situation and denouncing it. \r\n I represent Honduras, a country of the Isthmus of \r\nCentral America, and, like our Central American \r\nbrothers and sisters, we continue to face the \r\ninnumerable paradoxes that arise between civilization \r\nand barbarism. We have been the historical theatre of \r\nabsurd wars, ambitions and sterile battles, very often \r\nexported, and the horrors of death and pillage. Yet the \r\npeoples of Central America are in the vanguard of \r\nthose looking for joint solutions. We have the creative \r\ncapacity that keeps us from losing faith or hope in a \r\nbetter world. \r\n America has been inspired throughout history by \r\ngreat men and women of renown. Here in North \r\nAmerica, Lincoln was a splendid guide for democracy. \r\nIn the South, it was Sucre, San Martín and Bolívar; \r\nJosé Martí in the Caribbean; Villa and Zapata in \r\nMexico. And in Central America, we have Jerez, Mora, \r\nValle, Darío, Turcios, Omar Torrijos and the pro-union \r\nmartyr Francisco Morazán, among others. The Chilean \r\npoet, Pablo Neruda, Nobel laureate for literature, said \r\nit well: \r\n “Deep in the night Morazán is watchful. \r\n Is it today? Yesterday? Tomorrow? You know the \r\nanswer, \r\n Central ribbon, slender America, \r\n ... \r\n Raised up on emerald sea-feathers: \r\n Territory, unity, slim goddess \r\n Born in the water-foam battle. \r\n They destroy your sons, and worms \r\n Spread their pestilence over you. \r\n ... \r\n Now comes the axe-brandishing tiger. \r\n They come to devour your entrails. \r\n They come, fragrant little America, \r\n To nail you to the cross, to flay you, \r\n To cast down the metal blazoned on your banner. \r\n Invaders fill your dwelling-place \r\n And toss you aside like lifeless fruit, \r\n ... \r\n And others plunder your ports ... \r\n Is it today? Yesterday? Tomorrow? You know the \r\nanswer. \r\n Brothers, awaken. And Morazán is watchful.” \r\n We, the Central American peoples, stand tall, \r\nready to take the opportunities offered by development \r\nand genuine free trade, seeking our common destiny, \r\nseeking it today — which is not the end of history, but \r\nthe beginning of a new era for humanity, if we shoulder \r\nour responsibility and commitment. We have not lost \r\nour desire for liberty or our longing for hope. We \r\ncontinue to fight for food security, for energy \r\nindependence, for the social morality that we all \r\n A/61/PV.11\r\n \r\n17 06-52737 \r\n \r\ndeserve and for an economy that is at the service of \r\nmarkets, yes, but also at the service of people. We form \r\na common front against poverty and against the \r\ncorruption which today is invading our culture at many \r\nlevels. Unless we overcome this, we cannot win \r\ngenuine sovereignty. \r\n Central America opens itself to the world so that \r\nthe world can open itself to Central America. We are \r\nprepared for investment in tourism and in various areas \r\nof our economy and society. We are ready in Central \r\nAmerica — El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Costa \r\nRica, Panama, Belize and now the Dominican \r\nRepublic. We represent this central waistband of \r\nAmerica, this bridge of trade and markets — a bridge \r\nto a free world, a better world. \r\n Time limitations prevent me from addressing all \r\nthe other important topics. Allow me to conclude this \r\nbrief statement by expressing wishes for true peace and \r\nopportunity for everyone, in the conviction that the \r\npeoples of the world can exist only when in the heart of \r\nman there is fear of the wisdom of God. \r\n Let us all say yes to the loving God, to that God \r\nthat considers man a brother to man and not an enemy \r\nof man — to that God of non-violence. That is the God \r\nwe hymn and glorify, and we in Central America and \r\nHonduras join together in a song of hope: \r\n “Is it today? Yesterday? Tomorrow? You know \r\nthe answer. \r\n Brothers, awaken. And Morazán is watchful.” \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Honduras for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. José Manuel Zelaya Rosales, President of the \r\nRepublic of Honduras, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Tassos Papadopoulos, President of \r\nthe Republic of Cyprus \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nCyprus. \r\n Mr. Tassos Papadopoulos, President of the \r\nRepublic of Cyprus, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Tassos Papadopoulos, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Cyprus, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly. \r\n President Papadopoulos: Before proceeding \r\nwith my remarks, I wish to indicate that Cyprus, as a \r\nmember of the European Union, is represented by the \r\nUnion and fully subscribes to the statement delivered \r\nthis morning by the President of Finland on behalf of \r\nthe European Union. I should also like to express my \r\nsincere congratulations to Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa \r\non her election as President of this session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, and my gratitude to Mr. Jan \r\nEliasson, President during the sixtieth session, for his \r\ntireless efforts during a historic year for the United \r\nNations. I also wish to thank the Secretary-General for \r\nhis comprehensive report on the work of the \r\nOrganization (A/61/1), highlighting the problems, the \r\nconcerns and the achievements of the United Nations \r\nand providing guidance on the way forward. I would \r\nlike moreover to warmly welcome the Republic of \r\nMontenegro as the 192nd Member of the United \r\nNations. \r\n During the session that followed the 2005 World \r\nSummit, implementation of the Summit Outcome \r\nDocument (resolution 60/1), and the reform process \r\nmore generally, absorbed an important part of the work \r\nof the Organization. The establishment of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, alongside other important achievements, \r\nconstitutes an important building block towards a \r\nconsolidated international system based on effective \r\nmultilateralism. We should, however, not lose sight of \r\nthe fact that the legitimacy and the relevance of the \r\nreform achieved will be judged by its impact on the \r\nlives of our peoples. In that respect, let me underline \r\nthat as a country whose priority lies with upholding the \r\nintegrity of international law and full respect for \r\nhuman rights, we have a strong interest in seeing a \r\nHuman Rights Council that fulfils its mandate and \r\nleads to human rights improvements on the ground. \r\n There are also aspects of reform that continue to \r\nelude us, such as Security Council reform and a \r\ncomprehensive convention against terrorism; aspects \r\nthat remain in progress, such as management reform, \r\nmandate review and system-wide coherence; and \r\nchallenges that are increasingly more difficult to \r\ntackle, such as disarmament and non-proliferation. \r\nA/61/PV.11  \r\n \r\n06-52737 18 \r\n \r\n In that regard, I would like to commend the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly for choosing the \r\nachievement of the development goals as the theme of \r\nher presidency in recognition of their enduring \r\nimportance. My Government believes that concerted, \r\ninnovative multilateral action to eradicate the scourges \r\nderiving from poverty and underdevelopment can yield \r\nsubstantial results. In that connection, Cyprus has \r\njoined France, Brazil, Chile, Norway, the United \r\nKingdom and other countries in deciding to introduce a \r\nspecial levy on air tickets, the proceeds of which will \r\nfund improved access to medication in developing \r\ncountries. \r\n Regrettably, the urgent need to achieve a \r\ncomprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East \r\nmanifested itself in a very dramatic manner once again \r\nthis summer. For almost four weeks, the international \r\ncommunity witnessed a violent crisis in Lebanon that \r\ncaused indescribable suffering, devastation and a \r\ndeplorably high number of casualties among civilians. \r\nWe offer our sympathy and concern to the \r\nGovernments of Lebanon and Israel and to the families \r\nof all those affected. \r\n Firmly convinced that there is no military \r\nsolution to such crises, Cyprus, from the very first \r\nmoment of the outbreak of violence, supported the \r\ncalls for an immediate ceasefire and joined in the effort \r\nto provide assistance both to the Lebanese people and \r\nto the evacuees. Unfortunately, it took almost a month \r\nfor the Security Council to discharge its \r\nresponsibilities effectively towards the peoples of the \r\nregion, causing disappointment and frustration. In our \r\nsearch for United Nations-centred, effective \r\nmultilateralism, the lessons learned from that crisis \r\nshould be a strong guiding force. We hope that the \r\nexpanded United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, to \r\nwhose deployment, operations and support Cyprus has \r\nundertaken to contribute, will be effective in \r\npreventing future eruptions of violence. \r\n In parallel to the Lebanese crisis, the world \r\ncontinues to witness the deterioration of the situation \r\nin the occupied Palestinian territories, with a heavy \r\ncivilian toll and worsening humanitarian conditions. A \r\nyear after the positive prospects created by Israeli \r\ndisengagement from Gaza, the current crises serve as a \r\nreminder of the urgent need for a new strategy that \r\nwould lead to a comprehensive and lasting settlement \r\nof all facets of the Middle East question on the basis of \r\nrelevant United Nations resolutions. In that respect, it \r\nis imperative to urgently revert to the implementation \r\nof international agreements, including the road map, \r\nproviding for the creation of a viable Palestinian State \r\nthat will peacefully coexist side by side with Israel \r\nwithin agreed borders. \r\n Let me now turn to the Cyprus problem — a \r\nproblem of the invasion and continuing occupation by \r\nTurkish military forces of 37 per cent of the territory of \r\nmy country for more than 32 years now. Mistaken by \r\nsome for a protracted conflict, the Cyprus problem \r\nessentially epitomizes the inability of the international \r\ncommunity to redress this set of massive violations of \r\ninternational legality. The status quo remains \r\nunchanged and the humanitarian and human rights \r\nconsequences of the forcible division of the island and \r\nits people persist. The efforts to establish a separate \r\npolitical and legal entity within the occupied area of \r\nCyprus by the occupying Power remain undiminished. \r\nOnly with respect to investigating the fate of persons \r\nmissing since the invasion and establishing the \r\ncircumstances of their disappearance have we recently \r\nwitnessed some encouraging developments. \r\n In the political field, we have continued to exert \r\nefforts on two key axes, coming closer to a negotiating \r\nprocess that would guarantee a peaceful settlement, \r\nalleviate the consequences of the invasion and bring \r\nabout the reunification of Cyprus, its territory, people, \r\nsociety, economy and institutions in a bizonal, \r\nbicommunal federation. \r\n The political agenda of projecting a separate \r\npolitical entity in Cyprus has been pursued in recent \r\nyears under the pretext of a campaign to lift the so-\r\ncalled isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community. \r\nHowever, with the annual per capita income in the \r\noccupied areas of Cyprus currently standing at \r\napproximately $11,000, it is evident that the argument \r\nfor economic development is being exploited for \r\npolitical reasons and is a manifestly unsubstantiated \r\nallegation. A recent example of that pattern of \r\nbehaviour is the refusal of the Turkish side to consider \r\nour proposal to increase trading activity by reopening \r\nthe port of Famagusta for exports to other States \r\nmembers of the European Union, in cooperation with \r\nthe European Commission, following the return of the \r\nnow fenced-off and derelict city of Famagusta to its \r\nlawful inhabitants under the control of the Cyprus \r\nGovernment. \r\n A/61/PV.11\r\n \r\n19 06-52737 \r\n \r\n The Greek Cypriots remain committed to \r\nreunification through a functional bizonal, bicommunal \r\nfederation. The failure of the most recent initiative did \r\nnot alter our commitment or our willingness to work \r\nresolutely towards the reunification of our country. The \r\nproposed plan was not accepted precisely because it \r\ndid not provide for the reunification of our divided \r\ncountry or address core issues and key concerns in a \r\nsatisfactory manner. The search for a settlement firmly \r\nremains for us in the United Nations framework, within \r\nthe context of the good offices mission mandated to the \r\nSecretary-General by the Security Council. \r\n I would now like to turn briefly to developments \r\nof a political nature that have taken place over the past \r\nfew months and to our attempts during that time to \r\ncreate the right conditions for the resumption of \r\nmeaningful negotiations in the framework of the good \r\noffices mission of the Secretary-General for a viable \r\nsettlement of the Cyprus problem. To that end, I wish \r\nto emphasize our concurrence with the opinion of the \r\nSecretary-General that good and careful preparation of \r\nany negotiating process is necessary before full-\r\nfledged negotiations can take place. It was thus agreed \r\nthat bicommunal discussions at the technical level \r\nwould commence to address substantive aspects of the \r\nCyprus problem, as well as issues that affect the \r\neveryday life of all Cypriots as long as the status quo \r\npersists — a process that could be complemented by \r\nparallel confidence-building. This expert-level process \r\nis a sine qua non for the preparation of issues and their \r\npresentation to the leaders of the two communities for \r\nthe purpose of meaningful negotiation. The method of \r\ninitiating these technical discussions was agreed to by \r\nthe two communities during the recent visit to Cyprus \r\nof Under-Secretary-General Gambari. Here, I wish to \r\nexpress my sincere gratitude and appreciation for the \r\ngood offices of Mr. Gambari, as well as for the \r\ncontinuing efforts of the Secretary-General’s Special \r\nRepresentative, Mr. Michael Møller. \r\n Addressing these core issues — which must be \r\nsettled satisfactorily if there is to be a feasible \r\nsolution — should facilitate the attainment of the \r\nbroader objectives of a settlement, which should be \r\nbased on international law, the relevant United Nations \r\nresolutions, the high-level agreements, the European \r\nUnion acquis and the relevant decisions of the \r\nEuropean Court of Human Rights. That entails \r\nestablishing a bicommunal and bizonal federal State of \r\nCyprus with a single sovereignty and international \r\npersonality and with a single citizenship. It must also \r\nguarantee the independence and territorial integrity of \r\nCyprus, without any foreign troops on its soil and \r\nwithout the possibility of foreign intervention. A \r\nsettlement must aim, through a rational approach and a \r\ncommon vision of the future, to preserve and uphold \r\nthe character of the State as a working democracy and \r\nto ensure the reunification of society and the \r\nconvergence of allegiances to common institutions. \r\nEthnic origin, political equality as defined in the \r\nrelevant United Nations resolutions, and cultural and \r\nreligious diversity should be safeguarded, but not at the \r\nexpense of the fundamental rights of citizens and the \r\nfunctionality and efficiency of State institutions. \r\n We had hoped that by now, Turkey’s course of \r\naccession to the European Union would have had a \r\ncatalytic effect, producing the necessary political will \r\non the part of Turkey and changing its perception of \r\nCyprus from that of an adversary to that of a partner, a \r\nvaluable neighbour and a potential ally in the European \r\nUnion. Such a change in attitude would render \r\ncompletely anachronistic those considerations that \r\nhave led the country to maintain its occupation army in \r\nCyprus and that fuel its confrontational approach. \r\n We continue to expect Turkey to at least proceed \r\nwith the implementation of its legally binding \r\nobligations vis-à-vis the European Union. This is a \r\nunique opportunity for Turkey to prove its willingness \r\nto turn the page by meeting obligations that it \r\nundertook years ago. Unfortunately, it has so far \r\npersistently refused to comply with them. Instead, our \r\ngenerous attitude towards Turkey’s accession to the \r\nEuropean Union has met with a blockade against my \r\ncountry in its bid to join several international and \r\nregional organizations and with Turkey’s refusal to \r\nopen its ports and airports to Cypriot vessels, as \r\nrequired. \r\n We still believe that in our relations with Turkey, \r\nthere is only one way forward: creating a future of \r\npeace and cooperation, building bridges and mutual \r\nunderstanding, normalizing our relations and working \r\nhand in hand to achieve the goals of the European \r\nUnion in our region. That would also enable us to \r\naddress all outstanding issues to the benefit of all — \r\nespecially the Turkish Cypriot community, which \r\nwould have major opportunities to thrive and flourish \r\nif Turkey were to accept and acknowledge that it has \r\nno vested interests in Cyprus and must therefore \r\nrelinquish all forms of interference in my country’s \r\nA/61/PV.11  \r\n \r\n06-52737 20 \r\n \r\naffairs. Once again, I invite Turkey to recognize that \r\nthere is no room for military doctrines with regard to \r\nCyprus and to join us in seeking a lasting solution for \r\nthe benefit of all Cypriots — Greek and Turkish \r\nCypriots alike — of Turkey and of our entire region. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Cyprus for the statement he has just made. \r\nMr. Tassos Papadopoulos, President of the \r\nRepublic of Cyprus, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Óscar Arias Sánchez, President of \r\nthe Republic of Costa Rica \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nCosta Rica. \r\nMr. Óscar Arias Sánchez, President of the \r\nRepublic of Costa Rica, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Óscar Arias Sánchez, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Costa Rica, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly. \r\n President Arias Sánchez (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the people of Costa Rica, I convey my \r\ngreetings to the President of the General Assembly and \r\nwish her every success. I also greet the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Kofi Annan, Nobel Peace laureate and tireless \r\ndefender of dialogue and understanding among the \r\npeoples of the Earth. \r\n I come before the Assembly overwhelmed by the \r\nsame emotion and the same sense of urgency as I felt \r\nwhen I did so for the first time, 20 years ago. Then, I \r\ncame burdened with the deepest distress of my people. \r\nI came to remind the world that, in the “waist of \r\nAmerica”, five small nations were engaged in a \r\nstruggle between life and death, between freedom and \r\noppression, between war and peace. I came to ask the \r\ninternational community not to let violence turn \r\nCentral America into a barren land where the seeds of \r\nthe most beautiful human dreams could not grow. \r\n The world has changed since then. The finest \r\nchildren of Central America no longer inherit war as \r\ntheir birthright, and our countries have ceased to be \r\npawns in the immense global chess game of the cold \r\nwar. \r\n For Central Americans, it is impossible to think \r\nthat the old days were better. I am convinced that \r\nhumanity has reasons to be optimistic and that, as \r\nWilliam Faulkner said, man will prevail. But I also \r\nknow that the progress made towards human freedom, \r\ndignity and well-being are no more than small victories \r\nin a long and epic battle. We have just set out on the \r\nroad towards the full realization of human beings, and \r\nit is strewn with obstacles. \r\n If we are to continue on the road towards human \r\nemancipation from misery, if we are to transform \r\ndevelopment and human rights into something more \r\nthan the utopian dream that they are today for hundreds \r\nof millions of people throughout the world, we will \r\nneed more than good intentions. We will need courage \r\nto call things what they are, to correct mistakes and to \r\nmake urgent decisions. \r\n With optimism and vehemence, I propose to the \r\nAssembly that we now take three courses of action that \r\ncould have powerful effects on the well-being of all \r\nhumanity. \r\n First, we must denounce increases in military \r\nspending, the arms race and the weapons trade as \r\noffences to the human condition. \r\n Secondly, we must make a reality, through free \r\ntrade, of the promise that the globalized economy holds \r\nfor humanity and in particular for the world’s poorest \r\npeoples. \r\n Thirdly, we must defend, with all our strength \r\nand eloquence, international law and the United \r\nNations, proposing reforms that will enable us \r\nsuccessfully to adapt to the tremendous changes that \r\nthe world is undergoing. \r\n For quite some time I have argued that the \r\nstruggle for human development is linked to the \r\nstruggle for disarmament and demilitarization. It is no \r\nbadge of honour for our species that global military \r\nspending exceeded $1 trillion in 2005 — the same \r\nlevel of spending, in real terms, as at the end of the \r\ncold war. That represents eight times the annual \r\ninvestment necessary to achieve, in the span of a \r\ndecade, all the Millennium Development Goals, in \r\nevery country. \r\n A/61/PV.11\r\n \r\n21 06-52737 \r\n \r\n The investment that the most industrialized \r\nnations make in their military — they are responsible \r\nfor 83 per cent of global military spending — is 10 \r\ntimes greater than the amount of resources that they \r\ndedicate to official development assistance. The United \r\nStates, the richest country on the planet, spends, at the \r\nvery least, 25 times more on the military than it gives \r\nin aid. Is this not a clear example of twisted priorities, \r\nnot to mention profoundly irrational? \r\n Indeed, at the end of the day, rationality is what \r\ncounts. Since the tragic events of 11 September 2001, \r\nglobal military spending has increased by a little more \r\nthan $200 billion. There is not a single indicator that \r\nsuggests that that colossal increase has made the world \r\nmore secure and human rights more widely enjoyed. \r\nOn the contrary, we feel increasingly vulnerable and \r\nfragile. \r\n Perhaps it is time to think of other ways to deploy \r\nthose resources. Perhaps it is time to realize that, with \r\na sum much smaller than that one, we could guarantee \r\naccess to potable water and primary education for \r\nevery person in the world. Perhaps there would be \r\nenough left over, as Gabriel García Marquez once \r\nsuggested, “to perfume Niagara Falls with sandalwood \r\non an autumn day”. Perhaps it is time to understand \r\nthat this is what would probably make us happier and \r\ncertainly more secure. \r\n Every weapon is a visible sign of the delay in \r\nmeeting the needs of the poor. I am not the only one to \r\nhave said so. The same thing was said, memorably, by \r\na man of arms, President Eisenhower, nearly half a \r\ncentury ago: \r\n“Every gun that is made, every warship launched, \r\nevery rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a \r\ntheft from those who hunger and are not fed, \r\nthose who are cold and are not clothed. This \r\nworld in arms is not spending money alone. It is \r\nspending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of \r\nits scientists, the hopes of its children.” \r\n While it is sad that the richest nations, through \r\nmilitary spending, are denying development \r\nopportunities to the poorest, it is sadder still that the \r\npoor are complicit in destroying their own future. \r\nIndeed, it is tragic that the Governments of some of the \r\nmost underdeveloped countries continue to supply their \r\ntroops with tanks, warplanes and missiles, supposedly \r\nto protect a population afflicted by hunger and \r\nignorance. \r\n My region of the world has not escaped that \r\nphenomenon. In 2005, the countries of Latin America \r\nspent almost $24 billion on weapons and troops — an \r\namount that has risen 25 per cent in real terms over the \r\nlast decade and increased substantially in the past year. \r\nLatin America has begun a new arms race, even though \r\nit has never been more democratic and there have been \r\nvery few military conflicts between countries in the \r\npast century. \r\n In that respect, I believe Costa Ricans have \r\nreason to be very proud. Since 1948, thanks to the \r\nvision of our former President, José Figueres, a very \r\nwise man, Costa Rica abolished its army and declared \r\npeace on the world, and we bettered our life. \r\n As I did 20 years ago in my first message to the \r\nGeneral Assembly, I can say today with satisfaction \r\nthat I come from a country without weapons, that our \r\nchildren have never seen a tank, an attack helicopter, a \r\nwarship or a cannon. As I did 20 years ago, I can say \r\nthat in my country, fathers and grandfathers explain to \r\nthe young people the curious architecture of some of \r\nour schools, which is due to the fact that, long ago, \r\nthose schools were military barracks. I can say that in \r\nmy homeland, none of our citizens, man or woman, \r\nknows oppression, and that not a single Costa Rican \r\nlives in exile. I can say today that mine is a nation of \r\nliberty. \r\n This is a path that neither my country nor I are \r\nwilling to abandon. Not only that: It is a path that we \r\nwish all humanity to follow. Today I would like to \r\npropose an idea. I propose that we all give life to the \r\nCosta Rican consensus, through which we create \r\nmechanisms to forgive debt and provide international \r\nfinancial support to developing nations that invest \r\nmore and more in education, health and housing, and \r\nless and less in soldiers and weapons. It is time that the \r\ninternational financial community reward not only \r\nthose whose spending is orderly, as it has done to date, \r\nbut also those whose spending is ethical. \r\n I propose to the Assembly as well that we \r\napprove, as soon as possible, an arms trade treaty \r\nprohibiting countries from transferring weapons to \r\nStates, groups or individuals if there is reason to \r\nbelieve that such arms will be used to violate human \r\nrights or international law, or if there are clear \r\nindications that they will be used to hinder the process \r\nof sustainable development. \r\nA/61/PV.11  \r\n \r\n06-52737 22 \r\n \r\n I hope that the United Nations, at this session of \r\nthe General Assembly, will approve the formation of a \r\ngovernmental group of experts that will draft the text \r\nof a binding treaty on the subject of international arms \r\ntransfers. \r\n It is time to close the door on the arms trade and \r\non the endless trail of death it leaves in its wake. It is \r\ntime also to open the door to other forms of \r\ncommerce — the legitimate and licit trade of goods \r\nand services — on which the prosperity of the peoples \r\nof the world depends. \r\n I know that in the Assembly there exists a wide \r\nrange of opinions about the best way to promote global \r\ntrade so as to provide genuine opportunities for all \r\ncountries. In a globalized world, the challenge facing \r\ndeveloping nations is simple: if we cannot export more \r\ngoods and services, we will end up exporting more \r\npeople. \r\n The strongest argument in favour of opening up \r\neconomies is, quite simply, that it helps to reduce \r\npoverty. I sometimes marvel that some continue to \r\ninsist that globalization is a negative force that is \r\nincreasing global poverty. On the contrary: according \r\nto the World Bank, the number of people living in \r\npoverty has fallen by almost 200 million over the past \r\ntwo decades, largely owing to the advances of India \r\nand China — two countries that have embraced \r\nglobalization and have opened up their markets with \r\nparticular enthusiasm. \r\n Trade liberalization can thus be defended on the \r\nbasis of the benefits that it brings for the poorest \r\npeople. If we truly want to meet the ethical challenge \r\nof reducing global poverty, wisdom and caution must \r\nprevail so that the Doha round can be successful. But I \r\nwant to stress that the defence of free trade must be \r\nhonest and consistent. We should seek commercial \r\nexchanges that are equally free for all countries. The \r\npractice among developed nations of pressing for the \r\nelimination of commercial barriers only in the sectors \r\nin which they have a clear comparative advantage is \r\nethically indefensible. Furthermore, developing \r\ncountries need and demand free trade in agriculture. \r\nUntil we make progress on this issue, we will have to \r\ncontinue paraphrasing George Orwell’s famous words, \r\nand say that in free trade everyone is equal, but some \r\nare more equal than others. \r\n Developing countries need development \r\nassistance and solidarity from industrialized countries, \r\nbut what we need from them above all is consistency. \r\nIf they extol the virtues of a free market, then let that \r\nmarket actually be free. If in their countries they \r\npromote admirable forms of social justice through the \r\nwelfare state, then let them put that principle into \r\npractice on an international scale. If their credo of \r\ndemocracy prevails within their borders, then let them \r\nsupport a more just balance of power within all \r\ninternational organizations. \r\n The third major challenge to which I want to refer \r\ntoday is the strengthening of global governance and the \r\nreform of its institutions. This task begins with the \r\ndefence of multilateralism and the strict adherence of \r\nall countries to international law and the fundamental \r\nprinciples of the Charter, the most elemental safeguard \r\nagainst anarchy in the world. Costa Rica, since it lacks \r\nan army, is perhaps the country most in need of an \r\neffective international system to guarantee its security. \r\n It is essential that the most powerful nations on \r\nEarth understand that the survival of international law \r\nand of the United Nations is fundamental for their own \r\nsecurity; that the mere existence of this forum is one of \r\nthe great achievements of our species; and that the \r\nUnited Nations represents the triumph of hope over \r\nfear, of tolerance over fanaticism and of reason over \r\nforce. \r\n As I stand here today, I would so much like to \r\nhear once more the powerful voice of John F. Kennedy, \r\ntelling the world, as he did in 1961, \r\n “To that world assembly of sovereign \r\nStates, the United Nations, our last best hope in \r\nan age where the instruments of war have far \r\noutpaced the instruments of peace, we renew our \r\npledge of support — to prevent it from becoming \r\nmerely a forum for invective, to strengthen its \r\nshield of the new and the weak, and to enlarge the \r\narea in which its writ may run.” \r\n This is the globalization that can transform the \r\nlives of all human beings for the better — a \r\nglobalization in which all countries are, as we are here, \r\nequal in rights; a globalization in which each people \r\ncan make its voice heard and hear the voices of others \r\nand in which the exercise of the tolerance that we \r\npractise every day in this Hall is the norm, not the \r\nexception. \r\n The great British writer Aldous Huxley once \r\nwondered whether this world was not another planet’s \r\n A/61/PV.11\r\n \r\n23 06-52737 \r\n \r\nhell. I do not think it is. It is just a marvellous and \r\ncomplex place, inhabited by a species that is barely in \r\nits infancy and that, like an infant, has scarcely begun \r\nto understand its immense power to create and to \r\ndestroy. \r\n For good or for ill, our species writes its history \r\nin draft form, never cleanly, always debating with \r\nitself — like each one of us — in a perpetual conflict \r\nbetween the good and bad angels of our nature. In this \r\nconflict, the victories of the human spirit, as certain as \r\nthey may seem, are always incomplete, gradual and \r\ntentative, and setbacks are always possible. The Earth \r\nis not hell. It is a place where there is no perfection — \r\nand never will be; just goodness and greatness \r\npunctuated by misfortunes, errors and suffering. \r\n The indisputable achievements of the past 20 \r\nyears tell us that, in spite of our sorrows, human beings \r\ncontinue the march of progress. But now is the time to \r\ncorrect costly mistakes, to right our course and to \r\nabandon the destructive behaviour that will make our \r\nmarch of progress infinitely more difficult and tortuous \r\nthan it should be. \r\n If today we do not confront the rise in military \r\nspending and the arms trade; if we do not encourage \r\nthe poorest countries to invest their scarce resources in \r\nlife and not in death; if we do not conquer the fear and \r\nhypocrisy that impede truly free trade throughout the \r\nworld; and if we do not strengthen the institutions and \r\nthe international norms that can protect us against \r\nglobal anarchy, we will be condemned to walk on the \r\nedge of a precipice and to engage in futile actions, \r\nhaving to start all over again, like Sisyphus, after every \r\nachievement. \r\n I believe that we must supplement optimism with \r\ncourage and the will to change. I believe that it is time \r\nfor humanity to build the brightest future that we could \r\npossibly dream of. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Costa Rica for the statement he has just made. \r\nMr. Óscar Arias Sánchez, President of the \r\nRepublic of Costa Rica, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mrs. Vaira Vike-Freiberga, President of \r\nthe Republic of Latvia \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nLatvia. \r\nMrs. Vaira Vike-Freiberga, President of the \r\nRepublic of Latvia, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations Her Excellency Mrs. Vaira Vike-Freiberga, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Latvia, and to invite her to \r\naddress the Assembly. \r\n President Vike-Freiberga (spoke in French): I \r\nwould like to begin by congratulating the Republic of \r\nMontenegro on its recent accession to the United \r\nNations Organization. We fully understand the \r\nchallenges that country faces and wish it every success \r\nin the establishment of a secure and prosperous State. \r\n I wish to express our highest appreciation to the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixtieth \r\nsession, Mr. Jan Eliasson, for his enthusiastic \r\ndedication and skilful leadership during the past year. \r\nWe now sincerely look forward to working with the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at this session, \r\nSheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, and I pledge her \r\nLatvia’s full support. I also congratulate her on being \r\nonly the third woman ever to preside over the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n A year ago, we marked the sixtieth anniversary of \r\nthe United Nations by setting out a far-reaching reform \r\nplan to bring the Organization closer to the needs of \r\nthe twenty-first century. While the United Nations \r\nspectrum of peacekeeping, humanitarian and human \r\nrights operations has increased significantly in recent \r\nyears, the United Nations must continue to step up its \r\nactivities if it is to meet the urgent needs of millions of \r\npeople throughout the world. \r\n The current situation presents us with great \r\nchallenges at the global level that require us to act with \r\nurgency and coordination. We will be able to attain the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and reduce the \r\ncrushing poverty that is debilitating the lives of billions \r\nof people across this planet only if we pool our \r\nresources and redouble our efforts. We need to pursue \r\nour campaign against well-known scourges that include \r\nA/61/PV.11  \r\n \r\n06-52737 24 \r\n \r\ncontagious disease and the destruction of the global \r\nenvironment. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n We can take satisfaction in noting that a number \r\nof serious and meaningful measures have already been \r\ntaken to alleviate the plight of the world’s poor. Those \r\nimportant steps must be followed up by continued \r\nmeasures to help the world’s poorest nations become \r\nmore self-sufficient. At the same time, the developing \r\ncountries must do their utmost to implement the \r\npractices of good governance, strengthen their \r\ninstitutions and abide by the rule of law. \r\n It is worth emphasizing that the United Nations \r\nhas been an effective instrument in those countries \r\nwhere the political will has existed to cooperate fully \r\nwith the United Nations programmes and proposals for \r\nalleviating the plight of the poor. At the same time, the \r\nefficiency of United Nations operations has also been \r\ncalled into question, and not without reason. More \r\ninnovative approaches need to be deployed for \r\nalleviating poverty and reaching set development \r\nobjectives. Among those, we should look more to the \r\neffective use of information, communication and \r\nmodern technologies. \r\n I well remember the excitement at the \r\nMillennium Summit in 2000, when we adopted the \r\nMillennium Declaration. Progress towards reaching the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, alas, is still \r\nunacceptably slow. The statistics on infant mortality \r\nand maternal health, among others, remain particularly \r\ndistressing. Millions of our fellow human beings have \r\nno access to clean drinking water, let alone more \r\nsophisticated comforts. We cannot remain indifferent \r\nwhen so much needs to be done. \r\n In many parts of the world, the misery brought on \r\nby poverty is compounded by such debilitating and \r\nmortal diseases as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and \r\nmalaria. While much has already been achieved to \r\ncontrol the spread of those afflictions, further \r\npartnerships need to be developed with other \r\nstakeholders, including those in the private sector. \r\n Only a few days ago, the States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations concluded a High-level Dialogue on \r\nInternational Migration and Development. The \r\ndramatic increase of illegal migration in recent years \r\nhas placed great stress on the international system for \r\nprotecting refugees and asylum-seekers. The activities \r\nof the Office of the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Refugees on migration issues should \r\nbe coordinated with regional cooperation efforts in \r\norder to become more effective. \r\n We have had the great misfortune to see terrorism \r\ncontinue as a threat to international peace and security. \r\nI welcome, therefore, the recent agreement on a Global \r\nCounter-Terrorism Strategy and urge the United \r\nNations Member States to intensify their efforts to \r\nreach a consensus on a comprehensive anti-terrorism \r\nconvention. \r\n We have failed to make any substantial progress \r\nover the past year in the area of disarmament and the \r\nnon-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. That \r\nis a fundamental issue for global peace and security \r\nand I encourage all United Nations Member States to \r\ndemonstrate their willingness to move forward at a \r\nfaster pace. \r\n The United Nations also needs to provide a \r\nprompt and effective response when armed conflicts \r\narise. We must strive to make United Nations \r\npeacekeeping a more effective and accepted instrument \r\nof collective security. Too often in the past, the United \r\nNations has been unable to prevent genocide and \r\nlasting bloodshed — in the Congo, in Rwanda, in the \r\nformer Yugoslavia and now in the Darfur region of the \r\nSudan. During the past 10 years, the operational \r\nactivity of the United Nations in peacekeeping has \r\nquadrupled, but that may still not be enough. The \r\ndemand for rapid action cannot be met through United \r\nNations mechanisms alone, but requires a more \r\neffective partnership between the United Nations and \r\nregional organizations. \r\n The most recent example of the need for a \r\nconcerted peacekeeping effort is the tragic sequence of \r\nevents in Israel and Lebanon this past summer. \r\nPeacekeeping can facilitate solutions, but not impose \r\nthem. In Iraq and in Afghanistan, as well as in the \r\ncontinuing conflict between the Israelis and the \r\nPalestinians, there will be no durable peace until all \r\nparties renounce the use of violence to achieve political \r\naims. A long-lasting settlement requires the political \r\nwill of all parties in the region to negotiate a viable \r\ncompromise in good faith, where a secure State of \r\nIsrael coexists side by side with an independent State \r\nof Palestine. \r\n Currently, the United Nations is uniquely \r\npositioned to take a leading role in peacebuilding. We \r\n A/61/PV.11\r\n \r\n25 06-52737 \r\n \r\nexpect the recently established Peacebuilding \r\nCommission to help those countries that are emerging \r\nfrom conflict not to be drawn back into it, and hope \r\nthat the Commission will serve to promote the post-\r\nconflict reconstruction and long-term development of \r\nregions that have suffered from warfare. \r\n Along with the promotion of peace and security \r\nand the alleviation of poverty, the protection of human \r\nrights is one of the main missions of the United \r\nNations. The recent creation of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil will hopefully enable the United Nations to \r\nrespond more promptly and effectively in situations \r\nwhere human rights come under threat. The Council \r\nneeds to provide real leadership to restore trust in the \r\nUnited Nations as a guardian, defender and promoter \r\nof that universal value. \r\n However, the effectiveness of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil depends entirely on the political will and \r\nconduct of the Member States. We must work together \r\nto ensure that this new institution, in which we have \r\nplaced such high hopes, truly serves the purpose for \r\nwhich it was created. \r\n During this session, we will face the difficult task \r\nof furthering the reform of the United Nations. We \r\nhave to accept the fact that none of the United Nations \r\nMember States will be able to attain absolutely \r\neverything they desire from the reform process. At no \r\npoint should any Members think of negotiations for \r\nthese necessary reforms as a zero-sum game in which \r\nsome will be losers and some winners. It is possible to \r\narrive at solutions that constitute a win-win situation \r\nfor everybody. It takes hard work and a lot of patience, \r\nbut it can be done. \r\n It is natural for different countries to have \r\ndifferent priorities and different threat perceptions. \r\nThat is a fact of life. It is precisely for that reason that \r\nwe need the United Nations as a central meeting place \r\nwhere our common interests can be determined and our \r\ncommon plans hammered out in an inclusive and \r\ndemocratic manner. The ongoing reforms of the United \r\nNations are needed for the benefit and advantage of us \r\nall, without exception. \r\n The international agreements that are reached \r\nwithin the United Nations bear a unique legitimacy, \r\nmoral weight and political authority. Yet it is no secret \r\nthat in an Organization with nearly 200 Members, the \r\ndecision-making process can be protracted. \r\nNevertheless, despite the painstakingly slow pace of \r\nUnited Nations reform to date, there has been some \r\nnotable progress during the past year. It is vital for the \r\nUnited Nations to continue striving for more trust and \r\ngoodwill among all our nations, for we simply cannot \r\nafford to do otherwise. \r\n There is general agreement that the time has \r\ncome for a serious overhaul of the United Nations \r\nmanagement system. An effective Secretariat is crucial \r\nfor the United Nations system’s ability to adapt to \r\nevolving challenges. So far, only the initial steps have \r\nbeen taken in transforming the United Nations into a \r\nmore efficient and accountable Organization. The time \r\nhas come for meaningful changes, and I hope that we \r\nwill establish tangible results during this sixty-first \r\nsession. \r\n Mandate review is another essential element of \r\nthe reform process where our aspirations have been \r\nhigher than the result achieved. Only a fraction of the \r\nnumerous mandates have been classified and the \r\nquestion of what to do with them is still pending. We \r\nneed to move ahead energetically, bearing in mind that \r\nthis is not a blind cost-cutting exercise but an ongoing \r\nprocess of feedback needed to improve the \r\neffectiveness and quality of the Organization’s work. \r\nRational use of resources and cost-efficiency will allow \r\nus to do more with the resources at the command of the \r\nUnited Nations, without any duplication of effort. \r\n There has been a growing feeling among United \r\nNations Member States of the need for a revitalized \r\nand more effective General Assembly. I welcome the \r\nregular meetings among the Presidents of the General \r\nAssembly, the Security Council and the Economic and \r\nSocial Council with the aim of achieving maximum \r\ncomplementarity among those principal organs. The \r\nCharter of the United Nations provides us with the \r\nfundamental guidelines for our work, and we should be \r\nguided by it in a spirit of cooperation, not rivalry. It is \r\nself-defeating, unproductive and wasteful to invest \r\ntime and effort in a competition among the main bodies \r\nof the United Nations. Only by rising above such \r\ninternal divisions can the United Nations hope to truly \r\nfulfil the leading role that it has to play in order to \r\nserve the needs of the world community as a whole. \r\n We must also not neglect the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council, which needs to be more \r\nrepresentative of the state of the world in 2006. While \r\nthis matter should not overshadow the rest of the \r\nreform process, neither can it be indefinitely \r\nA/61/PV.11  \r\n \r\n06-52737 26 \r\n \r\npostponed. Progress on this issue needs to be made, for \r\nit would invigorate and give added impetus to the \r\noverall reform process. The Security Council has a \r\ncentral role to play in maintaining international peace \r\nand security. If it is to function as a truly effective \r\norgan, then it must attain both a stronger capacity and a \r\ngreater willingness to act in the face of international \r\ncrises and tensions and it must find ways of responding \r\nmore rapidly at the outbreak of armed conflicts. \r\n At this sixty-first session of the General \r\nAssembly, we must make every effort to make progress \r\nin adjusting the United Nations to the needs and \r\nchallenges of our times. This session will be the last \r\nunder the stewardship of Secretary-General Kofi \r\nAnnan. During his mandate, Mr. Annan has exhibited \r\noutstanding leadership in setting the agenda and \r\nestablishing a clear vision of the goals of the United \r\nNations. I therefore take this opportunity to thank him \r\nfor his tireless dedication to the United Nations and for \r\nframing and initiating the much-needed reform \r\nprocess. His successor will inherit a vast and complex \r\nagenda which can only be tackled with maximum \r\ncooperation and flexibility from all Member States. \r\n The United Nations requires a Secretary-General \r\nwho will be willing to listen to and to respect the views \r\nof all, but who will also have the personal courage to \r\npush for the necessary, but possibly unpopular, \r\ndecisions that are needed for the good of the \r\nOrganization as a whole. A Secretary-General must be \r\nendowed with leadership, vision, fairness and \r\nobjectivity. He or she must be a true citizen of the \r\nworld who can feel the pulse of humanity. He or she \r\nmust have the passion and commitment to spare no \r\neffort in facing up to the most demanding of \r\nchallenges. \r\n Today, the United Nations is at a crossroads and \r\nfaces a choice: to address the challenges of the twenty-\r\nfirst century through the combined efforts of all its \r\nMember States, or to gradually lose its influence in the \r\ninternational community. \r\n As many here are aware, I recently announced my \r\ndecision to submit my candidacy for the position of \r\nSecretary-General. I highly appreciate the confidence \r\nplaced in me by the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi \r\nAnnan, when he appointed me Special Envoy on \r\nUnited Nations Reform. I am personally committed to \r\naddressing the challenges posed by United Nations \r\nreform and to promoting human rights, freedom and \r\ndemocracy, including gender equality. While women \r\nrepresent half of the world’s population, no woman has \r\never been at the helm of this Organization. I believe \r\nthat the time has come for a woman to be considered a \r\nserious candidate for the position of Secretary-General. \r\n It so happens that, as a result of historical events \r\nin the twentieth century, no Secretary-General has ever \r\ncome from Eastern Europe. Yet that region has a \r\nwealth of experience to share about its ability to effect \r\nradical change and achieve progress in a remarkably \r\nbrief period of time. \r\n Nevertheless, the principle of regional rotation \r\nshould not be the principal or sole factor in the \r\nselection of a candidate. While I deeply respect the \r\ncandidates who have already been nominated from one \r\npart of the world, the selection procedure should not \r\nrestrict the rights and opportunities of potential \r\ncandidates from any other part of the world. I hope that \r\nthe choice made by the Security Council and the \r\nGeneral Assembly will be based solely on the \r\ncandidate’s qualifications, personal qualities and \r\nvision. \r\n The world needs a strong United Nations, and we \r\nas leaders need to build bridges of understanding if we \r\nare to make the United Nations as strong as it needs to \r\nbe. We need to keep alive the main goal of the founders \r\nof the United Nations, who were determined “to save \r\nsucceeding generations from the scourge of war”. We \r\nowe it to our children, who will inherit this planet, to \r\nsave them also from the scourges of terrorism, of \r\nhunger and of disease. \r\n Because of my own personal experience as a \r\nchild of war and a refugee, having known fear, cold, \r\nloss and hunger in my time, I urge world leaders to \r\nsave every child that we can from such experiences. \r\nOur common goal is to extend worldwide the peace, \r\nfreedom and prosperity that so many nations have \r\nalready achieved. It can be done; it must be done. But \r\nit is something that we can achieve only by all of us \r\nworking together. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Latvia for the statement she has just made. \r\n Mrs. Vaira Vike-Freiberga, President of the \r\nRepublic of Latvia, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\n A/61/PV.11\r\n \r\n27 06-52737 \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Elías Antonio Saca González, \r\nPresident of the Republic of El Salvador \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nEl Salvador. \r\n Mr. Elías Antonio Saca González, President of the \r\nRepublic of El Salvador, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Elías Antonio Saca \r\nGonzález, President of the Republic of El Salvador, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Saca González (spoke in Spanish): We \r\nwish to congratulate Ms. Al-Khalifa for her election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \r\nsession, with the certainty that her distinguished \r\npersonal and professional qualities will ensure the \r\noptimum performance of the work on the agenda. This \r\nalso represents recognition of the necessary \r\nparticipation of women in the reforms of the United \r\nNations. I also wish to extend our special recognition \r\nto the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his \r\nresolute efforts and dedication to international peace \r\nand security, stability, human rights and development, \r\nin addition to his appreciable contribution to the reform \r\nof the Organization. \r\n The international community currently has \r\nchallenges that require our immediate attention. At the \r\npresent time, there are more than sixteen armed-\r\nconflicts in the world where the United Nations \r\nparticipates in peacekeeping operations. El Salvador is \r\npresent at some of these operations, concretely \r\ndemonstrating our belief in an international system of \r\nlaw, and in an international organization capable of \r\nresolving such conflicts that seriously threaten our \r\nstability. \r\n The situation of instability has an indescribable \r\nimpact in terms of the loss of human life, the \r\ndestruction of infrastructure, refugees, displaced \r\npersons and the shortage of resources needed for life. \r\nThis impacts the affected regions, as well as the \r\npolitical, economic and humanitarian condition of the \r\nentire international community. \r\n I have come to this rostrum to speak out in favour \r\nof peace and security in the Middle East, as well as \r\ndialogue and understanding, so that we can find timely \r\nand sustainable political and diplomatic solutions that \r\nsupport our belief in the right of the Israeli and \r\nPalestinian peoples to live in peace within secure and \r\ninternationally recognized borders. \r\n We welcome adoption of resolution 1697 (2006) \r\non 31 July and resolution 1701 (2006) on 11 August by \r\nthe Security Council and call for compliance with \r\nthose resolutions as they make possible a cessation of \r\nhostilities. This should represent the beginning of a \r\nnew phase in finding a negotiated political solution to \r\nthe conflict in Lebanon and in the Middle East. \r\n We are fully convinced that one of the keys to \r\nprogress towards peace in the Middle East is the \r\ndisarmament of all armed groups operating outside the \r\nlaw and Government control in the region, as well as \r\nthe exercise by Governments of full sovereignty over \r\ntheir territories. Here, we believe that it is essential for \r\nthe United Nations, in particular the Security Council, \r\nto continue to play a proactive and decisive role in \r\nfinding a lasting, comprehensive and sustainable \r\nsolution in the Middle East and to redirect the peace \r\nprocess. \r\n After a careful analysis of the international \r\nsituation, and of the Middle East in particular, my \r\nGovernment made the decision to move its ambassador \r\nfrom Jerusalem to Tel Aviv. We hope that this will \r\nmake a contribution to promoting the peace process in \r\nthe region and serve as an expression of our \r\ncommitment and respect for compliance with United \r\nNations resolutions. \r\n We do hope that this decision, in addition to \r\nmaking a concrete contribution to peace in the Middle \r\nEast, will also help to strengthen friendship and \r\nunderstanding between my country and Israel. We also \r\nwish to express our feelings of solidarity and \r\nfriendship to the Palestinian people. They can rely on \r\nEl Salvador to continue to seek peace, security and \r\nwell-being for the Palestinian people. \r\n Terrorism is a real and merciless threat against \r\nhumanity. Accordingly, I wish to reaffirm our vigorous \r\ncondemnation of all acts of terrorism in all their forms \r\nand manifestations, wherever or by whomever they are \r\ncommitted, irrespective of the objective sought. \r\n Today, more than ever, it is essential to strengthen \r\nand expand international cooperation to combat this \r\nscourge, within the framework of the rule of law, \r\nhuman rights and international humanitarian law. The \r\nA/61/PV.11  \r\n \r\n06-52737 28 \r\n \r\nUnited Nations has a historic opportunity to combat \r\ninternational terrorism through the recently adopted \r\nGlobal Strategy against Terrorism. The threat of \r\nterrorism is a daily reality, but the opportunity to deal \r\nwith it is in our hands. Let us do what we need to do to \r\nimplement this strategy and strengthen international \r\ncooperation in combating terrorism. \r\n El Salvador supports and participates actively in \r\nattaining these objectives. We continue to promote \r\nsuch action at the national level and hope that our \r\nlegislative assembly will adopt a law against terrorism \r\nin the next few days. \r\n Given the situation of the world as described, we \r\nwould like to take this opportunity to add our voices to \r\nthe call of the international community regarding the \r\ncelebration of the International Day of Peace, set by \r\nthe General Assembly on 21 September each year. The \r\nAssembly issued a firm appeal that during that Day all \r\nparties in conflict, wherever they might be, cease their \r\nfighting and observe a global ceasefire, leading to \r\nreflection about the adverse effects of war and the \r\nbenefits of peace. \r\n One of the most serious threats to peace, social \r\nstability, the security of citizens and economic \r\ndevelopment is the problem of organized crime. \r\nEl Salvador, together with other countries in Central \r\nAmerica, has been particularly affected by this problem \r\nin recent years. The expansion of the criminal activities \r\nof bands and gangs that act not only within countries, \r\nbut also beyond borders. They have become criminal \r\norganizations that not only commit individual and \r\ngroup murder, but also engage in extortion and terrorist \r\nacts related to transnational crime. They have \r\nfurthermore become involved in the trafficking of arms \r\nand drugs, human trafficking and money-laundering. \r\n El Salvador is aware of the dimensions of the \r\nproblem and its impact on society. For this reason, we \r\nare one of the main countries promoting a \r\ncomprehensive approach. Not only do we directly \r\ncombat these groups, but we also use preventive \r\nmethods, namely, rehabilitation and social \r\nreintegration. We are convinced that this task cannot be \r\ndealt with individually. What is needed is collective \r\naction and international coordination and cooperation. \r\n In this connection, we believe that this \r\nOrganization should consider the adoption of measures \r\nand mechanisms consistent with the instruments and \r\nprotocols that deal with organized crime, so that we \r\ncan achieve a broad international consensus aimed at \r\ncoping more effectively with this evil that, \r\nincreasingly, is threatening society in general. \r\nMoreover, we should develop policies and cooperation \r\nto this end. I would mention, in particular, programmes \r\nfor young people in high-risk situations or who are at \r\nodds with the law in our countries. \r\n Speaking of the reform of the United Nations \r\nmeans talking about the suitability and relevance of an \r\ninternational organization could respond adequately to \r\nthe opportunities and challenges of today’s world. \r\n We believe that it is particularly important to \r\nbreak this stalemate in negotiations and settle as soon \r\nas possible the question of expanding the membership \r\nof the Security Council, both permanent and non-\r\npermanent members, so that it can be more \r\nrepresentative with respect to the current number of \r\nStates that are Members of this Organization. For my \r\nGovernment, this is a subject that is extremely \r\nimportant. Therefore, it is essential to make this \r\nimportant body more representative, to give it greater \r\ntransparency, to make it more democratic and \r\nlegitimate, particularly in the decision-making process \r\nfor important decisions. \r\n Also, recognition should be given to some of the \r\nreforms adopted, and we welcome the beginning of \r\nwork of the new Human Rights Council and the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, of which El Salvador is \r\nhonoured and appreciative of being a part. Here, I wish \r\nto reaffirm the commitment of the Government of \r\nEl Salvador to respect and protect human rights, while \r\nwe make available to the Peacebuilding Commission \r\nthe experience gained by El Salvador in its successful \r\npeace process. This would initially apply to some \r\ncountries, such as Burundi and Sierra Leone, that are \r\nnow being considered with regard to which the \r\nCommission will be able to provide advice to the \r\nSecurity Council. \r\n In the life of nations there are always special \r\nquestions that determine direction and destiny as they \r\nmove towards their future. The question of the \r\nRepublic of China in Taiwan is one of those questions. \r\nEven though it is a political reality that has evolved in \r\nparallel with other States and embodies all of the \r\ncharacteristics needed to be a State, there is still failure \r\nto recognize its existence. This denies the right of 23 \r\nmillion people of Taiwan to be represented in \r\ninternational organizations and, in particular, the \r\n A/61/PV.11\r\n \r\n29 06-52737 \r\n \r\nUnited Nations. We firmly believe that the situation of \r\nTaiwan should be examined pragmatically in the light \r\nof the current political reality. The United Nations is \r\nthe proper forum to do so — not only because it should \r\nrecognize the right of the Taiwanese people to be \r\nrepresented, but also because a globalized world \r\nshould not allow exclusion or marginalization from \r\ninternational cooperation. Such cooperation \r\nstrengthens efforts to combat challenges and problems \r\nthat are common to all and could undermine the quality \r\nof life and obstruct the development of peoples. Here, \r\nwe reiterate the need to open up room for the \r\nrepresentation and participation of Taiwan in the \r\nUnited Nations, particularly in the specialized \r\nagencies, which by their nature are related to \r\nhumanitarian, economic and social questions. \r\n The President returned to the Chair. \r\n A subject of special interest for El Salvador is the \r\nstrengthening of international cooperation for \r\ndevelopment, particularly with a view to complying \r\nwith the Millennium Development Goals. In this \r\nconnection, we believe that, in order to implement and \r\nfollow up on our development plans, we must have the \r\nsupport of the international community so as to create \r\nfairer and more open conditions that would enable us \r\nto accede to technological resources, the transfer of \r\ntechnology, environmentally friendly technology, the \r\nsupport for the generation of technical capabilities and \r\nnew financial resources in favourable conditions. \r\nEl Salvador is firmly committed to attaining the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, as envisaged in our \r\nGovernment plan, and accordingly, we have made \r\nefforts and directed resources, primarily through \r\nnational impact programmes, together with \r\ninternational cooperation, with special focus on \r\neducation and health. \r\n Even though we agree that every country must \r\nassume fundamental responsibility for its own \r\ndevelopment, the developed States should contribute to \r\ncreating the opportunities needed to enable the \r\nrelatively less developed countries to reduce the \r\npolitical and economic impact of the social deficit, \r\nthrough the implementation of measures that will \r\nenable us to enjoy the benefits of free trade, economic \r\nglobalization and international cooperation and \r\nincrease our technical capacity and productivity. This \r\nmust include the commitment to give 0.7 per cent of \r\ngross domestic product as official aid to development. \r\nWe recognize and express our appreciation to the \r\ncountries that have already done so. \r\n In this perspective, we have warmly welcomed \r\nthe adoption of the General Assembly resolution on the \r\nfollow-up to the results of the 2005 World Summit on \r\ndevelopment. It is of great importance if we are fully to \r\ncomply with the Millennium Development Goals that \r\nwe have set ourselves. We firmly believe that low-\r\nincome countries and middle-income countries should \r\nnot be excluded from international cooperation and \r\ntechnical and financial assistance, whether bilateral or \r\nmultilateral, particularly those countries that have \r\nmaintained good responsible management of resources \r\nobtained through international cooperation and public \r\nfinance. However, despite the progress achieved in \r\nimproving the quality of life of our peoples, there are \r\nstill groups of populations that suffer from extreme \r\npoverty and require cooperation and international \r\nassistance to supplement the efforts we are making to \r\nattain those objectives. \r\n This could not be otherwise, given the fact that \r\nmiddle- and low-income countries continue to face \r\nchallenges in the development process. Therefore, we \r\nwould like to make a resounding appeal to the \r\ndeveloped countries, the middle-income countries and \r\nthe multilateral financial agencies to become real \r\npartners and strategic allies, so that we can overcome \r\nour problems and help us to promote the agenda for \r\ndevelopment and progress for our peoples. \r\n In this respect, I am pleased to announce that \r\nEl Salvador is planning to hold a forum next year of \r\nlow-income countries where we hope to unify criteria \r\nand positions on this subject, in addition to considering \r\nthe strengthening of cooperation and technical, \r\nscientific and financial assistance among participating \r\ncountries. On this occasion, we cordially invite middle- \r\nand low-income countries, together with donor \r\ncountries and development agencies, to participate in \r\nthis meeting. We hope that their participation and \r\ncontributions will enrich our analysis and will benefit \r\nthe middle- and low-income countries, which are \r\nfrequently excluded from development funds. \r\n My Government attaches great priority to the \r\nAgenda for Development, particularly to expand \r\ncoverage of basic services and generate opportunities \r\nfor productivity in those areas and communities where, \r\nbecause of their poverty indicators and their growth \r\nA/61/PV.11  \r\n \r\n06-52737 30 \r\n \r\npotential, we have felt that they deserve strategic \r\nattention. \r\n My country has been recognized for having \r\nadopted a series of measures to strengthen democratic \r\ninstitutions, economic freedoms and social investment. \r\nThis has gained us the confidence of the international \r\ncommunity, which we believe is indispensable for \r\nestablishing an environment conducive to mobilizing \r\nalternative sources of funding that can make possible \r\nsocial programmes aimed at reducing poverty. \r\n From the beginning of our term in office, we have \r\ndone much to seek innovative forms of cooperation, \r\nsuch as those offered by various millennium funds. We \r\nhave applied for Millennium Challenge Account \r\nfinancing for a country programme based on national \r\ndialogue and with the participation of our citizens. It \r\nwill be an integrated, comprehensive strategy directly \r\nbenefiting more than 850,000 inhabitants of 92 \r\nmunicipalities in northern El Salvador, thus \r\ncontributing reducing poverty in that region. \r\n No less important and closely complementary, we \r\nbelieve that international cooperation based on \r\nsolidarity encompasses the swapping of debt for social \r\nprogrammes. We welcome the proposals and decisions \r\nof some developed countries, which are supporting \r\nsuch mechanisms, especially in health and education, \r\nthereby encouraging countries that have honoured their \r\nforeign debt obligations. There is no doubt that these \r\nactivities strengthen democracy and freedom. \r\n We feel that despite the decline in oil prices, \r\ncontinued high prices are not only detrimental to the \r\nefforts of developing countries to improve and \r\nstrengthen our economies, because they make exports \r\nand imports more expensive, reduce income and create \r\ninflation. They also have a negative impact on chain of \r\nproduction, and on basic necessities and services, \r\nopening the way to the possibility of a worldwide \r\nrecession, which clearly would have political and \r\nsocial repercussions. We feel that oil should not be \r\nused as a tool to achieve goals of any kind, but rather \r\nas a means to strengthen the global economy in \r\ngeneral. It is important to define rules for creating a \r\nmore stable oil market and at the same time to enhance \r\nour efforts to find alternative sources of energy that are \r\naccessible and environmentally friendly. \r\n For El Salvador, migration is one of the priorities \r\non our domestic and international agenda. We have \r\ndecided to create, for the first time in the history of \r\nEl Salvador, the post of Vice-Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs for Salvadorans Living Abroad, a high-level \r\nGovernment position within the Foreign Ministry, \r\nwhose main function is to serve emigrants through a \r\ncomprehensive, multidimensional policy. The vice-\r\nministry is operating successfully. Salvadorans living \r\nabroad are on the presidential agenda. Last week, the \r\nAssembly held a High-level Dialogue on International \r\nMigration and Development. El Salvador participated \r\nproactively and chaired one of the round tables. I am \r\nthankful for the confidence placed in us. \r\n Allow me to reaffirm what was expressed by the \r\nForeign Minister of El Salvador at the High-level \r\nDialogue. We stress the importance of this issue and \r\nthe need to continue discussions from a broad-based \r\nand positive perspective, which gives us a \r\ncomprehensive view and a higher level of \r\nunderstanding of the issue of migration as an \r\ninternational social fact. Migration gives rise to a \r\ndynamic and complex process involving various \r\naspects including flows of individuals, capital, goods \r\nand services. It involves rights and obligations, \r\norganization, assistance, cooperation, legal and \r\nlegislative processes, analysis, studies and research on \r\nthis issue, and subsequent oversight by the United \r\nNations system, as a complement to domestic, \r\nsubregional and continental efforts. \r\n I welcome the outcome of the Dialogue and \r\nexpress the hope that the United Nations will give the \r\nissue of migration human, just and balanced \r\nconsideration. \r\n On 16 January 2007, we will celebrate the \r\nfifteenth anniversary of the signing of the peace \r\naccords for El Salvador. Fifteen years ago, Salvadorans \r\nwere fully convinced that we were worthy of a better \r\nfuture and deserved a rebuilt, democratic country, a \r\ncountry of reconciliation and freedom for us and for \r\nour children. We can now be proud of our endeavours \r\nto genuinely fulfil the commitments made at \r\nChapultepec, whose spirit should prevail as we \r\ncontinue to strengthen democratic institutions in my \r\ncountry. \r\n I would like to pay public tribute to the entire \r\npeople of El Salvador for their dedication to the cause \r\nof peace and national reconciliation. I would also like \r\nto acknowledge the men and women who signed the \r\npeace accords, whose historic action was the basis for \r\nour present and future as a nation. Likewise, I would \r\n A/61/PV.11\r\n \r\n31 06-52737 \r\n \r\nlike to pay a special tribute to the United Nations for \r\nits work and for its effective mediation, which led to \r\nthe completion in 2003 of its work to monitor the \r\npeace accords, and to the countries of the Group of \r\nFriends of El Salvador for their important support for \r\nthe successful completion of the peace process. \r\n Today, the United Nations — an Organization \r\ncreated to promote and realize universal principles and \r\nideals that are still valid in our contemporary world, \r\nespecially the ideal of promoting progress for the \r\nmillions of persons throughout the world who struggle \r\ndaily to secure their basic rights, dignity and \r\nimportance as human beings — has a choice: either to \r\nossify and become anachronic, or to modernize and \r\nbecome an Organization that can deal more efficiently \r\nand effectively with the challenges of the twenty-first \r\ncentury in a complex, globalized and interdependent \r\nworld. \r\n It is clear that we all wish for a modern and \r\nviable Organization to meet the challenges together, \r\nbut Member States will decide whether the \r\nOrganization changes to fulfil its mandate, especially \r\nto maintain international peace and security and \r\npromote respect for human rights and economic and \r\nsocial development. \r\n Thus, it will depend on us whether the present \r\nand the future of the today’s world will be based on \r\ndiplomacy or will be condemned to use force to resolve \r\ndifferences in international relations. This is the serious \r\ndilemma that we must resolve. The task is complex \r\nbecause of its size and ramifications, due in turn to its \r\ndiversity in the face of the phenomena of power and \r\nthe exercise of power. We hold the hope that reason \r\nand conscience will prevail over force and \r\ndomination — for the benefit of all humanity. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of El Salvador \r\nfor the statement he has just made. \r\nMr. Elias Antonio Saca González, President of the \r\nRepublic of El Salvador, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Runaldo Ronald Venetiaan, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Suriname \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Suriname. \r\nMr. Runaldo Ronald Venetiaan, President of the \r\nRepublic of Suriname, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Runaldo Ronald Venetiaan, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Suriname, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly. \r\n President Venetiaan: On behalf of the \r\nGovernment and the people of the Republic of \r\nSuriname, I should like to take this opportunity to \r\nextend to you, Madam, and to the Government and the \r\npeople of the Kingdom of Bahrain, my sincere \r\ncongratulations on your election to preside over the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-first session. \r\n We express our gratitude to His Excellency \r\nMr. Jan Eliasson, President of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixtieth session, for his contribution to the work of \r\nthe Organization. I should also like to pledge our \r\nsupport to the Secretary-General, His Excellency \r\nMr. Kofi Annan, and to pay tribute to him for his \r\nleadership, his valuable contribution to the resolution \r\nof global challenges and his constructive role in \r\nrestructuring the United Nations. \r\n In today’s world, guaranteeing necessary \r\ninfrastructure and ensuring the availability of health \r\nservices and education for all are still major \r\nchallenges. The world order continues to deny the vast \r\nmajority of the members of the international \r\ncommunity the opportunity to escape poverty and to \r\nutilize their abilities and skills to achieve progress and \r\nprosperity. There is a need for enhanced cooperation in \r\nareas of relevance to humanity if we are to create an \r\ninternational community that can offer all of its \r\nmembers a fair chance of a decent life. \r\n The call for an enabling international \r\nenvironment for sustainable development and poverty \r\neradication is still a strong one. The international \r\ncommunity needs to support the call of the vast \r\nmajority of its members for fair terms of trade, \r\nincreased market access for products from the \r\ndeveloping countries and a more effective and \r\nsupportive international financial architecture. \r\n Given the international state of affairs, Suriname \r\nsupports the implementation of the international global \r\npartnership for development. The partnership for \r\ndevelopment can obtain guidance for its decisions from \r\nA/61/PV.11  \r\n \r\n06-52737 32 \r\n \r\nthe many commitments adopted at the major United \r\nNations conferences and summits in the economic, \r\nsocial and related fields, in particular those reflected in \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals and the Monterey \r\nConsensus. This partnership should aim to energize the \r\npolitical will of all States to implement those \r\ncommitments and to create genuine opportunities for \r\nall States in the field of trade, as well as for \r\ninvestments that promote sustainable development and \r\npoverty eradication. \r\n My delegation continues to plead for a rule-\r\nbased, predictable, non-discriminatory trading and \r\nfinancial system, and for an international system that \r\npromotes decent and productive work and extends the \r\nbenefits of new technology to all parts of the globe. \r\n The focus of the partnership for development \r\nmust be the establishment of a supportive international \r\nenvironment to achieve, in particular Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goal 8 and its targets. \r\n Building a global partnership for development \r\nwill require the involvement and cooperation of all \r\nstakeholders — Governments, the private sector and \r\ncivil society alike. The partnership should enhance the \r\ninvolvement of the private sector, taking into account \r\nthe redefinition of the role of the private sector in \r\nsociety, based on a common understanding of the \r\ninfluence of business in spurring development and \r\nimproving the human condition. \r\n The contribution of the private sector is pivotal to \r\na national policy geared towards enhancing human \r\ncapital and infrastructure and gaining access to world \r\nmarkets. We note with satisfaction the leadership of the \r\nUnited Nations in this area, and believe that the United \r\nNations Global Compact should collaborate with the \r\npartnership for development. Civil society should \r\ncontribute actively to the partnership for development \r\nat all levels, in particular at the national level. Its \r\nactivities should be in harmony with and \r\ncomplementary to national development efforts. \r\n The challenges we face in the area of \r\ninternational peace and security are equally serious. \r\nThe increased efforts of the United Nations to save \r\nhumanity from the scourge of warfare are not always \r\nsuccessful. Too often the international community is \r\nconfronted with situations that seriously jeopardize the \r\nsafety of individuals and populations. \r\n The Government of Suriname believes that there \r\nis a need for us to realize that the United Nations is in \r\nfact still our partnership for international peace and \r\nsecurity. This partnership should be based on the firm \r\ndetermination of all States to cooperate in seeking fair \r\nand lasting solutions to persistent problems that \r\nadversely affect international peace and security. \r\nTolerance, mutual respect and mutual interest, leading \r\nto the peaceful coexistence of States, good-\r\nneighbourliness and unity in diversity, should be the \r\nbasic principles that guide the recommendations of the \r\npartnership for international peace and security. \r\n Recently, the General Assembly adopted the \r\nUnited Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy \r\n(resolution 60/288). This is certainly a step forward \r\ntowards an effective international response to \r\nterrorism, in conformity with international law, \r\ninternational human rights law and international \r\nhumanitarian law. My delegation notes with \r\nsatisfaction that the Strategy includes the promotion of \r\ndialogue, tolerance and understanding among \r\ncivilizations. Of equal importance is the recognition \r\nthat capacity-building in all States is a core element of \r\nthe global counter-terrorism effort. In this regard, we \r\nanticipate a genuine partnership being established to \r\nimplement the Strategy. \r\n The illegal drugs trade and organized crime also \r\naffect international security. Increased cooperation at \r\nall levels is needed if the international community is to \r\nbe able to respond adequately to those threats. In this \r\nconnection, the Government of Suriname will host an \r\nanti-narcotics conference in October 2006. The main \r\npurpose of the conference is to enhance coordination \r\nand collaboration among participating countries, aimed \r\nat combating trafficking in narcotic drugs, dismantling \r\ndrug-related criminal organizations and combating the \r\nillicit trade in small arms and light weapons, given the \r\nincreased levels of crime that it generates. \r\n A restructured United Nations must ensure that \r\nthe Organization remains the source of redress for the \r\ninternational community and the home of international \r\njustice and equitable decision-making. Given the less-\r\nthan-satisfactory international development and \r\nsecurity situation, we, the States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations, should be more than willing to act in \r\nconformity with the Charter, to employ the \r\ninternational machinery for promoting the economic \r\nand social advancement of all peoples, to unite our \r\nstrengths to maintain international peace and security, \r\n A/61/PV.11\r\n \r\n33 06-52737 \r\n \r\nand to practise increased tolerance and live together in \r\npeace as good neighbours. Suriname believes that the \r\npresent session of the General Assembly can contribute \r\nsignificantly to those endeavours. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Suriname for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Runaldo Ronald Venetiaan, President of the \r\nRepublic of Suriname, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Evo Morales Ayma, President of the \r\nConstitutional Republic of Bolivia \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Constitutional Republic \r\nof Bolivia. \r\n Mr. Evo Morales Ayma, President of the \r\nConstitutional Republic of Bolivia, was escorted \r\ninto the General Assembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Evo Morales Ayma, \r\nPresident of the Constitutional Republic of Bolivia, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Morales Ayma (spoke in Spanish): It \r\nis a source of great satisfaction to be here to represent \r\nmy people, my homeland, Bolivia, and especially the \r\nindigenous movement. After more than 500 years of \r\ncontempt and hatred for peoples once considered \r\nsavages and animals — peoples who in some regions \r\nwere condemned to extermination — we have come to \r\nright a historical wrong, to right the wrongs of 500 \r\nyears, thanks to today’s awareness and the uprising and \r\nstruggle for the rights of peoples. \r\n During the period of the Republic, when we were \r\nalso discriminated against and marginalized, the \r\nstruggle of peoples for life and humanity was never \r\ntaken into account. Over the past 20 years, through the \r\napplication of an economic model, neo-liberalism, the \r\nplundering of our natural resources and the \r\nprivatization of basic services continued. We are \r\nconvinced that privatizing basic services is the best \r\nway to violate human rights. \r\n Those minor considerations require us — and \r\nrequire me personally — to speak the truth here about \r\nthe lives of families. I come to express this feeling for \r\nthe humanity of peoples, of my people; I come to \r\nexpress the suffering caused by marginalization and \r\nexclusion; and, above all, I come to express the anti-\r\ncolonial thoughts of peoples who are fighting for \r\nequality and justice. \r\n In my country, we are beginning to seek profound \r\ndemocratic and peaceful change. We are in the process \r\nof identifying ways to recreate Bolivia in order to unite \r\nBolivians; to recreate Bolivia in order to bring all the \r\nsectors and regions of my country closer together; to \r\nrecreate Bolivia, but not to take revenge against \r\nanyone, although we have been subjected to \r\ndiscrimination; and, in particular, to recreate Bolivia to \r\nput an end to this contempt, this hatred for peoples. I \r\nsay this because my mother told me that when she \r\nwould go to the city, she did not have the right to walk \r\nin the main squares of my country’s cities; as recently \r\nas 30 or 40 years ago, she did not have the right to \r\nwalk on the pavement. \r\n Fortunately, however, we have decided to move \r\nbeyond that social, labour and communal struggle to a \r\nnew electoral struggle so that we ourselves can resolve \r\nsocial, economic and structural problems. We are \r\ncasting our lot with the reform-minded Constituent \r\nAssembly. I would like the United Nations to \r\nparticipate in this process of peaceful and democratic \r\nchange, which is the best thing that we could do for our \r\nabandoned and marginalized families. \r\n Surely, many other countries have the same \r\nproblems as my country, a nation with so much wealth \r\nbut also so much poverty. Historically, our natural \r\nresources were stolen, plundered, sold off and \r\ndelivered to transnational corporations by neo-liberal \r\nGovernments. The time has come for those in the \r\nvanguard of the struggle of peoples for power and \r\nterritory to recover those natural resources for the \r\nBolivian State so that they can be under the people’s \r\ncontrol. \r\n When we talk about recovering our natural \r\nresources, they tell us, in this dirty campaign of \r\naccusations, that the Government of Evo Morales is not \r\ngoing to respect private property. I want to tell them \r\nthat my Government will respect private property. It is \r\ntrue that we need investment; we need partners — not \r\nbosses, not owners of our natural resources. We \r\nunderstand perfectly well that an underdeveloped \r\ncountry needs investment. \r\nA/61/PV.11  \r\n \r\n06-52737 34 \r\n \r\n I would like to clear up for everyone a number of \r\nconcerns and false accusations. If the Bolivian State \r\nexercises its property rights over natural resources such \r\nas natural gas, hydrocarbons and petroleum, we will \r\nnot expel anyone or confiscate anything. Investors will \r\nbe respected; indeed, they will be guaranteed a return \r\non their investment and the right to make a profit. But \r\nthey will not make fat profits as they did before, and \r\nthen fail to resolve my country’s social problems. \r\n I have not come to tell anyone how to govern. I \r\nhave not come to threaten a country or to start to set \r\nconditions for a country. I wish only to ask that, as \r\ninternational organizations, as States with a spirit of \r\nsolidarity, as nations with principles of reciprocity and \r\nbrotherhood, all players participate in the process of \r\nmoving towards democracy. We are very concerned \r\nthat there be an awareness, in international forums such \r\nas the United Nations, of the need to work to bring \r\nabout peaceful change. \r\n All are aware, in North America in particular as \r\nwell as in Europe, that many Bolivians are leaving \r\ntheir country to find work. It used to be Europeans who \r\ninvaded Latin America, and especially Bolivia. Now, \r\nhowever, it seems that the situation has changed. It is \r\nthe Latin Americans and the Bolivians who are \r\ninvading Europe, as they did previously the United \r\nStates. Why? Because, at the present time, there are no \r\njobs. What is needed is fair trade, trade by peoples for \r\npeoples, trade that resolves employment problems. \r\n Of course, trade by corporations is important, but \r\ntrade by small producers is even more important. For \r\nthe benefit of these cooperatives, these associations \r\nand these collectives, their products — not my brothers \r\nand sisters — are the ones that should go to Europe. \r\nThat is what we wish to see. Greater awareness on the \r\npart of the international community is required if we \r\nwish to resolve the problem of migration. \r\n Our brothers and sisters will not go take over \r\nthousands of hectares, as others did when they came to \r\nLatin America. They came to take our wealth and our \r\nresources. It is important to note that, even in my \r\ncountry, this so-called free trade is affecting major \r\nagribusiness concerns. As a consequence of the free \r\ntrade agreement that Colombia signed with the United \r\nStates, soy farmers, Bolivians, and even Colombian \r\nagribusiness concerns have lost market share. I am \r\nconvinced that it is important to import what we do not \r\nproduce and export what we do produce. That would \r\nresolve economic problems and the problem of \r\nunemployment. \r\n I should like to take this opportunity to speak of \r\nanother historical injustice: the criminalization of the \r\ncoca leaf. This coca leaf is green, not white, like \r\ncocaine. The coca leaf is symbolic of Andean culture, \r\nof the Andean environment and of the hopes of \r\npeoples. It is not acceptable that the coca leaf be legal \r\nfor Coca-Cola and illegal for medicinal consumption \r\nnot only in our country but throughout the world. \r\n The United Nations should be aware that \r\nscientific studies have been carried out in American \r\nand European universities that have shown that the \r\ncoca leaf has no negative effects on human health. I am \r\nvery sorry that because some have a drug habit, the \r\ncoca leaf has become illegal. We are aware of that. \r\nThat is why, as coca leaf producers, we have stated that \r\nthere will not be unfettered coca leaf production, but \r\nneither will there be zero production. Conditionality-\r\nbased policies implemented in the past focused on zero \r\ncoca-leaf production. But zero coca-leaf production is \r\nequivalent to zero Quechuas, zero Aymarás, zero \r\nMojeños, zero Chiquitanos. All of that ended with \r\nanother Government. We are an underdeveloped \r\ncountry with economic problems resulting from the \r\npillage of our natural resources. We are here today to \r\nbegin to regain our dignity and the dignity of our \r\ncountry. \r\n In that context, I wish to say that the best \r\ncontribution to combating drug trafficking has been \r\nthrough an agreed, voluntary reduction, with no deaths \r\nor injuries. I was pleased to hear that the United \r\nNations report recognizes the honest and responsible \r\neffort that has been made to combat drug trafficking. \r\nDrug seizures have increased 300 per cent. However, \r\nyesterday I heard the United States Government state \r\nthat it would not accept coca cultivation and that it was \r\nimposing conditions on us so that we would change our \r\nsystem. \r\n I want to say, with all due respect for the United \r\nStates Government, that we are not going to change \r\nanything. We do not need blackmail or threats. The so-\r\ncalled certifications or de-certifications used in the \r\ncombat against drug trafficking are simply an \r\ninstrument for the recolonization or colonization of \r\nAndean countries. We will not accept or allow this. \r\n We want, and need, an alliance to combat drug \r\ntrafficking, but it must be genuine and effective. The \r\n A/61/PV.11\r\n \r\n35 06-52737 \r\n \r\nwar on drugs cannot be an instrument or a pretext to \r\nsubjugate the Andean countries, just as the idea of \r\npreventive war was invented to intervene in certain \r\ncountries of the Middle East. We must wage an \r\neffective battle against drug trafficking. I call on the \r\nUnited Nations and invite the Government of the \r\nUnited States to reach an agreement and to forge an \r\neffective alliance to combat drug trafficking. The war \r\non drugs should not be used as an excuse or a pretext \r\nto dominate or humiliate us, or to try to establish \r\nmilitary bases in our country under the pretext of \r\ncombating the drug trade. \r\n I should like also to take this opportunity, in the \r\ncontext of this process of change, to say that we want \r\njustice. That is important to our peoples. I believe that, \r\nthrough the Constituent Assembly, justice will be \r\ndecolonized and nationalized. That will be true justice. \r\nAs long as some violate others’ human rights, as long \r\nas peoples are threatened by military intervention, \r\nthere will never be justice. \r\n We are committed, as Presidents and heads of \r\nState, to safeguarding the dignity of humanity by \r\nputting an end to the impunity promoted by my \r\ncountry’s previous Governments and to the massacres \r\nof people demanding their economic rights and \r\nclaiming their natural resources. It is not acceptable \r\nthat the perpetrators of genocide and the most corrupt \r\ncriminals can escape and move to the United States. \r\nWith all due respect, I ask the United States, as a \r\ndeveloped country, to expel those corrupt, genocidal \r\ncriminals who are living there. If they have nothing to \r\nhide, why are they not defending themselves before the \r\nBolivian judiciary? \r\n I am obligated, as President, to ensure that they \r\nare tried by the Bolivian justice system. I do not \r\nbelieve that any country or any head of State can \r\nprotect criminals or those who are guilty of genocide. I \r\nhope that, with the support of the American people, \r\nthrough international organizations, those responsible \r\nfor so much economic damage and so many violations \r\nof human rights will be brought to justice, or there will \r\nnever be respect for human rights. \r\n I have been entrusted by the Permanent Forum on \r\nIndigenous Issues to say the following. Previously, \r\ndebates on the rights of indigenous peoples were held \r\nin the United Nations Sub-commission dealing with \r\nthat issue, in Geneva, and in the framework of the \r\nOrganization of American States (OAS). But I have \r\nbeen informed that the debate has now moved to this \r\nhighest of bodies, the United Nations itself. \r\n I call on the Assembly, on behalf of the \r\nindigenous peoples of the world, and particularly those \r\nof Abiallal — now known as America — urgently to \r\nadopt the declaration on the rights of the indigenous \r\npeoples of the world: the right to self-determination, \r\nthe right to live in communities, and the right to live a \r\nlife based on solidarity and reciprocity, and, above all, \r\non brotherhood. \r\n There are regions and communities where there is \r\nno private property, only community property. We \r\nindigenous peoples want, quite simply, to live well, not \r\nbetter. Living better means exploiting, pillaging, \r\nrobbing, whereas living well is living peacefully in \r\nbrotherhood. That is why it is extremely important for \r\nthe United Nations, after the Decade of the Indigenous \r\nPeoples, to adopt as a matter of urgency the \r\nDeclaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, \r\nincluding the right to natural resources and the right to \r\ncare for the environment. \r\n We indigenous peoples, particularly the poor, are \r\nof the culture of life, not the culture of war. This \r\nmillennium must really be about defending life and \r\nsaving humanity. If we want to save humanity, we must \r\nsave the planet Earth. We indigenous peoples live in \r\nharmony with Mother Earth, not only in reciprocity \r\nand solidarity with human beings. We are very sorry \r\nthat hegemonistic policies and rivalries are destroying \r\nthe planet Earth. I feel that it is important for all \r\ncountries, societies and international organizations to \r\nbegin to debate this subject truly, in order to save the \r\nplanet Earth, to save humanity. \r\n This new millennium in which we are living must \r\nbe a millennium of life, not war, a millennium of the \r\npeople, not of empire, a millennium of justice and \r\nequality; and all economic policies must be directed \r\ntowards ending or at least reducing the so-called \r\nasymmetries or differences between countries and \r\nsocial inequalities. There is no question now of \r\nimplementing policies that involve the economic \r\nhumiliation or pillaging of others, whether with rules \r\nor with troops. \r\n With all due respect, I wish to say that it is \r\nimportant for the troops to be withdrawn from Iraq, if \r\nwe want to respect human rights. It is important to \r\nabandon economic policies that allow capital to be \r\nconcentrated in just a few hands. I feel that these \r\nA/61/PV.11  \r\n \r\n06-52737 36 \r\n \r\nactions have to be of historic importance in order to \r\nchange the world and to change economic models and \r\ninterventionist policies. In particular, we want these to \r\nbe times which enable us to defend and save humanity. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the \r\nConstitutional Republic of Bolivia for the statement he \r\nhas just made. \r\n Mr. Evo Morales Ayma, President of the \r\nConstitutional Republic of Bolivia, was escorted \r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, President \r\nof the Islamic Republic of Iran \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran. \r\n Mr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, President of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, \r\nPresident of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly. \r\n President Ahmadinejad (spoke in Farsi; English \r\ntext provided by the delegation): I praise the merciful, \r\nall-knowing and almighty God for blessing me with \r\nanother opportunity to address this Assembly on behalf \r\nof the great nation of Iran and to bring a number of \r\nissues to the attention of the international community. I \r\nalso praise the Almighty for the increasing vigilance of \r\npeoples across the globe, their courageous presence in \r\ndifferent international settings, and the brave \r\nexpression of their views and aspirations regarding \r\nglobal issues. \r\n Today, humanity passionately craves commitment \r\nto the truth, devotion to God, the quest for justice and \r\nrespect for the dignity of human beings. Rejection of \r\ndomination and aggression, defence of the oppressed, \r\nand longing for peace constitute the legitimate demand \r\nof the peoples of the world, particularly the new \r\ngenerations and the spirited youth who aspire to a \r\nworld free from decadence, aggression and injustice, \r\nreplete with love and compassion. The youth have a \r\nright to seek justice and the truth. They have a right to \r\nbuild their own future on the foundations of love, \r\ncompassion and tranquillity. I praise the Almighty for \r\nthis immense blessing. \r\n What afflicts humanity today is certainly not \r\ncompatible with human dignity. The Almighty has not \r\ncreated human beings so that they could transgress \r\nagainst others and oppress them. By causing war and \r\nconflict, some are quickly expanding their domination, \r\naccumulating greater wealth and usurping all the \r\nresources, while others endure poverty, suffering and \r\nmisery as a result. \r\n Some seek to rule the world relying on weapons \r\nand threats, while others live in perpetual insecurity \r\nand danger. Some occupy the homeland of others, \r\nthousands of kilometres away from their borders, \r\ninterfere in their affairs and control their oil and other \r\nresources and strategic routes, while others are \r\nbombarded daily in their own homes, their children \r\nmurdered in the streets and alleys of their own country, \r\nand their homes reduced to rubble. \r\n Such behaviour is not worthy of human beings \r\nand runs counter to the truth, to justice and to human \r\ndignity. The fundamental question is this: under such \r\nconditions, where should the oppressed seek justice? \r\nWho, or what organization, defends the rights of the \r\noppressed and suppresses acts of aggression and \r\noppression? Where is the seat of global justice? \r\n A brief glance at a few examples of the most \r\npressing global issues further illustrates the problem. \r\nThe first is the unbridled expansion of nuclear, \r\nchemical and biological weapons. Some Powers have \r\nproudly announced the production of second- and \r\nthird-generation nuclear weapons. What do they need \r\nthose weapons for? Is the development and stockpiling \r\nof such deadly weapons designed to promote peace and \r\ndemocracy? Or, are the weapons actually instruments \r\nof coercion and threat directed against other peoples \r\nand Governments? \r\n How long should the people of the world have to \r\nlive with the nightmare of nuclear, biological and \r\nchemical weapons? What binds the Powers that \r\nproduce and possess those weapons? How can they be \r\nheld accountable by the international community? \r\nFurthermore, are the inhabitants of those countries \r\ncontent with wasting their wealth and resources on the \r\nproduction of such destructive arsenals? Is it not \r\npossible to rely on justice, ethics and wisdom instead \r\nof on such instruments of death? Are not wisdom and \r\njustice more compatible with peace and tranquillity \r\n A/61/PV.11\r\n \r\n37 06-52737 \r\n \r\nthan nuclear, chemical and biological weapons? If \r\nwisdom, ethics and justice prevail, then oppression and \r\naggression will be uprooted, threats will wither away \r\nand no reason will remain for conflict. \r\n This is a solid proposition, because most global \r\nconflicts result from injustice and from the fact that the \r\npowerful are not content with their own rights, but \r\nwant to deny the rights of others. \r\n People across the globe embrace justice and are \r\nwilling to make sacrifices for its sake. Would it not be \r\neasier for the global Powers to ensure their longevity \r\nand win hearts and minds through the championing and \r\nreal promotion of justice, compassion and peace, rather \r\nthan by continuing the proliferation of nuclear and \r\nchemical weapons and threatening their use? \r\n We have experienced the threat and the use of \r\nnuclear weapons. Has it achieved anything for the \r\nperpetrators other than the exacerbation of tension, \r\nhatred and animosity among nations? \r\n The second issue is the occupation of countries \r\nand the exacerbation of hostilities. The occupation of \r\nIraq has continued for the past three years. Not a day \r\ngoes by without hundreds of people being killed in \r\ncold blood. The occupiers are incapable of establishing \r\nsecurity in Iraq. Despite the establishment of a lawful \r\nGovernment and the National Assembly of Iraq, covert \r\nand overt efforts are being made to heighten insecurity, \r\nmagnify and aggravate differences within Iraqi society \r\nand instigate civil strife. \r\n There is no sign that the occupiers have the \r\nnecessary political will to eliminate the sources of \r\ninstability. Numerous terrorists were apprehended by \r\nthe Government of Iraq, only to be let loose under \r\nvarious pretexts by the occupiers. It seems that the \r\nintensification of hostilities and terrorism serves as a \r\npretext for the continued presence of foreign forces in \r\nIraq. \r\n Where can the people of Iraq seek refuge, and \r\nfrom whom should the Government of Iraq seek \r\njustice? Who can ensure Iraq’s security? Insecurity in \r\nIraq affects the entire region. Can the Security Council \r\nplay a role in restoring peace and security in Iraq when \r\nthe occupiers are themselves permanent members of \r\nthe Council? Is the Security Council capable of making \r\na fair decision in this regard? \r\n Let us consider the situation in Palestine. The \r\nroots of the Palestinian problem go back to the Second \r\nWorld War. Under the pretext of protecting some of the \r\nsurvivors of that war, the land of Palestine was \r\noccupied through war and aggression, resulting in the \r\ndisplacement of millions of its inhabitants. It was \r\nplaced under the control of some of the survivors of the \r\nwar, who brought even larger population groups from \r\nelsewhere in the world who had not even been affected \r\nby the Second World War. A Government was \r\nestablished in the territory of others with a population \r\ncollected from throughout the world at the cost of \r\ndriving millions of the rightful inhabitants of the land \r\ninto diaspora and homelessness. \r\n That is a great tragedy with hardly any precedent \r\nin history. Refugees continue to live in temporary \r\nrefugee camps, and many have died while still hoping \r\none day to return to their land. Can any logic, law or \r\nlegal reasoning justify this tragedy? Would any \r\nMember of the United Nations accept such a tragedy if \r\nit occurred in its own homeland? \r\n The pretexts for the creation of the regime \r\noccupying Al-Quds al-Sharif are so weak that its \r\nsupporters want to silence any voice that tries merely \r\nto speak about them, as they are concerned that \r\nshedding light on the facts would undermine the raison \r\nd’être of the regime — as, indeed, it has done. The \r\ntragedy did not end with the establishment of a regime \r\non the territory of others. Regrettably, from its \r\ninception, that regime has been a constant source of \r\nthreat and insecurity in the Middle East region — \r\nwaging war, spilling blood and impeding the progress \r\nof countries in the region. It has also been used by \r\nsome Powers as an instrument of division, coercion \r\nand pressure on the people of the region. \r\n Reference to those historical realities may cause \r\nsome disquiet among supporters of that regime. But \r\nthese are simple facts, not myths. History has unfolded \r\nbefore our eyes. Worse still is the unwarranted blanket \r\nsupport provided to the regime. We need only watch \r\nwhat is happening in the Palestinian land. People are \r\nbeing bombarded in their own homes and their children \r\nmurdered in their own streets and alleys. But no \r\nauthority, not even the Security Council, can afford \r\nthem any support or protection. Why? \r\n Meanwhile, a Government has been formed \r\ndemocratically and through the free choice of the \r\nelectorate in a part of the Palestinian territory. But \r\ninstead of receiving the support of the so-called \r\nchampions of democracy, its ministers and members of \r\nA/61/PV.11  \r\n \r\n06-52737 38 \r\n \r\nparliament have been illegally abducted and \r\nincarcerated in full view of the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n What council or international organization is \r\nstanding up to protect this brutally besieged \r\nGovernment? Why cannot the Security Council take \r\nany steps? \r\n I should like now to address the issue of \r\nLebanon. For 33 long days, the Lebanese lived under a \r\nbarrage of fire and bombs, and close to 1.5 million of \r\nthem were displaced. Meanwhile, some members of the \r\nSecurity Council practically chose a path that provided \r\nample opportunity for the aggressor to achieve its \r\nobjectives militarily. We saw the Security Council \r\npractically incapacitated by certain Powers so that it \r\ncould not even call for a ceasefire. The Security \r\nCouncil sat idly by for many days, witnessing cruel \r\nscenes of atrocities against the Lebanese, while \r\ntragedies such as the one that occurred at Qana were \r\npersistently repeated. Why? \r\n In all of these cases, the answer is self-evident. \r\nWhen the Power behind the hostilities is itself a \r\npermanent member of the Security Council, how can \r\nthe Council fulfil its responsibilities? \r\n The third issue is lack of respect for the rights of \r\nmembers of the international community. \r\n I now wish to speak about some of the grievances \r\nof the Iranian people and about the injustices against \r\nthem. \r\n The Islamic Republic of Iran is a member of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and is \r\ncommitted to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT). All our nuclear activities are \r\ntransparent and peaceful and are under the watchful \r\neyes of IAEA inspectors. Why then are there objections \r\nto our legally recognized rights? Which Governments \r\nobject to those rights? Governments that themselves \r\nbenefit from nuclear energy and the fuel cycle. Some \r\nof them have abused nuclear technology for non-\r\npeaceful ends, including the production of nuclear \r\nbombs, and some even have a bleak record of using \r\nthem against humanity. \r\n Which organization or council should address \r\nthose injustices? Is the Security Council in a position \r\nto address them? Can it stop violations of the \r\ninalienable rights of countries? Can it prevent certain \r\nPowers from impeding the scientific progress of other \r\ncountries? The abuse of the Security Council, as an \r\ninstrument of threat and coercion, is indeed a source of \r\ngrave concern. Some permanent members of the \r\nSecurity Council, even when they are themselves \r\nparties to international disputes, conveniently threaten \r\nothers with the Security Council and, even before any \r\ndecision by the Council, proclaim the Council’s \r\ncondemnation of their opponents. \r\n The question is: what can justify such \r\nexploitation of the Security Council, and do not such \r\nacts erode its credibility and effectiveness? Can such \r\nbehaviour strengthen the ability of the Council to \r\nmaintain security? \r\n A review of recent historical realities would lead \r\nto the regrettable conclusion that justice has become a \r\nvictim of force and aggression. Many global \r\narrangements have become unjust, discriminatory and \r\nirresponsible as a result of undue pressure from some \r\nof the powerful nations. Threats to use nuclear \r\nweapons and other instruments of war, by some powers \r\nhave taken the place of respect for the rights of nations \r\nand the maintenance and promotion of peace and \r\ntranquillity. \r\n For some Powers, claims of promoting human \r\nrights and democracy can last only as long as the \r\nclaims can be used as instruments of pressure and \r\nintimidation against other nations. But when it comes \r\nto the interests of the claimants, concepts such as \r\ndemocracy, the right of self-determination of nations, \r\nrespect for the rights and intelligence of peoples, and \r\ninternational law and justice have no place or value. \r\nThat is blatantly manifested in the way in which the \r\nelected Government of the Palestinian people is \r\ntreated, as well as in the support extended to the \r\nZionist regime. It does not matter if people are \r\nmurdered in Palestine, turned into refugees, captured, \r\nimprisoned or besieged; that, apparently, does not \r\nviolate human rights. \r\n Nations are not equal in exercising their rights as \r\nrecognized by international law. Enjoying those rights \r\nis dependent on the whim of certain major Powers. \r\nApparently, the Security Council can only be used to \r\nensure the security and the rights of some big Powers. \r\nBut when the oppressed are being bombarded and \r\ndecimated, the Security Council must remain aloof and \r\nnot even call for a ceasefire. Is this not a tragedy of \r\nhistoric proportions for the Security Council, which is \r\ncharged with maintaining the security of countries? \r\n A/61/PV.11\r\n \r\n39 06-52737 \r\n \r\n The prevailing order of contemporary global \r\ninteractions is such that certain Powers equate \r\nthemselves with the international community and \r\nconsider that their decisions supersede those of over \r\n180 other countries. They consider themselves to be \r\nthe masters and rulers of the entire world and give \r\nother nations a mere second-class ranking in the world \r\norder. \r\n The question needs to be asked: if the \r\nGovernments of the United States or the United \r\nKingdom, countries which are permanent members of \r\nthe Security Council, commit aggression, occupation \r\nand violation of international law, which of the United \r\nNations organs can call them to account? Can a \r\nCouncil in which they are privileged members address \r\ntheir violations? Has that ever happened? In fact, we \r\nhave repeatedly seen the reverse. If they have a \r\ndifference with a nation or State, they bring the matter \r\nto the Security Council as claimants, then \r\nsimultaneously arrogate to themselves the roles of \r\nprosecutor, judge and executioner. Is that a just order? \r\nCan there be a more vivid case of discrimination and \r\nmore clear evidence of injustice? \r\n Regrettably, the persistence of some hegemonic \r\nPowers in imposing their exclusionist policies on the \r\ninternational decision-making mechanisms, including \r\nthe Security Council, has resulted in a growing mistrust \r\non the part of world public opinion that is undermining \r\nthe credibility and effectiveness of the most universal \r\nsystem of collective security. How long can such a \r\nsituation last in the world? It is evident that the \r\nbehaviour of some Powers constitutes the greatest \r\nchallenge before the Security Council, the entire \r\nOrganization and its affiliated agencies. \r\n The present structure and working methods of the \r\nSecurity Council, which are legacies of the Second \r\nWorld War, are not responsive to the expectations of \r\nthe current generation and the contemporary needs of \r\nhumanity. Today, it is undeniable that the Security \r\nCouncil, most critically and urgently, requires \r\nlegitimacy and effectiveness. It must be acknowledged \r\nthat as long as the Council is unable to act on behalf of \r\nthe entire international community in a transparent, just \r\nand democratic manner, it will be neither legitimate \r\nnor effective. Furthermore, the direct relationship \r\nbetween abuse of the veto power and erosion of the \r\nlegitimacy and effectiveness of the Council has now \r\nbeen clearly and undeniably established. We cannot \r\nand should not expect the eradication, or even the \r\ncontainment, of injustice, imposition and oppression \r\nwithout reforming the structure and working methods \r\nof the Council. \r\n Is it appropriate to expect this generation to \r\nsubmit to decisions and arrangements established over \r\nhalf a century ago? Does not this generation or future \r\ngenerations have the right to make their own decisions \r\nabout the world in which they want to live? \r\n Today, genuine reform in the structure and \r\nworking methods of the Security Council is more \r\nnecessary than ever. Justice and democracy dictate that \r\nthe role of the General Assembly, as the highest organ \r\nof the United Nations, must be respected. The General \r\nAssembly can then, through appropriate mechanisms, \r\ntake on the task of reforming the Organization and, in \r\nparticular, rescue the Security Council from its current \r\nstate. In the interim, the Non-Aligned Movement, the \r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference and the African \r\ncontinent should each have permanent-member status \r\nin the Security Council, with veto privilege. The \r\nresulting balance would hopefully prevent further \r\ntrampling of the rights of nations. \r\n It is essential that spirituality and ethics find their \r\nrightful place in international relations. Without ethics \r\nand spirituality, attained in the light of the teachings of \r\nthe divine prophets, justice, freedom and human rights \r\ncannot be guaranteed. The resolution of contemporary \r\nhuman crises lies in observing ethics and spirituality \r\nand in the governance of righteous people of high \r\ncompetence and piety. Should respect for the rights of \r\nhuman beings become the predominant objective, then \r\ninjustice, ill temper, aggression and war will fade \r\naway. \r\n Human beings are all God’s creatures and are all \r\nendowed with dignity and respect. No one has \r\nsuperiority over others. No individual or State can \r\narrogate to themselves special privileges; nor can they \r\ndisregard the rights of others or position themselves, \r\nthrough influence and pressure, as the “international \r\ncommunity”. \r\n Citizens of Asia, Africa, Europe and America are \r\nall equal. Over six billion inhabitants of the Earth are \r\nall equal and worthy of respect. Justice and the \r\nprotection of human dignity are the two pillars in \r\nmaintaining sustainable peace, security and tranquillity \r\nin the world. \r\nA/61/PV.11  \r\n \r\n06-52737 40 \r\n \r\n It is for this reason that we state that sustainable \r\npeace and tranquillity in the world can only be attained \r\nthrough justice, spirituality, ethics, compassion and \r\nrespect for human dignity. All nations and States are \r\nentitled to peace, progress and security. We are all \r\nmembers of the international community, and we are \r\nall entitled to insist on the creation of a climate of \r\ncompassion, love and justice. \r\n All Members of the United Nations are affected \r\nby both the bitter and sweet events and developments \r\nin today’s world. We can adopt firm and logical \r\ndecisions, thereby improving the prospects for a better \r\nlife for current and future generations. Together, we \r\ncan eradicate the roots of bitter maladies and \r\nafflictions, and instead, through the promotion of \r\nuniversal and lasting values, such as ethics, spirituality \r\nand justice, allow our nations to taste the sweetness of \r\na better future. \r\n Peoples, driven by their divine nature, \r\nintrinsically seek good, virtue, perfection and beauty. \r\nRelying on our peoples, we can take giant steps \r\ntowards reform and pave the road to human perfection. \r\nWhether we like it or not, justice, peace and virtue will \r\nsooner or later prevail in the world with the will of \r\nAlmighty God. It is imperative, and also desirable, that \r\nwe, too, contribute to the promotion of justice and \r\nvirtue. \r\n The Almighty and Merciful God, who is the \r\nCreator of the Universe, is also its Lord and Ruler. \r\nJustice is His command. He commands His creatures to \r\nsupport one another in good, virtue and piety, and not \r\nin decadence or corruption. He commands His \r\ncreatures to enjoin one another to righteousness and \r\nvirtue and not to sin or transgression. All divine \r\nprophets, from the Prophet Adam (peace be upon him) \r\nto the Prophet Moses (peace be upon him), to the \r\nProphet Jesus Christ (peace be upon him), to the \r\nProphet Mohammad (peace be upon him), have all \r\ncalled humanity to monotheism, justice, brotherhood, \r\nlove and compassion. Is it not possible to build a better \r\nworld based on monotheism, justice, love and respect \r\nfor the rights of human beings, and thereby transform \r\nanimosities into friendship? \r\n I emphatically declare that today’s world, more \r\nthan ever before, longs for just and righteous people \r\nwith love for all humanity; and above all, it longs for \r\nthe perfect righteous human being and the real saviour \r\nwho has been promised to all peoples and who will \r\nestablish justice, peace and brotherhood on the planet. \r\n O, Almighty God, all men and women are Your \r\ncreatures, and You have ordained their guidance and \r\nsalvation. Bestow upon humanity that thirsts for justice \r\nthe perfect human being promised to all by You, and \r\nmake us among his followers and among those who \r\nstrive for his return and his cause. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran for the statement he has just made. \r\n President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, President of \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran, was escorted from \r\nthe General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Nicanor Duarte Frutos, President of \r\nthe Republic of Paraguay \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Paraguay. \r\n Mr. Nicanor Duarte Frutos, President of the \r\nRepublic of Paraguay, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Nicanor Duarte Frutos, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Paraguay, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly. \r\n President Duarte Frutos (spoke in Spanish): \r\nMadam President, may I tell you how happy Paraguay \r\nis to see you presiding over the sixty-first session of \r\nthe General Assembly. Your personal and professional \r\nqualities ensure the success of this session. \r\n I wish to reiterate what I said at the earlier \r\nsummit meeting. For Paraguay, peace and security, \r\ndevelopment with social justice, democracy and human \r\nrights are the fundamental pillars on which the world \r\nmust be based, because they are interconnected \r\nprinciples that mutually strengthen each other. We \r\ncannot consider ourselves to be in an airtight \r\ncompartment, because if pride of place is given to one \r\nover another, this Assembly will not be a pluralistic, \r\nrepresentative body. Rather, the single-voiced will of \r\nPowers will continue to be imposed on others. \r\n My delegation thanks the Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Kofi Annan, for his detailed annual report on the \r\nwork of the Organization (A/61/1). Ideally, the \r\n A/61/PV.11\r\n \r\n41 06-52737 \r\n \r\nSecretary-General would not travel only to those places \r\nwhere barbaric warfare is destroying cities and killing \r\ninnocent, defenceless people. Perhaps something would \r\nchange if he were also to go to see the vast universe of \r\npoverty and social exclusion resulting from worldwide, \r\nprofoundly unjust disorder, and then propose solutions. \r\nWe urgently need to build a global partnership of \r\nsolidarity to supplement the efforts made by our \r\ncountries. Only in this way will we be able to deal with \r\nthe problems of poverty, hunger and the lack of access \r\nto education and health care. Clearly, every country is \r\nresponsible for achieving its own economic and social \r\ndevelopment by applying the proper policies to \r\nmobilize domestic resources. But those national efforts \r\nshould be supplemented by explicit commitments by \r\nthe developed countries to promote and facilitate \r\naccess to international markets and more balance in \r\neconomic relations and in the price of products. \r\n The experience of developed countries \r\nthemselves shows that, without external cooperation, \r\nthey would have had difficulty in prospering or in \r\nrestructuring their economies. \r\n The reciprocal increase in production and trade is \r\na driving force for development. However, the trend \r\ntowards more concentrated productive expansion and \r\ninsufficient participation in the benefits of world trade \r\ncondemn the majority of countries to marginalization \r\nfrom development. For this reason, Paraguay calls once \r\nagain for the right of all nations to more even-handed, \r\nequitable treatment, including the right to build a new \r\nform of solidarity among States which are capable of \r\npromoting progress on a global scale. \r\n Agricultural subsidies, protectionism, the lack of \r\ntechnology transfers and the distortions in international \r\ntrade, together with ethnocentric control of \r\ninformation, knowledge and science, postpone \r\ndevelopment and punish countries on the periphery \r\nwith a pre-modern and wasted life. Because of those \r\nrecurrent circumstances, we are convinced that the \r\ntariffs and non-tariff barriers that are applied not only \r\nby developed countries but also by our own regional \r\npartners must be removed. Only in that way can we \r\nquickly overcome asymmetries and unjust \r\ndiscrimination. \r\n Society expects more of democracy and of \r\npoliticians. It expects the system that guarantees liberty \r\nand equality before the law also to be a system which \r\npromotes and ensures the well-being of all and puts an \r\nend to exclusion. Unfortunately, this basic conception \r\nof politics is not reflected in the behaviour of many \r\nactors. In practice, petty interests, selfishness and party \r\nfaction are considered more important and have greater \r\npriority than the interests of the nation. Democracy as \r\ngovernment in the service of the common good is being \r\nbastardized. That gives rise to the lack of prestige and \r\ndevaluation of politics and democracy, particularly in \r\nLatin America. \r\n This erratic direction that politics is taking must \r\nbe corrected in countries which do not have a \r\ndemocratic tradition: we have only just built low-\r\nquality democracy, a pseudo-democracy laced with \r\nconspiracies against good governance and the exercise \r\nof power based on legitimacy and the will of the \r\nmajority of the people. \r\n In any event, in Paraguay, we are making a great \r\neffort. School attendance is showing exponential \r\ngrowth. Educational reform, now extended to higher \r\neducation, has practically universalized basic \r\neducation. The secondary school population is \r\nfollowing the same trend, while university enrolment \r\nhas doubled through the institutionalization of equal \r\nopportunities and conditions. According to the United \r\nNations itself, Paraguay is in a position to achieve, for \r\nexample, the Millennium Development Goal related to \r\neducation. One of our key objectives here is to gain \r\ncertification of zero illiteracy for our country by 2008. \r\n Together with improving and significantly \r\nexpanding public and private health-care services, our \r\nenvironmental policy is recovering the great ecological \r\nsustainability which characterized Paraguay. This is \r\ntaking place in the midst of silent agrarian reform. In \r\naddition to the massive purchase of land for orphan \r\npeasants — which is still insufficient to alleviate the \r\nunfair distribution of land in Paraguay — we are \r\nimplementing a policy aimed at rural settlement and \r\nincreased production and productivity as a way of \r\ngiving fresh significance to peasant life, its \r\nsustainability and its dignity. \r\n Positive action is also taking place with a view to \r\nmodernizing the State through simplification, \r\ntransparency and making its services effective. We are \r\nseeking to improve public safety, combat corruption \r\nand eradicate piracy, drug trafficking and smuggling. If \r\none looks at the crime index, Paraguay has one of the \r\nlowest rates. Nevertheless, we are obliged to improve \r\nlegal security, and to do that we must implement a \r\nA/61/PV.11  \r\n \r\n06-52737 42 \r\n \r\npolicy of professional qualification and establish ethics \r\nin the judicial system. \r\n Development financing continues to be limited in \r\nterms of fulfilling national development plans and \r\nprogrammes, both those which are the result of \r\ninternational mobilization and those which result from \r\nthe domestic mobilization of financial resources. This \r\nsituation reflects the viability of various projects which \r\nare directed towards expanding productive \r\nemployment, improving basic social services, \r\neducation and adapting productive infrastructure and \r\nother areas of action which are essential for \r\ndevelopment. \r\n We are aware that the main task begins within our \r\ncountries. It is we who bear the main responsibility. \r\nHowever, with the increase in domestic savings, good \r\nmacroeconomic policies and a predictable country, we \r\nin Paraguay are reducing poverty and are moving \r\ntowards development. Therefore, our country continues \r\nto focus on rationalizing public expenditure and on \r\nsocial and productive investment. This fiscal discipline \r\nmakes us worthy of increased support from \r\ninternational financial institutions. But what we need in \r\nLatin America, as the President of our sister Republic \r\nof Bolivia said earlier today, are markets and partners, \r\nnot bosses or others who would continue to seize the \r\nwealth and natural resources of the peoples of our \r\nregion. \r\n On the subject of human rights, we welcome the \r\nfact that, through a process of focused consultations, \r\nthe General Assembly, in March, adopted resolution \r\n60/251, which established the Human Rights Council. \r\nThat Council will have a mechanism for the periodic \r\nand universal review of States’ compliance with their \r\nobligations in this important area, a review based on \r\ndialogue and cooperation. What we want is that the \r\ncriteria for assessing human rights be applied in the \r\nsame way and using the same principles both to \r\ndeveloping countries and to developed countries. The \r\nassessment of human rights would thus not affect only \r\ndeveloping countries and countries with emerging \r\neconomies, which are making great efforts at \r\ninstitution-building and at consolidating democracy \r\nand freedom. \r\n The fight against terrorism should unite people \r\nwho love liberty and seek respect for human rights and \r\nthe rule of law. While it is true that fundamentalism of \r\nall kinds is anachronistic and dangerous, terrorism \r\nshould not be the only item on the international \r\nagenda, excluding or relegating to the back burner the \r\nequally crucial debate on poverty and development in \r\ncountries with peripheral capitalism and those with \r\nemerging economies. Civilization means respect for \r\ndiversity and differences. Combating terrorism thus \r\nrequires that any repressive action be carried out within \r\nthe jurisdiction of international law and not through \r\nmere administrative procedures. \r\n With regard to the question of the representation \r\nin the United Nations of the 23 million inhabitants of \r\nTaiwan, Paraguay, consistent with the position it has \r\nlong held, confirms its support in favour of their \r\nadmission to the United Nations. Their inclusion is \r\nconsistent with the principle of universality embodied \r\nin our Charter, as well as with the norms of \r\ninternational law. \r\n To address the problems and conflicts now facing \r\nthe international community, it is necessary to create a \r\nmultipolar world and to make it function. The \r\nequilibrium of our twenty-first-century universe replete \r\nwith uncertainty, depends on multipolarity. For that \r\nreason, my country and the Common Market of the \r\nSouth (MERCOSUR) place their hopes on that \r\napproach, and in particular on the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council. It is shameful that what occurs in the \r\nCouncil should be seen as more important than the \r\nUnited Nations as an Organization which promotes a \r\nculture of peace, global development and the \r\nuniversalization of science and technology. \r\n In Latin America, as was said by my friend the \r\nPresident of our sister Republic of Bolivia, we have a \r\nculture of peace and brotherhood. We seek harmony \r\nwith our fellow human beings and with nature. \r\nUnfortunately, at other times in our history, we have \r\nexperienced warfare — not because our peoples \r\nwanted it, but because of manipulation by imperialists \r\nthirsting to destroy our wealth and fragment our \r\npeoples. We have put that history behind us. Today we \r\nlook to the future to see how we in our region can pool \r\nour efforts to deal with poverty and recover our \r\npeoples’ political, economic and cultural sovereignty. \r\n In addition, the hierarchy and institutional \r\nstructure of the United Nations depend on a world \r\nwhere equilibrium prevails, ensuring fairness in \r\ndecisions and action. We do not need sermons about \r\neducation for peace and the megamillions spent on the \r\narms build-up. We are not naïve and were offended to \r\n A/61/PV.11\r\n \r\n43 06-52737 \r\n \r\nsee that in 2004 alone, the super-Powers spent sums of \r\nmoney on rearming that could have put an end to \r\npoverty and ignorance in the world. \r\n Certainly military belligerence, which is so \r\ndestructive and so threatening, is not unrelated to the \r\nscandalous rise in the price of oil today, which is \r\ncausing insecurity, economic slowdown and stagnation \r\nin the developing countries. Inequality for our peoples \r\nshould not mean that we must take bread out of the \r\nmouths of the poor in order to waste millions of dollars \r\non fratricidal weapons. \r\n Over and above the events that threaten world \r\npeace are the daily lives of people. In our region, life is \r\ngood only for the minority and miserable for the \r\nmajority. \r\n Therefore, we urgently need a United Nations \r\nthat makes a contribution to the development, well-\r\nbeing and freedom of all peoples. Likewise, it is our \r\nduty to build an entirely prosperous, fair and united \r\nsociety so that the countenances of our citizens reflect \r\ntheir happy lives. May God illuminate our path, so that \r\nthere can be brotherhood among all nations and \r\nindividuals, and so that our history can truly embark on \r\nthe path of peace. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Paraguay for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Nicanor Duarte Frutos, President of the \r\nRepublic of Paraguay, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Omer Hassan Al-Bashir, President of \r\nthe Republic of the Sudan \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the \r\nRepublic of the Sudan. \r\n Mr. Omer Hassan Al-Bashir, President of the \r\nRepublic of the Sudan, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Omer Hassan \r\nAl-Bashir, President of the Republic of the Sudan, and \r\nto invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Al-Bashir (spoke in Arabic): It gives \r\nme great pleasure, Madam, to extend my warmest \r\ncongratulations to you on your election as President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-first session. There is \r\nno doubt that your election is an honour for us, because \r\nof the excellent relations between our two sisterly \r\ncountries. I am fully confident that you will lead our \r\ndeliberations to a successful conclusion. I would like \r\nalso to commend your predecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, \r\nfor the efficient way in which he guided the work of \r\nthe previous session. I seize this opportunity, \r\nfurthermore, to express our appreciation for the \r\nendeavours of the United Nations Secretariat in the \r\npast period. \r\n The Members of the United Nations are about to \r\nselect a new Secretary-General. We hope that they will \r\nchoose a new Secretary-General who will undertake his \r\nduties in a neutral, objective and transparent manner, \r\nso that our Organization can achieve the purposes to \r\nwhich we all aspire, serving the international \r\ncommunity in achieving peace, stability and global \r\nprosperity. \r\n I take this opportunity to welcome the Republic \r\nof Montenegro to membership of this Organization. \r\n This session has special importance for my \r\ncountry. It occurs on the fiftieth anniversary of the \r\nSudan joining the United Nations after it gained its \r\nindependence in the mid-twentieth century. The five \r\ndecades that have passed since then have strengthened \r\nthe aspirations of our country and our people for an \r\neffective and fair United Nations, as well as our \r\nconviction that the independence and political freedom \r\nachieved by our country, as well as our hopes for a \r\nbright, prosperous and developed future, could be \r\ndestroyed by the challenges of the present phase, \r\nincluding the double standards, the dangers of \r\nhegemony and the use of international forums to \r\nachieve political, economic or strategic objectives. \r\n The Government and the people of the Sudan \r\neagerly seek peace, which has become our strategic \r\nobjective. Because of our sincere will and strong \r\ndesire, peace has become a living reality. In January \r\n2005 we witnessed the signing of the Comprehensive \r\nPeace Agreement. That Agreement did merely address \r\nthe causes of the dispute between the south and the \r\nnorth, but offered fair solutions to all the problems \r\nfaced by our country. It established political rules for a \r\nsystem that recognizes citizenship as a basis for rights \r\nand duties, and that recognizes diversity and considers \r\nit to be a source of strength and unity. The system is \r\nA/61/PV.11  \r\n \r\n06-52737 44 \r\n \r\nbased on power-sharing, democratic principles, the rule \r\nof law, good governance and respect for human rights \r\nand freedoms. \r\n In the economic area, that Agreement establishes \r\nrules for wealth-sharing in accordance with criteria of \r\nfairness, brotherhood and equality between the central \r\nGovernment and the provinces of the south and the \r\nnorth. The Agreement is based on sound principles and \r\nstandards of justice and thus establishes the correct \r\nrules for a comprehensive peace, which should prevail \r\nthroughout the country. \r\n The implementation of the Agreement has \r\nprogressed at the national level. A Government of \r\nNational Unity has been formed, as was a Government \r\nof South Sudan. Legislative bodies have also been \r\nestablished, as well as the National Constitutional \r\nReview Commission, the National Judicial Services \r\nCommission and the National Petroleum Commission. \r\nAll options were presented to the President, who \r\nselected the best among them. At the moment, serious \r\nefforts continue to complete work on the other \r\ncommissions realistically, objectively and with good \r\nintentions. We have also begun, in cooperation with the \r\nUnited Nations, to prepare for the return of refugees \r\nand displaced persons, some of whom have already \r\nreturned. \r\n We were convinced that peace would not fully \r\nsucceed unless it also prevailed among our people in \r\nDarfur. I am pleased to convey to the Assembly that in \r\nMay we were able to sign the Darfur Peace Agreement, \r\nin Abuja. That had been a principal objective since the \r\nconflict in that region began. We express our deep \r\ngratitude and appreciation to all those who contributed \r\nto bringing about that great achievement, prominent \r\namong them the African Union, which has contributed \r\ntroops since the beginning of the crisis and has \r\nsponsored the negotiations on the issue. We also thank \r\nsisterly Nigeria, which has hosted the negotiations, and \r\nthe other partners who have worked to bring the \r\ndivergent views closer together and have spared no \r\neffort in pushing the parties towards an agreement. The \r\ngreat role undertaken by the African Union in Darfur is \r\nproof of what regional organizations can do to settle \r\ndisputes in their regions. \r\n That pioneering experiment should impel the \r\nSecurity Council to encourage all such organizations \r\nand genuinely and objectively support them in the \r\nmaintenance of regional peace and security, in \r\naccordance with the United Nations Charter and \r\nwithout their efforts being aborted or their roles \r\npre-empted by certain hegemonic parties that have \r\ntheir own illegal agendas. \r\n We have begun steps to implement the \r\nAgreement, through ongoing consultations with the \r\nAfrican Union and the Sudanese parties that are \r\nsignatories to the Agreement, in particular concerning \r\nsecurity arrangements, the sharing of power and wealth \r\nand the return of displaced persons, in addition to \r\npreparing for the Darfur-Darfur dialogue. \r\n We have buttressed the implementation effort — \r\nwhich is being carried out according to a timetable — \r\nby appointing Mr. Minni Arko Minawi, leader of the \r\nSudan Liberation Movement, as senior assistant to the \r\nPresident and Chairman of the Transitional Darfur \r\nRegional Authority. the Authority will be responsible \r\nfor enforcing the provisions of the Agreement. Those \r\nsteps will take us to the final phase: completion of all \r\nthe mechanisms necessary to implement the \r\nAgreement. \r\n Here we reaffirm the Government of National \r\nUnity’s commitment to the Agreement in letter and in \r\nspirit. I take the opportunity to sincerely invite all the \r\nparties that have not yet signed the Agreement or \r\njoined the peace process to do so, in order to \r\nconsolidate national efforts towards attaining stability. \r\n If the armed factions continue to refuse to join \r\nthe peace efforts, and persist in violence against and \r\nintimidation of citizens, they must be isolated and \r\nprevented from acting, in accordance with the Abuja \r\nPeace Agreement, which also stipulates that efforts by \r\nall signatories to the Agreement should be encouraged, \r\nin order to accelerate full implementation in letter and \r\nin spirit. The international community would thus be \r\nenabled to assist us in strengthening our capacity to \r\nbring about rehabilitation and reconstruction. \r\n We hope and expect that the international \r\ncommunity will fulfil its commitments concerning the \r\ncancellation of all of our foreign debt to States or to \r\nfinancial institutions, and will lift all restrictions and \r\neconomic and trade sanctions that had been imposed by \r\nsome international parties. These are impeding our \r\nreconstruction and development efforts. We will thus \r\nbe able to shoulder the burden of reconstruction, \r\nincrease the rate of growth and provide a life of dignity \r\nfor our people. \r\n A/61/PV.11\r\n \r\n45 06-52737 \r\n \r\n It is regrettable that some influential international \r\nparties, rather than fulfilling their pledges and \r\ncommitments and respecting the provisions of the \r\nAbuja Peace Agreement, continue instead to undermine \r\nthose efforts through unfair and unjustifiable pressures \r\nand partiality, and through the negative signals that \r\nthey send to non-signatories of the Abuja Agreement. \r\nThis has culminated in the exploitation of the Security \r\ncouncil, which has adopted resolutions that serve those \r\nparties’ interests and strategies, such as Council \r\nresolution 1706 (2006) which seeks to undermine \r\nnational and regional endeavours to implement the \r\nAbuja Agreement, as that resolution contradicts the \r\nAgreement in letter and in spirit. Indeed, it would place \r\nour country under the trusteeship of those influential \r\nparties. That makes it imperative to continue our \r\nefforts to implement the Abuja Agreement and to \r\nmobilize the resources and funding necessary to \r\nachieve a sustainable peace in Darfur, so that our \r\ncountry and our region can enjoy the fruits of that \r\npeace. \r\nMr. Jenie (Indonesia), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n Our country refuses all forms of dictates and all \r\nattempts to humiliate it and usurp its national will. It \r\nwholly rejects any attempts to re-colonize us in a new, \r\nsly manner. Thus we reject all attempts to impose new \r\ninternational forces in Darfur without taking into \r\naccount Darfur’s special circumstances and without \r\nconsultations with the Government of Sudan. The \r\nsubject has become, in itself, a goal in the service of \r\nsome internal political objectives of some parties. \r\n World leaders who met here last September to \r\nfollow up the results of the Millennium Summit \r\nadopted a document that calls for reform of the United \r\nNations, the promotion of international peace and \r\nsecurity, respect for human rights, adoption of \r\ncollective measures to combat poverty and bringing \r\nabout development and, in particular as regards issues \r\npertaining to funding development based on the \r\nMonterrey Consensus. \r\n What has been agreed to with regard to \r\npromoting the role of the United Nations calls upon us \r\nto work collectively with the necessary political will, \r\nparticularly on the part of the permanent members of \r\nthe Security Council. That should enable the \r\nOrganization to carry out its work in a truly democratic \r\nmanner. \r\n In this context, we call for agreement on reform \r\nof the Security Council and updating its working \r\nmethods. The Council’s present composition does not \r\nachieve this; it is an impediment to what we are \r\nseeking — real democracy in the management of \r\ninternational relations. What makes the call for reform \r\nmore imperative is the eruption of conflicts that \r\nthreaten peace and security without the Council \r\nmaking any effective move to contain them. A good \r\ncase in point are the tragic developments in the Middle \r\nEast. The Council watched helplessly while those \r\ndevelopments occurred. This emphasizes the point that \r\nstructural and institutional reform of the Security \r\nCouncil has become more imperative today than ever \r\nbefore. \r\n In this context, my delegation reaffirms its \r\ncommitment to the African position as stipulated in the \r\nEzulwini document, a position that was reiterated at the \r\nAfrican summits held in Serte, Khartoum and Banjul. \r\n The follow-up to the outcome of the Millennium \r\nSummit has shown clearly that what has been achieved \r\nhas not met our expectations, particularly in regard to \r\nthe African continent, which is bleeding to death under \r\nits debt burden and is facing an incompatible, non-\r\nconducive economic and trade environment. The \r\nproblems of hunger, poverty and disease in Africa have \r\nreached very serious dimensions and constitute a great \r\nthreat to the international community. They will \r\ncontinue to haunt us unless efforts by the international \r\ncommunity are consolidated in order to accelerate \r\nfairer development in developing countries, \r\nparticularly in the least developed ones. It will be \r\nimpossible to reach the Millennium Development Goal \r\nof reducing poverty by half by the year 2015. The \r\ncorrect path towards achieving the MDGs requires that \r\nwe emphasize the importance of total debt \r\ncancellation, as debts are a great impediment to \r\nbringing about those goals, particularly in Africa and in \r\nthe least developed countries. \r\n We attach great importance to the fact that \r\ndeveloped countries should fulfil their commitments \r\nconcerning financing for development and \r\nimplementing the Brussels Programme of Action for \r\nthe Least Developed Countries. They should work to \r\nreform financing institutions, which will promote \r\ntransparency and lead to larger representation for \r\ndeveloping countries in such institutions. They should \r\nincrease technical and financial assistance so that an \r\ninvestment environment for the private sector can be \r\nA/61/PV.11  \r\n \r\n06-52737 46 \r\n \r\ncreated, suitable infrastructures can be brought about, \r\nthe environment can be protected and corruption can be \r\ncombated. \r\n The imposition of unilateral coercive economic \r\nmeasures on developing countries constitutes an \r\nimpediment to freedom of commerce and investment. \r\nFunding issues and the transfer of technology are still \r\nmain components of sustainable development. Here we \r\nwould like to emphasize the provision of assistance to \r\nthe least developed countries in social services, \r\neducation, health care, and for combating diseases such \r\nas AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, which kill millions \r\nof people every year. \r\n We seize this opportunity to reaffirm once again \r\nour commitment to what we agreed on in the \r\nMillennium Declaration and to reaching the Goals \r\ncontained therein for a better life for humanity as a \r\nwhole, with full emphasis on the right of developing \r\ncountries to determine their own development \r\npriorities without restrictions or prior conditions that \r\nwould hinder their development efforts. We would like \r\nto highlight also the importance of guaranteeing that \r\nthe proposed new financing mechanisms will not \r\nnegatively impact investment flows. \r\n The Sudan has made great efforts towards \r\nachieving those Goals and has achieved noticeable \r\nprogress, particularly in reducing the poverty rate and \r\nexpanding public education, despite the unjust embargo \r\nand the longstanding conflict in the south of the \r\ncountry. \r\n My country has expressed its condemnation of \r\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations and has \r\ncalled for the adoption of an international strategy to \r\ncombat it. In this context, we believe that the definition \r\nof terrorism distinguishes it clearly from the just \r\nstruggle by people to preserve their legitimate right to \r\ndefend their freedom and the right to self-\r\ndetermination. That must be the main pillar on which \r\nthe international community should fully agree. The \r\nSudan believes in the international campaign to combat \r\nthe phenomenon of terrorism, in accordance with the \r\nUnited Nations Charter, principles of international law \r\nand the inviolability of the sovereignty of States. \r\n The question of Palestine is a story that embodies \r\nthe suffering of a people that has been deprived of its \r\npolitical and economic rights. The Israeli occupation \r\ncontinues to be a heavy burden on the legitimate \r\nPalestinian dreams to bring about freedom and \r\ndevelopment. The international community must force \r\nIsrael to fulfil the obligations it has undertaken, \r\nincluding the road map, halting construction of the \r\nseparation wall, and heeding the Advisory Opinion of \r\nthe International Court of Justice issued in July 2004. \r\nThis was adopted by the General Assembly at its tenth \r\nemergency session, enabling the Palestinian people to \r\nexercise its right to self-determination and to establish \r\nan independent State, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its \r\ncapital. \r\n We renew our full support to the Palestinian \r\npeople and its elected institutions. We call on the \r\ninternational community to respect the choices made \r\nby the Palestinian people and to shoulder its \r\nresponsibilities vis-à-vis the Palestinian \r\nGovernment — which has come about through free and \r\nfair elections — to lift the embargo imposed against it \r\nand to support it. We call upon the international \r\ncommunity to pressure Israel to halt its ongoing \r\naggression against the Gaza Strip and release the \r\nabducted Palestinian ministers and parliamentarians. \r\n The Israeli aggression against Lebanon last \r\nAugust, which targeted innocent civilians — women \r\nand children — has shaken the world’s conscience. \r\nThis is a flagrant violation of international \r\nhumanitarian law and agreements. We would like to \r\nexpress our full solidarity with the people and the \r\nGovernment of Lebanon and with the resistance. We \r\ncommend their steadfastness in the face of this flagrant \r\naggression, and we hold Israel responsible for the \r\ndestruction and the sabotage of brotherly Lebanon. We \r\ncall for the establishment of an international \r\ncommission to investigate the war crimes perpetrated \r\nby Israel, and we call also on international, regional \r\nand volunteer organizations to intensify their \r\nemergency efforts to provide assistance to the victims. \r\n We have always been convinced that the volatility \r\nof the situation in the Middle East and the ongoing \r\ntensions are due to the Israeli occupation, and that a \r\ncomprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict \r\nand the advent of peace in the region cannot be \r\nachieved unless Israel withdraws completely from all \r\nthe territories occupied since 1967, including the \r\noccupied Syrian Golan and the Shab’a farms. \r\n We wish to emphasize in that context the \r\nimportance of making the Middle East a zone free of \r\nweapons of mass destruction, with no exceptions, in \r\n A/61/PV.11\r\n \r\n47 06-52737 \r\n \r\norder to bring about security and stability, which would \r\nbenefit all the peoples of the region. \r\n We reiterate our support for Iraq and its territorial \r\nintegrity. We believe that its sovereignty should extend \r\nto all its territory, and we call on all segments of Iraqi \r\nsociety to engage in dialogue with a view to resolving \r\ntheir problems. We welcome the initiative of the \r\nLeague of Arab States to hold a national reconciliation \r\nconference, and we support all sincere efforts aimed at \r\nbringing stability to brotherly Iraq, so that it can \r\nresume its rightful place in the regional context. \r\n In Somalia, there have been recent positive \r\ndevelopments in the reconciliation process led by the \r\nSudan, in coordination with the Arab League, which \r\nhave led to the Somali Transitional Federal \r\nGovernment signing an agreement with the Islamic \r\nCourts Union and a reconciliation statement in \r\nKhartoum in June 2006. There is no doubt that this will \r\npromote the reconciliation efforts currently led at the \r\nregional level by the Intergovernmental Authority on \r\nDevelopment (IGAD). We hope that our brothers in \r\nSomalia will continue the dialogue and promote \r\nreconciliation efforts in order to bring about stability \r\nand security, so that sisterly Somalia can transcend this \r\nvery difficult phase. \r\n We are fully convinced that Africa is rich in \r\nhuman resources and cultural heritage and that it has \r\nthe material and human means to ensure a bright future \r\nfor itself. However, Africa faces many complex \r\nchallenges, such as the achievement of stability and \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Unless all of Africa works in a united and \r\nconcerted manner, it will not be possible to realize our \r\naspirations. We in Africa, more than anyone else, are \r\nresponsible for translating those aspirations into reality. \r\nWe are prepared to work, in an effective partnership \r\nwith others, to do so. That will benefit our African \r\npeoples and contribute to stability at the international \r\nlevel, as envisaged by the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment initiative. \r\n The Great Lakes region is emerging from a \r\nlengthy and deadly conflict, which has given way to a \r\nphase in which democracy is taking root. The \r\nInternational Conference for the Great Lakes Region, \r\nwhich is still in the preparatory stages and is aimed at \r\ndefining conditions and criteria conducive to ongoing \r\nregional cooperation among the States of the region, \r\nwill hold its second summit next December in Nairobi \r\nto adopt a treaty on security and stability in the region. \r\nThe process is facilitated by the United Nations, the \r\nAfrican Union and some of our partners and is tangible \r\nproof of the genuine political will of the countries of \r\nthe region. It is a unique initiative to build peace in the \r\nregion. \r\n I should like from this rostrum to call on the \r\ninternational community to step up the pace in the \r\nprovision of the financial and political support \r\nnecessary to push this treaty forward and ensure its \r\nadoption for the Great Lakes region. We call for \r\nsupport for the implementation of that treaty, so that \r\nthe peoples of the region will cease being victimized \r\nby disputes, humanitarian disasters or insecurity and be \r\nable to realize their aspirations to peace, stability and \r\ndevelopment. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Jens Stoltenberg, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Kingdom of Norway \r\n \r\nMr. Jens Stoltenberg, Prime Minister of the \r\nKingdom of Norway, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Jens Stoltenberg, Prime \r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Norway, and inviting him \r\nto address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Stoltenberg (Norway): The United Nations \r\nis now more at the centre of international affairs than it \r\nhas been for many years. We see the Secretary-General \r\nand his staff driving diplomacy. They are on the \r\nground, moving forward peace efforts in the Middle \r\nEast and coordinating and sustaining peace operations \r\nin Lebanon. The United Nations is drawing up \r\nmandates and getting ready for new and urgent \r\nassignments, such as the one in Darfur. \r\n The United Nations is assisting countries coming \r\nout of conflict, such as Burundi and Sierra Leone. It is \r\ngiving protection under international law to soldiers \r\nand civilians in Afghanistan. It is also launching a \r\nGlobal Counter-Terrorism Strategy. \r\n It is to the United Nations that we all turn when \r\nother processes fail, and Norway is working hard to \r\nsupport its leading role, be it by sending naval units to \r\nA/61/PV.11  \r\n \r\n06-52737 48 \r\n \r\nLebanese waters, by having soldiers in Afghanistan, or \r\nby training future peacekeepers for Darfur. \r\n The policy platform of the Norwegian \r\nGovernment states that: \r\n“It is in Norway’s best interest that we have a \r\nUnited Nations-led world order. The Government \r\nwill therefore work to strengthen the United \r\nNations and international law.” \r\n The United Nations can count on Norway. We \r\nbelieve that our combined efforts in the areas of peace, \r\nthe environment and development will pass the tests of \r\nforesight as well as hindsight. \r\n Those of us who are staunch supporters of a \r\nstrong and effective United Nations must also be key \r\nplayers in driving the process of change and renewal. I \r\nhave the honour to serve with colleagues on a panel for \r\nUnited Nations reform appointed by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. The Panel is drawing up proposals on how the \r\nUnited Nations can deliver more and do so better and \r\nfaster in the areas of development, humanitarian \r\nassistance and the environment. \r\n It was the 2005 Summit that called for greater \r\ncoherence in and better governance of the United \r\nNations. Over time the United Nations has added new \r\nbodies, new organs and new activities to its portfolio. \r\nFew people comprehend the overall picture; few can \r\ntell what the United Nations is doing in a particular \r\ncountry for development; and few can definitively \r\nanswer how much money the United Nations is \r\nspending in a specific country. \r\n In several countries the United Nations system is \r\nrepresented by more than 20 different organizations. A \r\ncountry such as Ghana is reported to be host to 14 \r\ndifferent United Nations agencies. Many United \r\nNations organizations deal with many of the same \r\nissues. This is simply overlapping. More than 20 \r\ndifferent United Nations organizations deal with water \r\nand more than 10 United Nations organizations deal \r\nwith the promotion of education for young girls. This \r\nleads to a fragmented, loosely governed system; it \r\nleads to duplication and reduces possibilities for \r\nmonitoring results. This is not the way we would \r\ngovern our own affairs — nationally or locally. It is \r\nwe, the Member States, who are to blame. \r\n We must put an end to duplication, fragmentation \r\nand rivalry between different parts of the system. \r\nInstead, we must focus on results. We must be willing \r\nto change, adapt to new situations and relinquish tasks \r\nthat are no longer needed. We need to ensure that less \r\nis spent on bureaucracy, and more is spent in the field. \r\n Let us take, for example, the coordination of \r\nhumanitarian relief after the establishment of the \r\nCentral Emergency Response Fund headed by Jan \r\nEgeland. With these resources, he is able to coordinate \r\nmore effectively through the direction of the financial \r\nflows. In the absence of a crisis governance and \r\nfinancing cannot be separated. \r\n All matters of reform seem extremely \r\ncontroversial here in the United Nations, but they must \r\nbe carried out. The most irresponsible thing we could \r\ndo now would be to do nothing, i.e. to allow bodies, \r\ngoverning boards and their representatives to duplicate \r\nwork and squander scarce resources. \r\n The report of the High-level Panel on System-\r\nwide Coherence will be presented to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral later this year. We have had an open, \r\ntransparent process. We have held meetings in all parts \r\nof the world and listened to a great many stakeholders, \r\npractitioners and country representatives. My plea to \r\nyou all — to all the Member States — is to meet that \r\nreport with an open mind. \r\n Let me be clear about this: any efficiency gain \r\nmust be channelled back to the developing world. \r\nEvery single cent gained in improved performance or \r\nreduced overhead must go to aid that reaches the \r\nneedy. Recipients and donors alike would find that \r\nattractive. \r\n We are in the fortunate position of having set \r\nclear goals for the Organization. Six years ago we \r\nadopted the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \r\nhere in New York. We pledged to do our utmost to \r\nachieve these goals — Norway is working on all eight. \r\nThis year we give 0.96 per cent of our gross national \r\nproduct in development assistance and we will reach \r\nthe 1 per cent mark in a few years. \r\n Now we have vigorously set out to take a lead in \r\nrealizing Millennium Development Goal 4, which \r\ncompels us to reduce child mortality by two thirds by \r\n2015. Every year, children, in numbers equal to one \r\nand a half times the population of New York City, die \r\nbefore their fifth birthday — most of them from \r\npreventable diseases. A number of children, equal to \r\nthe death toll in the recent tsunami, die every month \r\nfrom pneumonia alone. Vaccines, costing just $20 for \r\n A/61/PV.11\r\n \r\n49 06-52737 \r\n \r\neach child, could have prevented most of those \r\ncommon diseases. \r\n Allowing such child mortality puts shackles on \r\nthe growth potential of States, prolonging the long \r\nnight of underdevelopment. This can and must be \r\nchanged. Yesterday I announced that the Norwegian \r\nGovernment has decided to increase its annual \r\ncontribution to child mortality and vaccines from \r\n$75 million per year to $125 million next year. In total, \r\nNorway will contribute $1.3 billion through 2015 for \r\nvaccine-related activities to reduce child mortality. \r\n The next step will be to develop a global strategy \r\nfor reaching Millennium Development Goal 4, \r\nspecifically a plan for financing and execution. \r\nMeeting that Goal, and other Millennium Development \r\nGoals, really depends on United Nations reform. An \r\norganization that sets goals and carves them in stone — \r\nas we did when we adopted the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals — such an organization must adapt \r\nits structure and methods of work to these goals. \r\n We also have to reform the United Nations to \r\nreduce child mortality, i.e. in order to save lives as we \r\nsaid we should. We have done great things in the past \r\nand have greater means than any other generation and \r\nany other organization. I invite you all to join this \r\nglobal campaign for child survival. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nKingdom of Norway for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\nMr. Jens Stoltenberg, Prime Minister of the \r\nKingdom of Norway, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n \r\nAddress by Ms. Teima Onorio, Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Kiribati \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Vice-President of the Republic \r\nof Kiribati. \r\nMs. Teima Onorio, Vice-President of the Republic \r\nof Kiribati, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure \r\nhonour in welcoming Her Excellency Ms. Teima \r\nOnorio, Vice-President of the Republic of Kiribati, and \r\nin inviting her to address the General Assembly. \r\n Ms. Onorio (Kiribati): I bring to you all warm \r\ngreetings from the President, Government and people \r\nof the Republic of Kiribati, on whose behalf I am \r\nhonoured and privileged to address this Assembly this \r\nevening. \r\n Allow me, Sir, to offer my heartiest \r\ncongratulations to Ms. Al-Khalifa on her election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \r\nsession. I am confident that under her able stewardship \r\nthis session will successfully deliver constructive and \r\nproductive outcomes that will benefit the membership. \r\nI wish also to offer my congratulations to her \r\npredecessor for his successful guidance of the work of \r\nthe Assembly during the past year. \r\n May I also express to the Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Kofi Annan, my warmest congratulations on his \r\nsterling leadership of the Organization during his \r\ntenure in office. We are grateful for the excellent work \r\nhe has done in navigating the Organization through the \r\nchallenges of the past decade. We wish him well in his \r\nfuture endeavours. \r\n We continue to be confronted with major \r\nchallenges. Those challenges affect each of us as \r\nindividual countries and as members of the \r\ninternational community. Peace and security remain \r\nelusive in this world of ours, given the ongoing \r\nconflicts and the threat of new conflicts around the \r\nworld. Terrorism continues to plague us, despite the \r\nbest concerted and collective efforts. Still more needs \r\nto be done to remove the threat posed by the \r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. And \r\nwhile some progress has been made towards addressing \r\nthe threat posed by the continuing illicit trade in small \r\narms and light weapons, further work is needed to \r\neliminate that threat. \r\n For the least developed countries and the small \r\nisland developing States, the challenges of economic \r\ndevelopment remain at the forefront of our agendas. \r\nMarginalization in the global economy is a feature \r\ncommon to many least developed countries and small \r\nisland developing States. The record high price of oil \r\nhas done little to ease the burden on our small \r\neconomies. \r\n In Kiribati, our remoteness and insularity, narrow \r\neconomic base, small population size and high \r\npopulation growth rates are factors with which we must \r\ncontend. We must also deal with the HIV/AIDS \r\npandemic and tuberculosis, among other diseases, \r\nA/61/PV.11  \r\n \r\n06-52737 50 \r\n \r\nwhich require the diversion of the already meagre \r\nresources at our disposal to finance development. \r\n With those daunting challenges looming, we are \r\nforced to operate in an environment of uncertainty. I \r\nsay “uncertainty”, because our very survival as a nation \r\nand as a people with a distinct culture and way of life \r\nis being threatened by global warming and sea-level \r\nrise. \r\n These are challenges that we, as individual \r\ncountries and as Members of this collective body, need \r\nto continue to work together to address. In this \r\nincreasingly interdependent world of ours, ripples \r\nemanating from one part will ultimately reach out to \r\ntouch the shores of others. \r\n Kiribati consists of low-lying coral atolls and is \r\nparticularly vulnerable to the impact of global warming \r\nand sea-level rise. For countries such as ours, global \r\nwarming and sea-level rise are critical security issues. \r\nWhile we welcome the support that has been \r\nforthcoming in developing adaptation strategies to \r\nthese phenomena, there is a limit to the extent to which \r\nwe can adapt. Rising sea levels will affect our \r\ngroundwater supply and gradually erode whatever land \r\nis available on our 33 islands. Yes, we could always \r\nmove inland to avoid the rising sea levels. But, given \r\nthe narrowness of our islands, if we move inland too \r\nfar, we risk falling into either the lagoon or the ocean. \r\n We will continue to call on the international \r\ncommunity to agree on a unified global response to \r\nthese phenomena. We will continue to work with like-\r\nminded countries in pushing the case for such a \r\nresponse. We have been disappointed at the lack of \r\nconsensus on these critical environmental issues. \r\nIndeed, we deplore the notion that economic growth \r\nshould take precedence over environmental issues \r\nwhen the quest for such growth threatens the very \r\nsurvival of some Members of the Organization. \r\n Kiribati is a strong supporter of environmental \r\nconservation efforts. In that regard, we have announced \r\nthe establishment of the Phoenix Islands Protected \r\nArea, which is recognized as the third largest marine \r\nprotected area in the world. We are pleased to have \r\nbeen able to contribute to global environmental \r\nconservation efforts through the Protected Area. We are \r\nprepared to work with those willing and able to ensure \r\nits sustainability. \r\n We note the progress that has been made with \r\nregard to reforming the United Nations. \r\nUnderstandably, we would have liked to see greater \r\nprogress made by now, but we fully recognize the need \r\nfor more discussions on the various relevant issues. \r\n Indeed, that is multilateralism in practice. The \r\ndebate on unilateralism versus multilateralism in world \r\naffairs continues unabated. We see multilateralism in \r\nfull play in the debate on United Nations reform. We \r\nconsider that to be a reflection of the healthy interest \r\nthat each Member country has in the Organization. \r\nIndeed, in this day and age, multilateralism would \r\nseem to be a more appropriate approach than \r\nunilateralism. \r\n Consensus has yet to be reached on reform of the \r\nSecurity Council. We note with interest the report of \r\nthe Working Group. While acknowledging the very \r\nstrong interest in the issues raised and the need to forge \r\na consensus, we believe that perhaps there is also a \r\nneed to consider how much more time will be required \r\nto move this forward. \r\n Our position on the issue remains unchanged: \r\nthose Member States that are major contributors to \r\nUnited Nations programmes — especially with regard \r\nto the maintenance of global peace and security — \r\nshould be accorded permanent membership of the \r\nSecurity Council. In our view, Japan, as such a \r\nMember State, qualifies for permanent membership. \r\n Regional cooperation in the Pacific has been \r\neffective. In the recent past, we have had a number of \r\nexamples of success in regional cooperative efforts. \r\nThe Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon \r\nIslands has made substantial contributions to securing \r\npeace and law and order in that country. Kiribati is \r\npleased to have been able to contribute civilian police \r\npersonnel to the Mission. We will continue to support \r\nits work as long as the people and the Government of \r\nthe Solomon Islands wish it to continue. \r\n The Pacific Regional Assistance to Nauru \r\nprogramme has made positive contributions to Nauru. \r\nIn view of the historical ties between our two \r\ncountries, we have worked closely with Nauru on a \r\nbilateral basis and remain committed to considering \r\nother options through which we can extend our \r\ncollaboration. \r\n A/61/PV.11\r\n \r\n51 06-52737 \r\n \r\n Our leaders will be meeting next month to \r\ndiscuss, among other things, progress on the Pacific \r\nPlan. We are satisfied with the initial progress. The \r\nsuccess or lack thereof of the Pacific Plan will depend \r\non a number of factors, including the political \r\ncommitment of each member country to the Plan and \r\nthe Plan’s ability to deliver tangible benefits over and \r\nabove what is available, on a bilateral basis, to its \r\nmembership. \r\n We extend a warm welcome to the Republic of \r\nMontenegro, which joined the Organization as a \r\nMember this year. Montenegro’s membership brings to \r\n192 the total United Nations membership. The \r\ncontinuing desire on the part of many to join the \r\nOrganization attests to the value and continued \r\nrelevance of the United Nations. \r\n Therefore, I note with much disappointment and \r\nregret that the desire of the 23 million people of \r\nTaiwan to join this Organization of ours continues to \r\nbe rejected, despite Taiwan’s demonstrated ability, \r\nwillingness and commitment to contribute to \r\ninternational collaborative efforts in the pursuit of \r\nglobal peace and security. In recent years, there has \r\nbeen much talk of good governance, of democratizing  \r\n \r\nnations. Should we not also talk about adopting a \r\npolicy of good governance in our multilateral \r\norganizations? Should we also not talk about \r\ndemocratizing our multilateral organizations? We \r\ndeplore the sad state of affairs in which a nation of 23 \r\nmillion people is deliberately exempt from \r\nparticipation as an equal member of the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n The President of the General Assembly has our \r\nfull support as she carries out the duties of her office. \r\nWe commit ourselves to working closely with her as \r\nwe collectively seek to address the challenges facing \r\nus. \r\n Allow me to close by conveying to all members \r\nof the General Assembly our traditional blessing: to \r\nmauri, to raoi ao to tabomoa — health, peace and \r\nprosperity. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Kiribati for the statement she has just \r\nmade. \r\nMs. Teima Onorio, Vice-President of the Republic \r\nof Kiribati, was escorted from the rostrum. \r\n  The meeting rose at 9.20 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
