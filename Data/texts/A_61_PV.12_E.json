(Bahrain) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Hâmid Karzai, President of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Afghanistan \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Islamic Republic of \r\nAfghanistan. \r\n Mr. Hâmid Karzai, President of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Afghanistan, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Hâmid Karzai, President of \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, and to invite him \r\nto address the General Assembly. \r\n President Karzai: Every year our gathering \r\nunder this roof does homage to the foresight of our \r\npredecessors, who, by founding the United Nations, \r\nenvisioned the unity of nations. Today, this Assembly \r\nembodies that vision: the vision of our interdependence \r\nas members of a single community of nations. This \r\nvision has a strong resonance in Afghanistan, where \r\nboth our past troubles and our recent accomplishments \r\nare, in large part, related to the outside world. \r\n When I last addressed the Assembly in 2004 I \r\nspoke about the tremendous progress that Afghanistan \r\nhad achieved since 2001. Today that story of success \r\ncontinues. Over the past two years we have taken \r\nfurther significant steps forward, attaining all the \r\nmilestones in Afghanistan’s post-war transition. \r\nMillions of Afghans have participated in two general \r\nelections, one for the president and another for the \r\nparliament. With the inauguration of our National \r\nAssembly last year all three independent branches of a \r\ndemocratic state were completed. We have continued to \r\nbuild schools and clinics and create employment \r\nopportunities for our people. Our trade with the region \r\nand beyond is growing very rapidly. Industrial activity \r\nis gradually taking root. As a result, Afghanistan’s \r\nincome per capita has doubled since 2002. \r\n At the London Conference earlier this year our \r\nGovernment presented Afghanistan’s National \r\nDevelopment Strategy for the next five years, which \r\nthe international community endorsed. Afghanistan and \r\nits international partners also entered into a compact, \r\nthe Afghanistan Compact, which provides the \r\nframework for continued international cooperation in \r\nAfghanistan. Under the compact we Afghans \r\ncommitted to continue to work towards a stable and \r\nprosperous Afghanistan, with good governance and \r\nhuman rights protection for all under the rule of law. In \r\nreturn, the international community pledged continued \r\nand long-term political, military and financial \r\nassistance. \r\n Regrettably, it is not all positive news that I have \r\nto share today. Over the past year our efforts to build \r\nAfghanistan into a stable, prosperous and democratic \r\npolity have also encountered setbacks. We have seen \r\nterrorism rebounding as terrorists have infiltrated our \r\nborders to step up their murderous campaign against \r\nour people. Terrorism sees in the prosperity of the \r\nA/61/PV.12  \r\n \r\n06-52879 2 \r\n \r\nAfghan people its ultimate defeat. That is why our \r\nschools and clinics get burned down, and our ulema, \r\nour teachers and our doctors get killed. That is why \r\ntoday 200,000 of our students who went to school a \r\nyear ago are no longer able to do so. \r\n It is also sobering to know that polio, the \r\nchildren’s disease, increased from only four cases in \r\n2005 to 27 this year. All those cases occurred in some \r\nareas of southern Afghanistan where terrorists are \r\npreventing children’s access to vaccination and health \r\ncare. \r\n Terrorists are prepared to cross any boundary and \r\ncommit horrific acts of violence to try to derail \r\nAfghanistan from its path to success. They want the \r\ninternational community to fail in its collective \r\nendeavour to help Afghanistan to rebuild. That is why \r\nthey decapitate elderly women, blow up mosques full \r\nof worshippers and kill schoolchildren in \r\nindiscriminate bombings of civilian areas. That is why \r\nthey are killing international soldiers and civilians who \r\nhave come to Afghanistan to help the Afghan people, \r\nsuch as the four Canadian soldiers who were killed \r\nfour days ago while distributing notebooks and candies \r\nto children in a village in Kandahar, or the Turkish \r\nengineer who was building roads in Helmand. Clearly, \r\nunless we confront them more decisively, terrorists will \r\ncontinue to take lives and inflict greater damage. \r\n To be sure, terrorism does not emanate from \r\nwithin Afghanistan; Afghanistan is its worst victim. \r\nMilitary action in Afghanistan alone, therefore, will not \r\ndeliver our shared goal of eliminating terrorism. We \r\nmust look beyond Afghanistan to the sources of \r\nterrorism. We must destroy terrorist sanctuaries beyond \r\nAfghanistan, dismantle the elaborate networks in the \r\nregion that recruit, indoctrinate, train, finance, arm and \r\ndeploy terrorists. We must ensure that political currents \r\nand entities in the region are not allowed to use \r\nextremism as an instrument of policy. \r\n Fighting terrorism effectively is also tied to our \r\nfight against narcotics. The menace of narcotics feeds \r\nterrorism and threatens the foundation of legitimate \r\neconomic development in Afghanistan and also, of \r\ncourse, in the region. \r\n A combination of factors — mainly the lack of a \r\nsecurity environment conducive to our counter-\r\nnarcotics efforts, the absence of a comprehensive \r\nalternative livelihoods programme and clandestine \r\ncredit flows to poppy farmers — is behind the \r\nnarcotics trade. Afghanistan is committed to fighting \r\nnarcotics, alongside terrorism, with strength and \r\ndetermination and through a combination of law \r\nenforcement and economic measures. We expect that \r\nthe international community will continue to support us \r\nin this fight by enabling us to provide meaningful \r\nalternative livelihoods to our farmers. \r\n In the context of the United Nations role in \r\nenhancing global security we endorse the \r\nrecommendations of the Secretary-General for a \r\ncomprehensive counter-terrorism strategy and welcome \r\nthe recent adoption of the strategy by the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n We also express our support for the proposal to \r\nconvene a high-level conference on international \r\nterrorism with a view to concluding the draft \r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism at \r\nthe earliest possible opportunity. \r\n Afghanistan also attaches great importance to the \r\nvarious initiatives undertaken to promote \r\nunderstanding and cooperation among civilizations. \r\nAfghanistan stands ready to contribute to further \r\nenriching these initiatives with our knowledge and \r\nexperience of international cooperation and \r\ninterdependence. \r\n Meanwhile, we remain deeply concerned at the \r\nincreased incidence of Islamophobia in the West. This \r\ntrend does not bode well for the cause of building \r\nunderstanding and cooperation across civilizations. As \r\na Muslim nation, Afghanistan is committed not only to \r\nsafeguarding the interest of our Holy Faith but also to \r\nbuilding bridges of understanding and friendship \r\namong followers of all faiths. \r\n The situation in the Middle East, including the \r\nquestion of Palestine, remains a source of great \r\nconcern to us in Afghanistan. Afghanistan strongly \r\nsupports the full realization of the rights of the \r\nPalestinian people, including the right to sovereignty \r\nand an independent State of Palestine living side by \r\nside in peace and coexistence with the State of Israel. \r\nAfghanistan also shares the pain of the people of \r\nLebanon as they suffer a terrible relapse into \r\ndestruction caused by war. We hope that the \r\ninternational community will step in with concern and \r\ngenerosity to address Lebanon’s needs so that it may \r\nrecover. \r\n A/61/PV.12\r\n \r\n3 06-52879 \r\n \r\n To conclude, I thank the Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Kofi Annan, for his exemplary leadership in \r\nserving the cause of global security and prosperity. I \r\nthank him especially for his interest in and \r\ncommitment to Afghanistan and for his contribution to \r\nmaking our world a more secure place. \r\n I also thank the members of the international \r\ncommunity for their steadfast and generous support for \r\nAfghanistan over the past five years. I convey the \r\ngratitude of the Afghan people for the sacrifices that \r\nthe men and women in uniform from about 40 \r\ncountries throughout the world have made in the fight \r\nagainst terrorism in Afghanistan. We will honour those \r\nsacrifices by remaining true to our vision of building a \r\nsecure, democratic and prosperous Afghanistan that \r\nwill contribute to the progress of our region and to the \r\nsecurity of the world at large. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I thank the President of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Afghanistan for his statement. \r\n Mr. Hâmid Karzai, President of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Afghanistan, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Martín Torrijos, President of the \r\nRepublic of Panama \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Panama. \r\n Mr. Martín Torrijos, President of the Republic of \r\nPanama, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Martín Torrijos, President \r\nof the Republic of Panama, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly. \r\n President Torrijos (spoke in Spanish): I should \r\nlike to say how pleased the Government of Panama is \r\nat your election, Madam, to preside over the sixty-first \r\nsession of the General Assembly. Your illustrious \r\nprofessional record and your extraordinary action in \r\ndefence of women’s rights lead us to believe that you \r\nwill guide us in an exemplary manner. I also \r\ncongratulate the Secretary-General on his encouraging \r\nwords yesterday. The ovation that ensued bears witness \r\nto the Assembly’s gratitude for his efforts over 10 years \r\nof heading the Secretariat. \r\n Over the past few years we have dedicated \r\nconsiderable effort and time to the task of reforming \r\nthe United Nations. We are doing this for one simple \r\nreason: we want it to work better. That aspiration is \r\nbased on a profound conviction that the Organization is \r\nindispensable for humanity. Those who criticize the \r\nOrganization must be honest when they wonder what \r\nthe world would be like without the United Nations \r\nand its specialized agencies. Those who govern are \r\nexamined on a daily basis by their peoples and \r\nsometimes they are criticized very severely, but nobody \r\nsuggests that there should not be a government. We \r\nwant governments to be better because they are \r\nnecessary, just as we want the United Nations to be \r\nbetter because it is equally necessary. We do not want \r\nto imagine a world without a United Nations. That is \r\nwhy at the Summit in September last year, as the \r\nculmination of long debate and tremendous collective \r\neffort, we agreed on a series of reforms for the United \r\nNations machinery. \r\n What is at stake today is not just the fate of a \r\nsingle initiative, but, rather, the effectiveness of the \r\nUnited Nations in complying with the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter. The General Assembly has \r\nacted with diligence, and we are proud in particular of \r\nthe decision to create a Human Rights Council, whose \r\nestablishment should strengthen respect for human \r\nrights and spread their promotion globally. Panama, \r\nborn closely linked to international affairs, continues to \r\nbe committed to strengthening human rights \r\nthroughout the world. It is in this field that we see the \r\ngreatest paradox: where the United Nations has made \r\nthe most progress is where there remains the most \r\nprogress still to be made. Before its inception human \r\nrights violations were almost ignored. Today the \r\ndenunciations made at the United Nations have a \r\ntremendous deterrent power, so those violations do not \r\ncontinue to be perpetrated. At the same time, it is true \r\nthat there have been horrendous violations during the \r\nlife of the United Nations, but no one can deny that the \r\nreality and consequences are very different from the \r\nsituation that prevailed only a few decades ago. \r\n The United Nations and its specialized agencies \r\nhave the important task of coordinating efforts to \r\nprotect the millions of human beings living in poverty. \r\nPoverty is the daily denial of man’s fundamental rights. \r\nWhile genocide causes indignation and is emphatically \r\nrejected by the international community, there should \r\nbe the same indignation over poverty, as it afflicts a \r\nA/61/PV.12  \r\n \r\n06-52879 4 \r\n \r\nlarge part of the world’s population. Governments have \r\na moral obligation to help people and communities \r\nliving below the poverty line. Economic growth rates \r\nare deceptive, and almost offensive, if there is no direct \r\nrelief for those who have less and who, without \r\nassistance, have no chance of breaking out of the \r\nvicious circle of poverty. \r\n Within the reforms to the Organization now being \r\ndebated, we should, in order more effectively to \r\naddress poverty in the world, give greater weight and \r\nauthority to the General Assembly to adopt measures of \r\nuniversal scope, not resolutions, repeated year after \r\nyear, with no binding power. \r\n Similarly, I should like to address the need to \r\nexpand the Security Council so that it truly represents \r\ntoday’s world and not the world as it was 60 years ago. \r\nNot to reform the Security Council would be \r\ndetrimental to its purposes. A Council that is not \r\nrepresentative cannot be as legitimate or effective. \r\nHowever, although there is consensus about the need to \r\nreform, how to reform has provoked more disunity than \r\nagreement. From Panama’s perspective, geographical \r\nrepresentation is an important factor to be considered, \r\nbut it cannot be the only one. A member of the Security \r\nCouncil does not sit on the Council to represent itself \r\nor the geographic region to which it belongs; it \r\nrepresents all Member States, which have entrusted it \r\nwith this responsibility because it has shown the \r\ncommitment and capacity to further the effort to \r\nmaintain international peace and security. \r\n It is time now to look at this topic with different \r\neyes. The facts that are developing continuously in the \r\nMiddle East, and the fact that terrorist attacks continue \r\nto occur throughout the world, show that it is crucial to \r\nstrengthen the Security Council as soon as possible \r\nthrough a process of reform that includes a moderate \r\nexpansion of the membership while the Council \r\nremains legitimate in the eyes of the rest of the \r\ninternational community. Strengthening the organs of \r\nthe United Nations, and more particularly the Security \r\nCouncil, will make it possible for events such as those \r\nin Lebanon to be met with a prompt and effective \r\nresponse. If the Organization had had the required \r\ninstruments to act robustly with legitimacy, we could \r\nhave put an early end to the confrontations; in fact, \r\nthey could have been avoided entirely if we had had an \r\nadequate preventive force. The rapid escalation of the \r\nconflict has highlighted the imperative need to resolve \r\nthe Middle East crisis so that Jews, Muslims and \r\nChristians can coexist in peace, as they do in Panama \r\nand many other parts of the world. \r\n There are tested ways to promote confidence \r\namong parties, to reconcile positions and to achieve \r\nconsensus. The use of arms can help some people to \r\ngain some short-term objectives but the atmosphere is \r\npoisoned and there cannot be peaceful coexistence \r\namong neighbours, families and peoples that \r\ngeography has placed so close to one another. It is \r\nobvious from every perspective that a solution to the \r\nconflict requires the immediate and unconditional \r\nwithdrawal of Israel from the occupied territories, \r\nestablishment of the Palestine State and recognition of \r\nIsrael’s right to exist as a State. All the countries in the \r\nregion must have sufficient guarantees that conflicts \r\nwill not be resolved through force and that no territory \r\ncan be used to attack a neighbour. Peace in the Middle \r\nEast has to be built by each and every State with the \r\nresolute support of the international community. \r\n Our vision is the same for other regions of the \r\nworld where a high degree of political tension still \r\nprevails and endangers the peace. Peaceful solutions \r\ncannot be postponed, for there is always the risk of \r\nviolent confrontations of unsuspected dimensions that \r\nwe will all deplore. \r\n I should like to draw attention to a significant \r\nevent that will take place in my country in the next few \r\nweeks and will have an impact on world trade. On \r\n22 October there will be a referendum to decide \r\nwhether the Panama Canal should be expanded. The \r\nhistoric and emotional dimension of the canal for the \r\nPanamanian people means that its expansion is the only \r\ndecision of the legislature and the Executive that needs \r\na referendum for confirmation. The Panama Canal \r\nlinks the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. It is therefore the \r\nbest route for the transport of goods between different \r\ncontinents, between two countries in the American \r\ncontinent, and even between two coasts in a single \r\ncountry. Five per cent of world maritime trade passes \r\nthrough the Panama Canal. The percentage varies from \r\none country to another: 3.5 per cent of an economy the \r\nsize of China’s; 16 per cent of the United States foreign \r\ntrade; and 35 per cent of Chile’s trade. The fact is that \r\nthe future of the Panama Canal affects the international \r\ncommunity as a whole. \r\n Only seven years ago the canal was run by the \r\nUnited States. After a long and complex negotiation \r\nthat included a special meeting of the Security Council \r\n A/61/PV.12\r\n \r\n5 06-52879 \r\n \r\nin Panama — one of only two times that that body has \r\nmet outside New York Headquarters — it reverted to \r\nPanama on the last day of the twentieth century. Since \r\nthen Panama has administered the canal with efficiency \r\nand safety, and it is now about to decide whether to \r\ntake the tremendous step of expanding the canal to \r\nenhance its capacity and allow larger ships to use it. \r\n The United Nations has always been involved in \r\nPanama’s fate, the fate of the canal. It was on the \r\nagenda when it was a continuing source of conflict \r\nbetween Panama and the United States. It supported the \r\nUniversal Congress on the canal in 1997 and finally it \r\nwelcomed the canal’s orderly transfer to Panamanian \r\njurisdiction. That is why Panama once again wishes to \r\ndraw the General Assembly’s attention to the canal and \r\nto reiterate its gratitude to the Non-Aligned Movement, \r\nbecause last week the Heads of State and Government \r\nadopted a declaration recognizing the efficient \r\nadministration of the Panama Canal and expressing \r\ntheir support for the initiative to expand its present \r\ncapacity. The canal is the most important resource for \r\nmy country’s development and is a valuable strategic \r\navenue at the service of trade and communications for \r\nthe entire world. \r\n In my country there is full awareness that our \r\ngeographic position is our major asset, but that its \r\nexploitation involves responsibilities towards the \r\ninternational community. That is why, while we \r\nwelcome international recognition of the manner in \r\nwhich we have been administering the canal, we also \r\nwish to tell the world body that the Panama Canal will \r\ncontinue to be managed so as to be efficient, neutral \r\nand safe, for the benefit of all ships in the world, flying \r\nevery flag. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Panama for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Martín Torrijos, President of the Republic of \r\nPanama, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mrs. Michelle Bachelet Jeria, President \r\nof the Republic of Chile \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Chile. \r\n Mrs. Michelle Bachelet Jeria, President of the \r\nRepublic of Chile, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations Her Excellency Mrs. Michelle Bachelet Jeria, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Chile, and to invite her to \r\naddress the Assembly. \r\n President Bachelet Jeria (spoke in Spanish): I \r\ncome before the General Assembly as the first woman \r\nto be elected President of Chile, a country that has \r\nlearned from its history. \r\n We Chileans are living through difficult times; \r\nthe Assembly knows this. The learning curve was \r\ndifficult but productive. From pain hope was born. \r\nMajor dissent gave way to major consensus. I come \r\nfrom a country where today the rule of law prevails, \r\nwhere the rights of persons are respected and \r\npromoted. It is a democracy that is experiencing \r\neconomic growth, which in the past 16 years has \r\nhelped millions of Chileans out of poverty. Chile \r\nstands with its region and looks at the world. My \r\npresence here today is a symbol of that Chile, a Chile \r\nthat is unafraid to look back at the past and is united in \r\nbuilding its own future. We can say with pride that \r\ntoday Chile is more free and more fair. As a society we \r\nhave granted every citizen the basic dignity and respect \r\nthat he or she deserves. \r\n The world looks different from the far distant \r\nsouth, and that is the viewpoint my country wishes to \r\nbring here, a viewpoint that is optimistic about the \r\nopportunities of globalization but cautious about its \r\nrisks. We can and must steer the course of the planet. \r\nHumans cannot and must not avoid being the \r\ninstruments of their own advancement. \r\n We wish to reaffirm our commitment to \r\ninternational law and institutions. Only through them \r\nshall we be able to build the fairer and more integrated \r\nworld of which we dream, where large and small \r\ncoexist in peace and harmony. The United Nations is a \r\nspecial instrument in this construction. A year ago we \r\nagreed on a programme for the reform of the \r\nOrganization based on development, security and \r\nhuman rights. This has been called the millennium of \r\nhope. Let us make that hope a reality and do so from \r\nhere, from this forum. \r\nA/61/PV.12  \r\n \r\n06-52879 6 \r\n \r\n Development is a responsibility shared by all \r\nmembers of the international community, including the \r\ndeveloped countries. Its attainment requires \r\nimagination and the political will to consolidate the \r\nworld alliance endorsed by the Millennium \r\nDeclaration. All this presupposes a more open, \r\ntransparent and fair commercial and financial system. \r\nTo our developed friends I say “Opening your markets \r\nto products from the south is a requirement of justice.” \r\nThat will represent a huge step forward towards the \r\nelimination of poverty. Let us therefore redouble our \r\nefforts to bring the Doha Round to a successful \r\nconclusion and make progress in integration processes \r\nat the regional level. \r\n As an early supporter of the idea of President \r\nLula of Brazil, Chile joined other countries in the \r\ninitiative Action against Hunger and Poverty. We have \r\nintroduced a solidarity tax of $2 on international airline \r\ntickets, and the funds produced will finance the \r\nInternational Drug Purchase Facility (UNITAID) \r\nproject, which will provide millions of quality drugs to \r\npeople in developing countries suffering from malaria, \r\ntuberculosis and AIDS. \r\n The most serious failure of the 2005 Summit was \r\nits silence on the multilateral disarmament agenda. \r\nChile bases its multilateral foreign policy on the \r\nprinciple that collective security is indivisible. We all \r\nshare a responsibility to preserve peace and \r\ninternational security. That is why Chile has joined in \r\nefforts to revitalize the disarmament agenda and move \r\ntowards prohibition of the use of fissile material for \r\nmilitary purposes. \r\n The security of States is linked to the security of \r\nthe human beings that make up those States, because it \r\nallows the exercise of freedom. Terrorism negates these \r\nfreedoms and runs counter to the values that we share. \r\nAccordingly, we support the advance of United Nations \r\nreform in the area of counter-terrorism. Terrorism must \r\nbe combated within democracy. Whenever we restrict \r\nconstitutional guarantees and yield to the temptation to \r\nemploy illegal methods to fight terrorism we are \r\nhanding a victory to its proponents, because it is only \r\nthen that they succeed in threatening the spirit of our \r\ndemocracy. \r\n In a spirit of solidarity we are participating \r\nactively in the United Nations Stabilization Mission in \r\nHaiti (MINUSTAH). Chile will continue to support the \r\nHaitian people, and I appeal from this rostrum to all \r\ndonor countries to provide the economic and financial \r\nassistance already pledged. \r\n The creation of the Peacebuilding Commission \r\nwas undoubtedly one of the most outstanding \r\nachievements of the 2005 Summit. Chile has joined \r\nenthusiastically in the work of the Commission and \r\nwill endeavour to ensure that its results live up to the \r\nhopes placed in it by nations. \r\n My country deplores the serious crisis affecting \r\nthe Middle East and strongly condemns any armed \r\naction targeting innocent civilians. Self-defence may \r\nbe exercised only within the framework of \r\nproportionality and containment outlined in \r\ninternational humanitarian law. The delay in the \r\nSecurity Council’s call for a ceasefire in Lebanon was \r\nalso inconsistent with the letter and spirit of the \r\nCharter. The credibility of the Organization requires \r\nthat all stakeholders do their duty without \r\ndiscrimination and without subordinating collective \r\nsecurity to their individual interests. \r\n Chile supports the deployment of the United \r\nNations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) with its \r\nexpanded mandate, and will continue to respond to the \r\nappeal to meet urgent humanitarian needs in Lebanon \r\nand Palestine. We urge full implementation of Security \r\nCouncil resolution 1701 (2006), which calls on the \r\ninternational community to cooperate in a full \r\ncessation of hostilities in the Middle East, the \r\nrestoration of Lebanon’s sovereignty over its territory \r\nand the guaranteeing of Israel’s security. \r\n The promotion and defence of human rights and \r\ndemocracy is the cornerstone of Chile’s foreign policy. \r\nAs I said at the outset, we have learned a great deal \r\nfrom our own history. Exactly 30 years ago the General \r\nAssembly received terrible news: Orlando Letelier, the \r\nformer Foreign Minister and Defence Minister of \r\nPresident Allende, had been brutally murdered on the \r\nstreet in Washington D.C. Representatives were \r\nhorrified by that crime and today I remember with \r\nemotion how we felt. I mention that to illustrate how \r\nwe have learned the lessons of the past. Nothing \r\njustifies the violation of human rights. Chile rejects \r\nimpunity. \r\n I assure all members of our commitment and \r\nenthusiasm to participate in initiatives designed to \r\npromote human rights and democracy. We therefore \r\nwelcome the launching of the United Nations \r\nDemocracy Fund and the creation of the Human Rights \r\n A/61/PV.12\r\n \r\n7 06-52879 \r\n \r\nCouncil. We very much value the Council’s adoption of \r\nthe International Convention for the Protection of All \r\nPersons from Enforced Disappearance. \r\n The promotion of human rights does not \r\ncontradict the principle of non-intervention in the \r\ninternal affairs of States. Chile has been, and will \r\nremain, in the front line in the defence of human rights. \r\n The General Assembly must continue United \r\nNations reform. It must revitalize itself, reform and \r\nexpand the Security Council, reform the Economic and \r\nSocial Council and modernize the management of the \r\nSecretariat and the administrative procedures of the \r\nOrganization. \r\n Allow me to reaffirm our hope in the United \r\nNations. As a woman, a doctor and the political leader \r\nof a developing country, today I ask that we choose \r\nlife, affirm justice, promote social justice and make \r\nthis noble Organization the common and continuing \r\nresponse to our peoples’ dreams of peace, development \r\nand dignity. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Chile for the statement she has just made. \r\n Mrs. Michelle Bachelet Jeria, President of the \r\nRepublic of Chile, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa, President of the \r\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Democratic Socialist \r\nRepublic of Sri Lanka. \r\n Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa, President of the \r\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, was \r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa, \r\nPresident of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri \r\nLanka, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Rajapaksa: On behalf of the \r\nGovernment and people of Sri Lanka I congratulate \r\nyou, Madam President, on your assumption of the high \r\noffice of the presidency of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-first session. I am happy to note that a lady from \r\na sister Asian country will guide us through the current \r\nsession. As Sri Lanka was the first country in the \r\nmodern world to elect a woman as Head  \r\nof Government — Prime Minister Sirimavo \r\nBandaranaike — your assumption of this high office is \r\nof special significance to us. To Mr. Jan Eliasson I \r\nconvey our gratitude for the leadership he provided \r\nduring the work of the sixtieth session. \r\n In 1970, when I was first elected to the \r\nParliament of Sri Lanka, a paragraph in the Preamble \r\nto the Charter of the United Nations gave substance \r\nand direction to my future political life. It was “to \r\nreaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the \r\ndignity and worth of the human person, in the equal \r\nrights of men and women and of nations large and \r\nsmall”. Having been a human rights campaigner at the \r\ngrassroots level throughout my political life, I found it \r\nnatural that my new Government should be committed \r\nto carrying the message of democracy to all corners of \r\nour multi-ethnic, multicultural and multi-religious \r\ncountry. “Democracy, equity and prosperity” is our \r\nclarion call. \r\n In addition, my country has been influenced by \r\nthe core Buddhist values of non-violence, loving \r\nkindness, compassion, equanimity and mindfulness. \r\nWith this sense of direction, our Government has \r\ncommitted itself “Towards a new Sri Lanka”, guided \r\nby a vision of peace, where every Sri Lankan citizen \r\nmay live with dignity and self-respect, in freedom and \r\nwithout fear, free of want, and where every child may \r\nenjoy childhood and grow up with hope and \r\nexpectation. \r\n However, Sri Lanka’s dream is threatened by a \r\nterrible affliction that impedes development, \r\nundermines democracy and challenges fundamental \r\nfreedoms. I refer to the bane of terrorism which \r\nconfronts my country and many other countries of the \r\nworld. I reaffirm my Government’s firm commitment \r\nto supporting all global efforts to combat terrorism \r\nwhenever and wherever it raises its ugly head. \r\nTerrorism has become closely intertwined with \r\norganized crime. It is now directly linked with people \r\nsmuggling, the trade in illicit drugs, the illegal trade in \r\nsmall arms and money-laundering. Terrorism is a major \r\nimpediment to development and poses a terrible \r\nchallenge to civilized society. We support all measures \r\nundertaken in the United Nations to meet this \r\nchallenge. We have ratified all United Nations \r\nconventions in this regard. \r\nA/61/PV.12  \r\n \r\n06-52879 8 \r\n \r\n In our capacity as Chair of the ad hoc committee \r\non measures to eliminate international terrorism we \r\nshall spare no effort to realize the international legal \r\nframework to facilitate our common struggle against \r\nterrorism. It is our fervent hope that the comprehensive \r\nconvention on international terrorism will soon become \r\na reality. \r\n The illicit trade in and trafficking of small arms \r\nand light weapons has contributed to the escalation of \r\nmany local conflicts because of the easy availability of \r\narms for non-State actors. Sri Lanka is concerned that, \r\ndespite the commitment of the international community \r\nto wipe out this menace, the impact at ground level \r\nthroughout the world is limited. We hope that the \r\nUnited Nations Plan of Action on this matter will be \r\nfully implemented and its scope further expanded in \r\nthe future. \r\n With regard to terrorism, I speak from personal \r\nexperience in my own country. Exploiting minority \r\nconcerns, which we are addressing politically, a \r\nruthless terrorist outfit in Sri Lanka, the LTTE, has \r\nbeen terrorizing our people for over two decades. In an \r\nage when the world seeks dialogue and peace, the \r\nLTTE devotes its full force to violence, suicide \r\nbombings, massacre of civilians, indiscriminate armed \r\nassaults and the conscription of young children for war. \r\nAssurances given to the Special Representative of the \r\nSecretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict on \r\nthe conscription of children for armed combat have \r\nbeen blatantly violated. \r\n At the presidential election in November last year \r\npeople in certain parts of Sri Lanka were cruelly \r\ndeprived of their freedom to vote. Furthermore, in an \r\nact of ethnic cleansing more than 60,000 Muslims were \r\nforcibly expelled from their homes in the north. \r\n Our Government believes that some of the \r\nconcerns of minorities in my country have deep roots. \r\nIn this connection I recall the following words in the \r\nConstitution of the United Nations Educational, \r\nScientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO): \r\n“since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the \r\nminds of men that the defences of peace must be \r\nconstructed”. \r\n Soon after my election, despite the violence \r\nunleashed by the terrorists, I expressed the conviction \r\nthat we needed to address the causes of the conflict \r\nfrom a fresh perspective and with a new approach to \r\ndevelop a sustainable solution. We examined this issue \r\nwith an open mind, and looked at every option with a \r\nview to evolving a national consensus to achieve an \r\nhonourable peace in an undivided country. A \r\nconsultative process is currently under way to prepare \r\nconstitutional proposals to address the concerns of the \r\nminorities. I have invited the LTTE to participate in the \r\nprocess of seeking a solution to the conflict through \r\ndialogue. \r\n As one of the oldest democracies in Asia, we are \r\nfirmly convinced that the restoration of democracy, the \r\ncreation of space for dissent, and the promotion of \r\nhuman rights in the conflict-affected areas are essential \r\nelements of a successful and sustainable process of \r\npeace. I hope that the international community will \r\ncontinue to extend to us its fullest support towards the \r\ntransformation of the LTTE into a democratic civilian \r\norganization. \r\n Our Government firmly believes that terrorism \r\ncannot be eliminated through military means alone. We \r\nremain fully committed to talking with the LTTE, \r\neither directly or through a facilitator. It is our hope \r\nthat the LTTE will transform itself from a terrorist \r\noutfit into one that is committed to dialogue and \r\ndemocracy. Our Government stands ready to respond to \r\nany display of good will and a move towards a non-\r\nviolent approach. \r\n We continue to take unilateral humanitarian \r\nmeasures, which extend even to terrorist cadres. As a \r\nresponsible Government we will continue to provide \r\nunhindered access to conflict-affected areas to the \r\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross, United \r\nNations agencies and other recognized humanitarian \r\nagencies. \r\n More than 53,000 Muslims were evicted from \r\ntheir homes by the terrorists following the recent \r\nviolence. They are the innocent victims of the LTTE’s \r\nruthless policies. Following Government counter-\r\nmeasures, almost all have now returned to their homes. \r\nThe Government has assumed responsibility to provide \r\nmedical supplies, food and other essential items to the \r\ninternally displaced persons living in the affected \r\nareas. \r\n I am pleased to state that, despite the conflict in \r\nour country, the economy of Sri Lanka continues to \r\ngrow at a commendable rate. In the first quarter of this \r\nyear we recorded growth of 8.1 per cent — the highest \r\nin 28 years. With our determination to further enhance \r\ngrowth with equity, we have adopted an economic \r\n A/61/PV.12\r\n \r\n9 06-52879 \r\n \r\nstrategy that will provide opportunities for all citizens, \r\nwhile giving adequate space to the private sector as the \r\nengine of growth. \r\n We continue to maintain the highest rating in \r\nSouth Asia on the Human Development Index. We \r\nhave already achieved some of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goal targets in primary school \r\nenrolment, gender equality and maternal and infant \r\nmortality rates. We hope that the increased economic \r\nopportunities in the country will further encourage the \r\nLTTE to opt for a negotiated peace. \r\n We follow a pro-poor development strategy, with \r\na focus on regionally balanced growth. Our objective is \r\nto achieve overall development while raising the \r\nincome levels of the poor through the empowerment of \r\ncommunities living at the grass-roots level. In this \r\nconnection, Sri Lanka hopes that debt forgiveness will \r\ncontinue to be expanded to encourage the development \r\nof developing countries. It is only right that those who \r\nreach the heights of development should pause to lend \r\na helping hand to those who have fallen behind due to \r\ncircumstances. \r\n I wish to acknowledge the role of President \r\nClinton, the United Nations Special Envoy for Tsunami \r\nRecovery, and the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, \r\nfor their assistance with tsunami-related support. I also \r\nacknowledge the support given by many other \r\ncountries. I am pleased to state that, despite being a \r\ndeveloping country, we are now well on the way to \r\nrecovery from this massive disaster, in many instances \r\nas a result of the efforts of our own people. We urge \r\nour development partners to stay involved with us in \r\nthis long-term effort. \r\n We in Sri Lanka see the United Nations as \r\nindispensable in creating a just and secure world order. \r\nWe, the 192 Members of the United Nations, must \r\ncontinue to have faith in our collective capacity to \r\nreform the United Nations so that it is made more \r\neffective and more relevant to the needs of its \r\nMembers in facing the challenges of the twenty-first \r\ncentury. \r\n We are pleased with several important measures \r\nthat have been adopted since the sixtieth session. Given \r\nmy personal commitment to the promotion of human \r\nrights at both the local and international level, the \r\nestablishment of the Human Rights Council, with \r\nenhanced status and capacity to promote and protect \r\nhuman rights worldwide, is a cause for delight. I am \r\nhappy that Sri Lanka was elected to the Council last \r\nMay. In honouring a pledge made during the \r\npresidential election last year, we have already started \r\nwork on crafting a human rights charter in Sri Lanka. \r\nConsistent with our goal of safeguarding human rights, \r\nmy Government will establish an international panel to \r\nobserve investigations into certain alleged human \r\nrights violations that my Government has already \r\ncondemned. \r\n The establishment of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission is another important landmark \r\nachievement of the United Nations this year. We are \r\npleased that Sri Lanka has been elected to its \r\norganizing Committee as a founder member of that \r\nimportant body. The needs and concerns of those \r\naffected, the specific theatres of conflict, and the \r\nrealities on the ground of each specific situation must \r\nnecessarily be taken into account in the Commission’s \r\nwork. \r\n We are also encouraged by the general agreement \r\nthat the Security Council must be strengthened, as it \r\ndoes not reflect current geopolitical realities. We \r\ntherefore look forward to the continuation of work \r\ntowards Security Council reform, towards making its \r\ncomposition more representative and its decision-\r\nmaking more democratic. It is essential that the \r\nSecurity Council reflect the current geopolitical \r\nrealities in Asia, Africa and Latin America. \r\n For long years now, on the basis of our \r\ncommitment to human rights and dignity, we have had \r\na lasting interest in seeing the emergence of peace in \r\nthe Middle East. Recognition of the rights of the \r\nPalestinian people is of concern to me and to my \r\ncountry. Many Sri Lankans have in recent years made \r\nthe Middle East their temporary home. We are pained \r\nby the recent escalation of violence in that region and \r\nthe devastation in Lebanon. It is our sincere hope that \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1701 (2006) will pave the \r\nway for peace and security for Lebanon and the region. \r\n The Preamble to the Charter requires that we \r\n“unite our strength to maintain international peace and \r\nsecurity”. Let us all, Members of the United Nations, \r\nfocus sharply on this commitment. Let us dedicate \r\nourselves to its realization and let us mobilize our \r\ncollective energies towards the achievement of peace \r\nand security worldwide. \r\n Let us make peace the goal of the present decade. \r\nLet us all unite for peace. May all living beings be free \r\nA/61/PV.12  \r\n \r\n06-52879 10 \r\n \r\nof suffering, be healthy and be prosperous. May the \r\nblessings of the Noble Triple Gem be with you all. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the \r\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa, President of the \r\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, was \r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Hugo Chávez Frías, President of the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela. \r\n Mr. Hugo Chávez Frías, President of the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela, was escorted \r\ninto the General Assembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Hugo Chávez Frías, \r\nPresident of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, and \r\nto invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Chávez Frías (spoke in Spanish): First \r\nI very respectfully invite all those who have not done \r\nso to read the book that I am holding, one of the most \r\nrecent by Noam Chomsky, who is among the most \r\nprestigious American and world intellectuals. The \r\nbook, “Hegemony or Survival: America’s Quest for \r\nGlobal Dominance”, is an excellent work to help us \r\nunderstand what happened in the world of the twentieth \r\ncentury and what is happening now, which is the \r\ngreatest threat looming over our planet: the \r\nhegemonistic claims of American imperialism, which \r\nthreaten the very survival of the human species. We \r\ncontinue to warn about this danger and to appeal to the \r\npeople of the United States and the world to halt this \r\nthreat, which is like the sword of Damocles hanging \r\nover our heads. \r\n I had considered reading a chapter from the book, \r\nbut to save time I shall confine myself to a \r\nrecommendation. The book is very good, an easy read. \r\nI am sure, Madam President, that you are familiar with \r\nit. It is published in English, German, Russian and \r\nArabic. The first people who should read it are our \r\nbrothers and sisters in the United States, because the \r\nthreat is in their own house. The Devil is there; the \r\nDevil himself is in the house. \r\n The Devil came here yesterday, right here. It still \r\nsmells of sulphur today. Yesterday on this rostrum the \r\nPresident of the United States, whom I refer to as the \r\nDevil, talked as if he owned the world. It would be \r\nappropriate to have a psychiatrist analyse yesterday’s \r\naddress by the President of the United States. As the \r\nspokesman of imperialism he came to share his \r\nprescriptions for preserving the current pattern of \r\ndomination, exploitation and pillage of the peoples of \r\nthe world. It was like an Alfred Hitchcock movie. I \r\nwould even propose a title: “The Devil’s Recipe”. \r\n As Chomsky says here clearly and in depth, \r\nAmerican imperialism is doing all it can to consolidate \r\nits hegemonistic system of domination. We cannot \r\nallow it to do that. We cannot allow the establishment \r\nand consolidation of world dictatorship. The address of \r\nthe world tyrant, cynical and full of hypocrisy, shows \r\nthe imperialists’ intention to control everything. They \r\nsay that they want to impose a democratic model, but it \r\nis the democratic model of their own conception: the \r\nfalse democracy of elites, and furthermore an original \r\ndemocratic model imposed by bombs, bombardments \r\nand invasions. What a strange democracy! It would be \r\nnecessary to revise the ideas of Aristotle and the other \r\nGreek pioneers of democracy in the face of this model, \r\nimposed by marines, invasions, aggression and bombs. \r\n The President of the United States told us \r\nyesterday in this Hall, “everywhere you turn you hear \r\nextremists who tell you that you can escape your \r\nmisery and retain your dignity through violence and \r\nterror and martyrdom.” (see A/61/PV.10). Wherever he \r\nlooks he sees extremists, and when he looks at your \r\ncolour, my brother, he thinks “You are an extremist”. \r\nMr. Evo Morales Aima, the worthy President of \r\nBolivia, looks like an extremist to him. The \r\nimperialists see extremists everywhere. \r\n No, it is not that we are extremists. What is \r\nhappening is that the world is waking up and people \r\neverywhere are rising up. I tell the world dictator “I \r\nhave a feeling that the rest of your days will be a living \r\nnightmare, because everywhere you will see us rising \r\nup against American imperialism, demanding freedom, \r\nequality of peoples and respect for the sovereignty of \r\nnations.” Yes, we may be described as extremists, but \r\nwe are rising against the empire, against the model of \r\ndomination. \r\n A/61/PV.12\r\n \r\n11 06-52879 \r\n \r\n The President also said, “I would like to speak \r\ndirectly to the people across the … Middle East: my \r\ncountry desires peace.” That is true. If we walk through \r\nthe streets of the Bronx, New York, Washington, San \r\nDiego, California, San Antonio and San Francisco — \r\nanywhere in the United States — and speak to \r\nindividual citizens, we shall find that the country does \r\nwant peace. The difference is that the Government of \r\nthe United States does not. It wants to impose its \r\nsystem of exploitation and pillage and its hegemony \r\nthrough war. If it wants peace, what is happening in \r\nIraq? What happened in Lebanon and Palestine? What \r\nhas happened over the past hundred years in Latin \r\nAmerica and in world? Now there are new threats \r\nagainst Venezuela and Iran. \r\n The President spoke to the people of Lebanon, \r\nsaying “Many of you have seen your homes and \r\ncommunities caught in crossfire.” What cynicism! \r\nWhat a capacity to lie shamelessly! Was it crossfire \r\nwhen bombs were dropped on Beirut with millimetric \r\nprecision? He was thinking of a Western, where men \r\nshoot from the hip and somebody gets caught in the \r\ncrossfire. This was imperialist fire, fascist fire, the fire \r\nof an assassin, the genocidal firing of the empire and \r\nIsrael on the innocent people of Palestine and Lebanon. \r\nThat is the truth. \r\n Now it is said that we are suffering because we \r\nsee homes destroyed. Early this morning I was looking \r\nat some statements in preparing my remarks, and I \r\nhave brought with me a document in which I note that \r\nthe President of the United States came to talk to the \r\npeoples. He said “To the people of Afghanistan”, “To \r\nthe people of Lebanon”, “To the people of Iran”. He \r\naddressed them all directly. One wonders what those \r\npeoples would tell him if they were given the \r\nopportunity. What would they have to say? I know \r\nwhat is in the soul of the peoples of the south, the \r\noppressed peoples. They would say “Yankee \r\nimperialist, go home!” That would be the cry of the \r\npeoples of the world if they could speak with one voice \r\nto the American imperialists. \r\n That is why last year when I came to this Hall, as \r\nI have been doing for the past eight years, I said \r\nsomething that has now been fully confirmed. Hardly \r\nanybody here can defend the United Nations system. \r\nLet us be honest and accept that the system born after \r\nthe Second World War has collapsed. It is worthless. It \r\nis true that it serves to bring us together once a year to \r\nmeet, make statements, prepare long documents, reflect \r\nand listen to good speeches like those yesterday by \r\nPresident Evo and President Lula and the ones we have \r\njust heard from the President of Sri Lanka and the \r\nPresident of Chile. But the Assembly has been turned \r\ninto a merely deliberative organ, with no power to \r\nmake any impact on the terrible situation in the world. \r\n That is why Venezuela once again proposes here \r\ntoday, 20 September, that we re-establish the United \r\nNations. Last year we made four modest proposals that \r\nwe felt were crucially important for discussion by \r\nheads of State and Government, ambassadors and \r\nrepresentatives. \r\n The first — President Lula said this yesterday — \r\nis the expansion of both the permanent and non-\r\npermanent membership of the Security Council, with \r\ndeveloped and under-developed countries of the third \r\nworld as new permanent members. That is the first \r\nstep. \r\n Secondly, there must be effective methods to \r\naddress and resolve world conflicts, with transparent \r\ndebate and decision-making. \r\n Thirdly, it is essential that, as everyone demands, \r\nthere be an immediate end to the anti-democratic \r\nmechanism of the veto that is exercised when decisions \r\nare made in the Security Council. Let me give a recent \r\nexample. The immoral veto of the United States, \r\nblocking a resolution, allowed the Israeli forces to \r\ndestroy Lebanon with impunity before our very eyes. \r\n Fourthly, as we have always said, the role and \r\npowers of the Secretary-General must be strengthened. \r\nYesterday the Secretary-General practically gave us his \r\nfarewell speech. He recognized that in the past 10 \r\nyears serious world problems such as hunger, poverty, \r\nviolence and human rights violations had worsened and \r\nbecome more complicated. That is a terrible \r\nconsequence of the collapse of the United Nations \r\nsystem and American hegemonistic pretensions. \r\n A few years ago Venezuela decided to wage this \r\nbattle within the United Nations, recognizing the \r\nUnited Nations, as Members, and lending it our voice \r\nand our thinking. Our voice is an independent one \r\nrepresenting dignity, the search for truth and the \r\nreformulation of the international system, with \r\ndenunciation of persecution and of the aggression of \r\nhegemonistic forces against peoples of the planet. \r\n That is how Venezuela, the homeland of Bolivar, \r\ncame to put itself forward for a non-permanent seat on \r\nA/61/PV.12  \r\n \r\n06-52879 12 \r\n \r\nthe Security Council. The United States Government \r\nlaunched open, immoral aggression throughout the \r\nworld to try to prevent Venezuela being freely elected \r\nto a seat on the Security Council. The empire is afraid \r\nof the truth, of independent voices. It calls us \r\nextremists, but it is the extremist. \r\n I should like to thank all those countries that have \r\nannounced their support for Venezuela even though the \r\nballot is secret and there is no need to make an \r\nannouncement. I believe that the open attack by the \r\nUnited States empire has increased the support of many \r\ncountries, and that support strengthens the morale of \r\nVenezuela, our people and Government. Our brothers \r\nin the Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR), \r\nfor example, have expressed their support as a bloc. \r\nWith Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, as well \r\nas many other Latin American countries, such as \r\nBolivia, Venezuela is now a full member of \r\nMERCOSUR. The Caribbean Community has \r\nexpressed its support for Venezuela, as has the Arab \r\nLeague. I am immensely grateful to our Arab and \r\nCaribbean brothers. The African Union, almost all of \r\nAfrica, has expressed support for Venezuela, as have \r\ncountries such as Russia, China and many others. \r\n On behalf of Venezuela and its people, and of the \r\ntruth, I thank them all most warmly. With a seat on the \r\nSecurity Council, Venezuela will make not only its \r\nvoice but that of the third world and all peoples heard \r\nthroughout the world. We will defend dignity and truth. \r\n Over and above all this, there are reasons to be \r\noptimistic — a poet would say “hopelessly optimistic”. \r\nBeyond the threats, the bombs, the wars, aggression, \r\npreventive war and the destruction of entire peoples, \r\nwe can see that a new era is dawning. As Silvio \r\nRodriguez sings, “the era is giving birth to a heart”. \r\nNew trends are developing, alternative ways of \r\nthinking, alternative movements. Young people think \r\ndifferently. As has been shown in scarcely a decade, \r\nthe idea of the end of history has been shown to be \r\ntotally false, as has that of the Pax Americana and the \r\nestablishment of the capitalist neo-liberal model, which \r\ncreates poverty and is rejected. \r\n Now we must define the future of the world. The \r\ndawn is breaking all over: Latin America, Africa, \r\nEurope and Oceania. I want to emphasize that \r\noptimistic vision, so that we may strengthen our will \r\nand our readiness to fight to save the world and build a \r\nnew and better world. \r\n Venezuela joins that struggle, and that is why we \r\nare threatened. The United States has already planned, \r\nfinanced and set in motion a coup in Venezuela, and it \r\ncontinues to support coup attempts and terrorism there. \r\nPresident Michelle Bachelet Jeria reminded us a short \r\ntime ago of the horrendous assassination of the former \r\nChilean Foreign Minister, Orlando Letelier. I would \r\nsimply add that those who perpetrated that crime, in \r\nwhich an American citizen also died, are free. And they \r\nare Americans themselves, CIA terrorists. \r\n We should also recall that in a few days there will \r\nbe another anniversary: 30 years will have passed since \r\nanother horrendous terrorist act, the destruction of an \r\nairliner of Cubana de Aviación in which 73 innocent \r\npeople died. Where is the biggest terrorist of this \r\ncontinent, who masterminded the blowing up of the \r\nplane? He spent a few years in prison in Venezuela, but \r\nthanks to the CIA and Venezuelan Government \r\nofficials at the time he was able to escape. Now he \r\nlives in the United States, protected by the \r\nGovernment. He confessed and was convicted of his \r\ncrime, but the United States Government has double \r\nstandards and protects terrorism when it wants to. I say \r\nthis to make the point that Venezuela is fully \r\ncommitted to combating terrorism and violence, and \r\njoins those peoples that are fighting for peace and a \r\nworld of equals. \r\n I have just spoken of the Cuban airliner. Luis \r\nPosada Carriles is the name of the terrorist concerned. \r\nHe is protected here, as are very corrupt people who \r\nhave fled Venezuela. A group of terrorists bombed \r\nvarious embassies and assassinated people. During the \r\nattempted coup they kidnapped me and were going to \r\nshoot me. But God intervened, as did a group of loyal \r\nsoldiers and the people, who took to the streets. So by \r\na miracle I am here today. The leaders of that \r\nattempted coup and those terrorist acts are living in this \r\ncountry today, protected by the United States \r\nGovernment. I accuse the American Government of \r\nprotecting terrorists and of holding a completely \r\ncynical discourse. \r\n I mentioned Cuba. I was very recently in Havana \r\nfor a few days, and I left it feeling happy because the \r\nbirth of a new era could be seen. The Non-Aligned \r\nMovement summit adopted a historic final document. \r\nDo not worry; I shall not read it out. It contains a set of \r\nresolutions adopted after open and transparent debate. \r\nMore than 50 heads of State attended, and Havana was \r\nthe capital of the south for a week. \r\n A/61/PV.12\r\n \r\n13 06-52879 \r\n \r\n We have now relaunched the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement. If there is anything I could ask of all those \r\nhere, my partners and brothers and sisters, it is that \r\nthey lend their good will to strengthen the Non-\r\nAligned Movement, which is important for the birth of \r\nthe new era and the prevention of hegemony and \r\nimperialism. The Assembly will know that we elected \r\nPresident Fidel Castro Chairman of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement for the next three years, and we can trust \r\nhim to lead us very efficiently. Those who hoped that \r\nFidel would die were disappointed, and they will \r\ncontinue to be disappointed, because he is back in his \r\nolive-green fatigues and is now not only President of \r\nCuba but Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement. A \r\nvery strong movement has been born: that of the South. \r\nWe are men and women of the South. \r\n With these documents, ideas, criticisms and \r\nreflections, I am now closing my file and taking the \r\nbook with me. Do not forget that I recommend it very \r\nwarmly and very humbly to all those present. I have \r\ntried to put forward ideas to save our planet, to save it \r\nfrom the imperialist threat. I hope that in this century, \r\nin the not too distant future, we shall see our children \r\nand grandchildren living better, in a world of peace \r\nbased on the fundamental principles of the United \r\nNations — a renewed and relocated United Nations. I \r\nbelieve that it must move to another country, to a city \r\nof the South. That is what we in Venezuela have \r\nproposed. The Assembly knows that my personal \r\ndoctor and chief of security had to stay on a locked \r\nplane. Neither was allowed to come to the United \r\nNations. This abuse we regard as a personal insult by \r\nthe Devil. It smells of sulphur here, but God is with us, \r\nand I embrace you all. May God bless us all. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I thank the President of the Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela for his statement. \r\n Mr. Hugo Chávez Frías, President of the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela, was escorted \r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, President \r\nof the Republic of Maldives \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Maldives. \r\n Mr. Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, President of the \r\nRepublic of Maldives, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Maldives, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly. \r\n President Gayoom (spoke in Dhivehi; English \r\ntext provided by the delegation): The United Nations \r\ntoday is at a crossroads. It needs to become part of the \r\ntwenty-first century, and it must do so with great \r\nurgency. It needs to gear itself to become an institution \r\ncapable of taking on the serious challenges that \r\nconfront the international community. \r\n As we address these tasks, your election, Madam \r\nPresident, to preside over the sixty-first session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly is a tribute to your wisdom and \r\nskill. It is also a compliment to your great country. I \r\ntake this opportunity to congratulate you. At the same \r\ntime, it gives me pleasure to express appreciation to \r\nMr. Jan Eliasson, who presided so ably over the \r\nsixtieth session. Today, as the United Nations \r\napproaches the end of one era and the beginning of \r\nanother, the Maldives expresses its profound \r\nappreciation to the outgoing Secretary-General, Mr. \r\nKofi Annan. He has led the Organization for a decade, \r\nwith great devotion and skill. \r\n Modernization should be a top priority for any \r\norganization that wants to remain relevant in a time of \r\nrapid change. It is particularly important for the United \r\nNations because of the central role that it must \r\ncontinue to play in promoting cooperation for \r\ninternational peace and security, economic and social \r\ndevelopment, human rights and the rule of law. The \r\nMaldives believes that reform of the United Nations \r\nmust be transparent, balanced, comprehensive and \r\ninclusive. \r\n In addition to modernizing the Security Council, \r\nwe must strengthen the General Assembly and the \r\nEconomic and Social Council. These reforms must \r\nmake the Organization more action-oriented and \r\ndemocratic. A reformed United Nations must be \r\nresponsive to the entire membership, and be faithful to \r\nits founding principles. The Organization must be \r\nadapted to carry out its mandate in full. There can be \r\nno doubt that this can be achieved by gearing the \r\nUnited Nations to implement all its mandates, \r\ndecisions and resolutions without fear or favour. \r\n The question of equitable representation and an \r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council is a \r\nA/61/PV.12  \r\n \r\n06-52879 14 \r\n \r\ncrucial part of the reform process. The Maldives \r\nbelieves the membership of the Council must reflect \r\nthe realities of the present day. In this regard, the \r\nMaldives reiterates its support for the proposal of the \r\ngroup of four on Security Council reform. \r\n For the Maldives the next few years will be a \r\ncrucial period in our national development. As a result \r\nof national efforts made with the support of the \r\ninternational community, the Maldives is today set to \r\nsay goodbye to its least developed country status. The \r\nthree-year smooth transition period will begin in \r\nJanuary 2008. Graduation from the least developed \r\ncountry list will pose numerous challenges to us. \r\n However, we look forward to that event as a \r\npositive development. We have already begun work \r\nwith the donor community to identify ways in which \r\nthe economic and social progress of the country will \r\ncontinue without disruption after graduation. In this \r\nregard, I note the successful launching of the Maldives \r\nPartnership Forum as an annual event. The first such \r\nforum was held in June this year. I wish to thank our \r\ndonors for their continued commitment to support the \r\ndevelopment of the Maldives beyond graduation. \r\n The graduation of the Maldives from least \r\ndeveloped country status to that of a developing \r\ncountry coincides with an important political phase in \r\nthe country’s development. Over the past three years \r\nwe have been engaged in a major political \r\ntransformation. These reforms are based on the \r\nsustained social and economic progress that has \r\nqualified the Maldives for graduation. The political \r\nreform programme that we began in 2003 covers \r\ninstitutionalizing political pluralism and strengthening \r\nhuman rights protection, media freedom and judicial \r\nreform. \r\n The achievements of the programme to date \r\ninclude the formation of four political parties last year, \r\nstrengthening the fundamental rights of the people and \r\nenhancing the rule of law. Also a constitutional \r\nassembly is in session to modernize the constitution. \r\nOther projects are being implemented to overhaul the \r\ncriminal justice system, set up a modern police service, \r\nstrengthen media freedom and develop civil society. \r\n We are also determined to meet the standards \r\nprescribed in international human rights treaties. Over \r\nthe past two years we have acceded to the Convention \r\nagainst Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading \r\nTreatment or Punishment and its Optional Protocol. We \r\nhave also acceded to the Optional Protocol to the \r\nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of \r\nDiscrimination against Women. Just yesterday I \r\ndeposited with the Secretary-General our instruments \r\nof accession to the International Covenant on Civil and \r\nPolitical Rights and its Optional Protocol and to the \r\nInternational Covenant on Economic, Social and \r\nCultural Rights. \r\n The Maldives was the country worst affected by \r\nthe 2004 tsunami. Twenty-one months into the \r\nrecovery programme, much has been achieved, but \r\nmuch remains to be done. I take this opportunity to \r\nthank the donor community and friendly countries for \r\nthe support and assistance extended to our recovery \r\nprogramme. The biggest obstacle to the programme is \r\nthe substantial funding shortfall in key aspects of \r\nrecovery, in particular in the areas of repair and \r\nreconstruction of housing, transportation, water and \r\nsanitation, and environmental mitigation. The funding \r\ngap is estimated at $100 million. In addition, as a result \r\nof the impact of the tsunami and of high petroleum \r\nprices on public finances, there is a budget deficit of \r\n$100 million. At this critical juncture of our national \r\nprogress I call upon our development partners, and the \r\ninternational community as a whole, to continue to \r\nassist the Maldives. \r\n It is a matter of satisfaction to us that, despite the \r\ndevastation caused by the tsunami and the short-term \r\nfiscal pressures, the Maldives has been able to meet \r\nsome international development targets. In reducing \r\npoverty and in providing primary education the \r\nMaldives has already met the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. We are confident that we can attain the targets \r\nfor health care and gender empowerment. \r\n Instability in any part of the world has \r\nimplications for the entire international community. \r\nOne of the most intractable disputes of our time is the \r\nconflict in the Middle East, particularly the non-\r\nrealization of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian \r\npeople. The recent hostilities in Lebanon and the \r\nsufferings of the Lebanese people have their roots in \r\nthe Palestinian problem. The Palestinian issue must be \r\nresolved, in accordance with international law and the \r\nrelevant resolutions of the Security Council. \r\n The continued instability and violence in \r\nAfghanistan and Iraq is a matter of great concern to the \r\nMaldives. Years of instability and conflict have \r\n A/61/PV.12\r\n \r\n15 06-52879 \r\n \r\nravaged the lives and society of the peoples of these \r\ncountries. \r\n The Maldives fully subscribes to the efforts made \r\nby the international community to combat terrorism. \r\nWe are party to the major international conventions \r\nthat have been formulated to defeat terrorism. \r\nTerrorism is an assault on the values of freedom and \r\nhuman solidarity. However, our efforts to combat the \r\nmenace should avoid undermining the very values that \r\nwe seek to protect. There is a resurgence of the \r\nvilification of Islam and Muslims. As the Maldives has \r\nbeen a 100 per cent Muslim nation for more than 850 \r\nyears, we are dismayed by this trend. Islam has \r\nprovided the basis for peace and social harmony in the \r\nMaldives. Islam preaches moderation, not extremism. \r\nViolence and killing are abhorrent to Islam. The Holy \r\nKoran states, “Take not life, which Allah hath made \r\nsacred, except by way of justice and law.” (The Holy \r\nKoran, VI:151) \r\n Needless to say, we are deeply pained and \r\noutraged by the negative imaging of Islam and the \r\neffort to associate fanaticism and violence with our \r\npeace-loving faith. The Holy Koran says, “Allah \r\ncommands justice, the doing of good, and liberality to \r\nkith and kin, and He forbids all shameful deeds, and \r\ninjustice and rebellion.” (ibid. XVI:90) \r\n Only love can conquer hatred. Knowledge alone \r\ncan overcome prejudice. Tolerance can defeat fear. \r\nStable peace requires inclusion. Effective and \r\nmeaningful dialogue among civilizations and mutual \r\nrespect among diverse peoples are necessary to address \r\nthe challenges that we face today. Tolerance and \r\nrespect for diversity are given a high value in Islam. \r\n Civilization is under serious threat from the \r\ncontinued degradation of the environment and its \r\nresultant effects of global warming, climate change and \r\nsea-level rise. Small island States such as the Maldives \r\nand other low-lying regions of the world are in the \r\nfront line of danger from rising seas. The extreme \r\nweather events of the past few years have been more \r\nfrequent and destructive than ever before. They clearly \r\ndemonstrate that the entire world is vulnerable to the \r\ndevastation caused by climate change. The Kyoto \r\nProtocol has been a great disappointment. We call upon \r\nall countries to accelerate the adoption of urgent and \r\nrealistic measures to stop climate change and sea-level \r\nrise. \r\n If we are to address the vast array of challenges \r\nthat humanity faces today we must effectively \r\nimplement crucial blueprints and action programmes \r\nagreed through the multilateral process. We must \r\nbreathe new life into Agenda 21. We must also adhere \r\nto the Monterrey Consensus. The Millennium \r\nDeclaration must be followed up diligently. And, as \r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan said earlier this month, \r\nthe United Nations must move from a culture of \r\nreaction to one of prevention. \r\n Today I am speaking in my vernacular language, \r\nDhivehi. It represents the legacy of several \r\nmillenniums of continuous settlement and the culture \r\nthat it has produced in the Maldives. Is not the \r\nprotection of such legacies the touchstone of success of \r\nthis global family of nations? If the United Nations can \r\nmake small and vulnerable countries feel safe, then \r\nwho will be facing any danger at all? \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Maldives for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, President of the \r\nRepublic of Maldives, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Romano Prodi, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Italy \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear a \r\nstatement by the Prime Minister of the Republic of \r\nItaly. \r\n Mr. Romano Prodi, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Italy, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The President: I have pleasure in welcoming His \r\nExcellency Mr. Romano Prodi, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Italy, and inviting him to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n Mr. Prodi (Italy) (spoke in Italian; English text \r\nprovided by the delegation): I wish to offer you my \r\ncongratulations, Madam President, on your election to \r\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nfirst session. Your experience in international affairs is \r\nthe best guarantee of the success of your term. At the \r\nsame time I express to your predecessor, Mr. Jan \r\nEliasson, our sincere thanks for his effective and \r\nA/61/PV.12  \r\n \r\n06-52879 16 \r\n \r\nbalanced leadership of the sixtieth session. My special \r\nappreciation goes also to Kofi Annan for having \r\ndedicated his life to the Organization, particularly in \r\nthe past 10 years as Secretary-General, leading it \r\nthrough difficult challenges and laying the groundwork \r\nfor its reform. Thank you, Kofi. \r\n It was in this city on 11 September five years ago \r\nthat the dramatic realization was forced upon us of just \r\nhow dangerous the world has become. On that day we \r\nknew that the new millennium would hold \r\nunpredictable and complex threats extending beyond \r\nnational borders; global threats against which notions \r\nof protection inside national borders are illusory; \r\nasymmetrical threats that are difficult to counter \r\neffectively with the instruments previously used to \r\nsettle conflicts. \r\n Terrorism and weapons of mass destruction have \r\nchanged traditional society and its values. They have \r\nrendered obsolete systems of collective defence and \r\nsecurity based on deterrence. The old solutions to the \r\nworld’s problems — the logic of balance and \r\nhegemony — are no longer enough to guarantee \r\nstability and security. These new threats add a new \r\nelement to a list that includes regional conflicts in the \r\nMiddle East, Asia and Africa; pandemics; problems of \r\ndevelopment and the gap between North and South; \r\nhuman rights abuses; mass migrations; and issues \r\nconcerning energy and the environment. These are \r\nphenomena that it is also impossible to resolve without \r\na collective assumption of responsibility. \r\n If we wish to govern these phenomena we need to \r\nbe equal to their dimensions. No country, however \r\nstrong and powerful, can take on such complex \r\nchallenges single-handedly. Global threats demand a \r\nglobal response. In the final analysis, this means \r\ncollective partnership. To have chosen as the theme of \r\nthe sixty-first session “Implementing a global \r\npartnership for development” was thus particularly \r\nappropriate. Without collective action by the countries \r\nin the northern and southern hemispheres, international \r\norganizations and institutions, the public and private \r\nsector and civil society, it will be impossible to achieve \r\nthe goals we have set. \r\n First and foremost we need to reinvigorate \r\nmultilateralism, by which I mean above all restoring \r\nthe central, fundamental role of the United Nations. \r\nThe recent experience in Lebanon and the \r\nstrengthening of the United Nations Interim Force in \r\nLebanon (UNIFIL) is one example of how the United \r\nNations can regain its crucial importance in the \r\nresolution of international controversies. Above all, it \r\ndemonstrates — and this is the key point — that if the \r\nstakeholders are willing to confer upon the United \r\nNations a strong, central role, the Organization is well \r\nable to fulfil it. \r\n In Lebanon we are still at square one, and much \r\nremains to be done. To underestimate the risk of this \r\nmission would be a serious mistake. We must, \r\nhowever, be pleased with how the United Nations, its \r\nMember States and — allow me to add — the \r\nEuropean Union have addressed a situation that only \r\ntwo months ago risked getting out of hand, but which \r\ntoday presents a series of opportunities for the Middle \r\nEast as a whole. We should be pleased to have set up a \r\nmission that represents the entire international \r\ncommunity, a tangible expression of the very global \r\npartnership that we are discussing today. For, while it \r\nis true that Europe provides the backbone of UNIFIL, \r\nit cannot carry out its mission effectively without the \r\ncontributions of China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, \r\nRussia, Turkey and the many other non-European \r\ncountries participating. \r\n The question we must ask at this point is this: \r\nwhat do we need to do in order to continue the work \r\njust begun in Lebanon? More generally, in view of the \r\ncrises and emergencies that surround us, what does the \r\nUnited Nations need in order to fulfil the principles of \r\nthe Charter? It needs two things: first, quick \r\ncompletion of the reforms, and, secondly, the strong \r\nand unconditional support of its Members. \r\n On the issue of reform, last year, after an intense \r\nseries of negotiations, a moment of summary allowed \r\nus to lay the groundwork for giving the United Nations \r\na more incisive role, to the benefit of the international \r\ncommunity. The Peacebuilding Commission is the first \r\nmajor result, because it highlights the indestructible \r\nbond between development, security and human rights. \r\nA priority commitment to human rights and their \r\nsafeguarding should be the goal of any country that \r\nwishes to lend greater ethical authority to its foreign \r\npolicy. The results achieved by the reform on this \r\npoint, through the establishment of the new Human \r\nRights Council, are still being examined. The other \r\nsignificant outcome is the affirmation of the principle \r\nof the responsibility to protect, so that the international \r\ncommunity will no longer be indifferent to acts of \r\ngenocide. \r\n A/61/PV.12\r\n \r\n17 06-52879 \r\n \r\n But it is on the General Assembly and the \r\nSecurity Council that we must focus our attention, by \r\nrestoring the central role of the General Assembly as \r\nthe main decision-making, representative and policy-\r\nmaking body of the United Nations; and by renewing \r\nefforts to reform the Security Council, in terms both of \r\nits working methods and its composition. In the current \r\nsituation Member States thus need to send a strong \r\npolitical signal that will help us to begin a new chapter \r\nand open the way to an innovative approach. \r\n In other words, we need to enter a period of \r\nnegotiation which has thus far eluded us, a period in \r\nwhich, rather than seeking to impose positions and \r\nmodels, we can undertake a true comparison of \r\npositions for the purpose of achieving solutions that are \r\nnot divisive but, rather, enable the widest possible \r\nconsensus. But a word of caution: everything is \r\nnegotiable except for the ownership of the \r\nOrganization by the Member States, by all of us, an \r\nownership that represents the true pillar on which \r\nUnited Nations multilateralism must rest. \r\n Another way for the United Nations to regain the \r\nforcefulness and credibility it needs to fulfil its mission \r\nis by strengthening the role of its great regional \r\nstakeholders. I am thinking first of the European \r\nUnion, because if Europe is stronger the United \r\nNations will be stronger. The world and the United \r\nNations do not need a Europe that hesitates. Rather, \r\nthey need a Europe that is able to play its part in \r\nmeeting the challenges that await us. Europe, in turn, \r\nmust become more aware that only by contributing to \r\nthe resolution of global tensions can it give greater \r\nsecurity and prosperity to its citizens. \r\n The conditions for performing this role are there. \r\nThe numbers alone make the European Union a global \r\nactor — 25 countries with a total population of more \r\nthan 450 million, representing one fourth of the world’s \r\ngross domestic product and every month allocating \r\n€500 million to third countries. Yet these numbers do \r\nnot correspond to a comparable ability for the \r\nEuropean Union to make a difference outside its own \r\nborders. \r\n In the work of the Assembly and its various \r\ncommittees, the European Union is becoming a key \r\nactor. At every debate and on every resolution its \r\nposition represents a point of reference in shaping the \r\nattitudes of the other regional groups. Our goal should \r\nbe to acquire a similar ability within the Security \r\nCouncil. It may be a slow process, which will have to \r\ntake into account points of resistance and stubborn \r\nlegacies, but it should be pursued with determination. \r\nOnly if Europe wields a more incisive influence on the \r\nissues of peace and security can it be considered a true \r\nglobal actor. The Balkan tragedies in the early 1990s \r\nwere the result of an absent Europe. But when it is \r\npresent, and when it is united, Europe can make the \r\ndifference. That is what we are seeing in the Lebanese \r\ncrisis. During the sixty-first session of the General \r\nAssembly, and in the course of its biennium in the \r\nSecurity Council, Italy will make a special effort to \r\nincrease the commitment and role of the European \r\nUnion at the United Nations. \r\n Our aim is to make the Organization more \r\neffective in the areas and on the issues in which, by \r\nhistory and vocation, it can provide the most added \r\nvalue. The proliferation of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction, in particular nuclear weapons, has to be \r\nseen today in the context, above all, of the negotiation \r\nunder way with Iran. But it is our duty to look further \r\nahead and to strive, all together, to consolidate the \r\ngeneral non-proliferation system. That principle will \r\ninspire the action of Italy when it enters the Security \r\nCouncil. \r\n With regard to the Iranian nuclear file, we are \r\nready to make our contribution to a negotiated solution \r\nthat promotes regional security and stability. \r\n In the Middle East, as I mentioned earlier, we \r\nneed to seize our opportunities and openings , aware \r\nthat there will be no peace until the Palestinian \r\nquestion has been resolved, with an independent, \r\nsovereign, vital and contiguous Palestinian state next to \r\nthe state of Israel, and both within secure and \r\ninternationally recognized borders. \r\n That grave regional crisis should not lead us to \r\nforget Africa — long suffering, prey to ongoing crises, \r\nand even poorer than it was two decades ago. The \r\nsituation in Darfur is critical. We cannot stand by and \r\nwatch, for the simple reason that time has run out. We \r\nneed to act quickly and strive for a gradual assumption \r\nof responsibility by the United Nations, in compliance \r\nwith the decisions of the Security Council. The \r\nsituation in the Horn of Africa is also a source of \r\nconcern. Here a strong commitment is required from \r\nthe Security Council, where, starting on 1 January \r\n2007, Italy will make its contribution also, on the basis \r\nof its experience in the region. When I speak of Africa, \r\nA/61/PV.12  \r\n \r\n06-52879 18 \r\n \r\nI mean primarily the gap between the northern and \r\nsouthern hemispheres, the phenomenon at the root of \r\nalmost all the ills afflicting our era. It is that gap, \r\nabove all, that causes the massive migratory flows that \r\nwe cannot ignore and that we must address with \r\nrealism, responsibility, equanimity, and especially \r\nsolidarity. \r\n In the Mediterranean we are working with our \r\npartners to address immigration on the basis of those \r\nprinciples, and seeking to facilitate legal flows and to \r\ncounter both the illegal flows and the parties that profit \r\nfrom them, seeking to facilitate the integration into our \r\ncountries of those who have immigrated legally, filled \r\nwith hope and the desire to work. \r\n But there is another dangerous gap that risks \r\nleaving an even deeper gash in the world. I am \r\nreferring to what until a few years ago was called a \r\nclash of civilizations and religions between the \r\nChristian and Islamic worlds. I refuse to believe that \r\nsuch a clash exists. Extremists and fanatics do exist, \r\nbut civilizations and religions were made for the sake \r\nof dialogue, exchange and mutual enrichment. We can \r\npromote, and we want to promote, this relationship by \r\nbuilding new policies to bring us closer to the countries \r\non the southern shores of the Mediterranean, with the \r\ngoal of making that sea a basin of peace and \r\nharmonious coexistence among diverse civilizations \r\nand religions. \r\n Let me return to the central issue of this session, \r\nthe global partnership for development, in order to \r\nclarify one point. There is a risk that the reinvigoration \r\nof multilateralism, United Nations reform, and a \r\ncollective commitment to the various theatres of crisis \r\nwill produce no lasting effect unless development \r\nissues are treated as priorities. It is up to the United \r\nNations as the driving force, the glue of solidarity \r\namong peoples, and the fullest expression of \r\nmultilateralism, to keep development at the top of the \r\ninternational agenda. For it is in the connection \r\nbetween security, solidarity and development that the \r\nadded value of the United Nations lies, in the full \r\nawareness that there can be no peace without \r\ndevelopment and no development without peace. \r\n It is not enough to enunciate at this rostrum, as \r\nspeakers have been doing for six years now, the words \r\n“Millennium Development Goals”. We must get to \r\nwork and carry them out, starting with the adoption of \r\nthe financial, trade, technological and environmental \r\nsteps required and aiming for a very specific, ambitious \r\ngoal that responds above all to a moral duty: to \r\nguarantee a dignified life for every human being. \r\n I wish to conclude with a few considerations on \r\nthe fundamental principles and values that inspire our \r\naction when we deal with multilateralism, the search \r\nfor peace, security and development, and north-south \r\nrelations. All these issues coalesce in a defence of life \r\nand struggle against all forms of hatred, violence, \r\ndiscrimination and marginalization, undeniable values \r\nthat, together with democratic principles, are the \r\nfoundations of coexistence among peoples and should \r\ninspire the action of the world’s nations. Today, sadly, \r\nthese values are still denied and trampled upon, as if \r\nwe had learned nothing from the horrors of the past. \r\nWe cannot sit by watching indifferently in the face of \r\nbarbarous acts. We are for peace and solidarity. We are \r\nagainst the death penalty, injustice and human \r\nsuffering. That is something we must always \r\nremember, especially on the eve of major decisions. \r\nThat is what is expected of us from those who \r\nsacrificed their lives for peace, for a righteous cause, \r\nfor an ideal, to defend freedom, the same freedom that \r\nwe enjoy every day in a democracy. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Italy for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Romano Prodi, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Italy, was escorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Milo Djukanović, President of the \r\nGovernment of the Republic of Montenegro \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear a \r\nstatement by the President of the Government of the \r\nRepublic of Montenegro. \r\n Mr. Milo Djukanović, President of the \r\nGovernment of the Republic of Montenegro, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum. \r\n The President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Milo Djukanović, \r\nPresident of the Government of the Republic of \r\nMontenegro, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Mr. Djukanović (Montenegro) (spoke in \r\nMontenegran; English text provided by the delegation): \r\nAllow me first to welcome your election, Madam, to \r\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\n A/61/PV.12\r\n \r\n19 06-52879 \r\n \r\nfirst session, confident that it will result in important \r\ndecisions in the common interest. \r\n It is with particular pride and emotion that I wish \r\nto recall the sixtieth session, during which many \r\ndecisions, important for the Organization, were made. \r\nIn Montenegro it will be remembered as historic since \r\nit was at that session that our nation was admitted as a \r\nfully fledged Member of this unique world \r\norganization. I wish therefore to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the President of the sixtieth session,  \r\nMr. Eliasson, and the other representatives of nations \r\nin this forum for having contributed to making the \r\nceremony of Montenegro’s admission as the 192nd \r\nMember State of the United Nations so uplifting. \r\n It is a great honour and pleasure at this session to \r\nrepresent Montenegro which for the first time now \r\nparticipates in the debate as a fully-fledged Member. \r\nAs the President of Montenegro, Filip Vujanović, has \r\nalready stressed from this rostrum, we see this as a \r\nhuge chance, as well as a huge responsibility. \r\nMontenegro is a young European nation that has \r\nexisted on its own on the international scene for only a \r\nfew months, but it is firmly determined to continue \r\nwith even more strength to contribute to peace, \r\nstability and prosperity, by respecting and promoting \r\nthe underlying ideas, principles and goals of the United \r\nNations and its documents. I am strongly convinced \r\nthat in the time in which we live the importance of a \r\nState, big or small, primarily depends on its \r\ncontribution to the respect for and implementation of \r\nthese fundamental international values and standards. \r\nThis is relevant in both a regional and a broader \r\ncontext. \r\n It is in the nature of small States to be more \r\nsensitive to the need for tolerance and dialogue, for \r\nopenness, and international relations based on mutual \r\ntrust, equality and solidarity, and also to the value of \r\nunity in diversity, which is the axiom of this time, and \r\nof global integration, the basis on which today’s \r\nMontenegro is developing. In this sense I would add \r\nthat small nations are destined to be elitist. I hope that \r\nit is not presumptuous to say that Montenegro \r\npromoted these principles best in the recent referendum \r\nthat we organized in full partnership with the European \r\nUnion, the Organization for Security and Cooperation \r\nin Europe, and the Council of Europe, proving that \r\neven in south-eastern Europe the most difficult and \r\nmost sensitive issues — such as the status issue — can \r\nbe tackled in a democratic fashion and in accordance \r\nwith the highest international standards. We are \r\ntherefore proud to stress that the democratic process \r\nand outcome of the Montenegrin referendum is also a \r\nEuropean policy victory in our region, and are \r\nconfident that through this example we can contribute \r\nto stability and good-neighbourly relations in our \r\nregion. \r\n Indeed, regional cooperation is inseparable from \r\nEuropean and global integration, which are essentially \r\nabout issues of peace, stability, security and prosperity, \r\nthe more so as the globalization that is gaining \r\nmomentum confronts us with new challenges and new \r\nthreats of a political, environmental and socio-\r\neconomic nature. The issues of today, such as \r\ninternational terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of \r\nmass destruction, illegal migration and trafficking, \r\npoverty, threats to the environment, and so forth, \r\nhighlight the need for common action. \r\n This vision of the future is exemplified in the \r\nMillennium Declaration, which projects the principles \r\nand goals of the Charter to the world in a new age, \r\nhighlighting common responsibility and solidarity in \r\norder to accomplish a vision of a more secure, \r\nprosperous and just world. Without stability there is no \r\ndemocracy, just as without democracy there is no \r\nstability or sustainable economic development. These \r\nare interdependent processes that must take place \r\nsimultaneously, and that highlights the importance of \r\naccomplishing the Millennium Goals. All this brings to \r\nthe fore the importance of efficient multilateralism \r\nthrough action by the United Nations, which needs to \r\nbe reformed in order to adequately cope with today’s \r\nchallenges, as well as other international and regional \r\norganizations and all nations. \r\n With full awareness and responsibility we will \r\ncontinue to build in Montenegro stable institutions that \r\nguarantee the rule of law, freedoms, equality and non-\r\ndiscrimination, human and minority rights as well as \r\nsolidarity and a market economy. We will also continue \r\nto promote multi-ethnic harmony and tolerance, \r\nconvinced that religious and cultural diversity is \r\nenriching and conducive to greater stability and \r\ngrowth. It is also conducive to striking a balance \r\nbetween the State and the individual, fully in \r\naccordance with the principles of sustainable \r\ndevelopment. \r\n In this context I wish to express my gratitude to \r\nthe specialized United Nations agencies for their \r\nA/61/PV.12  \r\n \r\n06-52879 20 \r\n \r\nefforts and support. I believe it is important to stress \r\nfrom this rostrum that in partnership with the United \r\nNations Development Programme and our European \r\npartners we will build the first eco-building designed to \r\nhouse United Nations agencies operating in \r\nMontenegro. \r\n We are very proud that at the very outset of life \r\non its own Montenegro was admitted to the United \r\nNations, the institution that is the meeting point for a \r\nmultitude of cultures and identities, which it merges \r\ninto one address that each and every one of us \r\nidentifies with, an institution in which all peoples and \r\nStates enjoy full equality. We see this as historic proof \r\nof acknowledgement of respect for the fundamental \r\nvalues and goals of the United Nations, still equally \r\nvalid today. I am confident that Montenegro will \r\ndistinguish itself even more as a trustworthy and \r\nconstructive partner and that our cooperation within the \r\nUnited Nations will take on a new quality and will \r\nremain a key component of the political action of \r\nMontenegro. Today’s Montenegro has a clear vision of \r\ndevelopment and of its European perspective, and is \r\nready to fully contribute to a united Europe and the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the \r\nGovernment of the Republic of Montenegro for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Milo Djukanović, President of the \r\nGovernment of the Republic of Montenegro, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\nAddress by Sir Michael Somare, Prime Minister of \r\nPapua New Guinea \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear a \r\nstatement by the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea. \r\n Sir Michael T. Somare, Prime Minister of Papua \r\nNew Guinea, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency, Sir Michael Somare, Prime \r\nMinister of Papua New Guinea, and inviting him to \r\naddress the General Assembly. \r\n Sir Michael T. Somare (Papua New Guinea): I \r\nwish to convey Papua New Guinea’s congratulations to \r\nyou, Madam President, on your election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \r\nsession. I assure you of my country’s full cooperation \r\nduring your presidency. We compliment your \r\npredecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, for his stewardship of \r\nour work during his tenure. We also congratulate him \r\non his appointment as Sweden’s Foreign Minister and \r\nwish him well. \r\n On 10 October 1975, 24 days after Papua New \r\nGuinea attained political independence, I stood at this \r\nvery rostrum and addressed the Assembly with a lot of \r\nhope and expectations. Like many developing countries \r\ncoming out from the colonial yoke, Papua New Guinea \r\ncommitted itself to the principles and purposes of the \r\nUnited Nations. I said: “I state our fundamental \r\ncommitment to the maintenance of peace throughout \r\nour world and our undertaking to uphold the principles \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations Organization.” \r\n We believed that the United Nations was the most \r\nappropriate body to achieve our aspirations of \r\nmeaningful economic development, respect for our \r\nsovereignty and the attainment of a peaceful and secure \r\nworld. The harsh reality today is that these aspirations \r\nremain largely unfulfilled for many of us. Our record \r\nwill indicate lost opportunities to realize the promise of \r\na better world. \r\n Our world today is marked by an inequitable \r\nglobal trading order and a hostile security environment. \r\nWanton globalization and unfettered trade \r\nliberalization are affecting many of us in ways that are \r\ndetrimental to the livelihood of our people. Unilateral \r\nactions by the big and powerful to resolve disputes are \r\nno longer incidental, but are the order of the day. We \r\nnote the increasing incidence of human atrocities, \r\ngenocides, wars, poverty, terrorism, the emergence of \r\nHIV/AIDS, and an increase in malaria and \r\ntuberculosis. Our streets and communities are littered \r\nwith small arms and light weapons. The smuggling of \r\ndrugs and humans and other illegal activities are on the \r\nrise. Environmental degradation and climate change \r\ncontinue unabated. We must confront these issues \r\nurgently. To complement efforts in other forums, Papua \r\nNew Guinea, with other countries of the Pacific region, \r\nhas agreed to pool its limited resources under the \r\nPacific plan to address these issues. \r\n Papua New Guinea continues to believe that the \r\nUnited Nations offers the best hope for its Member \r\nStates to address these ongoing concerns and other \r\nemerging challenges facing humanity today. In this \r\nregard, my country supports the ongoing United \r\nNations reform initiatives that seek to make its \r\n A/61/PV.12\r\n \r\n21 06-52879 \r\n \r\noperations more effective and responsive. We must \r\nensure that its collective security mandates and \r\nfunctions, and its various organizations, are \r\nstrengthened and not weakened. We are pleased to note \r\nthe establishment of the Human Rights Council and \r\nPeacebuilding Commission. Papua New Guinea \r\nbelieves in a revitalized General Assembly whose role \r\nand authority reflect its broad membership. We must \r\npress on with the reform of the Security Council with \r\ncourage and boldness so that it reflects the political and \r\neconomic realities of today. An expanded Security \r\nCouncil must be more democratic and transparent. Its \r\nmembership must include developing countries, while \r\nmaintaining geographic balance and representation. \r\n Global trade today is characterized more by the \r\nunfair practices of those already holding decided \r\nadvantages than by the opportunities it offers to \r\ndeveloping countries such as Papua New Guinea. Our \r\nefforts to develop a more equitable trading order are \r\nhampered by the reluctance of our developed partners \r\nto open their economies and engage in genuine \r\ndevelopment discussions. Adding insult to injury, many \r\nof our developed partners have yet to meet the targets \r\nthey agreed with respect to Official Development \r\nAssistance. \r\n While we appreciate the efforts of some of our \r\ndeveloped partners to ease the burden of debt under the \r\nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, we are \r\ndisappointed that many of them have not shown the \r\nsame leadership on the Doha Development Round, \r\nleading to its collapse. We are calling for developing \r\ncountries to join us in framing a new and true \r\ndevelopment round. We must exercise leadership rather \r\nthan passively allowing others to chart our future. \r\n Despite these difficulties, Papua New Guinea is \r\npursuing economic development programmes that are \r\nbased on an export-driven economic growth strategy. \r\nAt the heart of this policy objective is the focus on \r\nrural development. We have developed a five-year \r\nmedium-term development strategy and aligned it with \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. Achieving those \r\ngoals by 2015 is a tremendous challenge for Papua \r\nNew Guinea but we have taken the first step in \r\nproviding budget funding for its implementation. We \r\ncall for the support of the United Nations system and \r\nother genuine development partners to meet these vital \r\ncommitments. \r\n As a result of better policy coordination, stricter \r\nimplementation of structural reform and prudent \r\nfinancial and economic management, Papua New \r\nGuinea has attained macroeconomic and fiscal \r\nstability. Our economy is growing, interest rates have \r\nfallen, and the exchange rate has been stabilized. Our \r\nforeign exchange reserves are at an all-time high. We \r\nare using these gains to reinvest in productive sectors \r\nof our economy and in delivering services to our \r\npeople. Development partners must play a supportive \r\nrole to sustain these gains. This can be done through \r\nfair trade opportunities, equitable markets, increased \r\nforeign investment, transfer of technology, capacity-\r\nbuilding and providing quality overseas development \r\nassistance. \r\n I now turn to an issue about which my country \r\nfeels strongly, that of climate change and sea-level rise. \r\nFor us this is not academic, it is reality. Small islands \r\nand low-lying atolls in Papua New Guinea and the \r\nPacific region are being submerged by rising sea \r\nlevels. As I speak, my own people are being resettled \r\nto higher ground. Papua New Guinea’s strong position \r\non the environment is drawn from the preamble to our \r\nnational Constitution, which states: \r\n “We declare our fourth goal to be for Papua New \r\nGuinea’s natural resources and environment to be \r\nconserved and used for the collective benefit of \r\nus all, and be replenished for the benefit of future \r\ngenerations.” \r\nThat constitutional imperative underpins my country’s \r\nwhole approach to sustainable development objectives, \r\nincluding those contained in the Johannesburg Plan of \r\nImplementation and the Mauritius Strategy. \r\n Environmental degradation is occurring at a \r\nfrightening pace. Scientific studies suggest that climate \r\nchange is causing increasing incidences of \r\nenvironmental catastrophes such as hurricanes, \r\ntsunamis, landslides and flash floods. Our planet is in \r\ndistress. As co-inhabitants of this world we must all \r\nequally share responsibility to address the root causes \r\nof this problem. We urge industrialized countries to \r\nreduce their greenhouse gas emissions. We call upon \r\nthose that have not yet done so to accede to and ratify \r\nthe Kyoto Protocol. \r\n Papua New Guinea is prepared to play its part to \r\nprotect and conserve the world’s tropical rainforest \r\nwith the aim of stabilizing the earth’s climate. The \r\nfindings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \r\nA/61/PV.12  \r\n \r\n06-52879 22 \r\n \r\nChange suggest that an estimated 20 per cent to 25 per \r\ncent of annual global emissions were generated \r\nthrough land-use change, primarily from the \r\ndegradation of forest resources. In this context it is \r\ncrucial for us to protect the tropical rainforests through \r\nsustainable and fair market-based incentives. \r\n The dilemma is that for some of us the forestry \r\nsector is a major revenue earner, a provider of much-\r\nneeded employment, a facilitator of important \r\ninfrastructure projects, and a catalyst for the provision \r\nof basic services in rural areas. The present incentives \r\noffered by international markets for agriculture, \r\nforestry and emissions reductions are inadequate. \r\nThese are perverse incentives from the standpoint of \r\nthe environment. Papua New Guinea, along with Costa \r\nRica, has formed a new Coalition for Rainforest \r\nNations that includes many other countries in Africa, \r\nAsia, Latin America and the Pacific. Together we are \r\npursuing an initiative to access global carbon markets \r\nand to support efforts to reduce rates of deforestation. \r\nSimply put, this approach seeks to recognize the \r\ncontribution of resource owners to conserving and \r\nprotecting rainforests for the benefit of mankind. We \r\ninvite more nations to join our efforts to create new \r\nmarkets and reform outmoded market and regulatory \r\nmechanisms. That is necessary if we are to contribute \r\nmore effectively towards environmental sustainability, \r\neconomic development, climate stability and poverty \r\nreduction. \r\n The initiative on deforestation is part of a broader \r\nagenda being pursued by my Government to implement \r\nthe Millennium Development Goal to ensure \r\nenvironmental sustainability. We are convinced that by \r\nimplementing the seventh goal we will harness our \r\nability to achieve environmentally and socially \r\nsustainable economic growth. Many times developing \r\ncountries are drawn into false promises of international \r\ninvestment. Often we find our natural resources \r\nexploited, leaving us with neither the resource nor the \r\nmoney. We will not allow this to continue. We want \r\nwealth from our natural resources to remain within our \r\nnations to fuel our economic growth. \r\n The threat of HIV/AIDS is real in many of our \r\ncountries and has serious implications for social and \r\neconomic development. In Papua New Guinea my \r\nGovernment has passed HIV/AIDS legislation, \r\nunderpinned by a comprehensive HIV/AIDS policy \r\nframework. To ensure close scrutiny I have vested my \r\ndepartment with the responsibility of overseeing \r\nimplementation. In addition, I have appointed a special \r\nminister to assist me in providing political leadership \r\non this particular issue. But our experience suggests \r\nthat national action alone is not enough. It requires a \r\nconcerted global response. This is a war that must be \r\nwaged on all fronts and by all countries. We thank the \r\nUnited Nations and its related agencies for their efforts \r\nto address this issue. We also applaud the bold \r\nleadership of former United States President Mr. Bill \r\nClinton and of Mr. Bill Gates in this regard. \r\n Of equal importance are the battles against \r\nmalaria, tuberculosis and other preventable diseases. \r\nWhile we, as a global community, have focused on \r\nHIV/AIDS and bird flu, this has diluted our attention to \r\nmalaria, which remains the biggest killer disease in my \r\ncountry. I call upon our development partners to \r\nsupport Papua New Guinea and other countries in \r\nmaintaining perspective on these challenges. \r\n Terrorism in all its forms and manifestations is a \r\nserious threat to international peace and security. It \r\nmust be condemned irrespective of who perpetrates it. \r\nAll countries and peoples of the world have a serious \r\nresponsibility to stand united and fight this evil. \r\nHowever, Papua New Guinea is concerned about the \r\nerosion of the international community’s moral \r\nauthority to address this issue. It is unhelpful to our \r\ncredibility if certain of our members choose to address \r\nthis issue in flagrant violation of international norms \r\nand universally agreed conventions. As with other \r\ncross-border challenges, Member States will require \r\nthe support of the United Nations and development \r\npartners with capacity-building and other necessary \r\nresources to effectively fight global terrorism. \r\n The conflict in the Middle East, despite various \r\nUnited Nations resolutions, remains unresolved. Papua \r\nNew Guinea appeals to all parties to the conflict, \r\nincluding those Powers with the capacity to influence a \r\npositive outcome, to make the hard concessions \r\nnecessary for a peaceful resolution of this long-\r\nstanding issue. The recent confrontation in Lebanon \r\nresulted in the loss of innocent lives and massive \r\ndestruction to infrastructure. Papua New Guinea \r\nappeals for restraint by all parties and urges that full \r\nuse be made of the dispute settlement procedures of the \r\nUnited Nations. Comprehensive and lasting solutions \r\nmust be found to the issues that led to the conflict. \r\nNeighbouring countries and the international \r\ncommunity as a whole can make positive contributions \r\nby shepherding a process that allows for genuine \r\n A/61/PV.12\r\n \r\n23 06-52879 \r\n \r\ndialogue to take place. We commend the United \r\nNations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and \r\nEuropean countries such as France, Italy and Germany \r\nand others that are contributing troops to maintain the \r\nceasefire. \r\n Papua New Guinea is extremely concerned about \r\nthe proliferation among States of nuclear, chemical, \r\nbiological and other weapons of mass destruction. We \r\ncontinue to maintain that there is no real justification \r\nfor the retention and further development of these \r\ninstruments of war. We call upon all countries to ratify \r\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and other \r\nrelated treaties to reduce the threat to international \r\npeace and security by weapons of mass destruction. \r\nSadly, we were reminded by the Secretary-General \r\nyesterday of the apathy that surrounds actions on non-\r\nproliferation and disarmament. \r\n The work of the United Nations Special \r\nCommittee on Decolonization remains unfinished. We \r\nstill have 16 non-self-governing territories, some in the \r\nPacific, that are yet to exercise their right to self-\r\ndetermination. The referendum in Tokelau \r\ndemonstrated a true spirit of cooperation between \r\nTokelau and New Zealand. We congratulate both \r\nGovernments and assure the people of Tokelau of our \r\nrespect for their decision to remain in free association \r\nwith New Zealand. \r\n I conclude by saying that the world has changed \r\nin ways that not only provide opportunities, but also \r\noffer more complex challenges for Members of the \r\nUnited Nations. The emergence of a trend over the \r\nyears to try to resolve these challenges outside the \r\nprinciples and framework prescribed by the United \r\nNations has resulted in a world worse than the founders \r\nof the Organization envisaged. We must renew our \r\ncommitment and faith in the United Nations and seek \r\nto reform it in ways that reflect the realities of today. \r\n At this juncture I take the opportunity to pay a \r\nspecial tribute to the outgoing Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Kofi Annan, for his outstanding contribution to the \r\nUnited Nations and the world. We wish him well. As \r\nthis is likely to be the last General Assembly session in \r\nwhich I take part, I take this opportunity to thank all \r\nthose who have contributed in one way or another in \r\nsupport of Papua New Guinea since independence. \r\nWhen I brought my nation to take its seat in this \r\nAssembly 31 years ago I said, and I reaffirm today, that \r\nwithin the limits of our resources Papua New Guinea \r\nwill play an active and positive role in the United \r\nNations. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of Papua \r\nNew Guinea for the statement he has just made. \r\n Sir Michael T. Somare, Prime Minister of Papua \r\nNew Guinea, was escorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Esteban Lazo Hernández, Vice-\r\nPresident of the Republic of Cuba \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Vice-President of the Republic of Cuba. \r\n Mr. Esteban Lazo Hernández, Vice-President of \r\nthe Republic of Cuba, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have great pleasure in welcoming to the \r\nUnited Nations His Excellency Mr. Esteban Lazo \r\nHernández, Vice-President of the Republic of Cuba, \r\nand inviting him to address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Lazo Hernández (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nAs President Hugo Chávez said in his brilliant \r\nstatement, only four days ago the Fourteenth Summit \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement, held in Cuba, \r\nconcluded. Today I speak on behalf of the Movement’s \r\nChairman, President Fidel Castro, fulfilling our \r\nobligation to inform the Assembly of the main \r\ndecisions agreed at the summit conference in Havana. \r\n As First Vice-President of the Council of State \r\nand Minister of the Republic of Cuba, Raúl Castro, \r\nsaid in his opening speech: \r\n “The current international situation, characterized \r\nby the one super-Power’s irrational attempts to \r\ncontrol the world, aided by its allies, shows that \r\nwe need to be increasingly united in defence of \r\nthe principles and purposes upon which the Non-\r\nAligned Movement was established, which are \r\nthose enshrined in international law and the \r\nCharter of the United Nations.” \r\n While the founding of the Movement was \r\nnecessary more than four decades ago, its continued \r\nrelevance in today’s world is beyond doubt. The \r\nsummit held in Cuba was an indisputable success, in \r\nspite of the threats and pressures of those who oppose \r\nthe unity and common efforts of the countries of the \r\nsouth. The summit saw high levels of participation, in \r\nA/61/PV.12  \r\n \r\n06-52879 24 \r\n \r\nterms both of the number of countries attending the \r\nconference and of the attendance of heads of State or \r\nGovernment. Profound and fruitful debates were held \r\nin an atmosphere of true understanding, unity and \r\ncohesion, which allowed for the adoption of documents \r\nof crucial importance to the role of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement. \r\n As the new Chairman, Cuba was given clear \r\nmandates and an action programme that will govern its \r\nactivities as head of the Movement. As a result of the \r\nsummit, the Non-Aligned Movement has been \r\nstrengthened and consequently so has the political \r\nunity of the countries of the South. The diverse and \r\nheterogeneous nature of the Movement’s membership, \r\nfar from weakening it, constitutes its essential strength. \r\nThese features have allowed for the creation of solid \r\nconsensus that will be a positive contribution to our \r\nefforts to overcome the many and serious challenges \r\nhumanity faces today. The commendable work of \r\nMalaysia as the Movement’s Chairman over the past \r\nthree years was acknowledged at the Summit. There \r\nwas no cause or demand by a country of the south \r\nwhich was not duly considered or which did not meet \r\nwith the support of the Movement. \r\n Progress in the defence of multilateralism, \r\ndemanding respect for the sovereignty and territorial \r\nintegrity of all States, and ensuring the full realization \r\nof our peoples’ right to development and peace were \r\nratified at the Summit as the Movement’s principles, \r\nwhose implementation was urgently needed. The Heads \r\nof State or Government decided to work to suppress \r\nacts of aggression or other actions contrary to the \r\npreservation of peace and to encourage the peaceful \r\nsettlement of international disputes. \r\n The summit called on all nations to abstain from \r\nthe use of force or from threatening to use force against \r\nthe territorial integrity or independence of any State. \r\nParticipating nations promoted the development of \r\nrelations of friendship based on respect for the \r\nprinciple of equal rights and the will of all peoples to \r\nstruggle against foreign occupation. They urged nations \r\nto extend international cooperation with a view to \r\novercoming the serious economic, social, cultural and \r\nhumanitarian challenges that face the world and to \r\npromoting respect for the human rights and \r\nfundamental liberties of all for the benefit of all. The \r\nfundamental and inalienable right of all peoples to self-\r\ndetermination was reaffirmed in Havana. The non-\r\naligned countries agreed that world peace and security \r\nare today more imperilled than ever as a result, among \r\nother factors, of the growing trend of the most \r\npowerful States to resort to unilateral measures and to \r\nthe threat of pre-emptive wars. \r\n The Movement’s commitment to general and \r\ncomplete disarmament, and nuclear disarmament in \r\nparticular, under strict and efficient international \r\nmonitoring, was underscored. The summit also \r\nreaffirmed the basic and inalienable right of all States \r\nto research, develop, produce and use nuclear energy \r\nfor peaceful purposes and to be free from any kind of \r\ndiscrimination in this connection, in conformity with \r\ntheir respective international obligations. Similarly, the \r\nsummit clearly and firmly pronounced itself to be \r\nagainst terrorism, double standards in international \r\nrelations, coercive unilateral measures against any \r\nnation, regime-change policies, and the failure of \r\ndeveloped countries to fulfil their commitments in \r\neconomic and social areas.  \r\n The heads of State or Government reaffirmed \r\ntheir hope to live in a peaceful world in which all \r\nnations have the right to a better future and a fair and \r\nequitable world order based on the sustainable \r\ndevelopment of all nations. They affirmed that in its \r\ncurrent form globalization perpetuates and even \r\nexacerbates the marginalization of the countries of the \r\nsouth and demanded that it be radically transformed \r\ninto a positive force for change for the benefit of all \r\npeoples. \r\n The participants reaffirmed the right of the \r\nPalestinian people to have their own State, and \r\ncondemned the Government of Israel for the new wave \r\nof crimes and massacres in Gaza and other occupied \r\nterritories. They also vigorously condemned Israel’s \r\nmerciless acts of aggression against Lebanon and the \r\nserious violations of that nation’s sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity. \r\n The people and Government of Bolivia, facing \r\nattempts to destabilize the country instigated by \r\nexternal forces, received a gesture of support and \r\nsolidarity from the summit. The process under way in \r\nthat sister nation, aimed at guaranteeing the real rights \r\nof all Bolivians and at securing full national control \r\nover the country’s natural resources, was offered solid \r\nsupport. \r\n The Movement considered with great concern the \r\naggressive policies and intensification of action aimed \r\nat undermining the stability of the Bolivarian Republic \r\n A/61/PV.12\r\n \r\n25 06-52879 \r\n \r\nof Venezuela and expressed support for the inalienable \r\nright of the Venezuelan people to determine its form of \r\ngovernment and choose its economic, political and \r\nsocial system, free from foreign intervention, \r\nsubversion, coercion or restrictions of any kind. The \r\nnon-aligned undertook to promote and participate in a \r\ntrue process of democratization and reform of the \r\nUnited Nations so as to leave behind the anti-\r\ndemocratic impositions and practices of the Security \r\nCouncil and to give the General Assembly its due \r\ndecisive role, in conformity with the roles and powers \r\ndescribed in the United Nations Charter.  \r\n I have mentioned only a few examples of the \r\npositions adopted at the summit held in Havana with \r\nrespect to the most diverse issues on the international \r\nagenda. The documents adopted will be officially \r\ndistributed to all United Nations Member States. A \r\nnumber of the decisions adopted at the summit will \r\nsoon be put into practice at this session of the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Cuba is aware of the immense responsibility \r\ninherent in presiding over the Non-Aligned Movement \r\nat one of the most difficult times in human history, \r\nwhen we face more inequality and injustice than ever \r\nbefore. We shall not rest in our efforts to have the \r\nMovement occupy the place it can and must occupy in \r\nthe international arena, in keeping with not only its \r\nbroad membership of 118 countries — nearly two \r\nthirds of the membership of the United Nations — but \r\nalso its history of acting on behalf of the loftiest \r\ncauses. \r\n Inaugurating the Sixth Summit of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement in Havana 27 years ago, President \r\nFidel Castro said: \r\n “The struggle for peace and for a just economic \r\norder and a workable solution to the pressing \r\nproblems that weigh on our peoples is, in our \r\nopinion, increasingly becoming the main question \r\nposed to the Movement of Non-Aligned \r\nCountries. Peace and the immense risks that \r\nthreaten it, is not something that should be left \r\nexclusively in the hands of the big military \r\nPowers. Peace is possible, but world peace can \r\nonly be assured to the extent that all countries are \r\nconsciously determined to fight for it — peace, \r\nnot just for a part of the world, but for all \r\npeoples.” \r\nA few days later in this same Hall, reporting on that \r\nsummit, President Castro said: \r\n “The sounds of weapons, of threatening language, \r\nand of arrogant behaviour in the international \r\narena must cease. We have had enough of the \r\nillusion that the problems of the world can be \r\nsolved by nuclear weapons. Bombs may kill the \r\nhungry, the sick, and the ignorant, but they cannot \r\nkill hunger, disease or ignorance. Nor can they \r\nkill the righteous rebellion of the peoples.” \r\n The countries of the South will work united for \r\njustice, peace and the development of our nations and \r\nthe entire world, convinced that a better world is \r\npossible if we all struggle for it. \r\n I should now like to say a few words on behalf of \r\nthe people and Government of Cuba. Our people’s \r\nexercise of its right to self-determination faces new \r\nthreats. The Bush Administration has stepped up its \r\nbrutally hostile measures against Cuba with new \r\neconomic sanctions that further intensify what is \r\nalready the longest blockade human history has known. \r\nMore severe reprisals are also being taken against \r\nthose from other nations who have business dealings \r\nwith Cuba, and financial transactions with our country \r\nare viciously persecuted. The very Government of the \r\nUnited States recognizes that it is spending more today \r\nin persecuting and punishing those who have business \r\ndealings with Cuba than in monitoring the finances of \r\nthose who attacked the twin towers. \r\n This past June the Bush Administration approved \r\nthe second version of its most recent plan of aggression \r\nand domination against our country, aimed not only at \r\noverthrowing the revolution but also at destroying the \r\nCuban nation. In violation of international norms and \r\nlaws, an unprecedented build-up of financial and \r\nmaterial support for subversive actions aimed at \r\noverthrowing the constitutional order freely chosen by \r\nthe Cuban people is being promoted. That anti-Cuban \r\nplan contains a chapter that is being kept secret.  \r\n The precedents for these decisions are the covert \r\nactions undertaken against the Cuban revolution, which \r\ninclude mercenary invasions, terrorist actions, the \r\nintroduction of plagues and epidemics to the country, \r\nand more than 600 plots to assassinate Fidel. \r\nThousands of Cubans have lost their lives or been \r\nmaimed for life as a result of this criminal policy. As \r\nthe height of hypocrisy and irresponsibility, the \r\nGovernment of the United States tolerates the presence \r\nof, and protects, the terrorists who plan new actions \r\nagainst our people on United States soil. While \r\nmanoeuvring to free the murderers responsible for \r\nmonstrous crimes — such as the notorious \r\nA/61/PV.12  \r\n \r\n06-52879 26 \r\n \r\ninternational terrorist and CIA agent Luis Posada \r\nCarriles, whom they refuse to extradite to Venezuela — \r\nthe United States Government is illegally and unjustly \r\nkeeping five courageous anti-terrorist Cuban activists \r\nin prison.  \r\n In spite of all these acts of aggression and the \r\ncriminal blockade, the Cuban people will never be \r\ndefeated. Cuba’s internationalist efforts continue \r\nunhindered. More than 30,000 Cuban doctors and other \r\nCuban health professionals are saving lives in 68 \r\ndifferent countries today. We are participating in the \r\nstruggle against illiteracy on several continents. We are \r\ndeveloping a plan to train 100,000 doctors for the third \r\nworld, and we are helping hundreds of thousands of \r\npeople in many countries to regain their sight through \r\nOperation Miracle. With these efforts we are just \r\nfulfilling our fundamental duty in solidarity to aid all \r\nthe peoples of the world. \r\n Cuba is making progress and will continue to \r\nadvance and face the future with optimism and unity. \r\nIts educated and hard-working people, who consider \r\nhumanity to be their homeland, will struggle hand in \r\nhand with the peoples the Assembly represents for the \r\nright to live in peace, justice and dignity for all. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Cuba for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Esteban Lazo Hernández, Vice-President of \r\nthe Republic of Cuba, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I now call on \r\nHis Highness Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al-Thani, \r\nHeir Apparent of the State of Qatar, to address the \r\nAssembly. \r\n Sheikh Al-Thani (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): It \r\ngives me pleasure at the outset to congratulate you, \r\nMadam President, on your election to the presidency of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-first session. I wish \r\nyou every success in your endeavours. I should also \r\nlike to thank your predecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, for \r\nhis efforts during the Assembly’s sixtieth session. Our \r\nthanks also go to Mr. Kofi Annan, who has been \r\nworking to strengthen the role of the United Nations. \r\n During the September 2005 Summit, the \r\ninternational community reaffirmed its commitment to \r\nthe global partnership for development in order to \r\nachieve internationally agreed development objectives. \r\nThe United Nations system remains one of the most \r\nimportant pillars of international support for that \r\npartnership. I wish to recall here that the State of Qatar \r\nhas always been a supportive partner in development \r\nefforts, particularly in combating poverty, because all \r\nthat has positive results for stability and international \r\npeace and security. \r\n In 2001 Qatar hosted the Fourth Ministerial \r\nConference of the World Trade Organization, which \r\nculminated in the Doha Ministerial Declaration. It also \r\nhosted the South Summit in 2005, in which His \r\nHighness Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, Emir of \r\nthe State of Qatar, launched his initiative to establish \r\nthe South’s Fund for Development and Humanitarian \r\nAssistance. Moreover, His Highness reaffirmed Qatar’s \r\ncommitment to meet the internationally agreed official \r\ndevelopment assistance target relative to its gross \r\nnational product. His Highness also offered to host the \r\nfirst Review Conference of the International \r\nConference on Financing for Development. I am \r\npleased to note that the State of Qatar will be hosting \r\nthe Sixth International Conference of New or Restored \r\nDemocracies, scheduled for 30 October to 1 November \r\nthis year.  \r\n I should also like to recall here that Qatar has \r\nextended emergency and disaster relief assistance and \r\nmade many contributions to the various United Nations \r\nfunds and programmes. \r\n We must work to strengthen the role of the United \r\nNations and revitalize and support its institutions so \r\nthat they can carry out the tasks entrusted to them in \r\ndifferent parts of the world. However, if the \r\nOrganization is to discharge its role in full, its Charter \r\nmust be adhered to and respected. Furthermore, an \r\nagreement must be reached on a new formula to reform \r\nthe Security Council and update its working methods. \r\nThe General Assembly must be allowed to play its role \r\nin the maintenance of international peace and security \r\nalongside the Security Council.  \r\n We were shocked and astonished at the \r\ndisproportionate Israeli response against fraternal \r\nLebanon, which killed hundreds of innocent civilians, \r\ntotally decimated its infrastructure and left scores of \r\nLebanese towns and villages in ruins. It has also \r\ndisplaced one quarter of Lebanon’s population, which \r\nis indeed a full-scale war crime. \r\n The Arab-Israeli conflict and the Palestinian \r\nquestion must be accorded top priority, for which a \r\ncomprehensive, permanent and just solution is urgently \r\nneeded. The Palestinian question is an example of \r\nsuffering visited upon a people whose legitimate rights \r\nwere denied, a question that has been on the agendas of \r\n A/61/PV.12\r\n \r\n27 06-52879 \r\n \r\nthe Security Council and the General Assembly for \r\nmore than 50 years. Therefore the international \r\ncommunity must review its position towards a \r\nfundamental issue that it has left unresolved for more \r\nthan half a century, thus compounding the tragedy of \r\nthe Palestinian people.  \r\n Compelling Israel to implement United Nations \r\nresolutions is a collective duty that we must all fulfil so \r\nthat international legitimacy will not be branded as \r\nselective. The Palestinian people must be enabled to \r\nexercise their right to self-determination and to \r\nestablish their independent State with Jerusalem as its \r\ncapital.  \r\n A comprehensive, peaceful settlement of the \r\nArab-Israeli conflict should also be achieved, on the \r\nbasis of Israel’s withdrawal from all the territories it \r\noccupied in 1967, including the Syrian Golan and the \r\nLebanese Sheba’a farms. We also stress that the \r\nguarantee of permanent peace, security and stability in \r\nthe region lies in making the Middle East a zone free \r\nfrom all weapons of mass destruction without any \r\nexceptions. \r\n The difficult situation in fraternal Iraq requires \r\nour cooperation in order to help it overcome this \r\nuntenable situation and its repercussions. We have \r\ncontinuously reaffirmed our commitment to the unity \r\nand sovereignty of Iraq, to the rights of Iraqis to live in \r\ndignity and freedom and to rebuild their country, and \r\nfor Iraq to regain its well-deserved place in the region \r\nand among the family of nations. \r\n We want to pay tribute to the Government of the \r\nSudan, which after tireless efforts has succeeded in \r\nestablishing peace in the south of the country. It \r\ncontinues its sincere efforts to achieve security and \r\nstability in different parts of the country. We fully \r\nsupport those efforts and look forward to more support \r\nfrom the international community to fraternal Sudan in \r\norder to preserve its unity and territorial integrity.  \r\n We also support ongoing efforts by the League of \r\nArab States to achieve national reconciliation in \r\nfraternal Somalia and to restore the rule of law in that \r\ncountry. We call upon the international community to \r\nsupport those efforts so that stability and security can \r\nbe restored to Somalia. \r\n We reaffirm the important role of the United \r\nNations and the need to enhance it so that it can put \r\ninternational relations on a solid foundation of \r\nunderstanding and common interests. We also stress the \r\nimportance of resolving conflicts and disputes by \r\npeaceful means and of cooperation among all nations \r\nto end violence and combat terrorism. We must avoid \r\nsquandering our resources and wasting our energies on \r\nwars and conflicts. Instead, we should channel them \r\ntowards development and progress. We look forward to \r\na new world governed by the principles of justice, \r\nequality, freedom, democracy and peaceful coexistence \r\namong its peoples, nations and civilizations. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I now call on \r\nHis Highness Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the United Arab \r\nEmirates. \r\n Sheikh Al Nahyan (United Arab Emirates) \r\n(spoke in Arabic): It gives me pleasure, on behalf of \r\nthe delegation of the United Arab Emirates, to extend \r\nto you, Madam President, and to your fraternal country, \r\nthe Kingdom of Bahrain, our heartfelt congratulations \r\non your election to the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-first session. We are confident \r\nthat your wide experience will enable you to deal \r\nwisely and competently with the issues on our agenda, \r\nand we wish you every success. We also take this \r\nopportunity to commend your predecessor, Mr. Jan \r\nEliasson, for the skilful manner in which he managed \r\nthe work of the sixtieth session, and to thank Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan for his outstanding efforts, which \r\nhave significantly contributed to strengthening the role \r\nof this international organization in addressing the \r\nchallenges the world has faced during his term of \r\noffice.  \r\n In spite of all the expectations that we hoped \r\nwould be fulfilled in the areas of establishing peace \r\nand collective security, development, strengthening \r\nhuman rights and the rule of law, and reform of the \r\nUnited Nations, we meet today amid extremely serious \r\nsecurity, political and economic conditions that have \r\nresulted in increasing poverty and epidemics and have \r\nprevented the sustainable development mechanisms \r\nfrom achieving the desired development goals of the \r\n2005 Summit. Instead of intensifying our efforts to \r\nstrengthen international relations and enhance positive \r\ninvestment in economic globalization, we had to direct \r\nour efforts towards finding temporary solutions for the \r\ngrave security threats facing our world today in many \r\nregions. \r\n The major weakness demonstrated by the \r\nperformance of some bodies of this international \r\norganization, especially in those entrusted with \r\nmaintaining international peace and security, requires a \r\nreconsideration of the ways to reform its main \r\nA/61/PV.12  \r\n \r\n06-52879 28 \r\n \r\nstructures and working methods, particularly for the \r\nSecurity Council. Most recent events have proved its \r\ninability to take the immediate and effective measures \r\nneeded to stop acts of aggression and to end \r\noccupation. \r\n Therefore, as we study the proposals by the \r\nSecretary-General for developing the work of the \r\nOrganization, we must ensure that reform is based on \r\nthe principles of equality among States in rights and \r\nduties in order to ensure that developing and small \r\ncountries are increasingly and effectively represented \r\nin the Security Council in accordance with the \r\nprinciple of equitable geographical distribution. It is \r\nalso necessary to strengthen the working methods of \r\nthe Security Council to ensure that it does not infringe \r\nupon the competencies of the Secretariat, the General \r\nAssembly and the Economic and Social Council, so \r\nthat the performance and effectiveness of those bodies \r\ncan be strengthened and increased. \r\n The United Arab Emirates — which collaborates \r\nwith the sisterly countries of the Gulf Cooperation \r\nCouncil (GCC), the League of Arab States and other \r\ngroups in supporting all possible diplomatic and \r\nmediation efforts aimed at containing the hotbeds of \r\ntension and conflicts in the Middle East region, \r\nincluding the Arabian Gulf — reiterates the importance \r\nof resolving differences through peaceful means and of \r\nstrengthening confidence-building measures based on \r\nthe principle of respect for the sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity of States and non-interference in \r\ntheir internal affairs. All this falls under our common \r\nresponsibility to maintain the requirements of regional \r\nand international peace, security and stability.  \r\n Therefore, we ask the Islamic Republic of Iran to \r\ndemonstrate its goodwill towards finding a just and \r\nlasting settlement for its occupation of the three United \r\nArab Emirates islands, Greater and Lesser Tunb and \r\nAbu Musa, by responding to our country’s repeated \r\ninitiatives, which were endorsed by the Arab Gulf \r\nCooperation Council, the Council of the League of \r\nArab States and the international community. Those \r\ninitiatives call for initiating direct and serious \r\nnegotiations on this issue or referring it to the \r\nInternational Court of Justice for legal arbitration. \r\n We support the right of countries to use nuclear \r\nenergy for peaceful purposes under the safeguards of \r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). We \r\noptimistically look forward to continuing the Iranian-\r\nEuropean talks on Iran’s nuclear question in order to \r\nreach a lasting and peaceful settlement and to ensure \r\nthat the safety and security of the peoples and countries \r\nof the region are not exposed to any threat, danger or \r\nunnecessary new confrontations.  \r\n We also stress that the international community \r\nmust deal with this question with utmost transparency \r\nso as to ensure the implementation of all relevant \r\nresolutions of the United Nations, in particular those \r\ncalling for the establishment of a zone free from \r\nweapons of mass destruction, including nuclear \r\nweapons, in the Middle East and the Arabian Gulf. \r\nThat makes it incumbent upon Israel to accede to the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \r\nand to subject all of its nuclear facilities to the IAEA \r\nsafeguards regime. \r\n The United Arab Emirates supports the political \r\nprocess in Iraq and efforts for its reconstruction, and \r\nhopes that the efforts of the Iraqi Government will lead \r\nto achieving national unity, consolidating security and \r\nstability in Iraq, and implementing the \r\nrecommendations of the Abu Dhabi Declaration and \r\nthe New York conference on the International Compact \r\nfor the Reconstruction of Iraq. \r\n We also reaffirm our full support for all regional \r\nand international measures to combat terrorism in all \r\nits forms and manifestations, as it constitutes a grave \r\nthreat to the security and sovereignty of States and \r\ncauses unjustified depletion of civilian lives and \r\nproperties. We also support international efforts aimed \r\nat convening an international conference to define this \r\nphenomenon, address its causes and set the standards \r\nfor differentiating between terrorism and the right of \r\npeople to self-determination.  \r\n As we all strive to create a suitable environment \r\nfor promoting dialogue among civilizations and \r\nstrengthening religious tolerance, we heard with regret \r\nand surprise the recent statements by Pope Benedict \r\nXVI, which gave an opportunity to the extremists to \r\ndeepen the gap of intolerance and to raise doubts about \r\nthe intentions of others. That makes it incumbent on us \r\nto avoid repeating such statements in future in order to \r\npromote further understanding between religions and \r\ncivilizations. \r\n We are deeply concerned at the continued \r\ninability of the international community to solve the \r\nPalestinian question and establish peace in the Middle \r\nEast. That has encouraged Israel to continue its \r\noccupation of the Palestinian territories, the Sheba’a \r\nfarms in Lebanon and the Syrian Golan, and to repeat \r\nits aggressions on various levels. Therefore, we urge \r\nthe United Nations to respond today to the recent \r\n A/61/PV.12\r\n \r\n29 06-52879 \r\n \r\ninitiative of the League of Arab States, which calls \r\nupon the international organization to play an effective \r\nrole in reviving the peace process in the Middle East \r\nand resume direct negotiations on all tracks, in \r\naccordance with resolutions of international legitimacy \r\nand the Arab Peace Initiative.  \r\n We also affirm that consolidation of peace and \r\nstability in the Middle East region cannot be achieved \r\nthrough military power or the continued and deliberate \r\ndestruction of the infrastructure in the Palestinian \r\nterritories and in Lebanon, but through compelling \r\nIsrael to ensure its full compliance with international \r\nresolutions, including the resumption of negotiations \r\nwith the Palestinian Authority and the release of \r\nPalestinian funds and the thousands of Palestinian \r\ndetainees and prisoners. Israel is further requested to \r\nopen the crossing points to secure delivery of \r\nemergency humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian \r\npeople, to remove settlements and the separation wall \r\nand to withdraw fully from all the Palestinian \r\nterritories occupied since 1967, including East \r\nJerusalem, so that the establishment of an independent \r\nPalestinian State, with Al-Quds al-Sharif as its capital, \r\ncan be declared. \r\n We welcome the considerable efforts by the \r\nLebanese Government to extend its control throughout \r\nits national territories, with the support of the United \r\nNations Interim Force in Lebanon. In this regard we \r\ndemand that the international community intensify its \r\npressures on Israel to compel it to fulfil its legal \r\nobligations, as provided in Security Council resolution \r\n1701 (2006), including its full respect for Lebanon’s \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity, handing over maps \r\nof landmines and entering into negotiations on the \r\nexchange of prisoners. We also affirm the importance \r\nof doubling the international assistance directed to the \r\nreconstruction of Lebanon. \r\n As for the Sudan — and following up the \r\ncircumstances relating to Security Council resolution \r\n1706 (2006) — we had hoped that the Sudan would \r\nhave been given sufficient time to resolve the Darfur \r\nquestion internally. We declare our support for the \r\nefforts of the Sudanese Government to find a lasting \r\nsolution to this question. We hope that the United \r\nNations and the African Union will continue their \r\npositive role in this regard, in conformity with the Arab \r\nLeague’s efforts, in order to maintain the sovereignty, \r\nterritorial integrity and independence of the Sudan.  \r\n We also call for strengthening of the efforts and \r\nendeavours to reconcile political differences and \r\ndisputes in regions such as Somalia, Afghanistan, other \r\nAfrican countries and troubled regions of the world in \r\norder to contain tensions and conflicts in those regions \r\nand assist their peoples to realize their aspirations \r\ntowards permanent peace, stability and prosperity.  \r\n The United Arab Emirates, which incorporated \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals in its national \r\ndevelopment policy and has come a long way in the \r\nprocess of achieving economic and human \r\ndevelopment, has extended generous assistance to \r\nmany poor and affected countries. In this regard, the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates would like to stress that with the \r\nongoing problems of poverty, infectious diseases and \r\nunemployment, in addition to other economic, social \r\nand environmental problems, the international \r\ncommunity must develop a firm and effective \r\ninternational mechanism that ensures a continuous flow \r\nof assistance to developing countries so as to enable \r\nthem to improve their living conditions and build their \r\nnational economies.  \r\n It is incumbent upon the advanced States, \r\nespecially the Group of Eight, to fulfil their \r\ncommitments as agreed at international conferences, \r\nespecially in easing the onerous commercial conditions \r\nimposed on developing countries’ trade, on their efforts \r\nto attract foreign capital and investment and on their \r\nuse of advanced technology for peaceful purposes, in \r\norder to avoid marginalizing those countries and to \r\nensure better participation for them in international \r\ntrade. \r\n Finally, we hope that our deliberations on the \r\nagenda items during this session will have a positive \r\noutcome that will contribute to addressing the critical \r\nissues we face today, and that they will enhance our \r\ncommon efforts to create a world based on the \r\nprinciples of the rule of law, justice, tolerance and \r\npeace. \r\n The meeting rose at 1.30 p.m. \r\n"
