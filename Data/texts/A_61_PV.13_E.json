For the United \r\nNations, 2006 represents a new opportunity to assess \r\nprogress since the adoption six years ago of the \r\npackage of commitments generally known as the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, which received \r\nrenewed impetus during the 2005 World Summit. The \r\noutcome of that summit provides the main theme of our \r\ndebate during this Assembly, as well as the guidelines \r\nfor the reform of our Organization. For this great city, \r\nthe site of the Headquarters of our Organization, 2006 \r\nmarks the fifth anniversary of the tragic events of \r\n11 September 2001, which altered history forever. For \r\nGuatemala, 2006 marks the tenth anniversary of the \r\nsigning of the Peace Accords that put an end to a \r\nbloody internal conflict lasting over four decades. For \r\nour Secretary-General, it marks the end of his 10-year \r\nterm, which has had a highly positive result: a result \r\nthat I want to acknowledge and for which I would like \r\nto thank him. \r\n I will move on to address some of these \r\nsubstantial issues. But before doing so, I would like to \r\nstate our appreciation of Mr. Jan Eliasson’s \r\nstewardship and exceptional leadership of the previous \r\nsession of this Assembly. At the same time, we \r\nwelcome your election, Madam President, and have no \r\ndoubt that you will bring us to a safe port. \r\n I should like to allude very briefly to four \r\nmatters: compliance with the Guatemalan Peace \r\nAccords, a process in which the United Nations \r\nparticipated very closely; follow-up of the 2005 World \r\nSummit, especially Millennium Goal 8, namely, to \r\nfoster a global partnership for development; our views \r\non certain aspects of United Nations reform; and our \r\nviews on certain positive developments that affect \r\ninternational relations. \r\n The brief time allotted to me does not allow me \r\nto go into detail, but it is undeniable that we have \r\nadvanced substantially in the direction of giving \r\nconcrete expression to the vision contained in the \r\nPeace Accords. More to the point, if we contrast \r\ntoday’s Guatemala to that of 1996, we now have a \r\nsociety that is more plural, tolerant, deliberative and \r\nparticipative than in the past. Our representative \r\ndemocracy is taking root, after three free and \r\ntransparent elections. The army is truly subordinated to \r\nA/61/PV.13  \r\n \r\n06-52885 2 \r\n \r\nthe civil Government. Important progress has been \r\nachieved in strengthening a multi-ethnic and \r\nmultilingual society. The State is committed to \r\nrespecting of civil, political and human rights and to \r\npromoting greater participation of women in our \r\nsociety. Significant efforts have been in strengthening \r\nthe administration of justice and consolidating the rule \r\nof law. The proportion of public expenditure assigned \r\nto the provision of social services has increased \r\nsignificantly in the past few years. We have assisted the \r\nvictims of the conflict through a programme of \r\nreparation payments. We promote the National Front \r\nagainst Hunger as a priority of my Government. \r\nLikewise, we recently adopted a policy on rural \r\ndevelopment, which was prepared and will be \r\nimplemented with the participation of entrepreneurs, \r\npeasants and trade unions. \r\n At the same time, we recognize that much \r\nremains to be done. Human rights violations persist, \r\noften linked to an increase in crime, including \r\norganized crime. It is for this reason that we invited the \r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights \r\nto open an office in Guatemala and to join us in \r\nstrengthening our own capacity to defend and protect \r\nvulnerable groups. We have also invited the United \r\nNations to support an initiative to establish a \r\ncommission to investigate illicit and clandestine \r\ngroups. Furthermore, we have promoted domestic \r\nlegislation to combat the scourge of crime, including \r\nthe recently promulgated law against organized crime. \r\n The commitments contained in the Peace Accords \r\nentail serious budgetary implications. To address them, \r\nwe recently sent to Congress, and Congress approved, \r\nan act to combat tax evasion. At the same time, we \r\nhave forged a broad consensus on an agreed tax \r\npackage that ensures the financing of future \r\ndevelopment through improvements in the allocation \r\nand administration of public expenditures and the \r\ncollection of taxes. \r\n My Government assigns priority to the \r\nrecognition of the identity and rights of indigenous \r\npeoples. In this regard, we trust that the General \r\nAssembly will soon adopt the Draft Declaration on the \r\nRights of Indigenous Peoples, which saw light in the \r\nHuman Rights Council and which will contribute to \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals. \r\n In summary, our Government Plan has embraced \r\nthe Peace Accords and is committed nationally to \r\ncomplying with them. In 2005, a Framework Act on the \r\nPeace Accords was passed in order to strengthen the \r\ninstitutional aspects of the peace process. One of our \r\ngoals is to achieve socio-economic development that is \r\nparticipatory and responds to the needs of the entire \r\npopulation. \r\n This leads me to the second item, namely, the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). Indeed, a \r\nmajor part of our Government programme is entirely \r\nconsistent with those goals, especially with regard to \r\ncombating poverty and hunger and achieving universal \r\nprimary education. Our policies, which emphasize rural \r\ndevelopment, take an approach that favours the poorest \r\nstrata of our society. The efforts undertaken have been \r\nbased mostly on domestic resources — Government \r\nand civil society — but we have also received support \r\nfrom the international community in the context of a \r\ngenuine partnership. \r\n The international community’s respect for our \r\npriorities has grown, and it has increasingly adapted its \r\nmethods to our budgetary procedures. From our \r\ncountry’s point of view, significant progress has been \r\nachieved since the International Conference on \r\nFinancing for Development was held in 2002. We have \r\nalso noted a reversal, over the past four years, in the \r\nearlier trend towards declining official development \r\nassistance (ODA). It is hoped that the new trend of \r\nincreasing ODA will persist and accelerate, especially \r\nin favour of the least developed countries. \r\n In contrast to the relatively encouraging picture \r\nin the area of financing for development, it is a source \r\nof great concern that the negotiations of the Doha \r\nDevelopment Round have been suspended. That is a \r\nserious setback for the global economy and especially \r\nfor the chances of developing countries to improve \r\ntheir participation in international trade. \r\n If the potential of the Development Round is not \r\nsalvaged, which must include the dismantling of \r\nagricultural subsidies as well as other restrictive \r\npractices of trade in agricultural products that persist \r\namong the main developed economies, it will be \r\ndifficult to continue referring to a global partnership \r\nfor development as posited by the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. In that regard, it is urgently \r\nnecessary to renew the negotiations of the Doha Round \r\nunder the aegis of the World Trade Organization. On \r\nthat subject, we also support the strengthening of \r\nSouth-South cooperation in all areas. \r\n A/61/PV.13\r\n \r\n3 06-52885 \r\n \r\n Moving on now to the third part of my remarks, \r\nwe believe that the reforms undertaken at the United \r\nNations since 2000, and in particular since the 2005 \r\nSummit, have been significant and headed in the right \r\ndirection. We identify with the new Human Rights \r\nCouncil, of which we are a member, and support the \r\nfulfilment of its role in promoting and protecting \r\nhuman rights at the global level. \r\n We also understand the considerable potential of \r\nthe new Peacebuilding Commission to contribute to the \r\njoint work of the Security Council and the Economic \r\nand Social Council for the benefit of countries now in \r\npost-conflict situations. We promote the revitalization \r\nand strengthening of the General Assembly as the only \r\nuniversal body with enough legitimacy to debate and \r\nadopt policies, as prescribed by the Charter and as \r\nagreed in the Millennium Declaration and at the 2005 \r\nSummit. \r\n We reiterate our strong support for the Economic \r\nand Social Council as a meeting place to foster \r\nsustainable development. We especially applaud the \r\ndecision to convene a high-level meeting on \r\ndevelopment cooperation every two years. We add our \r\nvoices to all the others urging an end to the stalemate \r\nin the discussions on Security Council reform. The \r\nparameters of that debate are well known. For our part, \r\nwe have historically favoured a moderate expansion in \r\nthe number of non-permanent members, but more \r\nrecently, we have signalled that we could support any \r\nformula that would be capable of bringing about a \r\nconsensus, including the expansion of members in both \r\ncategories. We also support a more representative, \r\ntransparent and effective Council. \r\n We are candidates for a non-permanent seat on \r\nthe Council for the biennium 2007-2008, because we \r\nbelieve that our experience as a country that made the \r\ntransition from conflict to peace and democracy \r\nprovides us with insights that would contribute to the \r\nwork of the Council. In addition, we are one of the few \r\noriginal signatories of the Charter that have not yet had \r\nthe opportunity to serve in the work of that body. If \r\nelected to the Security Council, we commit ourselves \r\nto carrying out our responsibilities in a professional, \r\nresponsible and dignified manner — in the \r\nrepresentation of our region — and also to promote \r\nfrom within the reform of that crucial forum for \r\nassuring peace and stability in the world. \r\n My country’s foreign policy is in accordance with \r\nour national interests based on improved participation \r\nby Guatemala in the globalized world, as well as the \r\nstrengthening of multilateralism and regional \r\nintegration. We have promoted a deeper integration \r\nwith our immediate neighbours in Central America, \r\nand important progress in the establishment of a \r\ncustoms union has been achieved. We, the five Central \r\nAmerican countries, have also agreed on a free trade \r\nagreement with the United States of America, and in \r\n2007, will begin negotiations on an association \r\nagreement with the European Union. \r\n Moreover, my Government has endeavoured to \r\ndeepen its bilateral relations with Belize, while at the \r\nsame time seeking to find a definitive, just, equitable \r\nand honourable solution to the territorial dispute \r\nbetween our countries. Thus, on 7 September 2005, we \r\nsigned, under the auspices of the Organization of \r\nAmerican States, an Agreement on a Framework for \r\nNegotiations and Confidence-Building Measures, \r\nwhich covers a wide range of subjects and will bring us \r\ncloser. One of the tangible results of that effort has \r\nbeen a free trade agreement signed just a few months \r\nago. \r\n Guatemala participated actively in the High-level \r\nDialogue on International Migration and Development \r\nheld in this same Hall less than a week ago. In that \r\ncontext, we emphasize that attention to the situation of \r\nGuatemalan migrants is another priority of my \r\nGovernment. An essential element of the public policy \r\non that subject is full respect for the human rights of all \r\nmigrants, an element which will only be fulfilled when \r\nall States become parties to the International \r\nConvention on the Protection of the Rights of All \r\nMigrant Workers and Members of Their Families. \r\n My Government is working with the recipient \r\ncountries, in particular with the United States of \r\nAmerica, to promote comprehensive migration reform \r\nthat would include mechanisms to manage the supply \r\nof workers in the countries of origin and the demand \r\nfor workers in the recipient countries. That would help \r\nregularize the situation of emigrants, whose \r\ncontribution to the well-being of their communities is \r\nsubstantial, and would make it possible to overcome \r\nthe great vulnerability of our population. \r\n We feel solidarity with other countries that have \r\nendured under conflict situations. This is why we have \r\ntaken part in an increasing number of United Nations \r\nA/61/PV.13  \r\n \r\n06-52885 4 \r\n \r\npeacekeeping operations. We are proud of our \r\npresence, along with many other Latin American \r\ncountries, in our neighbour Haiti, and we celebrate the \r\ndemocratically elected Government of President René \r\nPréval. We also have troops in the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo and military observers in six \r\nother countries in the African continent. \r\n We deplore the violence that has affected several \r\ncountries in the Middle East, in particular Lebanon. We \r\ncall for a solution that will allow Israel and a sovereign \r\nPalestinian State to live in peace within safe borders in \r\nthe wider context of a region that finds its own destiny \r\nin harmony and progress. \r\n Given the importance of coordination among \r\nStates of the region, Guatemala organized, from 11 to \r\n13 September 2006, the first regional security meeting \r\nof Central America and the Dominican Republic, with \r\nthe goal of achieving a consensus among the countries \r\nof the Central American group, as well as Mexico, \r\nColombia, Belize and the Dominican Republic, to \r\ndevelop a comprehensive strategy and to counteract the \r\nmain threats to the area, a consensus to unify the \r\nsecurity policies and procedures already agreed and \r\ncontained in multilateral regional and international \r\nagreements, treaties and conventions, as well as those \r\nadopted at summit meetings. We hope we can continue \r\nto count on the support of the international community \r\nand of the United Nations to organize three more \r\nmeetings to complete the development of that strategy. \r\n It is important to emphasize that Guatemala is \r\norganizing, jointly with Transparency International, the \r\n12th International Anti-Corruption Conference, from \r\n15 to 18 November this year. The theme for the \r\nconference will be “Towards a fairer world: Why is \r\ncorruption still blocking the way?” This effort reflects \r\nmy Government’s firm commitment to fight the \r\nscourge of corruption that has corroded our institutions \r\nfor many years and has prevented our citizens from \r\nmaking the transition to a more just country. On that \r\nnote, you are all welcome, and we are eager to share \r\nour challenges, progress and difficulties in this \r\ncommon struggle. \r\n Under your leadership, Madam President, at this \r\nsession the General Assembly will have to address \r\nissues of great importance for humanity and for our \r\nOrganization. Guatemala pledges to participate actively \r\nin the debates planned for this year. From this moment \r\non, we offer you our full cooperation for the success of \r\nyour presidency. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Guatemala for the statement he has just made. \r\nMr. Oscar Berger Perdomo, President of the \r\nRepublic of Guatemala, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Néstor Carlos Kirchner, President of \r\nthe Argentine Republic \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Argentine Republic. \r\nMr. Néstor Carlos Kirchner, President of the \r\nArgentine Republic, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Néstor Carlos Kirchner, \r\nPresident of the Argentine Republic, and to invite him \r\nto address the General Assembly. \r\n President Kirchner (spoke in Spanish): I would \r\nlike to congratulate you, Ms. Al-Khalifa, on your \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at this \r\nsession, since I believe it is very significant that a \r\nwoman has assumed that role, to promote gender \r\nequality, which is a goal both of my Government and \r\nof the United Nations. \r\n On behalf of the Argentine Republic, we would \r\nalso like to congratulate the President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixtieth session, Mr. Jan Eliasson, for \r\nthe work he carried out, and to renew our recognition \r\nof Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his role in action \r\npromoting peace, multilateralism and the fight against \r\npoverty. \r\n We have come to the General Assembly in the \r\nfirm belief that the revitalization of this forum of \r\nglobal representation is fundamental so that \r\ninternational law can be the instrument of rationality \r\nthat will enable us to settle conflicts and combat the \r\nthreats to peace. \r\n The international conduct of the Argentine \r\nRepublic is inspired by the values of representative \r\ndemocracy, respect for fundamental human rights and \r\nactive defence of international peace and security. \r\nThose principles, shared by the vast majority of the \r\n A/61/PV.13\r\n \r\n5 06-52885 \r\n \r\nArgentine people, guide our administration and are the \r\nbasis of our foreign policy decisions. \r\n In the field of human rights, in 2003, after more \r\nthan two decades of sustained democratic rule in \r\nArgentina, we experienced a true paradigm shift. In \r\nresponse to the mandates of the whole of society, the \r\nthree powers of the State adopted, within their \r\nrespective purviews, concurrent decisions against \r\nimpunity, preserving memory, truth and justice and \r\nsecuring reparations. \r\n The annulment by Congress of the laws that \r\naccorded impunity for State-sponsored crimes of \r\nterrorism, the ruling that those laws and pardons \r\ngranted by the courts in our country were \r\nunconstitutional, and the reopening of over a thousand \r\ncourt proceedings for crimes against humanity — some \r\nof which have resulted in the conviction of those \r\nresponsible — constitute landmarks of that shift. It is \r\nour conviction that democracy is strengthened with the \r\nsimultaneous fight against impunity and promotion of \r\nfull respect for the rule of law, without calling for \r\nrevenge. \r\n With that experience, we have, since the \r\nbeginning of the reform of the United Nations system, \r\nstrongly supported incorporating human rights into the \r\nhierarchy so as to raise the institutional level of their \r\ntreatment to that already given to development and to \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security. \r\nThat determination led us to establish the Human \r\nRights Council, in whose creation Argentina \r\nparticipated actively. \r\n The first steps of that body have been positive, \r\nhaving approved the text of the International \r\nConvention for the Protection of All Persons from \r\nEnforced Disappearance. That is an instrument of great \r\nsignificance for our country, as it defines a crime \r\nagainst humanity from which Argentina suffered \r\nmassively in the past, at a high cost to our society. We \r\nhave among us here today a representative of an \r\norganization that was extremely involved with that \r\nissue — one of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, \r\nMrs. Marta Vázquez, who is accompanying our \r\ndelegation. We hope the General Assembly will adopt \r\nthat very important instrument quickly, during this \r\nsession. \r\n Five years after the attacks that shocked this city \r\nand the world, we would like to firmly condemn the \r\nserious threat of global terrorism. Argentina considers \r\nall acts of terrorism against innocent civilians to be \r\ncriminal and unjustifiable, and accepts no argument to \r\njustify such methods. \r\n The Argentine people suffered two atrocious \r\nattacks in the 1990s against the Embassy of Israel and \r\nthe headquarters of the Asociación Mutual Israelita \r\nArgentina. We are still struggling, in spite of the time \r\nthat has elapsed, to fully clarify the facts and punish \r\nthe culprits. We believe that, in order to face this \r\ncriminal threat successfully, we must carry out a \r\nsustained multilateral and legitimate response. Respect \r\nfor human rights, international humanitarian law and \r\nrefugee law is essential, as are international \r\ncooperation and legal assistance to effectively enforce \r\nthe norms against terrorism. \r\n If, in facing down global terrorism, we resort to a \r\nglobal violation of human rights, the only winner in \r\nthis fight shall be terrorism. We will advance firmly in \r\nthe fight against terrorism only if we frame it within \r\nrespect for local laws and international norms and \r\nconventions. No complication can be an excuse for not \r\ncombating terrorism within the law. \r\n Peace is built and maintained by understanding \r\nthe true concept of solidarity among nations from a \r\nwider perspective than the purely military or the \r\npredominantly unilateral. Nations big and small, rich \r\nand poor, will be markedly vulnerable if we fail to \r\ngrasp that the fight against terrorism demands \r\nsustained multilateral, intelligent action firmly based in \r\nlegitimacy, respect for fundamental rights, \r\nproportionality of response and the support of \r\ninternational public opinion. \r\n We would like to express our concern regarding \r\nthe hostilities on the border between Israel and \r\nLebanon, resulting in hundreds of casualties, severe \r\ndamage to the civilian infrastructure and hundreds of \r\nthousands of displaced persons. The violence must \r\nstop. We need to address the causes at the heart of the \r\ncrisis, avoid the disproportionate use of force, and \r\nunderstand that only negotiated political solutions can \r\nhold in the long term. Argentina will continue to \r\nsupport a fair solution to the Middle East problems \r\nwithin the framework of resolution 1701 (2006). \r\n We must understand that the world will move \r\ncloser to peace only insofar as it promotes equality and \r\nstruggles to eradicate poverty and exclusion. That is \r\ntrue both for the global system and for each country \r\nnationally. \r\nA/61/PV.13  \r\n \r\n06-52885 6 \r\n \r\n Argentina supports the building of societies that \r\nare fairer, more equitable and with a better distribution \r\nof the benefits of economic growth. We also believe \r\nthat each country has the right to search for its own \r\ndevelopment model with no external conditionalities. \r\nWe not only aspire to generate sustainable growth; we \r\nalso want it to reach everyone. There must be \r\nharmonized growth that translates into a balanced \r\nincome distribution, because we know that what is \r\nneeded is not development for a mere few, but the \r\ndevelopment of the whole country. \r\n In the region and in the Common Market of the \r\nSouth, we want an efficient instrument to address \r\npoverty and exclusion; we want the common good to \r\nprevail over sectarian interests and to overcome \r\nstagnation and the technology gap; and we want to \r\ndefine a sustainable and productive development model \r\nthat valorizes our competitive advantages and fosters \r\nour vast wealth in human and material resources. \r\n The economic situation of the Republic is very \r\ndifferent from what it was when our Administration \r\nbegan. We are achieving true structural change. That \r\nincludes uninterrupted growth at rates of between 8 \r\nand 9 per cent; the growing participation of investment \r\nin the gross domestic product; record local savings \r\nrates; the resurrection of local industry; a fiscal surplus \r\nat historic levels; a clear expansion of our industrial \r\nsales to the world; the systematic decrease of local and \r\nexternal public debt; the preventive accumulation of \r\nreserves; lesser external exposure; a marked drop in \r\nunemployment; a strengthening of the income of wage \r\nearners and retirees; and a significant fall of poverty \r\nand destitution levels. \r\n With a prudent monetary policy, an orderly fiscal \r\npolicy, a fiscal and commercial surplus, and a \r\nresponsible management of indebtedness, we are \r\nincreasingly reducing the vulnerability and uncertainty \r\nthat characterized the Argentine economy in the past. \r\nDecent work, social inclusion, national production, \r\ninternal consumption and sustained growth have \r\nallowed us to fulfil the goals of the Millennium \r\nDeclaration, although there is still a long way to go to \r\nrecover from the hell into which we had fallen. \r\n We seek the integral sustainability of that \r\nprocess, not only in its macroeconomic aspects, but \r\nalso guaranteeing social equity and a fairer distribution \r\nof income through the reduction of poverty and \r\nunemployment. \r\n In implementing a national education plan with a \r\nstrong federal emphasis that highlights the challenge of \r\nimproving the quality of education, ensures the \r\ngrowing funding of the public sector, and interacts with \r\nthe private sector, we seek also to achieve its strategic \r\nsustainability. \r\n We cannot but point out that these achievements \r\nhave not been supported by the International Monetary \r\nFund, which has denied us any kind of aid, and, it must \r\nbe said, that they are in many cases the result of \r\nignoring or even contradicting its recommendations \r\nand conditionalities. We have sufficient empirical proof \r\nof the failure of international financial organizations in \r\nthe promotion of development in less developed \r\ncountries. In many cases, their conditionalities have \r\nactually had the opposite effect, hindering \r\ndevelopment. \r\n The world has changed and those organizations \r\nhave not. They still insist on jeopardizing advancement \r\nwith their misguided interference. That is why we \r\nsupport, together with most countries, the reform of the \r\ninternational financial architecture to make it more \r\neffectual in assisting the progress of nations with fewer \r\nresources. In noting the reluctance of international \r\nfinancial organizations to effect any real change in \r\ntheir policies, we feel it necessary to endorse such \r\nchange and to consider the creation of new \r\ninternational financial instruments that would allow us \r\nto fund development projects to fight poverty and \r\nhunger in the world and generate true options for \r\nprogress. \r\n Argentina is distressed to note the stagnation in \r\nthe negotiations of the Doha Round for the \r\ndevelopment of the World Trade Organization (WTO). \r\nIt is imperative, within the current globalization \r\nprocess — from which developing countries must \r\nprofit — to reach a successful and balanced result fully \r\nconsistent with the mandate of the Doha Declaration. \r\nThus, we reaffirm the need to reach a satisfactory \r\nresult in agriculture in this WTO round, including a \r\nsubstantial reduction in domestic subsidies, the \r\nelimination of export subsidies and ample access to the \r\nmarkets of developed countries. \r\n We are increasingly concerned to see the \r\ndeterioration of the global environment. We affirm that \r\nthere can be no double standards. The environment \r\nmust be protected in developed and in developing \r\ncountries, in rich countries and in poor, in the countries \r\n A/61/PV.13\r\n \r\n7 06-52885 \r\n \r\nof the North and of the South, in the central and in the \r\nperipheral countries. \r\n In developing their industries, the more \r\nindustrialized countries have profited from a true \r\nenvironmental subsidy from the rest of the countries \r\nwhich today compromise, in their relative \r\nbackwardness, a true world environmental reserve. \r\nThat is why we cannot accept that those countries that \r\nhave achieved greater development — often at the \r\nexpense of the degradation of the environment and by \r\nproducing a severe global effect evident in climate \r\nchange — should seek to transfer to us the more \r\ncontaminating part of their industrial processes. \r\n There can be no reliable solutions without the \r\nconcerted action of all countries of the world, insofar \r\nas the nature of the problem is of a global scale. It is \r\nunacceptable for the claims of the developing States to \r\ngo unnoticed. It is imperative to take the path of \r\nsolutions. \r\n Our countries wish to receive investments and \r\npresent profitable opportunities in the energy, \r\ntransportation and infrastructure fields, and even in \r\nsensitive sectors. Therein lies a strong foundation for \r\ninternational collaboration, but we do not want \r\ninvestors to undertake activities in our countries that \r\nare prohibited in the industrialized countries just so \r\nthat they can improve the profits of shareholders by \r\ncreating the illusion of an allegedly less expensive \r\nproduct by raising the costs of environmental pollution, \r\ndeteriorating health conditions and lowered life \r\nexpectancy. \r\n On a different subject, we attach high importance \r\nto our participation, together with other countries of \r\nthe region, in the United Nations Stabilization Mission \r\nin Haiti. In our view, beyond the progress achieved in \r\nthe transition, the steady support and economic \r\nassistance of the international community will continue \r\nto be critical in the areas of security, the strengthening \r\nof institutions, the fostering of political dialogue, the \r\nprotection of human rights, social inclusion, the \r\npromotion of the rule of law, the creation of \r\nadministrative capacity and, above all, the promotion \r\nof economic and social development through concrete \r\ncontributions. \r\n We reiterate here our will to achieve peaceful \r\nnuclear development under the verification of \r\ninternational organizations. Argentina’s commitment to \r\ndisarmament and the non-proliferation of nuclear \r\nweapons, our adherence to the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons and our long-\r\nstanding practice in the field are known to all. \r\n In conclusion, I wish to recall that the question of \r\nthe Malvinas Islands — which includes the Malvinas, \r\nthe South Georgias, the South Sandwich Islands and \r\nthe surrounding maritime area — has been under \r\nconsideration by the United Nations since 1965. The \r\nGeneral Assembly and its Special Committee of 24 on \r\nDecolonization have defined this as a special case that \r\ndiffers from traditional colonial situations in that it \r\ninvolves a sovereignty dispute that must be resolved \r\nthrough bilateral negotiations between my country and \r\nthe United Kingdom, in accordance with the provisions \r\nof resolution 2065 (XX) and other relevant resolutions. \r\n We must stress that the Government of the United \r\nKingdom persists in ignoring those General Assembly \r\nresolutions. Nonetheless, I would like to reaffirm once \r\nagain my country’s readiness to engage in constructive \r\ndialogue with the United Kingdom. We call upon the \r\nUnited Kingdom to promptly heed the request of the \r\ninternational community to resume negotiations. \r\n In conclusion, we are firmly convinced that the \r\nbasis exists for international cooperation that can help \r\nthe world move towards peace. The tensions and \r\ndifficulties besetting humanity must not prevent us \r\nfrom understanding the extent to which the \r\nauthoritarian notion that military might can provide \r\nunilateral solutions to conflicts and threats is starting to \r\nrecede. That mistaken belief has led only to failure and \r\ngreat suffering. \r\n Only multilateral solutions, reached through the \r\narduous process of negotiation, despite their \r\nlimitations, can move us forward. In this context, the \r\nUnited Nations has a fundamental role to play in \r\nensuring greater understanding among nations with a \r\nview to creating a safe, peaceful and fairer world in the \r\nyears to come. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the \r\nArgentine Republic for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Néstor Carlos Kirchner, President of the \r\nArgentine Republic, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nA/61/PV.13  \r\n \r\n06-52885 8 \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Robert Gabriel Mugabe, President of \r\nthe Republic of Zimbabwe \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe. \r\n Mr. Robert Gabriel Mugabe, President of the \r\nRepublic of Zimbabwe, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Robert Gabriel Mugabe, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Zimbabwe, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly. \r\n President Mugabe: Let me begin my statement \r\nby echoing the sentiments of those who have \r\ncongratulated you, Madam on your assumption of the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \r\nsession, as well as of those who have expressed their \r\nappreciation for the manner in which your predecessor, \r\nMr. Jan Eliasson, successfully conducted the business \r\nof the sixtieth session. In the same vein, I should also \r\nlike to congratulate the Republic of Montenegro on its \r\nadmission to the United Nations family. \r\n I also wish to pay special tribute to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his vision and exemplary \r\nleadership of the United Nations over the past 10 years. \r\nWe commend him for his tireless efforts to assist \r\nMember States in transforming the United Nations into \r\na dynamic, relevant and effective instrument for \r\nmeeting challenges that confront us as we try to make \r\nthe world a better place for everyone. \r\n The achievements of the Secretary-General, \r\nespecially in the area of the promotion of peace and \r\ndevelopment — notable among them the Millennium \r\nSummit in 2000 and the review Summit held last \r\nyear — will always be remembered as historic because \r\nof the important decisions that we made on both \r\noccasions. As he nears the end of his tenure of his high \r\nOffice, we wish him the best in his future endeavours \r\nand hope that he will be available to serve the \r\ninternational community wherever he may be needed. \r\n The theme for our debate this year — \r\nimplementation of the global partnership for \r\ndevelopment as a follow-up to the 2005 World \r\nSummit — is very appropriate. We acknowledged last \r\nyear that fighting poverty was a collective undertaking. \r\nTogether, we recognized that mobilizing financial \r\nresources for development is central to a global \r\npartnership for development in support of the \r\nimplementation of internationally agreed goals, \r\nincluding the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\n For many years now, the international community \r\nhas acknowledged the need for accelerated economic \r\ndevelopment in Africa. There have been many \r\ninitiatives and programmes of action aimed at \r\nachieving that objective. Indeed, the history of the \r\nUnited Nations in the past three decades is littered with \r\nwell-meaning initiatives, many of which unfortunately \r\nnever made the transition from theory to practical \r\nimplementation. \r\n We have agreed on goals and set targets for \r\nourselves in our quest to meet our economic and social \r\ndevelopment challenges. Given this impressive array of \r\ninitiatives, it is curious and ironic that the aggregate \r\neconomic performance of our countries has not made a \r\ndifference in the lives of the majority of our people. \r\n Mr. Belinga-Eboutou (Cameroon), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair. \r\n One explanation for our development \r\npredicament and the many failed initiatives is the wide \r\ngap between rhetoric and concrete action on the \r\nground. We have on many occasions agreed on making \r\navailable the means of implementing agreed goals. We \r\nhave set targets for making those resources available. \r\nYet, at the same time, we have witnessed some \r\ncountries and groups taking concerted action, such as \r\nillegal economic sanctions, to frustrate our \r\ndevelopment efforts. \r\n In the case of Zimbabwe, those countries have \r\nblocked balance of payments support and other types \r\nof assistance from the international financial \r\ninstitutions that they control. Following the heroic and \r\nsuccessful efforts of the people of Zimbabwe to clear \r\nrequisite arrears to the International Monetary Fund, \r\nthose negative forces have manipulated decision-\r\nmaking at that institution so as to deny us any new \r\nsupport. They have even tried to restrict investment \r\ninflows, all on account of political differences between \r\nthem and us.  \r\n Is it not a paradox that, while we are denied \r\nresources for development, funding is readily made \r\navailable to support elements bent on subverting the \r\ndemocratically expressed will of the majority of our \r\ncitizens and to unconstitutionally effect regime \r\nchange? We condemn such interference in our domestic \r\n A/61/PV.13\r\n \r\n9 06-52885 \r\n \r\naffairs. Let me repeat what I have said before: regime \r\nchange in Zimbabwe — as, indeed, in any other \r\ncountry — is a right of the people of that country; it \r\ncan never be a right of people of other countries. The \r\ngolden key to regime change is in the hands of the \r\npeople of Zimbabwe and is very well guarded. No one \r\nfrom Washington or London has the right to that key; it \r\nis our key and ours alone. \r\n Let it also not be forgotten that those who want \r\nregime change are the very same people whom we \r\nfought yesterday. They represent British colonialism \r\nand imperialism. We spent many years in jail; I spent \r\n11 years in jail. Then we went into exile in order to \r\nmuster the military strength needed to overthrow \r\ncolonialism. Many of our people died in the process. \r\nMany were killed by the British regime headed by Ian \r\nSmith. Finally, our people were victorious. On 18 April \r\n1980, a representative of the royal family, Prince \r\nCharles, was sent to lower the British flag. I was there \r\nto hoist the flag of independence, which today \r\nrepresents the full sovereignty of the people of \r\nZimbabwe, never again to be lost. Never again shall \r\nZimbabwe become a colony. \r\n And so, these manoeuvres and manipulations \r\ncontinue, and my Government is well aware of them \r\nand is well guarded. At every turn, we will take the \r\nsteps necessary to protect our sovereignty, defend our \r\npeople and defend our right to continue to ensure that \r\nthat sovereignty reposes in the hands of the \r\nZimbabwean people. From this rostrum, I want to warn \r\nthat any attempt to change that mandate through \r\nunconstitutional means, by agents sent to undertake a \r\nprocess that we regard as illegal, will meet with the full \r\nwrath of the law.  \r\n It is for that reason that we welcome this debate, \r\nwhich seeks to address the yawning gap between \r\nagreed action plans and implementation, and between \r\nrhetoric and what actually happens on the ground. We \r\nfully acknowledge that national Governments shoulder \r\nthe primary responsibility for implementing their \r\ndevelopment plans, including achieving the MDGs. \r\nHowever, it is absolutely necessary that our efforts at \r\nthe national level — including adopting and \r\nimplementing correct and relevant programmes — be \r\nsupported, not hampered by a lack of international \r\ncooperation. This session, therefore, would be of great \r\nvalue if agreement were to be reached on financing for \r\ndevelopment, including the establishment of \r\nmechanisms to measure aid flows. Such financing, if it \r\nis to have a meaningful impact, should be adequate, \r\npredictable and consistent. \r\n The HIV/AIDS pandemic continues to cause \r\nuntold havoc in Africa — particularly Southern \r\nAfrica — owing to high levels of poverty, which make \r\nit difficult for the affected people to gain access to \r\nmedication. Zimbabwe welcomes the continuing efforts \r\nby the international community of nations to find \r\nlasting solutions to the scourge of HIV/AIDS. We urge \r\nthe donor community, in cooperation with \r\npharmaceutical companies, to assist in scaling up \r\naccess to affordable essential drugs, particularly for \r\ndeveloping countries. \r\n The tendency to use assistance in the fight against \r\nHIV/AIDS as a reward for political compliance and \r\nmalleability is one that the United Nations should \r\ncondemn. Given the fact that the pandemic does not \r\nrespect borders, the denial of assistance to countries on \r\npolitical grounds, through a self-serving and selective \r\napproach, will do more harm and weaken international \r\nefforts to fight the pandemic. For example, in my \r\ncountry, a Zimbabwean AIDS patient receives, on \r\naverage, approximately $4 per year in international \r\nassistance, compared with an average of approximately \r\n$172 per year for other countries in the region. \r\nHowever, even against that background, my \r\nGovernment has registered some modest success in \r\nreducing the HIV/AIDS prevalence rate from \r\napproximately 29 per cent in 2000 to 18.1 percent in \r\n2006, on the strength of its own resources and \r\nprogrammes. \r\n While we do not dispute the inevitability of \r\nmigration, the problem of the brain drain is of great \r\nconcern to my Government and, indeed, to other \r\ndeveloping countries. The brain drain has proved to be \r\na handicap to sustainable development. If it is not \r\naddressed now, the chances that developing countries \r\nwill achieve the MDGs by 2015 are minimal. While \r\ndeveloping countries are losing skilled manpower \r\nthrough migration, the benefits associated with migrant \r\nremittances are far less than the cost of developing \r\nhuman resources and skills. We need to develop \r\nsolutions that give due recognition and respect to the \r\ninvestments made by Governments in human resources \r\nand in developing the skills of citizens, as well as to \r\nthe human rights of migrants. \r\n While official development assistance is \r\ndesirable, what developing countries need more is an \r\nA/61/PV.13  \r\n \r\n06-52885 10 \r\n \r\nopen, rules-based, predictable, non-discriminatory \r\ntrading and financial system. If developing countries \r\nare to realize the full potential of international trade to \r\nenhance economic growth, it is essential that the main \r\nbarriers to their exports be removed. In that regard, we \r\nare concerned that tariffs have remained high on \r\ngoods — such as textiles and farm products — that are \r\nstrategically important to developing economies. Much \r\ncould be done with the right partnerships and with fair \r\nterms of trade. We share the view that the \r\nimplementation of the development aspects of the \r\nDoha Work Programme will go a long way towards \r\nassisting developing countries to compete in this global \r\nvillage. It is therefore disturbing that there has been no \r\nprogress in breaking the deadlock on the Doha Round \r\nof international trade negotiations. The failure of \r\nmultilateral negotiations will give rise to bilateral \r\narrangements that are inimical to fair trade. We cannot \r\nhelp but suspect that the breakdown was deliberately \r\nengineered in order to perpetuate the status quo that \r\nfavours one group of countries at the expense of \r\nanother. \r\n The United Nations is uniquely placed to provide \r\nthe framework for international cooperation. There is \r\nconsensus that the United Nations should play a \r\nfundamental and central role in the promotion of \r\ninternational cooperation for development. In that \r\nregard, it is important that coherence and coordination \r\nbe enhanced, as agreed in the 2005 World Summit \r\nOutcome. At the country level, the United Nations \r\nsystem should be effectively coordinated in order to \r\nsupport national efforts in poverty reduction and \r\nsustainable development. \r\n While my Government applauds the United \r\nNations continuing efforts to elaborate a convention on \r\nterrorism, we urge Member States to guard against a \r\nsituation in which established international conventions \r\nare ignored and resolutions of the General Assembly \r\nand other United Nations bodies on that issue are \r\ndisregarded. In our attempt to deal with the scourge of \r\nterrorism, it is also necessary to address the underlying \r\ncauses of that phenomenon. To demonstrate its \r\ncommitment to fighting terrorism, the Parliament of \r\nZimbabwe has come up with the Suppression of \r\nForeign and International Terrorism Bill, which seeks \r\nto fight foreign and international terrorism, as well as \r\nmercenary activities. \r\n The recent developments in the Middle East are a \r\ncause of great concern. We condemn the \r\ndisproportionate use of force by Israel in Gaza and \r\nLebanon and the detention of elected Palestinian \r\nmembers of Parliament and ministers. We firmly reject \r\nthe collective punishment of the Palestinian and \r\nLebanese people and the intrusion into their territories \r\nin violation of international law. We call upon the \r\ninternational community, particularly the Security \r\nCouncil and the Quartet, to make every effort to ensure \r\nthat the brokered ceasefire continues to hold. \r\n It is sad that the Security Council dithered and \r\nfailed to take timely action to stop the massacres and \r\nwanton destruction of civilian infrastructure in \r\nLebanon, all because of the misguided national \r\ninterests of one super-Power. The status quo in the \r\nCouncil, where a few powerful countries hold the \r\nworld to ransom, is no longer tenable. There is \r\ntherefore a strong case here for addressing the core \r\nissue of the democratization of international \r\ngovernance. Africa remains the only continent that \r\ndoes not have a permanent seat with veto power in the \r\nSecurity Council. That situation is unacceptable. It \r\nneeds to be corrected and corrected now. The position \r\nof the African Union on that issue is very clear. Africa \r\ndemands two permanent seats, complete with veto \r\npower — if the veto power is to continue — plus two \r\nadditional non-permanent seats. We will not \r\ncompromise on this matter until our concerns are \r\nadequately addressed.  \r\n Those who take objection to that are perhaps \r\nStates that would want to remain in the position in \r\nwhich they are considered to be superior to everyone \r\nelse. There cannot be superiority under the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations, which recognizes the equality of \r\nnations. We are all equal under that Charter, and that \r\nprinciple has got to be recognized, but it would appear \r\nthat some countries that have amassed military power \r\nover time consider themselves to be superior to all the \r\nothers because they have that muscle of power. But the \r\nmuscle of power is not the consideration that we take \r\ninto account in judging the worth of nations. The \r\nCharter of the United Nations has got to be taken into \r\naccount, and who knows whether the Goliath of today \r\nmay tomorrow not be the same. Anyway, every Goliath \r\nhas his own David. \r\n In many parts of Africa, the dawn of an \r\nunprecedented era of peace and tranquillity has \r\nallowed us to refocus our attention and resources \r\ntowards economic development. There can be no better \r\ntime than now for the international community to \r\n A/61/PV.13\r\n \r\n11 06-52885 \r\n \r\naugment our own efforts to bring home to our people \r\nthe peace dividend we have so patiently waited for. We \r\ntherefore call on the international community to renew \r\nits solidarity with Africa through tangible support in \r\nthe form of increased resources, decisive debt relief, as \r\nwell as new and additional financial resources for \r\ninvestment and growth. \r\n Let me conclude by reiterating the fact that the \r\nfuture of the international community is best served by \r\nan international order that is based on strengthening \r\nmultilateralism and thereby destroying the present \r\nunipolar system. It is our conviction that only through \r\na multilateral approach can we achieve peace and \r\ndevelopment. For us to successfully tackle the \r\nchallenges that we face, there is a need for more than \r\njust pious expressions of solidarity. Together as global \r\npartners in development, we can guarantee a \r\nprosperous future for generations to come. Such a \r\npartnership should be based on the principle of the \r\nsovereign equality of nations and on mutual benefit. \r\nThat is the path we should strive to follow. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Zimbabwe for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Robert Gabriel Mugabe, President of the \r\nRepublic of Zimbabwe, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Leonel Fernández Reyna, President \r\nof the Dominican Republic \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Excellency \r\nMr. Leonel Fernández Reyna, President of the \r\nDominican Republic. \r\n Mr. Leonel Fernández Reyna, President of the \r\nDominican Republic, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Leonel Fernández Reyna, President of the \r\nDominican Republic, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly. \r\n President Fernández Reyna (spoke in Spanish): \r\nI am greatly honoured to congratulate Her Excellency \r\nMs. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa of Bahrain upon her \r\nelection, the first woman from the Middle East, to \r\npreside over the work of the sixty-first session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. She has the great responsibility to \r\npromote dialogue and harmony in the midst of the \r\nspread of conflict throughout the world. Likewise, we \r\nwish to pay tribute to the Secretary-General for his ten \r\nyears at the head of this Organization and for his \r\nimmense efforts to promote peacekeeping, security and \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals. \r\n In the interest of continuity in the pursuit of \r\nUnited Nations reform, so notably promoted by the \r\nSecretary-General, our country wishes to reiterate its \r\nconviction that any reform must provide for greater \r\ndemocratization. We recognize the unquestionable \r\naccomplishments achieved during this process, such as \r\nthe creation of the Human Rights Council and the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission. Notwithstanding, reform \r\nwill be incomplete if it does not include reform of the \r\nSecurity Council, the body specifically responsible for \r\ntaking political decisions within this Organization. It is \r\nour conviction that the Security Council must be \r\nexpanded to make it more diverse and participatory, \r\nwith the aim of ensuring more equitable regional \r\nrepresentation and taking into account the regional and \r\nnational interests that prevail in today’s world. There is \r\nalso a need for closer cooperation between the Security \r\nCouncil and other important United Nations bodies, \r\nsuch as the General Assembly and the Economic and \r\nSocial Council. \r\n One of the global issues of great concern to the \r\nDominican Republic and other parts of the world is \r\nthat of human security. We have observed with great \r\nconsternation that there has recently been an erosion of \r\ndomestic security in countries, leading to increased \r\nviolence and criminality. That situation has, without a \r\ndoubt, been fuelled by a combination of factors, among \r\nthem drug trafficking, the illicit traffic of arms, the \r\ntrafficking of persons and other criminal activities. In \r\naddressing this dramatic situation, which is driving \r\nsome populations to desperation, the Dominican \r\nRepublic remains vigilant in the continuous struggle \r\nand urges the international community to strengthen \r\ncontrol and prevention mechanisms that are needed to \r\nmeet these modern challenges that only increase fear \r\nand desperation among defenceless civilian \r\npopulations. \r\n Another issue of great importance for the \r\nprogress and well-being of our countries is the \r\nrelationship between migration and sustainable \r\nA/61/PV.13  \r\n \r\n06-52885 12 \r\n \r\ndevelopment, which constitutes the main item on the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s agenda. We believe that the \r\nphenomenon of migration is positively linked to the \r\ncause of development. However, there is an inherent \r\ncontradiction in this modern, globalized world in that \r\nwe promote the free flow of merchandise, capital and \r\nservices, while we restrict the free flow of human \r\nlabour. \r\n Although each State exercises its sovereign right \r\nin implementing its migration policies, it is our \r\nconviction that the asymmetry currently existing \r\nbetween the free flow of production inputs and the \r\nrestricted flow of persons will have to cease to exist \r\nover time. According to the conservative voices in the \r\ndeveloped world, migration is a sort of invasion from \r\nthe underdeveloped countries to the most developed \r\ncountries. It is also considered to be an act of revenge \r\nfor the territorial expropriation that took place in the \r\ncolonial era and is seen as a threat to their current way \r\nof life. \r\n This is a fallacy. Migration is not about the poor \r\ninvading the developed countries, nor is it a threat to \r\ntheir current way of life. Frankly speaking, migration is \r\none of the historical means used by human beings and \r\nto which they continue to resort to in order to achieve \r\ngreater well-being, liberty and justice. As it will be \r\nimpossible to do away with this phenomenon, we can \r\nonly seek to control it in a legal and organized fashion, \r\nin a framework of respect for the human rights and \r\ndignity of all persons. In the meantime, many people \r\ncould benefit from this situation, through remittances, \r\nthe creation of networks of contacts and cooperation, \r\ncapacity-building in human resources, technology \r\ntransfer and diverse forms of collaboration and \r\nexchange. \r\n In another regard, the serious events that recently \r\ntook place in the Middle East have filled us with alarm \r\nand consternation. They are a dramatic reminder that \r\ntensions affecting the peace of entire regions still \r\npersist. As with other conflicts, the dispute between \r\nIsrael and its neighbours can be resolved only through \r\ndialogue and the good offices of the United Nations, \r\nwhich recently achieved the cessation of hostilities \r\nbetween the two disputing parties. We are confident \r\nthat a definitive peace will prevail in this region and \r\nallow the development of enhanced levels of \r\nunderstanding, tolerance, and co-existence among its \r\ninhabitants. \r\n The Dominican Republic maintains its interest in \r\nparticipating in the promotion of peacebuilding and \r\nconflict resolution. We reiterate our deep commitment \r\nto the activities and objectives of the United Nations \r\nInternational Research and Training Institute for the \r\nAdvancement of Women (INSTRAW). We consider \r\nthem suitable for the advancement and dignity of all \r\nthe women of the world and, in particular, the women \r\nof countries such as the Dominican Republic. As the \r\nhost country, we warmly appreciate the support of \r\nMember States to INSTRAW. \r\n The Dominican Republic is deeply committed to \r\nre-establishing stability in Haiti, and we applaud the \r\nrecent decision of the Security Council to extend the \r\nmandate of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in \r\nHaiti (MINUSTAH) for six months. The Dominican \r\nRepublic has special interest that there be an increase \r\nof international cooperation aimed at preserving the \r\npace of the reconstruction process of this sister nation. \r\nWith regard to our two countries, our warm relations \r\nare also expressed through the Dominican-Haitian Joint \r\nCommission, a forum which our Governments are \r\nreviving because we recognize it as the most \r\nappropriate mechanism for discussion and for reaching \r\nagreements on many topics of shared concern.  \r\n In conclusion, we wish to see the United Nations \r\nrenew and strengthen itself with a view to playing a \r\nmore active, dynamic and effective role — one that \r\nwould guarantee the realization of the values and \r\nprinciples enshrined in the San Francisco Charter, so as \r\nto ensure that peace on Earth will become the daily \r\nform of existence among human beings.  \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Dominican Republic for the statement \r\nhe has just made.  \r\n Mr. Leonel Fernández Reyna, President of the \r\nDominican Republic, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Boni Yayi, President of the Republic \r\nof Benin \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Benin.  \r\n Mr. Boni Yayi, President of the Republic of Benin, \r\nwas escorted into the General Assembly Hall.  \r\n A/61/PV.13\r\n \r\n13 06-52885 \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Boni Yayi, President of the Republic of Benin, and \r\nto invite him to address the Assembly.  \r\n President Yayi (spoke in French): I am taking \r\npart personally in this session of the General Assembly \r\nin order to reiterate Benin’s commitment to the noble \r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations, and to \r\nexpress the readiness of the Beninese delegation to \r\ncooperate and contribute, as best it can, to the success \r\nof these deliberations.  \r\n But first, allow me, to once again warmly \r\ncongratulate Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa on her \r\nunanimous election to the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-first session, and to express our \r\nappreciation for the remarkable way in which she \r\nguided the work of the High-level Meeting on the \r\nmidterm comprehensive global review of the \r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action for the \r\nLeast Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010.  \r\n I also wish to pay tribute to the remarkable \r\nefforts of her predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Jan \r\nEliasson, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom \r\nof Sweden, who had the weighty task of leading the \r\nsixtieth session of the General Assembly, which was \r\nfocused, essentially, on the implementation of the \r\nmajor decisions taken at the 2005 World Summit.  \r\n Allow me to pay a resounding tribute to my \r\nfriend Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who over the \r\npast 10 years has wisely and skilfully led our \r\nOrganization at a time of new challenges and threats \r\ncreated by changes unprecedented in the history of \r\nhumanity.  \r\n My country, Benin, believes that the future \r\nSecretary-General should come from the continent of \r\nAsia. We hope that the new Secretary-General will be \r\nable to take the measures necessary to lead the \r\nOrganization towards the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs).  \r\n I am pleased to note that the Assembly is already \r\nprogressing in the preparation of this great endeavour: \r\nthe promotion of development is the key issue for the \r\ngeneral debate at the sixty-first session, focusing in \r\naccordance with Ms. Al-Khalifa’s proposal, on the \r\nestablishment of a global partnership for development. \r\nMy country, the Republic of Benin, joins in this debate \r\nwith the conviction that we will make significant \r\nprogress in finding pragmatic ways of fulfilling the \r\ncommitments that have been adopted on many \r\noccasions, for the promotion of economic and social \r\ndevelopment throughout the world.  \r\n The question of development is at the heart of the \r\nmission of the United Nations. In the Charter, Members \r\nproclaimed their belief in the equal rights of men and \r\nwomen and of nations large and small. They made the \r\ncommitment to use international institutions in order to \r\nencourage economic and social progress for all people.  \r\n Hence, reform of the United Nations, if it is to be \r\nviable and effective, must also help ensure that our \r\nOrganization can do better as a framework and an \r\ninstrument for development through the promotion of \r\nthe well-being of the poorest of our planet, ensuring \r\nthe economic growth of the most vulnerable members \r\nof the community of nations, in particular the least \r\ndeveloped countries.  \r\n Financing for development is a factor on which \r\ngenuine partnership needs to be built between donor \r\ncountries and developing countries. In this context, the \r\nMonterrey Consensus, as members know, continues to \r\nbe relevant. It is good to note that some donor \r\ncountries have achieved the objective of allocating \r\n0.7 per cent of their gross national income to official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) for developing \r\ncountries, with 0.2 per cent earmarked for least \r\ndeveloped countries. It is also important to encourage \r\nthose who have already established a specific timetable \r\nfor achieving those objectives. Given the inadequacy \r\nof official development assistance, it is important to \r\nexamine new sources of financing for development \r\nactivities, and some are already doing so. I would like \r\nto take this opportunity to welcome the proposals that \r\nhave been made by some countries, such as the French \r\nRepublic and President Jacques Chirac. \r\n Identifying new sources of financing thus \r\ndeserves special attention. We are pleased that \r\nmobilizing the remittances of migrant workers can in \r\nsome respects also contribute to development action. \r\nNonetheless, it is important to facilitate those transfers \r\nso that they can effectively contribute to improving the \r\nliving conditions of the beneficiary populations and \r\ntheir impact on poverty reduction can be maximized. \r\nBut it should be stressed that the resources that come \r\nfrom remittances by migrant workers cannot be \r\nA/61/PV.13  \r\n \r\n06-52885 14 \r\n \r\nconsidered part of ODA and should not be included in \r\nODA calculations. \r\n We must also mobilize resources through \r\nmicrocredits for the poorest sectors. The support of the \r\ninternational community should contribute to \r\nstrengthening microcredit systems, which could be \r\nextremely useful in the context of efforts to counteract \r\nunemployment among young people and to promote \r\nthe empowerment of women in order to improve their \r\nliving conditions and enhance their contribution to the \r\nnational income of the countries concerned. \r\n We must ensure the full insertion of developing \r\ncountries, particularly the least advanced, into \r\ninternational trade so that they can be sure that, \r\nthrough that mechanism appropriate resources for \r\nfinancing their development are mobilized. Here we \r\nexpress our disappointment at the failure of the \r\nmultilateral trade negotiations in the framework of the \r\nDoha Round. Among other reasons, they floundered \r\nbecause of the crucial question of agricultural \r\nsubsidies, which are stifling the producers in \r\ndeveloping countries. My country, Benin, will continue \r\nto work with other affected countries to ensure the \r\nabolition of those subsidies. or at least to get \r\ncompensations equal to the harm we suffer. \r\n In order to promote development, our countries \r\nare seeking to implement democratic reforms. \r\nHowever, as I said at the opening session of the \r\nmeeting of the least developed countries, any \r\ndemocracy that does not go hand in hand with \r\ndevelopment is doomed to fail. Also, our efforts to \r\npromote development will not bear fruit if we do not \r\nsucceed in maintaining peace in our own countries and \r\nthroughout the world. \r\n That is why in 2005 Benin, while it was on the \r\nSecurity Council, sought to contribute to the efforts to \r\nenhance the effectiveness of that body in preventing \r\narmed conflicts. We welcome the Secretary-General’s \r\nprompt action through the inspired and wise \r\nrecommendations he recently submitted on questions \r\nrelated to the prevention of conflicts. Resolving \r\nvarious conflicts enables the affected developing \r\ncountries to resolutely get themselves back on the track \r\nof reconstruction and national development. \r\n From this rostrum, my country pays tribute to the \r\ndecisive action being taken by the United Nations in \r\nthe area of peacekeeping, and we repeat that we are \r\nwilling to contribute actively to it. The Government of \r\nBenin is ready to continue participating in \r\npeacekeeping operations in order to allow peoples \r\naffected by armed conflicts to overcome them and to \r\ncreate the conditions for stability that are necessary to \r\nensure the reconstruction of their countries and their \r\neconomic and social development. \r\n For us in Benin, another word for peace is \r\ndevelopment. This is the message that I wished to \r\nbring, on behalf of the people of Benin and of the least \r\ndeveloped countries, during this general debate. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Benin for the statement he \r\nhas just made. \r\n Mr. Boni Yayi, President of the Republic of Benin, \r\nwas escorted from the General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, President of \r\nthe United Republic of Tanzania \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe United Republic of Tanzania. \r\n Mr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, President of the \r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania, was escorted into \r\nthe General Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, President of the United \r\nRepublic of Tanzania, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly. \r\n President Kikwete: Permit me to begin by \r\ncongratulating Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed \r\nAl-Khalifa on her well deserved election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \r\nsession. This is an important milestone on the gender \r\nagenda of the United Nations. I wish her great success \r\nand assure her of Tanzania’s full support and \r\ncooperation as she discharges her duties.  \r\n I would also like to commend her predecessor, \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson, for his able \r\nstewardship of the Assembly’s sixtieth session. Under \r\nhis leadership, Tanzania was privileged to co-chair, \r\nwith Denmark, negotiations that led to the \r\noperationalization of the Peacebuilding Commission. \r\n A/61/PV.13\r\n \r\n15 06-52885 \r\n \r\n I stand before this Assembly as the fourth \r\nPresident of my country, Tanzania, following another \r\nsuccessful democratic election last year. This is the \r\nthird smooth transition of power in Tanzania. I took \r\nover from my eminent predecessor in office, His \r\nExcellency Benjamin William Mkapa, who has \r\nremained active both at home and abroad. He remains \r\nmy useful and wise counsel, as does his predecessor \r\nHis Excellency Ali Hassan Mwinyi. Among the many \r\nfunctions that former President Mkapa continues to \r\ndischarge for our country and the human family as a \r\nwhole is his membership in the Secretary-General’s \r\nHigh-level Panel on System-Wide Coherence, which is \r\nan important task on our agenda for the reform of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n Such was the success of the previous \r\nadministration that I can only come before you with \r\none central message — a message of policy continuity, \r\nnationally, regionally and internationally. \r\n We will continue the efforts of the previous \r\nadministration to promote peace, stability and national \r\nunity. In addition, we shall redouble our efforts to \r\nuphold and strengthen good democratic governance, \r\nrespect for human rights and the rule of law, and \r\nintensify the fight against corruption. We feel greatly \r\nhonoured in this regard that the Global Organization of \r\nParliamentarians Against Corruption decided to hold \r\nits second global conference in Arusha in two days’ \r\ntime, in recognition and support of our efforts. \r\n Tanzania also made impressive economic strides, \r\nmaking it one of the fastest growing economies in \r\nAfrica. I intend to sustain and enhance that record with \r\ngreater zeal, vigour and speed. \r\n Similarly, Tanzania has emerged as one of the \r\nbest-practice cases in terms of ownership of the \r\ndevelopment agenda and the harmonization and \r\ncoordination of development assistance. I will advance \r\nthis policy and practice during my tenure in the hope \r\nthat it will contribute to the realization of the theme of \r\nthis General Assembly: the implementation of a global \r\npartnership for development. \r\n In view of this record, and given our political and \r\nmacro-economic stability and political will, Tanzania is \r\nnow well poised to accelerate the pace towards the \r\nattainment of the Millennium Development Goals. For \r\nthis to happen, however, we need international support \r\nto upgrade our infrastructure and build capacity for \r\nvalue-addition processes and human resource \r\ndevelopment. Fortunately, the framework for such \r\ninternational support already exists, for example \r\nthrough the Monterrey Consensus. I believe Tanzania \r\nhas lived up to its commitment under the Global \r\nCompact for development. I now call upon our \r\ndevelopment partners to do likewise. \r\n Cognizant of the role of the private sector as the \r\nengine of growth in Tanzania, we have implemented \r\nfar-reaching policies and institutional reforms geared \r\nto creating an environment conducive to the thriving of \r\nprivate business. \r\n The World Bank’s “Doing Business 2007” report \r\nrecognizes Tanzania as one of the top-ten best \r\nreforming countries in the world. That means that \r\nTanzania has again fulfilled its commitments under the \r\nGlobal Compact. We therefore call upon our \r\ndevelopment partners to buttress our efforts and assist \r\nthe private sector in responding positively. \r\n The success of whatever we try to do nationally \r\ndepends critically on a peaceful neighbourhood. For \r\ntoo long, Tanzania has suffered from the consequences \r\nof conflict and instability in the Great Lakes region, \r\nincluding hosting hundreds of thousands of refugees \r\nand the destruction of infrastructure and the \r\nenvironment, and in terms of time and resources \r\ndeployed in facilitating conflict resolution. For this \r\nreason, Tanzania will continue to play its part in the \r\nquest for peace, security, stability and development in \r\nthe Great Lakes region. \r\n Significant progress has been achieved in the \r\npolitical and security situation in the Great Lakes \r\nregion. We appreciate the support of the United \r\nNations and other partners in the regional peace \r\nprocesses. Tanzania welcomes and commends the \r\nGovernment of Burundi and the Parti pour la libération \r\ndu peuple hutu-Forces nationales de libération rebel \r\ngroup for finally signing the ceasefire agreement. We \r\nare humbled that we could be given an opportunity to \r\nmake our contribution. We promise to continue to be \r\nuseful in whatever way may be required.  \r\n Likewise, I commend the Government, the major \r\npolitical actors and the people of the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo for holding the long-awaited \r\nelections. We urge that the forthcoming second round \r\nof elections be conducted in a free, fair and peaceful \r\nmanner. Tanzania, as Chair of the Southern African \r\nDevelopment Community Organ on Politics, Defence \r\nand Security, will play its role in support of this \r\nA/61/PV.13  \r\n \r\n06-52885 16 \r\n \r\nprocess. As a friendly neighbour, we will endeavour to \r\nbe as useful as is necessary.  \r\n Moreover, Tanzania, as current chair of the \r\nInitiative for Peace and Security in the Great Lakes \r\nRegion, will continue to work closely with other \r\nmembers to ensure a successful Second International \r\nConference on the Great Lakes Region later this year \r\nin Nairobi. \r\n I wish to put on record our sincere gratitude to \r\nthe Group of Friends of the Great Lakes Region for \r\ntheir support. I appeal to them and the international \r\ncommunity to remain engaged with this process. \r\n Peace seems to have eluded the world. Reports of \r\nwars and violent conflicts are headline news in most of \r\nour media. Unfortunately Africa, the poorest of the \r\ncontinents, has had an unfair share of conflict. Like \r\nother delegates, we express our concern for the security \r\nand humanitarian situation in Darfur, and call for \r\ncontinued engagement at the regional level and by the \r\ninternational community. Likewise, we are deeply \r\nconcerned about the situation in Somalia, Côte d’Ivoire \r\nand elsewhere on the continent. \r\n The continuing impasse on the issue of the \r\nWestern Sahara is unfortunate. After 31 years, it is high \r\ntime that the United Nations redouble its efforts to \r\nresolve this matter. The United Nations resolved the \r\nquestion of East Timor, which has a lot of similarities \r\nto that of the Saharans. The people of Western Sahara \r\ndeserve no less from their United Nations. I believe it \r\ncould be done if all parties played their part \r\nappropriately. \r\n Turning to the situation in the Middle East, I am \r\npleased to see the ceasefire between Israel and \r\nLebanon holding, and troop contributing countries \r\nresponding positively in reinforcing the United Nations \r\nInterim Force in Lebanon. \r\n The 34-day war in Lebanon took international \r\nattention away from the plight of the Palestinian \r\npeople. The lack of progress towards a negotiated two-\r\nState solution and the decline in confidence in the \r\npeace process are worrying developments. We call \r\nupon the Quartet, and encourage bilateral and other \r\nmultilateral initiatives, to revive the peace process laid \r\ndown in the road map. A just, viable, lasting and \r\ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East can come only \r\nthrough negotiations, and no other way. \r\n Tanzania welcomes and applauds the adoption by \r\nthe General Assembly of a comprehensive Global \r\nCounter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288). It is \r\nour expectation that the differences that arose during \r\nthe negotiations will not stand in the way of the \r\nStrategy’s implementation. After experiencing a major \r\nterrorist attack on our soil in 1998, Tanzania has \r\nalways repeated its resolve to cooperate with others to \r\ncombat terrorism in all its manifestations. The threat of \r\nterrorism is global and complex; it demands our \r\ncollective efforts and an adaptive strategy to contain it. \r\nThank God we already have that strategy — let us \r\nimplement it.  \r\n Tanzania has always stood for the sovereign \r\nequality of nations and for the primacy of \r\nmultilateralism in global governance and in addressing \r\nglobal issues. We have always cherished and stood for \r\nthe central role of the United Nations in global affairs. \r\nWe promise to continue to be faithful and responsible \r\nmembers of the United Nations. It is now our intention \r\nto participate more actively in United Nations \r\npeacekeeping missions and operations. \r\n We have always believed that the United Nations \r\nof today has to reflect, in its structure, policies, \r\nprogrammes and activities, the realities of the world of \r\ntoday, not that of sixty years ago. The United Nations \r\nhas to move with the changing times and aspirations of \r\nits membership. I want to reaffirm Tanzania’s \r\ncontinued commitment to these urgent and legitimate \r\ndemands. We are very much committed to the reform \r\nagenda of the United Nations, especially reform of the \r\nSecurity Council to make it more representative and \r\nmore responsive to changing realities. \r\n Tanzania’s term as a non-permanent member of \r\nthe Security Council will end in three months. I would \r\nlike to thank all members for having accorded my \r\ncountry the honour of serving in that very important \r\nUnited Nations organ. We thank our fellow Council \r\nmembers for their cooperation and support during our \r\nterm of office. As we prepare to leave the Council, we \r\nare gratified that we were able to organize a special \r\nCouncil meeting to discuss the situation in the Great \r\nLakes region at which useful conclusions and decisions \r\nwere made. \r\n As we prepare to leave the Council, we are also \r\ngratified that we have taken note of the feeling in the \r\nCouncil of the need to reform that body. Let us pluck \r\nup courage and take the bull by the horns.  \r\n A/61/PV.13\r\n \r\n17 06-52885 \r\n \r\n Allow me to pay special tribute to our outgoing, \r\nillustrious Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan — a \r\ngreat internationalist and a great statesman. We \r\ncongratulate him for a job well done and for his able \r\nleadership during a particularly difficult period for the \r\nworld, for the United Nations and for him, personally. \r\nHe will be remembered as one who challenged the \r\nOrganization to live up to the true promise of \r\nmultilateralism, through delivering collective security, \r\npursuing fundamental human rights and the rule of law \r\nand promoting human development. We thank him and \r\nwish him the best of luck on his retirement. I hope that \r\nhe will be given time to retire. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the United Republic of Tanzania for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, President of the \r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania, was escorted from \r\nthe General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Hifikepunye Pohamba, President of \r\nthe Republic of Namibia \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Namibia. \r\n Mr. Hifikepunye Pohamba, President of the \r\nRepublic of Namibia, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Hifikepunye Pohamba, President of the Republic \r\nof Namibia, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Pohamba: I should like at the outset to \r\ncongratulate Ms. Al-Khalifa on her well-deserved \r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty first session. I am confident that, given her \r\nwisdom and experience, she will steer the proceedings \r\nof the Assembly successfully. I also express our \r\nprofound appreciation to her predecessor, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Jan Eliasson of Sweden, for his \r\nexcellent work during the sixtieth session. \r\n In the same vein, we salute the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, for his \r\ndedication and commitment to the work of the United \r\nNations. My delegation would like to pay him special \r\ntribute for his distinguished leadership and remarkable \r\ncontribution to the United Nations, taking into \r\nconsideration his imminent departure at the end of a \r\nlong, dedicated and brilliant career in the service of our \r\nOrganization. Under his leadership, the United Nations \r\nhas recorded significant achievements. He ably laid the \r\nfoundation for Member States to make further \r\nprogress, especially with regard to the reform of the \r\nUnited Nations. We will carry on with this task, \r\nbearing in mind his vision of sustained global \r\ncooperation among States. Allow me to wish him the \r\nvery best in his future engagements. \r\n We are gathered here to reaffirm our faith in the \r\nUnited Nations and to recommit ourselves to the \r\npurposes and principles of the Charter. Today, the \r\nworld needs a stronger United Nations and effective \r\nmultilateralism that reflects current realities. Only thus \r\nwill humanity be able to respond in a timely manner \r\nand without hesitation to the global challenges that we \r\nface. \r\n We fully support the comprehensive reform of the \r\nUnited Nations as proposed by the Secretary-General. \r\nThe reforms should aim at strengthening the \r\nOrganization and making it more efficient, effective \r\nand responsive to the needs of all its Members. We \r\nfurther attach great importance to strengthening the \r\nrole and authority of the General Assembly as the main \r\ndeliberative and policy-making body, whose \r\nrelationship with other principal organs should be \r\nplaced in a fitting context so as to ensure cooperation \r\nand respect for their roles as provided for in the \r\nCharter. \r\n My Government believes that the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council, including its expansion, is essential. \r\nThe African continent deserves to be fairly and \r\nequitably represented in the Council. That is not too \r\nmuch to ask. \r\n During the World Summit in September last year, \r\nwe reaffirmed our commitment to the Millennium \r\nDeclaration (resolution 55/2), adopted more than six \r\nyears ago. The Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1) \r\nreiterated our commitments to the implementation of \r\nthe decisions made during previous conferences and \r\nsummits. My Government appreciates the work done \r\nunder the guidance and able leadership of former \r\nPresident Eliasson in the realization of the Summit \r\ndecisions. \r\nA/61/PV.13  \r\n \r\n06-52885 18 \r\n \r\n The fruits of those efforts are visible to us all, as \r\nthey culminated in the inauguration of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, the creation of the Human \r\nRights Council, the creation of the Central Emergency \r\nResponse Fund and the establishment of the Ethics \r\nOffice. We also welcome the accomplishments in the \r\narea of management reform. People around the world \r\nhave high hopes that these newly created instruments \r\nwill achieve the specific mandates set for them. We \r\ntherefore encourage all Member States to continue, in \r\nan open and transparent manner, to finalize the review \r\nof the process. \r\n Namibia attaches importance to the global \r\ndevelopment agenda. Thus we are concerned about the \r\nslow pace at which this essential matter is being \r\nhandled and about the lack of adherence to the \r\ncommitments in line with the Millennium Declaration. \r\nIn this regard, I urge all fellow leaders to stand \r\ntogether in finding effective solutions to push back the \r\never-encroaching frontiers of poverty, hunger, disease \r\nand ignorance. \r\n The African people know that they must take a \r\nlead in resolving problems and challenges on the \r\ncontinent. In those endeavours, they need to form \r\neffective partnerships with the international \r\ncommunity. I therefore welcome the commitments \r\nmade by the Group and Eight last year in Scotland to \r\nconsider increasing development aid to Africa, to \r\ncancel the debt owed by the poorest countries and to \r\npromote universal access to antiretroviral drugs for \r\nHIV/AIDS by the year 2010. \r\n We reiterate our call for cooperation among the \r\nUnited Nations, its specialized agencies and the \r\nAfrican Union and its subregional organizations \r\ndealing with economic and social development on the \r\ncontinent. We continue to emphasize the importance of \r\nthe Economic and Social Council as a central \r\nintergovernmental body for promoting a more \r\nintegrated approach to global peace and development. \r\n Namibia welcomes the presidential and \r\nparliamentary elections recently held in the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, which, most international \r\nobservers agree, were conducted in a peaceful and \r\ntransparent atmosphere. We urge the United Nations \r\nand the international community at large to continue to \r\nsupport the people of the Democratic Republic during \r\nthis crucial democratic transition. \r\n The situation in the Darfur region of the Sudan is \r\ncause for serious concern. The African Union, through \r\nthe African Union Mission in Sudan and with the \r\nassistance of the international community, has made \r\nefforts to bring peace to that region under \r\nexceptionally hard conditions. We commend the \r\nAfrican Union Special Envoy, Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim, \r\nfor his tireless efforts in bringing the parties to an \r\nagreement. We urge all the parties to respect their \r\ncommitments.  \r\n We welcome the visit to the Sudan by the United \r\nNations Security Council team in June this year and the \r\nrecommendations they made. Namibia looks forward to \r\nan urgent and smooth transition from the African \r\nUnion Mission to a United Nations peacekeeping \r\nmission in Darfur in accordance with Security Council \r\nresolution 1706 (2006). We urge the Government of the \r\nSudan and other parties concerned to accept this \r\ntransition, which we believe will be in the best interest \r\nof the people of the Sudan in general and those of the \r\nDarfur region in particular. \r\n I would like to join other countries around the \r\nworld in expressing our concern about the illicit trade \r\nin small arms and light weapons, which remains a \r\nmenace to humanity. The proliferation of such weapons \r\ncompromises peace and security. They also pose \r\nserious challenges to law enforcement agencies around \r\nthe world. \r\n We are concerned that the question of Western \r\nSahara remains unresolved. The inalienable rights of \r\nthe people of Western Sahara to self-determination and \r\nindependence must be upheld and respected, as \r\nstipulated in the relevant United Nations resolutions. \r\nWe therefore call for the urgent implementation of all \r\nrelevant Security Council and General Assembly \r\nresolutions, with the aim of holding a free and fair \r\nreferendum in Western Sahara. \r\n Namibia is also deeply concerned about the \r\nongoing suffering of the people of Palestine. We wish \r\nto reaffirm our full and unequivocal support for the \r\ninalienable rights of the Palestinian people to self-\r\ndetermination and national independence. In this \r\ncontext, we appeal to the United Nations to assume its \r\nfull responsibility by implementing all its resolutions \r\nand decisions on Palestine, with immediate effect and \r\nwithout precondition. \r\n Sadly, the people of Lebanon have once again \r\nbeen subjected to war and indiscriminate bombing, \r\n A/61/PV.13\r\n \r\n19 06-52885 \r\n \r\nwhich have caused enormous suffering and the deaths \r\nof innocent people, including children and the elderly, \r\nas well as severe damage to and destruction of property \r\nand infrastructure. Against that background, we call for \r\nthe immediate and unconditional implementation of \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1701 (2006) and appeal to \r\nthe international community to provide humanitarian \r\nassistance to the people of Lebanon in dealing with the \r\nresulting humanitarian crisis. \r\n For many years now, the majority of Member \r\nStates in this Assembly have expressed concern over \r\nthe continuous economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo against Cuba, which continues to cause severe \r\nhardships for the Cuban people. The Government of \r\nthe Republic of Namibia upholds the principles of \r\npeaceful coexistence of nations and fair and open trade \r\namong nations. Thus, we call on all Member States, in \r\nconformity with their obligations under the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations, for an immediate and \r\nunconditional lifting of the embargo against the \r\nRepublic of Cuba, as called for in General Assembly \r\nresolution 60/12 and many previous resolutions. \r\n In June 2006, the General Assembly convened a \r\nHigh-level Meeting on the implementation of the \r\nDeclaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS. That \r\nMeeting served as an important opportunity for \r\nMember States to assess progress and further \r\nstrengthen and expand responses to the HIV/AIDS \r\npandemic. Before the High-level Meeting, the African \r\nUnion had adopted an African Common Position at a \r\nspecial session in Abuja in May 2006. Namibia is fully \r\ncommitted to the implementation of the Declaration of \r\nCommitment on HIV/AIDS. We are, equally, grateful \r\nfor the support for the call to mobilize resources and to \r\nforge a stronger partnership in confronting the \r\npandemic. We stress the need for universal and \r\naffordable access to comprehensive service packages \r\nfor all those infected. \r\n In our ongoing efforts to reform and strengthen \r\nthe United Nations, making it more effective and \r\nresponsive to today’s challenges — poverty and \r\nhunger, the HIV/AIDS pandemic, civil wars and the \r\nwar on terror — we should place human lives and \r\nhuman dignity at the centre of all our efforts. The \r\nreform we have embarked upon should be seen as a \r\nprocess and should be undertaken in a spirit of mutual \r\nunderstanding and with a sense of collective \r\nownership. Let us strive to re-energize the United \r\nNations and make it an Organization that we can all be \r\nproud of, so that we can make planet Earth a common \r\nhome for all humanity to live in peace, stability and \r\nprosperity. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Namibia for the statement \r\nhe has just made. \r\n Mr. Hifikepunye Pohamba, President of the \r\nRepublic of Namibia, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Alfredo Palacio, President of the \r\nRepublic of Ecuador \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Ecuador. \r\n Mr. Alfredo Palacio, President of the Republic of \r\nEcuador, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Alfredo Palacio, President of the Republic of \r\nEcuador, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Palacio (spoke in Spanish): The \r\ntwenty-first century demands that the world develop a \r\nnew vision of the concept of international law and of \r\nrelations among peoples and States. A year ago, \r\nEcuador raised the need to move towards a new world \r\norder built on three bases: the economy, international \r\nlaw and biology. This need has become urgent. We \r\nsummon the planet to establish this new triad, which \r\nmust include biology. \r\n Never before has there been so much wealth. \r\nPoverty, however, continues to grow, and hunger and \r\nmisery take their toll of human lives each day. Life on \r\nEarth is deteriorating. The harmonious continuity of \r\nhumanity is threatened, and the world — including the \r\ndeveloped countries — has not been able to find an \r\nadequate answer. There are still vast areas of \r\nsub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and Asia where \r\nmillions of human beings are on the brink of \r\nextinction. Vast areas continue to require international \r\ncooperation. While in Japan, Hong Kong and Iceland, \r\nlife expectancy at birth exceeds 80 years, in Botswana \r\nand Lesotho it barely reaches 36 years. While in \r\nSweden, Singapore, Denmark, Iceland and Norway, the \r\nA/61/PV.13  \r\n \r\n06-52885 20 \r\n \r\nunder-five mortality rate is below 4 per 1,000 live \r\nbirths, in Sierra Leone, Niger and Liberia it exceeds \r\n235 per 1,000 live births. We must guarantee greater \r\nequity in health expenditure throughout the world in \r\norder to overcome the huge gap between the few \r\ndollars per capita invested in poor countries and the \r\nthousands of dollars per capita that are invested in the \r\ndeveloped world. \r\n Five years have passed since the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals were proclaimed, and very little \r\nhas been done to achieve them. The limited compliance \r\namong the most highly developed countries to \r\ncontribute 0.7 per cent of gross national income to \r\nprogress in the poorest areas has had an adverse impact \r\non this situation. \r\n Underdevelopment is a global problem; just like \r\nthe healthy continuity of our species, which is \r\nthreatened by economic, political and military \r\nproblems. The least developed countries lack resources \r\nto improve education and culture — a requirement for \r\nensuring collective health. The growing burden of \r\nforeign debt prevents our people from investing in their \r\ndevelopment. Underdeveloped countries are still under \r\nthe yoke of external debt service, which continues to \r\nabsorb domestic savings and limits the possibilities for \r\nsocial and productive investment. \r\n Far from resolving the problem, successive debt \r\nrefinancing creates further links that lengthen the chain \r\nshackling development and economic progress, and it \r\nundermines the ethical foundation and the destiny of \r\nhumankind. That is why Ecuador supports the initiative \r\nof the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan to create a group \r\nof highly indebted lower- and middle-income countries \r\nthat together would work to find creative and long-\r\nterm solutions. \r\n The neediest countries are marginalized from \r\ninvestment in scientific research and medical \r\ndiscoveries. \r\n The phenomenon of migration has taken on \r\nunprecedented dimensions. More than 200 million \r\npeople are refugees, living outside their countries of \r\norigin. Migration causes families to break down and \r\nresults in cultural deterioration, hampering the \r\nemergence of future healthy generations and adequate \r\ncare of the elderly in conditions of dignity. \r\n Countries must assume binding commitments on \r\nthe defence of the human rights of migrants. To that \r\nend, we welcome the High-level Dialogue on \r\nInternational Migration and Development — a \r\nmultidimensional event that reflects the political \r\nresolve of sending and receiving countries. \r\n War affects the entire planet. Mortality rates \r\nincrease not only because of its direct victims, but also \r\nbecause of the destruction of infrastructure. Ethnic and \r\nreligious problems, or economic aspirations, lead to \r\ngenocidal practices. World peace, respect for human \r\nrights and respect among States are the principles that \r\nled to the founding of the United Nations. \r\n Transfixed, the world has witnessed bloodshed \r\nand brutal acts of violence against peoples as a \r\nconsequence of the settlement of conflicts through the \r\nuse of weapons, and of the limited ability of the \r\ninternational community within the United Nations to \r\nfind solutions within the framework of the law. \r\n We support the resolution adopted by the Security \r\nCouncil — and the efforts of the Secretary-General — \r\nto ensure a commitment by all parties involved to \r\ncomply with the ceasefire and to withdraw their forces \r\nto the borders established before the last confrontation. \r\n The international community and the highest \r\nmultilateral bodies have been unable to find diplomatic \r\nmeans of resolving such conflicts swiftly and \r\neffectively. Thus there needs to be an improvement in \r\nthe structure of these bodies, including the United \r\nNations system itself. \r\n The Security Council is no longer an expression \r\nof a global balance. Today, it represents only itself. For \r\nthat reason, it must be reformed and democratized. It is \r\nunacceptable that, at the dawn of the third millennium, \r\nthe lives of millions of human beings and of entire \r\npopulations hinge on the veto of one State or another \r\nand on a unilateral geopolitical vision. \r\n The concepts of war and peace are once again at \r\nthe heart of our reflection on global security and \r\nsurvival. The security of the planet, of peoples, of \r\nStates and of nations will be sustainable only if it is \r\nfounded on health, on education, on development and \r\non peace. \r\n Laying the foundations of genuine peace is the \r\ngreatest moral obligation of all of humankind. The \r\nalternative is growing insecurity, fuelled by poverty, \r\nillness, destitution and fear. \r\n A/61/PV.13\r\n \r\n21 06-52885 \r\n \r\n The creation of the Peacebuilding Commission \r\nand the inception of the Human Rights Council, of \r\nwhich Ecuador is member, and the reforms that are \r\nbeing launched in the Secretariat and in the \r\nadministrative bodies of the United Nations represent \r\nsignificant steps forward, but they still fall short. \r\n My country, Ecuador, believes that the reform of \r\nthe system includes strengthening the World Health \r\nOrganization, its leadership and its fight against \r\npoverty and the environmental impact of poverty, in \r\nthe promotion of local, national and regional initiatives \r\naimed at implementing a fully decentralized global \r\nhealth system. That will make possible enable the \r\ndevelopment of health systems and models capable of \r\nensuring tangible benefits for all inhabitants of the \r\nplanet. \r\n Universal health insurance is a valid strategy to \r\nguarantee access to a comprehensive health-care \r\nsystem among developing nations at the same level as \r\nin developed countries. That would eliminate the \r\nshameful asymmetry that is reflected in the unbalanced \r\nhealth statistics that differentiate the various segments \r\nof our populations. \r\n In order to implement these and other important \r\nhealth programmes, considerable financial resources \r\nmust be mobilized, which must flow from international \r\ncooperation, but also from developing countries and \r\nthe so-called donor countries. \r\n In this century, compliance with the Millennium \r\nGoals is State policy for the Government of Ecuador. \r\nFor a multinational, pluricultural and multi-ethnic \r\ncountry such as Ecuador, ensuring respect for human \r\nrights means, above all, respect for the other; respect \r\nfor the development of indigenous peoples, with full \r\nrecognition of their diversity and of their need to be \r\nintegrated into the process of modernization, while \r\npreserving their identity. \r\n Ecuador welcomes the recent adoption by the \r\nHuman Rights Council of the Declaration on the Rights \r\nof Indigenous Peoples and fully supports its adoption \r\nby the Assembly. \r\n We reaffirm our commitment to fight crimes of \r\nthe utmost gravity, such as trafficking in human beings \r\nand the sexual exploitation of boys and girls. This year \r\nwe have strengthened our domestic legislation to \r\npunish such crimes. The Government of Ecuador has \r\nundertaken economic policy measures to recover \r\nincome from petroleum operations. That will enable us \r\nto engage in sustainable and productive social \r\ninvestment, thus improving living conditions for \r\nunderprivileged Ecuadorians. As a result of those \r\nmeasures, for the first time in Ecuador, funds are \r\navailable for scientific and technological research to \r\npromote knowledge so that we can be masters of our \r\nown destiny.  \r\n Ecuador is committed to strengthening South-\r\nSouth relations. We attach great importance to regional \r\nintegration, in particular through the Andean \r\nCommunity of Nations and the Common Market of the \r\nSouth, which are key actors in building the South \r\nAmerican Community of Nations to make progress \r\ntowards Latin American integration, hemispheric \r\nintegration and, ultimately, a globalization that has a \r\nhuman face and is equitable for all.  \r\n Ecuador promotes all the conditions necessary to \r\nreach trade agreements with all countries throughout \r\nthe world, based on principles that respect the \r\npreservation of sensitive areas of national production, \r\nensure food security and protect biological diversity \r\nand genetic data — that is to say, life.  \r\n Ecuador has consistently fought narco-trafficking \r\nand related crimes. That is why we believe that we are \r\nfully entitled to ask the United States Senate to renew \r\nthe Andean Trade Preference Act to encourage legal \r\nproduction and exports.  \r\n Ecuador endorses the principles that guided the \r\nestablishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO). \r\nWe hope that the obstacles faced by the Doha round \r\nwill be successfully overcome to ensure its full \r\nvalidity, particularly with respect to the elimination of \r\nexport subsidies for agricultural products.  \r\n Our relations with Mexico, Central America and \r\nthe Caribbean are particularly important. At the same \r\ntime, we are seeking dynamic relationships with \r\ncountries of the Pacific rim and throughout the world. \r\n Within the framework of the South American \r\nCommunity of Nations, we are beginning to engage in \r\nregional meetings with Arab and African countries to \r\nstrengthen political dialogue, cooperation and mutual \r\ntrade. Ecuador was greatly pleased to welcome \r\nministers for finance and related areas from Arab and \r\nSouth American countries in order to jointly formulate \r\na strategy for strengthening our economic, trade and \r\ninvestment relationships. With regard to African \r\nA/61/PV.13  \r\n \r\n06-52885 22 \r\n \r\nnations, my country will participate at the highest level \r\nin the summit to be held in Nigeria this November.  \r\n Ecuador also attaches great importance to \r\npolitical coordination mechanisms such as the Group \r\nof 77 and the Non-Aligned Movement, whose summit \r\nwas held recently.  \r\n To conclude, I wish to express my sincere thanks \r\nto the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his \r\noutstanding work at the head of the Organization \r\ndespite the enormous difficulties he was obliged to \r\nface, including those of a financial nature. The world is \r\nconfident that the new Secretary-General will be able \r\nto continue that work and to implement the processes \r\nof United Nations reform, with the commitment of all \r\nits Members, particularly the most highly developed \r\ncountries. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Ecuador for the statement \r\nhe has just made. \r\n Mr. Alfredo Palacio, President of the Republic of \r\nEcuador, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.  \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Equatorial Guinea.  \r\n Mr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, President \r\nof the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, was \r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency  \r\nMr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, President of \r\nthe Republic of Equatorial Guinea, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly. \r\n President Obiang Nguema Mbasogo (spoke in \r\nSpanish): Equatorial Guinea is participating in the \r\ndebates of the sixty-first session of the General \r\nAssembly in the firm conviction that this world \r\nOrganization remains the only forum with the authority \r\nnecessary to resolve any situation facing the \r\ninternational community. Attempting to usurp that \r\nauthority is irrational; it means negating the universal \r\nprinciples of international law, which govern our world \r\nwith justice and equity.  \r\n That is why, before addressing any of the issues \r\non our agenda, I wish to pay a well-deserved tribute to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General, \r\nand to His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson, President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixtieth session, for the \r\narduous task that they accomplished in the face of the \r\nconflicts that have threatened the peace and stability of \r\nthe planet during 2006. \r\n We should also like to welcome the election of \r\nHer Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, \r\nLegal Adviser to the Royal Court of Bahrain, who will \r\npreside over the General Assembly at this session. We \r\nbelieve that her election is an implicit recognition of \r\nthe seriousness, dedication and dynamism that \r\ncharacterize her country’s quest for global equilibrium \r\nand its respect for the principles of international law, \r\nhuman freedom, the right of peoples to self-\r\ndetermination, national independence and sovereignty, \r\nmutual respect among nations, and international \r\ncooperation to promote development and respect for \r\nhuman rights. \r\n This session opens at a time of uncertainty for \r\nhumanity, due to the many conflicts and the increasing \r\nsocio-political imbalance threatening the lives of \r\nmillions of people throughout the world. Humanity \r\ntoday finds itself in a complex situation that raises \r\nseveral questions. \r\n What is the current role of the United Nations, \r\ngiven the absence of priorities in its decision-making \r\nprocess? What has been gained since the end of the \r\ncold war? What kind of future can humanity hope for \r\nin a world of so-called globalization, governed by a \r\npolitical and economic system characterized by \r\ninequality and a lack of cooperation in eradicating \r\npoverty in the weakest nations? What kind of future is \r\nthere for the developing countries when the gap in the \r\nacquisition of technology for development continues to \r\ngrow, or when sprawling intelligence services are \r\nconstantly devising plans to keep the world under the \r\npolitical dominance and economic influence of the \r\nmost powerful nations? \r\n Those and similar questions must be the focus of \r\nattention of politicians and this world body if we are to \r\nstraighten this crooked path in international relations. \r\nPresently, there is no judge capable of adjudicating any \r\ninternational conflict equitably and impartially. From \r\n A/61/PV.13\r\n \r\n23 06-52885 \r\n \r\nour point of view, the authority of the United Nations \r\nhas been taken hostage by certain interests that are \r\nmonopolizing the world. Nevertheless, I am convinced \r\nthat we still have time to rescue the situation if we do \r\nnot wish to see the international community completely \r\nderailed, because the results obtained to date are not \r\nsatisfactory. \r\n We must first democratize this world \r\nOrganization by reinstating its rightful authority on the \r\ninternational scene. We must also set an objective \r\nvalue to the globalization of politics by adopting new, \r\nequitable political and economic strategies to protect \r\nthe legitimate interests of the weakest States. If we do \r\nnot, we must be prepared to endure a world crisis as a \r\nresult of our inability to sustain the current pressures \r\nand jarring disparities among nations. \r\n Many conferences held in various political, \r\neconomic and social forums have identified a number \r\nof strategies to reduce the gap that separates us all, but \r\nsuch strategies have always been met with the \r\ncomplete indifference of those who are supposed to \r\nexecute them. \r\n We ought not be surprised, then, by the \r\nphenomenon of terrorism that threatens the world \r\ntoday, because, although its methods and destructive \r\neffects on humans are condemnable, it remains the \r\nrecourse of the oppressed and a reaction of those who \r\noppose prevailing injustices that have been denounced \r\nthroughout the last quarter of a century. \r\n The ongoing mass migration of peoples from the \r\nSouth to the North is another consequence of the huge \r\nimbalance caused by the present unjust international \r\neconomic system. That migration will never cease if \r\nthe North does not help the South to develop with \r\nprogrammes of support and solidarity. \r\n We would like to see democracy, equity and \r\nsolidarity in a more harmonious world become the rule \r\nthat would enable international relations to function, \r\nespecially those governed by the Bretton Woods \r\ninstitutions, the World Trade Organization, the \r\nrelationship between the European Union and the \r\nnations of the African, Caribbean and the Pacific, and \r\nall other economic relations between the North and the \r\nSouth. \r\n Moreover, nature has endowed the world with \r\nimmense natural resources that are perfectly sufficient \r\nto allow all to live in dignity. We do not have to resort \r\nto draconian rules of exchange that favour some and \r\ndiscriminate against others. Those who seek to \r\nmonopolize resources that belong to humanity and who \r\nstill believe in the larceny of the past, or rather in their \r\nown ability to perpetuate illegal exploitation by force, \r\nare the same people who today support and maintain \r\nvast mercenary organizations that fall upon the weaker \r\nnations in order to create internal political instabilities \r\nfor their own selfish interests. \r\n Indeed, my country has been a victim of such \r\nplotting because we own crude oil, the product that is \r\ntoday dividing and destroying the world. My country \r\nwas able to avert a mercenary invasion on 6 March, \r\n2004, that was organized by powerful countries that \r\ncontinue to dispute among themselves and to nurture \r\nambitions to gain free control of the world’s petroleum. \r\nFortunately, our security services were alerted in time \r\nand were able to prevent the anticipated genocide. \r\nThose directly responsible for the attempted coup are \r\nserving time in prison, while the brains behind the \r\nwhole thing are still at large and thumb their noses at \r\njustice. \r\n Nevertheless, my Government does not believe \r\nthat this natural resource belongs to us alone. My \r\ncountry benefits from barely 30 per cent of the \r\nproceeds from that exploitation, because, as we have \r\nexplained time and again, due to an unjust system of \r\nexchange, the operating contracts give the lion’s share \r\nof those profits to our partners of the North. \r\n In that regard, I noted at the sixtieth session of \r\nthe General Assembly that if the responsibility of \r\ntransparency is to be borne equitably, there is a need to \r\ndemand the same from the operators of the extracting \r\nindustries and compliance with the contracts and \r\nregulations that guarantee equal benefits between the \r\nparties concerned. \r\n To conclude, the message from Equatorial Guinea \r\nis that we must respond as human beings, because we \r\nstill have time to make this planet Earth a better place \r\nfor human beings. Therefore, let us turn our backs on \r\ngreed, hegemonic ambition and the lack of sensitivity \r\nto the sight of such horror and misery that is rife in our \r\nworld, so that we can respond to this system of \r\ninjustice and inequality, and so that, as human beings, \r\nwe will be able to join hands and face, with solidarity, \r\nintelligence and wisdom, the challenge to spare \r\nhumanity from the scourges of war, poverty and \r\nunderdevelopment. \r\nA/61/PV.13  \r\n \r\n06-52885 24 \r\n \r\n The Acting President: (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, President \r\nof the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, was \r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Alfred Moisiu, President of the \r\nRepublic of Albania \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Albania. \r\n Mr. Alfred Moisiu, President of the Republic of \r\nAlbania, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency Mr. \r\nAlfred Moisiu, President of the Republic of Albania, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Moisiu (spoke in Albanian; English \r\ntext provided by the delegation): I would like first of \r\nall to congratulate President Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa \r\non her election to her high post and to assure her of \r\nAlbania’s full support throughout her mandate. I would \r\nalso like to express our deep appreciation to the \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his continuous \r\nvision, leadership and efforts to revitalize and reform \r\nthe United Nations. \r\n This year, based on the 2005 Summit Document, \r\nAlbania has undertaken concrete actions to promote the \r\nthree main pillars, namely, development, security and \r\nhuman rights, in order to implement the ambitious \r\nUnited Nations agenda of reforms. We are filled with \r\noptimism at the positive results achieved by the \r\nestablishment of the Peacebuilding Commission, the \r\nHuman Rights Council and the Central Emergency \r\nResponse Fund. Reform of the Secretariat and \r\nmanagement also give us optimism and lead us to \r\nbelieve that the United Nations must continue these \r\nreforms in order to respond in the best possible way to \r\nnew realities and challenges. \r\n We reiterate our willingness and intent to work \r\nclosely with all delegations and to reach as much \r\nagreement as possible by consensus in all significant \r\naspects of the reforms and we believe that solid and \r\ninclusive management reform is needed for the \r\nstrengthening of the United Nations in order to \r\nincrease transparency and responsibility and achieve a \r\nmore effective and efficient administration of \r\nresources. We support the efforts to reform the \r\nEconomic and Social Council, while we also believe \r\nthat reform in the Security Council will produce \r\nprogress and results, thanks to the efforts and \r\ncommitment of all member countries. \r\n We welcome the High-level Meeting on \r\nInternational Migration and Development, because we \r\nbelieve that international migration that is supported by \r\nthe right policies can bring major advantages to the \r\ndevelopment of the countries of origin and destination, \r\nin terms of respecting and guaranteeing the basic rights \r\nof migrants, while avoiding discrimination and double \r\nstandards. \r\n The United Nations role also continues to remain \r\nvery important in the war against terrorism, especially \r\nin securing an effective, global and intensive response \r\nto this threat. We praise the recent consensual adoption \r\nof the Global Strategy against Terrorism. We also feel \r\nthat the adoption of a comprehensive convention on \r\ninternational terrorism would represent a precious \r\nachievement furthering United Nations efforts to \r\ncombat terrorism. Albania is collaborating very closely \r\nwith all the United Nations bodies in the war against \r\nterrorism, and the visits of the Monitoring Team, \r\nestablished pursuant to Security Council resolution \r\n1267 (1999), and the visit of the Security Council \r\nCounter-Terrorism Committee, established pursuant to \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1540 (2004), demonstrate \r\nthat Albania is fulfilling its obligations to prevent the \r\nactivity and financing of terrorist groups at the national \r\nlevel. \r\n We have supported Security Council resolution \r\n1701 (2006) on the Israeli-Lebanon conflict, which \r\nprovides for a peaceful solution of the issue and the \r\nsending of peacekeeping forces to that area. Albania \r\nhas joined other countries in giving financial support to \r\nrebuild Lebanon. \r\n The main orientation of Albania’s foreign policy \r\nremains European and Euro-Atlantic integration, and \r\nthat is why the efforts of the Albanian State and society \r\nare directed towards meeting European Union and \r\nNATO standards. A few days ago, the European \r\nParliament ratified the Stabilization and Association \r\nAgreement between Albania and the European Union, \r\n A/61/PV.13\r\n \r\n25 06-52885 \r\n \r\nwhich places our country at the most important  \r\nstage — that of fulfilling the obligations that stem from \r\nthe Agreement, and all Albanian political groups and \r\nthe entire society are conscious of this. We all believe \r\nthat actual membership in the European Council and \r\nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in \r\nEurope, and the prospective accession to the EU and \r\nNATO are part of the natural move towards \r\ndevelopment, rather than an objective per se. \r\n We have established relations based on active \r\ncooperation and dialogue at the regional level with all \r\nthe countries concerned by actively working to \r\nstrengthen regional security and stability. Together \r\nwith the countries of the region, we have created an \r\nagenda of joint action against terrorism, organized \r\ncrime, the circulation of arms and border management. \r\nIn the same way, we have undertaken concrete \r\ninitiatives to encourage economic development in the \r\nregion. \r\n Albania believes that the main issue to be \r\nresolved in our region continues to be that of Kosovo. \r\nKosovo has made great progress in terms of internal \r\nstability; advancing the fulfilment of the required \r\ninternational standards; improving inter-ethnic \r\nrelations; establishing and efficiently running central \r\nand local Kosovar institutions; its serious and \r\nprofessional commitment to the process of negotiations \r\nwith Belgrade through the intermediary of the Special \r\nEnvoy of the Secretary-General, President Ahtisaari; \r\nand in its gradual integration into regional activities, \r\ninitiatives and structures as part of Kosovo’s \r\nintegrating process in the European Union and NATO. \r\n The leadership of Kosovo, the representative \r\nKosovar institutions, the political opposition, civil \r\nsociety, the media and the entire civil factor are \r\ndemonstrating social and political cohesion and \r\nincreasing unity and open and full cooperation with the \r\ninternational factor to build a sovereign, independent, \r\ndemocratic and multi-ethnic State integrated into the \r\nEuropean and Euro-Atlantic structures and at peace \r\nwith its neighbours. The United Nations Mission and \r\nthe commitments of the Secretary-General have also \r\nplayed a significant part in that success. \r\n The progress of talks between Pristina and \r\nBelgrade in Vienna is positive. We encourage the \r\ncontinuation of constructive dialogue and hope that the \r\nSerbian side will do the same by demonstrating \r\nrealism, solidarity with the will of the international \r\ncommunity, and respect for the aspirations of the \r\npeople of Kosovo. Albania opposes any possible \r\nscenario for the partition or disintegration of Kosovo, \r\nwhich past experience suggests could entail conflict \r\nand instability in the future. \r\n We support a full and speedy solution to the issue \r\nof the status of Kosovo that takes into consideration \r\nthe will of its inhabitants and guarantees functionality \r\nwithin the Kosovar State and society and the freedoms \r\nof the minority communities. A sovereign, \r\nindependent, democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovar \r\nState with a clear Euro-Atlantic perspective will serve \r\nthe interests of peace and stability in the region and \r\nbeyond. \r\n The view occasionally expressed that the \r\nindependence of Kosovo would encourage the \r\nimplementation of similar solutions to current \r\nproblems in other countries and regions does not seem \r\naccurate to us. The solution of any problem must take \r\nthe historical and geographical context into account, \r\nalong with other considerations that exclude the search \r\nfor and mechanical application of inappropriate \r\nanalogies. Given the historical, juridical and moral \r\naspects of the issue of Kosovo, as well as the fact that \r\nit evolved through the convulsions and wars that \r\naccompanied the disintegration of the former \r\nYugoslavia, I believe that its solution in accordance \r\nwith the will of the citizens of Kosovo themselves is \r\nentirely legitimate. In that light, the solution will also \r\nmark the final stage of that disintegration and the \r\nturning of a new page as part of democratic \r\ndevelopments in the Balkans over the past decade. \r\n Albania is at an important phase in the process of \r\ncomprehensive institutional, legal and economic \r\nreform with a view to adopting European models and \r\nstandards. We are committed to improving governance \r\nat all levels to ensure that it adheres as closely as \r\npossible to the interests of our citizens and the country. \r\nThe current Government has undertaken various \r\neconomic initiatives to liberalize procedures and \r\nenhance our capacity to attract foreign investment. We \r\nare aware that this objective can be achieved only \r\nthrough reforms that realistically promote a \r\ncompetitive and open market for unfettered initiative \r\nthat offers as many people as possible the opportunity \r\nto conduct business or to be employed and is \r\ncoordinated with reforms in the priority public sectors. \r\nSuch reforms include increasing investment in \r\ninfrastructure and the energy, education and health \r\nA/61/PV.13  \r\n \r\n06-52885 26 \r\n \r\nsectors, complemented by effective social policies in \r\nfavour of social groups and individuals in need. Our \r\nobjective is for economic growth to contribute directly \r\nto meeting the Millennium Development Goals by \r\nmaking it the main factor in the reduction of poverty, \r\nreducing the unemployment rate to the average level of \r\nthe developed European countries, and securing stable \r\nand long-term economic growth that enhances \r\nopportunity for future generations. \r\n A comprehensive campaign against corruption is \r\npart of our efforts to strengthen the rule of law and \r\ndevelop the country. In that framework, concrete action \r\nis being taken to implement legislative and institutional \r\nreform in order to take preventive measures, narrow \r\nopportunities for corruptive abuses, enhance public \r\ntransparency, eliminate conflicts of interest, improve \r\naccess to decision-making, and strengthen the \r\nmonitoring role of civil society, local communities and \r\nthe media. \r\n We have also paid special attention to the fight \r\nagainst organized crime, drug and human trafficking, \r\nand money-laundering. Today we can state with full \r\nconviction that those phenomena are being met with \r\nthe full power of the law and the country’s \r\nconsolidated structures, and in cooperation with the \r\ninternational factor. That is why our results have been \r\nsignificant. \r\n Albania supports and contributes to a strong and \r\neffective United Nations capable of meeting new \r\nchallenges, because we believe the Organization to be \r\nbased on the values and principles of multilateralism, \r\nglobal partnership for development, and joint action to \r\nstrengthen collective peace and security to the benefit \r\nof human rights, the rule of law and commitments \r\nagainst terrorism. \r\n In conclusion, allow me to affirm that my country \r\nwill be active in fulfilling the commitments and \r\nobligations arising from its responsibilities within the \r\nOrganization and from those decisions that the General \r\nAssembly will adopt at its sixty-first session. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Albania for the statement \r\nhe has just made. \r\n Mr. Alfred Moisiu, President of the Republic of \r\nAlbania, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\nAddress by Mr. Fradique Bandeira Melo de Menezes, \r\nPresident of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome \r\nand Principe \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Excellency \r\nMr. Fradique Bandeira Melo de Menezes, President of \r\nthe Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe. \r\n Mr. Fradique Bandeira Melo de Menezes, \r\nPresident of the Democratic Republic of Sao \r\nTome and Principe, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency  \r\nMr. Fradique Bandeira Melo de Menezes, President of \r\nthe Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President De Menezes: As I have just been re-\r\nelected, this is my first opportunity to speak to this \r\nforum at the beginning of my second term. It is \r\ntherefore with great pleasure that I am here today for \r\nthis sixty-first session of the General Assembly. \r\n Please allow me to congratulate Mrs. Haya \r\nRashed Al-Khalifa on her election as the new President \r\nof the General Assembly. We are fortunate to have as \r\nour President a diplomat with such magnificent \r\ncredentials. In addition, this is a milestone for the \r\nUnited Nations which makes us all proud. My country, \r\nSao Tome and Principe, is a firm believer in gender \r\nequality. I am proud to say that we have a very high \r\npercentage of girls in our schools. A woman has held \r\nthe presidency of our National Assembly, and the \r\ncurrent head of our Supreme Court is a woman. We \r\nhave had two female Prime Ministers, and today \r\nwomen head half of our Government ministries. We are \r\ntherefore delighted by her election and wish her every \r\nsuccess. \r\n I thank also the outgoing President, Mr. Jan \r\nEliasson, for his remarkable work, especially in the \r\narea of advancing reform of the United Nations. Words \r\nare insufficient to pay tribute to outgoing Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan. A very special son of Africa, he \r\nhas been an extraordinary leader of our Organization. \r\nHe has worked unceasingly, showing enormous vision \r\nand great courage. No challenge has been too large or \r\ntoo dangerous. My country and I owe a special debt of \r\ngratitude to the Secretary-General, whose intervention \r\n A/61/PV.13\r\n \r\n27 06-52885 \r\n \r\nduring a 2003 coup attempt helped preserve democracy \r\nin Sao Tome and Principe. My people and I thank him. \r\nWe can only hope that his successor will prove as \r\npraiseworthy as he. \r\n We are meeting here today at a time of growing \r\ninternational tension and of increased terrorist attacks \r\non innocent civilians on every continent. We see \r\nunending conflicts, even genocide. Never have we \r\nneeded the United Nations more than at this time, when \r\nlife as we know it on our planet is threatened by \r\nclimate change. It is tragic that in the face of all these \r\nchallenges, the United Nations is often unable to act, \r\nbecause internal politics and a lack of resources \r\nconstantly hamper its ability to respond as needed. \r\n No country can live in a vacuum in today’s world. \r\nFor better or for worse, we are together in deciding the \r\nfate of our planet. We can no longer be only citizens of \r\nour town, our region or our country. We also cannot \r\nblindly think that our religion is the only religion, \r\nwhen God created so many, all believing in a Supreme \r\nBeing but worshiping in different fashions. God also \r\npainted us in a rainbow of colours and did not leave \r\ninstructions for one colour to be in charge of all the \r\nothers. Nor did He choose a special region or language \r\nto rule over everyone else. We must pull together so \r\nthat no one is left behind. There is enough for \r\neverybody, if only we would share. We all could live in \r\nfreedom and in peace, with work, health, education and \r\ndignity, if only we would work together. \r\n While we must work together for certain common \r\ngoals, we must also respect our cultural differences. \r\nOne size does not fit all. The practice of democracy in \r\nLatin America may not be the same as democracy in \r\nAsia. What worked to create economic growth in \r\nEurope may not work in Africa. Each country, each \r\npeople, each region, each town must have the freedom \r\nto decide what is best for it, while also respecting the \r\nrights of all and everyone’s responsibility as a world \r\ncitizen. \r\n The HIV/AIDS pandemic is still out of control. In \r\nmy own tiny, isolated island country, we were long \r\nimmune from it. Despite desperate efforts at education \r\nand prevention, our tiny population is being laid waste \r\nby a shocking increase in the number of HIV/AIDS \r\ncases. We have only one hospital and a handful of \r\ndoctors. We are helpless in the face of this crisis, as we \r\ncannot afford the antiretrovirals we need for all our \r\nsick people, nor do we have the ability to police our \r\nmaritime borders to keep out the main source of \r\ninfection. Our women and children are among the \r\nmillions of other faceless victims around the world, \r\nand, without help, we could one day face extinction. \r\n Climate change is already sabotaging many of the \r\nefforts being made to achieve sustainable development \r\ngoals, augmenting poverty in developing countries, \r\nespecially in the least developed countries and the \r\nsmall island developing States. There is new and strong \r\nevidence that most of the warming observed is \r\nattributable to human activities. As the polar ice caps \r\nmelt, my low-lying island country faces a second kind \r\nof extinction, that of disappearing beneath the waves of \r\nthe ocean. \r\n I cannot continue without again asking the \r\nAssembly why a country of 23 million people is not \r\nrepresented at the United Nations, where every country \r\nis supposed to have one vote. I refer here to Taiwan, an \r\nestablished democracy whose people live in freedom \r\nand in peace. Their dynamic and technologically \r\nadvanced economy is a model for creating wealth in \r\ntoday’s global economy. Taiwan is also an excellent \r\nworld citizen, generous in humanitarian and \r\ndevelopment aid. \r\n For centuries, the people of Sao Tome and \r\nPrincipe were debilitated by endemic malaria, and \r\nthousands died. Countless attempts to control the \r\nmosquitoes carrying that disease failed, until Taiwan \r\nbrought the necessary know-how and resources to bear. \r\nToday cases of malaria have been reduced by 60 per \r\ncent. Our doctors and nurses say that there have never \r\nbeen so few cases of malaria in living memory. Thanks \r\nto Taiwan and also to the Global Fund to Fight \r\nHIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, we are well on \r\nour way to finally bringing this scourge under control. \r\n In addition to humanitarian and development aid, \r\nTaiwan also maintains productive commercial ties with \r\nmany United Nations Member countries and is a \r\nmember of the World Trade Organization, the Asian \r\nDevelopment Bank and the Asia Pacific Economic \r\nGroup. The principle of universality is consecrated in \r\nthe United Nations Charter. Permanent members of the \r\nSecurity Council should not continue to ignore the case \r\nof Taiwan. \r\n Another issue that continues to require the urgent \r\nattention of all of us is the embargo on Cuba. This is a \r\nrelic of the cold war that should be lifted immediately. \r\nA/61/PV.13  \r\n \r\n06-52885 28 \r\n \r\n While mentioning the Security Council, I must \r\nsay that my country supports the calls that have \r\nreverberated through these halls for more than a \r\ndecade. We must reform the Security Council. Its \r\nmembership and institutional structures reflect \r\noutdated geopolitical realities and political thinking \r\nthat was shaped by the world of 1945. Giving only five \r\npermanent members the veto power and special \r\nprivileges puts the Security Council out of touch with \r\nthe world. Africa, for example, does not have a single \r\npermanent member. This is not acceptable. \r\n I will close by talking about poverty, or rather \r\nwhat we are all seeking, which is the end of poverty. \r\nThe Millennium Development Goals are a noble \r\nproject. Sao Tome and Principe is grateful to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan and the Goals’ Director Jeffrey \r\nSachs for their tireless efforts to pull poor countries out \r\nof what Professor Sachs so rightly calls the poverty \r\ntrap. \r\n But how did so many countries get into the \r\npoverty trap? We are unlikely to get out, or stay out, \r\nunless we know how we got there in the first place. I \r\nthink it is time we all faced some of the unspoken \r\ntruths about poverty. Why are we poor? Economists \r\ntraditionally told us that economic wealth comes from \r\na combination of man-made resources, such as roads, \r\nfactories, machines, telephone systems; human \r\nresources, hard work and education; and technological \r\nresources, technical know-how and technological \r\nmachinery. But if this were true, then poor countries \r\ncould simply build some schools, pave roads and buy \r\nsome computers, and we would quickly catch up with \r\nrich countries. \r\n But there is something wrong here. While \r\nTaiwan, South Korea and China have all been doubling \r\ntheir incomes every decade, many poor countries \r\nmaking these changes are not growing faster than rich \r\ncountries. In fact, they are growing more slowly, or \r\neven getting poorer. So there is a new theory that says \r\nthe more you have, the faster you grow. This could \r\nexplain why rich countries stay rich, and poor countries \r\nfall farther behind — except that it does not explain \r\nhow Chile, India, Singapore, Mauritius and Botswana \r\nare catching up. These dynamic countries — not Japan, \r\nnot Switzerland, not the United States — are the \r\nfastest-growing economies on the planet. Fifty years \r\nago they were trapped in poverty. That is no longer the \r\ncase. \r\n Why have so many other countries been left \r\nbehind? The newest theories tell us that the answer is \r\nsimple. With or without natural resources, with or \r\nwithout human resources, with or without technology, \r\nbadly governed countries are poor countries. Bad \r\ngovernment causes poverty. When States do not protect \r\nproperty and people; when national revenues benefit \r\nself-interested political insiders who oppose any \r\nactions that would lead to more equal distribution of \r\nincome and resources; when Government officials \r\nwaste funds; when people are hired on the basis of \r\nbeing from the right family or region or political \r\ngrouping; when nobody monitors Government \r\nspending; when corruption is noted but never punished; \r\nand when illegal activities are not restrained by law, \r\nthe press or democratic opposition, then miserable \r\nresults follow. \r\n We have all heard of the “natural resource curse”, \r\nwhich shows that large amounts of oil or diamonds, for \r\nexample, tend to make democracy and good \r\ngovernment less likely. But recent studies have also \r\nfound that there is also an “aid curse”. Without \r\nmeaning to do so, multilateral and bilateral donors can \r\nactually make Governments worse. And just as badly \r\ngoverned countries tend to be poor, so badly governed \r\naid projects, without transparency or accountability, \r\nalso tend to fail. \r\n Humanitarian aid has proven far more successful \r\nthan long-term development aid, because it is given in \r\nhighly targeted bursts. It is also usually given as \r\nmedicine, food, clothing or tents and taken directly to \r\nthe location of the tragedy, with doctors and nurses on \r\nthe ground rather than consultants. \r\n Of course, there have been some beautiful \r\nsuccesses in aid programmes, mostly in health care, \r\nwith victories over smallpox, drug-resistant \r\ntuberculosis and river blindness. Adult literacy has \r\nrisen, as had life expectancy until the AIDS pandemic \r\nwiped out that improvement. \r\n Aid gives hope to millions of people around the \r\nworld. We simply need to mend it, not end it. My own \r\ncountry has certainly suffered from its own share of \r\nbad governance — for the most part unwittingly, \r\nbecause of our own inexperience. But we are learning \r\nquickly in our short history, and we now have one of \r\nthe most stable and robust democracies in all of Africa. \r\n We have the prospect of oil in our waters and in \r\nwaters shared with our neighbour, Nigeria. We have \r\n A/61/PV.13\r\n \r\n29 06-52885 \r\n \r\nalready taken steps to ensure that any potential \r\npetroleum resources are not wasted but are protected \r\nfor the benefit of all our citizens with an oil revenue \r\nmanagement law that was passed unanimously in our \r\nparliament in 2004. \r\n We cannot let the past bury the future. We can lift \r\nbillions out of poverty. When I was first elected \r\nPresident of my country five years ago, I lit a candle of \r\nhope for the long-suffering people of Sao Tome and \r\nPrincipe. We are not there yet, but the light is getting \r\nbrighter. \r\n If development were easy, everyone would \r\nalready be developed! We cannot sit in supine \r\nindifference. Let us renew our efforts and work \r\ntogether with respect, dignity and dedication for the \r\nbenefit of all the peoples of the world and for the fate \r\nof our beautiful planet. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and \r\nPrincipe for the statement he has just made.  \r\n Mr. Fradique Bandeira Melo de Menezes, \r\nPresident of the Democratic Republic of Sao \r\nTome and Principe, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Joseph Kabila Kabange, President of \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an add by the President of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. \r\n Mr. Joseph Kabila Kabange, President of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, was escorted \r\ninto the General Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Joseph Kabila Kabange, President of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, and to invite him \r\nto address the General Assembly. \r\n President Kabila (spoke in French): At the \r\noutset, Sir, I would ask you to kindly convey to \r\nSheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa my warm and \r\nheartfelt congratulations upon her election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \r\nsession. My congratulations go also to all the other \r\nmembers of the Bureau who, I am certain, will help her \r\nto successfully accomplish her illustrious and sensitive \r\ndelicate tasks as President. I also take the opportunity \r\nto pay due tribute to her predecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixtieth \r\nsession, for the high quality of his work during a term \r\nof office that took place in a difficult international \r\nenvironment. \r\n I cannot continue without expressing my \r\ngratitude, and that of the entire Congolese people, to \r\nMr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General, whose mandate \r\nwill come to an end this year on a positive note for all. \r\nThanks to the remarkable leadership of that worthy son \r\nof Africa, the States Members of our Organization have \r\nenjoyed a decade of intense and active diplomacy \r\nwhich has made it possible to solve a large number of \r\nconflicts throughout the world. Here, I should mention \r\nespecially the situation of the countries of the Great \r\nLakes region, in particular that of the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo.  \r\n As the sixty-first session of the General Assembly \r\nis taking place, my country, the Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo, is passing through a special period of its \r\npolitical history. The transition period that began in \r\n1990 will soon draw to a close, with the establishment \r\nof the country’s new institutions.  \r\n On 30 July, we held countrywide, in a climate of \r\npeace and transparency, the first truly democratic \r\npluralistic elections in 40 years. The success of that \r\nundertaking constitutes a great joint effort by the \r\nCongolese people and by the bilateral and multilateral \r\npartners of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. I \r\nwould like to take this opportunity to thank all of those \r\npartners. \r\n With regard to the unfortunate events in Kinshasa \r\nfrom 20 to 22 August 2006 following the \r\nannouncement of the provisional results of the first \r\nround of the presidential elections by the Independent \r\nElectoral Commission, all necessary steps have been \r\ntaken in order to prevent such incidents from \r\nhappening again. The electoral process will continue in \r\na climate of national peace and harmony. \r\n The progress achieved daily, sometimes at the \r\ncost of much sacrifice, is the outcome of a difficult \r\npolitical process that was launched, as members know, \r\nafter a long internal and external armed conflict. The \r\nhumanitarian consequences of that conflict are one of \r\nthe worst tragedies ever experienced by mankind. \r\nA/61/PV.13  \r\n \r\n06-52885 30 \r\n \r\nProblems remain in many sectors, and the next \r\nGovernment will have to confront them, taking account \r\nof the urgent and legitimate expectations of the \r\nCongolese people. \r\n The new Government must continue integrating \r\nand reforming the army, in order to guarantee peace \r\nand security for our people. It must work to improve \r\nthe living conditions of the population. In other words, \r\nit must do its utmost to meet their fundamental needs, \r\nin particular health care, education, food security, basic \r\ninfrastructures, electricity and drinking water for all — \r\nwithout forgetting, of course, the fight against malaria \r\nand HIV/AIDS and the fight against poverty.  \r\n In order to succeed, the new Government must, \r\ninter alia, strengthen good governance by fighting \r\ncorruption and guaranteeing legal and judiciary \r\nsecurity in the framework of ongoing judicial reform. It \r\nwill be possible to achieve that vision only by \r\nmobilizing the energy of our entire nation through \r\nactive and inclusive participation by all of the sons and \r\ndaughters of our country, whatever their political, \r\nideological or religious convictions may be. \r\n In that regard, we welcome the configuration of \r\nour future parliament, which already reflects the wealth \r\nand political diversity of our people, and which has an \r\noversight role that will be fundamental to the \r\nfunctioning of the State. For that reason, I reaffirm my \r\nfaith in the concept of peacebuilding and make an \r\nurgent appeal to the international community to \r\ncontinue its partnerships with the Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo after the establishment of the new \r\ninstitutions. \r\n As we observe the international scene, we see \r\nrecurring scourges, including continuing tensions and \r\narmed conflicts in several regions of the world, the \r\nworsening the living conditions in developing \r\ncountries, especially in Africa; the rise in clandestine \r\nimmigration; the destruction caused by different \r\npandemics; the increase in crime and acts of terrorism; \r\nand the harm to the conservation and protection of the \r\nenvironment. In view of these threats, the Assembly at \r\nits previous session had organized, as part of its work, \r\nthe World Summit of heads of State and Government, \r\ndedicated to an assessment of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) and other commitments \r\nresulting from the major international conferences and \r\nmeetings.  \r\n Following that assessment several decisions were \r\ntaken, including the creation of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission and the Human Rights Council — two \r\nbasic structures whose effective establishment we can \r\nonly welcome. Achieving the MDGs is a priority for a \r\ngood number of countries, especially the most \r\ndisadvantaged. That is why the momentum in the \r\nimplementation of the relevant recommendations of the \r\nMillennium Summit should not weaken. We would like \r\nto see our discussions here include those issues.  \r\n In addition to the above-mentioned scourges, \r\nother matters are a source of concern for our country, \r\nincluding the reform of the Security Council, the \r\ncomplete cancellation of the debt of developing \r\ncountries, an increase in official development \r\nassistance, the adoption of a comprehensive convention \r\non international terrorism and the global strategy to \r\nfight that phenomenon, armed conflicts, collective \r\nsecurity, and the adoption of an international treaty on \r\nforced disappearances. All those issues challenge the \r\nharmonious progress of the community of nations and \r\nthe very future of coming generations.  \r\n To meet those challenges effectively, all countries \r\nof the world must show solidarity with each other, in a \r\nspirit of sincere cooperation and humanist justice. With \r\nregard to crises in the world — in the Middle East, in \r\nAfrica or elsewhere — the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo recommends, more than ever, their peaceful \r\nsolution under the Charter of the United Nations and \r\nthe relevant resolutions of the Security Council.  \r\n I hope this Assembly shares my belief in the \r\nrebirth of the Democratic Republic of the Congo with \r\nthe advent of new institutions seeking to usher in a new \r\nera of peace, stability and development, not only in my \r\ncountry, but also in Central Africa and the entire region \r\nof the Great Lakes. Despite the challenges our \r\nOrganization faces day after day, it is on a note of \r\nhope, of solidarity among nations and of synergy in \r\ntheir actions for a brighter future for present and future \r\ngenerations that I conclude my statement. I hope for \r\nmuch success in our work.  \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Democratic Republic of the Congo for \r\nthe statement he has just made.  \r\n Mr. Josef Kabila Kabange, President of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, was escorted \r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall.  \r\n A/61/PV.13\r\n \r\n31 06-52885 \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\n \r\n  Address by The Honourable Dato’ Seri \r\nAbdullah Ahmad Badawi, Prime Minister \r\nof Malaysia \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of Malaysia. \r\n The Honourable Dato’ Seri Abdullah Ahmad \r\nBadawi, Prime Minister of Malaysia, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Dato’ Seri \r\nAbdullah Ahmad Badawi, Prime Minister of Malaysia, \r\nand inviting him to address the Assembly. \r\n Mr. Badawi (Malaysia): First, I wish to \r\ncongratulate Ms. Haya Rasheed Al-Khalifa and the \r\nState of Bahrain on her election as the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-first session. As an \r\nAsian, a Muslim and the current Chairman of the \r\nSummit Conference of the Organization of the Islamic \r\nConference, I welcome her election with pride and \r\nsatisfaction. I am confident that she will be able to \r\nsteer the proceedings of the Assembly with \r\nconsummate skill and achieve meaningful results. \r\nNeedless to say, Malaysia will support her in any way \r\nthat we can. \r\n Allow me to also pay tribute to her distinguished \r\npredecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, the Foreign Minister of \r\nSweden, for the exemplary way in which he guided the \r\nproceedings of the Assembly’s sixtieth session, during \r\nsome of the most trying times for the United Nations. \r\n Speaking of trying times, I would also like to pay \r\ntribute to Mr. Kofi Annan for his tireless efforts in \r\nserving humanity, not only during his tenure as the \r\nSecretary-General but throughout an entire career \r\ndedicated to the ideals of our Organization. \r\n I must pay a special tribute to the members of the \r\nSecretariat and those serving under the United Nations \r\nbanner, in particular those who have made the ultimate \r\nsacrifice of their lives, like the four members of the \r\nUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon who were \r\nkilled last July during the height of the Israeli offensive \r\nagainst Lebanon. \r\n Mr. Mérorès (Haiti), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n We must continually remind ourselves that the \r\nUnited Nations was brought into being to serve as a \r\nforum, and, as in Tennyson’s words, to be a parliament \r\nof man. Six decades later, we have yet to achieve the \r\nintentions of the United Nations Charter. Indeed, the \r\nsituation in some corners of the world is bleaker than it \r\never was before. Yet the human family is still unable to \r\nfind solutions to its own problems. \r\n As I review in my mind the events of the past \r\nyear, I personally feel most disturbed that many of the \r\nills in the affairs of our world were the result of \r\nirrational actions caused by prejudice in human \r\nattitudes. Basically, we have failed to engage in \r\ndialogue, communicate and reach out to one another as \r\nfellow humans inhabiting the same planet. Indeed, the \r\ngreatest discord today exists among the descendants of \r\nAbraham. These are the People of the Book: the \r\nfollowers of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, who in \r\nfact share a common beginning, which was the religion \r\nof Abraham. \r\n Of course, dialogue will be endless if it is not \r\naccompanied by action. The purpose of honest \r\ndiscussion and engagement is to enable us to formulate \r\nrational and effective policies. To achieve this, I \r\nbelieve that all of us need to listen well and be sincere \r\nin our relations with one another. Much of the dialogue \r\nthat takes place results in the parties talking at, instead \r\nof talking to, one another. Any dialogue will certainly \r\nfail if it is predetermined that certain States are \r\n“rogues” or that certain countries are necessarily \r\n“evil”. Such name-calling provides an excuse not to \r\nlisten, let alone engage in serious negotiations to find \r\namicable solutions to serious problems. \r\n A blatant example of the refusal to grant even a \r\nhearing was the early decision by many important \r\ncountries not to recognize or do business with Hamas \r\nafter that group was elected to power in Palestine \r\nthrough a properly conducted democratic election. \r\nExternal assistance was stopped. Funds were blocked. \r\nAs a result, millions of Palestinians have suffered for \r\nmonths without pay or food. I hope that all sanctions \r\nagainst Palestine will soon be a matter of the past, \r\nwhen President Abbas succeeds in the task of putting \r\ntogether a coalition Government embracing all parties \r\nin Palestine. Surely, to dictate or show preferences as \r\nA/61/PV.13  \r\n \r\n06-52885 32 \r\n \r\nto who should be elected to power in other countries is \r\nirrational and a sign of double standards. \r\n The oppression of Palestine, which is being \r\nallowed to fester; the invasion of Afghanistan; the \r\nconquest of Iraq; and, most recently, the unrestrained \r\ndestruction of Lebanon have all been carried out in the \r\nname of the war against terrorism. The actions of Israel \r\nin the Middle East are being supported, either openly \r\nor tacitly, supposedly in defence of the Judeo-Christian \r\ntradition against the spread of radical militant Islam, \r\nthus legitimizing all those actions, no matter how \r\nbrutal. Even Western commentators have conceded that \r\nIsrael’s latest assault against Lebanon has helped make \r\nwhat may once have been extremist opinions part of \r\nthe Muslim mainstream. The Muslim world certainly \r\nsees all this as complicity to humiliate Muslim \r\ncountries and Muslim societies. \r\n I am afraid that the schism between the West and \r\nthe Muslim world will grow even deeper unless the \r\ninternational community is prepared to accept certain \r\nfacts as the truth. The fact is that the sense of \r\nhumiliation being felt by the Muslim world is the root \r\ncause for the loss of trust and confidence between the \r\nMuslim world, on the one side, and Judeo-Christian \r\ncivilization, on the other. If the international \r\ncommunity refuses or fails to accept this fact, then I \r\nam afraid we are denying the truth. \r\n I believe that much of the prejudice against \r\nMuslims stems from a lack of understanding of the true \r\nnature of Islam and what it stands for. For instance, \r\nthere is a lack of appreciation in the West of the role of \r\nreligion in the lives of Muslims. Modern Europe has \r\ngenerally embraced secularism and has largely \r\nremoved religion from the public domain, placing it in \r\nthe confines of the home and family. For Muslims, the \r\nteachings of Islam serve as their guide for doing all \r\nthings, whether conducting their affairs in the public \r\ndomain or practicing the religion in their private \r\nhomes. I suggest that many of the misunderstandings, \r\nespecially those between the Christian West and the \r\nMuslim world, arise out of this fundamental \r\nmisunderstanding of the place of religion in the daily \r\nlives of Muslims all over the world. When dealing with \r\nMuslims, one cannot separate them from their religion, \r\nbecause that is their way of life. \r\n My country, Malaysia, is a multi-ethnic, multi-\r\nreligious, multicultural country. However, Islam is \r\nrespected by all our people as the official religion. The \r\nGovernment which I now lead has embarked on a \r\nprogramme to communicate a proper appreciation of \r\nIslam as a force for good. We call it Islam Hadhari, \r\nwhich is an approach for achieving a progressive \r\nsociety that is compatible with modernity yet firmly \r\nrooted in the noble values and injunctions of Islam. \r\nThis approach has been accepted by everyone in \r\nMalaysia because underlying the whole message of \r\nIslam Hadhari is a call for equitable development and \r\nprogress. It is a call for moderation and tolerance as \r\nwell as the assurance of justice and fairness for all, \r\nirrespective of their faith. \r\n The point I am making is that Islam the religion \r\nis not the source of intolerance between people of \r\ndifferent faiths. In fact, one of the fundamental \r\nteachings of Islam is the requirement to respect other \r\nreligions. The Holy Koran contains that commandment \r\nby God. We must not confuse the perverse words and \r\nevil deeds of a small number of extremists who operate \r\non the fringes of Muslim societies as a reflection of \r\nIslamic culture. The demonization of Islam must be \r\nstopped and Islamophobia must be removed. The \r\npolitics of fear must cease to dictate the conduct of \r\nrelations between peoples and nations. If the politics of \r\nfear is not stopped, then prejudice and irrationality will \r\ncontinue to prevail in the affairs of the world, and \r\ndialogue will continue to fail. \r\n However, we must persevere, not only to \r\neliminate political and religious discord among men, \r\nbut also to eradicate social and economic injustices, \r\nparticularly poverty and disease. That is an \r\ninternational responsibility, not only in the name of \r\nhumanity, but also as a necessary aspect of maintaining \r\ninternational peace and stability. \r\n We must therefore do all we can to ensure that the \r\nimpoverished and marginalized also enjoy the fruits of \r\neconomic growth, globalization and free trade. It \r\nwould indeed be unfortunate if we were unable to do \r\nso, because the world has become more wealthy than \r\never before. We should learn from history that any \r\neconomic system in which disparities exist cannot be \r\nsustained in the long term. All too often, such societies \r\ncome to a violent end. The civil wars and social unrest \r\nwe witness today mark a phase that we must stop. \r\n Malaysia firmly believes that the key to \r\nprosperity, inclusion and equity is sustained economic \r\ngrowth based on the building of national capacities, \r\nparticularly human capital development. While \r\n A/61/PV.13\r\n \r\n33 06-52885 \r\n \r\neducation and skills by themselves are no guarantee of \r\nsuccess, they are indispensable ingredients for the \r\ngreater productivity of individual citizens, which in \r\nturn gives them hope for a better future. \r\n However, efforts at the national level alone are \r\nnot sufficient. Those efforts need to be supplemented \r\nby the establishment of an international economic \r\norder that would cover areas such as trade, finance, \r\ndebt, official development assistance (ODA) and \r\ndevelopment, and that would enable the developing \r\nworld to overcome its difficulties and contribute to \r\nglobal prosperity. Some progress has been made, but \r\nthe overall results have been far from satisfactory. \r\n Given the economic clout that the developed \r\ncountries possess, it is essential that they demonstrate \r\nflexibility and goodwill at this critical juncture in the \r\nworld trade talks. Malaysia will continue to be \r\nsupportive of multilateral trade negotiations. \r\nMalaysia’s approach will, however, never be premised \r\nsimply on the notion of progressive liberalization. We \r\nwill continue to take a pragmatic approach by \r\ncombining liberalization with regulation in a policy \r\nmix consistent with the country’s economic conditions \r\nand development needs. \r\n It is all too clear that our human family must \r\ncome together and that its members must talk to one \r\nanother if we are to overcome the problems that \r\nthreaten to engulf us all. To talk, however, is easy; to \r\nengage in dialogue and to communicate is more \r\ndifficult. Indeed, this may be the most difficult of all \r\nhuman endeavours, given the human temperament with \r\nall its passions and foibles. It will require courage, \r\nhumility and an appreciation of the diversities that \r\nmake us human.  \r\n We must not be patronizing or condescending in \r\nour relationships, and we must certainly not be \r\nthreatening. We must be persuasive and patient in \r\ndealing with complexities. The pursuit of peace, justice \r\nand fairness in relations among nations and peoples has \r\nnever been easy. Let us take up this challenge, with all \r\nthe fortitude that it requires, and together put into \r\neffect a better world. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister of Malaysia for the statement he has \r\njust made. \r\n The Honourable Dato’ Seri Abdullah Ahmad \r\nBadawi, Prime Minister of Malaysia, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Adnan Terzić, Chairman of the \r\nCouncil of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Chairman of \r\nthe Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina. \r\n Mr. Adnan Terzić, Chairman of the Council of \r\nMinisters of Bosnia and Herzegovina, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Adnan \r\nTerzić, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina, and inviting him to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n Mr. Terzić (Bosnia and Herzegovina) (spoke in \r\nBosnian; English text provided by the delegation): It is \r\na great honour and a pleasure to address the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-first session on behalf of Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina. \r\n First of all, I would like to congratulate \r\nMs. Al-Khalifa on her election to her important post, \r\nand also to thank the former President for his \r\ncontribution to the United Nations reform process. \r\n Bosnia and Herzegovina aligns itself with the \r\nstatement made by the representative of the European \r\nUnion (EU), which provides a framework for the \r\ndiscussion of issues such as peace, stability, \r\ndevelopment, human rights, the rule of law and the \r\nneed to further strengthen and reform the United \r\nNations. \r\n We endorse the EU statement, but we would also \r\nlike to share with the Assembly Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina’s experience in peacebuilding, the \r\nimplementation of human rights and the rule of law \r\nand economic development in a post-conflict \r\nenvironment. We believe that in that way we can \r\ncontribute to the future success of the international \r\ncommunity elsewhere in the world. \r\n Bosnia and Herzegovina is, beyond any doubt, an \r\nexample of successful intervention by the international \r\ncommunity, despite a few negative experiences. I \r\nwould like to make it absolutely clear that the job in \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina is not yet done. There are still \r\nA/61/PV.13  \r\n \r\n06-52885 34 \r\n \r\nsome bridges that we have to cross before we will have \r\nfinished the 15-year-long marathon task of stopping the \r\nfighting, promoting reconciliation and building a stable \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina with a view to becoming an \r\nEU member in the near future. \r\n Bosnia and Herzegovina belongs to Europe; it is \r\npart of the European continent. Medical students — \r\nfuture doctors — all take the Hippocratic oath. They \r\nswear to apply the highest ethical norms. Law students \r\nget their basic training from the standards of Roman \r\nlaw. The European heritage and European practices are \r\nfirmly rooted in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We must \r\nnow embrace all European Union standards and norms. \r\nWe do not feel discouraged when we hear people talk \r\nof “enlargement fatigue”. Through the enlargement \r\nprocess, Europe is spreading democracy itself. It would \r\nbe completely contrary to EU and United Nations \r\nprinciples to grow tired of the spread of democracy. \r\n Recent events in the Middle East have shown us \r\nhow important it is to achieve a just and lasting peace \r\nthere. But just as we sympathize with people living in \r\ncrisis areas today, so too those living in such areas can \r\nobserve the process of peacebuilding in Bosnia. One \r\nshould pay attention not just to the stabilization of one \r\nState in the Balkans but also to the capacity that the EU \r\nand the rest of the international community have to \r\ninitiate swift and efficient intervention. \r\n We in Bosnia and Herzegovina have been assisted \r\nby the United Nations, NATO, the EU, the \r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, \r\nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference and the \r\nCouncil of Europe. We have also benefited from other, \r\nunique assistance mechanisms, such as the recently \r\nestablished Office of the High Representative and the \r\nPeace Implementation Council, which include \r\nEuropean Union members, Japan, Russia, the United \r\nStates of America, Canada, Turkey and others.  \r\n The war has been stopped, the refugees have \r\nreturned and today we are negotiating a Stabilization \r\nand Association Agreement with the EU. However, \r\nnone of us should allow the current flaws in Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina to develop into something more \r\nserious, leading to instability. \r\n As magnificent as it was in terms of stopping the \r\nwar, the Dayton Peace Agreement did not tackle some \r\nessential issues, such as providing for every citizen to \r\nenjoy equal rights throughout the country, or for the \r\nState to be able to exercise its powers as a modern, \r\nmulti-ethnic State. \r\n Many visitors to my country are especially \r\nimpressed by the number of churches, mosques and \r\nsynagogues that there are, and the way in which they \r\ncoexist in close proximity to one another, serving their \r\npurpose in Bosnia and Herzegovina. That is the spirit \r\nof Bosnia that we inherited from our ancestors, but the \r\nDayton Agreements have not enabled us to maintain \r\nthat traditional aspect of the country. \r\n On the other hand, Bosnia and Herzegovina has \r\nbeen able to achieve economic and political \r\ndevelopment, which strengthens its prospects for \r\njoining Euro-Atlantic integration processes. The \r\nnumber of foreign military troops on our soil has been \r\nreduced tenfold and the mandate of the EU-led \r\npeacekeeping force has shifted from stabilization to \r\nintegration. We have established a single economic \r\nspace and a single judiciary system, and the various \r\nintelligence services are now united and are for the \r\nfirst time under strict and democratic parliamentary \r\nsupervision. We have formed a single State-level \r\nMinistry of Defence, and thereby qualified for \r\naccession to the NATO Partnership for Peace \r\nprogramme. \r\n Bosnia and Herzegovina, as it is today, was not \r\nshaped by conventional political means. Its structure \r\nwas defined by the Dayton Peace Agreement as a way \r\nto prevent war. The sustainability of the Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina of Dayton has been strengthened by the \r\nlaunching of the Stabilization and Association \r\nAgreement negotiations with the European Union, \r\nwhich began on the tenth anniversary of the signing of \r\nthe Dayton Agreement. \r\n The Office of the High Representative is \r\nscheduled to be abolished in the middle of next year. \r\nThat Office will be transformed into the Office of the \r\nSpecial Representative of the EU for Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina. That should be linked to our signing of \r\nthe SAA with the European Union. So far, negotiations \r\nhave gone well, and Bosnia has demonstrated sufficient \r\nawareness and technical ability to enable it to embark \r\non the Euro-integration project. We are preparing for \r\nelections in October, but, unfortunately, the ongoing \r\ncampaigns have delayed our efforts to fulfil the vital \r\npolitical criteria. \r\n Next week, by voting, the citizens of Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina will have an opportunity to participate in \r\n A/61/PV.13\r\n \r\n35 06-52885 \r\n \r\nthe shaping of their future. They deserve election \r\ncampaigns that look not at the past, but towards the \r\nfuture. They do not deserve campaigns such as the one \r\nthat was characterized last week by the EU Council of \r\nMinisters as a cause for concern and prompted it to \r\nstress the EU’s commitment to the territorial integrity \r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina. \r\n Bosnia and Herzegovina participates actively in \r\nregional cooperation, and we participate in all regional \r\ninitiatives, including the Stability Pact for South \r\nEastern Europe, the South-East European Cooperation \r\nProcess, the Adriatic and Ionian Initiative and many \r\nother programmes and projects. On that basis, a huge \r\nnumber of bilateral and multilateral agreements were \r\nsigned, creating an international legal framework for \r\ncooperation on and the harmonization of a number of \r\nissues. \r\n That is especially interesting in the light of the \r\nKosovo issue. Bosnia and Herzegovina keeps a close \r\neye on the negotiations. We believe that any solution \r\nmust be the result of negotiations if both sides are to \r\naccept it. Any future solution should accommodate a \r\ncommon future within the Euro-Atlantic environment. \r\nThe consequences of the final solution, once it is \r\nfound, must under no circumstances jeopardize the \r\nstability of the region or that of the neighbouring \r\nStates. \r\n I am pleased to inform the Assembly that the \r\nCouncil of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina is on \r\nthe path to successfully achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. Those priorities are \r\ncomplementary with the criteria for European Union \r\nmembership. In cooperation with the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency, Bosnia and Herzegovina is \r\ndeveloping capacities for the detection and prevention \r\nof illegal trading in and the proliferation of radioactive \r\nmaterials throughout our territory. \r\n As a mine-affected country, Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina is quite active in the implementation of \r\nthe Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, \r\nStockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel \r\nMines and on Their Destruction. It is well known that \r\nthere is still a significant number of landmines in our \r\ncountry as a consequence of war. I should like to thank \r\nall the countries that have contributed to the demining \r\nprocess in Bosnia and Herzegovina. \r\n We are also playing an active role in United \r\nNations programmes that address the issue of \r\nHIV/AIDS. We have established a State-level \r\ncommission to fight AIDS. Its current activities focus \r\non preventing the disease from spreading, establishing \r\nan early warning system, and informing the public of \r\nthe dangers of the disease. \r\n As a young democracy and a country with special \r\nexperience, Bosnia and Herzegovina supported the \r\nforming of the Human Rights Council and the \r\nstrengthening of the role of the Office of the High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights. We believe that their \r\nwork is gaining in importance every day. We strongly \r\nand decisively support the international system for \r\nuniversal human rights protection. \r\n In my country, human rights have been violated \r\nnot only by war and crises, but also by certain \r\ndecisions of the international community. One example \r\nis the problem of decertified police officers. The \r\ndecisions of the United Nations-led international police \r\ncaused them to lose their work permits. They were \r\noffered no opportunity to file complaints or take their \r\ncases to any type of court review. Our Ministry for \r\nHuman Rights has prepared, in close cooperation with \r\nthe Office of the High Representative for the \r\nImplementation of the Peace Agreement on Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina, a possible model for a review process, to \r\nbe led by the European Union Police Mission in Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina, the current representative of the \r\ninternational police presence in the country. The absurd \r\nand flagrant violation of human rights committed by \r\nthe United Nations itself is a mistake that must be \r\nacknowledged. It can thereby be corrected and the \r\ncredibility of the United Nations as an institution \r\npreserved. \r\n One of the most important international \r\nobligations of Bosnia and Herzegovina is cooperation \r\nwith The Hague Tribunal for war crimes. That is \r\nindeed a precondition for long-term stability. That is \r\nwhy it was offered to the entire region as a condition of \r\nfurther progress in Euro-Atlantic terms. According to \r\nthe data gathered by both domestic and foreign \r\nintelligence, most wanted war criminals are not hiding \r\non the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Our \r\ninstitutions are focused on cutting off the financial \r\nsupport networks. It is a sad and pitiful fact that \r\nRadovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic have not yet been \r\narrested, but it is even worse for Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina and its citizens to be punished because of \r\nthe two of them. We are penalizing the victims instead \r\nof punishing the criminals. Bosnia and Herzegovina \r\nA/61/PV.13  \r\n \r\n06-52885 36 \r\n \r\nmust be allowed to pursue progress on its road to \r\ndemocratization and the European Union, because \r\nimprovement in that regard will create an even stronger \r\nmechanism for destroying the war criminals’ support \r\nnetwork. \r\n The horrible terrorist attacks on New York, the \r\nanniversary of which we recently marked, changed the \r\nworld’s entire security paradigm. The attacks made us \r\nthink in ever more serious terms. Terrorism is one of \r\nthe greatest challenges faced by the modern world, and \r\nit is virtually impossible for countries to respond to \r\nsuch a challenge individually. Member States may \r\nindividually strengthen their capacities, but a global \r\nand complete response can be achieved only by the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n Having established the Ministry of Security, an \r\nintelligence agency and an investigations and \r\nprotection agency at the State level, and by \r\ncoordinating their work through the Counter-Terrorism \r\nTask Force, we have undertaken a series of very \r\nimportant steps not just in terms of internal reforms, \r\nbut also in terms of our contribution to the global anti-\r\nterrorist campaign. We have adopted an anti-terrorism \r\nstrategy for the period 2006-2009 that will guide us \r\nthrough the implementation of European standards in \r\nthat field. We are in the final stages of adopting a new \r\nlaw on the fight against terrorism and financial support \r\nfor terrorism. \r\n Bosnia and Herzegovina wholeheartedly \r\nsupported the establishment of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, and we genuinely hoped to contribute \r\nactively to its work. The experience of peacebuilding \r\nin Bosnia is vast and relevant, and we are eager to \r\nshare it with other Member States. \r\n Although our country was not elected, we wish to \r\nthank all those who supported us through the process. \r\nAt the very least, we sent yet another signal to the \r\nworld that we are no longer simply the receivers of \r\ninternational aid. The support we gained has \r\nencouraged us to continue to insist on a more balanced \r\nand more proactive participation in United Nations \r\nprojects worldwide. In that context, I stress Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina’s aspirations as a candidate for non-\r\npermanent membership of the Security Council for the \r\nterm 2010-2011, and I would welcome the Assembly’s \r\nsupport in that regard. \r\n Despite our limited capacities, we try to \r\nparticipate in international peace efforts. We have sent \r\nour military observers and police officers to the Congo, \r\nEthiopia, Liberia, Haiti, the Sudan, Eritrea and Cyprus. \r\nAs a sign of our support for the Iraqi people, we have \r\ndeployed a demining squadron to assist, to the extent \r\nof its capacities, in building a sustainable and stable \r\nIraq.  \r\n The escalation of conflict in the Middle East \r\nmarked this summer and claimed many victims, \r\nnumerous civilians among them. We support Security \r\nCouncil resolution 1701 (2006) calling for a full \r\ncessation of hostilities. We particularly appreciate the \r\ndiplomatic efforts of Security Council members, \r\nincluding the United States and France, that led to the \r\nfinal harmonization of the resolution. We hope that this \r\npositive breakthrough will constitute a sound basis for \r\ndiplomatic efforts in the Middle East and that lasting \r\npeace will finally be achieved in that region. \r\n I would also like to call attention to the \r\nhumanitarian issues that are generally discussed at \r\nevery session of the General Assembly. In order to \r\ncontribute to the work of the humanitarian agencies \r\nand United Nations efforts in general regarding that \r\nvery important field, Bosnia and Herzegovina has \r\nsubmitted to the membership a draft declaration \r\nrelating to basic tenets of humanitarian action in \r\nemergency situations, contained in document A/60/627. \r\nThe Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina seeks to \r\ncontribute to progress in world preparedness for \r\nemergency situations on the basis of our own lessons \r\nlearnt. I invite Member States to consider the adoption \r\nof the draft declaration and to continue to contribute to \r\nprogress in such important activities globally. \r\n In conclusion, I thank all members for the \r\nassistance and support that we received from the \r\ninternational community in years gone by and to \r\nexpress my hope that they will use their voices to \r\nsupport Bosnia and Herzegovina as a candidate for \r\nnon-permanent Security Council membership. In so \r\ndoing, they will contribute to Bosnia’s assumption of \r\nits place in international relations. Furthermore, I wish \r\nto thank Mr. Kofi Annan, on behalf of Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina, for his contribution and commitment to \r\nstability and prosperity in my country. He has \r\nconfirmed his commitment by visiting us twice. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nChairman of the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina for the statement he has just made. \r\n A/61/PV.13\r\n \r\n37 06-52885 \r\n \r\n Mr. Adnan Terzić, Chairman of the Council of \r\nMinisters of Bosnia and Herzegovina, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Ivo Sanader, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Republic of Croatia \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Croatia. \r\n Mr. Ivo Sanader, Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Croatia, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Ivo \r\nSanader, Prime Minister of the Republic of Croatia, \r\nand inviting him to address the Assembly. \r\n Mr. Sanader (Croatia): At the outset, allow me to \r\njoin other delegations in congratulating the President \r\nof the General Assembly on her election and to express \r\nmy deep conviction that, under her skilful leadership, \r\nthis session will achieve remarkable results. \r\n Allow me also to extend my country’s sentiments \r\nof deepest appreciation to Secretary-General Kofi \r\nAnnan. His relentless work for a better world has been \r\nmost remarkable. Leading the United Nations for 10 \r\nyears in very sensitive times, his achievements, \r\nhumanism, vision and initiatives have crucially \r\ncontributed to the Organization. That has been \r\nrecognized worldwide. I wish him all the best in his \r\nfuture engagements and thank him. \r\n We live in a fragile world — a world disturbed \r\nand unsettled, a world that is marked by conflicts, \r\ncontroversies and confrontations of an entirely new \r\nnature. The architecture and mindsets of yesterday’s \r\nworld are giving way to a web of new challenges. \r\nYesterday, it was all about blocs, ideologies, the cold \r\nwar and appeasement. Today, it is all about ethnicity, \r\nconflicts, burning regions, colliding religions, mass \r\ndestruction, terror and poverty. \r\n Today, international order is marked by three \r\nextremely demanding and global challenges: global \r\ntensions, global imbalances and global constraints. In \r\nthat triangle, we need to strive to deliver sustainable \r\nsolutions. Our responsibility is enormous — indeed, \r\neven as we seek to ensure global opportunities, \r\nfreedom and shared values, this new world in the \r\nmaking is in danger of lapsing into mistrust, \r\ndisagreements and divisions. \r\n We live in a world of extraordinary inequalities in \r\nopportunity, but our world is also a global and \r\ninterdependent one, where a broad sharing of economic \r\nand political opportunities could serve as an effective \r\ninstrument for economic growth and development. In \r\nso doing, we can start turning the internationally \r\nagreed development goals, including the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, into action. \r\n My country is aware that a greater mobilization \r\nof domestic resources in developing countries is a \r\nnecessity. Croatia has made significant progress in \r\ncreating an enabling environment for partnership and \r\ninnovation. Tremendous changes have taken place in \r\nthe development of a market economy, changing \r\nownership structures, creating a business environment, \r\nand reforms in the public and private sector. Above all, \r\nCroatia has progressed in ensuring domestic \r\ndemocratic stability and a prosperous international \r\nposition as a framework for long-term development. \r\n Croatia supports the commitments to the goals \r\nand targets deriving from the United Nations summits \r\nin Monterrey and Johannesburg, and the related \r\nprocesses, such as the Doha Development Agenda and \r\nthe Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. We also \r\nsupport the emphasis on achieving the targets in \r\ndeveloped countries for official development assistance \r\nbased on actual needs — rising from today’s 0.33 per \r\ncent of gross national income to at least 0.51 per cent \r\nby 2010 and 0.7 per cent by 2015 — to meet the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and each country’s \r\nabsorption capacity. We recognize that mobilizing \r\nfinancial resources for development and the effective \r\nuse of those resources in developing countries are \r\ncentral to a global partnership for development. \r\n Still, simply raising the level of official \r\ndevelopment assistance is not enough to enable the \r\ninternational community to fulfil its obligations \r\ntowards the countries in need. It is also necessary to \r\ncontribute to a more equitable distribution of aid that, \r\nunfortunately, quite often remains outside the regular \r\neconomic and financial flows. Croatia also welcomes \r\ninitiatives to enhance the quality of aid and to increase \r\nits impact, bearing in mind the fact that progress both \r\nfor donors and for partner countries can be facilitated \r\nby the harmonization efforts at the international and \r\nregional levels. Therefore, we stress the need for an \r\nintegrated approach among international institutions. \r\nA/61/PV.13  \r\n \r\n06-52885 38 \r\n \r\n Croatia recognizes the needs of Africa, especially \r\nsub-Saharan Africa and the least developed and \r\nlandlocked developing States, as well as the special \r\nvulnerabilities of small island developing States. We \r\nare therefore pleased that those groups of countries \r\nreceived specific reference in the Outcome Document \r\nof 2005, thus emphasizing their particular needs and \r\ncircumstances. The less fortunate must not be left \r\nbehind. Special attention should be given to countries \r\nemerging from wars and undergoing a costly, complex \r\nand highly demanding post-conflict management \r\nprocess. \r\n Croatia strongly supports yesterday’s official \r\nlaunching of the International Drug Purchase Facility \r\ninitiative. We see it as a significant step forward and \r\nexpress our hopes that all countries will render their \r\ncontribution. \r\n As a contributor to various United Nations \r\nprogrammes and funds, my country confirms its \r\ncapacity to support the activities of the United Nations \r\nin numerous fields. We will increasingly continue to do \r\nso. During the past few years, Croatia has started to \r\ncontribute voluntarily to a number of United Nations \r\nactivities, programmes and bodies: the United Nations \r\nChildren’s Fund, the United Nations Trust Fund for \r\nAfrican Development and the Office of the High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights, to mention but a few. \r\nBeing a small country, Croatia has limited financial \r\nand human resources, but that will not hinder us from \r\nsharing, helping and assisting. \r\n Global economic and human development must \r\nremain in our focus, but as we meet today, the focus is \r\nvery much on global tensions and instability. Today, \r\nmany ongoing regional crises continue to cause great \r\nhumanitarian tragedies around the world, seriously \r\ndestabilizing regional and global security. Those arcs \r\nof instability are creating a network of fear and anger \r\nacross many parts of the world. Terrorism is taking on \r\nnew dimensions and forms. Weapons of mass \r\ndestruction are yet another cause of grave concern. \r\nEconomic imbalances and social impediments are \r\nbecoming new sources of instability across the world. \r\nReligious divisions and misunderstandings add a new \r\nand dangerous dimension to insecurity in the world. \r\n The significant growth of international terrorism \r\nhas caused an unhealthy atmosphere of mistrust, \r\nreligious and cultural intolerance, and grave \r\ninfringements of human rights. Those consequences \r\nhave in time developed into their own separate and \r\nextremely dangerous problems that exponentially \r\nthreaten already fragile international relations. \r\n The Republic of Croatia, as a member of the \r\nglobal anti-terrorist coalition, strongly condemns \r\ninternational terrorism in all its forms and \r\nmanifestations and, bearing in mind the ever-evolving \r\nthreat of terrorism — especially weapons of mass \r\ndestruction and cyber-terrorism — calls for even \r\nstronger global cooperation in the suppression of that \r\nmodern-day scourge. \r\n We must prove to our nations that we will stay \r\nfirm and united against terrorism. In that light, a strong \r\ncommitment to achieving a global consensus on a \r\ndefinition of terrorism and a final adoption of the \r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism \r\nare very much needed and would reaffirm the central \r\nrole of the United Nations in the suppression of \r\nterrorism. It that respect, we welcome the United \r\nNations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, launched \r\nyesterday, and express our hope that all countries will \r\nimplement it. \r\n The Republic of Croatia has established very \r\ngood cooperation with the United Nations, especially \r\nthe Security Council’s Counter-Terrorism Committee \r\nand its Executive Directorate. Additionally, on 15 and \r\n16 May, a Monitoring Team for the implementation of \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1267 (1999) visited \r\nCroatia and met with representatives of all relevant \r\nGovernment bodies involved in the suppression of \r\nterrorism. \r\n Year by year, we continue our great cooperation \r\nwith the Terrorism Prevention Branch of the United \r\nNations Office on Drugs and Crime in Vienna, which \r\nhas resulted in a recently held national expert \r\nworkshop on international cooperation in criminal \r\nmatters related to terrorism, organized through our \r\njoint cooperation in June this year in Valbandon, \r\nCroatia. \r\n Weapons of mass destruction and a common \r\napproach to non-proliferation must remain our focus. \r\nResponsibility for world peace and security must \r\ncontinue to be the key guideline in dealing with that \r\ngrave challenge. The rules and standards must be \r\nglobally accepted and the United Nations and its \r\nspecialized institutions and agencies must continue to \r\nplay a pivotal role. \r\n A/61/PV.13\r\n \r\n39 06-52885 \r\n \r\n My country won its liberty only a decade ago. \r\nAggression and crises in our part of Europe presented \r\nthe entire international community with a new \r\nchallenge at that time. Regional conflicts emerged as \r\nthe new and disturbing roots of new dangers to \r\ninternational peace, and they remain a challenge in \r\nmany parts of the world. In that light, stability and \r\npeace in South-East Europe and post-conflict \r\nmanagement and cooperation must be viewed as a \r\nsuccess for the international community and the \r\ncountries involved. \r\n My country played and continues to play a \r\nprominent and leading role in providing for long-term \r\nstability, cooperation and democratic development for \r\nall of South-East Europe, based on the commonly \r\nshared vision of a new, united and secure Europe. \r\nAlready negotiating future full membership in the \r\nEuropean Union, and based on the progress of reforms \r\nin the military and the security sector — as well as \r\nstanding at the threshold of NATO membership — \r\nCroatia is today an anchor of stability, security and \r\ncooperation. Croatia is therefore an indispensable \r\npartner in the historical transformation of that often-\r\ntroubled and critically important region for European \r\nand world peace, transforming it into a zone of modern \r\nsociety and democratic standards and values. \r\n Croatia’s specific position as a Central European, \r\nDanubian and Mediterranean country provides added \r\nvalue in bilateral and multilateral contacts and \r\nexperience, stemming from its participation in \r\nnumerous global, European and regional organizations \r\nand initiatives in the fields of security, democratic \r\ndevelopment and economic cooperation, including \r\nCroatia’s current presidency of the South-East \r\nEuropean Cooperation Process. \r\n Stability, democratic development and \r\ncooperation, as well as the resolution of remaining \r\nopen issues and completing the security architecture of \r\nthat part of Europe, will also have to be closely linked \r\nto the indispensability of the protection and promotion \r\nof universal values, the rule of law, human rights and \r\ndemocracy, as well as their interrelationship with \r\nsecurity and development. \r\n Croatia supports efforts to accelerate democracy’s \r\nmovement around the world, particularly through such \r\nintergovernmental organizations as the Community of \r\nDemocracies. Last year, as a signatory of the Warsaw \r\nDeclaration of the Community of Democracies, the \r\nRepublic of Croatia contributed to the founding of the \r\nUnited Nations Democracy Fund to reaffirm its \r\ncommitment to encouraging other countries on their \r\npath to democratization. \r\n Croatia welcomes the fact that the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC) has begun work on its first cases. \r\nWe attach great importance to the continuation of the \r\nICC’s successful work. Croatia also welcomes the fact \r\nthat the number of States parties to the Rome Statute \r\nhas reached and surpassed 100, and we hope that the \r\nnumber will continue to rise. The Republic of Croatia \r\nalso supports the work of the International Criminal \r\nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in pursuing \r\nits completion strategy. Croatia continues to fully \r\ncooperate with the ICTY as part of our own \r\nadvancement towards the rule of law, and also as an \r\nindicator and impetus for the region, with the aim of \r\novercoming the legacy of the recent past in South-East \r\nEurope. \r\n The Republic of Croatia has been a member of \r\nnumerous United Nations bodies and very active in \r\norganizing and hosting conferences and other \r\nmultilateral activities. My country is now ready to take \r\nthe next step in strengthening our responsibility as a \r\nMember of the United Nations. For that reason, the \r\nRepublic of Croatia has presented its candidature for a \r\nnon-permanent seat on the Security Council for the \r\nterm 2008-2009 at the elections to be held in 2007. \r\n Croatia recognizes the importance of global \r\nmultilateralism, as well as the growing significance of \r\nregional organizations in tackling the challenges of \r\ntoday’s world. The role of the United Nations in the \r\npromotion of international cooperation for \r\ndevelopment and the achievement of the development \r\ngoals agreed by the international community must \r\nremain fundamental, pivotal and re-energized. We also \r\nwelcome the strengthening of coordination within the \r\nUnited Nations system, in close cooperation with all \r\nother multilateral financial, trade and development \r\ninstitutions, in order to support sustained economic \r\ngrowth and sustainable development. \r\n Allow me to refer to one of the messages of the \r\nOutcome Document of last year’s Summit — namely, \r\nthe notion that there will be no development without \r\nsecurity and no security without development. We \r\nacknowledge that peace and security, development and \r\nhuman rights are the pillars of the United Nations \r\nsystem and the basis of our collective security and \r\nA/61/PV.13  \r\n \r\n06-52885 40 \r\n \r\nwell-being. We recognize that development, peace, \r\nsecurity and human rights are interdependent and \r\nmutually reinforcing. In facing that challenge, the \r\nUnited Nations system is called on to play an enhanced \r\ndevelopment role. \r\n Croatia welcomes the inauguration of the Human \r\nRights Council and considers it to be a milestone for \r\nthe global promotion of human rights. My country also \r\nwelcomes the establishment of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, which arose from the need for a \r\ncoordinated and integrated approach to post-conflict \r\npeacebuilding. \r\n My country is pleased to have been elected to the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission in May, and I would like to \r\nuse this opportunity to thank all the States that voted \r\nfor us and placed their confidence in Croatia. Our wish \r\nis to contribute actively to the United Nations system \r\nof collective security in an effective and transparent \r\nway, as embodied in the Charter and aligned with the \r\nMillennium Declaration. \r\n Croatia welcomes another visible result of the \r\nefforts to reform the United Nations — the \r\nestablishment of the Human Rights Council as the \r\nmain standing body of the United Nations on human \r\nrights. \r\n Now, allow me to share some remarks on one of \r\nthe most important tasks we need to address. \r\n In this fragile world, the need for an efficient and \r\ndemocratic world body is ever increasing. The Summit \r\nof heads of State and Government held in 2005 \r\nprovided us with a platform for further action toward \r\nthe reform of our Organization. There has been noted \r\nprogress on several important reform issues, but we \r\ncannot be satisfied with the pace of the process. My \r\ncountry believes that the reform of the Organization \r\nand of the Security Council must justly take account of \r\nthe interests of all. Croatia advocates the enlargement \r\nof the Security Council in both the permanent and non-\r\npermanent categories of membership, based on \r\nappropriate regional representation in which the \r\nEastern European Group would have two non-\r\npermanent seats. It is of the utmost importance in a \r\nnew, enlarged Council to have an appropriate number \r\nof representatives of the developing countries of the \r\nSouth and better representation of small and medium-\r\nsized countries. \r\n Additionally, the reform of the Council should \r\nextend to its working methods and its interaction with \r\nother principal bodies of the Organization, first and \r\nmost importantly the Economic and Social Council. \r\nThat would strengthen the United Nations in a wide \r\nrange of areas, including peace and security, \r\ndevelopment and human rights. There is also a need to \r\nimprove United Nations management practices and \r\nworking methods to raise the whole system to a higher \r\nlevel of transparency and accountability.  \r\n Mindful that peace and security are prerequisites \r\nfor economic and social prosperity, Croatia would like \r\nto remain engaged in and responsive to current \r\nconcerns on reforming the United Nations system in \r\norder to make it a stronger and more effective \r\nOrganization for times to come. That is our common \r\nresponsibility. We need to act today in order to prepare \r\nourselves in a timely manner for the challenges of \r\ntomorrow. \r\n Although one third of the entire Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals period is already behind us, the \r\ntargets set are, regrettably, not being met at the desired \r\npace. That must be changed as a matter of urgency, as \r\nit is undoubtedly an issue affecting the future security \r\nand stability of the world. We must move forward in \r\nassisting developing countries and other countries in \r\nneed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. \r\n As I mentioned at the outset of my address, \r\nCroatia has presented its candidature for a non-\r\npermanent seat on the Security Council for the term \r\n2008-2009, the elections for which are to be held in \r\n2007. I feel the need to stress that Croatia’s candidacy \r\nis, above all, a measure of Croatia’s responsibility. \r\n I have mentioned the fragility of today’s world. I \r\nhave not mentioned the fragility, uncertainties and \r\nchallenges that Croatia experienced in the recent past. \r\nThey are well known, but at the same time they are the \r\nsource of our understanding of and responsiveness to \r\nthe needs of a fragile world. We believe that we can \r\ncontribute to building a new cooperative world in \r\nresponding to our new challenges and to enhancing our \r\nOrganization. Croatian membership in the Security \r\nCouncil would also serve as a telling demonstration of \r\nthe success of the peace process in South-East Europe. \r\n My country went through a successful transition \r\nfrom being a country receiving peacekeeping forces to \r\none that is now a contributor to 11 of the 18 United \r\nNations peacekeeping operations in various regions \r\n A/61/PV.13\r\n \r\n41 06-52885 \r\n \r\nthroughout the world. Croatia also provides training \r\nand hosts international courses in the field of \r\npeacebuilding. We are therefore well aware of the \r\nadded value that countries that have rebuilt their \r\nnational capacities bring to the credibility of such an \r\nimportant body for the cause of international peace, \r\nsecurity and development. Croatia stands determined to \r\ncontinue to support peace efforts and a strengthened \r\nUnited Nations role on a regional and global level. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Croatia for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Ivo Sanader, Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Croatia, was escorted from the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Sheikh Mohammad \r\nAl-Sabah Al-Salem Al-Sabah, Deputy Prime Minister \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs of Kuwait. \r\n Sheikh Mohammad Al-Sabah Al-Salem  \r\nAl-Sabah (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): I am pleased to \r\nconvey to Sheikha Haya Rashed Al Khalifa, on behalf \r\nof the State of Kuwait, its Government and people, our \r\nmost sincere congratulations to her personally and to \r\nher brotherly country, the Kingdom of Bahrain, on her \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-first session. We assure her of our readiness to \r\ncooperate with her seriously and constructively as she \r\nassumes her heavy responsibilities. \r\n I cannot fail to mention here, with great \r\nappreciation and admiration, the prominent role of the \r\nSecretary-General in his ongoing efforts at the helm of \r\nthis Organization to enhance and energize the work of \r\nits various bodies and to make them more democratic, \r\ntransparent and capable of meeting the challenges of \r\nthis century, and more effective in carrying out the \r\nduties assigned to them in the fields of peace, security \r\nand development. \r\n In that context, Kuwait welcomes the Republic of \r\nMontenegro as a new Member of the United Nations. \r\n In the Outcome Document of the 2005 World \r\nSummit, our leaders expressed their firm belief and \r\nconviction in the important role of this Organization as \r\nan umbrella for multilateral work. They drew a road \r\nmap for us to follow as we seek solutions to the major \r\ninternational threats and challenges that threaten \r\ninternational peace and security, such as terrorism, the \r\ndeterioration of the environment, human rights \r\nviolations, poverty, hunger and the spread of such \r\ndangerous and infectious diseases as AIDS and \r\nmalaria. \r\n Of great concern is the emergence of new \r\nchallenges to international peace and security that are \r\nno less dangerous than those aforementioned, such as \r\nthe incitement of hatred, xenophobia, insults to \r\nreligions, including Islamophobia, together with all \r\nkinds of racial, ethnic and religious discrimination. \r\n A year after the adoption of the Outcome \r\nDocument, and despite the extensive efforts made to \r\nfollow-up the implementation of the Summit’s \r\nresolutions, there is still an urgent need to redouble the \r\nefforts to achieve our objectives in the fields of \r\ndisarmament, non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, \r\ncounter-terrorism, setting a balance between developed \r\nand developing countries in international trade, and \r\nreform of the Security Council to enhance its authority \r\nand efficiency and give greater transparency and \r\nfairness to its decisions by according due consideration \r\nto the representation of the small States that make up \r\nmore than half the membership of the United Nations. \r\n The State of Kuwait hopes that efforts will be \r\nenhanced to promote dialogue and advance \r\ninternational coordination and cooperation to overcome \r\nthe problems that impede the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals in various regions of \r\nthe world. Kuwait will maintain its course in adhering \r\nto the provisions, principles and purposes of \r\ninternational agreements and conventions. \r\n While we take pride in the social, economic and \r\npolitical development that has been achieved in \r\nKuwait, as reflected in the annual international reports \r\nissued by the specialized agencies of the United \r\nNations, we will not be distracted from pursuing our \r\nefforts to further improve the social and economic \r\nconditions that favour the Kuwaiti citizen’s standard of \r\nliving and prosperity. In that context, Kuwait will \r\ncontinue to support, within its means, the efforts of \r\nmany developing countries to achieve their \r\ndevelopment goals. It will continue to do so through \r\nthe Kuwaiti Fund for Economic Development, which \r\nfinances infrastructure projects by granting soft loans, \r\nwhich to date amount to $12 billion and have benefited \r\nmore than 100 countries around the world.  \r\n Kuwait also contributes to the funding of \r\ndevelopment projects in developing countries through \r\nA/61/PV.13  \r\n \r\n06-52885 42 \r\n \r\nUnited Nations programmes and specialized agencies, \r\nand regional organizations and associations. Within the \r\nframework of supporting international efforts to \r\neradicate poverty, Kuwait announced last month that it \r\nwill provide $300 million to the Islamic Development \r\nBank to combat poverty in Africa. \r\n Kuwait follows with grave concern the difficult \r\nsecurity conditions in brotherly Iraq resulting from \r\nongoing terrorist acts that target the Iraqi people, State \r\ninstitutions and economic and social facilities. Despite \r\nprogress in the political process that has led to the \r\nformation of a constitutionally elected Government, the \r\ndifficult security conditions impede similar progress in \r\nrebuilding what the previous regime destroyed as a \r\nresult of its hostile policies towards its own people and \r\nits neighbours. \r\n Kuwait reiterates its commitment to all relevant \r\nSecurity Council resolutions and vows to continue \r\nsupporting the efforts of the Iraqi Government to \r\npromote democracy and respect for human rights, to \r\nrebuild, confront security problems and achieve \r\nnational harmony between the various segments of the \r\nIraqi people. We hope that the international community \r\nwill also redouble its efforts in support of the efforts of \r\nthe Iraqi Government and the League of Arab States to \r\nachieve security and stability in Iraq, which in turn will \r\ncontribute to consolidating peace and security in the \r\nregion. There is no doubt that a democratic, secure, \r\nstable and economically prosperous Iraq that respects \r\nhuman rights, is a master over its own decisions, \r\nwithout any interference in its internal affairs, and lives \r\nin peace with its neighbours will be in the interest of \r\nall the States of the region without exception. That is \r\nwhat Kuwait hopes for and seeks to achieve. \r\n At the regional level, with regard to the issue of \r\nthe three disputed Emirati islands, Kuwait supports the \r\nposition of the Arab Gulf Cooperation Council and \r\nhopes that negotiations will resume and intensify at all \r\nlevels between the brotherly United Arab Emirates and \r\nthe friendly Islamic Republic of Iran to find a solution \r\nto that conflict in conformity with the principles and \r\nrules of international law and good-neighbourly \r\nrelations, which would enhance the security and \r\nstability of the region. \r\n Concerning the Iranian nuclear issue, Kuwait \r\ncalls on all the concerned parties to spare the region \r\nany crisis that could undermine the security and \r\nstability of that vital region, which for the past two \r\ndecades has been the theatre of conflicts and wars that \r\nhave squandered the fortunes and resources of its \r\ncountries and delayed their development. We therefore \r\nhope that action will be taken to resolve the crisis by \r\ndiplomatic means. We urge the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran to continue its cooperation with the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the international \r\ncommunity in order to dispel any fears or doubts \r\nsurrounding the nature and aims of its nuclear \r\nprogramme. \r\n In that context, we affirm our position on the \r\nneed to make the Middle East, including the Gulf \r\nregion, an area free from all weapons of mass \r\ndestruction. That zone must include Israel, which must \r\naccede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons and subject all its nuclear facilities to \r\nthe safeguards regime of the IAEA. \r\n In recent weeks, the brotherly Republic of \r\nLebanon was subject to a vicious Israeli aggression \r\nthat killed hundreds of innocent civilians, injured \r\nthousands of others, and made more than 1 million \r\npeople refugees. Kuwait immediately and very strongly \r\ncondemned those shameful and inhumane crimes \r\nagainst the brotherly people of Lebanon. Proceeding \r\nfrom its sense of duty and responsibility, and driven by \r\nclose brotherly relations, the Government and people \r\nof Kuwait organized emergency relief operations to \r\nalleviate the suffering of the Lebanese people through \r\nthe Kuwaiti Red Crescent society, other associations \r\nand the private sector. Kuwait also announced the \r\ndonation of $324 million to the efforts to rebuild \r\nLebanon. \r\n While Kuwait welcomes the measures taken by \r\nthe international community to implement Security \r\nCouncil resolution 1701 (2006), it calls on Israel to \r\ncease its repeated aggressions against Lebanon and to \r\nrespect its sovereignty, independence and territorial \r\nintegrity. Kuwait also calls on the international \r\ncommunity to assist the Lebanese Government to \r\nextend its control over all Lebanese territory and to \r\nsupport its endeavours to recover all of its rights, \r\nincluding compensation for its losses as a result of the \r\nIsraeli aggression. \r\n The core of the Middle East crisis is the \r\nPalestinian question. That issue, regrettably, remains \r\nstalled. International endeavours and efforts to move it \r\nforward are met with Israel’s intransigence and refusal \r\nto implement international resolutions, as well as its \r\n A/61/PV.13\r\n \r\n43 06-52885 \r\n \r\ndisregard for international conventions and the \r\nagreements it has signed with the concerned parties \r\nwithin the framework of the peace process. \r\n The continued Israeli occupation of Arab \r\nterritories will always be a source of tension and \r\ninstability in the Middle East. Israel’s repeated military \r\nincursions in the occupied territories, oppressive \r\npractices against the Palestinian people, and \r\nundermining of the Palestinian Authority will not \r\nbenefit the Israeli Government, nor will its continued \r\naggression and deliberate destruction of Palestinian \r\ninfrastructure and national Palestinian institutions \r\nsecure its so-called security. The solution lies in \r\nresolving the root causes of the problem and by \r\nrestoring usurped rights so that all the peoples of the \r\nregion can enjoy peace and stability. \r\n In that context, we renew our full support for the \r\nstruggle of the Palestinian people to recover its lawful \r\npolitical rights and establish its own independent State \r\nover its own land with Jerusalem as its capital. We \r\ndemand that the Israeli Government withdraw from all \r\nthe Arab lands it occupies, including the Syrian Golan \r\nHeights, in implementation of relevant Security \r\nCouncil resolutions and the principle of land for peace. \r\nIn that respect, we reiterate the importance of the Arab \r\npeace initiative adopted in Beirut in 2002 as the only \r\nstrategic option for achieving a permanent, just and \r\ncomprehensive peace in the region. \r\n Since its founding, the United Nations has \r\nregistered numerous accomplishments and \r\ndemonstrated its efficacy in establishing peace and \r\nsecurity in various parts of the world. It has helped \r\nprevent many problems from deteriorating and it has \r\nthereby become an indispensable tool of the \r\ninternational community in confronting global issues \r\nand challenges. It is our hope that the United Nations \r\nrecord of accomplishment in achieving peace and \r\nsecurity will soon include Iraq, the Middle East, the \r\nSudan, Somalia, Afghanistan and other countries that \r\nare still experiencing conflicts and wars that have \r\nkilled countless numbers of their citizens, depleted \r\ntheir resources, destroyed their capacities and delayed \r\ntheir march towards development and progress. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ncall on Her Excellency Ms. Tzipi Livni, Vice-Prime \r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Israel. \r\n Ms. Livni (Israel): These days, the days of the \r\ngeneral debate of the General Assembly, fall this year \r\nat a time of unique significance for the Jewish people. \r\nThey come on the eve of the Jewish New Year and the \r\nDay of Atonement and are known as the Days of Awe. \r\n In Jewish tradition, these are days of soul-\r\nsearching and prayer, of judgement and of renewal. \r\nThat concept of reflection is fitting not just for the \r\nfaithful. It should be a time of reflection for nations as \r\nwell. Let us use this time and this gathering to look \r\ndeeply and honestly at the world in which we live — \r\nthe world as it is and as it might be. The United \r\nNations emerged from the horrors of war and offered a \r\nvision of a new and peaceful world, but we see the \r\nsuffering of the people of Darfur, we see bloodshed and \r\nviolence across the globe, and we know that that is not \r\nyet the world in which we live. \r\n Our planet remains torn by conflict, At its heart, \r\nthis is a conflict about values — a battle of ideas. It is a \r\nconflict about whether to respect or to reject the \r\nother — a conflict between tolerance and tyranny, \r\nbetween the promise of coexistence and the \r\nhopelessness of hate. We see it played out in internet \r\nchat rooms and in houses of prayer, in classrooms and \r\nnewsrooms, on the battlefield and in the corridors of \r\npower. It is the challenge of our time. \r\n We, the people of Israel, have lived for many \r\nyears on the frontlines of this conflict. Our nation has \r\nfelt its fury; our soldiers have fought and died in its \r\nbattles. An ancient people in the heart of the Middle \r\nEast — great in history but small in number — we \r\nhave been a constant target of those that oppose our \r\nvery existence. We face this conflict on different \r\nfronts — as Jews against the dark forces of anti-\r\nSemitism, as Israelis against the enemies of our \r\nstatehood, and as members of the free world against \r\nthe merchants of global terror. \r\n We have been guided in this conflict by two core \r\nvalues that are embodied in our declaration of \r\nindependence and shape our national identity. The first \r\nis that Israel, with Jerusalem at its heart, is the national \r\nhomeland of the Jewish people, their refuge from \r\npersecution, their first and last line of defence. The \r\nsecond is that Israel is a democracy and that the values \r\nof justice, peace and humanity — first expressed by the \r\nprophets of Israel — are an integral part of our nation’s \r\nsense of mission. We share the same values as the \r\ncommunity of democratic States. We are ready and \r\nproud to be judged by them. They are our own.  \r\nA/61/PV.13  \r\n \r\n06-52885 44 \r\n \r\n But too often there is a gap between perception \r\nand reality. Too often, Israel is not seen for its unique \r\ncreativity and spirit of enterprise, or for its \r\ncontribution — well beyond its size — to the sciences \r\nand to literature, to human development and \r\ninnovation. In many parts of the world, we are seen \r\nmainly through the lens of the Arab-Israeli conflict. \r\nAnd too often, that lens is distorted. To many, this \r\nconflict is portrayed as a clash of David and Goliath, \r\nwith Israel perceived unjustly as Goliath, but this \r\nsimplistic image ignores the fact that Israel remains a \r\nthreatened democracy in a hostile region. \r\n We have, of necessity, the capacity to defend \r\nourselves, but we will always be constrained in its use \r\nby our values. And yet, we face an enemy willing to \r\nuse all the means at its disposal to kill without restraint \r\nand without distinction. Every innocent casualty in this \r\nconflict is a tragedy. There is no difference between the \r\ntears of a grieving Israeli mother and a grieving \r\nPalestinian mother, but there is a critical moral \r\ndifference between the terrorists who hunt down \r\ncivilians and the soldiers who target terrorists while \r\ntrying to avoid civilian casualties. \r\n To protect its integrity, the international \r\ncommunity must uphold that basic moral distinction. \r\nTerror is terror, even when it is called resistance. It \r\ncannot be justified and it cannot be equated with the \r\nactions of those seeking only to defend themselves \r\nagainst it. \r\n If we want to protect our values, it is not enough \r\nto believe in them — we must act according to them. \r\nThere is no greater challenge to our values than that \r\nposed by the leaders of Iran. They deny and mock the \r\nHolocaust. They speak proudly and openly of their \r\ndesire to wipe Israel off the map. And now, by their \r\nactions, they pursue the weapons to achieve that \r\nobjective, to imperil the region and to threaten the \r\nworld. The moment of truth is here. \r\n The international community is faced with no \r\ngreater responsibility than to stand against that dark \r\nand growing danger — not for Israel’s sake, but for its \r\nown; for the sake of the values it claims to embrace; \r\nfor the sake of the world we all wish our children to \r\ninherit. What more needs to happen for the world to \r\ntake the threat seriously? What more needs to happen \r\nto end the hesitation and the excuses? We know the \r\nlessons of the past. We know the consequences of \r\nappeasement and indifference. There is no place for \r\nsuch leaders in this forum. There is no place for such a \r\nregime in the family of nations. \r\n For any who still had doubts, the Iranian threat \r\nwas exposed to all in the recent conflict in Lebanon. \r\nArmed, financed and directed by Iran, Hizbullah \r\nkidnapped Israeli soldiers and targeted Israeli cities, \r\nbut it was the hopes of an entire region that they sought \r\nto take hostage. Out of the conflict — and because of \r\nIsrael’s response to it — opportunity has emerged, but \r\nmuch is needed to turn opportunity into reality. \r\nHizbullah can never again be allowed to threaten the \r\nfuture of the region. The world faces a critical test — \r\nto ensure the full implementation of resolution 1701 \r\n(2006) and the immediate and safe release of the Israeli \r\nhostages. \r\n As we gather here, we think of anxious families \r\nthat ache for the return of their loved ones — parents \r\nwaiting for a son, a brother for a brother, a wife for a \r\nhusband. Israel will not rest until all the Israeli \r\nhostages are returned safely to the arms of their \r\ndevoted families and to the embrace of a loving nation. \r\nLet us all make them the same promise today. \r\n Last year, a great leader of Israel, Ariel Sharon, \r\nstood before this forum and said:  \r\n “The Palestinians will always be our neighbours. \r\nWe respect them and have no aspirations to rule \r\nover them. They are also entitled to freedom and \r\nto a national, sovereign existence in a State of \r\ntheir own.” (A/60/PV.5, p.46) \r\n That was not only the voice and vision of one \r\nman. It is the voice and vision of a nation. We do not \r\nbelieve that Israeli-Palestinian relations are of \r\nnecessity a zero-sum game. Not every Israeli interest is \r\nat odds with Palestinian interests. There is, in fact, a \r\ncommon vision that binds together Israelis, moderate \r\nPalestinians and the international community. It serves \r\nthe goals of both peoples and represents the basis of a \r\ngenuine and lasting peace. At its heart is the vision of \r\ntwo States, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in \r\npeace and security. Israel believes in this vision, and \r\nfrom this vision we have drawn our principles for \r\npeace. \r\n The first is inherent in the very idea of two \r\nStates. For the Jewish people, Israel was established to \r\nbe our national homeland. It was the solution for \r\nJewish refugees and the realization of Jewish rights. \r\nAnd this is the true calling of the future State of \r\n A/61/PV.13\r\n \r\n45 06-52885 \r\n \r\nPalestine: a national homeland for the Palestinian \r\npeople — the solution to Palestinian claims, the \r\nfulfilment of Palestinian dreams, the answer for \r\nPalestinian refugees, wherever they may be. If \r\nPalestinian leaders are unwilling to say this, the world \r\nshould say it for them. Instead of giving false hope, it \r\nis time to end the exploitation of the refugee issue and \r\nto begin to resolve it on the basis of the vision of two \r\nStates, two homelands.  \r\n That is the real and only meaning of the two-State \r\nvision. It requires each people to accept that their \r\nrights are realized through the establishment of their \r\nown homeland, not in the homeland of others.  \r\n The second principle for peace is drawn from the \r\nconcept of living in peace and security. On the basis of \r\nthis principle the international community has insisted \r\nthat the State of Palestine that emerges next to Israel \r\ncannot be a terror State. A terrorist State is the last \r\nthing our troubled region needs. It is for that reason \r\nthat the road map requires an end to terror. It is for that \r\nreason that the international community has demanded \r\nthat any Palestinian Government fulfil three basic \r\nconditions: renounce terrorism, recognize Israel’s right \r\nto exist and accept existing Israeli-Palestinian \r\nagreements. Those conditions are not an obstacle to \r\npeace or to the establishment of a responsible \r\nPalestinian State; they are a crucial ingredient for the \r\nrealization of those goals.  \r\n An end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will also \r\nrequire agreement on a common boundary. There are \r\nthose who believe that if only we could turn back the \r\nhands of time to 1967 all would be resolved. But, in \r\n1967 there was no Palestinian State; there was no link \r\nbetween the West Bank and Gaza; and there was no \r\ncommitment to lasting peace. A two-State solution \r\nrequires the creation of a new reality which never \r\nexisted in the past. For it to succeed, both sides will \r\nneed to commit themselves to compromise and to \r\nbelieve in coexistence. \r\n If only we could end the conflict today. But we \r\nhave learned from bitter experience that to reach \r\nlasting peace it is not enough to have a vision. Peace \r\nmust be built on the solid foundations of shared values, \r\nnot the shifting sands of false promises. Without this, \r\nthe political horizon will always be out of reach. We \r\nhave seen negotiations doomed by mistrust and \r\nfrustration. We have seen them lay the ground for \r\ngreater violence, not greater understanding. We cannot \r\nafford to repeat that experience. \r\n Unfortunately, the Palestinian Authority is \r\ndominated today by a terrorist organization that teaches \r\nchildren to hate and seeks to transform the conflict \r\nfrom a resolvable political dispute into an endless \r\nreligious confrontation. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict \r\nis the consequence and not the cause of this ideology \r\nof intolerance and hatred. We cannot reach peace by \r\nignoring these realities. We cannot find the solutions \r\nfor tomorrow without addressing the problems of \r\ntoday. \r\n But we also cannot give up hope, and I refuse to \r\ndo so. In a Middle East where being moderate is often \r\nthe same as being weak, our challenge is to empower \r\nthe peacemakers and disempower their opponents. The \r\nroad map phases and the three international conditions \r\nare designed precisely for that purpose. But if the \r\nworld hesitates in enforcing these standards, the \r\nextremists sense opportunity. And if it appeases, they \r\nsense victory. This is the moment for determination not \r\nhalf-measures and vague formulations. It is the \r\nmoment to demand that those Palestinian leaders that \r\nbelieve in peace determine the future on these terms, \r\nnot on the terms of terrorists. \r\n Unfortunately, there are no shortcuts on the road \r\nto peace. But stagnation is not in our interest, and it is \r\nnot our policy. \r\n It is in this spirit that Israel embarked on the \r\npainful process of disengagement, to create an \r\nopportunity for progress. But, sadly, we received terror \r\nin return. And it is in this spirit that I met with \r\nChairman Abbas two days ago, and we agreed to re-\r\nenergize the dialogue between us and create a \r\npermanent channel to pursue ways to advance together. \r\nThe parties do not need another forum to act out their \r\ndifferences, and the only forum that will resolve them \r\nis the bilateral negotiating table. We have no illusions \r\nabout the difficulties before us. We must face them not \r\nignore them. But we can advance along the road to \r\npeace if we have the strength to defend its principles \r\nand the courage to confront its enemies. \r\n In these days, while Jews prepare to welcome a \r\nnew year, Muslims around the world prepare for the \r\nholy month of Ramadan. As two great faiths begin their \r\nannual journey of reflection and decision, let the \r\nnations of the world begin it too. \r\nA/61/PV.13  \r\n \r\n06-52885 46 \r\n \r\n The Jewish prayers tell us that this is a time of \r\ndecision not just for individuals but also for States: \r\n“which for the sword and which for peace, which for \r\nfamine and which for plenty”. \r\n Those are sobering words, but they are also \r\nempowering ones. The message of these special days is \r\nthat no future is predetermined; no conflict is \r\ninevitable. It is up to us to make the right choices. \r\nHistory will judge us by them. In the words of the \r\ntraditional greeting: may the curses of the last year \r\nend; may the blessing of the new year begin. Shana \r\ntova: may it be a good year. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\nto give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Karel de Gucht, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of \r\nBelgium. \r\n Mr. De Gucht (Belgium) (spoke in French): Just \r\none year ago, our heads of State or Government \r\ngathered in this Assembly and reaffirmed that peace, \r\nsecurity, development and human rights are closely \r\ninterlinked. They also reaffirmed their faith in \r\nmultilateralism and an international order based upon \r\nthe rule of law. The mandate they entrusted to us is \r\nbeing implemented progressively. We have established \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights \r\nCouncil and adopted the Global Counter-Terrorism \r\nStrategy. Our expectations are high and we hope that \r\nthe results will meet them. \r\n During the past year, we have witnessed a rebirth \r\nof multilateralism, and I am happy about that. What \r\nwe, the Member States of the United Nations, do \r\ntogether in a multilateral way will by definition enjoy \r\ngreater legitimacy. I have in mind in particular, the \r\nrecent conflict between Israel and Lebanon, a conflict \r\nin which the Security Council fully assumed its \r\nresponsibilities — and of which the good offices of the \r\nSecretary-General must eventually guarantee a lasting \r\npolitical settlement.  \r\n Likewise, it is worth noting that international \r\ndialogue, rather than the use of force, is again in the \r\nforeground of multilateral diplomacy. Here I have in \r\nmind the case of Iran: we must make every effort to \r\nresolve the difficult nuclear issue while fully \r\nrespecting the principles of the Charter and the Treaty \r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). \r\n That being said, multilateralism, as I see it, is \r\nneither a dogma nor a simple profession of faith. \r\nMultilateralism is an instrument that should be judged \r\nby its impact on world issues. In order to be effective, \r\nit must deliver results. Only action can legitimize its \r\nraison d’être. \r\n Yesterday morning the President of Finland \r\naddressed the General Assembly on behalf of the \r\nEuropean Union (see A/61/PV.10). I entirely endorse \r\nher statement. I will now address a few issues which \r\nare of particular importance to Belgium. \r\n The Middle East has just experienced one of the \r\nworst crises in recent years. A military approach has \r\nled to unacceptable sacrifices by civilians, both in \r\nLebanon and in Israel. In the face of such a crisis, \r\nBelgium and its European partners have clearly \r\ndemonstrated their willingness to act and have \r\nanswered the successive appeals of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. Belgium, for its part, has contributed to the \r\nemergency fund to support the Lebanese Government’s \r\nreconstruction projects. But above all, Belgium has \r\ndecided to participate in the reinforcement of the \r\nUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), \r\nrequested by Security Council resolution 1701 (2006). \r\nIn the coming weeks, 400 Belgian Blue Helmets will \r\nbe deployed in southern Lebanon.  \r\n But the international community’s efforts must \r\nnot stop there. All elements of the Security Council \r\nresolution must be urgently implemented. I salute the \r\nefforts of the Secretary-General and of the States \r\ninvolved, which have brought an end to the blockade. \r\nThe two kidnapped Israeli soldiers must also be \r\nimmediately released. Likewise, we have to work on a \r\nsolution for the release of the Lebanese prisoners in \r\nIsrael. And above all, the arms embargo must \r\neffectively be implemented. Finally, the Lebanese \r\nGovernment must fully exercise its sovereignty and its \r\ncontrol throughout its territory. It has our full support \r\nin that process. \r\n The implementation of Council resolution 1701 \r\n(2006) shows, moreover, that the European Union is \r\nbecoming more involved in the quest for a lasting \r\npeace in the Middle East. That is a welcome \r\ndevelopment. \r\n We all agree that lasting peace is predicated on a \r\nsettlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Therefore \r\nwe must work on all measures which could rapidly \r\nopen a path towards the resumption of the dialogue, an \r\nend to the hostilities, security guarantees for both \r\nparties, the liberation of the abducted Israeli soldier, \r\n A/61/PV.13\r\n \r\n47 06-52885 \r\n \r\nthe release of the political leaders arrested during the \r\ncrisis, humanitarian access, the re-establishment of \r\nbasic services, a start to reconstruction and the transfer \r\nof the tax and customs income due to the Palestinian \r\nauthorities. \r\n We support the efforts of the President of the \r\nPalestinian Authority to form a government of national \r\nunity. Nevertheless, we will be attentive to the content \r\nof its platform and to its response to the three \r\nconditions set by the Quartet. \r\n I share the assessment of the Secretary-General: \r\nin the already tense environment of the Middle East, \r\nthe region can absolutely not afford a new major crisis. \r\nGiven the widespread and justified suspicion aroused \r\nby the Iranian nuclear programme, I appeal to the sense \r\nof responsibility of the Tehran authorities to respond \r\npositively to the offers for negotiation made to them. \r\nIran is a great country, with an ancient and esteemed \r\ncivilization. That heritage, as well as its role in the \r\nregion, must encourage Iran to promote peace and \r\nsecurity and to rebuild confidence with its regional \r\npartners, rather than isolating itself through useless \r\nprovocations. Iran must again take its place in the \r\ncommunity of nations and follow the rules that govern \r\ninternational relations. Iran must comply with the \r\nprovisions of Security Council resolution 1696 (2006). \r\n A first round of presidential elections and \r\nlegislative elections were recently held in the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, thanks to the \r\ncombined efforts of the Congolese authorities, civil \r\nsociety and the international community. It was quite a \r\nchallenge. The Congolese people voted in an orderly \r\nfashion and in great numbers, and thereby \r\ndemonstrated a sense of public responsibility and a \r\ndesire to exercise their democratic rights.  \r\n I pay tribute to the United Nations Organization \r\nMission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo \r\n(MONUC) for the positive role it played, assisted by \r\nthe European Union-led peacekeeping force (EUFOR), \r\nin controlling the skirmishes that occurred at the end of \r\nthe first round. The electoral process now has to be \r\ncompleted; there is no other option. Calm must return, \r\nand the protagonists must commit themselves, in good \r\nfaith, to applying the rules of democracy. The \r\ninternational community must continue to support the \r\nprocess. \r\n However, the elections are but a first step. Next, \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo has to establish \r\nsolid and reliable institutions that are ready to shoulder \r\ntheir responsibilities to the benefit of the people. The \r\npotential resources of the Congo are enormous, and so \r\nare the challenges ahead in the reconstruction of the \r\ncountry. It is crucial that the new authorities \r\nunambiguously demonstrate, their commitment to good \r\ngovernance, both political and economic. \r\n The international community has been a loyal \r\npartner for the Congo during this transition. Its support \r\nand collaboration, particularly through MONUC, will \r\nremain paramount throughout the establishment of the \r\nnew institutions. I hope that the international \r\ncommunity will be able to continue a constructive \r\ndialogue with the new Congolese authorities to the \r\nbenefit of peace, stability and development of the \r\nCongo and of the region. \r\n Following the democratic elections that ended the \r\ntransition period in Burundi took place, the people of \r\nBurundi and the international community had high \r\nhopes for the prospect of stability and development in \r\nthat country. That is why we welcomed the recent \r\nceasefire reached with the Forces Nationales de \r\nLibération (FNL) movement. I fear, however, that \r\nthose hopes might be dashed. The Government’s \r\nreactions towards the press and the opposition, as well \r\nas its management of public affairs, have cast a shadow \r\nover the evolution of the democratic process.  \r\n The Secretary-General himself expressed his \r\nconcerns very clearly about the situation in Burundi. \r\nThe development partners and the regional partners \r\nshare those concerns. All possible means must be used \r\nto consolidate the democratic process in Burundi as \r\nwell as its development potential. Democracy must be \r\nfully exercised, and responsible media, and a \r\nresponsible civil society, are key elements in that \r\nrespect. The rule of law must be strengthened, in the \r\ninterest and with the participation of all. From that \r\nperspective, a dialogue with national political partners \r\nis indispensable. The new Government has a vital role \r\nin this respect. The new Peacebuilding Commission \r\nwill provide us with opportunities to hold a frank and \r\nopen dialogue on all these issues. \r\n As all are aware, these days our Organization is \r\ndevoting greater attention to States emerging from \r\nconflict that are in a period of transition. The danger of \r\nnew tensions in such still-fragile States is very real. \r\nFree and democratic elections are important, but they \r\nare only one part of the process of rebuilding the rule \r\nA/61/PV.13  \r\n \r\n06-52885 48 \r\n \r\nof law. We cannot lose sight of the way in which power \r\nis really exercised. We must rebuild States so that they \r\nare able to assume their responsibilities towards their \r\nneighbours and their own peoples. They must be able \r\nto defend their sovereignty and their borders without \r\nthreatening the stability of their partners; they must \r\nhave professional and loyal armies at their disposal; \r\nand in such States, power must be exercised not to the \r\nbenefit of the few but to respond to the aspirations of \r\nthe people. Good governance should be at the centre of \r\nthe process. \r\n Since the beginning of this year Belgium has held \r\nthe chairmanship of the Organization for Security and \r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE), a regional organization \r\nunder Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United \r\nNations. Its principles and values are the same as those \r\nof the United Nations. Its fields of action are very \r\nsimilar and complementary; they include promotion of \r\nhuman rights, democratization, protection of \r\nminorities, conflict prevention, crisis management and \r\nprotection of the environment, not to mention dialogue \r\namong civilizations, the combat against the \r\nproliferation of small arms, and electoral monitoring. \r\n The OSCE played a key role in maintaining the \r\nrelationship between the two parts of Europe divided \r\nby the cold war. Since that time, the organization has \r\nelaborated a number of norms, principles and \r\ncommitments that unite all its members, which \r\ncontributes to reinforcing their collective security.  \r\n One of the objectives of our chairmanship was to \r\nstrengthen the balance between the three dimensions of \r\nthe OSCE: political and military, economic, and \r\nhumanitarian. We have tried, where possible, to \r\nestablish in those areas synergies with the United \r\nNations, on issues such as the problems of landlocked \r\ncountries, combating organized crime and combating \r\nterrorism. During its chairmanship, Belgium has \r\nworked actively to contribute to a solution to so-called \r\nfrozen conflicts. But such solutions will be possible \r\nonly if can count on the genuine will of all parties \r\nconcerned to move forward. \r\n Some of the criticisms levelled at the United \r\nNations are justified, and we must therefore pursue the \r\nreform process, which must above all strengthen the \r\nlegitimacy, effectiveness and credibility of the United \r\nNations. Those criticisms should not minimize the \r\nsuccesses the United Nations has to its credit. Here I \r\nam referring to the dramatic increase in the number of \r\npeacekeeping operations.  \r\n On the other hand, poverty is decreasing \r\nworldwide, thanks in particular to the dramatic \r\nprogress made in Asia. While the trend of increasing \r\npoverty has not yet been reversed in sub-Saharan \r\nAfrica, the 2006 report on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals stresses that many African \r\ncountries are now showing long-term growth potential \r\nthat could improve the standard of living of their \r\npeoples. \r\n I should like to take this opportunity to pay a very \r\nsincere tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi \r\nAnnan. He has worked tirelessly, placing his political \r\nand negotiating skills in the service of peace, \r\ndevelopment and human rights. I wish to express my \r\ndeep gratitude for the dedication he has shown at the \r\nhelm of our Organization. \r\n The Acting President: I give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Sam Kutesa, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Uganda. \r\n Mr. Kutesa (Uganda): Let me first of all \r\ncongratulate Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa on her \r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-first session. I am confident that, with her \r\nwealth of experience, she will guide our deliberations \r\neffectively. I wish also to thank her predecessor, \r\nMr. Jan Eliasson of Sweden, for the manner in which \r\nhe presided over the high-level segment of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixtieth session. \r\n Let me also pay tribute to Secretary-General Kofi \r\nAnnan for his leadership of our Organization. His 10-\r\nyear tenure has been marked by fundamental changes. \r\nThe United Nations has witnessed major reforms \r\ngeared at creating a more efficient and effective \r\ninstitution. We are confident that he will leave behind a \r\nmore vibrant Organization capable of meeting the \r\nchallenges of our time. \r\n As a firm supporter of multilateralism, Uganda \r\nbelieves that the Assembly is the most appropriate \r\nforum for addressing issues of global concern. A great \r\nnumber of important decisions have been taken by the \r\nAssembly. Landmark agreements have been reached \r\nand important commitments undertaken by members of \r\nthe Assembly. \r\n In spite of all these efforts, threats to global peace \r\nand security and to human dignity are more serious \r\n A/61/PV.13\r\n \r\n49 06-52885 \r\n \r\nthan ever before. This situation obtains today because \r\nwe have yet to start addressing the real root causes of \r\nthe problems facing us. My delegation believes that \r\nensuring global peace will continue to be an uphill task \r\nfor us as long as the majority in developing countries \r\nand elsewhere in the world continue to suffer the \r\nindignity of poverty and deprivation while we continue \r\nto think that it is business as usual.  \r\n We must ask ourselves why a large number of \r\ninternational problems that are high on the agenda of \r\nthe United Nations are occurring in the developing part \r\nof the world. These are real issues that affect the daily \r\nlives of peoples, and they require urgent solutions \r\nwhich have been to date been far too slow in coming. \r\n The onus is on the Assembly to ensure that what \r\nwe agree upon or commit ourselves to doing is done in \r\na timely manner. The Millennium Declaration that we \r\nadopted here 6 years ago (resolution 55/2) remains an \r\nimportant milestone because it introduced a new \r\nparadigm shift from emphasis on statement of \r\ncommitments to action. However, there have been \r\nsome obstacles to the achievement of the goals we set \r\nfor ourselves.  \r\n In areas where progress has been made, due \r\ncredit must be given. In that regard, Uganda welcomes \r\nthe establishment of the Human Rights Council to \r\nwork alongside the Security Council and the Economic \r\nand Social Council. We are also pleased that action was \r\npromptly taken to create the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission as an important intergovernmental \r\nmechanism to assist countries in transition from war to \r\ndurable peace. We welcome those as important \r\ncontributions to the reform agenda of the United \r\nNations. \r\n While commendable progress has been achieved \r\nin other areas of reform, great frustration remains over \r\nthe reform and expansion of the Security Council. In \r\nmy delegation’s view, the expansion of the Security \r\nCouncil is the most important facet of United Nations \r\nreform with regard to the maintenance of global peace \r\nand security. \r\n It is now a truism that the Security Council does \r\nnot reflect today’s geopolitical realities, but only the \r\nbalance of power that prevailed in the 1940s. Africa is \r\nthe only continent with no permanent member on the \r\nSecurity Council, despite its size and population. That \r\nis why Africa is demanding at least two permanent \r\nseats on the Council. We acknowledge that the \r\nexistence of the veto is an anachronism, but as long as \r\nit exists we should demand it, because do not want to \r\njoin as second-class members, with no veto. \r\n Lack of agreement on how to move the \r\ndevelopment agenda forward is one of our major \r\nconcerns. It is unacceptable for big sections of the \r\nglobal community to continue living on less than one \r\ndollar per day while we have the capacity and the \r\nmeans to pull them out of that abject poverty. We must \r\naddress that problem as a matter of urgency. One way \r\nof doing so is to live by our own commitments, as \r\nreflected, for example, in the Monterrey Consensus, \r\nthe Johannesburg Plan of Implementation and the \r\nBrussels Plan of Action, et cetera, et cetera. We must \r\nput in place measurable benchmarks to realize those \r\ngoals.  \r\n It is disappointing to see that very little progress \r\nhas been made to date on official development \r\nassistance, on foreign direct investments, on debts, or \r\neven on market access. The stalled conclusion of the \r\nWorld Trade Organization development agenda is a \r\ncase in point. The Doha Development Round was \r\nlaunched as a process that would eventually give \r\ndeveloping countries a fair chance to compete in the \r\nworld marketplace. It was expected to restore the \r\nmomentum of the open market while giving genuine \r\npriority to the concerns and interests of developing \r\ncountries. Five years down the road, we have not \r\nagreed on opening up markets or eliminating \r\ndiscriminative subsidies. \r\n My delegation strongly feels that part of that \r\nfailure is attributable to the multilateral system’s lack \r\nof good global governance, poor coordination and lack \r\nof coherence. As the United Nations has a \r\nresponsibility to identify the causes hindering the \r\nachievement of the internationally agreed development \r\ngoals, including the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs), the Organization is the right body to track \r\nimplementation of commitments undertaken by \r\ndevelopment partners. An effective mechanism should \r\nbe devised for doing that. \r\n Uganda calls on the international community, and \r\nthe United Nations in particular, to explore new and \r\nmore effective ways of promoting consensus on issues \r\nof vital importance to the peace, security and \r\nprosperity of our global community. In that regard, we \r\nwould like to welcome and encourage the holding of \r\nA/61/PV.13  \r\n \r\n06-52885 50 \r\n \r\nthe high-level events that have been organized \r\nalongside this session.  \r\n The High-level Dialogue on International \r\nMigration and Development held last week has \r\nproduced important outcomes that are going to be \r\nvaluable in the formulation of policies on international \r\nmigration and development. In the same light, the \r\nconvening of the High-level Meeting on the midterm \r\ncomprehensive global review of the implementation of \r\nthe Programme of Action for the Least Developed \r\nCountries is a welcome decision as it will feed into the \r\nmidterm review. \r\n With regard to Africa’s development, the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development — NEPAD — is \r\nthe key framework for action. We continue to urge \r\ndevelopment partners to support Africa’s efforts by \r\ncontributing positively and effectively to the \r\nimplementation of that regional development strategy. \r\nOf the United Nations system in particular we request \r\nthat the funding that comes from United Nations \r\ndevelopment systems should focus on Africa’s \r\npriorities as determined by the partner States, while \r\ncare should be taken to avoid diversion of development \r\nresources to other donor-driven activities. \r\n I would like now to briefly turn my attention to \r\nthe situation in our region. Uganda’s security and \r\ndevelopment is directly interlinked with developments \r\nin the Great Lakes region. We are therefore fully \r\ncommitted to the realization of peace and security, and \r\nhave continued to play a key role in the search for \r\ndurable peace and security in our region.  \r\n We welcome the positive developments in the \r\nsouthern Sudan following the signing of the \r\nComprehensive Peace Agreement. We fully support the \r\ndemocratic process being pursued in the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo. We call upon all parties \r\ninvolved to have full confidence in the process so that \r\nit can be successfully completed. The regional \r\ninitiative on Burundi under Uganda’s chairmanship has \r\nmade steady progress, and we have full confidence in \r\nits success.  \r\n Uganda also wishes to appeal to the international \r\ncommunity, especially our development partners, to \r\nsupport the peace initiatives in the region by \r\ncontributing generously to the success of the \r\nInternational Conference on the Great Lakes Region, \r\ninitiated by the United Nations in collaboration with \r\nthe African Union. \r\n With regard to Somalia, we call for international \r\nsupport for the Transitional Federal Government. We \r\ncall on the Security Council to support the \r\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) \r\npeace process and the partial lifting of the arms \r\nembargo to enable deployment of the IGAD Peace \r\nSupport Mission to Somalia and the African Union \r\nforces. \r\n At the national level, in Uganda there is an \r\norganization called the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA), \r\na terrorist group with no political agenda, which has \r\nfor a number of years unleashed terror on the \r\npopulation of northern Uganda, killing and maiming \r\npeople and abducting children for training as killers \r\nand use as sex slaves. The LRA has now been defeated \r\nand its remnants have fled to Garamba Park in the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. The Government \r\nof Uganda has now entered into peace talks with the \r\nLRA under the mediation of the Government of \r\nsouthern Sudan with a view to restoring peace and \r\nstability. \r\n After a careful analysis of the situation, the \r\nGovernment of Uganda decided to take the painful \r\ndecision to offer amnesty to the LRA top leadership, in \r\norder to facilitate the peace talks. That decision was \r\npainful in the sense that we do not condone or tolerate \r\nimpunity whatsoever. However, we are convinced that \r\nthe alternative traditional justice system that we intend \r\nto apply is an equitable solution and should be given a \r\nchance. We call on the international community to \r\nsupport the process that we have embarked on. We are \r\ndetermined to resolve the conflict peacefully. Peace is \r\nwhat our people want, and it is peace that we are \r\ndetermined to give them. \r\n The Acting President: (spoke in French): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Abubakr Al-Qirbi, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Yemen. \r\n Mr. Al-Qirbi (Yemen)(spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I would like to congratulate the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-first session on her \r\nelection. It is a source of pride for us that an Arab \r\nwoman from brotherly Bahrain is presiding over the \r\nsession. I would also like to thank Mr. Jan Eliasson, \r\nPresident of the Assembly at its sixtieth session, for his \r\nvaluable and tireless efforts in the conduct of our work \r\nand for the positive results he has achieved for our \r\nOrganization, particularly with regard to United \r\nNations reform. I would also like to warmly welcome \r\n A/61/PV.13\r\n \r\n51 06-52885 \r\n \r\nthe Republic of Montenegro as the 192nd Member of \r\nour international family. \r\n I am pleased that this meeting coincides with a \r\nnew democratic achievement in my country, Yemen. \r\nToday, 20 September, the second direct presidential \r\nelection and elections for local councils have taken \r\nplace competitively in a free and fair atmosphere. This \r\ndemocratic exercise demonstrates the maturity of the \r\npeople of Yemen and reflects our country’s \r\ncommitment to democracy as a peaceful means of \r\nsharing power and popular participation in \r\ndevelopment and economic and social reform. \r\n The recent developments in Lebanon and \r\nPalestine include the destruction of Lebanon’s \r\ninfrastructure owing to aggression by the Israeli war \r\nmachine — which has caused the deaths of countless \r\ninnocent civilians, mainly women, children and the \r\nelderly — threats to murder or assassinate the \r\nleadership of Lebanon and Palestine, extrajudicial and \r\nother practices. These all run counter to the United \r\nNations Charter, the rules of international law and \r\ninternational agreements, including the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights and the Fourth Geneva \r\nConvention. The massacres committed by the Israeli \r\nwar machine against Lebanese and Palestinian  \r\ncivilians — particularly the Qana II massacre, whose \r\nvictims were mostly children under the age of 12 and \r\nwhich was witnessed by the entire world — have \r\nevoked feelings of denunciation and condemnation by \r\nall people. This requires a firmer stance in the face of \r\nIsraeli policies based on violence and State terrorism. \r\n It is even more regrettable that the United \r\nNations stands by and watches helplessly while the \r\nLebanese people are subjected to devastation and \r\ndestruction caused by Israeli aggression over 34 days. \r\nWe would like to reiterate that the implementation of \r\nSecurity Council 1701 (2006) should not undermine \r\nthe territorial integrity of Lebanon and should not lead \r\nto sectarian divisions among the people of that country. \r\nIt should also mandate that Israel compensate Lebanon \r\nfor all the destruction. \r\n Israeli practices, such as assassinations of \r\nPalestinian individuals, detention of the President of \r\nthe Palestinian Parliament, the Deputy Prime Minister \r\nor other Ministers, are a perfect example of Israel’s \r\ntotal disregard for international law, human rights, or \r\nagreements signed with the Palestinian Authority. This \r\nmakes it incumbent upon the Security Council to \r\nfirmly deal with such Israeli aggression, to demand the \r\nrelease of all Palestinian leaders under detention and in \r\nIsraeli prisons, and to deal with the Arab-Israeli \r\nconflict neutrally and responsibly. It is only thus that \r\nthe Middle East can enjoy stability and Israel can enjoy \r\nsecurity. \r\n In order to achieve a just and comprehensive \r\npeace, Arab countries have requested that the Security \r\nCouncil consider the Arab-Israeli conflict file \r\nresponsibly and fairly in order to put an end to the \r\nconflict and to spare the region further wars and \r\nconflicts. If the Security Council fails to do that, then it \r\nwill bear the responsibility for continuing the conflict \r\nin the region, with the attendant suffering and dire \r\nconsequences for all parties concerned. \r\n From this rostrum, we call upon the international \r\ncommunity to stand beside the elected Iraqi \r\nGovernment, to help it spread its authority over its \r\nterritory, to put an end to violence and interference by \r\nexternal parties in the internal affairs of Iraq, to respect \r\nthe territorial integrity of Iraq and to put an end to its \r\noccupation. \r\n With regard to the Sudan, we reiterate our \r\nsupport for the efforts by the Sudanese Government to \r\nbring peace to Darfur, in accordance with the security \r\nplan presented to the Security Council. The decision to \r\nextend the mandate of the African Union forces until \r\nthe end of December of this year is welcome. Provision \r\nof adequate logistics and increasing the number of \r\nthese peacekeeping forces will enable them to play \r\ntheir role. The dispatch of any international forces \r\nwithout the agreement of the Government of the Sudan \r\nconstitutes a violation of the principles of the United \r\nNations Charter. \r\n With regard to Somalia, Yemen would like to \r\ncommend the Arab-African efforts for conciliation \r\nbetween the Transitional Somali Government and the \r\nUnion of Islamic Shariah Courts, and the outcome of \r\nthe talks held at Khartoum under the sponsorship of the \r\nLeague of Arab States from 1 to 5 September. We call \r\nupon all international parties to provide support to the \r\nSomali Government so as to enable it to reconstruct the \r\ncountry and re-establish State institutions. Yemen has \r\nalways been a partner in the conciliation process and \r\nsupports all efforts by all parties. Yemen emphasizes \r\nthat any external interference in Somalia’s affairs could \r\nlead to violence and confrontation in the Horn of \r\nAfrica. \r\nA/61/PV.13  \r\n \r\n06-52885 52 \r\n \r\n Yemen underlines the right of all countries to \r\npossess nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. We \r\nhave reiterated our commitment to the General \r\nAssembly declaration to make the Middle East a region \r\nfree of all weapons of mass destruction, including \r\nnuclear weapons, and to compel Israel to comply with \r\nthe Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in order to \r\nguarantee stability in the region and to avoid a nuclear \r\nrace. \r\n Given our concern for the promotion of trust \r\namong all countries seeking to develop their nuclear \r\nenergy for peaceful purposes, we call upon all to \r\ncooperate in the creation of a joint entity for nuclear \r\nresearch for peaceful purposes, in cooperation with the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency. \r\n Yemen has reiterated its condemnation of \r\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We \r\nbelieve that this phenomenon, which is alien to our \r\nsocieties and to the religion of Islam, can be attributed \r\nto many factors, including a feeling of lack of \r\ninternational justice, the spread of misleading \r\njudgements and decrees, and misconceptions of others \r\nbased on race or religion. Such factors have \r\nundermined trust among people and have led to the \r\nspread of extremism and terrorism.  \r\n An international conference should be convened \r\nto reach an agreement on an accurate definition of \r\nterrorism and to deal with its root causes, such as \r\npoverty, unemployment, lack of education and the \r\nabsence of international justice. A distinction should \r\nalso be made between terror against innocent civilians \r\nand the legitimate right of people to resist foreign \r\noccupation. \r\n The Republic of Yemen would like to reiterate its \r\ncommitment to the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) adopted in 2000 and to the Monterrey \r\nConsensus. We are convinced that the mobilization of \r\nfinancial resources for development and their effective \r\nuse in developing countries and in countries with \r\neconomies in transition are essential for the realization \r\nof a genuine global partnership for development. \r\n We would like to stress here the need to grant \r\ndeveloping countries greater freedom in the \r\ndevelopment and management of their development \r\nprogrammes, in accordance with their national \r\npriorities and their special situations, in conformity \r\nwith international strategies for development. \r\n Based on our belief that the individual should be \r\nthe focus of development and its ultimate objective, we \r\nhave given utmost priority to the MDGs and have \r\nmainstreamed them in our policies and five-year \r\ndevelopment plan, 2006-2010, as well as integrated \r\nthem into the economic, environmental and social \r\naspects of our plans. \r\n We have thus adopted a series of measures and \r\nactions for reform in the financial, administrative and \r\njudicial fields, the most recent of which is the total \r\nseparation of the judiciary power from the executive \r\npower and the appointment of an independent chief \r\njudge of the country’s judicial authority. We have also \r\ninvolved civil society organizations, which are key \r\npartners in economic and political development and \r\nprogress, and have cooperated with donor countries, \r\nspecialized agencies and international organizations in \r\nthe implementation of our second five-year plan for the \r\nalleviation of poverty. That plan is based on small \r\nprojects and on the expansion of technical education, \r\nthe provision of basic services, the promotion of good \r\ngovernance and the fight against corruption. It is an \r\nambitious plan that we believe requires international \r\nsupport in order to achieve its objective and result in a \r\nqualitative leap in human development in Yemen. \r\n At the beginning of the twenty-first century, we \r\nmust review the system of international relations to \r\nbase it more on trust, dialogue and cooperation. We all \r\nare in agreement that democracy and the enjoyment of \r\nfreedoms are at the core of desired reform, and here I \r\nshould like to stress that the reform of national and of \r\ninternational policies are two sides of the same coin. \r\n Democracy in international relations helps to \r\npromote democracy in national policies and is a \r\ngenuine motive for it. That requires that the United \r\nNations itself be an example to follow in terms of the \r\nexercise of democracy. Thus reform and restructuring \r\nof the United Nations is required, as well as its \r\nrevitalization and the restoration of its international \r\nstanding and prestige, including through the expansion \r\nof the membership of the Security Council to include \r\nrepresentation by all continents. That should be done in \r\nan equitable manner that guarantees representation by \r\nall cultures and civilizations and also assigns a more \r\nprominent role to the Economic and Social Council in \r\nelaborating international policies relating to economic \r\nand social issues and in the follow-up of their \r\nimplementation. It should be done also in a manner \r\nthat promotes international efforts to move \r\n A/61/PV.13\r\n \r\n53 06-52885 \r\n \r\ndevelopment forward and assist developing countries \r\nto realize the MDGs. \r\n In conclusion, and on behalf of the Government \r\nof the Republic of Yemen, I should like to extend our \r\nthanks and deep appreciation to Secretary-General Kofi \r\nAnnan for his tireless and dedicated efforts in the \r\nconduct of the Organization during his two terms of \r\noffice, working, patiently and diligently, in the service \r\nof humanity. I would like to wish him every success in \r\nhis future endeavours. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): We \r\nhave heard the last speaker in the general debate for \r\nthis meeting. \r\n I shall now call on those representatives wishing \r\nto speak in exercise of the right of reply.  \r\n May I remind members that, in accordance with \r\nGeneral Assembly decision, statements in exercise of \r\nthe right of reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first \r\nintervention and to five minutes for the second \r\nintervention and should be made by delegations from \r\ntheir seats. \r\n Mr. Dolatyar (Islamic Republic of Iran): The \r\nGeneral Assembly today yet again has heard a number \r\nof unsubstantiated and absurd allegations about the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran by the representative of the \r\nIsraeli regime. \r\n Indeed, it has become a tired practice by the \r\nrepresentatives of that regime, which is based on \r\nviolence, occupation, State terrorism and bloodshed, to \r\nmisuse every opportunity to raise unfounded \r\nallegations against others, in an endeavour to distract \r\nthe international community’s attention from its crimes \r\nand State terrorism in the Middle East. \r\n The Israeli regime, ever since its inception and \r\nthroughout all these years of its aggression, State \r\nterrorism and bloodshed, has spared no effort to \r\nmisinform and mislead the international community by \r\nusing different mischievous propaganda methods. It is \r\nnot therefore surprising for the representative of such a \r\nregime, ruled constantly by culprits of various crimes \r\nagainst humanity and war crimes, to present such \r\nbaseless and fabricated propaganda as a remedy for its \r\nillegitimacy and as a smokescreen for its war crimes. \r\n In the last six decades, the Israeli regime has \r\ncontinuously and purposely violated many \r\ninternational laws and norms, as well as dozens of \r\nUnited Nations resolutions, to which the response of \r\nthis illegitimate and irresponsible regime has been \r\nnothing but complete defiance. \r\n In that context, particular reference can be made \r\nto the mischievous policy of the Israeli regime on the \r\nnuclear issue, which is a showcase for its concealment \r\nand unabated pursuance of a nuclear arsenal during the \r\npast decades. It is indisputable that such an \r\nill-intentioned policy has been threatening the peace \r\nand security of the volatile Middle East region for \r\nyears. In fact, the Israeli nuclear danger and its missile \r\ncapacity, coupled with its wicked behaviour and \r\nintentions, presents a real threat not only to regional \r\npeace and security but to the world as a whole. This \r\nthreat, therefore, needs to be urgently and decisively \r\naddressed by the international community. \r\n Indeed, that regime should face a united front and \r\nbe kept under continuous pressure to relinquish its \r\nnuclear programme and to place all its nuclear facilities \r\nunder international monitoring. It is worth mentioning \r\nthat the only existing obstacle to the establishment of a \r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East is the \r\nnon-adherence of that regime to the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and its \r\ncontinued clandestine operation of unsafeguarded \r\nnuclear facilities, with help and technological \r\nassistance from certain States. \r\n That regime has paid no attention to the \r\ncontinuing international calls made in various forums, \r\nparticularly at the 2000 NPT Review Conference, \r\nwhich by name called on that regime to accede to the \r\nNPT immediately and without any conditions. \r\n The baseless allegations and statements made in \r\nthe Assembly tonight by the representative of the \r\nZionist regime demonstrate clearly that those who are \r\nputting my country under growing, unreasonable and \r\nbaseless pressure are in fact trying to serve the interests \r\nof the illegitimate Israeli regime. We believe that the \r\ninternational community and world public opinion are \r\nwell aware of that ploy and therefore will not give in to \r\npressure aimed at protecting the illegal policies and \r\npractices of the Zionist regime and its illegitimate \r\ninterests. \r\n Regarding the recent Israeli aggression against \r\nLebanon, the representative of the Zionist regime \r\nlectured us in this Hall that democracy is good and \r\nterrorism is bad, but she forgot about occupation. She \r\nsaid, “Terror is terror, even when it is called \r\nA/61/PV.13  \r\n \r\n06-52885 54 \r\n \r\nresistance”. It seems that for the Zionist, occupation is \r\nacceptable; the only problem is resistance to \r\noccupation. According to Zionist doctrine and practice, \r\nany kind of resistance to occupation is bad and \r\nforbidden. To Zionists, resistance means extremism; in \r\ntheir view, moderation means pacifism and acceptance \r\nof subjugation. I must remind the representative and \r\nher supporters that occupation is occupation, war \r\ncrimes are war crimes, and brutality and aggression are \r\nbrutality and aggression, regardless of what one calls \r\nthem. \r\n I also wish to speak in right of reply to another \r\ncomment. This morning, the Foreign Minister of the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates made some unacceptable claims \r\nagainst the territorial integrity of my country. Because \r\nwe have clearly and repeatedly placed on record our \r\nposition on that issue, I do not need to go into detail \r\nhere. The Islamic Republic of Iran is fully committed \r\nto its international obligations, especially those arising \r\nfrom the memorandum of understanding of 1971. We \r\nfirmly believe that misunderstandings or other \r\ninterpretations or applications — if any — of the \r\nmemorandum of understanding should be addressed \r\nwith goodwill and through mutually agreed \r\nmechanisms in order to find an acceptable solution. \r\n For its part, my Government has always \r\nwelcomed interaction and exchanges of views between \r\nofficials of Iran and the United Arab Emirates on issues \r\nof interest and concern to both countries. We believe \r\nthat dialogue between our two Governments can play a \r\ndecisive role in dispelling any existing \r\nmisunderstanding. \r\n Mr. Al-Hebsi (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in \r\nArabic): The State of the United Arab Emirates has \r\nalways been careful to clearly express its firm and \r\nprincipled national position on the three islands — \r\nGreater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Moussa — and to \r\nuphold the sovereignty of our country. The presence of \r\nIran on those islands since 1971, which belong to the \r\nEmirates, constitutes an illegitimate military \r\noccupation that violates the letter and the spirit of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, the rules of international \r\nrelations and the provisions of international law. This \r\nsituation must be corrected. \r\n I reiterate what my country’s Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs said earlier today when he invited the \r\nGovernment of the Islamic Republic of Iran to agree to \r\nrefer this matter to the International Court of Justice. \r\nOnce again, I urge Iran to make a serious response to \r\nthe peaceful initiatives of the Government of the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates so that this issue can be resolved \r\nin a peaceful manner, either by participating in \r\npeaceful bilateral negotiations or by agreeing to refer \r\nthe matter to the International Court of Justice and \r\naccepting its legal decision. \r\n The meeting rose at 9.30 p.m. \r\n"
