(Bahrain) \r\n \r\n \r\n The meeting was called to order at 10.30 a.m. \r\n \r\nInternational Day of Peace \r\n \r\n The President: I wish to remind members that, in \r\naccordance with resolution 55/282 of 7 September \r\n2001, today the Assembly is observing the \r\nInternational Day of Peace. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Bingu Wa Mutharika, President of \r\nthe Republic of Malawi \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Malawi. \r\n Mr. Bingu Wa Mutharika, President of the \r\nRepublic of Malawi, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Bingu Wa Mutharika, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Malawi, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly. \r\n President Mutharika: I take this opportunity, \r\nMadam President, to warmly congratulate you on your \r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-first session. My delegation welcomes your \r\nleadership and assures you of our unwavering support \r\nas you carry out your duties. We are confident that \r\nunder your able leadership the reform programmes of \r\nthe United Nations will be advanced. \r\n I also take this opportunity to thank your \r\npredecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, for the leadership he \r\nprovided in steering the affairs of the sixtieth session. \r\nMy delegation noted with satisfaction the service he \r\nrendered, and also noted that under his presidency \r\npositive advances were made towards the reform of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n Malawi welcomes the admission of the Republic \r\nof Montenegro as the 192nd Member of the United \r\nNations. Malawi wishes President Filip Vujanović and \r\nthe people of the Republic of Montenegro continued \r\npeace and prosperity as they chart the way forward and \r\ntake their place in the United Nations. \r\n At the end of this year we bid farewell to \r\nMr. Kofi Annan, who has served as Secretary-General \r\nfor two consecutive terms. I am happy to join previous \r\nspeakers in paying tribute to Mr. Annan for the \r\ndynamic leadership he has provided to the United \r\nNations during his tenure of office. \r\n Mr. Annan had many achievements, but perhaps \r\none of the greatest was his ability to remain calm and \r\nwell focused under great pressure. During his tenure of \r\noffice the United Nations faced daunting challenges, \r\nincluding the fight against famine, hunger and natural \r\ndisasters in many parts of the world; civil wars in \r\nAfrica and conflicts in the Middle East and the Gulf \r\nregion; international terrorism; and the fight against \r\nHIV/AIDS. It is therefore with great pleasure that, on \r\nbehalf of the people of Malawi, and on my own behalf, \r\nI honour and pay tribute to Mr. Kofi Annan for his \r\nsterling service to the United Nations. I trust that he \r\nA/61/PV.14  \r\n \r\n06-52988 2 \r\n \r\nwill continue to be of service to humanity in other \r\ncapacities. \r\n The theme of this year’s session, “Implementing \r\na global partnership for development,” is very \r\npertinent, because during the 2005 session we renewed \r\nthe mandate of the United Nations to meet the \r\nchallenges of the millennium, such as eradicating \r\nglobal poverty and injustice, and the promotion of \r\ndemocracy, human rights, peace, security and stability \r\nin Member nations. We asserted that these are essential \r\ningredients for sustainable economic and social \r\ndevelopment and that they are interlinked and mutually \r\nreinforcing in the quest for the betterment and well-\r\nbeing of humanity as a whole. \r\n I believe that in the search for global partnership \r\nfor development the greatest challenge that the United \r\nNations faces is to eradicate the poverty that engulfs \r\nthe majority of humanity. \r\n I believe that global peace, security and stability \r\ncannot be assured if the greater section of humanity \r\nlives in abject poverty. It is our hope that those who \r\nhave will learn to share with those who do not have. \r\n In order to present to the Assembly the need for a \r\nglobal partnership framework as a way to achieve a \r\nfaster and sustainable rate of economic growth, let me \r\nuse my own country as an example. In Malawi we have \r\ndetermined priorities to fast track socio-economic \r\ngrowth for the people. We are cognizant that in a poor \r\nnation like ours everything becomes a priority, but we \r\nhave agreed on a set of “priorities within priorities” \r\nthat we want to implement in the next five years. These \r\nare agriculture and food security, irrigation and water \r\ndevelopment, transport and communications \r\ninfrastructure, energy, integrated rural development \r\nand the prevention and management of HIV/AIDS. We \r\nbelieve that, when fully implemented, these sectors \r\nwill, together, pull our people out of poverty. \r\n We have given the highest priority to agriculture \r\nand food security because this sector is a mainstay of \r\nour economy and we intend to make Malawi a hunger-\r\nfree nation. We are assisting smallholder and peasant \r\nfarmers to increase their productivity in food and cash \r\ncrops by providing cheap fertilizers and high-quality \r\nfarm inputs. This will provide food security as well as \r\nexpand agro-processing industries, and it will mean \r\nadding value to our products. We seek international \r\nsupport in this area. \r\n Secondly, we need international partnership in \r\nirrigation and water development. This would reduce \r\nour country’s dependence on rain-fed agriculture. We \r\naim at having small-, medium- and large-scale \r\nirrigation schemes and the construction of multi-\r\npurpose dams throughout the country. This will enable \r\nMalawi to produce enough food even when rains fail. \r\n Thirdly, we consider transport and \r\ncommunications infrastructure to be essential for \r\ngrowth and development and, indeed, a good candidate \r\nfor international partnership. We are convinced that \r\nthrough well developed road networks we will not only \r\nimprove movement of goods and services from rural \r\nareas to the urban centres, but also enhance domestic \r\nand international trade. \r\n More importantly, Malawi seeks global \r\npartnership in opening up access to the Indian Ocean \r\nthrough the existing Shire-Zambezi waterway, which is \r\nnavigable all the way from an inland port in Malawi to \r\nthe port of Chinde, in Mozambique, on the Indian \r\nOcean, only 238 kilometres away. This waterway \r\nwould benefit Malawi and other southern African \r\ncountries, especially Mozambique, Zambia, Rwanda, \r\nBurundi and Zimbabwe. \r\n Fourthly, Malawi has selected energy as another \r\narea of international partnership. We believe that it is \r\nimperative for our country to develop adequate and \r\nreliable energy for agriculture, irrigation, transport, \r\nindustry and all other areas of economic \r\ntransformation. \r\n Fifthly, Malawi would welcome international \r\npartnership in promoting integrated rural development \r\naimed at eradicating poverty among the rural \r\ncommunities. We have recognized that the economic \r\nstratification of our country is such that the greater \r\npercentage of the people live in rural areas in squalid \r\nconditions. We seek donor support to boldly take \r\ndevelopment to rural areas through promoting rural \r\ngrowth centres. \r\n Lastly, Malawi seeks international partnership in \r\nHIV/AIDS prevention and management. We recognize \r\nthat our country on its own, without the full support of \r\nthe international community, cannot successfully wage \r\nthe battle against HIV/AIDS. I am happy to say that \r\nduring the past two years Malawi has made tremendous \r\nprogress in AIDS awareness campaigns, the supply of \r\nanti-retroviral drugs and voluntary testing. \r\n A/61/PV.14\r\n \r\n3 06-52988 \r\n \r\n This is Malawi’s agenda for implementing a \r\nglobal partnership for development. I am submitting \r\nthis agenda to the United Nations for support. \r\n Before I end my statement, I need to mention two \r\nimportant issues. \r\n First, through a global partnership, Malawi has \r\nreached the completion point of the Heavily Indebted \r\nPoor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. I and the people of \r\nMalawi are truly grateful that our multilateral debts \r\nhave been cancelled by the International Monetary \r\nFund and the World Bank. We thank the [G-8 countries \r\nfor spearheading the Initiative and for their \r\ncommitment to it. We believe that this is a true \r\nexample of global partnership in development. \r\n The second issue that is germane to global \r\npartnership is for me to reiterate my plea for the \r\nreadmission of the Republic of China – Taiwan — as a \r\nMember of the United Nations. Many of those present \r\nwill agree that since the end of the cold war, and with \r\nthe advent of globalization, Taiwan has quietly \r\ncontributed to the work of the United Nations and its \r\nspecialized agencies in various areas, including \r\ntechnology, medicine, research, industry and \r\ninternational trade. That contribution becomes \r\nincreasingly important, especially within the principle \r\nof universality, equity and justice. \r\n Let me conclude by drawing attention to the \r\nreport entitled “In larger freedom: towards \r\ndevelopment, security and human rights for all”, by \r\nMr. Kofi Annan, who stated: \r\n “The right to choose how they are ruled, and who \r\nrules them, must be the birthright of all people, \r\nand its universal achievement must be a central \r\nobjective of an Organization devoted to the cause \r\nof larger freedom.” (A/59/2005, para. 148) \r\n To me, such larger freedom means the freedom of \r\nevery nation to belong to the United Nations, the \r\nfreedom from oppression of one nation by another, and \r\nfreedom for every nation to contribute to the global \r\npartnership for development. These are the freedoms of \r\nthe United Nations that should be cherished and \r\nupheld. \r\n I therefore appeal to the Security Council to \r\nreconsider the fact that Taiwan should be granted \r\nobserver status in the United Nations and its \r\nspecialized agencies, pending a full review of its \r\nmembership. I am convinced that continued denial of \r\nTaiwan’s participation in the community of nations \r\nposes a moral and legal challenge to the United \r\nNations. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Malawi for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Bingu Wa Mutharika, President of the \r\nRepublic of Malawi, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Boris Tadić, President of the \r\nRepublic of Serbia \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Serbia. \r\n Mr. Boris Tadić, President of the Republic of \r\nSerbia, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Boris Tadić, President of \r\nthe Republic of Serbia, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly. \r\n President Tadić (spoke in Serbian; English text \r\nprovided by the delegation): First, I sincerely thank \r\nMr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General, for all the \r\nefforts he has made throughout his very successful \r\nmandate during a time of enormous challenges facing \r\nour civilization. I particularly single out his \r\nexceptional understanding of the problems that south-\r\neastern Europe has faced and is still facing. \r\n I also congratulate you, Madam President, on \r\nyour election. \r\n At the same time, I warmly welcome the \r\naccession of Montenegro to the United Nations as a \r\nnew Member State. \r\n I am addressing the General Assembly today as \r\nPresident of the Republic of Serbia, an independent \r\nand democratic State in south-eastern Europe, in the \r\nBalkans. I assure the Assembly that Serbia seeks to \r\nmake a significant contribution to this part of the \r\nworld — in terms of fast democratization and respect \r\nfor human rights, economic development, the security \r\nof the entire Balkans and the stability of south-eastern \r\nEurope. Instead of being a place where problems are \r\ncreated, Serbia and the Balkans must become a place \r\nwhere problems are resolved in a peaceful manner. \r\nA/61/PV.14  \r\n \r\n06-52988 4 \r\n \r\n Serbia is simultaneously a new and an old \r\nState — new, because its flag is flying for the first time \r\nin front of this building, and old, because already in \r\n1835 its Constitution guaranteed freedom to any man \r\nsetting foot on its soil; new, because it is being created \r\nagainst the backdrop of the specific challenges of the \r\ntwenty-first century, and old, because it is created in \r\naccordance with the very principles it helped to \r\nestablish and embody in the Charter of the United \r\nNations in 1945. \r\n Today Serbia is an active Member of the United \r\nNations. We believe that the decisions made under the \r\nOrganization’s auspices have to form the basis of \r\nstability and prosperity for all States and peoples in \r\nsouth-eastern Europe. \r\n Serbia believes in a shared and prosperous future \r\nfor the Balkans. It is important to stress that none of \r\nthe current problems in the Balkans can be viewed or \r\nresolved in isolation, without taking into account our \r\ncommon history and a vision of our shared future. \r\nHence, in dealing with any problem in the Balkans, it \r\nis necessary to hear and give weight to the opinions of \r\nall countries in the region. \r\n I trust that a better future for our part of the world \r\nwill be based upon three major principles: democracy, \r\nas a guarantor of human freedom and the basis of \r\neconomic progress; the security of each State, as a \r\nprecondition for the security of the entire Balkans; and \r\nregional stability, as a vital factor of global peace and \r\nprosperity. All the challenges we face should be tackled \r\nin accordance with those principles.  \r\n In that spirit, Serbia is sincerely committed to the \r\nterritorial integrity of all Balkan States and the \r\npreservation of their existing borders. In the same vein, \r\nthe integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, based on the \r\nDayton Accords, which may be changed by its citizens \r\nonly with the consensus of all three constituent \r\npeoples, is an essential factor in the stability and \r\nfurther democratization of the region. By the same \r\ntoken, the preservation of the sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity of Serbia is in the interest of \r\ndemocracy and the prosperity of all of south-eastern \r\nEurope. \r\n Strengthening regional cooperation is Serbia’s \r\npriority. That is why we believe that the prosperity of \r\nall neighbouring countries is in the interest of Serbia. \r\nWe are aware that the Balkan countries can make \r\nprogress and achieve their primary foreign policy \r\nobjective — European Union and Euro-Atlantic \r\nmembership — only through cooperation.  \r\n In this regional framework, we also wish to \r\nactively cooperate in the fight against organized crime, \r\ncorruption and international terrorism. As a concrete \r\ncontribution to this goal, at my initiative, a meeting of \r\nthe Heads of State of south-eastern Europe will soon be \r\nheld in Belgrade, aimed at promoting communication \r\nand strengthening cooperation in the fight against these \r\nthreats to the life and prosperity of us all. \r\n Serbia sees the Balkans as a common space, in \r\nwhich it is possible to achieve political and social \r\nstability. The achievement of that goal should be an \r\nimportant contribution to efforts conducive to full \r\ndemocratization and peace. It is based on the principle \r\nof shared responsibility of all Balkan States. That is \r\nwhy none of the Balkan States must feel a loser as we \r\nmove closer to a joint European future. \r\n Kosovo and Metohija is currently under United \r\nNations interim administration. The settlement of \r\nKosovo’s future status is one of the most difficult \r\nproblems facing Serbia, the other Balkan countries and \r\nthe international community, as well as the Albanian \r\nand Serbian people in Kosovo. That is why we believe \r\nthat this problem should be addressed in a strategic and \r\nsubstantive manner in order to arrive at a solution that \r\nwill take into account the full complexity of relations \r\nin the Balkans. That poses certain requirements: to face \r\nthe past, to find sustainable solutions for the present \r\nand to open up avenues of cooperation in the future. \r\n But, of course, this does not imply that the \r\nKosovo case is unique, different from all others. On the \r\ncontrary, the Kosovo problem must be approached on \r\nthe basis of recognized principles of international law \r\nand universal democratic values. If there is failure in \r\nthat, we shall not be able to escape the vicious circle of \r\nold animosities and mutual recriminations. \r\n What it seeks for itself, Serbia seeks for the \r\nprovince, too: promotion of democracy, respect for \r\nhuman rights, economic prosperity and security. In \r\norder to contribute to that goal, Serbia has decided to \r\nensure power supply this winter from its own resources \r\nto Kosovo’s population. \r\n It is in the interest of Serbia that Kosovo be \r\nstable, prosperous, economically viable, multi-ethnic \r\nand democratic. Before its future status is determined, \r\nit is of crucial importance to establish the rule of law \r\n A/61/PV.14\r\n \r\n5 06-52988 \r\n \r\nand put an end to seven years of discrimination against \r\nthe Serbs as well as other non-Albanian communities, \r\nwho suffer as the target of extremism and terrorism. \r\n The autonomy offered by Serbia to Kosovo \r\nAlbanians is broader than any currently enjoyed by any \r\nregion or federal unit in Europe. In our view, that is a \r\nsustainable, stable and long-standing solution that \r\nwould open a new chapter in the long and difficult \r\nhistory of Serbian-Albanian relations. Among other \r\nthings, it would enable Kosovo to have direct access to \r\ninternational financial institutions, necessary for its \r\neconomic recovery and development, which are in the \r\ninterest of both Serbia and the region as a whole. \r\n Serbia is genuinely committed to the achievement \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals, technological \r\nadvancement and economic prosperity. Large-scale \r\npoverty, which unfortunately still prevails, deeply \r\naffects human dignity. \r\n Today, 21 September, we observe the \r\nInternational Day of Peace. It is important that it be \r\nobserved each year in an effort to put an end to wars \r\nand violence in the world. Many crises have not yet \r\nbeen resolved, and some continue to escalate \r\ndangerously, while new challenges threaten to generate \r\nnew conflicts, destruction and humanitarian \r\ncatastrophes. \r\n An important aspect of preserving peace and \r\nsecurity is efficient and timely deployment of United \r\nNations peacekeeping forces. Serbia supports the \r\nefforts to strengthen the effectiveness of United \r\nNations peacekeeping, and my country is ready to \r\nmake an active contribution to these operations. The \r\nmandate of peacekeeping operations is today more \r\ndiverse than it used to be and includes conflict-\r\nprevention, peacekeeping, post-conflict reconstruction \r\nand assistance to long-term and sustainable \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Following several years of conflict, the Balkans \r\nis slowly but surely turning into a zone of good-\r\nneighbourliness and cooperation. Serbia is prepared to \r\ndeal with the burden of its recent past in the interest of \r\nits Balkan and European future. The people of Serbia \r\nstarted doing this successfully and democratically in \r\n2000, when they removed the regime largely \r\nresponsible for the hardships that befell Serbia and the \r\nBalkans in the last decade of the twentieth century. \r\n Precisely for that reason, we are firmly \r\ncommitted to the successful completion of our \r\ncooperation with the Hague Tribunal. This is not \r\nmerely our international obligation; it is also a question \r\nof moral values. \r\n As a responsible State and a part of the \r\ninternational community, Serbia is truly devoted to \r\nhonouring the Charter of the United Nations and \r\nbuilding democracy in the world. Therefore, Serbia is \r\nfirmly committed to making its full contribution to the \r\nstrengthening of the role and mandate of the United \r\nNations, as well as to multilateral dialogue leading to \r\nequal cooperation among States and peoples, to respect \r\nfor human rights and freedoms, and to tolerance and \r\nmutual respect. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Serbia for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Boris Tadić, President of the Republic of \r\nSerbia, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Álvaro Uribe Vélez, President of the \r\nRepublic of Colombia \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Colombia. \r\n Mr. Álvaro Uribe Vélez, President of the Republic \r\nof Colombia, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Álvaro Uribe Vélez, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Colombia, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly. \r\n President Uribe Vélez (spoke in Spanish): I \r\ncongratulate you, Madam President, and wish you the \r\ngreatest success in this session. \r\n Four years ago I attended this global forum for \r\nthe first time to announce that Colombia was beginning \r\nan era of democratic security. I explained why security \r\nin our time is a democratic value without which \r\nfreedoms cannot prosper; it is also a centre of \r\nresources, in whose absence investment does not flow \r\nand the possibility of eliminating poverty and building \r\nequality remains elusive. \r\nA/61/PV.14  \r\n \r\n06-52988 6 \r\n \r\n Four years ago I explained to the Assembly why \r\nour concept of security is democratic and thus deserves \r\nthe support and confidence of all peoples and of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n I am aware that I could not address the Assembly \r\ntoday to propose a theory of democratic security; \r\nhaving been President of my country for four years, I \r\nfeel compelled to present the results of this policy. \r\nColombia has held four general elections and countless \r\nlocal elections over this period. The referendum and \r\nthe election of mayors and governors in 2003 were \r\nevents that tested our democratic meaning of security. \r\nThis year the presidential and congressional elections, \r\nheld on two separate dates under a high threat of \r\nterrorism, were nonetheless among the most peaceful \r\nin many decades. All political groupings enjoyed \r\neffective guarantees, regardless of their level of \r\nsupport for or opposition to the Government. \r\n Under democratic security, Colombia has elected \r\nmayors, governors and members of Congress of all \r\npolitical colours. Security has contained terrorism in \r\norder to give democracy free expression. \r\n There is still much to be done in the area of \r\nsecurity, and a definitive peace is not yet within sight, \r\nbut progress is undeniable. The effective protection of \r\nColombians translates into the reduction in the number \r\nof homicides, kidnappings, acts of terrorism, crimes \r\nand threats against journalists and trade union leaders. \r\nAll governors and mayors exercise their powers in \r\ntheir own jurisdictions, overcoming the nightmare of \r\nexile that many were subjected to as a result of terrorist \r\nactions that were not countered by the State. \r\n To guarantee the sustainability of security over \r\ntime, our citizens must give it credibility. Our task is to \r\nbuild credibility based on effectiveness and \r\ntransparency. Consequently, human rights are an \r\nimperative of security. In recent years we have \r\nincreased our security forces by 30 per cent, military \r\noperations have tripled, and at the same time \r\ncomplaints against the security forces have fallen by 38 \r\nper cent. This is all the more important because we are \r\na country with full internal democracy, completely \r\nopen to supervision and international criticism, as \r\nborne out by the presence of an office of the United \r\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights. \r\n In spite of the work still to be done, the most \r\nimportant achievement is our citizens’ positive \r\nassessment of security and the collective determination \r\nto consolidate it. \r\n We regard organized violence for fictitious \r\npolitical motives as terrorism, and security as the path \r\nto peace. When a country has a pluralist, vigorous and \r\nguarantee-granting democracy, armed actions against it \r\nare pure terrorism. To deny this would erase the \r\ndifference between armed combat against dictatorships, \r\nwhich merited the recognition of insurgent groups in \r\nother countries, and the violent aggression suffered by \r\nour democracy, which is terrorism. \r\n The demobilization of more than 40,000 members \r\nof violent groups, as a result of democratic security, \r\nand the efforts proposed by the country to reintegrate \r\nthem into constitutional life, prove that for us security \r\nis the path to peace and reconciliation. \r\n Talking about 40,000 demobilized is easy; \r\ntallying them up is very difficult; demobilizing them is \r\neven more difficult; and reintegrating them is a \r\nmonumental task. Amidst understandable controversy, \r\nwe have made progress in dismantling irregular forces. \r\nToday the vast majority of illegal self-defence \r\ngroups — which, together with the guerrillas, until two \r\nyears ago seemed like powers greater than the State — \r\nare demobilized, and a large percentage of their leaders \r\nare being held by our justice system. These results are \r\nmore eloquent than rhetoric ever could be. I must add \r\nthat the number of demobilized guerrillas is higher \r\nthan the number killed by official forces. \r\n I have come to the United Nations today to ask \r\nfor resolute support for our security policy and our \r\nreintegration programme. The violence in Colombia \r\nhas received much international media coverage, \r\nconstant criticism of the Government and little support \r\nto overcome it. It is time for the international \r\ncommunity to urgently call on violent groups to make \r\npeace without any further delay. The Government is as \r\nfirm in implementing security as it is rigorous in \r\nrespecting democratic rules, and is open and generous \r\nin looking for peace. A sincere willingness for peace \r\nwill not face governmental obstacles to a definitive \r\nreconciliation. \r\n The international community must support our \r\nsecurity policy more decisively. This will bring quicker \r\nresults from our overcoming violence and seeking \r\npeace. \r\n A/61/PV.14\r\n \r\n7 06-52988 \r\n \r\n The financing of violent groups by illicit drugs is \r\none of the fundamental aspects that differentiate those \r\ngroups from former guerrillas in other Latin American \r\ncountries. This criminal, bottomless and autonomous \r\nfinancing is the main obstacle to peace.  \r\n It grieves me to say that progress in the fight \r\nagainst illicit drugs has been small compared with the \r\nsacrifice made by the people of Colombia and the \r\nGovernment’s willingness to eradicate those drugs. The \r\nnumber of extradited citizens, the confiscation of illicit \r\nwealth and the areas sprayed represent enormous \r\nefforts, but the results are not proportional. For the \r\nsecond straight year, we have a programme for massive \r\nmanual eradication, which will mean 70,000 hectares \r\nof coca destroyed. \r\n Production and consumption require a global \r\ncommitment transcending formal declarations, so as to \r\nincreasingly apply programmes that reflect actions of \r\nshared responsibility. \r\n There are successful alternative development \r\nprojects. A few weeks ago, the United Nations \r\npositively assessed the forest keeper families \r\nprogramme, which covers 43,000 rural families that \r\nhave replaced drug cultivation with protection of the \r\nforest and the growing of alternative crops. Some, such \r\nas those in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, offer \r\necotourism services. According to the United Nations \r\nOffice on Drugs and Crime, drugs have been \r\neliminated in 80 per cent of the area of the forest \r\nkeeper families, covering 2 million hectares. More than \r\n136,000 hectares of tropical forest have been \r\nreclaimed. Thanks to payments by the Government, \r\nthese families have already acquired more than 30,000 \r\nhectares of productive land. Nevertheless, to protect a \r\nhigh percentage of the Colombian Amazon jungle and \r\ntropical forest, we need to reach 120,000 families. That \r\nis a great budgetary challenge, requiring more general \r\nand decisive international support. \r\n The programme halts the cutting down of tropical \r\nforest and the Amazon jungle, which have suffered the \r\ndestruction of nearly 2 million hectares because of \r\ndrugs. I ask the world: why is there not less rhetoric \r\nand a greater and more effective commitment, so that \r\nColombia, which is absolutely willing to achieve it, \r\nmay finally and definitively overcome the scourge of \r\nillegal drugs? \r\n We Colombians do not want to be left with efforts \r\nand sacrifices; we require results. We are willing to \r\nrevise our strategy and improve it, but we need the \r\nentire world to get involved with us. I ask the United \r\nNations for additional efforts to help us find ways to be \r\neffective. \r\n We reiterate our enthusiastic commitment to meet \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. Social cohesion, \r\novercoming poverty and building equity are essential \r\naspirations of our democracy. In 2002 poverty reached \r\nalmost 60 per cent of the population; in 2005 it was \r\ndown to 49 per cent. We will do everything possible to \r\nensure that it does not exceed 35 per cent by 2010 and \r\nto reach the goal of 15 per cent by 2019, the second \r\ncentenary of our independence. Fortunately, the Gini \r\ncoefficient is beginning to show a trend towards \r\ncorrection in income distribution. \r\n Our goals for the upcoming four-year period are \r\nambitious: achieving full coverage in health and basic \r\neducation and significant progress in basic sanitation \r\nand providing microcredit for 5 million poor families.  \r\n We want a modern democracy with security, \r\nfreedom, social cohesion, transparency and \r\nindependent institutions. This is our dream; this is what \r\nwe are fighting for. We want a nation without \r\nexclusions and without class hatred, with harmony, \r\nrectitude and prosperity; a nation in permanent \r\ndemocratic dialogue, with fraternity and without \r\ninsurmountable antagonisms; a nation integrated into \r\nmultilateralism, grateful for the efforts of the United \r\nNations, receptive to the international community’s \r\nsuggestions and willing to share its experiences and \r\nimprove its results. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Colombia for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Álvaro Uribe Vélez, President of the Republic \r\nof Colombia, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Émile Lahoud, President of the \r\nLebanese Republic \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the \r\nLebanese Republic. \r\n Mr. Émile Lahoud, President of the Lebanese \r\nRepublic, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\nA/61/PV.14  \r\n \r\n06-52988 8 \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Émile Lahoud, \r\nPresident of the Lebanese Republic, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly. \r\n President Lahoud: Today, I am honoured as I \r\ncongratulate you, Madam President, on your election \r\nas the first Arab woman to ever preside over this body, \r\nhoping that this heralds a new era of better \r\nunderstanding of women’s aspirations and Arab causes. \r\n I would also like to thank the Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Kofi Annan, for all that he has done for Lebanon \r\nand for the cause of peace in the region and the world \r\nas a whole. \r\n I stand before the Assembly representing a \r\nterribly scarred country, a country whose ordeal is well \r\nknown to members — my ravaged country, Lebanon. \r\nFrom 12 July through 14 August, my country was \r\nsubjected to a barbarous aggression and to a rarely seen \r\ncampaign of savage dismemberment, when hundreds of \r\nfighter jets emptied their loads of heavy and banned \r\nbombs, targeting mostly civilians, killing and maiming \r\nthousands, and destroying everything that made \r\nLebanon a viable State. Obviously, this was a \r\npremeditated Israeli “sentence” to destroy my country \r\nand everything it stood for, it having been blessed and \r\ntermed by His Holiness Pope John Paul II a “unique \r\nmessage to humanity,” that we can live together. This \r\naggression became even more cruel when it won the \r\ntacit approbation of certain great powers. \r\n Regrettably, the Security Council looked \r\npowerless in its attempts to stop the slaughter of \r\nLebanon’s children and protect the peace in Lebanon \r\nand the Middle East. It took over a month and \r\nnumerous calls for an immediate ceasefire for all those \r\nconcerned to finally force a mere cessation of \r\nhostilities, which is yet to become a formal and final \r\nceasefire. \r\n It becomes self-evident for us to question the \r\ncredibility of the United Nations in light of the \r\nSecretary-General’s acknowledgment that the delays in \r\nadopting Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) did \r\nindeed harm its credibility. Moreover, we cannot but \r\nhave serious doubts as to this Organization’s ability to \r\nsafeguard world peace when its resolutions are \r\nsubjected to the vagaries of a very few world powers. \r\n Today I ask: How many children, like the one in \r\nthe photograph that I am holding up, will die because \r\nnobody does anything for them? How many children \r\nwas this evil, vengeful machine of destruction \r\nsupposed to have killed, before the world community \r\ndecided to respond in defence of a “rightful” cause? \r\nAllow us to ask these questions, as we are filled with a \r\ndeep sense of grief, when scores of our fallen citizens \r\nare still beneath the rubble. \r\n Let me reassure the Assembly that this savagery \r\ndid not weaken our people’s resolve nor shake its \r\nresilience as it rallied around its army and Government \r\nand embraced its national resistance, whose men faced \r\noccupation forces with epic valour, preventing their \r\nadvance, and presenting Lebanon with yet another \r\nvictory, in the name of justice and dignity. \r\n While we stand under the United Nations \r\numbrella to warn the world of the dire consequences \r\nwe shall all face when the very foundations of this \r\nworld body are shaken, it is also time to ask Israel, \r\nwhich owes its very existence to a United Nations \r\nresolution, to finally abide by past and recent \r\nresolutions. \r\n As of 14 August this year, Lebanon has once \r\nagain, without a shadow of a doubt, reasserted the fact \r\nthat it is a nation that respects its commitments, while \r\nit implements international resolutions and proceeds to \r\ndeploy 15,000 Lebanese army soldiers on the border \r\nbetween Lebanon and Israel — while Israel continues \r\nits daily breaches of Security Council resolution 1701 \r\n(2006), having imposed a humiliating siege on \r\nLebanon, and refusing to withdraw from the Lebanese \r\nterritory in the Shaba’a farms sector, whose liberation \r\nremains Lebanon’s sacred right and duty. To this day, \r\nIsrael continues to treat the people of Lebanon as \r\nhostages, kidnapping at will scores of its citizens, in a \r\nflagrant breach of that resolution. \r\n Finally, Israel refuses to surrender to the United \r\nNations the maps showing thousands of mines it left \r\nbehind on Lebanese territory, while the case and fate of \r\nLebanon’s prisoners in Israel remains very ambiguous, \r\nand no clear resolution of their ordeal is addressed \r\nanywhere. \r\n Today, for the sake of peace, the world \r\ncommunity is called upon to save Security Council \r\nresolution 1701 (2006) from oblivion, a fate that \r\ncharacterized scores of previous resolutions. \r\n A/61/PV.14\r\n \r\n9 06-52988 \r\n \r\n Here, on behalf of a grateful country, I solemnly \r\nsalute the fallen soldiers of peace who will hence share \r\ntheir obituary with that of our brave army soldiers and \r\nof our valiant resistance fighters, victims of prohibited \r\nweaponry, first tested by Israel on our soil and subject \r\nto an international investigation. We are hopeful that \r\nthis time the world community will allow the \r\ninvestigation to reach its natural conclusion. This will \r\nconstitute a clear indictment of Israel for its recurring \r\nviolations of international conventions and the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. \r\n We also hope that the United States will not \r\nresort to its unfailing veto, thus allowing for the \r\nindictment of Israel’s actions in sympathy for the \r\nthousands of innocent civilians who were killed and \r\nmaimed by the “smart”, cluster and phosphorus bombs, \r\nand those laced with depleted uranium. \r\n Inspired by the principles and treaties of the \r\nUnited Nations, Lebanon retains the right of action to \r\nprosecute Israel before the competent bodies, most \r\nnotably this Assembly, or the International Criminal \r\nCourt, and to request the appropriate reparations for all \r\nthe catastrophes Israel has inflicted on Lebanon. \r\n I ask the Assembly today to stand by my country, \r\nas that will be recorded as a just and rightful stance. I \r\nalso call upon it to differentiate between he who \r\ndefends his country against Israeli aggression and \r\noccupation, and who strives to liberate his countrymen \r\nfrom decades of unlawful imprisonment, and those \r\nelements that perpetrate acts of wanton slaughter \r\nagainst their countrymen and others equally. I remind \r\nthe Assembly that Lebanon’s experience with the \r\nscourge of terror goes back a long way, and has taken a \r\nvery heavy toll on its armed forces. \r\n The most recent aggression against Lebanon has \r\nleft this small country terribly scarred, afflicted with \r\nthousands of dead and wounded, and a toll of \r\ndestruction including several thousand housing units \r\nand hundreds of bridges, ports, airports and factories. \r\nAnd my message is: the will of our people to live and \r\nmove forward has proved to be much stronger than \r\ndefeat and despair. In record time, the people of \r\nLebanon launched a campaign of reconstruction, made \r\neven more successful by instant comforting gestures of \r\ngoodwill from many friends, at home and abroad. With \r\nsuch overwhelming support and assistance Lebanon \r\nwill beat all the odds by achieving a stellar rebirth, \r\nthereby scoring another point in favour of humanity. \r\n There is ample talk today of the need to reach a \r\npermanent and comprehensive peace in the Middle \r\nEast, which Lebanon has stressed for decades. \r\nHowever, we are quick to point out that no such peace \r\ncan be achieved in the Middle East without addressing \r\nthe root cause of instability there, namely, the Arab-\r\nIsraeli dispute and its core issue, Palestine. \r\n Despite the horrid events in Lebanon, a window \r\nof opportunity has presented itself, and it should be \r\nfully exploited in order to reinvigorate the Middle East \r\npeace initiative, founded on the Arab peace initiative \r\nadopted during the Beirut Arab Summit of 2002. \r\n The Arab peace initiative remains the suitable \r\nmeans to achieve a permanent, comprehensive and just \r\npeace, because it simply calls for the implementation \r\nof all United Nations resolutions as they pertain to the \r\nwithdrawal of Israel from all occupied Arab lands, and \r\nfor the return of Palestinian refugees to their homes. \r\nOnly such a settlement will be capable of affording \r\nLebanon and the neighbouring countries the stability \r\nand security they long for and will give Israel a sense \r\nof security — something it has failed to obtain through \r\nsheer force and aggression. Moreover, this should put \r\nan end to the haemorrhage in the Palestinian territories \r\nand foster moderation where despair has bred \r\nextremism and violence, most notably in Iraq, where it \r\nis vital for all of us to help that tortured Arab nation \r\npreserve its territorial integrity and the unity of its \r\npeople. \r\n Today there is incessant talk of a new Middle \r\nEast as a harbinger of better things to come, and this \r\nprompts us to ask the following question. Is what we \r\nhave witnessed in Lebanon and continue to see in \r\nPalestine and Iraq conducive to an environment of \r\npeace and tranquillity? Is this much heralded new \r\nMiddle East attainable only through widespread strife, \r\nunimaginable bloodshed, sedition and oppression? \r\n Our conception of a new Middle East is one that \r\nis coherent with United Nations resolutions, and that is \r\nin concurrence with the principles of justice and right \r\nas stipulated in those resolutions. Our idea of a new \r\nMiddle East is one where a comprehensive peace \r\nsettlement becomes reality, guaranteeing the rights of \r\nall; where Palestinian refugees return home, as \r\nstipulated in resolution 194 (III), which comes long \r\nbefore Security Council resolution 1701 (2006), and \r\ntherefore are not resettled in host countries; and where \r\nprisoners return to their loved ones. \r\nA/61/PV.14  \r\n \r\n06-52988 10 \r\n \r\n This is the only way to attain a stable Middle \r\nEast. All else will plunge our region into further \r\nupheaval and bloodshed. \r\n Should our conception of peace in the Middle \r\nEast become reality, I assure the Assembly that the \r\nneed for conferences, studies and discussions of \r\nterrorism will become moot. Should this happen in \r\ntandem with serious attempts to combat poverty and \r\nsustain acceptable levels of development in areas of \r\nneed, this will certainly dry up the pools where \r\nterrorism draws its human and financial support. \r\n I have recently read one of your statements, \r\nMadam President, in which you emphasize that \r\noverhauling the United Nations will be one of your top \r\npriorities. I commend you for that position, because no \r\none appreciates the need for world peace more than the \r\npeople of the Middle East, as we recognize that the \r\npreservation of world peace requires a United Nations \r\ncapable of taking decisions and competent to see them \r\nthrough. \r\n Here, I would like to reiterate what I said from \r\nthis very rostrum only last year: \r\n “The core values of a democratic and just world \r\nare best served by enhancing the capabilities of \r\nthe United Nations and its instruments, and by \r\nreinforcing in-house democratic values.” \r\n(A/60/PV.13, p.1)  \r\nI believed that this institution should remain a \r\nsanctuary of world consciousness and “the primary \r\ndefender of such human values as freedom, justice and \r\npeace.” (ibid) \r\n Perhaps the reforms that have been carried out so \r\nfar, such as the establishment of a Human Rights \r\nCouncil and the Peacebuilding Commission, will \r\nconstitute the necessary incentives for achieving a \r\nUnited Nations capable of safeguarding right and \r\njustice. \r\n Taking into consideration current trends in world \r\naffairs, I propose to the General Assembly the creation \r\nof a commission leading to laying the foundations of a \r\ncharter of the rights of nations, a charter equal in \r\nimportance to the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights, a charter imposing on Member States — all \r\nStates — a code of conduct founded on the principles \r\nof justice and the rule of law. \r\n I come here from a country riddled with scars, \r\nrising from the rubble and ashes of aggression, to \r\nspeak of justice. I do not pretend to pontificate from \r\nthe helm of a tank. Lebanon remains a peace-loving \r\nnation, and it extends its hand to all those who share its \r\npeaceful vision, founded on a just settlement and \r\nextracting as such the seeds of oppression and \r\nviolence. We trust that the forces of good will prevail \r\nin the end, because its flames burn in the heart of the \r\nrighteous and because the sounds of jubilation will \r\nundoubtedly prevail over the beating of war drums and \r\nthe sibilating of hate and violence. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Lebanese Republic for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n Mr. Émile Lahoud, President of the Lebanese \r\nRepublic, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n Mr. Wali (Nigeria), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Armando Emílio Guebuza, President \r\nof the Republic of Mozambique \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nMozambique. \r\n Mr. Armando Emílio Guebuza, President of the \r\nRepublic of Mozambique, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Armando Emílio Guebuza, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Mozambique, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly. \r\n President Guebuza (spoke in Portuguese; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): On behalf of \r\nthe people and Government of the Republic of \r\nMozambique, and indeed on my own behalf, I would \r\nlike to place on record our congratulations to the \r\nPresident on her election to preside over the sixty-first \r\nsession of the General Assembly. We are delighted to \r\nsee a distinguished daughter of Bahrain in the \r\nstewardship of the highest organ of the United Nations. \r\n We reiterate our congratulations to her \r\npredecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, Minister for Foreign \r\n A/61/PV.14\r\n \r\n11 06-52988 \r\n \r\nAffairs of Sweden, for his leadership during the \r\nsixtieth session. We congratulate him once again on the \r\ncommendable work done during his tenure of office. \r\n We would also like to pay a glowing tribute to \r\nMr. Kofi Annan for his accomplishments during his \r\nmandate as Secretary-General. We commend the \r\ndevotion and tireless efforts of this son of Africa, our \r\ncontinent, for his work for the promotion of \r\ninternational peace, security and development, as well \r\nas for having created the solid foundations for wide-\r\nranging reforms of the United Nations. \r\n One of the issues on which our debate focused \r\nlast year related to development. We noted with \r\nconcern then that there was a substantive lack of \r\nprogress in forging partnerships. In this regard, we \r\nsalute the President for bringing the theme \r\n“Implementing a global partnership for development” \r\nfor debate at this session. \r\n We live in a very unbalanced world, in which \r\ndeveloping countries find themselves in a vicious cycle \r\nof dependency and vulnerability. This plight \r\nundermines our efforts to address, speedily and \r\nsuccessfully, the challenges that prevent our enjoying \r\nsounder economic and social growth and weaken our \r\ncapacity to deal, more effectively and with greater \r\nimpact, with the various manifestations of poverty and \r\nto fight, more vigorously, diseases such as malaria, \r\ntuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. Given our state of \r\ndevelopment, more often than not we are powerless to \r\nprevent or mitigate the impact of natural disasters and \r\nenvironmental degradation. Consequently, poverty \r\nprevents the part of our humanity located in developing \r\ncountries from enjoying the freedom of choice and \r\naction that the other part of mankind takes for granted. \r\n The merit of the theme that the President has put \r\nforward for our debate is that it gives us yet another \r\nopportunity to reflect on issues that we have dealt with \r\nin the past in seeking solutions for the remaining \r\nchallenges imposed by underdevelopment. It also lends \r\nitself to a debate of at least three important issues \r\nrelated to the problem of underdevelopment. \r\n The first is that no country alone, however \r\nresourceful it may be, can successfully overcome these \r\nchallenges on its own, at least not in the medium term, \r\nbecause these are challenges noted for their complexity \r\nand interrelationships with other global problems and \r\nphenomena.  \r\n The second point that can be inferred from this \r\ntheme is that, while underdevelopment can be \r\nattributed to or identified with a given country, its \r\nconsequences transcend national borders. They go \r\nbeyond geographical boundaries to, on the one hand, \r\naffect national security and demography in other \r\ncountries and, on the other, raise moral obligations of \r\nnew dimensions, as well as material challenges in other \r\nsocieties. \r\n The third issue relates to a static view of poverty. \r\nThe poor need to regain their self-confidence so that, \r\nlike people in other parts of the world, they too can rid \r\nthemselves of the shackles of poverty. By the same \r\ntoken, those who can assist also need to overcome the \r\ndeep-rooted view that the poor will not escape from \r\npoverty, as they are destined to remain poor. On the \r\nother hand, they also need to overcome the \r\npreconceived idea that development must be imposed \r\nfrom the outside. \r\n This discussion brings us back to our realization \r\nthat, given the global nature of the challenges facing us \r\ntoday, we have no choice but to weave together and \r\nstrengthen the national, regional and global \r\npartnerships. As a result of this realization, we adopted \r\nthe Monterrey Consensus, as well as the Johannesburg \r\nPlan of Implementation and the Millennium \r\nDeclaration. The expectation was that these \r\nconsensuses would translate, in concrete terms, into \r\nour commitment to forge global partnerships for \r\ndevelopment. Regrettably, little has been achieved so \r\nfar. Abject poverty remains a common feature of the \r\nmajority of developing countries. \r\n Therefore, I urge that we need to reiterate our \r\ncommitment to work together at various levels for the \r\nwell-being of humanity. Mankind is not a far-fetched \r\nconcept. For example, the very fact that the language I \r\nam using now can be translated into the other \r\nlanguages of the planet is a clear demonstration of how \r\nwe belong to the same humanity. Let us, therefore, \r\nredouble our efforts so as not to frustrate the \r\nexpectations of billions of citizens worldwide, in the \r\ndeveloped and the developing countries alike. All of \r\nthem are longing for a fairer, prosperous and peaceful \r\nworld. Through these partnerships we can also, more \r\neffectively, contribute to conflict resolution in Africa, \r\nin the Middle East and in the world at large. \r\n At this juncture, we would like to share with the \r\nAssembly our experience and views on the role and \r\nA/61/PV.14  \r\n \r\n06-52988 12 \r\n \r\nplace of partnerships to overcome the challenges \r\nbefore us today. \r\n At the national level, we are of the view that the \r\ndevelopment projects must be owned and driven by \r\ntheir primary and ultimate beneficiaries. In this regard, \r\nthe Government creates and promotes an environment \r\nthat facilitates the honing of self-esteem, promotes \r\nrecourse to individual creativity and supports \r\nincremental development. At the same time, the \r\nGovernment encourages and sustains partnerships with \r\nother collective development actors, such as civil \r\nsociety organizations, the private sector and \r\ninternational partners in cooperation. The products of \r\nthis approach to governance include, for example: the \r\nsecond Action Plan for the Reduction of Absolute \r\nPoverty for the period 2006-2009, drawn up with the \r\nactive participation of civil society organizations; \r\nannual meetings with the private sector; meetings of \r\nthe social partners, with the participation of the \r\nGovernment, trade unions and employers; the national \r\nforum for the African Peer Review Mechanism; and the \r\njoint review meetings between the Government and the \r\ndevelopment partners involved in direct budget \r\nsupport. \r\n These partnerships are held together by our \r\nadherence to open and inclusive governance. They are \r\nalso sustained by the collective commitment of various \r\nstakeholders engaged in the development of \r\nMozambique to reduce the incidence of absolute \r\npoverty from 54 per cent in 2003 to 45 per cent in \r\n2009. The environment of peace and stability in which \r\nwe live and which we promote also contributes to \r\nenhancing these partnerships. \r\n Regional cooperation plays an important role in \r\nbuilding and sustaining partnerships for development. \r\nThe Southern African Development Community \r\n(SADC) is a case in point. Since its birth, SADC has \r\nbeen playing a crucial role in promoting the political, \r\neconomic and social integration of countries and \r\npeoples of the region. At the same time, SADC allows \r\na given number of its member states to take initiatives \r\nthat further its ultimate objective of a more prosperous \r\nregion. In accordance with this principle, last August \r\nMozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe launched \r\nthe Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park, a project that \r\naims to transform an area of approximately 35,000 \r\nsquare kilometres, rich in biodiversity, into a \r\ndevelopment hub. \r\n Viewed as one of the building blocks of the \r\nAfrican Union, SADC plays an important role in \r\npromoting the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD), the African Union road map \r\ntowards prosperity. We take this opportunity to \r\ncommend the international community for aligning its \r\nassistance ever more closely with the NEPAD \r\npriorities. We would also encourage our development \r\npartners to increase their support for NEPAD. \r\n By deciding last week in Havana on the \r\ncontinuation of the Non-Aligned Movement’s \r\nrevitalization process, the Non-Aligned Summit put \r\ngreater emphasis on the role the Movement should play \r\nin forging partnerships among the countries of the \r\nSouth, as part of the global partnerships. Thus, the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement reinvigorated the Bandung \r\nspirit, which, as we all know, inspired the \r\nestablishment of the New Asian-African Strategic \r\nPartnership. \r\n In addition to the Monterrey Consensus, we \r\nadvocate an increase in international financial support, \r\nincluding official development assistance and foreign \r\ndirect investment for countries such as ours that have \r\npotential for agriculture, agro-industry and tourism. \r\n Similarly, we are in favour of the establishment \r\nof a fairer and more favourable global trading system \r\nthat is more conducive to sustainable development in \r\ndeveloping countries. In this context, we regret the lack \r\nof progress in the Doha Development Round, and we \r\nurge developed countries to be more flexible, within \r\nthe framework of the World Trade Organization, in \r\ntheir approach to the needs of developing countries. We \r\nreiterate this appeal because we are convinced that our \r\npartners do not want to witness the perpetuation of the \r\nmarginalization of developing countries from the \r\nglobal economy. \r\n The assessment made in 2005 indicates that a \r\nnumber of developing countries are making progress \r\ntowards the attainment of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. Mozambique is part of this positive trend. \r\nHowever, to ensure that it is irreversible, we call upon \r\nour development partners to continue to provide \r\nsubstantial and timely support for the priorities \r\nidentified by the recipient countries. We believe that \r\nour partners are also touched, in their souls and in their \r\nspirit, by the poverty that still afflicts that part of \r\nhumanity. \r\n A/61/PV.14\r\n \r\n13 06-52988 \r\n \r\n In conclusion, we join previous speakers in \r\nemphasizing the need for the United Nations reforms to \r\nmove forward. We all recognize the United Nations \r\npotential to forge effective partnerships for \r\ndevelopment. Therefore, we reaffirm the commitment \r\nof the Government of the Republic of Mozambique to \r\ncontribute to the success of this reform process, always \r\nbearing in mind the need to safeguard the \r\nintergovernmental nature of the United Nations. \r\n Mozambique is proud that its Prime Minister, \r\nMrs. Luísa Diogo, is one of the Co-Chairs of the High-\r\nlevel Panel on System-Wide Coherence in the areas of \r\ndevelopment, humanitarian assistance and the \r\nenvironment, established by the Secretary-General. It \r\nis our belief that the Panel’s report will contribute to \r\nthe success of the United Nations reforms. A reformed \r\nUnited Nations will be better placed to respond to the \r\ninternational challenges imposed by the need to \r\nstrengthen international law and multilateralism and to \r\npromote partnerships for development and peace \r\nworldwide. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Mozambique for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Armando Emílio Guebuza, President of the \r\nRepublic of Mozambique, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Branko Crvenkovski, President of \r\nThe Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of The Former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia. \r\n Mr. Branko Crvenkovski, President of The \r\nFormer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, was \r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Branko Crvenkovski, \r\nPresident of The Former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Crvenkovski: It is my privilege to \r\naddress this forum and share with it the views of the \r\nRepublic of Macedonia on the issues of primary \r\nimportance on this year’s agenda of the General \r\nAssembly and of the international community at large. \r\n Terrorism is not a new world issue, but it has \r\nunfortunately become our tragic daily reality, thus \r\nrapidly gaining new and more devastating dimensions \r\nin the increasingly globalized world. We are all \r\naffected in one way or another — whether we speak \r\nabout actual terrorist attacks or threats. \r\n The real question, however, is: can we or should \r\nwe, the nations of the world, continue to live in that \r\nkind of atmosphere, to live in fear, threatened? It \r\nwould be a failure of humanity, of free spirit and \r\ndemocracy, of prosperity and mankind, and finally, if I \r\nmay say so, a failure of all of us here at the United \r\nNations. Recently we adopted the United Nations \r\nGlobal Counter-Terrorism Strategy. I believe it was \r\nhigh time that we adopted a unified position and \r\nstrategy, that all of us gave a strong international \r\nresponse. Comprehensive international cooperation and \r\ncoordination against this evil is equally important to \r\nactivities at the national and regional level. We need to \r\nhave results; the sooner, the better. \r\n Outside this building, when the United Nations is \r\nmentioned, for many peoples, even nations, it means \r\nhope and help; it means peace; and it means cure. It \r\nmeans also freedom, democracy and safety — it means \r\nlife. So the United Nations should not be shy to \r\nrespond, to act and to resolve when it is asked. The \r\nUnited Nations has to react. Only by resolving \r\nproblems do we make progress. We have to follow and \r\nreact to the changes and to the new challenges that are \r\nincoming. \r\n The overall reform of the United Nations, \r\nincluding better management, must be an ongoing \r\neffort. There are still issues from the World Summit \r\nFinal Document yet to be delivered, such as mandate \r\nreview and Security Council reform, to name only \r\nsome. Hopefully, there will be enough understanding \r\nand progress achieved on them too. \r\n Last month we had yet another reminder of how \r\nfragile world peace actually is. The Middle East again \r\nerupted. We have witnessed how difficult it is to \r\nrestore peace, to hold a ceasefire and to send United \r\nNations peacekeepers there. Macedonia welcomed the \r\nunanimous adoption of Security Council resolution \r\n1701 (2006) of 11 August. Macedonia supports the \r\nefforts of the United Nations and the international \r\ncommunity to provide timely humanitarian assistance \r\nto those affected and for the reconstruction of Lebanon. \r\nA/61/PV.14  \r\n \r\n06-52988 14 \r\n \r\nThe United Nations must fight to make a lasting \r\npeaceful solution for the Middle East. \r\n From the very beginning the Republic of \r\nMacedonia has been part of the international \r\nantiterrorist coalitions in Iraq and Afghanistan, and it \r\nhas recently increased its contingents as part of the \r\ninternational forces. Peace- and democracy-building in \r\nthose two countries remains one of the key challenges \r\nfor the international community and the Iraqis and \r\nAfghans themselves. I again reiterate Macedonia’s \r\nsupport for their efforts to rebuild those countries and \r\ncreate a better life for their people. \r\n Last year at the Summit we reaffirmed our \r\ncommitment to the global partnership for development, \r\nas set out in the Millennium Declaration, the \r\nMonterrey Consensus and the Johannesburg Plan of \r\nImplementation. It is beyond doubt that every country \r\nhas a principal responsibility for its own development. \r\nHowever, it is more than obvious that national \r\ndevelopment efforts must be supported by global \r\nactions. The contribution of the private sector and civil \r\nsociety may play a critical role in our common \r\nendeavour. \r\n In addition to human rights standard setting, the \r\nUnited Nations, since the adoption of the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, has been a guardian of \r\nhuman rights. We trust that the recently established \r\nHuman Rights Council will give a new impetus in this \r\narea. We hope that the Commission’s weaknesses will \r\nbe overcome, but we have to be aware that this requires \r\na strong political commitment on the part of the \r\nmembership. Guided by the wish to contribute to the \r\nwork of this important body, we have announced our \r\ncandidacy for membership for the 2009-2012 period. \r\n Today Macedonia is a stable and functional \r\nmulti-ethnic democracy. Over recent years we have \r\nlaunched and carried out a large number of reform \r\nprojects, which have brought us closer to the European \r\nUnion and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \r\n(NATO) alliance. In December last year Macedonia \r\nwas granted candidate status for European Union \r\nmembership. Macedonia rightfully expects that the \r\npace of the needed reforms the country is committed to \r\nwill lead to an opening of the negotiations on joining \r\nthe European Union. As for NATO, we expect the \r\ninvitation to join it at the next enlargement summit. \r\n The region of south-eastern Europe to which my \r\ncountry belongs has experienced significant changes in \r\nthe recent past and made considerable democratic \r\nprogress: the start of European Union accession \r\nnegotiations of Croatia and Turkey; Macedonia \r\nbecoming a candidate country for membership in the \r\nEuropean Union; the signing of the Stabilization and \r\nAssociation Agreement with Albania; and the opening \r\nof the negotiations for the same agreement with Serbia, \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro, the newly \r\nindependent State. Furthermore, Romania and Bulgaria \r\nare expected to become full European Union members \r\nin a few months. \r\n Good-neighbourly relations and regional \r\ncooperation have been and are among the top priorities \r\nof Macedonia’s foreign policy. We will continue to \r\npursue such a policy even more vigorously. There is no \r\nalternative to dialogue, and all outstanding regional \r\nissues should be resolved in that manner. This year the \r\nMacedonian delegation will once again introduce in the \r\nFirst Committee a resolution entitled “Maintenance of \r\ninternational security — good-neighbourliness, \r\nstability and development in South-Eastern Europe,” \r\nwhich is traditionally widely supported and co-\r\nsponsored by Member States. \r\n I should like to say a few words about the Kosovo \r\nissue and Kosovo’s future status. Macedonia fully \r\nsupports the work of the Secretary-General’s Special \r\nEnvoy, Martti Ahtisaari, and his team on the Kosovo \r\nstatus talks. I stress that every effort should be made to \r\nachieve a negotiated settlement mutually acceptable to \r\nthe parties concerned, in line with Security Council \r\nresolution 1244 (1999) and the Contact Group guiding \r\nprinciples. The Republic of Macedonia, with its active \r\ngood-neighbourly policy, has been a factor that has \r\nlargely contributed, and continues to contribute, to the \r\nfinal, overall stabilization and positive developments in \r\nthe region. \r\n Yet there is one important, still pending, issue in \r\nthis context for the Republic of Macedonia: that of the \r\ntechnical demarcation of our northern border on the \r\nKosovo section, in line with the agreement between the \r\nRepublic of Macedonia and the Federal Republic of \r\nYugoslavia, signed in February 2001, and the \r\nrecommendations made by the then Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s Special Envoy, Kai Eide. We urge that this \r\nissue be closed in that manner before the final Kosovo \r\nstatus decision is reached. \r\n A/61/PV.14\r\n \r\n15 06-52988 \r\n \r\n I am confident that our deliberations will \r\ncontribute to creating a better world for all. Although \r\nthe debates at times show how different we are, our \r\ndifferences must not be an obstacle to our common \r\nvision. The personification of the hope of mankind for \r\na better tomorrow remains with the United Nations. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I thank the President of The Former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia for the statement he \r\nhas just made. \r\n Mr. Branko Crvenkovski, President of The \r\nFormer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, was \r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Pierre Nkurunziza, President of the \r\nRepublic of Burundi \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nBurundi. \r\n Mr. Pierre Nkurunziza, President of the Republic \r\nof Burundi, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Pierre Nkurunziza, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Burundi, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly. \r\n President Nkurunziza (spoke in French): It is a \r\ngreat honour and pleasure to speak here on behalf of \r\nmy delegation and to take part in this important \r\ngathering, where all the Member States of our \r\nOrganization will consider today’s most pressing \r\nissues. \r\n I wish to express to the President, on behalf of \r\nmy delegation and in my own name, our warmest \r\ncongratulations on her election. We also congratulate \r\nMr. Jan Eliasson on the effective way in which he led \r\nthe work of the previous session. \r\n We also take this opportunity to express once \r\nagain my country’s support for, and appreciation of, the \r\nexcellent work of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi \r\nAnnan, who has led our Organization with courage, \r\nlucidity and determination during his term of office. \r\n Burundi is taking part in the sixty-first session of \r\nthe General Assembly a year after the setting up of \r\ndemocratic institutions. It was a historic event in \r\nBurundi for us to have democratically elected \r\ninstitutions, which have just reached the end of their \r\nfirst year in office, the first time this has happened \r\nsince we gained independence. \r\n This is a good time for us to report to the \r\nAssembly on the political, social and economic \r\nsituation in our country and the efforts that have been \r\nmade to meet the many challenges that the people of \r\nBurundi face. It is also an opportunity for us to address \r\nsome of the issues of current concern at the regional \r\nand global levels. \r\n In the post-conflict situation that my country is \r\ngoing through, the first concern was to re-establish \r\npeace and security throughout the country. Carrying \r\nout this task was made possible thanks to the \r\ndeployment in Burundi of a United Nations force and \r\nthe training of a new national defence force, in \r\naccordance with the Arusha Peace and Reconciliation \r\nAgreement for Burundi and the Comprehensive \r\nCeasefire Agreement of Pretoria. So far, this \r\nintegration has proceeded uneventfully, and we thank \r\nGod for this. \r\n The signing of a comprehensive ceasefire on \r\n7 September 2006 by the Government and the last rebel \r\nmovement, the Palipehutu-FNL movement, encourages \r\nus to accelerate the programme for disarming civilians \r\nin order to establish peace and security throughout the \r\ncountry. Over the last three months the people have \r\nbegun to voluntarily hand in to the authorities weapons \r\nthey acquired during Burundi’s crisis. So far about \r\n5,000 weapons have been handed over. The agreement \r\nrepresents a very important stage in the life of our \r\ncountry, which is now going through its reconstruction \r\nphase.  \r\n The enjoyment of political liberties has become a \r\nreality in Burundi, whether in terms of political parties, \r\ncivil society or the media. With regard to the media, a \r\nlaw has just been passed to create more diverse and \r\nmore professional press institutions. \r\n We have also just passed an anti-corruption law. \r\nMeasures to implement it include an anti-corruption \r\ncourt and a force to deal with corruption. We are \r\nconvinced that they will allow us to work with more \r\ntransparency in the management of public resources \r\nand in our fight against corruption. State income is \r\nincreasing by nearly 20 per cent each month; we are \r\nalready enjoying the benefits of this policy. \r\nA/61/PV.14  \r\n \r\n06-52988 16 \r\n \r\n With regard to promoting the rule of law and the \r\nrights of the individual, we are making progress \r\nthrough the reforms taking place in the justice sector \r\nand with regard to human rights, national solidarity and \r\ngender equality. The Burundi Government’s \r\nprogramme has placed promoting the rights of women \r\nand gender equality amongst its priorities. We urge the \r\nUnited Nations to give particular attention to this issue \r\nduring its reform process. The Government also \r\nappeals for, and supports, a specific structure to ensure \r\nthat women emerge from poverty and thus have \r\ngenuine equality. \r\n Still with regard to the rule of law, in addition to \r\nthe 5,000 or more political prisoners already freed, on \r\nthe occasion of the celebration of the forty-fourth \r\nanniversary of national independence on 1 July this \r\nyear, we decided to release undocumented detainees \r\nbeing held under irregular circumstances. Similarly, the \r\nGovernment has started to improve conditions for \r\nprisoners who have been properly sentenced. However, \r\nwe are aware that much more needs to be done in this \r\narea, with the support of the international community. \r\n Establishing the rule of law and peacebuilding \r\nalso depend on the peaceful settlement of the issue of \r\nland ownership. This was behind the Government’s \r\ncreation of the national commission dealing with land \r\nand other assets, whose task it is to settle disputes over \r\nthe ownership or recovery of land and other assets that \r\nhave changed hands during the various social and \r\npolitical conflicts in our history. Its work is an essential \r\ncomplement to that of the truth and reconciliation \r\ncommission, with regard to which the Government of \r\nBurundi hopes agreement will soon be reached with the \r\nUnited Nations, because we are convinced that it will \r\ncontribute to combating the fallout from genocide, as \r\nwell as impunity in our country, and enhance the \r\nnational reconciliation process. \r\n With regard to national reconciliation, we firmly \r\nbelieve that sport is a very important factor in \r\npeacebuilding and reconstruction and in achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. In Burundi we have \r\ntaken measures in this area, and we hope that other \r\ncountries going through a post-conflict period will \r\nfollow our example. \r\n The Government of Burundi continues to have to \r\ndeal with a significant number of vulnerable people. \r\nWe have today nearly 400,000 refugees, 120,000 \r\ninternally displaced persons and thousands of others \r\nwho need to be cared for, including persons with \r\ndisabilities, orphans, widows, widowers and old people \r\nunsettled by the war. Our Government needs help to \r\ndeal with this situation. Since the recent ceasefire \r\nagreement, refugees have started to return to Burundi \r\nen masse. \r\n The Government of Burundi has also sought to \r\nimprove the country’s socio-economic situation. Aware \r\nof the general impoverishment of our people due to a \r\ndecade of war, we prepared an emergency programme \r\nfor the current year, and submitted it to donors for \r\nfunding on 28 February. The programme covers in \r\nparticular free primary education for all children of \r\nschool age, counteracting hunger, access to health care, \r\njob creation, rehabilitation of the communication \r\ninfrastructure, improving prison conditions and \r\nimproving the management of public finances. \r\n In order to ensure the proper management of \r\nfunds provided by donors within the framework of \r\ncooperation with Burundi, the Government has \r\nestablished a national committee to coordinate aid. \r\nWith the same desire for efficiency, we have created a \r\nnational committee to monitor and manage Heavily \r\nIndebted Poor Countries funds, budgetary support and \r\ndebt. \r\n The Government’s efforts to alleviate poverty \r\ninclude measures such as reducing the price of most \r\nessential commodities, the abolition of some taxes, free \r\nhealth care for children under the age of five and for \r\nmothers who give birth in state clinics, and the fight \r\nagainst AIDS. A new status for civil servants and a 15 \r\nper cent increase in their salary from 1 July this year \r\nare intended to give them more motivation and halt the \r\ndecline in their standard of living. \r\n However, our country’s reconstruction, efforts to \r\ncounteract poverty and the relaunching of Burundi’s \r\neconomy require more than an emergency programme. \r\nThe preparation of a strategic framework for growth \r\nand counteracting poverty, covering a period of three \r\nyears, meets this concern. We plan to organize next \r\nNovember a donors’ round table on the basis of this \r\nstrategic framework. We rely on the active \r\nparticipation of Burundi’s partners, both long-standing \r\npartners and new ones, in order to help Burundi \r\nrespond positively to the many priority expectations of \r\nour people, who are impatient to enjoy the dividends of \r\npeace at last. \r\n A/61/PV.14\r\n \r\n17 06-52988 \r\n \r\n At the same time, we are pursuing or launching \r\nother measures aimed at creating a favourable \r\neconomic environment that is conducive to prosperity. \r\nThey include liberalizing the coffee sector, simplifying \r\ncustoms procedures, liberalizing the circulation of \r\ncurrency through private financial institutions, \r\nconstructing new communication routes and improving \r\nthe road network. Furthermore, the investment code \r\nhas been revised in order to encourage investment in \r\nBurundi. \r\n The Government’s adoption of the five-year plan \r\nfor 2006-2010 and the launching of a study for the \r\nperiod to 2025 are part of this medium- and long-term \r\nstrategy for our socio-economic and political \r\ndevelopment. We have thus sought to establish for our \r\nsociety a plan based on a minimum number of common \r\nobjectives and a shared vision of the future of Burundi \r\nand its people. \r\n We welcome the decision by the American \r\nAdministration to put Burundi on the list of countries \r\nthat benefit from the facilities offered in the framework \r\nof the African Growth and Opportunity Act. We have \r\ninvited businessmen to organize themselves in order to \r\ntake advantage of this new opportunity for our \r\neconomy. \r\n Burundi attaches great importance to regional \r\nintegration initiatives. We take this opportunity to \r\nwelcome the electoral process taking place in the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, which is now in its \r\nfinal stages. We hope that it will be successful and that \r\nit will result in the democratic establishment of \r\nlegitimate institutions. Similarly, we welcome the \r\nsigning of a ceasefire between the Government of \r\nUganda and the LRA, which we sincerely hope will \r\nquickly lead to lasting peace. \r\n We continue to be concerned over the continuing \r\narmed conflict in the Horn of Africa, Darfur and the \r\nMiddle East, as well as by the deadlock in the peace \r\nprocess in Côte d’Ivoire. As Members of the United \r\nNations, we must work tirelessly to end these sad \r\nsituations. \r\n Terrorism is a further harsh reality that the world \r\nstill confronts. Far from being discouraged, we must \r\nstep up our vigilance and consider new initiatives to \r\ncounteract this scourge and evil, and to deal with its \r\nunderlying causes. \r\n Globalization is one of the major challenges of \r\nthe twenty-first century, but we also see it as an \r\nopportunity for developing countries to benefit from \r\nthe considerable progress and advantages that it offers, \r\nprovided it is combined with openness and autonomy. \r\n For our part, we will spare no effort to make our \r\ncontribution to building peace and prosperity. The \r\nelection of Burundi to the Peacebuilding Commission \r\nis a source of pride and additional motivation to work \r\nto strengthen peace in our country and throughout the \r\nworld. Unfortunately, changes in anti-democratic \r\nthinking and behaviour do not take place automatically \r\nin countries emerging from crisis, such as Burundi. \r\nHowever, we welcome the successes already achieved \r\nand our increased capacity to control the situation. \r\n Our Organization is going through a critical \r\nperiod. Although the United Nations was set up “to \r\nsave succeeding generations from the scourge of war”, \r\ncertain conflict situations have been haunting it for \r\nmany years. It must therefore be made into an \r\ninstrument at the service of all, able to inspire hope, \r\ndispel concerns and restore respect for order and \r\ninternational law. This mission must be fulfilled in full \r\ncooperation with regional organizations, whose \r\neffectiveness in conflict prevention and rapid \r\nintervention has already been proved, despite \r\ninsufficient resources. \r\n The General Assembly’s agenda must reflect the \r\nmain concerns of the day. These include, in particular, \r\nnuclear disarmament, which continues to poison \r\ninternational relations. Other concerns are combating \r\nthe illegal trade in small arms, poverty and epidemics \r\nthat kill on a large scale, such as AIDS and malaria. We \r\ncommend the international drug purchasing facility \r\n(UNITAID) initiative, which gives hope to those \r\nsuffering from AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. It \r\nproves that a partnership between the North and the \r\nSouth can change the lives of millions of people \r\nthroughout the world. \r\n The new millennium was warmly welcomed. \r\nWorld leaders place great hopes in this new time, as \r\nshown by the Millennium Development Goals adopted \r\nin 2000, which were reaffirmed in the declaration of \r\nthe summit of heads of State and Government in \r\nSeptember 2005. Those Goals represent a platform that \r\nis particularly important for developing countries, \r\nlandlocked countries and small island developing \r\nStates in their efforts to combat hunger and poverty \r\nA/61/PV.14  \r\n \r\n06-52988 18 \r\n \r\nand to promote health and education, to mention just a \r\nfew subjects. \r\n Other commitments were made in Paris and at the \r\nG-8 summit in Gleneagles, particularly for improved \r\naid coordination and further aid and debt relief. \r\n Before closing, I would like to express our deep \r\ngratitude to Mr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General, \r\nand to all the members of the Security Council, the \r\nEuropean Union and the African Union, as well as to \r\nall the members of the Regional Initiative that have \r\nsupported our peacemaking and peacebuilding efforts, \r\nwhich have resulted in the achievements already seen. \r\nWe think in particular of certain countries of the \r\nregion, such as Uganda, Tanzania and South Africa, \r\nwhich were tireless godfathers in facilitating our peace \r\nprocess. To all those partners, we again say a big \r\n“Thank you” for the remarkable success that my \r\ncountry has just witnessed with the signing of the \r\nceasefire with the Palipehutu-FNL. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Burundi for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Pierre Nkurunziza, President of the Republic \r\nof Burundi, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Marc Ravalomanana, President of \r\nthe Republic of Madagascar \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nMadagascar. \r\n Mr. Marc Ravalomanana, President of the \r\nRepublic of Madagascar, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Marc Ravalomanana, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Madagascar, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly. \r\n President Ravalomanana (spoke in French): I \r\nwould like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Kofi Annan, for everything that he has done; he \r\nhas been a great Secretary-General. Thanks to his clear \r\nvision, his commitment and his open-mindedness, he \r\nhas greatly contributed to the development of the \r\nUnited Nations and the promotion of Africa. I thank \r\nhim and his team. \r\n Last year we discussed the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. It was clear that they could not be \r\nattained in the sub-Saharan countries if we did not \r\nmake a considerable effort. The initiatives of the G-8, \r\nthe World Bank, the European Union and other donors \r\nseemed to constitute a good foundation for a profound \r\nchange. Have we noticed a profound change? I do not \r\nthink so. The sad reality is that Africa receives less \r\ninternational assistance per capita than it did 20 years \r\nago. \r\n Let us be honest. The great ideas and the \r\ngoodwill expressed in words rarely pass through the \r\nfilters of existing structures and programmes. The files \r\non Afghanistan, Iraq and Lebanon, the Palestine \r\nquestion and the oil question have put the Africa file in \r\nthe shade. It is a fact: Africa is not a priority for \r\ninternational authorities. \r\n However, I remind the Assembly that we all set \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. These are \r\ncommon goals; therefore, their realization is also a \r\ncommon task. I remind the Assembly, too, that when \r\nwe deal with issues we are also writing the destiny of \r\nhundreds of millions of human beings. Our decisions \r\naffect millions of children. Where is the fervent desire, \r\nthen, to deliver on what we have promised to do for \r\nthem? That is the paradox between what we preach and \r\nwhat we do. \r\n I remind the Assembly that the task of this \r\ncommunity is to avoid crises instead of dealing with \r\ncrises. This institution should be a place not for \r\nfirefighters, but for strategists.  \r\n I emphasize that the idea of one world, the \r\nfoundation of globalization, cannot take us towards a \r\nfair and peaceful future as long as many poor countries \r\nare still marginalized. We want the same ticket to enter \r\nthe international community as the European Union has \r\ngiven to Eastern European countries. We should all be \r\non the same boat. However, many developing countries \r\nare still struggling behind it, swimming hard to try to \r\ncatch up with it. How can we get out of this calamitous \r\nsituation? \r\n The Millennium Development Goals must remain \r\nthe basis of our discussions and our actions, even if \r\ntheir achievement becomes more and more difficult. \r\nThe industrialized countries have asked us, the \r\n A/61/PV.14\r\n \r\n19 06-52988 \r\n \r\ndeveloping countries, to develop visions for our \r\ncountries and to prepare road maps in order to achieve \r\nthem. They have asked us to specify the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals for our countries. They have asked \r\nus to increase our absorption capacity. \r\n All of that is fair and understandable. However, \r\nthe role of industrialized countries is not to play the \r\nreferee, assess players and give out red cards. All \r\ncountries, developed and developing alike, must play \r\ntogether. We must act together and have the same goal. \r\n That is why I have decided to develop a new \r\nstrategy in Madagascar, which we call the Madagascar \r\nAction Plan. The plan has been discussed throughout \r\nthe regions of Madagascar with representatives of \r\nprivate and public organizations to create a sound basis \r\nfor achieving our vision, “Madagascar — Naturally!”, \r\nand the Millennium Development Goals. \r\n The plan has also been discussed with members \r\nof the donor community. I told them that it is based on \r\nour vision and on the Millennium Development Goals, \r\nwhich we all set together. We should not be satisfied \r\nwith existing means; we should mobilize all the means \r\nneeded to achieve those goals. \r\n I also told the donors that the Madagascar Action \r\nPlan is our common plan. We decide together how \r\nmany men and women we want to — and can — pull \r\nout of poverty; how many poor children can have a \r\nbetter education; and how many children we can save \r\nby providing them with safe drinking water and \r\nvaccines. \r\n Together we have to answer these questions, \r\nbecause they concern global tasks, common tasks. \r\nHunger, poverty and disasters are among those issues \r\nthat know no borders. Therefore, they are part of our \r\nshared responsibility.  \r\n We must change the approach used in the past, \r\nwhich was based on division. We must accept that the \r\ntasks are too burdensome to be carried out by weak \r\npeople, to whom a new burden is given. I am talking \r\nabout goals and measures that we must deal with \r\ntogether, according to the capacity of each of us. \r\n International assistance for African development \r\nmust undoubtedly be doubled or tripled in the short \r\nterm. Donors must deliver on their promises in the \r\nshort term if we really want to revive the economies of \r\nAfrican countries. \r\n People ask why sub-Saharan Africa has not \r\nexperienced economic growth in the last few years. \r\nThere are many reasons. They include internal \r\nconflicts, lack of good governance, instability and \r\ninsecurity. However, the reduction of aid per capita \r\nduring the last 20 years is one of the main reasons for \r\nthe slowing of economic growth. \r\n A further reduction of international aid has been \r\nproposed, so that developing countries will become — \r\nso it is said — much more independent quickly. That is \r\na fundamental misunderstanding. To become \r\nindependent, we need more international aid. Greater \r\nsupport is the shortest path towards independence. The \r\nmore we invest in education, infrastructure and health, \r\nthe more economic growth will be strengthened. And \r\nthe more economic growth is strengthened, the quicker \r\nwill the independence of developing countries become \r\neffective. \r\n Investments in education, health, infrastructure \r\nand so on continue to be conditions for foreign direct \r\ninvestment. Private investment cannot replace them.  \r\n We should look at the results of the Marshall Plan \r\nand at the huge investments by the European Union in \r\nthe new member States. They have been a huge \r\nsuccess. \r\n The question of absorption capacity has been \r\ndiscussed. Like all developing countries, we too have \r\nhad problems, problems of cooperation between \r\nnational and international partners. Basically, if there is \r\na lack of capacity, it is the result of lack of cooperation \r\nand confidence.  \r\n Capacity must never be the factor that determines \r\nthe volume of support. Where there is a lack of \r\ncapacity in an area, it is necessary to strengthen that \r\narea. If there are not yet enough human resources \r\navailable at the national level, it is necessary to call on \r\ninternational experts, while reinforcing national \r\ncapacities. \r\n In this context, I would like to add a few words \r\non “country ownership”. It is true that we in the \r\ndeveloping countries know our problems very well. \r\nTherefore, we are ready to assume our responsibilities. \r\nDeciding on policies and actions must be the \r\nresponsibility of nationals. The programmes of the \r\ndonors have to be integrated into national programmes. \r\n But it is also true that we are not always aware of \r\nour weaknesses and are not in phase with all the \r\nA/61/PV.14  \r\n \r\n06-52988 20 \r\n \r\nvalues, rules, standards and procedures that are \r\nacknowledged in most industrialized countries. Often \r\nour fellow citizens do not appreciate the true worth of \r\ngood governance. \r\n Transferring the rules of good governance and \r\nstandards of quality in education, health and \r\ninfrastructure into our culture and our policies is \r\nessential. The transfer of knowledge is as urgent as is \r\nthe transfer of capital. It is not only technical \r\nknowledge that we lack; the transfer of knowledge \r\nmust also include values and the concept of \r\nprofessionalism. \r\n Let us pool our capacities. What is at stake is so \r\nimportant that we must use all our capacities at the \r\nsame time. Effectiveness must be the rule. Good \r\ncooperation between national and international experts \r\nis the basis of success. \r\n And let us be more realistic, more pragmatic. The \r\npercentage of international aid spent on studies is far \r\ntoo high. Most studies are not implemented and simply \r\nrepeat what previous studies have already found out. \r\n I also recommend more effective \r\ndecentralization, so that financial aid reaches the grass-\r\nroots communities. The financing mechanism is often \r\nslow and sometimes complex. It resembles a tortuous, \r\nstony path — and it is porous.  \r\n From time to time, we ask the same questions: \r\nHow can we better structure international assistance? \r\nWhich transfer of funds, for which area and with which \r\nmeasures is the most important? There is no simple \r\nanswer. Each country, each region and each area \r\nrequires a different answer. Theoretical discussions \r\nwill not help.  \r\n However, there is a foundation that is crucial to \r\nall development: confidence. If a people do not feel \r\nconfident, they will not contribute to development. If \r\ninternational firms do not feel confident, they will not \r\ncome. \r\n Confidence comes from opening up to the outside \r\nworld, from stability, security and transparency. Good \r\ngovernance and democracy are also crucial. I assure \r\nthe Assembly that Madagascar, my Government and I, \r\nwill hold free and fair presidential elections in \r\nDecember. \r\n During last year’s session of the Assembly there \r\nwas general agreement about the urgent need to \r\nincrease international aid quantitatively and \r\nqualitatively in order to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. We should therefore act \r\naccordingly.  \r\n North America, Europe and most countries in \r\nAsia and South America have experienced an era of \r\nprosperity and progress. Their peoples now have a \r\ngood chance of enjoying a good standard of living until \r\nthe age of 80. \r\n The peoples of Africa do not have that chance. I \r\ntherefore call upon the United Nations to develop and \r\nadopt a new, more dynamic and determined approach \r\nin favour of Africa. If that is done, opportunities will \r\nbe more balanced and the world will be a fairer place. \r\n We note that the industrialized countries can react \r\nquickly and launch large-scale operations if their vital \r\ninterests are at stake. We desire now the same dynamic \r\napproach for Africa, because the basic needs of our \r\npeople are still being ignored. Such an approach is in \r\nthe interest of the African peoples, but it is also in the \r\nbest interest of humanity. A prosperous Africa is an \r\nasset for the world. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Madagascar for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Marc Ravalomanana, President of the \r\nRepublic of Madagascar, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\n \r\n  Address by The Right Honourable Stephen \r\nHarper, Prime Minister of Canada \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of Canada. \r\n The Right Honourable Stephen Harper, Prime \r\nMinister of Canada, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency the Right Honourable \r\nStephen Harper, Prime Minister of Canada, and \r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Harper (Canada) (spoke in French): It is a \r\ngreat honour for me, as Prime Minister of Canada, to \r\n A/61/PV.14\r\n \r\n21 06-52988 \r\n \r\nspeak to the Assembly today about the important issues \r\nconfronting us as Members of the United Nations. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n The United Nations was born from a combination \r\nof the essential needs of nations for stability and \r\nsecurity and the higher ideals to which we should all \r\naspire — freedom, democracy, human rights and the \r\nrule of law. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n Our responsibilities in this Organization are as \r\nvaried as they are important, and I cannot mention \r\nthem all, nor do each the justice they deserve. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n Nor can Canada be effective by diffusing our \r\nefforts across all of these matters. We must focus our \r\nconsiderable, but limited, resources where we can \r\nmake a real difference. So let me turn to one particular \r\nand key area where global interests and higher purpose \r\ncome directly together: the United Nations Assistance \r\nMission in Afghanistan. \r\n The United Nations recognized shortly after the \r\nattacks of 11 September 2001 that the Taliban regime, \r\nby its promotion of terrorism, was a threat to \r\ninternational peace and security. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n Kofi Annan, our Secretary-General, whom we \r\nthank for his 10 years of loyal service, summed up in a \r\nfew words the reason why we must combat terrorism. \r\nTerrorism, he said: \r\n “is a direct attack on the core values the United \r\nNations stands for: the rule of law; the protection \r\nof civilians; mutual respect between people of \r\ndifferent faiths and cultures; and peaceful \r\nresolution of conflicts.” \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n That is why we in the United Nations have the \r\nresponsibility to defeat terrorism. That is why, with \r\nunity and determination, the United Nations undertook \r\nits responsibility and its role in Afghanistan. And that \r\nis why Canada, which lost 24 of its own citizens on \r\n9/11, answered the call. \r\n And there we are. The United Nations Assistance \r\nMission in Afghanistan is the United Nations single \r\nlargest political mission. It is also, by far, Canada’s \r\nbiggest and most important overseas mission. So the \r\nUnited Nations mission is Canada’s mission. \r\n No fewer than 19 United Nations agencies are in \r\nAfghanistan. They are working tirelessly to help the \r\nAfghan people and their national Government shake \r\noff the perpetrators of terrorism and build a democratic \r\nand secure society. \r\n At the same time, approximately 20,000 troops \r\nfrom 37 countries — roughly 2,500 Canadians \r\nincluded — are contributing to military efforts to help \r\nstabilize Afghanistan and eliminate the remnants of the \r\nTaliban regime. And we want to do that once and for \r\nall. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n All our actions in Afghanistan — civilian and \r\nmilitary — are being taken in accordance with the \r\nmandate of the Security Council. In short, we all stand \r\ntogether with the democratically elected Government \r\nof Afghanistan under the banner of the Organization \r\nthat represents our collective will. In Afghanistan the \r\nUnited Nations mission is Canada’s mission. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n Let us be realistic. The challenges facing \r\nAfghanistan are enormous. There will be no quick \r\nfixes. Moreover, success cannot be assured by military \r\nmeans alone. This we all recognize. For success also \r\nrequires a strong and unwavering civilian contribution: \r\neducators, engineers, elections advisers, direct and \r\ntechnical aid. The list is lengthy, but the contributions \r\nare essential. \r\n That is why Canada is engaged in work like the \r\nrebuilding of girls’ schools, ripped down and destroyed \r\nby the Taliban in their frenzy of hate. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n That is why last spring we increased our \r\ndevelopment assistance, raising Canada’s total \r\ncontribution to nearly $1 billion over 10 years, to assist \r\nthe people of Afghanistan. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n These two actions — rebuilding a shattered \r\nsociety and providing a stable security environment — \r\ngo hand in glove. And we are making progress — of \r\nthat there is no doubt: 5 million refugees repatriated; \r\nover 5 million children enrolled in primary schools;  \r\nA/61/PV.14  \r\n \r\n06-52988 22 \r\n \r\n10 million Afghans registered to vote in successive \r\ndemocratic elections. \r\n More than one quarter of the seats in \r\nAfghanistan’s legislature are now held by women — \r\nremarkable in a nation where a few short years ago \r\ngirls could not attend school and women had no human \r\nrights of any kind. \r\n The success of this Mission, in providing both \r\nsecurity and development, is vital to the safety, \r\nlivelihood and very future of the Afghan people, but it \r\nis also vital to the health and future of this \r\nOrganization. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n Let us recall that the democratically elected \r\nGovernment of Afghanistan, led by President Karzai, \r\nrequested the assistance of the United Nations and its \r\nMember States in the struggle against terror, \r\nintimidation, violence and oppression. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n We have responded. But we have not made \r\nAfghanistan’s progress irreversible — not yet. \r\nCanadian defence personnel, diplomats and \r\ndevelopment officers are on the front lines of the fight \r\nfor the future of Afghanistan. Canadians feel \r\ntremendous pride in the leadership role they have \r\nassumed, and we share equal grief for the casualties \r\nthey have taken. We are therefore acutely aware that \r\nthe United Nations job in Afghanistan is not yet done. \r\nWe have no illusions about the difficulties that still lie \r\nbefore us. Difficulties do not daunt us. But lack of \r\ncommon purpose and will in this body would. \r\n After all, if we fail the Afghan people, we will be \r\nfailing ourselves. For this is the United Nations \r\nstrongest Mission and therefore our greatest test. Our \r\ncollective will and credibility are being judged. We \r\ncannot afford to fail. We will succeed. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n The United Nations is also facing other \r\nchallenges — in Haiti, for example. Canada has played \r\nan important role there, dispatching troops, police and \r\ndevelopment officers to support United Nations \r\nactivities aimed at restoring stability and establishing \r\ndemocracy. And we are offering the country  \r\n$100 million in economic development assistance. \r\nHowever, we must act together to ensure that our \r\nmultinational force paves the way for stability and \r\nprogress, and empowers the Government of Haiti to \r\nhelp its citizens, the poorest in the western hemisphere. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n Darfur, too, is a significant challenge, as \r\nmultinational security efforts are transferred from the \r\nAfrican Union to the United Nations. It is also a test of \r\nthe principle that this body endorsed last year — the \r\nresponsibility to protect. The United Nations has \r\nauthorized a mission there, with a robust mandate. But \r\nwill the Government of Sudan accept it? \r\n In the Middle East, Canada has joined the \r\ninternational community in the reconstruction of \r\nLebanon. But will the United Nations Interim Force in \r\nLebanon ensure security on Israel’s northern border \r\nand lead to progress in the Middle East peace process? \r\n Nuclear proliferation threatens us all. Are we \r\nprepared to ensure that Security Council decisions will \r\nbe implemented fully? Will we act to halt activities that \r\nhave no reasonable purpose other than the acquisition \r\nof nuclear weapons? \r\n These are some of the tests the whole world must \r\nface. And there are other challenges internal to this \r\nOrganization. \r\n Will the new Human Rights Council become a \r\nforum where human rights are genuinely put above \r\npolitical maneuvering? Or will it emulate the fate of its \r\nfailed predecessor organization? I must say that the \r\nearly signals suggest that too little has changed and \r\nthat the page has not yet been turned. \r\n And what will be done to make progress on \r\nUnited Nations management reform? \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n Earlier this year Canada’s new Government was \r\ngiven a mandate to make our national Government \r\nmore accountable and more responsible, to ensure that \r\ntaxpayers get full value for their money and to pursue a \r\nclear, focused agenda that produces tangible results. \r\nThe United Nations should accept nothing less. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n This Organization must become more \r\naccountable and more effective. Management reform \r\nmust continue, and at an accelerated pace. The \r\ntaxpayers of Member nations, Canadians among them, \r\nmake significant financial contributions to this \r\nOrganization. They have the right to expect stronger, \r\n A/61/PV.14\r\n \r\n23 06-52988 \r\n \r\nmore independent oversight mechanisms, more robust \r\naccountability for how funds are spent, and human \r\nresources practices that are based on merit. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n I have just described the tests by which this \r\nOrganization will be judged. Canada wants this to be a \r\npositive judgment. We were there when the United \r\nNations was founded. Like the other countries, we \r\nwere motivated by a pressing need to establish a new \r\ninternational consensus in a world devastated by war. \r\nAnd, like the others, we were motivated by our own \r\npragmatic interests and noble aspirations for all of \r\nhumanity. More than 60 years later the formula \r\nremains the same. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n The challenge has always been the same: to bring \r\nnations together to build a better world by forging \r\nconsensus on common purposes and by finding the \r\npolitical will to translate these into action. \r\n When these goals have been achieved, Canada \r\nhas always been with the Organization — through the \r\nwar against fascism, the cold war, dozens of United \r\nNations-sponsored peacekeeping missions, and more \r\nrecent multinational military engagements in the \r\nBalkans and the Persian Gulf. \r\n Today Afghanistan leads the list of challenges \r\nthat we face collectively — peacebuilding in a nation \r\nwhere there is not yet peace, where progress requires a \r\nwide range of capabilities undertaken by a wide array \r\nof our Member States. \r\n My earnest hope is that we will say with pride to \r\nfuture generations of leaders: We, the United Nations, \r\ntook up that responsibility in Afghanistan, rose to the \r\nchallenge and met it firmly, collectively, successfully. \r\nIn this endeavour, as with the others I have outlined, \r\nCanada will be there with the Organization at every \r\nstep along the way. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of \r\nCanada for the statement he has just made. \r\n The Right Honourable Stephen Harper, Prime \r\nMinister of Canada, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. José Sócrates, Prime Minister \r\nof the Portuguese Republic \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the \r\nPortuguese Republic. \r\n Mr. José Sócrates, Prime Minister of the \r\nPortuguese Republic, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum. \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. José Sócrates, Prime \r\nMinister of the Portuguese Republic, and inviting him \r\nto address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Sócrates (Portugal) (spoke in Portuguese; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): I would like \r\nto begin, like previous speakers, by extending my \r\nwarmest congratulations to Ms. Haya Rasheed Al-\r\nKhalifa, the first woman in nearly 40 years to take up \r\nthe position of President of the General Assembly. This \r\nis good news for international politics. I wish her every \r\nsuccess in discharging the mandate on which she is \r\nnow beginning, in which she can be assured of \r\nPortugal’s firm support. We are confident that she will \r\ncontinue the excellent work carried out by her \r\npredecessor, Minister Jan Eliasson, whom I am very \r\nhappy to remember here. \r\n This session of the Assembly is also notable for \r\nbeing the last during which Secretary-General Kofi \r\nAnnan will be in office. I therefore solemnly express \r\non behalf of the Portuguese people our heartfelt, deep \r\nappreciation for the way in which he has carried out his \r\nduties over the last 10 years, contributing concretely \r\nand decisively to international peace and stability in a \r\nworld that we all wish were more just. It was on his \r\nwatch — and with his indispensable personal help — \r\nthat we saw the birth of the new State of Timor-Leste. \r\nPortugal will not forget that this was one of the great \r\nrecent victories of the United Nations, in peoples’ fight \r\nfor self-determination, and in defence of the values in \r\nthe Charter. \r\n This Organization has carried out a crucial task in \r\nTimor-Leste, in maintaining peace, consolidating the \r\nrule of law and, together with donor countries, creating \r\nthe foundations for a more prosperous economic and \r\nsocial future for the Timorese people. \r\n There is still a long way to go, it is true. But it is \r\nimportant that the Timorese people be aware that they \r\ncan count on the United Nations. Unfortunately, the \r\nA/61/PV.14  \r\n \r\n06-52988 24 \r\n \r\nrecent internal crisis raised a serious question about \r\nsecurity, and it is vital that this be resolved if the \r\ncountry is to find stability. \r\n We therefore applaud the new United Nations \r\npeace mission, the United Nations Integrated Mission \r\nin Timor-Leste, which represents a continuity of the \r\nsignificant investment made by the international \r\ncommunity, to which Portugal belongs. We participate \r\nactively in this Mission, consistent with our ongoing \r\ncommitment, going back over three decades, to the \r\npolitical process of the new State of Timor-Leste. \r\n In this regard, I would also like to pay due tribute \r\nto the memory of Sergio Vieira de Mello, brutally \r\nmurdered three years ago in Baghdad in the service of \r\nthe United Nations. We will not forget all that he did \r\nfor the just cause of the Timorese people, and in \r\ndefence of the values that the United Nations \r\nembodies. \r\n This last decade has been one of great changes. \r\nThe United Nations has had undoubted successes, but \r\nthere have also been missed opportunities. Many \r\naccuse the Organization of undue complexity, slowness \r\nin its decision-making process and excessive \r\nbureaucracy. It is true that diplomacy requires time, but \r\nit does produce results. If there is something that we \r\nhave learned over these last years, it is that there is no \r\nalternative to multilateralism; multilateralism is where \r\nthe United Nations plays a determinant role. \r\n The United Nations is today one of the greatest \r\nguarantors of our collective security. It is our duty to \r\npreserve and strengthen it. It is an investment from \r\nwhich we all stand to benefit. Each one of us is a \r\nMember of this Organization not only to serve and \r\npromote our own national interests, but also — and I \r\nwould go so far as to say above all — to fulfil the \r\nhopes and dreams of the people of the whole world. \r\n The world today, as we know, is full of risks and \r\nthreats that no country can face alone. If we do not \r\nunite in our efforts, we are halfway down the road to \r\nfailure. Reality, particularly in recent years, has proved \r\nthis to us quite clearly. \r\n I would therefore like to underline Portugal’s \r\ncommitment to multilateralism, because we firmly \r\nbelieve that this is the path where one can best uphold \r\nthe essential values of peace and development. \r\n A big part of this multilateral action rests on a \r\ndialogue between cultures and civilizations. It is \r\nthrough this dialogue that we assume a collective \r\nresponsibility to overcome obstacles, prejudices, \r\npreconceived ideas and, principally, ignorance. Our \r\nchallenge here in this dialogue is not to limit ourselves \r\nto mere declarations, but to take firm and concrete \r\nsteps towards greater interaction between peoples and \r\ncultures. \r\n Despite the huge uncertainties and \r\nmisunderstandings in the world today, we have a set of \r\nprinciples — contained in our Charter — that can \r\ninspire us and guide us. They are our best help. \r\n The dialogue between cultures and civilizations \r\nalso imposes demanding domestic political agendas, in \r\nthe respect for differences and the inclusion of all \r\ncitizens in society — the inclusion of immigrants; the \r\ninclusion of all, irrespective of their beliefs or \r\nreligions. \r\n On the other hand, the dialogue between \r\ncivilizations also imposes steps forward on the \r\ninternational scene, the strengthening of economic \r\nbonds between North and South. The strengthening of \r\nworld trade mechanisms constitutes an investment in \r\nour own security, and is an essential part of that \r\ndialogue; hence the importance of overcoming the \r\nobstacles of the Doha Round in the context of the \r\ncurrent negotiations in the World Trade Organization. \r\nWe all have to be prepared to give up something so that \r\nat the end of the day everyone can win. \r\n One of the biggest political challenges that we \r\nface in this dialogue of cultures and civilizations is \r\nundoubtedly the Middle East. The region remains one \r\nof the main focal points of instability in the world. We \r\nall have in our minds the painful images of the most \r\nrecent crisis in Lebanon, where we witnessed the \r\nsuffering of civilians on both sides of the conflict. This \r\nreinforces all the more the need to actively pursue a \r\npermanent and balanced solution, which may bring \r\nabout a dynamic of hope and peace in the region. \r\n The Middle East is not a military issue. The \r\nMiddle East is, above all, one of the greatest political \r\nand diplomatic challenges that today’s world faces. We \r\nshould not, therefore, miss the window of opportunity \r\noffered to us by Security Council resolution 1701 \r\n(2006). It is a challenge where the United Nations and \r\nthe European Union assume shared responsibilities in \r\npromoting peace and stability, through an effective \r\nmultilateral dialogue. \r\n A/61/PV.14\r\n \r\n25 06-52988 \r\n \r\n Portugal fulfils its duty and supports the urgent \r\nimplementation of this resolution, and we are present \r\nin the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon to help \r\nimplement it. \r\n I would like to draw attention, once more, to \r\nAfrica. Portugal has given it great attention, and \r\ninvested great efforts there, and it is our duty to ensure \r\nthat the continent is not forgotten. There is progress in \r\nAfrica that we should encourage, and we also have a \r\nhistorical responsibility on which the developed world \r\nshould not and cannot turn its back. \r\n I am pleased to stress here today the \r\ndetermination with which the European Union has been \r\nreinforcing its partnership and its strategy with the \r\nAfrican continent. The current drafting of a Euro-\r\nAfrican joint strategy will lead to a script for our \r\nrelations with Africa in the fundamental areas of peace \r\nand security, good governance and human rights, \r\nregional trade and integration, and also aspects relating \r\nto human development. \r\n I stress the word “joint”. All of us share the \r\nresponsibility — Africans and Europeans alike. I trust \r\nthat the conditions will soon be right for this strategy \r\nto be adopted. And I hope that it will be at the highest \r\nlevel, when we hold in Lisbon the second European \r\nUnion-Africa summit. \r\n In recent years, with the consolidation of the \r\nAfrican Union and various regional organizations and \r\ninitiatives, very significant progress has been made in \r\nmany fields on the African continent, and this has been \r\ndriven by the continent itself and its own institutions. It \r\nis our duty to recognize these developments, support \r\nthem with renewed support and vigour, and develop \r\nthem further. \r\n I would also like to recall that last July, in Bissau, \r\nthe Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries \r\ncelebrated its tenth anniversary. This organization has \r\nbeen consolidating itself and strengthening its \r\ninvolvement within the United Nations system, where \r\nit currently holds observer status, presenting itself as a \r\ncredible organization in the fostering of international \r\npartnerships. \r\n In Bissau, on the tenth anniversary, we pledged \r\nour commitment to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, by defining and implementing a \r\ngeneral cooperation strategy where the highest priority \r\nis given to achieving these Goals. This is our priority \r\nin our domestic policy in Portugal; at the top of our \r\npriorities are the Millennium Development Goals. We \r\nshall implement them with a bilateral and multilateral \r\ncooperation strategy that will help to fight poverty, \r\nalleviate the pressure on migratory flows and promote \r\nsustainable development. \r\n September in New York, above all else, should \r\nnot be some sort of annual pilgrimage to rediscover \r\nthis Organization. At the end of the day, the credibility \r\nof the United Nations is in our hands. \r\n We all face the same challenges. But, at the same \r\ntime, they give us the opportunity to live in accordance \r\nwith our ideals and put into practice the principles that \r\nhave guided us for more than six decades. The only \r\nway out is for us to look for answers together. That is \r\nwhy we need a stronger and more cohesive United \r\nNations. We owe this to ourselves. We owe it to our \r\nchildren. But, above all, we owe it to future \r\ngenerations. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nPortuguese Republic for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n Mr. José Sócrates, Prime Minister of the \r\nPortuguese Republic, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by The Honourable Ralph E. \r\nGonsalves, Prime Minister, Minister for \r\nFinance, Planning, Economic Development, \r\nLabour, Information, Grenadines and Legal \r\nAffairs of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister, Minister for \r\nFinance, Planning, Economic Development, Labour, \r\nInformation, Grenadines and Legal Affairs of Saint \r\nVincent and the Grenadines. \r\n The Honourable Ralph E. Gonsalves, Prime \r\nMinister, Minister for Finance, Planning, \r\nEconomic Development, Labour, Information, \r\nGrenadines and Legal Affairs of Saint Vincent \r\nand the Grenadines, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency the Honourable Ralph E. \r\nGonsalves, Prime Minister, Minister for Finance, \r\nPlanning, Economic Development, Labour, \r\nInformation, Grenadines and Legal Affairs of Saint \r\nA/61/PV.14  \r\n \r\n06-52988 26 \r\n \r\nVincent and the Grenadines, and inviting him to \r\naddress the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Gonsalves (Saint Vincent and the \r\nGrenadines): Our President arises in this Assembly as a \r\nbreath of fresh air and presides as an inspiration to \r\nwomen, particularly in the Middle East, and to human \r\nbeings all over the world who treasure the stone that \r\nthe builder rejects and that becomes the head \r\ncornerstone. I am sure that her presidency will make a \r\npositive and lasting impact on our General Assembly. I \r\nthank her very much for being and doing. \r\n Humanity’s condition today is difficult, complex \r\nand challenging, yet pregnant with possibilities for a \r\nbetter future. Everywhere the faces of men and women \r\nare strained and anxious; yet, amidst the anxieties, pain \r\nand sorrows there is joyous laughter, which soothes the \r\nsoul and summons the human race to embrace the \r\npromise of a redeeming grace, which eschews hate, \r\ngreed, callousness, oppression, injustice and violence. \r\nIt is still possible for this divided world of inequity and \r\nthe inhumanity of man to man to sing with meaning \r\nour redemption song of peace and justice, prosperity \r\nand freedom, democracy and tolerance, unity amidst \r\ndiversity, equality and mutual respect. \r\n This quest to mend the broken world is grounded \r\nin the ideals that constitute the core of the United \r\nNations. This idealism seeks not a world of perfection, \r\nbut one of goodness, one of civilization over \r\nbarbarism, of humanity over inhumanity. The world, \r\nespecially the majority of its inhabitants who happen to \r\nbe poor and disadvantaged amidst an orgy of plenty \r\nthat resides in a minority, looks to the United Nations \r\nas their hope, as a brightness that illuminates, not \r\nblinds. I bring this simple but powerful message from a \r\nsmall, developing country in the nearby Caribbean Sea \r\non behalf of the marginalized of the world, without the \r\nvanity of a pretentious hegemony, an arrogance of \r\npower, or a triumphalism of a presumed manifest \r\ndestiny. It is both necessary and desirable to speak this \r\ntruth to power. \r\n So more than 80 per cent of the people who \r\nreside in the developing world, and, indeed, all right-\r\nthinking persons, want and demand in this regard \r\ncoherent leadership from a reformed United Nations \r\nthat is true to its central mandate to serve humanity \r\nwell. Unfortunately, the reformation of the United \r\nNations is moving at a snail’s pace, which frustrates its \r\nwork, undermines its efficacy, and damages its \r\ncredibility. \r\n To be sure, some modest progress has been made \r\nby way of the establishment of a new Human Rights \r\nCouncil and the Peacebuilding Commission. But, \r\nfrankly, too much time is wasted on fussing and \r\nfighting on esoteric issues touching and concerning the \r\nso-called mandate review and management reform, \r\nrather than focusing on the critical matter of the \r\nimplementation of the “development resolution” \r\nadopted by the General Assembly. In the process, too, \r\nlet us have a reform of the Security Council that is \r\nmeaningful and democratic. \r\n The world’s marginalized and disadvantaged look \r\naskance at a United Nations that daily seeks to \r\nchoreograph the dancing of angels on the head of a pin. \r\nThey care very little for the bureaucratic harangue that \r\nthe United Nations “system-wide coherence” has been \r\naddressed and enhanced, important as that may be for \r\nsome professional diplomats. The world’s people want \r\nto know, and to see the practical evidence, that the \r\nUnited Nations is tackling in a purposeful way the \r\nissues of global poverty, environmental degradation, \r\nclimate change, the empowerment of women, the \r\nprotection of children, the promotion of peace and \r\nsecurity, the HIV/AIDS pandemic, the provision of \r\nclean water and an adequate supply of food, among \r\nother such telling requisites. \r\n Undoubtedly, many, if not most, of the \r\nGovernments of the rich and powerful countries show \r\nsigns of fatigue and disengagement towards the \r\ndeveloping world. This is evident in their parsimony on \r\nofficial development assistance and their failure and/or \r\nneglect to advance meaningfully the Doha \r\nDevelopment Round. Better must be done here. \r\n Please note that my strictures are levelled at the \r\nGovernments of those countries, and not their people \r\nor their civilizations. Sufficient persuasive evidence \r\nexists that the people in many, if not most, of these rich \r\ncountries are sensitive to the concerns of the \r\ndeveloping world, but their Governments do not \r\nsufficiently reflect these sensitivities, despite their \r\noccasional rhetoric to the contrary. Accordingly, the \r\npeoples and civilizations across national boundaries \r\nmust link themselves in a tighter nexus or bond, with \r\nor without the mediating formal state apparatuses, and \r\nname and shame those Governments that ought to be \r\nnamed and shamed. \r\n A/61/PV.14\r\n \r\n27 06-52988 \r\n \r\n In this regard, the proposal before the United \r\nNations for an alliance of civilizations holds immense \r\npromise, provided that it is not captured by those states \r\nthat hanker after an ignoble, unattainable, \r\nunsustainable and fundamentally immoral hegemony. \r\nOur Caribbean civilization, and its Vincentian \r\ncomponent, stands ready and willing to be part of this \r\nmagnificent quest for an ennobling brotherhood and \r\nsisterhood of humanity. \r\n While many rich countries turn aside from the \r\ndevelopment thrust of the world’s marginalized and \r\ndisadvantaged, there is an encouraging trend towards \r\nmore and better South-South cooperation. In the case \r\nof Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, we are benefiting \r\nfrom a closer integration network through the \r\nOrganisation of Eastern Caribbean States and the \r\nCaribbean Community Single Market and Economy. \r\nFurther, countries such as Cuba, Venezuela, Mexico, \r\nMalaysia and Taiwan, among others, have special and \r\nmodel relations with our country. \r\n Recently, at the Summit of the Heads of State and \r\nGovernment of the Non-Aligned Movement, held in \r\nCuba, the leaders of this 118-member body redefined \r\nits purpose and mandate, in an increasingly unipolar \r\nworld, to embrace a thorough-going development \r\nagenda and to facilitate the building of a more \r\npeaceful, just and secure architecture of international \r\nrelations. This renewed enthusiasm of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement strengthens the hands and voices of those \r\nwho truly believe that a better, more civilized world is \r\npossible and nigh. \r\n Next year, in March, people of African descent \r\nand all freedom-loving peoples and nations will \r\ncommemorate and celebrate the two-hundredth \r\nanniversary of the passage of the act abolishing the \r\nBritish trade in African slaves to the Caribbean and the \r\nAmericas. This is an occasion for historical \r\nreclamation and the righting of historic wrongs. The \r\ntrade in, and enslavement of, Africans was a monstrous \r\ncrime against humanity and an exercise in genocide \r\nunmatched in the history of the Western world. \r\n European nations and their North American \r\ncousins have failed and/or refused to acknowledge this \r\nsufficiently or at all. There has been no apology for this \r\ncrime against humanity and this genocide, conducted \r\nover a prolonged period. There has been no practical \r\nrecompense in the form of reparations to the affected \r\nnations and peoples in Africa, the Caribbean and the \r\nAmericas. Surely, this issue must be put squarely on \r\nthe agenda of the United Nations for speedy resolution. \r\n Without in any way diluting the force of this \r\nrepresentation — indeed in bolstering it — we find it \r\nnecessary and desirable to link it in our Caribbean \r\nregion with the genocide of indigenous peoples, \r\nincluding the Callinago and the Garifuna of Saint \r\nVincent and the Grenadines, and the wholly wrong and \r\ninhumane exploitation by colonialism and imperialism \r\nof indentured labour from Africa, Madeira, India and \r\nChina after the abolition of African slavery in the \r\nCaribbean. Europe has much to answer for on these \r\nmatters, and should be made to answer properly and \r\nappropriately. Historic wrongs not righted remain scars \r\non the soul of the oppressor and the oppressed alike, \r\nwhich continue to haunt over the ages; it is a hateful \r\nburden that must be lifted. This dark night must give \r\nway to a brightened day. \r\n Of all the tragedies engulfing our modern world, \r\nfew touch the human soul and spirit as does the \r\ncondition of the people in Darfur and Palestine. The \r\nentire world knows who are responsible for the crimes \r\nagainst humanity in Darfur and in all areas of the \r\nPalestinian homeland. Yet the basic human and \r\nnational rights of the people in those geographic \r\nregions are trampled upon daily by alien forces. \r\nMeanwhile, the United Nations appears helpless and its \r\nauthority is undermined. Surely, the time is long past \r\nfor a resolution of these conflicts, and other enduring \r\nconflicts worldwide, including Lebanon and Western \r\nSahara. Oppression will not endure indefinitely. That is \r\nthe powerful lesson of history. The people’s right to \r\nself-determination must be fully respected. \r\n Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is pleased to \r\nsee Haiti’s restoration to democracy. The cynical ouster \r\nof the former democratically elected President, Jean-\r\nBertrand Aristide, in February 2004, ushered in \r\nimmense suffering in Haiti under a so-called interim \r\nadministration installed by imperialism. The Haitian \r\npeople, who endureth for ever, must be applauded for \r\ntheir commitment to democracy and progress. Their \r\nelection of President René Préval represents a strong \r\nrebuke of those who mistakenly believe that the \r\ndangling of money is everything. We heartily \r\ncongratulate the new Haitian Government and pledge \r\nto work closely with it in its efforts to develop its \r\nheroic country, the land of Toussaint L’Ouverture. \r\nA/61/PV.14  \r\n \r\n06-52988 28 \r\n \r\n Saint Vincent and the Grenadines again pleads \r\nwith the United Nations to permit Taiwan, a democratic \r\nand progressive country of 23 million people and a \r\nlegitimate political expression of the Chinese \r\ncivilization, to be accorded its rightful admission to the \r\nUnited Nations and its specialized agencies. There is \r\nno adequate justification for the continued exclusion of \r\nTaiwan from participation in the numerous global \r\nexchanges in the several international bodies, including \r\nthe United Nations. \r\n Further, the United Nations has a major role to \r\nplay in ensuring an easing of tensions across the \r\nTaiwan straits. Aggressive conduct must be restrained \r\nin a context in which Taiwan is committed to peace and \r\na comprehensive political dialogue. \r\n Modern terrorism is a barbarism out of sync with \r\ncivilized life. It affects adversely not only powerful \r\nnations, but developing ones in Asia, Africa, Latin \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean. The evil of terrorism, \r\nincluding state-sponsored terrorism, must be fought \r\nrelentlessly. It must be given no space to thrive. At the \r\nsame time, terrorism must be attacked sensibly and not \r\nin a counter-productive way. Too many innocent lives \r\nhave been lost through terrorist acts. Saint Vincent and \r\nthe Grenadines pledges itself to continue to work \r\nresolutely and fearlessly, without hypocrisy, with all \r\nnations and the United Nations, to eliminate the \r\ndastardly scourge called terrorism and its causes. \r\n Permit me to thank Secretary-General Kofi \r\nAnnan for his splendid work at the United Nations and \r\nthroughout the world. His accomplishments have been \r\nimmense, and we applaud him as his incumbency \r\ndraws to a close. We wish him and his family well. \r\n I conclude by reaffirming that it is our sacred \r\nduty to humanity and those unborn to ensure that we \r\ncontribute to a safer, more peaceful, more prosperous, \r\nmore civilized world. We who have come from \r\nyesterday with our limiting burdens must face \r\ntomorrow with our enabling strengths. We must never \r\nforget that in our work here at the United Nations it \r\nbecomes possible to glimpse morning before the sun, \r\npossible to see early where sunset might stain \r\nanticipated night. Let us thus not sleep to dream, but \r\ndream to change the world, for the better. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister, Minister \r\nfor Finance, Planning, Economic Development, \r\nLabour, Information, Grenadines and Legal Affairs of \r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines, for the statement he \r\nhas just made. \r\n The Honourable Ralph E. Gonsalves, Prime \r\nMinister, Minister for Finance, Planning, \r\nEconomic Development, Labour, Information, \r\nGrenadines and Legal Affairs of Saint Vincent \r\nand the Grenadines, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Sidi Mohamed Ould Boubacar, \r\nPrime Minister of the Islamic Republic of \r\nMauritania \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Mauritania. \r\n Mr. Sidi Mohamed Ould Boubacar, Prime \r\nMinister of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, \r\nwas escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Sidi Mohamed Ould \r\nBoubacar, Prime Minister of the Islamic Republic of \r\nMauritania, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Mr. Ould Boubacar (Mauritania) (spoke in \r\nArabic): Allow me first to warmly congratulate the \r\nPresident on her election. We firmly believe that her \r\nexperience will guarantee an excellent grasp of all the \r\nissues and that she will carry out her task with wisdom \r\nand skill. \r\n I take this opportunity to pay tribute to her \r\npredecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, for his admirable and \r\ntireless efforts in the reform process of the United \r\nNations and moving it forward. \r\n I also thank and congratulate Mr. Kofi Annan, the \r\nSecretary-General, and his team for their untiring \r\ncontribution to improving the work methods of the \r\nOrganization in order to achieve its objectives in all \r\nareas. \r\n I also take the opportunity to welcome the \r\nRepublic of Montenegro as a new Member of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n We particularly pay tribute to the important \r\nresolutions dealing with the creation of the Human \r\nRights Council and the Peacebuilding Commission. \r\nWithout a doubt, those two new bodies will contribute \r\nto improving the Organization’s activities to find \r\n A/61/PV.14\r\n \r\n29 06-52988 \r\n \r\nsolutions to two of the main concerns of the peoples \r\nand Member Governments of the United Nations, \r\nnamely, conflicts and wars, and the impact that they \r\nhave on the rights and dignity of individuals and \r\ncommunities. We are all aware of the direct impact of \r\nthose issues on peace, security, development, justice \r\nand democracy throughout the world.  \r\n We wish to stress the resolutions and the \r\nimportant work of the United Nations between the two \r\nsessions, namely conferences and summits dealing with \r\nthe information society and the HIV/AIDS pandemic, \r\nas well as meetings on development, alleviating \r\npoverty, protecting the environment, promoting the \r\nadvancement of women, and dealing with \r\nunemployment and the issues of migration. \r\n How we meet the need for development, security \r\nand peace throughout the world will depend on how we \r\ndeal with the issues of violence and terrorism. Since \r\nthe phenomenon of terrorism is universal in nature, the \r\nsolution to it must also be found through a global \r\nvision that is anchored in understanding and dialogue \r\nbetween civilizations and nations, a vision that rejects \r\nconfrontation and conflict and seeks to overcome \r\npoverty, illiteracy and social, scientific and technical \r\nunderdevelopment. \r\n In Mauritania we reject terrorism in all its forms \r\nand manifestations. We remain faithful to our Islamic \r\nvalues of solidarity, understanding and tolerance, \r\nwhich reject violence and extremism. \r\n My country, Mauritania, reiterates its support for \r\npeace and for relaunching the negotiation process on \r\nall tracks. That is the only way to put an end to the \r\nconflict in the Middle East, on the basis of \r\ninternational resolutions, the Arab Peace Initiative and \r\nthe Road Map, which will guarantee the Israeli \r\nwithdrawal from all occupied Arab territories in \r\nPalestine, Syria and Lebanon and allow the Palestinian \r\npeople to restore its legitimate rights and establish an \r\nindependent State with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital. \r\n With regard to Western Sahara, Mauritania \r\nsupports the measures taken by the United Nations and \r\nits Secretary-General to find a lasting solution that \r\nguarantees stability in that region and enjoys the \r\nsupport of all stakeholders. \r\n Concerning Iraq, we are following very closely \r\nthe changing political, security and humanitarian \r\nsituation in that fraternal country. We note with \r\nsatisfaction the success achieved by the Iraqi \r\nGovernment in rebuilding State institutions. We \r\nreaffirm our support for the unity of Iraq, its territorial \r\nintegrity and independence and for non-interference in \r\nits internal affairs. \r\n After the changes of 3 August 2005, the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Mauritania ushered in a new era in its \r\npolitical history. The new era started with the creation \r\nof a pluralist, democratic system based on the \r\nguarantee of equality and justice for all. It enshrines \r\nthe peaceful assumption of authority and transparency \r\nin management and administrative reform, while firmly \r\nestablishing the mechanisms of good governance. \r\n These choices have been implemented on the \r\nbasis of a sound experiment carried out throughout the \r\ncountry using all the active forces of our people, \r\nincluding civil institutions, political parties, trade \r\nunions and the transition Government, through a \r\nprogramme of action for justice and democracy that \r\nhas been implemented with the informed and effective \r\nparticipation of all stakeholders. It includes \r\nconstitutional reform, reform of the administration of \r\njustice, administrative reform to combat corruption, \r\nand reform of the electoral system by creating an \r\nindependent national electoral commission on the basis \r\nof transparency and by encouraging the participation of \r\nwomen. \r\n In order to ensure total neutrality in the elections, \r\nthe Military Council for Justice and Democracy has \r\ndecreed that the President, members of the Military \r\nCouncil, the Prime Minister and members of the \r\ncivilian transition Government are ineligible to take \r\npart in future municipal, legislative and presidential \r\nelections. \r\n The absence of real democracy, free choice and \r\nfair elections led the Military Council for Justice and \r\nDemocracy to intervene to end the political stalemate \r\nthat the country was experiencing before 3 August \r\n2005. \r\n Here, on behalf of the Mauritanian people, I \r\nwould like to thank sincerely all fraternal and friendly \r\ncountries and international organizations and bodies \r\nthat have supported our reform process and helped and \r\nsupported us through its various stages. \r\n Mauritania is keen to contribute to strengthening \r\nthe links of fraternity, cooperation and solidarity in its \r\nregion, in line with the common aspirations of our \r\nA/61/PV.14  \r\n \r\n06-52988 30 \r\n \r\npeoples. Within this framework, we affirm our \r\nunswerving faith in building an Arab Maghreb as a \r\nstrategic, non-negotiable choice. \r\n We are also profoundly attached to the spirit of \r\nfraternity and solidarity on our African continent and to \r\nthe close relations that link our country to all fraternal \r\nAfrican countries. Our country will continue to be \r\nfaithful to strengthening the basis for dialogue, \r\nexchange and understanding between peoples and \r\ncivilizations, particularly within the 5+5 forum and the \r\nBarcelona Euro-Mediterranean process. \r\n The major changes that have taken place on the \r\ninternational scene in recent years require a review and \r\nreform of the organs and method of work of the United \r\nNations — in particular, by revitalizing the role of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and ensuring respect for its \r\nresolutions, by reactivating the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil and by making the Security Council more \r\nrepresentative. All this should aim to take account not \r\nonly of important regions in the world, such as Africa \r\nand Latin America, or important regional groups, but \r\nalso of industrialized countries that make major \r\ncontributions to the United Nations, such as Germany \r\nand Japan. \r\n We also believe that the Security Council today \r\nmust improve its methods of work so that it can fulfill \r\nits task of maintaining international peace and security. \r\n In closing, I would like to express the wish that \r\nthe work of this session will be crowned with success. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Mauritania for the statement he \r\nhas just made. \r\n Mr. Sidi Mohamed Ould Boubacar, Prime \r\nMinister of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, \r\nwas escorted from the rostrum. \r\n The meeting rose at 1.50 p.m. \r\n"
