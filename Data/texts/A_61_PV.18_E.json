(Bahrain) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\n The President: I give the floor to His Excellency \r\nMr. Thongloun Sisoulith, Deputy Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Lao People’s \r\nDemocratic Republic. \r\n Mr. Sisoulith (Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic): Allow me, Madam, to congratulate you \r\nupon your election as President of the sixty-first \r\nsession of the General Assembly. I also wish to take \r\nthis opportunity to convey our high appreciation to \r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan for his commendable \r\nachievements throughout his two consecutive terms of \r\noffice, in the maintenance of peace and the promotion \r\nof socio-economic development the world over.  \r\n Despite the fact that today’s global trend is \r\ntowards peace and development cooperation, the \r\ninternational situation continues to undergo rapid and \r\ncomplex changes. Numerous events during the past \r\nyear demonstrate that world peace, justice and security \r\nare far from being secured, due to the use of force in \r\nthe settlement of international problems and violations \r\nof the sovereignty of Member States. All of this creates \r\nmajor impediments to peace and development \r\ncooperation among States and peoples. \r\n Globalization offers new opportunities for \r\neconomic development, yet its benefits are unevenly \r\nshared. Developing countries, in particular the most \r\nvulnerable groups, namely the least developed \r\ncountries, landlocked developing countries and small \r\nisland developing States, have taken important steps to \r\nlaunch trade liberalization and further integrate \r\nthemselves into the world economy. Nevertheless, \r\nthose countries continue to face many problems, \r\nprimarily the lack of basic infrastructure, access to \r\nmarkets, capital, new technology, financing and \r\ninvestment. In order to solve those problems, the \r\ninternational community must create an enabling \r\nenvironment conducive to development, whereby the \r\ninterests of developing countries can be tangibly \r\npromoted.  \r\n To enable the United Nations to meet the \r\nchallenges ahead, it should be reformed in a \r\ncomprehensive, inclusive and balanced manner. This \r\nwould enhance the important role of the Organization \r\nin maintaining international peace and security and \r\npromoting the peaceful settlement of disputes and \r\ninternational cooperation for development. In addition, \r\nthe United Nations reform process should include the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly, the \r\nstrengthening of the Economic and Social Council and \r\nreform of the Security Council in order to render it \r\nmore legitimate, democratic and effective.  \r\n Despite the failure of the recent United Nations \r\nConference to Review Progress Made in the \r\nImplementation of the Programme of Action to \r\nPrevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in \r\nSmall Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, the \r\nA/61/PV.18  \r\n \r\n06-53329 2 \r\n \r\nLao People’s Democratic Republic considers that the \r\nProgramme of Action is a living document and remains \r\na framework for cooperation that empowers States to \r\nwork towards its full and effective implementation. \r\n The historic first meeting of heads of State or \r\nGovernment of the Group of Landlocked Developing \r\nCountries, held on 14 September 2006 in Havana, \r\nCuba, adopted a declaration reaffirming the right of \r\naccess to and from the sea of landlocked countries, in \r\naccordance with international law, and underscored the \r\nimportance of a midterm review to assess the \r\nimplementation of the Almaty Programme of Action. In \r\nmy capacity as Chairman of the Group of Landlocked \r\nDeveloping Countries, I appeal to the international \r\ncommunity to further address the special needs and \r\nproblems of that vulnerable group and to lend us \r\nsupport and assistance in our efforts to bring the \r\nmidterm review process to a successful conclusion. \r\n The country supports General Assembly \r\nresolutions that call upon the Government of the \r\nUnited States of America to put an end to the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed \r\non the Republic of Cuba.  \r\n In the Middle East, there is an urgent need to \r\nimplement Security Council resolution 1701 (2006), \r\nwhich would bring normalcy to the situation in \r\nLebanon and pave the way for a comprehensive \r\nsolution to the Palestinian problem, in conformity with \r\nthe relevant United Nations resolutions. \r\n The situation in the Korean peninsula requires \r\nthat problems should be resolved by peaceful means. In \r\nthat regard, we call for the resumption of the Six-Party \r\nTalks based on the principles and commitments set out \r\nin the Joint Statement of 19 September 2005, in order \r\nto promote peace and security in the region. \r\n The international community is deeply concerned \r\nto see the people of Iraq continue daily to endure \r\nsignificant losses in human lives and property. My \r\ncountry expresses the hope that peace, security and \r\nnational unity will be restored as soon as possible. \r\n In the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, \r\nfollowing the election of members of the National \r\nAssembly of the sixth legislature, held in early 2006, a \r\nnew Government has been formed with the main tasks \r\nof consistently pursuing the policy of overall \r\nrestructuring and ensuring the effective implementation \r\nof our five-year socio-economic development plan. \r\nThat achievement would contribute to strengthening \r\nthe nation’s political stability and social security and to \r\nconsolidating solidarity throughout society.  \r\n Over the past five years, the national economy \r\nhas grown at an annual average rate of 6.3 per cent, the \r\nincidence of poverty has declined from 48 per cent of \r\nthe population in 1990 to 28.7 per cent in 2006, and \r\nopium cultivation has been completely eradicated. \r\nPublic investment was concentrated in areas such as \r\ninfrastructure and social development, particularly \r\nhuman resource development which focuses on \r\neducation, health and culture. Moreover, foreign direct \r\ninvestment has swiftly increased. \r\n For the coming years, the Government will \r\nconcentrate all its efforts and actively mobilize all of \r\nthe country’s forces and potential, in conjunction with \r\nfavourable conditions and opportunities provided by \r\nthe international community, for the purpose of \r\nensuring the successful implementation of our national \r\nsocio-economic development plan for the period 2006-\r\n2010, with a view to achieving steady economic \r\ngrowth at an annual rate of 7.5 per cent.  \r\n It is expected that by 2010, the slash and burn \r\nmethod of cultivation will definitely be terminated and \r\nthat the problem of poor households will be basically \r\nsolved. In addition, policies of support for small and \r\nmedium enterprises will be implemented concurrently \r\nwith the promotion and gradual expansion of \r\nindustrialization, with a view to further improving the \r\nliving conditions of our people and raising them to a \r\nhigher level.  \r\n Similarly, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic \r\nwill further expand its relations and cooperation with \r\nthe international community and will contribute \r\nactively to the regional integration process, particularly \r\nthe integration of countries members of the Association \r\nof Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), with the aim of \r\nenhancing the role of the Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic as an efficient partner of the countries in \r\nSouth-East Asia and other regions of the world. \r\n In closing, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic \r\nreiterates its determination to work in unison with the \r\ninternational community to create an environment \r\nconducive to promoting the well-being of all countries \r\nand peoples the world over. \r\n The President: I give the floor to His Excellency \r\nMr. Hor Namhong, Deputy Prime Minister and \r\n A/61/PV.18\r\n \r\n3 06-53329 \r\n \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and International \r\nCooperation of Cambodia. \r\n Mr. Hor (Cambodia): At the outset, on behalf of \r\nthe Cambodian delegation, let me extend our heartfelt \r\ncongratulations to you, Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa of \r\nthe Kingdom of Bahrain, on your election to the \r\npresidency of the sixty-first session of the General \r\nAssembly. Your election to that important post is a \r\ntestament to Your Excellency’s distinctive abilities and \r\nimpressive achievements over the years. I am \r\nconvinced that under your direction, this year’s session \r\nwill achieve a successful outcome. \r\n Please allow me also to pay tribute to the vision \r\nand tireless efforts of Secretary-General Kofi Annan in \r\npromoting global peace and in taking the necessary \r\nsteps to encourage many initiatives for the reform of \r\nthe United Nations. Our appreciation is also addressed \r\nto His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson for his efficient \r\nleadership as President of the sixtieth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, as well as for his countless \r\ncontributions to United Nations reform initiatives. \r\n In the face of uncertainties and challenges, where \r\nthe world seems to be inundated with conflicts and \r\nserious threats — such as the proliferation of weapons \r\nof mass destruction (WMDs), terrorism, environmental \r\ndegradation and infectious diseases — it is important \r\nfor all of us to keep our commitment to maintain peace \r\nand security in the world. In addition, I believe that the \r\nreduction of global poverty and the achievement of \r\nsustainable development in many developing countries \r\nare vital for human security. At the same time, they are \r\na daunting task for the United Nations as a catalyst of \r\nthe international community in helping to improve the \r\nsituation of those countries. \r\n Concerning the proliferation of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction, Cambodia is of the view that the \r\ninternational community needs to be more vigilant \r\nabout the issue and to ensure that WMDs or their \r\ncomponents do not fall into the wrong hands — those \r\nof terrorists, organized crime groups or others — \r\nwhich could have dangerous implications for \r\ninternational peace and security. In that regard, we \r\nneed to strengthen the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weapons (NPT) regime in order to secure a \r\nbetter and more peaceful world for all. Nor should \r\nsmall arms and light weapons be underestimated, as \r\nthey are an equally dangerous source of conflict, \r\ntransnational crime and violence in many regions and \r\ncountries. \r\n The fight against terrorism remains of utmost \r\npriority for all Governments and for the United \r\nNations, given the continuing threat posed by terrorism \r\ndespite the serious measures and actions that have been \r\ntaken by Governments and international and regional \r\norganizations at various levels, including this world \r\nbody. To combat terrorism effectively requires, I \r\nbelieve, more efforts, more technical capacity, more \r\neducation, more information-sharing among law \r\nenforcement authorities and intelligence communities \r\nand maybe more understanding in some specific cases \r\nof the root causes of acts of violence which are \r\ntantamount to reactions of despair. \r\n Concerning the Middle East crisis, we have to \r\ncongratulate the Security Council on the adoption of its \r\nresolution 1701 (2006) to end the recent war in \r\nLebanon. We call upon all parties concerned to fully \r\nrespect that resolution in order to prevent a repetition \r\nof the conflict and further loss of innocent life. In the \r\nsame vein, the international community should work \r\nmore actively to help bring about a permanent end to \r\nthe violence between Palestine and Israel. I believe that \r\npeace in the Middle East will be better guaranteed only \r\nwhen the leaders of both sides — Palestine and \r\nIsrael — have the courage and wisdom to realize that \r\nthey cannot continue to destroy each other forever, but \r\nmust work together for a lasting peace in the region.  \r\n Both Israel and Palestine have the right to coexist \r\nas independent and sovereign States. At the same time, \r\nthey need to overcome their historical animosity and \r\nhatred towards each other. Whether they like it or not, \r\nIsrael and Palestine are destined to coexist as \r\nneighbours forever. I strongly believe that a peaceful \r\nsolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would create \r\nthe foundation for durable peace and security in the \r\nentire Middle East.  \r\n With regard to United Nations reform, it is clear \r\nthat in recent years, every State member of the world \r\nbody has wanted the United Nations to be reformed. \r\nHowever, when the opportunity arises, we face a \r\ndeadlock on this very important issue, because too \r\nmuch emphasis has been placed on reform of the \r\nSecurity Council. In that regard, I think that we should \r\nlearn this lesson and try to avoid repeating such \r\nmistakes in the future. In other words, we should take a \r\nstep-by-step approach and tackle minor problems first, \r\nA/61/PV.18  \r\n \r\n06-53329 4 \r\n \r\nsuch as strengthening the role of the Economic and \r\nSocial Council to deal with development, since that \r\nissue is less controversial and there is more inclination \r\nto support it.  \r\n Next, we might consider revitalizing the General \r\nAssembly as the sole body representative of all United \r\nNations Member States. Afterward, we can move \r\nforward to the reform of the Security Council. We have \r\nto start first with issues where consensus could be \r\neasily reached, and then move to the more difficult \r\nones, without having to completely stall the United \r\nNations reform process. \r\n Since their adoption in 2000, by and large there \r\nhas been progress in achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). But in actuality there has \r\nbeen little achievement for developing countries thus \r\nfar due to a number of factors, such as lack of financial \r\nand human resources, including the negative impact of \r\nglobalization, which has led to a widening gap between \r\ndeveloped countries and poor nations. \r\n In Cambodia, the Royal Government has set up \r\nits own “MDGs”, called the Cambodia Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, with specific target priorities. \r\nSince their establishment, Cambodia has made positive \r\nprogress in some areas, such as reducing poverty, \r\ncombating HIV/AIDS and improving the livelihood of \r\nour people, thanks to the rectangular strategy of the \r\nRoyal Government, which yielded strong economic \r\ngrowth over the past year. \r\n Extreme poverty in the world today is an affront \r\nto the whole world with 1.3 billion people still living \r\non the margins of life, earning less than one dollar a \r\nday, while another 1.8 billion are living on less than \r\ntwo dollars a day, in spite of the commitment to the \r\nMDGs in 2000. Addressing this crucial problem \r\nrequires painstaking efforts at the national and \r\ninternational levels. The eradication of poverty is, first \r\nand foremost, the responsibility of the whole world and \r\nrequires the cooperation of the developed countries and \r\ninternational organizations. Given the enormous \r\nresources and wealth of this world, I believe that no \r\none on this planet should go hungry while in developed \r\ncountries there is an over-supply of food, which has led \r\nto wasteful dumping. \r\n To deal with global poverty, a comprehensive \r\napproach and collective actions are needed. Official \r\ndevelopment assistance, debt relief, market access, \r\ntransfer of know-how, foreign direct investment and so \r\nforth must be addressed all together, so that developing \r\ncountries can catch up with the current globalization in \r\norder to bridge the gap between peoples and nations in \r\nthis world where we all are living. \r\n Finally, let me reiterate that our world today will \r\ncontinue to face major global threats and challenges. \r\nThe role of the United Nations, as an Organization that \r\nis representative of the whole world, in tackling these \r\nphenomena is of paramount importance for humankind. \r\nTherefore, Cambodia hopes that United Nations reform \r\ncan move ahead to significantly contribute to dealing \r\nwith these challenges successfully. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. K. P. Sharma Oli, Deputy Prime \r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Nepal. \r\n Mr. Oli (Nepal): At the outset, Madam, I would \r\nlike to congratulate you warmly on your election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at this session and \r\nto assure you of my delegation’s full cooperation in \r\ndischarging the responsibilities entrusted to you. I am \r\nfully confident that we will be able to bring the \r\nbusiness of this session to a successful conclusion \r\nunder your leadership. \r\n His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson, the outgoing \r\nPresident, deserves our sincere appreciation for a job \r\nwell done. \r\n I join previous speakers in heartily welcoming the \r\nRepublic of Montenegro as a fellow Member of this \r\nworld body. The continued expansion of the \r\nmembership underlines the importance of the United \r\nNations as an Organization of truly global character, \r\ncentrality and indispensability in global affairs. \r\n This is, indeed, a great opportunity for me to \r\nrepresent the voice of the democratic Government and \r\nthe sovereign people of Nepal in this Assembly. I have \r\nbrought with me greetings and best wishes from the \r\nGovernment and the people of Nepal for the success of \r\nthis session. \r\n I wish to inform the Assembly that Nepal is \r\nundergoing a fundamental transformation following the \r\nrestoration of democracy through the peaceful people’s \r\nmovement in April 2006. The people of Nepal has \r\nbecome, for the first time in history, the real source of \r\nsovereignty and State authority. The historic \r\nparliamentary proclamation of 18 May 2006, and the \r\nsubsequent decisions of the parliament, have made real \r\ncontributions to safeguarding and consolidating the \r\n A/61/PV.18\r\n \r\n5 06-53329 \r\n \r\ngains of the people’s movement. We are currently \r\nengaged in institutionalizing an edifice of a democratic \r\nand inclusive Nepali State through the reinstated \r\nparliament. \r\n The people and the Government of Nepal are \r\nthankful to the international community for its strong \r\nsupport during our struggle for democracy. We are \r\nhopeful of even greater support and solidarity in our \r\ntransition towards full-fledged democracy and lasting \r\npeace. \r\n This momentous change in Nepal has also led to \r\nthe conversion of a protracted conflict into a peace \r\nprocess, and we are confident that it will be brought to \r\na successful conclusion. I take this opportunity to \r\nsincerely express my appreciation to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his assistance to the peace process, \r\nincluding in the monitoring of human rights, assistance \r\nin ceasefire monitoring, arms management and the \r\nobservation of elections to the Constituent Assembly, \r\nat our request. The successful resolution of our internal \r\nconflict will set a worthwhile example to the rest of the \r\nworld that democracy is indispensable and brightens \r\nthe prospects for resolution of conflicts of all kinds. \r\n Now, we have pressing post-conflict \r\nreintegration, rehabilitation and reconstruction needs. \r\nMeeting these challenges requires an enhanced level of \r\ninternational support and assistance. Peace, security, \r\nstability, democracy and development constitute global \r\npublic goods. It is critically important that newly \r\nemerged democracies are safeguarded and protected, \r\nthus allowing them to develop further and flourish. \r\nWith this vision in mind, we strongly support the \r\nnewly established United Nations Democracy Fund. \r\n The United Nations today is confronted with \r\nnumerous challenges, such as international terrorism \r\nand transnational crime, the threat of use of weapons of \r\nmass destruction, narcotic drugs and human trafficking, \r\nmoney-laundering and other financial crimes, regional \r\nconflicts and low-intensity wars, extreme poverty and \r\nhunger, human rights abuses, successive natural \r\ndisasters and the threats posed by pandemics such as \r\nHIV/AIDS and avian flu. \r\n These challenges call for new wisdom founded on \r\nthe principles of collective security, well-being and \r\nprosperity. The United Nations is uniquely placed to \r\nmuster the much-needed philosophical underpinning \r\nbecause of its standing as a global body armed with \r\nlegitimacy. New wisdom alone will not be enough to \r\ndeal with these problems if new strategies, new tools \r\nand new resources do not match it. Nepal firmly \r\nbelieves that multilateral solutions are required to \r\naddress problems and challenges of a global nature. \r\nMultilateralism is the key to promoting global \r\nparticipation in problem-solving and to ensuring \r\ncollective ownership of outcomes. \r\n Today, old and new threats to peace and security \r\nexist side by side. While military threats to security are \r\ndiminishing gradually, new sources of threat have \r\nemerged and are likely to disturb international peace \r\nand security in more than one way. \r\n The growing menace of international terrorism \r\ncharacterizes the security scenario in our post-cold-war \r\nworld. It has been the consistent policy of Nepal to \r\nunequivocally condemn terrorism in all its forms and \r\nmanifestations. It is disheartening to note that no \r\ninternational consensus has yet emerged paving the \r\nway for the early conclusion of a comprehensive \r\ninternational convention against terrorism. In this \r\ncontext, we welcome the adoption of the United \r\nNations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution \r\n60/288).  \r\n We are concerned about the dismal progress on \r\ndisarmament. After failing to agree on non-\r\nproliferation last year, we were unable to produce an \r\nagreement during the review of the regime to control \r\nsmall arms and light weapons. We are also constantly \r\nreminded of the deadlock in efforts to resolve nuclear \r\nissues by peaceful means. Nepal stands for general and \r\ncomplete disarmament of all weapons of mass \r\ndestruction, including biological, chemical, nuclear and \r\nradiological weapons, in a time-bound manner. The \r\ndemand of our time is that we compete for peace, not \r\nwar, and for development, not armaments. \r\n We have offered to host, in Kathmandu, the \r\nUnited Nations Regional Centre for Peace and \r\nDisarmament for Asia and the Pacific. Despite our \r\nlong-standing commitment and sincere efforts, the \r\nCentre has yet to be relocated. I wish to reiterate that \r\nthe Government of Nepal is ready to sign the host \r\ncountry agreement, pursuant to the Assembly \r\nresolution, as soon as the Secretariat provides it with a \r\ndraft. We urge the Secretariat to conclude the necessary \r\nprocedures for the relocation of the Centre to Nepal \r\nwithout further delay. \r\n The recent upsurge of violence in Lebanon has \r\nleft unbearable human tragedy in its wake and has \r\nA/61/PV.18  \r\n \r\n06-53329 6 \r\n \r\nresulted in the large-scale destruction of material \r\nproperty. We welcome the ongoing ceasefire and \r\nexpress our support for Security Council resolution \r\n1701 (2006) on strengthening the United Nations \r\nInterim Force in Lebanon. We are committed to \r\ncontributing a battalion of troops for the cause of peace \r\nthere. \r\n Nepal’s profound interest and continued \r\nparticipation in United Nations peacekeeping missions \r\nunderscores its contribution to the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. Even when it had its \r\nown internal conflict, Nepal never stopped sending \r\ntroops to United Nations peacekeeping missions. \r\nNepalese Blue Helmets have served in various \r\nmissions, including in many trouble spots, in an \r\nexemplary manner, earning international repute for \r\nthem and their country. Currently, Nepal has over \r\n3,500 troops in various United Nations missions. Many \r\nof them have sacrificed their precious lives in the \r\nservice of peace and humanity. Nepal will continue to \r\nuphold this noble cause and participate in future \r\nmissions when asked to do so. \r\n Nepal’s commitment to human rights is total and \r\nunflinching. Nepal firmly believes that all human \r\nrights are universal, indivisible, interrelated, \r\ninterdependent and mutually reinforcing. We welcomed \r\nthe establishment of the Human Rights Council in the \r\nbelief that that body will prove effective in protecting \r\nand promoting human rights around the globe based on \r\nthe salient principles of universality, objectivity and \r\nnon-selectivity. \r\n The current Government of Nepal has accorded \r\ntop priority to the protection and promotion of human \r\nrights with a view to translating Nepal’s international \r\nhuman rights commitments and obligations into reality. \r\nWe have been working closely with the United Nations \r\nhuman rights bodies, including the United Nations \r\nOffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in \r\nNepal, to create an environment in which full \r\nenjoyment of human rights by all is guaranteed. The \r\nreturn of democracy and the start of the peace process \r\nhave led to a significant improvement in the protection \r\nof human rights in Nepal. We greatly appreciate the \r\nrole played by the Office of the High Commissioner for \r\nHuman Rights in Nepal in improving the human rights \r\nsituation in the country. \r\n We are determined to bring to an end the culture \r\nof impunity which was so pervasive during the \r\nautocratic regime. Our belief is that no one is above the \r\nlaw and that those who violate and abuse human rights \r\nmust be brought to justice. We are fully committed to \r\nprotecting human rights in all situations and creating a \r\nframework to bring to justice those who have violated \r\nhuman rights in the past. \r\n Opportunities arising out of globalization, such as \r\nthose associated with global migration, have been \r\nstifled by unfriendly policy regimes around the world. \r\nThe rights of migrant workers must be protected in all \r\nsituations in accordance with international norms. \r\nNepal’s experience shows that the benefit of \r\nremittances generated by migrant workers counts a \r\ngreat deal for developing countries. But that cannot in \r\nany way be a substitute for development assistance, \r\ndebt relief or trade concessions. \r\n The benefits of trade liberalization are not \r\ndistributed equitably. The multilateral trading regime \r\nmust be made responsive to the needs and requirements \r\nof the developing and least developed countries. \r\nEnhanced trading opportunities, coupled with \r\nproductive capacities, are critically important for the \r\nachievement of sustained economic growth and poverty \r\nreduction in the least developed countries (LDCs). The \r\nagreed commitments for duty-free and quota-free \r\naccess for the products of the least developed countries \r\nneed to be complemented with favourable rules on \r\norigin.  \r\n We are concerned about the suspension of World \r\nTrade Organization (WTO) talks on the development \r\nround, and urge the immediate revival of the talks to \r\ncomplete the Doha Development Agenda. \r\n Our development agenda has been advancing \r\nrather slowly. We realize that, given the current pace, \r\nmany countries will not be able to achieve the \r\ninternationally agreed development goals, including \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. It reminds us that \r\nwe must urgently and sincerely implement all the \r\ncommitments agreed to in the various global compacts \r\nof recent years, including the Monterrey Consensus, \r\nthe Millennium Declaration, the Johannesburg Plan of \r\nImplementation and the Brussels Programme of Action \r\nfor the Least Developed Countries. \r\n This year’s midterm review of the Programme of \r\nAction for the Least Developed Countries showed that \r\nmost of the least developed countries will not be able \r\nto achieve the agreed targets within the previously \r\n A/61/PV.18\r\n \r\n7 06-53329 \r\n \r\ndefined time frame unless we accelerate the pace of \r\nimplementation. \r\n The least developed countries need better policies \r\non aid, trade, investment, debt relief and \r\ncapacity-building, as well as timely reforms in the \r\ninternational financial institutions. We call on the \r\ninternational community to take a holistic approach, \r\ncombining policies to support the LDC development \r\nagenda. The least developed countries need a \r\nsubstantial flow of external aid and investment if they \r\nare to meet those goals. Investment in poorer countries \r\nis not just a moral responsibility; it is investment in the \r\ncollective security of the world. \r\n Many least developed countries are handicapped \r\nas a result of being landlocked, which significantly \r\nreduces their competitive edge in regional and \r\nmultilateral trading regimes. This state of affairs \r\ncontinues to frustrate their development efforts. We \r\nurge the international community to pay greater \r\nattention to the plight of those countries and to make \r\nserious efforts to implement internationally agreed \r\ncommitments. \r\n It is a scar on our conscience that hundreds of \r\nmillions of people are living as refugees in various \r\nparts of the globe. The international community must \r\ntake it as its bounden duty to address their concerns in \r\na non-selective manner. \r\n I regret to inform the Assembly that more than \r\n100,000 refugees from southern Bhutan have been in \r\ncamps in Nepal for over a decade and half — a painful \r\nexperience — despite the bilateral agreements reached \r\nbetween Nepal and Bhutan. With no early and lasting \r\nsolution on the horizon, the refugees are showing \r\nincreasing signs of frustration and desperation. In \r\nessence, this is a problem between the Government of \r\nBhutan and its citizens. Nepal has entered the picture \r\nsimply because it has provided shelter to fleeing \r\nrefuges on humanitarian grounds. The issue cannot be \r\nresolved in the absence of a genuine willingness on the \r\npart of the Government of Bhutan to solve this \r\nproblem.  \r\n The international community must exert a \r\npositive influence so as to break the impasse. We stress \r\nthat the Bhutanese refuges must be given the right to \r\nreturn to their home country in conditions of dignity \r\nand respect and that any solution must be acceptable to \r\nthem. Nepal also supports the democratic aspirations of \r\nthe people of Bhutan and urges Bhutan to \r\naccommodate the plight of the refugees in their \r\npolitical dispensation. \r\n Our Organization has made great strides, \r\nespecially in the adoption of the reform measures \r\nendorsed by world leaders here last year. The \r\nGovernment of Nepal remains committed to supporting \r\nall reform initiatives aimed at addressing the concerns \r\nand aspirations of all Member States. \r\n The strength of the United Nations lies in its \r\ndemocratic decision-making and in its impartiality, \r\nneutrality and efficiency. The General Assembly — the \r\nonly global body in which the voices of the peoples of \r\nthe world can be heard — must be placed at the \r\nforefront of all decision-making processes within the \r\nUnited Nations. The organs dealing with socio-\r\neconomic issues must be strengthened and enabled to \r\ntake a lead role in the fulfilment of international \r\ndevelopment objectives. \r\n Contemporary realities dictate that the United \r\nNations must undergo a fundamental transformation \r\nwithout undermining its founding principles and \r\nobjectives. Any reform of the United Nations will be \r\nincomplete without a commensurate reform of its \r\nprincipal organ responsible for the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. The Security Council \r\nmust be democratized so as to provide it with greater \r\nlegitimacy and credibility. There is a genuine need to \r\nincrease Council membership, in both the permanent \r\nand non-permanent categories, so as to make the \r\nCouncil more representative. Such an increase should \r\ninclude two permanent seats each for the Asian and \r\nAfrican regions, one for Latin America and one for \r\nWestern Europe. We also need to improve the \r\nCouncil’s working methods. \r\n This year, Member States will elect the next \r\nSecretary-General of our Organization. In accordance \r\nwith the principle of equitable geographical \r\nrepresentation and that of rotation, Nepal reiterates that \r\nthe next Secretary-General should come from Asia. We \r\nalso believe that a greater role should be played by the \r\nAssembly in the appointment of the Secretary-General. \r\nI commend the role played by the outgoing Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, during his term of office. He \r\nled important reforms at the United Nations and made \r\ngenuine efforts to establish the central role of our \r\nOrganization in resolving global problems and \r\ndebating international issues. \r\nA/61/PV.18  \r\n \r\n06-53329 8 \r\n \r\n Nepal has submitted its candidature for non-\r\npermanent membership of the Security Council for the \r\nperiod 2007-2008. We think that we rightly deserve it, \r\nas nearly two decades have elapsed since we last \r\nserved on the Council, in 1988-1989. This world body \r\nis fully aware that Nepal has for a long time been \r\nmaking substantial contributions to the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security by regularly providing \r\ntroops to various peacekeeping missions. Moreover, we \r\nbelieve that Nepal’s election to the Council this time \r\naround would represent a significant recognition of its \r\ndemocratic credentials in a changed context. The \r\npeople of Nepal deserve due recognition from the \r\ninternational community for their unprecedented \r\ncourage and for the determination with which they \r\nhave defeated autocracy and restored democracy. I \r\nmake a sincere appeal to fellow Members to extend \r\ntheir valuable support to Nepal’s candidature and allow \r\nit to serve on the Council with renewed confidence in \r\nthe fulfilment of its fundamental responsibilities. \r\n The purposes and principles of the United \r\nNations contained in its Charter, including the \r\nsovereign equality of nations, the peaceful resolution \r\nof all disputes, non-interference in the internal affairs \r\nof States, and the principle of refraining from the threat \r\nor use of force are sacrosanct to Nepal. I solemnly \r\nreiterate Nepal’s profound commitment to the founding \r\nobjectives and principles of the United Nations, as \r\nenshrined in its Charter. \r\n The United Nations today suffers from a lack of \r\ncredibility, an inability to arrive at important decisions, \r\nweak implementation of its own declarations and \r\ndecisions, and slowness in responding to challenges \r\nthat require its most pressing attention. We need to \r\nchange this situation. Together, we can better equip our \r\nOrganization to respond to those challenges. \r\n The President: I give the floor to His Excellency \r\nMr. Jean Ping, Minister of State, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs, Cooperation, la Francophonie and Regional \r\nIntegration of Gabon and former President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n Mr. Ping (Gabon) (spoke in French): Madam \r\nPresident, I should like at the outset sincerely to \r\ncongratulate you on your well-deserved election to \r\npreside over the General Assembly at its sixty-first \r\nsession. Your election represents not only a mark of \r\nconsiderable recognition for the Kingdom of Bahrain, \r\nwhich has tirelessly worked to promote the purposes \r\nand principles of the United Nations, but also, in \r\npersonal terms, the culmination of your long legal and \r\ndiplomatic career. \r\n Above and beyond the usual courtesies, I should \r\nlike to encourage you, Madam, and to assure you of \r\nour full readiness to cooperate to ensure the success of \r\nyour lofty mission. \r\n I should like also to pay tribute to Mr. Jan \r\nEliasson for the talent, dedication and perseverance \r\nwith which he guided our work throughout the sixtieth \r\nsession. I should like in particular to acknowledge him \r\nfor his determination in leading the negotiations that \r\nachieved considerable progress in implementation of \r\nthe decisions and recommendations of the 2005 World \r\nSummit. \r\n Lastly, I should like to convey to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, our deep admiration for the \r\nwisdom and courage he has consistently shown in \r\ndischarging his difficult mandate, and in particular for \r\nthe ambitious measures he initiated throughout his two \r\nterms of office to adapt the United Nations to current \r\nrealities. \r\n At a time when his tenure as Secretary-General is \r\ncoming to an end and many observers will be \r\nreviewing and assessing his accomplishments, I should \r\nlike, for may part, to pay a well-deserved tribute to him \r\nfor having provided us with a clear vision of the work \r\nof the United Nations in terms of the three pillars of \r\ninternational peace and security, development and the \r\npromotion of human rights worldwide. \r\n The consensus adoption of the 2005 World \r\nSummit Outcome Document (resolution 60/1) was an \r\nunequivocal recognition by our leaders of the General \r\nAssembly’s central role as the chief deliberative, \r\npolicymaking and representative organ of the United \r\nNations. I welcome the fact that since the Summit, \r\nmost of the important recommendations of the \r\nOutcome Document have already been implemented as \r\npart of the United Nations reform process. \r\n Indeed, following the difficult negotiations, the \r\nsixtieth session of the General Assembly established \r\ntwo important bodies — the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission and the Human Rights Council — both of \r\nwhich, as we know, have been operational since June. \r\nIn addition, the Central Emergency Response Fund was \r\nestablished, and a number of major resolutions were \r\nadopted. I am thinking in particular about resolution \r\n A/61/PV.18\r\n \r\n9 06-53329 \r\n \r\n60/42, on the Optional Protocol to the Convention on \r\nthe Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel; \r\nthe resolution on development; and, most recently, \r\nresolution 60/288, on the United Nations Global \r\nCounter-Terrorism Strategy. \r\n During the present session, bolstered by that \r\nmajor progress, we must continue our efforts to \r\ncomplete the reform process. For example, we must \r\nintensify our efforts to conclude the negotiations aimed \r\nat adopting a comprehensive convention against \r\ninternational terrorism and at reforming the Secretariat, \r\nthe Economic and Social Council and the Security \r\nCouncil. \r\n The theme you proposed for this year’s general \r\ndebate, Madam President, “Implementing a global \r\npartnership for development”, is very timely. That \r\ntheme, which echoes Goal 8 of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, will undoubtedly make it possible \r\nto follow up and implement the decisions emanating \r\nfrom the Monterrey Consensus and reaffirmed at the \r\nSeptember 2005 World Summit.  \r\n It is extremely urgent that all development \r\npartners honour all their commitments. Our appeal to \r\nthem takes fully into account the primary responsibility \r\nof all States to plan and carry out their own \r\ndevelopment. It also addresses the many constraints \r\nhampering the developing countries, in particular the \r\nimpact of HIV/AIDS, malaria and other infectious \r\ndiseases on their populations and economies.  \r\n Therefore, I cannot fail to welcome the fact that, \r\nin the Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS (resolution \r\n60/262), adopted on 2 June 2006 at the end of the \r\nHigh-level Meeting devoted to follow-up on the \r\nimplementation of the Declaration of Commitment on \r\nHIV/AIDS, the international community stressed the \r\nspecial situation of sub-Saharan Africa and recognized \r\nthe efforts made by African Governments to fight the \r\npandemic. \r\n Gabon, for its part, has undertaken ambitious \r\ninitiatives ranging from awareness raising to the \r\nimplementation of action plans such as the \r\nmultisectoral strategic plan to fight AIDS. The \r\nGabonese head of State and his spouse, Ms. Edith \r\nLucie Bongo Ondimba, are personally involved in that \r\ninitiative. \r\n Aware of the threat that the pandemic poses to \r\nhuman development and security, we should advocate \r\nmore courageous measures aimed in particular at \r\nincreasing the contributions to the Global Fund to \r\nFight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, strengthening \r\nprevention methods and improving access to treatment \r\nfor infected persons. \r\n However, the many challenges facing African \r\nStates are not inevitable. That is the strong conviction \r\nthat led African heads of State or Government to \r\nlaunch the New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(NEPAD), a comprehensive vision in which African \r\ncountries have pledged, through good economic and \r\npolitical governance, to take control of the social, \r\neconomic and political destiny of their respective \r\nnations. While NEPAD’s main goal is development, we \r\nare fully aware that there can be no development \r\nwithout a framework that fosters peace, security and \r\nrespect for human dignity.  \r\n Our world continues to be characterized by \r\ntension and deep crises that aggravate the prevailing \r\ninstability and insecurity. Old and new conflicts \r\ncontinue to threaten the peace and security of a number \r\nof nations, and their effects have strong repercussions \r\nat the regional and international levels.  \r\n The violent conflict that has once again shaken \r\nthe Middle East — a conflict that has claimed hundreds \r\nof innocent human lives and caused enormous material \r\ndamage — has shown how essential it is to do \r\neverything possible to establish a lasting peace in that \r\npart of the world. With specific regard to the Israeli-\r\nPalestinian conflict, only collective and sustained \r\nefforts based on the principle of two States, Israel and \r\nPalestine, living side by side in peace and security can \r\nmake it possible to achieve a just, lasting and equitable \r\nsettlement of that conflict. Gabon, for its part, endorses \r\nthe idea of urgently holding an international conference \r\non the Middle East. \r\n In Africa, many hot spots of tension also remain \r\nworrisome. While we should welcome the Darfur \r\nPeace Agreement, signed at Abuja in May 2006, we \r\nmust acknowledge that the overall situation remains \r\nfragile. The persistent divisions between certain parties \r\nto the conflict even threaten to jeopardize the \r\nAgreement, which was reached at considerable effort. \r\nHere, I should like to pay a well-deserved tribute to the \r\ninternational community, and in particular the African \r\nUnion, for their tireless efforts to achieve a peaceful \r\nsettlement of the Darfur crisis. \r\nA/61/PV.18  \r\n \r\n06-53329 10 \r\n \r\n The situation in Côte d’Ivoire also continues to \r\nbe a source of concern for Africa and the rest of the \r\ninternational community. In the Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo, a historic and crucial phase has begun \r\nwith the holding of general elections in that brotherly \r\ncountry. Here, I wish to pay tribute to the international \r\ncommunity, particularly the European Union — whose \r\nEUFOR peacekeeping troops are stationed in Gabon — \r\nand to the United Nations. Its support, together with \r\nthat of EUFOR, has thus far made it possible to hold \r\nsmooth general elections in that country, particularly \r\nthe first round of the presidential election, which took \r\nplace on 30 July 2006.  \r\n It is now essential that all Congolese political \r\nactors continue, in a spirit of patriotic fervour, to \r\nconsolidate the gains of the democratic transition \r\nprocess in an atmosphere of peace and harmony. In \r\norder to do that, they will also need the active support \r\nand sustained commitment of the international \r\ncommunity to ensure that the enormous sacrifices made \r\nby all do not come to naught for lack of follow-up. \r\n In that regard, the establishment of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission is an appropriate \r\ninstitutional response to the many needs of countries \r\nemerging from conflict. I take this opportunity to \r\ncongratulate Ambassador Ismael Gaspar Martins of \r\nAngola on his election as Chairman of the \r\nCommission’s Organizational Committee. I welcome \r\nthe fact that two African countries, Burundi and Sierra \r\nLeone — which have experienced many years of \r\nwar — have been chosen as the first countries to \r\nbenefit from the Commission’s attention. \r\n However, if our efforts to strengthen international \r\npeace and security are to be effective, they must also \r\nfocus in particular on the area of conflict prevention. \r\nThe excellent report of the Secretary-General on the \r\nprevention of armed conflict (A/60/891) offers us a \r\ngood foundation for our work as we consider this \r\nimportant issue. \r\n We achieved a major breakthrough in 2001 with \r\nthe adoption of the Programme of Action to Prevent, \r\nCombat and Eliminate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms \r\nand Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. We regret, \r\nhowever, that the June and July 2006 review \r\nconference for the Programme of Action ended in \r\nfailure. Despite this, we need to pursue the \r\nimplementation of the Programme, as well as the \r\nadoption of an international instrument on the marking \r\nand tracing of these weapons. We also need to move \r\nforward with consultations in order to begin \r\nnegotiations leading to the adoption of an instrument \r\non brokering. Similarly, we have the moral duty and \r\nshared responsibility to renew disarmament \r\nnegotiations, particularly in the nuclear sphere.  \r\n One of the major trials facing our Organization is \r\nthe continuation and completion of negotiations on \r\nSecurity Council reform, in accordance with the \r\nrecommendation made by heads of State or \r\nGovernment at the September 2005 World Summit. We \r\nalso need to implement the resolutions regarding the \r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly, the \r\nmost recent of which was adopted on 8 September \r\n2006 as resolution 60/286. At the same time, major \r\nnegotiations in the Assembly over the past two sessions \r\nhave demonstrated, if such demonstration were needed, \r\nhow crucial a vitalized Assembly is for our \r\nOrganization. We also need to take the appropriate \r\nmeasures to ensure greater transparency and \r\nconsistency in the functioning of the United Nations \r\nsystem, ensuring improved implementation of its \r\nmissions.  \r\n As you are aware, Madam President, we have a \r\nparticularly heavy programme of work. I am certain \r\nthat, under your able guidance, the General Assembly \r\nwill make progress in the various areas of its agenda. \r\nWe will therefore need to continue to work with a \r\nheightened sense of our collective interest. The very \r\ncredibility of our Organization depends on it.  \r\n The President: I now call on Her Excellency \r\nMrs. Joy Uche Ogwu, Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nthe Federal Republic of Nigeria.  \r\n Mrs. Ogwu (Nigeria): I bring you, Madam \r\nPresident, good tidings from Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, \r\nPresident and Commander-in-Chief of the Federal \r\nRepublic of Nigeria, who could not be here in person \r\nas a result of a national tragedy. He has asked me to \r\ndeliver his statement to the Assembly and it is now my \r\nprivilege and honour to read it out. \r\n  “On behalf of the people and the \r\nGovernment of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, I \r\nwould like to extend my sincere congratulations \r\nto you, Madam, and your country, the Kingdom \r\nof Bahrain, on your historic election as President \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. \r\nYour assumption of that high office is a source of \r\ninspiration to us all, particularly to women all \r\n A/61/PV.18\r\n \r\n11 06-53329 \r\n \r\nover the world. I assure you of the support and \r\ncooperation of my delegation. \r\n  “I would like to extend my profound \r\nappreciation to your predecessor, His Excellency \r\nMr. Jan Eliasson, for the commitment and \r\ndedication with which he presided over the affairs \r\nof the sixtieth session. This was particularly \r\nevident during the delicate negotiations that \r\nresulted in the establishment of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission and the creation of the Human \r\nRights Council. \r\n  “The founding fathers of the United Nations \r\nenvisaged an international organization whose \r\nprimary strength would rest on the ability of its \r\nMembers to act collectively and in a spirit of \r\ncooperation in solving international problems. \r\n  “The theme for this year’s general debate, \r\n‘Implementing a global partnership for \r\ndevelopment’, aptly captures this aspiration and, \r\nindeed, reaffirms one of the objectives of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. Nigeria restates \r\nits firm commitment to the principle that genuine \r\nglobal partnership is the key to development. This \r\nis particularly so in the face of the many \r\nchallenges confronting us today. \r\n  “For Africa, the most urgent challenge \r\nremains the resolution of conflicts and the \r\nmaintenance of peace and security as the \r\nfoundation for socio-economic progress. We \r\nremain undaunted and have collectively decided \r\nto take action to address the problem under the \r\nauspices of the African Union. Our efforts have \r\nbeen bolstered by the active engagement of the \r\nSecurity Council and the international \r\ncommunity, for which we remain grateful. I am \r\nhappy to note that in Liberia and Sierra Leone, \r\nwhere hostilities have happily ceased, there are \r\nsigns of progress everywhere as democracy and \r\nits benefits take their most important first steps. \r\n  “With respect to Côte d’Ivoire, Nigeria \r\nwelcomes the recent efforts by all parties to \r\novercome their differences through dialogue. We \r\nurge them to remain steadfast in their \r\ncommitment in order to ensure that the peace \r\nprocess remains on course. However, it is now \r\ndoubtful that elections can take place in October. \r\nBut we must not allow the elections in Côte \r\nd’Ivoire to be postponed beyond 31 December \r\n2006. If the proposed extraordinary meeting of \r\nthe Economic Community of West African States \r\nin early October fails to achieve this goal, a \r\nSecurity Council resolution will become \r\nnecessary to impose heavy sanctions on all \r\nculprits and their relations. \r\n  “Nigeria is encouraged by the progress \r\ntowards implementation of the Darfur Peace \r\nAgreement, which was signed in Abuja last June. \r\nWe are, however, concerned by the slow pace of \r\nimplementation regarding key aspects of the plan, \r\nwhich has exacerbated the humanitarian situation. \r\nWe share the frustration of the international \r\ncommunity over the lack of access to vulnerable \r\ngroups in need of urgent humanitarian assistance. \r\nWe call on all parties to respect their \r\ncommitments. \r\n  “The situation in Darfur has placed a heavy \r\nburden on the African Union and continues to \r\nexert pressure on its meagre resources, as it \r\nstruggles to maintain a peacekeeping force of \r\nover 7,000 troops. Africa’s commitment to peace \r\nin Darfur was reaffirmed by the latest decision of \r\nthe Peace and Security Council of the African \r\nUnion, at its meeting in New York on \r\n20 September 2006, to extend the mandate of the \r\nAfrican Mission in the Sudan (AMIS) until \r\n31 December 2006. Nigeria calls on the \r\ninternational community to urgently assist the \r\nAfrican Union with the logistical and financial \r\nsupport to sustain AMIS through that date. \r\n  “If the early removal of the obstacles that \r\nhave thus far prevented the conclusion of the \r\nnegotiations on the replacement of the African \r\nUnion force with a United Nations peacekeeping \r\nforce cannot be achieved, the African Union may \r\nbe left with no other option but to allow the \r\ntroops to return to the contributing countries. The \r\nconsequences of the withdrawal of AMIS without \r\na United Nations umbrella will be the full \r\nresponsibility of the Government of the Sudan. \r\n  “Nigeria is concerned by the increasing \r\nthreat of violence and insecurity in the world \r\nbrought about by threats or acts of terrorism. \r\nNigeria strongly condemns all acts of terrorism \r\nand calls upon the international community to \r\nredouble its efforts to defeat this heinous crime in \r\nall its forms and manifestations. \r\nA/61/PV.18  \r\n \r\n06-53329 12 \r\n \r\n  “On the situation in the Middle East, \r\nNigeria welcomes Security Council resolution \r\n1701 (2006) and calls for the implementation of \r\nthe terms of the ceasefire by both parties. We \r\nbelieve, however, that a long-lasting solution \r\nmust come through dialogue and a readiness to \r\nabandon violence as a means of resolving the \r\ncrisis. The root causes of the Middle East crisis \r\nmust also be addressed in a comprehensive \r\nmanner for lasting peace to be attained. We \r\nreaffirm our commitment to a two-State \r\narrangement: Israel and Palestine living in peace \r\nwithin secure borders, in accordance with \r\nSecurity Council resolutions. We therefore call on \r\nthe international community to show greater \r\ncommitment to the peaceful and early resolution \r\nof the Israeli-Palestinian crisis. \r\n  “West Africa has experienced conflicts for \r\nmany years as a result of the illicit proliferation \r\nof small arms and light weapons in the region. \r\nWe believe that the restoration and maintenance \r\nof peace are critical for socio-economic \r\ndevelopment in the subregion. Towards that end, \r\nin June this year, States member of the Economic \r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) \r\nadopted a landmark Convention on Small Arms, \r\nLight Weapons, Their Ammunition and Other \r\nAssociated Material to reduce violence in the \r\nsubregion and pave the way for the achievement \r\nof peace, security, stability, cooperation and \r\ndevelopment. The Convention bans international \r\narms transfers, except those for the legitimate \r\ndefence and security needs of member States. Of \r\ngreatest significance is the ban on transfers to \r\nnon-State actors, who have been largely \r\nresponsible for political instability in the \r\nsubregion, as elsewhere. \r\n  “In this regard, I wish to express Nigeria’s \r\ndeep disappointment that the first United Nations \r\nReview Conference on implementation of the \r\nProgramme of Action on small arms and light \r\nweapons failed to agree on a final document, \r\nincluding a similar ban on arms transfers to non-\r\nState actors. I urge all Member States to be \r\nguided by the example of ECOWAS on this issue \r\nwhen and if the Conference reconvenes. \r\n  “As a demonstration of Nigeria’s \r\ncommitment to the fight against illicit small arms, \r\nwe have deposited the instrument of ratification \r\nof the Firearms Protocol to the United Nations \r\nConvention against Transnational Organized \r\nCrime. We also call for a comprehensive and \r\nlegally binding global arms trade treaty. \r\n  “Humankind has made giant strides in the \r\nfield of nuclear technology since the discovery of \r\nthe atom. This has opened up vistas of \r\nopportunities for determined and committed \r\nsocieties to uplift the standard of living of their \r\ncitizenry. Indeed, nuclear energy has become a \r\nveritable source of socio-economic development \r\nand a reliable source of electricity generation. We \r\nnote in particular the global trend towards the \r\nutilization of nuclear technology for the \r\ngeneration of electricity, agricultural \r\ndevelopment, human health and environmental \r\ndevelopment, especially for developing countries. \r\n  “In the context of this development and of \r\nthe enormous energy crisis that confronts us in \r\nNigeria, my Government decided to inaugurate \r\nthe Board of the Nigeria Atomic Energy \r\nCommission. With the inauguration of the Board, \r\nour quest for energy self-sufficiency has begun. \r\n  “Nigeria remains resolute in its commitment \r\nto the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons (NPT) and the Treaty of Pelindaba on \r\nthe African nuclear-weapon-free zone. We wish to \r\nassure the international community of our \r\ndetermination to restrict the use of nuclear energy \r\nto purely peaceful purposes. \r\n  “I take this opportunity to reiterate our deep \r\nappreciation to this body for the invaluable \r\nsupport it has given to the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD). We are also \r\nvery appreciative of the interest shown by the \r\ninternational community and the commitments it \r\nhas made in support of NEPAD. The NEPAD \r\ninitiative remains our continent’s most viable \r\nsocio-economic blueprint; it could bring \r\nsustained economic growth while strengthening \r\ngood governance and enhancing the protection of \r\nthe human rights of our peoples. \r\n  “Trade is one of the most potent and \r\ngenuine engines of economic growth and \r\ndevelopment. We therefore support efforts that \r\nwould enhance the ability of our countries to \r\nenjoy the benefits of the successful conclusion of \r\nagreements on regimes under the auspices of the \r\n A/61/PV.18\r\n \r\n13 06-53329 \r\n \r\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO). In this \r\nconnection, we regard the recent breakdown of \r\nthe WTO Doha round of development talks as a \r\nvery serious setback. The successful conclusion \r\nof Doha development talks and the \r\nimplementation of their outcome would provide \r\nsuccour to the almost 1 billion people currently \r\nsubsisting on less than one dollar a day. We urge \r\nall parties to return to the negotiating table and \r\nresume talks in the spirit of global partnership, \r\ncooperation and global economic progress. \r\n  “Nigeria remains committed to the fight \r\nagainst the HIV/AIDS pandemic, malaria, \r\ntuberculosis and related diseases. We have taken \r\nbold steps to deal with them. To this end, we \r\nhosted the Special Summit of the African Union \r\non HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria in Abuja \r\nin May this year. At the Summit, African leaders \r\nreaffirmed their commitment to earlier \r\ndeclarations and pledged to take immediate action \r\nto ensure universal access to relevant drugs. We \r\napplaud the Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS \r\n(resolution 60/262) which was adopted at the \r\nUnited Nations High-level Meeting on HIV/AIDS \r\nlast June and hope that it will be fully \r\nimplemented. \r\n  “On 14 August this year, Nigeria lowered its \r\nflag for the last time on the Bakassi peninsula and \r\neffectively withdrew its presence there in \r\naccordance with the ruling of the International \r\nCourt of Justice. With this final act, Nigeria has \r\nfulfilled its obligations under the terms of the \r\nagreement between my country and Cameroon. I \r\nuse this opportunity to recognize the positive \r\ncontributions of Mr. Kofi Annan and members of \r\nthe international community and to thank them \r\nfor their assistance and support. Nigeria hopes \r\nthat our brotherly neighbour will protect and \r\nrespect the rights and freedoms of Nigerian \r\nnationals who decide to remain in the area in \r\naccordance with the mutually agreed terms. \r\n  “Nigeria believes that the reform of the \r\nUnited Nations system must not lose momentum. \r\nNational or regional interests should not be \r\nallowed to obscure our common objectives for a \r\nreinvigorated United Nations. The reform should \r\nbe linked to the overall interest of making our \r\nOrganization stronger, more effective and better \r\npositioned to meet the challenges facing both the \r\nweak and the strong. \r\n  “The identity, importance and relevance of \r\nthe different organs of the Organization must be \r\nmaintained. Above all, nothing should be done to \r\nweaken one in favour of the other. The General \r\nAssembly, as the pre-eminent, deliberative, \r\npolicymaking and representative organ of the \r\nUnited Nations, deserves the support of all \r\nMembers. It remains the only organ where States \r\nbig or small, rich or poor, find equality and voice. \r\n  “It is in this context that African countries, \r\nalong with other Members of the United Nations, \r\nhave called for the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil. For us, no reform will be complete \r\nwithout the reform of that vital organ. The \r\nSecurity Council, as now constituted, does not \r\nreflect the realities of our time. We hope that \r\nprogress will be made on this issue during this \r\nsession. \r\n  “I cannot conclude this statement without \r\npaying a special tribute to my brother, the \r\ndistinguished statesman Mr. Kofi Annan. Nigeria \r\nsalutes his dedicated service to our Organization. \r\nHe has, in the past 10 years, assiduously piloted \r\nthe United Nations through very important \r\nmilestones and turbulent waters.  \r\n “It is, indeed, impossible to forget the \r\nreform agenda that you have initiated and set in \r\nmotion. We are proud of you and your services \r\nand wish you the best in your future endeavours. \r\nAs I am attending the General Assembly for the \r\nlast time in my capacity as President of the \r\nFederal Republic of Nigeria, I wish to take this \r\nopportunity to thank all my colleagues and the \r\nSecretary-General as well as all the staff of our \r\nOrganization for their support and cooperation \r\nover the past seven years.” \r\n The President: I now give the floor to Her \r\nExcellency The Honourable Dame Billie Miller, MP, \r\nSenior Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and \r\nForeign Trade of Barbados. \r\n Dame Billie Miller (Barbados): I am pleased to \r\njoin with preceding speakers in congratulating you on \r\nyour election to preside over the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-first session. The fact that you are a woman \r\nmakes me doubly happy. In 61 years you are only the \r\nA/61/PV.18  \r\n \r\n06-53329 14 \r\n \r\nthird female President of the Assembly. Throughout \r\nyour distinguished career, you have championed with \r\ndetermination and courage the cause of women’s \r\nrights, and I am confident that you will bring these and \r\nother outstanding qualities to your presidency. I pledge \r\nto you the fullest cooperation of the delegation of \r\nBarbados. \r\n I would also wish to thank and congratulate your \r\npredecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, for his leadership at the \r\nsixtieth session of the General Assembly and in \r\nparticular for the skill he demonstrated in that very \r\nchallenging task. \r\n I must also take this opportunity to say a special \r\nfarewell on behalf of the Government and people of \r\nBarbados to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, \r\nwho has served this Organization with great skill and \r\ndedication over the past 10 years. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral has had to face myriad challenges, and he has \r\nalways found the strength of character, purpose and \r\nfortitude to craft appropriate solutions. Barbados \r\nwishes the Secretary-General well as he proceeds into \r\nretirement at the beginning of next year, and we look \r\nforward to welcoming him again to the beautiful shores \r\nof Barbados whenever he feels the need for some \r\nrespite and recuperation. \r\n I would also like at this time to welcome our \r\nnewest Member, Montenegro, into the family of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n In July this year, the formal return of Haiti to the \r\ncouncils of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) \r\nwas greeted with great satisfaction by all. At that time, \r\nthe CARICOM heads of Government pledged their full \r\nassistance to Haiti to facilitate efforts to promote that \r\ncountry’s development and renewal. We call on the \r\ninternational community to support the strengthening \r\nof democracy and the social and economic \r\ndevelopment of Haiti and to disburse in a timely \r\nmanner the funds pledged for Haiti’s reinvigoration \r\nand development. We cannot afford to repeat past \r\nmistakes. \r\n This session of the General Assembly provides an \r\nimportant first opportunity to review and assess the \r\nprogress in the implementation of the decisions of the \r\nhistoric 2005 World Summit. At this juncture, it is \r\nBarbados’s opinion that the results are decidedly \r\nmixed. The reform agenda decided on at the World \r\nSummit, encompassed a broad spectrum of issues. We \r\nare pleased that progress has been made in areas such \r\nas the establishment of the Human Rights Council, the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and the Central Emergency \r\nResponse Fund, the agreement on a counter-terrorism \r\nstrategy and the revitalization of the General Assembly. \r\nWe regret that progress on the cluster of development \r\nissues, which enjoyed broad consensus at the 2005 \r\nWorld Summit, has been painfully slow. Also, further \r\nwork needs to be undertaken on Secretariat and \r\nmanagement reform as well as on reform of the \r\nSecurity Council. \r\n The primacy of development on the global \r\nagenda must be ensured. Barbados considers the \r\ninitiative to select development as the theme for this \r\ngeneral debate to be laudable. If we are to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015, the \r\nnext ten years must be the decade of implementation, \r\nin which we collectively mobilize the will and \r\nresources needed. In this connection, we commend the \r\nSecretary-General for recommending a number of \r\nadditional targets that would facilitate the monitoring \r\nof progress in the implementation of the Summit \r\nOutcome (resolution 60/1). \r\n When I addressed this Assembly one year ago, I \r\ncalled for the adoption of a new target within the MDG \r\nframework on universal access to sexual and \r\nreproductive health and rights. Barbados thanks the \r\nSecretary-General for recognizing the critical link \r\nbetween sexual and reproductive health and rights and \r\ndevelopment, and we fully support his recommendation \r\nfor a new target under Goal 6 of the MDGs. We are \r\nequally supportive of his other recommendations for \r\nnew targets on universal access for treatment of \r\nHIV/AIDS by 2010 and on decent work and productive \r\nemployment. \r\n We would, too, like to see speedier \r\nimplementation of the decisions on increased financial \r\nresources for development which were made last year \r\nat the Group of Eight (G-8) meeting at Gleneagles and \r\nat the World Summit. These resources are now needed \r\nurgently, particularly by those countries, like my own, \r\nthat have prepared their comprehensive national \r\ndevelopment strategies to achieve the MDGs and other \r\ninternational development goals and objectives. \r\n While the developing countries bear \r\nresponsibility for their own development, national \r\nactions will not be sufficient to bring about their fuller \r\nparticipation in the global economy. These actions \r\nmust be complemented by a supportive international \r\n A/61/PV.18\r\n \r\n15 06-53329 \r\n \r\nsystem, the essential elements of which include \r\nimprovement in global governance, more coherence in \r\nthe operation of the United Nations system and a \r\ngreater voice for the United Nations in the global \r\ndevelopment policy dialogue. \r\n Changes in global governance have not kept pace \r\nwith the growth of global interdependence, and far-\r\nreaching institutional changes are required to bring \r\nabout a more effective system. We call for \r\ndemocratization of the governance of the international \r\nfinancial and trade systems and concrete steps to be \r\ntaken to end the marginalization of developing \r\ncountries and small economies in the policy \r\nformulation and decision-making processes in the \r\nmultilateral, financial and trade institutions. \r\nGlobalization must be made more inclusive and its \r\nbenefits more equitably distributed. \r\n Barbados also believes that improvement in \r\nglobal governance must be mirrored in the \r\nstrengthening of the management and coordination of \r\nthe United Nations operational activities at the country \r\nlevel. This will ensure delivery of better coordinated \r\ndevelopment assistance. It will lead to better \r\nabsorption of aid by recipient countries and ultimately \r\nfacilitate their attainment of the MDGs. Indeed, the \r\nUnited Nations must be developmentally holistic. We \r\nanxiously await the Secretary-General’s report on the \r\nwork of the High-level Panel on this issue. A stronger \r\nUnited Nations voice in development led by a \r\nrevitalized Economic and Social Council will also \r\ncontribute to an improved international system. \r\nBarbados will continue to work with other Member \r\nStates to adopt a resolution on reform of the Economic \r\nand Social Council at this sixty-first session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n Permit me to focus for a few moments on the \r\nissue of trade; for there is nothing else more important \r\nfor small developing countries than an improved \r\nmultilateral trading system if we are to have the chance \r\nto participate in and benefit from the ongoing process \r\nof globalization. The failure of WTO talks to reach \r\nagreement on new commitments for trade reform in the \r\nagricultural and industrial goods sectors represents a \r\nvery real crisis in international trade negotiations. The \r\nchallenges of reforming trade in these areas are not \r\ninsurmountable. We call on the developed countries to \r\ndemonstrate a unity of purpose to resolve differences \r\namong themselves, remembering that this round of \r\ntrade talks is about development, or more precisely \r\nabout raising the standard of living of people in \r\ndeveloping countries. Consistent with the theme of this \r\nyear’s session of the Assembly, “Implementing a global \r\npartnership for development”, developed and \r\ndeveloping countries must partner together to achieve a \r\nworkable agreement. \r\n If there is to be a successful outcome to the trade \r\nnegotiations, a narrow focus on trade liberalization and \r\nenhanced market access alone will not be enough. For \r\nwhile it is important to have agreements that open up \r\naccess to markets, it is even more essential for any \r\nnegotiated trade agreement to contain provisions that \r\nwould assist developing countries to implement \r\npolicies aimed at transforming their economies. In \r\nother words, market access is meaningless without \r\ngoods and services with which to trade. \r\n An adjustment mechanism will be required to \r\nassist developing countries in coping with the loss of \r\npreferences, markets and the resultant reduction in \r\nfinancial resources during this most important \r\ntransitional phase of their development. For the small \r\nand vulnerable economies this will mean some form of \r\nspecial and differential treatment to facilitate their full \r\nintegration into the multilateral trading system. \r\n Special and differential treatment should not be \r\nseen as a concession or as an exception to the rules, but \r\nrather as a concept based on the development and \r\npolicy needs of countries at differing levels of \r\ndevelopment. It should consist of a broad mix of \r\nprovisions and programmes that recognize and \r\nappreciate the characteristics of developing countries \r\nand the economic challenges that trade liberalization \r\nand globalization pose for them, and it should seek to \r\naddress these factors genuinely. In the words of the \r\nPrime Minister of Barbados, The Right Honourable \r\nOwen Arthur, special and differential treatment is \r\nnothing more than reciprocity with flexibility. Among \r\nequals, equality; among unequals, proportionality. \r\n During this session, the Assembly will return to a \r\nconsideration of the agenda item on the Caribbean Sea. \r\nWe appeal to the members of the international \r\ncommunity to recognize the fragility of this precious \r\nshared natural resource of the Caribbean, and its \r\nimportance for most of our present and future \r\neconomic activity, and agree on measures that will \r\nneed to be taken to recognize the Caribbean Sea as a \r\nspecial area within the context of sustainable \r\ndevelopment. \r\nA/61/PV.18  \r\n \r\n06-53329 16 \r\n \r\n Also during this Assembly session, the two \r\nhundredth anniversary of the abolition of the slave \r\ntrade will be recognized. Barbados joins other \r\ndelegations in requesting the Assembly to set aside a \r\nday in late March of next year to commemorate this \r\nimportant date. This will not only deepen our \r\nknowledge and understanding of slavery and the slave \r\ntrade, but also contribute to the removal of all the \r\nvestiges of slavery. \r\n Recent events suggest that we need to remain \r\never vigilant to threats of terrorism. They further \r\nremind us that once again we face increasing \r\nchallenges to world peace and security. Barbados is of \r\nthe view that there must be a concerted effort on the \r\npart of the international community to ensure that \r\ndisputes among States do not continuously result in \r\nmilitary action and loss of lives and that States remain \r\nfaithful to the rules of humanitarian law and civilian \r\nrights. \r\n The questioning of the efficacy of the United \r\nNations has not abated in spite of the ongoing reform \r\nprocess, and the threat to multilateralism remains real. \r\nIn this, our fortieth year of membership of the United \r\nNations, Barbados reaffirms its faith in the \r\nOrganization and proclaims its unwavering \r\ncommitment to multilateralism. Over the past 40 years, \r\nBarbados has played its part in strengthening and \r\nwidening the role of the United Nations to enable it to \r\npromote and protect human rights, to eradicate poverty \r\nand disease and to cultivate a global culture of peace. \r\n Strengthening the role of the United Nations \r\nsystem in the management of global affairs and \r\nupholding and defending its moral authority remain \r\nkey foreign policy priorities of the Government of \r\nBarbados. With the growing complexity and \r\nunpredictability of international affairs, especially in \r\nthe context of globalization, and with the emergence of \r\nnew challenges to peace and security, the fulfilment of \r\nthe role of the United Nations remains critical. It is \r\nnow more than ever that we need to strengthen the \r\nstructures and institutions of the international system to \r\nsafeguard our common interests in achieving a global \r\norder of peace and economic and social progress for \r\nall. We must all work together to reform this vital \r\ncommunity of nations and ensure its pre-eminence in \r\nmatters of development, human rights, and peace and \r\nsecurity, and that it remains the principal forum for \r\nexercising multilateralism. \r\n We are not at liberty to abstain from this task. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Hassan Wirajuda, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Indonesia. \r\n Mr. Wirajuda (Indonesia): I wish to congratulate \r\nyou, Madam, on your election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-first session. It signals \r\nthe increasing role of women, especially women from \r\nthe Muslim world, in international affairs; and this is a \r\nvery welcome and positive development. May I also \r\nthank and commend His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson \r\nfor his able stewardship at the sixtieth session. \r\n Let me now join colleagues in paying tribute to \r\nthe outstanding service of His Excellency Mr. Kofi \r\nAnnan, whose 10-year term of office as Secretary-\r\nGeneral is about to conclude. Among the valuable \r\nservices he has rendered is to give the world \r\ncommunity a way of firmly grasping the fundamental \r\nchallenges of our time: the challenge of security, the \r\nchallenge of underdevelopment and the challenge of \r\nhuman rights and the rule of law. \r\n We have contemplated these challenges well \r\nenough to know the answers. We know that long-term \r\nsecurity can be achieved only through a durable and \r\njust peace, not one that is imposed on the weak by the \r\nstrong. We can overcome the challenge of poverty only \r\nthrough a global partnership for development that will \r\nequitably distribute the benefits of globalization. The \r\nchallenge of human rights and the rule of law can only \r\nbe met by Governments that rule by the consent of the \r\ngoverned, Governments that are elected by and \r\naccountable to the people. In a word, democracy. \r\n Peace, development and democracy are \r\ninseparable. Development is paralysed and democracy \r\nis meaningless in situations of violence and bloody \r\nconflict. Nowhere is this more poignantly true than in \r\nthe Middle East. Over the years, Lebanon has rebuilt \r\nits civil-war-ravaged economy, only to be bombed to \r\nthe ground recently by Israel. Hundreds of innocent \r\ncivilians were killed in those military strikes, many of \r\nthem women and children. The carnage stopped with \r\nthe adoption of Security Council resolution 1701 \r\n(2006), but this came only after a very lengthy process \r\nduring which time the Lebanese people underwent so \r\nmuch unnecessary suffering and loss. The frustration \r\nand inability to take immediate action is radicalizing \r\nmany people in the Muslim world. \r\n A/61/PV.18\r\n \r\n17 06-53329 \r\n \r\n This serves to prove the importance of reforming \r\nthe Security Council, in its composition, as well as the \r\nway it works, so that it can take effective action when \r\naction is a matter of life and death for thousands of \r\npeople, as was recently the case in Lebanon. \r\n Deeply committed to being a part of the solution \r\nto this crisis, Indonesia is sending an 850-strong \r\nmechanized infantry battalion to form part of the \r\nUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), as \r\nmandated by Security Council resolution 1701 (2006). \r\nIt has become an Indonesian tradition to contribute \r\ntroops to United Nations peacekeeping forces. The first \r\ncontingent was deployed as part of the United Nations \r\nEmergency Force I in Suez in 1957. \r\n As for the Arab-Israeli conflict, it is essential to \r\nrecognize that the problem of Palestine lies at its core. \r\nThere are no military solutions to this problem, as \r\nmilitary might can never guarantee security. There can \r\nonly be a two-State solution, with the parties to the \r\nconflict assuming their responsibilities and taking \r\nconcrete measures to lay down the foundations of \r\npeace. In this regard, we encourage the formation of a \r\nPalestinian government of national unity, as that will \r\nopen a window of opportunity for the resumption of \r\ndialogue and for the revival of the Quartet’s Road Map \r\nfor peace.  \r\n We appeal to the Security Council to act on this \r\nissue with dispatch, for Muslims everywhere have a \r\nstrong emotional reaction to what they perceive to be \r\nthe oppression and humiliation of their Palestinian, \r\nIraqi and Afghan co-religionists. Terrorists operating as \r\nfar away from the Middle East as South-East Asia \r\njustify their heinous crimes as retaliation for what they \r\nconsider to be aggression against Islam. \r\n Thus today we are witness to the error of some \r\nWestern circles attributing to Islam a propensity for \r\nviolence, matched by the error of terrorist groups \r\nclaiming that violent means are sanctified by Islam. \r\nThe only way to liberate the human mind from these \r\nerrors is through intensive and extensive dialogue. \r\n That is why Indonesia has been actively \r\npromoting interfaith and intercultural dialogue in the \r\nAsia-Pacific region and within the Asia-Europe \r\nMeeting (ASEM). It is our way of debasing the \r\nideology of the terrorists and at the same time \r\nempowering the moderates and strengthening the voice \r\nof moderation. \r\n Earlier this month, we collaborated with Norway \r\nin holding the first global intermedia dialogue, which \r\nwas attended by leading mass-media practitioners from \r\nfive continents. For while the media can be a force for \r\ngood, it can also do a great deal of harm, as shown by \r\nthe recent cartoon controversy. Through this dialogue, \r\nwe aimed to promote mass media sensitivity to other \r\ncultures and faiths, while upholding freedom of \r\nexpression. As with the interfaith dialogue, the \r\nintermedia dialogue has been institutionalized and will \r\nbe carried out annually. \r\n There is also a great need for dialogue to address \r\nthe proliferation of nuclear weapons in Asia. While the \r\nthreat of nuclear weapons has subsided in other \r\nregions, a new nuclear theatre may be developing from \r\nWest to East Asia. \r\n It is therefore important that we find a diplomatic \r\nsolution to the nuclear issue regarding Iran and North \r\nKorea. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons (NPT), as the cornerstone of disarmament, \r\nmust be strengthened. In fact, all weapons of mass \r\ndestruction should be abolished. \r\n Indeed, we must work for peace in a relentless \r\nday-to-day struggle. Even when the guns are silent, \r\nthat is not enough for the long-term survival of \r\nhumankind. There must also be development. There \r\nmust be an end to poverty as a basic problem of the \r\nhuman condition; otherwise social grievances will be a \r\nconstant threat to peace. \r\n We in the international community have the \r\nresources and the skills to conquer poverty. For that \r\ngoal to be attainable, however, the developed and the \r\ndeveloping world must be able to faithfully carry out a \r\ncontract of partnership that stipulates for each side a \r\nset of obligations. \r\n We do not need to negotiate that contract; it \r\nalready exists. For the past decade and a half, the \r\ninternational community, within the framework of the \r\nUnited Nations, has produced a substantial body of \r\ndocuments to which we have formally committed \r\nourselves. These constitute a contract for the conquest \r\nof poverty and its attendant maladies. It is not just a \r\ncontract between and among States; it is also a contract \r\nwith our peoples and with future generations. \r\n Hence, it is appropriate that the theme of our \r\nsixty-first session should be “Implementing a global \r\npartnership for development.” As President Susilo \r\nA/61/PV.18  \r\n \r\n06-53329 18 \r\n \r\nBambang Yudhoyono pointed out recently, all we need \r\nto do is bind ourselves to this contract and carry it out \r\naccording to its letter and spirit. This means political \r\nwill, which is often lacking, and a streak of sincerity, \r\nwhich is very rare in our time. \r\n The developed nations have four basic \r\nobligations under this contract. The first is to tear down \r\nthe walls of protectionism and open up their markets to \r\nthe products of the developing world. They must \r\nsalvage the Doha Development Round.  \r\n Their second obligation is to relieve their \r\ndeveloping counterparts of some of the burdens of the \r\ndebt crisis. Developing countries are often unable to \r\nfund their development programmes because they have \r\nto make huge debt payments. \r\n The third obligation of the developed countries is \r\nto ensure sufficient volumes of financial flows to \r\ndeveloping countries, especially in the form of foreign \r\ndirect investment. Many developing countries are \r\nsimply too poor to muster the capital they need to get \r\nthem out of poverty. \r\n Another essential requirement of development is \r\ntechnology. Hence, the fourth obligation of the \r\ndeveloped countries is to share their technology with \r\nthe developing world, striking a balance between social \r\nresponsibility and respect for intellectual property \r\nrights. \r\n The obligations of developed countries must be \r\nmatched by those of the developing countries, \r\notherwise the partnership will not be equitable. The \r\nfirst obligation of developing countries is to practise \r\ngood governance. We must therefore wage a relentless \r\nbattle against all forms of corruption. The only form of \r\ncapital that is abundant in the developing world is \r\nhuman capital. It is therefore the second obligation of \r\nthe developing countries to protect and enhance that \r\ncapital through education, human resources \r\ndevelopment and health care. \r\n The third obligation of the developing countries \r\nis to provide a climate that is friendly to foreign \r\ncapital, particularly foreign direct investment. This \r\nnormally means a package of incentives. It also means \r\na level playing field and a reputation for good \r\ngovernance. \r\n It is our fourth and particular obligation to make \r\nuse of our natural resources with wisdom so that we \r\nmeet the needs of today without robbing our future \r\ngenerations of their legacy. These obligations are not \r\neasy to fulfil, but they must be carried out if the global \r\npartnership for development is to work. \r\n In the case of Indonesia, we carried out the first \r\nobligation as a matter of survival: it was the only way \r\nwe could climb our way out of the limbo to which the \r\nAsian financial crisis relegated us almost a decade ago. \r\nWe had to make our transition to a more fully \r\ndemocratic system of governance, becoming, in the \r\nprocess, a full-fledged democracy. \r\n We instituted reforms in every aspect of national \r\nlife. Our economic recovery is a product of reform, and \r\nour new drive for economic growth is driven by \r\nreform. In the spirit of reform and dialogue, we were \r\nable to forge a peace agreement with the separatist Free \r\nAceh Movement. The peace has been holding for more \r\nthan a year and promises to be durable. \r\n As for our human resources, our Constitution \r\nmandates that 20 per cent of our budget be allocated to \r\neducation. As part of our effort to achieve universal \r\neducation, we are providing free schooling to some 60 \r\nmillion primary through high school students. To \r\nalleviate poverty, we are continuing to extend direct \r\ncash subsidies to some 19.1 million households. \r\n Last year, one fourth of our total population of \r\n220 million benefited from the medical services of \r\ncommunity health centres. We recently reduced the \r\nprice of generic medicines by 30 to 50 per cent. \r\n With regard to foreign investment, Indonesia is \r\nsending out some very positive signals. We are \r\nlegislating a new package of investment incentives, \r\nincluding a law on tax reform, a law that rationalizes \r\nthe labour market and regulations to streamline \r\ncustoms procedures. We are establishing special \r\neconomic zones. The response of foreign direct \r\ninvestors was to pour some $6 billion into Indonesia \r\nlast year. \r\n To ensure the sustainability of our environment, \r\nwe have launched a national programme entitled \r\n“Towards a green Indonesia” aimed at building the \r\ncapacity of local government to conserve natural \r\nresources and control environmental degradation. In \r\nsum, Indonesia is ready for partnership — ready to be \r\nan active participant in that global partnership for \r\ndevelopment that will enable the developing world to \r\nreach its Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). I \r\nbelieve that many other developing countries are just \r\n A/61/PV.18\r\n \r\n19 06-53329 \r\n \r\nas ready for that partnership; and, if they feel they are \r\nnot ready at the moment, it takes nothing more — but \r\nnothing less as well — than political will to get \r\nthemselves to a proper state of preparedness. That also \r\napplies to the countries of the developed North — they \r\nmust also have the political will to fulfil their end of \r\nthe partnership. Otherwise, that partnership will not be \r\nworth the paper on which so many Summit documents \r\nwere printed. Given that development, peace and \r\nhuman dignity are inseparable, the destiny of this \r\npartnership parallels the destiny of the entire human \r\nrace; a partnership for development is also a \r\npartnership for peace and for the dignity of the human \r\nbeing. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Borys Tarasyuk, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Ukraine.  \r\n Mr. Tarasyuk (Ukraine): First of all, I would like \r\nto congratulate our President on her election to this \r\nhigh post and to assure her of the full support of \r\nUkraine throughout her mandate. I would also like to \r\nexpress our deep appreciation of her predecessor and \r\nmy good friend, Mr. Jan Eliasson, for his outstanding \r\ncontribution to progress in implementing the decisions \r\nof the 2005 World Summit. \r\n I would also like to pay special tribute to the \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, who is about to \r\nrelinquish his important and noble mission. I praise Mr. \r\nAnnan for his valuable personal contributions and \r\ndevoted efforts to further all aspects of United Nations \r\nactivities and wish him the best in his further \r\nendeavours. \r\n We are convinced that the next Secretary-General \r\nmust be a person truly deserving of the post and who \r\nwill discharge this responsible duty with honour. I \r\nwould like to again emphasize the justified position of \r\nthe Eastern European States regarding the priority right \r\nfor a representative of this region to be appointed to \r\nthe top post at the United Nations. Eastern Europe \r\nremains the only region that has never had a \r\nrepresentative serve as Secretary-General. In this \r\nrespect, we welcome the nomination of Ms. Vaira Vike-\r\nFreiberga, President of the Republic of Latvia. \r\n Our achievements in implementing last year’s \r\nSummit decisions are quite impressive. The Human \r\nRights Council, of which Ukraine is an active member, \r\nhas started its work. The Peacebuilding Commission, \r\nthe Central Emergency Response Fund and the United \r\nNations Democracy Fund are all functioning and \r\nmaking important contributions towards overcoming \r\ndisasters and injustice. All of these are notable \r\nmilestones in the process of reforming the United \r\nNations. \r\n Still, we are far from ensuring the adaptation of \r\nour Organization to today’s realities, let alone \r\npreparing it for addressing tomorrow’s threats and \r\nchallenges. The reform of the Security Council, the \r\nstrengthening of the Economic and Social Council, the \r\npromotion of the 2005 World Summit agenda for \r\ndevelopment and improvement in the management of \r\nthe Secretariat have yet to be tackled. \r\n It is well known that without the modernization \r\nof the Security Council, an indispensable pillar of the \r\ncollective security system, reform of the United \r\nNations would be incomplete. From standpoint of the \r\nMember States of the Eastern European Group, this \r\nthesis could be paraphrased as follows: no enlargement \r\nof the Security Council would be complete without \r\nensuring the enhanced representation of Eastern \r\nEurope. The doubling of the Group’s membership since \r\n1991, with, most recently, the Republic of Montenegro \r\njoining the United Nations as its one hundred ninety-\r\nsecond Member, supports our argument. At this point, I \r\nwould like to welcome the friendly Republic of \r\nMontenegro to the United Nations family. \r\n We need to unite our efforts so that the United \r\nNations — that is, all of us together — can adequately \r\nrespond to the broad spectrum of existing and future \r\nchallenges in the areas of security, development and \r\nhuman rights. \r\n Recent commemoration of the fifth anniversary \r\nof the barbaric terrorist attack on this city, as well as \r\nthe growing number of terrorist acts in many parts of \r\nthe world, should leave no doubt that terrorism \r\ncontinues to remain one of the most dangerous threats \r\nof the present day. \r\n Ukraine welcomes the recent adoption by the \r\nGeneral Assembly of the Global Counter-Terrorism \r\nStrategy and is ready to make important contributions \r\ntowards its effective realization. This important \r\ndecision has become another strong signal that \r\nterrorism will not be tolerated. The Strategy also \r\ntestifies to the readiness of the international \r\ncommunity to strengthen coordination and increase the \r\neffectiveness of measures to combat this hideous \r\nphenomenon, within the framework of a concrete \r\nA/61/PV.18  \r\n \r\n06-53329 20 \r\n \r\naction plan. On its part, Ukraine recently ratified the \r\nCouncil of Europe Convention on the Prevention of \r\nTerrorism. We call upon Member States to make \r\nadditional efforts during the current session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly to elaborate on and adopt the \r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism. \r\n Ukraine is deeply concerned with the situation in \r\nthe Middle East. Recent events in Lebanon and the \r\ncontinuing Israeli-Palestinian crisis have shown the \r\nneed for more decisive international efforts aimed at \r\nreturning peace and stability to this region. Violence \r\nand hatred cannot become the alternatives to the \r\nrestoration of dialogue and negotiations aimed at \r\nachieving a comprehensive and lasting settlement of \r\nthe Arab-Israeli conflict on all of its tracks. \r\n Ukraine therefore welcomes the adoption of \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1701 (2006) on Lebanon. \r\nSupport of the resolution by all parties in the region \r\nallows for hope that it will be fully implemented. As a \r\nlongstanding contributor to the United Nations \r\nPeacekeeping efforts, including in the Middle East, \r\nUkraine made its concrete proposals on contributing to \r\nthe enhanced United Nations Interim Force in \r\nLebanon. \r\n The inability to agree on a set of commitments \r\nregarding disarmament and non-proliferation was one \r\nof the major setbacks of the 2005 World Summit. More \r\nthan a decade ago Ukraine made a historic contribution \r\nin this area when it unilaterally renounced the world’s \r\nthird largest nuclear weapons arsenal. Therefore, we \r\ncall upon Member States to strive for progress in the \r\nareas of disarmament and non-proliferation in the \r\nUnited Nations and other forums, for the sake of future \r\ngenerations. \r\n Lately, the international community has been \r\nconcerned with the nuclear programme of Iran. \r\nUkraine supports the efforts of those countries that \r\nseek to gain Teheran’s return to full and close \r\ncooperation with the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (IAEA). Appropriate levels of transparency \r\nand cooperation with Iran on this issue would help to \r\nease the concerns of the international community. \r\nUkraine stands for the right of all nations to use \r\nnuclear energy for peaceful purposes; however, in \r\nrealizing this right, nations must fully adhere to \r\ncommitments in the field of non-proliferation. \r\n One of the most important tests of the ability of \r\nthe United Nations to deal effectively with inter-ethnic \r\nconflict will be how the future status of Kosovo is \r\nhandled. \r\n Taking into account the fragile situation in and \r\naround Kosovo, the political process of determining its \r\nfuture status should be handled with maximum \r\nresponsibility by all the parties involved. Any imposed \r\ndecision leading to a unilateral change of borders of \r\nthat internationally recognized democratic State will \r\ninevitably destabilize the situation in the Balkan region \r\nand set dangerous precedents in Europe and the entire \r\nworld. Unfortunately, we are already witnessing the \r\nunfolding of an undesirable scenario created by \r\nattempts to use the Kosovo settlement as a precedent \r\nfor claiming independence for several self-proclaimed \r\nregimes within the boundaries of the former Soviet \r\nUnion. I refer to so-called referendums on \r\nindependence recently held in Transdniestria, Moldova, \r\nand scheduled for the near future in South Ossetia, \r\nGeorgia. Ukraine and the international community do \r\nnot recognize these referendums, considering them \r\nillegitimate and without legal consequences. \r\n Ukraine supports the need for negotiations \r\nbetween Belgrade and Pristina aimed at finding a \r\nmutually acceptable solution based on Security Council \r\ndecisions, including resolution 1244 (1999). It is \r\nextremely important to ensure that the decision of the \r\nSecurity Council on the final status of Kosovo does not \r\nimpose a solution, which can be taken only with the \r\nclearly expressed consent of both parties concerned.  \r\n As representative of Ukraine and Chair of the \r\nGUAM — Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Moldova \r\nGroup — Organization for Democracy and Economic \r\nDevelopment, I would like to thank the countries that \r\nsupported placing on the agenda of the sixty-first \r\nsession of the General Assembly item 27 on protracted \r\nconflicts in the GUAM area and their implications for \r\ninternational peace, security and development. It is an \r\nimportant step that will help to draw attention to the \r\nneed for more active and effective steps by the \r\ninternational community to achieve progress in settling \r\nconflicts on the territory of Azerbaijan, Georgia and \r\nMoldova. We call for implementing the initiative \r\nproposed by the President of Ukraine on Transdniestria \r\nentitled “To settlement through democracy”, the plan \r\nfor a peace settlement in South Ossetia presented by \r\nthe President of Georgia, and for implementing the \r\nSecurity Council resolutions and OSCE decisions on \r\nthe conflicts in Nagorny Karabakh and Abkhazia. \r\nThese conflicts are among the main obstacles to the \r\n A/61/PV.18\r\n \r\n21 06-53329 \r\n \r\nfull-scale democratic transformation of the region, \r\nwhich is among the core elements of Ukraine’s \r\nregional policy. \r\n Having gained a new level of integration during \r\nthe Kyiv Summit last May, GUAM member States set \r\nas their main goals the strengthening of democratic \r\nvalues, the rule of law, and human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms, the deepening of European \r\nintegration, and the achievement of sustainable \r\ndevelopment and the greater well-being of their \r\npeoples. \r\n The Black Sea Economic Cooperation \r\nOrganization (BSEC) is another promising model of \r\nmultilateral political and economic cooperation. \r\nDuring the 14 years of its dynamic existence, that \r\norganization has proved its value as a framework for \r\nregional cooperation. Because issues of energy security \r\nare very important for Europe today, the Black Sea and \r\nCaspian Sea regions take on special significance for \r\nthe secure, stable extraction and transportation of \r\nenergy resources. Ukraine is ready to take an active \r\npart in promoting energy projects within the BSEC \r\nframework. We are convinced that the BSEC can \r\neffectively support the efforts of the world community \r\nto combat terrorism, resolve the so-called frozen \r\nconflicts in the region and combat trans-border crime. \r\nIt is necessary to coordinate BSEC activity with \r\ncorresponding programmes supported by the United \r\nNations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation \r\nin Europe, the European Union and NATO. \r\n The Forum of the Community of Democratic \r\nChoice (CDC), held in Kyiv in December 2005, is \r\nanother example of cooperation aimed at strengthening \r\nEuropean democratic values in Eastern Europe. The \r\nCDC is a forum in which the States of the Baltic Sea-\r\nBlack Sea-Caspian Sea area with the Balkans discuss \r\ntheir aspirations for the higher democratic standards \r\nrequired for full-scale European integration. GUAM, \r\nBSEC and the CDC are valuable contributions to the \r\ncreation of an Eastern Europe area akin to the \r\nEuropean Union area of democracy, stability and \r\nprosperity. \r\n Democracy, the rule of law and respect for human \r\nrights and fundamental freedoms are essential elements \r\nof Ukraine’s domestic and foreign policies. That is why \r\nwe are proud to have been elected to the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. As a member of that body, Ukraine is ready to \r\nwork with other States to bring about real change \r\nthrough the promotion of human rights worldwide. \r\n The international community is responsible for \r\nprotecting people threatened with genocide or other \r\nviolations of fundamental human rights. In two years, \r\nwe will mark the sixtieth anniversary of the United \r\nNations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment \r\nof the Crime of Genocide. One and a half decades \r\nbefore the adoption of the Convention, and even before \r\nthe tragedy of the Holocaust, the Ukrainian people was \r\na victim of genocide. Deliberately organized by the \r\nCommunist totalitarian regime for the purpose of \r\ndestroying the vital core of the freedom-loving \r\nUkrainian people — its peasantry — the Holodomor in \r\nUkraine of 1932 and 1933 killed 7 million to 10 \r\nmillion innocent men, women and children, about \r\n25 per cent of Ukraine’s population at that time. The \r\nCommunist regime tried to conceal the scale and tragic \r\nconsequences of that inhuman crime from the world \r\ncommunity, and they succeeded for a long time.  \r\n After Ukraine regained its independence, many \r\nnew appalling and horrifying facts were revealed. The \r\nparliaments of a number of countries have recognized \r\nthe Holodomor of 1932 and 1933 as an act of genocide. \r\nUkraine calls on the United Nations, as the collective \r\nvoice of the international community, to contribute to \r\nthe commemoration of the sixtieth anniversary of the \r\nConvention by recognizing the Holodomor as an act of \r\ngenocide against the Ukrainian people. That step would \r\ncontribute towards making genocide and mass abuse of \r\nhuman rights impossible in the future. \r\n With the same aim, a number of events will take \r\nplace in Kyiv tomorrow to commemorate the sixty-fifth \r\nanniversary of the Babyn Yar tragedy. The mass \r\nexecutions by the Nazis there were among the first sad \r\npages of the evolving tragedy of the Holocaust. Etched \r\nin the memory of the Ukrainian people, it also saw the \r\ndeath of tens of thousands of Soviet prisoners of war of \r\nvarious nationalities. This event will be yet another \r\nimportant reminder of the lessons of history and the \r\nneed to prevent all manifestations of anti-Semitism, \r\nxenophobia and intolerance. \r\n Needless to say, we should focus on \r\nimplementing the Millennium Development Goals and \r\nnew commitments on the global development agenda \r\nmade at the 2005 World Summit. There has been mixed \r\nprogress in this area, and the commitments and \r\npromises made have not yet been translated into action \r\nA/61/PV.18  \r\n \r\n06-53329 22 \r\n \r\nwith direct impact on the lives of peoples in need. The \r\nresponse to global threats should be effective and \r\ntimely. It took the international community nearly 20 \r\nyears since the first recorded cases of AIDS to \r\nrecognize that this disease could threaten the very \r\nexistence of humanity. The twenty-sixth special session \r\nof the Assembly initiated by Ukraine together with \r\nother States, and held in 2001, was a turning point in \r\ncombating HIV/AIDS. I want to confirm Ukraine’s \r\ncommitment to implementing the Declaration of \r\nCommitment on HIV/AIDS (resolution S-26/2) and to \r\nexpress hope for continuing close cooperation in this \r\nfield with the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis \r\nand Malaria, with the World Bank and with United \r\nNations specialized agencies. \r\n Lately, we have witnessed the emergence of a \r\nnew disease that potentially poses no less a challenge \r\nto humanity than HIV/AIDS. Avian influenza threatens \r\nthe entire world and knows no borders. It is our joint \r\nresponsibility to ensure that all countries are protected \r\nagainst this threat. Combating the spread of avian \r\ninfluenza and preparations for a possible pandemic of \r\nhuman influenza demand concerted action at the \r\nnational, regional and global levels. Should we repeat \r\nthe mistakes of the past or should we learn the lessons \r\nand thus meet the challenge prepared? We believe that \r\nthe General Assembly should consider the problem and \r\nprovide the answer. \r\n In the more than 60 years since its creation, the \r\nUnited Nations has grown both in numbers — from 51 \r\nStates to 192 — and in quality. Our Organization has \r\ngained invaluable experience in changing the world so \r\nthat every person can enjoy more security, justice and \r\ndignity. However, much remains yet to be achieved. I \r\nbelieve that it is within our power and in our interest to \r\ndo all we can to ensure that the world is united not only \r\nby a common past but by a common future as well. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Mohamed Bedjaoui, Minister of \r\nState, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria. \r\n Mr. Bedjaoui (Algeria) (spoke in French): At a \r\ntime when the United Nations continues on its path \r\ntowards universality by welcoming a new Member \r\nState — Montenegro, with which Algeria has been \r\ninvolved in multi-faceted cooperation — the very basis \r\nof our institution is once again being tested by the \r\ngrave developments in the situation in the Middle East, \r\nwith violence directed at our brother peoples of \r\nPalestine and Lebanon. Because of their context, their \r\nscope and the breadth of their consequences at various \r\nlevels, those acts of aggression — which cannot merely \r\nbe seen as passing occurrences — point an accusing \r\nfinger at the limitations imposed upon the authority of \r\nthe United Nations when it is faced with conflict \r\nsituations which run counter to its very raison d’être. \r\n In the vast areas of the developing world, in \r\nparticular throughout Muslim civilization, a silent \r\nfrustration is growing and increasing before the \r\npowerlessness of the United Nations to support the \r\nmost elementary human values of the Palestinian and \r\nLebanese people. \r\n The Middle East is without doubt the most \r\nunstable region of the world. There we see the great \r\ncruelty, flagrant denial of justice and recurrent waves \r\nof violence that are reflected in the serious \r\ndeterioration of the humanitarian and security \r\nsituation. This makes the prospect of establishing a just \r\nand lasting peace in the region a remote one. The \r\nPalestinian people are improperly subjected to \r\ncollective punishment, and Lebanon — whose \r\nsuffering is exemplified by the relentless Israeli attack \r\nagainst Qana — has been caught up in a murderous \r\nwar, in which the Lebanese people were able to hold at \r\nbay the infernal firepower and destructive capability \r\ndirected against it. \r\n In the same geopolitical sphere, lack of security \r\nand instability persist in Iraq. The daily ransom paid in \r\nheavy human losses is submerged in a pernicious effect \r\nof habit and trivialization. The establishment of the \r\nGovernment of National Unity, and that Government’s \r\ndecision to opt for inclusive national reconciliation are \r\nfirst steps in the right direction. Algeria welcomes the \r\npositive response to those developments from the main \r\npolitical forces in Iraq, and we believe that the best \r\nway to ensure the success of the ongoing political \r\nprocess — with its objective of allowing Iraq to fully \r\nrecover its sovereignty in the framework of national \r\nunity and territorial integrity — would be through \r\nintensified efforts to avoid further fratricidal schism in \r\nthe country along ethnic and religious fault lines. \r\n One year ago, at the World Summit, we defined a \r\npath together towards comprehensive reform of the \r\nUnited Nations. By joining the consensus on adoption \r\nof a series of specific reform measures, the non-aligned \r\ncountries hoped to contribute to the transformation of \r\nthe United Nations into an instrument capable of \r\n A/61/PV.18\r\n \r\n23 06-53329 \r\n \r\naddressing the new challenges and threats confronting \r\nthe international community. \r\n First of all, we have seen the creation of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, an innovative institutional \r\nmechanism that has long been lacking in the \r\nOrganization. We saw also the establishment of the \r\nHuman Rights Council, which also marks progress for \r\nthe international community as it seeks to achieve \r\nuniversal respect for all human rights. However, a great \r\ndeal remains to be done in order to attain the objectives \r\nwhich have been set in the reform process.  \r\n Thus, it is important that we strengthen our \r\nefforts in order to succeed at this session in achieving \r\ncomprehensive agreement on pending issues, in \r\nparticular reform of the Security Council. Through \r\nsuch comprehensive reform, the Security Council \r\nshould become more representative in its membership, \r\nmore democratic and more transparent in its \r\nfunctioning and more in harmony with the positions of \r\nthe General Assembly, in order to provide greater \r\nlegitimacy to its decisions and to enhance its \r\neffectiveness. \r\n The peoples of the United Nations had hoped that \r\nthe celebration of the Organization’s sixtieth \r\nanniversary would return us to the principles and \r\npurposes of the Charter, and enable us to re-draw the \r\nplans it outlined. But today’s world is full of \r\nuncertainty and too many problems still weigh upon it. \r\nIt is confronted with more threats than ever — all of \r\nthem equally dangerous — which must be addressed in \r\na consistent manner in order to better determine their \r\nroot causes and thus to enable the international \r\ncommunity to act with determination to eliminate them \r\nfor good.  \r\n That is true for terrorism, which continues to \r\nstrike communities with its well-known horror and \r\ncruelty and without distinction as to race, sex or \r\nreligion. The fight against that scourge, from which no \r\ncountry is safe, requires unified cooperation at both the \r\nregional and international level, using clear and \r\ncomplementary approaches. \r\n Algeria, which has long suffered from terrorist \r\nviolence — to which some have reacted with \r\nindifference and others with complacency — can only \r\nwelcome the fact that the international community has \r\nbecome aware of the seriousness of the threat of \r\nterrorism upon international peace and security. It \r\nstresses the urgency of concluding a comprehensive \r\nconvention against international terrorism, which \r\nshould contain an unequivocal definition of that \r\nscourge and draw a distinction between the legitimate \r\nstruggle of peoples against foreign occupation, on the \r\none hand, and on the other, acts perpetrated by terrorist \r\ngroups or individuals, and which would be careful not \r\nto confuse that scourge with any particular religion, \r\ncivilization or geographic area. \r\n I would like to reiterate our legitimate concern as \r\nwe are faced with the deadlock of the multilateral \r\ndisarmament process, and the disagreement that has \r\nemerged, here and there, on the issue of the non-\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The goal \r\nhas remained the same. Disarmament must be overall \r\nand complete and under effective international control. \r\nThe policy of nuclear non-proliferation must be \r\npursued in both its horizontal and vertical dimensions \r\nand those countries that have voluntarily given up the \r\nmilitary nuclear option have the right to expect security \r\nguarantees and free access without discrimination to \r\nnuclear technology for peaceful uses. \r\n In the Western Sahara, the last territory which \r\nmust be decolonized in Africa, the Saharan people \r\nremain deprived of their inalienable right to self-\r\ndetermination, as enshrined in the Charter and relevant \r\nUnited Nations resolutions. Just as in 1991 with the \r\nadoption of the Settlement Plan, in 2003 the \r\ninternational community, after the unanimous adoption \r\nby the Security Council of the peace plan proposed by \r\nMr. James Baker, former Personal Envoy of the \r\nSecretary-General for Western Sahara, the United \r\nNations had the hope of seeing a just and lasting \r\nsettlement to the conflict. But today we must note that \r\nno positive evolution of that conflict has taken place, \r\nbecause of the rejection of the peace plan by one of the \r\ntwo parties to the conflict and its desire to prejudge to \r\nits advantage, the final status of the territory — a status \r\nwhich can only be determined through a referendum on \r\nself-determination. \r\n Algeria, which has no claims whatsoever on that \r\nterritory and is not in any way involved in the \r\nconflict — which has only two parties as designated by \r\nthe international community, namely, the Kingdom of \r\nMorocco and the Polisario Front — has taken note of \r\nthe unanimous adoption by the Security Council of \r\nresolution 1675 (2006), which reaffirms the right to \r\nself-determination of the Saharan people. Deeply \r\nrespectful of the “Declaration on the Granting of \r\nIndependence to Colonial Countries and Peoples” as \r\nA/61/PV.18  \r\n \r\n06-53329 24 \r\n \r\ncontained in General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) \r\nof 14 December 1960, Algeria will continue to support \r\nall efforts designed to enable the Saharan people to \r\nexercise their right to self-determination with full \r\nsovereignty in conditions that are incontestably free \r\nand transparent. \r\n In another area, the outcome of the seventh \r\nAfrican Union Summit in Banjul shows a mixed record \r\nconcerning the development of various crises and other \r\nconflicts situations on the continent, in particular in the \r\nCôte d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \r\nthe Sudan and Somalia. Serious efforts are being \r\ndeployed in order to promote interaction between the \r\nUnited Nations and the African Union, in order to \r\neffectively deal with those situations, which have often \r\nshown themselves to be complicated and difficult.  \r\n What is more important — a culture of peace is \r\ndeveloping throughout Africa as a result of a renewal \r\nand recovery, the foundations of which were \r\nestablished by African leaders of the region through the \r\ncreation of the African Union and the New Partnership \r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD).  \r\n In that light, it is extremely important to insure \r\nthat the peaceful settlement of the crisis in Darfur, with \r\nfull respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity \r\nof the Sudan and in keeping with the Abuja accord, \r\nmove hand in hand with harmonious action based on \r\nthe good will of all, in particular of the African Union \r\nand the United Nations. \r\n The question of development is, rightly, one of \r\nthe highest priorities of the United Nations agenda, in \r\nparticular following the adoption in September 2000 of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). So, too is \r\nthe eradication of poverty, which weighs heavily upon \r\nthe conscience of mankind. However, the gap that \r\nexists to date between the goals and the progress \r\nachieved is such that decisive efforts are essential in \r\norder to insure that Africa will achieve its goals by the \r\nyear 2015. Similar great efforts are required from the \r\ndeveloped countries to honour their commitments \r\nundertaken at the time of the Millennium Summit,  \r\nthe International Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment held in Monterrey, as well as the 2005 \r\nWorld Summit. \r\n At the time of the sixtieth anniversary of the \r\ncreation of the Organization, all of us realized that the \r\nworld had profoundly changed and that it was \r\nnecessary to adjust our activities to the new realities. \r\nFaced with the many challenges and structural threats \r\nof our time, the 2005 World Summit gave us a clear \r\ndiagnosis and prescribed the necessary remedies. One \r\nyear later — the state of the world today further \r\nstresses how acute the problems are and the urgency of \r\nsolving them. It makes it crystal clear that it would be \r\npointless to dwell on the uncertainties and imbalances, \r\nas well as the precarious situations that have become \r\nan inextricable part of the fabric of international \r\nsociety, unless we want to doom that society to chronic \r\ninstability and insecurity. \r\n Truthfully, the imperfect achievements and \r\nlimited gains made by the international community, at \r\na time when globalization has greatly shrunk both time \r\nand space, demand of us that we view the future with \r\ngenuine resolve, concerning what has to be done, rather \r\nthan resign ourselves to what merely appears possible. \r\nIn that connection, there is no alternative to a truly \r\ndemocratic reform of the United Nations that includes \r\nthe participation of all countries. There is no viable \r\noption other than a globalization based upon peace and \r\nprosperity that benefits all of humankind. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on Mr. Dimitrij \r\nRupel, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Slovenia. \r\n Mr. Rupel (Slovenia): Let me first congratulate \r\nMs. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa on her election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly. We believe that \r\nunder her guidance we will continue the reform process \r\nlaid out in the 2005 World Summit Outcome \r\n(resolution 60/1). Our warm appreciation also goes to \r\nMr. Jan Eliasson, President at the sixtieth session, for \r\nhis inspiring leadership. \r\n Let me take the opportunity to thank the \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his brilliant \r\nopening speech a few days ago (see A/61/PV.3), and \r\nfor his decade of dedicated work for the United \r\nNations. Slovenia appreciates the role of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in helping to expand our understanding of \r\npressing issues, such as the protection of civilians and \r\nthe responsibility to protect. The commitment of the \r\nSecretary-General to mainstreaming human rights in \r\nthe work of the Organization and his emphasis on the \r\nrule of law in international relations and nationally will \r\nremain a permanent legacy. The report “In larger \r\nfreedom” (A/59/2005) contains a fair vision of the \r\nglobal responsibility that we share and reminds us of \r\nthe inevitable challenges that lie ahead. \r\n A/61/PV.18\r\n \r\n25 06-53329 \r\n \r\n We live in a tightly interconnected, \r\ninterdependent and transparent world. It is logical and \r\nit is right that nations should support and help each \r\nother. What place in the world is more appropriate for \r\nthat recommendation than the United Nations? All \r\nnations and all people should be asking themselves \r\nhow they can help each other. It appears that assistance \r\nand contributions from affluent countries are more \r\neffective. It seems easier for large nations to be great \r\nnations. Unfortunately, not all nations are large. That is \r\ntrue of most nations of the world, and it is, of course, \r\ntrue of my country. \r\n The implementation of the global partnership for \r\ndevelopment is a priority of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) to which Slovenia is fully \r\ncommitted. The new external financial instruments of \r\nthe European Union as well as the tenth European \r\nDevelopment Fund open a new chapter in the relations \r\nof the European Union with developing countries and \r\nstrengthen Europe’s role as a global partner in \r\ndevelopment. That is a promising sign of progress in \r\nthe fulfilment of our commitments under the \r\nMillennium Declaration. \r\n In order to contribute in an important way, the \r\nsmall countries must make a special effort. We can, in \r\nfact, be effective. Smaller countries rarely threaten or \r\nendanger other countries. They have knowledge of \r\nsmall systems and knowledge of minorities within \r\nlarge systems. They can perform special tasks that \r\ndemand special qualities and particular capabilities \r\nsuch as flexibility, adaptability, a spirit of empathy and \r\ncooperation. They can serve as honest brokers. There \r\nare a number of successful small and medium-sized \r\ncountries. They can help each other to assume creative \r\nand relevant positions as part of the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n At the United Nations, we should continue to \r\nreview the concept of sovereignty. Many fear that the \r\nerosion of sovereignty provides grounds for interfering \r\nin State internal affairs. Indeed, the potential for \r\nmisuse is real. History teaches us that checks and \r\nbalances are necessary in order to shield right against \r\nmight. At the same time, the sovereignty of States must \r\nbe understood in the context of contemporary reality. \r\nNational borders are no longer an excuse for the \r\ninternational community to turn a blind eye to \r\ngenocide, crimes against humanity and other gross \r\nhuman rights violations. \r\n Last year, for the first time world leaders \r\nformally and universally affirmed the concept of the \r\nresponsibility to protect. The 2005 World Summit \r\nOutcome (resolution 60/1) provides a detailed \r\nframework for individual and collective responsibility, \r\nin areas ranging from prevention and protection to \r\nrebuilding. We regard the framework as a conceptual \r\nbreakthrough and wish to stress the need for all \r\nmembers of the international community, and the \r\nSecurity Council in particular, to deliver on the \r\nimplementation of that responsibility in practice. \r\n Many crises are evolving as we speak, some of \r\nwhich the international community will try to resolve, \r\nwhile giving less attention to others. The suffering of \r\nthe civilian population in Darfur calls for our \r\nimmediate efforts. We should not allow the tragedy that \r\noccurred in Rwanda or Bosnia and Herzegovina to be \r\nrepeated in Darfur or anywhere else. \r\n Attention to the Western Balkans must not \r\ndiminish. We are committed to standing by our partners \r\nin the region in their endeavours to expand their \r\nrelationship with the European Union and to facilitate \r\nthe advent of prosperity for their citizens. Kosovo is \r\nnow approaching an important and possibly sui generis \r\nstage in the peace process. Finding common ground \r\nbetween Serbian and Kosovar Albanian positions and \r\nstriking a political deal will be difficult. We are \r\nconfident, nevertheless, that all those involved will \r\nsummon up sufficient courage to take a critical step \r\nforward and thus enable all ethnic groups in that region \r\nto coexist peacefully and cooperate. We hope that the \r\nintegration process in Europe will provide the \r\nappropriate vehicle for the stabilization of the region. \r\n The disintegration of rigid systems like those of \r\nthe Soviet Union and the former Yugoslavia has \r\nproduced a number of new States and new Members of \r\nthe United Nations. The process has sometimes been \r\ncalled Balkanization. But a closer look will reveal that \r\nmany of the newborn countries, contrary to \r\nexpectations, have not regressed. Quite the opposite: a \r\nlot of them have progressed, democratized and \r\nreintegrated, or have expressed the desire to integrate \r\nin a different way and have positioned themselves on a \r\nnew level. Many former republics of the Soviet Union \r\nand Yugoslavia have thus become, or intend to become, \r\nmembers of new multinational systems, such as the \r\nEuropean Union. \r\nA/61/PV.18  \r\n \r\n06-53329 26 \r\n \r\n Occasionally, we still hear expressions of \r\nhesitation and fear: we should not, they say, sacrifice \r\nour national interests for the sake of integration. One \r\nof the problems of the international community today \r\nis complex relations within multinational, multi-ethnic \r\nand multicultural systems. The question is how to \r\nfacilitate the productive coexistence of national, ethnic, \r\nreligious and other minorities.  \r\n In the past, in Europe and elsewhere, mighty \r\ndynasties or nations, driven by the ambition to rule \r\nover weaker nations and minorities, practised imposed \r\nintegration. Modern integration no longer rests on \r\nsubordination; it depends on solidarity and \r\ncooperation. Modern nations cultivate \r\ncomplementarity. In the future, the United Nations \r\nshould encourage new projects and provide an efficient \r\nframework for the management of religious diversity \r\nand dialogue between cultures. We could then learn \r\nfrom countries that had experienced a successful \r\ntransition from a central and autocratic system to a \r\ndecentralized and democratic system. Essentially, we \r\nare concerned with sustained assistance in the \r\ntransition to democracy and coexistence within multi-\r\nethnic or multicultural systems. \r\n I support the idea of the dialogue of cultures. \r\nHowever, we should be careful not to develop that \r\nconcept into a clearinghouse for one set of standards. If \r\nso, failure is a certainty. A dialogue between two sides \r\neach convinced of the absolute truth of its own \r\nexistence is impossible. When dealing with subjective \r\nor intimate concepts like faith, respect and individual \r\ndignity, we can only hope to encourage debate within \r\nindividual systems, not between them. In the latter \r\ncase, one would be imposing one’s truth on the value \r\nsystem of another. \r\n Rather, a dialogue of cultures should be a venue \r\nfor cross-cultural discussion on objective matters like \r\ndemocratic political systems, sustainable development, \r\nsecurity and energy. The promotion of dialogue on \r\nmatters of faith, culture or civilization is an \r\nindispensable tool to create bridges between different \r\ncultures.  \r\n Is there a general clash of civilizations? My own \r\nanswer is “no”. On the other hand, we should not \r\nunderestimate local and temporary clashes that may \r\nserve purposes far from genuine cultural or religious \r\nissues. There is one welcome and necessary clash: the \r\nclash of our common and global civilization against \r\nillegitimate radical groups that strive for power by \r\nmeans of terror and that abuse religious beliefs and \r\nethnic bonds for their own particular agendas. We have \r\nto be aware of this when dealing with such issues in \r\nour own countries and stand ready to assist each other \r\nif we are to preserve the universal values of \r\ncivilization. \r\n Last year, Slovenia chaired the Organization for \r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe; today, we begin \r\nour year at the helm of the Board of Governors of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, and a little more \r\nthan a year from now we shall assume the presidency \r\nof the European Union (EU). As a member, and current \r\nChair, of the Human Security Network, a group of \r\nnations with diverse regional affiliations, we are \r\nlooking forward to deepening the understanding of the \r\nconcept of human security in order to be better \r\nequipped to overcome the complex problems of the \r\nmodern world. \r\n One of the items on the agenda of the Slovenian \r\nEU presidency will certainly be energy security. To \r\nfacilitate insight into regional energy and stability \r\nissues, the international conference entitled Caspian \r\nOutlook 2008, recently organized in Slovenia under the \r\nauspices of the Bled Strategic Forum, offered an \r\ninteresting experience in terms of how such issues can \r\nbe addressed at the regional level by parties that share \r\nthe same concern but look at it from different \r\nperspectives. At the end of the day, all interested \r\npartners have much to gain from political stability, \r\nreliable flows of energy and stronger partnerships. \r\n The Middle East crisis once again calls for the \r\nfocused attention of the international community. \r\nAttempts to address this problem in all its complexity \r\nand with the involvement of many countries should \r\ncontinue with renewed energy. Slovenia is playing its \r\npart in contributing to the immediate relief of the \r\nsituation in Lebanon through its contribution of troops \r\nto the United Nations peacekeeping force there. \r\n Slovenia welcomes the progress made towards \r\nthe implementation of the Convention on the \r\nProhibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and \r\nTransfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their \r\nDestruction. However, there are some aspects of mine \r\naction on which we should continue to focus: dealing \r\nwith the universality of the Convention, the clearing of \r\nminefields and providing assistance to mine victims. \r\nThrough its International Trust Fund for Demining and \r\n A/61/PV.18\r\n \r\n27 06-53329 \r\n \r\nMine Victims Assistance, Slovenia is striving to \r\nalleviate the humanitarian threat that anti-personnel \r\nlandmines still pose to the safety, health and lives of \r\nlocal civilian populations. \r\n I am grateful for the opportunity to highlight, in \r\nfront of this distinguished audience, the importance of \r\nthe role of small countries. Their orientations, activities \r\nand possibilities can contribute significantly to \r\nmultilateralism.  \r\n The Acting President: I now call on Her \r\nExcellency Ms. Kinga Göncz, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Republic of Hungary.  \r\n Ms. Göncz (Hungary): I first congratulate Her \r\nExcellency Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa on her \r\nelection as the third female President of the General \r\nAssembly. I firmly believe that the involvement of \r\nwomen in the decision-making processes at the \r\nnational and international levels can contribute to the \r\nbetter management of today’s global problems. In \r\nfulfilling her challenging tasks during the sixty-first \r\nsession, the President may rest assured of the support \r\nand cooperation of the representatives of the Republic \r\nof Hungary. I also wish to salute her predecessor, \r\nAmbassador Jan Eliasson, who served us with \r\ndistinction, dedication, an innovative spirit and a good \r\nsense of humour. He made great efforts and \r\nachievements to advance the reform of the United \r\nNations. \r\n During the 2005 World Summit, our heads of \r\nState or Government agreed to proposals with the \r\npotential to adapt the world Organization to the \r\nrealities of our contemporary world. While we have \r\naccomplished only modest reforms so far, we should \r\nremind ourselves that United Nations reform is more a \r\nprocess than a single event. \r\n In order to foster public confidence in the United \r\nNations, we must agree on substantial management \r\nreform, with greater accountability and transparency \r\nand better allocation of resources. The reform process \r\nshould include all the main bodies of this Organization, \r\nincluding the General Assembly, which, in our view, \r\nmust remain the most important deliberative body of \r\nthe Organization. \r\n Hungary supports the expansion of the Security \r\nCouncil in both the permanent and non-permanent \r\ncategories to better reflect the political realities of \r\ntoday. However, new approaches need to be identified \r\nto facilitate the emergence of a compromise. The \r\nenlargement of the Council should be combined with \r\nenhanced efficiency and improved working methods. \r\n Hungary condemns all forms of terrorism, which \r\ngive rise to fear and distrust in our daily lives. It is our \r\nfirm conviction that the United Nations should remain \r\na key player in the international fight against the \r\nscourge of terror. It is therefore natural that Hungary \r\nwelcomes the recent adoption of the new United \r\nNations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution \r\n60/288) and looks forward to the elaboration of a \r\ncomprehensive convention on terrorism by the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n The establishment of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission was one of our top priorities. We believe \r\nthat the Commission is well equipped to deal with \r\nfragile post-conflict situations. \r\n With the establishment of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, the international community has opened a \r\nwhole new chapter in its joint efforts to protect human \r\nrights. My Government has wholeheartedly supported \r\nthis ambitious project from the outset. We sincerely \r\nhope that with the completion of the Council’s first \r\nyear of existence, adequate machinery will be put in \r\nplace to address the challenges of the twenty-first \r\ncentury. The universal periodic review is one of the \r\ninitiatives on the Council’s agenda and holds the \r\npromise of making a real difference. The full and \r\nunhindered participation of non-governmental \r\norganizations in the activities of the Council is also of \r\nvital importance for us. \r\n Protection of minority rights, including those of \r\nnational minorities, is a pivotal element of Hungary’s \r\nhuman rights policies. The turbulent history of our \r\nregion has all too often demonstrated the potential of \r\ninter-ethnic tensions to trigger crisis situations. \r\nConflicts based on ethnicity, both past and present, \r\nmust remind us all that multi-ethnic societies are in \r\ndesperate need of a sensitive and careful approach to \r\nminority issues, sound legal arrangements, generosity \r\nin practice and firmly embedded institutional \r\nguarantees, safeguarding the rights of minorities. \r\n The interdependence of democracy and human \r\nrights is clearly demonstrated in countries and regions \r\nwith a deficit of democratic practices. As the late \r\nSergio Vieira de Mello, former High Commissioner for \r\nHuman Rights, stated so eloquently, “Imperfect as the \r\nship of democracy may be, no other vessel has proved \r\nA/61/PV.18  \r\n \r\n06-53329 28 \r\n \r\nas seaworthy in bringing us safely to the shores of \r\nhuman dignity”. \r\n Driven by the policy objective of promoting \r\ndemocracy, the Government of Hungary launched the \r\nInternational Centre for Democratic Transition last \r\nyear in Budapest. The Centre intends to provide \r\nguidance regarding transition in a supportive manner \r\nby collecting experience from past democratic \r\ntransitions and sharing it with those determined to \r\nfollow that path. Hungary fully supported the \r\nSecretary-General’s decision to establish the United \r\nNations Democracy Fund. Being a member of the \r\nAdvisory Board and a contributor to the Fund, we are \r\npleased to recognize that the projects approved by the \r\nFund properly reflect local, regional and global \r\ndemands. \r\n Fifty years have passed since the citizens of \r\nHungary rose up against a brutal dictatorship, \r\ndemanding democracy, human rights and dignity. The \r\ntotalitarian regime crushed the dreams of the \r\nHungarian revolution and took cruel revenge during its \r\nreturn to power on top of foreign tanks. \r\n The spirit of 1956, however, was not to be \r\ndefeated. Fifty years ago, the Hungarian revolution \r\nbegan with a peaceful demonstration to show solidarity \r\nwith the Polish nation. Today, I am proud to confirm \r\nthat Hungary will show solidarity with every nation \r\nthat seeks freedom and democracy for its people. \r\n It is my moral obligation to express our profound \r\nrespect for the activities of the dedicated politicians \r\nand diplomats who kept the so-called Hungarian \r\nquestion on the agenda of the world Organization for \r\nseveral years. Hungary will never forget the devotion \r\nof Povl Bang-Jensen, the Danish United Nations \r\nofficer who served as Secretary of the United Nations \r\nCommittee entrusted with the examination of the \r\nHungarian events of 1956. His efforts and sacrifice \r\nmade for the sake of the Hungarian revolution are \r\netched on our collective memory forever. \r\n The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \r\nand their delivery systems constitutes a major threat to \r\ninternational peace and security. The most important \r\nchallenge faced by the international community in this \r\ncontext is non-compliance with the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). My \r\nGovernment sincerely hopes that the next NPT review \r\ncycle will ultimately bring tangible results, and it urges \r\nall nations to make genuine contributions to that effect. \r\n Working out lasting solutions for unresolved \r\nissues relating to the western Balkans is of paramount \r\nimportance for peace and stability in the European \r\ncontinent. Hungary is convinced that the success of the \r\nstatus talks in Kosovo will depend on the ability of the \r\nparties to build mutually acceptable arrangements, \r\nwhich, in turn, will require a proper time frame. A \r\nfunctioning multicultural society in Kosovo is \r\ninseparable from the sincere implementation of \r\nstandards, respect for minority rights and effective \r\ndecentralization, all of which are essential \r\npreconditions for the successful outcome of the status \r\ntalks. \r\n Hungary is fully committed to a just and lasting \r\npeace in the Middle East. It is essential to revitalize the \r\npeace process on the basis of the Road Map and other \r\nagreements accepted by the parties concerned. Israel \r\nhas the right to live in peace and security, and the \r\nPalestinians have the right to an independent and \r\nviable Palestinian State peacefully coexisting with its \r\nneighbours. \r\n Peace and stability in Lebanon are vitally \r\nimportant for the entire Middle East. The international \r\ncommunity, along with the parties concerned, must \r\nmake every effort to ensure the swift and full \r\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 1701 \r\n(2006). \r\n The Republic of Hungary is strongly committed \r\nto building a peaceful and stable Afghanistan. Our \r\nresolve has been manifested by my Government’s \r\nrecent decision to take over the leadership of the \r\nProvincial Reconstruction Team in Baghlan province. \r\nAlthough major efforts are being undertaken by the \r\ninternational community to assist in the reconstruction \r\nprocess in Afghanistan, the primary responsibility for \r\nthe stabilization and development of the country lies \r\nwith the Afghan people themselves. \r\n Hungary remains gravely concerned about the \r\nprolonged and dramatic security situation in Iraq. We \r\nwelcome the resolve of the Iraqi Government to engage \r\nall communities in order to achieve reconciliation and \r\nstrengthen national cohesion. I would like to reiterate \r\nHungary’s continued commitment to assisting the \r\npeople of Iraq in their endeavour to build a free and \r\nprosperous country. \r\n The deteriorating situation in Darfur is another \r\nmatter of grave concern. The Government of the Sudan \r\nshould agree to the swift deployment of a United \r\n A/61/PV.18\r\n \r\n29 06-53329 \r\n \r\nNations peacekeeping force with a mission to halt the \r\nunfolding humanitarian catastrophe. In this regard, \r\nHungary also hopes that at this session the General \r\nAssembly will make advances in the elaboration of the \r\nimportant concept of the responsibility to protect. \r\n Six years ago, the Governments of the world \r\nmade a solemn pledge to strive to eliminate global \r\npoverty by signing the Millennium Declaration \r\n(resolution 55/2). A great deal remains to be done to \r\nachieve the objectives set out in the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, in developing countries, by the \r\ndonor community and here at the United Nations. We \r\nneed to make sure that development, in rich and poor \r\ncountries alike, is sustainable. As a new EU member, \r\nHungary is gradually increasing its official \r\ndevelopment assistance and recognizes the special \r\ndevelopment needs of the world’s poorest regions. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to thank and \r\ncommend the outgoing Secretary-General for his \r\ntireless efforts during the past 10 years, often under \r\ndifficult and challenging circumstances, to promote the \r\nprinciples of the Charter. His devotion, diplomatic \r\nskills and vision have earned him profound respect all \r\nover the world. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency The Honourable Michael Frendo, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Malta. \r\n Mr. Frendo (Malta): I would like to congratulate \r\nMs. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa on her election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \r\nsession. I am confident that her efforts will ensure a \r\nsuccessful outcome of this session. I would also like to \r\ntake this opportunity to thank the outgoing President, \r\nHis Excellency Jan Eliasson, with whom the Assembly \r\nworked over the past 12 months on the successful \r\nimplementation of many of the major reform tasks \r\nagreed upon at the Summit last year. \r\n The theme chosen by the President for this year’s \r\nsession — “Implementing a global partnership for \r\ndevelopment” — strikes at the heart of the challenges \r\nfacing mankind today. It also reflects the Summit’s \r\nemphasis on the interlinked and mutually reinforcing \r\nnature of development, peace and security and human \r\nrights. Sustainable development in the economic, \r\nsocial and environmental sphere constitutes a key \r\nelement of the overarching framework of United \r\nNations activities. We support that approach and, \r\nconvinced of the ripple effect of development policies \r\nthat benefit all mankind, urge the General Assembly to \r\nincrease its focus on development issues. \r\n Poverty eradication and the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) are the \r\npriorities for this decade. In this regard, the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals Report 2006 indicates that certain \r\nregions of the world have made much less progress \r\nthan others. Extreme poverty remains a daily reality for \r\nthe more than 1 billion people who subsist on less than \r\none dollar a day. Whereas Asia leads the way in \r\nreducing poverty rates, the number of poor people in \r\nAfrica is rising. In terms of per capita income, 18 of \r\nthe 20 poorest countries in the world are in Africa. \r\nSub-Saharan Africa has the highest poverty rate in the \r\nworld, and the situation of chronic food insecurity has \r\nnot improved over the past decade. Four fifths of \r\narmed conflicts occur in Africa and Asia. Clearly, there \r\ncan be no development without security and no \r\nsecurity without development. \r\n The realities of poverty, conflict and insecurity \r\nare at the root of the phenomenon of mass migration \r\nfrom Africa to Europe along the major routes — into \r\nthe Canary Islands and mainland Spain in the eastern \r\nMediterranean, and into Malta and Italy in the central \r\nMediterranean. \r\n Lack of development, security and good \r\ngovernance has a direct effect on a country such as \r\nmine, which, with 1,200 persons per square kilometre, \r\nis already one of the most densely populated countries \r\nin the world. In addition, it is a small island State with \r\na small population of 400,000. \r\n The burden of underdevelopment and lack of \r\nsecurity in Africa, in particular sub-Saharan Africa, is \r\ntherefore inordinately borne by my country, which is \r\nsuffering real hardship as thousands of illegal migrants \r\nreach our shores. The 2005 statistics of the Office of \r\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \r\n(UNHCR) rank Malta as the country with the second-\r\nhighest number of asylum applications, in contrast to a \r\n15.6 per cent decrease in asylum applications across \r\nthe rest of the European Union. \r\n We urge the United Nations and its agencies to \r\naddress the issue of mass illegal immigration \r\nholistically and with vigour and urgency. In that \r\nendeavour, all the countries of world are called upon to \r\ncombat criminal organizations that, across frontiers, \r\nare taking advantage of the aspirations of human \r\nbeings who have nearly lost all hope. The rule of law \r\nA/61/PV.18  \r\n \r\n06-53329 30 \r\n \r\nmust be respected. International obligations undertaken \r\nby countries in accordance with public international \r\nlaw must be honoured. Ignoring or insufficiently \r\naddressing the phenomenon of illegal immigration puts \r\nat risk the hard-won rights of genuine refugees and \r\npersons who must be protected with humanitarian \r\nstatus under international law. \r\n I therefore call on the General Assembly and the \r\nUnited Nations as a whole — but in particular the \r\nUNHCR — to lend their full support to those countries \r\nthat, like Malta, have an inherent fragility arising from \r\ndensity of population and smallness of territorial size \r\nin their efforts to combat illegal immigration and \r\naddress the hardships that they experience as countries \r\nof destination. \r\n Malta needs support — including from the \r\nUNHCR — in the resettlement of refugees and persons \r\nwith humanitarian status. It needs support in \r\nshouldering the financial burden that it assumes in \r\nproviding for the basic needs of the illegal immigrants \r\non its soil. It needs international support in combating \r\nthe criminal organizations that are benefiting \r\nfinancially from illegal immigration while putting the \r\nlives of immigrants at risk. \r\n No country can tackle such an overwhelming \r\nphenomenon on its own. Illegal immigration requires a \r\nholistic international approach that includes combating \r\ncriminal organizations — particularly in the countries \r\nof origin and transit — and strengthening border \r\ncontrol; promoting good governance, economic \r\ndevelopment and the rule of law; resettling refugees \r\nand persons with humanitarian status; and returning \r\nillegal immigrants to their countries of origin and \r\ntransit and reintegrating them into society. As part of \r\nsuch a holistic approach, we must take into \r\nconsideration the special characteristics of a number of \r\nparticularly vulnerable countries on the routes of \r\nmigration between Africa and Europe, which, as \r\ncountries of destination, are carrying a burden far \r\ngreater than they can bear. \r\n This issue was also examined in detail during the \r\nHigh-level Dialogue on International Migration and \r\nDevelopment, which took place last week. Malta, \r\nwhich took an active part in the Dialogue, looks \r\nforward to greater engagement on the part of countries \r\nof origin, transit and destination. In particular, we look \r\nforward to the high-level conference on migration of \r\nthe European Union and the African Union, scheduled \r\nto be held in Tripoli, Libya, before the end of this year. \r\nSuch engagement, which should have the active \r\nsupport of international organizations operating in this \r\nfield, would continue the process of “trialogue”, which \r\nwas successfully undertaken at the Rabat Conference \r\nlast July. It could also serve as effective follow-up to \r\nthe recent United Nations Dialogue. \r\n In focusing on development issues, we must \r\nemphasize that development needs to be sustainable, to \r\nrespect the environment and to take into account the \r\nrights of future generations, children, young people and \r\nthose yet unborn. Development does not mean a free-\r\nfor-all attitude towards the exploitation of the Earth’s \r\nbountiful resources. There must be sustainable \r\ndevelopment that allows our forests to regenerate, our \r\nair to be pure and our seas to be free of pollution. \r\n Climate change and global warming are not \r\nissues that can be relegated to intellectual exercises. \r\nPositive political action is required to address the \r\nproblems related to global warming and to prevent an \r\nexacerbation of the consequences of lack of care for \r\nthe environment. As a number of dramatic experiences \r\nhave already shown, the consequences of lack of \r\nrespect for the planet and its environmental balances \r\nhave been borne in particular by the world’s poor, \r\nwhether in developing or developed economies. A \r\nconcerted effort by all mankind is therefore required in \r\nthis area. The United Nations is the appropriate forum \r\nfor addressing these issues, which affect all countries. \r\nThe fragility of our planet and its ecosystem means that \r\nall of us have a greater responsibility to act rapidly and \r\ntogether. \r\n A global partnership for development needs to be \r\ncarried out in peace and stability. However, in today’s \r\nworld, global peace and security are constantly \r\nthreatened by destructive and violent events. In that \r\nregard, we must pay particular attention to the \r\nprolonged impasse that has thwarted the work of the \r\nConference on Disarmament. That impasse is \r\nendangering the very multilateral mechanisms that \r\nwere created to foster peace, security and cooperation. \r\nStates members of the Conference have a grave \r\nresponsibility towards all United Nations Member \r\nStates in helping humanity to address the challenges of \r\nnon-proliferation, disarmament and arms control. As \r\nthe Secretary-General stated in his address to the \r\nConference on Disarmament last June, “With political \r\nwill, this Conference can reclaim its former mantle and \r\ngenerate tangible benefits that could shape the course \r\n A/61/PV.18\r\n \r\n31 06-53329 \r\n \r\nof history” (CD/PV.1028, p. 5). That is a challenge for \r\nus all. \r\n Another challenge for us all is to persevere in all \r\nour efforts to resolve conflicts, even if they seem to \r\npersist over long periods of time and regardless of the \r\nnumber of peace initiatives undertaken by the \r\ninternational community. \r\n The recent conflict in Lebanon was a tragic \r\nreminder of how easily a population can slide quickly \r\nback into a conflict situation. Today, the clouds have \r\nlifted a little so that new rays of hope can break \r\nthrough. We wish that country well. We believe that it \r\ncould serve as a unique laboratory for democratic and \r\ncultural pluralism within a peaceful society in the \r\nMiddle East. \r\n In the same region, a resolution of the Israeli-\r\nPalestinian conflict remains elusive. Fatalism is not an \r\noption. The international community, through the \r\nUnited Nations and other mechanisms such as the \r\nQuartet, must maintain its concerted and determined \r\nefforts to find a comprehensive, just and lasting \r\nsolution to this long-festering conflict, which has a \r\nbearing on all other issues in the Middle East and, \r\nindeed, in the wider global context. We welcome the \r\nintense and frank debate that took place last week in \r\nthe Security Council on this issue (see S/PV.5530). \r\n The President returned to the Chair. \r\n Malta respects and supports the aspirations of the \r\nPalestinian people to nationhood and dignity, and in \r\nequal measure respects and supports the aspirations of \r\nthe Israeli people to live in peace within secure \r\nborders. Those two aspirations are mutually compatible \r\nand achievable through peaceful and just means. A \r\nsolution can be achieved only through strict and \r\nabiding respect for the rules and norms of international \r\nlaw, including humanitarian law. \r\n On the ground, the continuing and increasingly \r\ndeteriorating humanitarian situation of the Palestinian \r\npeople is an intolerable burden on the international \r\nconscience. We must acknowledge and applaud the \r\nsterling work being carried out by the Commissioner-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations Relief and Works \r\nAgency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East \r\n(UNRWA), Ms. Karen AbuZayd, and all of the \r\nAgency’s dedicated staff to assist the refugee \r\npopulation in no fewer than 58 refugee camps in Gaza, \r\nthe West Bank, Lebanon, Syria and Jordan, where one \r\nthird of Palestinian refugees live. \r\n The international community needs to continue to \r\nstrengthen its tools for addressing natural emergencies \r\nwherever in the world they occur, in a spirit of \r\nsolidarity with nations and human beings. In that \r\nregard, the decision taken earlier this year — as a \r\nfollow-up to the Summit — on the revitalization and \r\nupgrading of the Central Emergency Revolving \r\nFund — now the Central Emergency Response Fund — \r\nis an important step forward. In that context, the role of \r\nthe United Nations Office for the Coordination of \r\nHumanitarian Affairs, under the able leadership of \r\nUnder-Secretary-General Jan Egeland, continues to be \r\na crucial mechanism for dealing with the coordination \r\nneeded to strengthen humanitarian responses to natural \r\ndisasters and complex emergencies. \r\n The tragic experience of the December 2004 \r\nIndian Ocean earthquake and tsunami galvanized \r\nefforts to plot the outlines of an international early \r\nwarning system across all oceans. That experience and \r\nits aftermath, however, show that much still remains to \r\nbe done to respond more rapidly, efficiently and \r\neffectively to natural disasters and other humanitarian \r\nemergencies. \r\n In this context, I note with great interest the \r\nvaluable work done to date by the Intergovernmental \r\nOceanographic Commission’s Intergovernmental \r\nCoordination Group for the Tsunami Early Warning \r\nand Mitigation System in the North-Eastern Atlantic, \r\nthe Mediterranean and Connected Seas. Located at the \r\ncentre of the Mediterranean and fully aware of the \r\nhavoc that a tsunami could cause in the basin, Malta \r\ncalls for speeding up the implementation of a \r\nMediterranean tsunami early warning and mitigation \r\nsystem. This goal needs to be achieved as soon as \r\npossible. We are prepared to play a proactive role \r\ntogether with other States in the region in establishing \r\na fully functioning tsunami warning system. \r\n In such phenomena, not just regional but full \r\nglobal coverage is essential to the success of the \r\nsystem. The Assembly should examine what needs to \r\nbe done to achieve this in the shortest time possible. In \r\nparticular, recent tsunami phenomena which were \r\nsmaller but which also claimed lives have shown that \r\nwhile it is important for countries to have early \r\nwarning systems that are interlinked, it is equally \r\ncrucial to transmit the early warning received by a \r\nA/61/PV.18  \r\n \r\n06-53329 32 \r\n \r\ncountry immediately to people on the beaches and in \r\nthe most vulnerable coastal areas and to have in place \r\ncrisis management mechanisms that can accelerate \r\nevacuation to safety. This requires the setting of \r\ninternational warning-transmission standards across the \r\nglobe, which, if effectively implemented, can save \r\nlives. \r\n Malta believes that this should be a joint task for \r\nthe international community as a whole and calls on \r\nthe international community to consider immediately \r\nthe best means to respond to tsunami experiences with \r\nappropriate legal and other instruments that address the \r\nneed for standards of transmission of early warnings to \r\npopulation in the most vulnerable areas in all the \r\ncountries of the world. The setting of international \r\nstandards for preparing for phenomena such as \r\ntsunamis can provide countries with an appropriate up-\r\nto-date measuring stick and continuously upgraded \r\npreparation. \r\n The international community needs \r\nmultilateralism. The process of institutional reform is \r\nanother necessary and important component of efforts \r\nto enhance effective multilateralism. Over the past \r\nmonths, some slow progress has been made in \r\nfollowing up the decisions taken at last year’s World \r\nSummit in this regard. We are all conscious of the \r\nefforts that need to continue at this session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly on various aspects of institutional \r\nreform, including the most sensitive one, relating to the \r\nenlargement and reform of the Security Council. That \r\nmatter has gained in urgency; the impasse should be \r\nbroken by flexibility and openness to a search for \r\ncommon ground. \r\n A new Secretary-General will be taking the reins \r\nof this Organization in the new year. The person \r\nelected will need all our encouragement and support to  \r\n \r\nfulfil the vital and demanding tasks of that unique \r\noffice. To the outgoing Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi \r\nAnnan, we express our immense sense of gratitude and \r\nadmiration for the way in which he has conducted his \r\nwork over the past 10 years and for his total dedication \r\nto the cause of peace and the international rule of law. \r\n The cause of peace and the international rule of \r\nlaw are threatened daily by cultural and religious \r\nincomprehension. An alliance of civilizations, mutual \r\nrespect and tolerance, acceptance of the other and of \r\ndiversity, peaceful coexistence and cooperation and \r\ndialogue and education are the means which the \r\ninternational community has at its disposal to \r\ncounteract the ugly phenomena of extremism and \r\nfanaticism. We cannot ignore this threat to peace and \r\nstability, a threat that is compounded by poverty and \r\nmass migration. We must further strengthen \r\nmultilateralism as a means of world governance. \r\n In this context, we need to keep in mind the \r\ngeneral without losing sight of the specific. The United \r\nNations must remain the focus of the debate on this \r\nissue and needs to continue to engage with the world \r\nmedia to spread the message and spirit of fraternity in a \r\nworld where large or small does not count. Equally, \r\nexperience has amply illustrated that small countries, \r\njust as large ones, are essential to global security, \r\ncultural interchange and respect and tolerance for \r\ndiversity. \r\n As a Mediterranean State, as a member of the \r\nEuropean Union, as current Chair-in-Office of the \r\nCommonwealth and, generally, as a member of the \r\ninternational community of States, Malta is determined \r\nto continue to make a contribution in all those \r\nforums — and in this forum — towards the interests of \r\npeace, justice and the rule of international law in the \r\nworld today and in the future. \r\n The meeting rose at 1.25 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
