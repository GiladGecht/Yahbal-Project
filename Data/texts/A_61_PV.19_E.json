(Bahrain) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\n The President: I give the floor to His Excellency \r\nThe Honourable Lieutenant General Mompati Merafhe, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and International \r\nCooperation of Botswana.  \r\n Mr. Merafhe (Botswana): Let me begin by \r\ncongratulating you, Madam, on your election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \r\nsession. Your election is a demonstration of the trust \r\nand confidence placed in you and your country, the \r\nKingdom of Bahrain, by the international community. \r\n I would also seize this opportunity to pay tribute \r\nto your illustrious predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Jan \r\nEliasson of the Kingdom of Sweden, for his sound \r\nleadership and achievements during the sixtieth \r\nsession.  \r\n Additionally, let me commend the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, for his \r\ndecade of devoted and selfless service to humanity. \r\nThis great son of Africa, with his visionary leadership \r\nof the United Nations, has provided, and continues to \r\nprovide, the embodiment of our collective aspirations \r\nto achieve a more peaceful, just, equitable and \r\nprosperous world. He is indeed Africa’s great gift to \r\nhumanity. \r\n Within the next five days, Botswana will mark 40 \r\nyears of its existence as a democratic, independent and \r\nsovereign nation. \r\n When the first President of Botswana, the late Sir \r\nSeretse Khama, addressed the Assembly on \r\n24 September 1969, he described Botswana, in part, as \r\na country faced with a problem of underdevelopment \r\nof classic proportions. \r\n Botswana had to contend with the harsh realities \r\nof its history and geographical position. We were \r\ncompletely surrounded by oppressive, aggressive and \r\nracist white minority regimes. As a small, weak and \r\npoor country, we had to begin the process of building \r\nnational institutions and laying the foundation for \r\nsocial and economic development in a very hostile \r\nenvironment. The United Nations and its Member \r\nStates served as a pillar of strength and gave us \r\npolitical and diplomatic support. \r\n Standing here today, we express our deep \r\ngratitude for the support and assistance extended to us \r\nover the years. It has been a 40-year journey of \r\ndetermined and sustained effort to achieve human-\r\ncentred development. \r\n It is a journey we have travelled with \r\ndevelopment partners from all continents. This has \r\nenabled us to achieve some measure of progress in \r\nimproving the human condition. At 40, we are an adult \r\nnation and have assumed full ownership of and \r\nresponsibility for our own development. We have \r\nadopted policies, legislation and practices aimed at \r\nA/61/PV.19  \r\n \r\n06-53341 2 \r\n \r\ncreating an environment conducive to economic growth \r\nand development. \r\n Many milestones have been achieved in our \r\nnational development effort. Today, Botswana is a \r\nmiddle-income developing country, but we still face \r\nenormous challenges for which we need assistance. In \r\nthis regard, the decision of the 2005 World Summit \r\nshould be implemented to ensure that small middle-\r\nincome developing countries such as Botswana do not \r\nfall back into the doldrums of poverty and \r\nunderdevelopment. \r\n Botswana has been blessed with one of Africa’s \r\nmajor natural resources: diamonds. It must be stated \r\nthat 65 per cent of the world’s diamonds, worth \r\n$8.3 billion per year, come from African countries. I \r\nam pleased to state that diamonds have done, and \r\ncontinue to do, good in Botswana. The diamond \r\nindustry in Botswana has been at the cutting edge of \r\nhuman development and is transforming lives for the \r\nbetter, in all fields of human endeavour. \r\n We continue to prudently manage the revenue \r\nfrom the sale of diamonds and to effectively use such \r\nrevenue to educate our people, provide potable water \r\nand health care and build an infrastructure network, \r\nincluding roads, telephones and rural electrification. \r\nThis is the good that diamonds have done and continue \r\nto do. \r\n As a participant in the Kimberley Process \r\nCertification Scheme, of which we currently hold the \r\nchairmanship, Botswana is strongly committed to \r\nworking alongside other participating countries to \r\nmaintain the credibility of the Scheme and the \r\nlegitimate diamond trade. The Kimberley Process \r\nCertification Scheme is one of the best examples of \r\nglobal cooperation. The Scheme is the embodiment of \r\nglobal consensus, unrelenting political will and the \r\ndetermination of members to do the right thing, \r\nunderpinned by strong support and the resolutions of \r\nthe Security Council. That is important, because about \r\n10 million people globally are either directly or \r\nindirectly supported by the diamond industry. In \r\nsouthern Africa, more than 28,000 people are employed \r\nby the industry. \r\n We are also here to reaffirm our commitment to \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and our strong belief \r\nin the Organization as the only vehicle by means of \r\nwhich the enduring peace and prosperity of the human \r\nrace can be assured. We welcome the opportunity for \r\nthe nations of the world to meet here annually to \r\nexchange views on matters which are central to our \r\ncommon destiny. \r\n There are many challenges which we must \r\naddress. But chief among them is ending the evil of \r\nwar. It is deeply regrettable that, although the human \r\nspecies left the jungle many, many years ago, the \r\njungle remains in human beings. As a matter of fact, if \r\nthe beasts of the jungle acquired language, they could \r\nactually claim some superiority over the human race. \r\nWhile animals may fight and brutally kill each other, \r\nthey never spend time planning how to destroy one \r\nanother or thinking about how to produce weapons of \r\nmass destruction. \r\n Be that as it may, we still have hope and \r\nconfidence in the human spirit to do good. As human \r\nbeings, we have a shared destiny and we are therefore \r\nour own saviours. \r\n The responsibility to save the human species \r\nfrom the scourge of war cannot be passed to anyone \r\nelse. It is for that reason that we consider that this \r\nAssembly provides a rare opportunity for the \r\ninternational community to move beyond platitudes \r\nand to squarely address the critical challenges of our \r\ntime. \r\n An atmosphere of international peace and \r\nsecurity is essential for human development. \r\nExperience has repeatedly shown that we cannot \r\nrealistically hope to pursue a meaningful global \r\ndevelopment agenda under conditions of war, conflict \r\nand insecurity. \r\n Conflicts in our world today should therefore be a \r\nmatter of grave concern to all of us. In 2000, at the \r\ndawn of the new millennium, we gave an undertaking \r\nthat, above all else, the twenty-first century should be \r\nan epoch of peace and prosperity. We consciously made \r\na commitment to reduce by half by 2015 the number of \r\nthe world’s poor. If we are to achieve that objective, \r\nwar should certainly be the first casualty. \r\n Botswana is particularly concerned about \r\nconflicts in Africa. Regrettably, Africa is the only \r\ncontinent that is facing the bleak prospect of failing to \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\nCan we really afford the resources for war in the midst \r\nof poverty, disease, deprivation and \r\nunderdevelopment? The answer must obviously be a \r\nresounding “No”. \r\n A/61/PV.19\r\n \r\n3 06-53341 \r\n \r\n Today, Africa is host to the largest number of \r\nrefugees, displaced persons, global poor and people \r\ninfected with and affected by HIV/AIDS. Yet, sadly, \r\nwe have the lion’s share of the world’s conflicts. \r\nEnding conflicts is therefore as much a calling as it is a \r\nmoral and political imperative. \r\n We should all be concerned about the atrocities in \r\nthe Darfur region of the Sudan. The perpetuation of \r\nthat conflict, in defiance of the collective will of the \r\ninternational community and the Charter of the United \r\nNations, is totally unacceptable. Worse still, the \r\ncarnage of daily killings is an affront to the sanctity of \r\nhuman life. This undermines our humanity. \r\n We call on all parties to the conflict to comply \r\nwith and respect the Darfur Peace Agreement. Those \r\nwho have not signed the Agreement must do so as a \r\nmatter of urgency. It is only through dialogue and \r\nmutual accommodation that durable peace can be \r\nattained. War can beget only misery and anarchy. \r\n The United Nations has expressed its desire to \r\nhelp, through the deployment of a multinational \r\npeacekeeping force. In principle, the African Union \r\nPeace and Security Council has welcomed the decision \r\nof the Security Council. \r\n Every year we come to this rostrum to call for \r\nprogress in the Middle East peace process. For \r\ngenerations that region has known no peace. If there is \r\nany lesson to be learned, it is that the only avenue to a \r\nlasting political settlement is through dialogue, \r\naccommodation and compromise. It is only in an \r\natmosphere of negotiation that reason and common \r\nsense can prevail over extremism and war-mongering. \r\n Israel and Palestine must coexist as sovereign \r\nStates that share, not only a border, but a desire for \r\npeace, security and prosperity. We urge the people of \r\nthe Middle East to summon up the courage to \r\nrecognize the folly of war and accept the virtue of \r\ndialogue. They should start building a common future \r\nfor generations that will know no violence and conflict, \r\nbut only cooperation and concord. \r\n My delegation shares the concern about the threat \r\nof terrorism. Terrorism pervades every crevice of our \r\nworld, much to the detriment of humanity. In this \r\nrespect, we welcome the recent adoption of the United \r\nNations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution \r\n60/288) by the General Assembly. \r\n When the Doha Ministerial Declaration was \r\nadopted in 2001, we had hoped for and envisaged \r\nnegotiations lasting three years. We knew then, as we \r\nknow today, that that was an ambitious and onerous \r\nundertaking. We have already missed several important \r\ndeadlines. That should be a source of concern for all of \r\nus. For many of our people, a fair and equitable \r\ninternational trading system is not only a noble \r\nobjective, but also a development imperative. It holds \r\nhope and promise of prosperity and the alleviation of \r\npoverty, which is all the more reason why we must not \r\nallow the Doha round of trade negotiations to fail. \r\n The indefinite suspension of the Doha round of \r\ntrade negotiations on 24 July 2006 has raised questions \r\nabout our collective commitment to development. In \r\nthis respect, the major question before us today is how \r\nwe can revive the Doha round of trade negotiations. It \r\ntook eight years to complete the Uruguay round. That \r\ngoes to show that at times it is not how fast the \r\nnegotiations are concluded but the substance and \r\ncontent of such negotiations. It is clear that we are \r\ngoing to miss the December 2006 deadline which we \r\nset for ourselves in 2005. \r\n It is therefore our collective responsibility as the \r\nUnited Nations to give the necessary political direction \r\nto the World Trade Organization, not only to revive the \r\nnegotiations, but also to ensure the necessary impetus \r\nfor their timely and successful conclusion. A successful \r\nconclusion should address the ever-growing special \r\ndevelopment challenges of developing countries by \r\nupholding the development dimension of the Doha \r\nround. \r\n During the sixtieth session of the General \r\nAssembly, a number of key decisions were made and \r\nwere outlined in the 2005 World Summit Outcome \r\n(resolution 60/1). Heads of State or Government called \r\nfor the establishment of institutions with a view to \r\nmaking the United Nations more effective in carrying \r\nout its mandate under the Charter and in serving \r\nMember States better. \r\n This session should be an implementation \r\nsession; we must commit ourselves to collective \r\nimplementation. It is important that we demonstrate in \r\ndeeds that, here at the United Nations, we make \r\nstatements to communicate thoughts, ideas and action \r\nplans. Such ideas are not to remain on paper; they must \r\nbe translated into programmes and projects for the \r\ncommon good. \r\nA/61/PV.19  \r\n \r\n06-53341 4 \r\n \r\n Botswana strongly supports comprehensive, wide \r\nand deep reform of the United Nations. Regarding the \r\nongoing management reform, we welcome the \r\ndecision, in resolution 60/283, to allow the Secretary-\r\nGeneral adequate authority to deploy resources and \r\nstaff from lower to higher priority programmes. We are \r\nconvinced that as chief administrative officer, the \r\nSecretary-General should be accorded more leverage to \r\ncommand both human and financial resources so that \r\nthe Secretariat can deliver more effectively. Member \r\nStates must recognize the importance of timely and \r\nunconditional funding of the mandates entrusted to the \r\nSecretary-General by the legislative bodies of the \r\nOrganization. It is incumbent upon the Secretariat to \r\nensure accountability and the prudent management of \r\nsuch resources. \r\n Enabling the Organization to effectively deliver is \r\na collective responsibility of the Member States and \r\nthe Secretariat. What is essential is for Member States \r\nto ensure that there are efficient oversight bodies to \r\nguarantee compliance with standing rules and \r\nregulations. \r\n One of the major successes of the sixtieth session \r\nwas the implementation of the World Summit decision \r\non the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission. \r\nAfrica expects the Peacebuilding Commission to \r\neffectively discharge its mandate. \r\n The establishment of the Human Rights Council \r\nis also one of the significant achievements of the \r\nsixtieth session. It demonstrates our collective desire to \r\nelevate human rights to new heights of prominence and \r\nvisibility consistent with the changing times. It is our \r\nexpectation that the new body will operate on the basis \r\nof principles of cooperation, genuine interactive \r\ndialogue and tolerance coupled with respect for \r\ndiversity. The importance of issues of development \r\nshould not be underestimated. In developing countries, \r\nthese issues are real challenges which should not be \r\noverlooked. The Human Rights Council must therefore \r\naddress issues of capacity building and find ways of \r\nresponding to institutional weaknesses and resource \r\nlimitations which hamper the process of translating \r\nconstitutional and statutory human rights provisions \r\ninto reality. \r\n Let me conclude by reaffirming Botswana’s \r\nabiding faith in the utility and universality of the \r\nUnited Nations. The United Nations is nothing else but \r\nourselves, the Member States, put together. It should be \r\ngreater than the sum total of all of us. We must \r\ntherefore have the courage to strengthen ourselves by \r\nfollowing through with reforms, including the reform \r\nof the Security Council. The reform of the Security \r\nCouncil should not pose difficulties to anyone. We are \r\nall responsible for keeping this world safe. \r\n It is only when Member States consider their \r\nnational interests to be an integral part of the wider \r\ninterests of the international community that they can \r\nset aside their apprehension with regard to a Security \r\nCouncil enlarged in both the permanent and non-\r\npermanent categories. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Come Zoumara, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs, Integration and la Francophonie of the Central \r\nAfrican Republic. \r\n Mr. Zoumara (Central African Republic) (spoke \r\nin French): As you know, Madam President, there is \r\none African tradition, but its forms are many. That is \r\nwhy the African continent is the cradle of mankind and \r\nthis African tradition universal. We can see this \r\nuniversal nature here in New York within this forum of \r\nthe United Nations where the values of solidarity and \r\nbrotherhood symbolize a common desire for peace and \r\nlove.  \r\n How can we not fail today to recall the vitality \r\nwhich marked the World Summit which was held in \r\n2005 in this very Hall, following the fifty-ninth \r\nsession, which was undoubtedly the longest ever due to \r\nthe intensity of the consultations begun by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Jean Ping, President at that session, \r\nwith a view to reaching a consensus on questions \r\nrelated to reform of our Organization, including that of \r\nthe Security Council. Those questions divided, and \r\ncontinue to divide, delegations and regional groups, \r\nand finally overshadowed the discussion of other \r\nitems.  \r\n But the Summit and the ensuing sixtieth session \r\nnonetheless had the merit of establishing the Human \r\nRights Council and the Peacebuilding Commission.  \r\n Despite all the differences among United Nations \r\nMembers and despite the criticism of some of its \r\nactions, the United Nations remains the international \r\norganization which, due to its universality, \r\nrepresentativity and authority, cannot be ignored. The \r\nCentral African Republic, which reiterates its \r\ncommitment to the purposes and principles of the \r\n A/61/PV.19\r\n \r\n5 06-53341 \r\n \r\nCharter, would like to reaffirm its ongoing desire to \r\ncontinue to contribute to all efforts to reform the entire \r\nUnited Nations system. \r\n Having said that, I should like, on behalf of His \r\nExcellency General François Bozizé, President of the \r\nRepublic, head of State, and on behalf of the \r\nGovernment and the people of the Central African \r\nRepublic, to warmly congratulate you, Madam, on your \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at the \r\npresent session. I view it as a sign of confidence and a \r\nwell-deserved tribute to your beautiful country, the \r\nKingdom of Bahrain. I am also pleased to express to \r\nyour predecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, my high esteem for \r\nthe remarkable way in which he led the work of the \r\nsixtieth session. In addition, I express my warm and \r\nsincere thanks and appreciation to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, a worthy son of the African \r\ntradition, for his praiseworthy and tireless efforts, in a \r\nparticularly difficult international context, to promote \r\nthe role of the Organization, to attain its objectives and \r\nto promote peace and security throughout the world. \r\n The theme suggested for the present session is \r\n“Implementing a Global Partnership for Development”. \r\nWe should recall that, six years ago, the highest leaders \r\nof the Organization’s Member States made the firm \r\ncommitment to unite their efforts to collectively fight \r\npoverty and all the scourges it causes, which pose a \r\nserious threat to international peace and security and a \r\nmajor obstacle to the development processes in many \r\ncountries.  \r\n In the Millennium Declaration, which resulted \r\nfrom that commitment, the 189 signatory countries — \r\nincluding the Central African Republic — solemnly \r\npledged to do their utmost to overcome poverty, which \r\ncontinues to devastate the majority of the world’s \r\npopulation. To that end, several Goals were defined. \r\n Ms. Blum (Colombia), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n As the Secretary-General has stated, the main \r\nGoals have been implemented to varying degrees:  \r\n“Accordingly, we will not enjoy development \r\nwithout security, we will not enjoy security \r\nwithout development, and we will not enjoy \r\neither without respect for human rights. Unless \r\nall these causes are advanced, none will succeed” \r\n(A/59/2005, para. 17). \r\n In the case of the Central African Republic, we \r\nmust acknowledge that many challenges remain to be \r\naddressed if we are to truly strive to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) within the \r\nagreed time frame. Indeed, my country experienced \r\nmore than two decades of serious crises, from which \r\nwe only recently emerged by holding general elections \r\nand establishing republican institutions and the \r\nGovernment of National Reconciliation. But we must \r\nstill fight the cross-border insecurity raging in the \r\nsubregion and push back out of our territory the \r\naggressors, supported from abroad, who seek to \r\ndestroy our democratically established republican \r\ninstitutions.  \r\n The Central African authorities are striving to \r\nrestore security throughout the territory. It goes without \r\nsaying that no development is possible unless we \r\neradicate the endemic insecurity maintained by those \r\nwho set up roadblocks and by the rebellion raging \r\nmainly in the north-eastern part of the country, \r\nbordering on the Sudan and Chad. The security and \r\ndefence forces deployed in the back country face many \r\ndifficulties — particularly logistical ones — in \r\novercoming that phenomenon. The proliferation of \r\nsmall arms and light weapons in the subregion — due \r\nto the long crisis in Darfur and its effects on the \r\nCentral African Republic — are hardly helping to put \r\nan end to that scourge. \r\n The Central African Republic supports the \r\nproposals made by Presidents George Bush and \r\nJacques Chirac and by the Chairperson of the African \r\nUnion, Mr. Denis Sassou Nguesso, on the positioning \r\nof United Nations troops on the border between the \r\nCentral African Republic, Chad and the Sudan.  \r\n In addition, since 2003, the Central African \r\nRepublic, one of the seven countries in partnership \r\nwith the World Bank’s Multi-country Demobilization \r\nand Reintegration Programme, has taken a new \r\ncomprehensive, integrated approach that is integrative \r\nand inclusive aimed at resolving the thorny problem of \r\nthe disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of \r\nformer combatants. The results today reflect the \r\nGovernment’s willingness to succeed in that process. \r\nMoreover, our country has just developed a new \r\nstructure to fight the proliferation of small arms and \r\nlight weapons, namely, a national commission against \r\nthe illicit proliferation of small arms and light weapons \r\nand for disarmament. \r\nA/61/PV.19  \r\n \r\n06-53341 6 \r\n \r\n The deteriorated state of the Central African \r\neconomy is hardly likely to encourage the \r\nimplementation of the Development Goals in order to \r\npromote a robust fight against poverty, which for us \r\nremains an ongoing threat to peace and stability.  \r\n In the area of finance, the Government has taken \r\nenergetic measures to restore financial health by \r\nimplementing an extensive system to monitor civil \r\nservants and establishing a body to verify their \r\nacademic credentials.  \r\n The other challenges — just as great — facing \r\nthe Central African Republic are those of health care \r\nand education, which are among the main MDGs. With \r\nrespect to health care, the HIV/AIDS pandemic and \r\nother diseases, such as tuberculosis and malaria, are \r\nsources of concern for our country.  \r\n The recent conference on AIDS, held here at \r\nUnited Nations Headquarters in early June 2006, \r\nhighlighted the particularly disturbing characteristics \r\nof that calamity among the most impoverished sectors \r\nof the population: women and children. There is a \r\nhealth emergency, and thus the Central African \r\nRepublic is requesting greater assistance and action \r\nfrom its development partners. \r\n The education and training sector — covered by \r\nGoal 2 of the MDGs — has undoubtedly been the main \r\nvictim of the long period of political and military \r\ncrises, whose wounds are gradually healing. The many \r\nempty years of discouragement resulting from the loss \r\nof motivation on the part of the teaching staff, delayed \r\nsalary payments, the lack of State resources to build \r\nschools and purchase equipment, and the continued \r\ninsecurity in some areas of the country for the past \r\nseveral years — all of that has led to a decline in the \r\nquality of teaching and a drop in the literacy rate. \r\n However, since the burst of patriotism of \r\n15 March 2003, the Government has been doing its \r\nutmost to ensure that the school year will no longer be \r\ninterrupted and to restore the former credibility of the \r\nCentral African educational system. Thanks to the \r\nassistance of certain donors — among which we must \r\nmention the International Organization of la \r\nFrancophonie — the Central African Republic is \r\nbeginning to take up the challenge between now and \r\n2015. Indeed, it will not be possible to ensure that \r\ndemocracy and a culture of dialogue and tolerance are \r\nfirmly established unless the people have access to \r\nquality education and are able to grasp what is truly at \r\nstake, and thus make sound judgements in full \r\nknowledge of the facts. \r\n The United Nations Millennium Development \r\nGoals Report 2005 highlights the need to ensure a \r\nsustainable environment by intelligently exploiting \r\nnatural resources and protecting the ecosystems upon \r\nwhich the survival of humanity depends. Climate \r\nchange and global warming owing to the depletion of \r\nthe ozone layer are worrisome phenomena for our \r\ncountry, whose northern region is being increasingly \r\novertaken by desert. The initiatives set out in the Kyoto \r\nProtocol show that progress is possible if there is \r\npolitical will on the part of the major consumers.  \r\n If we are to prevent and reduce the risks related \r\nto natural disasters and to equip ourselves with better \r\norganization and more effective means to make the \r\nworld safer, we must support the transformation of the \r\nUnited Nations Environmental Programme into a \r\nspecialized agency with a broader mandate, as \r\nproposed by France. \r\n Despite delays in the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), the Central \r\nAfrican Republic is determined to reach them, \r\nespecially Goals 3 and 4, relating to the empowerment \r\nof women and the promotion of gender equality and to \r\nthe reduction of under-five mortality. Indeed, \r\nconsiderable progress has been made in terms of \r\nvaccination coverage and also with respect to the free \r\ndistribution of mosquito nets to pregnant women and to \r\nchildren under the age of 5.  \r\n The Central African Republic greatly appreciates \r\nthe proposals made during the 2005 World Summit by \r\nPresidents Chirac, Lula Da Silva and Hu Jintao \r\nregarding the promotion of peace, security and \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n However, the results of MDG implementation \r\nwill remain mixed until international solidarity fully \r\nplays its part. We live in an interdependent world; the \r\ndevelopment of the Central African Republic is closely \r\nlinked to that of the rest of the world, because the \r\nUnited Nations is a community of nations.  \r\n May God bless the United Nations. May God \r\nbless the Central African Republic.  \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Vartan Oskanian, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Armenia. \r\n A/61/PV.19\r\n \r\n7 06-53341 \r\n \r\n Mr. Oskanian (Armenia): Let me congratulate \r\nMs. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa on her election to the \r\npresidency and wish her a year relatively free of \r\nconflict crisis and catastrophe — in other words, a year \r\nunlike the one we have just had, during which His \r\nExcellency Jan Eliasson significantly contributed to the \r\nsuccessful navigation of troubled waters with his great \r\nleadership. The “year of turmoil”, as he called it (see \r\nA/60/PV.100), included conflicts and crises, as well as \r\nman-made and natural disasters, all requiring our \r\ncollective response. We have responded with great \r\ncommitment to maintain peace and stability in the \r\nworld.  \r\n Of the conflicts that we have faced in this past \r\nyear, the one that emerged to be the most tragic was \r\nthat of the war in Lebanon. I believe the international \r\ncommunity has lost some credibility and moral \r\nauthority in the eyes of the peoples of the world, who \r\nwatched the Security Council bicker over minute issues \r\nwhile bombs were being dropped in Lebanon and \r\ninnocent people were being killed. It was a great shame \r\nfor the international community not to be able to \r\ndeliver and establish an immediate ceasefire. When an \r\ninternational body loses moral authority, our ability to \r\neffectively tackle problems and issues that require a \r\ncollective response is certainly undermined.  \r\n In other areas, however, the collective efforts of \r\nthe international community have indeed succeeded. I \r\nbelieve we played a role in the civilized process of \r\nbringing Montenegro to this day and to this body. \r\nCollectively, we created and empowered the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, two bodies that hold great promise for \r\ndelivering deeper and more profound commitment on \r\nthe part of the world community to building peace and \r\nprotecting human rights.  \r\n The most threatening challenges in the world \r\nremain those of poverty and hopelessness. When our \r\nleaders gathered in this Hall six years ago, they \r\ndecided that the United Nations was the most effective \r\nbody in which to address the ills facing our societies. \r\nThey collectively recognized their responsibility to \r\ndeliver, worldwide, more equitably distributed social \r\nand economic development, at an accelerated pace. \r\nThey said to the world that they were willing to \r\nchannel international processes and multilateral \r\nresources in order to tackle the needs of the world’s \r\npoor. They will be judged by their adherence to the \r\nprinciple, promise and commitment of collective \r\naction. Six years have now passed and the world still \r\nearnestly looks on to see whether individual and \r\nregional interests can be overcome and those problems \r\njointly addressed. \r\n We in Armenia also face similar problems. We are \r\nencouraged and rewarded by the extensive political and \r\neconomic reforms that we have conducted over the past \r\n10 years. The results are evident. We are now preparing \r\nto engage in the second generation of political and \r\neconomic reforms in order to continue to build on the \r\npast decade of progress. We are moving forward on \r\nlegislative and administrative matters; we are today a \r\nmore democratic society and a more open and more \r\nliberal economy. We have been registering double-digit \r\ngrowth over the past six years.  \r\n While we are encouraged by this economic \r\nprogress and the positive macroeconomic indicators, \r\nwe are now turning our attention to the rural areas in \r\norder to eradicate poverty in our society. We are \r\nreminded of the remarkable promise, made in 2000, to \r\nthe victims of global poverty to “free our fellow men, \r\nwomen and children from the abject and dehumanizing \r\nconditions of extreme poverty” (resolution 55/2, \r\npara. 11). To be able to do that in Armenia, we will \r\nleverage the philanthropy of international organizations \r\nand friendly countries with the traditional generosity of \r\nour diaspora, so that we can build and repair \r\ninfrastructure and thus create new conditions for \r\neconomic development and social change. But we also \r\nunderstand that infrastructure alone is not enough to \r\nintroduce that kind of change that reduces poverty. We \r\nneed to invest in people; we need to invest in women \r\nand children; and we need to educate them and train \r\nthem for the future. \r\n We will begin that programme in Armenia’s \r\nborder villages. Unlike other countries, where border \r\nvillages are points of interaction and activity, \r\nArmenia’s eastern and western borders are closed, thus \r\nstifling economic interaction and regional cooperation. \r\nWith our neighbour, Turkey, it is not only economic \r\ncooperation that suffers, but also the dialogue between \r\nour two peoples. Turkey’s insistence on keeping the \r\nborder closed and not allowing interaction between the \r\ntwo communities freezes the memories of yesterday, \r\ninstead of promoting dialogue and interaction to create \r\nnew experiences and new memories for tomorrow. We \r\nstill believe and hope that Turkey will eventually \r\nunderstand that keeping the border closed until there is \r\nharmony and mutual understanding between our two \r\nA/61/PV.19  \r\n \r\n06-53341 8 \r\n \r\npeoples is not a policy. On the contrary, it is avoidance \r\nof a responsible policy to forge and promote regional \r\ncooperation and economic development at a time and \r\nin a region that are the object of growing global \r\nattention. \r\n Let me address the issue of Kosovo, as many \r\nhave done from this podium. We closely follow the \r\nprocess of self-determination in Kosovo because we \r\nArmenians, ourselves, are extremely supportive of the \r\nprocess of self-determination for the people of \r\nNagorno Karabakh. But we do not draw parallels \r\nbetween the two conflicts or with any other conflict. \r\nWe believe and insist that conflicts are all different, \r\nand each must be decided on its own merits. While we \r\nourselves do not consider the Kosovo outcome to be a \r\nprecedent for other conflicts, we are extremely anxious \r\nabout the possibility that it may raise artificial \r\nobstacles for other self-determination movements, \r\nsimply because others cite it as a precedent. This is of \r\nextreme concern to us because we believe that there are \r\nmovements in the world today that have earned the \r\nright to self-determination. The Kosovo outcome \r\nshould not serve as an excuse or reason to put a damper \r\non those self-determination movements. \r\n Yet, such attempts are already apparent in this \r\nHall as the principle of self-determination is being \r\nundermined compared to other principles. But this goes \r\ncontrary to the lessons of history. There is a reason that \r\nthe Helsinki Final Act enshrined the principle of self-\r\ndetermination as equal among other principles in \r\ninternational relations. In international interactions, \r\njust as in human relations, there are no absolute values. \r\nThere are also responsibilities. A State should gain and \r\nearn the right to govern. States have the responsibility \r\nto protect their own citizens, and the people have the \r\nright to choose the Government that they think should \r\ngovern them.  \r\n The people of Nagorno Karabakh decided long \r\nago not to be represented by the Government of \r\nAzerbaijan, because they suffered from State violence. \r\nThey tried to protect themselves, and they succeeded \r\nagainst all odds, only to hear the State cry foul and \r\nclaim sovereignty and territorial integrity. But \r\nAzerbaijan has lost every iota of the moral right to talk \r\nabout guaranteeing the security of the people of \r\nNagorno Karabakh, let alone to claim custody over that \r\npeople.  \r\n Azerbaijan did not act responsibly or morally \r\ntowards the people of Nagorno Karabakh, people that it \r\nconsidered to be its own citizens. It unleashed military \r\naction; it sanctioned pogroms and massacres in urban \r\nareas. It bombed and displaced more than 300,000 \r\nArmenians. When it lost the war and accepted a \r\nceasefire, it began to destroy all traces of Armenians by \r\neliminating Armenian monuments throughout the \r\nterritory. Over the past two years, the remaining 2,000 \r\ncarved stone crosses, representing Armenian \r\ncemeteries, were desecrated and eliminated. The \r\nterritory has now been turned into a shooting range for \r\nthe Azerbaijani army. This reflects the fact that \r\nAzerbaijan still does not believe in the peaceful \r\nresolution of this conflict.  \r\n Armenians cannot be blamed for thinking that \r\nAzerbaijan is not serious about a peaceful solution. \r\nHaving rejected the past two offers of the international \r\ncommunity, Azerbaijan is now concerned about being \r\naccused of rejecting the current peace plan. That is why \r\nit is manoeuvring and manipulating every possible \r\nsituation — from State violence to introducing \r\nresolutions in other forums outside the peace process \r\nso that the Armenians are forced to do the rejecting.  \r\n But Armenia is clearly on record as stating that it \r\nstands by every single principle included in the \r\ndocument it submitted. However, in order to give a \r\nchance to that document, one cannot think or even \r\npretend to think that there is a military option to this \r\nconflict. There is no military option. That option has \r\nbeen tried and has failed. The only option today is \r\nrealism and compromise. The path that the people of \r\nNagorno Karabakh have chosen over the past two \r\ndecades is a path that has become irreversible. \r\nSolidifying and formalizing the process will greatly \r\ncontribute to peace and stability in our region. \r\n Karabakh is not a cause. It is an ancient place, a \r\nbeautiful garden with people who have earned the right \r\nto live in peace and prosperity. That is what we seek, \r\nand we cannot accept anything less. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Morshed Khan, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh. \r\n Mr. Khan (Bangladesh): I extend my \r\ndelegation’s sincerest congratulations to the President \r\non her very well-deserved election. I would like to \r\ncongratulate her predecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, on his \r\nstewardship of the historic sixtieth session of the \r\n A/61/PV.19\r\n \r\n9 06-53341 \r\n \r\nAssembly and to pay a special tribute to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his dedicated service to the Organization \r\nover the past decade. It is also my pleasure to welcome \r\nMontenegro as the newest Member of our \r\nOrganization.  \r\n The Assembly is meeting against a backdrop of \r\ndire human tragedy. The recent wanton Israeli \r\naggression in Lebanon has shocked the world. Most \r\ndisconcerting has been the fact that the international \r\ncommunity failed to respond promptly and effectively, \r\nas colossal devastation wrecked Lebanon and the \r\nLebanese people. In the end, the Security Council \r\nredeemed itself by ordering a ceasefire in Lebanon. Let \r\nus hope that the Security Council will exercise its \r\nmandated responsibilities so that such atrocities and \r\nviolations of human rights do not occur in the future \r\nunder any pretext. \r\n Alongside Lebanon, the dire situation in Palestine \r\nhas worsened owing to the continuous use of \r\ndisproportionate force by the Israeli Government. We \r\ncall upon the international community to make sincere \r\nefforts to put the peace process back on track. \r\n The scourge of terrorism knows no boundaries. It \r\nis professed and carried out by a handful, and the vast \r\nmajority of victims are innocent men, women and \r\nchildren. Efforts to combat terrorism and its \r\nprotagonists globally and nationally may have seen \r\nsome positive results. However, action to combat terror \r\nby individual countries has created divisions between \r\npeoples and affected interfaith harmony. Many \r\nindividuals are being subjected to racial or religious \r\nprofiling, which foments suspicion, misunderstanding \r\nand even hatred. That is what the terrorists are actually \r\nlooking for: to divide the nations of the world. We \r\nmust ensure that they do not have their way. \r\n Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia has \r\nunequivocally declared that Bangladesh abjures \r\nreligious extremism and does not and will not support \r\nany kind of militancy. The Prime Minister has \r\nreasserted her Government’s vow to eliminate all \r\nmilitants and their networks. She has called for the \r\npassage of tough laws to punish the perpetrators, whom \r\nshe has repeatedly dubbed enemies of Islam, enemies \r\nof democracy, development, humanity and the people \r\nof the country — our country, beloved Bangladesh. \r\n In this connection, I must mention that a small \r\ngroup of extremists carried out a country-wide \r\nbombing attack on 17 August last year in Bangladesh. \r\nBut the extremists underestimated the will of the \r\nGovernment and the people of Bangladesh. Instead of \r\nfear, there was anger. The Government mobilized all \r\navailable resources to relentlessly hunt down the \r\nleaders and the operatives. I am proud to inform the \r\nAssembly that we have been able to bring all the \r\nleaders of the outlawed militant group to justice. \r\n Bangladesh today is what it has always been: a \r\nmoderate, tolerant society that practises democracy and \r\nwhere the equal rights of each and every citizen are \r\npreserved. Our determined action did not allow the \r\nopportunists and the perpetrators of terror to destroy \r\nthe values of democracy and tolerance that we treasure \r\nmost. \r\n For smaller States, the United Nations remains \r\nthe premier world body, addressing the challenges they \r\nface. Despite its shortcomings, the United Nations has \r\nproved invaluable in times of crisis and in the tasks of \r\npreserving global peace and security and promoting \r\nsustainable development. \r\n At present, we are seized of the issue of reform of \r\nthe United Nations. Bangladesh holds that reform is a \r\nprocess and not an end in itself. We do not think that \r\narbitrary deadlines or pressure in order to obtain a \r\nparticular outcome are helpful. It is our belief that, for \r\nmeaningful reform, an environment of mutual trust, \r\nconfidence and respect for divergent positions is \r\nindispensable. \r\n We trust that the new Human Rights Council will \r\nnot be a mere replication of the Commission on Human \r\nRights. It must not indulge in politicization of its work. \r\nBangladesh, as an elected member, is committed to \r\nadvancing the work of the Council in a fair and \r\nbalanced manner. \r\n We hope, too, that the newly constituted \r\nPeacebuilding Commission will fill the existing \r\ninstitutional gap in the United Nations system to \r\nfacilitate the transition from peacekeeping to \r\npeacebuilding. Bangladesh, being one of the largest \r\ncontributors to United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations, will bring its experience to the work of the \r\nCommission in all its aspects. \r\n As the United Nations deals with individual post-\r\nconflict situations, it must not lose sight of wider \r\nissues, such as disarmament and small-arms \r\nproliferation, as well as weapons of mass destruction. \r\nA/61/PV.19  \r\n \r\n06-53341 10 \r\n \r\nBangladesh would like to see sustained efforts by the \r\nUnited Nations in these very critical areas. \r\n The Outcome Document of the 2005 World \r\nSummit (resolution 60/1), which had development as \r\nits centrepiece, has hardly progressed beyond mere \r\npledges. For the least developed countries (LDCs), the \r\nsavings-investment gap and lack of capital remain the \r\nprimary constraints to development. Official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) to the LDCs in 2004, \r\naccording to the most recent data available, amounted \r\nto $23.8 billion, or $35.70 per person living in these \r\ncountries. This is certainly not sufficient to \r\ncomplement income or boost investment. Faster growth \r\nin exports, and the consequent rise in income, could \r\nhelp the LDCs accumulate the resources needed for \r\ndevelopment. For this, we would need unhindered \r\nmarket access for all LDC exports. The Doha \r\ndevelopment round must resume to ensure special and \r\ndifferential treatment for the LDCs. We would also \r\nneed increased ODA, full debt cancellation, foreign \r\ndirect investment and transfer of technology to enhance \r\nthe global partnership for development. \r\n We can also increase capital flows to LDCs by \r\naddressing one of the fundamental inequities in the \r\nglobal financial system. It is utterly inefficient and \r\nunfair that the LDCs cannot utilize their own foreign \r\nexchange reserves — a staggering $28 billion — to \r\nfinance their own development efforts and that these \r\nreserves yield very low interest, or none at all. On the \r\nother hand, when LDCs borrow against their own \r\nreserves, they pay a huge premium in interest or \r\nservice charges. The United Nations system must lead \r\nthe international effort to reform the global reserve \r\nsystem and to make arrangements that enable the LDCs \r\nto borrow at a zero mark-up of the interest rate against \r\ntheir own foreign exchange reserves. \r\n The General Assembly has just concluded the \r\nmidterm comprehensive review of the implementation \r\nof the Brussels Programme of Action for the LDCs. In \r\nthis context, I would like to point out that, unless duty-\r\nfree and quota-free market access for all LDC products \r\nis ensured, the agreed development goals and targets \r\nwill remain unattained for a long time to come. We call \r\non the developed countries to fulfil their pledges of \r\nsupport for the framework to facilitate aid for trade, to \r\nwhich they have committed many times over. An \r\neffective monitoring capacity under the auspices of the \r\nUnited Nations can significantly facilitate this task. \r\n Let me now turn to two issues that are of \r\nparticular concern to Bangladesh. I begin with \r\nmigration. Liberalizing the movement of labour can \r\ngenerate significant benefits and a win-win result for \r\nboth sending and receiving countries, as well as for the \r\nmigrants themselves. Numerous studies have found \r\nthat a modest commitment under the World Trade \r\nOrganization’s General Agreement on Trade in \r\nServices Mode 4 would offer substantial welfare gains \r\nfor both developing and developed countries. It may \r\neven exceed the gain of complete market liberalization \r\nin merchandise trade. \r\n The second issue is the threat of natural disasters, \r\nwhich often undermine our development efforts. The \r\nAsian tsunami was a wake-up call for all of us. In these \r\ntimes of increasing global interdependence, disaster \r\nrisk management is a matter of global concern, as the \r\nimpact of a disaster in one region adversely affects \r\nothers. Bangladesh has advanced considerably in the \r\nfield of comprehensive disaster management. We stand \r\nready to share our experience, which has been \r\ninternationally recognized as the best-practice model. \r\nThe United Nations must gear its efforts to introduce \r\nweather insurance and weather derivatives to manage \r\nthe risks of natural disasters, especially in developing \r\ncountries. \r\n Within weeks of her assumption to power five \r\nyears ago with a massive mandate from our people, the \r\nGovernment of Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia \r\nlaunched a reform programme to restore discipline in \r\nour country. Thanks to our relentless efforts, we could \r\naccelerate the growth momentum remarkably without \r\ndestabilizing our macroeconomic fundamentals. \r\n After maintaining a growth rate of 6 per cent for \r\nthe past five years, we expect a growth rate of 6.7 per \r\ncent this fiscal year, against the backdrop of a global \r\neconomic slowdown. Given natural disasters, political \r\nunrest and many external shocks — such as the global \r\neconomic recession, the phasing out of the Multifibre \r\nArrangement and the oil price hike — that affect our \r\neconomies, that is a remarkable achievement. \r\n Keeping our commitment to the Millennium \r\nDeclaration, we have already achieved two Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals by ensuring access to safe drinking \r\nwater and removing gender disparity in primary and \r\nsecondary education. Enrolment in primary education \r\nhas been ensured for 97 per cent of our children. Of \r\ncourse, there is no complacency on our part and we \r\n A/61/PV.19\r\n \r\n11 06-53341 \r\n \r\nknow that we should try to achieve 100 per cent \r\nenrolment in our primary schools. \r\n Apart from those achievements, Bangladesh has \r\nachieved remarkable success in the reduction of child \r\nand maternal mortality and malnutrition and in \r\nimproving food security. We have begun channelling \r\nresources to targeted programmes in the light of our \r\nPoverty Reduction Strategy Paper. Our development \r\nefforts, however sincere, will not reach their goals or \r\neven see the light of day unless they are complemented \r\nby international support. \r\n Bangladesh has been pursuing meaningful \r\nregional cooperation to improve the socio-economic \r\nconditions of South and South-East Asia. As the \r\ncurrent Chair of the South Asian Association for \r\nRegional Cooperation and as members of the Bay of \r\nBengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and \r\nEconomic Cooperation, the Asia Cooperation Dialogue \r\nand the Developing Eight Countries, Bangladesh has \r\ndemonstrated its commitment to working with other \r\ncountries of the region. We are working in total \r\nharmony with the nations of our region. Our recent \r\npartnership in the Regional Forum of the Association \r\nof Southeast Asian Nations bears testimony to our \r\ncommitment. \r\n The present Government will complete its tenure \r\ntowards the end of next month and will hand over \r\npower to a neutral caretaker Government in accordance \r\nwith the provisions of the Constitution. We very much \r\nhope to return to work again with the General \r\nAssembly. We have had peaceful transfers of power \r\nover the past three elections under neutral caretaker \r\nGovernments when the voters exercised their franchise \r\nfreely and without fear or intimidation. The system has \r\nworked and has been accepted by the people. \r\nDemocracy has taken firm root in our country and the \r\nnext general election will be one more opportunity for \r\nthe people to demonstrate that they are the ultimate \r\nsource of power. \r\n I end with the assurance that we will work \r\ntogether for a better tomorrow for future generations. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Talbak Nazarov, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Tajikistan. \r\n Mr. Nazarov (Tajikistan) (spoke in Russian): It \r\ngives me great pleasure to join in the warm \r\ncongratulations to Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa \r\nupon her assumption of the office of President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-first session. We are \r\nconfident that her extensive professional and life \r\nexperience will be instrumental in addressing the issues \r\nfaced by the General Assembly. \r\n Tajikistan also welcomes the accession of \r\nMontenegro to the United Nations. On this occasion, \r\non behalf of the Government of our country, I would \r\nlike to extend our sincere congratulations to the \r\nGovernment and people of that friendly State. \r\n A year has passed since the historic Summit \r\nconfirmed the common views of the international \r\ncommunity on the key issues of our time and on the \r\nUnited Nations as the universal international \r\nOrganization whose goals and objectives are focused \r\non the collective search for answers to the questions of \r\nconcern to the entire international community. The \r\nleaders of our States declared that only strict \r\ncompliance with the United Nations Charter, a \r\ncomprehensive collective approach and mutual trust \r\ncan ensure international security and development. The \r\nlatest developments in the Middle East have proved \r\nonce again the need to enhance the coordinating role of \r\nthe United Nations in addressing global and regional \r\nissues. \r\n Tajikistan is in favour of further strengthening the \r\nUnited Nations and lends its overall support to the \r\nprocess of its ongoing reform. As for Security Council \r\nreform, it should be undertaken by consensus, with due \r\nconsideration for the interests of all Member States. \r\n We believe that it was broad consensus that made \r\npossible such major accomplishments as the holding of \r\nthe first session of the Human Rights Council, the \r\nlaunching of the Democracy Fund and the \r\nestablishment of the Central Emergency Response \r\nFund. Of special importance was the establishment of \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission, whose objective is also \r\nto sustain peace and development in post-conflict \r\ncountries.  \r\n The Government of Tajikistan was among those \r\nthat actively advocated the establishment of an \r\nefficient United Nations body of that kind — one that \r\nwould focus on issues of coordination and targeted \r\nsupport for countries emerging from armed conflict. \r\nTajikistan’s painful but ultimately successful transition \r\nfrom civil war to peace convincingly demonstrated the \r\nneed for an international peacebuilding agency to assist \r\nthe Security Council and other United Nations bodies \r\nA/61/PV.19  \r\n \r\n06-53341 12 \r\n \r\nin their efforts to accelerate the rehabilitation of \r\ncountries emerging from crisis and to create guarantees \r\nfor the non-recurrence of such conflicts. \r\n Stable peace prevails in Tajikistan today, and \r\nnational accord and respect for political pluralism have \r\nbeen achieved. The complex process of establishing \r\ndemocracy is under way, and all political forces \r\ninvolved are aware of their ever-increasing \r\nresponsibility for the fate of our country. In compliance \r\nwith the Constitution and valid legal procedures, new \r\neffective Government institutions are being \r\nsuccessfully built. Respect for the law is increasingly \r\nthe rule rather than the exception. Civil society is \r\ndeveloping at an accelerated pace. Citizens determine \r\ntheir own destiny through active participation in the \r\nlife of the State. The forthcoming presidential \r\nelections, scheduled for November 2006, will be an \r\nimportant milestone on the road towards peace and will \r\nopen a new page in the history of the establishment of \r\nTajik statehood. \r\n In Tajikistan, as in the majority of United Nations \r\nMember States, the issue of sustainable development \r\nranks among our top priorities. Today, we are fully \r\naware of how instrumental the United Nations agenda \r\nhas been in enhancing sustainable development and \r\neradicating poverty, epidemics, famine and illiteracy \r\nthe world over. At the same time, the implementation \r\nof a large-scale programme to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals will require not only extra effort, \r\nbut also considerable financing. In that regard, we \r\nexpect tangible results from the work of the \r\nCommission on Sustainable Development and the \r\nHigh-level Dialogue on Financing for Development. \r\n In that connection, we highly value the outcome \r\nof the United Nations High-level Dialogue recently \r\nheld in New York, which helped States concerned with \r\nissues of migration to reach constructive mutual \r\nunderstanding. Migration has been an issue of vital \r\nimportance to our country since the outbreak of the \r\ncivil war, when a part of the Tajik population had to \r\nleave the country. I would like to emphasize the special \r\nrole and capacity of the United Nations in \r\nstrengthening international cooperation in the field of \r\nmigration and development. In this regard, Tajikistan is \r\nresolved to achieve as much progress as possible in \r\nimplementing the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). In recent years, tangible progress has been \r\nachieved in the implementation of a number of goals, \r\nand the foundation has been laid for enhancing efforts \r\nin this area. \r\n But long-term stability in Central Asia in the \r\nyears to come is inseparable from the development of \r\nregional integration.  \r\n Currently, vast opportunities are emerging in the \r\nCentral Asian region for the implementation of large-\r\nscale economic projects, the creation of a unified \r\nmarket of commodities and services and the \r\nestablishment of conditions for attracting capital \r\ninvestment. Potential foreign investors see Central Asia \r\nas a single entity; and, primarily, as a common market. \r\n Economic integration will become a powerful \r\nfactor in the sustainable development of the region and \r\nwill bring about the reduction of poverty and the \r\nimprovement of well-being. For this reason, Tajikistan \r\nwill continue to stand for strengthening of ties and the \r\nexpansion of mutually advantageous cooperation \r\namong the States of the region. \r\n The current positive processes in Afghanistan \r\nalso create favourable conditions for regional \r\ncooperation in implementing transportation and \r\ncommunication projects which will provide the region \r\nwith access to the southern seaports. The creation of \r\nnew multi-modal transport corridors and the revival of \r\nthe Great Silk Road routes will form a unified \r\ninterconnected system of communications and make it \r\npossible for Central Asian States to gain access to \r\npromising markets. \r\n It is also obvious that in many respects the \r\nattainment of the MDGs depends on assistance \r\nrendered by the international community to developing \r\ncountries. Tajikistan joins the request addressed to the \r\ndonor community to at least double the amount of \r\nassistance provided for the purposes of long-term \r\ndevelopment. The process of exchanging the debts of \r\ndeveloping countries for national projects in the field \r\nof sustainable development remains an urgent issue. \r\n One of our planet’s major assets is the fresh water \r\nindispensable for sustaining life. Our common goal in \r\nthis respect is to develop qualitatively new patterns for \r\nthe sustainable management of water resources and for \r\naddressing water-related economic issues at the \r\nnational, regional and international levels. This can be \r\nachieved through a combination of appropriate support \r\nfrom the international community and national efforts, \r\n A/61/PV.19\r\n \r\n13 06-53341 \r\n \r\nwith the leading role being played by countries and \r\nregions faced with the water-resource problems. \r\n In this regard, Tajikistan hopes for the continued \r\nactive involvement of the Member States in the \r\nactivities of the International Decade for Action, \r\n“Water for Life”, 2005-2015, including the successful \r\nholding of the International Freshwater Forum in \r\nDushanbe in 2010. In order to coordinate activities in \r\nthis area the Government of Tajikistan is establishing \r\nthe National Water Committee. It will monitor progress \r\nand develop effective ways of attaining the goals of the \r\nwater Decade at the national, regional and global levels \r\nthrough cooperation with the countries and \r\ninternational organizations concerned. Our efforts in \r\nthe area of water are part and parcel of the strategic \r\nprogramme for the attainment of the MDGs. \r\n It is well known that international terrorism, \r\ntransnational organized crime and illegal drug \r\ntrafficking obstruct sustainable development. Tajikistan \r\nbelieves that the United Nations and its Security \r\nCouncil provide a unique opportunity for the \r\ndevelopment and implementation of joint measures to \r\nconfront international terrorism and the narcotics \r\nthreat. We entirely support the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral entitled “Uniting against terrorism: \r\nrecommendations for a global counter-terrorism \r\nstrategy”, and we view the outlined principles for \r\nconfronting new challenges and risks as major \r\ninstruments for counteracting those threats. \r\n The response of the international community to \r\nthe complex strategic threat of terrorism must also be \r\ncomprehensive. The community of nations must \r\nintensify its efforts to counteract the instigation of acts \r\nof terror, the spread of terrorism ideology, extremism \r\nand separatism, religious and ethnic intolerance and \r\nhostility, and the financing of terrorism. \r\n Universalizing and improving an international \r\nlegal framework to counter terrorism remains an urgent \r\nissue. The speedy approval of the draft comprehensive \r\nconvention on international terrorism will serve the \r\ninterests of all countries and peoples in the United \r\nNations community. Tajikistan will continue to support \r\nthe strengthening of the United Nations as the core \r\ninstitution in this area. \r\n The global system for counteracting terrorism \r\ncurrently being shaped cannot be established without \r\nthe involvement of regional and subregional \r\norganizations. This should be taken into account when \r\nadopting measures aimed at combating any \r\nmanifestations of extremism and violence at the \r\nregional and global levels. We regard participation of \r\nregional structures in this process as one of the major \r\nprerequisites for ensuring collective security. Among \r\nthe structures of this nature in our region are the \r\nCommonwealth of Independent States, the Collective \r\nSecurity Treaty Organization and the Shanghai \r\nCooperation Organization. \r\n We believe that long-term success in combating \r\nterrorism and religious extremism depends on the \r\nelimination of the deep-rooted causes of these negative \r\nphenomena, generated by social and economic \r\nproblems in the society. Prevention of illegal drug \r\ntrafficking, which, to a certain extent, serves as a \r\nbreeding ground for terrorism and international crime, \r\nmust become part and parcel of our common struggle \r\nagainst terrorism. In this regard I would like to \r\nreiterate that Tajikistan is prepared to continue a \r\nconstructive dialogue and cooperation with the aim of \r\nestablishing an efficient global partnership to \r\ncounteract the narcotics threat. \r\n It must be said that current efforts at \r\ncounteracting the narcotics threat are not sufficiently \r\neffective. For this reason, we believe that financial and \r\ntechnical assistance to Afghanistan, to be rendered \r\nwithin targeted programmes, and the creation of a \r\nmodern, efficient and capable Afghan border service to \r\nsafeguard the external borders, including the Afghan-\r\nTajik border, would be a worthy application of the \r\nefforts of the international community in this area. \r\nAlso, within the anti-narcotics partnership, we suggest \r\nenhanced interaction with the Afghan structures with \r\nthe purpose of adopting joint measures to prevent drug \r\ntrafficking across the Afghan-Tajik border. We are \r\nconvinced that these measures could serve as a basis \r\nfor the proposed establishment of the first section of \r\nthe security belt around Afghanistan. Involvement in \r\nthe constructive process of Afghanistan’s neighbours \r\nand factoring in the regional aspects of the post-\r\nconflict rehabilitation of that country may well be key \r\nto the success of the efforts undertaken by the \r\ninternational community. \r\n Today, the regional dimension becomes one of \r\nthe key factors of long-term development. Broad and \r\nconstructive regional economic cooperation in Central \r\nAsia, which possesses considerable natural resources, \r\nis of particular importance at the present juncture. We \r\nbelieve that achieving that goal could enable Central \r\nA/61/PV.19  \r\n \r\n06-53341 14 \r\n \r\nAsia to become self-sufficient in terms of energy, fuel \r\nand food supply and a dynamic, developing region of \r\nthe world. Therefore, we believe that the achievement \r\nof the MDGs should hold a place in the new structure \r\nof global security currently being shaped, and become \r\none of the tools for addressing new challenges and \r\nthreats. Today, as never before, it is becoming \r\nincreasingly obvious that a security policy needs to be \r\nintegrated into development. \r\n The scale of the challenges facing the \r\ninternational community dictates the need to further \r\nstrengthen our Organization. There is no doubt that we \r\nmust do everything we can to make the United Nations \r\nmore effective in dealing with issues of international \r\nsecurity. The collective approach should keep us from \r\nmaking hasty and emotional decisions, since we are \r\ndealing with the Organization responsible for \r\ncollective security, sustainable development and \r\nprotection of human rights. It is with the United \r\nNations, despite some of its imperfections, that \r\nhumanity places its hope for a peaceful and just world \r\norder, for tangible achievements in the fields of \r\ncombating poverty and natural disasters. A responsible \r\nattitude towards the United Nations is in the interests \r\nof each and every Member State. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Vladimir Norov, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Uzbekistan.  \r\n Mr. Norov (Uzbekistan) (spoke in Russian): \r\nWhile acknowledging the unique and irreplaceable role \r\nplayed by the United Nations in international affairs, \r\none still has to recognize the need to reform this \r\ninstitution according to present-day realities. Let me \r\nbriefly dwell upon our vision of these reforms. \r\n It is necessary to significantly increase the \r\nefficiency of the United Nations management, which \r\nmust set itself realistic and feasible objectives and \r\nrapidly respond to challenges and threats. The reform \r\nof the Organization must reflect the principles of \r\nsovereign equality and non-interference in internal \r\naffairs and strengthen the equal cooperation between \r\nStates. It must be based upon the principles of broad \r\ninternational consensus. \r\n The General Assembly needs to concentrate on \r\ndesigning constructive ways of addressing the \r\nproblems of regional and global security, which affect \r\nthe interests of the majority of the Member States. \r\nMuch attention should be given to questions of post-\r\nconflict rehabilitation and combating terrorism. The \r\nUnited Nations should assume a coordinating role in \r\nthese spheres using the support of all Member States. \r\nSuch an approach will contribute to strengthening the \r\nOrganization’s ability to meet contemporary \r\nchallenges. \r\n Security Council reform must ensure the fair \r\ngeographical and regional representation of both \r\ndeveloped and developing States whose authority has \r\nbeen acknowledged by the international community \r\nand who play an important role in addressing the main \r\ntasks facing the Organization today. \r\n The international community is about to make a \r\ndecision on an important issue — the election of the \r\nnew Secretary-General. Considering the principle of \r\nrotation and the increasing political weight and \r\neconomic significance of the Asian countries, the \r\nRepublic of Uzbekistan fully supports the view that a \r\nrepresentative from the Asian group should assume that \r\npost. We support the candidature of the Minister \r\nforForeign Affairs and Trade of South Korea, Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon.  \r\n The international community places its hopes on \r\nthe newly established Human Rights Council, which is \r\ncalled upon to improve the work of the United Nations \r\nin the field of human rights. It is important not to allow \r\nthe Council to be used as a tool for promoting the \r\ninterests of certain countries to the detriment of others. \r\nOnly by stopping the practice of double standards, \r\npoliticization and confrontation can we turn that body \r\ninto the forum for equal and open dialogue, enjoying \r\nthe trust of all Member States. The work of that United \r\nNations body must be guided by objective and \r\nunbiased assessment of human rights issues. It must \r\nassist in elaborating constructive solutions to all \r\nproblems that arise, instead of being used for political \r\npurposes. \r\n The fundamental changes in today’s world are \r\naccompanied by the emergence of new challenges and \r\nthreats. At present, terrorism, extremism and drug \r\naggression pose a great danger to the sustainable \r\ndevelopment of States and peoples of the world. \r\n The principal approaches of the Republic of \r\nUzbekistan towards addressing these and other \r\nproblems of security include the following points. \r\n Uzbekistan firmly supports the United Nations \r\nGlobal Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288), \r\n A/61/PV.19\r\n \r\n15 06-53341 \r\n \r\nadopted by the General Assembly on 8 September \r\n2006. Terrorism is not acceptable in any of its forms \r\nand manifestations. The fight against terrorism can be \r\neffective and efficient only by eliminating its causes, \r\nthe first of which is the ideological and extremist \r\ncentres that finance and direct the forces of \r\ninternational terrorism. We must also design common \r\napproaches to assessing this, the most dangerous \r\nphenomenon of today’s world. \r\n A universal convention on international terrorism \r\ncould become an effective basis for joint counteraction \r\nagainst the threat of terrorism. This instrument must be \r\nof a non-discriminatory nature, exclude the policy of \r\ndouble standards and call upon States for concerted \r\naction in countering the ideologies of extremism. \r\n Maintenance of regional and global security is \r\nnot possible without establishing comprehensive peace \r\nand stability in Afghanistan. One way to resolve the \r\nAfghan problem and restore a peaceful and neutral \r\nAfghanistan is effective and real progress in \r\nimplementing concrete projects, funded by the \r\ninternational community, in the social, economic and \r\nhumanitarian spheres — those spheres that can affect \r\nattitudes among the long-suffering people of \r\nAfghanistan. \r\n A fundamental strategy review and more efficient \r\ncoordination are required in combating one of the most \r\ndangerous problems: drug production and drug \r\ntrafficking. \r\n Uzbekistan, as an initiator of a nuclear-weapon-\r\nfree zone in the region, together with its neighbours, is \r\ndoing everything possible to strengthen the global \r\nnuclear non-proliferation regime. On 8 September 2006 \r\nin Semipalatinsk, the Central Asia Nuclear-Weapon-\r\nFree Zone Treat was signed. That initiative, put \r\nforward by the President of the Republic of \r\nUzbekistan, Islam Karimov, is a concrete contribution \r\nof the States in the region to strengthening the global \r\nnon-proliferation process and also to creating a solid \r\nsystem of regional security. Uzbekistan calls upon \r\nnuclear powers to accede to the protocol on security \r\nguarantees annexed to the Central Asia Nuclear-\r\nWeapon-Free Zone Treaty as soon as possible. I wish \r\nto take this opportunity to express gratitude to the \r\nUnited Nations for its assistance in realizing this \r\ninitiative. \r\n Mr. Sow (Guinea), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n In closing, I express my sincere hope that the \r\nresults of the work of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-first session will contribute to the successful \r\nrealization of the joint efforts of the Member States in \r\nthe struggle against threats and challenges to global \r\nsecurity and to furthering the peaceful development of \r\npeoples. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Fiorenzo Stolfi, Minister \r\nfor Foreign and Political Affairs and Economic \r\nPlanning of the Republic of San Marino.  \r\n Mr. Stolfi (San Marino) (spoke in Italian: \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): On behalf of \r\nthe Government and the people of the Republic of San \r\nMarino, I wish to congratulate Her Excellency Haya \r\nRashed Al-Khalifa on her election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-first session. I am \r\nconfident that her abilities and expertise will be key to \r\nthe success of this session. Along with my satisfaction \r\non the election to such a high position of a woman after \r\nso many years, I add my best wishes. \r\n I also wish to thank the outgoing President, \r\nMr. Jan Eliasson, for his valuable work and total \r\ncommitment and resolve in implementing the reform \r\nprogramme started by the Secretary-General. \r\n The Republic of San Marino firmly believes that \r\nthe role of the United Nations needs strengthening in \r\norder to enable the Organization to operate as \r\nefficiently as possible and with optimal coordination \r\namong its bodies. With special reference to the General \r\nAssembly, the most important decision-making body of \r\nthe United Nations, San Marino believes that it should \r\nfocus more closely on the actual implementation of its \r\nresolutions and create mechanisms to make its \r\ndecisions more binding. \r\n For the small and medium-sized countries that \r\nrepresent the majority of the Member States, the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly — the main and \r\nsometimes only forum in which they can make their \r\nvoice heard — is essential. Indeed, the General \r\nAssembly is the organ that fully implements the \r\nprinciples of democracy and equal representation upon \r\nwhich this Organization is founded. \r\n There is no doubt that Security Council reform is \r\nthe other major objective of the United Nations. San \r\nMarino believes that it is necessary to resume dialogue. \r\nIn our opinion, the new Security Council should be \r\nA/61/PV.19  \r\n \r\n06-53341 16 \r\n \r\nfounded upon a flexible base so that it can adjust \r\nappropriately to future changes. The enlargement and \r\ndemocratization of the Council can only improve peace \r\nprocesses and thereby the defence of the weakest \r\nMember States. \r\n San Marino also expresses its deep satisfaction \r\nwith the new Human Rights Council, which is already \r\nfully operational. We hope that there will be a clear \r\ndivision of tasks between the Human Rights Council \r\nand the General Assembly in order to avoid duplication \r\nand ensure complementarity and efficiency in a \r\nbalanced relationship and mutual independence. \r\n San Marino followed with great interest the \r\nintense negotiations leading to the adoption on 30 June \r\nof the resolution on the follow-up to the 2005 World \r\nSummit, including the Millennium Development \r\nGoals, and fully endorses the call of the President of \r\nthe Assembly to focus attention at this general debate \r\non setting up a global partnership for development. \r\nThat goal is a fundamental step towards the eradication \r\nof poverty and the achievement of the other \r\nMillennium Goals. To do so, however, cooperation at \r\nall levels is essential and San Marino is ready to make \r\nits own concrete contribution. \r\n The development goals are also the key points of \r\nthe programme that San Marino will present when it \r\nassumes the chairmanship of the Committee of \r\nMinisters of the Council of Europe in mid-November. \r\nDuring its chairmanship, which is extremely important \r\nto the Republic, San Marino will also address other \r\nglobal issues, such as intercultural and interreligious \r\ndialogue. \r\n The Republic of San Marino, in line with its \r\ncenturies-old history of peace, democracy and freedom, \r\nis particularly sensitive to the need, in today’s \r\ninternational context characterized by growing tensions \r\nand violent contrasts, to promote dialogue among \r\ncultures and religions based on respect for diversity \r\nand universally recognized human rights. \r\n In that regard, I wish to reiterate the \r\ndetermination of the Government and institutions of \r\nSan Marino to guarantee all possible support to the \r\ninternational community for the achievement of those \r\nobjectives. It is in that spirit that my country has \r\nconsistently demonstrated its solidarity with the most \r\ndisadvantaged people and circumstances and has \r\nacceded to legal instruments particularly important to \r\nthe promotion and achievement of international \r\ncooperation in the search for dialogue and the \r\naffirmation of the principles of tolerance and \r\nunderstanding. Thus, intercultural and interreligious \r\ndialogue constitutes the basis of any peace process and \r\nthe most powerful tool to reject all forms of extremism, \r\nwhich unfortunately, as we know, often turns into \r\nterrorism. \r\n During our chairmanship of the Committee of \r\nMinisters, to begin in November, I will seek to \r\norganize a meeting with the Assembly on that \r\nimportant subject. \r\n In that context, we cannot but think of the Middle \r\nEast, in particular the situation in Lebanon, where the \r\nUnited Nations is committed to a new difficult peace \r\nmission, which we sincerely hope will have a \r\nsuccessful outcome. Only a year ago, San Marino \r\nexpressed from this rostrum its confidence and hope in \r\nthe peace process and in the good will of the parties \r\ninvolved in the protracted conflict. After a series of \r\nviolent attacks, mostly against civilians and innocent \r\npeople, as always, the only achievement so far has \r\nbeen an unstable ceasefire. To help alleviate that \r\nsuffering, San Marino has decided, in line with its \r\ncenturies-old tradition of solidarity, to offer a special \r\ncontribution for humanitarian aid in Lebanon. \r\n San Marino has welcomed with great satisfaction \r\nthe establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission as \r\nthe ideal institutional response to post-conflict \r\nsituations. The history of my country is deeply rooted \r\nin the values of peaceful coexistence among all \r\npeoples, and the newly elected Government has \r\ndecided to include in its programme, for the first time, \r\na specific mandate for peace. The objective is to \r\npromote, also in collaboration with volunteer \r\nassociations and by supporting international \r\ncooperation, any useful initiative to affirm and \r\nsafeguard that important objective. \r\n Therefore, the institutions of San Marino, in \r\nresponse to the United Nations appeal, decided to \r\ncelebrate the International Day of Peace on \r\n21 September. That occasion was also marked by the \r\nopening of a public subscription to raise funds for the \r\nvictims of conflicts to be devolved to the Office of the \r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. \r\n My country will guarantee its active support for \r\nthe Pan-European Campaign on Violence against \r\nWomen, in particular domestic violence, which will be \r\nlaunched during San Marino’s chairmanship of the \r\n A/61/PV.19\r\n \r\n17 06-53341 \r\n \r\nCommittee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, in \r\nparallel with the celebration of the International Day \r\nfor the Elimination of Violence against Women. \r\nMoreover, it will strongly support the development of \r\nthe Council of Europe programme “Building a Europe \r\nfor and with Children”. \r\n Another particularly important occasion will be \r\nthe participation of San Marino in the United Nations \r\nGlobal Youth Leadership Summit, which will examine \r\nthe contribution of young people to the achievement of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals, with particular \r\nreference to sport, development and peace, and will \r\nprovide the youth organizations with the necessary \r\nguidelines for future action. \r\n San Marino greatly appreciates the successful \r\noutcome of the work of the group established to draft \r\nan international convention on the protection of \r\npersons with disabilities. Indeed, my country is \r\nbecoming increasingly aware of and attentive to the \r\nproblems and rights of disabled people. In this regard, \r\nonly two weeks ago, the San Marino Parliament \r\napproved an agenda inviting the Government to sign \r\nand ratify the Convention as soon as possible and to \r\ntake measures in support of the principles contained \r\ntherein. \r\n Let me underscore how, despite all the difficulties \r\nand divisions, the United Nations still demonstrates its \r\nability to put in place all initiatives and activities \r\nwhich are at the core of its very existence. It is, \r\ntherefore, a duty for all States to keep alive the flame \r\nof ideals and the determination that constitute the \r\nfoundations of the Organization’s identity and, at the \r\nsame time, the crucial point of reference for all of our \r\nactions, both at the national level and also in terms of \r\ninternational cooperation. \r\n Prompted by this conviction, and strongly \r\ncommitted to guaranteeing a constant and constructive \r\ncontribution, we would like to express our best wishes \r\nto the President, to the Secretary-General — to whom \r\nwe reiterate our most sincere appreciation and highest \r\nesteem for his dedicated commitment during these \r\nyears at the helm of the United Nations — and to all \r\ncolleagues and representatives who share the same \r\nconviction. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Saleh Said Meky, \r\nMinister of Health of Eritrea. \r\n Mr. Meky (Eritrea): On behalf of the \r\nGovernment and people of the State of Eritrea, I avail \r\nmyself of this opportunity to extend to Ms. Haya \r\nRashed Al-Khalifa, and to the Government and people \r\nof the Kingdom of Bahrain, my sincere congratulations \r\non her election as President of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-first session. I also wish to express our \r\nappreciation to Mr. Jan Eliasson of Sweden, who \r\npresided over the sixtieth session of the Assembly, for \r\nhis dedication and skilful leadership during the past \r\nyear. \r\n For reasons of brevity, I do not wish to dwell on \r\ngeneric themes of global economic development, \r\nUnited Nations reforms and other issues of interest that \r\nhave been addressed comprehensively by many \r\nspeakers with whom we share similar views. I shall \r\ninstead focus on cardinal issues of peace and security \r\nthat remain of paramount importance to my country \r\nand the Horn of Africa region as a whole. \r\n In this respect, allow me, Sir, to bring to the \r\nattention of this Assembly, for the umpteenth time, \r\nEthiopia’s reckless flouting of international law that is \r\nthreatening peace and security in our region. It is \r\npainful for my Government to harp on the same theme \r\nat every Assembly session for the past four years. But \r\nthese are the sad facts of a perilous reality imposed on \r\nmy country. In the event, we are duty bound to press \r\nfor and exhaust all legal processes to stave off \r\ndangerous consequences before it is too late. \r\n As the Assembly is aware, demarcation of the \r\nboundary between Eritrea and Ethiopia remains stalled, \r\nmore than four years after the legal award, owing to \r\nEthiopia’s rejection of the final and binding arbitration \r\ndecision. Ethiopia’s conduct is contrary to the terms \r\nand conditions of the Algiers Peace Agreement. Indeed, \r\narticle 4.15 of the Agreement stipulates as follows: \r\n  “The parties agree that the delimitation and \r\ndemarcation determinations of the Commission \r\nshall be final and binding. Each Party shall \r\nrespect the border so determined, as well as the \r\nterritorial integrity and sovereignty of the other \r\nparty”. \r\n It must be stressed that there is no equivocation \r\nor ambiguity in the general provisions of this \r\nAgreement. Yet, Ethiopia has violated the core of the \r\nAlgiers Peace Agreement with impunity. And, it has \r\ncontinued to occupy, by force, the sovereign territory \r\nof a United Nations Member State for the past four \r\nA/61/PV.19  \r\n \r\n06-53341 18 \r\n \r\nyears, in violation of that Agreement and Article 2, \r\nparagraph 4, of the United Nations Charter. \r\n How and why did this happen? \r\n To single out Ethiopia as the primary and only \r\nculprit would be missing the forest for the woods. The \r\nfact is that Ethiopia has neither the power nor the \r\npolitical skill to defy international law for even a single \r\nday, let alone for four long years. If it has done so for \r\nthe past four years, it is simply because its unlawful \r\nconduct has been, and continues to be, encouraged and \r\nsupported by certain Powers in the Security Council. \r\n This poignant state of affairs is best exemplified \r\nby the following three instances. First, when three \r\nyears ago, in September 2003, Ethiopia’s Prime \r\nMinister sent an ominous letter to the Security Council \r\nannouncing his Government’s blatant rejection of the \r\nBoundary Commission decision and calling for a “new \r\nmechanism” outside the Commission to overrule the \r\nlegal award, the Secretary-General and the Council \r\nchose to accommodate Ethiopia’s unlawful conduct. \r\nThis happened in spite of the fact that the Council is \r\nthe main guarantor of the Algiers Peace Agreement and \r\nhas treaty obligations to maintain the integrity of the \r\nlegal decision. It must be recalled that the Council is \r\nexplicitly empowered, by article 14 of the same \r\nagreement, to invoke Chapter VII of the United \r\nNations Charter to ensure compliance by the parties. \r\n As it happened, the Secretary-General and the \r\nCouncil opted for the wrong path and appointed a \r\nSpecial Envoy, in contravention of the legal agreement. \r\nThe demarcation process has thus been stymied for the \r\npast four years at huge financial cost to the \r\ninternational community and inestimable cost in terms \r\nof lost opportunity and heightened tension for the \r\npeoples of Eritrea and Ethiopia. \r\n Secondly, when this Special Envoy scheme \r\nproved unworkable, the United States Government \r\nemployed its full diplomatic clout to unlawfully alter \r\nand modify the legal Award under the rubric of a “new \r\ninitiative”. This time around, the United States dropped \r\nall pretensions of influencing the demarcation process \r\nfrom without, through an external envoy wearing a \r\nUnited Nations mantle. The current plan consists of \r\ndirectly planting a senior expert as an adjunct to the \r\nBoundary Commission and bestowing on him wide \r\npowers to alter the decision in the process of \r\ndemarcation. \r\n Washington’s package further envisages creating \r\na new and political appellate body — outside the \r\nBoundary Commission — to accommodate Ethiopia’s \r\nadditional requests in case of dissatisfaction with the \r\n“alterations” that would be implemented through the \r\nservices of the expert. This United States “diplomatic” \r\nscheme, which in effect renders fundamental tenets of \r\nthe Algiers Peace Agreement null and void, has been \r\ntailored to fully address Ethiopia’s request for an \r\nextrajudicial mechanism when it rejected the Boundary \r\nCommission decision in September 2003. \r\n From the foregoing, one can only surmise that \r\nEthiopia’s original rejection of the award must have \r\nbeen tacitly supported by Washington from the outset. \r\nThe United States Government has even resorted to a \r\nseries of measures against my Government with the \r\napparent purpose of furthering this aim. In this \r\nconnection, I wish to refer particularly to the seizure of \r\nfinancial and other assets of our Embassy in \r\nWashington by the United States Homeland Security \r\nDepartment in contravention of the Vienna Convention \r\non Diplomatic Relations and to avail myself of this \r\noccasion to lodge a complaint on behalf of my \r\nGovernment and to solicit the support of the \r\ninternational community for redress and restitution. \r\n Thirdly, the semi-annual and other periodic \r\nreports of the Secretariat to the Security Council have \r\ninvariably tended to downplay Ethiopia’s violation of \r\nthe Algiers Peace Agreement and the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations. These reports have often tended to \r\napportion equal blame to both parties without \r\ndifferentiation and, particularly in the last two years, to \r\nimpugn Eritrea alone. In this regard, Security Council \r\nresolution 1640 (2005), which the Security Council \r\nadopted in December last year, went so far as to \r\nthreaten imposing punitive measures against Eritrea, \r\nostensibly for curbing the freedom of movement of the \r\nUnited Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea \r\n(UNMEE), while overlooking Ethiopia’s refusal to \r\naccept unconditionally the final and binding decision \r\nof the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission (EEBC).  \r\n This unlawful conduct by Ethiopia is indeed \r\nthreatening to unravel the peace process as a whole. \r\nWe can also cite various instances in which the United \r\nNations Secretariat went out of its way to downplay \r\nunacceptable excesses and infringements of Eritrea’s \r\nsovereignty by UNMEE staff and to blame my \r\nGovernment instead of taking appropriate remedial \r\nmeasures. Incidentally, whether the huge annual \r\n A/61/PV.19\r\n \r\n19 06-53341 \r\n \r\nfinancial outlays for the sustenance of UNMEE are \r\nreally justified and provide value for money spent \r\nremains a critical matter that requires thorough \r\nscrutiny and auditing. \r\n For us, these concerted unwarranted acts belie an \r\noverarching theme. The solemn pledges that we have \r\nheard on this podium from leaders of major Powers on \r\nupholding international justice and the rule of law, like \r\nthe collective commitments to prevent and resolve \r\nconflicts and avoid humanitarian disasters, ring hollow \r\nat the altar of reality. When the chips are down, major \r\nPowers, and especially the United States, continue to \r\npursue their perceived narrow interests at the expense \r\nof regional peace and security and the sovereign rights \r\nof nations and peoples. \r\n Be this as it may, my Government is determined \r\nnot to allow the legal process to be derailed through \r\nvarious subtle subterfuges. Let me recall that Eritrea’s \r\nright of independence was compromised by the United \r\nNations in the 1950s — during the period of African \r\ndecolonization — to serve the interests of the United \r\nStates. Half a century later, we shall not allow any \r\nencroachment of our territorial integrity.  \r\n In addition, as my Government underlined during \r\nthe last meeting of the Boundary Commission, first, the \r\naward that is “final and binding” in accordance with \r\nthe Algiers Peace Agreement should not be tampered \r\nwith under any circumstances. In this connection, \r\nEthiopia’s acceptance of the decision must be \r\nascertained publicly and unequivocally. Secondly, the \r\ndetails and modalities of demarcation must be worked \r\nout in an environment that is free from political \r\ninterference, unlawful and compounding mechanisms, \r\nand loopholes susceptible to distortion. \r\n Allow me now to briefly dwell on the dangerous \r\ndevelopments that are unfolding in Somalia and the \r\nmuddled interpretations, both deliberate and innocent, \r\nthat have gained currency in recent months. We must \r\nrecognize that the current crisis in Somalia derives \r\nfrom multifaceted and cumulative underlying causes \r\nthat have been in place for the past 15 years. Collective \r\nor individual initiatives that will be taken to promote \r\nenduring peace and stability in Somalia must \r\naccordingly address the following parameters if they \r\nare to bear fruit. \r\n First, the daunting problem in Somalia is \r\nessentially an internal political problem that must be \r\nresolved through negotiations among Somali political \r\nforces themselves. In this spirit, my Government \r\nwelcomes the efforts of the Sudanese Government to \r\nfacilitate talks among Somali political forces. \r\n Secondly, the portrayal of recent developments in \r\nSomalia in terms of the global war on terrorism is \r\nfactually untenable and politically imprudent. The \r\noverarching national cause of the Somali people should \r\nnot be reduced to or lumped together with this singular \r\nconcern. \r\n Thirdly, any external military intervention will \r\nfurther polarize the political realities of Somalia and \r\ninduce greater conflagration. Ethiopia’s military \r\nintervention, under whatever guise or justification, is \r\nparticularly dangerous both for reasons of historical \r\nanimosity and because of the events of the past few \r\nyears. It must be understood that there is no consensus \r\nwithin the Intergovernmental Authority on \r\nDevelopment (IGAD) on the modalities, timing and \r\nnature of deploying foreign forces, although the matter \r\nwas comprehensively discussed at ministerial meetings \r\nfor the purposes of contingency planning only. We find \r\nthe African Union’s recent call for deployment of an \r\n8,000-strong peacekeeping force in the absence of a \r\nrobust framework of peace unwise and fraught with \r\nunnecessary complications. Its practicality is also \r\nquestionable in view of the financial and other \r\nchallenges that the African Union Mission in the Sudan \r\n(AMIS) is grappling with in that country. \r\n Fourthly, a recent call by some forces for a \r\nselective lifting of the United Nations embargo on arms \r\nis unbalanced, misguided and fraught with the potential \r\nfor dangerous consequences. Indeed, a selective lifting \r\ncan only imperil the political process of reconciliation \r\nin Somalia and a durable political settlement there. \r\nAccordingly, appropriate adjustments to the arms \r\nembargo in Somalia can be contemplated only when \r\nthere is irreversible progress in the political \r\narrangements giving rise to national institutions that \r\nhave credible legitimacy and popular support. \r\n Fifthly, the challenges for promoting lasting \r\npeace and stability in Somalia are formidable. They \r\nwill be complicated if different actors work, or are seen \r\nto be working, at cross purposes. Closer coordination \r\nand consultation among all interested players must be \r\ncultivated and structured. \r\n Finally, the current situation in Somalia is raising \r\nthe spectre of territorial claims and disputes between \r\nSomalia and its neighbours. Territorial disputes and \r\nA/61/PV.19  \r\n \r\n06-53341 20 \r\n \r\nclaims can only be settled by strict adherence to the \r\nsanctity of colonial boundaries. \r\n Let me conclude by urging caution and prudence \r\nin the international efforts to help resolve the problems \r\nin the Sudan. The truth is that the high price of hasty \r\nand ill-advised policies will ultimately be borne by the \r\npeople of the Sudan and the region as a whole. The \r\ncomplexities of the situation must therefore be gauged \r\ncarefully, and all international efforts must be \r\nharnessed to promote a robust peace package that will \r\nbring about a lasting solution. Focus on short-term \r\narrangements without an overall peace framework will \r\nonly postpone and complicate a lasting solution. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Elmar Maharram \r\noglu Mammadyarov, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nRepublic of Azerbaijan. \r\n Mr. Mammadyarov (Azerbaijan): At the outset, I \r\nwould like to congratulate Ms. Haya Rashed \r\nAl-Khalifa on her election to the presidency of the \r\nsixty-first session of the General Assembly and wish \r\nher every success during her tenure. \r\n I would like also to extend my sincere thanks to \r\nher predecessor, my good friend Mr. Jan Eliasson, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Sweden, for his efforts \r\nand active work with the delegations throughout the \r\nlast session. \r\n The 2005 High-level Plenary Meeting of the \r\nAssembly became an important milestone in the history \r\nof the United Nations. It reaffirmed our faith in the \r\nOrganization and our unwavering interest to make it \r\nstronger and effective. I am pleased to emphasize the \r\npositive moves that we have made since last September \r\non issues such as development, the environment, \r\nHIV/AIDS, Secretariat reform, establishment of the \r\nCentral Emergency Response Fund and the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund.  \r\n The founding of the Peacebuilding Commission \r\nand the Human Rights Council are remarkable \r\nmoments in the history of the United Nations. Yet more \r\nremains to be done to realize our common vision of \r\nsolidarity and collective security, which is premised on \r\nthe shared values and principles of the Charter. \r\n As we move towards such ambitious goals, it is \r\nincreasingly apparent that multilateralism with a strong \r\nUnited Nations at its core remains the only reliable \r\ninstrument for maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity, achieving sustainable development and \r\npromoting respect for human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms. \r\n Strengthening the deliberative and decision-\r\nmaking authority of the General Assembly, which \r\nrepresents the views of all Member States, is key to the \r\nsuccessful implementation and effectiveness of the \r\nreforms. \r\n Azerbaijan believes that reform of the Security \r\nCouncil should not be confined to enlargement of its \r\nmembership. We stand for the rationalization of the \r\nCouncil’s working methods, greater transparency in \r\ndecision-making, accountability in performance and \r\nfull implementation of its resolutions. \r\n The election of the new Secretary-General is an \r\nevent of the utmost importance for the Organization. It \r\nhas already been revealed to suffer from a number of \r\ndeficiencies and requires greater transparency and \r\ninclusion of the wider membership. Azerbaijan \r\nbelieves that the new head of the United Nations \r\nshould clearly recognize the trends and challenges \r\nfaced by the international community at the beginning \r\nof the twenty-first century. \r\n Azerbaijan regrets that the late response of the \r\nSecurity Council to the evolving crisis in the Middle \r\nEast allowed the humanitarian tragedy to unfold. In \r\nthat regard, implementation of the measures contained \r\nin Security Council resolution 1701 (2006), including \r\nthose related to the Lebanese Government’s seven-\r\npoint peace plan, is very important for bringing durable \r\npeace to the Middle East. Azerbaijan will continue its \r\nefforts to contribute to the peaceful resolution of the \r\nconflict and alleviate the sufferings of civilians in \r\nLebanon. \r\n I would like to express profound support for the \r\nStates that have fallen victim to terrorist attacks. While \r\nstrongly condemning terrorism in all its forms and \r\nmanifestations and reaffirming our commitment to \r\njointly fight that global scourge, we register our serious \r\nconcern over attempts to link terrorism to the Islamic \r\nreligion, culture or people. \r\n There is a dire need to stop and reverse a growing \r\ntendency towards Islamophobia in the world. \r\nAzerbaijan, in its capacity as Chairman of the \r\nMinisterial Council of the Organization of the Islamic \r\nConference (OIC) calls upon Member States to \r\nundertake concrete measures to enhance dialogue and \r\n A/61/PV.19\r\n \r\n21 06-53341 \r\n \r\nbroaden understanding among nations, cultures and \r\nreligions by promoting tolerance and respect for \r\nfreedom of religion and belief. It is of vital importance \r\nto raise public awareness about the tenets and values of \r\nIslam worldwide, including in the Muslim societies. To \r\nthat end, we plan to host in Baku in 2007, under the \r\naegis of the OIC, an international conference on the \r\nrole of the mass media in developing tolerance and \r\nmutual understanding. \r\n The situation in the occupied territories of \r\nAzerbaijan has recently become a subject of urgent \r\nconsideration by the General Assembly, due to the \r\nmassive fires occurring in those territories. The \r\nAssembly adopted without a vote a resolution stressing \r\nthe necessity to conduct an urgent environmental \r\noperation with a view to suppressing the fires, \r\novercoming their detrimental impact and rehabilitating \r\nthe affected territories. The resolution has a two-fold \r\npurpose. On the one hand, it envisages a number of \r\npractical steps, including an assessment of the short- \r\nand long-term impact of the fires on the environment \r\nas a step in preparation for the environmental \r\noperation, counteracting the environmental degradation \r\nof the region, and the rehabilitation of the fire-affected \r\npart of the occupied territories of Azerbaijan. On the \r\nother, it serves as an unprecedented example of \r\nengaging the parties to the conflict, particularly \r\nArmenia and Azerbaijan, in a joint environmental \r\noperation to be carried out directly in the fire-affected \r\nzone. The implementation of the resolution will \r\ncontribute to establishing an atmosphere of trust and \r\nconfidence and will give positive impetus to the \r\nnegotiation process. \r\n Sadly, that is the only positive development so far \r\nand cannot be attributed to the overall situation \r\nconcerning the settlement process. Although no \r\nsubstantial progress has been registered so far, the \r\nparties and mediators have accepted the stage-by-stage \r\napproach in the settlement process as the only possible \r\noption. Basically, there are two main issues on which \r\nthe parties disagree — the definition of the status of \r\nself-rule for the population of the occupied Nagorny \r\nKarabakh region and the withdrawal of Armenian \r\nforces from all the occupied territories of Azerbaijan. \r\n There is a common understanding that the status \r\ncannot be defined today. It should be elaborated \r\nthrough a peaceful, democratic and legal process with \r\nthe direct participation and consent of both Azerbaijani \r\nand Armenian communities of the Nagorny Karabakh \r\nregion. To that end, the Armenian occupying forces \r\nhave to withdraw from the occupied territories and the \r\nnecessary conditions have to be in place to allow the \r\nsecure and dignified return of the indigenous \r\nAzerbaijani displaced persons to the Nagorny \r\nKarabakh region and the surrounding territories of \r\nAzerbaijan. \r\n Such a logical chain of events will establish the \r\nnecessary conditions for the next stage of the \r\nsettlement, which is normalizing life in the conflict-\r\naffected area, restoring intercommunal relations, \r\nlaunching socio-economic development and \r\nconsidering appropriate models of self-rule for the \r\nentire population of the region within Azerbaijan. \r\n Our position is based on relevant resolutions of \r\nthe Security Council and decisions of the Organization \r\nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe, which \r\nunequivocally demand the unconditional withdrawal of \r\nthe occupying forces from all occupied territories of \r\nthe Republic of Azerbaijan, the restoration of its \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity, the creation of \r\nfavourable conditions for the safe return of the civilian \r\npopulation, the restoration of intercommunal relations, \r\nand the elaboration of the status of self-government \r\nwithin a democratic and legal process, based on the \r\nagreement of both communities of the region. \r\n It is difficult to hope for a breakthrough in the \r\nnegotiations when Armenia rejects face-to-face \r\nmeetings and refuses to take a constructive approach to \r\nsolving existing problems. What is more worrisome is \r\nthat Armenia is attempting to support by all available \r\nmeans the separatist regime established under its \r\ncontrol in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan and to \r\nspread myths and legends about the historical past and \r\nthe alleged democratic and economic achievements of \r\nthe regime. As a matter of fact, the reality on the \r\nground proves the opposite. The Armenian community, \r\nwhich is the only remaining part of the entire \r\npopulation of the Nagorny Karabakh region of \r\nAzerbaijan, is increasingly inclined to leave the \r\nunrecognized quasi-entity due to worsening living \r\nconditions and the lack of any prospect of economic \r\nand social development. \r\n The dynamics of development of the entire region \r\nare strikingly evident, and in five or 10 years the \r\neconomic growth of the region vis-à-vis Armenia will \r\nbe much more impressive. It could be given a chance \r\nto join ongoing regional and transnational projects, but \r\nA/61/PV.19  \r\n \r\n06-53341 22 \r\n \r\nprior to that Yerevan has to take a number of steps to \r\nestablish normal relations with its neighbours. \r\n The first plenary meetings of the Assembly under \r\nthe presidency of Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa \r\nwere marked by an extremely difficult debate over an \r\nissue that was procedural in nature, but had a \r\nsubstantial political bearing. I join my colleagues from \r\nthe States members of the Georgia, Ukraine, \r\nAzerbaijan, Moldova Organization for Democracy and \r\nEconomic Development (GUAM) in commending her \r\nwisdom and efforts aimed at ensuring that the rules of \r\nthis house serve the interests of all Member States. \r\nProcedural disadvantages should not constrain the \r\nMember States from bringing critical issues affecting \r\ntheir security to the attention of the Assembly. \r\n The GUAM heads of State, in their Joint \r\nDeclaration on the issue of conflict settlement, called \r\nupon States and international organizations to further \r\nfacilitate, within their competence, conflict settlement \r\nprocesses in the GUAM area. Therefore, the inclusion \r\nof the new item on conflicts in the GUAM area in the \r\nagenda of the General Assembly is an attempt to raise \r\nthe awareness of the Assembly of dangerous \r\ndevelopments emerging from those unresolved \r\nconflicts. \r\n The pledges we have made to promote better \r\nstandards of living in larger freedom nourish the faith \r\nof people around the world in future positive change \r\nand development. Hence, there is no greater imperative \r\nthan to fulfil the development agenda and to strengthen \r\nglobal partnership for development. \r\n Azerbaijan is convinced that national \r\ndevelopment strategies should be a principal \r\nframework of development cooperation and support. \r\nEfficiency in the implementation process cannot be \r\nachieved unless it employs measures targeted at \r\nincreasing the self-sufficiency of countries in the long \r\nrun, inter alia, through knowledge, capacity-building, \r\ninfrastructure development and market access and, \r\nultimately, by reducing their dependence on foreign \r\naid. A favourable global economic situation remains a \r\nprerequisite for the success of national development \r\nstrategies, macroeconomic policies and, eventually, the \r\neconomic and financial stability and growth of \r\ncountries. \r\n Azerbaijan believes that international \r\norganizations should support the efforts of countries to \r\nimprove and sustain their economic performance. We \r\nlook forward to the contribution of the United Nations \r\nwith a stronger and more effective Economic and \r\nSocial Council capable of effectively discharging its \r\nnewly assigned functions. \r\n Let me now describe the economic outlook for \r\nAzerbaijan and its experience in enhancing growth, \r\ndevelopment and social well-being. In the light of \r\ntrends in 2005, gross domestic product is expected to \r\nincrease by 30.5 per cent in 2006, driven by oil and gas \r\nproduction and exports. In 2006, State spending has \r\nbeen increased by up to 65 per cent, a large proportion \r\nbeing spent on the public sector and infrastructure. The \r\nkey challenge facing the Government is to create a \r\nfavourable environment for investment in the non-oil \r\nsector and to diversify exports. To achieve this \r\nobjective, it must keep domestic reforms on track and \r\nstrive to strengthen the business environment. \r\n The year 2006 marked a historic moment for the \r\nregion and beyond, with the official inauguration of the \r\nBaku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) oil pipeline. We are \r\nlooking forward to completion of the Baku-Tbilisi-\r\nErzerum natural gas pipeline this fall and remain \r\ncommitted to contributing to global energy security. At \r\nthe same time, we are actively developing \r\ntransregional infrastructure projects, in particular the \r\nBaku-Tbilisi-Kars railroad, which has been recognized \r\nas an important addition to the East-West and North-\r\nSouth transportation corridors. \r\n Last but not least, the establishment of the \r\nHuman Rights Council marked a critical step towards \r\nenhancing the universal system for promoting and \r\nprotecting human rights worldwide. The Council has \r\nbeen endowed with the necessary mandate to give \r\nhuman rights the central role foreseen by the Charter, \r\nand its status is that of a subsidiary body of the General \r\nAssembly. We have to build effective mechanisms, \r\nsuch as universal periodic review, special procedures \r\nand a complaints procedure within the Council. As a \r\nnewly elected member of the Human Rights Council, \r\nAzerbaijan reiterates its readiness to cooperate with \r\nother Member States in order to ensure that the new \r\nCouncil becomes an effective body guided by the \r\nprinciples of universality, objectivity and non-\r\nselectivity and that it bases its activity on constructive \r\nand transparent dialogue and cooperation. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Abdurrahman \r\nMohamed Shalghem, Secretary of the General People’s \r\n A/61/PV.19\r\n \r\n23 06-53341 \r\n \r\nCommittee for Foreign Liaison and International \r\nCooperation of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. \r\n Mr. Shalghem (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke \r\nin Arabic): My delegation has already congratulated \r\nthe President on her assumption of her high office. I \r\nwould like to reaffirm our confidence in her ability to \r\naccomplish her task and to lead our deliberations to a \r\nsuccessful conclusion. I also wish to express our \r\ngratitude to her predecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, Foreign \r\nMinister of Sweden, for his conduct of the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly during the previous session. Lastly, \r\nwe are indebted to the Secretary-General for his efforts \r\nto advance the process of reform at the United Nations \r\nand fulfilment of the purposes and principles of its \r\nCharter. \r\n Last year our efforts were focused on reform. \r\nSome progress has now been made, and we have \r\nestablished the Human Rights Council and the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission. However, there is still a \r\nlong way to go, since any reform that does not include \r\nthe Security Council and enhance the role of the \r\nGeneral Assembly will be of little value and will not \r\nmeet the expectations of our peoples. \r\n Unfortunately, our quest for reform of the \r\nSecurity Council has met with further encroachment by \r\nthe Council on the functions and powers with which \r\nthe General Assembly was endowed by the Charter. It \r\nis therefore incumbent on the Assembly to take \r\nimmediate action to prevent the Council from \r\ninfringing further on its authority. \r\n We also take this opportunity to call on the \r\npermanent members of the Security Council not to \r\nhamper the reform efforts but rather to promote a \r\ngenuine reform of the Organization. Such reform \r\nshould place the power of decision-making in the \r\nhands of all members of the Assembly, a forum in \r\nwhich all States are entitled to vote. The Security \r\nCouncil will then become an executive tool for \r\nimplementing the decisions of the Assembly. We can \r\nthus remedy the current situation in which the Council \r\nhas become a domineering and inequitable body, \r\napplying double standards, lacking democracy and \r\nopen to abuse of the veto.  \r\n History bears witness to the fact that the Council \r\nhas never achieved peace and security in the world. On \r\nthe contrary, it has served as a tool for aggression and \r\nwars and for the curtailment of peace mechanisms. \r\nConsequently, it is the General Assembly, in which all \r\nthe peoples of the world are represented, that should \r\ntake decisions on peace and war, and the power to \r\napply Chapter VII of the Charter should be vested \r\nsolely in the Assembly. The Security Council, with its \r\nlimited membership, cannot be entrusted with such \r\nmomentous decisions. \r\n If we fail to agree on such a change, we must find \r\na new formula for granting permanent membership of \r\nthe Council. Permanent membership should be \r\nconferred on geographical groups rather than specific \r\ncountries. We therefore demand that the African Union \r\nbecome a permanent member of the Security Council, \r\nas Africa is the only continent without a permanent seat \r\non the Council. \r\n More than three decades ago, Libya called for \r\nabolition of the veto. It submitted draft resolutions on \r\nthis subject at the thirty-fourth session of the General \r\nAssembly and the six following sessions. Libya holds \r\nthat this prerogative of the permanent members is the \r\ngreatest of the obstacles preventing the Council from \r\nfulfilling its mandate. It therefore renews its call for \r\nabolition of the veto and urges the Assembly to take \r\nsteps to restrict use of the veto until it is finally \r\nabolished. Within the framework of the current \r\nconsultations on reform of the Council, we would like \r\nto reaffirm Libya’s adherence to the common African \r\nposition issued by the Fifth African Union Summit, \r\nheld in Sirte, Libya, on 4 and 5 July 2005, and later \r\nconfirmed by the Extraordinary Summit of the African \r\nUnion, held in Addis Ababa on 4 August 2005. \r\n Maintenance of international peace and security \r\nis a noble goal of the United Nations. Undoubtedly, \r\ngeneral and complete disarmament, starting with \r\nweapons of mass destruction, constitutes the essential \r\ncomponent for achievement of this goal, which, \r\nhowever, will remain beyond reach unless all Member \r\nStates cooperate in good faith and in a fully transparent \r\nmanner. Libya has voluntarily abandoned all its \r\nprogrammes related to weapons of mass destruction \r\nand has expressed the hope that all States in possession \r\nof weapons of mass destruction or programmes for \r\nsuch weapons will follow its example. \r\n It is important not to confuse weapons of mass \r\ndestruction and nuclear non-proliferation with \r\nprogrammes for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. \r\nUnder international law, all States have the right to \r\nconduct research and develop their scientific \r\ncapabilities for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. \r\nA/61/PV.19  \r\n \r\n06-53341 24 \r\n \r\nLibya strongly rejects the use of double standards \r\nwhen dealing with this issue and the practice of \r\ndiscrimination between States with respect to nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation. \r\n The establishment of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission is an important step in promoting peace in \r\ncountries emerging from conflict. We hope to see soon \r\nthe achievements of this new body in Africa, where the \r\nAfrican Union has been able, with the assistance of the \r\ninternational community, to achieve peace in several \r\nAfrican countries. African peoples look forward to the \r\nassistance of the United Nations in the consolidation of \r\npeace in order to implement development programmes \r\nand combat poverty, disease and illiteracy. \r\n Terrorism is a phenomenon that threatens \r\ninternational peace and security. Such a threat cannot \r\nbe countered by the action of a single State or group of \r\nStates. Furthermore, it is a problem that cannot be \r\nresolved through attribution to a particular religion or \r\nnationality. It is also shameful and unacceptable to \r\ndescribe the legitimate struggle of a people against \r\nforeign occupation as an act of terrorism. \r\n Libya was among the first States that called for \r\ncoordination of international efforts against \r\ninternational terrorism. Fifteen years ago it called for a \r\nspecial session of the General Assembly to study this \r\nphenomenon and develop measures to combat it and \r\neradicate its root causes. It is high time to respond to \r\nthat call so that we can coordinate our efforts, under \r\nthe auspices of the United Nations, to study this \r\nphenomenon and reach a clear definition of terrorism \r\nthat distinguishes between terrorism and the legitimate \r\nstruggle of peoples for self-determination and \r\nindependence. \r\n The change of the Human Rights Commission \r\ninto the Human Rights Council reflects the great \r\nattention the international community gives to \r\nenforcing human rights and guaranteeing basic \r\nfreedoms. We hope that the inception of this Council’s \r\nwork will constitute a beginning towards addressing \r\nthe issues impartially and non-discriminately, free from \r\nselectivity and double standards. We hope that human \r\nrights issues will not be used as a means of pressure \r\nagainst small nations. We emphasize that attempts by \r\nsome States to use protection of human rights as a \r\npretext to interfere in the internal affairs of other States \r\nwill only lead to the destabilization of peace and \r\nsecurity, causing more problems rather than solving \r\noutstanding ones. \r\n Sustainable development is a major challenge \r\nfacing developing countries. It is incumbent upon the \r\nUnited Nations to establish an international partnership \r\nfor development that aims to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, based on the activation of \r\ndialogue between North and South. All this should be \r\ndone within the framework of respect for sovereignty, \r\nequality and the sharing of benefits, guaranteeing the \r\nachievement of the agreed goal of a 0.7 per cent \r\nallocation of the gross national product of developed \r\ncountries as development assistance to developing \r\ncountries. Furthermore, such a partnership should \r\nguarantee the appropriate application of all principles \r\nof free multilateral trade and the enforcement of all \r\nmeasures related to special and preferential treatment \r\nfor developing countries, within the framework of \r\nWorld Trade Organization, including facilitating the \r\naccession of developing countries to that organization. \r\n Countries with a colonial past bear the greatest \r\nresponsibility for assisting developing countries as \r\ncompensation for the damage caused them during the \r\ncolonial period. The big Powers that waged wars on the \r\nterritories of developing countries must bear \r\nresponsibility for demining and removal of explosive \r\nremnants left in those countries. They should begin \r\nimmediately to provide maps and the necessary \r\ntechnical equipment for the rehabilitation of the \r\naffected lands in some of the developing countries. \r\n The massacres and repression that are committed \r\nby Israeli occupation forces in occupied Palestine \r\nagainst the Palestinian people and the flagrant \r\nviolations of human rights confirm that the so-called \r\npeace process is but a mirage that will not yield any \r\nresults, particularly given the inability of the Security \r\nCouncil to take any action to protect the Palestinian \r\npeople and to compel the occupation force to respect \r\nits commitments and stop its aggression and crimes \r\nagainst the Palestinian people. Libya therefore \r\nreiterates its emphasis that any proposed solutions that \r\nseek to impose a fait accompli will not resolve the \r\nPalestinian question, nor will they provide peace for \r\nthe area. The only solution that can achieve peace is to \r\nguarantee the return of all Palestinian refugees to their \r\nhomes and to establish a democratic State on the land \r\nof historical Palestine, in which Arabs and Jews live on \r\nequal footing, similar to South Africa, where blacks \r\nand whites manage to coexist after decades of conflict \r\n A/61/PV.19\r\n \r\n25 06-53341 \r\n \r\nand bloodshed. Unless that is achieved, the region will \r\ncontinue to live in a state of conflict, in which no one \r\nwill enjoy any peace or security. \r\n The recent Israeli aggression against Lebanon and \r\nits targeting of the infrastructure and civilians there \r\nemphasize the need for urgent action to compel the \r\noccupation forces to withdraw from the Sheba’a farms \r\nand return them to Lebanon. Additionally, urgent \r\naction is needed regarding the withdrawal from and \r\nreturn to Syria of the occupied Syrian Golan. The \r\nIsraelis should be forced to pay reparations for the \r\ndamage they caused in Lebanon due to their brutal \r\naggression. \r\n The situation in brotherly Iraq is a cause of \r\nsadness and concern. It is, in fact, a catastrophe \r\nbrought about by an occupation that has left behind \r\ntens of thousands of dead and hundreds of thousands of \r\nwounded and handicapped persons. No matter how \r\noptimistic we may be, this catastrophic situation will \r\nnot end as long as there are occupation forces in the \r\ncountry, forces that feed divisions inside Iraqi society \r\nand encourage sectarianism in Government institutions. \r\nWe believe it is high time to stop the bloodshed in Iraq \r\nand find a solution to end the crisis so that all Iraqis \r\nmay enjoy peace and security, as well as their basic \r\nrights, in a unified and democratic Iraq enjoying full \r\nsovereignty and free from foreign forces and bases. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Lamin Kaba Bajo, \r\nSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs of the Republic \r\nof the Gambia.  \r\n Mr. Bajo (Gambia): My delegation extends our \r\nheartiest congratulations to Ms. Al-Khalifa on her \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-first session. Her election signifies a most \r\nwelcome rebalancing of the General Assembly towards \r\ngreater gender parity and will certainly bring a breath \r\nof fresh air to our deliberations. We hope also that it \r\nwill help our Organization address those issues of war, \r\nconflict, oppression, deprivation and terrorism that dog \r\ntoday’s world with the kind of compassion and \r\nsensitivity known only to mothers. I would like to \r\nassure her of my delegation’s fullest cooperation and \r\nsupport at all times. \r\n The outgoing President, Mr. Jan Eliasson, applied \r\nall his wisdom and vast diplomatic experience in \r\npresiding over a session fraught with difficult and \r\nexceedingly complex organizational reform issues. We \r\nthank him for guiding us deep into the process and \r\nwish him well in his new assignment. \r\n We should not delude ourselves into thinking that \r\nreforming the United Nations is a task that can be \r\nachieved quickly. The issues are contentious and \r\nmultifaceted, and only deep reflection and determined \r\nnegotiation over time will see us through. For this \r\nreason, we should not feel disheartened that one year \r\nafter the World Summit we have still not concluded the \r\nprocess. We should congratulate ourselves on having \r\nachieved a breakthrough with the establishment of the \r\nHuman Rights Council and the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission. Management reform is problematic, but \r\nthe desire to achieve it in a fair and balanced manner \r\nwill remain a key demand of developing countries. A \r\nselective approach to reforming the Organization will \r\nwork in no one’s interest. Some reforms are long \r\noverdue and sorely needed.  \r\n For us in Africa, Security Council reform is \r\nurgent and must be concluded as soon as possible. \r\nRecent events have demonstrated that the old \r\ndispensation is ill equipped to grapple with the \r\ncomplexities of the world we live in today. Reform, I \r\nrepeat, is urgent if today’s Security Council is to be \r\nseen as poised to take on the new global peace and \r\nsecurity challenges facing mankind. \r\n We are gathered together at a time of great \r\nuncertainty and, for many, despair because of our \r\ncollective inability and lack of will to abide by the \r\nguiding principles of our founding fathers. We have not \r\nbeen too successful in preventing the scourge of war or \r\nin addressing the factors that give rise to war.  \r\n Rather than abating, the situation in the Middle \r\nEast continues to fester and, in fact, deteriorate, as the \r\nRoad Map leading to a two-State solution to the \r\nPalestinian-Israeli problem eludes us further. My \r\ndelegation has repeatedly decried the lack of will on \r\nthe part of the protagonists to work towards a speedy \r\nsolution to this problem, which continues to spawn \r\nmany other conflicts in other regions of the world.  \r\n It is a matter of deep regret that this world body \r\nwatched almost helplessly as a Member State — \r\nLebanon — was attacked and made to suffer extensive \r\ndestruction to infrastructure, property and human life. \r\nAlthough we have been able to bring about a cessation \r\nof hostilities, we cannot claim to have achieved peace. \r\nAll the conditions for a resumption of the conflict \r\nremain intact. We must address those conditions more \r\nA/61/PV.19  \r\n \r\n06-53341 26 \r\n \r\nresolutely. We must also do everything within our \r\npower to ensure that the problem between Hizbollah \r\nand Israel does not pull in other countries of the region \r\nand lead to full scale war between them and Israel. The \r\nconsequences would be disastrous for us all. \r\n My delegation condemns in the strongest terms \r\nIsrael’s continued illegal occupation of Palestinian \r\nterritory and Arab lands, its intensive military \r\ncampaign in the West Bank and Gaza, which has \r\nresulted in untold civilian casualties and extensive \r\ndestruction of infrastructure, and its arrest and \r\ndetention of thousands of Palestinian civilians and their \r\nleaders. The Hamas Government in Palestine was \r\nelected democratically by the Palestinian people, who, \r\nby the tenets of democracy which we all claim to \r\nespouse, are the only ones who may freely choose their \r\nleaders. Or are we to understand that this basic tenet of \r\ndemocracy should apply only if the leaders chosen are \r\nto our liking and meet with our approval? I urge all \r\npeace-loving and democratic members of the \r\ninternational community to assist the Hamas \r\nGovernment to play its role as a representative of its \r\npeople in a responsible, democratic and dignified \r\nmanner. \r\n In Iraq, the unresolved conflict has now become \r\nuncontrollable and has all but degenerated into civil \r\nwar. We must look for imaginative ways of stabilizing \r\nthat situation and bringing the widespread killings, \r\ndestruction and suffering to an end. \r\n We must show leadership. Double standards have \r\naffected the effectiveness of our response to the peace \r\nand security needs of the Middle East for far too long \r\nand have only muddied the waters further. The people \r\nof the region must now enjoy some respite and be \r\ngiven the space to pursue their development in an \r\natmosphere of peace, tranquillity and security. It is \r\nbecoming increasingly clear that the only remaining \r\nhonest broker that can ensure that this happens is the \r\nUnited Nations. We must step up to the plate. \r\n Violence in Afghanistan appears to be re-\r\nescalating. The United Nations must join hands with \r\nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization and other \r\npartners to engage all concerned in dialogue, with a \r\nview to addressing the factors that are driving the \r\nhostilities to which the long-suffering people of this \r\ngreat country are subjected. \r\n While we must obviously intervene to contain \r\nand arrest raging conflicts, we must not be oblivious to \r\nthe need to pay equal attention to nascent conflict \r\nsituations. One such situation is that which is \r\nprevailing across the Taiwan Strait, where the People’s \r\nRepublic of China has openly threatened Taiwan with \r\nmilitary intervention, should it as much as express an \r\nintention to declare itself independent. In addition, the \r\nPeople’s Republic of China has increased its arsenal of \r\nmissiles trained on Taiwan to over 800 warheads. It \r\ngoes without saying that a deterioration of the situation \r\ninto all-out war will only provoke an unwelcome mix \r\nof responses from allies within and without the region, \r\nresponses that could cause a conflagration that would \r\nmake the Middle East situation pale in comparison. \r\n In Africa, the good news is that peace continues \r\nto spread. From Sierra Leone and Liberia to Uganda \r\nand the Democratic Republic of the Congo, we are \r\nwitnessing a growing preference for non-violent \r\napproaches to conflict resolution. We should persist so \r\nthat this trend continues and embraces countries such \r\nas Somalia and the Sudan, with its Darfur imbroglio.  \r\n In Somalia, the central Government should be \r\nassisted to stand firmly on its own two feet and \r\nexercise control over the entire Somali territory. The \r\ninternational community must take every precaution to \r\nprevent Somalia from becoming a haven for terrorists \r\nand other extremists.  \r\n In the case of the Sudan, my delegation appeals \r\nto the brotherly people of that great country to \r\nintensify dialogue with the international community in \r\nits quest for a resolution of the Darfur crisis. In \r\nreaching a final decision on whether or not the African \r\nUnion Mission in the Sudan (AMIS) should pass the \r\nbaton to a United Nations peacekeeping force, we are \r\ncertain that, with a bit more effort on all sides, a way \r\nwill be found out of the present impasse. \r\n While we must all work in concert to fight \r\nterrorism, we must also endeavour not to lose respect \r\nfor fundamental human rights and civil liberties in the \r\nprocess. In addition, we must increase our cooperation \r\nin this fight and strengthen political and diplomatic \r\ninterventions in order to win it. No matter how many \r\nresources or how much firepower are committed to \r\ncombating the phenomenon, without international \r\ncooperation of this type, our efforts will come to \r\nnaught. Recent developments in countries like Iraq \r\nhave shown that to be the case. \r\n Last year, we all rededicated ourselves to the full \r\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration. There \r\n A/61/PV.19\r\n \r\n27 06-53341 \r\n \r\nare ample indications today that the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) are not likely to be met in \r\nmost of sub-Saharan Africa if present trends continue. \r\nIt is clear that we must all do more to identify and help \r\nremove the bottlenecks that are inhibiting progress \r\ntowards them. We must address the serious capacity \r\nconstraints that circumscribe the development efforts \r\nof many an African country. We must help stimulate \r\neconomic growth through enabling policy measures \r\nthat empower our countries for greater and more \r\nmeaningful participation in world trade. We must make \r\nreal progress in the Doha round. We must increase \r\nforeign direct investment in the African economy. We \r\nmust honour our commitment to increasing official \r\ndevelopment assistance to 0.7 per cent of gross \r\nnational income. We must, in partnership, attack the \r\ngreat health scourges of our time, namely, HIV/AIDS \r\nand malaria. \r\n In the Gambia, United Nations and other \r\nindependent assessments indicate that, on many fronts, \r\nwe are making steady progress. We are committed to \r\nachieving the MDGs, in addition to the goals of the \r\nInternational Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment.  \r\n We have reversed the spread of HIV/AIDS. We \r\nhave already achieved gender parity in education and, \r\nby extension, registered significant progress in gender \r\nequality, equity and the empowerment of women. We \r\nhave brought potable water and good sanitation to over \r\n70 per cent of our people. We have reduced the \r\nprevalence of malaria and the incidence of maternal \r\nand under-five mortality. We have attained 100 per cent \r\nchild immunization coverage. We have significantly \r\nincreased access to education at all levels and shall \r\nmeet the basic education goal, God willing, next year \r\nor the year after. Our sharpest focus is on poverty \r\nreduction, and we are determined to attain that goal \r\nbefore 2015. \r\n We have been able to achieve these gains, in spite \r\nof the severe resource constraints that we face, because \r\nof determined and committed leadership and our strong \r\nresolve to live up to our commitments to the \r\ninternational community. \r\n According to the expert assessments of the \r\nUnited Nations agencies, the Gambia is among the very \r\nfew African countries that will achieve the MDGs on \r\ntarget, if present trends continue. Our achievements in \r\nrelation to the development agenda have been made \r\npossible only through strong and genuine partnerships, \r\nwhich we hope will continue and will grow to meet the \r\ntask ahead. \r\n The trade policy of our Government continues to \r\nbe guided by the principles of liberalization, \r\nderegulation and investment promotion. We have \r\nbrought about a progressive reduction of tariffs and \r\ncontinued improvements in infrastructure to increase \r\nour competitiveness as a production and trade gateway \r\ninto West Africa.  \r\n We regard the private sector as an important \r\nengine of growth. Therefore, to further enhance its \r\ndevelopment, our Government has formulated policies \r\nfor the systematic strengthening of the small and \r\nmedium-sized enterprise sector of our economy. It is \r\nour hope that implementation of these policies will \r\nlead to the creation of conditions conducive to the \r\nspeedy attraction of high levels of foreign direct \r\ninvestment which will, in turn, stimulate the growth of \r\nemployment and incomes and lead to significant \r\nreductions in the incidence of poverty among the \r\nGambian people. \r\n We are conscious of the need for all our \r\ndevelopment partners to speak to us with one voice so \r\nas to increase coherence in the partnership. To this end, \r\nwe have this year encouraged our major multilateral \r\npartners — the World Bank, the African Development \r\nBank Group, the International Monetary Fund, the \r\nUnited Nations Development Programme and its \r\nMillennium Project — to work together with us in \r\ncrafting a coherent Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper \r\nwhich will form the basis for a coordinated framework \r\nof partnership in development. \r\n The President returned to the Chair. \r\n There are many commendable programmes and \r\ninitiatives designed to assist countries like the Gambia. \r\nThe Group of Eight initiatives for Africa, the Heavily \r\nIndebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative of the World \r\nBank and the International Monetary Fund, the Blair \r\nCommission for Africa, the Millennium Challenge \r\nAccount and the Third Tokyo International Conference \r\non African Development, inter alia, will have an \r\nimpact only if they do not raise the bar unrealistically \r\nhigh, such that the countries they are meant to assist \r\nare unable to meet the stringent criteria for gaining \r\naccess to the funds. If aid is to be meaningful, it must \r\nbe accessible, predictable and not fragmented. \r\nMoreover, a well-designed aid architecture that \r\nA/61/PV.19  \r\n \r\n06-53341 28 \r\n \r\ninvolves recipients in critical aspects of decision-\r\nmaking is part of the answer for achieving the much-\r\nsought effectiveness of official development assistance, \r\na subject of concern in the Paris Declaration on Aid \r\nEffectiveness. \r\n Yet, while those programmes and initiatives may \r\nencourage many least developed countries in their \r\nhopes for early relief, in reality, the accompanying \r\nenablers have not been forthcoming. The Doha Round \r\nis in limbo, our modest economic growth is being \r\nthreatened by unpredictably high energy prices, and \r\ndebt relief is still on the distant horizon. For many of \r\nus, it is one step forward before world economic trends \r\ntake us two steps back. Of even greater concern is the \r\nfact that this plethora of initiatives has hardly made a \r\ndent in the poverty situation in our countries. The \r\nblueprints are manifold, the responses too few. \r\nUnfulfilled promises only dash our hopes, leave us \r\nfrustrated and diminish our faith in the effectiveness of \r\ninternational partnerships for development. \r\n We in the Gambia continue to deepen our \r\ndemocracy. Just four days ago, the Gambian electorate \r\nwent to the polls to once again choose their leader in a \r\nfree and fair manner. Let me take this opportunity to \r\nconvey the thanks and appreciation of His Excellency \r\nAl Hadji Yahya A. J. J. Jammeh to the many \r\ndelegations that have expressed to him their \r\ncongratulations and best wishes on his resounding \r\nvictory at the elections. The President considers that \r\nvictory to be a mandate from the Gambian electorate to \r\ncontinue his service to the Gambian people and, \r\nindeed, to the international community at large. Our \r\nelectoral process has been acclaimed throughout the \r\nworld for its openness, fairness and transparency. \r\n The subject of the High-level Dialogue held just a \r\nfew days ago was international migration and \r\ndevelopment. For the very first time, we had the \r\ncourage to address that issue within the walls of the \r\nUnited Nations — and rightly so, for international \r\nmigration has been at the core of human history. It has \r\ndriven the spread of human knowledge and civilization. \r\nIt has enriched cultures and societies and caused \r\nmankind to make great leaps in science, technology, \r\nengineering and overall social and economic \r\ndevelopment. We are all migrants. Therefore, let us \r\napproach the issue of international migration with \r\nhumanity, tolerance, respect and compassion. \r\n Attempts to penalize or criminalize international \r\nmigration will not work. In our globalized village, \r\ninternational migration is an undeniable, positive and \r\nindispensable force for keeping the wheels of national \r\neconomies and human society in motion. We must look \r\nto the positive side of this natural human activity and \r\ndesist from actions that trample on the dignity of \r\nmigrants, as well as from acts of racism, xenophobia \r\nand abuse of human rights. \r\n As the saying goes, injustice anywhere is a threat \r\nto justice everywhere. For decades, extensive illegal \r\nand extraterritorial measures have been pursued against \r\nCuba, a small, friendly and democratic nation. They \r\nhave not worked and will never work. My delegation \r\njoins the vast majority of the members of the \r\ninternational community in calling for the lifting of the \r\ndecades-long embargo against Cuba in order to enable \r\nthe hard-working people of that great country to pursue \r\ntheir development aspirations in an atmosphere of \r\npeace. Let us all strive to live and let live.  \r\n By the same token, we must also urgently address \r\nthe question of Taiwan. The legitimate quest of the \r\npeople of Taiwan for a voice and standing in the United \r\nNations must be ignored no longer. Taiwan is an \r\nimportant actor in our global economy and contributes \r\nimmensely to global peace and security. It must be \r\nformally granted recognition as a responsible member \r\nof the international community. A simple way to grant \r\nthat recognition would be to give Taiwan its rightful \r\nplace in the United Nations. \r\n In that connection, the Government of the \r\nGambia wishes to strongly protests the General \r\nCommittee’s violation of the rules of procedure on \r\n12 September this year by amalgamating two items \r\nproposed by its members into one agenda item, thus \r\npreventing members from participating in the \r\ndiscussion of those items. We will therefore require a \r\nlegal opinion from the United Nations on an expedited \r\nbasis to ensure that we are provided with the \r\nopportunity to engage in a debate on that issue, as we \r\nare duly entitled to do.  \r\n Before I conclude, let me salute, commend and \r\nbid farewell to one of Africa’s outstanding \r\npersonalities, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, since \r\nthis will be the last General Assembly session during \r\nhis tenure as Secretary-General. President Al Hadji \r\nYahya Jammeh had the honour to pay tribute to him \r\nduring the Summit of Heads of State and Government \r\n A/61/PV.19\r\n \r\n29 06-53341 \r\n \r\nof the African Union held in Banjul in July. Therefore, \r\nI should like to say only that the Government and the \r\npeople of the Gambia salute his leadership, his astute \r\ndiplomatic skills, his demonstrated commitment to \r\ninternational peace, security and development, and his \r\nunswerving faith in the international system. \r\nMr. Annan’s term as Secretary-General may be ending, \r\nbut I am sure that he will continue to be there for us \r\nand will willingly come to the rescue when we need his \r\nwisdom and vast experience in mediating complex \r\nglobal problems. We wish him well in his future \r\nendeavours, and we wish him and his family continued \r\ngood health and happiness in their new life. \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Antonio Isaac Monteiro, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs and International Cooperation of Guinea-\r\nBissau. \r\n Mr. Monteiro (Guinea-Bissau) (spoke in \r\nPortuguese; interpretation from French text provided \r\nby the delegation): The sixty-first session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly has begun its work in quite a \r\ndisturbing context. We note the persistence of certain \r\nconflicts and the emergence of new hot spots of \r\ntension, which are serious threats to international peace \r\nand stability. World poverty and hunger have not \r\ndecreased, despite the enormous efforts of our \r\ncountries to improve the living conditions of our \r\npopulations. In fact, we note a deterioration in the \r\nsocial and health conditions of millions of people as a \r\nresult of endemic diseases such as HIV/AIDS, \r\ntuberculosis and malaria, particularly on the African \r\ncontinent.  \r\n The political, economic, financial, social and \r\nenvironmental problems facing the world are assuming \r\nincreasingly alarming proportions. That requires \r\nconcerted efforts on the part of the entire international \r\ncommunity. Therefore, we must work together to \r\nstrengthen the existing multilateral system and the \r\ncapacity of the United Nations to act in order to \r\naddress those challenges more effectively. \r\n Our people expect concrete, swift and effective \r\nmeasures from the Organization, involving the \r\nestablishment of modern and efficient operational \r\nstructures. In short, reforms within the United Nations \r\nsystem are necessary and urgent.  \r\n It is in that context that, on behalf of my country, \r\nGuinea-Bissau, which it is my honour to represent, I \r\nwarmly congratulate you, Madam, on your election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at the present \r\nsession. We believe that your many qualities and your \r\nlong experience are guarantees of the success of our \r\nwork. Under your guidance, we will experience a new \r\ndynamism capable of promoting joint efforts for peace. \r\nI would like to assure you of the availability and full \r\ncooperation of our delegation in contributing to the \r\nachievement of the our common goals.  \r\n Allow me to congratulate your predecessor as \r\nwell, Mr. Jan Eliasson, for his dedication to the cause \r\nof our Organization and for the important results \r\nachieved during the sixtieth session. I reference in \r\nparticular to the creation of the Human Rights Council \r\nand the Peacebuilding Commission, of which my \r\ncountry is a member.  \r\n We recently participated in the fourteenth Summit \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement in Havana, where a \r\nlarge number of world leaders gathered. Those eminent \r\npersonalities, including the head of State of Guinea-\r\nBissau, considered the world’s problems, the \r\nseriousness of which calls to us all and demands of us \r\nconcerted and collective actions. The conclusions \r\nreached at the Summit, as well as the initiatives we \r\nintend to undertake on behalf of our Movement, are in \r\nline, to a large extent, with the opinions, \r\nrecommendations and solutions set out by the \r\nSecretary-General in his annual report on the work of \r\nthe Organization, delivered during a brilliant speech to \r\nthe Assembly.  \r\n None today can doubt the seriousness of the \r\nsituation in the Middle East, particularly in Lebanon. It \r\nis the same with regard to the tragic conditions in \r\nwhich millions of our African brothers live in Darfur. It \r\nis clear that we can no longer accept the systematic \r\nviolation of international norms. Nor can we \r\nunderstand why we are incapable of taking concerted, \r\nnegotiated and responsible measures to put an end to a \r\ntragic situation that threatens the lives of innocent and \r\nvulnerable people. Our brothers in Darfur have the \r\nright to the compassion and solidarity of Africa in \r\nparticular, and of the international community as a \r\nwhole.  \r\n If current trends in the world continue, poor \r\ncountries will not be able to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) by 2015. The reforms that \r\nare planned or that have already been introduced into \r\nour systems of governance, respect for the rules of \r\ndemocracy and respect for human rights are, \r\nA/61/PV.19  \r\n \r\n06-53341 30 \r\n \r\nunfortunately, insufficient to achieve the rates of \r\ngrowth essential to relaunch our economies. \r\n In our countries, the economic and financial \r\nsituation depends on internal and external factors that \r\nwe do not control. Protectionist measures and subsidies \r\nfor agricultural products such as cotton, sugar and \r\nwheat seriously compromise the competitive capacity \r\nof our farmers. The absence of an agreement on the \r\nrules that should govern international trade and the \r\nlack of political will and of progress in the negotiations \r\nwithin the World Trade Organization are aggravating \r\nfactors. \r\n We need to recognize that we are far from \r\nachieving the objectives set out in the Monterrey \r\nConsensus and Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, \r\nwhich concern developing countries, particularly the \r\nleast developed countries. We also feel the imbalance \r\nin the globalization process. These are serious \r\nobstacles to our development. The midterm review for \r\nthe Brussels Programme of Action for the Least \r\nDeveloped Countries for the Decade 2001-2010 has \r\nindeed shed new light on the shortcomings and on the \r\nstill-insufficient level of development assistance. In \r\nthis environment, our efforts to eliminate poverty and \r\ncreate better living conditions within our countries are \r\nat risk.  \r\n A large part of our populations, particularly our \r\nyoung people, are more and more despondent because \r\nof the very high level of unemployment and lack of \r\nhope for a better future. Thousands of young people are \r\nso desperate that they even risk their lives to seek other \r\nforms of existence, which, unfortunately, often turn out \r\nto be mirages. The international community must \r\naccord greater attention to this issue so that we might \r\nfind the means to ensure the rebirth of hope in the \r\nhearts of our youth. I am thinking especially of \r\ncreating professional training centres and promoting \r\nactivities that generate jobs, thus ensuring more and \r\nbetter social integration. \r\n I would also like to stress in this regard the \r\nimportance of the High-level Meeting on International \r\nMigration and Development, which for the first time \r\nmet here at the Headquarters of the United Nations. I \r\nam convinced that thanks to this type of dialogue and \r\ncooperation at the international level, we will be better \r\nequipped to put a brake on illegal immigration and on \r\norganized crime, to which this tragic phenomenon is \r\nmore and more linked.  \r\n Guinea-Bissau, with a considerable number of \r\ncitizens living abroad, pays particular attention to the \r\nissue of migration. Therefore we welcome the place it \r\noccupies on the agenda of the international community. \r\nWe support the relevant recommendations emerging \r\nfrom the High-level Dialogue on Migration and \r\nDevelopment that took place here in New York, two \r\nweeks ago. We are aware of the role played by our \r\ndiaspora in the economy of developing countries, \r\nthanks to remittances and other forms of contributions. \r\nMy country is committed to developing an appropriate \r\nnational policy on this issue in cooperation with our \r\ndevelopment partners, especially with the countries of \r\ndestination.  \r\n On 17 July Guinea-Bissau hosted the sixteenth \r\nConference of the Heads of State Community of \r\nPortuguese-speaking Countries (CPLP). The heads of \r\nState of our community reaffirmed their determination \r\nto step up efforts to eradicate hunger and poverty. They \r\nalso committed themselves to undertaking concrete \r\nmeasures to mobilize internal and external resources \r\nfor the achievement of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) by 2015. The consolidation of \r\ndemocracy, the rule of law and human rights issues \r\nwere also subjects of particular attention for these \r\nleaders. They are indispensable preconditions for \r\ninternational peace and security. The heads of State \r\nalso decided to strengthen relations between the CPLP \r\nand the United Nations and its specialized agencies in \r\norder to establish an effective partnership.  \r\n Allow me in this respect to thank, on behalf of \r\nthe CPLP, all our partners for the important assistance \r\nthey have given to the weakest members of our \r\ncommunity. I would also like to appeal to our \r\ndevelopment partners in general and to the Group of \r\nEight countries in particular, requesting that they assist \r\nus in addressing the critical issue of external debt \r\nburden. \r\n One year after elections in Guinea-Bissau, which \r\nconfirmed the return to constitutional normality in my \r\ncountry, I should like to reiterate here the commitment \r\nof the people, Government and especially that of \r\nMr. João Bernardo Vieira, President of Guinea-Bissau, \r\nto spare no effort in consolidating peace and \r\nestablishing political stability and national \r\nreconciliation. Significant progress has been made in \r\nthis area. It must, however, be stressed that the \r\ncomplexity of the current reforms, especially within \r\nthe defence and security forces, requires lasting and \r\n A/61/PV.19\r\n \r\n31 06-53341 \r\n \r\nsubstantial support from the international community, \r\ngiven the lack of resources available to us.  \r\n I would like to express our appreciation to all our \r\npartners, especially our brothers in the Economic \r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) and the \r\nCommunity of Portuguese Language Countries \r\n(CPLP), for their support and the creation of the \r\nInternational Contact Group on Guinea-Bissau, whose \r\nfirst meeting was held here at the United Nations \r\nHeadquarters last week. I would also like to take this \r\nopportunity to reaffirm that my country will spare no \r\neffort to continue to deserve your confidence and \r\nsolidarity. Nonetheless, it must be stressed that, despite \r\nour willingness and determination, Guinea-Bissau \r\nneeds your urgent assistance in order to implement the \r\nmeasures contained in the national poverty reduction \r\nstrategy paper. Just adopted by our Government, that \r\ndocument will serve as the basis for preparing a \r\nroundtable on Guinea-Bissau planned for next \r\nNovember at Geneva. It is a pleasure to invite all our \r\ntraditional partners and others here present to take part \r\nin that roundtable, which will, indeed, be an event of \r\ngreat importance for stimulating our economy and for \r\nraising the living conditions of our people.  \r\n Today’s world is a genuine global village. \r\nMankind’s progress in science, information technology, \r\ncommunications and transportation means that the \r\ndestinies of our peoples are more and more \r\ninterdependent. That is why we must combine our \r\nefforts to eradicate poverty and hunger in the world \r\nand to deal with endemic diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, \r\nand to put an end to injustices, violations of human \r\nrights and all forms of discrimination and intolerance. \r\n When we discuss the issues of development and \r\ncombating poverty, we must resist the temptation of \r\ntaking the easy way and applying simplistic solutions. \r\nEconomic and social development and its corollary, the \r\neradication of poverty, require deep thought and \r\ncourageous measures. No phenomenon can be \r\nexplained simplistically, and there is no simple \r\nuniversal recipe. The signs of the times must be \r\ncorrectly interpreted. Peoples’ opinions, their culture, \r\ntheir religious practices and their concerns must all be \r\nunderstood and respected. We must find new ways of \r\nreorganizing and strengthening democratic States by \r\ngiving priority to education and training. We must also \r\nthink about the need to increase our collective capacity \r\nto combat terrorism and to deal with all forms of \r\nextremism through permanent dialogue between \r\ncultures and civilizations. \r\n It is incomprehensible, and even less acceptable, \r\nthat human beings are abandoned and condemned to \r\ndie under the indifferent regard of the international \r\ncommunity. International solidarity towards vulnerable \r\npopulations must not be delayed or be given under post \r\nmortem conditions. The international community must \r\ndemonstrate vigilance and be capable of preventing all \r\nhumanitarian catastrophes resulting from conflicts, as \r\nthe Secretary-General rightly recalled, in the name of a \r\nuniversal conscience. It is precisely because of the \r\nuniversal nature of the responsibility of our \r\nOrganization that Guinea-Bissau will spare no effort in \r\norder to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations \r\nthrough concerted, pragmatic and efficient reforms. In \r\nfact, the effectiveness of our Organization would be \r\neven greater with the full participation of all Member \r\nStates with a view to enhancing our multilateral \r\ninstitution, which needs greater democracy and \r\ntransparency in fulfilling its mandate. \r\n More than sixty years after its founding, the \r\nUnited Nations must adapt to the changes that have \r\ntaken place in the world in order to take into account \r\nthe existence and the emergence of new players on the \r\nworld stage whose contribution to peacekeeping and \r\ninternational security are becoming more and more \r\nimportant. Among those States are countries in Africa, \r\nAsia and Latin America, which can legitimately lay \r\nclaim to a permanent seat on the Security Council. \r\nDeveloping countries in Africa, Asia and Latin \r\nAmerica have the right to greater participation and \r\nprominence on the Security Council. \r\n Ten years ago, we elected Kofi Annan, an \r\noutstanding son of Africa, to guide the destiny of our \r\nOrganization. As we assess his tenure, it is with pride \r\nand satisfaction that we note the achievements during \r\nhis term of office. Recent years have not been easy, \r\nbecause the world is confronting new and longstanding \r\nchallenges in various forms and scales and for which \r\nour Organization was insufficiently designed and \r\nprepared. On behalf of Guinea-Bissau, the President of \r\nGuinea-Bissau, João Bernardo Vieira, and our \r\nGovernment, I would like to add our voice to the \r\nvibrant tribute paid by the entire international \r\ncommunity to the Secretary-General. I would also like \r\nto express the gratitude of our people to him for the \r\ncontribution of the United Nations system in promoting \r\nA/61/PV.19  \r\n \r\n06-53341 32 \r\n \r\npeace, political stability and development in our \r\ncountry. \r\n The great challenges of the new millennium will \r\ndetermine the development work facing us and the \r\ncapacity of people to resolve, as quickly as possible, \r\nproblems of peace, political stability, national \r\nreconciliation and social justice. All States and civil \r\nsociety must be able to count upon, whenever required, \r\nthe transparent and democratic functioning of the \r\nUnited Nations system for the defence of their rights, \r\nin a perspective that creates consensus and which is \r\ncompatible with human development, namely \r\ncompatible with the well-being of humanity. \r\n As the General Assembly prepares to select a \r\nsuccessor to Mr. Kofi Annan, it will, I am convinced, \r\nbe able to elect a Secretary-General with the essential \r\nattributes of skill, experience and dedication for \r\npromoting better understanding between peoples and \r\nnations of this world. \r\n The determination and leadership of the next \r\nSecretary-General will also be necessary in order to \r\nestablish synergy and international cooperation so as to \r\ntransform the United Nations into a unique and \r\nirreplaceable instrument that can strengthen \r\nmultilateralism in favour of development, of improved \r\nconservation of our planet and of international peace \r\nand security. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Le Cong Phung, Vice-Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Viet Nam. \r\n Mr. Le Cong Phung (Viet Nam): Madam \r\nPresident, at the outset, on behalf of the Vietnamese \r\ndelegation, may I extend our warmest congratulations \r\nto you, the third woman in United Nations history to be \r\nelected as President of the General Assembly. I am \r\nconfident that, under your wise leadership, this sixty-\r\nfirst session will be crowned with success. I also wish \r\nto convey our deep appreciation for the tremendous \r\nefforts undertaken and active contributions made by \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson during his presidency \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixtieth session. \r\n As His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan’s last term of \r\nduty as Secretary-General of the United Nations comes \r\nto a close, I wish, on behalf of the Vietnamese \r\nGovernment, to express our deep appreciation for his \r\ndedication and commitment to our Organization. His \r\nvisit to Viet Nam last May was another milestone in the \r\nhistory of the ever-growing Viet Nam-United Nations \r\ncooperative relationship. \r\n The 2005 World Summit lit up our hopes for the \r\nachievement by the international community of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) set out by our \r\nleaders at the Millennium Summit in 2000. One year \r\nhas elapsed, and, regrettably, the picture of the world \r\nwe see today is made up of paradoxes. Although the \r\ntrend of peace, cooperation and development continues \r\nto prevail, so do the unilateral use of force, escalation \r\nof regional and ethnic conflicts and international \r\nterrorism. We have also seen serious hardships faced \r\nby developing countries under the pressure of \r\nglobalization, and inequality in international economic \r\nrelations. Poverty, epidemics, drugs and transnational \r\ncrime pose even greater threats to hundreds of millions \r\nof people around the world. \r\n Against this backdrop, in the view of the \r\nVietnamese delegation, continued joint efforts to create \r\na favourable environment for the achievement of the \r\nMDGs are even more imperative. We consider the \r\ntheme chosen for this sixty-first session of the General \r\nAssembly, focusing on global partnership for \r\ndevelopment, to be highly relevant. \r\n Peace and socio-political stability are \r\nindispensable to development. In turn, positive \r\neconomic development and improved living standards \r\nof people help to consolidate peace and stability in \r\nevery country and region and the world as a whole. It \r\nis essential that nations work together to settle \r\ndifferences and disputes through dialogue, abandon the \r\nuse of force in their relations and fully comply with the \r\nUnited Nations Charter and international law in order \r\nto build a peaceful and stable environment in the \r\ninterest of all. \r\n I wish to reaffirm Viet Nam’s strong support for \r\nefforts to reach early peaceful settlements of \r\ninternational and regional conflicts and differences, \r\nincluding the nuclear issues on the Korean Peninsula \r\nand in Iran, and the crisis in the Middle East, where the \r\nrecent hostilities in Lebanon, which caused heavy loss \r\nof innocent life and destruction of the country’s \r\ninfrastructure, serve as a typical example of harm \r\nbrought about by unilateral actions. \r\n In this connection, I wish to state Viet Nam’s \r\nconsistent policy of supporting the just struggle of the \r\nPalestinian people for their inalienable rights. I call on \r\nall parties concerned to implement the United Nations \r\n A/61/PV.19\r\n \r\n33 06-53341 \r\n \r\nSecurity Council resolutions on the Middle East, \r\nincluding resolution 1701 (2006), and soon arrive at a \r\nfair and lasting solution for peace and stability in the \r\nregion. \r\n Viet Nam is deeply concerned by the upsurge of \r\nterrorism in the world. We will continue to support the \r\njoint efforts of the international community to combat \r\nterrorism on the basis of the fundamental principles of \r\nthe United Nations Charter and international law, as \r\nwell as respect for national sovereignty. The deep roots \r\nof terrorism, including poverty, inequality and \r\ninjustice, must be eliminated. What should also be \r\nmentioned here is the unfortunate reality that, in many \r\ncases, the suppression of terrorist organizations, \r\nincluding those targeting Viet Nam, is being \r\nundertaken selectively, with double standards. It is our \r\nview that such conduct may leave room for more \r\ninternational terrorist acts. \r\n Achievements in science and technology, \r\nespecially information technology, and globalization \r\nhave brought about great opportunities for all \r\ncountries. They have also brought about the dark side \r\nof international economic relations. A widened \r\ndevelopment gap between the rich and the poor poses \r\npotential threats to world peace and security. In the \r\nOutcome Document of the 2005 World Summit, our \r\nleaders called for the establishment of a global \r\npartnership for development to enhance cooperation in \r\nall financial, trade and investment areas and called for \r\nincreased assistance to developing countries, \r\nconsidering that such steps by the international \r\ncommunity would contribute to establishing a \r\nfavourable environment for the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\n Such global partnership is yet to be seen, and we \r\nare concerned with increasing adverse impacts of \r\nglobalization. The failure of the Doha Round, the \r\nstrengthening of protectionism in a number of \r\ndeveloped countries and fluctuating oil and gold prices \r\nare causing more and more difficulties for developing \r\nnations in their efforts to achieve the MDGs. A typical \r\nexample of this situation is the anti-dumping tariff \r\nimposed on Vietnamese catfish and shrimp in past \r\nyears and on footwear at present; this measure is \r\naffecting the lives of millions of poor people. It runs \r\ncounter to World Trade Organization (WTO) rules and \r\nthe spirit of trade liberalization pursued by Member \r\nStates. It should also be pointed out that the increased \r\nintegration of developing nations in the world economy \r\nis indeed an important element in ensuring the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs).  \r\n Developing countries should be supported and \r\nassisted to join the World Trade Organization (WTO) \r\nas early as possible. Non-tariff barriers under the guise \r\nof hygiene and safety standards, among others, should \r\nbe removed to facilitate developing countries to access \r\nthe markets of the developed economies. We have on \r\nmany occasions expressed our view that, in our times, \r\nembargo and sanctions are completely obsolete \r\npolicies. We once again call for an early lifting of the \r\nunilateral economic and trade embargo against Cuba. \r\n Viet Nam welcomes the fact that a number of \r\ncountries have set up road maps to allocate 0.7 per cent \r\nof their gross national product to official development \r\nassistance without any conditions. Technology transfer, \r\ncapacity-building and human resource development \r\nshould be further promoted. We welcome initiatives to \r\nsettle the debts of poor countries, the solutions outlined \r\nin the Monterrey Consensus and the recent efforts of \r\nthe international community towards this end. The \r\nUnited Nations should work out, especially at the \r\nnational level, measures to further incorporate the \r\nMDGs in the implementation of global commitments \r\nundertaken during the past decade in the areas of \r\nwomen, children, population, development, HIV/AIDS \r\nprevention, housing, environment and social \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Viet Nam supports efforts to strengthen \r\nmultilateral mechanisms in which the United Nations \r\nplays a central role with a view to building and \r\nensuring a peaceful and stable environment in the \r\nworld. The United Nations should be reformed to \r\nimprove its effectiveness, democratization and modes \r\nof operation on the basis of the fundamental principles \r\nenshrined in its Charter.  \r\n While welcoming initial successes in the United \r\nNations reform process, such as the establishment of \r\nthe Human Rights Council and the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, we realize that much remains to be done. \r\nMeasures are needed to consolidate the central role and \r\npower of the General Assembly. The Security Council \r\nshould also be reformed in both its composition and \r\nmethods of work to ensure that it really represents the \r\nconcerns and interests of all United Nations Members \r\nas stipulated in the Charter. \r\nA/61/PV.19  \r\n \r\n06-53341 34 \r\n \r\n Viet Nam has made remarkable progress in \r\nimplementing the MDGs and we are in a good position \r\nto meet the 2015 deadline. Based on our own \r\nexperience, we believe that each country should, first \r\nand foremost, strive to create and maintain a peaceful \r\nenvironment for development, mobilize broad \r\nparticipation by people of all walks of life in poverty \r\nreduction efforts and reserve preferential treatments for \r\nthe poor, vulnerable groups and people living in remote \r\nand difficult areas, with a view to helping them catch \r\nup with the majority. Furthermore, effective prevention \r\nof natural disasters and mitigation of their \r\nconsequences are crucial factors. \r\n To create a peaceful environment for national \r\ndevelopment, Viet Nam will continue with its foreign \r\npolicy of sovereign independence, peace, cooperation \r\nand development. We continue to be a friend and \r\nreliable partner of all countries in the international \r\ncommunity striving for peace and cooperation and we \r\nwill continue to actively participate in regional and \r\ninternational cooperation.  \r\n We are in the final stage leading to accession to \r\nthe World Trade Organization. Viet Nam is also \r\nrunning for non-permanent membership of the United \r\nNations Security Council for the term 2008-2009. In \r\npursuing our policy of international integration and in \r\ncontributing to the common endeavours of the \r\ninternational community, we look forward to continued \r\nsupport from all Members of the United Nations.  \r\n The President: I now give the floor to Ms. Belela \r\nHerrera, Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uruguay. \r\n Ms. Herrera (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nMadam President, I bring to you the greeting of the \r\npeople and Government of the Eastern Republic of \r\nUruguay to this Assembly. This Assembly is the \r\nbroadest and most representative and important forum \r\nin the world today. \r\n Madam President, may I express my personal \r\nsatisfaction at seeing you exercise such an important \r\nfunction and I am sure that as a woman you will be \r\nable to add to the office an additional share of \r\nmoderation and restraint. \r\n In Uruguay, like the United Nations, we feel that \r\nit is very important to preach by example. That is why \r\nthe Government I represent has also assumed, among \r\nits many tasks, that of elevating the status of women \r\nand increasing their participation in various areas.  \r\n Likewise, I am very happy to bring to you a \r\nspecial message from the President of Uruguay, \r\nMr. Tabaré Vásquez, for the Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Kofi Annan, to thank him for his unrelenting \r\nefforts to drive the immense process of reforming the \r\nOrganization. My country and the other Members of \r\nthis house are fully committed to this reform. \r\n On the occasion of the sixteenth Ibero-American \r\nSummit that will take place in Uruguay, the countries \r\nof the conference will express to the Secretary-General \r\ntheir thanks for his outstanding work. I would also like \r\nto say that the main subject of the Summit will be \r\nmigration and development. Recently, we had a very \r\nconstructive high-level dialogue on this subject in this \r\nhouse. \r\n A year ago, during the sixtieth session of this \r\nforum, the President of our country said that the \r\ncommitment of Uruguay to the United Nations \r\nOrganization is both demanding and hopeful. \r\n Our commitment is demanding because of the \r\nchallenges that the current world faces and because of \r\nthe opportunities implicit in the present, upon the \r\nmanagement of which our future depends.  \r\n Our commitment is hopeful. Although we realize \r\nthat there are difficulties and limitations on the \r\ninternational scene and at the regional and national \r\nlevels, we believe in human beings, we believe in \r\nsociety, we believe in democracy as a common house \r\nand in freedom as the mother tongue of humanity. \r\n The Eastern Republic of Uruguay reaffirms the \r\nprinciples that characterize our foreign policy, namely, \r\nour commitment to peace, sovereignty, democracy and \r\nsolidarity; a firm rejection of all types of terrorism, \r\nviolence and discrimination; the inalienable right of \r\ncountries to have stable and secure borders and to fully \r\nexercise their sovereignty and self-determination; the \r\nrespect for international law as a guarantee of \r\nsovereignty of peoples and their peaceful cohabitation; \r\nnon-intervention in the internal affairs of States; \r\nmultilateralism as a way of strengthening international \r\nlaw and as a way to organize the role of the United \r\nNations; and the recognition of the indivisibility of all \r\nhuman rights, be they political, social, economic, civil \r\nor cultural, including collective rights, such as the right \r\nto development and the environment. Consequently, \r\nour country feels that progress in reforming the \r\nOrganization must be achieved and we are making our \r\ncontribution to that process, which will enable the \r\n A/61/PV.19\r\n \r\n35 06-53341 \r\n \r\nUnited Nations to fulfil its tasks with greater \r\neffectiveness. \r\n Greater effectiveness should also be sought by \r\nthe important recently created bodies, the Human \r\nRights Council and the Peacebuilding Commission. \r\nUruguay is already actively participating in the Human \r\nRights Council and we hope to join the organizing \r\ncommittee of the Peacebuilding Commission.  \r\n As a country that is a major contributor of troops \r\nand in support of the goal of peacekeeping, we have \r\nparticipated in peacekeeping missions since the \r\ncreation of this Organization. The most recent example \r\nof this our active undertaking and participation in the \r\nUnited Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti \r\n(MINUSTAH), which is an essential mechanism for \r\nsecuring a lasting peace and for restoring the social \r\nfabric of a dear Latin American nation. \r\n Likewise, Uruguay would like to renew its active \r\ncommitment to the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) as agreed to by the Heads of State and \r\nGovernment. When I say “active”, I say this as a \r\nreflection of how much progress has been made \r\ntowards the goals set forth in the agreement signed in \r\nSeptember 2005.  \r\n I cannot refer now to each of these goals at this \r\ntime, but one of the main goals is “the eradication of \r\nextreme poverty and hunger”. In Uruguay, by means of \r\nthe interaction of various governmental programmes, \r\nwe have implemented an emergency social plan that \r\ndeals with the most basic needs of those in extreme \r\npoverty.  \r\n Poverty has begun to decrease, dropping from \r\n32.6 per cent of the recorded population in 2004 to \r\n29.8 per cent at the end of 2005. We feel that this is \r\nstill not sufficient, but it is progress, not only in terms \r\nof social protection, but also in terms of social \r\nintegration. \r\n This is so because the great problems that have \r\nproduced poverty in our country, as in other countries, \r\nare not just hunger, the lack of housing, illiteracy, \r\nacademic failure or teenage pregnancies, but also \r\ndiscrimination, stigmatization, insecurity and despair, \r\nindeed, situations that indicate being integrated in \r\nsociety is much more than subsisting. \r\n Social integration is essential, too, because the \r\nright to participate in social life also involves \r\nrecognizing individuals as active citizens and not just \r\nas people who need to be helped. \r\n And social integration is key, because the right \r\nthat our citizens are asking for — all of them, even the \r\npoorest — is not just the right to live, but also the right \r\nto be recognized as individuals and the right to live \r\ntogether in society. This is called democracy and \r\ncitizenship. \r\n Allow me from this important podium and on \r\nbehalf of the Government I represent to refer to three \r\nmatters of particular importance for our country. One \r\nof them has to do with the facts of the recent past. \r\nThere can be no future without memory, no freedom \r\nwithout justice. That is why, within the framework of \r\nlegislation in force, Uruguay is taking concrete steps to \r\nheal the wounds caused by the violation of human \r\nrights during the dictatorship that ruled the country \r\nbetween 1973 and 1985. It has been difficult work and \r\nit is also very difficult to learn and accept the truth, but \r\nit does strengthen democracy as a form of Government \r\nand condition in society. Moreover, truth and justice \r\nhelp to ensure that the horrors of the past are never \r\nrepeated. \r\n I am very happy to inform this General Assembly \r\nthat my country has taken one further step in the \r\npromotion and defence of human rights. The \r\nUruguayan parliament has just unanimously approved a \r\nbill on genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes \r\nand cooperation with the International Criminal Court. \r\n Another subject that relates to the current \r\nsituation and the future is climate change and the \r\ndegradation of the environment. Uruguay is a party to \r\nthe main international conventions in this area and, \r\nwhile stressing the indispensable international \r\ncooperation on this subject, we do particularly stress, \r\nonce again, the individual responsibility of each State \r\nto actively protect the environment in its territory and \r\nwaters and to make the vigilant participation of civil \r\nsociety a high priority. \r\n It is not enough to simply protest pernicious \r\ntransfers of polluting industrial processes. It is \r\nincumbent upon the State to act firmly to be vigilant \r\nand monitor and to impose high environmental \r\nstandards on foreign and domestic companies.  \r\n Uruguay receives significant investment for \r\nindustrial development on its territory, but we have \r\nvery strict controls on the environmental aspects of \r\nA/61/PV.19  \r\n \r\n06-53341 36 \r\n \r\nthose investments and we apply an internationally \r\nrecognized standard that reflects our motto “Natural \r\nUruguay”. We require the use of the most modern \r\ntechnologies available, and we monitor effectively, on \r\nthe ground, the environmental effects of such ventures. \r\n The Government of Uruguay reiterates its \r\ncommitment to the protection of the environment in all \r\nparts of the world as a human right and as the \r\ncornerstone for achieving true sustainable \r\ndevelopment. In this sense, Uruguay calls upon the \r\ninternational community, and particularly the donor \r\ncountries, to increase their cooperation in the area of \r\nthe environment for developing countries and assume \r\nin a responsible manner global environmental goals \r\nthat involve shared but differentiated responsibilities \r\nfor everyone. \r\n Finally, I would like to address our commitment \r\nto the strengthening of the multilateral trading system \r\nand the need to bring the Doha Development Round to \r\na successful conclusion, in order to ensure that the \r\ndevelopment dimension is reflected in specific results \r\nand not just programmatic measures. For that, it is \r\nimportant to resume, as soon as possible, the \r\nnegotiations in Geneva, always bearing in mind that we \r\nwill not achieve satisfactory results without the \r\nelimination of agricultural subsidies, in the form of \r\nexports that receive internal support and the significant \r\nopening up of access to markets, particularly in the \r\ndeveloped countries. \r\n Everyone here in this Hall knows that there is no \r\npeace in intolerance and terrorism, and there is no \r\nfreedom in poverty, nor democracy in inequality. We \r\nreaffirm our conviction that these threats can only be \r\novercome if we join our efforts together and fully \r\nappreciate the wealth of our own cultural diversity, \r\nboth among nations as well as within our respective \r\nnations. \r\n Among nations, we must rely on the respect of \r\nour traditions and cultures and a broad-based dialogue \r\namong them in order to find useful synergies. And \r\nwithin each of our countries, we must rely on active \r\npolicies promoting social cohesion that embrace our \r\nvery cultural, ethnic and religious diversities. We have \r\nto move from words to acts, from declarations to \r\naction. This is not easy, but it is essential. \r\n We are not starting from zero. The brief history of \r\nthis Organization is testament to that. \r\n But we still have a lot of work to do. It is a large \r\ntask which, honestly, will never end and the results will \r\nnever be perfect. \r\n But these zones of continuity and imperfection \r\nestablish the ideals that call on us to act and the \r\ncommitments that drive us forward.  \r\n If this sixty-first session of the General Assembly \r\nof the United Nations is able to help us in this task, it \r\nwill have fulfilled its mission. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to \r\nMr. Kalombo Mwansa, Special Envoy of the \r\nGovernment of Zambia. \r\n Mr. Mwansa (Zambia): On behalf of the \r\nZambian delegation, I congratulate you, Madam \r\nPresident, on your election as President of the sixty-\r\nfirst session of the United Nations General Assembly. \r\nIt is indeed significant to have a lady holding the \r\nhighest office of the General Assembly after almost \r\nthree decades. To us, this attests to the commitment of \r\nthe United Nations to the principle of gender equality. \r\n I would like to take this opportunity to welcome a \r\nnew member to the United Nations, the Republic of \r\nMontenegro. \r\n Madam President, I wish to pay tribute to your \r\npredecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, the Foreign Minister of \r\nSweden, who successfully presided over the sixtieth \r\nsession. He rendered selfless commitment and devotion \r\nto the search for consensus on a number of issues, \r\nincluding the 2005 World Summit Outcome. It is \r\npleasing to note that during his presidency, a number of \r\ndecisions were taken, including the establishment of \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. \r\n Allow me to also pay fitting tribute to the \r\noutgoing Secretary-General of the United Nations, \r\nMr. Kofi Annan, for the outstanding leadership he has \r\nprovided to our Organization, particularly in his efforts \r\nto reform it into a more vibrant and accountable body. \r\nHis vision and stewardship of the Organization has set \r\nthe United Nations on a new course. We wish him well \r\nin his future endeavours as he leaves office. It is now \r\nup to us Member States to summon sufficient will to \r\nmake his vision a reality. \r\n The world today is faced with challenges of \r\nextreme poverty and underdevelopment, conflicts \r\namong and between nations and terrorism, which have \r\n A/61/PV.19\r\n \r\n37 06-53341 \r\n \r\ngiven rise to increased insecurity all over the world. In \r\naddition, human trafficking is on the increase \r\nworldwide. Often, innocent women and children in \r\nsearch of a better life, are sold and made to engage in \r\nillicit activities. That is a gross violation of human \r\nrights, which must be seriously addressed by the \r\ninternational community. \r\n The 2005 Summit Outcome set a global agenda to \r\naddress those challenges. Much has been achieved, but \r\nmore remains to be done if we are to build a world \r\nbody that is effective and relevant to the challenges \r\nfaced. Indeed, as Mr. Kofi Annan has indicated in his \r\n“In Larger Freedom” report, \r\n “we will not enjoy development without security, \r\nwe will not enjoy security without development, \r\nand we will not enjoy either without respect for \r\nhuman rights.” (A/59/2005, para. 17) \r\n The guiding principles of the United Nations \r\nCharter incorporate the promotion and protection of \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms. We believe \r\nthat without the protection of those rights and \r\nfreedoms, meaningful development cannot be \r\nachieved. \r\n As one of the 47 Member States elected to the \r\nnewly established Human Rights Council, Zambia is \r\ncommitted to upholding the tenets of human rights in \r\nour country and the world at large. In that regard, \r\nZambia commends the United Nations for establishing \r\nthe Human Rights Council, and as a pioneer member, \r\npledges to give it all the support that it will require. We \r\ncommit ourselves to assist in formulating rules and \r\nstructures designed to ensure a strong Council that is \r\ntransparent, non-selective and non-politicized and that \r\npromotes dialogue and cooperation among Member \r\nStates. \r\n I am pleased to state that Zambia has made \r\nprogress in consolidating human rights and good \r\ngovernance. Zambia has further strengthened the rule \r\nof law and upheld the highest standards of individual \r\nfreedoms for all citizens, without discrimination based \r\non sex, colour, race or religious affiliation. In that \r\nregard, we appeal to the international community to \r\nassist us to strengthen and build the capacities of \r\nhuman rights institutions and all related institutions \r\nthat have an important role to play in the promotion \r\nand protection of human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms. \r\n Permit me at this juncture to thank the \r\ninternational community for electing Zambia to the \r\nHuman Rights Council, with the second highest \r\nnumber of votes. \r\n With regard to increased global insecurity, \r\nZambia reaffirms that a new vision of collective \r\nsecurity is required. Member States of the United \r\nNations expect the collective mechanism to address \r\nthreats, such as war, weapons of mass destruction, \r\nterrorism, organized crime and civil conflict, infectious \r\ndiseases, extreme poverty and environmental \r\ndegradation. If the United Nations is to strengthen the \r\noperations of that collective mechanism, Member \r\nStates must work through the United Nations Security \r\nCouncil and other United Nations agencies to develop \r\nstronger anti-terrorism, nuclear non-proliferation, \r\ndisarmament and crime prevention regimes. \r\n Zambia will continue to actively pursue measures \r\nintended to curtail terrorism through various actions, \r\nincluding taking appropriate national legislative \r\nreforms. To that end, we welcome the recent adoption \r\nby the General Assembly of the Global Counter-\r\nTerrorism Strategy and look forward to the adoption of \r\nthe comprehensive convention on international \r\nterrorism. \r\n Our Organization cannot afford to avoid \r\naddressing situations that threaten international peace \r\nand security, such as the recent case of Lebanon. \r\nPitifully, we witnessed a case of the inaction of the \r\nSecurity Council, a body charged with the \r\nresponsibility of maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity. That state of affairs only reaffirms the need to \r\nreform the Security Council, with regard to its working \r\nmethods and the enlargement of its membership. In that \r\nregard, Zambia reaffirms Africa’s well-known position \r\non the matter. \r\n At this stage, I would be remiss if I did not \r\nmention the Great Lakes region, which is emerging \r\nfrom a protracted period of conflict, followed by a \r\nperiod of successful transition towards democracy. The \r\nInternational Conference on the Great Lakes Region \r\nwill hold its second summit in Nairobi in December \r\n2006, to adopt the draft pact on security, stability and \r\ndevelopment in the region. In that regard, we need the \r\ncontinued political and financial support of the \r\ninternational community to ensure its adoption. \r\n It is important to confirm that the peacebuilding \r\nand development process in the Great Lakes region has \r\nA/61/PV.19  \r\n \r\n06-53341 38 \r\n \r\nreached a very advanced stage at all the three-\r\ndimensional levels, namely: international partnership, \r\nregional ownership and national stewardship. The \r\nvision for integrated and sustainable human \r\ndevelopment in the Great Lakes region is now \r\nreassured. The cessation of conflicts in the region, has \r\nalready fed into the collective will to transform the \r\nsubregion into a place of sustainable peace, political \r\nsecurity and development. \r\n Extreme poverty and deprivation breed disease. \r\nThe number of people living with or affected by \r\nHIV/AIDS and the deaths caused by AIDS have \r\ncontinued to grow in the world today. Furthermore, \r\nbetween 350 and 500 million people per year are \r\nexposed to malaria, which is estimated to be the \r\nnumber one cause of mortality in most developing \r\ncountries. \r\n Zambia, like many of the developing countries \r\nadversely affected by those diseases, supports all the \r\nefforts made by the international community in \r\ncombating HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. We \r\ntherefore welcome the creation of an international drug \r\npurchase facility to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis \r\nand malaria. This will not only facilitate easy access to \r\nmedicine but will also lower the costs and therefore \r\nbenefit many countries, especially in the developing \r\nworld. \r\n Poverty in the world today accounts for many of \r\nthe social and economic injustices that people are \r\nsubjected to in many developing countries. Four years \r\nago, a bargain was struck in Monterrey between \r\ndeveloped and developing countries on the \r\nimplementation of a comprehensive strategy bold \r\nenough to achieve the United Nations Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) by 2015. Developed \r\ncountries were urged to support those efforts with \r\naction on aid, trade and debt relief. \r\n While we commend the developed countries for \r\ntaking tangible steps to fulfil their commitments, we \r\ncall upon them to do so as a matter of urgency. It is \r\nsaddening to note that six years after the Millennium \r\nDeclaration was signed, the majority of our people in \r\nAfrica are still exposed to abject poverty and live on \r\nless than $1 per day. Although there has been \r\nsignificant progress in achieving the MDGs, much \r\nmore remains to be done in order to reverse the \r\nnegative trends of poverty and the continued \r\nmarginalization of people across the world. \r\n We call for the removal of the unjust multilateral \r\ntrade system, which continues to hamper the fair \r\nparticipation of the developing and least developed \r\ncountries in the global market. We would like to draw \r\nthe attention of the Assembly to the role of our \r\ndeveloping partners, particularly, in the quick and \r\nconcrete implementation of the Doha Development \r\nAgenda. It should be pointed out that with fair trading \r\npractices, developing and least developed countries \r\nwould take a significant step towards self-sustenance \r\nand reduce dependence on aid. \r\n Furthermore, we welcome the outcome of the \r\nGleneagles Summit, at which the leaders of the Group \r\nof Eight pledged to increase aid to Africa by \r\n$25 billion a year by 2010. We also express our \r\ngratitude to those leaders for extending and deepening \r\ndebt relief to the poorest countries through the \r\nMultilateral Debt Relief Initiative. That Initiative has \r\nresulted in 100-per-cent cancellation of the debt owed \r\nto the international multilateral financial institutions by \r\nthe poor countries that have reached the completion \r\npoint under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt \r\nInitiative. Zambia is one such country. In addition, our \r\ngratitude goes to the other cooperating partners for \r\nagreeing to expand aid to developing countries by \r\napproximately $50 billion. Those resources will indeed \r\ncontribute to the advancement of the MDGs. \r\n Although in the recent past we have seen an \r\nincrease in the commitment of aid resources and action \r\nand a reaffirmation of the principle of mutual \r\naccountability, there is still an urgent need to ensure \r\nthat aid is managed efficiently and used effectively for \r\nthe achievement of the MDGs. It is equally important \r\nto closely monitor the donor commitments and aid \r\nflows targeted at achieving the MDGs that we have set \r\nfor ourselves to improve the lives of the poor and most \r\nvulnerable in the global community. The people in the \r\ndeveloping countries have been listening attentively to \r\nthe promises that we have made in various \r\ninternational forums. They continue to monitor those \r\ncommitments. Their expectations and aspirations are \r\nvery high. It is therefore incumbent on us to ensure that \r\nthose commitments and promises are fulfilled. \r\n The twenty-first century has been declared the \r\ncentury for the development of Africa. Let us therefore \r\nshow true commitment to that cause. In a world where \r\nthere is no true partnership between the rich nations \r\nand the poor nations, there can be no global security, \r\nno universal justice, no human rights and no \r\n A/61/PV.19\r\n \r\n39 06-53341 \r\n \r\nmeaningful development. More than ever before, all of \r\nus — rich and poor nations alike — have to work \r\ntogether to create a sense of equal partnership. We all \r\nneed to fulfil our commitments within a given time \r\nframe and enter into new ones in order to reach our  \r\n \r\ngoal of a world free of hunger, extreme poverty and \r\ndisease — indeed, a world where we can live in a \r\nsecure, clean and sustainable environment. \r\n The meeting rose at 7.05 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
