(Bahrain) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency The \r\nHonourable Sato Kilman, Deputy Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Vanuatu. \r\n Mr. Kilman (Vanuatu): Today, we stand on the \r\nverge of global uncertainty. The international \r\nlandscape is scarred by wars, conflict, civil unrest, \r\nepidemics, drought and famine. Poverty and \r\nmalnutrition continue to ravage the lives of millions of \r\nthe world’s inhabitants. \r\n The very values and fabric on which the United \r\nNations was founded are being besieged by new ideas \r\nand principles that are undermining the authority of \r\nthis body to maintain global peace and security. The \r\nclash of ideologies and of cultural and religious \r\ndifferences continues to give much food for thought. \r\nThe United Nations stands at a crossroads. While it has \r\nthe mandate to address those challenges, it remains \r\nparalysed as a result of actions taken by the hegemonic \r\nPowers of today. That is the dilemma confronting the \r\nOrganization. \r\n The value of the human person and his or her \r\nright to live in a world that is fair and just seems but a \r\ndream. Ensuring the dignity of one’s right to live with \r\naccess to the most basic necessities in life remains our \r\ngreatest challenge. We speak so ambitiously of creating \r\na world that is equitable and just, but the outcomes \r\nhave been unimpressive. \r\n The schism between the minority rich and the \r\nmajority poor continues to grow. The multitudes of the \r\ndisadvantaged are being further marginalized from the \r\nso-called benefits of globalization. Fear has struck \r\nmany small countries of the developing world. It is not \r\nthe fear that the developing world has no capabilities in \r\ncontributing to peace and security, but the fear — the \r\ngreatest fear, in fact — that the undemocratic practices \r\nof the major United Nations organs, such as the \r\nSecurity Council, are causing tension and disarray in \r\nthe work of the United Nations. \r\n The disparities in the quality of life between the \r\nhaves and the have-nots have grown to be fertile \r\nbreeding grounds for new and hostile generations. And \r\nit is here that the phenomenon of terrorism continues to \r\nchallenge the frontiers of our imagination. It is perhaps \r\nmuch clearer today than ever before that there are \r\nreasons for increased resentment in certain parts of the \r\nworld. \r\n My Government condemns terrorism in whatever \r\nform or manifestation it assumes, and there is an urgent \r\nneed for all the Members of the United Nations to work \r\ntogether openly in combating those dangerous \r\ndevelopments. The destruction of innocent lives should \r\nnot be the means to meeting an end. That is inhumane. \r\nAll United Nations Member countries therefore have \r\nthe responsibility — a moral and ethical \r\nresponsibility — to eradicate that menace from the face \r\nof the Earth. \r\nA/61/PV.21  \r\n \r\n06-53615 2 \r\n \r\n Peace cannot be won through injustice, the \r\npractice of double standards, aggression or war. We \r\ncannot be victorious in the fight against terrorism if we \r\nfail to address its root causes. Conversely, it is \r\nincumbent on all Member States to act responsibly to \r\nensure the implementation of all United Nations \r\nresolutions. Moreover, if we are to have any hope of \r\nbuilding a better future, then peace must sometimes \r\ncome at a price. \r\n We must begin to look deeply, honestly and with \r\nopen hearts if we are really to understand the world \r\naround us. If there is a question of repressive policies \r\nthat influence and dominate the international economic \r\nand political order, then those concerned must take \r\nremedial action. The adoption of the resolution on the \r\nUnited Nation’s Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy is \r\ntherefore a positive step forward. \r\n The central focus on the fight against terrorism \r\nhas taken centre stage for some, and the diversion of \r\nresources is jeopardizing the realization of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and official \r\ndevelopment assistance target levels. Accessibility to \r\nthe markets of the affluent nations has also restricted \r\nthe progress of development in many countries of the \r\ndeveloping world. Major world players must not lose \r\nsight of those goals. \r\n Inter-State relations, mutual understanding and \r\ntolerance begin with respect for the individual. The \r\ndignity of the human person is of the essence in \r\nbuilding equality between all persons. That is one of \r\nthe fundamental principles of the United Nations. As \r\nMembers of the United Nations, we have all agreed to \r\nembrace those principles and we continue to believe in \r\nthose values. Vanuatu joined the United Nations in \r\n1981 because it believed in the Organization. Today, I \r\nstand before the Assembly to again reaffirm faith in the \r\nUnited Nations, but I agree that changes must take \r\nplace to adapt the United Nations system to the \r\nevolution of the international and geopolitical and \r\neconomic framework. \r\n Reforms of the various United Nations bodies are \r\ntherefore absolutely essential. There must be reform of \r\nthe Security Council to ensure that it is democratic and \r\nmore representative of the United Nations membership. \r\nThe veto power in the Council dilutes all the good \r\nintentions of the majority of the United Nations \r\nmembership towards addressing many of the \r\nchallenges confronting us today. The underlying \r\nquestion, though, is: Has the disproportionate use of \r\nthe veto power sustained reasonable levels of \r\ninternational peace and stability? \r\n Cultural and religious differences cannot be seen \r\nto be obstacles in that regard. The United Nations \r\nbrought civility and etiquette to the conduct of \r\nrelations between States, and central to that are \r\nrelations between individuals. The art of statesmanship \r\nhas therefore become very critical at this time. Respect \r\nmust therefore begin here at the United Nations. When \r\none world Power speaks here, this Hall is jammed. \r\nThereafter, the debate becomes routine. That is remiss \r\nof many of us. The annual general debate of the \r\nGeneral Assembly is the only practical occasion at \r\nwhich almost all leaders are together in one place to \r\ndiscuss and share views on the development challenges \r\nfacing the globe. The United Nations is not about one \r\nor several nations; it is about this family of nations \r\nwith the one common objective of maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security. \r\n Over the past few days, millions around the globe \r\nhave monitored the unfolding debate in this noble Hall \r\nof the General Assembly. A war of words has \r\nresounded from this rostrum, exposing an alarming rift \r\nin relations between some super-Powers and the voices \r\nof the developing world. The media have exploited the \r\nsituation to scrutinize those events, often ending up \r\nwith gross assumptions and conclusions that have only \r\ninstilled fear amongst the world’s innocent population. \r\nNow, is that the right message of hope we are giving to \r\nour peoples, who have faith in the United Nations? Is \r\nthe United Nations not the beacon of hope for all \r\nhumanity? \r\n Confrontation must be resolved through tactful \r\ndiplomacy and negotiation consistent with the purposes \r\nand principles of the United Nations Charter and \r\nestablished international law. In that spirit, we also \r\nappeal to those concerned to exercise great restraint \r\nand to have the wisdom and responsibility to ensure \r\nabove all that any action they take serves that purpose, \r\nwhich must be in the interest of future global justice, \r\npeace and security. Any retreat from multilateralism \r\nwill result only in increased tension and aggression. \r\nAgain, mutual dialogue through appropriate \r\nmechanisms is absolutely critical at this very delicate \r\ntime. \r\n On the question of the Middle East, both Israel \r\nand Palestine have the right to live side by side in \r\n A/61/PV.21\r\n \r\n3 06-53615 \r\n \r\npeaceful coexistence as independent and sovereign \r\nStates. The international community must be realistic \r\nabout the future. Let us allow justice, security and \r\nlong-lasting peace to prevail for both the Israeli people \r\nand the Palestinians. \r\n Recently, Vanuatu was recognized by the Happy \r\nPlanet Index, published by the British-based New \r\nEconomics Foundation, as the happiest place on Earth. \r\nWe are proud to have been placed so high amongst all \r\ncountries of the world, but we have been careful not to \r\nbe carried away, and so often it is that island paradox \r\nthat conceals the diverse development challenges that \r\nsmall island countries of the Pacific, such as Vanuatu, \r\nface in today’s world of globalization. \r\n Last week, during the High-Level Meeting on the \r\nMidterm Comprehensive Global Review of the \r\nImplementation of the Programme of Action for the \r\nLeast Developed Countries, I spoke of the many \r\nchallenges facing my country in the implementation of \r\nthe Brussels Programme of Action. Vanuatu has been \r\nshowing positive signs of gradual economic growth. \r\nHowever, in the light of our vulnerability to natural \r\ndisasters, exogenous market demand and supply price \r\nfluctuations and their adverse impacts on the three \r\nmost important sectors contributing to our gross \r\ndomestic product, we consider this an inappropriate \r\ntime to include Vanuatu in the list of countries eligible \r\nfor graduation. \r\n Furthermore, while the current methods used to \r\nmeasure the three main thresholds for graduation are \r\ndependent on statistical variables, it is commonly \r\nunderstood that statistical data for countries in the \r\nPacific — including Vanuatu — contain major \r\ndiscrepancies. Therefore, relying solely on such data to \r\ndetermine Vanuatu’s achievements in relation to the \r\nthresholds would yield inaccurate results. \r\n Very soon, the General Assembly will be \r\nconsidering countries recommended for inclusion in \r\nthe list of countries eligible for graduation. That list \r\nincludes Vanuatu. Our arguments for exclusion from \r\nthe list are well founded and based on practical \r\nrealities. My Government considers as premature the \r\nrecommendation by the Committee for Development \r\nPolicy to include Vanuatu on the list. We therefore call \r\nupon Members of the United Nations to understand and \r\nsupport Vanuatu’s case. \r\n As a responsible United Nations Member, \r\nVanuatu is also contributing towards international \r\npeace and security. Vanuatu peacekeepers have \r\nparticipated in United Nations peacekeeping missions \r\nin Bosnia and East Timor, and we currently have \r\npeacekeepers stationed in the Congo, Haiti, Côte \r\nd’Ivoire and the Sudan. Vanuatu has also participated \r\nin regional peacekeeping missions in Bougainville and \r\nSolomon Islands. Those efforts illustrate Vanuatu’s \r\nresolve to engage in peacekeeping and peacebuilding \r\nin both the regional and international contexts. \r\n With regard to the question of the environment — \r\nin particular global warming and climate change — my \r\nGovernment strongly aligns itself with other small \r\nisland States in urging the international community to \r\nreduce emissions. The failure of major emitters to sign \r\nthe Kyoto Protocol is a major disappointment. \r\n The Charter of the United Nations espouses the \r\nprinciples that continue to guide the Organization’s \r\nefforts in the process of self-determination. It calls for \r\nrecognition of and respect for the fundamental rights of \r\npeoples and territories still under colonial rule. We \r\nmust not lose sight of that goal. The United Nations \r\nmust make renewed efforts where it has failed to allow \r\njustice to prevail for those peoples who continue to be \r\ndenied their inalienable right to freedom and \r\ndemocracy. We must relegate that dark legacy to the \r\npast.   \r\n Determining how to bring more cohesiveness and \r\nunity to this great community of nations has now \r\nbecome a much more formidable challenge. I affirm \r\nmy support for the challenging exercise before us. Our \r\nAlmighty Creator entrusted us, the human race, with \r\nthe safeguarding of a great asset, the Earth. It is \r\nincumbent on us to make the most of that opportunity. \r\nThe world’s destiny is in our hands. In that spirit, I \r\nextend my congratulations to Montenegro on its \r\nadmission as the 192nd Member of the United Nations. \r\n Before closing, I would like to acknowledge the \r\nsupport of our development partners — in particular \r\nAustralia, New Zealand, France, Japan, the People’s \r\nRepublic of China, the United States of America and \r\nthe European Union — as well as the various United \r\nNations bodies that are strongly supporting the \r\ndevelopment of Vanuatu. I also extend our appreciation \r\nto India, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia \r\nfor their continuous support within the framework of \r\nSouth-South cooperation. In addition, my Government \r\nis encouraged by the initiative and the kind gesture of \r\nVenezuela in committing $2 million to the Pacific \r\nA/61/PV.21  \r\n \r\n06-53615 4 \r\n \r\nislands through the work programme of the United \r\nNations Convention to Combat Desertification. Those \r\nare positive developments that together are \r\ncomplementing the leadership role being played by my \r\nGovernment in its development path. \r\n In closing, I take this final opportunity to pay our \r\nrespects to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for \r\nhis outstanding stewardship of the United Nations. His \r\nwisdom has ensured that the United Nations will retain \r\nits credibility and its relevance. During periods of \r\nturbulence and uncertainty, he has been relentless in \r\nthe pursuit of his belief in United Nations reform. My \r\nGovernment salutes him for his distinguished service \r\nto the United Nations. We wish him all the best in his \r\nfuture endeavours. \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Kaliopate Tavola, Minister for Foreign Affairs, \r\nExternal Trade and Sugar of Fiji. \r\n Mr. Tavola (Fiji): I extend to you, Madam, the \r\ncongratulations and best wishes of the Government and \r\nthe people of the Fiji Islands. The General Assembly is \r\nto be commended for accepting your candidature to \r\nbecome the third woman to assume the post of \r\nPresident of the Assembly. That recognizes the critical \r\nrole that women play in the development of humanity \r\nin our global village. We assure you of the support of \r\nmy Government during your tenure.  \r\n We also extend our gratitude to your predecessor, \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson, for his tireless efforts \r\nin the United Nations reform process, to which he has \r\napplied his personal skills and knowledge. While much \r\nis still to be resolved, his contributions thus far to the \r\nreform process have started the ball rolling. It is up to \r\nus to maintain the momentum. \r\n Fiji, its Government and its people wish to \r\nhonour and express our appreciation to the outgoing \r\nSecretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan. \r\nHis tireless efforts to promote peace and reconciliation \r\nin the world are well recognized. Ghana should be \r\njustly proud of its son. As a nation of the developing \r\nworld, we are just as proud that he has been able to \r\nproject our hopes — most prominently, in the \r\ndevelopment agenda of the Organization. We respect \r\nhis achievements in leading the United Nations during \r\nhis tenure of office. His service to peoples around the \r\nworld, and the patience, courage and determination that \r\nhe has demonstrated daily in facing the world, despite \r\nthe barbs and criticisms thrown his way, are \r\ncommendable. We ask him to accept our deepest \r\ngratitude and profound appreciation for all that he has \r\ndone. We extend best wishes for the future to him and \r\nto his family. \r\n On this occasion, following our successful \r\ngeneral elections held in May of this year, I am pleased \r\nto be able to report to the Assembly that all \r\ninternational observers who attended the holding of the \r\ngeneral elections in Fiji have concluded that the result \r\nwas democratic and a fair reflection of the popular will \r\nof the people.  \r\n The rebuilding of our nation after the disaster that \r\nstruck us in 2000 is going very well indeed. It was \r\nstrengthened following the formation of the multiparty \r\nGovernment in accordance with the requirements of \r\nour Constitution. We now have a Cabinet comprising \r\nministers drawn from the majority Soqosoqo Duavata \r\nni Lewenivanua (SDL) Party and the Fiji Labour Party, \r\nas the party that qualified to be invited to be \r\nrepresented in Cabinet. We also have ministers drawn \r\nfrom the independent members of our elected House of \r\nRepresentatives. This means that, for the first time in \r\nits history, Fiji has a cabinet that is truly representative \r\nof its multi-ethnic communities. \r\n Ministers from the two major races in the country \r\nand those from the minority groups are working well \r\ntogether in collaborative and consultative decision-\r\nmaking. We are united by the common purpose of \r\ntaking our country forward, for the benefit of every \r\ncitizen. \r\n Mr. Muñoz (Chile), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n This multi-ethnic arrangement for good \r\ngovernance has received overwhelming approval and \r\nsupport from all our communities. It has given our \r\ncountry reasons to be optimistic. People from all races \r\nnow feel more confident and secure about their future. \r\nWe believe that forming a multi-ethnic Government \r\nthat is representative of our different communities, and \r\nmaking it work, is the approach that has eluded us for a \r\nlong time, but one which will ensure long-term peace \r\nand stability in Fiji. That new form of inclusive \r\nGovernment is also underpinning our drive for \r\ncontinued improvements in Fiji’s economic \r\nperformance. \r\n The plea from Fiji is for the United Nations \r\nMember countries to strengthen their joint resolve to \r\n A/61/PV.21\r\n \r\n5 06-53615 \r\n \r\noppose terrorism everywhere in the world. Fiji is \r\ncommitted to a world in which peace and prosperity \r\nare the cornerstones of all societies and communities. \r\nWe consider it an honour to serve the cause of peace \r\nunder the banners of the United Nations and other \r\npeacekeeping arrangements, including that under the \r\nPacific Islands Forum.  \r\n Where there are potential internal crises and \r\ndisorder, we support the Secretary-General’s concept of \r\nconflict prevention. However, where the United \r\nNations mandates intervention for peace, we are ready \r\nto contribute. Peacekeeping personnel from Fiji are \r\nworking in Iraq, Kosovo, Liberia, the Sinai, the \r\nSolomon Islands, the Sudan and Timor-Leste. We \r\nwould like to thank the United Nations and all those \r\ncountries that have assisted Fiji in honouring its \r\ncommitment to international peace and security. We \r\nwelcome the intention of other countries to assist us in \r\nthat matter. We do so with humility, knowing that there \r\nis more peace to keep and to build in the world today, \r\nand that we have acquired competence to offer to \r\nhumanity. \r\n Peace and security initiatives have undergone a \r\nnumber of reviews recently to benefit peacekeeping \r\noperations. Fiji notes the creation of the peace \r\nstabilization force in Lebanon and the consultative \r\nprocess that preceded it as an example of an existing \r\norganization’s being tailored to suit a given situation. \r\nWe should not be afraid to make changes for the better. \r\nThe best practices derived from Bougainville and the \r\nSolomon Islands are examples that can be utilized \r\nelsewhere. \r\n The Peacebuilding Commission was established \r\nprimarily to ensure that countries that have emerged \r\nfrom conflict do not regress to their status quo ante. \r\nFiji commends that initiative and appeals for \r\neveryone’s support. I welcome the support given to Fiji \r\nas an inaugural member of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission. \r\n We in the Pacific remain committed to ensuring \r\nthat our region remains one of permanent peace and \r\nstability. Next month, Fiji will host the meeting of the \r\nleaders of the Pacific Islands Forum. The finalization \r\nof the Pacific Plan will be the main focus of the \r\nmeeting. The Plan provides a framework for \r\ncooperation and mutual assistance in development, \r\ngood governance and long-term peace and security. We \r\ncommend those countries from outside our region that \r\nhave pledged to work and to assist us in the \r\nimplementation of the Plan. \r\n The Pacific Islands Forum leaders welcomed \r\ntheir summit meetings earlier this year with China, \r\nJapan and France. We commend them for their \r\ndevelopment support and their leadership in promoting \r\nlasting peace in the region. We maintain that those \r\ninitiatives ought to be sustained and can be ensured by \r\nengaging all parties in constructive dialogue. \r\n The United Nations is renowned for addressing \r\nand finding resolutions for the problems of the small \r\nand marginalized. Fiji is a small island developing \r\nState with a highly vulnerable economy. Our economy \r\nis open and is over 70 per cent dependent on export \r\ntrade to earn foreign exchange to meet its development \r\nneeds. \r\n We find that the multilateral trading rules \r\nemanating from the World Trade Organization (WTO) \r\nare not fair or equitable, given our development status, \r\ngeography and size. WTO proposals that have tended \r\ntowards a one-size-fits-all approach have not fully \r\nbenefited from an honest and creative application of \r\nthe special and differential treatment clauses of the \r\nWTO. They have not effectively addressed the \r\nmultiplicity of problems we are facing. They serve \r\nonly the interests of countries that are developed, big \r\nand already established traders globally and, of course, \r\nare already well off. The fact that those proposals are \r\nformulated with little regard for our concerns has \r\nmanifested itself in widening disparity, greater \r\nmarginalization and worsening global poverty. \r\n However, we do not advocate the removal of the \r\nmultilateral trading arrangement. We just need to make \r\nit better. The suspension of the WTO talks on the Doha \r\nDevelopment Agenda has further deepened our \r\nconcerns regarding the need for the multilateral trading \r\nrules to show some flexibility so that the development \r\nconcerns of countries like Fiji can be addressed in the \r\ncurrent round of negotiations. We call on the \r\nmembership of the United Nations to work towards an \r\nearly resumption of the suspended WTO talks. There is \r\nfar too much at stake for all of us, and especially for \r\nthe small islands developing States like Fiji. \r\n We acknowledge the importance of the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights and other international \r\ninstruments in the promotion of human rights. We note \r\nthat they are concerned primarily with protecting the \r\nrights of individuals. Fiji, like other Pacific Islands \r\nA/61/PV.21  \r\n \r\n06-53615 6 \r\n \r\nindigenous communities, welcomes the decision to \r\nbring the draft declaration on the rights of indigenous \r\npeoples to this Assembly for discussion and adoption. \r\nThat instrument is vitally important to the recognition \r\nand acceptance of the right of indigenous peoples to \r\nself-determination and of their right to survival as \r\nethnically and culturally distinct peoples. \r\n On the international convention on the protection \r\nand promotion of the rights and dignity of persons with \r\ndisabilities, Fiji, like others, has recognized the special \r\nneeds of persons with disabilities and has already \r\nenacted the relevant legislation and subsequently \r\nestablished the Fiji National Council of Disabled \r\nPersons. A national policy on disability for 2006-2016, \r\na requirement of the act, is currently being finalized. \r\nFiji strongly supports the international convention and \r\nwould be in favour of its adoption. \r\n Fiji acknowledges the vital role women play in \r\ndevelopment. To ensure women’s active participation \r\nin all facets of development, the monitoring of the \r\nrights of women contained in the Beijing Platform of \r\nAction has to be reinforced. One effective way to do so \r\nis to ensure that domestic policies and legislation are in \r\nplace to drive gender mainstreaming. That must be a \r\npriority target for us all. \r\n Improving world security must be accompanied \r\nby appropriate reforms in our Organization. A goal of \r\nthe current reform of the United Nations is the need to \r\nensure that the voices of small and vulnerable countries \r\nlike Fiji are given equal treatment in the membership \r\nof this global body. \r\n One of the goals of the United Nations reforms is \r\nto achieve democratization. Without that, it will remain \r\nan Organization driven by sectarian interests, where \r\nmight is right and moral and ethical considerations fall \r\nby the wayside. We must not be deterred from the \r\nmomentous task we have set for ourselves. The \r\noutcome of our concerted and committed effort in \r\nthose reforms will be a just and stronger Organization, \r\nbetter prepared to address the world’s multiplicity of \r\nchallenges. \r\n A lot has been achieved since we last met in \r\nplenary. New challenges have emerged. However, there \r\nare still far too many people whose needs and voices \r\nare still crying out to be heard. The United Nations \r\nremains a beacon of hope for them. Those cries ought \r\nto be listened to and people empowered so that they \r\ncan firmly and confidently take charge of their own \r\ndestiny. We must all undertake to assist and participate \r\nin the work of the United Nations, commensurate, of \r\ncourse, with our respective size and economic \r\nstanding. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Eamon Courtenay, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade of \r\nBelize. \r\n Mr. Courtenay (Belize): I stand before the \r\nAssembly and renew the commitment of the \r\nGovernment and people of Belize to the principles \r\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter. We reaffirm \r\nthe pledge made by the father of the Belizean nation, \r\nthe Right Honourable George Price, when he said from \r\nthis rostrum:  \r\n  “Belize, with the help of God and the \r\nsupport of its people, will stand upright and will \r\ndo its duty to help bring peace, stability and \r\nprosperity to our region and the wider circles of \r\nour planet Earth.” (A/36/PV.13, para. 143) \r\n Through you, Sir, we would like to congratulate \r\nthe President on her election and pledge the support of \r\nmy delegation for our important work at this session of \r\nthe General Assembly. \r\n We express our solidarity with our Secretary-\r\nGeneral, whose imprint on this institution at this \r\ncritical time in international affairs will be appreciated \r\nand remembered through the ages. \r\n Belize became independent 25 years ago. It was a \r\ndifferent time then, in 1981. The cold war was being \r\nwaged. There was a clash of economic philosophies, \r\nand countries were being forced to circle in one of two \r\norbits. But many countries did not; we proclaimed our \r\nnon-alignment and worked to establish a new \r\ninternational economic order. We sought to create a \r\nworld which was fairer and more just and which put \r\npeople at its centre.  \r\n We never achieved that dream of a new \r\ninternational economic order. In fact, in 1989, the wall \r\nthat divided not only a nation, but the entire social and \r\neconomic order of the world, came tumbling down. \r\nThe Berlin Wall was torn down nearly two decades \r\nago, but we have yet to tear down the most important \r\nwall of all — the one that separates us into rich States \r\nand poor States, wealthy and poor, developed and \r\ndeveloping. \r\n A/61/PV.21\r\n \r\n7 06-53615 \r\n \r\n Almost 15 years ago, we were told that if we tore \r\ndown barriers to trade, opened up our markets to \r\nforeign capital and imported goods, and privatized our \r\nState-owned enterprises, our economies would grow by \r\nleaps and bounds. We were also told that our partners \r\nin the developed world would afford us greater access \r\nto their markets, that our commodities would receive \r\nfair prices, and that international financiers would \r\nmake capital readily available for us to borrow. \r\n The question we now ask is: Are we better off \r\nhaving adhered to that so-called development cocktail \r\nprescribed by the Washington Consensus? \r\n All is not well. In the Caribbean, 30 per cent of \r\npeople are living in poverty. In Latin America, the \r\nfigure is an obscene 40.6 per cent. Worse yet, 16.8 per \r\ncent of the people in Latin America live in extreme \r\npoverty. Fourteen of the 15 Caribbean countries are \r\namong the most indebted emerging market countries. \r\nIn fact, seven are in the top 10, all with debt-to-gross \r\ndomestic product ratios of about 100 per cent. To quote \r\nfrom a recent World Bank report: \r\n “A closer inspection of the data leaves little room \r\nfor complacency about the world’s progress \r\nagainst poverty. Indeed, the picture that emerges \r\nis one of highly uneven progress, with serious \r\nsetbacks in some regions and time periods. And \r\nwe find that more people living near $2 per day \r\nbecame worse off over the period than the \r\nnumber who gained. Thus the number living \r\nunder $2 per day rose.” \r\nIn 2006, now more than ever we need a new \r\ninternational economic order.  \r\n In 2001, members of the World Trade \r\nOrganization (WTO) adopted the Doha Development \r\nAgenda. The ministerial declaration proudly \r\nproclaimed:  \r\n “The majority of WTO members are developing \r\ncountries. We seek to place their needs and \r\ninterests at the heart of the Work Programme \r\nadopted in this Declaration.”  \r\nThe WTO sought to design a multilateral trading \r\nsystem that was to “ensure that developing countries \r\nsecure a share in the growth of world trade that was \r\ncommensurate with the needs of their economic \r\ndevelopment”. But let me tell members what our \r\nreality, the Belizean experience with the WTO, has \r\nbeen. \r\n Since Doha, a panel set up by the WTO decided \r\nthat the European Union organization of its sugar \r\nmarket was incompatible with WTO rules. To solve \r\nthat problem, Belizean sugar farmers now get paid less \r\nfor the sugar exported to the European Union. Simply \r\nput, the WTO has made them worse off. Since Doha, \r\nthe European Union has liberalized its banana import \r\nregime. That is supposed to make the regime WTO-\r\ncompatible. The statistics now show that imports from \r\nnon-African, Caribbean and Pacific countries into the \r\nEuropean Union have outstripped imports from the \r\nCaribbean, and prices paid for bananas have fallen. \r\n In the five years since Doha, our hopes have been \r\ndashed, ambitions smashed and the development \r\ndimension once again ignored. The accord reached at \r\nDoha has been systematically dismantled with each \r\nsubsequent meeting, from Cancún to Hong Kong to \r\nGeneva. \r\n We say that there is something inherently wrong \r\nwith a system that promises development and delivers \r\nlower prices for exports. We say that there is something \r\nfundamentally unfair in a system that promises a \r\ndevelopment agenda and delivers suspended \r\nnegotiations and less market access to small vulnerable \r\neconomies. \r\n It is in such an environment, defined by \r\nmultilateralism and the primacy of the markets — \r\nliberalism writ large — that small States in the \r\nCaribbean operate. It is a system in which unknown \r\npeople sitting in unmarked rooms in Brussels and \r\nGeneva make decisions that determine how many \r\nboxes of bananas the Caribbean can export to Europe \r\nand what price we get paid for our sugar. \r\n At the end of the day, it is all about social justice \r\nand social equity. Is something wrong with a picture in \r\nwhich, of the 6 billion people on planet Earth, 1 billion \r\nhave more than 80 per cent of world income and \r\n5 billion have less than 20 per cent? Something is \r\nradically wrong with that picture. Our common charge \r\nis to right that imbalance. The fight against poverty \r\ncannot and will not be won with arms and instruments \r\nof war. We need a new international economic order in \r\nwhich the rights of people to jobs and fair wages and to \r\nfair prices for commodities take precedence over rules \r\nof trade that are inherently unfair and inequitable. And \r\nsmall vulnerable economies like ours in the Caribbean \r\nneed special and differential treatment. Unless we \r\nwage the fight against poverty, there will be no peace. \r\nA/61/PV.21  \r\n \r\n06-53615 8 \r\n \r\nIn the absence of peace, insecurity prevails. Insecurity \r\nencourages instability. \r\n It is no wonder that, at this time, we find \r\nourselves in retreat, living in a culture of fear and \r\ndivided by a so-called clash of civilizations. A general \r\nsense of lost hope is pervasive and the enthusiasm of \r\nthe new millennium squandered. \r\n Here at the United Nations, our own concept of \r\ndialogue among civilizations seems to be fast fading. \r\nWe must find a way to build a greater sense of security, \r\nrenew our faith in each other and deconstruct the walls \r\nthat divide. That can best be accomplished through our \r\nwork at the United Nations, and my delegation \r\ncommends our efforts in endorsing an integrated \r\napproach to addressing the transition from conflict to \r\nrecovery with the establishment of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission. Together with the General Assembly and \r\nthe Security Council, the Commission should, in the \r\nspirit of its constitution, help to answer those critical \r\nquestions related to the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security and, above all, development. \r\n In these times, when the rules that govern our \r\ncollective responsibility to international civility and the \r\ncomity of nations seem to be eroding along with \r\nrespect for international law, we must look to our \r\ninstitutions to restore our common values. \r\n We are reminded that the primary responsibility \r\nof the Security Council is the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. The Charter, in giving \r\nthat mandate, specifies that the conferral of that \r\nresponsibility is to ensure prompt and effective action \r\nwhen required. But as we have seen with the delayed \r\nreaction to the recent events in Lebanon and the \r\noccupied Palestinian territories, the Council failed to \r\ndischarge its mandate. The situation in the Middle East \r\nnecessitates prompt and effective action. \r\n We acknowledge that the shortcomings in the \r\nCouncil’s exercise of its mandate may be attributed to \r\nits structural imbalances. Those imbalances are not \r\ninsurmountable and, indeed, call for reform. The \r\nCouncil must reflect the current geopolitical realities. \r\nBelize supports comprehensive reform of the Security \r\nCouncil, including the expansion of membership in \r\nboth permanent and non-permanent categories, and \r\nthrough the improvement of its working methods. We \r\ndetect a momentum for change and we are ready to \r\nengage as equal partners to that end. \r\n We now have a Human Rights Council that we \r\nhope will be vigilant in its work to protect the rights of \r\nthose unable to protect themselves. We will be truly \r\ncivilized only when we stop the victimization of the \r\nweak at the expense of the ideology of the strongest. \r\n We must bring to an end the violence and death \r\nof the innocent in Darfur. Our collective conscience is \r\nstained by the genocide in Darfur. For every innocent \r\nlife that is lost to conflict and the denial of basic \r\nhuman rights, we carry the scars of their oppression. \r\n In Belize, we have started a dialogue on the \r\nrelevance of small States and the role we must play in \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security. I \r\nhave invoked the idea that, in the global war on \r\nterrorism, we in the Caribbean and Central America are \r\nless important because we operate in a culture of peace \r\nand respect for life, and that because most of us lack \r\nthe armies to join coalitions, we are seen as unwilling \r\nor even irrelevant. \r\n Yet our people feel the same fear as those in \r\nlarger countries; we suffer the economic effects that \r\nothers suffer and, dare I say, more so because of our \r\nvulnerability due to our size. As people at risk, we \r\nwant to see the billions spent to make war used to bring \r\nprosperity and hope to those who live in such despair \r\nthat they can be enticed into the spreading of terror. We \r\nwill not be dissuaded from our belief that violence and \r\ndestruction beget war. Only hope and sustainable \r\ndevelopment can bear peace. \r\n Today, in our sister Caribbean nation of Haiti, we \r\nsee the resilience of its people. In the turbulence of the \r\npast few years, the people of Haiti have refused to \r\ndespair. Their desire to live in a democratic society \r\nprevailed when they recently went to the polls to elect \r\na new Government. We must not suffer Haiti to slide \r\ninto irrelevance. We all owe Haiti our commitment to \r\nnurturing its growth by building those institutions \r\nnecessary for a sustainable nation State. \r\n At a time when the world has so much wealth that \r\n$900 billion is being spent on military expenditure and \r\n$300 billion on agricultural subsidies, but only $60 \r\nbillion on development assistance, too many of our \r\npeople remain under the strangulation of poverty, \r\nrelegated to the dungeons of destitution and social \r\ninequality. Yet we come to these occasions and speak \r\nof our strong commitment to preserving the dignity of \r\nall human beings. We speak of their rights and promise \r\nto continue to foster dialogue. And when it comes right \r\n A/61/PV.21\r\n \r\n9 06-53615 \r\n \r\ndown to it, where the agreements count most the plight \r\nof the poor is sacrificed to the bottom line, personal \r\nwealth and political survival. \r\n In the Caribbean, we cannot accept that and, \r\nwhile we applaud the efforts of this Organization and \r\nthe work that has gone into defining agreed \r\ndevelopment goals, including addressing the needs of \r\nour poorest people, the protection of our environment \r\nand efforts to promote meaningful sustainable \r\ndevelopment, we must do more. Each child who goes \r\nto sleep hungry contributes to the shame we must all \r\nfeel in failing to protect his or her basic rights. Each \r\nperson who dies of HIV/AIDS is a reflection of our \r\nlost value for life, and every time the poor die for want \r\nof food we have failed humanity. \r\n Twenty-five years ago, as a newly independent \r\ncountry, Belize was welcomed into the United Nations \r\nassured of its territorial integrity and its equal place in \r\nthis community of nations. We earned our rightful \r\nplace by example and by commitment to this \r\nOrganization’s highest principles. In return, we \r\nreceived the solidarity of all. \r\n Our political independence will remain imperfect \r\nuntil we find a peaceful and just solution to the \r\nterritorial claim of Guatemala to Belizean territory. We \r\nremain committed to finding a solution that respects \r\nour territorial integrity and honours our sovereignty. \r\n Membership in the United Nations is an \r\naffirmation of the will of sovereign peoples. The \r\nUnited Nations has served as a platform for the \r\nexpression of that will for many of the nations \r\nrepresented here today. Let us in turn ensure that the \r\nUnited Nations remains a beacon of hope for all \r\npeoples who continue the struggle, such as our brothers \r\nand sisters in Palestine, Western Sahara, Taiwan and \r\nthe non-self governing territories. \r\n We warmly welcome Montenegro to the family of \r\nnations. \r\n Our conversation began with my seeking answers \r\nto the question of the relevance of Belize and other \r\nsmall States in today’s global order. I find comfort in \r\nthe winds of change occurring in our Organization, a \r\nchange that will bring to this sixty-first session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly a new Secretary-General, and that \r\nwill continue the process of reform mandated in the \r\nWorld Summit Outcome. We must, however, make \r\nchanges relevant to our time and true to our Charter. \r\n Let us seize this opportunity and face the \r\nchallenges boldly together. For us in Belize, our minds \r\nare imbued with the democratic process, our hearts \r\nbeat with social justice and our souls cherish the \r\ntreasures of the spirit. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to Mr. Nyan Win, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Myanmar. \r\n Mr. Win (Myanmar): First of all, I wish to \r\ncongratulate Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa on her \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-first session. We are convinced that her vast \r\nexperience in international relations and able \r\nleadership will lead this session to a successful \r\nconclusion.  \r\n I would also like to pay tribute to her \r\npredecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, who led the last session \r\nof the General Assembly most ably and successfully. \r\n I would also like to take this opportunity to \r\nexpress our deep appreciation to Secretary-General \r\nKofi Annan, whose stewardship of this Organization \r\nover the past 10 years has brought many positive and \r\nremarkable changes to the world body. His tireless and \r\ndedicated service to the international community will \r\nbe indelibly etched in our collective memory. \r\n The reform of the United Nations to meet the new \r\nchallenges of our times is an ongoing process that \r\nneeds to be assessed continuously. While we have \r\nachieved tangible progress in some areas, such as the \r\nestablishment of the Human Rights Council and the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, progress has yet to be \r\nmade in other areas. The success of the reform of the \r\nUnited Nations must be judged in terms of its effective \r\nresponse to the contemporary needs of Member States, \r\nin particular those of the developing countries, which \r\nform the majority of the membership. While many \r\nStates, including the developing countries, struggle to \r\nprotect and advance the principles and practices of \r\nmultilateralism, the tendency towards unilateralism \r\nremains strong. That unhealthy tendency can in no way \r\ngain ascendancy if the United Nations is to remain \r\nviable. \r\n Attempts by some strong and powerful States to \r\nimpose their will on developing countries in pursuit of \r\ntheir political agenda create an environment of hostility \r\nin the international community. To our dismay and \r\nfrustration, there has been glaring abuse of the mandate \r\nA/61/PV.21  \r\n \r\n06-53615 10 \r\n \r\nentrusted to the Security Council by Member States by \r\nunjustly placing the situation of my country on the \r\nagenda of the Security Council and by alleging that it \r\nposes a threat to regional peace and security. Nothing \r\ncould be further from the truth. Myanmar has done \r\nnothing that can undermine the peace and security of \r\nany country, let alone regional or international peace \r\nand security. Myanmar has close and cordial relations \r\nwith all its five neighbours and other countries in the \r\nregion. \r\n The founders of the United Nations did not intend \r\nthe world body to become a forum in which some \r\nMembers with political and economic clout could gang \r\nup against a Member State and label it as what it is not. \r\nWe therefore urge all Member States to resist attempts \r\nby those powerful States to influence the Security \r\nCouncil to take action against a Member State that in \r\nno way poses any threat to international peace and \r\nsecurity. \r\n Regarding Security Council reform, Myanmar is \r\nin favour of the expansion of the Security Council in \r\nboth the permanent and non-permanent categories. The \r\nexpanded Security Council must also reflect today’s \r\npolitical and economic realities. However, the fact that \r\nwe have not made substantial progress on the \r\nexpansion of the Council demonstrates the sensitive \r\nand complex nature of the issue. It is extremely \r\nimportant that this issue not become divisive among \r\nthe United Nations membership. Dialogue and \r\nconsultations must continue to seek a solution \r\nacceptable to the overwhelming majority of the \r\nmembership. \r\n It is encouraging that the first session of the \r\nHuman Rights Council was successfully held in \r\nGeneva in June and that the Council is now working in \r\nfull swing to quickly become an effectively functioning \r\nhuman rights body. Myanmar’s active participation at \r\nthe highest level in that session is a reflection of our \r\ncommitment to further strengthening the United \r\nNations human rights machinery.  \r\n It is, however, important that the principle of \r\nimpartiality, objectivity and non-selectivity be \r\nscrupulously observed in the work of the Council. \r\nAlthough we want the Council to become an effective \r\ntool in the strengthening of the United Nations human \r\nrights machinery, we are not giving it carte blanche. It \r\nis through the observation of the aforementioned \r\nprinciples — through dialogue, cooperation and non-\r\npoliticization of human rights issues — that the \r\nCouncil is to function. It is incumbent not only on the \r\nmembers of the Council, but also on all of us, to ensure \r\nthat the Council does not deviate from the direction in \r\nwhich we expect it to head. \r\n Terrorism continues to defy the attempts of the \r\ninternational community to eliminate it, raising its ugly \r\nhead again in Mumbai and elsewhere very recently. We \r\nare of the view that it is only through the involvement \r\nof every community of people that we can be \r\nforewarned in time of the impending onslaught of \r\nterrorist acts. Myanmar fully supports the international \r\nefforts to eliminate terrorism.  \r\n A daunting challenge facing the international \r\ncommunity is the horrendous crime of human \r\ntrafficking, which the Secretary-General aptly refers to \r\nas one of the most reprehensible violations of human \r\nrights. Despite the efforts of the international \r\ncommunity to tackle that issue over the past decade, it \r\ncontinues to grow, with serious national and \r\ninternational implications for the Governments \r\nconcerned. Human trafficking is a serious international \r\nissue and we believe that it requires a coordinated and \r\ncooperative response by the entire international \r\ncommunity to address the issue. \r\n Myanmar is a State party to the United Nations \r\nConvention against Transnational Organized Crime and \r\nits supplementary Protocols to Prevent, Suppress and \r\nPunish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and \r\nChildren and against the Smuggling of Migrants by \r\nLand, Sea and Air. I would like to stress that Myanmar \r\nregards combating trafficking in persons as a national \r\ntask. We are making relentless efforts in that regard. \r\n Myanmar has designated HIV/AIDS, malaria and \r\ntuberculosis as diseases of national concern. In 1989, \r\nwe set up a high-level multisectoral national AIDS \r\ncommittee. We have been cooperating with the United \r\nNations and, in 2001, our national AIDS programme \r\nand the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS \r\n(UNAIDS) drew up a joint programme of action \r\ncovering education, prevention, cure and rehabilitation \r\nto effectively address the challenge. As a result, we \r\nhave been able not only to level the HIV/AIDS \r\ninfection rate, but to reduce it. We are also serving on \r\nthe UNAIDS Programme Coordinating Board, enabling \r\nus to address the issue at both the national and \r\ninternational levels. \r\n A/61/PV.21\r\n \r\n11 06-53615 \r\n \r\n Narcotic drugs continue to be one of the threats \r\nfacing us today. As the Government of Myanmar \r\nregards the eradication of narcotic drugs as a national \r\nresponsibility, it has striven relentlessly to eradicate \r\nsuch drugs by 2014. Our determined efforts on all \r\nfronts have resulted in a substantial decrease in opium \r\nproduction. I would like to reiterate here that Myanmar \r\nwill step up its efforts, in close cooperation with \r\nfriendly countries and international organizations, until \r\nwe achieve our goal. \r\n Cooperation with the United Nations is a \r\ncornerstone of Myanmar’s foreign policy. Our track \r\nrecord has proven that Myanmar has invariably \r\nextended its cooperation to the United Nations. \r\nMyanmar has been implementing a national \r\ndevelopment plan with the aim of accelerating growth, \r\nachieving equitable and balanced development, and \r\nreducing the socio-economic development gap between \r\nrural and urban areas of the country. The national \r\ndevelopment plan addresses the major aspects of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). We have \r\nmade significant progress towards achieving the MDGs \r\nby 2015, particularly in such areas as health, education, \r\nsustainable access to safe drinking water, and access to \r\nimproved sanitation. In implementing the MDGs, we \r\nare primarily relying on our national resources. In that \r\nregard, we are also receiving valuable assistance and \r\ncooperation from the United Nations agencies \r\nconcerned. \r\n Finally, I wish to apprise the Assembly of the \r\npolitical developments in my country. We have been \r\nsteadfastly implementing the seven-step road map for \r\ntransition to democracy, announced in August 2003. \r\nThe National Convention, which was adjourned on \r\n31 January 2006, will resume its session on 10 October \r\nand continue to discuss the basic principles for the \r\ndrafting of an enduring constitution. I wish to stress \r\nthat the process of transforming the country into a \r\ndemocratic State will move ahead systematically in \r\naccordance with the road map. \r\n Before concluding, I would like to reaffirm our \r\ncommitment to working together in upholding the \r\nprinciples enunciated in the Charter of the United \r\nNations and in strengthening the role of the United \r\nNations to respond to the challenges of the twenty-first \r\ncentury. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency The Honourable Elvin \r\nNimrod, Minister for Foreign Affairs, International \r\nTrade, Legal Affairs, Carriacou and Petite Martinique \r\nAffairs of Grenada. \r\n Mr. Nimrod (Grenada): I am indeed honoured to \r\njoin previous delegations in congratulating Sheikha \r\nHaya Rashed Al-Khalifa on her election as President of \r\nthe Assembly at this sixty-first session. Let me assure \r\nher of Grenada’s support as she guides these important \r\ndeliberations towards the implementation of a global \r\npartnership for development. \r\n My delegation would also like to pay tribute to \r\nMr. Jan Eliasson, Foreign Minister of Sweden, who \r\nlaboured tirelessly during his presidency of the sixtieth \r\nsession, and for his efforts in guiding the follow-up \r\nprocess to the Summit Outcome. \r\n My delegation welcomes the Secretary-General’s \r\ntenth and final report, which gives a comprehensive \r\nreview of the Organization’s achievements, challenges \r\nand preparation for the future. It is fitting at this \r\njuncture to convey to the Secretary-General the \r\nappreciation of the Government and people of Grenada \r\nfor his sterling contribution to world peace and security \r\nduring his tenure at the helm of this Organization. The \r\nroad was not always smooth, but with his calm \r\ndisposition, unmistakable eloquence and astute and \r\ndedicated leadership, the Organization was able to \r\novercome the rough patches. We heartily commend his \r\nefforts to strengthen the United Nations through the \r\nreform process, and wish him well in his future \r\nendeavours. \r\n We meet in very difficult times. The effects of \r\nrapid technological changes, new geopolitical and \r\neconomic alliances, evolving rules in international \r\ntrade, and in particular security concerns, continue to \r\ngrip ordinary citizens in our small countries and \r\nregions, worsening the notion of an uncertain future. \r\n My delegation believes that this year’s theme of \r\nimplementing a global partnership for development is \r\ntimely and one which, if we work together, will \r\nenhance our economies in all of their aspects. \r\n It is for that reason that, within our region, we \r\nhave taken the necessary steps in response to the \r\nchallenges we face by deepening our integration \r\narrangements with the creation of the Caribbean \r\nCommunity Single Market and Economy. Recognizing \r\nthe changing trends related to the movement of skills, \r\nGrenada has placed great emphasis on the economic \r\nA/61/PV.21  \r\n \r\n06-53615 12 \r\n \r\nempowerment of its young people, as well as on the \r\ncreation of a more diverse and non-traditional job \r\nsector. Having lost much of our traditional agriculture \r\nthrough natural disasters and the changing global \r\nenvironment, we have been forced to create \r\nalternatives through global partnerships. \r\n Since the adoption of the Millennium \r\nDeclaration, we have encountered untold challenges in \r\nattempting to achieve the prescribed goals. As this \r\nbody is well aware, Grenada, as one of the small States \r\nwhich hold membership in this Organization, has on \r\nmany occasions relied not only on our immediate \r\nregional partners, but also on the wider membership \r\nand respective United Nations agencies during some \r\nvery difficult and trying times. Our most recent past is \r\nnot yet overcome, since we are still rebuilding our \r\nshattered economy following the devastation of two \r\nhurricanes in 2004 and 2005.  \r\n However, despite those challenges, we pledge to \r\ncontinue to work towards the achievement of some of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. We have made \r\nsignificant strides in our efforts to contain the spread of \r\nHIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases. along with \r\nimprovements in education, poverty eradication and \r\nenvironmental sustainability. \r\n Grenada has over the years worked closely and \r\nsuccessfully with the United Nations agencies in our \r\nregion. Therefore, we are hopeful that, during this \r\nsession, no effort will be spared to ensure the \r\nsustainability of those agencies. \r\n My delegation has on numerous occasions made \r\nreference to the unfortunate reality that special and \r\ndifferential treatment for small and vulnerable \r\neconomies is fast becoming a thing of the past. We \r\nhave seen decreases in financial and technical support \r\nfrom traditional partners, and a reduction in the market \r\nfor trade in goods and services. \r\n In that vein, the suspension of the Doha Round of \r\nmultilateral trade negotiations in July 2006 was a \r\nmajor setback for my country. International trade and \r\nreduction in poverty are inextricably linked to \r\ndevelopment. Greater market access for products from \r\ndeveloping countries can lead to economic growth and \r\nhigher standards of living. Grenada therefore looks \r\nforward to the resumption of those negotiations. \r\n In the past few months, the United Nations has \r\nbeen encumbered with the task of maintaining peace \r\nand security in many parts of the world. My delegation \r\ncommends the efforts made in that respect and \r\nwelcomes the creation of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, which will assist States in the post-\r\nconflict era. We extend condolences to the families of \r\nthose brave men and women who lost their lives in the \r\nservice of the organization. Grenada is proud to be a \r\npolice-contributing country with the United Nations \r\nStabilization Mission in Haiti and looks forward to \r\ncontinuing its involvement in that area. \r\n My delegation is well aware that this \r\nOrganization will have to increase its efforts in \r\ncombating terrorism, and welcomes the recently agreed \r\nGlobal Counter-Terrorism Strategy as a positive step in \r\nthat regard. \r\n Grenada makes it clear that it uncompromisingly \r\ncondemns terrorism and all acts of violence, and \r\npledges its full cooperation in combating that \r\nphenomenon. Though my delegation is supportive of \r\nthose measures, as a small island developing State we \r\nare faced with serious financial and technical \r\nconstraints in maintaining continued peace and security \r\nwithin our region. The measures we have implemented \r\nin that respect will be tested as we host the 2007 \r\nCricket World Cup in the Caribbean. \r\n My delegation, in applauding the creation of the \r\nHuman Rights Council, is hopeful that the new body \r\nwill be able through its work to ensure that democracy \r\nand good governance are observed in all their aspects. \r\nWe fully support the Secretary- General’s sentiments \r\nthat mainstreaming all human rights, including the \r\nright to development, is necessary, and support to \r\nMember States in their efforts to build stronger \r\nnational systems for the promotion and protection of \r\nhuman rights is of extreme importance. \r\n Grenada was indeed honoured to participate at \r\nthe highest level in the launching of the new Central \r\nEmergency Response Fund earlier this year and to lend \r\nits support to the growth of the Fund. We commend the \r\nwork of the Organization in that regard and are well \r\naware of the importance of maintaining and supporting \r\nthe Fund, especially since, globally, there has been an \r\nincrease in natural and humanitarian disasters. We are \r\npleased with the decision to expand the relationship \r\noutside of the membership to include the private, \r\nindividual and non-governmental sectors. \r\n We call on the international community to honour \r\nits responsibility and commitment to the full \r\n A/61/PV.21\r\n \r\n13 06-53615 \r\n \r\nimplementation of the Mauritius Strategy and to \r\nsupport programmes in our region related to early \r\nwarning systems, the Catastrophe Risk Insurance \r\nFacility, and vulnerability reduction, while at the same \r\ntime building resilience. \r\n My delegation has taken note of the resolution on \r\ndevelopment. However, we are disappointed that this \r\naspect of the Summit Outcome has not progressed with \r\nthe kind of vigour we would have welcomed. That is of \r\nspecial importance to countries like my own, since \r\nsupport for development objectives is paramount to our \r\neconomic sustainability. We cannot fail to reiterate our \r\nvulnerability and call for swift action at this session in \r\norder to ensure the stability of our small societies. \r\n My delegation salutes the Secretary-General’s \r\nefforts to strengthen the Organization through its \r\nengagement with civil society and other non-State \r\nactors, and agrees that they are important to the \r\nlegitimacy of democratic ideals.  Grenada has \r\nincreased its efforts to strengthen the relationship \r\nbetween Government and the private sector through \r\npartnerships in trade, education, health, tourism and \r\ninvestment activities, and has already seen positive \r\nresults from this type of engagement, especially in the \r\naftermath of the recent hurricanes. \r\n 2007 will mark the bicentenary of the passage of \r\nthe act abolishing the trans-Atlantic slave trade in the \r\nBritish empire, and it is anticipated that the General \r\nAssembly will hold a commemorative event to mark \r\nthat historic occasion. The members of the Caribbean \r\nCommunity will submit a draft resolution to the \r\nGeneral Assembly, and we expect the full support of all \r\nMember States in that regard. \r\n We, along with other members of the Caribbean \r\nCommunity, feel compelled on a regular basis to make \r\nthe plea for special attention to be paid to the threat \r\nfacing the Caribbean Sea. Grenada therefore takes this \r\nopportunity to reiterate its concerns over the \r\ntransshipment of nuclear waste and other hazardous \r\nmaterial through the marine environment of the \r\nCaribbean. The Caribbean Sea provides for us a \r\nlifeline, the potential loss of which could be enormous \r\nto our people’s livelihood. As we are well aware, loss \r\nof economic opportunities brings with it poverty and \r\nsocial unrest and ultimately threatens democracy — a \r\nsolid tradition on which the Caribbean Community \r\ncontinues to pride itself. We therefore urge \r\nunderstanding and solidarity with our cause. \r\n My delegation applauds the Organization for its \r\nwork in the areas of reform and looks forward to the \r\ncontinuation of that process, especially in the areas of \r\ndevelopment, Economic and Social Council reform, \r\nSecretariat and management reform, Security Council \r\nreform, system-wide coherence, disarmament and non-\r\nproliferation, and other areas that have received only \r\npartial attention. Let us pursue with vigour our work in \r\nensuring that this body finds ways not only to sustain, \r\nbut to continue to build on the successes of its past \r\nachievements. \r\n The many challenges that we all now face make it \r\nnecessary that we work together to make the planet a \r\nbetter place for future generations. Let us, then, \r\ncommit ourselves to cooperating with and supporting \r\neach other in the journey towards genuine \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Finally, my delegation, having listened to the \r\ndebate over the past few days, is heartened by the \r\npledges of support and is convinced that, together, we \r\ncan make it work to our collective benefit. Grenada is \r\npleased to join in that pledge and looks forward to \r\nworking with the Organization and its partners in \r\nattaining that goal. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Raphael Tuju, MP, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Kenya. \r\n Mr. Tuju (Kenya): Let me add my voice of \r\ncongratulations to President Sheikha Haya Rashed \r\nAl-Khalifa on her assumption of this driving seat, \r\nwhich has mainly been occupied by men in the history \r\nof the United Nations. Before this Assembly last week, \r\nwe welcomed the first African woman to become a \r\nnational President — Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf of Liberia. \r\nAt last, the glass ceiling that has tended to frustrate the \r\nattempts of women to become presidents is surely \r\ncracking in several places. We should celebrate that. \r\n Let me also congratulate Ambassador Jan \r\nEliasson of Sweden for a job well done as President of \r\nthis Assembly. \r\n Kenya is a United Nations country. We attach \r\nspecial significance to our being hosts of the biggest \r\nUnited Nations centre outside the developed world — \r\nthe United Nations Office at Nairobi, which also hosts \r\nthe global headquarters of the United Nations \r\nEnvironment Programme and the United Nations \r\nHuman Settlements Programme. We are a major \r\nA/61/PV.21  \r\n \r\n06-53615 14 \r\n \r\ncontributor to United Nations peace missions around \r\nthe world. We subscribe to the principles and ideals of \r\nthis Organization and have always upheld its Charter. \r\n In my contribution to this general debate, allow \r\nme to dwell on the crisis that is Somalia. I do not think \r\nthat I need to remind the world that there is a crisis in \r\nSomalia, but I believe that I must encourage the \r\ncommunity of nations to understand that the problem \r\nof Somalia is not going to go away unless we take \r\ndeliberate steps to address the crisis. The comfortable \r\nthing to do is to look at Somalia as being far away and \r\nhope that the problem will resolve itself somehow. \r\n This afternoon, I bring the bad news that the \r\nproblem of Somalia is not going to get resolved \r\nsomehow by itself. All of us, the community of \r\nnations, must chip in. If, for a moment, we dwell on the \r\ncomforting notion that Somali does not concern us, \r\nthen it may be worth talking to my friends from South \r\nKorea or China, which are 8,000 to 10,000 kilometres \r\naway from Somalia. A few months ago, pirates from \r\nSomalia hijacked merchant ships in international \r\nwaters off the coast of Somalia. It was only after \r\nprotracted negotiations that included use of Kenyan \r\nintelligence that the merchant seamen from South \r\nKorea and China were released safely to their families. \r\n I recount this story of merchant seamen so that all \r\nof us in the international community should appreciate \r\nthat the Somali phenomenon, with no Government in \r\nplace, is a danger not just to neighbouring countries, \r\nbut to the whole world. As criminal elements establish \r\ntheir safe enclaves in a country like Somalia, the \r\nneighbouring countries and the international \r\ncommunity are soon forced to intervene, even \r\nmilitarily, to free hostages, to hunt terrorists or to flush \r\nout rebels. \r\n In the new global village, we are all neighbours \r\nof Somalia. As a front-line State to that country in \r\ncrisis, we have participated in negotiations to free \r\nhostages. We have cooperated in attempts to arrest \r\ncriminal elements. We continue to host close to a \r\nmillion refugees. We provide life-saving support in \r\nterms of medical facilities and supplies. But above all, \r\nwe continue to work on efforts to create peace in \r\nSomalia. The Transitional Federal Government, the \r\nTransitional Charter and the Transitional Federal \r\nParliament were established all as a result of a process \r\nthat took place in Nairobi when we hosted up to 2,000 \r\nrepresentatives from a cross-section of Somalia over a \r\nperiod of two years. \r\n Today, I appeal to the rest of the world to take \r\ndeliberate steps to help Somalia. The time to help is \r\nnow. Tomorrow may be too late. \r\n There are many communities around the world \r\nthat attach great importance to funerals. In those \r\ncommunities, most people only stand by and watch \r\nwhen their kin have fallen ill. An occasional visit and \r\nsome token of support are what obtains. As soon as the \r\npatient dies, an avalanche of support flows in. The \r\ncommunity of nations must not take that cynical or \r\nundertaker’s approach. We are already too late, and any \r\nintervention we implement now is of an ambulance-\r\nand-fire-brigade variety, at best, but it is better than \r\nsimply standing by like spectators. \r\n Somalia is almost dying. We can see it. We have \r\nknown that for the past 16 years. This is the time to \r\nsend in life-saving support. It is really a tribute to the \r\nresilience of the Somali people that there are still living \r\nhuman beings in that country. One day or one month \r\nwithout Government, police, hospitals or banks in \r\nmodern society is unimaginable. The Somalis have \r\nendured for 16 years. How much longer are they \r\nexpected to endure? Where is the international rescue \r\nplan with a billion dollars? Where is the Marshall Plan \r\nfor Somalia? \r\n Even a much better but devastated Japan and \r\nGermany needed a Marshall Plan after the Second \r\nWorld War. We in our region are sure that humanitarian \r\nintervention now will yield better and faster results \r\nthan military intervention and at a much cheaper price \r\nthan sending troops to pursue criminal elements in a \r\nfailed State. That is not rocket science or complex \r\neconomic theory. That is common sense. All we need is \r\nthe will and the focus to apply ourselves collectively to \r\nthe problem of Somalia. I appreciate how difficult it is \r\nto be focused, given the several competing issues \r\naround the world, but focused we must be if we are to \r\navoid the current flip-flopping from one crisis to \r\nanother like chickens with their heads cut off.  \r\n I hear talk today about religious extremists in \r\nSomalia. What did we expect? Our own seven-year-old \r\nchildren become extremists in our households if they \r\ngo without food for one day. Somali children, youth, \r\nwomen and men have been going hungry for 16 years \r\nand living under very difficult circumstances. To be \r\nextremist is the normal human reaction in such \r\n A/61/PV.21\r\n \r\n15 06-53615 \r\n \r\ncircumstances and one does not have to have studied \r\npsychiatry at the PhD level to recognize that. If similar \r\ncircumstances in Somalia prevailed in other countries, \r\nwe all know that moderation would be the exception. \r\n Yesterday, I had the opportunity to brief the \r\nSecurity Council on the position of the \r\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) \r\non Somalia. Our IGAD position is to support the \r\nTransitional Federal Government, together with such \r\nlegitimate transitional federal institutions as the \r\nParliament in Baidoa and the Transitional Charter that \r\nis the broadly negotiated road map for Somalia. \r\n As IGAD, we have also opened a window of \r\ndialogue with the Islamic Courts Union (ICU). Some \r\nfour weeks ago, I met representatives of the ICU in \r\nNairobi. We believe that, as in all situations of conflict, \r\nthe final resolution is best achieved through dialogue. \r\nThat is why, in our communiqué issued in Nairobi, we \r\nwelcomed the Khartoum talks that brought together the \r\nTransitional Federal Government and the ICU. But we \r\nare also concerned that communiqués after these \r\ndialogue conferences should be genuine. Soon after the \r\nKhartoum meeting, the news from Somalia has not \r\nbeen encouraging. There was an assassination attempt \r\non the life of President Yusuf. One more city was \r\novertaken by the ICU, not to mention the cold-blooded \r\nmurder of a long-serving humanitarian worker, a \r\ndedicated Catholic nun. The upbeat communiqué \r\nreleased from Khartoum begins to look like a sandwich \r\nwithout meat, fed to a world that is starved of any \r\nencouraging news from Somalia. \r\n There is a critical path that was set up by IGAD \r\nwith the help of the international community and that \r\nresulted in the formation of the Somali Transitional \r\nCharter that is recognized by the African Union and the \r\nUnited Nations. We are encouraged by the United \r\nNations positive endorsement of the Transitional \r\nCharter, which includes the Transitional Federal \r\nGovernment and the Transitional Federal Parliament. \r\nIndeed, the Transitional Federal Government is fully \r\naccredited to the United Nations, the African Union \r\nand IGAD, and the presidency of the Security Council \r\nhas articulated that recognition through its various \r\ncommunications, including the presidential statement \r\nof 13 July.  \r\n However, there is a major obstacle faced by the \r\nTransitional Federal Government of Somalia. Without \r\nsubstantive international support beyond the \r\nrecognitions, accreditations, resolutions and statements \r\nI have alluded to, the bottom line remains that the \r\nTransitional Federal Government is like people thrown \r\ninto the deep end of turbulent waters and are expected \r\nto swim with their hands tied behind their backs while \r\nhungry crocodiles surround them. It is not a very \r\nencouraging scenario. That is why we appeal for more \r\nmeaningful support for the Transitional Federal \r\nGovernment, even as we insist that it continue to \r\ndialogue with various groupings in Somalia. \r\n The international community must work to help \r\nSomalia and not inadvertently compound the problem \r\nin that country. It is vital that the international \r\ncommunity consolidate its efforts and not send \r\ndiscordant messages from Stockholm, New York, \r\nNairobi, Khartoum, Cairo, Addis Ababa or anywhere \r\nelse. Whatever the motives behind the proliferation of \r\ninitiatives from different capitals, we must recognize \r\nthat discordant signals act only to give incentive to \r\nsome of the actors on the ground to attempt to establish \r\nnew facts on the ground that they may leverage in \r\nfuture negotiations. \r\n I discussed that matter with the Secretary-General \r\nof the Arab League this morning and yesterday. Kenya \r\nhas put forward the following proposal, which I would \r\nlike to share with the General Assembly. We propose \r\nthat an international joint committee on Somalia be \r\nconstituted with the following membership: IGAD, \r\nrepresenting the front-line States; the African Union; \r\nthe Arab League, also representing the front-line \r\nStates; the European Union; and the United Nations, \r\nwith at least one or two permanent members of the \r\nSecurity Council to be included. It is our submission \r\nthat the international joint commission will help \r\nconsolidate our efforts and bring about a speedier \r\nresolution of the problem.  \r\n It is worth noting that the initiative that resulted \r\nin the formation of the current Transitional Federal \r\nGovernment was the fourteenth attempt to resolve the \r\nSomali conflict after 14 years. Its collapse would bring \r\nus back to square one in terms of coming up with an \r\ninstitutional framework that enjoys political legitimacy. \r\nThe Secretary-General of the Arab League has \r\nexpressed his support for the Kenyan proposal and we \r\nhope that we can proceed on that path by building on \r\nthe foundations already established by IGAD, rather \r\nthan allow another proliferation of vertical initiatives. \r\nWe appeal to other partners to embrace the proposal. \r\nA/61/PV.21  \r\n \r\n06-53615 16 \r\n \r\n On a more hopeful note, let me register our \r\ndelight at the progress made by our neighbours \r\nTanzania, Uganda and South Africa in brokering the \r\nBurundi peace agreement. We commend their \r\ncollective effort. The news from the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo is also encouraging. \r\n As Kenya takes over the chairmanship of the \r\nInternational Conference on the Great Lakes Region, \r\nwhich will convene in December this year, let me \r\nassure the Assembly that we will do our best to \r\ncontribute to the stabilization of our region, which is \r\nreally a very tough neighbourhood to live in. \r\n Finally, let me congratulate Secretary-General \r\nKofi Annan on his exemplary stewardship of this world \r\nbody. As a brother from Africa, I can confidently say \r\nthat he has done us proud. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Frederick M. \r\nMitchell, MP, Minister for Foreign Affairs and the \r\nPublic Service of the Bahamas. \r\n Mr. Mitchell (Bahamas): I congratulate Sheikha \r\nHaya Rashed Al-Khalifa on assuming the presidency of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-first session. I also \r\ncommend her predecessor, Jan Eliasson of Sweden, for \r\nhis outstanding performance as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at the preceding session. \r\n I acknowledge and pay tribute to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan for his many years of dedication \r\nto the United Nations. The Government and people of \r\nthe Bahamas are profoundly grateful to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Annan for all that he has done for the United \r\nNations, and I look forward to welcoming him one day \r\nto the Bahamas so that we might thank him personally. \r\n I also congratulate and welcome Montenegro as \r\nthe 192nd State Member of the United Nations and \r\nconvey the best wishes of the Government of the \r\nBahamas for the prosperity and welfare of all its \r\npeople. \r\n The Bahamas stands for democracy, the rule of \r\nlaw and the right to self-determination. In this very \r\nbody, before the Committee of 24 on decolonization, \r\nour national leaders made the case for the \r\nindependence of our country. We were able to achieve \r\nthat in 1973, and ever since then successive \r\nadministrations have voiced the Bahamas’ support of \r\nthe same principles. I do so again today. In doing so, I \r\nremind this body that the Bahamas and the region of \r\nwhich it is a part are shining examples to all the world \r\nof all of those principles. Within the next year, the \r\nBahamian people will again have the opportunity to \r\nchoose their Government in a general election based on \r\nuniversal adult suffrage. There have been, within the \r\npast year in our region, similar general elections in St. \r\nVincent and the Grenadines and Guyana. The Bahamas \r\ndoes not support the use of the military in Government \r\nor to overthrow legitimately elected Governments. \r\nWherever that occurs, it must be deplored and there \r\nmust be a return to constitutional democratic rule \r\nwithin the shortest possible time. \r\n In our foreign policy, the Bahamas believes in \r\npeace with all nations and we seek to avoid ideological \r\nbattles. Ours is a policy that avoids extremism, while at \r\nthe same time letting our voice be heard for the \r\ndispossessed. We have the right to be here to speak for \r\nourselves and to speak for those who cannot speak. Our \r\npeople have fought for their voice to be heard and they \r\nwill be heard. \r\n My delegation welcomes the attempt by the \r\nSecurity Council to increase the transparency of the \r\nselection process in that body for the post of Secretary-\r\nGeneral by apprising the President of the General \r\nAssembly of its proposed actions on this matter and on \r\nthe results of the straw polls. We would take this \r\nopportunity to assure this body that whoever succeeds \r\nto the post will have our support and cooperation. \r\n It was just over a year ago that we adopted the \r\n2005 World Summit Outcome Document that has \r\nserved as the road map for reform efforts over the past \r\n12 months. The Bahamas, like other States Members of \r\nthis Organization, is pleased that a number of reforms \r\nhave been implemented. In that regard, we note the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. With regard to the Human Rights Council, we \r\nhope that it will evolve as an entity dedicated to a \r\nprocess of constructive dialogue and cooperation in \r\nwhich all countries may participate on an equal \r\nfooting. \r\n The Bahamas renews its commitment to the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, and in particular to \r\nuniversal education, fighting HIV/AIDS, equality for \r\nwomen and cutting poverty in half by 2015. The \r\ncountry’s international, award-winning Urban Renewal \r\nInitiative has begun to address in particular the issue of \r\npoverty in the Bahamas. The further reform of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council should lead to its being \r\n A/61/PV.21\r\n \r\n17 06-53615 \r\n \r\nempowered to implement the internationally agreed \r\ndevelopment goals and commitments to the eradication \r\nof poverty, hunger and all other ills that continue to \r\nplague humanity. \r\n I turn now to the United Nations Global Counter-\r\nTerrorism Strategy and the issue of regional global \r\nsecurity. We renew our commitments in that area. \r\nHowever, as we have done for the past four years, we \r\nwant to take the opportunity to further define our \r\nsecurity interests as not being limited to the strategies \r\ndefined by a narrow view of counter-terrorism. We \r\nbelieve that counter-terrorism strategies should be \r\ninformed by a much broader definition, namely, as \r\nensuring the stability of our societies as we fight our \r\nvulnerabilities to drug traffickers, natural and \r\nenvironmental disasters and poverty, and our \r\nchallenges with education and health care. In \r\nparticular, we call upon the developed economies in \r\nour region and further afield to remember their moral \r\nand legal obligations to stop the assault of small arms \r\non our societies, to cooperate in stopping the flow of \r\ndrugs through our region, and to work together with us \r\nin declaring the Caribbean Sea and its environs to be a \r\nnuclear-free zone. There must be a strategic alliance \r\nbetween developed economies and those in our region \r\nto ensure that those security vulnerabilities are \r\nminimized, if not eliminated. \r\n The Bahamas is greatly heartened by the fact that \r\nMember States have agreed on the text of the \r\nconvention on the rights of persons with disabilities, \r\nwhich is to be adopted by the General Assembly in the \r\nmonths ahead. That landmark convention recognizes \r\nthe importance for persons with disabilities of their \r\nindividual autonomy and independence, including the \r\nfreedom to make their own choices, and it \r\nacknowledges that those persons should have the \r\nopportunity to be actively involved in decision-making \r\nprocesses about policies and programmes, particularly \r\nthose of direct concern to them. That is an important \r\nstep in empowering not only persons with disabilities, \r\nbut also the neighbourhoods, communities, societies \r\nand countries in which they live. For too long, persons \r\nwith disabilities have been marginalized in many \r\nsettings, depriving them of their rights as citizens and \r\ndepriving society of the many contributions they could \r\nmake in the exercise of their full and unimpeded \r\nparticipation. The Bahamas plans legislation to further \r\nempower the disabled during the current session of our \r\nParliament. \r\n It has often been said that reform is a process and \r\nnot an event. We continue to support reform of the \r\nSecurity Council so that it may more accurately reflect \r\nthe interests and balance of power in the realities of the \r\ntwenty-first century, including allowing small island \r\ndeveloping States to play a greater role in its activities. \r\nIt is our hope that, during this sixty-first session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, we will see some significant \r\nmovement in the reform of the Security Council. \r\n Any reform would mean very little, however, if it \r\ndid not ultimately translate into the well-being of the \r\npeople of this planet. In that vein, the Bahamas will do \r\nits part towards the implementation of the global \r\npartnership for development and the translation of that \r\npartnership into not only effective international, \r\nmultilateral economic, trading, financial and \r\nenvironmental governance systems and mechanisms, \r\nbut also into the proliferation of healthy, productive \r\nhouseholds and communities that contribute to \r\nincreased global welfare and security.  \r\n We want to take this opportunity to recall our \r\nconcern about coercive measures by developed States \r\nthat adversely affect the trade in services in the \r\nBahamian economy and in our region generally. We \r\nreiterate our call for levelling the playing field and for \r\na global forum to address how the issue of a level \r\nplaying field can be translated into international public \r\npolicy. \r\n The Bahamas welcomed and participated in the \r\nrecent High-level Dialogue on International Migration \r\nand Development. At that time, the Bahamas outlined \r\nthe many positive impacts that international migration \r\nhad made on its economy and cultural development. \r\nHowever, the Bahamas also noted the many challenges \r\nthe country had experienced over the previous 60 years \r\nin managing migration, including those related to the \r\nprevention of irregular or unauthorized migration.  \r\n For the Bahamas, irregular or unauthorized \r\nmigration has given rise to considerable challenges in \r\nthe social and educational sectors, as well as to serious \r\nnational security issues. In this regard, the Bahamas \r\nhas pledged to work with our partners in the region \r\ntowards the establishment of a better way to match the \r\nsupply with the demand for migration in safe, legal, \r\nhumane and orderly ways, in order to maximize the \r\nsocietal and human development potential of global \r\nlabour mobility, with the involvement of private-sector \r\nand public-sector stakeholders. \r\nA/61/PV.21  \r\n \r\n06-53615 18 \r\n \r\n The Bahamas is committed to sustainable \r\ndevelopment. To a small-island developing State, there \r\nare few things more important than securing the \r\nnecessary assistance in order to build resilience against \r\nthe many hazards that afflict the country on a \r\nconsistent basis, including violent storms or hurricanes, \r\nwhich pass through our region even more frequently as \r\na result of global warming. In this connection, we look \r\nto our partners in the region, the hemisphere and \r\naround the world to reduce greenhouse gases. We call \r\non those countries that have not yet done so to sign the \r\nKyoto Protocol. It is also imperative that we all \r\ncommit ourselves to the development of alternative \r\nsources of energy, in order to become less dependent \r\non the current polluting technologies that supply our \r\nenergy needs but threaten our sustainability. \r\n The Bahamas would like to take this opportunity \r\nto once again congratulate the people of one of our \r\nregional partners, Haiti, on the election and installation \r\nof its democratically elected Government. It is \r\nimperative that the international community do all it \r\npossibly can to help Haiti establish stability and \r\nsecurity and promote sustained and sustainable \r\ndevelopment within its national borders. \r\n As I have stated on previous occasions, the \r\nBahamas, which sits some 90 miles over the seas to the \r\nnorth of Haiti, has a special interest in its stability and \r\nprosperity. Instability in Haiti is bound to cause \r\ninstability in the Bahamas. A significant proportion of \r\nthe population in the Bahamas is either Haitian or of \r\nHaitian descent. A migration crisis resulting from \r\ninstability in Haiti will have an immediate effect on the \r\nBahamas. Such a crisis would be difficult for our \r\ncountry to endure and, with the will of the Haitian \r\ncommunity and the support of the world community, \r\nwe believe that it can and should be avoided. \r\n The Bahamas has always made known its support \r\nfor the people of Haiti and their aspirations for peace, \r\nsecurity and development. We have and continue to \r\ntake seriously our commitment to assist the people of \r\nHaiti in taking charge of their destiny and placing their \r\ncountry on the path to enduring democracy and \r\ndevelopment. The Bahamas believes that it is therefore \r\nimperative that the promised international financial \r\nassistance to Haiti is delivered in a timely and efficient \r\nmanner. \r\n I would also like to take this opportunity to signal \r\nmy Government’s support for the upcoming Caribbean \r\nCommunity (CARICOM) and Caribbean Common \r\nMarket initiative to encourage the United Nations to \r\nmark and commemorate the 200th anniversary of the \r\nabolition of the transatlantic slave trade in 2007. \r\nSlavery and the concomitant slave trade together stand \r\nas one of the most vicious violations of human rights in \r\nrecorded history. As the global sentinel for human \r\nrights, the United Nations has a duty to highlight the \r\n200th anniversary of the cessation of this crime against \r\nhumanity with a special event in 2007. We hope that \r\nthis initiative will receive the wide and enthusiastic \r\nsupport of this General Assembly and indeed of the \r\nwider United Nations community. \r\n This commemoration will present an ideal \r\nopportunity to pay tribute to peoples of African descent \r\nacross the entire spectrum of the diaspora who share a \r\ncommon heritage and, having survived the middle \r\npassage, have gone on to form the bedrock on which \r\nthe prosperity of many developed countries has been \r\nbuilt. For its part, the Bahamas plans to undertake a \r\nnumber of commemorative events including a festival \r\nof arts which will run from March 2007 to January \r\n2008. During the festival, a different country or region \r\nof Africa will be showcased each month as a means of \r\nexposing Bahamians to the rich culture of Africa \r\nthrough theatre, art, music and dance. \r\n One of the other challenges that we will face \r\nduring this session is reaching agreement on the scale \r\nof assessments for the apportionment of expenses of \r\nthe United Nations for the next triennium. We look \r\nforward to engaging with other Member States to \r\nachieve a scale of assessments that is broadly based on \r\nthe principle of the capacity to pay, and that it is \r\ntransparent, equitable and stable. \r\n The Bahamas continues to believe that the \r\nCharter of the United Nations constitutes a viable and \r\nfirm foundation on which the Organization can balance \r\nand achieve its objectives to maintain international \r\npeace and security and to promote economic and social \r\nprogress. I want to take this opportunity to reaffirm the \r\ncommitment of the Bahamas to the principles \r\nenshrined in that universal document, as well as to the \r\nongoing process of reform, which seeks to more \r\neffectively translate these principles into real peace, \r\nsecurity and sustainable development for all the \r\nworld’s inhabitants. While dramatic progress may \r\nsometimes evade us, we must not be swayed from our \r\ncourse, and we must remain confident that our \r\n A/61/PV.21\r\n \r\n19 06-53615 \r\n \r\nactivities and efforts will benefit future generations. \r\nNow more than ever we need the United Nations. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Rudolph Insanally, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Guyana and former President of \r\nthe General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Insanally (Guyana): Just about a month ago, \r\nthe people of Guyana went to the polls to vote for the \r\nGovernment of their choice. Witnessed by an \r\nunprecedented number of observers drawn from several \r\ncountries and international organizations, including the \r\nUnited Nations, the elections were deemed to be free, \r\nfair and transparent. With a renewed mandate, the \r\nGovernment led by President Bharrat Jagdeo, has \r\nrecommitted itself to the pursuit of democratic \r\ngovernance at home and to a progressive foreign policy \r\nabroad. \r\n I am pleased, on behalf of the Government and \r\nthe people of Guyana to convey to the President of the \r\nAssembly our warmest congratulations on her election \r\nand to wish her much success during her term of office. \r\nTo her predecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson of Sweden, I \r\nwould like to express our appreciation and thanks for \r\ndirecting the work of the Assembly this past year with \r\nconsiderable expertise and aplomb. And to our \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, who demits his \r\npost later this year, I wish to offer our sincere gratitude \r\nfor his impressive leadership of the United Nations \r\nduring an uncertain and challenging period. He leaves \r\nwith our best wishes for his future health and \r\nhappiness. \r\n As a fledgling democracy, Guyana is proud to be \r\npart of the family of free nations. We are dedicated to \r\nthe creation of a society based on equity and social \r\njustice that guarantees to all our citizens their \r\nfundamental freedoms and rights. To this end, we have \r\nenshrined in our Constitution provisions for the full \r\nenjoyment of these entitlements. In the same spirit, we \r\nhave acceded to the many international treaties and \r\nconventions that embody agreements on the rights of \r\npeoples. Article 154 A of our Constitution guarantees \r\nthat “such rights embodied in these international \r\ninstruments shall be respected and upheld by the \r\nexecutive, legislature, judiciary and all organizations \r\nand agencies of Government”. We are thus fully \r\ncommitted to international cooperation for global \r\npeace and development. \r\n The President of the Assembly is to be \r\ncommended for proposing for discussion by this \r\nAssembly the topic “Implementing the global \r\npartnership for development”. Ever since its \r\nestablishment in 1945, the United Nations has laboured \r\nto produce an effective development strategy. Decade \r\nafter decade, several proposals were laboriously \r\ndrafted, only to be quickly relegated to the archives. It \r\nwas not surprising, therefore, that countries, especially \r\nthe developing nations, eventually became \r\ndisillusioned owing to the little that was achieved. \r\n The World Hearings on Development that were \r\nheld during Guyana’s presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its forty-eighth session sought a new \r\napproach to the issue of development by bringing \r\ntogether all the relevant actors — distinguished world \r\nleaders, member Governments, the private sector, \r\nnon-governmental organizations and other elements of \r\ncivil society — to analyse deficiencies in international \r\ncooperation. What was needed, it was said, was a new \r\ndevelopment architecture, not a tinkering with the old. \r\n Following up on the promise of these hearings, \r\nthe General Assembly proceeded in 1997 to elaborate \r\nan agenda for development. There could be no more \r\ncomprehensive and compelling document than that. \r\nYet, it too was soon buried and forgotten. By the year \r\n2000, the international community had decided that \r\nenough was enough and that instead of forging yet \r\nanother declaration it would set for itself certain \r\nprecise and time-bound goals.  \r\n Our pursuit of these Millennium Development \r\nGoals thus far has shown that while our efforts may \r\nindeed lift some countries out of poverty, significant \r\nand sustainable development will be achieved only \r\nthrough the international cooperation required in \r\nGoal 8. It is worthy of note that, while there are clear \r\nmeasurements of progress under Goals 1 to 7, no well-\r\ndefined indicators exist for Goal 8 — the global \r\npartnership for development — an omission that \r\nclearly limits the effort at cooperation and creates an \r\nimbalance in the partnership. \r\n If I have delved into the history of the \r\ndevelopment challenge, it is not to dwell on the past, \r\nbut rather to draw from it lessons that may help us in \r\nthe future to translate our long-held aspirations into \r\nearly reality. Allow me, therefore, to offer some \r\nthoughts on how the global partnership for \r\ndevelopment may be strengthened.  \r\nA/61/PV.21  \r\n \r\n06-53615 20 \r\n \r\n As was determined at Monterrey, partnership, \r\ncoherence and accountability are vital to the fulfilment \r\nof our development goals. Without close and genuine \r\ncooperation between donors and recipients, there is not \r\nlikely to be significant progress. At the national level \r\ncountries should own their development strategies, \r\nwhile at the international level there should be greater \r\ncoordination and consistency of support in the trade, \r\nmonetary and financial systems. Much too often it is \r\nthe developing countries that are scrutinized and \r\nscolded for their shortcomings, while their developed \r\npartners are considered above blame. True partnership \r\nrequires mutual accountability. Accordingly, we would \r\npropose that there should be some verification of donor \r\npledges and periodic reviews of performance on both \r\nsides. \r\n Implementation of the global partnership would \r\nbe greatly facilitated if the task were to be seen in \r\nterms of mutual benefit and not of charity or \r\nobligation. Both sides must be involved in the \r\ndecision-making process in all cooperation agreements. \r\nSuch participation would produce a greater sense of \r\nownership by the developing countries and, \r\nconsequently, a deeper sense of commitment to \r\nexecution. At the recent World Bank/IMF meeting held \r\nin Singapore and chaired by the President of Guyana, \r\nthe IMF Managing Director is reported to have \r\nproposed a rearrangement of quotas that would enable \r\ndeveloping countries to be more involved in decision-\r\nmaking. Although the change cannot be considered as \r\ncomprehensive as necessary, it is, nonetheless, a first \r\nstep toward more democratic governance in the \r\nmanagement of development.  \r\n Furthermore, given the inadequacy of resources \r\nthat have been available thus far for development, we \r\nmust endeavour to identify, as we pledged in \r\nMonterrey, new and additional sources of financing. \r\nThe Millennium Challenge Account and the \r\nInternational Finance Facility have been welcome \r\nattempts to provide fresh funding. More recently, at the \r\ninitiative of France, Brazil and others a tax on air travel \r\nhas been proposed — and implemented by some \r\ncountries — and promises to provide substantial \r\nrevenues to support development. Similar proposals, \r\nsuch as the Tobin tax, a tax on pollution and a \r\nlow-elasticity commodities tax, are on the table. What \r\nis needed now is a serious evaluation of these \r\nsuggestions to determine their feasibility for \r\nimplementation by the international community. \r\n Implementation of the global partnership \r\nundoubtedly suffers from the “beggar-thy-neighbour” \r\nattitude that exists in international economic and trade \r\nrelations. As evidenced in the recent Doha \r\nDevelopment Round negotiations, the predominant \r\ninterests of the developed countries in such areas as \r\nagriculture, subsidies and services have effectively \r\ndenied developing nations, more particularly the small \r\nand vulnerable, any prospect of significant \r\nparticipation in the global economy. Without expanded \r\ntrade opportunities, investment and a comprehensive \r\nframework of support, development for many countries \r\nwill continue to be elusive. We need, therefore, to \r\nensure that the Doha Development Round is revived \r\nand that broad assistance is provided to serve the \r\npurposes of development. \r\n An increasingly formidable challenge to \r\nimplementing the development agenda is the spread of \r\ntransboundary crime, including arms and drug \r\ntrafficking, which has reached new and alarming levels \r\nthat cripple economic growth. Governments can ill \r\nafford the resources needed to fight the drug lords, who \r\nare themselves endowed with considerable assets and \r\nartillery. Unfortunately, whatever assistance is \r\nprovided by donor countries and relevant agencies is \r\nwoefully inadequate to deal with the onslaught. This \r\ngrowing insurgency can be counteracted only by \r\ngreater determination on the part of the United Nations \r\nsystem to collaborate fully to crush transboundary \r\ncrime. Our developed partners therefore need to do \r\nmore to assist in the fight against this scourge. \r\n A more serious inhibitor to economic growth and \r\nsocial progress is the current unsettled international \r\npolitical climate, in which recourse to conflict is seen \r\nas a ready means of settling international issues. The \r\negregious examples of Iraq and Lebanon, where force \r\nhas been used to achieve political aims and objectives, \r\nhave clearly shown that violence solves nothing. \r\nIndeed, the havoc and destruction wrought by war \r\nseriously diminish the prospects for development, \r\nwhether in the Middle East or elsewhere. The agenda \r\nfor peace cannot be implemented without due regard to \r\nthe agenda for development. \r\n The Government of Guyana has long been \r\npersuaded of the need for a new global human \r\neconomic and social order that is capable of delivering \r\ntrue democracy and social justice to all peoples. First \r\nposited in 1994 at the World Summit on Social \r\nDevelopment by the late President Jagan of Guyana, \r\n A/61/PV.21\r\n \r\n21 06-53615 \r\n \r\nthe concept is premised on a comprehensive and \r\nholistic approach to development aimed at achieving \r\nmore inclusive economic and social progress. The new \r\nglobal human order initiative, which is already being \r\nconsidered by this Organization and has been \r\nsupported by many Member States, seeks to create a \r\nconsensus on a new model of development that would \r\nbe based on genuine partnership among States and a \r\njoint endeavour to secure peace and prosperity for all. \r\n No less formidable and challenging to the \r\ndevelopment agenda than the international political and \r\neconomic environment is the fragile ecosystem in \r\nwhich we now live. We have all witnessed the \r\nincreasing number of earthquakes, floods, tropical \r\nstorms and hurricanes, which cause catastrophic \r\ndamage wherever they occur. Less than two years ago, \r\nmy own country was struck by a flood, resulting in \r\ndamage equivalent to 60 per cent of our gross domestic \r\nproduct. It would be foolish — perhaps fatal — if we \r\ndid not prepare ourselves to anticipate and withstand \r\nsuch disasters. Early-warning systems should be \r\nestablished across the globe and financial resources \r\nmade available to the United Nations fund to facilitate \r\nearly responses and recovery. In short, disaster \r\nmitigation should now become an integral part of the \r\ndevelopment agenda. \r\n Experience has taught us that development is a \r\ncomplex and complicated phenomenon, and that the \r\nmany challenges we now face are such that they cannot \r\nbe overcome without full international cooperation. Yet \r\nour responses continue to be ad hoc and woefully \r\ninadequate to deal with the resolution of the problems \r\nthat we are confronting. The development agenda has \r\nnow become more extensive and is very urgent. With \r\ncourage and vision, we must renew our commitment to \r\nthe implementation of the global partnership for \r\ndevelopment. Our common humanity and, indeed, a \r\ncommon sense of decency and morality, demand no \r\nless. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I give \r\nthe floor to His Excellency Mr. Anthony Hylton, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade of \r\nJamaica. \r\n Mr. Hylton (Jamaica): It is an honour for me to \r\naddress the General Assembly at its sixty-first session \r\non behalf of my country, Jamaica. \r\n I would like to congratulate Ms. Haya Rashed \r\nAl-Khalifa on her election as President of the \r\nAssembly. It is a particular pleasure for me today to \r\nacknowledge that achievement, as she is one of only \r\nthree women in the history of the General Assembly to \r\nhave occupied that post, and — significantly — the \r\nfirst since 1969, nearly 40 years ago. \r\n I would also take this opportunity to express deep \r\nappreciation for the work carried out during the sixtieth \r\nsession of the Assembly by Mr. Jan Eliasson, under \r\nwhose leadership so much was accomplished in an \r\nextraordinarily challenging year, notably the adoption \r\nof the World Summit Outcome Document. \r\n As we begin this new United Nations year, we \r\nask ourselves, “What is the state of our world?” We ask \r\nthis particularly in the context of the determination and \r\nresolution of our leaders in 2005 to urgently address \r\nthe issue of the storm clouds which were threatening \r\nthe vast majority of humankind, particularly in the \r\ndeveloping world. We see a continued challenging time \r\nahead for development, for peace and security, for \r\ndemocracy and social institutions and for \r\nmultilateralism. We see an environment in which the \r\ncredibility of the international system to deliver fairly \r\nand equitably is being increasingly questioned. \r\n These were the very issues and circumstances \r\nwhich world leaders sought to address at the beginning \r\nof the sixtieth session in 2005. Their Summit Outcome \r\nDocument contained a raft of resolutions, commitments \r\nand recommendations to deal with fundamental issues \r\nand constraints, and was intended to give political \r\nmomentum to achieving the commonly agreed \r\ndevelopment goals, including the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. The leaders, while recognizing \r\nthat development, peace and security and human rights \r\nare interlinked and mutually reinforcing, reaffirmed \r\nthat development is a central goal in and of itself. \r\n Jamaica remains deeply committed to the three \r\npillars of the United Nations, but considers \r\ndevelopment to be at the very core. For this reason, \r\nJamaica is concerned about the fact that we have not \r\ndiscerned any significant focus on implementation in \r\nthe area of development over the past year — a year \r\ndedicated to implementation. The implementation gap \r\nhas been greater in this area than in either of the other \r\ntwo areas. \r\n Increased, albeit still insufficient, attention is \r\nbeing accorded to those who live in extreme poverty — \r\nthose living on less than $1 per day. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral cited some startling statistics in his report on \r\nA/61/PV.21  \r\n \r\n06-53615 22 \r\n \r\nthe work of the Organization. I would like to refer to \r\ntwo examples: 10 million children die before their fifth \r\nbirthday, and women in developing countries are 45 \r\ntimes more likely to die during pregnancy than women \r\nin developed countries. That is irrefutable evidence \r\nthat the situation remains in absolute and comparative \r\nterms, deeply unsatisfactory and unsustainable in an \r\ninterdependent world. \r\n Jamaica and other developing countries \r\nconsistently argued in all the debates leading up to and \r\nduring the 2005 Summit that, in addition to the poorest \r\ncountries, the situation of vulnerable middle- and \r\nlower- middle-income countries, especially small \r\nisland and highly externally dependent economies, \r\nneeded to be addressed. A number of potentially very \r\nuseful provisions were incorporated into the Summit \r\nOutcome document to address their particular \r\ncircumstances. But, frankly, Jamaica has seen little \r\nresolve on the part of the international community to \r\nimplement those commitments. We have seen no work, \r\nfor example, to implement the commitment to support \r\nthe development efforts of middle-income developing \r\ncountries to help them meet, among other things, their \r\nfinancial, technical and technological requirements. \r\nNor have we seen any effort to develop a framework \r\nfor providing significant debt relief or restructuring for \r\nmiddle-income developing countries with \r\nunsustainable debt burdens that are not part of the \r\nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative, or to \r\ncomprehensively address the debt problems of those \r\ncountries. Thirdly, there has been no effort to \r\nimplement the development dimension of the Doha \r\nWork Programme, in particular the World Trade \r\nOrganization’s Work Programme on Small Economies. \r\n We recognize that there was a welcome increase \r\nin official development assistance from $69 million in \r\n2003 to $106 million in 2005. Much of the additional \r\nfunding was targeted to a small number of admittedly \r\nvery deserving countries — mainly for debt relief — \r\nand to peacekeeping. There was little new money for \r\ninvestment in development projects, even in the \r\npoorest countries. \r\n It has always been recognized that many of the \r\nresources for financing development must come from \r\ntrade. That was clearly stated in the Monterrey \r\nConsensus (A/CONF.198/11) and repeated in the 2005 \r\nSummit Outcome Document (resolution 60/1). In the \r\nOutcome Document, leaders of developed and \r\ndeveloping countries committed to work expeditiously \r\ntowards implementing the development dimensions of \r\nthe Doha Work Programme. They also emphasized the \r\nneed to address weak and volatile commodity prices \r\nand to support the efforts of commodity-dependent \r\ncountries to restructure, diversify and strengthen the \r\ncompetitiveness of their commodity sectors. \r\n Instead of expedition and facilitation, we have \r\nseen stalemate and breakdown in the Doha round of \r\nnegotiations. Perhaps even more significant is the fact \r\nthat, in the negotiations that did take place, the \r\ndevelopment dimension — especially as it relates to \r\nsmall and vulnerable economies such as that of \r\nJamaica — was conspicuously absent from the debate. \r\nThese issues must be addressed in any effort to restart \r\nthe negotiations. \r\n Jamaica strongly supports the view that \r\nfundamental to a viable and equitable trade regime is \r\nthe need to take account of the wide disparity in \r\nstructural characteristics and approaches to economic \r\npolicy among the many members of the World Trade \r\nOrganization, and the consequent need for flexibility. \r\nWe would add, for clarity, the need to include the \r\ndifferences in levels of development among economies \r\nand the asymmetries existing between developed and \r\ndeveloping countries. \r\n As a small country with a debt burden of more \r\nthan 125 per cent of its gross domestic product; a \r\ncountry whose exports have been falling in value and \r\nwhose markets are threatened by the current uncritical \r\napproach to globalization and trade liberalization; a \r\ncountry dependent on imported petroleum for more \r\nthan 90 per cent of its commercial energy and whose \r\nenergy bill was more than $1 billion in 2005; an island \r\nvulnerable to a range of natural hazards and still \r\nworking to recover from major hurricanes and droughts \r\nin 2004 and 2005; and a country whose skilled \r\nprofessionals — doctors, nurses, teachers and scientists \r\nin particular — are targeted by some major developed \r\ncountries, Jamaica understands the need for a \r\ncollaborative and facilitative international environment \r\nand for coherence in policies. Successful \r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals \r\ncannot be assured in the face of those challenges. \r\n Jamaica recognizes that there can be no sustained \r\ndevelopment, no poverty eradication and no lasting \r\npeace without the advancement, equality and \r\nempowerment of women. Women’s advancement is a \r\n A/61/PV.21\r\n \r\n23 06-53615 \r\n \r\npriority of our national policy, and we support all \r\ninternational initiatives to that end. \r\n We are encouraged by action aimed at \r\nimplementing some of the mandates agreed at the 2005 \r\nSummit. In the area of international peace and security, \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission has been established, \r\nwith an emphasis on addressing post-conflict \r\nsituations. Jamaica has the honour to be a founding \r\nmember of that body and will be actively involved in \r\nthe achievement of its objectives. With regard to \r\nhuman rights, the Human Rights Council has been \r\nestablished. In the field of humanitarian affairs, the \r\nCentral Emergency Response Fund has been \r\nestablished, and an agreement has been reached on the \r\nprotection of humanitarian personnel. We welcome the \r\nfinalization of the draft Comprehensive and Integral \r\nInternational Convention on Protection and Promotion \r\nof the Rights and Dignity of Persons with Disabilities \r\nand look forward to its formal adoption later this year. \r\nWe welcome also the 2006 Political Declaration on \r\nHIV/AIDS (resolution 60/262), adopted at the High-\r\nlevel Meeting on HIV/AIDS. We urge the full \r\nimplementation of those decisions to comprehensively \r\ntackle this scourge in the most seriously affected \r\ncountries and regions. For the Caribbean region, \r\nHIV/AIDS is a major human, social and economic \r\nchallenge. \r\n The recent High-level Dialogue on International \r\nMigration and Development, convened in keeping with \r\nthe mandate of the 2005 World Summit, and the \r\npublication of the United Nations Population Fund’s \r\n2006 State of World Population report have been very \r\ntimely. They highlighted, among other things, the \r\nmultidimensional nature of international migration, its \r\nimportance in the globalization process and the \r\npotential for further widening of the development gap \r\nbetween rich and poor countries. They raised a number \r\nof critical issues for the attention of the international \r\ncommunity.  \r\n Jamaica is particularly concerned about the \r\nselectivity in the policies of developed countries, their \r\ndeliberate targeting of critical skilled professionals of \r\ndeveloping countries, accompanied by the tightening of \r\ntheir general immigration laws against the unskilled \r\nand the young, and their systematic and wholesale \r\nrepatriation of those who run into difficulty with their \r\nlaws — especially hardened criminals, many of whom \r\nhave little or no connection, if they ever did, with the \r\nreceiving developing country. Those policies are \r\ninconsistent, counterproductive and, with all due \r\nrespect, frankly wrong. They demand the urgent \r\nattention of the international community. We look \r\nforward to these issues being studied and given the \r\nrequired attention at the follow-up meeting to be held \r\nin Belgium in March 2007. \r\n We note the continued emphasis on the \r\nstrengthening of the United Nations and the adoption \r\nof reform measures aimed at improving accountability \r\nand transparency and at enhancing the effectiveness \r\nand efficiency of the work of the Secretariat in \r\nimplementing the programmes mandated by Member \r\nStates. We stress that reform should ensure the \r\nstrengthening of the United Nations. That should be \r\nour motivation. We should never allow reform to erode \r\nthe fundamental institutional framework of the United \r\nNations or the right of each Member State to be fully \r\ninvolved in the Organization’s decision-making \r\nprocesses and to contribute to advancing its goals and \r\nideals. That right has been the fundamental strength of \r\nthe United Nations and what sets it apart from many \r\nother multilateral institutions. It is and should remain \r\nthe standard. \r\n Geopolitical realities have changed significantly \r\nsince the establishment of the United Nations. It is \r\ntherefore logical that the Security Council should be \r\nreflective of the contemporary international community \r\nas a whole, on the basis of equitable geographical \r\nrepresentation and greater representation of developing \r\ncountries. How can it be that less than 5 per cent of the \r\nmembership of the Organization continues to wield \r\ninordinate power over the rest of us? That is \r\nundemocratic and, ultimately, unsustainable. It is on \r\nthat basis that Jamaica supports expansion in both \r\ncategories of Council membership, with increased \r\nrepresentation for all regional groups. \r\n Jamaica underscores the vital importance of \r\ncoherence in policy action and advice among the \r\nUnited Nations and other international institutions, \r\nincluding the international financial institutions, as \r\nwell as regional organizations, in the effort to facilitate \r\nand encourage development, especially that of the \r\nsmall, vulnerable and otherwise disadvantaged \r\ncountries. \r\n Over the years, Jamaica has experienced more \r\nthan its fair share in terms of the adverse impact of \r\nincoherent international policies and advice. I will \r\nprovide just three examples. First, Jamaica has been \r\nA/61/PV.21  \r\n \r\n06-53615 24 \r\n \r\nforced to hold a large fund of international reserves in \r\ndeveloped countries. At the end of August 2006, \r\nJamaica’s net international reserves stood at \r\napproximately $2.2 billion, or 18 weeks of imported \r\ngoods and services, while the country needs foreign \r\nexchange to facilitate investment projects.  \r\n Secondly, Jamaica has entered into international \r\ncommitments under the Millennium Development \r\nGoals, inter alia to expand education and health care, \r\nto enhance environmental protection, to strengthen \r\nrural development and to improve housing and \r\nsanitation. These are all labour-intensive activities. The \r\nInternational Monetary Fund, without providing any \r\nanalysis, is giving advice and insisting that Jamaica \r\nreduce its public service drastically.  \r\n Thirdly, Jamaica is forced to compete with the \r\nsalaries being offered by developed countries such as \r\nCanada, the United Kingdom and the United States to \r\nlarge categories of employees, including teachers and \r\nnurses, while seeking to reduce its fiscal deficit. This is \r\none of the major difficulties that the Government is \r\nfacing in its current wage negotiations with the \r\nmembers of some of these categories, with a view to \r\ncompleting its second memorandum of understanding \r\nwith public sector workers. \r\n The United Nations has a major responsibility to \r\nlead in the quest for coherence in international \r\neconomic programmes and policies. Jamaica believes \r\nthat a fortified United Nations, in particular a \r\nstrengthened Economic and Social Council, is vital if \r\nthat role is to be effective. \r\n We continue to live in very turbulent times. \r\nGlobal peace, security and stability continue to be \r\nelusive. All the multilateral gains that we have made in \r\nrecent years will come to little if existing conflict \r\nsituations are not resolved and if new military \r\ninterventions, acts of terrorism and other debilitating \r\nthreats to peace, security and development arise. \r\n We must continue to emphasize the critical \r\nimportance of multilateral diplomacy, even-handedness \r\nand maximum restraint. We must reinforce the \r\nmutually beneficial relationships among us as a \r\ncommunity of nations. We must equip the United \r\nNations to act, and act decisively, when necessary. In \r\nthat regard, we welcome Security Council resolution \r\n1701 (2006) and look forward to every effort being \r\nmade to build on this new platform to secure a lasting \r\npeace in the Middle East. \r\n We cannot remain indifferent to the tragic plight \r\nof the people of Darfur, the Sudan. History has \r\nrepeatedly demonstrated that indifference emboldens \r\nthose who seek to act with impunity, resulting in even \r\ngreater atrocities and humanitarian crises. The \r\ninternational community must act urgently to promote \r\nhuman security and to protect the lives of innocent \r\ncivilians. \r\n Disarmament and non-proliferation go hand in \r\nhand. It is only through the total elimination of nuclear \r\nweapons and other weapons of mass destruction that \r\ninternational peace and security can be assured. \r\nJamaica is therefore disheartened that the international \r\ncommunity failed to seize the opportunities provided \r\nby the 2005 Review Conference of the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and by the \r\nWorld Summit to make significant progress on this \r\nissue. \r\n Jamaica and other countries in the Caribbean \r\nregion have to confront major security concerns as a \r\nresult of the ease of access to illicit small arms and \r\nammunition and the linkages to transnational organized \r\ncrime, including drug trafficking. Jamaica feels a deep \r\nsense of disappointment that the 2006 Conference to \r\nReview Progress Made in the Implementation of the \r\nProgramme of Action to Prevent, Combat and \r\nEradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light \r\nWeapons in All Its Aspects failed to conclude an \r\noutcome document which would have introduced \r\nimprovements in the implementation of the Programme \r\nof Action. Jamaica will continue to advocate for the \r\ncreation of a legally binding instrument which more \r\nstrictly controls the illegal trade in small arms and light \r\nweapons and ammunition. \r\n The recent adoption of the United Nations Global \r\nCounter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288) is a \r\nvery clear demonstration that the international \r\ncommunity can come together to confront major threats \r\nto civility, the rule of law and international peace and \r\nsecurity. This should be our modus operandi. \r\n We have been particularly encouraged by \r\ndevelopments in Haiti, which have led to the \r\ndemocratic election of the Government of President \r\nRené Préval. In July, Haiti was able to again take its \r\nrightful place in CARICOM. Coupled with the renewal \r\nof the mandate of the United Nations Stabilization \r\nMission in Haiti until February 2007, attention can \r\nnow be focused on institution- and capacity-building, \r\n A/61/PV.21\r\n \r\n25 06-53615 \r\n \r\nas well as on reconstruction and other initiatives for \r\neconomic and social development in that country. \r\n The bicentenary of the abolition of the trans-\r\nAtlantic slave trade in the British Empire will be \r\nmarked in 2007. For all CARICOM countries this is a \r\nspecial anniversary based on shared history. To \r\nsymbolize the occasion, CARICOM members will be \r\nintroducing a draft resolution at this session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly with the expectation that the \r\nAssembly will appropriately recognize the event. We \r\nlook forward to the support of all delegations. \r\n Jamaica strongly reaffirms its commitment to the \r\nUnited Nations and the multilateral process. Our \r\ncontinued commitment at all levels, including our \r\nsupport for the work of the International Seabed \r\nAuthority, remains firm. \r\n Before closing, I would like to take this \r\nopportunity to pay special tribute to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his outstanding leadership in guiding the \r\nwork of the Organization over the past 10 years. He \r\nhas faced the challenges of our times. He has re-\r\nengineered the position of Secretary-General to \r\nbecome the face, voice and conscience of the \r\ninternational community. He has brought civil society, \r\nnon-governmental organizations and the private sector \r\ninto the United Nations. He has leveraged and brought \r\ninto international service high achievers in a range of \r\ndisciplines. And he has increased opportunities for \r\nconsultation and dialogue. We wish him the very best. \r\n Jamaica looks forward to a transparent and \r\ninclusive process to provide our Organization with a \r\nnew Secretary-General who enjoys the confidence of \r\nthe full membership. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I call \r\non His Excellency Mr. Charles Savarin, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs, Trade, Labour and the Public Service \r\nof Dominica. \r\n Mr. Savarin (Dominica): I would like to extend \r\nmy congratulations to Her Excellency Ms. Haya \r\nRashed Al-Khalifa and to her country, Bahrain, on her \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-first session. I am confident that she will ably \r\nbuild upon the legacy left by her predecessor, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Jan Eliasson of Sweden. Mr. Eliasson \r\ndeserves special recognition for the competent and \r\ndedicated manner in which he presided over the \r\nsixtieth session and facilitated the positive outcomes \r\nthat we have witnessed so far in the United Nations \r\nreform agenda. \r\n Let me also pay tribute to His Excellency \r\nMr. Kofi Annan for his distinguished career as an \r\ninternational civil servant, specifically his 10-year stint \r\nas Secretary-General. His wisdom and his unwavering \r\ncommitment to multilateralism have contributed \r\nimmensely to a revitalized United Nations. He will \r\nmost certainly be remembered for his steadfast \r\npromotion of human rights, for creating space at the \r\nUnited Nations for civil society and the private sector \r\nand for his visionary outlook for the future of the \r\nUnited Nations in the current global dispensation. We \r\nwish to thank him for his invaluable service to this \r\nOrganization and its Member States, and to extend our \r\nvery best wishes to him in his future endeavours. \r\n The World Summit last year started us on the path \r\nof re-engineering the United Nations to make it more \r\nrelevant and responsive to the many challenges that \r\nthreaten peace and security in the world at the \r\nbeginning of this century. The Summit Outcome clearly \r\nreflected a historic compromise by Member States on a \r\nnumber of core principles and attendant actions to face \r\nsquarely the myriad problems confronting the planet. \r\nMost importantly, we reaffirmed the commitment we \r\nmade at the beginning of the millennium to confront \r\nthe scourge of poverty and to improve the living \r\nconditions of millions of people living in abject \r\npoverty. Our challenge today is to clarify how the \r\ninternational community can more effectively \r\ncontribute towards the global goals of poverty \r\nalleviation, peace and development for all humanity. \r\n The dynamics of today’s world, conditioned by \r\nimmense forces of change, have forced us to accept the \r\nstark reality that no nation can prosper alone and that \r\nthe problems we face demand global consensus. \r\nConsequently, all of us must emphatically reaffirm \r\ncentral role of the United Nations in the cooperative \r\nmanagement of the world’s problems. Dominica firmly \r\nsupports a rejuvenated United Nations and universal \r\napplication of its ideals, in particular the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security, the protection of \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms and the \r\npromotion of international cooperation in solving \r\neconomic, social, cultural and humanitarian problems. \r\n We welcome progress towards realizing some of \r\nthe commitments made by world leaders last year. \r\nCreation of the Peacebuilding Commission now \r\nA/61/PV.21  \r\n \r\n06-53615 26 \r\n \r\npresents a great opportunity for ensuring a tangible \r\nconnection between conflict resolution and \r\ndevelopment. It is our hope that the new Human Rights \r\nCouncil will remain focused on its mission and avoid \r\nbecoming entangled in the politicization that \r\ncontributed to the eventual demise of its predecessor. \r\nThe Human Rights Council has made a commendable \r\nstart with the adoption of the Declaration on the Rights \r\nof Indigenous Peoples, which in turn gives great \r\nimpetus to the aspirations of the Second United \r\nNations Decade of the World’s Indigenous People, \r\nwhich the Commonwealth of Dominica has steadfastly \r\nsupported, as one of the few Caribbean countries with \r\na thriving indigenous Carib population. We, therefore, \r\ncall on the General Assembly to give full support to the \r\nadoption of this declaration by consensus. \r\n The Commonwealth of Dominica, located as we \r\nare in the hurricane belt, in an earthquake zone and in a \r\nvolcanic region, particularly welcomes the \r\nestablishment of the Central Emergency Response \r\nFund, which we believe will significantly enhance the \r\ncapacity of the United Nations to respond more \r\neffectively to the increasing frequency of natural \r\ndisasters brought about by climate change and global \r\nwarming. We, the Member States, now have an \r\nobligation to contribute to the building of the Fund, \r\nwhile at the same time taking steps to put in place \r\nmeasures to combat climate change and reduce our \r\nemission of greenhouse gases. Member States must be \r\ncommended for the movement in a few important areas \r\nthat will contribute to a revitalized United Nations. The \r\nfirst relates to progress in the area of Secretariat and \r\nmanagement reforms, which we hope will contribute to \r\ngreater transparency and accountability in United \r\nNations operations. The second is the finalization on \r\n26 August 2006 of the new treaty protecting the rights \r\nof persons with disabilities, and I am pleased to \r\nannounce that my Government is committed to signing \r\nand ratifying that treaty. We believe that that \r\nconvention provides a solid basis for breaking down \r\nthe discrimination directed towards people with \r\ndisabilities. \r\n The next area is the adoption by the General \r\nAssembly on 8 September 2006 of a United Nations \r\nGlobal Counter-Terrorism Strategy. Through this \r\naction, we have in a small way honoured the numerous \r\nvictims of international terrorism and demonstrated our \r\nresolve to combat the scourge of terrorism wherever it \r\nexists. We must continue to work towards a counter-\r\nterrorism convention. \r\n My country is continuing to make progress \r\ntowards realization of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals, despite the many challenges with which it is \r\nconfronted. In the aftermath of the devastation wreaked \r\nupon our economy by the rulings of the World Trade \r\nOrganization disputes settlement mechanism, which \r\nresulted in the virtual dismantling of our banana \r\nindustry, we had to undergo stringent fiscal \r\nadjustments to deal with unsustainable debt. The great \r\nsacrifices of the Dominican people resulted in modest \r\neconomic growth and helped to consolidate our \r\neconomic recovery. Spiralling oil prices, however, are \r\nseriously threatening the modest gains we have made. \r\nNational effort is, therefore, focused on developing \r\nalternative, renewable energy sources, such as hydro, \r\nwind and geothermal. \r\n Recent global events have not been encouraging. \r\nThe collapse of the Doha Development Round further \r\nthreatens to marginalize small island developing States \r\nlike Dominica in the global trading system. Trade is \r\none central element in the international agenda that can \r\nfoster sustainable economic growth, reduce our \r\ndependence on declining aid and contribute to \r\nrealization of the Millennium Development Goals and \r\nthe development aspirations of the small vulnerable \r\neconomies. \r\n The global trading system must recognize, \r\nhowever, that there is no such thing as a level playing \r\nfield, even among developing countries, as there are \r\nvarying levels of size, vulnerability and development. \r\nThere are large developing countries, there are small \r\ndeveloping countries and there are very small \r\ndeveloping countries. In addition, there are the least \r\ndeveloped countries, which may be large or small. \r\nWhere the very small developing countries are islands, \r\ntheir vulnerability is multiplied several fold. In \r\naddition to market access, therefore, small island \r\ndeveloping States require increased development \r\nfinance for trade and productive capacity enhancement \r\ncombined with trade rules that are responsive to their \r\ndevelopment aspirations. In this regard, small \r\nvulnerable economies and the least developed countries \r\nurgently need a trading system that acknowledges their \r\nvulnerability and grants them the necessary special and \r\ndifferential treatment. This will ensure that they benefit \r\nfrom their participation in the global system and lead \r\nto greater equity and fairness in the process. \r\n A/61/PV.21\r\n \r\n27 06-53615 \r\n \r\n Increasingly, South-South cooperation has \r\nbecome vitally important to countries like the \r\nCommonwealth of Dominica, as the developed nations \r\nretreat from fulfilling their commitment to contribute \r\n0.7 per cent of their GNI for development assistance. \r\nSouth-South cooperation from China, Cuba, Libya, \r\nNigeria, Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela is \r\ncontributing positively to our human resource \r\ndevelopment, revitalization of our infrastructure and \r\nimplementation of our public sector investment \r\nprogramme. We believe that the developed countries \r\ncan make a greater effort to assist us in realizing the \r\ncommitments made under the Barbados Programme of \r\nAction and the 2005 Mauritius Strategy for the Further \r\nImplementation of the Programme of Action for the \r\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing \r\nStates. We in the Caribbean Community and Common \r\nMarket (CARICOM) understand the critical \r\nimportance of deepening regional integration and that \r\nis why we agreed this year to move towards the \r\nCARICOM Single Market and Economy. That \r\ndevelopment, we believe, is an important pillar in \r\nmaximizing regional trade and development and in \r\nminimizing the negative impact that is likely to be \r\ninflicted upon us, as small vulnerable economies, from \r\nthe forces of globalization. We look forward to the \r\nsupport of the donor community in this important \r\nendeavour. \r\n Good neighbourliness is an important plank in \r\nour foreign policy, and through this approach we seek \r\nto continuously build and strengthen relations with all \r\nthe countries of the greater Caribbean Basin, including \r\nCuba, the United States of America and Venezuela. We \r\nbelieve in harmonious and friendly relations with all \r\nour neighbours. We should not be expected to choose \r\none over the other, but should be seen more as a bridge \r\nacross the Caribbean Basin. Maritime and border \r\ndisputes within our region, and particularly between \r\nCARICOM Member States and our neighbours in \r\nCentral and South America, are best resolved in an \r\natmosphere of friendship and cooperation, using the \r\ngood offices of the United Nations, the Organization of \r\nAmerican States and other forums that can bring about \r\nresolution to such disputes. \r\n The year 2007 will mark the bicentennial of the \r\nabolition of the transatlantic slave trade in the former \r\nBritish Empire. We anticipate a commemorative event \r\nin the General Assembly to mark this historic occasion. \r\nThe Caribbean Community and Common Market \r\n(CARICOM) Group of nations will table a resolution \r\nin the General Assembly to mark the occasion and \r\nexpects the support of all Member States of the United \r\nNations in this regard. \r\n We welcome the return to constitutional \r\ngovernment in Haiti, the first country to declare its \r\nindependence from colonialism and slavery. We \r\ncommit ourselves to work closely with President René \r\nGarcia Préval and his Government in their \r\ndevelopment efforts. We also welcome the recent \r\nannouncement of commitments to Haiti by the \r\nGovernment of the United States of $492 million over \r\nthree years, and by the Government of Canada in the \r\namount of $100 million annually. We appreciate greatly \r\nthe many pledges of assistance for Haiti’s \r\nreconstruction from various bilateral and multilateral \r\ndonors and wish to emphasize the necessity for these \r\npledges to be disbursed on a timely basis to provide the \r\nHaitian Government with the capacity to bring about \r\nimprovements in the physical and social infrastructure \r\nof the country and the quality of life of the people of \r\nthis CARICOM member State. \r\n The situation in Iraq, Afghanistan, Lebanon, \r\nDarfur, and the Middle East continue to occupy our \r\nattention. Regarding the unfortunate devastation \r\ncaused by the war between Israel and Hizbollah, we \r\nbelieve that Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) is \r\na good basis for a future peaceful relationship between \r\nIsrael and Lebanon, and we urge both countries and the \r\nneighbouring States to abide by the provisions of that \r\nresolution. The Commonwealth of Dominica has stated \r\nbefore in this forum that the only solution to the \r\nPalestinian-Israeli conflict is the establishment of a \r\nsovereign and independent Palestinian State alongside \r\nthe State of Israel, both with secure and defensible \r\nborders recognized by the international community. \r\n The situation in Darfur is very troubling and the \r\ninternational community must take action now. We \r\ncommend the African Union for renewing the mandate \r\nof the African Union Peacekeeping Force, and urge the \r\nSudanese Government to reconsider its opposition to \r\nthe deployment of a United Nations peacekeeping force \r\nto bolster the efforts of the African Union to provide \r\nprotection and security for the people of Darfur, which \r\nis a prerequisite for a lasting solution to the underlying \r\nproblems giving rise to the state of conflict. \r\n In conclusion, let me express my delegation’s \r\nwish for a successful sixty-first session under \r\nA/61/PV.21  \r\n \r\n06-53615 28 \r\n \r\nMs. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa’s leadership. It is our \r\nhope that the development agenda will once again \r\nassume the highest priority of the General Assembly \r\nand that we can more effectively promote peace and \r\nsecurity, eradicate terrorism, and above all promote \r\npoverty alleviation. We must also focus on moving \r\nforward with the reform agenda of the United Nations \r\nsystem, including Security Council and Economic and \r\nSocial Council reform. We can prevail if we act \r\nresponsibly and together. Support for multilateralism \r\nand the ideals of the United Nations must remain our \r\npriority. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Ismael Mohamoud \r\nHurreh, Minister for Foreign Affairs and International \r\nCooperation of the Somali Republic. \r\n Mr. Hurreh (Somalia): It gives me great pleasure \r\nto know that a sister from fraternal Bahrain is presiding \r\nover this important session of the General Assembly. \r\nMs. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa’s leadership will certainly \r\ncontribute to promoting dialogue and harmony in the \r\nmidst of the spread of conflicts throughout the different \r\ncorners of the world. We are confident that she will \r\nsuccessfully guide the deliberations of the Assembly. \r\n Let me also take this opportunity to pay special \r\ntribute to her predecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, for his \r\ncommitment and diplomatic skill, which enabled him \r\nto effectively manage the deliberations of the \r\nAssembly. We likewise wish to recognize Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan for the immense efforts \r\nundertaken and the commendable services rendered \r\nduring his tenure in promoting the maintenance of \r\npeace and security and international cooperation. \r\n I wish at the outset to brief this Assembly in some \r\ndetail on the current situation in Somalia. The \r\nestablishment of the Transitional Federal Government \r\nof Somalia was the result of the successful peace and \r\nreconciliation process held in Nairobi, Kenya in 2004, \r\nand created a unique opportunity for ending the Somali \r\npolitical crisis. The Somali people were overjoyed that \r\na comprehensive settlement of the conflict had finally \r\nbeen reached. \r\n The advancement and consolidation of peace and \r\nstability requires the unwavering commitment of the \r\ninternational community to reinforce the Transitional \r\nFederal Government’s national efforts in nation-\r\nbuilding. Regrettably, owing to circumstances not fully \r\nunderstood by us, the international community failed to \r\nact in a timely fashion to support the new Government \r\nin facing the enormous challenges it confronted. \r\nConsequently, a window of opportunity has been lost, \r\nwhich has led to continued violence and conflict. \r\n Ironically, the international community’s failure \r\nto act also paved the way for the warlords and other \r\narmed groups to take advantage of a political vacuum, \r\nas they asserted and consolidated their power and clan-\r\nbased authority in the capital city, Mogadishu, and its \r\nenvirons. \r\n Although they had the privilege of holding \r\nimportant ministerial portfolios in the new \r\nGovernment, the warlords pursued their hidden agenda \r\nto promote their personal interests and political \r\nambitions by maintaining the chaotic status quo in \r\nSomalia. \r\n It is noteworthy to bear in mind that the warlords \r\nand the Islamic Courts Union (ICU) had initially \r\ncombined their forces and political rhetoric as an \r\nopposition alliance group against the Transitional \r\nFederal Government. Both groups were encouraged by \r\nthe reluctance of the international community to come \r\nquickly to the aid of the new Somali Government and \r\nby the continuation of the United Nations arms \r\nembargo against Somalia. However, the ICU soon \r\nrealized that the warlords were losing popularity \r\namong mainstream Somalis. \r\n At this juncture, the Transitional Federal \r\nGovernment, though sceptical, responded positively to \r\nthe initiative undertaken by the League of Arab States \r\nto convene peace talks and settle the differences \r\nbetween the parties. The first and second rounds of \r\nthose peace talks have successfully taken place in \r\nKhartoum, and both sides have agreed on general \r\nprinciples and some preliminary issues for the next \r\nround of talks scheduled to be held in Khartoum in \r\nOctober 2006.  \r\n However, as the Islamic Courts Union continued \r\nto rush to consolidate their grip, their concealed \r\nintentions are fast becoming evident to the Somali \r\npeople and to the international community. In this \r\nconnection, it will be recalled that the ICU continued \r\nwith impunity to expand and attack other districts \r\noutside Mogadishu including Jowhar, Balad, and other \r\nadjacent areas. The latest development of the ICU’s \r\nterritorial expansion was the ill-advised armed attack \r\nand seizure of the city of Kismayo, in flagrant violation \r\nof the Khartoum Peace Agreement. \r\n A/61/PV.21\r\n \r\n29 06-53615 \r\n \r\n It should also be noted that the President of the \r\nTransitional Federal Government of Somalia, Mr. \r\nAbdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, survived a targeted \r\nassassination attempt on 18 September 2006. My \r\nGovernment firmly believes that this heinous crime is \r\nan act of terrorism aimed at undermining and \r\nsabotaging the peace process in Somalia and should be \r\ncondemned in the strongest terms. This heinous attack \r\nresulted in the death of several people, including the \r\nbrother of the President. We wish to express our \r\nappreciation to all those delegations and organizations \r\nthat expressed their sympathy and condemned this act.  \r\n These developments are all disquieting and \r\ndisturbing, and the situation is deteriorating to an \r\nalarming degree and at a rapid pace. It continues to \r\npose a serious threat to the peace that has been \r\nachieved, which has serious implications for the \r\nsecurity and stability of the region.  \r\n Despite all these violations of the Peace \r\nAgreement, the Transitional Federal Government \r\nremains committed to the path of dialogue and \r\nnegotiation with the ICU and relevant civil society \r\norganizations. But this positive attitude will not \r\ncontinue if the ICU persists in its aggressive policies of \r\nattacks and territorial expansion. \r\n As I stated earlier, the absence of law and order, \r\nthe escalation of violence and the ensuing collapse of \r\ncentral authority were the major causes for the chaos \r\nand anarchy in Somalia. The main goal of the \r\nTransitional Federal Government is therefore to engage \r\nin an effective, focused plan for the re-establishment of \r\ninstitutions for peace and good governance in order to \r\nrestore normalcy and stability in the country. We \r\ntherefore strongly appeal to the international \r\ncommunity to demonstrate a political will and a \r\ncommitment to redouble its efforts to provide political, \r\nfinancial and technical support to the Transitional \r\nFederal Government during this challenging \r\ntransitional period. \r\n It goes without saying that the absence of \r\neffective, functioning government institutions capable \r\nof enforcing law and order has been the underlying \r\ncause of the Somali conflict for the past 14 years. At \r\nthis crucial juncture, what Somalia urgently needs is \r\nimmediate and substantial support for the creation of \r\nan environment conducive to peace and security which \r\nin essence is the key requirement for reconstruction \r\nand economic recovery. \r\n The economic challenges facing the Transitional \r\nFederal Government of Somalia are formidable. The \r\ncollapse of the Somali State in 1991 resulted in \r\nextensive destruction of governing and management \r\ninstitutions which are now being re-established by the \r\nTransitional Federal Government in its post-conflict \r\nreconstruction programmes. \r\n It is deeply disturbing to note that over half a \r\nmillion children under the age of five die each year \r\nfrom preventable diseases, malaria being the biggest \r\nkiller. Moreover, over 100,000 women die each year \r\nfrom complications in pregnancy and childbirth. \r\nDespite all these hardships, the Transitional Federal \r\nGovernment’s economic and social recovery \r\nprogrammes have received virtually no assistance from \r\ninternational donors and certainly none commensurate \r\nwith the massive needs of the Somali people. For far \r\ntoo long, Somalia was allowed to struggle alone and \r\nthe negative consequences have been monumental.  \r\n Somalia can aspire to establish the sufficient \r\nconditions for sustained economic growth by \r\nleveraging its energetic human and social capital. \r\nHowever, a successful and sustainable reconstruction \r\nand development programme requires the international \r\ncommunity’s support of the Transitional Federal \r\nGovernment’s determined efforts to wield \r\nadministrative authority and develop competence at the \r\nfederal, regional and district levels. This situation calls \r\nfor a broad-based participatory partnership approach \r\nfrom the family of nations and for the provision of \r\ntechnical assistance in the building of efficient \r\ninstitutions that leverage the resiliency and potential of \r\nthe Somali people. \r\n In terms of required relief assistance, it is to be \r\nnoted that approximately 1.8 million Somalis are still \r\nin need of urgent humanitarian assistance and \r\nlivelihood support. In view of the magnitude of this \r\nchallenge, my delegation appeals to the world body \r\nand the donor community to respond positively, \r\ngenerously and, above all, concertedly in order to meet \r\nSomalia’s humanitarian needs and avert a catastrophe \r\nof major proportions. \r\n In an effort to stabilize Somalia and overcome the \r\nsources of insecurity, the Government has put in place \r\na well-marshalled National Security and Stabilization \r\nPlan. Both in concept and execution, the plan takes a \r\nholistic approach to the nature and scope of insecurity \r\nin the country. For its implementation, the plan takes \r\nA/61/PV.21  \r\n \r\n06-53615 30 \r\n \r\ninto consideration local, regional and international \r\ndimensions. Accordingly, it envisions the combined \r\nand concerted local, regional and international efforts \r\nin its execution. However, the realization of this plan \r\nremains elusive insofar as the Government is fragile \r\nand incapable of enforcing the policies and laws of the \r\nland pursuant to the Transitional Federal Charter. \r\n The Transitional Federal Government welcomes \r\nall efforts now being undertaken by the international \r\ncommunity in addressing the new problems and \r\nrealities of Somalia. It is important to note that the \r\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) \r\nand the African Union have now finalized the details \r\nand salient elements of the IGAD Peace Support \r\nMission in Somalia. At the international level, it is also \r\ngratifying that the International Contact Group on \r\nSomalia, which was recently established, convened its \r\nsecond meeting in Brussels to find ways and means to \r\nstreamline the international engagement and support \r\nfor Somalia. Moreover, on its part, the United Nations \r\nSecurity Council is in the process of considering \r\nSomalia’s security problems, in particular the lifting of \r\nthe United Nations arms embargo and the deployment \r\nof IGASOM to Somalia. \r\n All these combined activities at the regional and \r\ninternational levels demonstrate the heightened interest \r\nand attention given to Somalia. However, it remains to \r\nbe seen whether all these initiatives can be properly \r\ncoordinated and directed towards substantially \r\nassisting the Transitional Federal Government in its \r\ndaunting task of stabilizing the country. To be \r\nmeaningful and effective, the contributions of the \r\ninternational community must focus, as a matter of \r\npriority, on the fundamental issue of capacity-building \r\nfor the Transitional Federal Government institutions, \r\nparticularly in the security sector.  \r\n It is imperative that the following specific \r\nmeasures be taken as a matter of urgency: \r\n First, the United Nations arms embargo must be \r\nfavourably reviewed and lifted by the Security \r\nCouncil. Secondly, the IGAD Peace Support Mission \r\nshould be deployed as mandated by the African Union \r\nand IGAD. Thirdly, the National Security Forces must \r\nbe institutionalized, trained and equipped. Fourthly, the \r\nDemobilization, Disarmament and Reintegration \r\nProgramme must be undertaken throughout Somalia. \r\n It is also of paramount importance that a solid \r\nbasis for the Somali public administration be \r\nestablished and that a modest and lean civil service be \r\nrecruited and trained for the various public sector \r\norgans of the State. Regional administrations should be \r\nput in place and federal restructuring drawn and \r\nimplemented in conformity with the Transitional \r\nFederal Charter. Finally, immediate efforts should be \r\nexerted for the drafting of the permanent federal \r\nconstitution of Somalia so as to pave the way for free \r\nand fair elections after the completion of the \r\ntransitional period. \r\n These proposals are aimed at restoring peace and \r\nstability in order to assist the Transitional Federal \r\nGovernment in establishing functioning and effective \r\ninstitutions capable of providing essential basic \r\nservices to the people. Failure to do so would once \r\nagain relegate Somalia to yet another cycle of violence \r\nand anarchy. \r\n We share the desire expressed by many \r\ndelegations in this forum to see the United Nations \r\nreinvigorate its role and strengthen its capabilities with \r\na view to becoming more active and effective. It could \r\nthen guarantee the fulfilment of the objectives and \r\nprinciples that are enshrined in the Charter, so as to \r\nensure that peace on earth and international \r\ncooperation will continue to prevail for the welfare of \r\nmankind. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Kenzo Oshima, \r\nchairman of the delegation of Japan. \r\n Mr. Oshima (Japan): I wish to congratulate Her \r\nExcellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa on her \r\nassumption of the presidency of the sixty-first session \r\nof the General Assembly, and I wish her every success. \r\nI would also like to pay high tribute to the past \r\nPresident, His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson, for his \r\noutstanding leadership during the last session. Japan’s \r\nsincere thanks also go to Secretary-General Kofi \r\nAnnan for his dedication and many achievements in \r\nleading the work of the Organization over the past \r\ndecade. \r\n Japan congratulates the Republic of Montenegro \r\non its accession to the United Nations as its 192nd \r\nMember. \r\n Fifty years ago, in December 1956, from this very \r\npodium, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan, \r\nMamoru Shigemitsu, expressed the nation’s great \r\nhonour and delight at becoming the eightieth Member \r\n A/61/PV.21\r\n \r\n31 06-53615 \r\n \r\nof the United Nations and declared Japan’s firm \r\ndetermination to contribute to the high goals of this \r\nOrganization. \r\n Since then, Japan, as a nation committed to \r\npeace, has worked hard in promoting disarmament and \r\nthe non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, \r\nsupporting the undertakings of the United Nations for \r\npeace and stability in the world such as the \r\npeacekeeping operations, and contributing to world \r\ndevelopment and prosperity. The Japanese people take \r\npride in the contributions they have made over the \r\nyears to the United Nations. \r\n The challenges we face today differ significantly \r\nfrom those of 50 years ago. Yet, the common goals of \r\nhumanity that the United Nations has strived for — \r\npeace, development and human rights — remain \r\nunchanged. Japan reaffirms the commitment it made at \r\nthe time of its accession, and, building on its \r\nexperiences since then, will rededicate its efforts to \r\nachieve those goals. \r\n As Member States, we are responsible, not only \r\nfor the actions we take, but also for our inaction. \r\nWithin the United Nations, it is the Security Council \r\nthat bears the responsibility of delivering swift and \r\ndecisive action in the face of a crisis. This summer, the \r\nability of the international community to mount a \r\ncollective response through the Security Council was \r\ntested on several occasions. Let me cite three major \r\nevents on which the Council acted: the ballistic missile \r\nlaunches by the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea, Iran’s nuclear-related problem and the conflict \r\nin Lebanon. \r\n After the launch of ballistic missiles by the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea on 4 July, the \r\nSecurity Council, in a unanimous decision in resolution \r\n1695 (2006), sent a firm message, on behalf of the \r\nentire international community, condemning that \r\nreprehensible act. In accordance with that resolution, \r\nall Member States are now required to take concrete \r\naction as specified therein, and call strongly on the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea to implement \r\nthe resolution, fully and without delay. In that \r\nconnection, Japan introduced on 19 September a set of \r\nmeasures for the prevention of the transfer of financial \r\nresources to the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea, in addition to the long-standing strict export \r\ncontrol measures. \r\n Furthermore, Japan will continue to make its \r\nutmost efforts so that the nuclear issue of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, and the \r\nabduction issue will be resolved comprehensively and \r\nin accordance with the Pyongyang Declaration of 2002. \r\n With regard to Iran’s nuclear issue, it is our belief \r\nthat the adoption of resolution 1696 (2006) will serve \r\nas an important step towards a peaceful settlement of \r\nthe issue through diplomatic negotiations. Japan \r\nstrongly urges Iran to comply fully with the resolution \r\nby promptly suspending all enrichment-related \r\nactivities, and to return to the negotiation process. \r\n Concerning the recent crisis in Lebanon, Japan \r\nwelcomes the adoption of resolution 1701 (2006) by \r\nthe Security Council and supports the efforts under \r\nway for its implementation. At the same time, the \r\nprotracted negotiating process for that resolution \r\nreminded us once again of the importance of the ability \r\nof the Council to respond, swiftly as well as \r\ncomprehensively, in such a crisis situation. That is \r\nnever an easy task, but one we must always strive to \r\nfulfil. \r\n In response to some of the recent events affecting \r\ninternational peace and security, the Council succeeded \r\nin arriving at concrete decisions for the Member States \r\nto act upon. Japan is pleased to have played a proactive \r\nrole in that process as a member of the Council, and we \r\nintend to cooperate closely with other Member States \r\nin following up on those resolutions. \r\n In countries and regions emerging from conflict, \r\nthe key to realizing sustainable peace and prosperity \r\nlies in the consolidation of peace and laying the \r\nfoundations for nation-building. It is encouraging to \r\nsee the ongoing, concerted efforts of the international \r\ncommunity towards peace consolidation and nation-\r\nbuilding in a number of countries and regions. \r\n Iraq is one such country. Though currently still in \r\nthe grip of great hardship, we have every confidence \r\nthat Iraq will overcome the difficulties and develop as \r\na democratic and stable State, and prosper as a \r\nresponsible member of the international community. \r\nThe International Compact for Iraq, which aims at \r\nforging a new mode of partnership between Iraq and \r\nthe international community, will help accelerate the \r\ncountry’s reconstruction. Japan intends to fully take \r\npart in those international endeavours. \r\nA/61/PV.21  \r\n \r\n06-53615 32 \r\n \r\n In Afghanistan, Japan has also been an active \r\nsupporter and a leading donor for its reconstruction and \r\ndevelopment. We have led the disarmament, \r\ndemobilization and reintegration (DDR) efforts in \r\ncollaboration with the United Nations, and, upon the \r\nsuccessful completion of the DDR process, are now \r\ntaking the lead in the projects for the disbanding of \r\nillegal armed groups. \r\n With regard to Timor-Leste, Japan hopes that the \r\nnewly established United Nations mission will \r\neffectively support the country’s nation-building \r\nefforts. As the lead country on Timor-Leste in the \r\nSecurity Council, Japan will continue to take the \r\ninitiative to promote peace and stability and achieve \r\nthe early restoration of law and order in that country. \r\n In Africa, as a whole, we begin to see the \r\nsituation on the continent moving towards less conflict \r\nand greater peace. The ministerial conference on the \r\nconsolidation of peace, that was held under the \r\nframework of the Tokyo International Conference on \r\nAfrican Development (TICAD) in February this year, \r\nnot only made an intellectual contribution to the \r\nunderstanding of peace consolidation, but also \r\nstrengthened the will and solidarity of the African \r\nStates for peacebuilding. Japan, for its part, has been \r\nexpanding assistance for the consolidation of peace in \r\nAfrica, with particular focus on the Sudan, the Great \r\nLakes region and West Africa.  \r\n Against such a backdrop, the establishment of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission represents a significant \r\nmilestone in the history of the United Nations. We \r\nmust ensure that the Commission’s work is translated \r\ninto tangible, practical value-added support to \r\npeacebuilding efforts in countries recovering from \r\nconflict and that it thus helps to make a difference on \r\nthe ground. Burundi and Sierra Leone, the first two \r\ncountries on the agenda of the Commission, will \r\nprovide test cases, in which we must not fail. Japan has \r\ncontributed $20 million to the Peacebuilding Fund and \r\nintends to contribute actively to the work of the \r\nCommission. \r\n Post-conflict peacebuilding requires knowledge \r\nand expertise in a wide range of fields, including \r\nceasefire monitoring, refugee assistance, administrative \r\nand judicial institution-building, and reconstruction \r\nand development. Our experts have been working in \r\nAsian countries to assist their peacebuilding efforts, \r\nsuch as the establishment of legal and judicial systems. \r\nIn order to strengthen our cooperation in this area even \r\nfurther, we are now considering concrete measures to \r\ntrain civilians not only from Japan but also from other \r\nAsian countries. We envisage that, one day, civilian \r\npractitioners who have been trained in my country will \r\nfind themselves working side by side as fellow Asian \r\npeacebuilders, including, for example, in Africa. \r\n Regional conflicts continue to pose serious \r\nchallenges. In addition, the Secretary-General, as he \r\npointed out earlier from this rostrum, is concerned \r\nabout “those who seem eager to foment a new war of \r\nreligion” (A/61/PV.10). While poverty remains the \r\nmain scourge in many developing countries, \r\nglobalization has also brought to the fore transnational \r\nissues such as terrorism, infectious diseases and \r\nenvironmental degradation. It is clear that the \r\ninternational community still has a long way to go to \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\nIn tackling these issues, a spirit of tolerance, \r\ncompassion and closer international cooperation is \r\nindispensable, and a strengthened United Nations must \r\nbe at the centre of the concerted efforts of the \r\ninternational community. At the same time, new \r\nconcepts should also propel these efforts. Japan has \r\nadvocated the importance of human security as a \r\nconcept that stresses the protection of individuals from \r\nthreats to their life and dignity, as well as the value of \r\ntheir individual empowerment. Together with other \r\ninterested countries, we will promote human security \r\nand the approach based on it during this General \r\nAssembly session. \r\n Along with human security, respect for the \r\nownership of developing countries, based on good \r\ngovernance, should be a pillar underpinning the \r\nstrategy for reducing poverty through economic \r\ngrowth. Given these principles, Japan intends to \r\nenhance its development assistance to achieve the \r\nMDGs, by faithfully implementing the commitments \r\nmade last year to increase the volume of its official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) by $10 billion over a \r\nperiod of five years and to double its ODA to Africa \r\nover a period of three years. On trade, Japan will do its \r\nutmost to bring about the early resumption and \r\nsuccessful conclusion of the WTO Doha Development \r\nRound negotiations. \r\n Close international cooperation is vital in our \r\nfight against terrorism. In this regard, Japan welcomes \r\nthe adoption by the General Assembly of the United \r\nNations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution \r\n A/61/PV.21\r\n \r\n33 06-53615 \r\n \r\n60/288) and calls for the early conclusion of \r\nnegotiations on a comprehensive convention on \r\ninternational terrorism.  \r\n Health is another area in which Japan has worked \r\nextensively in cooperation with the international \r\ncommunity, including efforts against avian and \r\npandemic influenza and HIV/AIDS. Japan recognizes \r\nthe importance of the activities of the World Health \r\nOrganization and will further strengthen its \r\ncooperation with that organization, particularly in \r\nAfrica. \r\n As is often emphasized, peace, development and \r\nhuman rights are linked and complement one another. \r\nJapan’s own experience in the 60 years since the \r\nSecond World War is eloquent testimony to this fact. \r\nWe have high expectations for the newly created \r\nHuman Rights Council and look to it to open a new \r\npage in the promotion of respect for human rights. As a \r\nmember, Japan will play a constructive role in the \r\nCouncil. Japan also supports the early adoption of the \r\ndraft conventions on enforced disappearance and on \r\nthe rights and dignity of persons with disabilities. \r\n The United Nations has heavy responsibilities, in \r\ntoday’s and tomorrow’s world, as an indispensable \r\nglobal instrument for resolving conflicts, building \r\npeace, addressing emerging global threats and laying \r\nthe foundation for prosperity. To fulfil such a mission, \r\nit must be efficient and effective, as well as \r\naccountable and broadly representative in its decisions \r\nand operations. Reform of the Organization’s structure \r\nand the manner in which it functions is, therefore, \r\ncritically important. In September last year, leaders \r\nexpressed their resolve to achieve comprehensive \r\nreform of this universal body. One year on, some \r\nencouraging progress has been made, including the \r\nestablishment of the Peacebuilding Commission and \r\nthe Human Rights Council. However, reform of the \r\nSecurity Council remains outstanding on the \r\ninstitutional reform agenda. \r\n Perhaps a limited few may find it in their interest \r\nto leave the Security Council configured in the way it \r\nwas in 1945. It is clear, however, that no one stands to \r\ngain from the waning credibility that failure to reform \r\ncould entail. The call for a more effective, \r\nrepresentative and transparent Council that can meet \r\nthe demands of the new century is not mere rhetoric; it \r\nis real and urgent. An overwhelming majority of the \r\nMember States, including Japan, agree that the \r\ninternational community should approach and carry out \r\nreform with a sense of urgency, and Japan is \r\ndetermined to continue to take the initiative in this \r\ncritical endeavour. The Member States now need a new \r\nproposal on Security Council reform — one that is \r\nboth creative and persuasive — in order to take an \r\nearly decision during the current session of the General \r\nAssembly. At the same time, other important areas for \r\nreform must also be addressed. We need concrete \r\nresults in management reform if we are to demonstrate \r\nthat the United Nations is capable of reforming itself. \r\nIt is also our hope that there will be a constructive \r\ndialogue on the question of United Nations system-\r\nwide coherence, based on the report of the High-level \r\nPanel to be issued later this year. \r\n In this connection, I would also remind the \r\nMember States that world leaders resolved last year to \r\ndelete the long-obsolete “enemy State” clauses from \r\nthe United Nations Charter. This is another indication \r\nthat the United Nations is ready to step out of the past \r\nand into the new era. \r\n Having made a significant contribution to the \r\nactivities of the United Nations since its inception, \r\nJapan has an exemplary record with regard to the \r\nfulfilment of its duties as a Member State, including \r\nassessed contributions. Nevertheless, we strongly \r\nbelieve that the United Nations needs a reformed scale-\r\nof-assessments structure — one that is more equitable \r\nand fair and duly takes into account the status and \r\nresponsibilities of each Member State. Japan will work \r\ntogether with other Member States to formulate such a \r\nstructure, which will bring financial stability to this \r\nOrganization. \r\n Our common task for the sixty-first session is to \r\ncontinue our work and translate the decisions on \r\nreform made at the World Summit into reality. Let us \r\njoin forces once again and create an efficient and \r\neffective United Nations, so that Member States can \r\nbetter respond to the aspirations and expectations of \r\nthe international community for a better future. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to Her Excellency Mrs. Aksoltan Ataeva, \r\nchairperson of the delegation of Turkmenistan. \r\n Mrs. Ataeva (Turkmenistan) (spoke in Russian): \r\nAllow me to express my sincere gratitude for the \r\nhonour of speaking from this high rostrum and to \r\nconvey on behalf of Turkmenistan’s President, \r\nSaparmurat Niyazov, the best wishes for peace, well-\r\nA/61/PV.21  \r\n \r\n06-53615 34 \r\n \r\nbeing and prosperity to all the peoples of all countries. \r\nPermit me also to congratulate Madam Haya Rashed \r\nAl-Khalifa on her election to the lofty and responsible \r\npost of President and wish her success in guiding the \r\nfruitful work of the sixty-first session of the United \r\nNations General Assembly. \r\n Neutral Turkmenistan, which marks the fifteenth \r\nanniversary of its independence this year, builds its \r\nrelations in the international arena upon the principles \r\nof equal rights and mutually beneficial cooperation \r\nwith all States and international organizations. \r\nCooperation with the United Nations holds a special \r\nplace in Turkmenistan’s international relations. \r\nTurkmenistan welcomes constructive interaction \r\namong members of the community of nations in \r\nelaborating new and effective approaches aimed at \r\npreserving and maintaining security and stability in the \r\nworld and at achieving the objectives of sustainable \r\ndevelopment of countries and peoples. \r\n During the more than 10 years that have passed \r\nsince the adoption by the General Assembly of the \r\nresolution on the permanent neutrality of Turkmenistan \r\non 12 December 1995, our State has demonstrated in \r\npractice the fundamental nature of peace-loving and \r\nhumanist principles that have formed the basis of \r\nTurkmenistan’s policy since the day it acquired its \r\nindependence. \r\n I would like to avail this opportunity to express, \r\non behalf of Turkmenistan’s President, our appreciation \r\nto United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan for \r\nhis support of Turkmenistan’s foreign policy and for \r\nhis tireless efforts for the welfare of the world. \r\n Today we quite rightly can state that \r\nTurkmenistan, as a neutral State, has been \r\nunswervingly fulfilling its international obligations. \r\nThrough its actions, our country demonstrates its \r\nadherence to peace, cooperation, non-accession to \r\nalliances and military blocs, non-interference in the \r\ninternal affairs of other States, respect for their \r\nsovereignty and their right to their own paths of \r\ndevelopment. \r\n It is on the basis of peace, humanism and mutual \r\nrespect of interests that Turkmenistan approaches \r\nissues of international cooperation, giving top priority \r\nto interaction with the United Nations and its structures \r\nin the strategic areas of partnership. There is no \r\ndisputing the fact that the United Nations has been and \r\ncontinues to be the largest and most prestigious \r\ninternational Organization that has been entrusted with \r\nthe coordinating role in world affairs and on which \r\nhumankind pins its hopes for peaceful development. \r\n Turkmenistan welcomes efforts by the United \r\nNations, the General Assembly and the Security \r\nCouncil aimed at achieving goals of sustainable \r\ndevelopment, as well as meeting the challenges set by \r\nthe 2005 Summit, which determined how the world \r\ncommunity should address the most pressing problems \r\naffecting stability, humanitarian issues and \r\nstrengthening and improving the work of the United \r\nNations. \r\n We believe that the tangible results of the \r\ncollective efforts aimed at finding the best ways for the \r\nUnited Nations to proceed include such practical steps \r\nas the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission, \r\ncreation of the Human Rights Council and other \r\nconstructive steps. Improvement in the work of the \r\nSecurity Council is clearly one of the most important \r\nelements in completing the reform of the Organization. \r\nWe firmly believe that it is essential to carry out this \r\ntask; it is made necessary because of the objective \r\nprocesses of international development, increasing \r\ninteraction among States and increased need for \r\ncombining regional and global problems. \r\n The United Nations is the most important \r\ninternational structure, where comprehensive account \r\nhas to be taken of all factors underlying the processes \r\nin the world. Turkmenistan advocates strengthening the \r\nrole of the United Nations and its major bodies, when \r\ndecisions concerning the most pressing problems of \r\ntoday are taken. \r\n In this context, our country supports expansion of \r\nSecurity Council membership on the basis of the \r\ngreatest possible agreement among United Nations \r\nMember States. We also support initiating more \r\neffective and constructive dialogue between the \r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly. We \r\nbelieve that progress will continue in the reforms \r\nstarted at the United Nations. Turkmenistan also \r\nwelcomes expansion of the number of States \r\nrepresented in United Nations structures and \r\ninstitutions, while emphasizing the importance of \r\ngeographical distribution; this is in line with the basic \r\nvalues of our Organization. \r\n Turkmenistan’s steadfast position is that it \r\nfavours strengthening the United Nations in the \r\ninternational arena as the highest international forum \r\n A/61/PV.21\r\n \r\n35 06-53615 \r\n \r\nfor establishing a just and humane world order. \r\nTurkmenistan fundamentally advocates increasing the \r\npeacebuilding potential of the Organization, in \r\naccordance with the realities of global development. \r\nTherefore, our country devotes great attention to \r\nmaintaining most close contacts with offices of United \r\nNations specialized agencies, whose importance is \r\ncontinually growing today. \r\n One of Turkmenistan’s main achievements since \r\nindependence has been the primacy of the principle \r\nwhereby each nation has the right to chose its own path \r\nof development and acceptable form of State system. \r\nThis is an essential condition for stability and \r\nsustainable and progressive development in all spheres \r\nof society. Today, independent and neutral \r\nTurkmenistan is confidently advancing along its \r\nchosen path. Annually, our country’s economic growth \r\nsurpasses 20 per cent, with the volume of production \r\nper capita exceeding $8,000. \r\n Turkmenistan is celebrating its 15th anniversary \r\nas a State that has guaranteed its own food \r\nindependence. It provides its people with free natural \r\ngas, electricity, water, salt and low, in fact, symbolic \r\nprices for bread, utilities and public transport services, \r\ngasoline and so forth. All this is a tangible result of the \r\nlong-term programme of social and economic reform \r\ncarried out in our country under the leadership of the \r\nHead of the nation. Under this programme, over 60 per \r\ncent of the State budget is allocated to social spending. \r\n As a democratic State based on the rule of law, \r\nTurkmenistan is unwaveringly implementing the \r\nhighest principles allowing people to express their will. \r\nIn this regard, the Turkmen people possess a vast \r\nhistorical experience of democratic traditions, which \r\nare organically and progressively finding their way \r\ntoday into the social and political life of the country \r\nand are reflected in the continual enjoyment by citizens \r\nof their constitutional rights and freedoms. In this \r\nrespect, 2006 was a significant year for Turkmenistan. \r\nIn accordance with the decision of the highest \r\nrepresentative body of Government, the People’s \r\nCouncil, our country held elections to local self-\r\ngovernment on an open, democratic and competitive \r\nbasis. As of now, this practice is being implemented at \r\nother levels of Government. In this, we see the basis \r\nfor consistent and irreversible processes of \r\ndemocratization, with the ever-increasing involvement \r\nof citizens and public organizations in managing the \r\ncountry. In Turkmenistan, this process is advancing in \r\na natural way, thereby instilling in the people the sense \r\nthat they are masters of their land and that they are \r\nresponsible for their destiny and the destiny of their \r\ncountry. \r\n In terms of preserving peace and security, \r\nnon-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is \r\none of the most acute problems on today’s global \r\nagenda. Our country fully supports efforts by the world \r\ncommunity in this area and participates in their \r\nimplementation, both at the national and international \r\nlevels. We are taking concrete, practical steps in this \r\ndirection. \r\n It should be especially emphasized that, at the \r\nend of October 2005, the People’s Council of \r\nTurkmenistan adopted a Declaration in support of the \r\ninitiatives of international organizations against the \r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Also, on \r\n8 September, Turkmenistan, together with other States \r\nof the region, signed a treaty creating a Nuclear-\r\nWeapon-Free Zone in Central Asia. \r\n By these actions, our country is demonstrating in \r\npractice its firm commitment to the processes of \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation. In this connection \r\nwe pledge our readiness to implement the initiative of \r\nthe President of Turkmenistan — which was supported \r\nby the United Nations Secretary-General — to \r\nestablish a United Nations regional centre for \r\npreventive diplomacy in Central Asia. All the \r\nnecessary conditions and appropriate infrastructure are \r\nalready available in the capital of our State — \r\nAshgabat. \r\n The President returned to the Chair. \r\n Turkmenistan has demonstrated its existing \r\npotential and capabilities through its active cooperation \r\nwith the United Nations in organizing major \r\ninternational forums and conferences to discuss \r\npressing problems involving global and regional issues. \r\n Through practical multilateral dialogue we have \r\nbecome convinced that the prevention of potential \r\nconflicts requires early warning of emerging situations, \r\na broad-based analysis and elaboration of preventive \r\nstrategies. Therefore, Turkmenistan will continue to \r\nmake its contribution to improving multilateral \r\ncooperation in this important area in partnership with \r\nthe United Nations and its organs, while recognizing \r\nthe great importance of international experience in \r\npreventive diplomacy. \r\nA/61/PV.21  \r\n \r\n06-53615 36 \r\n \r\n Turkmenistan is a principled and determined \r\nparticipant in the struggle against the threat of \r\nterrorism. We regard terrorism in all its forms as a \r\nphenomenon that must be placed outside the \r\nframework of human civilization. We are convinced \r\nthat in order to combat terrorism today we need the \r\ncooperation of all States, including with regard to such \r\nimportant issues as cooperation in the search for and \r\nextradition of the organizers and participants of \r\nterrorist acts, as well as their collaborators. \r\n Turkmenistan fully supports the efforts of the \r\nSecretary-General in elaborating a global strategy in \r\nthe fight against terrorism and stands ready to provide \r\npractical assistance to the international community in \r\nits efforts in that direction. \r\n The United Nations is a unique reflection of \r\nactual changes occurring in the world and it has clearly \r\ndemonstrated the will and desire of States for \r\ncooperation within a stable environment. The strategic \r\ndirection of reforms and the chosen path towards \r\nqualitative improvement in the work of the community \r\nof nations has become the defining vector of those \r\nchanges. \r\n Turkmenistan views the reform of the United \r\nNations as a road map towards the further \r\nstrengthening and enhancement of its authority. We are \r\nconvinced that the United Nations has always been and \r\nremains the most universal international structure and \r\nthe most important guarantor of global stability, \r\nsecurity and development. Turkmenistan will continue \r\nto cooperate more closely with the United Nations in \r\nthe future with a view to helping it to fully display its \r\nenormous potential. \r\n The President: We have heard the last speaker in \r\nthe general debate for this meeting. Several \r\nrepresentatives have requested to exercise their right of \r\nreply. May I remind members that statements in \r\nexercise of the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes \r\nfor the first intervention and to 5 minutes for the \r\nsecond and should be made by delegations from their \r\nseats. \r\n I call on the representative of Bhutan. \r\n Mr. Penjo (Bhutan): My delegation would like to \r\nrespond to the statement made by the Deputy Prime \r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Nepal on \r\n25 September 2006, on the issue of the people in the \r\nrefugee camps in Eastern Nepal. \r\n The statement that there is unwillingness on the \r\npart of Bhutan to resolve the problem is totally false. \r\nThe Royal Government of Bhutan is committed to \r\nresolving the problem through a bilateral process with \r\nthe Government of Nepal, and our actions to date \r\nclearly demonstrate that commitment. The bilateral \r\nprocess was very close to a solution for the Kudanabari \r\ncamp, where the people had been classified into four \r\nagreed categories. It is untenable of the Nepalese \r\nGovernment to say that Bhutan is unwilling to find a \r\nresolution.  \r\n The international community is well aware of the \r\ndifficult political situation that Nepal has been in for \r\nthe last many years. The bilateral process has suffered \r\ndelays and disruptions as the result of frequent changes \r\nof Government in Nepal and resulting changes in that \r\nGovernment’s position. During recent meetings, the \r\ncurrent Government in Nepal has introduced a new \r\nelement, stating that the problem is between Bhutan \r\nand the camp people, and not between Bhutan and \r\nNepal, and that Bhutan should talk directly to the \r\npeople. The new Government of Nepal has even stated \r\nin the press that it would not abide by the past \r\nagreements reached between the two Governments.  \r\n The Royal Government will, under no \r\ncircumstance, conduct a dialogue with the people in the \r\ncamps, as their leaders have committed seditious and \r\ncriminal offences. The camps have been infiltrated by \r\nMaoist elements and several radical parties have been \r\nformed, which have declared the objective of carrying \r\nout armed struggle to overthrow the Royal Government \r\nof Bhutan. Moreover, it was the Nepalese Government \r\nthat opened the camps in Nepal and sought assistance \r\nfrom the Office of the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in 1991, when \r\nthere were only 304 people claiming to be refugees \r\nfrom Bhutan. Until mid-1993, all ethnic Nepalese \r\nclaiming to be Bhutanese refugees were admitted into \r\nthe camps without proper screening. Therefore, Nepal \r\nhas both a moral and legal responsibility for the \r\nproblem. The bilateral process is threatened by Nepal’s \r\ncurrent position, which would mean going back on all \r\nof the agreements reached between the two \r\nGovernments and undoing all that has been achieved in \r\nthe past 13 years. \r\n During our most recent meeting with the \r\nGovernment of Nepal in New York, on 20 September \r\n2006, the Bhutanese delegation conveyed to the \r\nNepalese delegation that the Royal Government of \r\n A/61/PV.21\r\n \r\n37 06-53615 \r\n \r\nBhutan is firmly committed to the bilateral process and \r\nthat the only way forward is to implement the \r\nagreements that have been reached through arduous \r\nnegotiations over many years. My delegation would \r\nlike to reiterate that commitment and urges the \r\nGovernment of Nepal to do likewise. \r\n Mr. Shinyo (Japan): Thank you for allowing us \r\nto exercise our right of reply. My comments are related \r\nto the statement of the representative of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea this morning. First, we \r\nfirmly believe that the qualifications of a given country \r\nfor permanent membership in the Security Council \r\nshould be judged based on that country’s contribution \r\nto the purpose of the United Nations, in particular, to \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security. \r\n Secondly, regarding the issues of the past, the \r\nposition of the Government of Japan has been clearly \r\nexpressed on a number of occasions, including in the \r\nJapan-Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nPyongyang Declaration of 2002, in the statement of the \r\nformer Prime Minister at the Asian-African Summit in \r\nBandung, Indonesia in 2005 and in his statement on \r\n15 August 2002 commemorating the sixtieth \r\nanniversary of the end of the second World War. I \r\nrefrain from repeating those statements, but the fact \r\nremains that, as the Permanent Representative of Japan \r\nexpressed in his statement in the general debate just 20 \r\nminutes ago, Japan has been a peace-loving nation and \r\nhas continuously contributed to the goals of the United \r\nNations through a variety of means since it joined this \r\norganization fifty years ago. \r\n Mr. Sin Song Chol (Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea): In his statement, the representative \r\nof Japan proceeded to cover up Japan’s ambition to \r\nrepeat its aggression against Korea by criticizing the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea. Throughout \r\nthe statement, my delegation felt that threats in the \r\nNorth-East Asia region are coming from Japan. The \r\nthreats from Japan are as follows. \r\n The first threat is Japan’s distortion and \r\nembellishment of its crime-ridden history. The denial \r\nand distortion of aggression and crimes against \r\nhumanity committed in the past are intended as a \r\nmeans to revive these evils again. Today, Japan’s ultra-\r\nright-wing conservative authorities are attempting to \r\nturn Japan’s entire society to the right, to speed up \r\nmilitarization and to legitimize its overseas aggression \r\nby amending the constitution. Rampant incitement to \r\nhatred and antagonism against the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea, as well as terror against Korean \r\nresidents in Japan and their organization — which is \r\ncalled Chongryon — show that the threat of mew \r\naggression from Japan has now become a reality.  \r\n Another threat posed by Japan is that, as a junior \r\nally and servant of the United States, Japan is \r\nexecuting the United States policy of aggression \r\nagainst Asia. Japan thereby seeks to realize its \r\nambition to commit aggression against Korea by \r\navailing itself of the United States Asia strategy. All of \r\nJapan’s manoeuvres against the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea are undertaken on the instructions \r\nfrom the United States and stem from Japan’s deceitful \r\nand cunning intention to realize its purposes with the \r\nhelp of its master, namely, the United States. \r\n The Korean people have a deep-seated grudge \r\nagainst Japan that must be paid off with blood. During \r\nthe more than 40 years of its occupation of Korea, \r\nJapan forcibly drafted and abducted 8.4 million \r\nKoreans, and forced military sexual slavery on 200,000 \r\nwomen and girls. Even today, after more than half a \r\ncentury, we do not know the whereabouts of most of \r\nthose victims. Japanese authorities who make a fuss \r\nabout human rights and the rule of law are not giving a \r\nsincere and coherent response about the fate of those \r\nvictims; nor are they apologizing or compensating \r\nhonestly for their past crimes against humanity.  \r\n The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is \r\nhighly vigilant as to the threats posed by Japan in \r\ncooperation with the United States. Fully conscious of \r\nits responsibility to the history and destiny of its people \r\nand its responsibility for peace and security on the \r\nKorean Peninsula, as well as in Asia and the Pacific \r\nregion, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is \r\nspeeding up its full preparedness to resolutely counter \r\nany threats from Japan. \r\n I would like to conclude my intervention by \r\nreiterating that Japan is dangerous because, while it is \r\nrich in wealth, it is very poor in terms of morality and \r\nethics. \r\n Mr. Shinyo (Japan): My delegation would like to \r\nexercise its right of reply once again in response to the \r\nstatement just made by the representative of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea. It is very \r\nunfortunate that the representative of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea refers to the issues of the \r\npast. Although it was not my intention to take the floor, \r\nA/61/PV.21  \r\n \r\n06-53615 38 \r\n \r\nmy delegation is compelled to respond briefly to the \r\npoints that the representative of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea has raised. \r\n With regard to the problems of the past, I stated \r\nin my previous intervention that Japan has repeated \r\nmany times — at the highest institutional and political \r\nlevels — that this issue has been settled. We are of the \r\nview that that should be taken into consideration. \r\n My delegation would like to remind the Assembly \r\nthat, in the Joint Statement of the Six-Party Talks, \r\nissued on 19 September 2005 in Beijing, both Japan \r\nand the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\ncommitted themselves to take steps to normalize their \r\nrelations in accordance with the Pyongyang \r\nDeclaration and on the basis of the settlement of \r\nunfortunate past and outstanding issues of concern. \r\nBased on that commitment, Japan is ready to discuss \r\nthe settlement of the past, as well as other outstanding \r\nissues, in bilateral talks between Japan and the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea. My delegation \r\nwould like to stress the importance of both parties \r\nexpressing themselves in a constructive and sincere \r\nmanner in the bilateral talks, so as to improve relations. \r\n With regard to the point that has been raised \r\npertaining to past humanitarian issues, the Government  \r\n \r\nof Japan is sincerely confronting the fact that many \r\npeople were in an “unfortunate situation” in the past, \r\nand has expressed its deep remorse and heartfelt \r\napologies. However, the numbers that have been put \r\nforth by the delegation of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea are greatly exaggerated, and we \r\ncannot accept them. \r\n With regard to problem of outstanding issues \r\nbetween Japan and the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea, my delegation would once again like to point \r\nout that the Pyongyang Declaration calls for those \r\nissues to be settled bilaterally. That also should of \r\ncourse be taken into consideration.  \r\n My delegation would also like to point out that, \r\nas our Permanent Representative mentioned just 20 or \r\n30 minutes ago, in the more than 50 years of its \r\nmembership of the United Nations, Japan has been a \r\npeace-loving country that has contributed to \r\ninternational peace and security. Of course, Japan has \r\nalso promoted and strengthened regional peace and \r\nsecurity in our part of the world. That is a fact about \r\nwhich almost every country Member of the United \r\nNations is aware. \r\n The meeting rose at 7 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n"
