(Bahrain) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\n The President: I give the floor to His Excellency \r\nMr. Gilles Noghès, chairman of the delegation of the \r\nPrincipality of Monaco. \r\n Mr. Noghès (Monaco) (spoke in French): Few \r\nwomen before you, Madam, have been elected to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly, despite the fact \r\nthat, as the Chinese proverb states, women hold up half \r\nthe sky. We are delighted by your election and \r\ncongratulate you and your country, Bahrain. Our \r\ncongratulations go also to the Group of Asian States, \r\nwhich, happily, put your name forward. You can rest \r\nassured that our delegation will always be ready to \r\nsupport you as you carry out you lofty and challenging \r\ntask. \r\n We would also like to congratulate your \r\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson, on \r\nhaving so successfully guided the work of the General \r\nAssembly during the previous session, as well as for \r\nhis understanding of the capacity of Member States to \r\novercome their differences. Because of his \r\nperseverance, the majority of the reforms resulting \r\nfrom the commitments entered into at the 2005 World \r\nSummit have been implemented. \r\n At the beginning of this debate we heard Mr. Kofi \r\nAnnan present his report on the work of the \r\nOrganization (A/61/1) for the last time. He clearly set \r\nout for us his beliefs and accomplishments and his \r\nrecommendations for strengthening the United Nations. \r\nMy delegation associates itself with the numerous \r\ntributes paid to the Secretary-General. We also wish to \r\nconvey to him our profound gratitude for his \r\ncourageous efforts over the past 10 years. Thanks to \r\nthe extensive experience he acquired at the \r\nOrganization, he was able to move the United Nations \r\nforward — in an environment fraught with threats and \r\nnew challenges — to meet the expectations aroused as \r\na result of the upheavals caused by globalization. His \r\nclear vision made it possible to establish the existence \r\nof the nexus between peace, development and human \r\nrights — Charter principles that have repeatedly \r\nunderpinned our common efforts.  \r\n Guided by the watchful motivation of His Serene \r\nHighness Prince Albert II, the Government of Monaco \r\nhas worked to increase its contribution to development \r\nand international cooperation through a significant \r\nincrease in official development assistance (ODA). In \r\nthat connection, cooperation credits have increased by \r\n30 per cent in 2006. The Principality will continue its \r\nefforts to expeditiously reach the goals set and \r\nreaffirmed last year at this very rostrum by His Serene \r\nHighness the Sovereign Prince.  \r\n The advancement of women, improving child and \r\nmaternal health and the alleviation of poverty are \r\namong the Principality’s priorities on the international \r\nsphere. The Sovereign Prince and his sisters, Princess \r\nCaroline of Hanover and Princess Stéphanie of \r\nA/61/PV.23  \r\n \r\n06-53958 2 \r\n \r\nMonaco, are greatly involved in development efforts \r\nintended to help the most destitute. In her capacity as a \r\ngoodwill ambassador for the United Nations \r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, Her \r\nRoyal Highness the Princess of Hanover is helping to \r\npromote programmes to educate girls and women. Part \r\nof that effort includes a project undertaken by Monaco, \r\nAndorra, Cyprus, Luxembourg and San Marino on the \r\ntheme of human rights and education in combating \r\npoverty and promoting the independence of girls and \r\nwomen. \r\n As President of the World Association of \r\nChildren’s Friends, the Princess has long led an \r\nongoing struggle to protect children. On the recent \r\noccasion of being honoured by UNICEF-USA, the \r\nPrincess of Hanover stated that “today we are at war \r\nagainst terror, especially against the terror in the eyes, \r\nhearts and spirits of millions of children around the \r\nworld”. \r\n This session will provide impetus to the effort to \r\npromote and protect the rights of children with next \r\nOctober’s publication of a study by the independent \r\nexpert Paulo Pinheiro, to which the Principality is \r\nproud to have contributed. Let us not forget that, as \r\nJean-Paul Sartre wrote, violence, regardless of what \r\nform it takes, constitutes a failure.  \r\n We hope that, following the Security Council’s \r\ndebates on the protection of children in armed conflict, \r\nthe effective implementation of Council resolution \r\n1620 (2005) will lead to progress in this area of such \r\nconcern. It is unacceptable in human terms for the \r\nperpetrators of such crimes to go unpunished.  \r\n During her presence here last June to attend the \r\nHigh-level Meeting on HIV/AIDS, Princess Stéphanie \r\nof Monaco expressed her solidarity with all those \r\nfighting the disease or otherwise affected. Through her \r\nFight AIDS Monaco association, the Princess is \r\nworking to promote prevention, research and assistance \r\nto those affected by the virus — especially sero-\r\npositive people, who are often victims of \r\ndiscrimination. In that regard, the Princess has \r\nexpressed the wish that the dignity of every sero-\r\npositive person be respected. Her association will \r\nsupport the establishment of an entity to provide \r\npsychological support for those ill with the disease in \r\nan African country where many non-governmental \r\norganizations from Monaco have already carried out \r\ndevelopment efforts.  \r\n The upcoming appointment of Princess Stéphanie \r\nas a special representative of the Joint United Nations \r\nProgramme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) will further \r\nstrengthen her commitment to the fight against this \r\nterrible pandemic, which is increasingly affecting more \r\nand more women. To address that situation, the \r\nGovernment of Monaco has decided that, in addition to \r\nthe support it provides to UNAIDS, it will begin this \r\nyear to finance a United Nations Population Fund \r\nproject in Africa focusing mainly on sero-positive \r\nwomen suffering from extreme poverty and \r\npsychological distress and providing them with \r\nmedical, psychological and social assistance.  \r\n Our heads of State or Government resolved to \r\ntake action when they accepted the responsibility to \r\nprotect. It is of course up to individual States to protect \r\ntheir populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic \r\ncleansing and crimes against humanity. But when such \r\ntragic events cannot be prevented, it falls to the \r\ninternational community, working through the United \r\nNations, to be prepared to immediately provide \r\nassistance to victims of such acts.  \r\n Whether a catastrophe is natural or man-made, it \r\nis crucial that we be able to meet the most pressing \r\nneeds of civilian populations. In that regard, we would \r\nlike to commend the Under-Secretary-General for \r\nHumanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief \r\nCoordinator and his Office for their ongoing efforts, \r\nespecially as regards the restructuring of the Central \r\nEmergency Response Fund. Monaco is a contributor to \r\nthe Fund and intends to continue its efforts to provide \r\nfinancing for humanitarian assistance during the years \r\nto come.  \r\n Before the end of this year, His Serene Highness \r\nPrince Albert II will once again visit the fishing village \r\nof Sirombu on Nias Island, Indonesia, which has twice \r\nbeen struck by natural disaster: first by a tidal wave in \r\nDecember 2004 and, a few months later, by an \r\nearthquake. The village has been rebuilt thanks to the \r\neffective and generous action of the Monaco-Asia \r\nAssociation.  \r\n As the Sovereign Prince announced that it would \r\nduring the 2005 World Summit (see A/60/PV./6), \r\nMonaco ratified the Kyoto Protocol last February.  \r\n Our head of State has a personal and ongoing \r\ncommitment to protecting the environment. That \r\ncommitment was recently evidenced in the polar \r\nexpedition he undertook 100 years after the one made \r\n A/61/PV.23\r\n \r\n3 06-53958 \r\n \r\nby his great-great grandfather, Prince Albert I, a \r\npioneer of modern oceanography. Having reached the \r\nNorth Pole with his team on 16 April 2006, following \r\nfour days on an arduous course on dog sleds from the \r\nRussian base of Barneo, Prince Albert II launched an \r\nurgent appeal regarding the dangers of global warming, \r\nunfortunately in evidence in the Arctic in the \r\nsignificant shrinking of the ice shelf. Back in Monaco, \r\nHis Serene Highness established a foundation devoted \r\nto environmental preservation and sustainable \r\ndevelopment that will serve as a permanent source of \r\ndynamic and innovative efforts in the areas of climate \r\nchange, biodiversity loss and water resources.  The \r\nPrincipality is also pleased to have been elected to the \r\nUnited Nations Commission on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment. We hope to contribute to improving the \r\nUnited Nations environmental machinery. \r\n The Principality of Monaco believes that there is \r\na need to establish and strengthen dialogue among \r\ncivilizations in order to prevent conflict. We support all \r\nefforts aimed at actively promoting a culture of peace \r\nand mutual respect among the world’s various creeds, \r\ncultures and languages. As Secretary-General Kofi \r\nAnnan stated in 1999, “The greater the appreciation of \r\ndiversity, the deeper the sense of identity and the \r\nsounder the enlargement of the common denominator \r\nof values” (A/54/546, para. 13). \r\n It is in that spirit that Monaco, aware of the \r\nuniversal value of sport as one of the best tools to \r\nestablish inter-cultural dialogue, fully supports the \r\nUnited Nations Action Plan on Sport for Development \r\nand Peace. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Mahe Tupouniua, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of the Kingdom of Tonga. \r\n Mr. Tupouniua (Tonga): The Tongan delegation \r\njoins others in congratulating you, Madam, on your \r\nassumption of the presidency of the General Assembly. \r\nLet us reassure you of Tonga’s full support and its \r\nconfidence that the sixty-first session of the General \r\nAssembly will be productive and successful under your \r\nvery able leadership. Full recognition is also in order \r\nfor the excellent work of your predecessor, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Jan Eliasson, during the sixtieth session \r\nof the General Assembly. In the same vein, the Tongan \r\ndelegation takes this opportunity to commend and \r\nextend its gratitude to the outgoing Secretary-General, \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, for his tireless service \r\nover the past 10 years in the stewardship of the \r\nOrganization. \r\n It has been a year since our leaders met at the \r\nhistoric World Summit in an effort to embrace the \r\nrealities of the world we live in and to duly reflect \r\nthose challenges in the work of the Organization. We \r\nare pleased that there are specific landmarks that attest \r\nto the fact that some progress has been made in the \r\nimplementation of the 2005 Outcome Document \r\n(resolution 60/1). They include the inauguration of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, coupled with the \r\nestablishment of the Peacebuilding Support Office and \r\nthe Peacebuilding Fund; the creation of the Human \r\nRights Council; and the establishment of the Central \r\nEmergency Response Fund. \r\n Mr. Chidyausiku (Zimbabwe), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair. \r\n Tonga also welcomes the adoption of the United \r\nNations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution \r\n60/288), which forms a basis upon which we can build \r\nour consistent and unequivocal condemnation of \r\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations — \r\ncommitted by whomever, whenever and for whatever \r\npurpose — for terrorism constitutes one of the most \r\nserious threats to international peace and security. We \r\nlook forward to the effective implementation of the \r\nStrategy, as well as to the conclusion of a \r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism \r\nduring the sixty-first session of the General Assembly. \r\n Tonga also remains committed to supporting the \r\nwork of the Counter-Terrorism Committee. We duly \r\nrecognize the efforts undertaken to consolidate States’ \r\nreporting requirements. We also wish to acknowledge \r\nthe cooperation provided by bilateral, regional and \r\nmultilateral agencies in helping to fulfil international \r\nand regional commitments to combat transnational \r\norganized crime and to fight terrorism. \r\n Tonga shares the call for the full restoration of \r\nthe role of the General Assembly as the main decision-\r\nmaking, representative and policy-making body of the \r\nUnited Nations, in accordance with the provisions of \r\nthe Charter. That would further enhance the credibility \r\nof multilateralism and the important need to address \r\nthe multifaceted and interconnected challenges and \r\nthreats confronting the world. \r\n Tonga supports the work pertaining to the \r\nremainder of the reform mandates, especially as \r\nA/61/PV.23  \r\n \r\n06-53958 4 \r\n \r\nregards Secretariat and management reforms, the \r\nstrengthening of the Economic and Social Council and \r\nthe strengthening and streamlining of management in \r\nthe Organization. \r\n The important issue of the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil still remains unresolved, although world \r\nleaders acknowledged that it was an essential element \r\nof our overall effort. Tonga supports the call by the \r\nSecretary-General in his annual report (A/61/1) to find \r\ncommon ground for action on this fundamental piece \r\nof overall United Nations reform, as well as his urging \r\nthat a decision on Council reform be taken sooner \r\nrather than later in order to ensure that the United \r\nNations machinery to promote the establishment and \r\nmaintenance of peace and security will remain relevant \r\nand credible to meet today’s and tomorrow’s \r\nchallenges. Tonga continues to support Japan’s \r\nassumption of its proper and permanent place in any \r\nenhanced Council.  \r\n Tonga commends the contributions of United \r\nNations peacekeepers in fulfilling the Organization/s \r\nvital role in helping parties in conflict to end \r\nhostilities. To the degree that it is able, Tonga is \r\ncommitted to supporting both international and \r\nregional peacekeeping efforts, including the current \r\nRegional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands. \r\n For many island developing countries, including \r\nmy own, the development agenda remains a top \r\npriority. In that regard, the theme of the sixty-first \r\nsession of the General Assembly, “Implementing a \r\nglobal partnership for development”, is not only very \r\npertinent but also very timely. While we reiterate that \r\nwe take primary responsibility for our own \r\ndevelopment, we continue to welcome as a necessary \r\nstep the maintenance and enhancement of support at \r\nthe regional and international levels to complement our \r\nnational efforts. That includes the support provided \r\nunder the Pacific Plan to strengthen regional \r\ncooperation and integration, which was endorsed by \r\nPacific leaders in 2005, as well as the implementation \r\nof the Mauritius Strategy for the Further \r\nImplementation of the Programme of Action for the \r\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing \r\nStates. \r\n Tonga looks forward to progress in the work to \r\nenhance mechanisms to promote coherent United \r\nNations support to small island developing States \r\nthrough a strengthened inter-agency consultative \r\nprocess, the finalization of a strategy for resource \r\nmobilization and the promotion of partnership \r\ninitiatives. \r\n In May of this year, His Majesty’s Government \r\nratified its Strategic Development Plan 8, entitled \r\n“Looking to the future, building on the past”, which \r\nsets out the Government’s road map for the Kingdom’s \r\nfuture development path for the period 2006-2007 to \r\n2008-2009. The document was formulated following a \r\nlengthy and extensive process of consultation with all \r\nof the relevant stakeholders. It provides due \r\nrecognition to the fact that the success of the \r\nimplementation of the Development Plan will require \r\nthe efforts of both State and non-State actors. \r\n The President of the General Assembly has \r\nrightly observed that the recent historic High-level \r\nDialogue on International Migration and Development \r\nrevealed the potential and opportunities that \r\nglobalization presents as a force for improving the \r\nlives of millions of people. The meeting provided \r\nTonga, a mature migration-remittance economy, with \r\nthe opportunity to showcase the important nexus \r\nbetween migration and development. \r\n A study recently produced by the World Bank \r\nconcluded that, for Tonga, recipient household \r\nmigration and remittances have positive impacts on \r\nmigrant-sending countries through improved income \r\ndistribution and poverty alleviation, induced higher \r\nsavings and stimulated business activities, resulting in \r\nlarger investments in education. The study also \r\nhighlighted that improved and restricted, but \r\norganized, labour mobility can significantly contribute \r\nto a country’s gross domestic product and to overall \r\nglobal income. Labour mobility is therefore a potential \r\nvehicle for achieving our commitment to pro-poor \r\nstrategies such as the Millennium Development Goals \r\nand other commitments, and also for achieving national \r\nsustainable development strategies. \r\n The suspension of the Doha round of trade talks \r\nwas disappointing. The failure to conclude the talks \r\nwill negatively affect global economic prospects and \r\nthe growth of low-income countries, including Tonga. \r\nWe join others in urging World Trade Organization \r\nmember countries to maintain their commitment to the \r\nrules-based multilateral trading system, preserve \r\nprogress that has been achieved and to continue with \r\nthe negotiations. We also continue to urge the donor \r\ncommunity to move forward with the delivery of aid \r\n A/61/PV.23\r\n \r\n5 06-53958 \r\n \r\nfor trade, independent of the Doha round. Regional \r\ncooperation on trade-related projects has the potential \r\nto promote the competitiveness of low-income \r\ncountries, such as the island economies of the Pacific. \r\n In October 2005, Tonga’s Legislative Assembly \r\npassed a motion to establish a National Committee of \r\nthe Kingdom of Tonga on Political Reform. With the \r\nsupport of His Majesty’s Government, the Committee \r\nchaired by His Late Royal Highness Prince \r\nTu’ipelehake has completed public meetings and \r\nconsultations throughout Tonga as well as in the \r\ncountries where the majority of Tongans reside, \r\nnamely, New Zealand, Australia and the United States \r\nof America. It is anticipated that the report will be \r\ndeliberated upon by the Legislative Assembly during \r\nits 2006 session and by His Majesty’s Government \r\nwith a view to attaining an appropriate political reform \r\nagenda that is not only responsive but also responsible \r\nfor fulfilling the objectives of building national unity \r\nand promoting the social and economic advancement \r\nof the people of Tonga. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Léo Mérorès, Chairman of the \r\ndelegation of Republic of Haiti. \r\n Mr. Mérorès (Haiti) (spoke in French): I am \r\nhonoured to address the Assembly on behalf of the \r\nGovernment and people of Haiti. Allow me, first, to \r\noffer my heartfelt congratulations to Ms. Haya Rashed \r\nAl-Khalifa on her election to the presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly in its sixty-first session. I am \r\nconvinced that her wealth of legal training, her \r\nprofound knowledge of public affairs, her national and \r\ninternational career and her keen negotiating skills \r\nmean that this session will be a success. Allow me to \r\nreiterate to the President the full support of my country \r\nand of the Haitian delegation in discharging her lofty \r\ntasks. \r\n I wish also to congratulate Ambassador Jan \r\nEliasson, whose practical spirit, his sense of \r\ncompromise and great know-how, meant that the \r\nsixtieth session was a successful one. I wish him every \r\nsuccess in his new job as his country’s Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs.  \r\n I wish to convey to the Secretary-General, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Kofi Annan, sincere thanks for the skill \r\nwith which he has conducted the Organization over the \r\npast 10 years. I congratulate him also on his continued \r\ncommitment to my country. The people of Haiti is \r\nprofoundly grateful to him for his subtlety and \r\ndetermination demonstrated in the quest for viable \r\nlasting solutions to the long crisis that has beset my \r\ncountry in recent years. Mr. Annan deserves the full \r\nappreciation of the international community for his \r\nlaudable, indefatigable efforts for peace, justice, human \r\nrights, democracy and development. \r\n On 3 July 2006, the Republic of Haiti regained its \r\nseat in the Caribbean Community and Common Market \r\n(CARICOM), thus putting an end to an absence of two \r\nlong years. We recognize that during this period our \r\nbrothers and sisters in the Caribbean never lost interest \r\nin Haiti’s affairs. Quite the contrary: they were \r\nstrongly committed to finding appropriate solutions, \r\nwhich have allowed my country today to have the \r\nhonour to participate side by side with them in the \r\ngreat debates concerning the region. On 11 September, \r\nHaiti finally rejoined the great family of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement, whose purpose is to \r\nstrengthen South-South cooperation. This was most \r\nwelcome. Those two events clearly show that we want \r\nto be open to the world.  \r\n I would like to take this opportunity to welcome \r\nthe accession of the Republic of Montenegro to \r\npolitical sovereignty and to the great family of our \r\nOrganization. \r\n Today, more than ever before, our world is facing \r\nmanifold threats that imperil its very existence. Despite \r\nthe Organization’s intensive efforts to make the world \r\nmore human and more liveable, the spectre of major \r\npandemics, poverty, hunger, organized crime, \r\nterrorism, armed conflict, civil war and natural \r\ndisasters continues to haunt us. We therefore need to \r\nredouble our efforts to refine our diplomatic \r\napproaches and to give priority to dialogue, honest, \r\nopen negotiations, flexibility and compromise. Those \r\nprinciples lie at the very basis of the creation of the \r\nUnited Nations and reaffirm its strength and its raison \r\nd’être. Our Organization remains the ideal forum, the \r\nreference point for finding appropriate solutions to the \r\nproblems that beset our world. Nothing should make us \r\nabandon that spirit. \r\n The Republic of Haiti unreservedly supports all \r\nof the international community’s initiatives to resolve \r\nconflicts in Africa, in East Asia and in the Middle East \r\nby finding peaceful negotiated solutions respectful of \r\nthe sovereignty of States. \r\nA/61/PV.23  \r\n \r\n06-53958 6 \r\n \r\n Terrorism is today assuming apocalyptic \r\nproportions. The attacks of 11 September 2001 against \r\ntargets in the United States and subsequent attacks \r\nelsewhere in the world were wake-up calls to us, \r\nforcing us to silence our petty interests in order to face \r\nthis scourge which, unless it is swiftly curbed, will lead \r\nto catastrophes with untold consequences. We cannot \r\nmake mistakes and we cannot hesitate. Recently, we \r\nhave been impotent, as we witness an infernal cycle of \r\nviolence, massive destruction of innocent human lives \r\nand property. We are seeing attempts to annihilate our \r\ninstitutions and our society. The very future of \r\nhumanity seems to be taken hostage by unbridled \r\ngroups that stop at nothing to destroy wherever they \r\ncan. The Republic of Haiti reaffirms once more its \r\nresolve to fight terrorism in all its forms, using the few \r\nresources that it has. It supports the preventive \r\nmeasures taken against terrorism, measures taken in a \r\nlegal context. We encourage States to agree on a global \r\nconvention on terrorism based on a clear definition \r\nacceptable to all. \r\n Haiti welcomes the major steps taken to reform \r\nthe United Nations at the previous session. We are still \r\nfar from our goals, but some very significant progress \r\nhas, nonetheless, been made. We hope that the changes \r\ndecided on will continue to give our Organization the \r\nresources it needs to carry out its global vocation. We \r\nmust adapt to new requirements, as we reaffirmed at \r\nthe World Summit of 2005. Accordingly, I applaud the \r\ncreation of the Peacebuilding Commission. It should \r\nplay an important part and its purpose is political \r\nstability, creating sustainable foundations for \r\nsocioeconomic development in post-conflict situations, \r\nas well as to help strengthen democratic institutions \r\nand make them effective in a constitutional framework \r\nand under the rule of law.  \r\n Similarly, I also welcome General Assembly \r\nresolution 60/251, which created the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. I congratulate the 47 members of the Council, \r\nwho were elected in May in order to put their \r\nexperience to use in promoting and protecting human \r\nrights. I hope that this new body will, in many respects, \r\nhelp to develop our society, to make it more open to \r\ndialogue, understanding, mutual respect, social justice \r\nand tolerance.  \r\n Haiti also welcomes the creation of the Central \r\nEmergency Relief Fund. It will provide upfront \r\nresources to enable the United Nations to finance \r\nhumanitarian relief operations, as soon as a catastrophe \r\noccurs, in other words, to do more, faster.  \r\n My Government agrees with the idea of \r\nrevitalizing the Economic and Social Council. As one \r\nof the main organs of the Organization, it should be \r\nmore involved in development activities in countries \r\nthat have been sidelined by history, especially the least \r\ndeveloped countries (LDCs). It should provide greater \r\ncohesion in adopting the best approach for attaining the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). The question \r\nof harmonizing strategies and actions among the \r\nentities of the United Nations system that work in the \r\narea of development is, for us, a crucial one.  \r\n Through the Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti of \r\nthe Economic and Social Council, my country enjoys \r\nthe support of the Council and, recently, at the high-\r\nlevel substantive meeting held in Geneva last July, the \r\nCouncil extended the mandate of that group through \r\nJuly 2007, with the possibility of being renewed once \r\nmore. I welcome the idea that this extension will \r\nenable various sectors involved in the sustained \r\ndevelopment of Haiti to achieve tangible results for my \r\ncountry.  \r\n Since 1945, date of the creation of the United \r\nNations, of which my country was a founding Member, \r\nthe international landscape has undergone profound \r\nchange. However, after more than sixty years, the \r\ninstitutional framework of the Security Council has \r\nremained the same. Any reform of the Organization \r\nwould, therefore, be incomplete were it not to include a \r\nreorganization of the Security Council. The \r\ncomposition of the Security Council must, therefore, \r\nreflect the realities of the twenty-first century and \r\ninclude Member States that are capable of shouldering \r\nresponsibilities of area of the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. In this new desirable \r\nconfiguration, it is crucial that developing countries \r\nfrom Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean \r\nenjoy equitable representation.  \r\n In February 2006, Haiti held historic, fair and \r\ndemocratic elections. This process will be completed at \r\nthe end of the year by municipal elections and \r\nterritorial elections, which will help restore democracy \r\nand open the way to political stability. The people of \r\nHaiti as a whole decided in favour of change capable of \r\ngiving it security and improved living conditions. I \r\nwelcome the activities of the international community \r\nfor the support and assistance it gave and has continued \r\n A/61/PV.23\r\n \r\n7 06-53958 \r\n \r\nto give to Haiti. I salute the Group of Friends of Haiti \r\nand all Members of the Organization that have spared \r\nno effort or sacrifice to support the United Nations \r\nStabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) by \r\nproviding it with military or police personnel.  \r\n I also welcome the adoption of Security Council \r\nresolution 1702 (2006) of 15 August 2006, which \r\nrenewed the mandate of MINUSTAH. I hope that this \r\nmission, which is doing a very difficult job — \r\nsometimes a dangerous, but noble job — will, together \r\nwith the national police of Haiti and the Government, \r\nmanage to control the wanton insecurity that is \r\nbesetting Haitian society. I therefore call upon the \r\nmission to work closely with the Haitian authorities to \r\nmake the necessary changes depending on the priorities \r\nof the moment.  \r\n I hope that international assistance will also focus \r\non reforming the judicial system, on the \r\nprofessionalization of the police and on strengthening \r\ndemocratic institutions, such as the parliament, \r\nmunicipal bodies and the territorial collectives. \r\n To the parents, friends and colleagues of \r\npeaceworkers who died in Haiti in the line of duty, I \r\nwould like to reiterate the pain and sorrow of our \r\nGovernment and the Haitian people, who recognize the \r\nimportance of the United Nations presence in Haiti, the \r\nultimate goal of which is to help the country to recover \r\nits stability.  \r\n The new team that the head of State of Haiti, \r\nMr. René Garcia Préval, has the privilege of leading \r\nsince he assumed office in May, has embarked on the \r\nlong-term task of rebuilding the country. The task is to \r\nrestore security, to build a modern State, to strengthen \r\ndemocratic institutions and to offer favourable \r\nconditions for investment in order to create wealth that \r\nbenefits everybody. In order to attract investors and \r\ncreate conditions that favour sustainable development, \r\nthe implementation of basic infrastructure projects is \r\nimperative, e.g., the building of roads, ports, airports, \r\nproviding electricity to the main towns of the country, \r\nimproving telecommunications networks, all of which \r\nrequires the support of the international community.  \r\n Lack of security is a fertile ground for all kinds \r\nof temptation. It favours destabilizing elements that \r\nexploit the subhuman conditions under which a large \r\nnumber of our poor live, by arming them to sow death \r\nand destruction in the Haitian family, thus imperilling \r\nthe very future of our Republic. Attacking this lack of \r\nsecurity and the climate of violence marked by \r\ndramatic kidnappings and deadly clashes between \r\narmed gangs and the police is one of the top priorities \r\nof my Government. Dialogue, on the one hand, and \r\ntoughness, on the other hand, are necessary in finding a \r\nviable solution to banditry, which in recent times has \r\nbeen spreading in the country, causing a flight of \r\ncapital as well as a brain drain. Accordingly, the \r\ntechnical and financial support of the international \r\ncommunity is therefore essential in the effective \r\nimplementation of the disarmament, demobilization \r\nand reintegration programme. We are aware that Haiti \r\nis not a classic case, but that does not mean that we \r\nshould do nothing.  \r\n In order to provide speedy relief to the sufferings \r\nof the masses and to reduce, even eliminate, the \r\nsources of gang recruitment, my Government has \r\nlaunched a social pacification programme. This \r\nprogramme provides for the establishment of a \r\ndatabase of more than 300 projects and actions in \r\nvarious sectors of our national life and throughout the \r\nterritory. It will help create labour-intensive jobs and \r\nwill enable the State to reduce unemployment, to \r\nguarantee some relief and thereby to reduce \r\nwrongdoing.  \r\n Moreover, in order to create a climate conducive \r\nto good governance our head of State initiated an open, \r\nhonest dialogue with all political sectors upon his \r\nelection to the presidency. They understood the \r\nurgency and responded positively to the invitation by \r\nagreeing to participate in the current outward-looking \r\nGovernment, which includes members of various \r\npolitical parties, which are also represented in \r\nparliament. The point is to achieve social cohesion and \r\npolitical reconciliation, which are essential for \r\nstability, security, economic recovery and the \r\nrebuilding of an inclusive society. \r\n The international conference for the economic \r\nand social development of Haiti, which was held in \r\nPort-au-Prince on 25 July 2006, produced promises of \r\nfinancial commitment by the international community. \r\nMy Government intends to carry out a long-term \r\ndevelopment plan. That attests to our strong \r\ncommitment to take control of the destiny of the \r\ncountry, and that of our international partners to \r\nrespect the priorities defined by the Government.  \r\n In order to facilitate the task of the Government \r\nto create the necessary conditions for true economic \r\nA/61/PV.23  \r\n \r\n06-53958 8 \r\n \r\nand social development, I call upon donors to live up to \r\ntheir promises and to support Haiti in the long term. \r\nFinancial aid from the international community will \r\nfacilitate the consolidation of democracy and will help \r\nus to establish the basis for sustainable development. \r\nIn order to attain those results and to strengthen its \r\ncredibility, the Government is determined to comply \r\nwith the requirements of good governance, to ease the \r\npoverty of the disadvantaged and to continue the \r\nceaseless fight against insecurity and corruption in \r\norder to facilitate private national and foreign \r\ninvestment. \r\n In conclusion, I would note that the Government \r\nof Haiti is counting on the active cooperation of the \r\ninternational community to assist it in its quest for \r\npeace and socio-economic development. Throughout \r\nthe general debate and listening to the statements made \r\nby our many friends from CARICOM, the Americas \r\nand all over the world, Haiti has been aware of the \r\nkeen desire of our partners to work side by side with \r\nHaiti in order to meet the challenges faced by our \r\nGovernment. Here, I wish to express the gratitude of \r\nthe Government of Haiti. Haiti is faced with a daunting \r\nchallenge, but there is no lack of political will. My \r\ncountry will — with our Organization and with all of \r\nus working together — attain our goals. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency, Mr. Jérémie Bonnelame, Chairman of \r\nthe delegation of the Republic of Seychelles. \r\n Mr. Bonnelame (Seychelles) (spoke in French): I \r\nwish to begin by extending my congratulations to \r\nMs. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa on her election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \r\nsession. I also express my country’s high regard for her \r\npredecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, who succeeded in \r\nspurring the implementation of United Nations reform.  \r\n I also pay tribute to the Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Kofi Annan, for his work at the head of our \r\nOrganization, as reflected in the body of his \r\nachievements at the end of his two terms of office. \r\nThose achievements include the ongoing reform, the \r\npromotion of multilateralism, the prevention of armed \r\nconflict, peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance \r\noperations, the fight against HIV/AIDS and action on \r\nother fronts, in particular in combating poverty and \r\nterrorism. \r\n Here I would like to briefly discuss United \r\nNations reform. I echo the sentiments of all who have \r\nreferred here to the pressing need for the United \r\nNations to adapt to the realities of the world in which \r\nwe live so that it will be more in tune with current \r\nconcerns and managed in an effective and transparent \r\nmanner: an Organization whose Charter recognizes that \r\nall States, small and large, possess the right to have \r\ntheir say in the conduct of affairs that are of interest to \r\nthe international community.  \r\n Seychelles thus supported the establishment of \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, the adoption of the United Nations Global \r\nCounter-Terrorism Strategy and the resolution on \r\ndevelopment. We await with great interest the outcome \r\nof the ongoing reform of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil and the Secretariat and its management, and of \r\nthe revitalization of the General Assembly in keeping \r\nwith its great authority and enhanced role.  \r\n We hope that the General Assembly will take an \r\nactive part in the appointment of the next Secretary-\r\nGeneral, who, we all agree, should be from Asia and \r\nwith proven qualities and demonstrated leadership. \r\nMoreover, the reform of the Security Council is of \r\nparticular importance in the light of the current \r\nchallenges to world peace and to the Council’s \r\ninstitutional legitimacy.  \r\n Now, let me say a few words on the national \r\npolicy of Seychelles. My country recently held \r\nelections in a climate of tranquillity and social \r\nharmony. Following the election of President Michel, \r\nand on the basis of the new road map that he has drawn \r\nfor his administration, Seychelles will place even \r\ngreater emphasis on ensuring sustainable development \r\nin all sectors: economic, social, cultural and \r\nenvironmental. The policies seek to guarantee the best \r\npossible standard of living for all citizens.  \r\n Opening up the economy, respecting human \r\nrights and the rule of law and pursuing the objectives \r\nof good governance will continue to define the actions \r\nof our Government. However, we must note that, as the \r\nWorld Bank and the Commonwealth have highlighted \r\nin their joint report, over the past five years small \r\ndeveloping States have seen gross national product \r\ngrowth rates decline in comparison to those of large, \r\nlow-income and middle-income countries. Small States \r\nhave also experienced an increasingly burdensome \r\nforeign debt. Concerning access to foreign capital, \r\nthere is a trend in private markets to consider small \r\n A/61/PV.23\r\n \r\n9 06-53958 \r\n \r\nStates to be of high risk, which leads to increased costs \r\nthat complicate access to those markets. \r\n In recent years, meetings have been held, \r\nresolutions have been adopted and statements have \r\nbeen made followed by further meetings, but with little \r\nconcrete action and without any satisfactory response \r\nto our concerns. Seychelles regrets that. The global \r\ncommunity is made up of 192 States, and more than 80 \r\nof them are small States. \r\n Confronted by these structural development \r\nproblems in the context of a globalized economy, small \r\nStates rarely have the means and the capacity to \r\nrespond appropriately to them. In that connection, the \r\nappeal made by the President of the General Assembly \r\nfor a global development partnership has never been so \r\nurgent and critical. The Seychelles hopes that at its \r\nsixty-first session the Assembly will take a decisive \r\nstep forward in bringing about such a partnership. \r\n I should like to conclude my statement by \r\nreferring to the issues of regional and world peace. \r\nArmed conflicts are occurring at a pace that shows \r\nthat, contrary to our hopes, the world remains unstable \r\nand dangerous. Unfortunately, peace and ceasefire \r\nagreements do not always lead to a cessation of \r\nhostilities. Civilian populations, composed mostly of \r\nwomen and children, continue to be displaced, \r\nmaltreated and, too often, the victims of crimes and \r\nmassacres. The situation in Darfur is the most tragic \r\nillustration. Those who survive do not always have \r\naccess to humanitarian aid. Today, according to a \r\nUnited Nations report, even the level of violence facing \r\nhumanitarian aid teams is unprecedented.  \r\n We are all aware of the real causes of wars. Sadly, \r\nsometimes the only way to reach a consensus is to say \r\nnothing; as the saying goes, diplomacy consists of \r\nconversations between friends, and only rarely with the \r\nenemy. That is why the Seychelles joins all those in \r\nAfrica, the Middle East, Asia and everywhere else who \r\nhope for a more human, more just and freer world \r\nwhere peace is the rule, not the exception, and not a \r\nprivilege but a right. That also applies to those \r\ncountries — such as Palestine and Western Sahara — \r\nthat hope someday to be able to conduct their affairs as \r\nthey see fit, in accordance with the relevant United \r\nNations resolutions. \r\n Finally, I should like to reaffirm the support of \r\nthe Seychelles for the work undertaken by the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly to make the sixty-\r\nfirst session an instrument for peace and development. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Enele Sosene Sopoaga, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of Tuvalu. \r\n Mr. Sopoaga (Tuvalu): Everything has been said; \r\neverything has been noted. But while it may be true \r\nthat many boats will rise with the tide, others are \r\nbound to sink unless goodwill prevails in this house. \r\nTuvalu wishes to add its voice of solidarity to the work \r\nof the United Nations and to what has been a highly \r\nenlightening debate. \r\n First, we join wholeheartedly in the high \r\ncommendations already expressed with regard to the \r\nelection of Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed \r\nAl-Khalifa as President of the General Assembly and \r\nher Bureau, and the sterling efforts of the outgoing \r\nPresident. Ms. Al-Khalifa and her Bureau have our full \r\ncooperation. We also wish to join others before us in \r\npaying tribute to the work of the Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Kofi Annan. His initiatives on development, \r\nsecurity and human rights have taken the United \r\nNations ever closer to all peoples and have made the \r\nOrganization accessible even to small island States \r\nsuch as Tuvalu. In appreciation, we wish him well and \r\nall the best in the future. \r\n For my small island nation, joining the United \r\nNations at the dawn of the new century is an \r\nexpression of hope. Our hope is that, through the noble \r\nideals and principles of this great body, Tuvalu, despite \r\nits physical remoteness and insignificance, will be \r\nallowed to paddle its canoe in harmony along with \r\nsuper-tankers and to share the common future of a \r\nworld of larger freedom: a world in which every State, \r\nregardless of its size, is recognized in terms of its \r\nsovereignty, its independence and the human rights of \r\nits people. \r\n We continue to hold fast to that hope. But, in the \r\npresent world of interdependence, where great \r\nopportunities are accompanied by great challenges, the \r\nneed for collective action and multilateral cooperation \r\nhas never been so pressing and urgent. Victory over \r\nthose challenges can be won not through political \r\nfragmentation, finger-pointing and confrontation, but \r\nthrough cooperation. \r\n The showdown of words engaged in by some \r\ncountries in this Chamber is unfortunate. We must \r\nA/61/PV.23  \r\n \r\n06-53958 10 \r\n \r\nnever forget that along with wealth and power comes \r\nresponsibility towards others. The risk is high that this \r\nHouse of humanity will fall apart for lack of \r\nresponsibility and leadership. There is a call for \r\neveryone to consistently display the highest degree of \r\nmorality, solidarity and respect for one other’s values \r\nand concerns. Otherwise, the ideals of the United \r\nNations cannot be served. As a small, peace-loving \r\nnation, Tuvalu strongly believes that engaging in open \r\ndialogue and working together in a spirit of mutual \r\nunderstanding within United Nations frameworks is the \r\nonly way to reach our shared destiny in diversity and \r\nwith respect for one another. \r\n Tuvalu takes pride in having been part of the \r\nUnited Nations during the negotiations on its reform \r\nand development agenda. The adoption and \r\nestablishment of the Human Rights Council and the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and of major innovations in \r\nthe Secretariat show the benefit of working together. \r\nThose bodies must be supported to ensure peace and \r\nthe protection of the human rights of all peoples and \r\ncommunities. But our work will remain unfinished \r\nuntil we make the Security Council and its operational \r\nmethodologies truly representative of the United \r\nNations membership. To that end, we support the draft \r\nresolution of the Group of Four countries on expansion \r\nof the Security Council. \r\n The President returned to the Chair. \r\n Development, security and human rights are the \r\ncardinal purposes of the United Nations. The fulfilment \r\nof those purposes demands that we shoulder our \r\ncollective responsibility and engage in united action. \r\nThe successful conclusion of the World Summit last \r\nyear was a reaffirmation of our resolve to fight poverty \r\nand ensure sustainable development through the \r\ninternationally agreed Millennium Development Goals, \r\nthe Johannesburg Plan of Implementation and the \r\nMauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of \r\nthe Programme of Action for the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States. \r\n But devising plans without having access to \r\nadequate resources is akin to presenting a menu to \r\nhungry people: it may be mouth-watering, but without \r\nthe necessary ingredients, the dishes it describes will \r\nremain unattainable. It is essential that we fully \r\nimplement the Mauritius Strategy by integrating it into \r\nthe work programmes of the Commission on \r\nSustainable Development, United Nations agencies, \r\nconventions — especially the Rio Conventions — and \r\nbilateral cooperation partners. Additionally, the \r\nstrengthening of the coordination capacity of the \r\nDepartment of Social and Economic Affairs with \r\nadequate resources in those areas is imperative. \r\n Two weeks ago, in this very Hall, the General \r\nAssembly undertook the midterm review of the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action for the Least Developed \r\nCountries. We, as both a least developed country and a \r\nsmall island developing State, are grateful to the High \r\nRepresentative for the Least Developed Countries, \r\nLandlocked Developing Countries and Small Island \r\nDeveloping States for his dedicated work, and to the \r\ndevelopment partners for the support Tuvalu has \r\nenjoyed over the years. \r\n It is certainly our view, however, that it is \r\nunrealistic and premature to list for graduation Tuvalu \r\nand our Pacific least developed country colleagues that \r\nare also small island developing States. We feel \r\nstrongly that, before any graduation can be \r\nrecommended, thorough consideration should be given \r\nto our unique economic vulnerabilities and that this \r\nshould be done on an in-country basis, not merely \r\nthrough data analysis carried out at a desk halfway \r\naround the globe. For these very reasons, and with a \r\nview to the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, there is a critical need to ensure a \r\nUnited Nations presence in all Pacific small island \r\ndeveloping States. \r\n Last month a new Government was elected to \r\npower in Tuvalu and has pledged good governance and \r\nmedia freedom as its guiding principles. It has adopted \r\nthe Tuvalu Sustainable Development Strategy, known \r\nas “Te Kakeega II: Vision 2015”, as its framework for \r\ndevelopment partnerships and looks forward to \r\nworking with the rest of the world in its \r\nimplementation. \r\n Security challenges continue to create havoc, fear \r\nand uncertainty worldwide. Tuvalu strongly deplores \r\nterrorism in all its forms and expressions. We in the \r\nPacific are not immune from acts of terrorism. We must \r\ntherefore collectively continue to make the strongest \r\nefforts in our campaign against these forces and be \r\nresolute in ensuring effective global anti-terrorism \r\naction. \r\n We also encourage the continuing role of the \r\nUnited Nations in working towards a solution to the \r\nPalestinian question and in ensuring peace for the \r\n A/61/PV.23\r\n \r\n11 06-53958 \r\n \r\npeople of Afghanistan, Darfur, Timor-Leste and other \r\nregions. \r\n Clearly the United Nations has done well in \r\npreventing and resolving deadly conflicts throughout \r\nthe world. But despite those achievements, the non-\r\nrepresentation of Taiwan in the United Nations and its \r\nagencies remains an issue of great concern. The threats \r\nposed by China’s deployment of missiles aimed at \r\nTaiwan and the use of force in the Taiwan Strait are \r\nreal, for the East Asian and Pacific region and for the \r\nworld as a whole. We urge that immediate peaceful and \r\npreventive actions be taken in the Taiwan Strait for the \r\nsake of all. \r\n No other challenge to global security is more \r\nserious and threatening than the impact of climate \r\nchange. Climate change is a global problem and can be \r\nresolved only through global collective action. \r\nAddressing climate change must therefore must be \r\nplaced at the centre of the work of the United Nations. \r\nAs is well known, small island developing States like \r\nTuvalu are extremely vulnerable to the impact of \r\nclimate change and sea-level rise, and already evidence \r\nof devastation is prevalent in all regions of the small \r\nisland developing States. Over the past few years, \r\nTuvalu has witnessed unusual flooding of the main \r\nislands with seawater and king tides, as well as severe \r\nattacks on fresh water, vegetation, foreshores and coral \r\nreefs. \r\n We are frightened and very worried by all these \r\nthings, which are the result of the actions of others. If \r\nnothing is done urgently and we are forced out of our \r\nislands, there is no other Tuvalu to which to move. \r\nThere is still time to act. Once again we appeal to this \r\nbody for help and for real action. \r\n We strongly believe that we have reached a \r\ndangerous level of greenhouse gas concentrations in \r\nthe atmosphere and that urgent action is required to \r\naccelerate the necessary responses. The options are \r\navailable; what is clearly lacking is political will. \r\nUnless climate change is addressed, all our efforts for \r\ndevelopment, security and protection of human rights \r\nwill be severely undermined. \r\n Clearly it is urgent that the international \r\ncommunity take more aggressive action to reduce \r\ngreenhouse gases. All countries, industrialized and \r\ndeveloping, must do their part, with the industrialized \r\ncountries taking the lead, including through the full \r\nimplementation of the Kyoto Protocol. \r\n To help developing countries contribute in a \r\ncommitted way, we need stronger incentives to \r\npromote the development and distribution of renewable \r\nenergy and energy efficiency technologies. We need a \r\nglobal fund to support such efforts. \r\n It is disappointing to see some large \r\nindustrialized countries’ continued denial and the \r\nabsence of enough political will on their part to support \r\nvulnerable countries such as small island developing \r\nStates to adapt to the impacts of climate change. We \r\nmust recognize the “polluter pays” principle and ensure \r\nthat the countries that are producing the greenhouse \r\ngas emissions pay for the damage they are causing to \r\nthe vulnerable countries. \r\n There is also a need to generate considerably \r\nmore funds to underwrite the costs of adaptation, \r\nincluding international levies to generate income to \r\nboost funding for adaptation and insurance in small \r\nisland developing States. The mainstreaming of the \r\nMauritius Strategy into the work of the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change, as \r\nrequired under resolution 59/311, is crucial in that \r\nregard. \r\n Defining the way forward with respect to future \r\ncommitments and actions in the area of climate change \r\nwill require strong political will on the part of all \r\ncountries. The upcoming twelfth session of the \r\nConference of the Parties to the Climate Change \r\nConvention and the second meeting of the Parties to \r\nthe Kyoto Protocol, to be held in Nairobi, must come \r\nup with clear and practical timetables for accelerated \r\naction on mitigation and adaptation. It is imperative \r\nalso to improve access by small island developing \r\nStates and least developed countries to Global \r\nEnvironment Facility climate-change resources and \r\nconvention-related funds. The Nairobi meetings must \r\nalso decide on governance and management \r\narrangements for the Kyoto Protocol Adaptation Fund \r\nto facilitate its early operation. \r\n Finally, we strongly believe that the General \r\nAssembly should host, as soon as possible, a summit at \r\nthe level of heads of Government aimed at bringing \r\nforward workable proposals with strong, high-level \r\npolitical endorsement so as to address climate change \r\nbeyond the year 2012. \r\n Our call for urgent action on climate change is \r\nnot self-serving. Tuvalu and the small island \r\ndeveloping States may be the first to suffer from the \r\nA/61/PV.23  \r\n \r\n06-53958 12 \r\n \r\nimpacts of climate change, but the consequences of not \r\ntaking real action now will be felt by all around the \r\nglobe. We all must work together on climate change in \r\na spirit of strong solidarity. \r\n The people of Tuvalu have full confidence in the \r\nUnited Nations and in its ability to ensure the \r\nachievement by all peoples of its cardinal purposes of \r\ndevelopment, security and human rights. It cannot fail \r\nthe world on climate change; it cannot dash our hopes. \r\nPlease do not let Tuvalu sink. \r\n God bless the United Nations family. God bless \r\nTuvalu.  \r\n The President: I give the floor to Mr. Phesheya \r\nMbongeyi Dlamini, chairman of the delegation of \r\nSwaziland. \r\n Mr. Dlamini (Swaziland): It is a great honour \r\nand privilege for me to deliver this important statement \r\non behalf of the delegation of the Kingdom of \r\nSwaziland. Allow me to convey the warm greetings \r\nand best wishes of His Majesty King Mswati III, Her \r\nMajesty the Queen Mother, the Government and the \r\npeople of the Kingdom of Swaziland to the whole \r\nUnited Nations family. \r\n The Kingdom of Swaziland warmly congratulates \r\nyou, Madam, on your historic election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \r\nsession. We are confident that your wide experience \r\nand proven legal and diplomatic skills will ensure \r\nsuccess in addressing the challenging and daunting \r\nissues that face the Assembly at this session. We would \r\nalso like to commend the excellent work of your \r\npredecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Sweden, in particular for his skilful \r\nleadership and the great effort he put into directing the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its previous session. \r\n The Kingdom of Swaziland would like to pay \r\nspecial tribute to Mr. Kofi Annan for his outstanding \r\nwork during his tenure as our Secretary-General. \r\nThrough his untiring and dedicated efforts, he \r\ndemonstrated the vision and qualities that saw him \r\nsuccessfully lead our Organization into the twenty-first \r\ncentury, despite the daunting challenges that the \r\nOrganization faced. We also commend him for his \r\ninitiatives in contributing to the economic and social \r\ndevelopment of the African continent through the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\n The Kingdom of Swaziland is delighted to extend \r\na warm welcome to our Organization’s newest \r\nMember, the Republic of Montenegro, whose accession \r\nis a further confirmation of respect for the principles of \r\nuniversality and representation enshrined in the Charter \r\nof the United Nations.  \r\n However, as we welcome our new Member, we \r\nremain conscious of the fact that the principle of \r\nuniversality has not been applied to its fullest. I am \r\nreferring to the exclusion of Taiwan. With the \r\nadmission of Montenegro, almost all the countries of \r\nthe world have become Members of this global \r\nOrganization, all except one — Taiwan. The exclusion \r\nof this nation poses a legal and a moral challenge to the \r\ninternational community. The time has come for the \r\nUnited Nations to stop enforcing a policy of exclusion \r\nagainst the 23.6 million people of Taiwan. The \r\nKingdom of Swaziland believes that accepting Taiwan \r\nas a member of the United Nations would not only \r\nrestore the rights of the people of that island but would \r\nalso contribute to ensuring that peace and stability is \r\nmaintained in the Taiwan Strait. We believe that every \r\ncountry in that region should be allowed to participate \r\nin working towards peace, stability and positive \r\ndevelopment. We propose, therefore, that General \r\nAssembly resolution 2758 (XXVI) of 1971 be \r\nreviewed carefully, with a view to restoring the legal \r\nand moral rights of the people of Taiwan to be part of \r\nthe United Nations family. \r\n The Kingdom of Swaziland joins the world in \r\ncondemning terrorism and threats to international \r\npeace and security. We condemn all acts of terrorism \r\nthat have taken place over the past year and we offer \r\nour sympathies and prayers to all those who were \r\naffected by such acts, especially the families and \r\nfriends of those who lost their lives. The world has, in \r\nrecent times, seen an upsurge of terrorism on an \r\nunprecedented level. \r\n We welcome the recent agreement on a counter-\r\nterrorism strategy, which demonstrates the commitment \r\nof the international community to overcome the \r\nscourge of terrorism. It must be borne in mind that all \r\nStates, large and small, and in every region, are \r\nvulnerable and could be affected by terrorism. \r\nTherefore, all Member States have to ensure that the \r\nstrategy is implemented and further updated in order to \r\nconfront the evolving challenges. \r\n A/61/PV.23\r\n \r\n13 06-53958 \r\n \r\n We fully support the African Nuclear-Weapon-\r\nFree Zone Treaty and call for the elimination of all \r\nnuclear weapons by those States that possess them. As \r\npart of our commitment to a peaceful world, we \r\nsupport the efforts of the Conference on Disarmament \r\nconcerning the prohibition of the development and \r\nmanufacture of new types of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction. We also continue to be part of the \r\ncampaign against the trafficking, sale and distribution \r\nof small arms and light weapons. Such weapons \r\nencourage terrorism on an international as well as on \r\nan individual level. \r\n The Kingdom of Swaziland welcomes the \r\nestablishment of the Peacebuilding Commission, and \r\nwe look forward to the realization of the goals \r\nenvisaged in the formation of that body. We are also \r\nproud to congratulate a sister State, the Republic of \r\nAngola, on her election to be the first to preside over \r\nthis important and unique Commission. \r\n The recent tragic events that took place in \r\nLebanon and northern Israel are a cause for great \r\nconcern and a challenge to the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission. The Kingdom of Swaziland stands firmly \r\nbehind the collective effort of the international \r\ncommunity to ensure the implementation of the \r\nSecurity Council resolution that ended the conflict \r\nbetween Israel and Hizbollah. We are of the view that a \r\ncomprehensive peace process must be revived as a \r\nmatter of urgency. \r\n While we are especially encouraged by the \r\ndevelopments towards peace on the African continent, \r\nwe remain concerned about the worsening security \r\nsituation in Darfur in western Sudan, where thousands \r\nof people have been killed and more than 2 million \r\ndisplaced since the conflict erupted in 2003. We urge \r\nthe parties concerned to demonstrate a spirit of \r\nnecessary compromise and to cooperate with efforts \r\nmade to facilitate the search for peaceful and lasting \r\nsolutions. The Kingdom of Swaziland supports \r\nunequivocally every effort that is being made to sustain \r\npeace in this area. We join our fellow Member States in \r\ncalling for support from the United Nations. We fully \r\nhope and expect that commitments in words will be \r\nfollowed up by deeds. \r\n We welcome the results of the historic first-round \r\nelections that took place in the Democratic Republic of \r\nCongo, the first of its kind in 40 years. These elections \r\nwere the first crucial step towards the recovery of that \r\ncountry, and we support every effort by the United \r\nNations and the international community to consolidate \r\nthis achievement, bearing in mind that it will make a \r\ndifference not only to the Democratic Republic of \r\nCongo but to the African continent as a whole. \r\n The recently established Human Rights Council \r\nhas just concluded a successful inaugural session. The \r\nKingdom of Swaziland welcomes the creation of this \r\nhistoric new body. The creation of the Council was \r\nindeed a step in the right direction towards \r\nstrengthening our Organization’s human rights tools. \r\nWe believe that the work of the Council will be guided \r\nby the principles of universality, impartiality, \r\nobjectivity, non-selectivity, international dialogue and \r\ncooperation. In this regard, we align ourselves with the \r\nrest of Africa in supporting a less-politicized body that \r\nwill respond promptly to cases of human rights abuses \r\nin any part of the world. \r\n The Kingdom of Swaziland believes that the \r\nongoing reforms of the United Nations are essential, \r\nespecially if the Organization is to retain its global \r\ncredibility. It is therefore our hope that the many key \r\nreform proposals that were deferred to this session will \r\nbe dealt with satisfactorily. Meanwhile, we welcome \r\nthe progress that has been made so far, including the \r\nestablishment of a United Nations Ethics Office, the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. \r\n Neither renewal nor reform would be complete \r\nwithout the reform of the Security Council. In the quest \r\nfor an overall agreement on this issue, the Kingdom of \r\nSwaziland supports the position of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement and the African Group concerning the \r\ncomposition and working methods of the Security \r\nCouncil. We hope and expect that positive results will \r\nflow from the conclusion of this matter. \r\n As a Member State of this body, we recognize the \r\nvital role that the major United Nations conferences \r\nand summits have played in identifying commonly \r\nagreed objectives which should lead to the successful \r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). However, we do realize that nothing can be \r\nachieved without adequate funding, especially for \r\ndeveloping nations. Even though promises have been \r\nmade, the time has come for them to be translated into \r\nactions. \r\n The breakdown and suspension of negotiations of \r\nthe World Trade Organization’s Doha Round is \r\nA/61/PV.23  \r\n \r\n06-53958 14 \r\n \r\nlamentable. However, insofar as the outcome is \r\nconcerned, the Kingdom of Swaziland believes that the \r\nneeds of developing nations must be fully taken into \r\nconsideration. Failure to do so will undermine the \r\nalready limited trade opportunities of these nations and \r\ndetract from the pursuit of policies in key areas, such \r\nas employment, industrialization, food security, rural \r\ndevelopment and sustained economic growth. \r\n While we welcome the relevant ideas and general \r\nprinciples for designing microeconomic, sectoral and \r\ntrade policies contained in the United Nations \r\nConference on Trade and Development’s Trade \r\nDevelopment Report of 2006, we still believe that the \r\nspecific needs of developing nations have to be \r\naddressed. \r\n On a more domestic note, let me report that the \r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic continues to be one of the biggest \r\nchallenges faced by the Kingdom of Swaziland. As we \r\nbegin to realize the benefits of a full-scale national \r\nroll-out of antiretroviral drugs, a critical area of \r\nconcern is the care needed by the estimated 63,000 \r\nchildren who have been orphaned by the pandemic. \r\n That is why, among many other structures we \r\nhave put in place to curb this scourge, we have revived \r\nthe concept of the “KaGogo”, which means, literally, \r\n“grandmother’s house”. These KaGogo centres are \r\nbeing constructed across the country and are a new \r\ninitiative based on traditional ways that empower local \r\ncommunities to look after their orphans within \r\ntraditional structures. During the High-level \r\nConference on HIV/AIDS held in June 2006, His \r\nMajesty King Mswati III clearly spelled out the scale \r\nof the pandemic and how it is taking its toll on our \r\nnation. It is indeed our greatest challenge. \r\n The Kingdom of Swaziland fully supports the \r\nPolitical Declaration that was adopted at the High-level \r\nConference, and we are confident that this renewed \r\ncommitment will strengthen the global response to the \r\npandemic. Thus, we realize the urgency of combining \r\nour efforts to ensure that the rate of infection decreases \r\nand that greater access to treatment and care for those \r\nwho are already living with the virus is achieved. We \r\nfully support the efforts of such organizations as the \r\nJoint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS \r\n(UNAIDS), especially in terms of minimizing the \r\nthreat of HIV to young people. We believe that that is a \r\nmoral obligation and is essential for halting the \r\nescalation of the infection rate. In this regard, we look \r\nforward to working closely with United Nations \r\nagencies in order to alleviate the situation.  \r\n On a more positive note, the Kingdom of \r\nSwaziland is now implementing the recommendations \r\nof our job creation summit, which took place last year. \r\nHis Majesty King Mswati III always stands behind his \r\npeople and fully supports the idea of the participation \r\nof the people in building the economy. For instance, he \r\nencourages them to start their own businesses as a \r\nmeans of reducing the unemployment level. However, \r\nwe still face significant challenges, e.g., market \r\nfluctuations in certain products such as sugar and \r\ntextiles. We also encourage our people to enter into \r\npartnerships and join ventures with foreign direct \r\ninvestors in order to develop our nation. \r\n In conclusion, allow me to allude to the fact that \r\nthere is indeed much vital work to be completed during \r\nthis sixty-first session of the General Assembly. The \r\nKingdom of Swaziland is confident that the initiatives \r\nalready taken will lead to the renewal of our \r\nOrganization, and we look forward to a new dynamic \r\nand vibrant working period. We are indebted to the \r\nUnited Nations for all we have received and achieved \r\nover the years towards the development of our nation. \r\n I am, therefore, charged by His Majesty The \r\nKing, Her Majesty The Queen Mother, the Government \r\nand the people of the Kingdom of Swaziland with \r\nproclaiming the renewal of our commitment to the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. We ask for God’s \r\nblessings upon those charged with leading the \r\nOrganization to give them the wisdom and direction \r\nthey require to carry out these tasks on behalf of all the \r\npeoples of the world. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to \r\nMr. Negash Kebret Botora, chairman of the delegation \r\nof Ethiopia. \r\n Mr. Kebret Botora (Ethiopia): Allow me to \r\nextend to you, Madam President, our sincere \r\ncongratulations on your assumption of the Presidency \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-first session and to \r\nexpress our full confidence in your ability to guide the \r\nsession successfully. \r\n Let me also express our appreciation to your \r\npredecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, for his leadership during \r\nthe sixtieth session. \r\n My delegation’s appreciation also goes to the \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his selfless \r\n A/61/PV.23\r\n \r\n15 06-53958 \r\n \r\ncommitment and devotion to the objectives of the \r\nUnited Nations, in general, and for his contributions, \r\nthrough various initiatives, to the efforts of reforming \r\nour Organization and for his dedication to their \r\npractical implementation, in particular. \r\n In our view, one of the key accomplishments of \r\nthe international community in recent years is the \r\nagreement on the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). It is imperative that we all commit to \r\nbuilding stronger partnerships to achieve these noble \r\ngoals and targets. In this regard, we are cognizant of \r\nthe fact that each country is responsible for its \r\ndevelopment. It should also be equally recognized that, \r\nfor those countries at the early stage of economic \r\ndevelopment, there is a need for stronger support from \r\nthe international community if they are to meet the \r\nMDGs.  \r\n For low-income countries, there is nothing more \r\nimportant than a partnership that is predictable, \r\nconsistent and based on mutual obligations defined in \r\nadvance. The long-awaited opening up of international \r\ntrade, especially through the elimination of agricultural \r\nsubsidies, should also be expedited.  \r\n On our part, we have intensified our efforts to \r\nimprove the socio-economic conditions of Ethiopia. \r\nToday, in the decade and a half since the dictatorship \r\nwas swept out of our country, our socio-economic \r\nprogress has been substantial. We have succeeded in \r\nchannelling our limited resources into capacity-\r\nbuilding and infrastructure programmes serving the \r\nentire country. We have opened up new universities \r\nand technical institutions of higher learning, expanded \r\nprimary health-care services and built roads, airports, \r\npower plants, transmission and telecommunication \r\nfacilities and services, among others. As attractive \r\nopportunities have become more apparent, domestic \r\nand foreign investment has grown. \r\n In this regard, I would like to highlight some of \r\nthe achievements recorded so far. In the past three \r\nfiscal years, the Ethiopian economy has grown by an \r\naverage of 9.5 per cent annually. Over the same period, \r\nour export trade has grown by 28.5 per cent per annum. \r\nOur primary school enrolment ratio has increased to 89 \r\nper cent from a mere 30 per cent in the early 1990s. In \r\norder to strengthen our capacity for development, we \r\nare building 13 public universities. In two to three \r\nyears, when these universities are fully operational, the \r\ntotal annual intake of public universities would \r\nincrease from the current 30,000 to 150,000 students. \r\nSimilar results have also been achieved in the health \r\nsector, where the Government is equally determined to \r\nenable rural people in Ethiopia to have adequate access \r\nto basic health care by 2010. \r\n Benefiting from the encouraging results of the \r\nfirst five year plan and the experience gained in its \r\nimplementation, the second five year plan, namely, the \r\nProgramme for Accelerated and Sustained \r\nDevelopment to End Poverty, was drawn up on a much \r\nwider and enhanced scale. The main objective of this \r\nlatest plan is to alleviate poverty by ensuring food \r\nsecurity and meeting the MDGs. \r\n As it carries out its development agenda, Ethiopia \r\nstrongly believes that the prevalence of peace and \r\nsecurity in the country and its region is an absolute \r\nnecessity. For this reason, Ethiopia will not allow its \r\ndispute with Eritrea to distract it from its focus on \r\ndevelopment, although that has been the main objective \r\nof Eritrea since the conflict began eight years ago. For \r\nthe last four years, Eritrea has been blaming Ethiopia \r\nfor its own aggression against us and for the current \r\nstalemate in the peace and demarcation process. In \r\nfact, now, the whole world is being blamed for \r\nEritrea’s own failure and for its inability to behave like \r\na normal State. \r\n For the benefit of this Assembly, it would be \r\nfitting to place the conflict in the proper context and \r\nperspective for a better appreciation of the current \r\nimpasse in the peace process. It should be recalled that \r\nEritrea launched an unprovoked attack against Ethiopia \r\nin May 1998 in blatant disregard of international law, \r\nthereby igniting the war and leading to the present \r\ncrisis. In this respect, I wish to draw the Assembly’s \r\nattention to the decision of the Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims \r\nCommission regarding issues of liability in the war \r\nbetween the two countries.  \r\n In its decision, the Commission set forth, inter \r\nalia, the following conclusions. First, Eritrea is liable \r\nfor committing unprovoked aggression against \r\nEthiopia. The Commission stated that Eritrea violated \r\nArticle 2, paragraph 4, of the Charter of the United \r\nNations on 12 May 1998 and the days immediately \r\nfollowing when it resorted to armed force in attacking \r\nand occupying areas peacefully administered by \r\nEthiopia. Secondly, Eritrea is liable to compensate \r\nEthiopia for the damages caused by that violation of \r\ninternational law. Thirdly, the Commission rejected \r\nA/61/PV.23  \r\n \r\n06-53958 16 \r\n \r\nEritrea’s argument that its recourse to force was \r\njustified, because some of the territory question was \r\nterritory to which Eritrea had a claim. \r\n The Commission’s decision shows not only \r\nEritrea’s warped understanding of international law but \r\nunambiguously confirms that Eritrea’s illegal act \r\nconstituted aggression. \r\n Before Eritrea launched its aggression and during \r\nthe war and after, Ethiopia has shown its strong desire \r\nand willingness to resolve the conflict with Eritrea by \r\npeaceful means. It should be recalled that, in order to \r\ncreate conditions for a sustainable peace and in order \r\nto re-establish all-around cooperation between the two \r\ncountries, Ethiopia presented a five-point peace plan, \r\nwhich the international community, including the \r\nSecurity Council, had welcomed. However, the \r\nproposal was flatly rejected by Eritrea.  \r\n We have also cooperated fully with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s Special Envoy. Furthermore, Ethiopia has \r\nwelcomed the peace initiative presented by the \r\nWitnesses to the Algiers Agreement, which is \r\nsupported by the Security Council and made the \r\nfollowing proposals. The current impasse should be \r\nresolved with the assistance of a neutral facilitator in \r\nthe demarcation process. Freedom of operations by the \r\nUnited Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea \r\n(UNMEE) should be restored, together with the \r\nsanctity of the Temporary Security Zone. The threat or \r\nuse of force should be eliminated. There should be \r\nnormalization of relations between the two countries. \r\nIn this connection, I would like to assure the \r\ninternational community that we shall continue to \r\npersevere in our search for a lasting peace. \r\n Ethiopia has on various occasions expressed its \r\nreadiness to demarcate the boundary, through dialogue, \r\nin accordance with the decision of the Boundary \r\nCommission, and has attended in good faith the \r\nmeetings convened by the Commission. It has also \r\nreaffirmed its readiness to normalize its relations with \r\nEritrea. Ethiopia has done so not because it is desperate \r\nfor closer relations with Eritrea, but rather because \r\nnormalization is critical for durable peace. But Eritrea \r\nwill have none of this. Why? Because Eritrea’s \r\nstrategic goal is neither peace nor a peaceful common \r\nboundary. What it wants is interminable boundary \r\nproblems with Ethiopia.  \r\n The latest report of the Secretary-General on \r\nEthiopia and Eritrea, of 19 September (S/2006/749), \r\nand the report of the Boundary Commission annexed to \r\nit clearly indicate that the Commission’s June and \r\nAugust meetings were cancelled because Eritrea \r\nrefused to attend. Eritrea has also issued ultimatums as \r\na condition for its cooperation with the Boundary \r\nCommission. I wish to underline here that Eritrea has \r\nno reason to be frustrated by the lack of the speedy \r\nimplementation of demarcation. Eritrea is the reason \r\nwhy the boundary between the two countries has still \r\nnot been demarcated. \r\n Eritrea’s illegal and anti-peace stance is not \r\nlimited to issuing ultimatums. It has blatantly violated \r\nthe Algiers Agreement by threatening the use of force \r\nand has violated the integrity of the Temporary \r\nSecurity Zone by deploying its armed forces there. It \r\nhas tightened its blatant restrictions on the United \r\nNations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) and \r\nits personnel. The Secretary-General has reported time \r\nand again that Eritrea has not only prohibited the \r\nMission from carrying out its mandated tasks, but also \r\nengaged in a series of arrests and detentions of its \r\npersonnel. Those are naked violations of the Algiers \r\nAgreement, Security Council resolutions and the \r\nCharter. \r\n The way forward to break the current impasse in \r\nthe peace process is very clear. Eritrea needs to abide \r\nby the relevant Security Council resolutions and the \r\nAlgiers Agreement, withdraw its armed forces from the \r\nTemporary Security Zone and restore the Zone’s \r\nintegrity and UNMEE’s freedom of operation. It must \r\ndemonstrate its compliance with article 1 of the \r\nDecember 2000 Agreement by renouncing the use of \r\nforce to resolve the dispute between the two countries. \r\nIt should cooperate with the international community \r\nin its efforts aimed at resolving the dispute peacefully \r\nand through dialogue. Only when Eritrea decides to \r\ncooperate with those legal measures will we be able to \r\nbegin to resolve the dispute in accordance with \r\ninternational law.  \r\n Eritrea should behave as a responsible State and \r\nresolve any dispute through diplomatic means. Eritrea \r\nmust understand that that is its only option. Its \r\ncontinued, dangerous tactic of using brinkmanship \r\nagainst many actors in the international community is \r\nnot acceptable. \r\n Ethiopia shares a border of more than 2,000 \r\nkilometres with neighbouring Somalia and is home to \r\nabout 3.5 million Ethiopian Somalis. It is in the \r\n A/61/PV.23\r\n \r\n17 06-53958 \r\n \r\ninterests of Ethiopia that peace, stability and national \r\nharmony prevail in that country. It is precisely for that \r\nreason that we have spared no effort over the past 15 \r\nyears — working together with partners in the Inter-\r\nGovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and \r\nthe African Union (AU) — to help the Somalis to \r\nachieve peace and national reconciliation.  \r\n The Transitional Federal Government of Somalia \r\nis the product of the efforts made by Somalis \r\nthemselves, with the support of IGAD countries, the \r\nAU and the international community in general. That \r\nGovernment is now facing a major challenge from \r\nthose who have ambitions that have nothing to do with \r\nSomalia but everything to do with chaos, instability \r\nand terror. The international community would do itself \r\na great disservice if it failed to appreciate the \r\nimplications of what is currently happening in Somalia \r\nand did not respond in an appropriate manner.  \r\n Somalia is being dragged into the abyss by those \r\nwho are using religion as a cover to deny the people of \r\nSomalia peace and the opportunity to revive a nation \r\nthat has been in a state of collapse for 15 years now, \r\nmaking it possible for those who have no interest in \r\npeace and stability to thrive. The latest opportunistic \r\nmove in this regard was made by Eritrea, but it is \r\nbound to fail. IGAD and the AU are asking for political \r\nand diplomatic support so that the Transitional Federal \r\nGovernment can be in a position to contain those who \r\nare the agents not of love, but of disharmony — not of \r\npeace, but of war. That is not too much to ask of the \r\ninternational community.  \r\n Only when the Transitional Federal Government \r\nis in a position to protect itself from the internal and \r\nexternal enemies of peace will dialogue provide a \r\nsolution to the crisis in Somalia — a crisis that the \r\nextremists within the Islamic Courts Union hope will \r\nengulf the whole region. It is precisely for that reason \r\nthat the partial lifting of the arms embargo is so \r\ncritical. There are those who want to wish away the \r\ndanger in Somalia. There are, on the other hand, those \r\nwho want to benefit from the danger. It is obvious that \r\nthe latter group, to which Eritrea belongs, is taking \r\nadvantage of the naivety of the former. \r\n There should be no doubt that Ethiopia will \r\ncontinue to be a pillar of peace and stability in the \r\nHorn of Africa. That is Ethiopia’s vocation, whether \r\nwith respect to the problem in Somalia or in connection \r\nwith the difficulty we have in ensuring that Eritrea \r\nchooses the peaceful path. Resort to force is never a \r\nbasis for sustainable peace. That is the philosophy that \r\nunderpins our policy towards Eritrea and towards the \r\ncrisis in Somalia. There is no better guarantee for \r\npeace and stability than the nurturing of mutual \r\nconfidence and trust, regardless of differences in \r\noutlook or in political or other values. This also \r\nexplains Ethiopia’s legendary commitment to the \r\nUnited Nations and to its principles and purposes. As I \r\nconclude, therefore, I would like to reaffirm Ethiopia’s \r\ndevotion to the United Nations and to the values of \r\ninterdependence, which the Organization embodies. \r\n The President: I give the floor to His Excellency \r\nMr. Martin Belinga-Eboutou, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of Cameroon. \r\n Mr. Belinga-Eboutou (Cameroon) (spoke in \r\nFrench): I should like, on behalf of my delegation, to \r\nsay how delighted we are to see you, Madam, the \r\nrepresentative of the Kingdom of Bahrain, a friendly \r\ncountry, presiding over the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-first session. I would like to assure you of our \r\nsincere wishes for your success. You can rest assured \r\nthat my delegation will fully cooperate with you. \r\n I would also like to pay tribute to the Kingdom of \r\nSweden, a friendly country whose Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs, Mr. Jan Eliasson, presided over the General \r\nAssembly at its sixtieth session in such an outstanding \r\nmanner. Major progress was made during that session. \r\n Finally, I should like to extend to Montenegro a \r\nwarm welcome to the family of the peoples of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n This session of the General Assembly is taking \r\nplace at a time when the world is once again facing \r\nmajor challenges. I am thinking in particular of the \r\nupsurge of terrorism, which threatens the security of \r\nStates and our collective security. I am also thinking of \r\nthe persistence of underdevelopment and the almost \r\nendemic poverty in the countries of the South. I am \r\nthinking, too, of pandemics of all kinds, including \r\nHIV/AIDS. Finally, I am thinking of cross-border \r\norganized crime. \r\n Our world and our Organization need more \r\ngenerosity, more solidarity, more ethical behaviour and \r\nmore tolerance, but also more courage and more \r\nimagination to tackle these challenges, which require a \r\nglobal approach in the multilateral context in which the \r\nUnited Nations is the forum par excellence. \r\nA/61/PV.23  \r\n \r\n06-53958 18 \r\n \r\n Opinions are being expressed in various quarters \r\ndeploring the inability of the Organization to respond \r\nadequately to the fundamental aspirations of the \r\nworld’s people, while some also believe that the \r\nOrganization has become obsolete. Cameroon would \r\nlike to reaffirm that it believes that, despite the \r\ninevitable shortcomings inherent in an organization of \r\nsuch size, the United Nations is today, more than ever \r\nbefore, the only institution that can bring about \r\nconsensus in an effort to ease tension and find \r\nsolutions. Very simply put, there is no substitute for the \r\nUnited Nations in managing in a coherent manner the \r\nproblems to which I have referred. \r\n In that regard, I would like to pay special tribute \r\nto the work of Secretary-General Kofi Annan. I also \r\nwish to convey to him the gratitude of my country and \r\nmy personal regard and appreciation for his efforts. \r\nFollowing in the footsteps of his predecessors, he has \r\nreinvigorated multilateralism in an especially difficult \r\ninternational environment. Cameroon is proud to have \r\ncontributed to the election of this noble son of Africa \r\nfollowing its assumption of the chairmanship of the \r\nOrganization of Africa Unity. Today, while peace to \r\nmany seems to be but a myth, Africa is truly honoured \r\nthat Mr. Kofi Annan has taken his place among the \r\nworld’s great peacemakers. In that regard, the Noble \r\nPeace Prize awarded to him was richly deserved. \r\n In an international environment characterized by \r\ndifficulties in ensuring that the rule of law prevails \r\nover the use of force, the Secretary-General was \r\ncourageously able to promote the voice of reason. In an \r\nenvironment of heated passions, he succeeded in \r\ndelivering a message of peace and brotherhood. Allow \r\nme, by way example in that regard, to refer to his \r\nunequivocal commitment to Cameroon and Nigeria — \r\ntwo brotherly countries linked by history and \r\ngeography — in the peaceful and consensual \r\nimplementation of the International Court of Justice \r\n(ICJ) ruling of 10 October 2002 finally resolving the \r\nborder dispute between our two countries. \r\n The Greentree Agreement of 12 June 2006, \r\nimplemented following the withdrawal of all Nigerian \r\ntroops on 14 August 2006, is a credit both to the United \r\nNations and the personal commitment of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. I would like to take this opportunity to thank \r\nfriendly countries, including the Federal Republic of \r\nGermany, the United States of America, France and the \r\nUnited Kingdom. Along with the United Nations, those \r\ncountries agreed to provide their moral and political \r\nsupport to the Greentree Agreement, which defined the \r\nmodalities for the implementation of the ICJ ruling of \r\n10 October 2002 on the Bakassi Peninsula. More \r\nimportantly, they agreed to help us to implement it.  \r\n I would also like to reaffirm here and now \r\nCameroon’s solemn commitment to continue to fulfil in \r\ngood faith all its obligations emanating from the \r\nInternational Court of Justice decision and the \r\nGreentree Agreement. In particular, I would like to \r\naffirm that Nigerian nationals living in Bakassi \r\ndesiring to remain there will be treated in the same way \r\nas the 4.5 million Nigerians living in Cameroon, who \r\nare able to live their lives in peace and harmony with \r\nCameroonians. \r\n That process has taught us that true lasting peace \r\ncan never be imposed; it can only be established \r\nthrough patience and a spirit of compromise. In short, \r\nreal lasting peace can only come from genuine joint \r\npolitical will. \r\n Allow me to highlight some of the many \r\ninitiatives undertaken by the United Nations that \r\nreflect the geopolitical developments under way and \r\nthe aspirations of people around the world. In that \r\nregard, I would specifically like to refer to the \r\nMillennium Declaration, which is a genuine charter of \r\ninternational solidarity binding on all of us as an urgent \r\nobligation. In addition, the Organization’s ongoing \r\nattention to Africa is prominently reflected in the \r\nSecretary-General’s report on sustainable development \r\nand the causes of conflict in Africa, a document that \r\nwill be an ongoing source of encouragement to our \r\ncountries.  \r\n I also wish to recall that the Secretary-General \r\nlaid the foundations for the reform of the Organization, \r\nwhich was made necessary in the light of the changes \r\nthat have taken place in the world’s balance of power \r\nsince the founding of United Nations. I should \r\ntherefore now like to say a few words about what has \r\ncome to be known as United Nations reform. \r\n The Organization stands no chance of \r\nmaintaining its place in world affairs unless it \r\nsafeguards its legitimacy. In other words, it must \r\nensure that its representative character is beyond \r\nreproach. The reform we seek should therefore take \r\ninto account the development of the international \r\nsystem in the course of recent decades. Likewise, it \r\nwill no doubt be necessary to modify the role played \r\nby some organs of the United Nations system. In that \r\n A/61/PV.23\r\n \r\n19 06-53958 \r\n \r\nconnection, I am thinking in particular of the role of \r\nthe International Court of Justice. It is in everyone’s \r\ninterest that the reform be properly carried out while \r\ntaking into account today’s realities. But however \r\nreform is carried out, I believe that Africa should have \r\npermanent representation in the Security Council. That \r\nis not just a matter of justice, but also one of common \r\nsense.  \r\n In order to retain its credibility, the Organization \r\nshould resolutely continue to pursue its efforts with \r\nregard to major issues related to peace and \r\ndevelopment in the developing world. On the political \r\nlevel, special attention should be paid to the Middle \r\nEast, Darfur and the issue of nuclear proliferation. \r\nWith regard to development, the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals should be attained within a \r\nreasonable time frame.  \r\n In order to avert doubts as to the positive aspects \r\nof trade globalization, the United Nations likewise has \r\na responsibility to maintain a balance between the \r\ncountries of the North and the South in such major \r\ntrade negotiations as the now-suspended Doha Round. \r\nFailure in that regard would have disastrous \r\nconsequences for Africa.  \r\n Finally, our Organization must continue to \r\nsafeguard the cultural identity of the various peoples of \r\nthe world and to promote a dialogue among cultures \r\nand religions. The sharing of experiences and the \r\nknowledge gained through such an honest and \r\nrespectful dialogue will be the best antidote to the \r\nclash of civilizations that some predict as well as a sure \r\nalternative to terrorism and violence. \r\n Over the years, the United Nations has become a \r\ncrucial stakeholder in the international arena. I believe \r\nwe should all welcome that development because, first \r\nof all, this parliament of nations is the only forum in \r\nwhich virtually all peoples are represented and where a \r\nblueprint for international democracy is gradually \r\nbeing drafted. We should welcome it also because — \r\nand this is an important point — the systematic \r\nconsideration by our Organization of crises or tensions \r\ngives negotiation a chance and makes the use of force \r\nless likely. True, it has not just been success stories, \r\nbut I think that, broadly speaking, the balance sheet is \r\nquite positive. This should prompt us not to begrudge \r\nthe United Nations our trust and to give it means \r\ncommensurate with its ambitions, its responsibilities \r\nand the expectations we have of it.  \r\n For its part, Cameroon will continue to support \r\nall the initiatives of our Organization aimed at \r\nmaintaining peace and solidarity among peoples. I need \r\nhardly say that the human person must remain \r\nparamount among our concerns. This, inter alia, will be \r\nthe task facing the new Human Rights Council, of \r\nwhich my country is honoured to be a member. \r\n Our Organization cannot remain indifferent to the \r\ntragedy of the massive migration flows that we have \r\nbeen witnessing for some time. Clearly this situation \r\nposes a challenge not only to our States but also to the \r\nentire international community, and we must all work \r\ntogether to strengthen cooperation in this area between \r\nthe countries of the North and the countries of the \r\nSouth. \r\n I believe that, appearances to the contrary — and \r\nalthough many hotbeds of tension and threat still \r\nremain — the international community seems to be \r\nmoving towards greater stability. Credit, to a large \r\nextent, goes to the work done by the United Nations, \r\nits various organs and its staff, who are carrying out \r\ntheir responsibilities in conditions that are often \r\ndifficult, even dangerous. \r\n That is the substance of the message of Mr. Paul \r\nBiya, President of the Republic of Cameroon, to the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-first session. \r\n The President: We have heard the last speaker in \r\nthe general debate. \r\n(spoke in Arabic) \r\n The general debate of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-first session has now concluded. I thank all \r\nspeakers for their valuable contributions. \r\n The annual general debate provides a unique \r\nopportunity for world leaders to meet and exchange \r\nviews on the most pressing global issues and \r\nchallenges. While there may not be agreement on all \r\nmatters on our agenda, we share a common belief in \r\nthe merit of dialogue and international cooperation. For \r\nsuch a dialogue to be fruitful, we all agree that values \r\nsuch as mutual respect, tolerance and understanding \r\nshould guide our work and deliberations. \r\n Over the past two weeks, we have had a rich and \r\nsubstantive debate. It will not be possible for me to \r\nsummarize all the points made, but let me mention a \r\nfew issues addressed by representatives. \r\nA/61/PV.23  \r\n \r\n06-53958 20 \r\n \r\n The General Assembly is the main body and \r\nplays a key role in deliberating and making policies. It \r\nrepresents all States Members of the United Nations. \r\nThe theme of this year’s general debate was \r\n“Implementing a global partnership for development”, \r\nand I am pleased that so many heads of State and \r\nGovernment highlighted that issue in their statements. \r\n This year there was a clear message that we need \r\nto redouble our efforts to make progress towards \r\nachieving internationally agreed development goals, \r\nincluding the Millennium Development Goals, and \r\naddress the deadlock in the international trade \r\nnegotiations. Many representatives stressed the need to \r\nmove ahead to eradicate extreme poverty, particularly \r\nin the light of the trend reversals we are witnessing in \r\nAfrica. Some also underlined the need to explore \r\ncreative methods of funding the development \r\nprogrammes, including contributions from the private \r\nsector. \r\n Representatives also expressed a strong \r\ncommitment to continue the follow-up and \r\nimplementation of the reform agenda adopted at the \r\nWorld Summit last September. They commended the \r\nachievements made at the sixtieth session, including \r\nthe establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission, \r\nthe Human Rights Council and the Central Emergency \r\nResponse Fund, and they expressed their will to enable \r\nthese new organs and institutions to work effectively \r\nand live up to their potential. \r\n They reaffirmed the role of the United Nations in \r\nfighting the scourge of terrorism and welcomed the \r\nadoption of the United Nations Global Counter-\r\nTerrorism Strategy. They emphasized the need to take \r\nthis work forward, both by implementing the Strategy \r\nand by concluding negotiations on a comprehensive \r\nconvention on international terrorism. \r\n On institutional reforms, representatives made it \r\nclear that they would like to see further progress on \r\nSecretariat and management reform, including mandate \r\nreview; Security Council reform; strengthening of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council; and General Assembly \r\nrevitalization.  \r\n In addition, they expressed the wish that the \r\nUnited Nations assume a more proactive role in both \r\nthe prevention and resolution of armed conflicts. They \r\nunderlined in particular the importance of reaching a \r\njust and lasting solution to the Middle East crisis, and \r\nexpressed the absolute need to resolve the situation in \r\nDarfur. \r\n They called on the United Nations to take the \r\nlead in the prevention of ethnic cleansing, mass \r\nkillings and genocide. Furthermore, many \r\nrepresentatives stressed the need to regain momentum \r\nin our work in the areas of disarmament and nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation. \r\n Other fundamental global challenges that were \r\nraised include environmental degradation and climate \r\nchange, HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases, \r\ngender equality and education for all. Representatives \r\nalso underlined the need to promote dialogue among \r\ncivilizations in order to enhance our mutual \r\nunderstanding of each other’s cultures. \r\n Ladies and gentlemen, you have provided useful \r\ninput and guidance for our work ahead. Over the \r\ncoming days, I will carefully review the points made \r\nduring the general debate. I will continue listening to \r\nany further ideas that you may have for our programme \r\nof work. \r\n We must work together in a transparent, efficient \r\nand coherent manner in order to make the best use of \r\nour time and resources. We have to enhance trust and \r\nconfidence among ourselves with the aim of serving \r\nour common interests and achieving tangible results \r\nthat will make a difference to the lives of millions of \r\npeople around the world. \r\n Next week I will communicate my proposal on \r\nthe agenda. I look forward to constant communication \r\nand close and constructive cooperation with all of you \r\nin the year ahead. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n We have heard the last speaker in the debate for \r\nthis meeting. \r\n A number of delegations have asked to speak in \r\nexercise of the right of reply. I remind members that \r\nstatements in exercise of the right of reply are limited \r\nto 10 minutes for the first intervention, and to five \r\nminutes for the second intervention, and should be \r\nmade by delegations from their seats. \r\n Mr. Amorós Núñez (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nWe have heard a speaker making accusations against \r\nCuba, not because of any real concern for human \r\nrights, but because of his calling as a straw man, lackey \r\nand wretch. Everyone knows that all he wants to do is \r\n A/61/PV.23\r\n \r\n21 06-53958 \r\n \r\nto offer service to the powerful nation that seeks a \r\npretext to justify its illegal and cowardly \r\ninterventionist policy of aggression and blockade \r\nagainst Cuba. \r\n The Czech Republic again shows unparalleled \r\nsubmission in adopting the priorities of its master. It \r\ndemonstrates how it is currently a global satellite, \r\nhaving not only gradually assumed its role as total \r\naccomplice to its master’s abuses of power — \r\ncommitted before the very eyes of the world under the \r\npretext of a war against terrorism — but also \r\nsupporting the aggressive policy towards our small \r\ncountry. \r\n With this attempt to stigmatize Cuba, the Czech \r\nRepublic seeks in vain to overshadow Cuba’s \r\nuncompromising rebellion against the unfair \r\nimperialist world order, our unyielding defence of our \r\nindependence and sovereignty and our determination to \r\nfollow our own path, without accepting any outside \r\ninterference. It seeks to distort the deeply rooted \r\nrevolutionary process that has allowed the Cuban \r\npeople to become a stakeholder and the real master of \r\nits fate, ensuring the fullest enjoyment of all human \r\nrights by Cuban men and women, without \r\ndiscrimination of any type based on gender, colour or \r\nsocial class. \r\n The Czech Republic wants the world to forget \r\nhow Cuba was able to do away with corruption, fraud, \r\ntheft of the nation’s heritage and neglect of the \r\nhardships of the great majority suffering from hunger, \r\nilliteracy and poverty, and how it eliminated the \r\nimposition of brutal dictatorships that sought bloodily \r\nto silence our people’s just demands during most of the \r\nalmost six decades of neo-colonial government \r\ncontrolled from Washington. \r\n The Czech Government seeks to challenge the \r\nfact that no one has been able to prove that there has \r\nbeen a single extrajudicial execution or disappeared \r\nperson in Cuba since 1959, that a single Cuban mother \r\nhas been searching for the remains of her disappeared \r\nchildren, or that a single grandmother has been unable \r\nto find her grandchild who had been given to another \r\nfamily following the murder of his parents. Never in a \r\nCuban jail has a single prisoner been mistreated; nor \r\nhave they had to go down on their knees, terrified, \r\nbefore a dog trained to kill. And why does the \r\nGovernment which levels these accusations remain \r\nsilent and complicit in the torture and outrages of \r\nanother country? \r\n The Czech Government allies itself with the \r\npolicy of aggression against Cuba, thus hiding the real \r\nessence of that policy. The imperialists and their Czech \r\nlackeys see danger in the spread of the notion that it is \r\npossible to build a just society of solidarity where all \r\ncan enjoy their human rights and where there are no \r\nshady deals and massive profits for big capital at the \r\ncost of the impoverishment of the people. Everybody \r\nknows how much discrimination and exclusion exist in \r\nthe Czech society. But we are not going to dwell on \r\nthat here. Let their leaders feel the shame of not being \r\nable to do what a small country suffering under a \r\nblockade, like Cuba, has been able to do. \r\n Lastly, we want to make something clear to that \r\nGovernment, which has no right to exercise \r\nsovereignty over the Cubans: those it describes as the \r\npeaceful opposition are really mercenaries who receive \r\nmillions of dollars and guidance from the United States \r\nGovernment and do not defend or represent their \r\npeople. These mercenaries, who work in the service of \r\na foreign Power, supporting aggressive policies against \r\ntheir own people — policies that the world rejects — \r\nwant to turn their homeland into a United States \r\nprotectorate. \r\n It is we, the people and the Government of Cuba \r\nwho are the dissenters and the opposition who have \r\ndefied the pressures that others seek to impose upon us, \r\nand whom the Czech Republic will never have the \r\ncapability or the sense of honour to confront. \r\n Mr. Mohamad (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): We \r\nhave asked to speak in exercise of the right of reply \r\nbecause it is our duty to correct false information \r\ncirculated by some parties hostile to the Sudan. When \r\nspeaking on the subject of Darfur, one must not be \r\ndeceptive or distort facts to serve foreign interests that \r\nare alien to the peace and security of Darfur. \r\n From this very rostrum only a few days ago (see \r\nA/61/PV.11) the President of the Republic of Sudan \r\nexplained the various dimensions of the conflict in \r\nDarfur. As in other conflicts taking place in the world \r\ntoday, there are economic and development dimensions \r\nin the Darfur region, which has been ravaged by \r\ndrought and desertification. The people of Darfur, like \r\nother peoples in the region, coexist with nomadic \r\nBedouins and sedentary farmers. All of them have been \r\nA/61/PV.23  \r\n \r\n06-53958 22 \r\n \r\nthe victims of conflict over food, pasture and water \r\nresources. \r\n The conflict reached its height in 2003 and 2004, \r\nthen the situation improved, thanks to the \r\nGovernment’s strategy of opting for a negotiated \r\npolitical solution as the only way out of the crisis. And, \r\nthanks to a purely African effort, we achieved the \r\nDarfur Peace Agreement, which was signed on 5 May \r\n2006 in Abuja, Nigeria. Peace has now been restored \r\nthere, and there have been improvements on every \r\nfront, particularly on the humanitarian front. \r\n Contradicting information circulated by certain \r\nparties that are pleased by crisis and disaster, the head \r\nof the main rebel faction is a Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic. There has been progress on the \r\nimplementation of this Agreement, progress that \r\nundermines the attempts of some to compromise the \r\nAgreement. \r\n The situation on the ground is improving daily, \r\nespecially in the security and humanitarian areas. \r\nHowever, some parties, hostile to the Sudan, keep \r\ntrying to paint a tragic picture, distorting all the facts. \r\nThose same parties had already described events in the \r\nSudan as genocide. They have taken advantage of \r\ncertain international entities, such as the Security \r\nCouncil with its notorious resolution 1706 (2006), not \r\nto achieve peace and stability in Darfur but to serve \r\ntheir domestic political interests. \r\n That shameful resolution seeks to punish my \r\ncountry, which has an independent political position \r\nand which plays an active role, because those parties \r\nare after Sudan’s wealth. It is also contrary to the \r\nAbuja Agreement, which stresses the role of the \r\nAfrican Union in its implementation. The Agreement \r\ndid not in any way indicate any role for the United \r\nNations. The Council’s resolution circumvents the \r\nAgreement by trying to form parallel entities.  \r\n The Government of the Sudan has no problem in \r\ndealing with the United Nations, of which it has been \r\nan effective Member. Witness the presence of one of \r\nthe largest United Nations missions in the Sudan, \r\nwhere it tries to reinforce implementation of the peace \r\nagreement in the south. The recent position of the \r\nGovernment of the Sudan with regard to deployment of \r\ninternational forces in Darfur is a natural position \r\nadopted by an independent national Government with \r\ntotal sovereignty.  \r\n Flagrant violations and victimization are being \r\nexercised by some States, which are trying to use the \r\nSecurity Council to serve their own agendas and \r\ninterests. Those States are interfering in the internal \r\naffairs of my country. The Secretary of State of the \r\nUnited States of America said in Washington that the \r\nproblem is not the humanitarian situation in Darfur, but \r\nrather the restructuring of the Sudan and how it should \r\nbe governed. We say to the American Secretary of State \r\nthat the people of the Sudan are the ones who decide \r\nhow to manage their own affairs.  \r\n There have been several resolutions calling for \r\nthe imposition of sanctions on parties that did not sign \r\nthe Agreement or that were working to hamper it. \r\nAlthough the Security Council adopted a resolution \r\ncalling for sanctions against them, the Council has \r\nremained powerless because several of the major \r\nPowers in the Council are on the side of those \r\nhampering peace and are hostile to the Government, \r\nwhich seeks to implement that Agreement. Those same \r\npeople shed crocodile tears from this very rostrum \r\nabout the Agreement and the people of Darfur. \r\n Finally, we would like to recall the following. \r\nOur conviction has never been as strong as it is now. \r\nThe deployment of an international force in Darfur has \r\nbecome an end in itself. It is a way to settle political \r\naccounts. That has prompted the people of the Sudan to \r\noppose such a colonialist approach, which defies the \r\nprinciples of law and the values, norms and rights \r\nenshrined in the Charter, which any Member State has.  \r\n From this rostrum we call upon peaceful States to \r\nsupport efforts that encourage parties that have not \r\nsigned the Agreement to do so. We also urge them to \r\nreaffirm the role of the African Union and to offer \r\nlogistical, technical and financial support to the \r\nAfrican Union forces so that they can carry out their \r\npolitical, security and military role in accordance with \r\nthe Abuja Agreement.  \r\n We must respect the principles of the Charter, act \r\nwisely and respect the role and contributions of the \r\nGovernment of the Sudan, which has put an end to one \r\nof the longest-standing crises in Africa. I refer to the \r\nwar in the south. We are trying to implement the Darfur \r\nPeace Agreement, which was drafted after much \r\npatience and perseverance. The language of threats and \r\nsabre-rattling and the dramatic exploitation of the \r\nsituation in Darfur will not prevent our Government \r\nand people from making every effort to find a solution \r\n A/61/PV.23\r\n \r\n23 06-53958 \r\n \r\nto the problem of Darfur by implementation of the \r\nAbuja Agreement, in letter and spirit, and in the \r\ninterests of our country and of Africa. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Azerbaijan. \r\n Mr. Mammadov (Azerbaijan): I would like to \r\nexercise the right of reply in response to the statement \r\nmade by the Foreign Minister of Armenia, delivered to \r\nthe General Assembly on 25 September.  \r\n Azerbaijan reiterates that this rostrum has again \r\nbeen abused by Armenia in a manner that is aggressive \r\nand harmful to the settlement process of the Armenian-\r\nAzerbaijan conflict. The Minister’s statement is a \r\ntragic illustration of the attitude of the current position \r\nof Armenia towards its immediate neighbours, a reality \r\nthat we face both in our daily life in the region and in \r\nthe negotiation process. \r\n There is a strong temptation to refrain from \r\nlowering ourselves to the level of this rhetoric, which \r\nis full of accusations with regard to Azerbaijan. \r\nNevertheless, we have to reiterate to the Armenian side \r\nthat its extremely aggressive statements run counter to \r\nthe position of the international community as \r\nexpressed in the relevant resolutions and decisions of \r\nthe Security Council, the Council of Europe, the \r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, the \r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \r\nand other international organizations. \r\n With reference to the allegation by the Armenian \r\nMinister concerning the destruction of Armenian \r\nmonuments on the territory of Azerbaijan, let me point \r\nout that Azerbaijan has initiated and consented \r\nimmediately to receive a Council of Europe fact-\r\nfinding mission to both Armenia and Azerbaijan, \r\nincluding the occupied territories. The mission’s task \r\nwould be to verify the situation with respect to the \r\ncultural, historic, religious and architectural \r\nmonuments and cemeteries in both countries. We are \r\nstill awaiting the official response of the Government \r\nof Armenia to this initiative. \r\n Another notorious allegation to the effect that the \r\nArmenian community of the Nagorny-Karabakh region \r\nof the Republic of Azerbaijan exercised its right to \r\nself-determination is nothing more than Armenia’s \r\nattempt to use this high principle of international law \r\nas a cover for the ethnic cleansing carried out in the \r\noccupied territories of Azerbaijan and the continued \r\noccupation of those territories. \r\n General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV), adopted \r\nin 1960 and entitled “Declaration on the granting of \r\nindependence to colonial countries and peoples”, \r\nforeseeing attempts to erroneously interpret the right of \r\nself-determination, clearly determined in its operative \r\nparagraph 6 that \r\n “Any attempt aimed at the partial or total \r\ndisruption of the national unity and the territorial \r\nintegrity of a country is incompatible with the \r\npurposes and principles of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations.” \r\n Both the 1970 Declaration on Principles of \r\nInternational Law concerning Friendly Relations and \r\nCooperation among States in accordance with the \r\nCharter of the United Nations (resolution 2625 (XXV), \r\nannex) and the Vienna Declaration and Programme of \r\nAction adopted by the 1993 World Conference on \r\nHuman Rights have unequivocally declared that \r\nrecognition of the right of self-determination should \r\nnot be construed as authorizing or encouraging any \r\naction that would dismember or impair totally or in \r\npart the territorial integrity or political unity of \r\nsovereign and independent States.  \r\n These three landmark documents developed clear \r\nguidelines for the universal application of the \r\nprinciples embodied in the Charter. It is important to \r\nemphasize that the right of people to self-determination \r\nis a collective right of an entire population inhabiting a \r\ncertain territory, and that that right should be exercised \r\npeacefully and in a manner that is compatible with the \r\nCharter, thereby contributing to the strengthening of \r\nthe political unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity \r\nof States. These are the rules governing inter-State \r\nrelations in this house, and Armenia, as a Member \r\nState, has the responsibility to abide by them. \r\n It is disingenuous and unrealistic to claim that the \r\nArmenian population of the Nagorny-Karabakh region \r\nof the Republic of Azerbaijan exercised its right to \r\nself-determination on the territory that was ethnically \r\ncleansed of the indigenous Azerbaijani population. \r\nSuch irresponsible assertions by the Minister of \r\nArmenia reflect the degree of morality of the current \r\nArmenian leadership, which is attempting to \r\nconsolidate and legitimize the results of the ethnic \r\ncleansing and occupation of the territories of \r\nAzerbaijan. The Armenian Minster infringes on the \r\nA/61/PV.23  \r\n \r\n06-53958 24 \r\n \r\nrights of the indigenous Azerbaijani population of the \r\nNagorny-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan to return to \r\ntheir homes of origin and to restore normal life and \r\npeaceful intercommunal coexistence in the region. \r\nAzerbaijan is ready to provide a high level of self-rule \r\nfor the entire Azerbaijani and Armenian population of \r\nthe Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan through a \r\npeaceful, democratic and legal process, with the direct \r\nparticipation and consent of both communities of the \r\nregion. \r\n It is apparent that allegations made by the \r\nArmenian Foreign Minister underscore the need to \r\nincrease awareness at the United Nations about the \r\nsituation in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan. For \r\nexample, the United Nations should know the truth as \r\nto who is who: who is the aggressor and who is the \r\nvictim of aggression. Azerbaijan will utilize all \r\navailable means and mechanisms to that end.  \r\n In that process, we count on the support and \r\nunderstanding of the Assembly, as it is only through \r\nexposing, condemning and putting an end to the \r\nmorally bankrupt strategy of glorifying occupation as a \r\nnational cause that we can eliminate the need for hatred \r\nand contempt and pave the way for lasting peace and \r\nprosperity in our region. \r\n Ms. Doláková (Czech Republic): Let me just \r\nbriefly comment on what the representative of Cuba \r\nsaid moments ago. \r\n The statement this morning by the Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Czech Republic merely stated \r\nobvious facts. We cannot but regret such an \r\noverreaction to it. It is our sincere hope that the \r\ninternational system for the protection of human rights \r\nwill become stronger and enjoy full international \r\ncooperation. At the same time, we continue to be \r\nprepared to discuss — at the appropriate forums and in \r\nan open and constructive manner — any matter of \r\nsubstance related to the alleged violations of human \r\nrights in our country. \r\n Mr. Amorós Núñez (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nFollowing the logic used by the delegation of the \r\nCzech Republic, we would like to use our right of reply \r\nto say that those who have come here as medieval \r\ninquisitors to judge us have failed to mention their own \r\nsins and are pretending to be immune from such \r\nfailings. They are minimizing the flagrant violations of \r\nevery sort of human right committed on their territory, \r\nthereby making themselves complicit in the massive \r\nviolations of human rights perpetrated by their ally and \r\nmaster in many parts of the world. That is the Cuban \r\ndelegation’s impression as regards what was said this \r\nmorning by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nCzech Republic as well as what has just been said by \r\nthat country’s representative.  \r\n We understand that the Government of the Czech \r\nRepublic cannot talk about the systematic torture \r\ntaking place in the jails of the illegally occupied \r\nGuantánamo naval base, in the prisons of Afghanistan \r\nor in Iraq. We know it cannot refer to the transfer of \r\ndetainees through covert flights for the purpose of \r\ntorture in areas near its country. We can understand \r\nwhy they do not mention those and other flagrant \r\nviolations of human rights. They cannot do it, quite \r\nsimply, for fear of their great master and because of \r\ntheir explicit policy of complicity with that master.  \r\n What lessons is that steward, or domestic servant, \r\ntrying to impart to us — with all due respect to those \r\nprofessions? The behaviour of the Czech Republic in \r\nthis instance, as has just been illustrated by that \r\ncountry’s representative, is a classic case of double \r\nstandards and hypocrisy. Although we do not want to \r\ndelve into the many things the Czech Government is \r\nitself hiding, there is nevertheless reason to wonder \r\nwhy in his statement this morning the Czech Minister \r\ndid not tell us about the terrible situation of hundreds \r\nof thousands of Roma people who are subject to blatant \r\ndiscrimination in their country and who experience \r\ndisproportionately high levels of poverty, \r\nunemployment, illiteracy and ethnic violence. Why did \r\nthey not talk about the many instances in which \r\nmembers of that minority are beaten by members of the \r\nethnic majority, with complete impunity?  \r\n If there is indeed a desire for cooperation in the \r\narea of human rights, I would have thought it important \r\nfor the representatives of the Czech Republic to \r\nmention such matters to us. Why do they not tell us \r\nabout the rampant corruption in that country, as a result \r\nof which the Prime Minister was recently forced to \r\nresign? By contrast, corruption has been permanently \r\neradicated from institutional life in Cuba. Why did they \r\nnot tell us about police brutality in that country, or the \r\ngrowing increase in racism, discrimination, xenophobia \r\nand neo-fascist groups? If there were such a great \r\ndesire for cooperation and dialogue on those subjects, \r\nwhy were those matters not mentioned? What moral \r\nstanding do they who ask us to be accountable have \r\nwhen they themselves have so much to overcome and, \r\n A/61/PV.23\r\n \r\n25 06-53958 \r\n \r\nin their eagerness to serve as accomplices, are silent \r\nabout the grave violations of human rights of their \r\nmasters? In fact, not only are they silent about them, \r\nthey justify and support such actions. \r\n We in Cuba long ago learned to place dignity \r\nhigh on the list of priorities. Cuba will never silence its \r\nvoice. We will always support those who do not give in \r\nand who stand up for the importance of ideas and \r\nprinciples — unlike the puppets, lackeys and \r\n \r\nhandmaidens of the Government of the Czech \r\nRepublic. \r\n The President: May I take it that it is the wish of \r\nthe General Assembly to conclude its consideration of \r\nagenda item 8? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The meeting rose at 5.35 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\n"
