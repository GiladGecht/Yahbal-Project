(Bahrain) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 102 (continued) \r\n \r\n \r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the work of the \r\nOrganization (A/61/1 and Corr.1) \r\n \r\n The President: Members will recall that the \r\nSecretary-General presented his tenth, and final, annual \r\nreport to the General Assembly at the 10th plenary \r\nmeeting on 19 September 2006. The report presents the \r\nOrganization’s activities over the past 12 months in the \r\nareas of development, peace and security, human \r\nrights, the rule of law, humanitarian affairs and the \r\nstrengthening of the United Nations. This year, the \r\nreport also includes a section on global constituencies, \r\nincluding civil society and the business community, in \r\norder to cover an area that, according to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, has not previously been classified as a central \r\nto the Organization’s work but has become increasingly \r\nimportant. It is, therefore, important that Member \r\nStates also address that issue in their statements.  \r\n Ms. Lintonen (Finland): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the European Union (EU). The \r\nacceding countries of Bulgaria and Romania, the \r\ncandidate countries of Turkey, Croatia and the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the countries of the \r\nStabilization and Association Process and potential \r\ncandidates Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, \r\nMontenegro and Serbia, the European Free Trade \r\nAssociation country member of the European \r\nEconomic Area — Norway — as well as Ukraine and \r\nthe Republic of Moldova, align themselves with this \r\nstatement. \r\n The European Union would like to thank the \r\nSecretary-General for his report (A/61/1) on the work \r\nof the Organization. It is very fitting that, for the first \r\ntime, the report combines the progress made in \r\nimplementing the Millennium Declaration with a \r\nreview of the work of the Organization. My comments \r\nwill follow the outline presented by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his excellent report, starting with \r\ndevelopment. \r\n As the 2005 World Summit emphasized, \r\ndevelopment must be based on global partnership. The \r\nEU remains firmly committed to supporting country-\r\nled sustainable development through actions on aid \r\nvolume, aid effectiveness, debt relief, innovative \r\nfinance mechanisms, trade and the international \r\ninstitutions. The Summit reaffirmed the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, together with the development \r\ngoals and objectives agreed upon at major United \r\nNations conferences and summits, as the framework \r\nfor development.  \r\n The EU has set a timetable to reach new levels of \r\nofficial development assistance. By 2010 that will \r\naccount for 0.56 per cent of the EU’s gross national \r\nincome — an additional €20 billion annually. By 2015, \r\nit will reach 0.7 per cent.  \r\n In the global response to HIV/AIDS, the majority \r\nof the work to be done must be in achieving a \r\nsubstantial scaling-up of preventive action and in \r\nA/61/PV.24  \r\n \r\n06-54618 2 \r\n \r\nachieving social change. Inclusive country-led \r\nstrategies are a key element in that regard. We must \r\nconstantly combat stigmatization and discrimination. \r\nWe must also pay special attention to human rights, \r\nparticularly the rights of persons belonging to \r\nvulnerable groups, to sexual and reproductive health \r\nrights and to the rights of women and young people, in \r\naccordance with the Programme of Action of the \r\nInternational Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment. \r\n As the Secretary-General has emphasized, Africa \r\nis in need of urgent and concerted action in all areas. \r\nThe EU will continue to strengthen its relations with \r\nAfrica within the framework of the comprehensive EU \r\nStrategy for Africa, which was approved by the \r\nEuropean Council in 2005. In the course of next year, \r\nthat unilateral agreement will be transformed into a \r\njoint African strategy, in close cooperation with \r\nAfrican partners.  \r\n The EU remains firmly committed to joint \r\ninternational efforts to protect the natural resource \r\nbase, achieve sustainable patterns of consumption and \r\nproduction, and safeguard the Earth’s biodiversity. To \r\ndeal with environmental issues in an effective manner, \r\nmore coherence is urgently needed in the United \r\nNations system. I therefore call for an early resumption \r\nof the discussions on environmental governance, in \r\nline with paragraph 169 of the World Summit Outcome \r\ndocument. \r\n The EU welcomes the results of the Conference \r\nof the Parties to the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change, which initiated an \r\nimportant dialogue aimed at exchanging experiences \r\nand analyzing strategic approaches for long-term \r\ncooperative action to address climate change. The EU \r\nis committed to participating actively in that dialogue. \r\n With regard to peace and security, the EU fully \r\nshares the view of the Secretary-General on the \r\nimportance of conflict prevention and protecting \r\npeople from violence. While the development agenda \r\nitself is powerful in addressing the root causes of \r\nconflicts, the United Nations must have additional \r\ntools for conflict prevention. Much has been done, but \r\nmore steps are still needed to interconnect security and \r\ndevelopment, as well as with regard to the resolution of \r\ndisputes by peaceful means. The EU also attaches great \r\nimportance to promoting the concept of the \r\nresponsibility to protect. \r\n The EU views the establishment of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, along with the \r\nPeacebuilding Support Office and the Peacebuilding \r\nFund, as a key achievement of the United Nations \r\nreform process launched by the World Summit. The EU \r\nhas for many years provided considerable input for \r\npeacebuilding activities all over the world and is ready \r\nto continue its commitments by actively supporting the \r\nwork of the Peacebuilding Commission. \r\n The continuing terrorist attacks remind us that \r\nterrorism remains one of the most serious threats to all \r\nStates and peoples. The EU applauds the adoption of \r\nthe United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy \r\nas an important step in combating terrorism. The \r\nGeneral Assembly should keep up the momentum and \r\nmake every effort to reach an agreement on the \r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism.  \r\n This summer, the Conference to Review Progress \r\nMade in the Implementation of the Programme of \r\nAction to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit \r\nTrade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its \r\nAspects followed the path of both the Review \r\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the \r\nNon-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the World \r\nSummit, and did not yield any substantial results. It is \r\nhigh time that we tackle the deadlock in multilateral \r\nnegotiations in this important field of the work of the \r\nUnited Nations in the area of for peace and security. \r\nWe believe that the developments in revitalizing the \r\nConference on Disarmament in Geneva represent a \r\npositive example in that regard. \r\n We welcome the inclusion of rule of law at the \r\nnational and international levels in the agenda of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. The European Union also looks \r\nforward to the early establishment of the rule of law \r\nassistance unit, as anticipated by the Secretary-General \r\nand endorsed by world leaders at the 2005 Summit. \r\n The International Criminal Court is of the utmost \r\nimportance for ending impunity and establishing the \r\nrule of law in post-conflict situations. Furthermore, \r\nbringing to justice perpetrators of crimes against \r\nhumanity and war crimes contributes significantly to \r\npreventing the recurrence of those crimes, as well as to \r\npromoting the prevention of conflicts at their early \r\nstages. \r\n The European Union is strongly committed to \r\nensuring that the Human Rights Council will be able to \r\nmeet the objectives set by our leaders at the World \r\n A/61/PV.24\r\n \r\n3 06-54618 \r\n \r\nSummit and the needs and expectations of rights \r\nholders, namely, the people of the world. The active \r\nparticipation of non-governmental organizations is a \r\ncentral element of the work of the human rights \r\nmachinery of the United Nations, and should be further \r\nstrengthened on the basis of the practices established \r\nunder the Commission for Human Rights.  \r\n Another important decision taken at the World \r\nSummit was the doubling of the resources of the Office \r\nof the High Commissioner for Human Rights. The EU \r\nis pleased to note that the plan of action presented by \r\nthe High Commissioner in May 2005 has been \r\ncomplemented by the first biennial programme plan for \r\nthe years 2008 and 2009.  \r\n We welcome the recent improvements in the area \r\nof humanitarian action, including the establishment of \r\nthe Central Emergency Response Fund. The current \r\ndeteriorating humanitarian and security situation in the \r\nSudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo is \r\nparticularly alarming. Gender-based violence is a grave \r\nconcern that deserves urgent attention. The provision \r\nof protection and assistance to internally displaced \r\npersons needs to be strengthened further. In addition, \r\nthe predictability of humanitarian funding needs to be \r\nimproved, as some emergencies remain chronically \r\nunder-funded or even neglected. \r\n In accordance with the overall efforts for more \r\nefficiency and coherence, the EU welcomes the \r\ncreation of the High-level Panel on System-wide \r\nCoherence. It is vital that the Organization continue to \r\nmove towards enhanced efficiency and effectiveness, \r\nas agreed by our heads of State and Government at the \r\nWorld Summit.  \r\n The European Union is committed to the work of \r\nthe ad hoc informal working group on mandate review \r\nand remains fully dedicated to the process of \r\nstrengthening and renewing the Organization. We also \r\nwelcome the progress already made in the area of \r\nmanagement reform, including the establishment of an \r\nethics office, the implementation of whistle-blower \r\nprotection and the agreement to reform the current \r\nunwieldy information and communication technology \r\nsystems. However, much remains to be done. Only \r\nthrough strengthened accountability and better \r\nmanagement will the United Nations become stronger \r\nand more effective. Strengthening oversight in the \r\nUnited Nations is one of the EU’s priorities. \r\n There are almost 90,000 personnel serving in 18 \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations, directly \r\nimpacting the lives of hundreds of millions of people. \r\nWe therefore recognize the need for a more integrated \r\nand mobile global workforce, and we look forward to \r\ndiscussing that and other proposals in the context of \r\nhuman resources management reform. \r\n The protection and security of staff in the field \r\nand at Headquarters is of the utmost importance.  \r\n Given the need for urgent renovations in order to \r\nmake the United Nations Headquarters in New York \r\nsafe and more functional, we need an agreement on \r\nfunding of the Capital Master Plan during this session. \r\n Before I conclude, I would like to comment on \r\nChapter VI of the report of the Secretary-General, \r\nwhich deals with global constituencies. The EU fully \r\nshares the views of the Secretary-General on these \r\nissues: security is not a matter for Governments alone, \r\nand development needs are human needs. \r\n I would like to conclude by thanking the \r\nSecretary-General and the staff of the United Nations \r\nfor work well done, both at Headquarters and in the \r\nfield. The European Union applauds the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his numerous ideas and changes made in \r\nthe past 10 years to bring the United Nations up to best \r\ninternational practices.  \r\n Mr. Gaisenak (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): The \r\ndelegation of Belarus has studied the report of the \r\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization \r\n(A/61/1) with great attention. \r\n The general debate at the current session has \r\nshown that the United Nations has not yet managed to \r\nrealize its full potential in the areas of peacebuilding \r\nand having a constructive and organizing influence. At \r\nthe moment, the Organization is unable to have a \r\ndecisive impact on building an atmosphere of trust \r\nbetween States, preventing military conflicts and \r\ncombating terrorism and poverty. The root causes of \r\nthe failures and missed opportunities should be sought \r\nin a complex international situation that is determined \r\nby a unipolar world order. So long as that order \r\npersists — in which the way to solve problems is \r\ndictated by a single party — progress will be \r\nunattainable. \r\n Global challenges and threats can be overcome \r\nonly if we act together, pooling all our strengths and \r\nresources. We must support existing focal points of \r\nA/61/PV.24  \r\n \r\n06-54618 4 \r\n \r\nconsolidation and development and encourage the \r\ncreation of new ones that can resist external pressure \r\nand become sources of regional and global stability. It \r\nis important that we adopt new approaches to the \r\nproblems related to security and development. Such \r\napproaches should be based on multipolarity and an \r\nacknowledgement of the diversity of ways in which the \r\nprogressive development of countries and peoples can \r\nbe achieved. \r\n We have noted with regret and sadness that, as \r\nmany world leaders have stated, the global partnership \r\nfor development has remained only a concept on paper. \r\nWe have taken that to heart, because the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) affect the fate of billions \r\nof people: their lives, their health and their prosperity. \r\nWho other than the United Nations will care for them? \r\n Our support for the principles of true partnership \r\ninspired Belarus to seek to become a member of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council. We come to the Council \r\nwith a clear intention to utilize the full potential of the \r\nUnited Nations and its social and economic institutions \r\nby providing practical support for the efforts by the \r\nGovernments of least developed countries to \r\nimplement their national development strategies. The \r\nEconomic and Social Council should become an \r\ninternational forum in which the most important \r\ninternational decisions on development assistance are \r\ntaken. That approach was reflected in our proposals for \r\nreform of the Economic and Social Council, which \r\nwere submitted to the General Assembly for \r\nconsideration in February. \r\n We have often stressed the need to improve \r\nUnited Nations activities in the area of human rights. \r\nWe oppose double standards and the use of the issue of \r\nhuman rights as a pretext for applying political \r\npressure on sovereign States. We support equitable \r\ndialogue aimed at truly protecting human rights. \r\n It is because of the need to genuinely promote \r\nhuman rights that Belarus has prepared and will submit \r\nto the General Assembly a draft resolution on \r\nimproving the coordination of efforts against \r\ntrafficking in persons. Today, a quarter of all victims of \r\nhuman trafficking come from the regions of Central \r\nand Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of \r\nIndependent States (CIS). The time has come to take \r\nrobust and coordinated action to protect those who are \r\nweak and vulnerable, particularly women and children. \r\nIt is also high time to speak out regarding the \r\nresponsibility borne by those who exploit the victims \r\nof such trafficking. We believe that the elaboration of a \r\nviable United Nations strategy against trafficking in \r\npersons should be the ultimate objective of our efforts \r\nin this area. \r\n My country, the Republic of Belarus, is located in \r\na unique geographic region that is experiencing \r\nprofound economic, political and social \r\ntransformations. That region, Eastern Europe, has \r\nenjoyed very high economic growth rates for several \r\nyears. Does that give the United Nations the right to \r\nexclude from its agenda the problems of countries with \r\neconomies in transition? The answer is obvious if we \r\naddress the differences in the levels of socio-economic \r\ndevelopment among the subregions of Eastern Europe. \r\nMembers should judge for themselves: there are \r\n125 million people — including 25 million children — \r\nliving below the poverty line. In many small and \r\nvulnerable countries with transitional economies, there \r\nhas been both progress and painful movement \r\nbackwards in terms of achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, especially in the areas of \r\neducation and health care. Eastern Europe and the CIS \r\ncountries are falling behind Latin America and Asia in \r\nachieving some of the MDGs. \r\n Therefore, together with our partners, we are \r\npreparing and will submit to the General Assembly a \r\ndraft resolution on integration of countries with \r\neconomies in transition into the world economy. The \r\ndraft resolution’s key objective is to ensure the \r\nprovision of targeted international financial and \r\ntechnical assistance to the countries that truly need it. \r\nWe ask delegations to support the draft resolution. \r\n Belarus, as one of the few countries that have \r\nvoluntarily renounced the possession of nuclear \r\nweapons, is deeply concerned about the lack of \r\nprogress in bringing about the entry into force of the \r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. \r\n The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons (NPT) undoubtedly remains the basis of the \r\ncurrent international security system. We believe that it \r\nis essential to implement all three elements of the NPT: \r\ndisarmament, non-proliferation and the right to use \r\nnuclear energy for peaceful purposes. We emphasize \r\nthat placing restrictions on the inalienable right of all \r\nnon-nuclear-weapon States to use nuclear energy for \r\npeaceful purposes directly undermines the Treaty. \r\n A/61/PV.24\r\n \r\n5 06-54618 \r\n \r\n The lack of results in disarmament forums in \r\nrecent years is a direct consequence of the rising level \r\nof confrontation in the modern world and of the \r\ntendency to seek to solve problems from a position of \r\nstrength. Progress on disarmament is essential. It is \r\nimportant not only that we preserve the existing United \r\nNations disarmament machinery, but also that we make \r\nit function properly. \r\n Here, we are pleased to welcome one positive \r\nexample: the establishment of a new nuclear-weapon-\r\nfree zone in Central Asia. Four Central Asian States are \r\nour partners in a regional initiative, the Collective \r\nSecurity Treaty Organization (CSTO). Belarus, in its \r\ncapacity as Chair of the CSTO, has circulated a \r\nstatement of support for that initiative. \r\n Belarus attaches great importance not only to the \r\nimplementation of international treaties banning \r\nexisting types of weapons of mass destruction or \r\nimposing control measures on them, but also to the \r\nadoption of measures to prevent the development of \r\nnew types of such weapons. Belarus was a sponsor of \r\nthe relevant draft resolution. The fact that that draft \r\nresolution was not adopted by consensus during the \r\nsixtieth session of the General Assembly is alarming. \r\nLet me ask those who did not support the draft whether \r\nthey really intend to create new types of weapons of \r\nmass destruction. \r\n Certainly, a significant event was the consensus \r\nadoption by the General Assembly of the United \r\nNations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and plan of \r\naction (resolution 60/288). We welcome that important \r\nevent, because, for the first time in United Nations \r\nhistory, all 192 Member States agreed on common \r\nprinciples and approaches for combating terrorism at \r\nthe global level. \r\n It is understandable, in our view, when the \r\npermanent members of the Security Council have \r\ndiffering opinions on ways to resolve international \r\ncrises. More often than not, the most balanced and \r\nwisest decisions are taken as a result. However, we \r\nshould like to note that more coordinated action and \r\nswifter decision-making by Council members could \r\nhelp the Council to respond more effectively to \r\npresent-day threats and challenges and to make the \r\nlives of people in the world’s hot spots a little safer. \r\n I now turn to the subject of reform. \r\nUnited Nations reform is not proceeding smoothly. On \r\nthe one hand, important new bodies were established at \r\nthe sixtieth session, although their effectiveness has yet \r\nto be assessed. \r\n On the other hand, revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly is moving slowly and does not \r\nencompass some important spheres. Yet, we feel \r\nconfident that a step-by-step, balanced approach that \r\ntakes into account the interests of all Member States is \r\nmuch better and more viable than the intention to \r\ncreate a system of management that suits only a narrow \r\ncircle of influential States. \r\n We should recall that the goal of reform is not the \r\ncost-cutting, or even the improvement, of management. \r\nReform is being carried out in order that every human \r\nbeing on this planet might be aware of the concern felt \r\nby the international community and be able to believe \r\nin his or her own better future. \r\n Mr. Akram (Pakistan): The Pakistan delegation \r\nexpresses its appreciation to the Secretary-General on \r\nthe presentation of his annual report on the work of the \r\nOrganization. We note the changed format of the \r\nreport, covering the four main areas of the 2005 \r\nSummit Declaration. In this process, however, the \r\nin-depth review of some of the important political \r\nissues with which the United Nations is involved, such \r\nas the Middle East conflict, Palestine, South Asian \r\nrelations and Kashmir, have not been adequately \r\ncovered. In future, it would be advisable for the report \r\nto be assembled into the 12 thematic clusters of the \r\nUnited Nations General Assembly’s agenda. \r\n The United Nations is an indispensable \r\ninstrument for the promotion of humanity’s shared \r\ngoals. The present and emerging challenges of the \r\ntwenty-first century can only be overcome through \r\nmultilateral cooperation. If the United Nations did not \r\nalready exist, we would need to create it. \r\n It has been aptly and repeatedly stated that the \r\nUnited Nations must adapt and be equipped to address \r\nthese new challenges and circumstances of our times. \r\nThe reform initiatives of the Secretary-General, the \r\n2005 Summit decisions and the implementation \r\nprocess pursued this year were all guided by this \r\npreoccupation. The creation of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, the Human Rights Council and the \r\nEmergency Response Fund are all cause for modest \r\nsatisfaction. Of course, there are several issues where \r\nimplementation of the Summit’s decisions remain \r\noutstanding, including the revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Economic and Social \r\nA/61/PV.24  \r\n \r\n06-54618 6 \r\n \r\nCouncil and the comprehensive reform of the Security \r\nCouncil. \r\n The reform exercise has been plagued not only by \r\nthe multiple objectives that are sought to be \r\nsimultaneously promoted, but also by the absence of \r\nagreement on the strategic objectives of these reforms. \r\nDuring its 60-year history, the United Nations has \r\npassed from the bipolar structures of the cold war \r\nthrough a period of unipolarity. It is now at the prelude \r\nto a multipolar world. We have entered an era of \r\nglobalization and interdependence, but also one of \r\nhuge asymmetries in power, wealth and knowledge. \r\nDespite the 2005 Summit, we, the United Nations, have \r\nyet to establish a new paradigm under which world \r\naffairs and global challenges will be managed. \r\n Our deliberations in these halls confront \r\nconflicting pulls and pressures. They have been marked \r\nby sharp suspicions between the North and the South. \r\nSome would wish our Organization to mirror the \r\nunequal asymmetries of the “real” world. Others, the \r\nmore numerous developing countries, wish to utilize \r\nthe United Nations as the principal instrument to \r\nchange and democratize the unequal realities of our \r\nglobalized, yet divided, world. \r\n Some wish to utilize the United Nations as an \r\ninstrument for collective enforcement of “good \r\nbehaviour”; others, the more numerous, wish to use it \r\nto promote collective and cooperative solutions to \r\npolitical, economic, social and environmental \r\nproblems. In our view, the strategic objectives, political \r\nparameters and modus operandi of the United Nations \r\nmust be consistent with the principles and purposes \r\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter — principles \r\nand purposes whose lofty vision is as relevant today as \r\nit was 60 years ago. \r\n One important manifestation of this tension \r\nbetween equity and the status quo is the breakdown of \r\nthe consensus on nuclear disarmament and \r\nnon-proliferation. The 2005 Summit was unable to \r\nagree on any provisions on disarmament and \r\nnon-proliferation. The Conference on Disarmament \r\nremains paralyzed. Major Powers have resiled from the \r\ncommitment to nuclear disarmament. An arms race \r\nmay be soon under way in outer space. The Nuclear \r\nNon-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) regime is riven by \r\ndoubts and double standards regarding, for instance, \r\nrights, obligations and scope of peaceful nuclear \r\ncooperation. A la carte solutions to proliferation \r\nproblems are sought to be prescribed in restrictive \r\nregimes or through the Security Council. The three \r\nnuclear-weapon States not in the NPT remain outside \r\ninternational non-proliferation arrangements. Instead of \r\nevolving agreed arrangements to integrate them as \r\npartners in the non-proliferation regime, discrimination \r\nis now being introduced among the three as well, with \r\npossibly negative effects for non-proliferation and \r\ninternational security. \r\n Pakistan believes it is time to re-build the \r\ninternational consensus on both disarmament and \r\nnon-proliferation and to agree on effective and \r\nnon-discriminatory processes to promote both. A \r\nspecial conference should be convened, under the aegis \r\nof the United Nations, to promote such an international \r\nconsensus. \r\n A few weeks ago, the General Assembly adopted \r\na United Nations strategy against terrorism. We hope \r\nthis will enhance international cooperation. Yet, the \r\nstrategy will remain incomplete and, finally, fruitless, \r\nso long as it does not fully and frontally address the \r\nroot causes of terrorism, State terrorism and the misuse \r\nof terrorism to justify foreign occupation and the \r\nsuppression of the right of peoples to self-\r\ndetermination. In the process of its prescribed periodic \r\nreview, the strategy should be revised to address these \r\nissues. The General Assembly should create the \r\nintergovernmental mechanism it requires to assume \r\nprincipal responsibility for overseeing the United \r\nNations activities relating to terrorism. \r\n Under the rubric of peace and security, the \r\nSecretary-General’s report outlines the myriad actions \r\nof the United Nations to manage conflicts and their \r\nconsequences. These are the invaluable intercessions of \r\nthis Organization in the service of peace. Yet, some \r\nobservations are essential. \r\n The United Nations, including the Security \r\nCouncil, is preoccupied today with intra-State or \r\ninternal conflicts, rather than with the existential \r\nthreats posed by inter-State disputes. \r\n Conflicts such as those in the Middle East, in \r\nSouth Asia, on the Korean peninsula and elsewhere are \r\nbeing managed largely in other formats and forums \r\nrather than the United Nations, which should be \r\nactively involved in order to promote equitable \r\nsolutions to such conflicts and disputes, in accordance \r\nwith the resolutions of this Organization. It possesses \r\nthe mechanisms and the authority, under Chapters VI \r\n A/61/PV.24\r\n \r\n7 06-54618 \r\n \r\nand VII, as well as through the International Court of \r\nJustice, to promote that objective. \r\n Secondly, even in the case of internal conflicts, \r\nthe attention of the international community is mostly \r\naroused only after the breakdown of peace. No doubt, \r\nthe intercessions of the United Nations — especially in \r\npeacekeeping operations — have proved indispensable \r\nin restoring peace. Pakistan hosts the oldest United \r\nNations peacekeeping mission — the United Nations \r\nMilitary Observer Group for India and Pakistan — \r\nwhich is deployed on the Line of Control in disputed \r\nJammu and Kashmir. We have also been, over the past \r\nthree years, the largest troop contributor to United \r\nNations peacekeeping. Peacekeeping missions are now \r\nmuch more numerous, more complex and more \r\ndangerous. But the world community’s combined \r\nforces are now perhaps reaching the limits of their \r\ncapacity for collective intervention. The most recent \r\nMission, for Lebanon, is proving difficult to organize. \r\nAnother on the anvil, for Darfur, raises serious \r\nquestions about the advisability and possible \r\nconsequences of a United Nations-authorized \r\nintervention against the wishes of a country’s \r\nGovernment. \r\n The fundamental question, however, is: Why is \r\nthe United Nations not more actively engaged in the \r\nprevention of such internal problems, before they turn \r\ninto full-fledged civil wars requiring expensive and \r\ndifficult peacekeeping operations? Any analysis of \r\nthese conflicts would reveal that, at their root, they are \r\nthe result of what I call the “politics of scarcity”. The \r\nsecret to their prevention is rapid economic and social \r\ndevelopment and, in Africa’s case at least, an end to the \r\nillegal exploitation of the vast natural resources of \r\nthese developing countries. \r\n The report’s review of the Organization’s \r\ndevelopment activities, especially the follow-up to \r\n2005 Summit, reflects a fair review of ongoing \r\nactivities. However, the report fails to offer a full \r\nanalysis of the development picture and the enormous \r\nchallenges confronting the developing countries. \r\nGlobalization has enabled several developing countries \r\nto break through the barrier of poverty, mostly as a \r\nresult of their own endeavours, but it has further \r\nmarginalized the most vulnerable States and \r\ncommunities. The promises of higher official \r\ndevelopment assistance and debt cancellation made at \r\nthe 2005 Summit have not yet materialized. The \r\nso-called Doha Development Agenda is on life support, \r\nif not already deceased. \r\n If the promise of a North-South partnership for \r\ndevelopment is to become a reality, it is essential to \r\nensure the full and timely implementation of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the \r\ninternationally agreed development goals. Developing \r\ncountries that so request should be assisted in \r\nformulating their national development strategies. \r\nDevelopment partners — the industrialized and richer \r\ncountries and international institutions — must fulfil \r\ntheir commitments to support the success of these \r\nstrategies, including through higher official \r\ndevelopment assistance, debt relief, trade and \r\ninvestment. To that end, a politically and technically \r\nempowered monitoring mechanism should be \r\nestablished, under the Economic and Social Council, \r\nand specific indicators developed to enable an \r\nobjective monitoring of the implementation of the \r\nMDGs and the internationally agreed development \r\ngoals by all concerned. The resolution adopted on the \r\nfollow-up to the development provisions of the 2005 \r\nSummit outlines the steps that should be taken for this \r\npurpose. \r\n While development was proclaimed to be the first \r\npriority of the 2005 Summit, it is telling and sad that, \r\nof all the institutional reform decisions, the one \r\nrelating to the empowerment and revival of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council is the one that could not \r\nbe adopted prior to the conclusion of the sixtieth \r\nsession of the General Assembly, despite the broad \r\nagreement on this issue at the 2005 Summit. That \r\nresolution must be approved without further delay. \r\n It is also evident that the entire United Nations \r\ndevelopment cooperation system needs to be \r\nstrengthened and streamlined, at both the country and \r\nintergovernmental levels and in both the policy and \r\noperational areas. In that context, the recommendations \r\nof the High-level Panel on System-wide Coherence \r\nwill require close and urgent attention by the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n As in peacekeeping, the role of the United \r\nNations in coordinating the response to humanitarian \r\nemergencies has been indispensable and outstanding. \r\nThis was witnessed in the response to both the tsunami \r\nand to the massive earthquake which devastated the \r\nnorthern regions of Pakistan and Jammu and Kashmir a \r\nyear ago. We welcome the establishment of the $500 \r\nA/61/PV.24  \r\n \r\n06-54618 8 \r\n \r\nmillion Central Emergency Response Fund. We believe \r\nthat United Nations humanitarian activities would \r\nbenefit from closer intergovernmental engagement and \r\noversight under the Economic and Social Council. \r\n The first meetings of the Human Rights Council, \r\nwhile constructively directed, have confirmed the \r\ndifferent dispositions of various countries and groups \r\nregarding its agenda, structures and working methods. \r\nIn our view, the main issues are the promotion of a \r\ncooperative rather than a coercive approach to human \r\nrights; the need for full integration of the right to \r\ndevelopment into the framework of the human rights \r\nmatrix; the avoidance of double standards and political \r\ntargeting of developing and especially Muslim \r\ncountries; the composition and role of the Office of the \r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights; the \r\nrationalization of special mechanisms and procedures; \r\nand the streamlining of the role of civil — and \r\nsometimes uncivil — society in the Human Rights \r\nCouncil and related forums. \r\n Another important outstanding issue is the reform \r\nof the Security Council. This is of vital interest to \r\nevery Member State. A solution to Security Council \r\nreform would need to accommodate the interests of all \r\nand would have to be resolved by consensus or the \r\nwidest possible agreement. While Security Council \r\nreform has been discussed and debated for a decade, \r\ncompromise has not been explored through \r\nnegotiations. A negotiating process, pursued with \r\npolitical flexibility and diplomatic creativity, could \r\nevolve an agreement that accommodates the interests \r\nof all Member States and regions. This general desire \r\nfor a negotiated and agreed solution was evident at the \r\ndinner meeting on 20 September hosted by the \r\nPresident of Pakistan and the Prime Minister of Italy. \r\nWe trust, Madam President, that you will lead this \r\neffort to open negotiations with a view to evolving an \r\nagreed solution for the comprehensive reform of the \r\nSecurity Council. \r\n The endeavour to introduce reforms in the United \r\nNations management and Secretariat and to review old \r\nmandates has proved to be extensive. I was honoured \r\nto co-chair that enterprise, first with my former \r\nCanadian colleague and now with Ambassador David \r\nCooney of Ireland. \r\n The mandate review exercise has produced \r\nextensive information on the almost 10,000 five-year-\r\nold mandates approved by the principal United Nations \r\norgans. However, we have not been able in the \r\nAssembly to proceed beyond the consideration of 400 \r\nfive-year-old non-renewed mandates. The co-Chairs \r\nhad conveyed to your predecessor, Madam, that the \r\nguidelines they had circulated offered the best \r\npossibility of continuing this exercise, which will be \r\nlaborious and time-consuming. We will need to decide \r\nby year-end whether and how the mandate review \r\nshould be conducted. \r\n Similarly, the Secretariat and management \r\nreforms will need to be pursued objectively and \r\ncarefully, bearing in mind the interests of all Member \r\nStates. Efficiency and effectiveness are desirable and \r\nendorsed by all. But any effort to further erode the \r\nfinancial and budgetary authority of the General \r\nAssembly will be resisted by the majority of Member \r\nStates. \r\n The performance and effectiveness of the United \r\nNations depends on the following crucial factors: first, \r\nthe quality of its human resources; secondly, the \r\nfinancial resources provided to support its activities; \r\nthirdly, the authority vested in the Organization by the \r\nMember States; and fourthly, the political will to \r\nsupport the mandated programmes and activities of the \r\nOrganization. All efforts to achieve United Nations \r\nreform must ensure that these prerequisites are \r\navailable to our Organization and our new Secretary-\r\nGeneral. \r\n Those of us who have endeavoured to carve out a \r\ncentral role for the United Nations in world affairs \r\nhave often been obliged to temper our idealism in the \r\nface of power realities. However, this should not shake \r\nour belief that sustainable peace and universal \r\nprosperity can be secured once principles have primacy \r\nover power. The world needs a United Nations which \r\ndoes not always mirror the harsh and unequal power \r\nrealities. The world needs a United Nations which acts \r\nwith moral authority and credibility. The world needs a \r\nUnited Nations which can stand up for the weak and \r\nthe powerless and which is a force for objectivity, \r\nfairness, equality and justice in the management of \r\ninternational relations. \r\n Mr. Sen (India): We congratulate you on your \r\nelection, Madam, and on the efficient manner in which \r\nyou have been conducting the work of the sixty-first \r\nsession. We assure you of our constructive cooperation. \r\nWe thank the Secretary-General for the comprehensive \r\n A/61/PV.24\r\n \r\n9 06-54618 \r\n \r\noverview of the Organization’s main achievements and \r\nchallenges during the past 12 months. \r\n As the report highlights, the Secretary-General \r\nhas overseen the Organization’s many achievements \r\nduring the past 10 years. The Millennium Summit, \r\nwhich led to the adoption of the Millennium \r\nDeclaration and the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs), was followed up last year with the five-year \r\nreview and the adoption of the 2005 World Summit \r\nOutcome Document. The MDGs embody a quantifiable \r\nvision of certain important economic and social rights \r\nand, in this sense, they carry forward the right to \r\ndevelopment. The global partnership for development, \r\nas set out in the Millennium Declaration and reaffirmed \r\nby the 2005 World Summit, is primarily a commitment \r\nto make the right to development a reality for all, and \r\nwe should reach broad agreement in fulfilling the \r\npromise. \r\n The report reminds us of the imperative of \r\nimplementing the global partnership for development; \r\nthe need for enhanced focus on peacebuilding; and the \r\nnecessity of increased attention to the special needs of \r\nAfrica. Here, I would like to say that, until there is a \r\nsharp decrease in vulnerability and a sharp increase in \r\nwelfare throughout the African continent and in the \r\nsmall island developing States, we cannot really pride \r\nourselves on any significant measure of success. We \r\nalso need to focus on health issues, including HIV/ \r\nAIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, and on the need to \r\nstrengthen the United Nations and make it a robust and \r\nvibrant Organization, responsive to the needs of the \r\ntime and, by implication, to the needs of developing \r\ncountries, which constitute the vast majority of the \r\nOrganization.  \r\n It is worth remembering that what was achieved \r\nat the 2005 World Summit was the result of the \r\nsolidarity of the developing countries. This remains \r\nimportant in the implementation of the commitments \r\nset out in the World Summit Outcome; agreement \r\nreached in the context of development follow-up is \r\nindicative. \r\n For developing countries, the centrepiece is \r\ndevelopment. Poverty and conflicts are not only the \r\nlegacy of the colonial past, but also the epiphenomena \r\nof the structural policies of the international financial \r\ninstitutions. The present international system takes \r\nfrom the poor: net transfers from developing countries \r\nhave continued to rise for the twelfth consecutive year, \r\nreaching over $450 billion. Without addressing the \r\ndevelopment problems faced by the vast majority of \r\nthe United Nations membership, security in its full \r\nsense cannot be achieved. The report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral notes that, since the Millennium Summit in \r\n2000, the progress has been uneven and the ongoing \r\nlevels of human deprivation remain staggering. \r\nImplementing the global partnership for \r\ndevelopment — MDG 8 — is a categorical imperative. \r\n The MDGs cannot be achieved without \r\nimplementing the 0.7 per cent official development \r\nassistance (ODA) target in a time-bound manner or \r\nwithout innovative financing, deeper debt relief, \r\nenhanced market access and improved global economic \r\ngovernance. Even though aggregate ODA reached a \r\nrecord high of $106 billion in 2005, only a small \r\nfraction of that nominal increase actually represented \r\nadditional finance to support real investments in \r\ncountries that need them most.  \r\n We welcome the agreement reached to monitor \r\nthe fulfilment of commitments made to provide \r\ndevelopment assistance. India is supportive of all \r\ninitiatives in support of the low-income countries, \r\nincluding those in Africa, where debt burdens impose \r\nserious constraints on the attainment of the MDGs. It is \r\nalso important that debt stock cancellation is \r\ncomplemented by sharp increases in ODA. \r\n Addressing systemic issues is an urgent practical \r\nnecessity. As reaffirmed at the 2005 World Summit and \r\nsubsequently agreed in the context of the development \r\nfollow-up this July, there is an overwhelming logic for \r\nthe United Nations to give direction to the \r\ncomprehensive reform of the international financial, \r\nmonetary and trading systems. The democratic deficit \r\nin the international financial architecture can be \r\naddressed only through a fundamental reform of the \r\nquota structure, which is an absolute necessity for the \r\ncredibility and legitimacy of international financial \r\ninstitutions.  \r\n The United Nations should encourage further \r\neffective, time-bound steps for the second stage of \r\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) quota reform \r\nwithout delay, involving a basic revision of the formula \r\nand subsequent quota increases for all \r\nunderrepresented countries, as well as the revision of \r\nthe articles of the IMF. \r\n The suspension of the Doha round of trade \r\nnegotiations is a cause for concern. The realization of \r\nA/61/PV.24  \r\n \r\n06-54618 10 \r\n \r\nthe development imperatives of the Doha Development \r\nAgenda, the July framework and the Hong Kong \r\nMinisterial Declaration is crucial for developing \r\ncountries. The overarching principle of special and \r\ndifferential treatment remains a categorical imperative. \r\nA demonstration of political will by the developed \r\ncountries will be required if negotiations are to be \r\nsaved. \r\n Giving clear political direction to the WTO, \r\nwhich was not possible in the 2005 World Summit, in \r\nspite of broad political support, remains necessary. \r\nHere I would like to say that the problems of the \r\ndeveloping countries, which are sometimes attributed \r\nto inadequate liberalization or corruption are, in fact, a \r\nresult of the fact that the developed countries have \r\ngone back on the promises that they made. \r\n In fact, the history of trade negotiations is a \r\nhistory of broken promises and silenced consciences. \r\nIn the Uruguay round, in return for the acceptance by \r\ndeveloping countries of lower tariffs and new regimes \r\nsuch as the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of \r\nIntellectual Property Rights, the developed countries \r\nundertook to phase out the textile quotas and to abolish \r\nagricultural subsidies. The first took 10 years; the \r\nsecond — the removal of agricultural subsidies — has \r\nnot yet happened. That really amounts to burying the \r\nPunta del Este Declaration. The Doha round, therefore, \r\nneeds some kind of an impetus from the United \r\nNations if the balance is to be redressed. It is here that \r\nthe role of the United Nations in standing firm on the \r\nreform and strengthening of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil — an issue to which I shall turn soon — \r\nbecomes an extreme imperative. \r\n The primacy of development on the global \r\nagenda can be achieved only if the United Nations \r\ntakes a lead in setting the international economic \r\nagenda. The problem is the reform of the United \r\nNations system — the reinstatement of the United \r\nNations-driven and development-oriented approach. \r\nWhat is needed is United Nations oversight of the \r\ninternational economic agenda and promotion of the \r\nreform of international economic institutions through a \r\nrevitalized General Assembly and a strengthened \r\nEconomic and Social Council, as well as a \r\ncomprehensively reformed Security Council. Only if \r\nwe remain actively engaged can we correct the \r\nimbalance and ensure that no country is too weak to \r\ninfluence the United Nations, that the economic agenda \r\nis truly development-oriented and that laws are made \r\nby the General Assembly. \r\n Here, I would like to say that, in the case of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council, the recent book by \r\nJoseph E. Stieglitz, on making globalization work, \r\nrecommends specifically that the United Nations — \r\nand here the Economic and Social Council is the \r\nappropriate body — should undertake a regular audit of \r\ninternational economic institutions, carrying out a \r\nregular assessment of the performance of those \r\ninstitutions. In fact, he also says that the Economic and \r\nSocial Council should play a critical, central role, in \r\nshaping the global economic agenda. And here, the \r\ndevelopment forums that have been set up under the \r\nEconomic and Social Council could, in our view, play \r\nan important role. \r\n The 2005 World Summit emphasized the need to \r\nstrengthen the Economic and Social Council in order to \r\nenable it to play a critical role in promoting \r\ninternational cooperation for development, as well as \r\nin enhancing policy coherence and coordination among \r\nagencies. An early conclusion of  negotiations on this \r\nissue is needed, as is a demonstration of political will \r\nto enable the Economic and Social Council to fulfil its \r\nmandate as envisaged in the Charter, and to contribute \r\nto peacebuilding and peace consolidation efforts in \r\ncountries emerging from conflict, in accordance with \r\nthe agreements reached at the time of the establishment \r\nof the Peacebuilding Commission. \r\n Similarly, in the context of strengthening the role \r\nand authority of the General Assembly, early \r\nconsultations on the re-establishment of the ad hoc \r\nworking group on General Assembly revitalization is \r\ncalled for. \r\n The General Assembly is best placed to ensure \r\nthat the candidate proposed for the post of Secretary-\r\nGeneral is sensitive to the needs of the developing \r\ncountries. \r\n Here I may mention that, like the Security \r\nCouncil, the international economic institutions were \r\nset up in 1945 and bear the stigmata of 1945. They are \r\nreally clubs for the rich and powerful, and they play by \r\nthe rules of the old school tie. This is evident from the \r\nfact that the richest countries have — in fact, one rich \r\ncountry effectively has — a veto in the International \r\nMonetary Fund (IMF), as we saw recently at the \r\nSingapore conference. In fact, a single powerful \r\ncountry is able to appoint the head of the World Bank \r\n A/61/PV.24\r\n \r\n11 06-54618 \r\n \r\nand shares with Western Europe the top two IMF posts. \r\nAre the use of the veto and the appointments in the \r\nSecurity Council any different? \r\n In the Security Council, again, we find exactly \r\nthe same procedure at work, so this is not an accident \r\nor a coincidence, but part of an established pattern. The \r\nGeneral Assembly was not able to revitalize the \r\nGeneral Assembly itself, through this year’s \r\nresolution 60/286, which in fact remains as much a \r\ndead letter as resolution 51/241 of 1997. This is a \r\nmatter of some concern to the developing countries, \r\nwhich are the vast majority to which the Organization \r\nshould actually be responsive. If the developing \r\ncountries are not able to eschew the prospect of \r\nimmediate gains, which are by their very nature \r\nevanescent, then this Organization is likely to pass out \r\nof their hands, and we are likely to be reduced to \r\noccupying the margins, or a limbo where the Assembly, \r\nthrough continual adaptation to continually lowered \r\nexpectations, would be reduced to the role of an \r\nirrelevant spectator. \r\n Hence the crucial importance, which I reiterate, \r\nof revitalizing the General Assembly, of setting up \r\nonce again the working group on the revitalization of \r\nthe Assembly and of standing firm on the reform of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council in terms of its linkage \r\nwith peacebuilding in conflict-prone countries and \r\nthose emerging from conflict, as well as its central role \r\nin the reform and accountability of international \r\neconomic, monetary and trading institutions. \r\n The recent tragic events in Lebanon and the stasis \r\nin the peace process in the Middle East have \r\nhighlighted the growing failure of the \r\nSecurity Council, which is designated by the Charter as \r\nhaving primary responsibility for issues relating to \r\npeace and security. The main problems that beset \r\npeacekeeping are not a lack of resources, or even \r\npersonnel, but an unrepresentative Security Council \r\nwhich lacks the political will to act and which, when it \r\ndoes, does so in a manner that is entirely inadequate. \r\nThe Council also needs to shore up its participation in \r\npeacekeeping operations. The Secretary-General’s \r\nreport states that an overwhelming number of troops in \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations are \r\ncontributed by developing countries. This is a \r\ndistressing reflection on the Security Council’s \r\nwillingness to share the burden of maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security. \r\n It is no accident that the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport refers to the enhancement of legitimacy and the \r\nurgent need for reform to ensure the relevance and \r\ncredibility of the Security Council. We agree with the \r\nSecretary-General that the Council should be more \r\nrepresentative of today’s geopolitical realities and more \r\nefficient and transparent in its working methods. There \r\nis widespread acknowledgement that no reform of the \r\nUnited Nations would be complete without the reform \r\nof the Security Council. The Security Council must not \r\nonly be more representative but also more effective if it \r\nis to be able to satisfactorily perform the role mandated \r\nto it by the Charter. \r\n The recent General Assembly debate on \r\nSecurity Council reform, held on 20 and 21 July 2006 \r\n(see A/60/PV.94-96), gave a clear signal that the \r\nmomentum for reform remains intact, and that \r\nmaintaining the status quo is unacceptable. Developing \r\ncountries remain grossly underrepresented in the \r\nCouncil, even though most decisions taken by the \r\nSecurity Council directly affect them. Thus, developing \r\ncountries continue to face the same underlying \r\nsystemic challenges that brought them together in the \r\n1960s; indeed, today, in many respects, the \r\nenvironment is harsher. The voice of developing \r\ncountries and their further empowerment in the \r\ninternational arena is vital for levelling the so-called \r\nplaying field. \r\n It is, therefore, imperative that any expansion and \r\nrestructuring of the Security Council include \r\ndeveloping countries both as permanent members and \r\nin the non-permanent category. We are committed to \r\nundertaking intensive consultations with other \r\ndeveloping countries, in a spirit of solidarity, and to \r\nembark on a South initiative for the reform of the \r\nOrganization in a manner that is reflective of the \r\naspirations of the developing countries and that ensures \r\nthat the reformed structures are responsive to their \r\nneeds in areas ranging from development to peace and \r\nsecurity, strengthening of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil, revitalization of the General Assembly and \r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council. \r\n I must say that in the case of Lebanon and the \r\nstasis in the Middle East peace process we saw the \r\nineffectiveness of the Security Council. In fact, it \r\nreminded me of the ancient Roman emperor Nero, who \r\nfiddled while Rome burned. Incidentally, this is not a \r\nreference to the Uniting for Consensus group. This \r\nphenomenon is not accidental. It is simply inherent in \r\nA/61/PV.24  \r\n \r\n06-54618 12 \r\n \r\nthe composition of the Security Council, because some \r\nof the permanent five suffer from the same thing, a \r\n“virtue” that they share, in fact, with the Russian tsars, \r\nthe French Bourbons and the English Stuarts: they \r\nsuffer from a reification of the present, a belief that \r\nhuman institutions cannot change. And unless such \r\nfundamental change is effected, we will be unable to \r\novercome the basic problems that are confronting this \r\nOrganization in field after field — including in \r\npeacebuilding and even in the setting up of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, as we saw. \r\n Also, some have recently spoken of an interim \r\nsolution. Interim to what? Certainly not to a long-term \r\nsolution. It seems that the deliberate intention is for \r\nsuch an interim solution to actually prevent a long-term \r\nsolution, to prevent the introduction of balance, to \r\nprevent the introduction of genuine, comprehensive \r\nreform in the Security Council, and to ensure that we \r\ngo on as we are. In fact, an interim solution is not \r\nreally required, and the reason is simple: because we \r\nalready have an interim solution. The interim solution \r\nis very clear. Given today’s political necessities and \r\nunder the efficient provisions of the United Nations \r\nCharter, we are empowered to elect non-permanent \r\nmembers. We have to elect non-permanent members \r\nthat will be responsive to the needs of the vast majority \r\nof the developing countries and responsive to the cry of \r\nthe vulnerable, of the small, of the developing and of \r\nthe marginalized, and to the blood of the slain and the \r\nvoices of the captive and the innumerable lost souls. It \r\nis only such members that would be able to introduce a \r\ncertain measure of balance and open the charmed circle \r\nto a very minimal extent, but at least make a beginning, \r\nin the Security Council. So, electing such \r\nnon-permanent members is already, in fact, what \r\nconstitutes an interim solution.  \r\n What we need to work towards, therefore is, in \r\nfact, a long-term solution, a solution that would make \r\nthis Organization responsive to the developing \r\ncountries, which can be done only through an initiative \r\nof the South; we know, for instance, how the spending \r\ncap was imposed. The spending cap was imposed by \r\nconsensus. But how were the deeply damaging \r\ngovernance and flexibility proposals halted in May in \r\nthe first place? They were halted by the resolute action \r\nand solidarity of the developing countries. Therefore, \r\nthe lesson is very clear: it is only through an organic \r\ninitiative from below — a Southern initiative — that \r\nwe will undertake real United Nations reform that is in \r\nthe interests of the South: reform of the Economic and \r\nSocial Council and the General Assembly and \r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council. Only \r\nsuch reform has any real possibility of changing the \r\nOrganization. \r\n The Secretary-General’s report speaks of the \r\nincreased recourse to the United Nations for \r\npeacekeeping and the prevention of armed conflict. \r\nThat highlights the need for the Organization to \r\ndevelop capabilities in the sphere of peacebuilding, not \r\nmerely in the cause of peacekeeping, which is \r\nunderlined most starkly in the vicious circle of \r\nviolence that continues to plague the Middle East. It \r\nalso highlights the fact that conflict resolution needs to \r\ngo well beyond its current limited role of keeping \r\nbelligerents apart. \r\n In that sense, the Peacebuilding Commission is a \r\nwelcome effort. Our pledge of $2 million to that body \r\nreflects our perception that there is a grave need for a \r\nshift of focus from just peacekeeping to peacebuilding \r\nand peace consolidation. The Commission must \r\nestablish its credibility. As a member of the Organizing \r\nCommittee, we are committed to contribute in that \r\ndirection. \r\n The surge in peacekeeping reported by the \r\nSecretary-General has brought new challenges and \r\nmore demands, although earlier problems persist. The \r\nissues of effective planning, congruity among \r\nmandates, resources allocated and objectives to be \r\nachieved, and the safety and security of peacekeepers \r\nare other areas of particular concern. Those questions \r\nshould be the subjects of constant dialogue and \r\ninteraction among the troop-contributing countries, the \r\nSecurity Council and the Secretariat if peacekeeping is \r\nto be effective. \r\n India remains steadfast in its commitment to \r\npromoting world peace and security. Our contribution \r\nto United Nations peacekeeping is part of that broader \r\ncommitment. We have been one of the most consistent \r\ncontributors of troops to the United Nations and shall \r\ncontinue to uphold that tradition. We shall continue to \r\nwork with the Secretariat and other Member States in \r\norder to make peacekeeping the effective instrument \r\nthat we all wish it to be. \r\n Nothing can justify terrorism. The adoption of the \r\nUnited Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy is a \r\nstep in the right direction, to the extent that the \r\nStrategy signals the will of the international \r\n A/61/PV.24\r\n \r\n13 06-54618 \r\n \r\ncommunity to tolerate no longer the actions of the \r\nsponsors of terrorism or the actions of those who \r\nwilfully fail to prevent terrorists from utilizing their \r\nterritories for moral or material shelter. In fact, we \r\nunderstand State terrorism to mean a State’s \r\npatronizing and sponsoring of terrorists to disturb the \r\npeace of other States. \r\n Notwithstanding the setback of failing to meet the \r\ntimeline set at the 2005 World Summit for concluding a \r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism, \r\nwe believe that agreement on a draft convention is \r\nattainable. We must now work together for the early \r\nfinalization and adoption of such a convention. We \r\nbelieve that a formulation that would not affect the \r\nlegal status of the entities involved in terms of \r\ninternational humanitarian law is one possible \r\napproach through which an agreement could be \r\nreached. Here, we are open to compromise. \r\n The 2005 World Summit, while recognizing that \r\npeace and security, development and human rights are \r\ninterlinked and mutually reinforcing, underscored the \r\ncentrality of development. The seventh session of the \r\nWorking Group on the Right to Development, which \r\nwas held in Geneva in January 2006, adopted a set of \r\ncriteria for evaluating the fulfilment of commitments \r\naimed at a global partnership for development — MDG \r\n8 — from the perspective of the right to development. \r\nIt also said that the policies of the Bretton Woods \r\ninstitutions have to be corrected in terms of their \r\ndeficiencies from the perspective of the right to \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Thus, there is broad agreement that straddles the \r\ndivisions; there is no fundamental contradiction. The \r\nefforts to mainstream all human rights — including the \r\nright to development — by strengthening linkages \r\nbetween the normative and operational work of the \r\nUnited Nations system need to proceed in a measured \r\nmanner, taking into account the specific needs and \r\nrequirements of the Member States concerned. \r\n We welcome the establishment of the Human \r\nRights Council, whose focus should be the promotion \r\nof human rights through international cooperation and \r\ngenuine dialogue among Member States, including \r\ncapacity-building and mutual assistance. We believe \r\nthat the Office of the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights should extend \r\ntechnical assistance in the area of human rights to \r\nMember States and enhance their capacity-building in \r\nthat regard at their request. It is in that spirit that India \r\nsupported the strengthening of the Office of the High \r\nCommissioner, including an increase in its resources \r\nfrom the regular budget of the United Nations. \r\n We agree that there is a need for further steps \r\naimed at enhancing the speed and effectiveness of \r\nUnited Nations responses to humanitarian emergencies. \r\nIndia will continue to play a constructive role in that \r\nregard, bearing in mind the lessons learned from \r\nexperiences in the field. India was constructively \r\nengaged in the setting up of the Central Emergency \r\nResponse Fund (CERF). India’s contribution of \r\n$2 million to CERF at its launch in March 2006 is a \r\nreflection of our solidarity with other developing \r\ncountries in the aftermath of disasters. We will remain \r\nactively engaged in the process of improving the \r\nfunctioning of the Fund. \r\n Our Organization needs to reform to keep up with \r\ntoday’s complex challenges. We welcome the reforms \r\nthat have been implemented in the Secretariat since \r\n1997 and look forward to constructive discussions \r\nduring the sixty-first session on important issues such \r\nas governance and oversight. The declared objectives \r\nof those reform proposals cannot be repudiated. \r\nNevertheless, the process often becomes as important \r\nas the goal itself. We would therefore stress the \r\nimportance of discussions on these issues, to be \r\nundertaken in an open, inclusive and transparent \r\nmanner. We are ready to engage on these issues with an \r\nopen mind. \r\n On the issue of governance, we reiterate the \r\nimportance of the existing structure of administrative \r\nand budgetary decision-making in the United Nations, \r\nbased on the primacy of the General Assembly and its \r\nFifth Committee. Improvement is a continual process, \r\nand we could discuss ways to make administrative and \r\nbudgetary decision-making in the Organization more \r\nefficient and effective. Altering the unique, all-\r\ninclusive character of the Fifth Committee, which is \r\nbeing proposed by some, has already been rejected by \r\nMember States and remains unacceptable. We strongly \r\nsupport strengthening the oversight role of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, maintaining the intergovernmental \r\nnature of the United Nations and respecting the \r\nsovereign equality of all Member States with regard to \r\nparticipation in United Nations decision-making \r\nprocesses. \r\nA/61/PV.24  \r\n \r\n06-54618 14 \r\n \r\n We need to strengthen oversight in the \r\nUnited Nations system by making the oversight bodies \r\nindependent. We seek greater accountability to \r\nMember States on the part of the Secretariat. We \r\nbelieve that the United Nations should have a fair, \r\ntransparent and rules-based selection process that is \r\nbased on equitable geographical representation and has \r\ndue regard for gender balance. We call for \r\nadministration of justice in the United Nations based \r\non due process of law that is fair, consistent, non-\r\ndiscriminatory and speedy. We look forward to \r\ncomprehensive procurement reforms in the \r\nOrganization. \r\n There is a broad realization of the need to work \r\nurgently towards a nuclear-weapon-free world. Yet the \r\ngoal of nuclear disarmament remains elusive. We \r\nbelieve that the best non-proliferation measure is \r\nuniversal disarmament and that the international \r\ncommunity needs to take immediate steps to eliminate \r\nthe threat of use of nuclear weapons. At this session of \r\nthe General Assembly, India will be presenting a \r\nworking paper on the issue of nuclear disarmament, on \r\nwhich we look forward to working with other Member \r\nStates. We shall provide more detailed comments \r\nduring discussions of the respective agenda items in \r\nthe General Assembly and in its main Committees. \r\n Mr. Barriga (Liechtenstein): My delegation \r\nwould like to thank the Secretary-General for his \r\nexcellent report on the work of the Organization \r\n(A/61/1 and Corr.1). That document is more than just \r\nan internal assessment of the management of an \r\norganization; indeed, it is a report that reflects the state \r\nof the world and outlines ways in which the \r\nOrganization and Member States can tackle a broad \r\nrange of global challenges. The General Assembly has \r\na central role to play in that regard. Therefore, I would \r\nlike to outline our assessment as to how this organ \r\nshould, over the next few months, contribute to the \r\nsuccess of the Organization. \r\n While the issue of development in all its aspects \r\ncontinues to figure very high on the agenda of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, there is only so much that the \r\nAssembly can add to its past work, including the 2005 \r\nWorld Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1). We agree \r\nwith the Secretary-General’s statement that, if history \r\njudges 2005 in terms of promises, then 2006 must be \r\njudged in terms of implementation. Rather than adding \r\nmore words to the already very impressive existing \r\nrepertoire of commitments and declarations, the sixty-\r\nfirst session of the General Assembly should set the \r\nstage for implementation and its evaluation. That is a \r\nvery difficult task, particularly in light of the fact that \r\nmany important decisions affecting the development \r\nagenda are being taken outside the framework of the \r\nAssembly. In this respect, we note with particular \r\nconcern the suspension of negotiations of the Doha \r\nDevelopment Round. \r\n Regarding the issue of environmental protection \r\nand system-wide coherence in the areas of \r\ndevelopment, humanitarian affairs and the \r\nenvironment, we hope that this session will bring \r\nsteady progress and thereby contribute to structural \r\nchanges that will be beneficial in the long term. We \r\nmust find ways of simplifying and streamlining the \r\nexisting institutional framework, in order to allow for \r\nmore effective use of resources, optimize synergies and \r\nmake the system more transparent and more accessible. \r\nThe area of conflict prevention also falls into the \r\ncategory of topics where we have seen many words, \r\nbut are still awaiting real action. We recently received \r\nthe Secretary-General’s report on this matter and \r\nadopted a landmark resolution on conflict prevention at \r\nthe fifty-seventh session. This session should, \r\ntherefore, focus on how to strengthen the tools \r\navailable to the United Nations in the area of conflict \r\nprevention. We congratulate the Department of \r\nPolitical Affairs for its groundbreaking work aimed at \r\nsupporting mediation efforts more systematically. This \r\nis a core task of this Organization to which the General \r\nAssembly must devote more resources from its regular \r\nbudget. \r\n Liechtenstein welcomes the recent adoption of \r\nthe United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. \r\nThat document underlines our resolve to cooperate in \r\nthe fight against terrorism, and it represents another \r\nexample of real General Assembly revitalization, \r\nwhich would evidence itself in the adoption of \r\nimportant decisions. We hope that Member States will \r\nnow be ready to take the next step on this matter and \r\novercome the remaining disagreement on the draft \r\ncomprehensive convention. The outstanding issues \r\nhave to do less with the words proposed and their legal \r\neffect than with their political interpretation. Only a \r\nconcerted effort at the highest levels will, therefore, \r\nbring us closer to success. On the issues of \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation, as well as the \r\nproblem of the proliferation of small arms and light \r\nweapons, it is time to pick up the pieces and start anew. \r\n A/61/PV.24\r\n \r\n15 06-54618 \r\n \r\nThe spirit of cooperation that has prevailed in our \r\nefforts aimed at preventing terrorists from acquiring \r\nweapons of mass destruction should also inspire the \r\nmultilateral negotiations on disarmament. The previous \r\nsession brought uneven promises in these areas, let \r\nalone implementation. \r\n Liechtenstein is very pleased that the initiative to \r\nconsider the agenda item on the rule of law at the \r\ninternational and national levels has been received very \r\nfavourably by other Member States. This new item \r\ncloses a gap in the agenda of the Assembly, which was \r\nrather surprising, given the importance that Member \r\nStates and the Secretary-General have placed on this \r\ntopic in the past. We expect that the Assembly’s debate \r\nof that item will in the long run lead to stronger United \r\nNations action in this area, in particular in capacity-\r\nbuilding for the improved incorporation of \r\ninternational law into domestic law. Furthermore, we \r\nexpect that this session will continue to strengthen the \r\ncooperative relationship between the United Nations \r\nand the International Criminal Court. Much remains to \r\nbe done to improve the mutual understanding of the \r\nrespective roles of these two organizations, which can \r\nlead to great synergy. These should yield concrete \r\nresults in the area of investigation and prosecution, \r\nincluding on the matter referred to the Prosecutor by \r\nthe Security Council. \r\n Human rights have for long been declared to have \r\nentered the era of implementation, which remains true, \r\nbut United Nations work in this area is also subject to \r\nintensive reform efforts. This session provides us with \r\nan opportunity to continue strengthening the Office of \r\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Human \r\nRights and to further develop our thinking about the \r\nreform of the human rights treaty body system. The \r\nwork of the Human Rights Council needs to find the \r\ncorrect relationship with the General Assembly, and we \r\ntrust that this will reflect the great expectations that we \r\nall have placed on this new body. \r\n While we have made a lot of progress in the \r\nhumanitarian area in 2005, in particular through the \r\nestablishment of the Central Emergency Response \r\nFund (CERF), great challenges remain. This session \r\nshould devote strong efforts to furthering a more even-\r\nhanded approach in the delivery of humanitarian aid \r\nand the protection of civilians. Progress in this area \r\nwould certainly be easier to achieve if the Assembly \r\ncould streamline the consideration of agenda items \r\nconcerning humanitarian affairs. \r\n On Security Council reform, we note that there is \r\nat least a minimal consensus: something must be done \r\nabout it. While we are satisfied that the initiative we \r\nhave undertaken together with the other members of \r\nthe group of five small countries is showing some \r\npositive effects, we believe that the Assembly should \r\nalso resume serious debate on the issue of enlargement. \r\nThis will only be possible if some of the entrenched \r\npositions from the past are abandoned in favour of new \r\nand more pragmatic thinking. Past experience has \r\nshown that this is an area that needs strong leadership, \r\nand we look forward to working with you on this \r\nmatter.  \r\n Management reform, mandate review and other \r\nadministrative matters affecting the Secretariat must be \r\ntackled in a manner that avoids micromanagement and \r\nwhich takes into account that this Organization is no \r\nlonger just a conference-servicing facility. Progress is \r\nalso needed on the question of the financing of the \r\nCapital Master Plan. \r\n General Assembly revitalization is more than a \r\ntechnical matter; it is a matter of political will. \r\nNevertheless, implementation of past resolutions on \r\nGeneral Assembly revitalization requires institutional \r\nknowledge and should be coordinated by a focal point \r\nin the Office of the President of the General Assembly. \r\nAs for the non-technical matters, it is up to the Member \r\nStates to make good use of our meeting time at the \r\nsixty-first session in order to come up with decisions \r\nand resolutions of real relevance. The topics just \r\noutlined provide us with more than enough material to \r\ndo so. \r\n Ms. Blum (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): Allow \r\nme, first of all, to congratulate you for the fine manner \r\nin which you are conducting this Assembly’s debates. I \r\nwould also like to thank the Secretary-General for \r\npresenting his report on the work of the Organization. \r\n My delegation recognizes that progress has been \r\nmade in achieving the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nThe annexes to the Secretary-General’s report show \r\nthat progress has occurred in all regions of the world, \r\neven if it has been at different speeds. Nonetheless, \r\nthere is still much to be done. Greater political will is \r\nneeded to move from commitments to action, \r\nparticularly in the mobilization of official development \r\nassistance and in the liberalization of international \r\nmarkets to allow broad equitable access to them. In \r\nA/61/PV.24  \r\n \r\n06-54618 16 \r\n \r\nColombia, as was mentioned recently by President \r\nUribe in this forum, \r\n “Social cohesion, overcoming poverty and \r\nbuilding equity are essential aspirations of our \r\ndemocracy. In 2002, poverty reached almost \r\n60 per cent of the population; in 2005 it was \r\ndown to 49 per cent. We will do everything \r\npossible for it not to exceed 35 per cent by 2010 \r\nand to reach the goal of 15 per cent by 2019 ...” \r\n(A/61/PV.14)  \r\n Over the next four years, we are determined to \r\nreach full coverage in basic education and health care, \r\nas well as making progress in basic sanitation by \r\nmassively broadening housing programmes for low-\r\nincome populations in rural and urban areas. Five \r\nmillion families will be able to benefit from \r\nmicrocredit programmes. \r\n Such efforts in Colombia and other developing \r\ncountries require a favourable international \r\nenvironment and technical and financial assistance in a \r\nnumber of priority areas. Therefore, it is essential that \r\nthe international community tackle Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goal 8 and all its targets with greater \r\ndecisiveness and commitment. We reiterate the \r\nimportance of creating the conditions necessary to \r\nrelaunch and conclude the Doha round of negotiations. \r\n The establishment of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission represents an important step to prevent \r\ncountries from falling back into conflict, among other \r\nobjectives. We hope that the work of the Commission \r\nwill fulfil the promise of more effective and \r\ntrustworthy results in that area. \r\n Colombia acknowledges the progress made in the \r\nfight against terrorism since the 2005 World Summit, \r\nwhen terrorism was condemned in all its forms and \r\nmanifestations, by whomever, wherever and for \r\nwhatever purpose committed. Colombia participated \r\nactively in the establishment of the United Nations \r\nGlobal Counter-Terrorism Strategy, and we will \r\ncontinue to contribute to its follow-up and \r\nimplementation. We welcome the establishment of the \r\nCounter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force, \r\nreferred to in the report of the Secretary-General. We \r\nalso support the initiative to establish a focal point in \r\nthe Secretariat to coordinate a civil society campaign to \r\nfight terrorism. \r\n Colombia emphasizes the need to attack the \r\nsources terrorism financing. Therefore, we are pleased \r\nthat the Counter-Terrorism Strategy calls for stepped \r\nup cooperation to deal with crimes that could be related \r\nto terrorism, such as the trafficking in illicit drugs and \r\nthe illicit trade in small arms, among other \r\nmanifestations of transnational organized crime. \r\n As indicated in the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, the proliferation of small arms remains a \r\nthreat in many regions of the world. Unfortunately, the \r\nresults of the recent meeting held to review the \r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action in this \r\narea were discouraging. Colombia will continue to \r\ninsist on such implementation, which we will propose \r\nonce again during the substantive session of the First \r\nCommittee. \r\n Colombia values the role of the United Nations in \r\nthe area of humanitarian assistance. We acknowledge \r\nthe results achieved in recent years — including the \r\nestablishment of the Central Emergency Response \r\nFund (CERF) as a contribution to timely responses to \r\nsudden emergency situations. The new cluster \r\napproach must be studied by Member States, which are \r\nawaiting a detailed report on the proposal from the \r\nSecretariat. In any case, the work of the Office for the \r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs must be guided \r\nby the needs of the States with which it is cooperating \r\nand must always have their consent. \r\n Humanitarian assistance, if it is to be efficient \r\nand effective, must be governed by the guiding \r\nprinciples of impartiality, neutrality and humanity. \r\nThere must be accountability to Member States through \r\nthe General Assembly. In this area, Colombia accords \r\nspecial recognition to the work of the International \r\nCommittee of the Red Cross, from which the United \r\nNations system can draw important lessons. \r\n In that connection, Colombia attaches vital \r\nimportance to timely consultation between the system’s \r\nagencies and the Governments of countries where they \r\nmaintain a presence, so as to ensure that United \r\nNations humanitarian programmes and activities are in \r\nkeeping with national plans and policies. The same \r\ncriterion must be applied to conflict prevention \r\nactivities. Dialogue and close coordination with States \r\nensure the sustainability of humanitarian assistance, to \r\nthe benefit of affected populations. \r\n The strengthening of United Nations \r\nintergovernmental mechanisms is an objective to which \r\n A/61/PV.24\r\n \r\n17 06-54618 \r\n \r\nColombia is fully committed. My country will continue \r\nto take an active part in the various reform processes \r\nand will strive to ensure that they result in a more \r\ntransparent, representative, effective and efficient \r\nOrganization. \r\n We await with interest the report on system-wide \r\ncoherence. We trust that it will contain specific \r\nrecommendations that will make it possible to correct \r\nthe system’s fragmentation and improve its \r\nfunctioning, while maintaining the autonomy and \r\nintegrity of each of its main components: the \r\nenvironment, humanitarian assistance and \r\ndevelopment. Particular emphasis should be given to \r\nthe Organization’s capacity to support the attainment of \r\ndevelopment objectives, including the Millennium \r\nGoals. \r\n In the section in his report on global \r\nconstituencies, the Secretary-General stresses the \r\nimportance of civil society in the international arena. \r\nIn Colombia, civil society participates actively in \r\nvarious processes and debates, and all points of view \r\nare guaranteed a voice within a framework of broad \r\nand democratic representation. Therefore, we also \r\nsupport the participation of civil society in its role of \r\ncomplementing and supporting United Nations \r\nprocesses, in accordance with the procedures and \r\nrequirements established by the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil. \r\n To conclude, I should like to express the gratitude \r\nof the Government of Colombia for the efforts of the \r\nSecretary-General. His work has not been easy. His \r\naccomplishments have been many during his tenure, \r\nwhich is an important legacy, given the many \r\nchallenges that we must still face. \r\n Mr. Choisuren (Mongolia): Today, at this \r\nplenary meeting, we have an opportunity to examine \r\nthe tenth annual report on the work of the Organization \r\n(A/61/1 and Corr.1), submitted by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan. Let me join those who have \r\npaid tribute to Mr. Annan for his far-sighted vision, his \r\ncourage, his strength and his tireless efforts to \r\ntransform the United Nations for the twenty-first \r\ncentury. Under his wise leadership, we have made \r\nmuch progress in implementing the Millennium \r\nDeclaration and its road map, the 2005 World Summit \r\nOutcome (resolution 60/1). \r\n As we are making the United Nations a truly \r\nglobal service provider, we need to do our utmost to \r\nmeet the challenges of a changing world. My \r\ndelegation thanks the Secretary-General for organizing \r\nhis report around four core areas corresponding to the \r\n2005 World Summit Outcome, in addition to a fifth, \r\n“global constituencies”. \r\n Mongolia attaches great significance to the \r\ndevelopment pillar of the United Nations system. \r\nDuring the general debate, my Prime Minister \r\ndiscussed our national efforts and measures aimed at \r\nmore comprehensive implementation of our \r\ncommitments under the Millennium Declaration and \r\nthe 2005 World Summit Outcome.  \r\n I would like to express our appreciation to the \r\nUnited Nations country team in Mongolia for its \r\npartnership in our endeavour to implement the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). Next year, \r\nwe will begin to implement the new five-year United \r\nNations development assistance framework, which was \r\nprepared through a very close consultative process on \r\nthe basis of the Mongolian Government’s socio-\r\neconomic action plan, with the focused aim of \r\nachieving the MDGs. \r\n We support the proposal, made by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his report, to introduce new targets under \r\nGoals 1 and 5. Ensuring full and productive \r\nemployment of the population is one of my \r\nGovernment’s top priorities. \r\n The role of the United Nations in the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security has expanded \r\nsignificantly during the past year. The crisis in \r\nLebanon, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s \r\nmissile test, the issue of Iran’s nuclear programme — \r\nthe international community has continued to rely on \r\nthe United Nations to resolve all these challenges. \r\n The peacemaking, peacekeeping and \r\npeacebuilding activities of the United Nations have \r\ngrown to represent a truly global service in the past \r\ndecade. It is also heartening to note that Blue Helmets \r\nfrom developing countries are shouldering most of the \r\nresponsibilities of that service in United Nations \r\npeacekeeping missions. \r\n Mongolia is also actively participating in United \r\nNations peacekeeping operations. Earlier this year, 250 \r\nMongolian peacekeepers took part, for the first time, in \r\na United Nations-mandated peacekeeping operation. \r\nAlthough Mongolia is a newcomer, last May my \r\nA/61/PV.24  \r\n \r\n06-54618 18 \r\n \r\ncountry’s peacekeeping contribution ranked it 39th out \r\nof 109 troop-contributing Member States. \r\n As United Nations peacekeeping operations \r\nbecome more efficient, effective and complex, we are \r\ndoing our best to be ready to provide not only troops \r\nbut other personnel necessary for United Nations \r\npeacekeeping operations. \r\n We are grateful to the Secretary-General and the \r\nAdvisory Board for having recently approved financing \r\nfrom the United Nations Democracy Fund for \r\nMongolia’s proposed project. The project will \r\ncontribute towards the achievement at the national \r\nlevel of additional Millennium Development Goal 9 on \r\nstrengthening human rights and fostering democratic \r\ngovernance. Since democratic and sound governance is \r\nthe overarching framework for achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), we strongly \r\nbelieve that the incorporation of MDG 9 into the set of \r\nglobal targets would be very practical. Mongolia’s \r\nMDG 9 actions have related goals, including ensuring \r\nrespect for human rights, democratic governance and \r\nzero tolerance for corruption. We have recently \r\ncontributed our modest share to the United Nations \r\nDemocracy Fund. \r\n The Secretary-General’s observation in his report \r\nthat the International Conference of New or Restored \r\nDemocracies is a forum for supporting democracy \r\namong 120 countries is a valid assessment of the work \r\nMongolia has done over the past three years in its \r\ncapacity as chair of the Fifth Conference. Mongolia \r\nwill continue its endeavours to promote democratic \r\nvalues at the international level through its active \r\nparticipation in the Community of Democracies and in \r\nother forums. My country will report on its activities \r\nand hand over the Conference’s chairmanship to Qatar, \r\nwhich will be hosting the Sixth Conference in less than \r\none month’s time and will be chairing the movement. \r\n The sixtieth session of the General Assembly will \r\nbe regarded as a memorable one, for it saw the \r\nestablishment of the Peacebuilding Commission, the \r\nHuman Rights Council and the Central Emergency \r\nResponse Fund and the adoption of the Global \r\nCounter-Terrorism Strategy. In that regard, I would like \r\nto pay tribute to Mr. Jan Eliasson, former President of \r\nthe General Assembly, for his able leadership. \r\n Secretary-General Kofi Annan’s reports — “A \r\nProgramme for Reform”, in 1997; “Strengthening the \r\nUnited Nations: An Agenda for Further Change”, in \r\n2002; “In Larger Freedom”, in 2005; and “Investing in \r\nthe United Nations”, in 2006 — were crucial reform \r\ndocuments in the process of strengthening the \r\nOrganization. His sweeping reform package, contained \r\nin those reports, has helped the United Nations and its \r\nSecretariat to be prepared to meet the requirements of \r\nthe twenty-first century and address new challenges. It \r\nis commendable that administrative and organizational \r\nreform measures falling under the authority of the \r\nSecretary-General have been largely implemented or \r\nset in motion. My delegation is confident that the next \r\nSecretary-General will bring the United Nations reform \r\nprocess to new levels. \r\n The 2005 World Summit Outcome Document \r\noutlined the need for a more effective, efficient, \r\ncoherent, coordinated and better-performing United \r\nNations country presence. Mongolia is very interested \r\nin initiatives that strengthen the United Nations \r\ncountry presence through such innovative ideas as “one \r\nUnited Nations, one programme and one team.” In that \r\nregard, we look forward to the Secretary-General’s \r\nrecommendations on system-wide coherence in the \r\nareas of development, humanitarian assistance and the \r\nenvironment. \r\n In the context of the strengthening of the United \r\nNations, we support the Secretary-General’s call for \r\nrecognizing the voices of civil society and the private \r\nsector as responsible global constituencies. If their \r\ncontribution is well channelled, they can constitute a \r\nvaluable asset in our work that can contribute towards \r\nbringing about a more secure, prosperous and just \r\nworld. \r\n Mongolia supports a stronger and more structured \r\nrelationship between the United Nations and regional \r\norganizations. Mongolia is endeavouring to play a \r\nbroader and more active role in such regional \r\norganizations as the Association of Southeast Asian \r\nNations (ASEAN) Regional Forum, the Conference on \r\nInteraction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia, \r\nthe Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Asian \r\nCooperation Dialogue. We have also reached out, for \r\nthe first time, to the European regional structure, and \r\nwe recently became the fifth Asian partner of the \r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \r\n(OSCE). \r\n Furthermore, let me extend our gratitude to those \r\nMember States that have supported us in joining the \r\nAsia-Europe Meeting this year. We hope that our long-\r\n A/61/PV.24\r\n \r\n19 06-54618 \r\n \r\ntime aspiration to become a member of the Asia-Pacific \r\nEconomic Cooperation will be fulfilled next year, with \r\nthe help of the countries of the region. \r\n Mongolia cannot but worry about the security \r\nuncertainties prevailing in North-East Asia. The \r\nsubregion lacks a mechanism to ensure security and \r\nstability at the governmental level. It may be time to \r\nstart thinking about the possibility of engaging in a \r\ndialogue at the track 1 level, starting with a free \r\nexchange of views within the framework of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n In conclusion, let me note that the general debate \r\nheld by our leaders has shown that a global partnership \r\nis needed more than ever today. A global partnership on \r\ndevelopment, security and human rights is the only \r\nmeans of achieving the goals set out in the Millennium \r\nDeclaration and of implementing the 2005 World \r\nSummit Outcome, as well as of making progress in the \r\nnoble work of our Organization. \r\n Mongolia is doing its best to fulfil its duties and \r\nresponsibilities and expects the global partners to do \r\nthe same. \r\n Mr. Shinyo: Madam President, I wish to thank \r\nyou for having convened this meeting to discuss the \r\nSecretary-General’s report on the work of the \r\nOrganization. The sixtieth session of the General \r\nAssembly was the first year of the implementation of \r\nthe 2005 World Summit Outcome Document. We saw \r\nsome progress, with the establishment of the Human \r\nRights Council and the Peacebuilding Commission, \r\nand the continued efforts for Secretariat and \r\nmanagement reform. \r\n The one item on our agenda that stands out as \r\nunfinished is reform of the Security Council. Madam \r\nPresident, it is essential that, guided by your able \r\nleadership, we move forward on all items of the \r\nagreement reached by our leaders during the sixtieth \r\nsession and elucidated in the Outcome Document. \r\n The Secretary-General has asserted on more than \r\none occasion that no reform of the United Nations will \r\nbe complete without reform of the Security Council. \r\nJapan is determined to continue to take the initiative on \r\nthis issue during this session. What Member States \r\nneed now is a new proposal — one that is both creative \r\nand persuasive — in order to reach an early decision on \r\nCouncil reform during the current session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n Since its accession to the United Nations 50 years \r\nago, Japan has had an exemplary record with regard to \r\nthe fulfilment of its duties as a Member State, \r\nincluding assessed contributions. Nevertheless, Japan \r\nstrongly believes that the United Nations needs a \r\nreformed scale of assessments structure, one that is \r\nmore equitable and fair and that duly takes into account \r\nthe status and responsibilities of each Member State. \r\nJapan will work together with other Member States to \r\nformulate such a structure, which will bring financial \r\nstability to the Organization. \r\n Over the past several years, Japan has been \r\npromoting the importance of human security as a \r\nconcept that stresses the protection of individuals from \r\nthreats to their life and dignity, as well as the value of \r\ntheir individual empowerment. In partnership with \r\nother interested countries, we will continue to promote \r\nhuman security and an approach based on it during this \r\nsession of the General Assembly. It is now widely \r\nacknowledged that peace, development and human \r\nrights are interlinked and serve to complement one \r\nanother. We hold high expectations for the newly \r\ncreated Human Rights Council beginning a new page \r\nin the promotion of respect for human rights; as a \r\nCouncil member, Japan will play a constructive role in \r\nthe Council’s activities to that end. \r\n Japan is also committed to implementing the \r\narrangements outlined in the 2005 World Summit \r\nOutcome (resolution 60/1) and continues to make \r\nefforts towards achieving the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. In this connection, we, together with like-\r\nminded countries, will propose a draft resolution on an \r\ninternational year of sanitation to promote progress in \r\nthe area of water and sanitation. We also have \r\ndedicated ourselves to realizing reforms aimed at \r\nenabling the United Nations development system to \r\ncontribute to providing more effective service to the \r\npeople and the communities that are the final \r\nbeneficiaries of the system. We believe that the \r\nproposals by the High-level Panel on United Nations \r\nSystem-wide Coherence will give us important \r\nguidance in that regard. \r\n Our common task for the sixty-first session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly is to continue our earnest efforts to \r\ntranslate into reality the decisions on reform made at \r\nthe 2005 World Summit. You have our assurance, \r\nMadam President, that you can count on Japan’s \r\nproactive support on our continuing journey towards a \r\nmore efficient and effective United Nations. \r\nA/61/PV.24  \r\n \r\n06-54618 20 \r\n \r\n Mr. Malmierca Díaz (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nOn behalf of the Cuban delegation, Madam President, I \r\nwould like once again to congratulate you upon your \r\nelection and to offer you our support. I would also like \r\nto thank the Secretary-General for the submission of \r\nhis annual report (A/61/1), the tenth and last one of his \r\nterm of office. This document is a very useful guideline \r\nfor an open and frank exchange on the current work \r\nand the prospects of the United Nations. \r\n We are convinced that defending the United \r\nNations is more critical than ever. We defend the need \r\nboth for its existence and for in-depth reform and \r\ndemocratization. But we must do this with respect for \r\nthe Charter, not by rewriting it or distorting its \r\npurposes and principles. The challenge is to reform the \r\nUnited Nations so that it can serve equally the interests \r\nof all nations. We cannot allow the reform to fail \r\nignominiously in a bureaucratic process of adapting \r\nwhat remains of the United Nations to the interests and \r\nwhims of a few rich and powerful countries. The \r\nprimacy, absolute validity and inviolability of the \r\nCharter, which is not one among many sources of law \r\nbut the cornerstone of this Organization and of the \r\nprecarious current international order, must be \r\nre-established. \r\n The current unjust and tremendously inequitable \r\ninternational order must not be succeeded by a more \r\nprimitive order based on a unilateral reinterpretation of \r\nthe Charter and of international law. We completely \r\nagree with the Secretary-General about the importance \r\nof strengthening the work of the United Nations in \r\nconflict prevention. History unequivocally proves that \r\npeace cannot be imposed by force or by war and that \r\nmilitary operations do not yield lasting solutions. \r\nHistory has also demonstrated that it is impossible to \r\nestablish an effective conflict prevention strategy \r\nwithout taking steps to fight poverty, \r\nunderdevelopment and economic and social inequality. \r\n The United Nations Millennium Declaration \r\n(resolution 55/2) committed us to work towards \r\nmodest — and insufficient — goals. Nevertheless, \r\nmore than five years after their adoption, those goals \r\nare far from being met. Reality cannot be concealed by \r\narithmetical juggling acts. The world’s serious \r\neconomic and social problems, particularly in \r\ndeveloping countries, continue growing at an alarming \r\nrate. \r\n Every year, 11 million children die before their \r\nfirst birthday and 19 million children under five years \r\nof age die from curable diseases and malnutrition. \r\nAnother 325 million children do not attend school, \r\nwhile more than $1 trillion are spent every year on \r\ncommercial publicity. The number of hungry people is \r\nalready 852 million, while every year the developed \r\ncountries spend $17 billion on pet food. If the \r\nunderdevelopment and poverty in which four fifths of \r\nhumanity live are not rectified, if more than 1.1 billion \r\npeople are not brought out of extreme poverty, if the 39 \r\nmillion AIDS patients are not cured and if 900 million \r\nhuman beings are not taught how to read and write, \r\nthere will be no sustainable development and conflicts \r\nwill continue. If the negative effects of the imposition \r\nof a neoliberal model on a globalized world are not \r\nduly tackled and the gap between the rich and the poor \r\ncontinues to increase, we will inevitably witness \r\nincreased crises and conflicts. \r\n Although the report does not say it, the truth is \r\nthat for every dollar of official development assistance, \r\nsix dollars are taken from our countries to service a \r\ndebt that we have paid many times over but which is \r\nalways multiplying. The external debt, which last year \r\nreached a record $2.8 trillion, must be eliminated. The \r\npromise of 0.7 per cent of gross national product in \r\nofficial development assistance must be kept. The \r\nintellectual property monopoly on pharmaceuticals that \r\nare indispensable for life must end. Unfortunately, the \r\nindustrialized world has apparently not become aware \r\nof all this, and the lack of political will continues. The \r\nfailure of the Doha development round is a telling case \r\nin point. \r\n Let us hope that the unjust, unsustainable and \r\ntyrannical world order that we, the countries of the \r\nSouth, suffer can be redesigned by negotiating in one \r\nof this building’s conference rooms. But let us not \r\nharbour false hopes. In fact, we have had many \r\nexperiences in this Hall of unfulfilled agreements, \r\nempty promises and broken hopes. The current \r\ninternational economic system is not only \r\ntremendously unjust but also absolutely unsustainable. \r\nAn economic system that destroys the environment \r\ncannot be sustained. The Secretary-General’s report \r\nprovides a very distressing figure: 60 per cent of the \r\nworld’s ecosystems are degrading or are being used in \r\nan unsustainable manner. The availability of drinking \r\nwater is currently 60 per cent of what it was in 1970, \r\nand today we are 2.3 billion human beings more than \r\n A/61/PV.24\r\n \r\n21 06-54618 \r\n \r\nthen. The same is happening to the forests. \r\nEnvironmental degradation related to the irrational \r\nconsumption by the industrialized countries has a \r\ncommon fate in store for us, poor or rich. \r\n Despite the proclaimed end of the cold war, \r\nmilitary expenditures are on the rise. There are still \r\nabout 33,000 nuclear weapons in the world, over \r\n13,000 of which are ready to be used immediately with \r\nthe power to destroy the planet several times over. \r\n With just 10 per cent of the more than $1 trillion \r\nallocated to military expenditures, the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals could be achieved. Cuba reiterates \r\nits proposal to devote at least half of current military \r\nexpenditures to meet the needs of economic and social \r\ndevelopment, through a fund managed by the United \r\nNations. \r\n As we see in the report of the Secretary-General, \r\nover 70 per cent of the United Nations annual budget \r\nof $10 billion is currently devoted to peacekeeping \r\noperations. Just 10 years ago, only 50 per cent of a \r\nbudget less than half of the current one was devoted to \r\npeacekeeping. \r\n The establishment of peacekeeping operations \r\nshould not overlook the analysis and solution of the \r\nroot causes of conflicts. Otherwise, we will not be able \r\nto break the vicious cycle of new conflicts and \r\noperations, with the high human and material costs that \r\nthey incur. \r\n In the next few months we will analyze a new set \r\nof reform-related proposals presented by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral; Cuba will actively participate in this process. \r\nBe warned that we will not endorse proposals that run \r\ncounter to the mandates given by the General \r\nAssembly and other organs. \r\n We are struck that the annual report fails to \r\nmention the difficulties faced by the Secretariat in \r\nrecent years owing to the lack of resources to \r\nimplement its mandates. It also fails to mention the \r\nnegative impact of the establishment of a cap on \r\nexpenditures. \r\n With respect to the mandate review process, \r\nCuba’s position will follow the tenets agreed to in the \r\nFinal Document of the Summit of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement, which was held with great success last \r\nSeptember in Havana. \r\n The United Nations should be democratized \r\nurgently. We have to strengthen the governing role of \r\nthe General Assembly, the only United Nations organ \r\nwith no place for hegemonies, where we all have a \r\nright to vote and where there is no obsolete and unjust \r\nright of veto. We cannot talk about a true reform when \r\nthe Assembly does not fully exercise the powers vested \r\nin it by the Charter, including the ones related to \r\nkeeping international peace and security. \r\n The Security Council must be rescued from \r\ndiscredit and doubts that burden it today and with good \r\nreason. It must be transformed in a truly representative \r\nand democratic organ — it should have proper \r\nrepresentation from the Third World and become truly \r\ndemocratic. It must eliminate the veto and other anti-\r\ndemocratic practices. It should also become a \r\ntransparent organ by putting an end to the secret \r\nmeetings and decisions made behind the scenes by a \r\nfew and imposed on the rest of us. Unfortunately we \r\nmust be blunt — the Security Council reform seems as \r\nremote today as in the beginning. \r\n The functions and prerogatives that the Charter \r\nconfers respectively to the General Assembly, the \r\nSecurity Council and the Economic and Social Council \r\nmust be respected. We must put an end to the growing \r\nmeddling of the Security Council in areas that are not \r\npart of its mandate. Regarding system-wide coherence, \r\nwe support a greater coordination and coherence \r\nbetween the bodies so as to avoid duplications or \r\nunnecessary overlapping, thus maximizing their \r\nefficiency, without this necessarily meaning common \r\nframeworks of management or programming at the \r\nfield level. \r\n We do not agree with the idea of the possible \r\nmerger of funds and programmes. We feel that it is \r\nnecessary to preserve the separation of the two \r\nidentities. The funds and programmes should answer, \r\nfirst of all, to the national development priorities and \r\nshould respect the mandates given to them by the \r\nMember States.  \r\n We are pleased with the General Assembly’s \r\nadoption on 8 September of the Global Counter-\r\nTerrorism Strategy. We hope that from now on this \r\nStrategy will be a guideline for our actions against this \r\nscourge in an atmosphere of cooperation.  \r\n We agree with the Secretary-General in \r\nacknowledging how instrumental the United Nations \r\ncan be in supporting the efforts of all countries to \r\nA/61/PV.24  \r\n \r\n06-54618 22 \r\n \r\nstrengthen and consolidate democracy, but this can be \r\ndone only on the basis of unqualified respect for the \r\nprinciples and purposes of the Charter and international \r\nlaw. The existence of common elements in the diversity \r\nof forms of democracy does not justify the attempts by \r\nsome to foster exclusive and anti-democratic \r\nmovements and organizations to impose new \r\ninstruments of domination. \r\n The political manipulation of human rights — the \r\nselectivity, partiality and double standards in the \r\nimposition of sectarian models — must cease. We have \r\na sacred duty to work to protect and promote all human \r\nrights and fundamental freedoms for all, given the \r\nattempts of some to mutilate, rewrite and reinterpret \r\nthose rights and freedoms, adapting them to fit the \r\nunipolar order and hegemonic interests of the few. \r\n Hence, in the Human Rights Council and other \r\nintergovernmental forums, we will carefully review the \r\ndifferent proposals on the reform of the human rights \r\nmachinery, including the plan of action of the High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights and the Action 2 \r\nInitiative of the Secretary-General, in order to ensure \r\ntheir ability to resist political manipulation and to \r\nmaintain objectivity, impartiality, non-selectivity and \r\nthe universality of human rights. \r\n I would like to conclude with a note of hope and \r\noptimism. There are very serious challenges ahead of \r\nus, but in working together our chances to achieve \r\nprogress are endless. The United Nations needs us and \r\nwe need the United Nations. As the Secretary-General \r\nexpressed in his report,  \r\n “The effort to make the United Nations a more \r\neffective instrument of its members’ collective \r\nwill is one that is of vital importance for people \r\naround the world.” (A/61/1, para. 160) \r\n Mr. Liu Zhenmin (China) (spoke in Chinese): \r\nThe Chinese delegation wishes wish to thank the \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Annan for his report on the \r\nwork of the Organization. The report provides an \r\noverview of the work of the United Nations during the \r\npast year and contains an array of views and \r\nrecommendations on ways to address the challenges \r\nfacing us today. As the last report on the work of the \r\nOrganization before the expiration of Secretary-\r\nGeneral Annan’s term of office, it also evaluates the \r\nmajor developments in the work of the United Nations \r\nover the past ten years. Please allow me to take this \r\nopportunity to express my appreciation and gratitude to \r\nSecretary-General Annan for his assiduous efforts and \r\nhis outstanding actions.  \r\n In this statement, I would like to focus on three \r\npoints in connection with the recently concluded \r\ngeneral debate.  \r\n First, on the reform of the United Nations and \r\nimplementation of the World Summit Outcome \r\nDocument, the United Nations underwent, during the \r\npast year, an important reform process. Efforts are now \r\nunder way at the national level to implement the \r\ncommitments made in the Summit Outcome Document. \r\nAs is stated in the report of the Secretary-General, \r\n “If history judges 2005 for its promises, then \r\n2006 must be judged on implementation.” \r\n(A/61/1, para. 27) \r\n Various results were achieved during the past \r\nyear: the establishment of the Peace Building \r\nCommission, the Human Rights Council and the \r\nCentral Emergency Response Fund; efforts to revitalize \r\nthe General Assembly; and the adoption of a resolution \r\non a global counter-terrorism strategy. These all testify \r\nto the commitment of Member States to broad \r\nconsensus and unity in the reform process in order to \r\nmeet the ever-increasing challenges. \r\n China has consistently supported necessary \r\nUnited Nations reforms so as to strengthen the \r\nOrganization’s role in the new era. The reform should \r\nbe conducive to safeguarding the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter and to promoting unity and \r\ncooperation among Member States and the overall \r\ninterests of the United Nations membership. United \r\nNations reform should proceed steadily on all fronts \r\nand lead to results in all fields, especially in the area of \r\ndevelopment. \r\n It is clear that developing countries expect United \r\nNations reforms to lead to greater achievements in the \r\nfield of development. Reforms in that field will affect \r\nthe future of the United Nations. China believes that \r\nthe reform effort should next focus on development so \r\nas to fully respond to developing countries’ concerns \r\nand promote the implementation of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). \r\n All Member States must strive for consensus on \r\nissues through consultations and a democratic \r\napproach. They should exercise caution when \r\naddressing controversial major issues and avoid \r\nforceful actions which will lead only to greater division \r\n A/61/PV.24\r\n \r\n23 06-54618 \r\n \r\nand undermine hard-won reform results. Reform is a \r\nlong-term undertaking. We hope that all sides will \r\nfulfil the commitments set out in the Summit Outcome \r\nDocument and push the reform process in the right \r\ndirection. \r\n Secondly, with regard to peace and security, \r\npeace, development and cooperation have become the \r\nmain preoccupation of our times. However, numerous \r\nrecent events have shown that the world is far from \r\npeaceful. Regional conflicts occur frequently and \r\nproblems relating to certain regional hot spots are on \r\nthe rise. United Nations peace efforts have achieved \r\nremarkable success in Burundi and Sierra Leone, and \r\npeacekeeping operations in the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo and in Liberia have also yielded positive \r\nresults. Mediation efforts relating to the questions of \r\nCyprus and Kosovo in Serbia, are under way. However, \r\nthe Iranian nuclear issue, the nuclear issue of the \r\nKorean peninsula, and the Lebanese-Israeli conflict in \r\nthe Middle East swiftly draw wide attention, testing the \r\nability and the unity of the United Nations and the \r\ninternational community. China believes, as always, \r\nthat it is necessary to resolve these disputes by \r\npeaceful means through negotiation, consultation and \r\nother diplomatic approaches, in accordance with the \r\npurposes and principles of the Charter. \r\n The Middle East peace process is at an impasse \r\nand is a source of concern. The Palestinian-Israeli \r\nquestion, the Lebanese-Israeli question, the Syrian-\r\nLebanese question and the question of Iraq are \r\ninterwoven and threaten world peace and security and \r\nthe role and authority of the United Nations. The \r\nUnited Nations must act. As the Palestinian question is \r\nat the core of the Middle East question, the peace \r\nprocess must be relaunched, on the basis of relevant \r\nUnited Nations resolutions and the principle of land for \r\npeace, with a view to arriving at a comprehensive \r\nsolution of the Middle East question, including the \r\nPalestinian-Israeli question, as soon as possible, and to \r\nenabling the parties involved to coexist in harmony and \r\nlasting peace in the region. \r\n The question of Darfur, the Sudan, involves many \r\ncomplex factors. The international community must \r\ntake a responsible attitude. The Darfur Peace \r\nAgreement provides a historic opportunity; the \r\ninternational community should take advantage of that \r\nopportunity to promote a return to peace and stability \r\nin Darfur. It is imperative to urge the parties concerned \r\nto promptly ratify and fully implement the Peace \r\nAgreement. China supports the handover to the United \r\nNations of the African Union Mission in the Sudan in \r\nthe Darfur region, but in order to ensure the success of \r\nthe peacekeeping operation, the prior consent of the \r\nSudanese Government must be obtained. \r\n The fields of international arms control, \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation present \r\nopportunities as well as challenges. Under the new \r\ncircumstances, the international community should \r\nadopt a new security concept, advocate multilateralism \r\nand address new security challenges through \r\nmultilateral cooperation. China favours maintaining the \r\ninternational nuclear non-proliferation regime. We \r\noppose the proliferation of nuclear weapons. At the \r\nsame time, the legitimate rights of countries in the \r\ncontext of the peaceful use of nuclear energy should be \r\nfully respected, as long as they fulfil their relevant \r\ninternational obligations. \r\n The General Assembly recently launched the \r\nUnited Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy \r\n(resolution 60/288), thereby sending an important and \r\npositive political signal to the world that the United \r\nNations is united and active on the question of counter-\r\nterrorism. However, rampant terrorist attacks remain a \r\nformidable challenge to the international community. \r\nCombating terrorism remains a long, uphill journey. \r\nThe United Nations should play a major role in this \r\nfield. The Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy should be \r\na living strategy, to be further developed and refined as \r\nthe situation evolves. \r\n Thirdly, with regard to development, in the \r\nMillennium Declaration of 2000, world leaders set \r\nforth a bold and inclusive new vision for human \r\ndevelopment. The World Summit last year made \r\nimportant commitments in the context of a global \r\ndevelopment agenda and a global partnership for \r\ndevelopment. However, progress in terms of \r\nimplementation is falling short of expectations, and \r\nhumankind is still plagued by problems such as abject \r\npoverty, a development imbalance between the North \r\nand the South, the spread of HIV/AIDS and \r\nenvironmental degradation. \r\n The international community, especially the \r\ndeveloped countries, should increase its aid, promote \r\ninternational trade, technology transfers and \r\ninvestment, provide more debt relief and greater \r\nassistance to developing countries and respect \r\ndeveloping countries’ ownership with regard to issues \r\nA/61/PV.24  \r\n \r\n06-54618 24 \r\n \r\nconcerning their own development. The United Nations \r\nshould play a fuller role in development and create an \r\nenvironment in which developing countries in general, \r\nas well as those with special needs, can benefit.  \r\n The Doha round of negotiations is at an \r\nimpasse — a situation that is highly detrimental to the \r\nsteady growth of the world economy and the orderly \r\ndevelopment of international trade. Negotiations \r\nshould resume as soon as possible. The major \r\ndeveloped countries should demonstrate political will \r\nand push for the early resumption of the talks in a more \r\nflexible spirit. The Doha round is a development round, \r\nand should therefore give full prominence to the theme \r\nof development and ensure special and differentiated \r\ntreatment for developing countries so that they can \r\nfully benefit from the multilateral trading system and \r\nachieve their development goals.  \r\n The United Nations will soon elect a new chief \r\nadministrative officer. China firmly supports the idea \r\nthat the next Secretary-General should come from Asia. \r\nWe are confident that Asia is capable of producing a \r\ncompetent candidate who enjoys high standing and is \r\nacceptable to all. \r\n China stands ready to participate in the \r\nforthcoming negotiations on the scale of assessments in \r\na constructive spirit based on the principle of capacity \r\nto pay. We hope that a fair and reasonable formula will \r\nbe arrived at through extensive consultations. \r\n Broad consensus has already been achieved on \r\nthe need to strengthen multilateralism and enhance the \r\nrole of the United Nations. This is also the approach \r\nchosen by the international community in order to \r\neffectively meet existing challenges. \r\n The United Nations has gone through more than \r\n60 years of trials and tribulations; its important role in \r\nvarious fields is all too obvious. In future, it will be \r\nonly through collective efforts to maintain multilateral \r\nmachinery, with the United Nations at its core, that the \r\nleading role of the Organization in international affairs \r\ncan be enhanced and that its ability to address all \r\nmanner of threats and challenges can be consolidated. \r\n Mr. Hill (Australia): First, I want to thank the \r\nSecretary-General, not only for his report but also for \r\nhis outstanding contribution to the international \r\ncommunity over the last 10 years, particularly to the \r\nweak and disadvantaged, those who most need the \r\nsupport of this international body. \r\n On development, the Millennium Declaration sets \r\ngoals, and goals and reference points are important, but \r\nthe real test is implementation and outcomes. I am \r\npleased that the emphasis has moved, and the \r\nUnited Nations, as a truly global service provider, as \r\ndescribed by the Secretary-General, is an important \r\nplayer. But progress in achieving our goals depends on \r\nthe commitment of States and, beyond States, civil \r\nsociety. \r\n The Secretary-General can be pleased that there \r\nis renewed determination to improve the lot of the poor \r\nand those who are suffering. He can also be pleased by \r\nthe partnerships between international bodies, States, \r\nbusiness and the community, which are now tackling \r\nthese issues. He should also be pleased at the new \r\nemphasis on longer-term, sustainable benefit. New \r\ninstitutions, such as the Peacebuilding Commission, \r\nalso can contribute to meeting those goals. \r\n Peacemaking and peacekeeping have expanded \r\nrapidly under this Secretary-General — and that is \r\ngood — but, as we have learned, the benefits will soon \r\nbe lost unless they are entrenched through nation-\r\nbuilding, economic growth, an improved standard of \r\nliving for the peoples affected and a respect for human \r\nrights. \r\n Globalization might be the phenomenon of our \r\nage, and it has particularly marked the tenure of the \r\nSecretary-General. The Secretary-General has noted \r\nthe irony. The United Nations was designed as a body \r\nto assist in the relationship between States. But, as \r\nStates have been joined by so many other players in \r\ninternational affairs, the role of the United Nations has \r\nbecome more, rather than less, important. \r\n In this complex international environment, with \r\nall its threats and opportunities, the international \r\ncommunity has looked to the United Nations to find \r\nthe answers. The development of the principle of \r\n“responsibility to protect”, which crosses State \r\nboundaries in circumstances where the international \r\ncommunity demands action, is a contemporary \r\nresponse to that changing world. The \r\nSecretary-General correctly reminds us that,  \r\n “States, in short, are the servants and instruments \r\nof human beings, and not the other way round.” \r\n(A/61/1, para. 10) \r\nIt could also be said that with sovereignty comes \r\nresponsibility. And, as the Secretary-General says, \r\n A/61/PV.24\r\n \r\n25 06-54618 \r\n \r\ndevelopment, security and human rights are \r\nindissolubly interconnected, and it is the responsibility \r\nof the State to deliver on all three. The United Nations \r\ncan help States meet their responsibilities to their \r\npeoples. It can set standards, it can demand adherence \r\nand it can also provide practical support. \r\n The challenge to do so in this globalized world is \r\nas great as ever. I was pleased that the \r\nSecretary-General recognized again that in order to \r\nmaximize its contribution to these goals the United \r\nNations must be updated, renewed and reinvigorated. \r\nThat is not only the responsibility of the staff of the \r\nUnited Nations, to whom the Secretary-General has \r\npaid justifiable credit, but also of us, the Member \r\nStates. Without an efficient and effective United \r\nNations system, including a sharpening of mandates \r\nand coherent structure, the United Nations will fall \r\nshort of what is achievable. \r\n I wanted to conclude with mention of the two \r\ngreat contemporary challenges, namely, countering \r\nterrorism and responding to the proliferation of \r\nweapons and weapon systems. On terrorism, more can \r\nand must be done, as the Secretary-General’s recent \r\nreport, “Uniting against terrorism”, makes clear. \r\nAustralia supports his recommendations. In particular, \r\nevery effort must be made to ensure that terrorists are \r\nnot able to acquire weapons of mass destruction. \r\n On non-proliferation, we must also make greater \r\nefforts. In recent times, the international community \r\nhas seen many opportunities to make our world more \r\nsecure through multilateral action on non-proliferation \r\nand disarmament. But, as the Secretary-General has \r\npointed out, we have all but squandered these \r\nopportunities. We failed to reach an outcome at the \r\n2005 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on \r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). \r\nThere was no outcome at all on non-proliferation and \r\ndisarmament at the World Summit. And this year’s \r\nSmall Arms Review Conference could not agree on any \r\nfollow-up process for the Programme of Action. \r\n Australia continues to support multilateral \r\napproaches to non-proliferation and disarmament, \r\nincluding a firmer and more active role for the \r\nSecurity Council in respect of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction (WMD) proliferation. Treaties such as the \r\nNPT and measures such as Security Council resolution \r\n1540 (2004) are fundamental to the forms of WMD \r\nnon-proliferation and disarmament. \r\n We must also focus again on the practical efforts \r\nwe can make to strengthen international security. \r\nAustralia is a strong supporter of the Proliferation \r\nSecurity Initiative and has long advocated measures \r\nsuch as the Additional Protocol, a fissile material cut-\r\noff treaty and the Hague Code of Conduct as practical \r\nsteps against the proliferation of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction and their means of delivery. We also \r\nsupport proposals for a global arms trade treaty. \r\n In conclusion, the Secretary-General has ably led \r\nthis Organization in difficult times. We must now \r\naccept and meet the challenges he has set for us in this, \r\nhis tenth and last annual report. We thank him for the \r\nvalues and application he has always brought to his \r\nwork. \r\n Mr. Arias Cárdenas (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): Madam President, I \r\nwould like to thank you for convening this meeting and \r\nfor your excellent stewardship of this session of \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n The delegation of the Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela would like to congratulate the United \r\nNations Secretary-General for the work he has \r\nachieved since 1997 at the helm of our Organization. \r\nThe period that Secretary-General Kofi Annan opened \r\nat the end of the 1990s has been marked by social and \r\neconomic changes and events that have highlighted the \r\nurgent need to adapt the United Nations to a new \r\nglobal reality. The Secretary-General has interpreted \r\nthis to mean that we must have a United Nations \r\nreform that would identify major themes and paths in \r\norder to meet this need. \r\n The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, like all the \r\nother countries of this Organization, is committed to \r\nsocial justice, peace and security and to the overall \r\nprocess of reform of the United Nations. We must \r\nestablish priorities for the urgent reform of the \r\nSecurity Council, which should take place without \r\ndelay. The actions of that body in recent years have \r\nmade that imperative, as on repeated occasions \r\npowerful unilateralism has prevented that body from \r\nacting in accordance with the functions granted to it by \r\nthe United Nations Charter. The Secretary-General \r\nhimself commented on the delay in decision-making \r\nduring the Middle East crisis, saying that credibility of \r\nthe United Nations was at stake.  \r\n This unilateralism in Security Council decision-\r\nmaking makes the Organization a mere spectator of \r\nA/61/PV.24  \r\n \r\n06-54618 26 \r\n \r\ndeath and despair. It makes all of us accomplices of \r\nterror. Both large and small countries took the decision \r\nof a single country. Of course, Security Council reform \r\nis required with a view to ensuring that this important \r\nbody becomes more effective, more legitimate, more \r\ndemocratic, achieving equality among its members. A \r\nmore democratic and participatory Security Council is \r\nrequired in order to comply in a more effective and \r\ntimely fashion with the main objective given to it by \r\nthe Charter: to maintain international peace and \r\nsecurity in accordance with the purposes and principles \r\nof nations. \r\n The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela reiterates \r\nits position that the search for peaceful solutions to \r\ndisputes affecting international peace and security must \r\nbe found within the framework of the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter, namely \r\nnon-intervention in the internal affairs of States, the \r\nsovereign equality of States, refraining from using \r\nthreats or force against the territorial integrity or the \r\npolitical independence of any State and respect for \r\nsovereignty. We have affirmed and emphasized the \r\nneed to strengthen the powers of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, given its status as the main \r\ndeliberative body that adopts policies and that \r\nrepresents our Organization. This is another necessary \r\nrequirement stated in the Millennium Declaration. \r\n We would like to highlight the interest with \r\nwhich this Organization has been working on \r\nrecognizing the special needs of Africa in establishing \r\npolicies to attack HIV/AIDS and to protect the \r\nenvironment. This will undoubtedly be a historic \r\nlegacy of the Secretary-General’s stewardship. These \r\nquestions were tackled with interest by the Member \r\nStates, and that is proof that political differences can be \r\novercome when the objective is to achieve \r\nimprovement in the well-being of mankind. The \r\ntwenty-first century requires from the world a greater \r\nand better commitment to a just and comprehensive \r\ndevelopment of all the peoples of the South with \r\nspecial attention given to those who face greater needs \r\nand difficulties. The struggle for development is the \r\ntrue covenant of peace and its achievement is the death \r\nof war and terror. \r\n Terrorism is a challenge that requires joint action. \r\nOur delegation believes that the adoption of the United \r\nNations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy is an \r\nimportant first step towards bringing together in the \r\nfuture more robust and coordinated actions to tackle \r\nthis phenomenon at the global level. The United \r\nNations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy should be \r\nthe start of a much broader negotiation to make \r\npossible the achievement of a concept of terrorism with \r\nwhich all the Member States can fully identify, as well \r\nas the recognition and all-out struggle against the \r\nsocial, economic and political causes that foster \r\nterrorism and its development. \r\n Reform of the Economic and Social Council must \r\nbe based on the right to development as that would \r\nmake it possible to establish machinery aimed at \r\nguaranteeing compatibility with the Council’s \r\nprogrammes and activities through concrete actions to \r\novercome marginalization, hunger and poverty for \r\nmillions of people. \r\n The United Nations must design and implement \r\nmeasures that would oblige the main economic and \r\nfinancial bodies to exert greater efforts to formulate \r\nbetter policies to help curb the broadening gap between \r\ndeveloped and developing countries, as well as permit \r\nthe establishment of effective machinery related to the \r\ndebt problem, trade preferences, technical cooperation \r\nand the promotion of national capacities. \r\n Concerning the Organization’s budget, higher-\r\nincome countries that have not complied with their \r\nresponsibilities to the Organization in this respect must \r\nassume their commitment to honour their debt, thus \r\nmaking it possible to improve the operation of our \r\nOrganization and promote the objectives of the Charter. \r\n I am pleased to inform the Assembly that the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela has honoured all its \r\ncommitments related to contributions to the \r\nOrganization’s regular budget, its peacekeeping \r\noperations budget, the International Criminal Tribunals \r\nfor Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, the \r\nUnited Nations Capital Master Plan and United Nations \r\nfunds and programmes. \r\n With respect to the mandate review, we would \r\nlike to reiterate that this exercise should be limited to \r\nmandates that have not been renewed for over five \r\nyears. This review should be completed this year as \r\nagreed. We should not allow the exercise to weaken our \r\ncapacity, taking up the time of our delegates, while \r\nparallel negotiations are being carried out on other \r\nmatters that are of vital importance. \r\n It is crucial that we not weaken the ability of the \r\nGeneral Assembly to decide on administrative and \r\n A/61/PV.24\r\n \r\n27 06-54618 \r\n \r\nbudgetary matters of the Organization. Likewise, the \r\nSecretary-General’s report on the broad review of the \r\nmanagement and supervision of funds, programmes \r\nand specialized agencies of the United Nations should \r\nbe submitted to the Fifth Committee, following the \r\nusual procedures. \r\n We will not be able to comply with the Charter \r\nwhile within our Organization positions still persist \r\nthat deny the right to development. This is an \r\ninalienable human right by which every human being is \r\nempowered to take part in political, cultural, social and \r\neconomic development and by which they can fully \r\nenjoy their fundamental freedoms and contribute to this \r\ndevelopment and enjoy it. In this context, our \r\ndelegation shares the view expressed by the \r\nSecretary-General about the need to strengthen the \r\nUnited Nations, which is not simply a question of \r\naccountability, but rather an imperative for all Member \r\nStates, which should devote more urgent attention to it \r\nthan they have so far.  \r\n Lastly, the delegation of the Bolivarian Republic \r\nof Venezuela would like to reiterate its congratulations \r\nto Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his stewardship of \r\nour Organization and the legacy that he has left it. \r\n Mr. Hamidon (Malaysia): The report of the \r\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization \r\n(A/61/1 and Corr.1) that is before us illustrates the \r\nchallenges and tasks facing this Organization. \r\n As outlined by its Charter, the main purpose of \r\nthe Organization is the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security. By and large, this has been \r\nachieved. However, in the Middle East the problems, in \r\nparticular the Palestinian question, remain unresolved. \r\nThe devastation wrought on Gaza, Baghdad and \r\nLebanon has left an indelible impression on Muslims \r\nworldwide of the complicity of the West to humiliate \r\nthem. This fans the feelings of outrage and anger, \r\nwhich often erupt into violence. \r\n It is imperative that a comprehensive solution to \r\nthe Middle East crisis be found. No one party or \r\ncountry can determine how the Middle East is to be \r\nredrawn and reshaped. The views of all those \r\nconcerned have to be addressed. In this regard, my \r\ndelegation feels that the United Nations could play a \r\nmore pronounced and decisive role, as envisioned by \r\nits Charter, by bringing together all parties concerned \r\nto the negotiating table. \r\n As the bastion of multilateralism, the United \r\nNations has to rise to the challenge of safeguarding the \r\ninterests of developing countries. Millions of the poor, \r\nthe hungry and the destitute in the South expect the \r\nUnited Nations to play its role in galvanizing support \r\nand political will that will bring the benefits of \r\ndevelopment and globalization to them. In this regard, \r\nMadam President, you were prescient in choosing the \r\ntheme for the Assembly to focus its general debate on \r\nlast week, namely, “Implementing a global partnership \r\nfor development”.  \r\n During the sixtieth session of the General \r\nAssembly, we were not able to conclude work on \r\nstrengthening the Economic and Social Council. This \r\nendeavour should now be our priority, and an early \r\noutcome should be reached at the current session. We \r\nshould not forget that at the 2005 World Summit our \r\nleaders had reaffirmed the importance of an effective \r\nEconomic and Social Council as a principal body for \r\ncoordination, policy review, policy dialogue and \r\nrecommendations on issues of economic and social \r\ndevelopment. A strengthened Economic and Social \r\nCouncil is in our interest, so that it can be a pillar in \r\nthe United Nations system for maintaining economic \r\nand social justice, just as the Security Council is \r\nresponsible for the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security. \r\n Another area in which work is still unfinished is \r\nreforming the Security Council to make it more \r\nrepresentative in terms of its composition and to make \r\nit better reflect the world we live in today. It is crucial \r\nthat we attain those objectives because it would lend \r\nlegitimacy to the Security Council and to the decisions \r\nit takes, which affect the vast majority of us in this \r\nHall who are not represented in the Council. \r\n The sixtieth session of the General Assembly \r\nagreed on a resolution on General Assembly \r\nrevitalization (resolution 60/286). It is my delegation’s \r\nhope that, at the current session, an ad hoc working \r\ngroup on General Assembly revitalization will meet as \r\na follow-up to that resolution. The Assembly has been \r\ndeliberating on resolutions relating to General \r\nAssembly revitalization for the past 15 years, and it is \r\nhigh time that we concretized, through the ad hoc \r\nworking group, what we have agreed on, namely, to \r\nstrengthen the central position of the General Assembly \r\nas the chief deliberative, policymaking and \r\nrepresentative organ of the United Nations, and to \r\nA/61/PV.24  \r\n \r\n06-54618 28 \r\n \r\nstrengthen its role in the process of standard-setting \r\nand the codification of international law. \r\n Our task in reforming the United Nations is not a \r\none-off process, but a continuous process. To reform \r\nthe principal organs of the Organization and strengthen \r\nthe Organization’s capacity to handle the many \r\nchallenges facing it in such fields as human rights, \r\npeacekeeping, conflict resolution and humanitarian \r\nassistance, it is essential that this House be kept in \r\norder. The United Nations must become more efficient \r\nand more effective. \r\n In that regard, my delegation reiterates that it is \r\nvital for the Organization to secure a healthy and stable \r\nfinancial position in order to ensure that all operations \r\nare carried out within the expected time frames and in \r\nan efficient manner. We hope that the Member States \r\nconcerned will honour their assessed contributions and \r\nsettle their arrears, without any conditions attached. \r\n My delegation will continue to work and \r\ncooperate with other delegations on management and \r\nSecretariat reform. This process should be all-\r\ninclusive, involving all parties, who themselves should \r\nbe actively engaged, should possess political will, and \r\nshould be guided by the General Assembly’s rules of \r\nprocedure. \r\n My delegation also acknowledges civil society’s \r\npositive contributions to the Organization, which have \r\nbeen particularly helpful during the current reform \r\nprocess. We welcome civil society’s continued \r\nparticipation in various forums. However, the \r\nUnited Nations is an intergovernmental body, and the \r\nparticipation of civil society should be guided by \r\nEconomic and Social Council resolution 1996/31. \r\n One issue that we failed to agree upon at the 2005 \r\nWorld Summit is disarmament and non-proliferation. \r\nThat failure is very disappointing to my delegation \r\nsince weapons of mass destruction present the greatest \r\nthreat to all mankind. The situation is further \r\ncomplicated by the failure of the 2005 Review \r\nConference Treaty of the Parties to the Treaty on the \r\nNon-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as well as the \r\ninability of the 2006 United Nations Conference to \r\nReview Progress Made in the Implementation of the \r\nProgramme of Action on Small Arms to find a \r\nconsensus. In the case of the latter, the weapons \r\ninvolved may be small, but we are well aware of their \r\ndevastating impact on societies. In this sense, they too \r\ncould be regarded as de facto weapons of mass \r\ndestruction. We can ill afford another failure at this \r\nsession to act on these issues. \r\n In conclusion, Madam President, I wish you well \r\nas you lead us in our deliberations on the various issues \r\nfacing the sixty-first session. \r\n Mr. Jenie (Indonesia): Once again we have \r\nassembled here to review the work of the United \r\nNations over the past year in furtherance of the \r\nobjectives of the Charter and the decisions of world \r\nleaders. Before I continue, I want to express the \r\nappreciation of my delegation to Secretary-General \r\nKofi Annan, not only for providing us with the \r\nin-depth examination on the work of the Organization \r\nbefore us, but also for his exemplary service to the \r\nUnited Nations in his 10 years at the helm of the \r\nSecretariat. \r\n It is unrealistic, indeed almost impossible, to \r\nundertake a review of the report of the \r\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization, \r\ncontained in document A/61/1, without according due \r\nattention to the strides made by the United Nations in \r\nthe last 10 years. This is because the history of the \r\nUnited Nations in the past year exists only within the \r\ncontext of the past decade. \r\n During that period, under Mr. Annan, the \r\nOrganization has carried out some of the most \r\nfundamental and far-reaching work since the adoption \r\nof the Charter. For example, we began a most \r\ncomprehensive reform process that was designed to \r\nensure that the United Nations is able to respond to the \r\nchallenges before it and to meet the expectation of the \r\nentire membership. \r\n It will be recalled that, in December 1998, by \r\nresolution 53/202, the General Assembly designated \r\nthe fifty-fifth session as the Millennium Assembly of \r\nthe United Nations. In 2000, that led to the most \r\nimportant single gathering of Member States since the \r\ninception of the United Nations: the Millennium \r\nAssembly, the follow-up of which was held here just \r\none year ago. \r\n In the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2), \r\n189 heads of State or Government made the historic \r\ncommitment to free their fellow citizens from poverty \r\nby 2015, nine years from now. Last year’s World \r\nSummit, which examined the progress made in the \r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n A/61/PV.24\r\n \r\n29 06-54618 \r\n \r\n(MDGs), as well as recent United Nations conferences, \r\nreiterated this commitment. \r\n In view of the increased upheavals in global \r\ngeopolitics, and the uneven progress in the \r\ninternational economic and social fields, the question \r\nof the effectiveness of the United Nations looms large. \r\nMy delegation believes that it is within this context, \r\nand in the light of the efforts of Mr. Annan in the past \r\nyear and throughout his years in office, that we must \r\nlook at the United Nations and the future. The report \r\nbefore us is a further reminder of what the important \r\nissues are and of how far we have gone in addressing \r\nthem. \r\n We share the view stated by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in this report that the one issue that has \r\ndominated the past 10 years must surely be \r\nglobalization. Economically, globalization is an \r\nopportunity that promises improved living conditions \r\nfor people everywhere. Regrettably, it has yet to fulfil \r\nthat promise. Indeed, it seems to have continued to \r\nfavour the developed economies and to amplify the \r\ndisparity between the haves and the have-nots. \r\n Regrettably, the World Summit not only revealed \r\nstunning differences the world over in the \r\nimplementation of the MDGs, but also gave sober \r\nindications that some parts of the world, notably \r\nAfrica, might not come close to full implementation by \r\nthe 2015 target date. Indeed, while the report of the \r\nSecretary-General observes some positive signs in the \r\nreduction of global poverty, it sums up the situation for \r\nthe majority by noting that the ongoing levels of \r\nhuman deprivation remain staggering. \r\n My delegation notes the Secretary-General’s \r\nproposal to introduce a new set of targets in the follow-\r\nup of the Millennium Declaration and shares his \r\nconcerns in this regard. \r\n However, we are of the view that having more \r\ngoals per se does not necessarily lead to development. \r\nThe key is that agreed commitments and actions be \r\nhonoured by all relevant entities. We agree with the \r\nSecretary-General that 2006, the year following the \r\nWorld Summit, must be judged on its ability to \r\nimplement the MDGs. \r\n We hope that resolution 60/265, on the follow-up \r\nto the development outcome of the World Summit and \r\nother internationally agreed development goals, will be \r\nacted upon without delay, particularly in our common \r\nendeavour to eradicate poverty. My delegation also \r\nlooks forward to an action-oriented draft resolution on \r\nthe reform of the Economic and Social Council that \r\nwill make the Council robust and truly central in its \r\npolicy coordination and dialogue roles with all relevant \r\ninternational actors, particularly the Bretton Woods \r\ninstitutions and the World Trade Organization. In this \r\nconnection, Indonesia supports the holding of the \r\nDevelopment Cooperation Forum and the annual \r\nministerial reviews. \r\n Ultimately, the commitment to development can \r\nonly be translated into action if developing countries \r\nhave requisite funds and possess sufficient capacities. \r\nFundamentally, international financial commitments \r\nremain inadequate in terms of timing, volume and \r\nquality for achieving the internationally agreed \r\ndevelopment goals, including the MDGs. Official \r\ndevelopment assistance, along with debt relief, are \r\nimportant. However, foreign direct investment can \r\ngreatly help to spur private sector formation. There is a \r\nneed for higher investment flows to the developing \r\ncountries. Indonesia agrees with the report’s conclusion \r\nabout good governance and accountability, and fully \r\nshares the view that they should be in evidence at both \r\nthe national and international levels. \r\n Globalization has also contributed to the \r\nredefinition of our political and economic realities in \r\nterms of the critical issues of security, development \r\nand human rights, as well as the links between them. \r\n Unfortunately, various conflicts continue to \r\nsimmer in different parts of the globe, hampering the \r\npath to a stable and prosperous world. It is a travesty \r\nthat, on the one hand, we face a paucity in financing \r\nfor development, while on the other, we deal with the \r\nreality that the total budget of United Nations \r\npeacekeeping is just 0.5 per cent of international \r\nmilitary spending. To find peaceful ways out of \r\nconflict situations, the role of the United Nations needs \r\nto be strengthened, and its mediation capacities made \r\nmore effective. \r\n We share the concern of the Secretary-General \r\nover a series of setbacks in multilateral disarmament in \r\nrecent years. The lack of progress in pursuing \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation objectives is a \r\ncause for great distress to all those who aspire to a \r\npeaceful and stable world. We believe that it is now \r\nhigh time for renewed efforts to break the impasse in \r\nmultilateral negotiations and to bring disarmament \r\nA/61/PV.24  \r\n \r\n06-54618 30 \r\n \r\nissues back into the limelight of the international \r\nagenda. \r\n Indonesia, as a member of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, seeks to work actively with others in \r\ntrying to fill the lacunae in the international \r\npeacebuilding system. We need to undertake cohesive \r\nand integrated peacebuilding strategies, with maximum \r\nlocal ownership, which lead to the resolution of \r\nconflicts in their entirety. \r\n We look forward to the full functioning of the \r\nnewly established Human Rights Council. We firmly \r\nbelieve that the principles agreed upon and contained \r\nin the founding resolution (resolution 60/251) should \r\ngovern every aspect of the Council’s work. This is of \r\nthe utmost importance if the Human Rights Council is \r\nto be an effective forum for the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights and if it is to benefit the \r\nentire membership of the United Nations. \r\n My delegation is hopeful that our recent \r\nagreement on the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy \r\nwill provide an effective operational framework for \r\ninternational cooperation in combating terrorism. We \r\nurge Member States to intensify their efforts towards \r\nfinalizing a comprehensive convention against \r\ninternational terrorism. Our efforts against the scourge \r\nof international terrorism need to be comprehensive, \r\ntaking into account the need to address root causes, and \r\nin full compliance with international laws and the \r\nprinciples of respect for human rights. \r\n We also attach great importance to the role of \r\nregional organizations in their contribution to many \r\n \r\nissues, including development, peacemaking and \r\npeacekeeping. We hope that the United Nations will \r\nmake greater and timely utilization of these valuable \r\nresources in its various programmes and strategies. \r\n Globalization has also revealed other realities, \r\nincluding the emergence and the growing importance \r\nof civil society’s role in the work of the United \r\nNations. While the Organization remains an \r\nintergovernmental one where decisions are taken by \r\nMember States, it has benefited from its engagement \r\nwith civil society, both in strengthening the institution \r\nand enriching the intergovernmental debate. In the \r\nreport prepared by the Ambassador of Norway and \r\nmyself as co-advisers to the President of sixtieth \r\nsession of the General Assembly, while we \r\nacknowledged the need to address the existing \r\n“confidence deficit” among Member States and civil \r\nsociety, we stressed that there was sufficient ground to \r\nexplore better interaction between the two groups and \r\nas well as a more meaningful engagement of civil \r\nsociety in the work of the Organization in general and \r\nof the General Assembly in particular. \r\n In conclusion, Indonesia reiterates its full support \r\nand commitment to all those who endeavour to take \r\nconcrete steps in promoting multilateralism in line with \r\nthe principles and objectives of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and international law. There is no \r\ngreater challenge today than to bring about a \r\ndemocratic and strengthened United Nations for the \r\nbenefit of all our peoples. \r\n The meeting rose at 1.10 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n"
