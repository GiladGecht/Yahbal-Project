(Bahrain) \r\n \r\n \r\n The meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 102 (continued) \r\n \r\n \r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the work of the \r\nOrganization (A/61/1 and Corr.1) \r\n \r\n Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): The Secretary-General has rightly pointed \r\nout in his report that the indispensable coordinating \r\nrole of the United Nations in international affairs, as \r\nthe most representative intergovernmental institution \r\nwith universal competence, is of ever-greater \r\nimportance today in this era of globalization. \r\n A record number of peacekeepers — 88,000 — \r\nhave been sent to numerous conflict zones. Tension \r\ncontinues in the Middle East. The situation in Iraq \r\ncontinues to cause a lack of stability in the region and \r\nin the world in general. Kosovo remains an extremely \r\ncomplicated situation in terms of settling the status of \r\nthat territory. The international community needs to \r\npay greater attention to the hotbeds of conflicts on the \r\nAfrican continent. The terrorist threat also continues to \r\nworsen. \r\n The Organization needs, therefore, to work to \r\nbuild up its capabilities not only to respond \r\ncollectively to modern threats and challenges, but also \r\nto prevent them. The Russian Federation, currently \r\nholding the presidency of the Group of Eight, gives \r\npriority attention to this issue. \r\n Acute global threats and challenges call for the \r\nconsolidation of collective approaches in international \r\naffairs and for further improvement of the instruments \r\nof multilateral diplomacy. Only the concerted actions \r\nof the international community, led by the United \r\nNations, can ensure security in the world within the \r\nframework of the emerging multi-polar architecture of \r\ninternational relations. Steps aimed at strengthening the \r\ndialogue between civilizations are an important part of \r\nsuch efforts. \r\n Considerable progress has already been made \r\nregarding the adaptation of the mechanisms and \r\nmethods of the work of the United Nations to new \r\nconditions, set forth by the 2005 World Summit; \r\nhowever, further work must be carried out. The main \r\ntheme of the decisions taken to achieve United Nations \r\nreform should be to increase the Organization’s overall \r\neffectiveness and strengthen its pivotal role in \r\ninternational affairs without prejudice to the \r\nintergovernmental character of this unique forum. The \r\nsuccessful realization of this task is only possible if the \r\nMember States agree as completely as possible on all \r\naspects of these transformations. \r\n Genuinely collective efforts are required to meet \r\nthe growing demand for the unique potential of the \r\nUnited Nations in the field of peacekeeping. Not all of \r\nit, as the Secretary-General rightly pointed out, is fully \r\nused. The Organization would benefit, for instance, if \r\nwe made use of the capabilities of the Military Staff \r\nCommittee and the regional organizations on the basis \r\nof the relevant provisions of the Charter. \r\nA/61/PV.25  \r\n \r\n06-56229 2 \r\n \r\n The establishment of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission is expected to help increase the \r\ncoordination and the effectiveness of international \r\nefforts in assisting countries emerging from crises. We \r\nthink it is important to ensure effective functioning of \r\nthis intergovernmental body. We intend to actively \r\nparticipate in its work. \r\n The stalling of the international disarmament \r\nprocess does not help to solve the problems in the field \r\nof non-proliferation. Collective actions are needed to \r\nbreak the impasse, given the collective nature of our \r\nsecurity concerns. \r\n The priority tasks, in our view, are ensuring the \r\nactivation of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban \r\nTreaty (CTBT), preventing the deployment of weapons \r\nin outer space and achieving a comprehensive \r\nagreement on that matter, concluding a treaty banning \r\nfissile materials production for military purposes and \r\nensuring international information security. We also \r\nneed to revitalize multilateral efforts in the area of \r\ndisarmament and arms control within the Conference \r\non Disarmament and the relevant bodies of the United \r\nNations. \r\n We think it is of primary importance to ensure the \r\nrule of law. Full implementation of this principle in \r\ninternational affairs guarantees stability in the world. \r\nOne of its key components is the fight against \r\nimpunity. In this area, priority is given to national \r\nauthorities, which, when necessary, should have the \r\npossibility of seeking the help of this Organization. We \r\nagree with the Secretary-General that the fight against \r\nimpunity and efforts to maintain peace should \r\ncomplement each other. \r\n The record of international justice, in our view, \r\nhas not been entirely successful. The activities of the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former \r\nYugoslavia have revealed serious shortcomings: \r\npolitical bias in decisions and the significant cost of \r\ncourt proceedings. We have great expectations for the \r\nInternational Criminal Court. We anticipate that this \r\nbody of justice will make a substantial contribution to \r\nthe fight against impunity. \r\n Russia views the formation of an effective system \r\nof security, with the United Nations holding a central \r\ncoordinating role, as a key aspect in the fight against \r\ninternational terrorism. The recent adoption of the \r\nGlobal Counter-Terrorism Strategy provides great \r\npotential for reinforcing the systemic work of the \r\ninternational community in the field of fighting terror. \r\nWe support the point raised in the report that describes \r\nthe need to build Member States’ counter-terrorist \r\ncapabilities through the establishment of an effective \r\nsystem of technical assistance. We believe, however, \r\nthat the major focus here should be the improvement of \r\nthe quality of the dialogue between States and the \r\nSecurity Council committees established to fight \r\nterrorism, as well as on enhancing the capacity of the \r\nUnited Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. \r\n We agree that now, after the adoption of the \r\nGlobal Strategy against Terrorism, it is a matter of \r\npriority to finish the work on the draft of the \r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism. \r\nIntensified efforts are needed to accomplish this as \r\nsoon as possible. \r\n On the whole, we are satisfied with the analysis \r\nof the activities of the Organization in the field of \r\nhuman rights protection. More specifically, we share \r\nthe opinion that it is necessary to establish and \r\nstrengthen national systems for the protection and \r\npromotion of human rights. Such efforts are needed to \r\nfacilitate the strengthening of the international regime \r\nof human rights protection, which is, in our firm belief, \r\na major long-term priority in this field. \r\n The establishment by the Human Rights Council \r\nof two intersessional intergovernmental open-ended \r\nworking groups on the mechanism of universal \r\nperiodic reviews and on optimization of the system of \r\nspecial procedures — legacies of the Sub-Commission \r\nof the Commission on Human Rights — are \r\nundoubtedly positive events. We hope that the working \r\ngroups will eventually be able to start their work \r\nwithin the proposed format, as envisaged by the \r\nrelevant resolutions of the first session of the Council, \r\nbut without limiting themselves to holding informal \r\nconsultations on the issues within their mandate. \r\n Today, the focus on the issues of development \r\nand the strengthening of democracy, as well as the \r\ninteraction between the United Nations and civil \r\nsociety, based on a broad range of issues on the \r\ninternational agenda, has become more important than \r\never and deserves special consideration by taking into \r\naccount the importance and scope of the issues. I \r\nwould like to highlight the major point, namely, the \r\nneed to have transparent, unbiased and objective \r\ndiscussions of the entire range of issues, in accordance \r\n A/61/PV.25\r\n \r\n3 06-56229 \r\n \r\nwith the United Nations Charter and guided by the \r\nprinciples of universality. \r\n On the whole, we share the positive assessments \r\nof the Secretary-General of the work done to fulfil the \r\ndecisions of the Summit aimed at increasing the \r\neffectiveness of social and economic activities of the \r\nentire United Nations system, and of efforts to achieve \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). At the \r\nsame time, the Organization’s potential, in particular, \r\nits operational segment, should be used more \r\neffectively in order to assist the countries in need. We \r\nbelieve it is impermissible to politicize the work of \r\nUnited Nations operational funds and programmes. \r\n In addition, we note the importance of resolving \r\nthe problem of overall system coherence and we are \r\nlooking forward to the report of the high-level panel on \r\nthat issue. We are willing to have substantive \r\ndiscussions of all realistic proposals. \r\n We note with satisfaction that the issues of \r\nsustainable development and the global problems of \r\nhealth care are among the priorities in the report. We \r\nshare the correct conclusion of the Secretary-General \r\nthat, since natural disasters have become more \r\nfrequent, it is necessary to build up the capabilities of \r\nthe Organization that are aimed at decreasing the threat \r\nand enhancing readiness. On our part, we intend to \r\nmake practical contributions to resolving such acute \r\nglobal problems as climate change, eradication of \r\ninfectious diseases and a sustainable energy supply. \r\nThe last two issues are the priorities of the Russian \r\npresidency of the Group of Eight. \r\n The report also gives a fairly balanced \r\npresentation of humanitarian issues. Justifiable \r\nemphasis is given to the establishment of the Central \r\nEmergency Response Fund, which is called upon to \r\nensure reliable access to financial resources for \r\npreserving lives during the earliest stages of \r\nhumanitarian response and in planning long-term \r\nhumanitarian operations. \r\n We deem it necessary for the General Assembly \r\nto draft the relevant resolution, with due regard for the \r\nviews of the Secretary-General favouring a cluster \r\napproach to ensure greater coherence in the work of \r\nhumanitarian operations in the field. The report \r\nhighlights the difficulties in enhancing humanitarian \r\ncoordination at the local level, which are related, in our \r\nview, to the difficult task of elaborating suitable \r\nmethods of cooperation with national Governments \r\nthat protect the sovereign right of the countries to \r\nindependently determine the priorities of the \r\nhumanitarian response and ways to provide it. \r\n We agree with the recommendation favouring, in \r\naccordance with existing commitments, the provision \r\nof international assistance towards fulfilment of the \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development programme, \r\nspecifically as regards the reduction of the debt burden \r\nand fighting HIV/AIDS. \r\n We attach great significance to improving and \r\nenhancing the functional effectiveness and \r\ntransparency of the administrative, financial and \r\npersonnel units of the United Nations, as well as to \r\nimplementing the General Assembly decisions on the \r\nreform of the Organization. The most important issues \r\nof the ongoing reform are increasing the efficiency of \r\nthe Secretariat, ensuring greater professionalism and \r\nproductivity of the staff, clear accountability and \r\nresponsibility to Member States for the end results. \r\n Mr. McNee (Canada): Let me begin by paying \r\ntribute to the Secretary-General for his excellent report \r\non the work of the Organization. He once again has \r\nshown us a vision of the future, as well as a road map \r\nfor getting there. As he ends his remarkable tenure as \r\nSecretary-General, it is appropriate that the report also \r\ntakes stock of our collective accomplishments to date. \r\nThe report leaves no doubt that the Secretary-General \r\nleaves behind an Organization that is stronger and \r\nmore effective than the one he found ten years ago. We \r\nthank him for the persistence, energy and clarity of \r\npurpose that he has brought to this task. \r\n More than anything, the report of the \r\nSecretary-General validates the truism that reform is \r\nnot a one-time event, but rather an ongoing process \r\nthat requires sustained commitment. On the one hand, \r\nwe have made progress in recent years. The design and \r\nestablishment of the Peacebuilding Commission, the \r\ncreation of the new Human Rights Council and the \r\nrecent adoption of a counter-terrorism strategy are \r\naccomplishments in their own right and a testament to \r\nour shared determination to tackle contemporary \r\nchallenges. \r\n On the other hand, much work is still needed to \r\nbring to life those innovations in a meaningful way. \r\nThe Millennium Development Goals are perhaps most \r\nillustrative of that point. On the one hand, they have \r\nfocused the world’s attention as never before on a \r\nconcrete set of objectives for improving the lives of the \r\nA/61/PV.25  \r\n \r\n06-56229 4 \r\n \r\nworld’s poorest people. On the other hand, \r\nimprovements in nutrition, sanitation, education and \r\nmedical care remain elusive for a full fifth of the \r\nworld’s population, increasing pressure on the \r\ndevelopment architecture of the United Nations. \r\n That, coupled with the increased demand for \r\nUnited Nations field operations, especially peace \r\nsupport and humanitarian operations, has not only \r\nchanged the nature of the Organization, but also \r\nenlarged managerial risk within it. Above all, those \r\ndemands underscore the urgency of a reinvigorated and \r\nrenewed United Nations. \r\n In that regard, Canada welcomes the emphasis of \r\nthe Secretary-General on the interconnectedness of \r\ndevelopment, peacekeeping, peacebuilding, human \r\nrights and the rule of law, all of which are central to \r\nlong-term global stability. We further welcome the new \r\nfocus in this year’s report on the role of non-State \r\nactors, whose partnership is essential to the success of \r\nthe United Nations. \r\n As we look at the agenda for the sixty-first \r\nsession of the General Assembly, it is clear that there \r\nwill be no shortage of work for Member States and the \r\nprincipal organs of the United Nations. But several \r\nchallenges stand out as deserving special attention in \r\nthe months ahead. \r\n First, there is an urgent need to ensure that the \r\nnew institutions we have created — the Human Rights \r\nCouncil and the Peacebuilding Commission — get off \r\nto the right start. In the coming months, a key priority \r\nfor Canada will be to ensure that the working methods \r\nof those bodies are flexible enough to succeed in the \r\ntask at hand. In particular, it is imperative that the \r\nHuman Rights Council move beyond the politicized \r\nsquabbles that hobbled and discredited its predecessor, \r\nthat the universal periodic review mechanism is \r\nimplemented effectively and that stronger links are \r\nbuilt between the normative and the operational human \r\nrights work of the Organization. \r\n Similarly, the Peacebuilding Commission, which \r\nwill convene its first country-specific meetings in two \r\nweeks time, must produce a discernable improvement \r\nin the Organization’s post-conflict peacebuilding \r\nrecord. Member States must show themselves capable \r\nof contributing to the solution, by bringing together the \r\nfragmented operational capacity within the \r\nOrganization and the political authority of the principal \r\norgans. Embracing that informal coordination function \r\nis key to ensuring that the countries it engages with do \r\nnot suffer the fate of Timor-Leste and other \r\npost-conflict societies that have resolved conflicts only \r\nto relapse into a new round of violence within a few \r\nshort years. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n The second critical piece of unfinished business \r\nwill be to advance Secretariat and management reforms \r\nin order to enable the effective pursuit of a shared \r\nagenda with real results. \r\n In this regard, one of the most important reform \r\nmeasures to have been put in place during the \r\nSecretary-General’s term in office is that of results-\r\nbased budgeting. That system should be expanded. \r\nSimilarly, stronger, more independent oversight \r\nmechanisms and more robust accountability are key \r\npriorities for this session. Finally, we look forward to \r\nmaking progress in reforming human resource \r\nmanagement with a view to developing the talented, \r\nmobile and integrated workforce that the Organization \r\nrequires. \r\n It has been said that we live in a world of new \r\nthreats and old institutions. It is clear from the tenth \r\nand final report of the Secretary-General on the work \r\nof the Organization that we owe him a debt of gratitude \r\nfor having transformed this institution so that it can \r\nbetter confront current challenges. As we move \r\nforward, the Assembly can rest assured that Canada \r\nremains fully committed to continuing the reforms that \r\nthe Secretary-General has set in motion with a view to \r\nachieving our shared vision of a more effective United \r\nNations and a more peaceful, prosperous world. \r\n Mr. Kapoma (Zambia): My delegation joins \r\nothers in congratulating the Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Kofi Annan, on his good report contained in \r\ndocument A/61/1. The report provides us with a clear \r\nbasis for our deliberations. My delegation is pleased \r\nthat the report gives a broad view of various issues that \r\naffect humankind. These issues include development, \r\npeace and security, human rights, the rule of law, \r\nhumanitarian law and the strengthening of the United \r\nNations. \r\n Zambia reaffirms its support for multilateralism \r\nas a platform on the basis of which issues of global \r\nconcern should be resolved. We agree that a new vision \r\nof collective security is required through which States \r\nMembers of the United Nations should address threats \r\n A/61/PV.25\r\n \r\n5 06-56229 \r\n \r\nsuch as war, terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, \r\norganized crime, infectious diseases, extreme poverty \r\nand environmental degradation. \r\n With regard to the ongoing reform of the \r\nUnited Nations, Zambia believes that it should address \r\nthe concerns of Member States, especially developing \r\ncountries. We believe that global partnership for \r\ndevelopment will facilitate fair participation in the \r\nglobal market by the developing and least developed \r\ncountries. We call for support from the international \r\ncommunity in the areas of trade and investment — \r\nareas with regard to which developing countries hope \r\nto attain the sustainable targets set out in the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. In this regard, we \r\ncommend the Secretary-General for having launched, \r\nin July 2000, the Global Compact. Zambia welcomes \r\nthat development initiative. We believe that the Global \r\nCompact will assist our country in its development \r\nefforts in many ways. \r\n The 2005 World Summit Outcome Document \r\n(resolution 60/1) reaffirmed our commitment to \r\nstrengthening the United Nations with a view to \r\nenhancing its authority and efficiency, as well as its \r\ncapacity to address global issues effectively, in \r\naccordance with the purposes and principles of the \r\nCharter. World leaders reaffirmed the central position \r\nof the General Assembly as the chief deliberative, \r\npolicymaking and representative organ of our \r\nOrganization. It is for this reason that we should ensure \r\nthat measures to strengthen the role of the General \r\nAssembly are adopted at this session. \r\n Regarding the Security Council, a body charged \r\nwith the responsibility for maintaining international \r\npeace and security, Zambia reaffirms the need for its \r\nreform, in terms of both its enlargement and its \r\nworking methods. In this regard, Zambia aligns itself \r\nwith the well-known position taken by the African \r\nUnion on this matter. Indeed, the Council should be \r\nreformed so that it becomes more democratic, \r\ntransparent and responsive to the challenges of the \r\ntwenty-first century. In his report “In larger freedom” \r\n(A/59/2005), the Secretary-General emphasized that \r\nthe reform of the United Nations would not be \r\ncomplete without the reform of the Security Council. \r\nWe agree with him. \r\n The protection of human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms is important in the socio-economic \r\ndevelopment of any civilization, just as upholding the \r\ntenets of good governance is of cardinal importance for \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security. In \r\nthis regard, Zambia reaffirms its commitment to \r\nsupport the work of the newly established Human \r\nRights Council. As a member of that Council, Zambia \r\ncommits itself to ensuring that it is effective and \r\nefficient. \r\n Other issues of concern to my delegation include \r\nextreme poverty and disease. The number of people \r\nliving with or affected by HIV/AIDS and the number \r\nof deaths caused by AIDS have continued to grow \r\nglobally. Zambia, like many other developing countries \r\nadversely affected by HIV/AIDS, malaria and \r\ntuberculosis, supports efforts by the international \r\ncommunity to combat those diseases. We therefore \r\nappeal to the international community to honour the \r\ncommitments made in the context of various forums \r\naimed at increasing and enhancing aid to developing \r\ncountries. The fight against HIV/AIDS is a global one \r\nwhich must be sustained by the international \r\ncommunity at all levels. It is, indeed, a fight which \r\nmust be won if the future is to be brighter and more \r\nassured for coming generations. \r\n In conclusion, Zambia believes that the \r\nattainment of the Millennium Development Goals will \r\ndepend on Member States’ political will. We believe \r\nthat development, security and human rights are \r\nimportant and that they reinforce each other. There is a \r\nneed, therefore, for the global partnership for \r\ndevelopment to achieve the agreed Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. In the Millennium Declaration, \r\nworld leaders expressed confidence that humanity \r\ncould make measurable progress towards peace, \r\nsecurity, disarmament, human rights, democracy and \r\ngood governance. Let us therefore rise to the challenge \r\nand ensure the fulfilment of those objectives. \r\n Mr. Hannesson (Iceland): The annual report \r\n(A/61/1) of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, on \r\nthe work of the Organization is an excellent overview \r\nof achievements during the past year — and, indeed, of \r\nearlier achievements — as well as of the complex \r\nchallenges facing us. It serves as a clear reminder — \r\nfor some, it might be a revelation — that the United \r\nNations is not a talking shop. As we debate this report, \r\nthere are 30,000 civilian staff serving in the field and \r\n65,000 troops and military observers, 7,500 police \r\nofficers and more than 15,000 international and local \r\ncivilian personnel serving in 15 peacekeeping \r\noperations and three special political or peacebuilding \r\nA/61/PV.25  \r\n \r\n06-56229 6 \r\n \r\nmissions, to mention only one important aspect of \r\nUnited Nations operations, peace and security. The \r\nreport also helps us to maintain a focus on the main \r\nissue: the need for good governance and accountability, \r\nboth within the Organization and in Member States. \r\n Strengthening the United Nations will continue to \r\nbe one of the principal tasks at the sixty-first session of \r\nthe General Assembly. Certainly, real progress was \r\nmade during the previous session with the \r\nestablishment of the new Human Rights Council, the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and the Central Emergency \r\nResponse Fund. However, we have only established the \r\nframework; the real work is still ahead of us. Iceland \r\ntrusts that the new mechanisms, along with the \r\ndetermination of Member States, will contribute to the \r\nstrengthening of the United Nations. \r\n We concur with the Secretary-General that reform \r\nof the United Nations should include reform of the \r\nSecurity Council. As stated on many occasions, Iceland \r\nwants comprehensive reform of the Security Council in \r\nterms of both expansion and working methods. Both \r\nthe permanent and non-permanent seats on the Council \r\nshould increase in number in order to better reflect \r\ntoday’s world. \r\n In her statement in the general debate last week \r\n(see A/61/PV.20), the Foreign Minister of Iceland \r\nemphasized development issues, and in particular \r\nsustainable development. The Foreign Minister \r\nreaffirmed Iceland’s strong commitment to the Doha \r\nDevelopment Agenda. Iceland sees the suspension of \r\nthe global trade talks as a major setback. We welcome \r\nand support international efforts to provide debt relief \r\nto the poorest countries. We also applaud those \r\ncountries that have committed themselves to increasing \r\ntheir official development assistance. Over the next \r\nthree years, Iceland’s development assistance will \r\nnearly triple, and we are determined to do even more. \r\n Iceland supports what Ambassador Kirsti \r\nLintonen of Finland said earlier today (see A/61/PV.24) \r\nabout the global response to HIV/AIDS and the urgent \r\nneed for concerted action in all areas with regard to the \r\ndevelopment of the African continent. Indeed, the bulk \r\nof Iceland’s development cooperation is with African \r\ncountries. \r\n We want to see more determined efforts by \r\ndevelopment partners and United Nations agencies to \r\npursue gender equality. In that connection, we suggest \r\nthat the work of the United Nations Development Fund \r\nfor Women must be given more weight within the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n We agree with the Secretary-General that a major \r\nchallenge for all countries in the years ahead is the \r\ndevelopment of new and sustainable energy sources. \r\nIceland will continue to contribute to work in that \r\nfield. \r\n The protection and promotion of fundamental \r\nhuman rights is one of the primary aims of the \r\nUnited Nations. The Secretary-General notes in his \r\nreport the significantly increased importance of human \r\nrights in the work of the Organization. Iceland \r\nwelcomes that development. The establishment of the \r\nHuman Rights Council is an example of such progress. \r\nIn that connection, it is important that the universal \r\nperiodic review system of the new Human Rights \r\nCouncil be up and running soon. Member States have \r\naccepted the fact that we have the responsibility to \r\nprotect all people from genocide, war crimes, ethnic \r\ncleansing and crimes against humanity. Now we have \r\nto make sure that we fulfil that responsibility. \r\n The United Nations is the premier international \r\nOrganization responsible for maintaining peace and \r\nsecurity. That is a complex, multidimensional task. The \r\nUnited Nations has begun to put more emphasis on \r\npreventing conflict before it develops. Indeed, that is in \r\nline with the holistic approach that we have \r\nincreasingly taken in our work. There can be no \r\nsecurity without development and no development \r\nwithout security, as has so often been said in this Hall. \r\n For the past decade — and especially since \r\n11 September 2001 — we have been confronted with \r\nterrorism, which now constitutes one of the major \r\nthreats to international peace and security. While \r\nwelcoming the new United Nations Global \r\nCounter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288), \r\nadopted by consensus in the General Assembly, Iceland \r\nemphasizes that it is important that Member States \r\nagree on the next step: a comprehensive convention on \r\ninternational terrorism. We need a concerted effort — \r\nincluding at the highest political levels in capitals — in \r\norder to reach agreement on the outstanding issues \r\nrelated to a draft comprehensive convention. \r\n Reining in the proliferation of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction and reinvigorating disarmament initiatives \r\nare also essential to long-term peace and security. \r\nSadly, the 2005 World Summit, the Review Conference \r\nof the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\n A/61/PV.25\r\n \r\n7 06-56229 \r\n \r\nNuclear Weapons and the Conference to Review \r\nProgress Made in the Implementation of the \r\nProgramme of Action to Prevent, Combat and \r\nEradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light \r\nWeapons in All Its Aspects yielded no results in that \r\nregard. The Secretary-General is right to point out the \r\ndanger of terrorism linked to weapons of mass \r\ndestruction. Iceland supports his call for more \r\nconcerted action on small arms, which cause \r\nintolerable destruction among large sections of the \r\nworld’s population. \r\n Madam President, your predecessor, Mr. Jan \r\nEliasson, repeatedly reminded us that the United \r\nNations and multilateralism are indispensable in our \r\nworld today, where threats are often global in scale. All \r\nof us need to be reminded of that. Indeed, we agree \r\nwith what Ambassador Munir Akram of Pakistan said \r\non the subject earlier in this debate, at the 24th plenary \r\nmeeting. The United Nations will continue to need \r\nvisionary, courageous and skilful leadership. \r\n During his 10 years at the helm of the Secretariat, \r\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, has played a \r\nleading role in “bringing new life to the Organization”, \r\nto quote the Norwegian Nobel Committee. As this is \r\nMr. Annan’s last report on the work of the United \r\nNations, I take this opportunity to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his leadership and for working tirelessly — \r\nto quote the Nobel Committee once again — “for a \r\nbetter organized and more peaceful world”. \r\n Mr. Kazykhanov (Kazakhstan): First of all, I \r\nwould like to congratulate you, Madam President, on \r\nyour election to your high office and to express \r\nconfidence that under your skilful stewardship, the \r\nsixty-first session of the General Assembly will be \r\nsuccessful and fruitful. \r\n I also take this opportunity to pay tribute to the \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his \r\ncomprehensive report (A/61/1), which not only \r\ndescribes achievements and problems encountered in \r\nthe areas of development, security and human rights, \r\nbut also elaborates on new trends in the global \r\ninterrelationship, such as interactions with civil society \r\nand the business community. \r\n Kazakhstan supports a multipronged strategy \r\naimed at preventing the proliferation of weapons of \r\nmass destruction. Real progress in that area is possible \r\nif all Member States fulfil their obligations regarding \r\nnuclear disarmament and the vertical and horizontal \r\nnon-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. \r\nKazakhstan is convinced that the international \r\ncommunity, particularly the nuclear-weapon States, \r\nshould encourage in every possible way the \r\nestablishment of internationally recognized nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zones in various parts of the world. The \r\nestablishment of such zones promotes international \r\npeace and security. \r\n We have no doubt that the signing, in \r\nSemipalatinsk in September 2006, of the Treaty on a \r\nNuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia is a crucial \r\nbreakthrough in the efforts to ensure regional and \r\nglobal stability and security. The Central Asian States \r\nare ready to continue consultations with the permanent \r\nmembers of the Security Council on the issue of that \r\nTreaty’s entry into force. \r\n Kazakhstan firmly supports peacekeeping \r\nactivities and international efforts to enhance the \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping capacity. \r\n We commend the establishment of a newly \r\nelected body within the United Nations system — the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission — that was set up thanks to \r\nthe intensive efforts of all delegations, which were able \r\nto reach a compromise through negotiations. \r\n Convinced that combating terrorism is a top \r\npriority, Kazakhstan commends the launch of the \r\nGlobal Counter-Terrorism Strategy. We view the five \r\npillars of the concept of counter-terrorism action as \r\nintegral elements of the efforts to avert the threat of \r\nterrorism. Kazakhstan believes that international \r\ncooperation to fight terrorism should be developed in \r\nfull conformity with the provisions of the United \r\nNations Charter and the norms of international law. \r\n With illegal routes of delivery of Afghan drugs \r\nfrom Asia to Europe running through its territory, \r\nKazakhstan makes every effort to address that threat. \r\nThe fight can be effective only if we join our efforts \r\nand mobilize the resources of the United Nations and \r\nits specialized agencies. It is precisely for that reason \r\nthat Kazakhstan has supported the United Nations \r\ninitiative to set up in Kazakhstan a Central Asian \r\nregional information and coordination centre to fight \r\nillegal drug trafficking. \r\n We would like to express gratitude to the Asian \r\ncountries for supporting the Conference on Interaction \r\nand Confidence-Building Measures in Asia, which \r\nundoubtedly strengthens stability and confidence-\r\nA/61/PV.25  \r\n \r\n06-56229 8 \r\n \r\nbuilding measures in Asia and will create favourable \r\nconditions for interaction in the interests of the \r\nprosperity and sustainable development of our \r\ncountries. \r\n Development issues should continue to be among \r\nthe priority items of the agenda of the principal bodies \r\nof the United Nations. The implementation of the 2005 \r\nWorld Summit Outcome will remain an important \r\npriority for the Organization in the coming period. \r\nKazakhstan is committed to its undertakings regarding \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals and works \r\ncontinuously to implement its own long-term \r\nstrategies — “Kazakhstan 2030” — and an innovative \r\nindustrial economic development programme. The \r\nGovernment’s main objective in the area of economic \r\npolicies is to ensure that Kazakhstan joins the ranks of \r\nthe most competitive economies. \r\n Regional integration is an adequate way to meet \r\nthe challenges of the modern world. Kazakhstan \r\nattaches great importance to cooperation with States on \r\na broad range of issues within the framework of the \r\nCommonwealth of Independent States, the Eurasian \r\nEconomic Community, the Organization of Economic \r\nCooperation and other regional economic \r\norganizations. In April 2007, Kazakhstan will host the \r\nsixty-third session of the United Nations Economic and \r\nSocial Commission for Asia and the Pacific. \r\n As the world’s largest landlocked country, \r\nKazakhstan urges the international community, and \r\nabove all the developed countries, to make every effort \r\nto meet the needs of the least developed and \r\ndeveloping landlocked countries. Kazakhstan stands \r\nfor the global partnership for development through the \r\nestablishment of an open, rule-based, predictable and \r\nnon-discriminatory trade and financial system. \r\n Kazakhstan trusts that the United Nations will \r\ncontinue to play a leading role in coordinating relief \r\noperations and believes that the establishment of the \r\nCentral Emergency Response Fund will allow the \r\nOrganization to launch relief operations in the early \r\ndays of crises and ensure more adequate distribution of \r\nrelief. Kazakhstan was among the first countries to \r\nmake a voluntary contribution to the Fund. \r\n Kazakhstan views the establishment of the United \r\nNations Human Rights Council as an important step in \r\nthe process of reforming the Organization and the \r\nefforts to enhance its action to protect human rights. In \r\nour view, that body should focus on the most burning \r\nhuman rights issues on the basis of an unbiased and \r\nobjective analysis of situations throughout the world \r\nand the provision of effective recommendations. \r\n We pay close attention to the promotion of \r\ndemocracy, the building of civil society and the \r\nenhancement of inter-ethnic and inter-faith accord in \r\nthe country. \r\n We express our appreciation to all States that \r\nhave supported Kazakhstan’s candidature for the \r\npresidency of the Organization for Security and \r\nCooperation in Europe in 2009. The Government of \r\nKazakhstan’s policy to maintain and promote a climate \r\nof tolerance and accord in society constitutes an \r\nintegral part of our international efforts to foster the \r\nculture of peace and dialogue among civilizations. \r\n It is no accident that Kazakhstan has hosted a \r\nforum of leaders of world and traditional religions. The \r\nsecond congress has just completed its deliberations in \r\nAstana. Religious leaders adopted a declaration calling \r\nfor an active dialogue among religions. We cannot \r\nallow the use of religious differences as an instrument \r\nof hatred and strife, and we have to save humanity \r\nfrom a global clash of religions and cultures. The \r\ncongress has become Kazakhstan’s contribution to \r\nglobal dialogue among religions. \r\n As stated in the report under consideration, “if \r\nhistory judges 2005 for its promises, then 2006 must be \r\njudged on implementation” (A/61/1, para. 27). We \r\nstrongly believe that this year and upcoming years \r\nmust be an era of implementation of goals we have \r\nalready set up. \r\n Mr. Le Luong Minh (Viet Nam): At the outset, \r\non behalf of the Vietnamese delegation, I would like to \r\nexpress our sincere gratitude to Secretary-General Kofi \r\nAnnan for his annual report on the work of the \r\nOrganization. We take note with satisfaction that the \r\nreport highlights the goals of development and \r\nachieving peace and security as the first priorities on \r\nthe agenda of the Organization. We welcome the \r\nincorporation of the report on the progress made in \r\nimplementing the Millennium Declaration into the \r\nSecretary-General’s report. \r\n We are pleased to note that cooperation for \r\ndevelopment has enjoyed a higher priority on the \r\nagenda of the United Nations and that achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) has been \r\nplaced at the core of the United Nations global \r\n A/61/PV.25\r\n \r\n9 06-56229 \r\n \r\nactivities. That corresponds to the priority attached to \r\nthe achievement of the MDGs by Governments and \r\npeoples around the world, as mentioned in the report. \r\nWhile noting, on the one hand, the achievements \r\nrecorded — such as the drop in the world’s proportion \r\nof people living in extreme poverty; the reduction in \r\nthe child mortality rates in developing countries; the \r\nincrease in the number of people having access to \r\nimproved sanitation; the increase in the primary \r\nenrolment ratios in developing regions of the world; \r\nand the level of commitment of not only the \r\nGovernments, but also the general, public and the \r\npolitical momentum resulting therefrom — we share \r\nthe concern of the Secretary-General that progress has \r\nbeen uneven and that the ongoing levels of human \r\ndeprivation remain staggering. The statistics he has \r\noffered in many areas are in fact daunting. \r\n One year has elapsed since our leaders adopted \r\nthe Outcome Document of the 2005 World Summit, in \r\nwhich important commitments were made in order to \r\nenable developing countries to achieve the \r\ninternationally agreed development goals and \r\nobjectives, including the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. The commitments are many and concrete, \r\nranging from embedding the global goals into country-\r\nlevel processes to new targets in most important areas \r\nof activity. The Secretary-General has called 2005 a \r\nyear of commitments.  \r\n We welcome the fact that to help implement these \r\ncommitments a number of positive steps have been \r\nundertaken, including the Multilateral Debt Relief \r\nInitiative and the timetables set by many countries of \r\nthe Organization for Economic Cooperation and \r\nDevelopment (OECD) to meet the official development \r\nassistance (ODA) target of 0.7 per cent of gross \r\nnational product income by 2015. Looking back at the \r\nimplementation of those commitments over the past \r\nyear, however, we share the view that, in spite of some \r\nadvances, progress is modest and too incomplete. The \r\nincrease in the level of ODA is far from enough to \r\nsupport real ground-level investment in the neediest \r\ncountries; the suspension of the Doha development \r\nround caused further disappointment. \r\n Developing countries continue to suffer from \r\nhardships caused by the pressure of globalization and \r\nstrengthened protectionism in a number of developed \r\ncountries. A global partnership for development is yet \r\nto be seen. Partnership for development has been \r\nchosen as the theme of the sixty-first session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. It is the view of my delegation that \r\nat this session we have to focus on mobilizing further \r\npolitical will to undertake concrete action to implement \r\nour commitments. Our delegation looks forward to \r\ncontributing to this process. \r\n The past year saw both bright and dark spots in \r\nthe world’s overall peace and security picture. They \r\nincluded the conclusion of the peacekeeping operation \r\nin Sierra Leone and its transformation to a \r\npeacebuilding mission, and the regression towards \r\nviolence in Timor-Leste just one year after the United \r\nNations pulled its last soldiers out of that country in \r\nMay 2005. Prolonged armed conflicts and civil wars \r\ncontinued to threaten the lives of millions of people \r\nand pushed many others into miserable conditions. The \r\nrecent conflict in Lebanon added another dark spot to \r\nthe picture. The performance, progress and \r\nshortcomings of the Organization in bringing peace and \r\nsecurity to the countries concerned have been analysed \r\nin the report. \r\n Let me reaffirm our view that conflict and tension \r\ncan be resolved only through dialogue and negotiation \r\non the basis of mutual trust and understanding, not \r\nthrough unilateral actions. The crucial role of the \r\nUnited Nations in the maintenance of peace and \r\nsecurity must be reaffirmed and further enhanced. \r\n Terrorism continues to pose a dangerous threat to \r\npeace and security. We reaffirm our strong \r\ncondemnation of acts of terrorism in all its forms and \r\nmanifestations. We support the Secretary-General’s call \r\nfor the international community to continue to work \r\ntogether to confront and defeat terrorism. In our \r\nopinion, the fight against terrorism can be won only \r\nthrough comprehensive and balanced measures \r\nconducted in full conformity with the principles of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter and international law. \r\nFurthermore, this fight should avoid any application of \r\nselectivity and double standards, and the root causes of \r\nterrorism need to be fully addressed. \r\n Taking note of the adoption of the United Nations \r\nGlobal Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288), \r\nwe look forward to working with other delegations \r\nwith a view to the early conclusion of a comprehensive \r\nconvention on international terrorism. \r\n It has been the shared conviction of Member \r\nStates that the United Nations should be reformed in \r\norder to improve its effectiveness, democratization and \r\nmodes of operation on the basis of the fundamental \r\nA/61/PV.25  \r\n \r\n06-56229 10 \r\n \r\nprinciples enshrined in the Charter. While welcoming \r\ninitial successes in the United Nations reform process, \r\nsuch as the establishment of the Human Rights Council \r\nand the Peacebuilding Commission, we realize that \r\nmuch remains to be done. Measures are needed to \r\nconsolidate the central role and power of the General \r\nAssembly. The Economic and Social Council must be \r\nreformed to be able to better support the economic and \r\nsocial development activities of Member States. We \r\nregret the delay in this connection and pledge to work \r\nwith other delegations towards an early solution. \r\n The Security Council should be reformed in \r\nterms of both its composition and its methods of work \r\nin order to ensure that it really represents the concerns \r\nand interests of all United Nations Member States, as \r\nstipulated in the Charter. In this connection, I would \r\nlike again to state our view that Council membership \r\nshould be expanded in both categories and that \r\ndeveloping countries should be more adequately \r\nrepresented on the Council. \r\n Mr. Mbuende (Namibia): I would like to \r\ncongratulate the Secretary-General on the presentation \r\nof an excellent report on the work of the Organization \r\n(A61/1). I am particularly intrigued by the manner in \r\nwhich the report is presented. The first thing that \r\nattracted my attention was the integration of the report \r\non progress made in the implementation of the \r\nMillennium Declaration into the report on the work of \r\nthe Organization instead of its being the subject of a \r\nseparate report, as was the case in the past. \r\n This development not only augurs well for \r\ngreater synergy and coherence in the activities of the \r\nOrganization; more important, it places the \r\ndevelopment agenda at centre stage in the work of the \r\nOrganization. That is to say, the objective of attaining \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is not an \r\nappendix, but rather a matter on which the performance \r\nof our Organization, and of us as individual Members, \r\ncan be judged. \r\n The Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) set \r\nambitious goals, but they can certainly be attained, \r\ngiven the natural, human and financial resources at our \r\ndisposal globally. The world has enough resources to \r\nmake poverty a thing of the past. The prevalence of \r\npoverty is not a result of lack of resources, but rather \r\nof how they have been deployed. They have not been \r\ndeployed in the service of humanity as a whole. The \r\nquestion we have to answer is whether we have taken \r\nthe first steps to correct that situation. We call on all \r\nMember States to translate their commitments under \r\nthe Millennium Declaration into action. \r\n We welcome the inclusion in the report of what \r\nthe Secretary-General calls “global constituencies”. \r\nThe recognition that the United Nations has to learn to \r\nwork with business and civil society is important. \r\nDevelopment is a collective responsibility. Non-State \r\nactors have experience and resources that can be \r\nharnessed and mainstreamed into the global \r\ndevelopment agenda. They are equally important \r\nplayers in peacemaking, peacekeeping and \r\npeacebuilding efforts. An effective mechanism for \r\ncooperation has thus to be put in place. The alignment \r\nof corporate activities with the broader United Nations \r\ngoals, programmes and projects promises to bring \r\ngreater benefits to all in many areas. In this regard, we \r\ncall for the strengthening of the Global Compact \r\nOffice. \r\n Notwithstanding the good efforts of the United \r\nNations and individual countries in the areas of \r\npreventive diplomacy and peacekeeping, peace remains \r\nan elusive goal in many parts of the world. The \r\nsituation in the Middle East is of grave concern. It has \r\nshown the ugly face of human destructiveness. We \r\nhope that peace will prevail over war so that the people \r\nof that region can live in good-neighbourliness, peace \r\nand harmony. \r\n The situations in a number of African countries \r\nwhere there are United Nations peacekeeping missions, \r\nsuch as the Sudan, Ethiopia and Eritrea and Côte \r\nd’Ivoire, to mention but a few, warrant our collective \r\nurgent attention in order to ensure that those operations \r\nare crowned with success. Africa is the continent that, \r\nbecause of its level of development, can least afford \r\ninternal strife. There cannot be development without \r\npeace and security. War causes and exacerbates \r\npoverty. The people of Africa are already suffering \r\nfrom poverty induced by the legacy of colonialism, \r\nunjust international economic relations, corruption, bad \r\ngovernance, environmental degradation and other \r\nnatural calamities. Certainly, the continent does not \r\nneed war on top of all that. We need peace now. \r\n Namibia will leave no stone unturned in the quest \r\nfor peace. It is against this background that we have \r\ncontributed troops, military observers and police \r\nofficers to various United Nations missions in Burundi, \r\nHaiti, Liberia, Côte d’Ivoire, Ethiopia and Eritrea, the \r\n A/61/PV.25\r\n \r\n11 06-56229 \r\n \r\nSudan and Kosovo, among others. Let us give peace a \r\nchance. Namibia is able and willing to make its \r\ncontribution to peacemaking, peacekeeping and \r\npeacebuilding. \r\n We are gravely concerned with the lack of \r\nprogress in the area of disarmament and non-\r\nproliferation. Nuclear weapons pose an especially \r\nterrible threat. In Namibia’s view, this terrible threat \r\ncan cease only when all States adhere to the Treaty on \r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and when its \r\narticle VI is fully implemented. We would like to see a \r\ntransparent multilateral process leading to the total \r\ndenuclearization of the world. Only if nuclear weapons \r\nare completely eliminated will our world be safe from \r\nthem, including from the chance that they fall into the \r\nhands of non-State actors. At the same time, Namibia \r\nwould like to reassert the right of all countries to use \r\nnuclear power for peaceful purposes. In this regard, it \r\nis important for industrialized countries to share their \r\nknowledge, technical know-how and experience with \r\ndeveloping countries. \r\n We are happy to note that 164 countries have \r\nratified the Kyoto Protocol and we urge those that have \r\nnot done so to ratify that Protocol to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change. \r\nEnvironmental degradation and the prospects of \r\nclimate change pose a serious threat to humanity. \r\nAmong other things, it has the potential to further \r\nentrench injustices and exacerbate poverty. Given the \r\nknowledge divide, rich countries have greater capacity \r\nto deal with the consequences of an environmental \r\ndisaster than poor countries. \r\n The United Nations is the hope of the poor \r\nnations. It is therefore important to speed up the work \r\non the reform of the Organization through a review of \r\nmandates and the reform of the Security Council. We \r\nhope that reform of the Security Council, apart from \r\nbroadening participation, representation and \r\ntransparency, among other things, will result in speedy \r\ndecision-making and increased resource allocation for \r\nconflicts resolutions in Africa in particular. \r\n Equally important is the reform and strengthening \r\nof the Economic and Social Council to play a central \r\nrole of promoting policy dialogue, development \r\ncooperation, post-conflict reconstruction and \r\ncoordination. We regret the delay in the adoption of a \r\nresolution on reform of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil that provides for follow-up, monitoring, and \r\nensuring accountability of Member States in fulfilling \r\ntheir commitments to the partnership for development. \r\n Mr. Ehouzou (Benin) (spoke in French): Madam \r\nPresident, my delegation is grateful to you for having \r\norganized this debate on the report on the work of the \r\nOrganization (A/61/1 and Corr.1), which the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, introduced on 19 September, \r\nat the 10th plenary meeting, in a very moving speech \r\nwhich continues to resonate in this Hall. \r\n My delegation is pleased with the exhaustive \r\nassessment of the 10 years that he has spent in his \r\nimportant office. The facts are presented with extreme \r\nmeticulousness. We are pleased to note the remarkable \r\nprogress that has been achieved and at the same time \r\nare deeply concerned about the constraints encountered \r\nby the Organization in tackling the major challenges \r\nwhich humankind had to face during this period. There \r\nis no doubt that the United Nations has contributed \r\nsignificantly to changing the face of the world. It has \r\nalso greatly changed itself in the course of this period, \r\nas reflected in the bodies created within the framework \r\nof the reform and new structures that have enriched the \r\nSecretariat so that it can rise to the level of its mission. \r\n My country shares the pride of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, who unreservedly dedicated himself to a \r\nmission with unlimited demands. Benin was also a \r\nstakeholder in the construction and orchestration of \r\nmultilateral cooperation which has been the spirit of \r\nthe major projects carried out by the Organization. \r\nThey have undeniably shaped the world at the \r\nintersection of the national interests of Member States \r\nand the ideals enshrined in the Charter. My country \r\npays tribute to the Secretary-General, who, on the \r\nsituations he has managed, has constantly striven to \r\nobtain the best possible outcomes, given the constraints \r\nand opportunities linked to the circumstances of the \r\nmoment. \r\n One of the most striking achievements of this \r\nperiod was the consensus formulation of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), which made \r\nit possible to refocus the action of the Organization on \r\nthe crucial issue of promoting development. The \r\nunequivocal commitment of the United Nations to \r\neradicate poverty is an undeniable achievement that the \r\nSecretary-General rightly considers to be \r\nunprecedented in human history.  \r\n My country, as Chair of the Least Developed \r\nCountries (LDCs) Global Coordination Bureau, \r\nA/61/PV.25  \r\n \r\n06-56229 12 \r\n \r\nwelcomes the Secretary-General’s invaluable \r\ncontribution to refocusing the United Nations agenda. \r\nIt is true that the United Nations resolutely took the \r\nlead when it came to the follow-up of the \r\nimplementation of the Brussels Programme of Action \r\nfor the Least Developed Countries for the Decade \r\n2001-2010, as we saw clearly in the High-level \r\nMeeting held in New York on 18 and 19 September \r\n2006 for a comprehensive review of the \r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action (see \r\nA/61/PV.7-9). \r\n In addition to the High-level Meeting, the very \r\nsignificant exchanges which took place during the \r\ncourse of the general debate at the sixty-first session, \r\non the theme of promoting a global partnership for \r\nachieving the Development Goals, make it possible to \r\nconsider prospects in that area in a more positive light.  \r\n Such a partnership means a clear identification of \r\nthe commitments of stakeholders and a declared \r\nwillingness to assume them in good faith. In this \r\nregard, the report of the Secretary-General takes stock \r\nof the situation, enabling Member States to know \r\nwhere we stand and what remains to be done, as well \r\nas the role that the United Nations can play for \r\nconcerted and coordinated action in this area. \r\n The report of the Secretary-General stresses the \r\nmobilization of adequate resources and the need to \r\nresume multilateral trade negotiations within the \r\nframework of the Doha round in order to establish an \r\nequitable trade regime between wealthy countries and \r\ndeveloping countries, and on the protection of the \r\nenvironment. This provides us with very specific terms \r\nof reference for the action to be taken to achieve the \r\ngoals we have set, which we must pursue today, given \r\nour improved understanding of the interdependence of \r\nMember States and its implications. \r\n That approach, highlighted in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report, inevitably places Africa at the centre \r\nof the major United Nations priorities. It must remain \r\nso for the next decade. We even dare to hope that the \r\ninternational community will continue to shoulder its \r\nsubstantial responsibility for meeting Africa’s specific \r\nneeds by more resolutely and consistently helping to \r\ncombat the ills impeding its progress, whether in \r\npromoting governance, controlling pandemics or \r\nmobilizing resources to develop its productive \r\ncapacities. \r\n The maintenance of peace and security is a \r\ncentral area of action for the United Nations; it is also \r\nthe area in which the Organization has been most \r\ncalled upon to work over the past 10 years. We have \r\nreason to welcome the great readiness shown by the \r\ninternational community to deploy human and financial \r\nresources to deal with armed conflicts and to monitor \r\nthe considerable progress made by countries emerging \r\nfrom conflict, particularly in the area of peacebuilding. \r\n We agree with the Secretary-General that much \r\nremains to be done with regard to measures to prevent \r\nthe eruption of further armed conflicts. Today, when \r\nwe are seeing the limits of the exponential growth of \r\npeacekeeping operations, the United Nations must be \r\nable to show greater effectiveness in the area of \r\nconflict prevention. Here, the recommendations made \r\nby the Secretary-General in his progress report on the \r\nprevention of armed conflict (A/60/891) are \r\nconvincingly justified. \r\n The Secretary-General’s analysis of \r\ndevelopments over the past 10 years with respect to the \r\ncrucial issues of disarmament and non-proliferation \r\nchallenges the Member States that are responsible for \r\nthe stalemate in that area since 2000. Indeed, it is \r\nregrettable that no major initiative has been taken to \r\neliminate the risk of nuclear conflagration, which \r\ncontinues to threaten humanity because of the high \r\nalert level of the forces of nuclear-weapon States and \r\nbecause they maintain considerable stocks of nuclear \r\nweapons. \r\n The Secretary-General rightly recalls the need to \r\navert the terrifying instability that would result from \r\nthe proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons \r\nof mass destruction, and particularly from their \r\nacquisition by non-State actors. In that regard, we \r\ncannot forget that Security Council resolution 1540 \r\n(2004) was adopted as a conservative measure to deal \r\nwith a legal vacuum that must be filled by negotiating \r\nan international convention on preventing the \r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction to non-\r\nState actors. \r\n With regard to small arms and light weapons, we \r\nare pleased that the Secretary-General echoed the \r\nconcerns of countries that are victims of the harmful \r\nconsequences of their uncontrolled spread, due to an \r\nillicit trade that persists despite the efforts to combat it. \r\nAt the present session, it is important for the General \r\nAssembly to agree on measures to strengthen those \r\n A/61/PV.25\r\n \r\n13 06-56229 \r\n \r\nefforts in the light of the discussions that took place at \r\nthe Review Conference held in June and July 2006. \r\n Promoting the rule of law and human rights is \r\nessential to preserve human dignity, maintain peace \r\nand promote development. We welcome the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s unfailing commitment to this cause and the \r\nvery commendable results that have characterized \r\nUnited Nations action in that regard during the 10 \r\nyears of his two terms of office. My country is a \r\nconcrete example of the international community’s \r\nachievements in this area, as can be seen by the \r\npeaceful transfer of power that took place there in \r\nMarch 2006. On behalf of the Government of Benin, I \r\ntake this opportunity to express once again, from this \r\nrostrum, the deep gratitude of the Beninese people for \r\nthe financial assistance that enabled them to hold \r\ntimely elections and to peacefully, appropriately and — \r\nI might add — very elegantly manage the situations \r\nrelated to those elections. \r\n Young democracies must continue to benefit from \r\neffective United Nations support for their \r\nconsolidation. They must be able to continue to enjoy \r\nsuch support as needed in the coming years. To that \r\nend, it is essential that, inter alia, the resources of the \r\nUnited Nations Democracy Fund be swiftly restored so \r\nthat the Fund can meet the high demand for assistance \r\nshown in its first call for project proposals, made in \r\nApril 2006. \r\n In addition, we commend the activities of the \r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for \r\nHuman Rights and fully support the implementation of \r\nits strategic plan, which would make it possible to \r\nsignificantly enhance its capacity to assist in improving \r\nthe human rights situation on the ground throughout \r\nthe world. \r\n In another area, the considerable efforts \r\nundertaken to help stricken populations and victims of \r\nnatural disasters are commendable, as are the measures \r\ntaken to ensure that such assistance can be provided \r\nmore swiftly. Here, we join in the Secretary-General’s \r\nappeal for easier access by humanitarian personnel to \r\nvictims and for ensuring victims’ rights. \r\n Finally, we once again pay tribute to the \r\nSecretary-General for having shared with Member \r\nStates the urgency of the reforms adopted at the 2005 \r\nSummit and for having supported, with his proven \r\nexpertise, the implementation of the agreed measures. \r\nWe call on Member States to continue the consultations \r\nso as to move reform forward in the areas where it is \r\nstalled so that we can make the United Nations ever \r\nmore able to fulfil its role in the survival of humanity \r\nand in the quest for suitable solutions to the problems \r\nand challenges facing us.  \r\n My country commends the great work \r\naccomplished by the Secretary-General, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Kofi Annan, at the head of the United \r\nNations. We hope that his successor will continue \r\nwithout interruption the projects that have begun for \r\nthe greater good of the peoples of the United Nations, \r\nwho continue to place their hopes in the Organization \r\nin their quest to achieve well-being and security and to \r\npreserve human dignity in the face of known and \r\nunknown threats and challenges. \r\n Mr. Bodini (San Marino): We would like to thank \r\nthe Secretary-General not only for his report on the \r\nwork of the Organization (A/61/1 and Corr.1), but also, \r\nand more important, for the outstanding job that he has \r\ndone over the past 10 years. During his tenure, the \r\nUnited Nations has had to respond to unpredictable \r\nchanges and threatening challenges, including an \r\nexplosion of pandemics worldwide, devastating natural \r\ndisasters, terrorist attacks around the world, massive \r\nstarvation among the poorest and international strife at \r\na level never before seen — all documented \r\nrelentlessly and in real time by the global media. \r\n The United Nations employs 90,000 people and \r\nhas a yearly budget of $10 billion, and thus is \r\ncomparable in scale to many international \r\nconglomerates. It is commendable that so much has \r\nbeen done with so little, but it is obvious that much \r\nmore has to be done if we are to be able to deal with \r\nthe daily challenges of our world. Greater human and \r\nfinancial resources must be deployed to deal with \r\nenvironmental crises and to fund peacekeeping \r\noperations, human rights protection efforts, the \r\nmonitoring of the peaceful use of atomic energy and \r\nother initiatives, including those aimed at providing, in \r\na fair and balanced manner, for economic growth for \r\nthe unprivileged and poor. \r\n We at the United Nations have to do more \r\nplanning so that we can be prepared to meet the social \r\nand economic needs of the world’s growing population. \r\nWe must also act decisively on all of the resolutions \r\napproved so far and monitor their implementation. \r\n Under your leadership, Madam, we must remake \r\nthe General Assembly, according to the Charter, into \r\nA/61/PV.25  \r\n \r\n06-56229 14 \r\n \r\nthe centrepiece of the United Nations structure — a \r\npragmatic and open forum, where problems can be \r\nexamined and solved in a timely manner in response to \r\nthe many crises. Moreover, I am sure that all 192 \r\nMember States in this Hall agree that the Security \r\nCouncil will be reformed in the near future. San \r\nMarino shares the wish of many among us to start \r\nanew with fresh, open and transparent negotiations. It \r\nis my belief, Madam, that under your leadership this \r\ngoal will be achieved. \r\n Mr. Maurer (Switzerland) (spoke in French): We \r\nwould like to thank the Secretary-General for his report \r\non the work of the Organization (A/61/1 and Corr.1), \r\nwhich places the activities of the United Nations in the \r\ncontext of the challenges that it has had to face \r\nfollowing the many major changes that have \r\ncharacterized the international environment over the \r\npast 10 years. The report thus provides us with a \r\nwelcome opportunity to turn our attention for a \r\nmoment away from current events and to comment on \r\nat least some of the milestones that have been reached \r\nby the United Nations in its current endeavours. \r\n Much has been said today and over the past few \r\nweeks, and I am not going to reiterate our positions on \r\nissues of peace, development, human rights or the \r\nenvironment. I will limit my comments to just three \r\nareas. \r\n My first comment concerns the structure of the \r\nreport itself, which reflects the three main areas of \r\nfocus of United Nations activities: development, which \r\nwe always understand as sustainable development — \r\nmeaning that it also needs to take into account the \r\nenvironmental dimension; peace and security; and \r\nhuman rights and democracy.  \r\n In our view, the explicit recognition of the \r\ninterdependence of those areas was a very important \r\nconceptual development of the World Summit. The \r\npotential consequences of this insight in terms of the \r\nway in which we formulate and implement policies are \r\nconsiderable, but a great deal remains to be done in \r\norder to systematically translate this new approach into \r\nour policies. The ability to work in those three areas, \r\nand to do so at both the political and operational levels, \r\nis one of the most valuable characteristics of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n Secondly, I would like to highlight the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s important ideas about the changing role of \r\nthe State — ideas that underlie many of the paragraphs \r\nof the report and even appear to be a common thread \r\nrunning through much of it. We agree with the \r\nSecretary-General’s assertion that the State has neither \r\nwithered away nor become redundant — quite the \r\ncontrary. As societies become ever more complex, as \r\nglobalization weaves an intricate fabric of relations \r\nbetween individuals and groups, regardless of borders, \r\nas significant daily activities in the economic, cultural, \r\nreligious and social spheres are liberated from direct \r\nState control, the role of the State is changing \r\nfundamentally. Under such circumstances, the State \r\ncan no longer act as an administrator; its role is to \r\nguarantee rights, and it must be at the service of \r\nindividuals and communities, acting as a forum, a \r\nregulator, an arbitrator or a mediator. \r\n The change in the perception of the State’s role is \r\nnot limited to internal policy, but also has a \r\nconsiderable impact in terms of international relations, \r\nas is clearly underscored by the notion of the \r\nresponsibility to protect, which was affirmed by heads \r\nof State or Government at the World Summit. \r\n Another direct consequence of this development \r\nfor the United Nations concerns the extent and nature \r\nof its collaboration with civil society and the business \r\nworld. The importance of this collaboration is duly \r\nreflected in the structure of the report, which devotes \r\nan entire chapter to these major global partners. We \r\nhope that the United Nations will be able to build on \r\nthe initiatives and positive experiences of recent years, \r\nand thus be able to intensify various forms of \r\ncollaboration with these essential players in an \r\natmosphere of respect for differences and in \r\naccordance with clearly defined rules. \r\n My third comment more directly concerns the \r\nUnited Nations. The Organization is today confronted \r\nwith many challenges that reflect the growing need for \r\nclose international cooperation based on law and \r\ncarried out within the framework of multilateral \r\ninstitutions. Important reform efforts are under way in \r\nthat context — reforms that must make it possible for \r\nthe United Nations to face the challenges of the \r\ntwenty-first century.  \r\n I would like to refer to just one of those current \r\nreform efforts — the one that is both the most visible \r\nto the general public and of great symbolic importance, \r\nnamely, the reform of the Security Council. The nature \r\nof contemporary challenges — as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report confirms — is such that a formula \r\n A/61/PV.25\r\n \r\n15 06-56229 \r\n \r\ninvolving a limited number of States can longer \r\nproperly respond to today’s geopolitical realities. In \r\nview of this, Switzerland feels that the expansion of the \r\nSecurity Council should be accompanied by reform of \r\nits working methods so as to make it more \r\nrepresentative and transparent and to bolster the \r\nauthority of its decisions. \r\n I cannot conclude my statement on the final \r\nreport of the current Secretary-General on the work of \r\nthe Organization without reiterating my country’s \r\nsincerest thanks to the Secretary-General himself. Over \r\nthe past 10 years, he has succeeded in clearly \r\nidentifying the challenges faced by the United Nations \r\nas a result of the many and sudden upheavals in the \r\ninternational arena. He has demonstrated wisdom and \r\ntenacity in providing Member States with perceptive \r\nanalyses of such developments, together with proposals \r\nfor action and reform, which have had an important \r\nimpact on the political debate and have borne fruit. The \r\ncurrent report serves as a final notable example. We \r\nwarmly congratulate the Secretary-General. \r\n Mr. Abdalhaleem (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): We \r\nwould like to thank the Secretary-General for his \r\nimportant report on the work of the Organization. It \r\nbodes well that the General Assembly is following up \r\nthe general debate with a discussion of the report on \r\nthe work of the United Nations — an Organization in \r\nwhich our peoples have placed a great many \r\nexpectations — including its successes and failures. \r\nAlthough many decades have passed since the United \r\nNations was founded, the Organization is often unable \r\nto respond to the aspirations of the founding fathers. \r\nThis is clearly the case as far as the Security Council is \r\nconcerned; indeed, it applies specifically to the \r\nSecurity Council, which, given its current \r\nundemocratic composition, is actually an obstacle to \r\nthe achievement of democratic international relations. \r\n The United Nations cannot call for democracy in \r\nothers when it is unable to achieve real democracy for \r\nitself. Through its influential members, the Security \r\nCouncil is often a part of the problem, rather than the \r\nsolution. If the Organization is to play a new role, it, \r\nand the Security Council in particular, must be \r\nreformed. If it is not, the Organization will find itself \r\ncaught up in a vicious circle formed of private agendas \r\nand double standards.  \r\n We are following with interest the current session \r\nof the Human Rights Council in Geneva, and hope that \r\nthe new Council will not suffer the fate of the former \r\nCommission. We hope that the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission will perform its tasks without infringing \r\nupon the mandates of other United Nations organs. \r\n The Secretary-General’s report focuses on United \r\nNations cooperation with regional organizations. We \r\nhope that the Organization will put its weight behind \r\nsupport for regional organizations, saving money and \r\neffort in the process, and allowing them to solve their \r\nregional problems by themselves. In that regard, we \r\npay tribute to the excellent role being played by the \r\nAfrican Union with respect to the problem of Darfur, \r\nand hope that the international community will respect \r\nits commitments in supporting the African Union \r\nlogistically and materially so that it can complete its \r\nmandate, implement the Abuja Agreement and promote \r\nthe progress of peace and stability in my country, \r\nlaunched under the peace agreement for the southern \r\nSudan. \r\n In paying tribute to and expressing appreciation \r\nfor the role of the African Union, we warn against the \r\nhidden agendas of some great Powers to exploit the \r\nissue of Darfur as a tool of influence over the Sudan’s \r\nresources and national decisions. In that regard, if the \r\nUnited Nations is to be effective in this new globalized \r\nworld, it should shun the private agendas of some of its \r\ninfluential Members that use international forums to \r\nserve their own interests. Such behaviour poses a threat \r\nto international peace and security. \r\n We appreciate the report’s important reference to \r\nthe special needs of Africa and to support for Africa’s \r\ndevelopment, which must be a priority for the United \r\nNations. The Organization’s efforts should also be \r\nlinked to the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment, which calls for enhanced resources to be \r\ndirected to Africa, solutions to the debt problem, and \r\nspecial attention to the needs of the least developed \r\ncountries. We hope that those efforts will also be linked \r\neffectively to the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). \r\n My country attaches special importance to the \r\nMillennium Declaration and the MDGs. We hope that \r\nthe Economic and Social Council will play an \r\nimportant role in the follow-up to the commitments \r\nmade under the MDGs. We must establish indicators \r\nfor the achievement of the Goals, including analysis of \r\nthe obstacles to their implementation, so that the \r\ndeveloping countries will not be caught up in another \r\nA/61/PV.25  \r\n \r\n06-56229 16 \r\n \r\nvicious circle of squandering more time and resources. \r\nThe MDGs should not be relegated to the dustbin of \r\nhistory, as has happened for decades now to the calls \r\nfor a new international economic order. \r\n The Secretary-General’s report, although \r\ncomprehensive, does not refer to international \r\ncooperation in science and technology. We hope that \r\nthe report submitted to the General Assembly next year \r\nwill invoke the role of the United Nations in enhancing \r\ninternational cooperation in science and technology \r\namong its Members, which is a very important element \r\nin promoting sustainable social and economic \r\ndevelopment for our peoples. \r\n As the United Nations selects its new Secretary-\r\nGeneral, we hope that the ultimate choice for that \r\nimportant international post will promote the \r\neffectiveness and dynamism of the work and activities \r\nof the Organization, as well as its professionalism, \r\nneutrality and impartiality. That will strengthen the \r\nOrganization’s cooperation at this very important \r\nmoment in international relations. \r\n Mr. Zewdie (Ethiopia): My delegation expresses \r\nits appreciation to the Secretary-General for his \r\ncomprehensive and last report on the work of the \r\nOrganization during his final year in office. My \r\ndelegation welcomes especially his emphasis on the \r\nwork of the Organization in implementing the \r\nMillennium Declaration. My delegation will briefly \r\ncomment on both the development and the peace and \r\nsecurity issues highlighted in the report. \r\n It is encouraging to note that progress has been \r\nmade in implementing internationally agreed \r\ndevelopment goals. It is to be recalled that, prior to the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, the Monterrey \r\nConsensus and the World Summit on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment underlined the need for the allocation of \r\n0.7 per cent of the gross national income of the \r\ndeveloped countries to official development assistance \r\n(ODA) so that developing countries would be able to \r\nachieve internationally agreed development goals. In \r\nthat regard, it is a positive development that aggregate \r\nODA has increased to $106 billion. As a result, \r\nextreme poverty is dropping, while improvements have \r\nbeen shown in child health, sanitation, access to safe \r\nwater and primary education. \r\n That being the generally positive picture, the \r\nchallenge remains, however, that the progress is \r\nuneven. In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, the \r\nnumber of people living under the poverty line has not \r\nshown any substantial change. As the report on the \r\nworld social situation in 2005 and the world economic \r\nand social survey in 2006 have revealed, the region \r\nremains behind others in achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. We therefore agree with the \r\nSecretary-General’s statement that providing support \r\nfor Africa is a priority issue for the United Nations. \r\n My country, for its part, is striving to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. We have committed \r\nthe lion’s share of the meagre resources at our disposal \r\nto the development of infrastructure, improving the \r\nsocial sector and capacity-building, which are needed \r\nfor our development efforts to succeed. In the last three \r\nyears, our economy has registered an average growth \r\nrate of 9.5 per cent. For the same period, exports grew \r\nby 28.5 per cent on average. Primary school enrolment \r\nincreased from 30 per cent in the early 1990s to 89 per \r\ncent at present. In order to improve our capacity for \r\ndevelopment, 13 additional universities are being built. \r\nBased on those encouraging results, a second five- year \r\ndevelopment programme, known as “Programme for \r\nAccelerated and Sustained Development to End \r\nPoverty”, has been developed and is under \r\nimplementation. Alleviating poverty by meeting the \r\nMillennium Development Goals remains the \r\ncornerstone of our development programme. \r\n It is in this regard that we fully subscribe to the \r\nrecommendations of the Secretary-General, namely \r\nincorporating new targets in the MDGs — to achieve \r\nuniversal access to reproductive health by 2015, to \r\nprovide access by all that require it to HIV treatment \r\nby 2010, and to reduce the rate of biodiversity loss by \r\n2010. \r\n With regard to peace and security, the report \r\nindicates that the annual budget of the Organization \r\nallocated to peacekeeping and other field operations \r\nhas increased substantially. It also states that half of the \r\nworld’s conflicts and peacekeeping operations are in \r\nAfrica. While it is encouraging that the Organization is \r\npaying due attention to resolving conflicts in Africa, it \r\nis also an indication that the challenge to bring about \r\npeace on the continent is a tremendous one. Africa, \r\nmore than ever before, needs more resources for its \r\nown socio-economic development to improve the \r\nliving standards of its peoples. It is therefore \r\ndisappointing that conflict resolution absorbs the lion’s \r\nshare of the resources of the United Nations. \r\n A/61/PV.25\r\n \r\n17 06-56229 \r\n \r\n It is for that reason that my country has been \r\nstriving for peace and security in its region for many \r\nyears now. As is well known, Ethiopia is among the \r\ntroop- contributing countries in peacekeeping \r\noperations in our region. We are currently participating \r\nin Liberia and have successfully completed the Mission \r\nin Burundi. We have also dispatched our observers to \r\nCôte d’Ivoire. We believe that by working in close \r\ncooperation with other member countries that the \r\npeacekeeping and mediation capacities of the African \r\nUnion could be strengthened and ensured. That is why \r\nthe Secretary-General stressed in his report the need to \r\nhave the support of the international community to \r\nstrengthen national and regional efforts aimed at \r\nresolving conflicts and creating conditions for peace. \r\n Finally, let me reiterate once again that Ethiopia, \r\nas it has been doing thus far, will continue to actively \r\nparticipate in the activities of the United Nations, with \r\na view to making our world a safer and more peaceful \r\nplace. \r\n The President: I now call on the observer of the \r\nObserver State of the Holy See. \r\n Archbishop Migliore (Holy See): As we \r\nconsider the Secretary-General’s report on the work of \r\nthe Organization, my delegation would like to thank \r\nhim and his staff for their work in the field and on this \r\ncomprehensive report. \r\n As has often been said, reform is not an event but \r\na process, and this year marks an important occasion \r\naimed at ensuring that these processes continue. To that \r\nend, we welcome the Secretary-General’s efforts in \r\ncontinuing to press for reform. The creation of a \r\nmediation support capacity within the Department of \r\nPolitical Affairs is an example of how existing \r\nstructures can be successfully modified to address \r\nglobal needs. However, despite the progress made, \r\nmuch work remains to be done in many different areas. \r\n We share the Secretary-General’s views on the \r\nimportance of conflict prevention and the \r\nresponsibility to protect. At the same time, we would \r\nlike to stress the need to interconnect more explicitly \r\nand more effectively the areas of security and \r\ndevelopment. The present lack of progress in the fields \r\nof development aid and trade reform threatens \r\neveryone’s security and well-being. By contrast, the \r\nfulfilment of the Millennium Development (MDGs) \r\npromises economic progress, the alleviation of poverty, \r\na reduction in terrorism and increased social harmony. \r\n At recent conferences and meetings on \r\ndisarmament, my delegation expressed its deep concern \r\nat the stagnation of the multilateral negotiations on \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation. The United \r\nNations system as a whole should grasp this \r\nopportunity to acknowledge the links between \r\ndisarmament, development and humanitarian concerns, \r\nand commit itself to strategies and programmes to \r\nreduce the demand for arms and armed violence. \r\n In the area of humanitarian assistance, the \r\nestablishment of the Central Emergency Response \r\nFund and the innovative cluster coordination system \r\nare important modifications to the existing \r\nhumanitarian assistance system. My delegation looks \r\nforward to closely following their development. In \r\ncoordinating humanitarian relief, the United Nations \r\nshould continue to play a leading role in balancing the \r\nautonomy of civil society actors with the need to \r\nprovide effective aid to the most vulnerable. \r\n My delegation agrees with the observation made \r\nin the report that a great deal of progress has been \r\nachieved in the field of HIV/AIDS prevention, \r\ntreatment and care. Nevertheless, while the pandemic \r\nseems to be under control in certain countries, many \r\nother countries appear to be almost helpless in tackling \r\nthe spread of HIV/AIDS. We would do well to face this \r\nissue with more focused initiatives, learning, for \r\nexample, from the specific actions taken in the field of \r\nforeign debt with the highly indebted poorest countries. \r\nA concentration of our financial, logistical and human \r\nresources would enable the countries most affected by \r\nHIV/AIDS to put an end to that scourge and \r\nconsolidate the hope that humankind will overcome the \r\npandemic worldwide. \r\n While greater efforts are needed to ensure that all \r\nthe commitments of 2005 are fulfilled, it is important \r\nto understand the breadth of the commitments that \r\nwere made. The World Summit Outcome Document \r\nwas a carefully negotiated and well-crafted document \r\nthat sought to balance strongly held views. It is \r\ntherefore of the utmost importance that in \r\nimplementing this document we ensure that respect for \r\nthat delicate balance is maintained. To that end, it is \r\nimportant to reaffirm that ensuring access to \r\nreproductive health by 2015, as referenced in \r\nparagraph 24, was seen by our leaders as a means of \r\nachieving the target of reducing maternal mortality \r\nrather than as a target in and of itself. \r\nA/61/PV.25  \r\n \r\n06-56229 18 \r\n \r\n Finally, it is our sincere hope that this session of \r\nthe General Assembly will continue to move from \r\ncommitments to action and that the United Nations can \r\ncontinue the process of transforming itself into an \r\ninstitution that is ready for the challenges of the \r\ntwenty-first century. \r\n The President: In accordance with General \r\nAssembly resolution 54/195 of 17 December 1999, I \r\nnow call on the observer for the International Union for \r\nthe Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. \r\n Mr. Baghwat-Singh (International Union for the \r\nConservation of Nature and Natural Resources): The \r\nreport on the work of the Organization is always a \r\ncomprehensive document containing an overview of \r\nUnited Nations activities and programmes. The \r\nInternational Union for the Conservation of Nature and \r\nNatural Resources (IUCN) will comment on issues \r\nrelated to the environment and conservation. \r\n The General Assembly expressed concern about \r\nthe slow and uneven progress towards poverty \r\neradication and reaffirmed the international \r\ncommitment to more effectively advance the \r\nfundamental objectives of economic development with \r\na focus on implementing a global partnership for \r\ndevelopment. However, this commitment was not \r\neffectively conveyed by most States with very few \r\nreferences made to environmental concerns during the \r\nfirst two weeks of the general debate.  \r\n The International Union for the Conservation of \r\nNature and Natural Resources (IUCN) welcomes all \r\ndevelopment commitments, but emphasizes the lack of \r\ncurrent environmental commitments and the lack of \r\nurgency within such commitments. This has allowed \r\nalready slow progress to be further hampered by such \r\nfactors as the increased frequency and magnitude of \r\nnatural disasters and conflicts. The IUCN therefore \r\ncalls for even greater and a more urgent commitment \r\nfrom the international community to poverty \r\neradication and to the environmental improvements \r\nthat are fundamental in assuring and enhancing gains \r\nfor the overall well-being and economic development \r\nof the poor. \r\n The IUCN would like the United Nations to \r\nconsider providing further mandates on broad \r\nquestions regarding environmental issues. The \r\nagreements reached during informal consultations held \r\nduring the sixtieth session of the General Assembly \r\nregarding the institutional framework for the \r\nenvironmental activities of the United Nations system, \r\nincluded suggestions for enhanced coordination, \r\nimproved policy guidance, strengthened scientific \r\nknowledge, enhanced treaty compliance and better \r\nintegration of environmental activities in the economic \r\ndevelopment framework at an operational level. The \r\nIUCN increases the implementation of these ideas in \r\nsupport of potential mandates on broad environmental \r\ninterests. \r\n Moreover, the IUCN anticipates the future \r\nrecommendations of the Secretary-General’s High-\r\nlevel Panel on System-wide Coherence, specifically \r\nrelating to environmental matters such as water \r\nresources, desertification, trade, biodiversity, natural \r\nresources, climate change and deforestation. The IUCN \r\nappreciates the recognition of the importance of \r\nstrengthening ties with civil society and hopes that \r\nthese suggestions will be taken up by States and \r\norganizations in their programmes of work. \r\n We believe that environmental sustainability is \r\none of the main pillars of the global fight against \r\npoverty — that poverty eradication can only be \r\nachieved if the world’s ecosystems, which sustain \r\npeople’s well-being, are conserved and properly \r\nmanaged. The experience of the IUCN and many other \r\norganizations involved in the conservation and \r\ndevelopment of communities clearly indicates that \r\nthere is a direct relationship between the health of \r\necosystems and the opportunities of the impoverished \r\nto increase their food security, improve their health, \r\nbuild assets, reduce risks and have more secure lives. \r\nConversely land degradation, desertification, pollution, \r\nincreasing greenhouse gas emissions and unequal \r\naccess to water and productive ecosystems are all \r\nassociated with a decline in human well-being. \r\nSustainable development can be achieved only through \r\nan increased awareness of the intrinsic necessity of \r\nenvironmental preservation. \r\n The IUCN believes that in order to truly \r\nimplement a global partnership for development \r\nenvironmental interests should be fully considered \r\nwithin United Nations policies and processes in \r\nsupport of economic development. The IUCN, having a \r\nmembership of 42 States, is the only body possessing \r\nand able to contribute to the scientific background and \r\nexpertise of the United Nations in the field of \r\nenvironmental conservation. Our work on improving \r\ncoastal ecosystems, our water and nature initiatives, \r\nthe work that we do on forests and landscapes, our \r\n A/61/PV.25\r\n \r\n19 06-56229 \r\n \r\nfisheries strategies and our recent conference on \r\nbiodiversity in European development cooperation all \r\nhighlight the very real value of our work. \r\n We would like the General Assembly to keep a \r\ncontinual focus on the necessity of preserving our \r\nplanet and the richness of its human and natural \r\nresources. The IUCN has a deep commitment to \r\nworking to make conservation and the management of \r\nnatural resources more effective in addressing poverty. \r\nWe stand ready to support the Assembly’s efforts in \r\nthis regard. \r\n The President: We have heard the last speaker on \r\nthe debate on this item. \r\n May I take it that the General Assembly takes \r\nnote of the report of the Secretary-General on the work \r\nof the Organization, contained in document A/61/1 and \r\ncorrigendum 1? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President: I call now on those delegations \r\nwishing to make statements on the decision the \r\nAssembly has just taken. \r\n Mr. Dugan (United States of America): Indeed, \r\nthe report of the Secretary-General on the work of the \r\nOrganization, document A/61/1, addresses a subject \r\narea as comprehensive as any report’s. There are many \r\nthings in the report on which we could comment, as \r\nothers have done in today’s consideration.  \r\n The Assembly just “took note” of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report. The effect of taking note by the \r\nAssembly should not be construed, as is commonly \r\nunderstood, as formal endorsement of the report’s \r\ncontent, including its proposals. In particular, my \r\ndelegation draws the Assembly’s attention to paragraph \r\n24 of the report. The United States does not agree with \r\nthe Secretary-General’s proposal in paragraph 24 to \r\nadd or develop additional targets with regard to the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. The Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals were just defined by the 2005 \r\nWorld Summit as the development goals and objectives \r\nthat had been agreed upon at the Millennium Summit. \r\nThose goals were defined by the World Summit last \r\nyear and should not be changed.  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n Mr. Steeghs (Netherlands): By taking note of the \r\nreport of the Secretary-General on the work of the \r\nOrganization (A/61/1), the General Assembly has \r\nendorsed the recommendation of the Secretary-General \r\nto incorporate four new targets into the framework \r\nused to follow up on the Millennium Declaration. As \r\nthe Secretary-General states in his report on the work \r\nof the Organization, those targets were agreed upon by \r\nour leaders at the 2005 World Summit. In our opinion, \r\nthe Secretary-General had therefore already been given \r\nthe mandate to include these commitments in the \r\naforementioned framework.  \r\n There is international consensus that the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) are the global \r\ncompact for development. They constitute the \r\nframework within which cooperation with our partner \r\ncountries takes place. They represent a partnership of \r\ncountries determined to create an environment which is \r\nconducive to development and the elimination of \r\npoverty.  \r\n In order to assess and monitor progress towards \r\nthe MDGs, these goals are operationalized in terms of \r\ntargets and indicators. The goals, targets and indicators \r\nshould form a comprehensive, coherent and consistent \r\nmonitoring framework for the MDGs. We have always \r\nheld the view that the monitoring framework could and \r\nshould be further improved. We believe that the \r\ninclusion of the four new targets as recommended by \r\nthe Secretary-General will significantly strengthen the \r\nframework. Full and productive employment and \r\ndecent work, universal access to reproductive health, \r\nuniversal access to treatment for HIV/AIDS and \r\nreduction of loss of biodiversity are crucial for \r\nachieving the MDGs.  \r\n We therefore strongly support the \r\nrecommendation of the Secretary-General and hope \r\nthat work will start soon to select the appropriate \r\nindicators.  \r\n The President: May I take it that it is the wish of \r\nthe General Assembly to conclude its consideration of \r\nagenda item 102? \r\n It was so decided.  \r\n The meeting rose at 5.15 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
