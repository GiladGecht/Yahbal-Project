(Bahrain) \r\n \r\n \r\n The meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 74 (continued) \r\n \r\n \r\nReport of the International Criminal Court \r\n \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/61/217) \r\n \r\n Mr. Maqungo (South Africa): I have the honour \r\nto speak on behalf of the African States parties to the \r\nStatute of the International Criminal Court (ICC). We \r\nwish to convey our gratitude to the President of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court, Judge Kirsch, for his \r\nstatement to the General Assembly (see A/61/PV.26). \r\nWe welcome the note by the Secretary-General \r\ntransmitting the report of the International Criminal \r\nCourt (A/61/217), which elucidates developments at \r\nthe ICC since the Assembly last discussed this item. \r\nWe take this opportunity to congratulate Saint Kitts and \r\nNevis and the Comoros for their ratification of the \r\nStatute of the International Criminal Court and \r\nencourage other States to take a stand against impunity \r\nby ratifying the Court’s Statute. \r\n The 28 African States that have ratified the \r\nInternational Criminal Court Statute continue to be \r\nfully supportive of the work of the Court. We, as \r\ndeveloping countries, are acutely aware of the \r\nimportance of strengthening multilateralism and, by \r\nextension, multilateral institutions, such as the \r\nInternational Criminal Court, as a means to advance \r\nour common goals. The International Criminal Court \r\nhas already in its short existence proved that it plays an \r\nindispensable role in the multilateral arena in ensuring \r\nrespect for the rule of law and contributing to the end \r\nof impunity for the most serious international crimes, \r\nsuch as genocide, crimes against humanity and war \r\ncrimes. We welcome the cooperation extended by the \r\nInternational Criminal Court to the Special Court for \r\nSierra Leone with regard to the trial of Mr. Charles \r\nTaylor. We commit ourselves to continue to ensure that \r\nthe International Criminal Court has the resources to \r\ncarry out its responsibility by doing our best to pay our \r\nassessed contributions on time and in full and generally \r\nto cooperate with the Court. \r\n The horrors of crimes against humanity \r\ncommitted in the former Yugoslavia and in Sierra \r\nLeone and the genocide committed in Rwanda brought \r\nto the fore the sad fact that sometimes national justice \r\nsystems are just not enough to deter or prosecute \r\ncrimes that are of the greatest seriousness to the \r\ninternational community. Therefore, there is a need for \r\nthe international community to augment those national \r\njustice systems when they are unable or unwilling to \r\nact. \r\n Consequently, ad hoc tribunals were established \r\nto address the need for justice arising from the \r\ninternational crimes committed in the former \r\nYugoslavia, in Rwanda and in Sierra Leone \r\nrespectively. The establishment of the ad hoc tribunals \r\ntaught us, however, that their use was limited to \r\nenforcing retributive justice and that they did little to \r\ndeter the commission of crimes. \r\nA/61/PV.27  \r\n \r\n06-56837 2 \r\n \r\n It was a basis of those lessons that the \r\nInternational Criminal Court was then established so \r\nthat it might serve as both a deterrent and a means of \r\nending impunity. We take this opportunity to again \r\nencourage the Court to make the necessary plans for \r\nholding hearings in the area where the crimes were \r\ncommitted, as this would enhance the deterrent effect \r\nof the courts and justice would thus be seen to be done. \r\n We commend the United Nations, and in \r\nparticular the Secretary-General, for the support given \r\nto the establishment of the International Criminal \r\nCourt. That support was consistent with the \r\nOrganization’s Charter mandate “to establish \r\nconditions under which justice and respect for the \r\nobligations arising from treaties and other sources of \r\ninternational law can be maintained”. The Court \r\ncontinues to be in need of United Nations support. \r\nSpecifically, the liaison office of the International \r\nCriminal Court that is being established in New York \r\ncontinues to need the support of the United Nations. In \r\nthat light, we request the United Nations to assist the \r\nliaison office in its efforts to be established in New \r\nYork within United Nations Headquarters. \r\n Let us now turn to the vexing debate on the role \r\nof the Court in peace processes. To understand the role \r\nof the Court, we have to look to the Statute establishing \r\nit. In establishing the International Criminal Court, \r\nStates deliberately chose to make the Court \r\ncomplementary to national justice systems and not \r\nconcurrent, as was the case with the ad hoc tribunals. \r\nFurthermore, States decided that the Court would not \r\nbe vested with the means to enforce its decisions, but \r\nwould have to rely upon States for enforcing arrests \r\nand imprisonment. The result of that architecture is that \r\nthe Court is an effective judiciary organ but is \r\noperationally very dependent upon the cooperation it \r\nreceives from States. Thus, the Court and States, in a \r\ncomplementary relationship, constitute the \r\ninternational justice system that is the International \r\nCriminal Court. \r\n The report mentions that there are three situations \r\nbefore the Court, namely the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo, Uganda and Darfur, the Sudan. The \r\nInternational Criminal Court is involved in those areas \r\non the basis of the invitation of the States concerned or \r\non the basis of a referral by the Security Council, and \r\nnot because it imposed itself on those States. We fully \r\nsupport the response of the International Criminal \r\nCourt to the legitimate invitations by the Government \r\nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo and by the \r\nGovernment of Uganda, which have requested the \r\nCourt’s assistance in ending impunity due to their \r\nnational systems being unable on their own to \r\ninvestigate and prosecute the international crimes \r\ncommitted in their territories.  \r\n Furthermore, by the authority given to it under \r\nthe International Criminal Court Statute, the Security \r\nCouncil referred a situation to the International \r\nCriminal Court, namely, the situation in Darfur, the \r\nSudan, for investigation and prosecution. The Court, in \r\naccordance with the Statute binding upon it and its \r\nmember States, has duly responded to that referral as \r\nwell. We remain cognizant, however, that, \r\nnotwithstanding the Court’s positive response to those \r\nreferrals, it will not be able to prosecute anybody until \r\nthe States concerned deliver the individuals indicted by \r\nthe Court. Therefore, the Court remains primarily a \r\ntool of the States concerned, consistent with the \r\nmanner in which it was established. \r\n In our scrutiny of the building blocks of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court, it therefore seems to us \r\nthat the Court itself does not determine the role it plays \r\nin a peace process, but rather it is States that determine \r\nthe role that the Court should play. The Court is a tool \r\nof accountability that can be activated by States when \r\nthey are of the view that accountability is necessary in \r\na given situation. We are, however, mindful that the \r\nProsecutor of the International Criminal Court is, by \r\nthe terms of the Statute, authorized to initiate \r\ninvestigations on his own motion. We support the \r\napproach he has thus far taken to act only upon the \r\nreferral of States rather than on his own initiative, \r\nparticularly at this early stage of the Court’s existence. \r\n It is thus up to those entities that activated the \r\nCourt to deactivate it in accordance with its Statute, on \r\nthe basis of the complementarity rule, at any time when \r\naccountability by the ICC is no longer a tool of their \r\npreference. We are confident that, consistent with the \r\nInternational Criminal Court Statute, the Court will \r\ndefer to national justice systems when complementarity \r\nis appropriately invoked before the Court. \r\n Let us now turn to the important area of the \r\nresponsibility of States parties to the Statute of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court and, by extension, the \r\nresponsibility of the international organizations to \r\nwhich we belong. We take this opportunity, as 28 \r\nAfrican States that have ratified the International \r\n A/61/PV.27\r\n \r\n3 06-56837 \r\n \r\nCriminal Court Statute, to reiterate the call we made \r\nhere last year to the African Union to conclude a \r\nrelationship agreement with the International Criminal \r\nCourt in the same manner as the United Nations and \r\nother intergovernmental organizations have done. The \r\nConstitutive Act of the African Union recognizes the \r\nneed to deal with crimes against humanity, war crimes \r\nand genocide; therefore, a cooperation mechanism with \r\nthe Court would be consistent with the principles of the \r\nAfrican Union. Furthermore, we call upon States and \r\nprivate donors to give support to the International \r\nCriminal Court Trust Fund for Victims in order to \r\nameliorate the suffering of victims. It will also be \r\nnecessary, in our efforts to cooperate with the Court, to \r\nmake a list of the areas in which the International \r\nCriminal Court will need cooperation and to establish \r\nmechanisms for how we, as States, will extend to the \r\nCourt such cooperation individually, jointly and \r\nthrough intergovernmental organizations. \r\n We welcome the positive developments \r\nemanating from the United States, which has \r\nwithdrawn the restrictions imposed upon States that \r\nhave declined to sign so-called article 98 agreements \r\ngranting immunity to United States nationals and \r\nGovernment employees from the jurisdiction of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court. These developments \r\nplace all States of goodwill on the correct side of \r\nrespect for the rule of law, and they open avenues for \r\nincreased cooperation with the United States in the \r\narea of strengthening international and national \r\ncriminal justice systems. \r\n Finally, we wish to indicate our strong support for \r\nthe decision by the International Criminal Court \r\nAssembly of States Parties to alternate its meetings \r\nbetween The Hague and New York; we appeal to the \r\nUnited Nations to take all available steps to \r\naccommodate the sixth Assembly of States Parties of \r\nthe International Criminal Court at United Nations \r\nHeadquarters in New York. \r\n Ms. McIver (New Zealand): I have the honour to \r\nspeak today on behalf of Canada and Australia, as well \r\nas New Zealand. \r\n The International Criminal Court (ICC) is the \r\nproduct of the international community’s clear resolve \r\nto ensure that those who commit genocide, crimes \r\nagainst humanity and war crimes are brought to justice. \r\nOne hundred and two States have now committed \r\nthemselves to the Rome Statute of the International \r\nCriminal Court and to the principle that, for those most \r\nserious of crimes, impunity will not be tolerated. \r\nCanada, Australia and New Zealand are committed to \r\nensuring that the number of States parties continues to \r\nrise. \r\n The Secretary-General said in his report on the \r\nwork of the Organization that “Justice, especially \r\ntransitional justice in conflict and post-conflict \r\nsocieties, is a fundamental building block of peace” \r\n(A/61/1, para. 109). Our three countries strongly \r\nsupport the principle that justice and peace are \r\nintrinsically intertwined. As Members of the United \r\nNations, we must continue to ensure that a fundamental \r\nelement of our response to conflict situations is the \r\npursuit of justice. The International Criminal Court is \r\nrecognition of that principle and must continue to be \r\nemployed by the United Nations to that end. \r\n Canada, Australia and New Zealand welcome \r\nprogress made by the Court over the past year. In the \r\nfirst successful execution of an International Criminal \r\nCourt arrest warrant, Thomas Lubanga, a Congolese \r\nnational accused of war crimes, was arrested and \r\nsurrendered to the Court in March. This is a significant \r\nstep. \r\n But, we need to remember that the Court is only \r\nan institution. It relies on States and international and \r\nregional organizations to assist in the arrest and \r\nsurrender of accused persons, the provision of \r\nevidence, the protection of witnesses and the \r\nenforcement of sentences. Five arrest warrants were \r\nissued last October against members of the Lord’s \r\nResistance Army accused of sexual enslavement and \r\nthe forced enlistment of child soldiers. None of those \r\nwarrants have been executed. \r\n The International Criminal Court Office of the \r\nProsecutor has continued to investigate allegations of \r\nserious international crimes in Darfur, the Sudan, since \r\nthe Security Council referral of that situation in March \r\n2005. The challenges of conducting investigations \r\nunder such difficult security situations are immense. \r\n Canada, Australia and New Zealand will continue \r\nto do everything within our power to assist the \r\nInternational Criminal Court to carry out its role in \r\nprosecuting those responsible for heinous acts of \r\ngenocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. \r\n We call on all States, likewise, to cooperate with \r\nthe International Criminal Court, directly as well as \r\nA/61/PV.27  \r\n \r\n06-56837 4 \r\n \r\nthrough the United Nations, in order to facilitate its \r\ncontribution to our collective goals of peace, security \r\nand justice. \r\n Mr. Lauber (Switzerland) (spoke in French): \r\nSwitzerland expresses its gratitude and appreciation to \r\nJudge Philippe Kirsch and the entire staff of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) for their \r\nextraordinary efforts and accomplishments, to which \r\nthe report just presented by the President of the Court \r\n(A/61/217) testifies. We are impressed by the intense \r\nlevel of activity of this still very young Court, by the \r\nprogress achieved in the three investigations under way \r\nand by the ambitious goals the Court has set itself in its \r\nstrategic plan. \r\n Switzerland welcomes the steady increase in \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and its various \r\norgans and the International Criminal Court, as \r\ndescribed in the Court’s report. We are particularly \r\npleased at the Court’s having finally established a \r\nliaison office in New York, which will facilitate \r\ncontacts between the Court and United Nations \r\nHeadquarters. We are pleased to welcome the \r\nappointment of Mrs. Socorro Flores as the Court’s new \r\nrepresentative in New York and promise her our full \r\nsupport. \r\n We are currently seeing the emergence of an \r\ninternational criminal justice system, in which the \r\nInternational Criminal Court has a central role to play. \r\nIn the early 1990s, the ad hoc tribunals established by \r\nthe Security Council paved the way for the \r\nestablishment of a permanent international criminal \r\ncourt. Today, the ICC provides detention facilities and \r\ncourtroom services and facilities to the Special Court \r\nfor Sierra Leone for its trial against Mr. Charles Taylor, \r\nand the ICC Deputy Prosecutor is currently serving as \r\nCommissioner of the International Independent \r\nInvestigation Commission established pursuant to \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1595 (2005). Switzerland \r\nencourages such cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the ICC, which will strengthen the \r\ninternational criminal justice system. \r\n The ICC is an independent court of law and must \r\nbe respected as such at all times. At the same time, it \r\nhas to be acknowledged that the purpose and impact of \r\ninternational criminal justice go beyond mere judicial \r\nconsiderations. Ultimately, international criminal \r\njustice contributes very significantly to sustainable \r\npeace and security. The three situations currently under \r\ninvestigation by the Office of the Prosecutor clearly \r\nillustrate this. They were referred to the ICC by the \r\nStates concerned or by the Security Council at a time \r\nwhen conflicts surrounding the alleged crimes were \r\nongoing and with the expectation that the ICC’s \r\ninvolvement would deter future crimes and be \r\nconducive to containing or even ending those conflicts. \r\nIn all three situations, there are clear indications that \r\nthose expectations are being or will be met, provided \r\nthat the Court receives the necessary cooperation and \r\nsupport from the parties involved and as long as we \r\nstand by the principles of the Rome Statute, even when \r\nits implementation faces challenges we did not \r\nforeseen at the time of its adoption. \r\n The United Nations has recognized the role of \r\ninternational criminal justice as an instrument of \r\ndeterrence against genocide, crimes against humanity \r\nand war crimes and as a contributor to sustainable \r\npeace and security on several occasions: in the former \r\nYugoslavia, Rwanda, Cambodia, Sierra Leone, the \r\nSudan and Lebanon, to name just a few. Switzerland \r\nstrongly encourages the relevant bodies, programmes, \r\nfunds and offices of the United Nations as well as \r\nMember States to continue along this road. The role of \r\ninternational criminal justice, and in particular of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court, must be put to its best \r\nuse when conflict prevention and mediation strategies \r\nare developed, when peacekeeping operations are \r\nestablished and prepared, and when peacebuilding and \r\npost-conflict reconstruction are addressed. \r\n In addition, the conceptual recognition of \r\ninternational criminal justice must be followed by \r\nconcrete cooperation and support on the ground. The \r\nInternational Criminal Court, and indeed international \r\ncriminal justice as such, will be unable to fulfil its \r\npotential without the strong support and cooperation of \r\nStates, international and regional organizations and \r\ncivil society, in particular in relation to the arrest and \r\nextradition of accused persons, the provision of \r\nevidence and the enforcement of sentences. In this \r\nregard, the United Nations has a special responsibility \r\nas there is no other organization with a comparable \r\nlevel of field presence and experience. \r\n Finally, the purposes and principles of the Rome \r\nStatute of the International Criminal Court very much \r\nreflect those of the Charter of the United Nations and \r\nare thus universal. Switzerland, therefore, calls on all \r\nStates which have not yet done so to accede to the \r\nRome Statute as soon as possible. \r\n A/61/PV.27\r\n \r\n5 06-56837 \r\n \r\n Mr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): I would like to \r\nthank the President of the International Criminal Court \r\n(ICC), Mr. Philippe Kirsch, for presenting the second \r\nreport of the Court (A/61/217) to the General \r\nAssembly. We note with great satisfaction the progress \r\nmade in the work of the Court over the past year. The \r\nimportance of these developments cannot be \r\noverstated, keeping in mind that the ICC is a recently \r\nestablished institution aimed at promoting justice on a \r\npermanent basis. \r\n The entry into force of the Rome Statute and the \r\nestablishment of the Court have clearly begun to have \r\nan impact far beyond the cases with which the Court is \r\ndealing. States have adapted their legislation dealing \r\nwith the most serious crimes of concern to the \r\ninternational community. The Court is spearheading \r\ninternational efforts to end impunity, and the \r\ncommitment of the international community as \r\nexpressed in the Rome Statute has led to the creation of \r\nspecial tribunals and other mechanisms dealing with \r\npast crimes. \r\n In a number of situations, initial investigations by \r\nthe Prosecutor have sent a clear message to past and \r\npotential future perpetrators in other parts of the world. \r\nEven if their own countries might not be able to bring \r\nthem to justice, the International Criminal Court can do \r\nso. The system of justice established by the Rome \r\nStatute is contributing to deterrence worldwide, and \r\nthis effect will be continuously strengthened through \r\nthe future work of the Court and the publication of its \r\nresults. \r\n The rule of law requires that courts be able to \r\nexercise their functions independently, and the Rome \r\nStatute upholds that principle through various \r\nsafeguards. I would like to refrain from commenting on \r\nany decisions or actions taken by the Court’s organs in \r\ncurrent cases, but we note that the Court has fully lived \r\nup to the expectation of an impartial and independent \r\njudiciary. There is no doubt that the ICC is committed \r\nto promoting justice in accordance with the Rome \r\nStatute and the United Nations Charter and that the \r\nCourt is beyond any suspicion of politicization. \r\n While being an independent institution, however, \r\nthe Court cannot act alone and in a vacuum. We take \r\nnote of the strong emphasis placed by its President on \r\nthe need for cooperation. Such cooperation can take \r\nmany forms and must come both from Member States \r\nand from the United Nations system, in particular from \r\nthe field operations it has established. In this respect, \r\nwe welcome the establishment of the Court’s liaison \r\noffice in New York, which will help promote \r\ncooperation between these two organizations. We call \r\non the Secretary-General to ensure that the \r\nRelationship Agreement with the Court is implemented \r\nto the fullest extent possible. \r\n The preamble of the Rome Statute reaffirms the \r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. \r\nThe first such purpose under Article 1 of the Charter is \r\nto maintain international peace and security. The ICC \r\nwas designed as an institution that promotes and \r\ndelivers justice, based on the principle of \r\ncomplementarity, and that thereby contributing to \r\npeace. Justice and peace are not mutually exclusive \r\ngoals; quite the opposite.  \r\n The real peace-versus-justice dilemma was the \r\nfact that before the establishment of the International \r\nCriminal Court there was no permanent international \r\ninstitution that could deliver justice for the worst \r\ncrimes. Because of that glaring gap in the system of \r\ninternational institutions, impunity was a reality and \r\namnesty a bargaining option for those responsible for \r\ncrimes. The establishment of the ICC represents a \r\nparadigm shift that over the course of time effectively \r\nwill deprive those responsible for the worst crimes of \r\nthe opportunity to demand amnesties, simply because \r\ntheir counterparts in negotiations will not be able to \r\neffectively guarantee impunity. Negotiations and deals \r\nwith those responsible for such crimes will thus have to \r\nrely on elements and incentives other than permanent \r\nimpunity. In the long run, eradicating impunity will \r\ncontribute to sustainable peace in particular post-\r\nconflict situations, and also to deterrence worldwide. \r\nNote should be taken, nevertheless, that the Statute \r\nadopted at Rome allows certain flexibility in \r\ninvestigations, in particular in the light of the interests \r\nof victims and the interests of justice. Such flexibility \r\nis, however, not subject to negotiation with criminals. \r\n Liechtenstein has supported the Court from the \r\nbeginning and will continue to do so wherever \r\npossible. We have ratified both the Rome Statute and \r\nthe Agreement on Privileges and Immunities of the \r\nCourt, and we have adopted the necessary \r\nimplementing legislation.  \r\n In the context of the Assembly of States Parties, \r\none important priority for us is work on the definition \r\nof the crime of aggression, on which the Special \r\nA/61/PV.27  \r\n \r\n06-56837 6 \r\n \r\nWorking Group strives to elaborate concrete proposals \r\nby 2008 for consideration by a Statute review \r\nconference. Much progress was made on this topic in \r\nthe previous inter-sessional meeting, held at the \r\nPrinceton University’s Liechtenstein Institute on Self-\r\nDetermination, and we look forward to continuing our \r\ndiscussions on this issue, which is open not only to \r\nStates parties to the Rome Statute but also to all States \r\nthat have signed the Final Act of the Rome Conference. \r\n Finally, we would like to invite all States that are \r\nnot yet parties to the Rome Statute to continue to \r\nevaluate the work of the Court. We are confident that \r\ndoing so will encourage them to join the majority of \r\nMember States who decided to be part of this historic \r\nenterprise. \r\n Mr. Gómez-Robledo (Mexico) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): The delegation of Mexico wishes to express \r\nits sincere appreciation to the President of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC), Judge Philippe \r\nKirsch, for the comprehensive report that he has \r\npresented to the General Assembly (A/61/217), in \r\naccordance with the Relationship Agreement between \r\nthe United Nations and the Court. There are now 100 \r\nStates parties to the Rome Statute, and on 1 November \r\n2006, the Statute will have two additional States \r\nparties. The Government of Mexico wishes to \r\ncongratulate the Comoros and Saint Kitts and Nevis for \r\nrecently depositing their instruments of ratification — \r\nadditional steps towards the universality of the Statute. \r\nFrom its own experience, Mexico fully understands the \r\ndifficulties involved in the ratification of a treaty that \r\nhas such a powerful effect on the domestic criminal \r\njustice system and that requires complex legislative \r\nreforms, including at the constitutional level. States \r\nparties and civil society organizations have joined to \r\nprovide technical support to whomever might need it \r\nthat will allow signatories to adapt their legislation. \r\nThe advantages derived from belonging to the ICC are \r\ngreater than the doubts that an instrument of this type \r\nstill raises in some countries. \r\n The International Criminal Court is fully \r\noperational. This is clear, as stated in the annual report, \r\nwith the surrender of the first person arrested by virtue \r\nof an order of the Court in March 2006 and with the \r\ninitiation of preliminary proceeding and appeals in \r\nadvance of the trials that will soon begin. We have \r\nmade due note of the investigations being made by the \r\nProsecutor in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \r\nUganda and in Darfur, the Sudan, and the analysis \r\nbeing carried out concerning cases in the Central \r\nAfrican Republic and Côte d’Ivoire as a result of a \r\ndeclaration of acceptance of the Court’s jurisdiction. \r\n In accordance with the Statute, the Court is \r\nhearing three cases referred by States and one referred \r\nby the Security Council and is analysing \r\ncommunications in order to determine whether to begin \r\ninvestigations in other cases. In each case, the Court \r\nhas shown that it is moving forward, and we trust that \r\nit will continue to do so within its proper jurisdiction. \r\nIn these cases, the required infrastructure has been \r\ncreated to guarantee the full participation of victims \r\nand the protection of the rights of the defence through \r\nthe Office of Public Counsel for Victims and the \r\npreparation of measures to guarantee the security of \r\nvictims, witnesses and other persons at risk because of \r\ninvestigations carried out by the Court. \r\n But the Court is facing enormous challenges at \r\nthis stage of its development as an institution. Allow \r\nme to discuss three basic aspects of the Court’s future \r\nwork: international cooperation, selection criteria, and \r\nthe interests of justice.  \r\n A basic pillar of the Court’s work is based on \r\ninternational cooperation, as is stated in the summary \r\nof its report: \r\n “... the Court relied on cooperation from States, \r\nthe United Nations, other international \r\norganizations and civil society. The Court does \r\nnot have its own police force to carry out its \r\ndecisions or orders. It needs the assistance of \r\nothers in, inter alia, gathering evidence, providing \r\nlogistical support to operations in the field, \r\nrelocating witnesses, arresting and surrendering \r\npersons and enforcing the sentences of the \r\nconvicted.” \r\n States parties have a basic obligation to cooperate \r\nin the investigation and prosecution of crimes within \r\nthe Court’s jurisdiction. The Statute must be complied \r\nwith in good faith and in accordance with the principle \r\nof pacta sunt servanda. Without this basic cooperation, \r\nthe Court would be prevented from carrying out its \r\nmandate. Because of the very nature of the \r\ninvestigations, States whose situations have been \r\nreferred to the Court have an immediate obligation to \r\ncooperate with it. But the complexity of the Court’s \r\nwork — efficiently carrying out investigations, \r\ngathering evidence, properly caring for victims and \r\nimplementing sentences — also creates an obligation \r\n A/61/PV.27\r\n \r\n7 06-56837 \r\n \r\nfor the rest of the international community. In that \r\nrespect, dialogue between the Court and States parties \r\nmust focus more clearly on identifying expectations of \r\ncooperation in all its ramifications. \r\n The situation in Darfur has made clear the role \r\nthat the United Nations can play in carrying out the \r\nCourt’s mandate. Although the Court has signed a \r\nmemorandum of understanding with the United \r\nNations Organization Mission in the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, there is still a need to increase \r\ncooperation with other United Nations agencies, \r\norganizations and offices. The Relationship Agreement \r\nbetween the ICC and the United Nations provides a \r\nlegal framework for developing greater and more \r\neffective cooperation. We have only to think about the \r\noperational capacity of the United Nations through its \r\npeacekeeping operations to provide the Court field \r\nsupport where there are difficult logistic conditions.  \r\n Here, the Security Council has a special \r\nresponsibility to fulfil. For example, the ongoing \r\nsituation in Darfur creates an obligation to logistically \r\nsupport the Court in the investigation of crimes \r\ncommitted there, without affecting its impartiality. In \r\naddition, the Security Council has the authority to \r\nempower peacekeeping operations deployed to places \r\nwhere there are cases under investigation by the Court \r\nwith a mandate necessary to support it in the \r\ndevelopment of its work.  \r\n In short, the Court is already an important \r\ncomponent of the international peace and security \r\nsystem. That is why we welcome the decision of the \r\nAssembly of States Parties to open a liaison office in \r\nNew York which will serve to creatively develop \r\ncooperation with the United Nations. The office should \r\nbe provided with the necessary means to carry out its \r\nmission. On the one hand, the Assembly of States \r\nParties should consider granting the required financial \r\nresources in order to effectively develop its mandate. \r\nOn the other, the Relationship Agreement with the \r\nUnited Nations creates obligations on the part of the \r\nUnited Nations to enable the office to open properly in \r\nNew York. An important step has been the appointment \r\nof the head of the office, Mrs. Socorro Flores, a \r\nprominent Mexican legal authority, but the \r\nOrganization and the States parties must make an \r\nadditional effort so that the office can operate properly. \r\n Allow me to refer to another aspect of importance \r\nto the future of the Court that is related to the selection \r\ncriteria of the Office of the Prosecutor to initiate an \r\ninvestigation. \r\n The Court has limited resources at its disposal. It \r\nwould be physically impossible to launch an \r\ninvestigation of every case of which the Prosecutor is \r\nmade aware. We must not forget that the Court works \r\non the basis of complementarity. It is therefore up to \r\nStates parties to initiate and carry out prosecutions of \r\nthose responsible for committing on their territory \r\nsome of the crimes covered under the Statute. The \r\nprosecution strategy recently put forth by the \r\nProsecutor sets out the parameters within which his \r\nOffice should operate. As the Prosecutor has himself \r\nstated, \r\n “intervention by the Office must be \r\nexceptional — it will only step in when States fail \r\nto conduct investigations and prosecutions, or \r\nwhere they purport to do so but in reality are \r\nunwilling or unable to genuinely carry out \r\nproceedings”. \r\n In that regard, we agree with the Office of the \r\nProsecutor that complementarity must be viewed as a \r\npositive approach to encourage proceedings where \r\npossible, rely on national and international networks \r\nand to participate in a system of international \r\ncooperation. The Court’s very existence and its full \r\noperation are in themselves incentives for States to \r\nprevent the commission of crimes in their territories \r\nand to act immediately when crimes do occur.  \r\n In recent months, we have spoken about what is \r\nknown as the dilemma between peace and justice in \r\norder to describe a situation in which political actors \r\nwould have to choose between investigating and \r\npunishing those responsible for crimes covered by the \r\nStatute, on the one hand, and a political solution to the \r\nsituation that led to those crimes, on the other. For a \r\ncourt of law such as the International Criminal Court, \r\njustice cannot be subordinate to political negotiation. \r\nThere is therefore no such dilemma, as one cannot even \r\ncountenance the denial of justice. We must be clear \r\nabout the fact that every institution has a role to play: \r\nthe political and the judicial each have their part. \r\n We therefore believe that the Prosecutor made the \r\ncorrect decision in investigating the situation in \r\nnorthern Uganda and carrying out prosecutions in a \r\nmanner that did not affect the role that could be played \r\nby other actors. There is no doubt that efforts to \r\nestablish lasting stability require harmonizing the \r\nA/61/PV.27  \r\n \r\n06-56837 8 \r\n \r\nefforts of the Prosecutor with national and international \r\ninitiatives to restore peace. The Court is a central to \r\npeace. We are convinced that the launching of an \r\ninvestigation itself can, and must, have a positive \r\nimpact on the political scene. \r\n We have come a long way, but the Court still has \r\ngreat challenges to face. The complete determination of \r\nthe international community to combat impunity will \r\nhelp us to confront those challenges with creativity. \r\nThe Court can count on Mexico’s full support in its \r\ngreat undertaking. \r\n Mr. Riofrío (Ecuador) (spoke in Spanish): My \r\ndelegation would like to thank the President of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) for his introduction \r\nof the Court’s second annual report (A/61/217).  \r\n The past year has been an especially important \r\none for the Court’s work as regards the progress made \r\nin both investigations and pre-trial proceedings. \r\nDespite being a young institution, the Court has \r\nunambiguously demonstrated that, thanks to its \r\nindependence and impartiality, it can become a \r\ndynamic factor in peacebuilding.  \r\n However, the strenuous efforts made to make \r\nprogress in judicial proceedings have had to contend \r\nwith the painful reality that arrest warrants, which are \r\nthe only way to ensure the holding of a trial and, \r\nultimately, the end of impunity, have not been carried \r\nout. My delegation agrees with the report that it is \r\ncrucial to strengthen the cooperation of States and \r\ninternational organizations to ensure that arrests, the \r\nprovision of evidence and the relocation of witnesses, \r\namong other things, are carried out in an effective, \r\ntransparent and timely manner. It is essential that \r\nStates be willing to facilitate the holding of trials. \r\nGiven the situation in which the Court currently finds \r\nitself, we should perhaps consider what measures are \r\nnecessary to effectively implement the Statute’s \r\nprovisions regarding cooperation in the absence of \r\nsuch willingness. \r\n Ecuador would like to reaffirm its respect for the \r\nuniversal principles of justice enshrined in the Statute, \r\nas well as its ongoing commitment to the ICC. In that \r\nconnection, on 19 April 2006, my country deposited its \r\ninstrument of ratification on the Agreement on \r\nPrivileges and Immunities of the International Criminal \r\nCourt. We have also made progress at the national level \r\nas regards the implementation of the Statute, including \r\nby promoting the necessary legislative reforms. \r\n On the initiative of civil society and through the \r\ncoordination provided by various State institutions, a \r\ndraft law on crimes against humanity, which defines \r\nthe crimes covered by the Statute, was submitted to \r\nEcuador’s National Congress for approval. The bill \r\nalso provides for standards that will make it possible to \r\ncomply with the principle of complementarity and the \r\nobligation to cooperate with the International Criminal \r\nCourt. \r\n Ecuador firmly believes in the need to protect the \r\nintegrity of the Rome Statute. We are convinced that \r\nthe best way to do that is by achieving universal \r\nratification. On behalf of my country, I should like to \r\ncongratulate the Governments of Saint Kitts and Nevis \r\nand the Comoros on their decision to ratify the Statute. \r\n In conclusion, Ecuador would like to launch an \r\nappeal to support the ICC and its work, which \r\nrepresents the best instrument to combat impunity and \r\nascribe responsibility for crimes against humanity.  \r\n I cannot fail to close without expressing the \r\nGovernment of Ecuador’s pleasure at the setting up of \r\nthe Court’s office in New York, to which we extend our \r\nfull support.  \r\n Mr. Mayoral (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the Argentine Government, I should like to \r\nwelcome the presence in New York of Judge Philippe \r\nKirsch, President of the International Criminal Court \r\n(ICC), which provides an opportunity for the General \r\nAssembly to welcome him and to receive the Court’s \r\nsecond annual report (A/61/217) on its work. His \r\nleadership of that unique juridical body during the \r\ninitial stages of the Court’s existence has been, and \r\ncontinues to be, of fundamental importance. I ask that \r\nyou, Madam President, convey to President Kirsch the \r\nfull support of my Government and of my country’s \r\ncivil society. \r\n The last century witnessed the worst atrocities of \r\nthe modern age — acts of genocide, mass killing and \r\nethnic cleansing that did permanent damage to \r\nhumankind’s collective psyche. The United Nations \r\nand the ICC have in large part been the result of the \r\ninternational community’s reckoning with those \r\ntragedies. Both of those international institutions will \r\ncontinue to have a crucial role to play in the new \r\ncentury in ensuring that crimes against humanity are \r\nnot repeated. All States parties, but also those that are \r\nnot, must cooperate in order to strengthen the Court \r\nand ensure its independence and success. \r\n A/61/PV.27\r\n \r\n9 06-56837 \r\n \r\n Last June, the Security Council considered the \r\nissue of the rule of law and its role in the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security (see S/PV.5474). \r\nDuring that debate, Argentina emphasized the crucial \r\nimportance of the links between peace, justice and \r\nhuman rights and the role of the Court in completely \r\neliminating impunity.  \r\n Supporting the Court means contributing to \r\nprogress towards an international system of justice that \r\nexposes impunity and prevents crime. We are \r\nespecially optimistic about Court’s overall dissuasive \r\nrole in armed conflicts and internal situations. \r\n We continue to follow with great attention the \r\ndevelopment of the process of investigation in the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda and \r\nDarfur. We would highlight the transfer to The Hague \r\nof Mr. Thomas Lubanga, which was possible thanks to \r\nthe support of the Security Council and its resolution \r\n1533 (2004). We also take note of the steps being taken \r\nin preparation for his trial. \r\n With regard to arrest warrants issued against \r\nleaders of the Lord’s Resistance Army in Uganda, we \r\nbelieve that the international community, and \r\nespecially mediators providing assistance in the Juba \r\nprocess, must seek innovative solutions that harmonize \r\ntraditional reconciliation systems used by the local \r\npopulation with the inviolable imperatives of \r\ninternational law. Peace cannot be attained at the cost \r\nof justice. The authorities of the Sudan, Uganda and \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo must fully \r\ncooperate to arrest persons against whom arrest \r\nwarrants have been issued. \r\n With regard to crimes committed in the Sudan’s \r\nDarfur region, we reiterate the obligation of all States \r\nand organizations under Security Council resolution \r\n1593 (2005) to provide information and logistical \r\nsupport to the Court as it carries out its work. States \r\nand organizations should also, among other things, \r\ncontribute to providing protection to victims and \r\nwitnesses and adopt all the necessary measures to \r\npreserve evidence. We therefore once again call upon \r\nthe Government of the Sudan to enable the \r\ninvestigation to take place and to ensure the safety of \r\nwitnesses. \r\n We would also like to acknowledge the \r\ncooperation between the Court and the Special Court \r\nfor Sierra Leone, which was facilitated by the \r\ncooperation provided by the Security Council in its \r\nresolution 1688 (2006), which allowed for the transfer \r\nand future trial at The Hague of Mr. Charles Taylor and \r\nthe provision of detention facilities and hearing rooms \r\nfor his trial. \r\n We would like to express our gratitude and \r\nsupport for our countryman Prosecutor Luis Moreno \r\nOcampo, as well as his team, in particular for their \r\nefficiency and dedication to both ongoing \r\ninvestigations and the substantive work being done to \r\nevaluate other potential cases. We all know their work \r\nis very complex and politically sensitive. \r\n In another area, we would like to acknowledge \r\nthe important work of the United Nations Organization \r\nMission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We \r\nhope that work will continue to be carried out \r\nefficiently. We call upon the Governments of the Sudan \r\nand Chad to continue to cooperate fully with the \r\nProsecutor’s ongoing investigations. \r\n We are also interested in studying the conclusions \r\nof the third colloquium of international prosecutors, \r\nwhich took place last week in The Hague. We \r\ncongratulate the Court and the Prosecutor’s Office for \r\nthat initiative to promote dialogue and cooperation in \r\norder to continue to make progress towards a universal \r\nsystem of justice. \r\n Cooperation with the Court should take place in \r\nthe capitals of Member States, in New York and at The \r\nHague. There must also be cooperation on the ground, \r\nwhere the Courts decisions must be carried out, \r\nevidence gathered and logistical support provided, as \r\nwell as where personnel, victims, witnesses and those \r\non trial must be protected. In that connection, the \r\nUnited Nations must continue to play a constructive \r\nrole while utilizing its experience in the areas of police \r\nand security. \r\n My country, Argentina, was very interested to \r\nnote the recent publication of the International \r\nCriminal Court’s strategic plan, which will be taken up \r\nat the fifth Assembly of States Parties next November. \r\nWe believe that the plan, which is now being finalized, \r\nis an important basis for strategic consideration of the \r\nCourt’s future work. We are in principle in agreement \r\nwith the objectives and goals set out in the plan. \r\n In conclusion, we would once again like to urge \r\nStates that have not signed or ratified the Rome Statute \r\nto do so as soon as possible. We call upon all States to \r\ndetain and surrender accused in order that they can be \r\nA/61/PV.27  \r\n \r\n06-56837 10 \r\n \r\ntried. We urge the General Assembly and the Security \r\nCouncil to continue to support the International \r\nCriminal Court. I should like to say once again that the \r\ninternational community and the cause of international \r\npeace and security need an efficient Criminal Court \r\nwith universal jurisdiction and competence that can \r\nachieve the great purposes for which it was established. \r\n Mr. Samy (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I would like to thank the Presidents of the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), \r\nthe International Criminal Tribunal for the Former \r\nYugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Criminal \r\nCourt for their reports to the General Assembly, which \r\nshed light on the evolution of the principles of \r\ninternational criminal law in combating heinous crimes \r\nagainst humanity. In that regard, Egypt would like to \r\nemphasize the important role of the international \r\ncriminal tribunals in guaranteeing the rule of law, \r\nespecially as regards international humanitarian law. \r\nDoing so is important to maintaining international \r\npeace and security. The role of international tribunals \r\nis complementary to that of national legal systems, \r\nwhich are the competent authorities to bring to justice \r\nthose who commit such crimes. Prosecuting such \r\npersons is part of a State’s responsibility in ensuring \r\npeace and security for its citizens and in guaranteeing \r\ndomestic stability. \r\n In that regard, Egypt would like to reaffirm that \r\ninternational tribunals should continue on the path of \r\nneutrality as they carry out their work, namely, by \r\nadopting a basic approach that underscores the judicial \r\nnature of their work and emphasizes the non-political \r\ncharacter of their undertakings. That would provide \r\nassurances as to their neutrality and independence and \r\nprovide the tribunals an opportunity to carry out their \r\nlegal and moral role. \r\n With regard to the nature of the crimes dealt with \r\nby the tribunals — whether they are war crimes or \r\ngenocide or other crimes against humanity — the \r\ntribunals should be encouraged to prosecute all accused \r\nof committing such crimes and to ensure that no one \r\nenjoys impunity, in particular persons responsible for \r\nissuing and carrying out orders during armed conflict \r\nor against people under occupation. \r\n With regard to the International Criminal Court, \r\nEgypt appreciates the Court’s efforts to prepare the \r\nfirst version of a strategic plan outlining a general \r\nframework for its work over the next 10 years.  \r\n The delegation of Egypt would like to reaffirm \r\nthe importance of intensifying the Court’s current \r\nefforts to arrive at a definition of the crime of \r\naggression, especially as current international \r\ncircumstances and developments point to the \r\nimportance of reaching such a definition to punish \r\ncriminals who commit such heinous crimes. \r\n Egypt would also like to reaffirm the importance \r\nof not politicizing the work of the Court, as well as the \r\nneed to avoid selectivity in bringing cases before the \r\nCourt, in accordance with the legal principle that all \r\nare equal before the law. We therefore request that the \r\nCourt and the Security Council bring before the Court \r\nall those accused of committing war crimes and crimes \r\nagainst humanity without discrimination based on \r\npolitical considerations.  \r\n We would also like to reaffirm the principle of \r\ntransparency and the importance of refraining from \r\nresorting to secret lists of names of accused, as justice \r\nis based on transparency and accountability. In that \r\nregard, investigative and evidence-gathering \r\nprocedures need to be reconsidered, especially \r\ninvestigative procedures pertaining to crimes and the \r\nprovision of strong material evidence so as to ensure \r\nthat identical actions are taken in dealing with identical \r\ncrimes defined in the Statute of the Court. There should \r\nbe no rush to characterize facts on the basis of \r\nincomplete testimony or by relying on a cursory \r\nexamination of the facts without taking into \r\nconsideration the full legal considerations.  \r\n Egypt reaffirms its support for the role and \r\nactivities of the International Criminal Tribunal for \r\nRwanda (ICTR), especially activities aimed at training \r\nlegal personnel from Rwanda and other African \r\ncountries in order to enhance the national capacity of \r\ncountries to guarantee the rule of law and protect their \r\ncitizens. This is a main pillar in establishing the \r\nsecurity and stability necessary for development and \r\nprogress on our continent, Africa. In order to enhance \r\nthe capacity of the Tribunal to carry out its tasks, the \r\nGovernment of Egypt has made an important financial \r\ncontribution to the Tribunal’s voluntary contribution \r\nfund, and we will continue to do so. \r\n Moreover, Egypt held a symposium in 2005 to \r\ncommemorate the tenth anniversary of the massacres in \r\nRwanda. Mr. Adama Dieng, Registrar of the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, \r\nparticipated in that event. The goal of the symposium \r\n A/61/PV.27\r\n \r\n11 06-56837 \r\n \r\nwas to remind everyone of those crimes against \r\nhumanity and the resultant suffering of the Rwandan \r\npeople, in order to draw lessons from the Rwandan \r\nexperience as a whole, and to support the role of the \r\nCourt. That should be a deterrent to anyone who may \r\nattempt to commit such horrendous crimes. \r\n With regard to the International Criminal \r\nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, we continue to be \r\ndisappointed by the fact that several leaders who \r\ncommitted the most horrifying of crimes against \r\nhumanity have not been brought to justice before the \r\nTribunal and remain at large. In that connection, Egypt \r\nreaffirms the importance of cooperation with the \r\nTribunal by all parties in the territory of the former \r\nYugoslavia, whether in connection with the gathering \r\nof evidence or arresting and trying those accused of \r\ncommitting crimes against innocent people. History \r\nwill not forgive such crimes. Prosecuting the accused \r\nwill contribute to justice and national conciliation in \r\nthat region. \r\n In that regard, the Government of Egypt \r\nwelcomes the cooperation of Serbia and Montenegro \r\nwith the Tribunal during the last reporting period. We \r\nencourage them to continue to cooperate so that the \r\nTribunal can overcome the difficulties it faces in \r\ncarrying out its mandate in the timeframe specified. \r\n At the outset of my statement I referred to the \r\nimportance of non-selectivity in referring cases to \r\ninternational courts and to the importance of not \r\npoliticizing their work. We should soon see fair trials \r\nfor those accused of committing crimes against \r\nhumanity in the occupied Arab territories of Palestine \r\nand Lebanon, in a reaffirmation of the principle that all \r\nare equal before the law and to ensure the promotion \r\nand upholding of justice. \r\n Mr. Kryzhanivskyi (Ukraine): At the outset, I \r\nwould like fully to associate my delegation with the \r\nstatement delivered by the representative of Finland on \r\nbehalf of the European Union. Allow me to make some \r\nadditional remarks. \r\n Ukraine attaches great importance to the \r\nactivities of the International Criminal Court. We \r\nwelcome the ratification of the Rome Statute by 102 \r\nStates representing all regions of the world.  \r\n Ukraine is a strong supporter of the idea that the \r\neffective functioning of the Court will end impunity for \r\nthose who hide behind the principle of State \r\nsovereignty, as the Rome Statute confers upon the \r\nCourt jurisdiction over acts of genocide, war crimes, \r\ncrimes against humanity and the crime of aggression, \r\nirrespective of national boundaries. \r\n I would like to emphasize the importance for my \r\ncountry of developing a definition of the crime of \r\naggression. The system of international criminal justice \r\nbased on the Rome Statute would be incomplete \r\nwithout such a definition. In that regard, I would like \r\nto commend the contribution made by the delegation of \r\nLiechtenstein this year in organizing an intersessional \r\nmeeting of the Special Working Group on the Crime of \r\nAggression at the Liechtenstein Institute on Self-\r\nDetermination at Princeton. \r\n As a strong advocate for a fair and effective \r\nInternational Criminal Court, Ukraine signed the Rome \r\nStatute on 20 January 2000. In so doing my country \r\ntook its first step towards participation in that \r\ninstrument. Extensive work was also begun in Ukraine \r\nto develop, and eventually adopt, implementing \r\nlegislation, which is the necessary prerequisite to the \r\nparliament’s ratification of the Statute. However, \r\nduring the bill’s drafting phase, a debate emerged about \r\nwhether the Rome Statute is in conformity with \r\nUkraine’s constitution. The appropriate issues were \r\nsubmitted to the Constitutional Court of Ukraine for its \r\nfinal resolution. \r\n On 12 July 2001 the Constitutional Court of \r\nUkraine pronounced its conclusion, according to which \r\nthe Rome Statute was found to be in conformity with \r\nthe Constitution of Ukraine, with the exception of the \r\nprovision contained in the Statute’s tenth preambular \r\nparagraph, which states that “the International Criminal \r\nCourt established under [the] Statute shall be \r\ncomplementary to national criminal jurisdictions”. In \r\naccordance with the conclusion of the Constitutional \r\nCourt, further measures will be taken in Ukraine to \r\ncomplete the internal procedures necessary to submit \r\nthe Rome Statute to the Verkhovna Rada — which is \r\nUkraine’s parliament — for its ratification. \r\n I would like to express the conviction that the \r\ntask of completing the ratification process and enacting \r\nimplementing legislation will be successfully \r\naccomplished in Ukraine. We understand the necessity \r\nfor these steps to help end impunity for the worst \r\ncrimes in the world, which have plagued the twenty-\r\nfirst century as no other. \r\nA/61/PV.27  \r\n \r\n06-56837 12 \r\n \r\n Ms. Skaare (Norway): Let me begin by saying \r\nthat Norway fully recognizes the substantial progress \r\nmade by the International Criminal Court (ICC) this \r\npast year. The Court is steadily integrating itself, \r\nincluding in practice, into the international legal \r\nsystem and the broader framework of international \r\ninstitutions and relations. Norway welcomes the \r\nsecond annual report (A/61/271) of the Court to the \r\nGeneral Assembly, which reflects its achievements. We \r\nwould like to thank the President of the Court, \r\nMr. Philippe Kirsch, for his presentation. \r\n We are very pleased to note the strengthening of \r\nthe relationship between the ICC and the United \r\nNations. Secretary-General Kofi Annan once said that \r\nthere can be no healing without peace, no peace \r\nwithout justice and no justice without respect for \r\nhuman rights and the rule of law. Norway fully shares \r\nthat view, and firmly believes that the ICC has a \r\ncrucial role to play in ensuring justice, as a \r\ncomplement to national systems, in order to achieve \r\naccountability for genocide, crimes against humanity \r\nand war crimes. \r\n At the same time, it has long been recognized that \r\nthe pursuit of justice in areas affected by armed \r\nconflict can give rise to particular challenges. One \r\nchallenge that has been increasingly debated is related \r\nto the relationship between peace efforts and criminal \r\nprosecutions. Efforts to promote ceasefires and peace \r\nagreements can of course give rise to dilemmas. In \r\ncertain cases, people who are key to the success of \r\npeace talks may have even perpetrated the gravest \r\ncrimes. Nonetheless, in order to end bloodshed and \r\narmed conflict, mediators may have to call on all the \r\nparties concerned to sit down together and negotiate. \r\n The emergence of a system of international \r\ncriminal justice has not changed any of that; nor does it \r\nconstitute any obstacle to the pursuit of peace; nor do \r\nwe need more empirical evidence of peace having \r\nfailed because of continued impunity for mass \r\natrocities. We have enough experience in that field. We \r\ndo not need more empirical data to substantiate the \r\nneed for an international legal order, including \r\ninternational criminal justice. Ending armed conflict is, \r\nin turn, crucial to the establishment of justice and the \r\npromotion of human rights and development. \r\nProlonged bloodshed is not in the interest of any \r\nvictims. Instead, it creates new ones on a large scale. \r\n Although it has long been recognized that there is \r\nno durable peace without justice, it is equally difficult \r\nto conceive of true justice in a society without peace. \r\nThe two aims, peace and justice, based on respect for \r\nhuman rights, are among the fundamental purposes of \r\nthe United Nations. They are both identified in the very \r\nfirst Article of the Charter. Although they are distinct, \r\nthey are closely interrelated. And although they may be \r\ndifficult to attain simultaneously, we must strive to \r\nachieve them — if necessary one at a time — not least \r\nbecause they are mutually supportive and reinforcing. \r\n Governments that are committed to the aims of \r\nthe United Nations and to the prosperity of civilian \r\npopulations must have a full understanding of the \r\nrelationship between human rights, development and \r\nsecurity. \r\n Facilitating the end of conflict and contributing to \r\ndurable peace, including through true justice, are \r\ndemanding challenges for the international community. \r\nProhibiting impunity for mass atrocities and \r\ncommunicating clearly to war-torn societies that such \r\nmeasures are being taken are necessary steps. The new \r\nsystem of international criminal justice will bring the \r\nperpetrators of mass atrocities to justice when national \r\nsystems are unable or unwilling to do so. That \r\npowerful message has broad support and was recently \r\nreiterated by the Secretary-General, who said: \r\n  “Justice, especially transitional justice in \r\nconflict and post-conflict societies, is a \r\nfundamental building block of peace. In the face \r\nof pressures to the contrary, the international \r\ncommunity should ensure that justice and peace \r\nare considered to be complementary \r\nrequirements. Indeed, we must never choose \r\nbetween justice and peace, even if it is not \r\npossible to pursue both goals in parallel. This is \r\nparticularly important because it remains our firm \r\nposition that there should be no amnesty for \r\ninternational crimes.” (A/61/1, para. 109) \r\nThat message is slowly being implemented in practice, \r\nthrough painstaking efforts at national levels, through \r\ninternational cooperation and, where necessary, \r\nthrough international mechanisms such as the ICC, \r\nwhich is triggering the legal obligations of States \r\nparties to the Statute. \r\n In that regard, Norway expects States that have \r\nlegal obligations according to the Statute, or who have \r\nentered into cooperation agreements with the Court, to \r\n A/61/PV.27\r\n \r\n13 06-56837 \r\n \r\ncomply with those obligations and to demonstrate in \r\npractice their commitment to justice. Those States have \r\na responsibility to reach out and explain to their \r\npopulations the true nature of the Court and its system. \r\nIt is a system that provides for fair hearings and the \r\nrights of the accused, while safeguarding the interests \r\nof victims and it is a system that enjoys broad support \r\nin the international community. \r\n At the same time, the international community, \r\nincluding the United Nations Security Council in \r\nparticular, retain their responsibility for the \r\nmaintenance of peace and security and ultimately for \r\neffective support to peace efforts. It is important that \r\nthe General Assembly, as well as the Security Council, \r\nunderline the importance of the pursuit of justice in \r\ntheir quest for durable peace. Those bodies must take \r\nthose issues fully into account when shouldering their \r\nresponsibilities. \r\n Norway is pleased to note that today, more than \r\none out of every two Member States of the United \r\nNations are parties to the Rome Statute. It is no small \r\nachievement that only four years after the \r\nestablishment of the Court, it numbers more than 100 \r\nStates parties. Norway sincerely hopes that the number \r\nwill continue to rise at the same rate and that we will \r\nachieve the aim of universal adherence. \r\n This past year important steps have been taken by \r\nthe Court in its judicial functioning. The Court has \r\ninitiated its first proceedings against an accused, and \r\nthe Appeals Chamber has issued its first decision on \r\nthe merits. However, as emphasized both in the report \r\nbefore us and by the President of the Court, the Court \r\nwill need the cooperation of States. That is why \r\nNorway calls on all States to cooperate fully with the \r\nCourt. \r\n In closing, I would like to reiterate Norway’s firm \r\nand long-standing commitment to the integrity of the \r\nICC Statute and to an effective, credible and a \r\nresponsible International Criminal Court, which can \r\nand should enjoy the broadest possible support of \r\nStates. We believe that it is in the long-term interest of \r\nnations, irrespective of size, regional grouping or \r\npolitical orientation, to work to strengthen the rule of \r\nlaw. That is not only the expression of our consistent \r\napproach to long-term peace and reconciliation through \r\njustice, it also reflects, we believe, a realistic \r\nassessment of the needs of today’s interdependent \r\nworld. \r\n Mr. Duarte (Brazil): I wish to begin by thanking \r\nJudge Philippe Kirsch, President of the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC), for the report he presented to us \r\ntoday and for his remarks on the Court’s activities and \r\nits place within an emerging system of international \r\njustice. I also wish to commend the President of the \r\nAssembly of States Parties, Mr. Bruno Stagno Ugarte, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Costa Rica. His \r\nleadership role has been instrumental in a period \r\nduring which important and sensitive decisions had to \r\nbe taken.  \r\n Last year, the Court unsealed its first five arrest \r\nwarrants. In March 2006, it received in custody the \r\nfirst person arrested pursuant to a warrant issued by the \r\nCourt. Pre-trial and appeals proceedings continued to \r\ntake place for trials to begin late this year or early next \r\nyear. That activity testifies to the vitality of the \r\ninstitution which has now reached the stage of full \r\nfunctionality. \r\n The Court’s investigations, as carried out by the \r\nOffice of the Prosecutor, with the logistical support of \r\nthe Registry, continue to take place in the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, Uganda and Chad. In the case \r\nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the \r\ninvestigations have already led to the first arrest. With \r\nrespect to Uganda, it is worth stressing the importance \r\nof the cooperation of the Government of that country \r\ntowards the success of the initiatives. \r\n Regarding Darfur, Brazil has on several occasions \r\nexpressed the importance it attributes to the role of \r\njustice in establishing peace and ending violence in the \r\nregion. Although we deeply regret that the persistence \r\nof the conflict has so far prevented investigations on \r\nthe ground, we are nevertheless encouraged by the \r\ntireless efforts of the Office of the Prosecutor in \r\nleading missions to Khartoum and to several different \r\ncountries. We are also encouraged by the fact that the \r\nCourt’s field presence in Darfur, which had been \r\ntemporarily discontinued, is now resumed. We reiterate \r\nour full support for the investigations and we will \r\ncontinue to follow with interest the reports of the \r\nProsecutor to the Security Council pursuant to the \r\nprovisions of resolution 1593 (2005). \r\n Given the intricacies of the relationship between \r\nthe United Nations and the International Criminal \r\nCourt, Brazil welcomes the close cooperation between \r\nthe two institutions and believes that they should \r\ncontinue to work together to fulfil their shared goals. \r\nA/61/PV.27  \r\n \r\n06-56837 14 \r\n \r\nIn that regard, we note with satisfaction the recent \r\nRelationship Agreement between the ICC and the \r\nUnited Nations as well as the establishment of the ICC \r\nliaison office in New York. We are confident that this \r\narrangement will reinforce the channels of contact and \r\ncooperation between the Court and the United Nations. \r\n With the latest ratifications, by Saint Kitts and \r\nNevis and Comoros, the Rome Statute now has 102 \r\nStates parties. That is a clear demonstration of the \r\ngrowing awareness by the international community of \r\nthe need to combat war crimes, genocide and crimes \r\nagainst humanity in a collective manner. The \r\nestablishment of the Court brought forth a new and \r\ndecisive tool for the defence of human rights and for \r\nthe promotion of justice and the rule of law, for the \r\nbenefit of all. On the one hand, the very existence of \r\nthe Court ensures that the perpetrators of the serious \r\ncrimes defined in the Rome Statute can no longer \r\nexpect impunity. On the other, the provisions of the \r\nStatute offer adequate and sufficient guarantees against \r\nany possible abuses and that the Court will not be used \r\nto pursue illegitimate political objectives. \r\n Mr. Penjo (Bhutan), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n The ability of the ICC to fulfil its high functions \r\ndepends upon the support it receives from States. The \r\nCourt needs the effective support of all States parties, \r\nbut also that of the international community as a \r\nwhole. We therefore encourage all States that have not \r\nyet become parties to the Rome Statute to ratify it or \r\naccede to it, thereby strengthening our common \r\ninternational endeavour to uphold human rights, the \r\npromotion of justice and the rule of law. \r\n Mr. Muchemi (Kenya): Allow me to extend my \r\ndelegation’s gratitude to Judge Philippe Kirsch, \r\nPresident of the International Criminal Court (ICC), for \r\nthe able manner in which he has continued to steer the \r\nactivities of the Court. It is evident from the report \r\n(A/61/217) that he presented to us this morning that the \r\nCourt has made significant progress both in its \r\nadministrative activities and in its judicial work. We \r\nwish to align ourselves with the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of South Africa on behalf of the African \r\nStates parties to the Statute of the International \r\nCriminal Court. \r\n The ICC is now a fully functional judicial \r\ninstitution with an established field presence. It has \r\nmade substantial progress in the ongoing investigations \r\nin northern Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo and Darfur in the Sudan. We particularly \r\nwelcome the first arrests in respect of the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo and expect that the initial trial \r\nwill set the pace for further trials and increase \r\nconfidence in the Court. \r\n We wish to emphasize that cooperation from \r\nMember States and from other international \r\norganizations is a prerequisite to the success of the \r\nCourt. In that regard, we are gratified that the Court \r\nhas over the past year developed a comprehensive \r\nframework for institutional cooperation with the \r\nUnited Nations as well as with States and regional \r\norganizations. It is evident that the Court’s cooperative \r\narrangements with the United Nations have been \r\ninstrumental in the success of the activities of the \r\nCourt in all of the situations under investigation by the \r\nCourt. We applaud that approach by the Court and urge \r\nstrengthened and enhanced cooperation with the United \r\nNations as provided for under the Relationship \r\nAgreement. \r\n We also note with gratitude that the European \r\nUnion and the Government of Austria have concluded \r\ncooperation agreements with the Court with regard to \r\njudicial assistance, the arrest and surrender of victims \r\nand the acceptance of persons sentenced by the Court. \r\nWe recognize that the Court does not have its own \r\npolice force to execute its orders in relation to arrests \r\nand surrenders. Nor does it have its own prisons. The \r\ncooperation of States parties on those matters is thus \r\ncritical to facilitate the operations of the Court and to \r\nhelp it achieve its mandate. We urge the Court to \r\nintensify its efforts to conclude negotiations on \r\ncooperation arrangements both with States parties and \r\nwith regional organizations. Considering that all the \r\nsituations currently under investigation are in Africa, \r\nwe look forward to the early conclusion of a \r\ncooperation agreement with the African Union. \r\n We applaud the Court for its intensive outreach \r\nprogrammes in the areas currently under investigation. \r\nVery often, the communities that have suffered the \r\nhorrendous crimes under the Court’s jurisdiction have \r\nlittle appreciation or understanding of the role and \r\nwork of the Court. The outreach programmes help to \r\npromote acceptance of the Court and assist victims to \r\nrealize their rights under the Statute. We thus look \r\nforward to receiving, at the Assembly of States Parties \r\nthis autumn, a composite strategy on the Court’s \r\noutreach programmes. \r\n A/61/PV.27\r\n \r\n15 06-56837 \r\n \r\n At this juncture, I wish to comment briefly on the \r\nprovisions of the Rome Statute in relation to the \r\nprinciple of complementarity of the Court’s \r\njurisdiction. The primary responsibility for prosecuting \r\nthose responsible for genocide, crimes against \r\nhumanity and war crimes falls within national \r\njurisdictions. The Court assumes responsibility only \r\nwhen it becomes evident that the concerned State is \r\nunable or unwilling to prosecute those crimes. It is our \r\nunderstanding that this core principle of the Statute \r\nshould override other considerations and inform the \r\ndecisions of the Court in carrying out investigations \r\nand conducting proceedings.  \r\n Thus, we urge close collaboration and dialogue \r\nbetween the Court and the States of original \r\njurisdiction. In that connection, it is important to \r\nremember that in most situations of genocide, war \r\ncrimes and crimes against humanity, the victims have \r\nbeen exposed to long periods and episodes of conflict; \r\nfocusing on processes while turning a blind eye to \r\nsustainable peace can thus be counter-productive. \r\nPeace and justice are not mutually exclusive and \r\nshould be addressed simultaneously. \r\n I wish to reaffirm my Government’s commitment \r\nto the work of the ICC and to pledge its continued \r\ncooperation with the Court. We ratified the ICC Statute \r\nin March 2005, and the legislative procedures for its \r\ndomestication are at an advanced stage. We welcome \r\nthe recent ratifications by Saint Kitts and Nevis and the \r\nRepublic of Comoros, which have brought the total \r\nmembership to 102 States. We encourage further \r\nratifications by States that have not yet done so, in \r\norder to achieve universality of the Statute. \r\n We appeal to all States Members of the \r\nOrganization to work individually and collectively \r\ntowards the achievement of the ideals of the Rome \r\nStatute: to contribute to long-lasting respect for, and \r\nthe enforcement of, international criminal justice in \r\norder to prevent and to fight impunity for the most \r\nserious crimes of an international character. \r\n Mr. Khair (Jordan): Allow me, on behalf of my. \r\ndelegation, to warmly welcome the President of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC), Judge Philippe \r\nKirsch, and to thank him for his report to the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Two years ago, the President of the Court and the \r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations concluded the \r\nRelationship Agreement between the Court and the \r\nOrganization. That relationship has since matured and \r\nwill continue to strengthen as the demands made on the \r\nCourt continue to mount. In that context, my \r\ndelegation expresses its deepest gratitude to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan for the tremendous support \r\nprovided by him and the Organization to the ICC. It is \r\nour earnest wish that Mr. Annan’s successor will follow \r\nin his footsteps. The world can afford nothing less. \r\n Today, as we review the most recent annual report \r\nof the Court (A/61/217), we are mindful of the \r\ncontinued suffering caused to victims in many areas of \r\nconflict around the globe — suffering as a consequence \r\nof genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. \r\nIt has become more important than ever that the United \r\nNations place victims and their plight at the centre of \r\nall its considerations. \r\n Jordan welcomes the report submitted by the \r\nCourt to the General Assembly, which describes the \r\nmain developments related to the Court’s activities \r\nover the past year, including the unsealing of the first \r\narrest warrants by the Court and the first proceedings \r\nagainst an accused. Those developments mark a turning \r\npoint in the history of the Court. Jordan values the \r\nefforts of the Office of the Prosecutor and commends \r\nthe Court for its efforts to enhance understanding and \r\nawareness of its role and activities in relation to both \r\nproceedings and investigations among local \r\npopulations in situation areas. \r\n Jordan takes note with satisfaction of the first \r\nversion of the Court’s strategic plan, adopted early this \r\nyear, and is pleased with the developments relevant to \r\nthe relationship between the Court and the United \r\nNations, especially in the areas of information sharing \r\nand international cooperation. In that regard, Jordan \r\nwelcomes the establishment of the Court’s liaison \r\noffice in New York. \r\n Jordan is aware of the difficult conditions on the \r\nground under which the Court has to work. Jordan calls \r\nupon all States, relevant regional organizations and \r\nUnited Nations operations to engage positively with \r\nthe Court, to provide it with the necessary support in \r\nthe field and to help it carry out its mandate by \r\nproviding it with the necessary operational assistance. \r\n Jordan reaffirms its continuous support for the \r\nICC, — support that is due to its firm belief in the \r\npurposes of its creation. Jordan also believes that a \r\nfunctional and effective International Criminal Court \r\nA/61/PV.27  \r\n \r\n06-56837 16 \r\n \r\nwhose Statute is always respected is in the national \r\ninterests of every State. \r\n Mr. Chávez (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): I wish at \r\nthe outset to thank the President of the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC) for his introduction of the \r\ncomprehensive and detailed report on the work of the \r\nCourt during the period 1 August 2005 to 1 August \r\n2006 (A/61/217). I also wish to reaffirm Peru’s \r\ncommitment to helping the ICC to effectively fulfil its \r\nmandate and to enhance the integrity of its Statute. \r\n The adoption of the Rome Statute was a historic \r\nmoment. The international community decided not to \r\ntolerate impunity for crimes that are the greatest \r\naffronts to the human person: genocide, crimes against \r\nhumanity and war crimes. The ICC was thus conceived \r\nnot only as an effective tool for punishing those \r\nresponsible for these crimes, but also as a means of \r\npreventing and deterring the commission of such \r\natrocities. \r\n What was once a wish is now a functioning \r\nreality. We have a fully operational International \r\nCriminal Court that is shouldering the lofty \r\nresponsibilities entrusted to it and is thus helping to \r\nachieve the purposes of the United Nations, \r\nparticularly respect for human rights and the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.  \r\n Among the most notable developments during the \r\nperiod covered by the report, we must mention the \r\nunsealing of the first arrest warrants, the beginning of \r\nthe first proceedings against an accused and the \r\nprogress made in the investigation of the situations \r\nbeing considered by the Office of the Prosecutor. \r\n With regard to the first proceedings against an \r\naccused, Peru is particularly pleased at having \r\nparticipated, as Chair of the Security Council \r\nCommittee established pursuant to Council resolution \r\n1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo, in the process that led to the lifting of the \r\ntravel ban imposed against Thomas Lubanga Dyilo for \r\nthe purpose of his surrender to the Court. As that case \r\ndemonstrates, if the ICC is to carry out its functions, it \r\nmust receive the support and cooperation of States, \r\ninternational organizations, non-governmental \r\norganizations and society in general. \r\n Indeed, the progress made over the past year in \r\njudicial investigations and proceedings is due to the \r\ncooperation and assistance that the Court has received. \r\nThose matters still involve enormous challenges and \r\nrequire greater cooperation and assistance. For \r\nexample, none of the members of the Lord’s Resistance \r\nArmy — who are accused of crimes against humanity \r\nor war crimes — has yet been arrested or surrendered \r\nto the Court. That is a situation that Peru regrets. \r\nTherefore, Peru urges all States and the United \r\nNations, and particularly the Security Council, to \r\ncooperate to ensure the effectiveness of the arrest \r\nwarrants and to support the Office of the Prosecutor in \r\nits commendable work to seek justice and combat \r\nimpunity, particularly in the situations in Uganda and \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and the \r\nsituation in Darfur, the Sudan, referred to the Court by \r\nthe Security Council in its resolution 1593 (2005). \r\nWith regard to the latter situation, we should recall that \r\nthe Prosecutor has stated that the cooperation of the \r\nGovernment of the Sudan and other parties is vital and \r\nthat the assistance of organizations with a significant \r\npresence on the ground remains essential. \r\n As the President of the Court indicated in his \r\npresentation, the investigations being conducted on the \r\nground by the Office of the Prosecutor are facing \r\nsecurity problems both for Court staff and for \r\nwitnesses and victims. Therefore, cooperation among \r\nStates and the cooperation that should develop between \r\nthe Court and the United Nations under the \r\nRelationship Agreement signed between them are of \r\nthe utmost importance. The cooperation and assistance \r\nprovided by the missions and organs of the United \r\nNations system, as described in the report, are \r\nwelcome. However, they must continue to increase, \r\nbecause without such essential support on the ground, \r\nthe work of the Court — particularly the work of the \r\nOffice of the Prosecutor — would be even more \r\ndifficult or practically impossible. We are certain that, \r\nthrough the establishment of the liaison office in New \r\nYork, operational cooperation with the United Nations \r\nwill become closer.  \r\n The assistance that the ICC is providing to the \r\nSpecial Court for Sierra Leone with regard to the trial of \r\nformer President Charles Taylor of Liberia, and to the \r\nInternational Independent Investigation Commission — \r\nthrough the appointment of the Court’s Deputy \r\nProsecutor for Investigations as Commissioner — show \r\nthe ICC’s substantive contribution to a more \r\ncomprehensive system for promoting international \r\ncriminal justice. The Court not only prosecutes those \r\nallegedly responsible for the most horrendous crimes \r\n A/61/PV.27\r\n \r\n17 06-56837 \r\n \r\nand serves as a means of prevention and deterrence, but \r\nalso cooperates with other institutions with similar \r\nobjectives. Thus, it promotes an international system in \r\nwhich respect for the rule of law prevails. \r\n Mrs. Mladineo (Croatia): It is our great pleasure \r\nto welcome to the General Assembly Judge Philippe \r\nKirsch, President of the International Criminal Court \r\n(ICC), and to thank him for presenting the Court’s \r\nannual report (A/61/217). \r\n Today, it may seem almost natural that our debate \r\non work of the International Criminal Court should \r\nfollow our consideration of the work of the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former \r\nYugoslavia (ICTY) and of the International Criminal \r\nTribunal for Rwanda (ICTR). A permanent and \r\nuniversal criminal court seems a logical extension of \r\nad hoc adjudication; it builds upon that experience, \r\nsolidifying and advancing the legacy of international \r\ncriminal law. Moreover, its ex ante jurisdiction has a \r\npowerful deterrent effect.  \r\n Croatia associates itself fully with the statement \r\ndelivered by the Republic of Finland on behalf of the \r\nEuropean Union. Without intending to paraphrase it, I \r\nwould like to briefly address several points. \r\n With the first trials to begin shortly, the Court is \r\nfacing a reality check. As the ICC does not have its \r\nown enforcement capabilities, our support and \r\ncooperation, which brought it to life four years ago, is \r\nno less critical today. We, the States parties, are its \r\nmissing executive arm. This responsibility has many \r\nfacets and does not fall only upon countries affected by \r\ninvestigations. Agreements on relocation may be one \r\nexample, as may agreements on the serving of \r\nsentences where widespread regional coverage is of \r\nsignificance, as the recent experience of the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former \r\nYugoslavia (ICTY) suggests. \r\n While addressing the interplay between peace and \r\njustice, some might question the impact of the ICC. \r\nHowever, we believe that peace and justice are not \r\nopposing categories. Justice is a prerequisite for lasting \r\npeace. Establishing individual criminal responsibility \r\ncan play a critical role in the reconstruction of national \r\nidentity in societies affected by conflict. We hope that \r\nthese considerations will find resonance in the work of \r\nother bodies dealing with post-conflict situations, \r\nincluding the newly founded Peacebuilding \r\nCommission. \r\n Although it is in the early years of its existence, \r\nthe Court has already made an impact in international \r\nrelations. We recognize that there is still some \r\nscepticism about its role and purpose. This may best be \r\ndeflected by observing the Court in action. We believe \r\nthat its activities so far have attested to its seriousness, \r\ntransparency and high standards. \r\n In conclusion, let me reaffirm our belief that the \r\nbest guarantee for the success of the ICC is universal \r\nparticipation. We encourage those countries which \r\nhave not yet become parties to join the Rome Statute. \r\n Mr. Kruljević (Serbia): I wish to thank Judge \r\nPhilippe Kirsch, the President of the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC) for his presentation of the report \r\nof the Court (A/61/217) today. The Republic of Serbia \r\nfully aligns itself with the statement made this morning \r\nby the representative of Finland on behalf of the \r\nEuropean Union.  \r\n The Republic of Serbia holds that the \r\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court is \r\none of the most significant events in the development \r\nof international law. It is therefore of crucial \r\nimportance that the States parties to the Rome Statute \r\ndemonstrate their full commitment to upholding the \r\nprinciples of international humanitarian law and the \r\nmaintenance of world peace and security through full \r\nand unconditional cooperation with the Court and \r\neffective implementation of the provisions of its \r\nStatute.  \r\n Furthermore, we wish to call on States to \r\ncontinue to support universal ratification of the Rome \r\nStatute and to keep the momentum to that end. We \r\nwelcome the report of the International Criminal Court \r\nas a testimony to the advance of the ongoing quest for \r\na world based on justice and accountability. The first \r\narrest pursuant to a warrant of the ICC, as well as \r\nactive investigations and pre-trial and appeals \r\nproceedings, clearly demonstrate that the Court has \r\nevolved into a fully functional judicial institution.  \r\n We also wish to commend the intensified \r\ncoordination of the Offices of the Registrar and of the \r\nProsecutor. The first proceedings have already marked \r\na turning point in the history of the Court. The way \r\nforward should eventually galvanize its position as a \r\ncustodian of the most fundamental values that we all \r\nshare and as a pillar of an international order based on \r\nthe rule of law. \r\nA/61/PV.27  \r\n \r\n06-56837 18 \r\n \r\n As much as the success of the International \r\nCriminal Court depends on the support of Member \r\nStates, it still requires more extensive collaboration \r\nwith the world’s multilateral institutions, primarily the \r\nUnited Nations, an institution founded on the very \r\nsame noble principles, in particular the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. This clearly \r\ndemonstrates the necessity of full implementation of \r\nthe Relationship Agreement between the two \r\ninstitutions. With this in mind, we view the \r\nestablishment of the ICC liaison office in New York as \r\na significant step. \r\n The Republic of Serbia, as one of the founders of \r\nthe International Criminal Court and having \r\nexperienced tragic developments in the Balkans, will \r\ndo its utmost to respect and uphold its international \r\nobligations under the Rome Statute in order to ensure \r\nthe full implementation of all legal acts of the Court in \r\ndomestic legal systems. This process has been ongoing \r\nthrough the relevant provisions in the former \r\nConstitutional Charter and through amendments to \r\nnational legislation that are fully reflected in the text of \r\nthe new Constitution of Serbia. \r\n Through their cooperation with the International \r\nCriminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), \r\nthe District Court of Belgrade and its War Crimes \r\nChamber, as well as the Office of the Prosecutor for \r\nWar Crimes of that Court, have proven their \r\nprofessional and judicial capacity to process the most \r\ncomplex cases in line with prevailing international \r\nstandards of justice. Furthermore, the District Court of \r\nBelgrade has expressed its readiness to contribute to \r\nthe establishment of an International Criminal Court \r\ndatabase which will compile all national judicial \r\ndecisions and cases pertaining to the substance of \r\ninternational criminal law, namely, crimes of genocide, \r\ncrimes against humanity and war crimes.  \r\n In addition to the fact that the Republic of Serbia \r\nwas among the first to ratify the Rome Statute, it gives \r\nme pleasure to recall the activities that my country has \r\nundertaken in order to facilitate the work of the Court. \r\nSerbia was among the first countries to ratify the \r\nAgreement on Privileges and Immunities of the ICC. In \r\naddition, we are currently in the process of negotiating \r\nan agreement on the serving of prison terms in Serbia \r\nby persons sentenced by the ICC. Furthermore, an \r\ninitiative has been launched to conclude an agreement \r\non witness protection and relocation.  \r\n With regard to the latter initiative, I wish to point \r\nout that the parliament of Serbia recently adopted a \r\nnew criminal code with provisions that fully conform \r\nto witness protection standards. Let me also point out \r\nthat Serbia has been a keen supporter of the \r\nestablishment of the Trust Fund for Victims and is \r\neagerly looking forward to its operation, having \r\nalready earmarked financial means in its budget for \r\nsupport of the Fund. \r\n My country supports the further strengthening of \r\nthe institutional capacity and activities of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court and will continue to do \r\nso, both as party to the Rome Statute and as a member \r\nof the Bureau of the Assembly of the States Parties, in \r\nwhich we are now serving our second term. At this \r\npoint, let me reiterate that we believe that the only way \r\nto further the building of the ICC’s institutional \r\ncapacity with a view to fostering the Court’s universal \r\nacceptance is to strengthen the cooperation and support \r\nof all States parties to the Rome Statute as well as of \r\nall States Members of the United Nations. \r\n Ms. Rivero (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): I have \r\nthe honour to speak on behalf of Uruguay with regard \r\nto the report (A/61/217) introduced this morning by the \r\nPresident of the International Criminal Court (ICC) on \r\nthe activities, investigations and proceedings that the \r\nCourt has carried out during this recent period. \r\n We note with pleasure the progress which the \r\nICC has consolidated in various areas. From the \r\nbeginning, Uruguay was in favour of the establishment \r\nof the Court and became a State party to the Rome \r\nStatute in the firm conviction that it was indispensable \r\nto create an organ which would complement the action \r\nof States, thus strengthening international criminal \r\njustice.  \r\n Thus, we note with satisfaction the fact that \r\nincreasingly States are grasping the importance for \r\ninternational law of increasing cooperation and \r\nassistance, which in turn will enable us to reaffirm the \r\npurposes and principles of the Charter and, in \r\nparticular, to promote justice, which is essential for the \r\nmaintenance of lasting peace. \r\n For the same reason, we welcome the fact that the \r\nCourt is dealing with cases referred to it not only by \r\nStates parties to the Statute, but also by the Security \r\nCouncil — and even by a State that is not a party. This \r\nalso demonstrates that the importance of the fight \r\nagainst impunity is increasingly perceived as an \r\n A/61/PV.27\r\n \r\n19 06-56837 \r\n \r\nindispensable step towards peaceful coexistence for \r\nhumankind. \r\n In that respect, we believe that is very important \r\nto continue activities aimed at increasing \r\nunderstanding and awareness regarding the functions \r\nof the Court, because this will help it to be more \r\neffective in its work. Even though cooperation with the \r\nUnited Nations is already a reality and is irreversible, \r\nwe are very encouraged by the recent establishment of \r\nthe liaison office of the Court, which will facilitate \r\ncontinuous follow-up of its work. We also hope that \r\nthat will help to increase cooperation. \r\n I am very proud to be able to convey good news \r\nregarding the implementation by my country of a \r\nnumber of the tasks that the General Assembly \r\nentrusted to States parties in resolution 60/29 of 23 \r\nNovember 2005. As we know, it is very important to \r\nhave good intentions, but it is even more important to \r\ncarry them out. Thus, in September, Uruguay adopted \r\ntwo laws that will enable it to comply fully with the \r\nobligations set out in the Rome Statute and to \r\ncooperate fully with the International Criminal Court. \r\n The first of those laws endorsed the Agreement \r\non the Privileges and Immunities of the International \r\nCriminal Court; we are sure that that will help us to \r\nassist the Court in carrying out its functions. The \r\nsecond measure — an initiative put forward by the \r\nsenate of the Uruguayan parliament and unanimously \r\nsupported by both chambers — resulted in the adoption \r\nof a law on genocide, crimes against humanity, war \r\ncrimes and cooperation with the International Criminal \r\nCourt. That law will enable us to implement the \r\nprovisions of the Rome Statute within the framework \r\nof the Uruguayan legal system, and will also give us an \r\nopportunity at the national level to consolidate — not \r\nonly de jure but also de facto — the essential principles \r\nof social coexistence with full respect for human \r\nrights, thereby helping to put an end to a painful \r\nchapter in our country’s history by setting a good \r\nexample for the future. \r\n I would also like to point out that that law \r\nincludes a special section — part III — governing \r\nUruguay’s cooperation and relationship with the \r\nInternational Criminal Court. Among other provisions, \r\nit provides for both the executive and judicial branches \r\nto request cooperation from the Court for \r\ninvestigations or criminal proceedings that are ongoing \r\nin our country, in accordance with article 93, paragraph \r\n10, of the Rome Statute. \r\n We believe that we are on the right path in terms \r\nof our compliance with commitments undertaken. In \r\naddition to providing a direct benefit for our people, \r\nwe want this to make a contribution to the international \r\ncommunity as a whole. \r\n Mr. Sealy (Trinidad and Tobago): Trinidad and \r\nTobago welcomes the second report (A/61/217) of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC), issued pursuant to \r\nthe Agreement between the Court and the United \r\nNations. Trinidad and Tobago also wishes to associate \r\nitself with the statement made by the representative of \r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines on behalf of the \r\nmembers of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) \r\nthat are States parties to the Rome Statute of the ICC. \r\n During the past year, the ICC has demonstrated \r\nthat the trust placed in it by members of the \r\ninternational community as a permanent penal \r\ninstitution in the fight against impunity and a beacon of \r\nhope for victims seeking justice against the \r\nperpetrators of crimes which shook the conscience of \r\nall mankind is not misplaced. In the relatively short \r\nperiod of time since the entry into force of the Rome \r\nStatute and the election of its first bench of judges, the \r\nICC has not only commenced investigations into \r\natrocities committed against hapless victims of crimes \r\nwithin its jurisdiction in the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo, in Uganda and in the Darfur region of the \r\nSudan, but was also able to receive and commence \r\nproceedings against an accused person. \r\n Trinidad and Tobago views these developments \r\nnot only as important milestones in the promotion and \r\nenforcement of the rule of law, but also as important \r\npillars in building bridges for the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. Nevertheless, we are \r\nmindful that these developments, important as they are, \r\nwere possible only because of the cooperation between \r\nthe Court and the referring States, the United Nations, \r\nStates parties and non-governmental organizations \r\n(NGOs). \r\n In this regard, we note with appreciation the \r\ncooperation agreements entered into by the Court with \r\nthe Government of Austria, the European Union and \r\nthe International Committee of the Red Cross and those \r\nto be concluded in the near future with the African \r\nUnion and the Asian-African Legal Consultative \r\nOrganization. It is only through such cooperation \r\nA/61/PV.27  \r\n \r\n06-56837 20 \r\n \r\nagreements that the Court will be able to gather \r\nevidence, provide logistical support for operations in \r\nthe field, carry out the arrest and surrender of accused \r\npersons and enforce sentences. Without the successful \r\ncompletion of these procedural requirements, the Court \r\nwill not be able to implement its mandate effectively \r\nand thereby contribute to ending impunity. \r\n Trinidad and Tobago applauds the efforts made \r\nby the Court through its outreach programme to bring \r\ngreater awareness and understanding of its work to the \r\ncommunities whose situations have been referred to it \r\neither by States or by the Security Council. We \r\nrecognize, however, that universal adherence to the \r\nRome Statute is an essential component in the fight \r\nagainst impunity wherever it may occur, and we \r\ntherefore urge States parties and others to assist the \r\nCourt in engaging in outreach activities aimed at \r\npromoting increased ratification of and accession to the \r\nStatute. \r\n In this vein, Trinidad and Tobago continues to \r\nwork with the NGO community and the CARICOM \r\nsecretariat in promoting ratification and accession in \r\nthe Caribbean region, and it welcomes the recent \r\naccession to the Statute by the Government of Saint \r\nKitts and Nevis. \r\n Trinidad and Tobago’s commitment to the Rome \r\nStatute is long-standing. In this connection, \r\ncomprehensive legislation was recently enacted at the \r\ninternal level giving full domestic legal effect to the \r\nRome Statute. \r\n In March of this year, six judges started their \r\nterms of office for a nine-year period. This was the \r\nresult of a process of transparent elections which \r\nresulted in the re-election of five judges and the \r\nelection of a new female member of the Court, \r\nProfessor Ekaterina Trendafilova of Bulgaria. We \r\nwould also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute \r\nto Judge Neroni Slade of Samoa for his important \r\ncontributions to the initial work of the Court. \r\n We have also witnessed the establishment of the \r\nNew York liaison office in an effort to assist the ICC in \r\nthe area of cooperation with the United Nations. We \r\nview the establishment of that office as another \r\nopportunity for the Court to gain greater visibility in \r\nthe international community as represented here in \r\nNew York, which we hope will lead to its universal \r\nacceptance. The same could be said of the decision by \r\nthe Assembly of States Parties to hold its resumed fifth \r\nsession and its sixth session in New York in 2007. \r\n The report of the ICC comes at a time when the \r\ninternational community has not been able to achieve \r\nthe international peace and security and respect for \r\ninternational law, in particular international human \r\nrights law and international humanitarian law, \r\ncontemplated by the founders of the United Nations. \r\nDespite the sometimes seemingly unattainable goal of \r\nachieving the aforementioned objectives, Trinidad and \r\nTobago strongly believes that the ICC represents hope \r\nfor all mankind. \r\n Although the ICC is not directly involved in the \r\nprosecution of accused persons before the International \r\nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda or before the Special \r\nCourt for Sierra Leone, it is providing critical support \r\nto those tribunals. The level of support goes beyond \r\nmere cooperation in an emerging system of \r\ninternational criminal justice. It is, moreover, a \r\nconsequence of the growing recognition of the ICC as \r\na court that is truly special, not only because of its \r\npermanent nature as an organ to prosecute and punish \r\nthose who commit crimes within its jurisdiction and to \r\nbring relief to victims through the provision of \r\nreparations and other forms of assistance, but also \r\nbecause of its cadre of distinguished judges, \r\nprosecutors, registrars and general staff, who continue \r\nto meet the daily challenges which bedevil this new \r\ninstitution, established by all of us — people of \r\nconscience who dared to declare that the perpetrators \r\nof crimes against humanity and other heinous crimes \r\nshould not go unpunished. \r\n Mr. Shinyo (Japan): I would like to thank Judge \r\nPhilippe Kirsch for his in-depth report on the most \r\nrecent work of the International Criminal Court (ICC) \r\nand to welcome the considerable progress that the \r\nCourt has made in its investigative and judicial \r\nproceedings over the past year. \r\n The ICC represents the culmination of the efforts \r\nof the international community after the Second World \r\nWar to create a permanent international tribunal in the \r\nfield of criminal justice. Japan attaches great \r\nimportance to this enterprise. Japan consistently \r\nsupported the establishment of the ICC, actively \r\nparticipating in ICC-related meetings, including the \r\nRome Diplomatic Conference of 1998, at which the \r\nStatute creating the ICC was adopted. Although Japan \r\nhas yet to accede to the Statute of the ICC, it fully \r\n A/61/PV.27\r\n \r\n21 06-56837 \r\n \r\nrecognizes the importance of becoming a State party so \r\nthat it can effectively support the Court, with a view to \r\neradicating and preventing the most serious crimes, \r\nthereby strengthening the rule of law in the \r\ninternational community. \r\n The Government of Japan is redoubling its efforts \r\nto prepare for accession to the Statute. Japan’s \r\naccession will entail a substantial financial obligation \r\nin the form of an annual assessed contribution, which \r\nrequires careful assessment against the backdrop of \r\nJapan’s serious fiscal deficits. In this regard, we \r\nbelieve that the principles on which the United Nations \r\nscale of assessments is based, including the maximum \r\nassessment rate — the ceiling — should be applied to \r\nthe scale for assessing contributions of States parties to \r\nthe ICC. This position is based on a straightforward \r\ninterpretation of the Rome Statute and other relevant \r\nrules. Without the confirmation of this interpretation, it \r\nwould become almost impossible for Japan to accede \r\nto the Rome Statute, as it could not garner the \r\nnecessary public support. Japan encourages the States \r\nparties to the ICC to confirm this interpretation at the \r\nnext Assembly of States Parties. \r\n Japan hopes that the ICC will continue to work \r\ndiligently towards the eradication of the culture of \r\nimpunity and to enhance its good reputation as the only \r\npermanent international criminal court in the world. \r\n Mr. Kanu (Sierra Leone): Sierra Leone \r\nassociates itself with the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of South Africa on behalf of the African \r\nStates parties to the Rome Statute. However, we wish \r\nto make the following remarks from our national \r\nperspective. \r\n The second report of the International Criminal \r\nCourt to the Assembly (A/61/217) comes eight years \r\nafter the adoption of the Rome Statute by a large \r\nnumber of States, including my country, Sierra Leone. \r\nTo be precise, 102 Member States have ratified the \r\nStatute. The International Criminal Court (ICC) has \r\ncome a long way since Rome. Therefore, I wish at this \r\njuncture to thank the President of the ICC, Judge \r\nPhilippe Kirsch, for his report and for his leadership of \r\nthe Court. \r\n Even though the judicial phase of the Court has \r\nbegun in earnest, there is still a lot of work to be done. \r\nNotwithstanding this, we thank the Prosecutor and his \r\nefficient team for a job well done under extremely \r\ndifficult circumstances. In this regard, we believe that \r\nthe unfettered cooperation of States, especially those in \r\nareas where investigations are ongoing, is crucial for \r\nthe work of the Court. Here, regional organizations like \r\nthe African Union can play a significant role in \r\nsecuring the cooperation of States in affected areas. \r\nSuch cooperation will enhance the capacity of the \r\nCourt to bring to justice the perpetrators of heinous \r\ncrimes that prick the conscience of humanity. We wish \r\nto thank the African Union for the cooperation and \r\nassistance that it has afforded the Court. \r\n There is a need for continued effective \r\ncollaboration between the United Nations and the \r\nCourt. The United Nations is a universal Organization. \r\nThe cooperation and support of the United Nations is \r\ncrucial if the International Criminal Court is to fully \r\nbecome an effective international criminal justice \r\ninstitution. There is a great need for the universal \r\nratification of the Statute. We therefore call on all of \r\nour friends who have not yet signed or ratified the \r\nStatute to do so as soon a possible. \r\n We can see that the Court, under the leadership of \r\nPresident Kirsch, has a vision of where it intends to be \r\nin the future for the benefit of humanity. However, it is \r\nsad to note that the Court still has detractors. We hope \r\nand trust that the signs of a change of attitude towards \r\nthe Court that we are now witnessing will ultimately \r\nlead to universal or near-universal participation in the \r\nStatute. \r\n I wish at this juncture to reiterate some comments \r\nthat we as African member States made in the debate \r\non this item last year when considering the strategic \r\nvision of the Court. \r\n First, we want to see evidence that the Court is \r\nadopting a resource-based, rather than a demand-based, \r\nstrategy. We would like the Court to address this \r\nconcern. Secondly, we expressed the view that justice \r\nmust not only be done but must be seen to be done. We \r\nhave a preference for holding hearings in the region — \r\nand, as far as practicable, in the country — where the \r\ncrimes are committed. The Special Court for Sierra \r\nLeone is an eloquent example of this. In this regard, we \r\nwelcome the statement that the Court will, where \r\npossible, try to conduct trials in the countries or \r\nregions where the crimes are committed. This is very \r\ngratifying. \r\n Since I am talking about the Special Court for \r\nSierra Leone during this debate on the report of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court, permit me to digress \r\nA/61/PV.27  \r\n \r\n06-56837 22 \r\n \r\nfurther and appeal to this Assembly on behalf of the \r\nSpecial Court. The Special Court is now in a critical \r\nphase of its operation — the Charles Taylor trial will \r\nstart next year — but needs funds. I would therefore \r\nlike to take advantage of this rostrum to appeal to the \r\ninternational community to handsomely support the \r\nSpecial Court for Sierra Leone. The success of the \r\nCourt is crucial for the consolidation of the peace \r\nprocess in Sierra Leone. We would like to thank the \r\nCourt and its President for their cooperation with and \r\nassistance to the Special Court for Sierra Leone. This \r\ncooperation and support is very important for regional \r\nstability. \r\n Returning to the ICC, my delegation urges the \r\nProsecutor to aggressively pursue those who have been \r\nindicted. Earlier, one speaker referred to the situation \r\nin Uganda. \r\n Moreover, the States in which perpetrators are \r\nhiding must demonstrate their political will and \r\ncommitment by transferring them to the Court. In that \r\nregard, we welcome the work that the Court has done \r\non outreach. We urge the Court to undertake an \r\nextensive outreach programme purposefully geared \r\ntowards explaining what the ICC is about, what it is \r\nseeking to achieve and the crimes that are within its \r\njurisdiction. It must be amply demonstrated that the \r\nCourt is truly international and that it does not belong \r\nto any particular region or people. \r\n In conclusion, let me once again call on all States \r\nto assist the Court, because its ability to fulfil its \r\nmandate depends heavily on such assistance. In \r\naddition, the Trust Fund for Victims has become \r\nvirtually operational. The international community \r\nmust demonstrate its commitment to victims by making \r\nfinancial contributions to the Trust Fund. The ICC is \r\nthe first international tribunal to give recognition to the \r\nvictims of heinous crimes, and the Trust Fund is a \r\npractical way to demonstrate that recognition. I say \r\nwith regret that the Special Court did not see fit to do \r\nthe same. \r\n I should like to conclude by saying that there is \r\nno peace without justice; the International Criminal \r\nCourt is a symbol of that maxim. \r\n Mr. Mukongo Ngay (Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo) (spoke in French): At the outset, I should like \r\nto confirm my delegation’s support for the statement \r\nmade earlier by the representative of South Africa on \r\nbehalf of the States parties to the Rome Statute \r\nbelonging to the Group of African States. \r\n Notwithstanding the possible success of the \r\nelections now under way in my country, the challenge \r\nof normalizing democracy in the Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo will remain only a cherished dream if the \r\ntransition from war to peace and democracy does not \r\ninclude the components of administering justice and \r\ncombating impunity. To build and maintain a lasting \r\npeace, the Democratic Republic of the Congo must \r\nmake progress in re-establishing the rule of law, which \r\nrequires good administration of justice to truly curb \r\nimpunity. That is one of the reasons why, from this \r\nrostrum, I wish to reaffirm my country’s commitment \r\nto the International Criminal Court (ICC).  \r\n In that connection, on behalf of my delegation \r\nand on my own account, I should like to congratulate \r\nMr. Philippe Kirsch, President of the Court, on the \r\nCourt’s second annual report to the United Nations \r\n(A/61/217), which is just as comprehensive and \r\nenlightening as the first. The Court can be assured of \r\nmy delegation’s full cooperation in its relations with \r\nmy country. \r\n While very recently we were still welcoming the \r\nProsecutor’s opening of the first investigations and the \r\nunsealing of the first international arrest warrants, the \r\nCourt is now in the process of beginning its first trial \r\nwith the arrest and transfer to the Court of Mr. Thomas \r\nLubanga. That proves that the dream of international \r\ncriminal justice has become a reality and that the Court \r\nis resolutely engaged in the fight against impunity for \r\nthe most serious crimes, which have shocked the \r\ncollective conscience of humanity for so long. \r\n The war in my country has bred enormous \r\nprejudice against the very people who have paid a \r\nheavy price. In that context, aiding the victims — as \r\npreviously emphasized by the Secretary-General in his \r\nreport on the rule of law and transitional justice in \r\nconflict and post-conflict societies (S/2004/616) — \r\nalso requires well-designed compensation programmes, \r\nwhich guarantee that justice is interested not only in \r\nthe guilty, but also in those men and women who have \r\nsuffered at their hands. \r\n That issue is of most interest to the victims, who \r\nhope to obtain through the Court the necessary \r\nreparations, restitution of their property and substantial \r\ncompensation for the losses they have suffered, \r\nparticularly because it has been established that the \r\n A/61/PV.27\r\n \r\n23 06-56837 \r\n \r\nCourt can set the amount of reparations — even if the \r\nvictims have not specifically requested it to do so — \r\nwhen it determines that they are not in a position to do \r\nthat themselves. \r\n My delegation believes that, in addition to all the \r\ninitiatives it has already undertaken, the Court will be \r\nable to play its full role only if it can meet the \r\nexpectations of devastated people in faraway regions of \r\nthe world who are clamouring for justice. Seen from \r\nthat perspective, the expectations of the Congolese \r\npeople are certainly high. However, we should note \r\nthat they are aware of the limits of the Court’s action, \r\nparticularly because of the application of the principle \r\nof complementarity and because of the average length \r\nof an investigation, which varies from six months to \r\nthree years, while a trial can last a year. \r\n Last year, from this rostrum, my delegation called \r\nthe Court’s attention to the need to objectively inform \r\npeople in situation countries and to educate them about \r\nthe basic rules of the ICC Statute and Rules of \r\nProcedure and Evidence through public campaigns and \r\nthrough seminars and other professional forums. Sound \r\nknowledge of the rights to which they are entitled will \r\nenable them to make appropriate claims.  \r\n My delegation is pleased to learn that the Court \r\nhas already held workshops and seminars in the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo for specialized \r\naudiences such as judicial authorities, attorneys, \r\nmembers of non-governmental organizations and \r\njournalists. We also welcome the Court’s awareness-\r\nraising activities in the field regarding victims’ \r\nparticipation in its procedures and the reparations to \r\nwhich they are entitled. My delegation would like to \r\nstrongly encourage the continuation of those activities. \r\nWe call for a closer relationship between the \r\ninternational criminal justice system and those under \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nits jurisdiction, particularly through the holding of on-\r\nsite hearings in those regions of the world that have \r\nexperienced the horrors of crimes within its purview. \r\n Since it has been established that the ICC cannot \r\nreplace national justice systems, recourse to the \r\ncompetence of national courts will remain the rule, \r\ngiven the principle of complementarity. That is why the \r\ninstruments of ratification of the Agreement on the \r\nPrivileges and Immunities of the International Criminal \r\nCourt, recently authorized by the Congolese \r\nparliament, will be deposited with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. Draft legislation implementing the Rome \r\nStatute has already been submitted for the \r\nconsideration of parliament, where its adoption will be \r\na priority on the agenda of that national institution. \r\n I should like to take this opportunity to recall my \r\ndelegation’s interest in the discussions of the Special \r\nWorking Group on the Crime of Aggression, whose \r\nconclusions will serve to supplement the provisions of \r\nthe ICC Statute. The Statute provides that the Court \r\nwill exercise competence regarding the crime of \r\naggression when a provision has been adopted under \r\narticles 121 and 123. Such a provision will define the \r\ncrime of aggression and set the conditions for exercise \r\nof the Court’s competence in that regard. \r\n Finally, I wish to reaffirm the will of my \r\ndelegation to respect the integrity of the Court’s \r\nStatute. I invite delegations that have not yet done so to \r\njoin the mechanism of the International Criminal \r\nCourt, which ensures the universality of the fight \r\nagainst impunity. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on this agenda item. The General \r\nAssembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 74. \r\n The meeting rose at 5.30 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
