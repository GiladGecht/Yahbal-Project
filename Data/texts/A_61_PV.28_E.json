(Bahrain) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 122 \r\n \r\n \r\nScale of assessments for the apportionment of the \r\nexpenses of the United Nations \r\n \r\n Report of the Fifth Committee (A/61/512) \r\n The President: If there is no proposal under rule \r\n66 of the rules of procedure, I shall take it that the \r\nGeneral Assembly decides not to discuss the report of \r\nthe Fifth Committee that is before the Assembly today. \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President: Statements will therefore be \r\nlimited to explanations of vote. The positions of \r\ndelegations regarding the recommendation of the Fifth \r\nCommittee have been made clear in the Committee and \r\nare reflected in the relevant official records. \r\n May I remind members that under paragraph 7 of \r\ndecision 34/401, the General Assembly agreed that  \r\n “When the same draft resolution is considered in \r\na Main Committee and in plenary meeting, a \r\ndelegation should, as far as possible, explain its \r\nvote only once, i.e., either in the Committee or in \r\nplenary meeting, unless that delegation’s vote in \r\nplenary meeting is different from its vote in the \r\nCommittee.” \r\n May I remind delegations that, also in accordance \r\nwith General Assembly decision 34/401, explanations \r\nof vote are limited to 10 minutes. \r\n Before we begin to take action on the \r\nrecommendation contained in the report of the Fifth \r\nCommittee, I should like to advise representatives that \r\nwe are going to proceed to take a decision in the same \r\nmanner as was done in the Fifth Committee. \r\n The Assembly will now take a decision on the \r\ndraft resolution recommended by the Fifth Committee \r\nin paragraph 6 of its report. The Fifth Committee \r\nadopted the draft resolution without a vote. May I take \r\nit that the Assembly wishes to do the same? \r\n The draft resolution was adopted (resolution \r\n61/2). \r\n The President: The Assembly has thus concluded \r\nthis stage of its consideration of agenda item 122. \r\n \r\nAgenda items 48 and 62 \r\n \r\n \r\n2001-2010: Decade to Roll Back Malaria in \r\nDeveloping Countries, Particularly in Africa \r\n \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/61/218 and \r\nCorr.1) \r\n \r\n \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development: progress \r\nin implementation and international support \r\n \r\n \r\nA/61/PV.28  \r\n \r\n06-56843 2 \r\n \r\n (a) New Partnership for Africa’s Development: \r\nprogress in implementation and international \r\nsupport \r\n \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/61/212) \r\n \r\n \r\n (b) Causes of conflict and the promotion of durable \r\npeace and sustainable development in Africa \r\n \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/61/213) \r\n \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/61/69 and \r\nAdd.1) \r\n \r\n The President: The General Assembly meets \r\ntoday to discuss three interrelated agenda items — \r\nnamely, agenda item 48, “2001-2010: Decade to Roll \r\nBack Malaria in Developing Countries, Particularly in \r\nAfrica”; agenda item 62 (a): “New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development: progress in implementation and \r\ninternational support”; and finally, agenda item 62 (b): \r\n“Causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace \r\nand sustainable development in Africa”. \r\n The New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(NEPAD) marked the first time that an African \r\ndevelopment framework had emerged as a focal and \r\nrallying point for the international community’s \r\nsupport for the continent and as a basis for a new \r\npartnership. It is an Africa-owned-and-led process that \r\nreflects African leaders’ common vision and shared \r\ncommitment to eradicating poverty and to placing their \r\ncountries, both individually and collectively, on the \r\npath to sustainable growth and development. \r\n Its adoption five years ago promised a new socio-\r\neconomic revival for Africa — a multi-stakeholder \r\npartnership for a region that is still striving to \r\novercome years of conflict, political instability, disease \r\nand poor economic performance. Much has been \r\nachieved since its adoption; yet, more needs to be done \r\nto translate commitments and vision into concrete \r\nmeasures and to build on the momentum generated in \r\n2005, which was designated as the Year of Africa. \r\n The present report on NEPAD (A/61/212) is the \r\nfourth consolidated report of the Secretary-General on \r\nprogress in implementation and international support \r\nfor NEPAD. It is encouraging to note that the report \r\nrecognizes progress in the key priority areas of \r\nNEPAD, ranging from infrastructure to information \r\nand communication technologies, to education and \r\nhealth, environment, agriculture, science and \r\ntechnology, gender mainstreaming and the African Peer \r\nReview Mechanism. The report reflects the recognition \r\nof the progress made since last year, but it also \r\nunderlines the importance of undertaking policy \r\nmeasures to accelerate its implementation. \r\n The report of the World Health Organization \r\n(WHO) before the Assembly today (A/61/218) states \r\nthat malaria remains largely a killer of children and \r\npoor people and continues to threaten the lives of at \r\nleast 3 billion people in 107 countries and territories. \r\nEach year, more than 500 million people suffer from \r\nacute malaria, resulting in the loss of over a million \r\nlives, 86 per cent of which occur in sub-Saharan \r\nAfrica. \r\n It saddens me to say that at least 3,000 children \r\ndie from malaria every day, mostly in Africa. \r\nInternational efforts since the beginning of the decade \r\nhave faced some serious obstacles and setbacks. \r\nHowever, with the establishment of the WHO Global \r\nMalaria Programme at the beginning of 2006, \r\nproviding a cohesive and strengthened response to the \r\nneeds of malaria-endemic Member States, and the \r\nlaunching in February of the WHO guidelines for the \r\ntreatment of malaria, some hopeful signs have \r\nemerged. \r\n Lastly, we have before us today the report entitled \r\n“Implementation of the recommendations contained in \r\nthe report of the Secretary-General on the causes of \r\nconflict and the promotion of durable peace and \r\nsustainable development in Africa” (A/61/213). The \r\nreport notes that, while steady progress is being made \r\nin preventing, managing and resolving conflict and in \r\nbuilding and consolidating peace, increased and \r\nconcerted action is needed to prevent simmering crises \r\nfrom escalating and to ensure that the hard-won peace \r\nin countries emerging from conflict becomes \r\nirreversible. \r\n I fully concur with the Secretary-General that \r\npeace agreements must involve a broader group of \r\nnational stakeholders and go beyond political and \r\nsecurity issues by considering critical economic \r\ndimensions at an early stage. Peace agreements that \r\ncommitted all signatory parties to genuinely addressing \r\nthe need for transparent natural resource and revenue \r\nmanagement mechanisms, equitable distribution of \r\nresources, poverty eradication and anticorruption \r\nmeasures would lead to earlier and more sustainable \r\n A/61/PV.28\r\n \r\n3 06-56843 \r\n \r\npeace dividends for the population and thereby reduce \r\nthe likelihood of the recurrence of conflict. \r\n I am convinced that the establishment of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, whose Fund was launched \r\nyesterday, will ensure that countries do not face a \r\nshortfall in assistance and prevent them from lapsing \r\ninto major conflict. The report also directs our \r\nattention to the relationship between conflict and \r\nnatural resources, the impact of youth unemployment \r\non conflict and the challenges of disarmament, \r\ndemobilization and reintegration, all of which are \r\ncross-cutting issues requiring our sustained \r\nengagement. \r\n I concur with the report where it states that the \r\nachievement of a conflict-free Africa by 2010 will \r\nrequire greater political will and increased technical \r\nand financial assistance to African countries, regional \r\norganizations and civil society. \r\n Conflicts, disease and poor economic growth \r\nhave hindered many African countries for decades and \r\nhave hampered the region’s quest for a durable peace \r\nand sustainable development. The adoption of NEPAD \r\nfive years ago provided the framework for a better \r\nfuture, but as the Secretary-General states in his report, \r\ngreater efforts are required to effectively address the \r\nobstacles that hinder progress — youth unemployment, \r\nthe devastating social, economic and political impact \r\nof HIV/AIDS, the illicit exploitation of natural \r\nresources and the illegal flows of small arms. We need \r\nto tackle, in a coherent manner, these obstacles in order \r\nto achieve tangible and sustainable results. \r\n Mr. Kumalo (South Africa): On behalf of the \r\nGroup of 77 and China, we wish to thank the \r\nSecretary-General for his three reports on the items we \r\nare discussing today: the Decade to Roll Back Malaria \r\nin Developing Countries, Particularly in Africa, the \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) \r\nand the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable \r\npeace and sustainable development in Africa. \r\n Five years ago, African heads of State and \r\nGovernment signed the Abuja Declaration and Plan of \r\nAction that committed African countries to reaching \r\nspecific targets on malaria prevention and control by \r\n2005. Although much progress has been made in the \r\nfight against malaria, major interventions are still \r\nneeded. Last year, malaria claimed more than a million \r\nlives worldwide, 90 per cent of which were African and \r\nmostly children. It is quite clear that combating malaria \r\ncan only be achieved if there is concerted and \r\ncoordinated action among all stakeholders to fully \r\nimplement all commitments that have been made on \r\ncombating malaria in all the outcomes of all the major \r\nconferences and summits. \r\n We call upon the international community to \r\ncontinue supporting the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \r\nTuberculosis and Malaria, and through country-led \r\ninitiatives to create conditions for full access to \r\ninsecticide-treated mosquito nets, insecticides for \r\nindoor residual spraying for malaria control and \r\neffective antimalarial combination treatments, \r\nincluding through the free distribution of antimalarial \r\nmosquito nets, where appropriate. \r\n In the 2005 World Summit Outcome heads of \r\nState and Government categorically stated that Africa \r\nwas the only continent not on track to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals by 2015. This was \r\nonce again reiterated in the development follow-up \r\nresolution (resolution 60/265), which emphasized that \r\nvigorous implementation of all development \r\ncommitments was needed without delay, and in \r\nparticular the promises that have been made in support \r\nof Africa. \r\n If we are to succeed in eradicating poverty and \r\nhunger in Africa, urgent and concerted action by \r\ndeveloped countries and the international community is \r\nneeded. In this regard, the Group of 77 and China \r\nreiterates that the main challenge remaining for the \r\ndevelopment of Africa is the full implementation of a \r\ntruly global partnership for development. It has \r\nbecome clear that, despite all the actions and \r\ncommitments by African countries, the main constraint \r\nto African development remains the lack of adequate \r\nresources. \r\n Much has been achieved in Africa since the \r\nadoption of the Millennium Declaration in 2000. \r\nNEPAD, a programme of the African Union, is now \r\nfive years old. The key NEPAD principles are African \r\nownership in the promotion of socio-economic \r\ndevelopment, the advancement of democracy, human \r\nrights and good governance. Through NEPAD, African \r\nleaders have taken ownership and leadership of the \r\ncontinent’s socio-economic renewal agenda and \r\ntransformed the content of the development agenda. \r\n The NEPAD policies and priorities have become \r\nan acceptable internationally approved framework for \r\nAfrica’s development. Through NEPAD, African \r\nA/61/PV.28  \r\n \r\n06-56843 4 \r\n \r\nleaders have therefore fundamentally changed the \r\ndevelopment paradigm. The narrow approach of the \r\nPoverty Reduction Strategy Papers has been expanded \r\nto include a comprehensive and holistic approach to \r\ndevelopment through African ownership. In fact, most \r\nAfrican countries now have their own national \r\ndevelopment strategies. \r\n Despite efforts in implementing NEPAD, Africa \r\nis still far from realizing the levels of support required \r\nunder this partnership. While we welcome the support \r\nprovided by international partners and the United \r\nNations in particular, much needs to be done. \r\n The Group of 77 and China is of the view that \r\nresources must be mobilized for African States, the \r\nRegional Economic Communities and the African \r\nUnion (AU), in order to support efforts aimed at \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals within \r\nthe framework of national development programmes \r\nand the implementation of the NEPAD programme. We \r\nhave taken note of the innovative approaches that have \r\nbeen developed in collaboration with the Economic \r\nCommission for Africa, the International Monetary \r\nFund, the World Bank, the United Nations Conference \r\non Trade and Development, the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme and the Office of the Special \r\nAdviser on Africa regarding funding and project \r\nimplementation of priority areas for NEPAD. \r\n We are pleased that United Nations agencies have \r\nbeen organized into various clusters in line with \r\nNEPAD priority areas as a way to increase \r\ncoordination and cooperation in their work relating to \r\nNEPAD. In addition, a number of these agencies are \r\nplaying a critical role in supporting the work of \r\nNEPAD, especially in areas such as agriculture, trade \r\nand market access, infrastructural development and \r\nscience and technology, among others. However, we \r\nstill urge the United Nations to mainstream NEPAD \r\ninto all its normative and operational activities. \r\n On the causes of conflict and the promotion of \r\ndurable peace and sustainable development in Africa, \r\nthe AU has made substantial progress in conflict \r\nprevention on the continent. One of the key changes is \r\nthe way in which Africans, through the AU, are leading \r\nthe resolution of conflicts and managing peace building \r\nby providing strong leadership from within. This \r\nAfrican ownership in resolving African conflicts has \r\nproduced remarkable results. \r\n The AU has created mechanisms that are \r\ninstrumental in the resolution of conflicts and the \r\npromotion of durable peace on the continent. They \r\ninclude the Peace and Security Council whose \r\ndecisions are binding on all AU members, Economic, \r\nSocial and Cultural Council, and a Pan-African \r\nParliament, with representatives from all AU member \r\nStates. The African Peer Review Mechanism has \r\nstarted reviewing best practices in several African \r\ncountries as a way to strengthen and consolidate \r\ndemocracy and sustainable development on the \r\ncontinent. \r\n The Group of 77 and China reiterates that the \r\nmain challenges remaining for the development of \r\nAfrica concern the full implementation of a truly \r\nglobal, equitable partnership for development through \r\nthe international community honouring its \r\ncommitments. We call on developed countries and the \r\ninternational community at large to honour their \r\ncommitments to support African development by \r\nlaunching, in 2007, concrete programmes of action \r\naimed at fully implementing all the commitments made \r\nin the Millennium Declaration, the World Summit \r\nOutcome and the development follow-up resolution \r\n(resolution 60/265). \r\n Mr. Huimasalo (Finland): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the European Union (EU). The \r\nacceding countries Bulgaria and Romania, the \r\ncandidate countries Turkey, Croatia and the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the countries of the \r\nStabilization and Association Process and potential \r\ncandidates Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and \r\nSerbia, as well as Ukraine and Moldova, align \r\nthemselves with this statement. \r\n First of all, the EU wishes to congratulate its \r\nAfrican partners on the fifth anniversary of the \r\nadoption of the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD). As in previous years, the EU \r\nwelcomes today’s debate on Africa in the General \r\nAssembly. Likewise, the EU welcomes the opportunity \r\nto address three key items: NEPAD, peace and security \r\naspects, and the fight against malaria on the African \r\ncontinent. \r\n Africa is at the heart of the European Union’s \r\ndevelopment policy. Our partnership with Africa is \r\nstrong and lasting. The EU continues to support the \r\nNEPAD initiative, which forms an important part of the \r\n A/61/PV.28\r\n \r\n5 06-56843 \r\n \r\npartnership between the international community and \r\nAfrican nations. \r\n One of the most significant results of NEPAD \r\nactivities is the African Peer Review Mechanism \r\n(APRM). The EU is pleased to note that 25 countries \r\nhave so far acceded to the Review Mechanism. South \r\nAfrica completed its self-assessment, and the African \r\nPeer Review panel undertook a review mission there in \r\nJuly 2006. So far three countries — Ghana, Rwanda \r\nand Kenya — have completed the peer review process, \r\nand their country review reports have been considered \r\nby the African Peer Review forum. The Review \r\nMechanism has encouraged countries to adopt policy \r\nmeasures to strengthen accountability and \r\ntransparency. It will be essential to monitor how the \r\nrecommendations of the reviews are translated into \r\npolicy measures on the ground. \r\n The sixth African Governance Forum on the \r\ntheme “Implementing the APRM: Challenges and \r\nOpportunities”, held in Kigali in May 2006, has given \r\nneeded publicity to the Review Mechanism. It also \r\ndelivered important messages about the need for \r\nflexibility within the APRM process to facilitate and \r\nspeed up implementation, and the need for countries to \r\nmainstream APRM commitments into their national \r\nplans. The completion of the peer review by some \r\npioneer countries provides a good example for others \r\nto follow and shows a strong commitment by the \r\nAfrican Governments to move forward with this \r\nelement within NEPAD. \r\n The progress report by the Secretary-General \r\n(A/61/212) indicates that African Governments and \r\nregional organizations have achieved significant results \r\nwithin the framework of NEPAD. The EU concurs with \r\nthis positive assessment. At the same time, analysis has \r\nshown that the contribution of civil society, and \r\nparticularly that of the private sector, to the \r\nimplementation of the priority projects of NEPAD has \r\nnot been fully satisfactory. The EU believes that \r\npromoting African ownership and engagement within \r\nthe productive sectors of society should be regarded as \r\na key challenge for the implementation of NEPAD. To \r\nthis end, a wider and deeper awareness should be \r\nraised among the business community, both inside the \r\ncontinent and beyond, regarding existing opportunities \r\nand economic dividends of NEPAD. \r\n The EU will continue strengthening its \r\nrelationships with Africa within the framework of the \r\ncomprehensive EU Strategy on Africa, which was \r\nadopted by the European Council in 2005. In the \r\ncourse of next year this unilateral agreement will be \r\ntransformed into a joint African strategy in close \r\ncooperation with African partners. \r\n The primary aim of the Strategy is the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals, \r\nwith a key focus on sustainable development, security \r\nand good governance in Africa. Efforts will be made to \r\nenhance coordination and cooperation with the African \r\nUnion (AU), subregional African organizations and \r\nother international partners, while respecting the \r\nprinciples of African ownership. \r\n The EU is committed to support Africa’s efforts \r\nto consolidate peace, democracy and human rights on \r\nthe African continent. Successful development in \r\nAfrica also requires adherence to human rights, \r\ndemocratic principles and the rule of effective, well-\r\ngoverned States, and strong and efficient institutions. \r\nThe EU Strategy identifies good and effective \r\ngovernance as a prerequisite for development. Good \r\ngovernance not only encompasses the fight against \r\ncorruption, but also includes political, economic, social \r\nand environmental governance. As a positive example \r\nof economic governance, the World Bank report \r\nentitled “Doing Business 2007” refers to Tanzania and \r\nGhana as recent reformers that have succeeded in \r\ncreating business-friendly environments. \r\n Good governance should be agreed, not imposed. \r\nAfrica has demonstrated signs of positive change in the \r\narea of governance in the framework of the above-\r\nmentioned African Peer Review Mechanism. The EU \r\nsupports, both politically and financially, this process \r\nin the context of its Governance Initiative. In addition \r\nto good governance, sound development requires \r\nadherence to human rights, democratic principles and \r\nthe rule of law, as well as a commitment to strong and \r\neffective institutions. \r\n The EU has recently launched the Infrastructure \r\nInitiative. It has led to the establishment of an \r\nInfrastructure Trust Fund, the key objective of which is \r\nto respond to the regional and continental \r\ninfrastructure deficit. Through the Trust Fund, the EU \r\nwill support Africa’s efforts to identify and address \r\nmissing links in existing networks, harmonize transport \r\npolicies, develop integrated water management, \r\ndevelop cross-border and regional energy infrastructure \r\nand promote efforts to bridge the digital divide. \r\nA/61/PV.28  \r\n \r\n06-56843 6 \r\n \r\n Without peace there can be no lasting \r\ndevelopment. Without African leadership to end \r\nAfrica’s conflicts there can be no lasting peace. The \r\nEU works with the AU, subregional organizations and \r\nAfrican countries to predict, prevent and mediate \r\nconflicts, including by addressing the root causes. Key \r\nin this regard is assistance in developing the AU’s \r\nAfrican peace and security architecture, including the \r\nAfrican Standby Force. \r\n In sub-Saharan Africa, many peace agreements \r\nhave been secured after close cooperation among the \r\nUnited Nations, the AU and the EU. In the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, the EU remains fully involved \r\nby continuing its active support of the electoral \r\nprocess. The EU looks forward to the orderly and \r\npeaceful conclusion of the process, which will be \r\npaving the way for legitimate and democratically \r\nelected institutions in expression of the full sovereignty \r\nof the Congolese people. On the basis of a successful \r\nconclusion of the elections, the EU remains committed \r\nto cooperating with the newly elected Government in \r\npromoting both short-term reconstruction and \r\nrehabilitation needs, as well as long-term efforts for \r\nsustainable development, taking into account the \r\nprinciples of good governance. \r\n The European Union expresses its deep concern \r\nabout the constant deterioration of the security and \r\nhumanitarian situation in Darfur and condemns the \r\ncontinuing violations of the ceasefire, in particular, the \r\nviolence directed at the civilian population and \r\nproviders of humanitarian assistance. The EU supports \r\nthe efforts of the United Nations and other partners in \r\nthe planning for a transition from the deployment of \r\nthe African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) in Darfur \r\nto the deployment of a United Nations peacekeeping \r\nmission. The EU strongly urges the Sudanese \r\nGovernment to give its consent to such an operation. \r\nThe EU underlines its deep concern at the potential \r\nnegative impact of a continuing conflict in Darfur on \r\nthe rest of the Sudan and in the wider region. \r\n The EU welcomes the increased role of the \r\nUnited Nations in preventive diplomacy and reiterates \r\nits support for the World Summit Outcome conclusion \r\nthat each individual State has the responsibility to \r\nprotect its population from genocide, war crimes, \r\nethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. The \r\ncentral responsibility rests within countries themselves \r\nand no external efforts as regards prevention will be of \r\nuse unless the State and its population agree on their \r\nimportance and have a will to address the issues in \r\nquestion. \r\n The European Union is fully engaged in post-\r\nconflict construction in Africa and supports, in \r\nparticular, the newly established United Nations \r\nPeacebuilding Commission. The Commission, along \r\nwith the Peacebuilding Support Office and the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund, is a key achievement of the \r\nUnited Nations reform process launched by the World \r\nSummit. The Peacebuilding Commission provides a \r\nmuch-needed forum for the coordination of efforts by \r\nall actors in peacebuilding to ensure coherence in the \r\nsecurity, development, human and political aspects of \r\npeacebuilding. The EU has for many years provided \r\nconsiderable input for peacebuilding activities in \r\nAfrica and elsewhere in the world and is ready to \r\ncontinue its commitments by actively supporting the \r\nwork of the Peacebuilding Commission in two African \r\ncountries, Burundi and Sierra Leone. \r\n The EU understands the importance of integrating \r\na gender perspective into conflict prevention. Urgent \r\npreventive measures should be developed, especially in \r\nrelation to gender-based violence in conflicts. \r\nMechanisms for prevention against and protection from \r\ngender-based violence need to be well planned in \r\nadvance and included in interagency contingency plans \r\nand strategies. \r\n The EU also supports the strengthening of fragile \r\nStates, as well as programmes for disarmament, \r\ndemobilization and reintegration and for security sector \r\nreform in African States. \r\n Recognizing the fact that natural resources can be \r\ninstrumental to the continuation of conflicts, the EU \r\nwelcomed the outcome in June this year of the United \r\nNations Expert Group Meeting on Natural Resources \r\nand Conflict in Africa.  \r\n Migration issues are an integral part of \r\ndevelopment. Over the last few years, the EU has been \r\nmoving towards a holistic approach to migration, \r\ntaking into full consideration the relationship of \r\nmigration with development. Europeans and Africans \r\nadopted a political declaration and an action plan at the \r\nEuro-African regional Ministerial Conference on \r\nMigration and Development, held last July in Rabat. \r\nPreparations are under way for another conference on \r\nthe subject, scheduled for Tripoli in November. \r\n A/61/PV.28\r\n \r\n7 06-56843 \r\n \r\n Health is at the core of development. It is a key \r\nelement in reducing poverty and in promoting human \r\nsecurity. The Abuja commitment of African leaders \r\naiming at increased health sector financing is a clear \r\nrecognition of that fact. After many years of impressive \r\ngains in human health worldwide, we are now in a \r\nsituation where countries are unable to cope with the \r\nburden of disease imposed on their health systems. \r\nThat is due to inherent weaknesses in national health \r\nsystems, unpredictable and uneven funding and the dire \r\nlack of skilled human resources. Moreover, without \r\nskilled and motivated health personnel, any health \r\nsector intervention is bound to fail. The EU is presently \r\npreparing an action plan to address the crisis in human \r\nresources for health. \r\n The global efforts to roll back malaria highlight \r\nmany of the key weaknesses and possibilities for the \r\nhealth sector. Even though malaria is a global problem, \r\nit particularly concerns Africa, with a disproportional \r\neffect on poor people and taking a specific toll on \r\nwomen and children. \r\n The EU welcomes the World Health Organization \r\n(WHO) report on the Decade to Roll Back Malaria in \r\nDeveloping Countries, Particularly in Africa (A/61/218 \r\nand Corr.1). The facts given in the report are a cause of \r\nconcern. We would especially like to draw attention to \r\nthe need to support the WHO in its role to ensure \r\nadherence to evidence-based malaria policies and \r\nstrategies and the necessity to harmonize activities at \r\nthe country level. Malaria-specific interventions need \r\nto be accompanied by simultaneous strengthening of \r\nhealth systems as well as by supporting actors outside \r\nthe public health care system. We must therefore \r\nreaffirm our commitment to work with African \r\ncountries to scale up malaria control interventions and \r\nreduce the burden of this disease. \r\n The EU will also support endeavours to ensure \r\naccess to antimalaria drugs. Along with attempts to \r\nstimulate research and development, to lower prices of \r\nnew drugs and to enhance procurement and \r\ndistribution, it is also crucial to closely monitor the \r\nimpact of new treatments and problems of drug \r\nresistance and to strengthen community knowledge, \r\nincluding by encouraging proper use of insecticide-\r\ntreated bed nets and other preventive and awareness-\r\nenhancing measures. \r\n HIV/AIDS also continues to pose immense \r\nchallenges to health systems everywhere and especially \r\nin Africa. The EU will support the “treat, train and \r\nretain” initiative, which attempts to bring together \r\nHIV/AIDS and health systems challenges, for which \r\nthere is clearly an urgent need. \r\n Let me conclude by saying that, above all, Africa \r\nneeds peace and stability. The European Union’s \r\ncommitment to Africa results from our belief that the \r\npromotion of peace and sustainable development in \r\nAfrica constitutes one of the key challenges to the \r\ninternational community today. Our relationship with \r\nAfrica is conducted in a spirit of equal partnership and \r\nis based on a firm, shared commitment to democracy, \r\nthe promotion of human rights, good governance and \r\nrespect for the rule of law, as well as to mutual respect \r\nand accountability. In all its endeavours, the EU \r\ncontinues to honour this commitment. \r\n Ms. Rouse (Grenada): At the outset, permit me to \r\ncongratulate you, Madam President, on the sentiments \r\nconveyed in your statement, which serves as a useful \r\nguide to our deliberations this morning. I am honoured \r\nto join in today’s debate on agenda item 62 (a), entitled \r\n“New Partnership for Africa’s Development: progress \r\nin implementation and international support”, on behalf \r\nof the member States of the Caribbean Community \r\n(CARICOM). CARICOM fully aligns itself with the \r\nstatement delivered by the representative of South \r\nAfrica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. \r\n The Caribbean Community shares a special \r\nkinship with Africa and its developmental process. We \r\nshare a sense of common historical experience, a \r\ncommon descent and identity. I make particular \r\nreference to efforts to build on this kinship with the \r\nhosting in Kingston of the 2005 Caribbean Diaspora \r\nConference, in collaboration with the African Union \r\nand the Government of South Africa. The Conference \r\nwas specifically designed to create linkages between \r\nAfrica and the diaspora and to initiate a dialogue on \r\ncommon challenges. It was also aimed at strengthening \r\npartnerships and cooperation between the peoples of \r\nthe two regions and establishing mechanisms for \r\nbuilding stronger political and economic relations \r\nbetween Africa and the Caribbean for our mutual \r\nbenefit. \r\n CARICOM is pleased, therefore, to note the \r\ncontents of the Secretary-General’s fourth consolidated \r\nreport (A/61/212), five years after the adoption of the \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). \r\nWe also take note of the second report of the Secretary-\r\nA/61/PV.28  \r\n \r\n06-56843 8 \r\n \r\nGeneral’s Advisory Panel on International Support for \r\nthe New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(A/61/138) and commend the Chairman and members \r\nof the Panel for their contribution. We welcome the \r\nprogress made by African leaders to implement \r\nNEPAD and the support committed by the international \r\ncommunity. We see a great future ahead for Africa, \r\nsocially, economically and politically. \r\n CARICOM welcomes progress made in key \r\npriority areas of NEPAD. The year 2006 has seen a \r\npositive start to delivery on commitments by the \r\ninternational community. Much has been achieved with \r\ninfrastructural development, and we commend the \r\nefforts of cooperation between the NEPAD secretariat \r\nand the African Development Bank in implementing \r\nseveral important projects. With the increase in global \r\nactivity, CARICOM applauds the establishment of the \r\nNEPAD e-schools initiative, with the e-Africa \r\nCommission. Involvement of the private sector is also \r\ncommendable, and we call for continued cooperation \r\namong the various sectors in order to achieve this \r\nimportant NEPAD objective.  \r\n CARICOM also welcomes the initiatives taken by \r\nthe G8 countries and countries of the South to deliver \r\non the promises made with respect to Africa’s \r\ncontinued development. CARICOM is in total \r\nagreement with the view that partnership is the key \r\nelement in NEPAD implementation. The theme chosen \r\nfor the Assembly’s general debate this year — \r\n“Implementing a Global Partnership for \r\nDevelopment” — could not be more timely. \r\n NEPAD has become known worldwide, and apart \r\nfrom the United Nations system, several other \r\ninternational and private sector organizations have \r\nbeen able to identify with NEPAD, which augurs well \r\nfor the future of the initiative. CARICOM has taken \r\nnote of progress in the area of education, \r\nenvironmental sustainability, agricultural initiatives, \r\nscientific and technological advancement, the \r\nstrengthening of health systems, gender mainstreaming \r\nand civil society participation, among other areas. \r\nSeveral of these programmes are now ready to be \r\nimplemented, and we encourage NEPAD leaders in \r\ntheir efforts to put into place institutional arrangements \r\nto accelerate implementation. \r\n CARICOM is well aware that there are several \r\nconstraints and mitigating factors that may hinder \r\nimplementation in some areas. Recent developments \r\nwith respect to international trade, growing security \r\nconcerns and new political and economic realities \r\ncontinue to face us in all regions of the world. For \r\nAfrica, this has proven to be particularly challenging. \r\nThe international community has a significant role to \r\nplay and a promise to keep in support of the African \r\nleaders’ common vision and shared commitment to \r\neradicating poverty on the continent. We therefore \r\nunderscore the need to give Africa the necessary \r\nresources, including through increased official \r\ndevelopment aid and technical assistance in support of \r\nthe implementation of NEPAD.  \r\n The United Nations system also plays a critical \r\nrole in this regard, and we therefore welcome ongoing \r\nefforts to improve coordination of United Nations work \r\nin support of NEPAD.  \r\n CARICOM stands ready and willing to assist \r\nAfrica through this process as we grapple with our own \r\nintegration process. We are confident that we can share \r\nin achievements and lessons learned, and together we \r\ncan join with our global partners to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and make this world a \r\nbetter place for all humanity. \r\n Mr. Gatan (Philippines): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the member countries of the \r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), \r\nnamely, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, the \r\nLao People’s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, \r\nMyanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and \r\nViet Nam. ASEAN aligns itself with the statement \r\nmade by the representative of South Africa on behalf of \r\nthe Group of 77 and China. \r\n It is very encouraging to note the vocabulary and \r\ntone of the Secretary-General’s progress report on the \r\ncauses of conflict and the promotion of durable peace \r\nand sustainable development in Africa (A/61/213), \r\nwhich underscores development momentum in the \r\nregion and the reduction of conflict. However, the \r\nreport also notes the potential for relapse. Furthermore, \r\nthe fact that some situations in the region have \r\nworsened points to the need for deeper understanding \r\nof the root causes of conflict. Available insight appears \r\nto be insufficient to anticipate and prevent violent \r\noutbreaks that would hinder development and \r\neffectively suspend implementation of the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). \r\n There is no denying that NEPAD can play and is \r\nplaying a vital role in transforming the political culture \r\n A/61/PV.28\r\n \r\n9 06-56843 \r\n \r\nof its member States. To achieve such transformation, \r\nhowever, requires the full participation of all \r\nstakeholders. In addition, technical and financial \r\nassistance is required to ensure that its political agenda \r\nis realized. That requires adequate and predictable \r\nfunding from both domestic and international sources. \r\nIn particular, NEPAD’s Peer Review Mechanism is an \r\ninnovative and effective instrument for the promotion \r\nof democracy. The Secretary-General’s report assures \r\nus that the African Peer Review Mechanism is enjoying \r\nsome measure of success.  \r\n A strong NEPAD will contribute to conflict \r\nresolution, because it recognizes the dangers of war. \r\nConflict is a hindrance to sustainable development \r\nbecause it disrupts and destabilizes the economic \r\nenvironment. Development depends upon and thrives \r\nin conditions of peace. The inability to forecast the \r\nlikely outcome of investments will make such activity \r\na difficult exercise because sudden destruction \r\nthreatens everything, including human lives.  \r\n But there are known strategies for reducing and \r\neliminating the possibility of war. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report is correct in asserting that decent \r\nemployment and access to productive resources can \r\nprevent the recurrence of conflict. On that basis, better \r\npolicies must be implemented to stimulate strong \r\neconomic growth and give people, especially young \r\npeople, the assurance of a brighter tomorrow. \r\n While the primary responsibility for these \r\nchanges rests with Africa’s leadership, international \r\nsupport is vital for success in these endeavours — \r\npledges and commitments should be fulfilled. There \r\nmust be greater flow of financing for development and \r\nthe strength of Africa’s export capacity must be built \r\nup through genuinely free and fair international trade. \r\nAid for trade has a key role to play in this regard. \r\n South-South cooperation complements North-\r\nSouth relations and forms an integral part of \r\ninternational support. In particular, two sources attract \r\nattention: the Non-Aligned Movement Centre for \r\nSouth-South Technical Cooperation (NAM CSSTC) in \r\nJakarta and the New Asian-African Strategic \r\nPartnership. \r\n Over the period 2001 to 2006, the Centre, which \r\nwas established by Indonesia and Brunei Darussalam in \r\n1995, implemented 28 programmes that benefited close \r\nto 800 individuals from 84 developing countries, \r\nincluding countries from Africa, and 23 international \r\ninstitutions. The programmes involved exchange and \r\ndissemination of development experience as well as \r\ntechnical assistance and training and were designed to \r\nmake developing economies more broad-based, \r\nefficient and resilient. \r\n In the meantime, the New Asian-African Strategic \r\nPartnership, inaugurated in 2005 and co-chaired by \r\nSouth Africa and Indonesia, follows a road map \r\ncovering three areas of cooperation — political, \r\neconomic and socio-cultural. In this regard, concrete \r\nactivities are being pursued in the areas of capacity-\r\nbuilding, environmental law and policy, preservation of \r\ngenetic resources and traditional knowledge and the \r\ndevelopment of small and medium enterprises among \r\nothers.  \r\n Furthermore, members of the Association of \r\nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have also sought to \r\nstrengthen trade as well as people-to-people links. \r\nThey have done so particularly within the context of \r\ntheir cooperation programmes. \r\n In conclusion, preserving the peace and \r\nprosperity of their nations is an ideal worth pursuing \r\nby Africa’s leadership for the good of the continent and \r\nits peoples. The common good must always be treated \r\nas paramount. \r\n Ms. Rebello (India): We thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his fourth consolidated report on the \r\nprogress in implementation and international support \r\nof the New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(NEPAD), and other reports prepared for this joint \r\ndebate. We associate ourselves with the statement made \r\nby the representative of South Africa on behalf of the \r\nGroup of 77. \r\n India has consistently identified with the \r\naspirations of the peoples of Africa and has maintained \r\nlong-standing political relations with the countries of \r\nthat continent. It was in South Africa that Mahatma \r\nGandhi forged the political weapon of “Satyagraha”, \r\nwhich means non-violent struggle or passive \r\nresistance. His exposure to injustice in Africa \r\ntransformed an urbane lawyer into an icon for the \r\npeaceful and non-violent struggle that evolved into \r\nIndia’s struggle for independence. South African \r\nPresident Thabo Mbeki described Mahatma Gandhi as \r\n“the beloved son of South Africa” at the centenary \r\ncelebrations of the launching of the Satyagraha \r\nmovement in South Africa.  \r\nA/61/PV.28  \r\n \r\n06-56843 10 \r\n \r\n India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, \r\nspeaking at the Afro-Asian Conference at Bandung in \r\n1955, described Asia and Africa as sister continents. \r\nLike the countries of Africa, India suffered the burdens \r\nof colonial domination, economic exploitation and \r\nracial discrimination. Even though our own deprivation \r\nwas considerable, we realized that Africa’s tribulations \r\nwere even greater. India has, therefore, always been a \r\nstrong and consistent voice in support of Africa at the \r\nUnited Nations and elsewhere. \r\n It is our firm conviction that success in achieving \r\nthe objectives of NEPAD depends on an African-led \r\nand African-developed agenda. With the rich human \r\nand natural resources available to Africa, and the \r\ncommitment of Africa’s leaders to achieving the \r\nobjectives of NEPAD, success can be achieved if \r\nNEPAD receives the dedicated support of the \r\ninternational community in realizing the African \r\ndream. \r\n The report of the Secretary-General (A/61/212) \r\nprovides details of the progress made in the various \r\npriority areas of NEPAD and analyses the response of \r\nthe international community in support of NEPAD. The \r\nreport states that while the past year has witnessed a \r\npromising start to delivery on commitments, progress \r\nhas been more marked on debt relief than on official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) and trade.  \r\n It is heartening that the trend of significant \r\nincreases in ODA to Africa continued in 2004 and \r\n2005. However, much of the increase in 2005 was on \r\naccount of huge debt write-offs. The report states that a \r\nmassive collective increase in ODA is required in 2006 \r\nand thereafter in order to meet the 2010 commitments, \r\nbut that the level of increase is not nearly fast enough \r\nto deliver on the pledges made at the Gleneagles Group \r\nof Eight (G8) Summit in 2005. The report adds that the \r\nobserved increase continues to take the form of \r\nemergency aid, debt relief and technical assistance. \r\n The Secretary-General’s report acknowledges that \r\nthe substantial progress over the last twelve months in \r\ndebt relief makes this an area in which the G8 \r\ncountries have kept their commitments. We would \r\nemphasize here that the multilateral debt relief \r\ninitiative of donor countries should include a \r\ncommitment to provide additional resources to the \r\ninternational financial institutions to ensure that debt \r\nforgiveness does not erode their financial capacity. \r\n Reports on Africa have emphasized that aid \r\nshould be released in predictable tranches over a long-\r\nterm period and should be focused on enabling African \r\neconomies to produce a broad range of goods and to \r\ncreate more jobs. For the success of the international \r\ncommunity’s current focus on the special needs of \r\nAfrica and in order to avoid the damage done to \r\nAfrican countries through the austerity measures \r\nbrought in by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) \r\nthrough the imposition of structural adjustment \r\nprogrammes in the past, African countries should be \r\nallowed to implement their national development \r\npolicies with national ownership and policy space, \r\ninstead of with an imposition of intrusive policy \r\nconditionalities. \r\n While ODA and debt relief can ease financial \r\nburdens, especially in highly indebted countries in \r\nAfrica, sustained economic growth requires long-term \r\nmeasures, especially in the area of trade. The report of \r\nthe Secretary-General recommends that initiatives such \r\nas aid for trade must complement and not replace \r\nefforts to improve market access for African exports \r\nand strengthen Africa’s participation in world trade. \r\n In this context, the suspension of the Doha Trade \r\nRound is a cause for concern. Early resumption of the \r\ntrade talks, along with adherence to the existing \r\nmandate — that is, the mandate of the Doha \r\nDeclaration, the July Framework and the Hong Kong \r\nMinisterial Declaration — is an absolute imperative. \r\nThe report of the Secretary-General recalls that, at the \r\nHong Kong Ministerial trade talks, agreement was \r\nreached to eliminate export subsidies by developed \r\ncountries on cotton in 2006 and to end all forms of \r\nagricultural export subsidies by the end of 2013, with a \r\nsubstantial portion to be lifted as early as 2010. The \r\nreport also points out that export subsidies represent \r\nonly a small share of the support given to agriculture in \r\ncountries that are members of the Organization for \r\nEconomic Cooperation and Development. Much of the \r\nsupport is in the form of trade-distorting domestic price \r\nsupport and agricultural tariffs. Failure to resume the \r\nDoha Round of trade talks has negative implications on \r\nthe food security, livelihood security and rural \r\ndevelopment of a large number of poor and marginal \r\nfarmers in developing countries, especially those \r\nengaged in subsistence farming. \r\n The report of the Secretary-General highlights \r\nIndia’s cooperation with NEPAD as part of South-\r\nSouth cooperation. It also highlights the projects being \r\n A/61/PV.28\r\n \r\n11 06-56843 \r\n \r\nundertaken by India in infrastructure, information \r\ntechnologies and other areas, through the Techno-\r\nEconomic Approach for Africa-India Movement, or \r\nTEAM-9. In addition, India is engaged in several other \r\nbilateral initiatives in a number of African countries, as \r\nwell as a pan-Africa e-connectivity mission. \r\n India has shared its expertise in sectors such as \r\ninfrastructure, pharmaceuticals, health care and \r\ninformation technologies, among others, with the aim \r\nof building capacity and technology transfer for the \r\nbenefit of African countries. The Indian Technical and \r\nEconomic Cooperation scheme, which provides \r\ntraining programmes to over 150 countries, including \r\nmost African countries, has been running since 1954, \r\nproviding scholarships to African students interested in \r\nstudying in India and sending Indian experts to Africa \r\nfor training. \r\n Mr. Al-Murad (Kuwait), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n India’s cooperation programme with Africa \r\ncurrently amounts to about $1 billion. India’s efforts, \r\nas well as those of other partner countries from the \r\ndeveloping world, form a part of South-South \r\ncooperation. Contrary to the suggestion of the \r\nAdvisory Panel on International Support for NEPAD, \r\nthese efforts should not be lumped together with those \r\nof the developed countries, either in calculations of \r\nvolume of aid moving to Africa or in monitoring such \r\naid. \r\n The Secretary-General’s most recent report on the \r\ncauses of conflict and the promotion of durable peace \r\nand sustainable development in Africa (A/61/213) \r\ndescribes recent conflict prevention, peacemaking, \r\npeacekeeping and peacebuilding activities in Africa. \r\nIndia has been one of the oldest, largest and most \r\nconsistent contributors to United Nations peacekeeping \r\norganizations, having participated in almost every \r\nmajor operation since the inception of peacekeeping in \r\nthe 1950s. Indian personnel are currently serving in \r\nUnited Nations Missions in Ethiopia, Eritrea, Burundi, \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, \r\nSierra Leone and the Sudan. Given the need to focus \r\non gender issues in Africa, India will soon despatch the \r\nfirst-ever female-formed police unit to Liberia. We \r\nexpect the all-women unit to be in Liberia by the end \r\nof the year. \r\n India has consistently pointed to the need for an \r\nintegral link between peacekeeping and peacebuilding, \r\nwhich is a prerequisite for investment in the future to \r\nprotect the hard-won gains of the efforts to establish \r\npeace. India, therefore, energetically participated in the \r\ndeliberations last year on the establishment of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and welcomed its creation \r\nby announcing a contribution of $2 million. We have \r\nemphasized national ownership of the peacebuilding \r\nprocess, and we have been closely associated with the \r\nholding of the first two country-specific meetings of \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission. We will remain \r\nengaged in efforts to define the role and method of \r\nwork of this new body. \r\n Turning to the agenda item on the rolling back of \r\nmalaria in developing countries, particularly in Africa, \r\nwe believe that there is need for wider recognition that \r\nmalaria is largely a killer of children and poor people. \r\nIt continues to threaten at least three billion people in \r\n107 countries and territories. Each year, more than 500 \r\nmillion people suffer from acute malaria, resulting in \r\nmore than one million deaths. About 3,000 children \r\nand infants die from malaria every day. The disease \r\nalso has a significant impact on long-term economic \r\ngrowth and development, leading to loss of gross \r\ndomestic product and the consumption of enormous \r\nportions of household incomes and Government health \r\nspending. India is familiar with tackling the mosquito \r\nmenace and fully supports efforts that focus on the \r\nprevention and elimination of malaria in developing \r\ncountries, including in Africa. \r\n Mr. Berrah (Algeria) (spoke in French): First of \r\nall, I would like to thank Secretary-General Kofi \r\nAnnan for the high quality of the reports that he has \r\npresented on follow-up progress in implementing the \r\nrecommendations on the causes of conflict and the \r\npromotion of durable peace and development in Africa \r\nand on the implementation and international support of \r\nthe New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(NEPAD). \r\n The annual review of progress made in achieving \r\nthe objectives of peace, security and development in \r\nAfrica is, without doubt, a very timely opportunity to \r\nassess the state of implementation of promises and \r\ncommitments made internationally in order to assist \r\nAfrican countries in their ongoing resolve to reclaim \r\ntheir destiny for a renewal of peace, social progress \r\nand economic recovery. \r\n We associate ourselves with the statement made \r\nby the representative of South Africa on behalf of the \r\nA/61/PV.28  \r\n \r\n06-56843 12 \r\n \r\nGroup of 77 and China. We would simply like to make \r\na number of additional comments. \r\n To deal with the root causes of conflict in Africa \r\nand, at the same time, make the efforts to prevent \r\nconflicts more effective and to re-establish, maintain \r\nand build peace after conflicts, a combination of short- \r\nand long-term actions, based on objective linkages \r\nbetween security, development and cooperation, must \r\nbe the thrust of our work and our thinking in \r\nformulating any type of initiative, be it fundamentally \r\nAfrican or not. \r\n And so, here, the African response to the \r\nchallenges of peace and security has resulted in a new \r\napproach based on African capabilities, political will \r\nand a strategic commitment to repatriate onto African \r\nsoil actions aimed at building and consolidating peace. \r\n We have seen this in the security agenda of the \r\nAfrican Union (AU), through the establishment in 2002 \r\nof a Peace and Security Council, which is an initial \r\ninstitutional step to support the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes. Its action is part and parcel of a structural \r\nstrengthening of peace, which integrates in an \r\nextremely serious way a proactive dimension and a \r\npreventive dimension in order to minimize the risks of \r\nconflict breaking out. \r\n Building peace, as pointed out by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his report on the implementation of support \r\nand recommendations on the causes of conflict, also \r\ninvolves the ongoing building of the rule of law and \r\nthe promotion of instruments to protect human rights \r\nand fundamental freedoms. It is precisely in this spirit \r\nthat the African Union, in 2002, instituted an African \r\nPeer Review Mechanism, which is completely \r\nvoluntary and which seeks to put the management of \r\nthe public affairs of an African country in the hands of \r\nits peers and very successfully highlights the \r\ncommitment of Africa to transparency and good \r\ngovernance. \r\n The economic and social development of nations \r\nis the most favourable context for building lasting \r\npeace and socio-political stability. On the basis of that \r\nprinciple, the AU economic programme, NEPAD, is \r\nalso a peace and security initiative.  \r\n Fully African in purpose and inspiration, NEPAD \r\nis premised on the idea of freeing the continent of \r\nconflicts and combating the political and social \r\nvulnerabilities that cause them and fighting \r\nunderdevelopment. Through its ambitious multisectoral \r\nprogrammes, it aspires to assert Africa’s political will \r\nto reassume responsibility for resolving its own \r\nproblems and to fulfil its aspiration to be marginalized \r\nno longer.  \r\n However, that ambition conflicts with a familiar — \r\nbut no less devastating — record characterized at the \r\ninternal level by extreme poverty, substantial migratory \r\nflows, the breakdown of economic and social systems \r\nand the absence of development infrastructures. At the \r\nexternal level, while the countries of Asia, Latin \r\nAmerica and Central and Eastern Europe are emerging in \r\nthe sphere of international economic relations, Africa — \r\nwhich represents a quarter of the Organization’s Member \r\nStates and 12 per cent of the world population — \r\naccounts for only 1 per cent of the world’s gross \r\ndomestic product (GDP) and 1.8 per cent of international \r\nexports. \r\n To climb out of that socio-economic morass, \r\nNEPAD has implemented an ambitious programme \r\nwhose viability depends largely on consistent resources \r\nto feed it — estimated at $64 billion per year, or 12 per \r\ncent of the continent’s GDP. It supplements insufficient \r\ninternal resources with public and private external \r\nfinancing and calls for greater access to Western \r\nmarkets for African exports.  \r\n In its implementation cycle, the programme relies \r\nin the short term on traditional, but improved, means of \r\ndevelopment: greater official development assistance \r\n(ODA) and swifter debt relief. Over the long term, it \r\nseeks to reduce dependence on aid. To that end, it \r\nfavours foreign direct investment as a source of \r\nsupplementary financing. \r\n In the wake of the NEPAD implementation \r\nprocess, African countries have had to identify more \r\nclearly the constraints and structural obstacles \r\nimpeding continental economic integration and a \r\nmultitude of development projects. Those obstacles and \r\nconstraints — several of which are highlighted in the \r\nSecretary-General’s report — include weak \r\ninstitutional capacities and uneven development of the \r\nsubregional pillars of continental integration, which do \r\nnot promote the complementarity or optimal use of \r\nAfrican capacities and experiences; insufficient \r\nfinancial resources; the scarcity of skilled labour; \r\nlimited private-sector participation in NEPAD’s \r\nimplementation, accompanied by the late arrival of \r\nsufficient amounts of foreign direct investment; ODA \r\n A/61/PV.28\r\n \r\n13 06-56843 \r\n \r\nthat remains below the set targets and is always largely \r\nconsumed by the costs of expertise; and an economic, \r\nfinancial and trade environment that does not value \r\nAfrican countries’ efforts to emerge from \r\nunderdevelopment. \r\n The quest for regional stability in Africa has led \r\nthe African Union and NEPAD to make cooperation an \r\nintegral and even decisive component of achieving \r\ncollective security and development at the continental \r\nlevel. That imperative is fully justified in the global \r\ncontext following 11 September 2001, where poverty has \r\nemerged as one of the causes of terrorism. The struggle \r\nfor development has thus become a global priority, and \r\nNEPAD has become the reference framework within \r\nwhich the international community — particularly the \r\nUnited Nations system — should focus its African \r\ndevelopment efforts. \r\n A partnership for security in Africa depends to a \r\nlarge degree on continental and international \r\nmobilization. Such general mobilization should be \r\nbased on the strengthening of regional and local \r\nmechanisms for conflict prevention, management and \r\nresolution, particularly through the training of \r\nmediators and negotiators in the cultural foundations of \r\npeace. It should also be based on a peace diplomacy \r\ncharged with creating conditions for the peaceful \r\nresolution of disputes — a diplomacy whose ultimate \r\ngoal would be that set by the Fifth Ordinary Session of \r\nthe Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the \r\nAfrican Union, held in July 2005: to achieve a conflict-\r\nfree Africa by 2010. \r\n Enhanced cooperation between the African Union \r\nand the United Nations system is another important \r\narea of work, because it would enable the Union to \r\nbenefit from the Organization’s expertise and broad \r\nexperience in the area of peacekeeping. It would also \r\nfacilitate the Union’s access to additional resources for \r\nconducting its own operations. \r\n In that connection, the establishment of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission in December 2005 is part \r\nof a complementary approach in which the \r\nCommission, in close collaboration with other major \r\nUnited Nations organs, maintains the level of attention \r\nand assistance accorded to countries emerging from \r\nconflict, particularly in Africa — Burundi and Sierra \r\nLeone, for example. \r\n In addition, to improve on an unsatisfactory \r\nassistance relationship, NEPAD calls for the \r\nestablishment of a genuine partnership with \r\nindustrialized countries and multilateral institutions on \r\nthe basis of shared responsibilities. In that regard, we \r\nwelcome the partnership established between NEPAD \r\nand the Group of Eight (G8) and the G8’s \r\ncommitments to support African efforts. Likewise, we \r\nwelcome the many initiatives carried out by a number \r\nof developed countries to support Africa. Whether \r\nmultilateral or bilateral, such initiatives are to be \r\nencouraged. \r\n We remain convinced that, if we are to succeed in \r\nthe gamble of an effective partnership that produces \r\neconomic and social benefits, the support of \r\ndevelopment partners should be expressed not only \r\nthrough coherent international cooperation policies that \r\nprovide Africa with a comprehensive response and the \r\nmeans to attain its objectives, but also through the \r\nestablishment of a more favourable environment for \r\nthe access of African products to international markets.  \r\n Accordingly, as the basis for a genuine solidarity \r\npolicy, the objective of allocating 0.7 per cent of the \r\ngross national product of industrialized countries to \r\nODA and providing total foreign debt relief to \r\nsub-Saharan Africa should become a tangible reality — \r\nand no longer be just a political and moral platitude — \r\nso that the actions of those countries will live up to \r\ntheir statements. \r\n For its part, the United Nations system must play \r\na significant role in helping to support African efforts. \r\nOperational activities are of great importance in that \r\nregard and could have greater visibility if they had a \r\nsolid footing and a clear framework.  \r\n To conclude, I cannot fail to stress the importance \r\nof the role of the Office of the Special Adviser on \r\nAfrica, whose efforts demonstrate — if that were \r\nnecessary — the commitment of the United Nations to \r\nensure regular follow-up on the international support \r\nfor NEPAD. \r\n Mr. Nsengimana (Rwanda): I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly for convening this \r\nimportant joint debate on agenda item 62 (a), “New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development: progress in \r\nimplementation of international support”, and item \r\n62 (b), “Causes of conflict and the promotion of \r\ndurable peace and sustainable development in Africa”. \r\nI also wish to thank the Secretary-General for his \r\nreport on the item under review. Rwanda associates \r\nA/61/PV.28  \r\n \r\n06-56843 14 \r\n \r\nitself with the statement made by the representative of \r\nSouth Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. \r\n We believe that this General Assembly debate \r\nprovides a good opportunity to discuss critical issues \r\nrelated to the speedy implementation of international \r\nsupport to the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD). \r\n Rwanda is strongly committed to the ideals and \r\nvision of NEPAD, which, we believe, are very critical \r\nto the socio-economic transformation of Africa. \r\n Rwanda was among the first countries to submit \r\nto the scrutiny of our peers under NEPAD’s African \r\nPeer Review Mechanism (APRM). The Review \r\nMechanism is founded on the principle that peace, \r\nsecurity and good governance are the firm foundations \r\nfor sustainable development. It entails a collective \r\npolitical commitment to implementing best governance \r\npractices and to accepting review by our peers on the \r\nbasis of these standards. \r\n In Rwanda, the Review Mechanism gave us the \r\nopportunity to measure our national governance \r\ninitiatives against the benchmark of international \r\nstandards and to provide a forum for broadening \r\nnational dialogue on these initiatives. \r\n For post-conflict countries, the Review \r\nMechanism provides a rare opportunity to initiate \r\nreforms. The Secretary-General’s report on the causes \r\nof conflict also recognizes the opportunities to create \r\nnew governance structures in post-conflict situations. \r\nWe welcome this recognition. \r\n Our experience as a pioneer Peer Review \r\nMechanism country was recently shared at the Sixth \r\nAfrican Governance Forum in Kigali, Rwanda. We are \r\ncommitted to continue to share our experience in the \r\nspirit of mutual learning, particularly with countries \r\nemerging from conflict. \r\n It is also important to note that at last June’s Peer \r\nReview Meeting in Banjul, at which Rwanda was \r\nsubject to review, a resulting programme of action was \r\nendorsed by participating heads of State. Rwanda’s \r\nimplementation of this programme of action is already \r\nunder way. However, we would like to encourage our \r\nfriends and partners to join us in its comprehensive and \r\naccelerated implementation. \r\n The imperative for the integration of African \r\neconomies has been well articulated under NEPAD and \r\nfacilitated by its infrastructure programmes. \r\nUnfortunately, these well-meaning initiatives remain \r\non the drawing board five years after NEPAD’s \r\ninauguration. The delays in the implementation of \r\nthese initiatives seem to emanate from the failure on \r\nour part to mobilize sufficient domestic resources for \r\ntheir financing. On the other hand, our delays have \r\nbeen compounded by our partners’ ongoing political \r\ncommitments, which have caused the postponement of \r\nconcrete disbursements. \r\n It is my hope that this debate shall be the catalyst \r\nthat will stimulate the needed progress in this regard. \r\n Mr. Chulkov (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): In order to save time, I will abridge my \r\nstatement, but the full text of our delegation’s \r\nstatement has been submitted to you for distribution. \r\n The Russian Federation welcomes the progress \r\nachieved during the recent years in settling conflicts in \r\nAfrica, above all, in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Burundi and \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo. Still, much \r\nremains to be done until definitive stabilization of the \r\nsituation in the continent is reached. We attach great \r\nimportance to the elaboration of agreed comprehensive \r\nsteps to the settlement of conflict situations in the \r\nregion, which must be based on giving priority to \r\npolitical and diplomatic approaches and the \r\nunconditional compliance with norms and principles of \r\npeacekeeping, as provided for in the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations.  \r\n During its presidency of the Group of Eight (G8), \r\nthe Russian Federation has promoted the inclusion of \r\nAfrican issues on the G8 agenda as one of its priorities. \r\nDuring the St. Petersburg summit, the G8 leaders \r\ndiscussed in detail the issues of peace and development \r\nin Africa and established guidelines for future \r\nassistance to the continent.  \r\n In accordance with its status as a permanent \r\nmember of the Security Council, the Russian \r\nFederation has made a substantial contribution to \r\npeacekeeping activities in Africa, including the \r\ndevelopment within the framework of the Council, of \r\nstrategies to settle specific armed conflicts and the \r\nadoption of mandates for relevant peacekeeping \r\noperations in order to support such operations in \r\nAfrica. \r\n We continue to provide assistance in training \r\nAfrican peacekeepers. We envisage a potential increase \r\n A/61/PV.28\r\n \r\n15 06-56843 \r\n \r\nof our cooperation with African countries in this area. \r\nWe intend to further contribute to the development of \r\nAfrican countries’ own anti-crisis capacity.  \r\n We support new rational methods in the practice \r\nof United Nations peacekeeping activities, while \r\nmaintaining compliance with all existing rules and \r\nprocedures. The joint activities of United Nations \r\nforces must be carried out on the basis of Security \r\nCouncil authorization on the principles of full respect \r\nfor the sovereignty of individual countries and the \r\nconsent of the troop-contributing countries, and should \r\nnot exceed the mandates of specific missions. \r\n In the context of efforts to stabilize the post-\r\nconflict situations in Africa, we see substantial \r\npotential in the Peacebuilding Commission. We are \r\nlooking forward to a substantial contribution by the \r\nCommission to the resolution of issues associated with \r\ndefinitive normalization and measures to ensure \r\nsustainable development in Sierra Leone and in \r\nBurundi, and in the long-term, in other African \r\ncountries emerging from crises. \r\n We have taken note of the ideas contained in the \r\nreport of the Secretary-General on the causes of \r\nconflict and on the need to elaborate so-called \r\nmillennium peace and security goals in Africa. We \r\nbelieve that this idea should not run counter to the \r\nalready existing initiatives in this area, and therefore \r\nrequires, in our view, further careful study. \r\n The Russian Federation would like to express its \r\ngratitude to the Secretary-General for his detailed and \r\ncomprehensive report on implementation of the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). From \r\nthe very beginning, Russia has supported this initiative. \r\nAs a responsible member of the international \r\ncommunity and a member of organizations that are \r\nfriendly towards Africa, such as the Group of Eight, we \r\nare continuing to increase our contribution to the \r\naccelerated development of that continent. \r\n A major area of Russian assistance to Africa is \r\nalleviation of the debt burden of the countries of the \r\nregion within the framework of the Heavily Indebted \r\nPoor Countries Debt Initiative (HIPC). To date, Russia \r\nhas written off or committed to write off African debt \r\nworth $11.3 billion, including $2.2 billion within the \r\nHIPC Initiative. In 2003-2004, Russia made an \r\nadditional contribution to the HIPC Trust Fund in the \r\namount of $10 million. In 2005-2006, yet another \r\nadditional contribution of $15 million was made to the \r\nTrust Fund. This year, we intend to additionally write \r\noff bilateral liabilities of African countries for the total \r\namount of over $700 million. Russia participates in the \r\nInternational Development Association (IDA) \r\nreplenishment for 2003-2011 in the amount of $30 \r\nmillion. The Russian contribution to the fourteenth \r\nIDA replenishment for 2006-2014 has been earmarked \r\nat approximately $60 million. The share of \r\nsub-Saharan African countries will total 49 per cent of \r\nthat amount. Russia is contributing to the development \r\nof energy security on the continent. We intend to \r\ncontribute $30 million to the Global Village Energy \r\nPartnership in order to expand its activities in \r\nsub-Saharan Africa. \r\n Broad trade preferences have been offered to the \r\ncountries of Africa. Most of their export commodities \r\nare imported into Russia on preferential terms. \r\nCustoms duties and fees on goods imported from the \r\npoorest countries are not assessed. We are intensively \r\ndeveloping our cooperation in a number of major \r\ninvestment projects in Africa. We understand the \r\nimportance of human resources development on the \r\nAfrican continent, and for that reason we are providing \r\nsubstantial training support to African countries. To \r\ndate, over 4,500 African students are studying in \r\nRussian higher education institutions, approximately \r\n75 per cent of whom receive scholarships from the \r\nRussian federal budget. For the 2006-2007 academic \r\nyears, African countries have been allocated \r\napproximately 750 scholarships. In April 2006, a \r\ndecision was taken on Russia’s participation in the \r\ninitiative on the expedited funding of the Education for \r\nAll programme and a contribution was made to its \r\nfunds of $7.2 million for 2006-2008. \r\n An important element of our work with Africa is \r\nassistance in public health. The final document on this \r\nagenda item of the Saint Petersburg Summit sets out a \r\ncomprehensive long-term strategy of global efforts in \r\nthis area that has already been highly appreciated by \r\nthe World Health Organization (WHO). While we \r\npositively assess the efforts on combating malaria \r\nundertaken through WHO, UNICEF and other partner \r\norganizations, in particular the Global Fund to Fight \r\nHIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, Russia calls for \r\nfurther increased and agreed international measures \r\nwithin the framework of the United Nations to reduce \r\nthe spread of this disease, with overall coordination by \r\nWHO and financial support from the Global Fund. In \r\n2005, Russia paid its contributions to the Global Polio \r\nA/61/PV.28  \r\n \r\n06-56843 16 \r\n \r\nEradication Initiative in the amount of $8 million. We \r\nhave fully implemented our commitment to contribute \r\nin 2002-2006 $20 million to the Global Fund to Fight \r\nHIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. In 2005-2008, \r\nRussia will contribute an additional $20 million to that \r\nFund. In addition, we have made the decision to \r\nreimburse during 2007-2010 the grants that were \r\nearlier provided through that Fund to support relevant \r\nprojects in Russia. Thus, the Fund will have an \r\nadditional approximately $217 million at its disposal. \r\n Russia is also providing humanitarian and special \r\neconomic assistance to African nations. This year a \r\ndecision was made on Russia’s participation in \r\nfinancing the IMF programme to provide assistance to \r\nthe poorest countries that have suffered from external \r\nshocks, by making a voluntary contribution in the \r\namount of approximately $45 million in 2006-2010. \r\n Last year was an international pledge year to \r\nassist implementation of NEPAD. The current year is \r\nthe year of implementation of those commitments. \r\nThose commitments will be reconfirmed at the regular \r\nseventh meeting of the African Partnership Forum late \r\nin October 2006 in Moscow. On the agenda are issues \r\ndirectly related to implementation of the NEPAD \r\nprogramme. We believe that with the good will of the \r\ninternational community in solidarity with the African \r\ncontinent, we can together promote substantial \r\nmodernization of Africa. \r\n Mr. Hachani (Tunisia) (spoke in French): I \r\nwould like to endorse fully the statement made by \r\nSouth Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. I \r\nwill focus on certain points that are particularly \r\nimportant for Tunisia. \r\n The increasing interest of the international \r\ncommunity and the United Nations system in particular \r\ntowards Africa is twofold. First, the African continent \r\nis a prey to poverty, conflicts and pandemics, which \r\ncan explain its overall delays in meeting the timetable \r\nagreed for the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. Also, Africa is an active and \r\nvibrant continent, which is taking responsibility and \r\ndeploying political and economic efforts at the national \r\nand regional levels to come to terms with itself and to \r\nfind a way out of the situation. \r\n In this framework, the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD), with its holistic \r\ndevelopment approach, constitutes a global and \r\nintegrated programme in the service of the \r\ndevelopment of Africa and a basis for cooperation with \r\nits partners. However, despite the firm will of African \r\ncountries and the commitment of its partners, the \r\nimplementation of this significant African programme \r\nstill requires greater mobilization by the international \r\ncommunity and better harmonization of the instruments \r\nof intervention. Certainly, progress has been made \r\nsince last year, particularly with regard to debt \r\nreduction, thanks to international support, but the \r\nsituation risks being reversed if the support provided \r\nby Africa’s partners is not consolidated and increased \r\nand value added in the long term. \r\n The fourth report of the Secretary-General on the \r\nimplementation of international support for \r\ndevelopment for NEPAD is both optimistic and \r\ncontradictory with regard to the impact and scope of \r\nprogress made. On the one hand, it shows that there is \r\na new impetus promoting African development, but it \r\nis not solid enough to be sustainable. On the other \r\nhand, it asks development partners to put flesh on the \r\nbones of their commitments, particularly with regard to \r\nofficial development assistance, free market access and \r\ntrade diversification. In this respect, I would like to \r\nwelcome the steps made in 2006 by the developed \r\ncountries to dismantle the cotton subsidies that have \r\nbeen a source of suffering for African countries. \r\n Trade assistance should be complementary to \r\nmarket access and not a substitute for it. In the 2006 \r\nreport of the United Nations Conference on Trade and \r\nDevelopment (UNCTAD) on the economic \r\ndevelopment of Africa, entitled “Doubling Aid: Making \r\nthe ‘Big Push’ Work”, UNCTAD suggested that there \r\nshould be a new Marshall Plan to help Africa that \r\nwould involve doubling aid to the region, redefining \r\nrelevant mechanisms and streamlining our methods of \r\nintervention. According to UNCTAD, that new \r\napproach would enable Africa to achieve the necessary \r\ngrowth to meet the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). \r\n The interaction between poverty, conflicts and \r\npandemics is clear. Any new recovery strategy must \r\nsimultaneously address those three obstacles to \r\ndevelopment. Economic growth, human development \r\nand political stability must be part of a systematic \r\nvision and must not be addressed in a separate and \r\ndistinct manner. NEPAD’s approach incorporates that \r\nvision. \r\n A/61/PV.28\r\n \r\n17 06-56843 \r\n \r\n My delegation shares that vision and believes the \r\nmacro-economic reform process, the political \r\nstabilization process and human development require \r\nfinancial, human and technical resources that currently \r\nare beyond the reach of certain African countries. For \r\nthat reason, there is a structural need for external help \r\nin order that we may meet the targeted objectives and \r\npriorities. That fertile environment is also a \r\nprerequisite for NEPAD. There needs to be a stable and \r\nongoing balance between the development goals of \r\nAfrica and the constraints brought on by globalization. \r\nThe goal is to enable Africa to adapt and to speed up its \r\nprocess of integration in the world economy. \r\n On the other hand, it is important to strengthen \r\nnational and regional capacities with regard to the \r\nimplementation of NEPAD and to insure coherence and \r\ncoordination between national development plans and \r\nthe NEPAD priorities. We must also insure the \r\nconditions for better participation of the private sector \r\nin the implementation of the programmes and projects \r\nof NEPAD. \r\n I would like to point out that in the 2005 Summit \r\nOutcome (resolution 60/1), the heads of State and \r\nGovernment decided unequivocally to provide coherent \r\nand regular support to NEPAD programmes. Along the \r\nsame lines, Tunisia welcomes the conclusions of the \r\nCommittee for Programme and Coordination with \r\nregard to the renewed commitment of the United \r\nNations to provide active and coordinated assistance to \r\nthe various aspects of NEPAD and the need to identify \r\ninnovative sources of funding for its priorities. \r\n Before concluding on that point, I would like to \r\nexpress the appreciation of the Tunisian delegation for \r\nthe untiring efforts made in that respect by the Special \r\nAdviser to the Secretary-General on Africa, who is in \r\ncharge of, inter alia, relations with NEPAD, and whose \r\noffice should be further strengthened. \r\n In this combined discussion, another subject of \r\nmuch interest for Africa and the international \r\ncommunity should be mentioned — namely, the \r\nmanagement of conflict and post-conflict situations \r\nand the promotion of a lasting peace in Africa. Those \r\nare questions my delegation would now like to \r\ncomment upon. \r\n With regard to political instability and conflict \r\nand post-conflict situations, my delegation feels that in \r\norder to bring concerned countries back to the path of \r\nreconstruction and development, we need international, \r\npolitical and economic support that is more robust and \r\nbetter targeted. In that framework, the creation of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission constitutes a new \r\ninstrument that will be particularly useful for Africa. \r\nAfrica has the greatest number of conflict and post-\r\nconflict situations, and it also provides 75 per cent of \r\nthe military police and civilian contingents that make \r\nup United Nations peacekeeping operations. \r\n In that respect, I wish to stress the beneficial role \r\nof the African Union, in particular the Peace and \r\nSecurity Council, which is the structure for \r\nconsolidating peace and security in material, political, \r\nlegal and institutional terms. In that framework, better \r\nstructured cooperation between the African Union and \r\nthe United Nations is required in order to promote the \r\nestablishment of an African capacity for conflict \r\nprevention, peacekeeping and peacebuilding. Without \r\nthe commitment of all partners, the ambitious \r\nobjective — a conflict-free Africa by the year 2010 — \r\nwill be difficult to bring about.  \r\n Mr. Al-Najem (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): My \r\ndelegation is pleased to participate in the discussion of \r\nthe item entitled, “New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment”, and has read with great interest the \r\nfourth report of the Secretary-General on the progress \r\nachieved in providing international support to the \r\ninitiative of the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD). Kuwait attaches great \r\nimportance to that question, as it affects the interests \r\nand concerns of the African countries with which \r\nKuwait maintains strong historic relations. \r\n Five years have elapsed since the African leaders \r\nadopted the NEPAD initiative, which is aimed at \r\nachieving equal growth on a large scale. That would \r\nenable Africa to alleviate poverty and to be better \r\nintegrated in the world economy. Kuwait hopes that the \r\nresolutions adopted by many international conferences \r\nwith a view to achieving sustainable development will \r\nhelp in establishing the basis for a partnership between \r\ndeveloped and developing countries. That partnership \r\nwould contribute to the stability and development of \r\neconomic relations between those countries through the \r\nestablishment of a fair and balanced framework for \r\ninternational trade, thus allowing each party to assume \r\nits own responsibilities in satisfying the special needs \r\nof Africa. \r\n The efforts of the African countries to overcome \r\nthe vicious cycle of eliminating the burden of \r\nA/61/PV.28  \r\n \r\n06-56843 18 \r\n \r\nindebtedness on one hand, and ensuring the financial \r\nresources for its development goals on the other hand, \r\nreflect the most significant challenges facing the \r\nAfrican continent. Some heavily indebted African \r\ncountries benefited from writing off bilateral debts, \r\nwhich some donor countries have announced. Those \r\nefforts include the decision taken by the G8 countries \r\nto cancel, multilaterally, 100 per cent of the debts owed \r\nmostly by low-income African countries and to write \r\noff debts of $40 billion, and the International Monetary \r\nFund initiative to cancel the debts of 27 African \r\ncountries in the amount of $25 billion. \r\n Such cancellations are a positive step that has \r\ndrawn the attention of the State of Kuwait, which — \r\nlong before the announcement of the NEPAD \r\ninitiative — had already begun to alleviate the debt \r\nburden for African countries. Those efforts are \r\nillustrated in the statement made by the late Amir of \r\nKuwait, His Highness Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber \r\nAl-Sabah, at the forty-third session of the United \r\nNations General Assembly, in 1988, when he called \r\nupon the international community, especially the donor \r\ncountries, to take action to alleviate the burden of debts \r\nthat encumbered the economies of developing \r\ncountries, and to cancel the debts of countries whose \r\neconomies were experiencing difficulties. \r\n The Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic \r\nDevelopment has contributed to the alleviation of \r\nforeign debts for 14 African countries in the framework \r\nof the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) \r\ninitiative, by reducing debts due to the Fund by those \r\ncountries and by rescheduling those debts over a period \r\nof 40 years, including a 16-year grace period with an \r\ninterest rate ranging from 0.5 per cent to 2.0 per cent. \r\nThose terms are considered more attractive than the \r\ninitial terms for those loans.  \r\n The Fund is also working to alleviate the debts of \r\nother African countries within the framework of the \r\nHIPC initiative. In the context of the principle of \r\npartnership among developing countries themselves, \r\nmention should be made of the role of the Organization \r\nof Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Fund for \r\nInternational Development, acting within the HIPC \r\ninitiative, to alleviate the foreign debts of 18 African \r\ncountries. \r\n The solution to the problem of indebtedness and \r\nthe cancellation of debts will not be useful or effective \r\nif it is not associated with the means to provide the \r\nfunds necessary for development assistance. Kuwait is \r\nproud to abide by all of its international obligations \r\nand to pursue its contributions for supporting economic \r\ndevelopment programmes in developing countries \r\nthrough the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic \r\nDevelopment, which has granted development loans in \r\nthe amount of $12 billion to more than 100 countries \r\naround the world; 40 per cent of those countries are in \r\nAfrica. Thus the overall average Kuwaiti official \r\ndevelopment assistance is almost double the agreed \r\nUnited Nations target of 0.7 per cent of the gross \r\nnational product for the developed countries. Last \r\nAugust, within the framework of international efforts \r\nto eradicate poverty, Kuwait announced a donation of \r\n$300 million for the efforts of the Islamic Development \r\nBank for development in Africa. \r\n The Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic \r\nDevelopment has contributed resources to many \r\ndevelopment institutions in Africa. The African \r\nDevelopment Fund was granted development \r\nassistance amounting to $205 million as of October of \r\n2006, the African Development Bank received \r\n$117 million, the Arab Bank for Economic \r\nDevelopment in Africa received $50 million, while the \r\nInternational Fund for Agricultural Development \r\n(IFAD) Special Programme for Sub-Saharan Africa \r\nwas granted financial aid in the amount of $15 million. \r\n The Kuwait Development Fund has contributed \r\nmore than $100 million to many rehabilitation \r\nprogrammes that build upon the success of the first \r\nphase of the fight against river blindness. Kuwait’s \r\ncontributions have continued in later phases up to the \r\nyear 2003.  \r\n It is noteworthy to mention the Kuwait \r\nDevelopment Fund’s contribution to the Foundation for \r\nTropical Diseases, where the Fund is a founding \r\nmember. Mention should also be made of the Fund’s \r\ncontribution to the International Development Law \r\nInstitute.  \r\n Kuwait has efficiently contributed through the \r\nOPEC Fund to many development projects in \r\ndeveloping countries, as 119 countries have received \r\nassistance from the Fund — including 46 African \r\ncountries. The soft loans granted up until August 2006 \r\namounted to $5.4 billion. \r\n This principle of partnership includes the OPEC \r\nFund’s contribution to the capital of the Common Fund \r\nfor Commodities and the grant of loans to assist \r\n A/61/PV.28\r\n \r\n19 06-56843 \r\n \r\ncountries in subscribing to the Common Fund, as well \r\nas the OPEC Fund’s contribution to the special account \r\nfor the fight against HIV/AIDS. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to emphasize certain \r\npoints. It is important for African countries to exert \r\nsignificant efforts in order to promote NEPAD at a \r\nglobal level, and not to limit their efforts to some \r\ndonor countries or certain continents. They must \r\nincrease global awareness of African problems, include \r\nNEPAD, within the institutional framework of the \r\nAfrican Union and its various operations. They must \r\nprovide more assistance to the private sector, as well as \r\nincrease awareness of efforts within civil society. \r\nPartnership is not something transitional, but is a long-\r\nterm exercise and warrants continuous assessment. \r\nHere, we welcome the pioneering goal of this global \r\nOrganization to mobilize international support for \r\nNEPAD. \r\n We would like to express our appreciation to the \r\nSecretary-General for establishing the Advisory Panel \r\non International Support for NEPAD. African countries \r\nexerted significant efforts to satisfy the previous \r\ndemands of the international community in assuming, \r\nby themselves, the major role in achieving stability in \r\nAfrica. They have done this in order to encourage \r\ndonor countries and the private sector to offer the \r\nnecessary economic and technical support to the \r\nAfrican countries. The fourth report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on progress made in the implementation of and \r\ninternational support for NEPAD (A/61/212), shows \r\nthe diversification of economic and export structures in \r\nAfrica, which is essential for the promotion of growth \r\nand the acceleration of development in Africa. \r\n Building infrastructure for trade and improving \r\nexports are all efforts that will improve the \r\nopportunities and the prospects for the entry of African \r\nexports into the international markets. The time has \r\ncome for the international community to take more \r\ndecisive steps to encourage and support African efforts \r\nthrough an increase in the technical, political and \r\nfinancial support that must accompany the significant \r\nefforts being made to prepare the peaceful environment \r\nneeded for development. \r\n Mr. Elbakly (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I wish to thank the Secretary-General for his \r\nreport on the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) (A/61/212), his report on the \r\ncauses of conflict and promotion of durable peace and \r\nsustainable development in Africa (A/61/213), as well \r\nas his report on international efforts aimed at \r\ncombating malaria (A/61/218 and Corr.1). We would \r\nlike to align ourselves with the statement delivered by \r\nthe representative of South Africa on behalf of the \r\nGroup of 77 and China. \r\n The fourth progress report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the implementation of NEPAD coincides \r\nwith the fifth anniversary of the Partnership’s adoption \r\nas a visionary initiative originating from within Africa \r\nand aimed at addressing the problems and challenges \r\nfacing our continent. While the report acknowledges \r\nthe existing new momentum for development in Africa, \r\nas well as some progress in the implementation of a \r\nnumber of projects in various fields, we agree with the \r\nSecretary-General that international support to Africa \r\nhas not yet reached the level needed to empower \r\nNEPAD with a self-propelled and irreversible \r\nmomentum. I must emphasize in this context that all \r\nparties must live up to their commitments to the special \r\nneeds of Africa, as decided by the heads of State and \r\nGovernment in the Millennium Declaration and in the \r\n2005 World Summit Outcome. \r\n In that context, we also wish to stress the vital \r\npriority that Egypt accords to the agriculture and trade \r\nsectors of NEPAD, which are coordinated by Egypt. \r\nWe welcome the reference in the report of the \r\nSecretary-General to the progress made in the \r\nimplementation of the Comprehensive Africa \r\nAgriculture Development Programme. However, we \r\nbelieve that the ongoing preparatory process and \r\nproposal making should not be prolonged and should \r\nquickly lead to the next phase of actual \r\nimplementation. Egypt accords particular importance \r\nto the further mobilization of efforts for the \r\nimplementation of that programme. \r\n Since we acknowledge the important role of trade \r\nin the development process, we wish to draw particular \r\nattention to the issue of diversification of African \r\nexports and to the protection of fragile economies from \r\nfluctuations in the world market for raw materials, \r\nupon which many African economies are dependant. \r\nFurthermore, it is important to focus further \r\ninternational efforts on improving market access for \r\nAfrican exports to the markets of developed countries. \r\n Africa is aware of the myriad challenges it is \r\nfacing on its path to development and poverty \r\nalleviation, based on the implementation of the \r\nA/61/PV.28  \r\n \r\n06-56843 20 \r\n \r\nobjectives and programmes of NEPAD. Thus, we \r\nattach particular significance to taking the appropriate \r\nmeasures aimed at addressing institutional issues \r\nrelated to the increased integration of NEPAD in the \r\nstructures of the African Union, as well as to providing \r\nincreased support and encouragement to the private \r\nsector as a partner in the implementation of the \r\ninitiative and its objectives. \r\n To that end and in keeping with its \r\nresponsibilities and commitments, Egypt announced, \r\nduring the meeting of the NEPAD Implementation \r\nCommittee at the summit level at Sharm el-Sheikh in \r\n2005, that it is placing all its training and rehabilitation \r\ninstitutes and scientific and technological research \r\nfacilities at the disposal of African countries. Egypt \r\nwishes to join its African brothers and sisters in calling \r\nfor increasing the effectiveness of the contribution of \r\nthe United Nations system to the regional and \r\ninternational development efforts in Africa. That can be \r\nachieved through interaction and coordination between \r\nUnited Nations organs, funds, programmes and \r\nspecialized agencies on the one hand, and the African \r\nUnion organs on the other, so as to ensure the \r\nmobilization of increasing international support for \r\nNEPAD. \r\n The Egyptian delegation wishes to stress once \r\nagain the special importance of the annual report of the \r\nSecretary-General on the causes of conflict in Africa, \r\nwhich has previously included a consolidated and \r\nunique view of the achievements made and the threats \r\nand challenges facing the realization of peace and \r\nsecurity on the continent. \r\n While the focus of the report this year is on the \r\nissue of improving political and economic governance \r\nas one of the important elements of conflict prevention \r\nand peacemaking, we need to avoid addressing the \r\nresponsibilities and causes of conflict in Africa \r\nexclusively through the issue of governance. We must \r\ngive parallel attention to addressing the \r\nmultidimensional aspects of peace and security and \r\ntheir close and mutual linkage to sustainable \r\ndevelopment in Africa and the resolution of its political \r\nproblems, which occupy more than 60 per cent of the \r\nagenda of the Security Council. \r\n In that context, we welcome the report’s focus on \r\npost-conflict peacebuilding and reconstruction and \r\nwish to reemphasize the need to reinforce national \r\nownership of peacebuilding activities, as well as \r\nAfrican ownership of the means to address security and \r\ndevelopment issues on the continent, with the required \r\ninternational technical and financial support that \r\nrejects conditionality and the tendency to develop \r\ntrusteeship-like relations with Africa. \r\n The report of the Secretary-General presents \r\nnumerous important ideas on the promotion of \r\ninstitutional cooperation between the United Nations, \r\nthe African Union and other subregional organizations \r\nin Africa, particularly in the field of building Africa’s \r\nown peacekeeping capacity. \r\n However, we would wish the report to return in \r\nthe future to its focus on African priorities in the areas \r\nof conflict prevention and peacebuilding as means to \r\neliminate the phenomenon of the illicit traffic in small \r\narms and light weapons and to promote youth \r\nemployment and empowerment so as to discourage \r\nyoung people from turning to violence and extremism. \r\nWe also hope that it will focus on the continuing \r\nnegative implications of the illegal exploitation of \r\nnatural resources in conflict-affected regions in Africa. \r\n I refer, in that context, to the expert-level meeting \r\nhosted by Egypt in cooperation with the Office of the \r\nSpecial Adviser of the Secretary-General on Africa \r\nfrom 17 to 19 June 2006. That meeting addressed the \r\nissue from a comprehensive perspective that transcends \r\nthe relevant section of this year’s report of the \r\nSecretary-General, which takes a different approach \r\nlimited to the sound economic management of natural \r\nresources. The report further attempts to reinterpret the \r\nconcept of the legal exploitation of natural resources \r\nwhile ignoring the repercussions of their illegal \r\nexploitation by external actors on the fuelling of \r\nconflicts, as was established in the cases of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia and Sierra \r\nLeone. \r\n Moreover, the report does not address the close \r\nlink between the illegal exploitation of natural \r\nresources and the illicit trade in small arms and light \r\nweapons. In that context, we wish to recall the previous \r\nreport of the Secretary-General submitted to the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixtieth session, in which he \r\nproposed guidelines and concrete measures to deter the \r\nillegal exploitation of natural resources and to pursue \r\nand bring to justice those responsible for it. \r\n The report of the Secretary-General on the causes \r\nof conflict in Africa presents a set of important \r\nrecommendations, most notable among which is the \r\n A/61/PV.28\r\n \r\n21 06-56843 \r\n \r\nproposal to create millennium peace and security goals \r\nthat would accord highest priority to the protection of \r\ncivilians in the overall collective security system. \r\nDespite the fact that the report links that proposal to \r\nthe goal of a conflict-free Africa by 2010, the proposal \r\nundoubtedly has implications beyond the borders of the \r\nAfrican continent. To that end, we look forward to \r\nreceiving further information on the scope of the \r\naforementioned proposal and the appropriateness of its \r\nsubmission at a time when developing and least \r\ndeveloped countries are struggling to mobilize \r\nsustained international attention for their aspirations \r\nand concerns with respect to the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. \r\n While we acknowledge all efforts and initiatives \r\nrelated to combating malaria, we remain unable to \r\nachieve our objectives in that respect. The most recent \r\nreport of the Secretary-General clearly reflects that \r\nreality and argues that its primary cause is the lack of \r\nsustained international financial support and of \r\nappropriate technical capacities to address the \r\npandemic. Hence, there is a clear need for partnership \r\nat all levels, the provision of treatment and treated nets \r\nat affordable prices, and the development of creative \r\nmeans to intensify individual and collective efforts \r\naimed at the elimination of malaria. \r\n The proposals presented in the report of the \r\nSecretary-General contain positive ideas that could be \r\nadopted or further elaborated during the upcoming \r\nperiod to meet our objectives. In that context, \r\nfollowing its success in totally eliminating the \r\npandemic, Egypt reiterates its readiness to share its \r\nexpertise in the area of combating and rolling back \r\nmalaria. We also wish to recall the Egyptian initiative, \r\nadopted at the 2005 African Union summit in Abuja, to \r\nestablish an African regional centre in Cairo for \r\nepidemic and indigenous diseases and HIV/AIDS, \r\nwhich would provide and develop vaccines, serums and \r\nmedications for all such epidemics, including malaria. \r\nEgypt looks forward to increasing regional and \r\ninternational efforts to support that initiative, aimed at \r\nthe alleviation of one of the primary causes of suffering \r\nfor the African peoples. \r\n Mr. Tanko (Nigeria): It is now five years since \r\nAfrica adopted the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) as its development strategy, \r\nand four years since the Partnership’s endorsement by \r\nthe international community as the framework for \r\nsupport to Africa. In the intervening years, many \r\npositive changes have taken place in Africa, notably \r\nthe peaceful transfer of power from one democratically \r\nelected Government to another in several countries, the \r\nresolution of conflicts, and the consolidation of efforts \r\nto sustain peace, security and stability in the continent. \r\nThose developments have received positive mention in \r\nthe Secretary-General’s reports before us. \r\n Undoubtedly, the obstacles facing the continent \r\nare enormous, but so too are the opportunities to \r\ntransform the lives of our peoples. African leaders \r\nremain resolute in their commitment and efforts to \r\nresolve conflicts, promote peace and achieve \r\nsustainable development. Carefully designed \r\npeacebuilding initiatives have been deployed at the \r\nsubregional and continental levels, including the \r\nhistoric launching of the Peace and Security Council of \r\nthe Africa Union, the deployment of some of our best \r\ntroops and police in service under the African Union \r\nMission in Sudan, and continuing exertions in Côte \r\nd’Ivoire to create conditions that would make the path \r\nof peace secure and irreversible. \r\n Let me, in that regard, recall the statement of \r\nPresident Olusegun Obasanjo to this Assembly on \r\n25 September 2006, which captured the ethos of \r\nAfrica’s challenge. He said: \r\n  “For Africa, the most urgent challenge \r\nremains the resolution of conflicts and the \r\nmaintenance of peace and security as the \r\nfoundation for socio-economic progress.” \r\n(A/61/PV.18) \r\nNigeria firmly believes that resolving the conflicts in \r\nthe Sudan, Côte d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo, Somalia and other troubled spots in Africa \r\nmerits the best of our efforts. \r\n Nigeria will continue to coordinate efforts with \r\nother countries in our region, as well as like-minded \r\nmembers of the international community, to achieve \r\nthe shared goals of peace and security, stability and \r\ndevelopment in Africa. Whilst an analytical research of \r\nthe specific causes of conflict in each situation in \r\nAfrica is essential to improve the effectiveness of \r\nconflict prevention, peacekeeping and post-conflict \r\nrecovery measures, it is our conviction, however, that \r\nonly global cooperation would lead to a lasting \r\nsolution. \r\n Nowhere is such cooperation more urgent than in \r\nthe area of small arms and light weapons, whose \r\nA/61/PV.28  \r\n \r\n06-56843 22 \r\n \r\nproliferation and widespread use by non-State actors \r\nhave contributed to the persistence of conflicts. By the \r\nadoption of the Convention on Small Arms and Light \r\nWeapons, Their Ammunition, and Other Related \r\nMaterials last June, States members of the Economic \r\nCommunity of West African States demonstrated their \r\nresolve to combat the spread of those arms and \r\nweapons in our subregion. We invite other States \r\nMembers of the United Nations to emulate that \r\ndecision to enable us all to confront that scourge. \r\n We should not allow the regrettable failure at the \r\nrecent first United Nations Conference to Review \r\nProgress Made in the Implementation of the \r\nProgramme of Action to Prevent, Combat and \r\nEradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light \r\nWeapons in All Its Aspects to agree on a final \r\ndocument, including a ban on arms supplies to non-\r\nState actors, to weaken our resolve in that regard. \r\nInstead, we should strengthen the capacities of State \r\nauthorities and deny non-State actors the ready access \r\nto those weapons with which they have wrought so \r\nmuch destruction not only in Africa, but elsewhere in \r\nthe world. \r\n The Secretary-General’s fourth consolidated \r\nreport, in document A/61/212, as in past years provides \r\nuseful insights on the progress made in the \r\nimplementation of NEPAD and the challenges ahead. It \r\nis clear that a lot more needs to be done by all parties \r\nin support of Africa. \r\n The commitment of African leaders to NEPAD is \r\nevident from the priority projects that our respective \r\ncountries have initiated and are implementing \r\nconsistent with the broad objectives of the Programme. \r\nThose projects cover areas as varied as infrastructure, \r\ninformation and communication technologies, health, \r\neducation and agriculture. \r\n However, our countries continue to face the dire \r\nshortage of resources commensurate with the scale of \r\nambition and desire to transform Africa. Resources \r\nmobilized from all sources have fallen short of \r\nminimum targets on NEPAD priority projects, a \r\nsituation to which the Secretary-General refers in one \r\nof his reports. Support for Africa must therefore \r\ntranscend platitudes; it must be reflected in concrete \r\nassistance. Only thus shall we be able to maintain the \r\nmomentum generated in recent years in support of the \r\ncontinent. \r\n Nigeria has, on its part, adopted a comprehensive \r\nstrategy for realizing its development objectives, \r\nintegrating into the process the goals and targets of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and NEPAD. The \r\nobjective of the macroeconomic and political reforms \r\nintroduced by President Olusegun Obasanjo since 1999 \r\nis to reposition Nigeria as one of the leading economies \r\nin the world. Our flagship development framework, the \r\nNational Economic Empowerment Development \r\nStrategy, has been designed to mobilize our national \r\nresources, create self-sustaining economic growth that \r\nwill translate into prosperity for our peoples, and thus \r\nbequeath to generations to come a strong, self-\r\nconfident nation that can continue to be relied upon to \r\nplay an important role in our region and the world at \r\nlarge. \r\n The strategy is anchored on four key strategies: to \r\nreform the way Government and its institutions work, \r\nto develop the private sector as the driving force for \r\ngrowth, to implement a social charter, and to reorient \r\nthe value system in Nigeria. \r\n In 1999, there were 590 public enterprises \r\nspanning such areas as petroleum, mining, power, \r\ntelecommunications, steel, transport and banking. \r\nThrough a vigorous privatization programme, as \r\nreflected in the Public Enterprises Act of 1999, the \r\nNigerian Government has divested itself of its shares in \r\nmost of those ventures, which, in turn, are now better \r\nmanaged and have become more efficient. \r\n Achieving food security is the spearhead of our \r\npoverty eradication programmes. We have therefore \r\nadopted policy measures to boost agricultural \r\nproductivity, with emphasis on food production and \r\npreservation. Working with the Food and Agriculture \r\nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO), we have \r\ndedicated a trust fund on food security, managed by the \r\nFAO, to boost our food reserves and availability to all \r\nNigerians. In pursuit of our development goals, \r\nappropriate laws have been enacted and strong anti-\r\ncorruption institutions created. We intend to reinforce \r\nthat process by making those changes irreversible. \r\n I should emphasize that good social, economic \r\nand political governance is the core of the new \r\norientation in public management in Nigeria. That is \r\nthe bedrock of the vision of NEPAD, whose optional \r\nAfrican Peer Review Mechanism has been embraced \r\nby 25 countries, including Nigeria. \r\n A/61/PV.28\r\n \r\n23 06-56843 \r\n \r\n Nigeria is concerned that Africa is the only \r\ncontinent that is not on track to meet the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, particularly the goal of reducing \r\npoverty and hunger by half by the year 2015. While we \r\nare mindful of the support rendered by various \r\npartners, including the United Nations system, to \r\nAfrican countries in the implementation of NEPAD, we \r\nshould draw attention to the fact that the assistance so \r\nfar provided falls short of Africa’s overall needs. Many \r\nNEPAD programmes and projects are on hold for lack \r\nof resources to finance their implementation. A more \r\npositive assistance, provided in a timely manner, \r\nshould therefore boost the efforts of Africa’s leadership \r\nand Governments. \r\n There are other measures that can facilitate \r\nAfrica’s development objectives. Those include market \r\naccess for African goods and services, the removal of \r\nagricultural subsidies and other harmful barriers, an \r\nincrease in official development assistance, foreign \r\ndirect investment, and debt cancellation or relief. Clear \r\naction on each and every one of those issues would \r\nserve notice of the positive engagement of Africa’s \r\ndevelopment partners with us in the campaign to \r\nreverse our economic fortunes and return the continent \r\nto the mainstream of global development. \r\n It is equally desirable that the United Nations \r\nsystem not relent in its support for NEPAD. We call for \r\nthe strengthening of its advocacy and coordination \r\nmechanisms for NEPAD beyond the funds, \r\nprogrammes and specialized agencies. Towards that \r\nend, the resource needs of the United Nations system \r\nshould be kept under constant review so that stepped-\r\nup support for NEPAD programmes, especially in the \r\narea of capacity-building, technical assistance and \r\ntransfer of knowledge and expertise, does not suffer. \r\nNigeria believes that the acceleration of the \r\nimplementation of the Bali Strategic Plan for \r\nTechnology Support and Capacity-Building would be \r\ninvaluable in that process. We also hope that the Chief \r\nExecutives Board will continue to give adequate \r\nsupport to the Office of the Special Adviser on Africa \r\nto enable it to carry out its mandate. \r\n I wish to recall that Nigeria warmly welcomed \r\nthe Millennium Villages project when it was launched \r\nat the sixtieth session. We note with satisfaction that \r\nthe project is now operational in 10 African countries, \r\nincluding Nigeria — a development that attests to how \r\nmodest resources can make an enormous difference to \r\nthe reduction of poverty in rural areas. We commend \r\nthe United Nations Development Programme for \r\nincorporating the Millennium Villages project into its \r\nwork and urge that the lessons learnt be taken into \r\naccount in other quick-impact initiatives in developing \r\ncountries. \r\n Africa continues to pay a heavy price from the \r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic, further deepening the continent’s \r\ndevelopment crisis. The resurgence of malaria, \r\ntuberculosis and other infectious diseases has stretched \r\nAfrica’s capacity to the limits. As most reports have \r\nshown, there has been a steady increase in recent years \r\nin the number of people living with HIV/AIDS in \r\nsub-Saharan Africa. To confront that disturbing \r\nsituation, African leaders have expressed their political \r\nsupport for fighting HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis \r\nand other infectious diseases, and have embarked upon \r\npolicies towards that end. For the second time in the \r\npast five years, Nigeria hosted in June 2006 a summit \r\non HIV/AIDS, during which African leaders reaffirmed \r\ntheir Governments’ commitment to allocating 15 per \r\ncent of their national budgets to the health sector. We \r\nhope that those efforts will continue to receive the \r\ngenerous and sustained support of the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n Success in promoting peace and sustaining social \r\nand economic development in Africa will require \r\ngenuine partnership through international cooperation. \r\nOur respective commitments should be reflected not in \r\npious declaration, but in concrete action. Africa would \r\nthen emerge a very strong continent. \r\n Mr. Badji (Senegal) (spoke in French): Senegal \r\nis grateful to the Secretary-General for having quickly \r\naccomplished the important job of making available to \r\nthe General Assembly the relevant reports (A/61/212 \r\nand A/61/213), which clearly reveal the tremendous \r\nchallenges that await us in our endeavours to give \r\nsubstance to the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) and to implement sustainable \r\npeace in Africa. \r\n My delegation fully concurs with the statement \r\nmade earlier by the representative of South Africa on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China and would like to \r\nmake some additional comments.  \r\n NEPAD was created by African leaders as a result \r\nof the lack of success, or even the failure, of \r\ninnumerable programmes and initiatives of past \r\ndecades. It was then adopted by the international \r\ncommunity as part of a resolute effort to match \r\nA/61/PV.28  \r\n \r\n06-56843 24 \r\n \r\ndevelopment initiatives and peace efforts in Africa to \r\nthe specific needs of the continent. That adoption \r\npresaged an improvement in the economic prospects of \r\nthe African countries and provided a common response \r\nto the economic paradigm in Africa.  \r\n At the same time, while everyone seems to agree \r\non the legitimate ambitions and the relevance of \r\nNEPAD, the existing reality causes us to be less than \r\nenthusiastic about the results. In fact, in spite of the \r\nencouraging signs presented appropriately in the report \r\nof the Secretary-General — and with which we are \r\npleased — progress is still slow and the difficulties on \r\nthe continent continue to weigh upon its future due to a \r\nlack of mobilization of international support — support \r\nthat should be sizeable.  \r\n If, despite the efforts made, Africa continues to \r\nfigure prominently on the international agenda, it is \r\nbecause the anticipated support from the international \r\ncommunity has not risen to the level of declared \r\nexpectations and ambitions. That means that \r\nhumanitarian crises persist, that poverty and pandemics \r\n— especially HIV/AIDS — continue to spread and that \r\nthe promises for increased assistance have not been \r\nkept. The debt burden remains unbearable; direct \r\nforeign investment is not what it should be; and access \r\nto Northern markets is obstructed by numerous tariff \r\nand non-tariff barriers.  \r\n If the international community truly wants to help \r\nAfrica, that would involve, as the Secretary-General \r\nhas said, keeping promises and making financial \r\nefforts. We welcome the relevant proposals in his \r\nreport for fulfilling the contractual commitments made \r\nto Africa and for taking concrete steps and measures to \r\nstrengthen the impetus for the implementation of \r\nNEPAD. \r\n At the same time, the need for international \r\nsupport does not absolve each State of its primary \r\nresponsibility to implement its own development. That \r\nis the philosophy upon which NEPAD is based. \r\nTherefore, we are pleased to note that a number of \r\nAfrican countries have undertaken bold reforms as part \r\nof the transition to democracy and to good economic \r\nand political governance, and have made considerable \r\nprogress in the areas of human rights and the rule of \r\nlaw. The adoption of the African Peer Review \r\nMechanism is an eloquent illustration of that. At the \r\nsame time, such progress should not divert us from \r\nanother essential element of work — to which my \r\ncountry is totally committed — which is to continue \r\nour efforts to eliminate all conflicts completely, as that \r\nis the sole prerequisite by which we may, on an \r\nongoing basis, remain committed to the path that leads \r\nto development. \r\n In the report of the Secretary-General on the \r\ncauses of conflict in Africa (A/61/213), poverty, \r\ninequality and poor governance are identified as the \r\nmajor causes of conflict situations on the continent. \r\nThus, establishing conditions for stability and \r\nsustainable peace in Africa also means addressing the \r\nchallenges of development and eradicating poverty, \r\nwhich often feeds conflicts. \r\n At the same time, a careful analysis of the report \r\nallows us realize that the most serious threats involve \r\npower, in particular its acquisition and management, \r\nand the distribution of wealth. Thus, political and \r\neconomic governance remains an important element in \r\nconflict prevention. It is vital to establish conditions \r\nfor organizing free and transparent elections, which is \r\nthe only way to ensure a fair distribution of power. \r\nAlong those lines, Senegal is particularly pleased with \r\nthe remarkable progress observed in a number of \r\ncountries, such as Liberia, Sierra Leone, Burundi and \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, and earnestly \r\nhopes the same momentum will be established in the \r\nneighbourly countries of the Côte d’Ivoire, the Sudan, \r\nSomalia and elsewhere. \r\n We see in the establishment of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission the hope for stronger cooperation and \r\ninteraction, not only with the Security Council and the \r\nEconomic and Social Council, but also with regional \r\nand subregional African mechanisms to promote \r\nstability, including the Peace and Security Council of \r\nthe African Union and the African Peer Review \r\nMechanism. The objective, therefore, is to \r\ncomprehensively grasp the problems of conflict \r\nprevention and to provide the necessary assistance of \r\nthe United Nations system in those peace efforts. \r\n Along those lines, Senegal is also pleased with \r\nthe decision of the Secretary-General to dispatch to the \r\nAfrican Union an interdepartmental task force whose \r\nmain task will be to elaborate a 10-year capacity-\r\nbuilding plan to forge closer and more structured \r\ncooperation between the Security Council and the \r\nPeace and Security Council of the African Union, to \r\nimprove rapid alert capabilities, develop competencies \r\nin mediation and the maintenance of peace, and to \r\n A/61/PV.28\r\n \r\n25 06-56843 \r\n \r\nassist in building capacities in political and electoral \r\nmatters, governance, human rights, the rule of law, \r\npeacebuilding and humanitarian assistance. We \r\nimpatiently await the conclusions of the task force.  \r\n By the same token, it is necessary for \r\nnon-African States to strengthen their assistance to the \r\nAfrican Union by making available appropriate \r\nresources and by providing the necessary assistance to \r\nmeet the mandate of establishing and maintaining \r\npeace, which the African Union, up until now, has done \r\nits best to finance on its own. \r\n In another area, the promotion of sustainable \r\ndevelopment in Africa remains, to a large extent, \r\ndependent on resolving health issues that affect the \r\ncontinent. Therefore, we believe it urgent to adopt an \r\nintegrated approach in addressing public health \r\nproblems such as malaria, which is both a cause and a \r\nconsequence of poverty. Must it be repeated that this \r\npandemic kills more than 1 million people in Africa \r\nevery year, causes the loss of $12 billion in gross \r\ndomestic product and is responsible for 40 per cent of \r\npublic health expenditures? Some estimates attribute \r\nan annual growth deficit of almost 1.3 per cent to this \r\nscourge in African countries.  \r\n In order to tangibly reduce the prevalence of this \r\nillness, we need to do more to support African efforts \r\nthrough an even greater mobilization within The \r\nGlobal Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria \r\nand in implementing quick impact projects called for in \r\nthe 2005 World Summit.  \r\n In conclusion, I wish to restate that the global \r\npartnership for development, which you have made the \r\ntheme of this session of the General Assembly, has in \r\nNEPAD a unique and effective framework for its \r\nimplementation. My country hopes to see the system of \r\nthe United Nations continue to do more to lend its \r\ninvaluable support to NEPAD in the pursuit of its \r\nobjective to catapult Africa into the ranks of developed \r\nand prosperous continents.  \r\n Mrs. Mordoche (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): For \r\nsome people in the world, Africa is still just a myth and \r\na veritable mine of resources where they can earn huge \r\nprofits without paying the high costs and catastrophic \r\nconsequences that this centuries-long exploitation and \r\nplundering process has brought on the African peoples. \r\nThis erroneous vision has prevented these countries \r\nfrom understanding and acquiring a true awareness of \r\nthe hardships that this continent is undergoing today \r\nand of the need to pay off the incalculable historical \r\ndebt that all of humanity owes to Africa. \r\n Many of those who now express their concerns \r\nfor the grave economic and social problems affecting \r\nthe African countries have not been able to show a true \r\npolitical resolve to change this gloomy landscape and \r\nits structural causes. Now they think that lukewarm and \r\nmeagre initiatives will solve the severe situation in the \r\nAfrican countries and disguise the low level of \r\nfulfilment of the commitments that they have made. \r\nTheir harsh reality has proved otherwise. Not only does \r\nAfrica continue to be marginalized and totally \r\ndisadvantaged in international economic relations, but \r\nits levels of poverty continue to grow at an alarming \r\nrate, along with surges of armed conflicts and the \r\nspread of diseases like AIDS that are decimating entire \r\npopulations of the African continent. \r\n The cause of this has been the economic and \r\nfinancial policies and the frenzied waves of \r\nprivatization coming with the neo-liberal globalization \r\nprocess imposed by the developed countries. These \r\ncountries have ensured the perpetuation of the \r\nprecarious situation that plagues the African countries. \r\nIt is not the weaknesses of African institutions that is to \r\nblame, as the developed countries want us to believe. A \r\nfew figures will suffice to illustrate these points. \r\n In the last 20 years, the imposition of trade \r\nliberalization has cost the African countries some $272 \r\nbillion, an amount that would have been enough to pay \r\noff the continent’s debt. Moreover, it has provoked a \r\nserious deterioration of the terms of trade and an \r\nincrease of capital flight, which nowadays is the largest \r\nin the world in regional terms. With 11 per cent of the \r\nworld’s population and the largest natural reserves in \r\nthe world, Africa contributes only 1 per cent of the \r\nworld’s gross domestic product (GDP) and its share of \r\nthe world trade barely reaches 2 per cent. \r\n However, the developed countries’ commitment \r\nto a $50 billion increase in annual assistance by 2010 \r\nhas not been fulfilled. The seeming increase in such \r\nassistance in the last few years has been mainly due to \r\ndebt cancellation grants and emergency assistance. It is \r\nstill far from the amount needed for the African \r\ncountries to be able to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). While some sources \r\nindicate that the flow of foreign direct investment \r\nincreased in some African countries, there was a clear \r\ndecrease in others and, moreover, most of the increase \r\nA/61/PV.28  \r\n \r\n06-56843 26 \r\n \r\nwas only concentrated in the area of the exploitation of \r\nnatural resources. \r\n It is high time for the international community, \r\nparticularly the developed countries, to go beyond \r\nsimply stating their concerns to implementing solutions \r\nand keeping their commitments. \r\n For Cuba, Africa is very close to our hearts; it is \r\npart and parcel of what we are. It informs our identity \r\nand culture; a great part of the Cuban population’s \r\nroots are in Africa. More than a million Africans were \r\ntaken to Cuba by force, after being pulled from their \r\nhomelands — coming from different ethnic groups \r\nsuch as the Yoruba, Congo, Carabali and others. They \r\nworked under the whip in the hell of the sugar \r\nplantations for the benefit of the island’s landowners \r\nand the colonial metropole. \r\n The uprisings and escapes of the slaves from \r\noppression nurtured our vocation for liberty. Our \r\nindependence wars had the mass participation of \r\nAfrican descendants, who gave us brilliant leaders of \r\nour liberation army. \r\n The Cuban nation was born out of the particularly \r\nfertile mix of African, European and Chinese blood, \r\nand was born proclaiming the pride for its African \r\nroots and the emancipation of its children of African \r\norigin. \r\n Since the very year of its triumph, the revolution \r\noffered and continues to offer its support of and \r\nsolidarity with the African peoples on the basis of the \r\nconsistent practice of internationalism and solidarity \r\nwith the peoples of the world, a guiding principle of \r\nour foreign policy. \r\n Despite being a country with scarce resources and \r\nsubject for over four decades to a cruel and genocidal \r\neconomic, financial and commercial blockade by the \r\nGovernment of the United States, Cuba has trained more \r\nthan 30,000 African students and 1,661 young people \r\nfrom 43 African countries are currently studying in our \r\nuniversities — 708 of them studying medicine. More \r\nthan 2,433 Cuban overseas workers provide their selfless \r\nservices in 33 African countries — of those, 1,893 are \r\nworking in the area of health care. \r\n As a result of our comprehensive health care \r\ndelivery programme, our doctors have saved the lives \r\nof more than 729,000 Africans. A literacy campaign is \r\ncurrently being implemented in several African \r\ncountries to help tackle the critical situation of \r\nilliteracy that this continent suffers from. Our \r\ncooperation with the African countries proves that \r\nsignificant results can be achieved with serious \r\npolitical will. Cuba has taken from Africa only the \r\nmortal remains of its dead. Cuba has no property there, \r\nno mines and no oil wells. We reaffirm our \r\ndetermination to continue providing selfless aid to our \r\nAfrican brothers and sisters and sharing our main \r\nwealth: human capital. Africans do not need to be \r\nreminded of their problems and suffering. They do not \r\nneed charity. Africa does require resources and \r\nconcrete action. Let us act jointly. Let us save Africa. \r\n Mr. Kodera (Japan): First, my delegation would \r\nlike to touch on agenda item 62(b), on the causes of \r\nconflict in Africa, and then on agenda item 48, on the \r\nDecade to Roll Back Malaria. We thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his two comprehensive reports on agenda \r\nitem 62 and for the report of his Advisory Panel on \r\nInternational Support for the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD). Japan is glad to see \r\nthat progress has been made in implementing of \r\nNEPAD, in generating international commitment to \r\nNEPAD, and in improving the prospects for peace in \r\nmany countries. \r\n At the Third Tokyo International Conference on \r\nAfrican Development (TICAD III) in 2003, the \r\nGovernment of Japan announced that it would support \r\nNEPAD through an enhanced TICAD process. Japan \r\nwill continue to do so, as it proceeds with preparations \r\nfor TICAD IV in 2008. As part of that process, a Japan-\r\nNEPAD policy dialogue was held in Japan in March \r\n2006. To contribute to even more effective \r\nimplementation of NEPAD, Japan identified four out of \r\nthe eight priorities in the programme of action as being \r\nin need of immediate support. They are: infrastructure; \r\nagriculture; improving market access through the \r\npromotion of trade, investment and private sector \r\ndevelopment; and developing human resources through \r\nsupport for education and public health. \r\n A recent development in the concrete support \r\nJapan provides to NEPAD is Japan’s decision to extend \r\nassistance to the Mali-Senegal South Corridor, which is \r\none of the short-term action plan projects. In terms of \r\ntrade and investment, Japan will convene the Africa-\r\nAsia Business Forum IV (AABF IV) in 2007 in close \r\ncollaboration with United Nations agencies, in the \r\nbelief that promotion of trade and investment is key to \r\nsustainable economic development. Foreign direct \r\ninvestment tends to favour North Africa, however, and \r\n A/61/PV.28\r\n \r\n27 06-56843 \r\n \r\nthe rest of the continent needs more attention. Japan \r\nhopes that the coming Forum will help invigorate \r\nbusiness interaction between Asia and Africa. \r\n Almost half of all post-conflict countries have \r\ntended to relapse into conflict within several years \r\nwhen they are outside the focus of the world’s \r\nattention. Ensuring consolidation of peace is one of the \r\nmain items on the TICAD agenda. Japan and other \r\nconference organizers convened the TICAD \r\nConference on the Consolidation of Peace in Ethiopia \r\nin February 2006. At that conference, Japan expressed \r\nits view that security, political governance and \r\ntransition, community reconstruction and socio-\r\neconomic development should be addressed in a \r\ncomprehensive and well-coordinated manner. \r\n We are now observing the fifth anniversary of \r\nNEPAD, whose implementation will go into full swing \r\nas we move towards 2010. Based on the commitments \r\nmade by the G8 members and other donors in 2005, \r\ntotal official development assistance (ODA) to Africa \r\nis expected to amount to $25 billion annually in real \r\nterms between 2004 and 2010. Effective use must be \r\nmade of this increase in ODA in order to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals in Africa and promote \r\nNEPAD. At the same time, however, we believe that \r\nprojects should be appropriately aligned with each \r\nAfrican country’s national development strategy or \r\npoverty reduction strategy paper to ensure good \r\ncoordination with other development partners. \r\n Allow me to turn to agenda item 48, on the \r\nDecade to Roll Back Malaria. This is the year we \r\nconduct a mid-term review of the Roll Back Malaria \r\n \r\n2005-2010 campaign. Although effective tools and key \r\nsubstances to control malaria exist, we all know that \r\nthe disease remains a major worldwide health problem. \r\nThe Secretary-General’s report makes it clear what \r\nUnited Nations agencies, Governments and the private \r\nsector have failed to do and which activities need to be \r\nimproved. Special emphasis is placed on the need to \r\nincrease the availability of key inputs such as long-\r\nlasting insecticide-treated nets and artemisinian-\r\ncombination therapies. \r\n To expand access to preventive measures, Japan \r\nwill support distribution of 10 million treated nets to \r\nAfrican countries by 2007, in particular targeting \r\npregnant women and children. At the same time, a \r\nJapanese company in the private sector, in cooperation \r\nwith the Government of Tanzania, established a factory \r\nin that country to produce a reliable supply of \r\naffordable insecticide-treated nets. Also, Japan has \r\nbeen one of the major contributors to the Global Fund \r\nto Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. \r\n In order to achieve effective and sustainable \r\nstrategies to combat malaria and other diseases, we \r\nmust not rely on fragmented approaches, but must \r\ninstead work to establish national health systems. We \r\nbelieve that capacity-building in the public health \r\nsector is essential in this regard. Also, the international \r\nassistance given to developing countries hardest hit by \r\nmalaria, especially those in Africa, needs to be \r\nstrengthened in order to ensure universal access to \r\nhealth services. Japan intends to continue to work with \r\nthe international community to achieve our common \r\ngoal of controlling malaria. \r\n  The meeting rose at 1.10 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\n"
