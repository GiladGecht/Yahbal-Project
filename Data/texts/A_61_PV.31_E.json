(Bahrain) \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 104 \r\n \r\n \r\nAppointment of the Secretary-General of the \r\nUnited Nations \r\n \r\n \r\n  Letter from the President of the Security \r\nCouncil to the President of the General \r\nAssembly (A/61/501) \r\n \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/61/L.3) \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly has before it \r\ndocument A/61/501, containing a letter dated 9 October \r\n2006 from the President of the Security Council \r\naddressed to the President of the General Assembly. \r\nMembers will recall that on that same day, I \r\ntransmitted copies of that letter to all Member States. \r\n In this regard, I now call on the President of the \r\nSecurity Council, who will report to the Assembly on \r\nthe work undertaken by the Council on this matter. \r\n Mr. Oshima (Japan): It is an honour and \r\nprivilege for me, in my capacity as President of the \r\nSecurity Council for the month of October, to address \r\nthe General Assembly in order to convey to it the \r\nrecommendation of the Security Council for the \r\nappointment of the Secretary-General of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n At its 5547th meeting, held in private on \r\n9 October 2006, the Security Council adopted by \r\nacclamation resolution 1715 (2006) concerning the \r\nrecommendation for the appointment of the \r\nSecretary-General. \r\n I shall now read out the text of the resolution. \r\nResolution 1715 (2006) reads as follows: \r\n  “The Security Council, \r\n  “Having considered the question of the \r\nrecommendation for the appointment of the \r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, \r\n  “Recommends to the General Assembly that \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon be appointed Secretary-General \r\nof the United Nations for a term of office from \r\n1 January 2007 to 31 December 2011.” \r\n Since, early this year, the Security Council \r\npledged to conclude its part in the selection process by \r\nOctober, the Council is pleased that, by adopting its \r\nrecommendation for the appointment on 9 October, the \r\nCouncil met this goal. The Security Council believes \r\nthat early action upon the appointment by the General \r\nAssembly would ensure ample time for transition \r\nbetween the current and incoming Secretaries-General. \r\n On behalf of the Security Council, I would like to \r\nexpress appreciation to all Member States that \r\npresented candidates as part of the selection process. \r\n Finally, I would like to thank you, Madam, for \r\nhaving convened this meeting expeditiously following \r\nthe recommendation made to the General Assembly by \r\nthe Security Council. \r\nA/61/PV.31  \r\n \r\n06-56975 2 \r\n \r\n The President: In connection with the \r\nrecommendation of the Security Council, the General \r\nAssembly has before it a draft resolution issued as \r\ndocument A/61/L.3, which was made available on the \r\ninitiative of the Chairman of the Group of Asian States \r\nand which enjoys the support of the other four regional \r\ngroups. \r\n The General Assembly will now take a decision \r\non draft resolution A/61/L.3. May I take it that it is the \r\nwish of the General Assembly to adopt draft resolution \r\nA/61/L.3 by acclamation? \r\n The draft resolution was adopted by acclamation \r\n(resolution 61/3). \r\n The President: I now request the Chief of \r\nProtocol to escort His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon to \r\nthe platform. \r\n The Chief of Protocol escorted the Secretary-\r\nGeneral-designate, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, to the \r\nplatform. \r\n The President: I have the honour to announce \r\nthat His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon has been \r\nappointed by acclamation Secretary-General of the \r\nUnited Nations for a term of office beginning on \r\n1 January 2007 and ending on 31 December 2011.  \r\n The General Assembly has just adopted the \r\nresolution on the appointment of His Excellency \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon as Secretary-General of the United \r\nNations. This is a historic day for the Organization as it \r\ncontinues to evolve and live up to the values and \r\nprinciples of the Charter. \r\n On behalf of the General Assembly, I wish to \r\nextend my sincerest congratulations to Minister Ban \r\nKi-moon on his appointment as the eighth Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations. I am deeply honoured \r\nto welcome him to the United Nations, an Organization \r\nwhich is not unfamiliar to him and to which he has \r\ndevoted a considerable part of his outstanding \r\ndiplomatic career. \r\n He is one of the most prominent figures of the \r\nRepublic of Korea, a peaceful nation that has made a \r\nremarkable transformation to become a stable \r\ndemocracy and a vibrant economy during the past three \r\ndecades. His appointment comes at a time when the \r\nOrganization is deeply engaged in a wide-ranging \r\nreform process, outlined by world leaders in September \r\nlast year.  \r\n We are grateful to Secretary-General Kofi Annan, \r\nwho has played a major role in shaping a clear and \r\ncomprehensive vision to address the many global \r\nchallenges confronting us. I am confident that the \r\nOrganization will build upon its past achievements and \r\nmove ahead to become an even more effective body \r\nunder the leadership of Secretary-General-designate \r\nBan Ki-moon. \r\n We have still before us many challenges, from \r\nextreme poverty and hunger to armed conflicts, disease \r\nand international terrorism; and we have yet to find the \r\nmost appropriate ways to make globalization work for \r\nall.  \r\n The credibility of this Organization will be tested \r\nby our ability to continue to work in unity and meet the \r\nexpectations of the millions of people of the world. \r\nToday’s decision gives us hope that we are ready to \r\ntake collective responsibility and act with \r\ndetermination on matters of common concern. \r\n I appeal to all members to extend to Secretary-\r\nGeneral-designate Ban Ki-moon your utmost support \r\nto ensure a smooth transition as he prepares to assume \r\nhis term in office. He can be assured of my full \r\ncooperation to facilitate his work. May I take this \r\nopportunity to wish him all success in his upcoming \r\nendeavour. \r\n I now give the floor to the Secretary-General, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Kofi Annan.  \r\n The Secretary-General: Let me extend my \r\nwarmest congratulations to my successor, Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon. Let me also congratulate all of you, the \r\nMember States, on this choice. \r\n I am delighted that Mr. Ban’s election turned out \r\nthis way — early and orderly. Surely, this is the way \r\nwe would wish all Secretaries-General to be elected. I \r\nwould also say that the process worked well because \r\nMember States were determined to achieve an early \r\noutcome and because the winning candidate had \r\nexceptional qualifications. \r\n I think everyone here recognizes the depth of \r\nMr. Ban’s experience, the breadth of his connections \r\nand his ability to cooperate effectively at the highest \r\nlevels. But, as someone who has known and worked \r\nwith him for several years, I think that others will soon \r\ndiscover something else — something more — if they \r\ndo not see it already: a future Secretary-General who is \r\nexceptionally attuned to the sensitivities of countries \r\n A/61/PV.31\r\n \r\n3 06-56975 \r\n \r\nand constituencies in every continent; a man with a \r\ntruly global mind at the helm of the world’s only \r\nuniversal Organization. \r\n Mr. Ban’s early election will give us a head start \r\nin ensuring the smoothest possible transition. I recall, \r\nat the beginning of the process, I said “I wish the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the [Security] Council do not do \r\nto my successor what they did to me”. I was elected on \r\nFriday, 13 December. \r\n I would presume to give him only one piece of \r\nadvice for when he takes office next year: try to make \r\nfull use of the unparalleled resource found in the staff \r\nof the Organization. Their commitment to the United \r\nNations is the greatest asset of the United Nations and \r\nhas been the surest source of strength for me in my \r\nwork as Secretary-General. \r\n More than 50 years ago, the first Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations, Trygve Lie, used the \r\nfollowing words in greeting his successor, Dag \r\nHammarskjöld: “You are about to take over the most \r\nimpossible job on Earth”. While that may be true, I \r\nwould add that it is also the best possible job on Earth. \r\n There will be time to wish him well more fully as \r\nwe reach the moment of transfer of authority towards \r\nthe end of the year. Until then, my colleagues and I \r\nwill do all we can to assist him as he prepares for the \r\nroad ahead. \r\n As he readies himself to take over, I wish him \r\nboth strength and courage. He will need those \r\nattributes, but, equally, he will need a healthy sense of \r\nhumour — which I know he possesses in abundance. \r\nSo he must not forget to have fun along the way. I wish \r\nhim the very best of luck. \r\n The President: I give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Gambia, who will speak on behalf of \r\nthe African States. \r\n Mr. Grey-Johnson (Gambia): The Group of \r\nAfrican States heartily congratulates Mr. Ban Ki-moon, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Korea, \r\non his election by acclamation as the eighth Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations, replacing Mr. Kofi \r\nAnnan, who will be retiring from the Organization at \r\nthe end of December 2006. \r\n Mr. Ban Ki-moon brings to the position a wealth \r\nof experience as an accomplished diplomat, \r\nadministrator and scholar. In fulfilling those roles in \r\nhis native land, he was exposed to a mix of experiences \r\nthat has prepared him well for the job of Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations. In less than 40 years, \r\nthe Republic of Korea rose from the status of least \r\ndeveloped country to become an industrialized, highly \r\ndeveloped nation. Today, it is the eleventh largest \r\neconomy in the world. Mr. Ban Ki-moon lived through \r\nthat period of transformation and in fact contributed to \r\nit in no small measure. That experience will surely \r\ncome in handy as he leads us forward with the \r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals. \r\n Since the end of the Korean War, which Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon lived through, his country has been involved \r\nas an active partner in peacebuilding and conflict \r\nprevention and resolution. He has played important \r\nroles in that process and I am sure will bring his hands-\r\non experiences to bear on the work of the Organization \r\nin those very important areas, which are at the very \r\nheart of the mandate of the United Nations. His coming \r\non board at a time when developments in his own \r\nregion of the world call for wisdom and cautious \r\ndiplomacy can also augur well for our efforts to \r\nmediate the very complex security situation that is now \r\nunfolding in the Korean peninsula. I am sure he will \r\nalso help us make progress more generally on the \r\ndisarmament issues and move us forward on the \r\ndenuclearization agenda. \r\n The immediate preoccupation is with reform of \r\nthe Organization. As an astute administrator, Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon comes to the job with the tools that should \r\nmake it easier for us to achieve faster results, \r\nespecially with management reform, but also with the \r\nreform of the Security Council, the Economic and \r\nSocial Council and, indeed, the General Assembly. He \r\nknows the house well, having served in his country’s \r\ndelegation and having been the chief adviser and \r\nmanager of the office of the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its fifty-sixth session. \r\n Africa looks forward to working with him on the \r\nmany issues of priority and concern to us, from \r\npeacekeeping and peacebuilding to poverty and all the \r\nother areas identified under the special needs of Africa \r\nchapter of the Outcome Document that was adopted by \r\nthe Summit of heads of State and Government last \r\nyear. We will lend him all the support and cooperation \r\nhe requires as he takes on his important \r\nresponsibilities. We congratulate him once more and \r\nwish him the very best. \r\nA/61/PV.31  \r\n \r\n06-56975 4 \r\n \r\n Let me seize this opportunity to commend our \r\noutgoing Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his \r\ntremendous contributions to multilateralism and the \r\nprinciples and purposes of the United Nations. We are \r\nindeed proud and very grateful that, through his \r\nexemplary service to the Organization for over a \r\ndecade, Africa was able to play a lead role in the \r\nmaintenance of world peace, the promotion of \r\nsustainable human development, and the prevention \r\nand resolution of conflict. We thank him for his many \r\nyears of invaluable service to humanity and wish him \r\nwell in his future endeavours. \r\n The President: I give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Japan, who will speak on behalf of \r\nthe Asian States. \r\n Mr. Oshima (Japan): It is indeed a great honour \r\nfor me today to address this body for a second time, \r\nonly through a coincidence. Nevertheless, it is a great \r\njoy for me to do so as the representative of a country \r\nthat is one of the immediate neighbours of the Republic \r\nof Korea, the country from which our next Secretary-\r\nGeneral hails. \r\n On behalf of the States members of the Asian \r\nGroup, it is my great pleasure and honour to most \r\nwarmly welcome the appointment of Mr. Ban Ki-moon \r\nof the Republic of Korea as the next Secretary-General \r\nand to extend our most sincere and heartfelt \r\ncongratulations to him on his appointment. \r\n The Asian Member States aspired from early on \r\nin the selection process that one of our sons, daughters, \r\nbrothers or sisters from the region would be given the \r\nopportunity to serve at the helm of our Organization, \r\n35 years after the third Secretary-General, U Thant. \r\nThat aspiration has today been realized through a \r\nunanimous decision of the General Assembly following \r\na recommendation unanimously arrived at in the \r\nSecurity Council. And for that, the Asian Member \r\nStates wish to express their gratitude to the States \r\nmembers of all regional groups for the understanding \r\nand support they have shown for that aspiration and the \r\ncandidature of Mr. Ban Ki-moon. \r\n In that connection, the States members of the \r\nAsian Group wish to extend special thanks to the \r\nAfrican Group and the Group of Latin American and \r\nCaribbean States for officially expressing, early in the \r\nprocess, their strong and unflagging support for the \r\nelection of an Asian candidate as the next Secretary-\r\nGeneral. Likewise, we are grateful to the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement countries for their consolidated support for \r\nAsia’s position in that regard. \r\n The Asian countries are confident that Secretary-\r\nGeneral-designate Ban Ki-moon will contribute \r\nsubstantially to the further enhancement of the role and \r\nprestige of our Organization, to reforms of the \r\nOrganization and the strengthening of the United \r\nNations system, to maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity, to promoting economic and social \r\ndevelopment and growth, and to protecting and \r\nenhancing human rights. \r\n Mr. Ban is a seasoned diplomat with long, rich \r\nand extensive experience in the public service of his \r\nhome country, the Republic of Korea, including as \r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs and Trade and at the United \r\nNations. His personal qualities, combined with his \r\ndiplomatic skills and a proven record of \r\naccomplishment in management and administration — \r\nall of which he now brings to the service of the United \r\nNations — show that all Member States will be in good \r\nhands with him as the chief administrator of our \r\nOrganization as it struggles to address new tasks and \r\nchallenges. \r\n The Asian region is proud of its many remarkable \r\ndevelopments and achievements in reducing poverty, \r\nattaining economic growth, providing more education \r\nto children, promoting democratic values and \r\ninstitutions, and so forth — although, admittedly, there \r\nare still many challenges. The country that Mr. Ban \r\nhails from is a remarkable example of the phenomenal \r\ngrowth and change witnessed in Asia. The Asian \r\nMember States can say with pride that it is most \r\nappropriate that such a country is sending one of its \r\nmost outstanding public servants to steer the course of \r\nthe United Nations at the beginning of the twenty-first \r\ncentury. \r\n Looking back over the selection process, several \r\ntalented, able and distinguished candidates besides \r\nMr. Ban were presented from the Asian region. We \r\nshould remember that the unanimous action to appoint \r\nMr. Ban, both in the Security Council and in the \r\nGeneral Assembly, was in the end made possible by the \r\nconsiderate cooperation of those other candidates. I \r\nwould like to take the opportunity to thank them all, as \r\nwell as the Member States which presented their \r\ncandidatures, in that regard. \r\n In conclusion, once again most warmly \r\nwelcoming the Secretary-General-designate, Mr. Ban, \r\n A/61/PV.31\r\n \r\n5 06-56975 \r\n \r\nand wishing him every success in fulfilling his highly \r\ndemanding mission at this crucial juncture in \r\ninternational relations and in the work of the United \r\nNations in particular, the States members of the Asian \r\nGroup pledge their firm support to him in the discharge \r\nof his formidable and weighty responsibilities in the \r\nmonths and years ahead. \r\n Finally, I am sure there will be another \r\nopportunity to formally express our deep appreciation \r\nto Secretary-General Kofi Annan, but allow me on this \r\noccasion, on behalf of the Asian Group, to reaffirm our \r\nrespect for Secretary-General Kofi Annan and \r\nreconfirm our commitment to continued cooperation \r\nwith him as he perseveres in tackling the mountain of \r\nissues that remain to be addressed until his final day in \r\noffice. \r\n The President: I give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Bosnia and Herzegovina, who will \r\nspeak on behalf of the Eastern European States. \r\n Mr. Prica (Bosnia and Herzegovina): I feel \r\nparticularly honoured to speak today on behalf of the \r\nGroup of Eastern European States on this historic \r\noccasion. \r\n First of all, I would like to extend a warm \r\nwelcome and our congratulations to the newly \r\nappointed Secretary-General of the United Nations, \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon, on his appointment to the most \r\nimportant post in today’s world. \r\n The whole world looks to him today with \r\nrenewed hope that the Organization will continue to be \r\nled in a way that will maintain its credibility, \r\nindependence and high efficiency, and to strive for the \r\nbest global solutions for the sake of the further \r\nadvancement of contemporary world society, calling \r\nupon his well-known extraordinary qualities, broad \r\nexperience in international relations, and the \r\nunanimous support he enjoys among Member States. \r\n The world has changed dramatically during the \r\npast decade, and new challenges have appeared on the \r\nhorizon. The activities of the Secretary-General will \r\ncontinue to be challenging, taking into account difficult \r\nunresolved conflicts, continuing threats to peace and \r\nstability in the world, and the obstacles to further \r\nreform of the Organization in order to make it more \r\nefficient and capable of tackling important issues and \r\nimplementing the right and broadly acceptable \r\ndecisions. \r\n Mr. Ban has taken upon his shoulders the very \r\ndifficult, but at the same time very noble task of \r\nleading our planet towards a better life and better \r\nopportunities for all in a peaceful, secure and healthy \r\nenvironment. We have no doubt that, under his prudent \r\nleadership and with our full support, which he can \r\ncount on, we shall continue the process of renewing \r\nand revitalizing the Organization. We are also \r\nconvinced that, during his mandate, the Millennium \r\nGoals will reach the point at which we can proudly \r\nannounce to the world that they have almost been \r\nachieved. \r\n We firmly believe that his mandate will be \r\ndesigned with many new innovative initiatives that will \r\nresult in a stronger and better United Nations, based on \r\ntolerance, diversity and multilateralism, and acceptable \r\nto the entire membership. His proven commitment to \r\nthe preservation of peace and security, the promotion \r\nof sustainable development, the protection of human \r\nrights, a healthy environment and social justice, \r\nespecially in the fight against poverty, is the best \r\nguarantee for success. \r\n Also, I would like to take this opportunity on \r\nbehalf of the Eastern European Group to express our \r\ndeepest appreciation to our current Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Kofi Annan, for his tireless efforts and enormous \r\npersonal contribution to the success of the United \r\nNations under his decade-long leadership. His legacy \r\nwill no doubt continue to be a foundation of our \r\nOrganization’s work for decades to come. \r\n Let me once again, on behalf of the Group of \r\nEastern European States, congratulate Mr. Ban on his \r\nelection and wish him every success. We look forward \r\nto friendly dialogue and cooperation, and he can count \r\non our full support. \r\n The President: I give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Ecuador, who will speak on behalf of \r\nthe Latin American and Caribbean States. \r\n Mr. Cordovez (Ecuador) (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nLatin American and Caribbean countries avail \r\nthemselves of this solemn opportunity, of such \r\nimportance to the Organization, to reaffirm their faith \r\nand hope in the United Nations. We believe that the \r\nprinciples and purposes of the Charter are as valid and \r\ncurrent today as they were upon their adoption 61 years \r\nago in San Francisco. For that reason, we solemnly \r\npledge to continue to support the United Nations \r\nefforts, to adhere to its objectives, and thereby to \r\nA/61/PV.31  \r\n \r\n06-56975 6 \r\n \r\nbroaden the possibilities of a better life for present and \r\nfuture generations. \r\n We would like to convey our sincerest thanks to \r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan for his 10 years of \r\ndiligent work on behalf of peace and development. \r\nWith admirable tenacity, the Secretary-General has \r\nbeen able to transmit to the peoples of the world a \r\nmessage of serenity in moments of anguish, of hope in \r\nmoments of despair, and of strength in moments of \r\nturbulence and adversity. His efforts in favour of \r\ncollective security and his desire to eliminate the \r\ntensions generated by threats to international peace and \r\nsecurity cannot be denied. We would like to extend our \r\nappreciation to his wife, Nane, for whom it was not \r\neasy to adjust to the rigours of her husband’s tasks, but \r\nwho has stood by him in his service to the Organization \r\nwith exceptional loyalty and spirit. \r\n We would like to hail the Secretary-General-\r\ndesignate, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, and wish him the greatest \r\nsuccess in the fulfilment of his duties. As he assumes \r\nhis high position with the support and the confidence \r\nof the States Members of the Organization, his success \r\nwill be ours. His diplomatic talent and his peaceable \r\nbut firm temperament will enable him to fully \r\naccomplish the tasks and duties entrusted to him upon \r\nhis designation. He can always rely on the support of \r\nthe Latin American and Caribbean region, which has \r\ntraditionally maintained with the United Nations since \r\nits foundation an intense working relationship with \r\nregard to the long list of matters whose outcomes have \r\nbeen of vital importance to our countries. \r\n This change in the leadership of our Organization \r\nis taking place at a moment of uncertainty and even \r\nconfusion about the role that the United Nations plays \r\nin today’s world. International public opinion demands \r\nthat the Security Council and other bodies of the \r\nOrganization do a much better job. We live at a time of \r\nalmost infinite opportunities, as well as unprecedented \r\nrisks. The United Nations, it is said, should be the \r\nforum, the instrument and the model allowing the \r\ninternational community to take advantage of those \r\nopportunities and to foresee and neutralize potential \r\nrisks. For those reasons, it is important to insist on the \r\nneed for in-depth reform of the Organization, and that \r\nwill undoubtedly be the main task and responsibility of \r\nour new Secretary-General. \r\n Nevertheless, while the new Secretary-General \r\nmust be ready and determined to introduce the \r\nnecessary changes, the Member Governments must \r\nalso demonstrate the political will to approve them. It \r\nis inconceivable that, although we have been debating \r\nreform of the Security Council for decades — I recall \r\nthat we began discussing that issue in the 1970s — \r\nproposing untold numbers of formulas and issuing \r\nreport after report on the item, that organ remains \r\nimmutable and impassive to its critics for its lack of \r\nrepresentativity and its diffident conduct in confronting \r\nthe world’s crises, such as the most recent crisis in the \r\nMiddle East. An equal affirmation may be made \r\nregarding other aspects of the Organization’s work.  \r\n Thus, the political resolve of States will emerge \r\nonly if all reform efforts are defined and implemented \r\non the basis of consensus. That has been the way in \r\nwhich the Organization has traditionally achieved its \r\ngreat successes of the past, which have enabled it to \r\nenjoy its current prestige and reputation. Let us all \r\npledge to work to achieve consensus in order to build \r\nthe bases for understanding and agreement that will \r\nenable us to advance down the road to reform. Our \r\nOrganization will thereby become the more effective \r\nmechanism for collective security and international \r\nsolidarity that all of us, from the powerful to the poor, \r\nso sorely need. \r\n We reiterate to our Secretary-General-designate, \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon, our most sincere congratulations \r\nand best wishes in the performance of the transcendent \r\nmission that we have entrusted to him. \r\n The President: I give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Liechtenstein, who will speak on \r\nbehalf of the Western European and other States. \r\n Mr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): I have the \r\nhonour and privilege today to address this Assembly on \r\nbehalf of the Group of Western European and Other \r\nStates on the occasion of the appointment of Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon as the Secretary-General of the United \r\nNations, starting 1 January 2007.  \r\n The Group of Western European and other States \r\nwarmly congratulates Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his election \r\nand welcomes him at the head of the Organization. As \r\nthe chief executive of this Organization, he has the \r\ntwofold task of working with Member States for the \r\nrealization of the purposes and principles of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, as well as of efficiently \r\nmanaging the Secretariat. That is a complex and \r\ndaunting challenge which requires active support from \r\nus, the Member States. The record and past \r\n A/61/PV.31\r\n \r\n7 06-56975 \r\n \r\nachievements of Mr. Ban give us confidence that he \r\npossesses the required skills to carry out both those \r\nfunctions efficiently and to steer the Organization \r\nthrough the tasks ahead. \r\n We look forward to the leadership of the \r\nSecretary-General-elect at a time when the challenges \r\nto the multilateral system are manifold and complex \r\nand when the need for a strong United Nations is more \r\nurgent than ever. At the same time, we realize that it is \r\nwe, the Member States, that are called upon to make \r\nthe right decisions for the future of the Organization \r\nand that close, constructive and productive cooperation \r\nbetween the Secretary-General-elect and the \r\nmembership is indispensable in order to maintain and \r\nstrengthen the place of the United Nations in the \r\ninternational system. We therefore owe such \r\ncooperation to the peoples that we represent and to the \r\nOrganization. \r\n We welcome the fact that the appointment of the \r\nnew Secretary-General is taking place well ahead of \r\nthe end of the tenure of Secretary-General Kofi Annan, \r\nand trust that the appointment today will ensure a \r\nsmooth transition and the necessary continuity in the \r\nwork of the United Nations. We also wish to emphasize \r\nthat we continue to count, until the very end of his \r\nterm, on the leadership of Secretary-General Kofi \r\nAnnan, which has served us so well over the past 10 \r\nyears. We will all have a separate opportunity to extend \r\nour deep gratitude for his long years of excellent \r\nservice to the United Nations and look forward to that \r\noccasion. \r\n The President: I give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of the United States, who will speak on \r\nbehalf of the host country. \r\n Mr. Bolton (United States of America): On \r\nbehalf of the United States, the host country of the \r\nUnited Nations, I would like to welcome the \r\nappointment of Foreign Minister Ban Ki-moon as the \r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations. The United \r\nStates has had the privilege to work with Foreign \r\nMinister Ban throughout his distinguished career in \r\nSeoul, in Washington, D.C., and here in New York.  \r\n We believe that he is the right person to lead the \r\nUnited Nations at this decisive moment in its history, \r\nparticularly as the United Nations struggles to fulfil the \r\nterms of the reform agenda that world leaders agreed to \r\nlast fall. It will be up to Foreign Minister Ban to lead \r\nus as we build upon and complete the modest steps of \r\nreform that we have achieved to date. It will be up to \r\nall Member States to work with him to reform the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n We encourage all Member States to give Foreign \r\nMinister Ban the support he needs to act decisively to \r\nstrengthen the United Nations, including during his \r\nfirst months, by shaping the Secretariat to meet the \r\nchallenges ahead. \r\n We are confident that Foreign Minister Ban will \r\nboth represent and instil the highest standards of \r\nintegrity within the United Nations system. We \r\ncongratulate him on his appointment. \r\n On behalf of the United States, I would also like \r\nto extend our appreciation to the other candidates for \r\nthis position — President Vike-Freiberga, Deputy \r\nPrime Minister Surakiart, Under-Secretary-General \r\nTharoor, Ambassador Dhanapala, Prince Zeid and \r\nAmbassador Ghani — and to the Member States that \r\nrecommended them for consideration. We respect their \r\ndeep commitment to bettering the United Nations and \r\ntheir continued leadership on world issues. \r\n I would also like to take this opportunity to \r\nexpress, on behalf of the United States, our deep \r\nappreciation to Secretary-General Annan for his \r\ntireless efforts during his many years of service to the \r\nUnited Nations, especially the past 10 as Secretary-\r\nGeneral. I would also like to express our appreciation \r\nfor the work of his top team of advisers, who will also \r\nbe moving on to new challenges. \r\n The President: I give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of South Africa, who will speak on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China. \r\n Mr. Kumalo (South Africa): On behalf of the \r\nGroup of 77 and China, I am honoured to extend our \r\ncongratulations to Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his election as \r\nthe Secretary-General of the United Nations, starting \r\n1 January 2007. The Group of 77 and China wishes to \r\nconvey our assurance to him of our support throughout \r\nhis term in office. \r\n The United Nations has weathered many storms \r\nover the past decades. The Organization has survived \r\nbecause of the stewardship of a long line of strong \r\nSecretaries-General who have always acted in the \r\ninterests of the Organization and remained neutral and \r\ncommitted to the ideals set out in the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations. We are encouraged by the assurances \r\nthat we have received from Mr. Ban Ki-moon that he \r\nA/61/PV.31  \r\n \r\n06-56975 8 \r\n \r\nintends to build on the foundation set by Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan and his predecessors. \r\n In 2000, the heads of State and Government \r\ncommitted themselves in the Millennium Declaration \r\nto making this Organization stronger so as to be able to \r\nrespond better to the many demands that we continue \r\nto place on it. Since then, we have made considerable \r\nprogress in meeting the ambitions of the people of the \r\nworld, especially the poor and the marginalized. \r\nHowever, a great deal remains to be done. \r\n The challenge for the new Secretary-General will \r\nbe to consolidate the progress made so far by ensuring \r\nthat the Secretariat implements the decisions and \r\nmandates of the Organization, thereby maintaining the \r\nmomentum we have built so far, and well into the \r\nfuture. \r\n The Group of 77 and China believes that the \r\ndevelopment agenda is an important pillar of this \r\nOrganization and one on which considerable effort is \r\nstill needed. It was therefore encouraging to us that \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon, prior to his election, committed \r\nhimself to advancing the internationally agreed \r\ndevelopment goals, including the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. I wish to assure him that the \r\nGroup of 77 and China will support his efforts as \r\nSecretary-General in strengthening the global \r\npartnership on development. \r\n The United Nations matters to us because it is \r\nlocated at the crossroads of the needs and desires of \r\nhumanity. Without the United Nations, many people \r\nthroughout the world would not have any hope for a \r\nbetter life. It is therefore in our interest to ensure that \r\nthe Organization be effective, well-managed and \r\naccountable to Member States. \r\n For that reason, it is imperative that the \r\nSecretary-General-elect act in the interests of the entire \r\nmembership and listen to the views of each and every \r\nMember State. It is also imperative that Member \r\nStates, in turn, “respect the exclusively international \r\ncharacter of the responsibilities of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the staff and not … seek to influence them \r\nin the discharge of their duties”, as stated in Article l00 \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations. \r\n Unlike at previous occasions, the General \r\nAssembly has elected the incoming Secretary-General \r\nwell before he is expected to assume his \r\nresponsibilities. We trust that the election of the \r\nSecretary-General in advance of his assuming office \r\nwill allow for sufficient consultations with Member \r\nStates and staff in order to prepare for the task ahead \r\nand ensure a smooth transition. \r\n It is indeed a pleasant irony that the decision of \r\nthe General Assembly to elect early the President of the \r\nAssembly and other office-bearers was one of the \r\nreforms undertaken at the time the Republic of Korea \r\noccupied the presidency of the General Assembly, in \r\nwhich Mr. Ban Ki-moon served as Chef de Cabinet. I \r\nmake that note for myself in case I should grow more \r\nambitious than I am now. \r\n In conclusion, allow me to take this opportunity \r\nto convey our warm wishes and congratulations to \r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan for his sterling service \r\nto the United Nations. The Organization and its \r\nmembership owe Kofi Annan a tremendous amount of \r\ngratitude and we will continue to support his efforts \r\nuntil his last day with this Organization. At the \r\nappropriate time, we will recall the contributions of \r\nMr. Annan to the Organization and pay tribute to him \r\nfor having kept faith with the poor and the \r\nmarginalized of the world despite all the pressures he \r\nfaced. For now, we wish once again to welcome \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon and wish him the best. \r\n The President: I give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Finland, who will speak on behalf of \r\nthe European Union. \r\n Ms. Lintonen (Finland): On behalf of the \r\nEuropean Union, I would like to express our warmest \r\ncongratulations to Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his \r\nappointment as the next Secretary-General of the \r\nUnited Nations. We are convinced that his personal \r\nskills and vast experience will enable him to \r\nsuccessfully lead the world Organization.  \r\n The European Union is a strong supporter of \r\neffective multilateralism and the United Nations at its \r\ncore. Mr. Ban Ki-moon can rely on our continued \r\nsupport for the world Organization and for him \r\npersonally as the new Secretary-General. I am \r\nconfident that, under his able leadership, the Member \r\nStates can work successfully together in promoting \r\npeace and security, development and human rights. He \r\nhas our full support in advancing the ongoing \r\ncomprehensive reform of the United Nations.  \r\n On behalf of the European Union, I want to wish \r\nhim every success in carrying out the important \r\n A/61/PV.31\r\n \r\n9 06-56975 \r\n \r\nresponsibilities of his future tasks as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations. We look forward to \r\nworking in close cooperation with him. He is very \r\nwelcome. \r\n The President: I now invite Mr. Ban Ki-moon, \r\nSecretary-General-designate, to make a statement. \r\n Mr. Ban Ki-moon: I stand before the members of \r\nthe General Assembly, deeply touched and inspired by \r\ntheir generous words of congratulation and \r\nencouragement. With boundless gratitude for the \r\nconfidence placed in me by the Member States, and \r\nwith an unswerving resolve to honour that trust, I \r\nhumbly accept the appointment as the eighth Secretary-\r\nGeneral of this great Organization, our United Nations. \r\nI wish to extend my deepest respect and appreciation to \r\nall the leaders and peoples of the Member States for \r\ntheir strong support. \r\n Thank you, Madam, for graciously preparing and \r\nguiding the meeting today. I greatly look forward to \r\nsupporting you and working with you as you wisely \r\nsteer the Assembly towards a very successful session. \r\n I follow in a line of remarkable leaders. They, \r\ntoo, faced this moment, each at a critical juncture in \r\nthe Organization\u0027s history. Like me today, they must \r\nhave pondered what the years ahead would hold at the \r\nhelm of this dynamic institution. Each made important \r\nand lasting contributions to our common enterprise in \r\nupholding humanity\u0027s deepest values and highest \r\naspirations. \r\n In particular, Secretary-General Kofi Annan has \r\nastutely guided our Organization into the twenty-first \r\ncentury. He has defined an ambitious agenda that has \r\nmade the United Nations truly indispensable to peace, \r\nprosperity and human dignity around the world. Our \r\ndebt to his courage and vision is immeasurable. I \r\nresolve to build upon his legacy. \r\n By completing the appointment of the next \r\nSecretary-General with such alacrity, the Members \r\nhave opened an unprecedented opportunity. Never \r\nbefore has an incoming Secretary-General been given \r\nsufficient time to prepare; they have given me more \r\nthan two months. I will use these weeks to consult \r\nwidely on how best to proceed with our common \r\nagenda of reform and revitalization. I will listen \r\nattentively to Member’s concerns, expectations and \r\nadmonitions. \r\n I am deeply honoured to become the second \r\nAsian to lead the Organization, following Mr. U Thant, \r\nwho ably served the world four decades ago. It is quite \r\nfitting that Members have now turned to Asia again for \r\nthe next Secretary-General to guide the United Nations \r\nsystem through its seventh decade. Asia is dynamic and \r\ndiverse, and Asia aspires to take on greater \r\nresponsibilities for the world. Having come so far and \r\nrising still, the region is living and shaping the full \r\nrange of achievements and challenges of our current \r\ntimes. \r\n Asia is also a region where modesty is a virtue, \r\nbut the modesty is about demeanour, not about vision \r\nand goals. It does not mean a lack of commitment or \r\nleadership. Rather, it is a quiet determination in action \r\nto get things done without so much fanfare. That may \r\nbe the key to Asia\u0027s success and to the United Nations \r\nfuture. Indeed, our Organization is modest in its means, \r\nbut not in its values. We should be more modest in our \r\nwords, but not in our performance. The true measure of \r\nsuccess for the United Nations is not how much we \r\npromise, but how much we deliver for those who need \r\nus most. Given the enduring purposes and inspiring \r\nprinciples of our Organization, we need not shout its \r\npraises or preach its virtues. We simply need to live \r\nthem every day, step by step, programme by \r\nprogramme, mandate by mandate. \r\n The surge in demand for the United Nations \r\nservices attests not only to the United Nations abiding \r\nrelevance, but also to its central place in advancing \r\nhuman dignity. The United Nations is needed now \r\nmore than ever before. The United Nations core \r\nmission in the previous century was to keep countries \r\nfrom fighting each other. In the new century, the \r\ndefining mandate is to strengthen the inter-State system \r\nso that humanity may be better served amidst new \r\nchallenges. From the Balkans to Africa, from Asia to \r\nthe Middle East, we have witnessed the weakening or \r\nabsence of effective governance, leading to the \r\nravaging of human rights and the abandonment of \r\nlong-standing humanitarian principles. We need \r\ncompetent and responsible States to meet the needs of \r\n\"we the peoples\" for whom the United Nations was \r\ncreated; and the world\u0027s peoples will not be fully \r\nserved unless peace, development and human rights — \r\nthe three pillars of the United Nations — are advanced \r\ntogether with equal vigour. \r\n The road that we must pave towards a world of \r\npeace, prosperity and dignity for all has many pitfalls. \r\nA/61/PV.31  \r\n \r\n06-56975 10 \r\n \r\nAs Secretary-General, I will make the most of the \r\nauthority invested in my Office by the Charter and the \r\nmandate the Members give me. I will work diligently \r\nto materialize our responsibility to protect the most \r\nvulnerable members of humanity and for the peaceful \r\nresolution of threats to international security and \r\nregional stability. \r\n In order to meet those growing mandates and \r\nexpectations, we have engaged in the most sweeping \r\nreform in the history of the Organization. The very \r\nscope of the reform has taxed the attention and \r\nenergies of both the delegations and the Secretariat, but \r\nwe must stay the course. We need to muster the human, \r\ninstitutional and intellectual resources, and to organize \r\nthem properly. We should do our part in meeting the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, the expanding peace \r\noperations, the threats posed by terrorism, the \r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, \r\nHIV/AIDS and other pandemics, environmental \r\ndegradation, and the imperatives of human rights. \r\n Let us remember that we reform not to please \r\nothers, but because we value what this Organization \r\nstands for. We must reform because we believe in its \r\nfuture. To revitalize our common endeavour is to renew \r\nour faith not only in the United Nations programmes \r\nand purposes, but also in each other. We should \r\ndemand more of ourselves, as well as of our \r\nOrganization. To cut through the fog of mistrust is \r\ngoing to require more intensive dialogue. We cannot \r\nchange everything at once, but if we choose wisely and \r\nwork together transparently, flexibly and honestly, \r\nprogress in a few areas will lead to progress in many \r\nmore. Only the Member States can revitalize this \r\nOrganization, but I will always be there to assist and \r\nfacilitate as needed. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n As Secretary-General, I am resolved to manage \r\nmy Office openly and responsibly. I will seek to build \r\nconsensus through a free exchange of ideas and \r\ncritiques. Only through the candid, open testing of \r\nideas and proposals can we identify better means of \r\nserving the peoples of the world. I will work actively \r\nin reaching out to all stakeholders. In particular, in \r\norder to bring the United Nations closer to the people, I \r\nwill widely engage civil society in dialogue. I will seek \r\nthe support and input of humanitarian advocacy \r\ngroups, businesses and other constituents of the global \r\ncitizenry for the good of the Organization. My tenure \r\nwill be marked by ceaseless efforts to build bridges and \r\nclose divides. Leadership of harmony, not division, and \r\nby example, not instruction, has served me well so far. \r\nI intend to stay the course as Secretary-General. \r\n I will be fully accountable for the management of \r\nthis institution. Member States set the mandates and \r\nprovide the resources. If the resources are not \r\nsufficient for the task at hand, I will not be shy about \r\nsaying so, but once we in the Secretariat have taken on \r\na task, we must accept full responsibility for its \r\nachievement. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n I am eager to join the ranks of the world’s \r\npremier Secretariat. I have deep respect and admiration \r\nfor the able, dedicated and courageous men and women \r\nwho serve this Organization day in and day out, often \r\nin the face of danger and personal sacrifice. To them, I \r\npledge my utmost support, dedication and solidarity. \r\n Maintaining their proud heritage, while \r\nvigorously holding them to the highest standards of \r\nprofessionalism and integrity, will be a prime goal of \r\nmy tenure. The aim of Secretariat reform is not to \r\npenalize but to reward, so that their talent and skill, \r\nexperience and dedication may be fully mobilized and \r\nproperly utilized. It will reward hard work and \r\nexcellence to boost morale, making everyone \r\naccountable for his or her own action or inaction, and \r\npushing for greater gender balance, in particular at \r\nsenior levels. \r\n That will be my guide as I rally the Secretariat \r\nstaff for our very best performance in serving the \r\nOrganization. As Secretary-General, I am far from \r\nperfect, and I will need the unsparing support, \r\ncooperation and trust of all represented here, but I \r\npledge to serve them well, with all of my heart and to \r\nthe best of my abilities. I will seek excellence with \r\nhumility. I will lead by example. Promises should be \r\nmade for the keeping. That has been my motto in life. I \r\nintend to stick to it as I work with all stakeholders for a \r\nUnited Nations that delivers on its promises. \r\n My heart is overflowing with gratitude towards \r\nmy country and people who have sent me here to serve. \r\nIt has been a long journey from my youth in war-torn \r\nand destitute Korea to this rostrum and these awesome \r\nresponsibilities. I was able to make the journey because \r\nthe United Nations was with my people in our darkest \r\ndays. It gave us hope and sustenance, security and \r\n A/61/PV.31\r\n \r\n11 06-56975 \r\n \r\ndignity. It showed us a better way. So I feel at home \r\ntoday, however many miles and years I have travelled. \r\n For the Korean people, the United Nations flag \r\nwas and remains a beacon of better days to come. \r\nThere are countless stories of that faith. One belongs to \r\nme. In 1956, when the cold war was raging around the \r\nworld, as a young boy of just 12 I was chosen to read \r\nout a public message on behalf of my elementary \r\nschool, addressed to the Secretary-General of the \r\nUnited Nations, Mr. Dag Hammarskjöld. We urged him \r\nto help the people of a certain faraway European \r\ncountry in their fight for freedom and democracy. I \r\nhardly understood the deeper meaning of the message, \r\nbut I knew that the United Nations was there for help \r\nin times of need. \r\n Fifty years later, the world is a much more \r\ncomplex place, and there are many more actors to turn \r\nto. During these years, I have travelled many times  \r\n \r\naround the world. I have been elated by the successes \r\nof the United Nations in making life better for \r\ncountless people. I have also been pained by scenes of \r\nits failures. In too many places, I could feel the dismay \r\nover inaction of the United Nations or action that was \r\ntoo little or came too late. I am determined to dispel \r\nthe disillusionment. \r\n I earnestly hope that young boys and girls of \r\ntoday will grow up knowing that the United Nations is \r\nworking hard to build a better future for them. As \r\nSecretary-General, I will embrace their hopes and hear \r\ntheir appeals. I am an optimist, and I am full of hope \r\nabout the future of our global Organization. Let us \r\nwork together for a United Nations that can deliver \r\nmore and better. \r\n The President: The General Assembly has thus \r\nconcluded this stage of its consideration of agenda \r\nitem 104. \r\n The meeting rose at 4.25 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\n"
