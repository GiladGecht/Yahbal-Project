(Bahrain) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nProgramme of work \r\n The President: I should like to draw the \r\nattention of the members of the General Assembly to \r\ndocument A/INF/61/4/Rev.1, which contains the \r\nrevised programme of work and schedule of plenary \r\nmeetings for the months of October, November and \r\nDecember 2006, and which has been distributed desk \r\nto desk. \r\n I would like to remind members that the list of \r\nspeakers for items listed in document \r\nA/INF/61/4/Rev.1 are open. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 103 \r\nElections to fill vacancies in principal organs \r\n(a) Election of five non-permanent members of the \r\nSecurity Council \r\n The President: The General Assembly will now \r\nproceed to the election of five non-permanent members \r\nof the Security Council to replace those members \r\nwhose term of office expires on 31 December 2006. \r\n The five outgoing non-permanent members are \r\nthe following: Argentina, Denmark, Greece, Japan and \r\nthe United Republic of Tanzania. Those five States \r\ncannot be re-elected. Their names, therefore, should \r\nnot appear on the ballot papers. \r\n Apart from the five permanent members, the \r\nSecurity Council will include in the year 2007 the \r\nfollowing States: the Congo, Ghana, Peru, Qatar and \r\nSlovakia. The names of those States, therefore, should \r\nalso not appear on the ballot papers. \r\n Of the five non-permanent members that will \r\nremain in office in the year 2007, three are from Africa \r\nand Asia, one is from Eastern Europe and one is from \r\nLatin America and the Caribbean. \r\n Consequently, pursuant to paragraph 3 of General \r\nAssembly resolution 1991 A (XVIII), of 17 December \r\n1963, the five non-permanent members should be \r\nelected according to the following pattern: two from \r\nAfrica and Asia, one from Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean and two from Western Europe and other \r\nStates. The ballot papers reflect that pattern. \r\n In accordance with established practice, there is \r\nan understanding to the effect that, of the two States to \r\nbe elected from Africa and Asia, one should be from \r\nAfrica and one from Asia. \r\n I should like to inform the Assembly that those \r\ncandidates, their number not exceeding the number of \r\nseats to be filled, receiving the greatest number of \r\nvotes and a two-thirds majority of those present and \r\nvoting will be declared elected. In the case of a tie vote \r\nfor a remaining seat, there will be a restricted ballot \r\nlimited to those candidates that have obtained an equal \r\nnumber of votes. \r\n May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to \r\nthat procedure? \r\n It was so decided. \r\nA/61/PV.32 \r\n \r\n 2 \r\n \r\n The President: In accordance with rule 92 of the \r\nrules of procedure, the election shall be held by secret \r\nballot and there shall be no nominations. \r\n Regarding candidatures, I have been informed by \r\nthe Chairpersons of the respective regional groups of \r\nthe following. For the two vacant seats from among the \r\nAfrican and Asian States, there are three candidates, \r\nnamely, Indonesia, Nepal and South Africa. Of those \r\nthree candidates, South Africa is an endorsed \r\ncandidate. For the one vacant seat from among the \r\nLatin America and Caribbean States, there are two \r\ncandidates, namely, Guatemala and the Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela. For the two vacant seats from \r\namong the Western European and other States, there \r\nare two endorsed candidates, namely, Belgium and \r\nItaly. \r\n In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of \r\nprocedure, we shall now proceed to the election by \r\nsecret ballot. \r\n Before we begin the voting process, I should like \r\nto remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the \r\nrules of procedure of the General Assembly, no \r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting except on a \r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the voting. \r\n We shall now begin the voting process. \r\n Ballot papers marked “A”, “B” and “C” will now \r\nbe distributed. I request representatives to use only \r\nthose ballot papers that have been distributed. \r\n May I ask representatives to write on the ballot \r\npapers marked “A”, for the African and Asian States, \r\nthe names of the two States for which they wish to \r\nvote; on the ballot papers marked “B”, for the Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean States, the name of the one \r\nState for which they wish to vote; and on the ballot \r\npapers marked “C”, for the Western European and \r\nother States, the name of the two States for which they \r\nwish to vote. \r\n A ballot paper containing more names from the \r\nrelevant region than the number of seats assigned to it \r\nwill be declared invalid. If a ballot paper contains \r\nnames of Member States which do not belong to that \r\nregion, those names will not be counted at all. \r\n At the invitation of the President, Mrs. Ismi \r\n(Brunei Darussalam), Mr. Sepúlveda (Chile),  \r\nMs. Ábrahám Nagyi (Hungary), Mrs. Cerere \r\n(Kenya) and Mr. Flueck (Switzerland) acted as \r\ntellers. \r\n A vote was taken by secret ballot. \r\n The meeting was suspended at 10.35 a.m. and \r\nresumed at 11.45 a.m.  \r\n The President: The result of the voting is as \r\nfollows: \r\n Group A — African and Asian States \r\n Number of ballot papers:    192 \r\n Number of invalid ballots:        0 \r\n Number of valid ballots:    192 \r\n Abstentions:          0 \r\n Required two-thirds majority:   128 \r\n Number of votes obtained: \r\n  South Africa     186 \r\n  Indonesia      158 \r\n  Nepal        28 \r\n Group B — Latin American and Caribbean States \r\n Number of ballot papers:    192\r\n Number of invalid ballots:        0 \r\n Number of valid ballots:    192 \r\n Abstentions:          7 \r\n Required two-thirds majority:   124 \r\n Number of votes obtained: \r\n  Guatemala      109 \r\n  Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)   76 \r\n Group C — Western European and other States \r\n Number of ballot papers:    192 \r\n Number of invalid ballots:        0 \r\n Number of valid ballots:    192 \r\n Abstentions:          3 \r\n Required two-thirds majority:    126 \r\n Number of votes obtained: \r\n  Italy       186 \r\n  Belgium      180 \r\n Having obtained the required two-thirds majority, \r\nthe following States were elected members of the \r\nSecurity Council for a two-year term beginning \r\n1 January 2007: Belgium, Indonesia, Italy and \r\nSouth Africa. \r\n The President: There remains one seat to be \r\nfilled from among the Latin American and Caribbean \r\nStates. \r\n We shall therefore proceed to the first restricted \r\nballot. \r\nA/61/PV.32\r\n \r\n3  \r\n \r\n The second round of balloting shall be restricted \r\nto the two States from among the Latin American and \r\nCaribbean States that were not elected but that \r\nobtained the largest number of votes in the previous \r\nballot, namely, Guatemala and the Bolivarian Republic \r\nof Venezuela. That is in accordance with rule 94 of the \r\nrules of procedure. \r\n Before we begin the voting process, I should like \r\nto remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the \r\nrules of procedure of the General Assembly, no \r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting except on a \r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the voting. \r\n We shall now begin the voting process. \r\n Ballot papers marked “B” will now be \r\ndistributed. May I ask representatives to write on the \r\nballot papers the name of the State for which they wish \r\nto vote. \r\n Ballot papers marked “B” for the Latin America \r\nand Caribbean States will be declared invalid if they \r\ncontain the name of a State other than Guatemala or the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela, as well as if they \r\ncontain the names of more than one State. \r\n At the invitation of the President, Mrs. Ismi \r\n(Brunei Darussalam), Mr. Sepúlveda (Chile), \r\nMs. Ábrahám Nagyi (Hungary), Mrs. Cerere \r\n(Kenya) and Mr. Flueck (Switzerland) acted as \r\ntellers. \r\n A vote was taken by secret ballot. \r\n  The meeting was suspended at 11.55 a.m. and \r\nresumed at 12.25 p.m. \r\n \r\n The President: The result of the voting is as \r\nfollows: \r\n Group B — Latin American and Caribbean States \r\n Number of ballot papers:    192 \r\n Number of invalid ballots:        0 \r\n Number of valid ballots:    192 \r\n Abstentions:          4 \r\n Required two-thirds majority:   126 \r\n Number of votes obtained: \r\n  Guatemala      114 \r\n  Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)   74 \r\n Since no candidate obtained the required two-\r\nthirds majority, there remains one seat to be filled from \r\namong the Latin American and Caribbean States. \r\n We shall therefore proceed to the second \r\nrestricted ballot. \r\n The third round of balloting shall be restricted to \r\nthe two States from among the Latin American and \r\nCaribbean States that were not elected but that \r\nobtained the largest number of votes in the previous \r\nballot, namely, Guatemala and the Bolivarian Republic \r\nof Venezuela.
