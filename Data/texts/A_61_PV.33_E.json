(Bahrain) \r\n \r\n \r\n The meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 103 (continued) \r\nElections to fill vacancies in principal organs \r\n(a) Election of five non-permanent members of the \r\nSecurity Council \r\n The President: The General Assembly will continue \r\nwith the election of five non-permanent members of the \r\nSecurity Council to replace those members whose term of \r\noffice expires on 31 December 2006. \r\n As members will recall, when the 32nd plenary \r\nmeeting was adjourned earlier today, there still \r\nremained one seat from among the Latin American and \r\nCaribbean States to be filled.  \r\n In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of \r\nprocedure, we shall proceed now to the next round of \r\nballoting by secret ballot.  \r\n This fifth round of balloting, which is in \r\naccordance with rule 94 of the rules of procedure, will \r\nalso be the third unrestricted ballot.  \r\n May I remind the Assembly that any Member \r\nState from among the Latin American and Caribbean \r\nStates may be a candidate except those outgoing \r\nmembers and those already members of the Security \r\nCouncil. To make this clear, I shall mention the names \r\nof those members which cannot be voted for in the \r\npresent balloting, namely, Argentina and Peru. \r\n Before we begin the voting process, I should like \r\nto remind members that pursuant to rule 88 of the rules \r\nof procedure of the General Assembly, no \r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting except on a \r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the voting. \r\n We shall now begin the voting process. \r\n Ballot papers marked “B” will now be \r\ndistributed. May I ask representatives to write on the \r\nballot papers marked “B” for the Latin American and \r\nCaribbean States the name of the one State for which \r\nthey wish to vote. Ballot papers marked “B” will be \r\ndeclared invalid if they contain the name of more than \r\none State. \r\n If a ballot paper contains the name of a Member \r\nState which does not belong to that region, that name \r\nwill not be counted at all.  \r\n At the invitation of the President, Mrs. Ismi \r\n(Brunei Darussalam), Mr. Sepúlveda (Chile), \r\nMs. Nagy (Hungary), Ms. Cerere (Kenya) and \r\nMr. Flueck (Switzerland) acted as tellers. \r\n A vote was taken by secret ballot. \r\n The meeting was suspended at 3.20 p.m. and \r\nresumed at 3.45 p.m. \r\n The President: The result of the voting is as \r\nfollows: \r\n Group B — Latin American and Caribbean States \r\n(1 seat) \r\nNumber of ballot papers:    192 \r\nA/61/PV.33  \r\n \r\n06-57454 2 \r\n \r\nNumber of invalid ballots:        0 \r\nNumber of valid ballots:    192 \r\nAbstentions:            5 \r\nRequired two-thirds majority:   125 \r\nVotes obtained: \r\n Guatemala      103 \r\n Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)   83 \r\n Mexico          1 \r\n Since the result of the ballot has been inconclusive, \r\nthere still remains one seat to be filled from among the \r\nLatin American and Caribbean States. We must therefore \r\nproceed to a second unrestricted ballot.  \r\n For this sixth round of balloting, may I remind \r\nthe Assembly that any Member State from among the \r\nLatin American and Caribbean States may be a \r\ncandidate except those outgoing members and those \r\nalready members of the Security Council. To make this \r\nclear, I shall mention the names of those members \r\nwhich cannot be voted for in the present balloting, \r\nnamely, Argentina and Peru. \r\n Before we begin the voting process, I should like \r\nto remind members that pursuant to rule 88 of the rules \r\nof procedure of the General Assembly, no \r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting except on a \r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the voting.  \r\n Members are requested to remain seated until all \r\nballots have been collected. \r\n We shall now begin the voting process. \r\n Ballot papers marked “B” will now be \r\ndistributed.
