Members \r\nare requested to remain seated until all ballots have \r\nbeen collected. \r\n Ballot papers marked “B” will now be \r\ndistributed. May I ask representatives to write on the \r\nballot papers marked “B” for the Latin American and \r\nCaribbean States the name of the one State for which \r\nthey wish to vote. Ballot papers marked “B” will be \r\ndeclared invalid if they contain the name of more than \r\none State. If a ballot paper contains the name of a \r\nMember State which does not belong to that region, \r\nthat ballot will be declared invalid. \r\n At the invitation of the President, Mrs. Ismi \r\n(Brunei Darussalam), Mr. Sepúlveda (Chile), \r\nMrs. Cerere (Kenya), Mr. Flueck (Switzerland) \r\nand Ms. Dinevska (The former Yugoslav Republic \r\nof Macedonia) acted as tellers. \r\n A vote was taken by secret ballot. \r\n The meeting was suspended at 10.25 a.m. and \r\nresumed at 10.45 a.m. \r\n The President: The result of the voting is as \r\nfollows: \r\n Group B — Latin American and Caribbean States \r\nNumber of ballot papers: 191 \r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0 \r\nNumber of valid ballots: 191 \r\nA/61/PV.34  \r\n \r\n06-57418 2 \r\n \r\nAbstentions: 8 \r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 122 \r\nNumber of votes obtained:  \r\n Guatemala 107 \r\n Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) 76 \r\n Since the result of the ballot has been \r\ninconclusive, there still remains one seat to be filled \r\nfrom among the Latin American and Caribbean States. \r\nWe must therefore proceed to a fifth unrestricted ballot. \r\n For this twelfth round of balloting, may I remind \r\nthe Assembly that any Member State from among the \r\nLatin American and Caribbean States may be a \r\ncandidate except those outgoing members and those \r\nalready members of the Security Council, namely, \r\nArgentina and Peru. \r\n Before we begin the voting process, I should like \r\nto remind members that pursuant to rule 88 of the rules \r\nof procedure of the General Assembly, no \r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting except on a \r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the voting. \r\n We shall now begin the voting process.
