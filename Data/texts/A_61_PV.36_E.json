(Bahrain) \r\n \r\n \r\n  In the absence of the President, Mr. Baja \r\n(Philippines), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 103 (continued) \r\n \r\nElections to fill vacancies in principal organs \r\n \r\n (a) Election of five non-permanent members of the \r\nSecurity Council \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The General Assembly \r\nwill now proceed to the election of five non-permanent \r\nmembers of the Security Council to replace those \r\nmembers whose term of office expires on 31 December \r\n2006. \r\n As members will recall, when the 35th plenary \r\nmeeting was adjourned, on Tuesday afternoon, \r\n17 October 2006, there remained one seat from among \r\nthe Latin American and Caribbean States to be filled. \r\nIn accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, \r\nwe shall now proceed to the next round of balloting by \r\nsecret ballot. This twenty-third round of balloting will, \r\nin accordance with rule 94 of the rules of procedure, \r\nalso be the tenth unrestricted ballot. \r\n I call on the representative of Egypt on a point of \r\norder. \r\n Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt): I have a procedural \r\nquestion before we begin the balloting. We would like \r\nto propose that we establish some kind of a timeframe \r\nfor the voting process, because we have committee \r\nmeetings and other engagements and matters to attend \r\nto. With its indulgence, therefore, we would ask the \r\npresidency to clarify, before the end of the day, how \r\nthe process will be structured — without, of course, \r\ngetting into substantive questions regarding \r\ncandidatures and so on. We have other committee work \r\nand engagements. My proposal, therefore, is to devote \r\ntwo or three days per week to this issue. I also propose \r\nthat the General Assembly take into consideration the \r\nId al-Fitr holiday, and not schedule any votes on \r\nMonday and Tuesday. \r\n The Acting President: The presidency will take \r\ninto account the comments of the Ambassador of \r\nEgypt. \r\n For the twenty-third round of balloting, may I \r\nremind the Assembly that any Member State from \r\namong the Group of Latin American and Caribbean \r\nStates may be a candidate, except those out-going \r\nmembers and those already members of the Security \r\nCouncil, namely, Argentina and Peru. \r\n Before we begin the voting process, I should like \r\nto remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the \r\nrules of procedure of the General Assembly, no \r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting except on a \r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the voting. \r\nMembers are requested to remain seated until all \r\nballots have been collected.  \r\n We shall now begin the voting process. \r\n Ballot papers marked “B” will now be \r\ndistributed. May I ask representatives to write on the \r\nballot papers marked “B”, for the Latin American and \r\nA/61/PV.36  \r\n \r\n06-57836 2 \r\n \r\nCaribbean States, the name of one State for which they \r\nwish to vote. Ballot papers marked “B” will be \r\ndeclared invalid if they contain the name of more than \r\none State. If a ballot paper contains the name of a \r\nMember State that does not belong to that region, that \r\nballot will be declared invalid. \r\n At the invitation of the Acting President, \r\nMr. Jumat (Brunei Darussalam), Mr. Sepúlveda \r\n(Chile), Mrs. Cerere (Kenya), Mr. Flueck \r\n(Switzerland) and Ms. Dinevska (the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia) acted as tellers. \r\n A vote was taken by secret ballot. \r\n The meeting was suspended at 10.20 a.m. and \r\nresumed at 10.40 a.m. \r\n The Acting President: The result of the voting is \r\nas follows: \r\n Group B – Latin American and Caribbean States \r\nNumber of ballot papers:   190 \r\nNumber of invalid ballots:   0 \r\nNumber of valid ballots:   190 \r\nAbstentions:     5 \r\nRequired two-thirds majority:  124 \r\nVotes obtained: \r\n Guatemala     108 \r\n Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) 77 \r\n Since the result of this ballot has again been \r\ninconclusive, there still remains one seat to be filled \r\nfrom among the Latin American and Caribbean States. \r\nWe must therefore proceed to the eleventh unrestricted \r\nballot. \r\n For the twenty-fourth round of balloting, may I \r\nremind the Assembly that any Member State from \r\namong the Latin American and Caribbean States may \r\nbe a candidate, except those outgoing members and \r\nthose already members of the Security Council, \r\nnamely, Argentina and Peru.  \r\n Before we begin the voting process, I should like \r\nto remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the \r\nrules of procedure of the General Assembly, no \r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting except on a \r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the voting.  \r\n We shall now begin the voting process.

In accordance with the rules of \r\nprocedure, we should continue with a series of \r\nunrestricted ballots. However, in view of the lateness \r\nof the hour, I propose that we postpone further \r\nballoting until 3 p.m. this afternoon.
