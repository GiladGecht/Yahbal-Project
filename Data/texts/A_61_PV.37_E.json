(Bahrain) \r\n \r\n \r\n The meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 103 (continued) \r\n \r\n \r\nElections to fill vacancies in principal organs \r\n \r\n \r\n (a) Election of five non-permanent members of the \r\nSecurity Council \r\n \r\n The President: The General Assembly will \r\ncontinue with the election of five non-permanent \r\nmembers of the Security Council to replace those \r\nmembers whose term of office expires on 31 December \r\n2006. \r\n As members will recall, when the 36th plenary \r\nmeeting was adjourned earlier today, there still \r\nremained one seat from among the Latin American and \r\nCaribbean States to be filled. \r\n In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of \r\nprocedure, we shall now proceed to the next round of \r\nballoting by secret ballot. \r\n This thirtieth round of balloting, in accordance \r\nwith rule 94 of the rules of procedure, will also be the \r\nfourteenth unrestricted ballot. \r\n For this thirtieth round of balloting, may I remind \r\nthe Assembly that any Member State from among the \r\nLatin American and Caribbean States may be a \r\ncandidate except those outgoing members and those \r\nalready members of the Security Council, namely \r\nArgentina and Peru. \r\n We shall now begin the voting process. \r\n Members are requested to remain seated until all \r\nballots have been collected. \r\n Ballot papers marked “B” will now be \r\ndistributed. May I ask representatives to write on the \r\nballot papers marked “B” for the Latin American and \r\nCaribbean States the name of one State for which they \r\nwish to vote. Ballot papers marked “B” will be \r\ndeclared invalid if they contain the name of more than \r\none State. \r\n If a ballot paper contains the name of a Member \r\nState which does not belong to that region, that ballot \r\nwill be declared invalid. \r\n At the invitation of the President, Mr. Jumat \r\n(Brunei Darussalam), Mr. Sepúlveda (Chile), \r\nMrs. Cerere (Kenya), Mr. Flueck (Switzerland) \r\nand Ms. Dinevska (The former Yugoslav Republic \r\nof Macedonia) acted as tellers. \r\n A vote was taken by secret ballot. \r\n The meeting was suspended at 3.15 p.m. and \r\nresumed at 3.30 p.m. \r\n The President: The result of the voting is as \r\nfollows: \r\n Group B — Latin American and Caribbean States \r\n Number of ballot papers:    192 \r\n Number of invalid ballots:     0 \r\n Number of valid ballots:   192 \r\n Abstentions:      7 \r\nA/61/PV.37  \r\n \r\n06-57957 2 \r\n \r\n Required two-thirds majority:   124  \r\n Number of votes obtained:   \r\n  Guatemala      107 \r\n  Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)  77 \r\n  Bolivia      1  \r\n Since the result of the ballot has again been \r\ninconclusive, there still remains one seat to be filled \r\nfrom among the Latin American and Caribbean States. \r\nWe must therefore proceed to the fifteenth unrestricted \r\nballot. \r\n For this thirty-first round of balloting, may I \r\nremind the Assembly that any Member State from \r\namong the Latin American and Caribbean States may \r\nbe a candidate except those outgoing members and \r\nthose already members of the Security Council, namely \r\nArgentina and Peru. \r\n Before we begin the voting process, I should like \r\nto remind members that pursuant to rule 88 of the rules \r\nof procedure of the General Assembly, no \r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting except on a \r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the voting. \r\n We shall now begin the voting process. \r\n Members are requested to remain seated until all \r\nballots have been collected. \r\n Ballot papers marked “B” will now be \r\ndistributed.
