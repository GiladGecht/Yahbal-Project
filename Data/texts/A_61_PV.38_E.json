(Bahrain) \r\n \r\n \r\n The meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 7 (continued) \r\n \r\nOrganization of work, adoption of the agenda and \r\nallocation of items \r\n \r\n  Second report of the General Committee \r\n(A/61/250/Add.1) \r\n \r\n The President: In paragraph 1 (a) of its report \r\n(A/61/250/Add.1), the General Committee \r\nrecommends to the General Assembly that an \r\nadditional item, entitled “Commemoration of the two-\r\nhundredth anniversary of the abolition of the trans-\r\nAtlantic slave trade”, be included in the agenda of the \r\ncurrent session under heading I, “Organizational, \r\nadministrative and other matter”. \r\n May I take it that the General Assembly decides \r\nto include this item in the agenda of the current session \r\nunder heading I? \r\n It was so decided.  \r\n The President: In paragraph 1 (b), the General \r\nCommittee further recommends that the item be \r\nconsidered directly in plenary meeting.  \r\n May I take it that the General Assembly decides \r\nto consider this item directly in plenary meeting? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President: I should like to inform members \r\nthat the item entitled “Commemoration of the two-\r\nhundredth anniversary of the abolition of the trans-\r\nAtlantic slave trade” becomes item 155 on the agenda \r\nof the current session.  \r\n In paragraph 2 (a) of the same report, the General \r\nCommittee recommends to the General Assembly that \r\nan additional item, entitled “Extension of the terms of \r\nthe ad litem judges of the International Criminal \r\nTribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for \r\nGenocide and Other Serious Violations of International \r\nHumanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of \r\nRwanda and Rwandan Citizens Responsible for \r\nGenocide and Other Such Violations Committed in the \r\nTerritory of Neighbouring States between 1 January \r\nand 31 December 1994”, be included in the agenda of \r\nthe current session under heading I, “Organizational, \r\nadministrative and other matters”. \r\n May I take it that the General Assembly decides \r\nto include this item in the agenda of the current session \r\nunder heading I? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President: In paragraph 2 (b), the General \r\nCommittee further recommends that the item be \r\nconsidered directly in plenary meeting.  \r\n May I take it that the General Assembly decides \r\nto consider the item directly in plenary meeting? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President: I should like to inform members \r\nthat the item entitled “Extension of the terms of the ad \r\nlitem judges of the International Criminal Tribunal for \r\nthe Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Genocide \r\nA/61/PV.38  \r\n \r\n06-58069 2 \r\n \r\nand Other Serious Violations of International \r\nHumanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of \r\nRwanda and Rwandan Citizens Responsible for \r\nGenocide and Other Such Violations Committed in the \r\nTerritory of Neighbouring States between 1 January \r\nand 31 December 1994” becomes item 156 on the \r\nagenda of the current session.  \r\n The General Assembly has thus concluded the \r\nconsideration of the second report of the General \r\nCommittee.  \r\n Before proceeding further, I would like to make \r\nan announcement concerning agenda item 105 (c) on \r\nthe election of the members of the United Nations \r\nInternational Law Commission, which has been \r\nscheduled to take place on Thursday 16 November \r\n2006. In order to facilitate the election, and in \r\naccordance with the established practice, the General \r\nAssembly will take an advance decision on the matter \r\nof requesting the Secretariat to issue a consolidated list \r\nof candidates reflecting all submissions and changes \r\nreceived so far. It is my intention to consult the \r\nAssembly in this regard on Thursday afternoon, \r\n22 October 2006.  \r\n \r\nAgenda item 108  \r\n \r\nCooperation between the United Nations and \r\nregional and other organizations  \r\n \r\n (a) Cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe African Union \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/61/256) \r\n \r\n (b) Cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe Asian-African Legal Consultative \r\nOrganization \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General \r\n(A/61/256/Add.1) \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/61/L.5) \r\n \r\n (c) Cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/61/256) \r\n \r\n (d) Cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe Black Sea Economic Cooperation \r\nOrganization \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/61/256) \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/61/L.4) \r\n \r\n (e) Cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe Caribbean Community \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/61/256) \r\n \r\n (f) Cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe Community of Portuguese-speaking \r\nCountries \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/61/256) \r\n \r\n (g) Cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe Council of Europe \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/61/256) \r\n \r\n (h) Cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe Economic Community of Central African \r\nStates \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/61/256) \r\n \r\n (i) Cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe Economic Cooperation Organization \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/61/256) \r\n \r\n (j) Cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe International Organization of la \r\nFrancophonie \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/61/256) \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/61/L.7) \r\n \r\n (k) Cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe Inter-Parliamentary Union \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/61/256) \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/61/L.6) \r\n \r\n (l) Cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe Latin American Economic System \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General \r\n(A/61/256/Add.1) \r\n \r\n (m) Cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe League of Arab States \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/61/256) \r\n \r\n (n) Cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe Organization for the Prohibition of \r\nChemical Weapons \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/61/256) \r\n \r\n A/61/PV.38\r\n \r\n3 06-58069 \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/61/185) \r\n \r\n (o) Cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation \r\nin Europe \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/61/256) \r\n \r\n (p) Cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe Organization of American States \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/61/256) \r\n \r\n (q) Cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/61/256) \r\n \r\n (r) Cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe Pacific Islands Forum \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/61/256) \r\n \r\n (s) Cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe Preparatory Commission for the \r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty \r\nOrganization \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/61/256) \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/61/184) \r\n \r\n (t) Cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe Southern African Development Community \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/61/256) \r\n \r\n The President: I give the floor to the Executive-\r\nSecretary of the Preparatory Commission for the \r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization, \r\nMr. Tibor Tóth, to present the report of the Preparatory \r\nCommission.  \r\n Mr. Tóth (Preparatory Commission for  \r\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty \r\nOrganization): I am pleased to report on the activities \r\nof the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive \r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO). The \r\npromise of this Treaty, as one of the cornerstones of the \r\ninternational non-proliferation and disarmament \r\nregime, is the total ban of any nuclear explosion in any \r\nenvironment. My address to the General Assembly \r\ncoincides, however, with a disquieting situation that is \r\na strong reminder of the importance of the \r\nComprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). \r\n The announcement by the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea that it had conducted a nuclear test \r\non 9 October 2006 resulted in global expressions of \r\nconcern and condemnation with regard to this \r\nirresponsible act. Such a strong reaction of the \r\ninternational community is important and encouraging. \r\nIt demonstrates how much the international community \r\ncares about the nuclear test ban. \r\n On the occasion of a special session of the \r\nPreparatory Commission on 13 October 2006, the \r\nStates signatories to the CTBT expressed their deep \r\nconcern and regret over the test. I share those \r\nsentiments. Such an action goes against the letter and \r\nspirit of the CTBT, which I continue to hope the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea will sign and \r\nratify. The support demonstrated for the Treaty \r\nhighlights the commitment of the international \r\ncommunity to establish a universal and verifiable \r\ncomprehensive nuclear test ban. \r\n The announcement not only meant that the global \r\nmoratorium on nuclear tests, which had been observed \r\nsince 1998, was presumably broken, it also put our \r\norganization in the very sharp focus of attention. It was \r\na test for our organization, our technical capabilities, \r\nour own procedures and the potential value that our \r\nglobal verification system can bring to States \r\nsignatories. In the special session, States signatories \r\nexpressed appreciation for the speedy provision of \r\nreliable and valuable data by the CTBTO’s Provisional \r\nTechnical Secretariat. As regrettable and disquieting as \r\nthis new situation may appear, it is my hope that it will \r\nserve to refocus the attention of the international \r\ncommunity on the relevance of the CTBT as a key \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation instrument and to \r\nunderscore the urgency of bringing the Treaty into \r\nforce and to complete work on the CTBT verification \r\nsystem. \r\n The main activities of the Preparatory \r\nCommission and its Provisional Technical Secretariat \r\nover the past 10 years have been the promotion of the \r\nentry into force and establishment of the verification \r\nregime stipulated by the CTBT. There is significant \r\nprogress to report concerning both. \r\n To date, the Treaty has been signed by 176 States, \r\n135 of which have already ratified it. The ratifying \r\nStates include 34 of the 44 States whose ratification is \r\nrequired for the Treaty to enter into force. Since the \r\nCTBTO’s last report to the General Assembly, two \r\nyears ago, three States have signed and 16 States have \r\nratified the Treaty. \r\nA/61/PV.38  \r\n \r\n06-58069 4 \r\n \r\n In September 2005, 117 States participated in the \r\nConference on Facilitating the Entry into Force of the \r\nCTBT, with 40 States being represented by their \r\nministers or deputy ministers. The meeting was \r\nsuccessful in producing a robust final declaration in \r\nwhich the ratifying States agreed that they would spare \r\nno efforts and use all avenues open to them to \r\nencourage further signature and ratification of the \r\nTreaty. This was followed on 20 September 2006 by a \r\nministerial meeting in support of the CTBT, in which \r\nrepresentatives of 61 States, including 22 ministers and \r\ndeputy ministers, participated. The joint ministerial \r\nstatement, which was welcomed by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, reaffirmed full support for the objectives of \r\nthe CTBT and the work of the Commission. I would \r\nlike to express my thanks for these and the many other \r\ninitiatives in support of the Treaty. \r\n The Provisional Technical Secretariat was \r\nmandated to establish an international monitoring \r\nsystem consisting of 321 monitoring stations using four \r\ntechnologies. Seismic, infrasound and hydro-acoustic \r\nstations are registering energy propagated through the \r\nearth, through the atmosphere and through the oceans. \r\nRadionuclide technology allows the analysis of \r\nradioactive particles filtered from air samples. Half of \r\nthe radionuclide monitoring stations will also register \r\nminute quantities of noble gases present in the \r\natmosphere. \r\n The geographical distribution of the stations \r\nallows for complete global coverage by the system and, \r\nif I may add, includes some rather difficult locations \r\nfor building and operating these stations. \r\n It is the combination of these four technologies \r\nthat should ultimately allow member States of the \r\nCTBT to make an informed judgement about events \r\nregistered by our system. To date, nearly 190 stations \r\nare already providing data through the Global \r\nCommunication Infrastructure to the International Data \r\nCentre, distributing data products to 780 institutions in \r\n93 States signatories. \r\n The CTBT verification technologies have the \r\npotential to offer important additional benefits derived \r\nfrom data from our monitoring stations and the \r\nactivities of the International Data Centre. Our data can \r\nbe used in a variety of fields, including studies of the \r\nearth’s structure as well as for research on earthquakes, \r\nvolcanic eruption forecasting, underwater explosion \r\nlocation, and sea temperature and climate change \r\nmonitoring. During the past year, the Preparatory \r\nCommission has continued to discuss the potential \r\ncontribution of data from the International Monitoring \r\nSystem, in particular in the context of tsunami \r\nwarning. I am confident that the Preparatory \r\nCommission will soon approve a mandate to provide \r\ntsunami-warning organizations with relevant data on a \r\ncontinuous and real time basis. While we are mindful \r\nof the primary purpose of our verification regime, we \r\nhope to be able to further develop these important \r\nsynergies between the CTBTO’s unique capabilities \r\nand the scientific community for the benefit of all. \r\n I wish now to highlight the participatory \r\napproach of our activities. Altogether, 90 countries are \r\nhosting our monitoring system stations, thus \r\ncontributing to our verification capabilities. The \r\nbenefits are shared by all, since data are made available \r\nto everyone in real time. The Preparatory Commission \r\nprovides hardware and software, coupled with \r\nintensive capacity-building efforts, with the aim of \r\nfurther enhancing the ability of States signatories to \r\nmake the utmost use of this unprecedented \r\nparticipatory data-sharing arrangement. \r\n The Preparatory Commission continues to \r\norganize training programmes and workshops to \r\nsupport the enhancement of the national capabilities of \r\nStates. These include training courses for station \r\noperators and managers and technical staff of National \r\nData Centres, on data analysis, storage and \r\nmanagement, the global communications infrastructure \r\nand technologies for use in on-site inspections. In the \r\nfield of international cooperation, the Provisional \r\nTechnical Secretariat continues its role as an \r\ninformation clearing house and provides support for \r\nthe advancement of the Commission’s work. These \r\nextensive outreach activities increase support for and \r\nparticipation in the work of the Commission, as well as \r\nserve to advance national implementation of the Treaty. \r\n Following the adoption on 15 June 2000 by the \r\nGeneral Assembly of the Agreement to Regulate the \r\nRelationship between the United Nations and the \r\nPreparatory Commission for the Comprehensive \r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization, our relations \r\nand interactions with the United Nations and its \r\nprogrammes, funds and specialized agencies have \r\nintensified. Cooperation with the United Nations \r\nDepartment for Disarmament Affairs, including the \r\nthree Regional Centres, is of particular importance to \r\n A/61/PV.38\r\n \r\n5 06-58069 \r\n \r\nthe Commission. I would like to take this opportunity \r\nto thank the Department for its dedicated work.  \r\n The service agreement that the Commission \r\nconcluded with the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme provides us with operational support. The \r\nWorld Meteorological Organization is receiving data \r\nfrom the monitoring system for research purposes. \r\nPotential fields of cooperation are being explored with \r\nother organizations of the United Nations system. I \r\nwould also like to highlight the growing cooperation \r\nwith UNESCO in relation to our provision of data for \r\ntsunami warning purposes. \r\n In order to contribute fully to the work of the \r\nUnited Nations family, the Preparatory Commission \r\nhas requested full membership in the United Nations \r\nsystem’s Chief Executives Board. That would not only \r\nallow for strengthened cooperation and synergies, but \r\nwould also provide that body with essential expertise \r\nin the field of nuclear disarmament and non-\r\nproliferation. \r\n I would like to close with a personal remark. The \r\nraison d’être of the CTBT is to establish a legally \r\nbinding norm against nuclear testing and to set up a \r\ncredible system to verify compliance with that norm. \r\nVerification of international disarmament and non-\r\nproliferation agreements is always difficult, slow and \r\ncostly. But, at the same time, it is an important and \r\nworthwhile enterprise. I would like to thank all States \r\nthat are supporting, in technical, financial and political \r\nterms, the development of our verification system. We \r\nwill continue to do our utmost to live up to the high \r\nexpectations with regard to our monitoring capabilities.  \r\n Ultimately, however, all our work — in \r\nparticular, the sophisticated verification regime — will \r\nprove its worth only after the CTBT has entered into \r\nforce. It is up to those States listed in Annex 2 to the \r\nCTBT — whose ratification is necessary for its entry \r\ninto force — to consider the Treaty’s value in terms of \r\nboth their national security and international security. \r\nThe reliable performance of the verification regime and \r\nthe example of a growing number of ratifiers will, I \r\nhope, help them to reach a positive decision. \r\n The President: I now call on Mr. Rogelio Pfirter, \r\nDirector-General of the Organization for the \r\nProhibition of Chemical Weapons, to present the report \r\nof the organization. \r\n Mr. Pfirter (Organization for the Prohibition of \r\nChemical Weapons): Please accept my congratulations \r\nand best wishes, Madam, on your election as President \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. I \r\nshould also like to congratulate His Excellency \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon on his unanimous election as the \r\nnext Secretary-General of the United Nations. Mr. Ban \r\nhas demonstrated a strong personal commitment to \r\nsupporting both the Chemical Weapons Convention \r\n(CWC) and the Organization for the Prohibition of \r\nChemical Weapons (OPCW). I therefore look forward \r\nto future cooperation with him in promoting peace and \r\nsecurity, which are goals shared by the United Nations \r\nand the OPCW. \r\n Just a little more than a week ago in the First \r\nCommittee, I gave a detailed description of the present \r\nactivities of the OPCW and underscored the \r\nimportance of cooperation between the United Nations \r\nand my organization. Furthermore, as has been pointed \r\nout, the annual report of the OPCW’s activities and \r\nprogrammes on the implementation of the CWC in \r\n2004 and the draft report for 2005 have already been \r\ncirculated. Today, I will summarize those aspects and \r\nexplain some of the challenges that we face in \r\nimplementing the Convention. \r\n Let me begin by presenting an overview of the \r\ncurrent situation. The disarmament and \r\nnon-proliferation regime established by the Convention \r\ncontinues to grow in strength. The OPCW now boasts a \r\nmembership of 180 countries or States parties to the \r\nConvention, which is equivalent to more than 90 per \r\ncent of the world’s population. More than 2,600 \r\ninspections have been carried out by OPCW inspection \r\nteams at more than 1,000 sites in 76 countries. Nearly \r\n85 per cent of the inspection resources are used to \r\nverify the destruction of chemical weapons, which in \r\nmany cases is carried out 24 hours a day, seven days a \r\nweek.  \r\n Today, 15,094 metric tons of Category 1 and 2 \r\nchemical weapons have been certified by the OPCW as \r\ndestroyed. That represents 21 per cent of the declared \r\nstockpiles worldwide. In addition, 12 destruction \r\nfacilities are operating around the world, 10 of them \r\ncontinuously. More facilities will begin operations in \r\nthe next three years. \r\n Six destruction facilities are operating in the \r\nUnited States of America, and more than 37 per cent of \r\nits stockpile has already been destroyed.  \r\nA/61/PV.38  \r\n \r\n06-58069 6 \r\n \r\n The pace of chemical disarmament in the Russian \r\nFederation — which initially was rather slow — has \r\nnow picked up significantly. The country has destroyed \r\nmore than 6 per cent of its declared chemical stockpile. \r\nThe remaining Russian stockpile of just over 39,000 \r\nmetric tons of chemical warfare agents is scheduled to \r\nbe destroyed by 2012. The authorities in the Russian \r\nFederation have been very clear in their pledge to fulfil \r\ntheir obligations under the Convention within the time \r\nframe and in the manner mandated by the CWC. I \r\nwelcome that resolve and encourage further \r\ninternational financial support for the Russian \r\ndestruction programme, whose completion will benefit \r\nnot just the Russian Federation, but the world as a \r\nwhole. \r\n For its part, India has eliminated more than \r\n67 per cent of its declared stockpile at a sustained pace. \r\nAnother State party has irreversibly disposed of more \r\nthan 83 per cent of its chemical weapons. The Libyan \r\nArab Jamahiriya, having destroyed its entire stockpile \r\nof Category 3 chemical weapons, has started \r\ndestroying its Category 2 chemical weapons. The \r\nelimination of its entire stockpile is set to be completed \r\nby 2010. Albania is due to start destroying its chemical \r\nweapons later this year and is expected to complete the \r\ndestruction of its entire stockpile by the end of April \r\n2007. \r\n Given the large quantity of toxic agents, the high \r\ncost and the human and environmental considerations \r\ninvolved, the destruction of chemical weapons \r\nstockpiles has, in certain cases, proved to be very \r\nchallenging. As a result, five possessor States have \r\nrequested extensions of their destruction deadlines, in \r\nsome cases, until the final deadline of 29 April 2012. \r\nThis most important matter will be considered by the \r\nConference of the States Parties to the Chemical \r\nWeapons Convention at its eleventh session in \r\nDecember of this year. \r\n Our verification efforts related to the prevention \r\nof any future proliferation of chemical weapons are \r\nproceeding equally apace. Here, too, the inspection \r\nrecord of the OPCW speaks for itself. We have \r\ncompleted more than 1,200 industry inspections and \r\naim at gradually increasing the quality and the quantity \r\nof our efforts in this area. I will say more on this point \r\nlater. \r\n Over 98 per cent of the world’s chemical industry \r\nis located in States party to the Convention, and I \r\nwould like to take this opportunity to recognize and \r\napplaud once more the support the world’s chemical \r\nindustry has shown for the object and purpose of the \r\nConvention. \r\n Significant progress continues to be registered in \r\nthe key area of national implementation of the CWC by \r\nall States party to it. It is quite encouraging to note that \r\nby now the vast majority of States parties have now \r\nestablished a National Authority as required under \r\nArticle VII of the Convention. \r\n At the same time, a considerable number of \r\ncountries continues to lag behind in meeting all of their \r\nnational implementation obligations. The OPCW \r\ncontinues to play its expected role in assisting its \r\nmember States in their national implementation efforts. \r\nIn the last three years, more than 130 States parties to \r\nthe Convention have received support in this field from \r\nthe Technical Secretariat and from several other States \r\nparties. \r\n With regard to international cooperation and \r\nassistance, I am pleased to report that, since 1997, \r\nabout 5,600 participants have benefited from more than \r\n500 activities in the area of international cooperation in \r\nthe peaceful uses of chemistry. Our programmes have \r\nbeen made possible, in part, by generous voluntary \r\ncontributions from a number of States parties and from \r\nthe European Union. We are, of course, grateful for this \r\nsupport. \r\n Concerning budgetary matters, I am pleased to \r\nreport that this year the OPCW is operating with zero \r\nnominal budgetary growth, which implies a diminution \r\nin the assessed contributions of member States. We \r\nhope and expect that we can achieve such diminution \r\nin the budget for 2007, which is still to be approved by \r\nmember States and which contains a proposal to this \r\nend. \r\n This budgetary discipline has been achieved \r\nwithout any detriment to full programme delivery. In \r\nfact, the year 2006 saw an increase in the level of \r\nOPCW activities in a number of areas. As Director-\r\nGeneral, I will remain committed throughout the period \r\nof my mandate to fiscal discipline and to best \r\nmanagerial and administrative practices. \r\n The overview I have just given will, I hope, \r\nprovide a good sense of the progress in implementing \r\nthe goals of the CWC. However, much remains to be \r\naccomplished, and the challenges are many. For \r\n A/61/PV.38\r\n \r\n7 06-58069 \r\n \r\ninstance, it is clear that, notwithstanding this progress \r\nand the unwavering political commitment of all our \r\nState parties, in the coming years we will need to \r\novercome significant operational hurdles in the \r\ndisarmament area. \r\n The Convention, which entered into force in \r\n1997, sets the ambitious target of eliminating a massive \r\nstockpile of chemical weapons within ten years, with \r\nthe possibility of an extension for an additional five \r\nyears. The final deadline, therefore, is 29 April 2012, \r\ndate by which each and every chemical weapon \r\ndeclared by States party to the Chemical Weapons \r\nConvention needs to be destroyed. Of course, we are \r\nstill five-and-a-half years away from that date. And it \r\nwould therefore be ill-advised and premature to jump \r\nto any conclusions. In fact, I remain absolutely \r\nconvinced of the strong determination of possessor \r\nStates to complete destruction by that date. \r\n At this stage, therefore, I would simply underline \r\nthat ensuring the attainment of this singular landmark \r\nis central to the success of the Convention, and is thus \r\nof the greatest interest to the whole of the international \r\ncommunity. While requests for extensions of the April \r\n2007 destruction deadline are fully in line with the \r\nCWC and deserve every sympathetic consideration by \r\nStates parties, all possessor States parties must plan \r\ntheir final destruction activities in a manner that fully \r\nrespects requirements under the Convention. \r\n The full implementation of the CWC, in \r\nparticular, Article VII, by all States parties, is another \r\nimportant challenge. Without exception, all of our \r\nStates parties are under an obligation to both adopt and \r\nenforce the legislative and administrative measures \r\nrequired to detect, pursue, and prosecute any breach of \r\nthe Convention in any area under their jurisdiction or \r\ncontrol. \r\n To a great degree, these obligations are \r\nessentially identical to those stipulated in Security \r\nCouncil resolution 1540 (2004). \r\n A further challenge facing the OPCW is the need \r\nfor sustained and increased efforts in some categories \r\nof industry inspection. While we have been inspecting \r\nSchedule 1 and Schedule 2 facilities with sufficient \r\nfrequency, I do not believe that we have done enough \r\nin relation to Schedule 3 plant sites and other chemical \r\nproduction facilities (OCPFs). Based on the \r\ndeclarations made by States parties, the Technical \r\nSecretariat has identified approximately 5,000 such \r\nproduction facility sites of relevance to the CWC. \r\n It is true that, from a technical standpoint, these \r\ntwo categories of plant sites represent a less immediate \r\nproblem with regard to the potential production of \r\ndeadly chemicals. By the same token, however, some \r\nof them do produce or consume dual-use agents. That \r\nis why, under the Convention, they are declarable and, \r\npossibly, inspectable. Furthermore, the Convention \r\ndoes not say that they should necessarily be inspected \r\nless frequently than other categories of plant sites. \r\n To date we have inspected only around eight per \r\ncent of all relevant facilities of that category. At the \r\npresent rate, it will take us decades to inspect all of \r\nthem at least once. This situation needs significant \r\nimprovement. Furthermore, the need for action on such \r\nfacilities is increased by the looming threat of chemical \r\nterrorism. On such basis, no lessening of attention in \r\nthis regard could be expected from the Technical \r\nSecretariat. It is up to member States to take a political \r\ndecision, if they so wish, in this respect.  \r\n Therefore, since becoming Director-General in \r\n2002, I have consistently proposed through the OPCW \r\nbudget, a larger number of OCPF inspections, and if \r\nmy proposal for 2007 is approved, by the end of that \r\nyear, we will have inspected approximately 11 per cent \r\nof all such production facilities. This verification \r\nactivity will be done without any detriment to \r\ninspections elsewhere.  \r\n Universal adherence to the Convention is crucial \r\nto its success. Its object and purpose can be realized \r\nonly if all States join in and fully implement its \r\nprovisions. Indeed, even after completion of the \r\ndestruction of all the declared stockpiles by all \r\npossessor States, the object and purpose of the \r\nConvention could be frustrated, if only a single State \r\nwere to remain outside its jurisdiction. Technically, any \r\nsuch State could consider itself exempt from the ban on \r\nchemical weapons, hence preserving its ability to \r\nengage in forbidden chemical weapons programmes. \r\n Although only fifteen Member States of the \r\nUnited Nations have yet to join, and some of them are \r\ntaking steps to do so, there remains a small but \r\nsignificant number of countries whose continued non-\r\nadherence to the Convention is a matter of justified \r\nconcern. Their reticence is often explained away as an \r\nunavoidable consequence of regional tensions or \r\nconflicts. \r\nA/61/PV.38  \r\n \r\n06-58069 8 \r\n \r\n I do not agree at all with this line of thought, \r\nwhich seeks to legitimize a seemingly indefinite delay \r\nin joining the rest of humanity in banning forever an \r\nentire category of weapons of mass destruction. In fact, \r\ngiven the wide recognition of the CWC, chemical \r\nweapons are not only unacceptable today, but they are \r\nunmistakably illegal under international law. It is \r\ndangerous and unfair to the rest of the international \r\ncommunity that a few States should seem to be able to \r\nremain free from the obligation to be transparent in this \r\nvery sensitive area. In the end, there is, and can be, no \r\nmoral or strategic justification for keeping the \r\nchemical weapons option open. \r\n One worrying example of what appears to be firm \r\nreluctance to join the Chemical Weapons Convention is \r\nthe case of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, \r\nwhich only a few days ago detonated a nuclear device, \r\nthereby incurring the unanimous condemnation of the \r\nSecurity Council as set out in its resolution 1718 \r\n(2006). \r\n I regret to say that — alone among all other \r\nnations in the Assembly — the authorities in \r\nPyongyang have not acknowledged any of the many \r\napproaches we have made to the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea to encourage its membership in the \r\nOPCW. That negative fact is all the more disturbing \r\ngiven the long-standing international concern about the \r\npossible existence of chemical weapons in that State. \r\nIn fact, in paragraph 7 of resolution 1718 (2006), the \r\nSecurity Council decided that the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea “shall abandon all other existing \r\nweapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile \r\nprogramme[s] in a complete, verifiable and irreversible \r\nmanner”. \r\n In that context, I would like to reaffirm once \r\nmore that the OPCW remains available and ready to \r\nassist the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to \r\njoin the Convention. \r\n Additional concerns exist about the persistent \r\nrefusal to join the Chemical Weapons Convention by \r\nsome key countries in the Middle East. I once again \r\nappeal to those countries to become parties to the \r\nConvention without any further delay. All avenues for \r\ndialogue are open. One such opportunity will be \r\navailable in Rome next week at an OPCW workshop on \r\nthe universality of the Convention in the Mediterranean \r\nBasin. There we will engage in further dialogue with \r\nStates in the Middle East not parties to the Convention. \r\nThe workshop is being organized with the support of \r\nthe Italian Government and the European Union. We \r\nextend our sincere gratitude to both. In addition, I am \r\ngrateful to the Foreign Ministers of Israel, Lebanon and \r\nthe Syrian Arab Republic, each of whom has responded \r\npositively to my invitation to participate in the \r\nworkshop and will be sending an official delegation. I \r\nalso hope that we will be able to find other \r\nopportunities to continue our dialogue with Egypt, \r\nwhich did so much to bring about the satisfactory \r\nconclusion of the negotiations on the Chemical \r\nWeapons Convention. \r\n The success of the Convention also depends upon \r\na partnership among the groups of States that make up \r\nits membership. Articles X and XI of the Convention, \r\nwhich cover international cooperation and assistance \r\nand economic and technological development, \r\nrepresent areas of particular interest. The OPCW must \r\ncontinue and, if anything, increase assistance and \r\nsupport to States parties in that context. Of course, I \r\nmust recall that the interest of countries in that \r\nparticular aspect of the Convention stems not only \r\nfrom our commitment to promote peaceful uses of \r\nchemistry but also from their own needs to address the \r\nincreasing legitimate demands for capacity-building so \r\nthat they can respond effectively to chemical threats, \r\nincluding those posed by terrorists.  \r\n The OPCW is not an anti-terrorism agency. \r\nHowever, it is clear that the full implementation of the \r\nConvention can contribute to the struggle against the \r\nscourge, as can be seen from Security Council \r\nresolution 1540 (2004) and, more recently, General \r\nAssembly resolution 60/288, which sets out the United \r\nNations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. \r\n One other matter that is crucial to the success of \r\nthe Convention is the ongoing strong commitment by \r\nall States parties to work by consensus. It is very \r\nreassuring to note that that practice has continued, \r\nthereby strengthening our hope that the challenge \r\nposed by our Second Review Conference, which is to \r\nbe held in 2008, will, like the first review, be crowned \r\nby success. \r\n An additional challenge is the political and \r\noperational need to ensure that all the verification tools \r\nprovided for in the CWC work as they should. One \r\nsuch tool is the challenge inspection, which is crucial \r\nto the ability of the OPCW to maintain a credible \r\ndeterrent against an attack involving chemical weapons \r\n A/61/PV.38\r\n \r\n9 06-58069 \r\n \r\non any of its member States. The secretariat will \r\ntherefore continue to ensure that it maintains the \r\ntechnical and overall operational readiness to carry out \r\na challenge inspection, should it be required to do so in \r\naccordance with the CWC. \r\n Additional operational challenges lie in the need \r\nto ensure that inspection procedures are efficient and \r\ncost-effective. Other issues are the result of \r\ndevelopments in science and technology. Just as \r\nimportant are the emergence of new chemicals, the \r\ngrey area between chemistry and biology and the \r\nproduction of new types of weapons. All those are \r\nmatters that could have a concrete impact on the \r\noperation of the Convention. \r\n Allow me to conclude by recalling that the tenth \r\nanniversary of the entry into force of the CWC and of \r\nthe establishment of the OPCW will take place on 29 \r\nApril 2007. We trust that the Secretary-General will be \r\nable to join us on that occasion. Our States parties have \r\nevery reason to commemorate with some satisfaction \r\nthat important milestone in the history of disarmament. \r\nThe CWC, and in particular its disarmament agenda, is \r\nbeing implemented effectively. We remain fully \r\ncommitted to the tasks entailed in achieving a world \r\nfree of chemical weapons — a mandate that is \r\npromoted by the Charter of the United Nations and that \r\nserves the twin causes of peace and security.  \r\n As we approach our tenth anniversary, I would \r\nalso like to express a final word of gratitude to all \r\nthose States that intend to mark the occasion in a \r\nspecial way. Particular recognition is due to the \r\nGovernment of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, which \r\nis working in support of the CWC and the OPCW in an \r\nunparalleled fashion, and which is playing a crucial \r\nrole in our commemoration next year. That is but \r\nanother concrete demonstration of the Netherlands \r\ncommitment to the success of the CWC and of the \r\nOPCW. In the same spirit, I would also like to express \r\nmy thanks to the municipality of the city of The Hague, \r\nwhich is also supporting our commemoration and \r\nwhich spares no effort to make our lives comfortable in \r\nour home town.  \r\n The President: I call on the representative of the \r\nRussian Federation to introduce draft resolution \r\nA/61/L.4. \r\n Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): The establishment of the collective \r\napproaches necessary for the effective resolution of \r\ncontemporary threats and challenges requires a steady \r\nincrease in cooperation between the United Nations \r\nand regional and subregional organizations based — as \r\nset out in the 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution \r\n60/1) — on the solid foundation of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, in particular on Chapter VIII. As \r\nRussia’s Foreign Minister, Mr. Sergey Lavrov, \r\nemphasized when he addressed the Security Council on \r\n20 September (see S/PV.5529), the United Nations and \r\nregional organizations must harmoniously complement \r\neach other by utilizing their relative comparative \r\nadvantages.  \r\n With regard to the United Nations, that means the \r\nuniversality of the membership and its activities and its \r\nuniversally recognized legitimacy. In turn, regional \r\norganizations possess the best knowledge of the \r\nsituations in the areas in which they operate. They \r\noften also have more sophisticated equipment and their \r\nown sources of financing. A clear division of labour — \r\nwhile preserving the prerogatives of the United Nations \r\nand the Security Council — will make it possible to \r\nincrease the international community’s crisis \r\nprevention capability. We believe that the regular \r\nmeetings between the Secretary-General and leaders of \r\nregional organizations are extremely valuable.  \r\n The agenda for cooperation between the United \r\nNations and regional partners is becoming broader and \r\nmore multifaceted. In addition to peacekeeping and \r\npeacebuilding, there is also a need to combat the \r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, stem \r\nillegal sources of small arms and light weapons, \r\ncontrol other destabilizing cross-border programmes, \r\nfight drug trafficking and organized crime and help to \r\nresolve multifaceted socio-economic problems in the \r\nworld. \r\n We must strengthen cooperation between the \r\nOrganization and regional and subregional groups. \r\nCooperation must be intensified with the African \r\nUnion, the Economic Community of West African \r\nStates, the Southern African Development Community \r\nand the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, \r\namong others. The League of Arab States also has an \r\nimportant role to play in finding peaceful ways to \r\nresolve many of the problems affecting the Middle East \r\nregion. Cooperation should also be strengthened with \r\nthe Gulf Cooperation Council, the Organization of the \r\nIslamic Conference, the Organization of American \r\nStates and other groupings in Latin America. We would \r\nalso like to see further development of interaction with \r\nA/61/PV.38  \r\n \r\n06-58069 10 \r\n \r\nthe United Nations on the part of structures such as the \r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \r\n(OSCE), the European Union (EU) and the North \r\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) when crisis \r\nresponse mechanisms are being set up.  \r\n Here too, it is essential to have full respect for the \r\nSecurity Council’s primary responsibility for the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, \r\nincluding the adoption of mandates for peacekeeping \r\noperations. The Russian Federation continues to \r\npromote deepened cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the Commonwealth of Independent States \r\n(CIS), the Collective Security Treaty Organization and \r\nthe Euro-Asian Economic Community, which make \r\nsignificant contributions to the resolution of today’s \r\nproblems and challenges at the regional and global \r\nlevels.  \r\n We welcome the already solid links between \r\nthose regional mechanisms and the United Nations, as \r\nwell as the joint implementation of a number of \r\nprojects and programmes. Integration processes in our \r\nregion are maturing, becoming ever more active and \r\ninvolving States from neighbouring subregions. There \r\nhas been a dynamic growth in the legal, institutional \r\nand financial basis of such cooperation.  \r\n Within the CIS, the Collective Security Treaty \r\nOrganization and the Euro-Asian Economic \r\nCommunity, systematic and comprehensive interaction \r\nis taking place, including in such areas as \r\npeacebuilding, economic development and trade, \r\nenvironmental protection, humanitarian response, \r\ncontrolling migration flows and combating organized, \r\ncross-border crime and similar problems. Particular \r\nattention is being given to strengthening the potential \r\nof member countries, especially in the execution of \r\nmajor infrastructure projects, such as the construction \r\nof hydroelectric plants and the expansion and \r\nimprovement of road and railway networks.  \r\n We note in particular the cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and the CIS in the area of \r\npeacekeeping. The Collective Peacekeeping Forces of \r\nthe CIS, in close contact with United Nations Observer \r\nMission in Georgia (UNMIG), is maintaining security \r\nand stability in the Georgia-Abkhaz conflict area in \r\nnear crisis conditions.  \r\n Significant prospects also exist for the evolving \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nCollective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO). In \r\nthat framework, intensive work is under away to create \r\na CSTO peacekeeping potential, including for \r\ndeployment in United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations. After the establishment of relations \r\nbetween the CSTO and the Counter-Terrorism \r\nCommittee Executive Directorate and between the \r\nCSTO and the United Nations Office on Drugs and \r\nCrime, there is now a concrete possibility of \r\ncooperation in these areas.  \r\n A growing role in providing stability and security \r\nin the Euro-Asian region is played by the Shanghai \r\nCooperation Organization, whose members have said \r\nthat they are in favour of developing cooperation with \r\nthe United Nations in a number of crucial areas, \r\nincluding the fight against international terrorism, the \r\nillegal spread of drugs and the post-conflict recovery of \r\nAfghanistan. We welcome the dynamic process of \r\nstrengthening cooperation between the Euro-Asian \r\nEconomic Community and the United Nations, and we \r\nintend to continue to promote this.  \r\n At the same time, we believe that the potential for \r\nmutually advantageous cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the integration mechanisms in the CIS area \r\nis far from being exhausted. In that context, we look \r\nforward to greater activity, more proactive approaches \r\nand increased openness to dialogue from the leadership \r\nof the United Nations agencies. Russia, for its part, is \r\nprepared to promote the further strengthening of those \r\naspects.  \r\n A particular feature of my delegation’s statement \r\non this agenda item today is that this year the Russian \r\nFederation is not just the Chair of the Group of Eight \r\n(G-8), one of the major forums for agreeing upon and \r\nadopting collective decisions on problems of world \r\ndevelopment, but also Chair of the Committee of \r\nMinisters of the Council of Europe and the Black Sea \r\nEconomic Cooperation Organization (BSEC). Those \r\ninternational mechanisms are actively participating in \r\nbuilding the new architecture of international relations. \r\nAlthough their areas of responsibility do not coincide, \r\nthroughout our parallel chairmanships we have been \r\nconducting a kind of brainstorming process. We are \r\ntrying to build a common understanding that narrow, \r\nbloc-based approaches to resolving problems of world \r\ndevelopment are not enough. Indeed, they are \r\ncounterproductive and dangerous.  \r\n It is precisely in that spirit that we welcome this \r\nopportunity to analyse the level of cooperation between \r\n A/61/PV.38\r\n \r\n11 06-58069 \r\n \r\nthe Council of Europe and the United Nations. We \r\nwelcome the report prepared by the Secretary-General \r\n(A/61/256). We would also like to take this opportunity \r\nto welcome the senior officials from the Council of \r\nEurope and delegations from its Parliamentary \r\nAssembly who have made a special trip to New York to \r\nparticipate in the Assembly’s discussion of this agenda \r\nitem.  \r\n Cooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nCouncil of Europe is an example of long-standing \r\npositive relations between international organizations. \r\nThe regular high-level meetings, the Council of \r\nEurope’s increased contribution to major United \r\nNations events and the unabated intensity of the \r\nParliamentary Assembly’s discussion of the question of \r\ncooperation with the United Nations are recent \r\ndevelopments that have shown the great desire of the \r\ntwo organizations to have closer cooperation.  \r\n At the third Summit of the Council of Europe, \r\nwhich took place in Warsaw in 2005, member countries \r\nproclaimed their commitment to further strengthen \r\ncooperation between the Council of Europe and the \r\nUnited Nations. The purposes of the United Nations \r\nwith respect to maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity, resolving international economic, social, \r\ncultural and humanitarian problems and encouraging \r\nand developing respect for human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms for all, are fully consonant with \r\nthe purposes of the Council of Europe. At the regional \r\nlevel they are being achieved through efforts to \r\nembody universal values shared by States members of \r\nthe Council of Europe, such as building a Europe \r\nwithout dividing lines on the basis of democracy, \r\nhuman rights, the rule of law, cultural diversity and \r\nsocial cohesion.  \r\n It is precisely in that spirit, and based on the \r\nprovisions of the Action Plan of the Council of Europe, \r\nthat the priorities were established for Russia’s \r\nChairmanship. Their practical implementation is being \r\nhelped by the content of our programme, which we are \r\ntrying to make as broad as possible, with as universally \r\nEuropean a nature as possible.  \r\n The first of these priorities is strengthening \r\nnational mechanisms for protecting human rights, \r\ndeveloping human rights education and protecting the \r\nrights of national minorities. In order to guarantee \r\nhuman rights, the Council of Europe has long been \r\nclosely cooperating with the Office of the United \r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) \r\non questions of asylum, refugees and stateless persons \r\nwithout citizenship, as well as with the Office of the \r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. \r\nCooperation between the Council of Europe and the \r\nUnited Nations is developing in the area of preventing \r\nviolence against women and protecting children.  \r\n A top priority for the Council of Europe is the \r\nestablishment of a common European legal space to \r\nprotect individuals from contemporary challenges. In \r\nthis context, the Council of Europe has made a \r\nsignificant contribution to global counter-terrorism \r\nefforts under the leadership of the United Nations. \r\nConventions have been adopted on the suppression and \r\nprevention of terrorism and on the suppression of the \r\nfinancing of terrorism, and work is under way to \r\nprotect the victims of terrorist acts and cyberterrorism. \r\nThe activities of the Council of Europe in combating \r\nincitement to terrorism and the recruitment and training \r\nof terrorists are fully consonant with Security Council \r\nresolution 1624 (2005). Close contacts have been \r\nestablished with the Counter-Terrorism Committee and \r\nthe legal services of the relevant organizations.  \r\n The Council of Europe continues to work to \r\nimprove democracy and civil society and to introduce \r\neffective methods of governance; a significant \r\ncontribution to addressing these issues has been made \r\nby the regular high-level tripartite meetings between \r\nthe United Nations, the Council of Europe and the \r\nOSCE.  \r\n Among the priorities for Russia’s chairmanship of \r\nthe Council of Europe is the promotion of tolerance \r\nand mutual understanding by developing dialogue and \r\ncooperation in the areas of culture, education, science, \r\nyouth and sport. The Council of Europe is actively \r\ninteracting with UNESCO, inter alia by creating an \r\nopen platform for inter-organizational cooperation in \r\nthe interests of intercultural dialogue.  \r\n During Russia’s chairmanship, the Committee of \r\nMinisters of the Council of Europe decided to support \r\nthe Alliance of Civilizations initiative.  \r\n We believe that the development of cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the Council of Europe \r\nwill help to achieve peace and security and to protect \r\nhuman rights, not only in Europe but throughout the \r\nworld. The draft resolution on cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and the Council of Europe, which we \r\nwill shortly be submitting to the General Assembly for \r\nA/61/PV.38  \r\n \r\n06-58069 12 \r\n \r\nconsideration, fully promotes those goals. That \r\ndocument notes the contribution made by the Council \r\nof Europe in areas such as combating terrorism and \r\ncrime and developing democracy and effective \r\ngovernance. It encourages interaction between the two \r\norganizations and appeals for the further development \r\nof such interaction. The adoption of the draft resolution \r\nwould help to bring the United Nations and the Council \r\nof Europe closer and promote the more effective \r\nimplementation of their goals. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to call upon all States \r\nmembers of the Assembly to support and further \r\nstrengthen cooperation between the two organizations. \r\n I would like now to focus on cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and the Black Sea Economic \r\nCooperation Organization (BSEC), of which Russia \r\ncurrently holds the chairmanship. During the 15 years \r\nof its existence, the BSEC has had a significant degree \r\nof success in attaining its basic goal: the effective \r\npromotion of trade and economic cooperation in the \r\nBlack Sea area. The organization’s authority has grown \r\nsignificantly, and its involvement in pan-European \r\ninteraction is increasing. \r\n In its capacity as Chair of the organization, \r\nRussia is seeking to do everything in its power to \r\nenhance its effectiveness and the practical results for \r\nmember States. Our efforts are aimed at carrying out \r\nspecific tasks in various areas, including \r\ntransportation, communications, energy, tourism, \r\nenvironmental protection, emergency situations, \r\ncounter-terrorism, organized crime and the prevention \r\nof outbreaks of dangerous infectious diseases. \r\nImportant steps are also being taken with a view to \r\nactively involving regions and the local authorities of \r\nmember countries in the BSEC. We are trying to make \r\nthe organization more attractive for community \r\nbusinesses. \r\n It is my honour to introduce, under sub-item (d) \r\nof agenda item 118, draft resolution A/61/L.4, entitled \r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nBlack Sea Economic Cooperation Organization”, \r\nwhich all members of BSEC, as well as other interested \r\nStates, have sponsored. The draft resolution seeks to \r\nfurther enhance the effectiveness of cooperation \r\nbetween the organization and the United Nations, as \r\nwell as the international financial institutions. It \r\nreflects the significant progress made, as well as the \r\nmomentum achieved, by the organization since the \r\nadoption of the previous resolution on the issue. \r\nParticular stress in the draft is placed on the priorities \r\nof the organization’s work. The text will definitely give \r\nadditional impetus to the development of cooperation \r\nbetween the two organizations, as well as revitalize the \r\nwork done by the organization to further adapt it to \r\nnew socio-economic realities. \r\n I would like to sincerely thank all States members \r\nof the organization for the spirit of cooperation that \r\nthey demonstrated in the context of the events held \r\nduring our chairmanship, as well as to thank \r\ndelegations that participated constructively in \r\nconsultations on the text. We hope that the draft \r\nresolution will be adopted by consensus.  \r\n The President: I call on the representative of \r\nIndia, who will introduce draft resolution A/61/L.5. \r\n Mr. Anwar (India): India, which holds the \r\npresidency of the Asian-African Legal Consultative \r\nOrganization this year, is happy to introduce draft \r\nresolution A/61/L.5 on cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the Asian-African Legal Consultative \r\nOrganization. \r\n The Asian-African Legal Consultative \r\nOrganization (AALCO) celebrated its golden jubilee in \r\nApril this year at its headquarters in New Delhi. Over \r\nthe past 50 years, it has acquired unique stature in the \r\ncontext of promoting legal cooperation among Asian \r\nand African States. Its annual conferences are major \r\nevents. Its New Delhi session in April this year was \r\nwell attended. The exchange of views that took place \r\non contemporary issues of international law proved \r\nhighly beneficial to participants. \r\n Reports of AALCO and the declarations adopted \r\nat its annual sessions have become an important source \r\nfor the development of international law. AALCO has \r\nbeen identifying the common interests of Africa and \r\nAsia with regard to issues under consideration in the \r\nUnited Nations and other world bodies. \r\n We would like to encourage AALCO to expand \r\nits activities. This could be done through special \r\ntraining programmes for promoting teaching and \r\nexpertise in legal advising in the area of international \r\nlaw; establishing Chairs in international law teaching \r\nin universities; offering fellowships to Asian and \r\nAfrican students for higher studies in international law; \r\nand publishing books devoted to international law that \r\nare of interest to Asia and Africa. \r\n A/61/PV.38\r\n \r\n13 06-58069 \r\n \r\n Some of these activities can be carried out, \r\nhowever, only if more funds are available. The \r\nclearance of arrears in contributions and the raising of \r\nfunds through voluntary contributions would help. The \r\nshifting of the offices of AALCO and the residence of \r\nthe organization’s Secretary-General to their own new \r\nbuilding would partially ease the financial situation. \r\n Despite its financial limitations, the work of \r\nAALCO is efficiently organized by a small band of \r\nexperts working under its very competent Secretary-\r\nGeneral. Its excellent library and facilities deserve to \r\nbe further improved. In due course, AALCO could \r\noperate as an international law documentation centre \r\nfor the benefit of Asian and African States. \r\n We are optimistic that in the years to come \r\nAALCO will achieve greater success in promoting the \r\ncommon interests of Asian and African States. We have \r\nno doubt that the cooperation between AALCO and the \r\nUnited Nations will continue to grow stronger. We \r\nwish AALCO every success in its future work. \r\n The President: I call on the representative of \r\nItaly, who will introduce draft resolution A/61/L.6. \r\n Mr. Mantovani (Italy): I will focus on sub-\r\nitem (k) of agenda item 108 on “Cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union”. \r\nAs the Assembly knows, a draft resolution on \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union (IPU) comes up every two years \r\nin plenary meeting. As members will recall, the last \r\none was adopted in October 2004. The resolutions that \r\nare adopted for each organization are, in general, \r\nconsensus resolutions. This has always been the case \r\nfor the IPU, and we firmly believe that it should \r\ncontinue to be so. \r\n In its capacity as the current holder of the IPU \r\npresidency, Italy has taken the initiative of sponsoring \r\nthis year’s draft resolution for the debate in the General \r\nAssembly. We, together with a large group of other \r\nmember States — whose numbers are growing by the \r\nminute — submitted draft resolution A/61/L.6. I am \r\npleased to recall that the list of sponsors is still open \r\nfor signature at the Secretariat desk in this Hall. \r\n Each new draft resolution seeks — and in this it \r\nusually succeeds — to carry the United Nations-IPU \r\npartnership forward, as is proved by the growing \r\ncooperation between the two organizations over the \r\nyears. This year’s draft resolution is inspired by the \r\ndecisions taken at the Second World Conference of \r\nSpeakers of Parliaments, the 2005 World Summit \r\nOutcome, the report of the Secretary-General and the \r\nvision of the IPU President on building a strategic \r\npartnership between the United Nations and the IPU.  \r\n The operative paragraphs are based largely on the \r\nlanguage used in the report of the Secretary-General on \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union (IPU). They are also inspired by \r\nthe idea of further enhancing, within existing \r\nresources, the parliamentary dimension of the work of \r\nthe United Nations as an important complement to its \r\nundisputed intergovernmental nature. The importance \r\nof enhancing the parliamentary dimension of United \r\nNations activity must also be seen in the context of the \r\ncurrent international situation, the role national \r\nparliaments play in the decision-making process of our \r\nGovernments and the centrality they attribute to the \r\nrole of the multilateral system and, within that, to the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n As an outcome of the consultations that we have \r\nrecently been holding with a number of interested \r\nMember States, with a view of taking into account any \r\npossible concern, I would like to propose only a minor \r\namendment to the seventh preambular paragraph . In \r\nparticular, since the results of the wide consultation \r\nprocess undertaken by the IPU among national \r\nparliaments were not shared with the Member States \r\nthrough an official United Nations document, we \r\npropose to delete the last part, so that the paragraph \r\nends with “the work of the United Nations”. The \r\nseventh preambular paragraph would therefore read: \r\n  “Taking note of the recommendations \r\ncontained in the report of the Panel of Eminent \r\nPersons on United Nations-Civil Society \r\nRelations in regard to engaging parliamentarians \r\nmore systematically in the work of the United \r\nNations.” \r\n With this only minor revision, Italy is confident \r\nthat this very important draft resolution can be adopted \r\nby consensus today. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Romania, who will introduce draft \r\nresolution A/61/L.7. \r\n Mr. Motoc (Romania): I should first like to \r\ncongratulate the Secretary-General for having \r\npresented us, as usual, a through report on cooperation \r\nA/61/PV.38  \r\n \r\n06-58069 14 \r\n \r\nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations, \r\nan area of topical interest to Romania. I shall dwell a \r\nbit on the item dealing with cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and the Black Sea Economic \r\nCooperation Organization (BSEC). In that regard, \r\nRomania is satisfied with the draft resolution on \r\ncooperation with the BSEC, which we have co-\r\nsponsored. I wish at the same time to congratulate the \r\nRussian Federation, the current chair of BSEC, for \r\nhaving successfully promoted the resolution. The Black \r\nSea area is now a region with tremendous potential for \r\nmultiple cooperation and economic development. That \r\nis why Romania believes it is only right and timely that \r\nthe United Nations focus more on cooperation in the \r\nBlack Sea Basin. The draft resolution we are preparing \r\nto adopt proceeds from such an expectation and is, \r\ntherefore, highly welcome. \r\n Still, we have to acknowledge that the full take-\r\noff of the Black Sea Region in political and economic \r\nterms is seriously hampered by lingering conflicts, \r\nwhich are slowly but steadily getting worse. These \r\nprolonged conflicts affect the lives and aspirations of \r\nmillions of people, including those in the separatist \r\nregions within this area. I do not intend to dwell more \r\non these conflicts and the multiple challenges they \r\ngenerate, as there are regional organizations, such as \r\nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in \r\nEurope (OSCE), that give closer consideration to these \r\nissues, and they will be taken up in the Assembly at \r\ngreater length later in the year, but I would like to point \r\nout that the community of Black Sea States can do \r\nmore to alleviate these problems. We have to get out of \r\nwhat now seems to be a vicious circle.  \r\n Improving economic conditions for the whole \r\nregion will certainly create a better basis for dealing \r\nwith security issues, but no exemplary economic \r\ncooperation can be sustained in the face of the pending \r\npolitical and security problems. We have to concentrate \r\non what is really important for people around the Black \r\nSea, for that matter, for people all over the world. \r\nThere is an enabling, safe, stable and prosperous future \r\nfor the countries in the region and their citizens. \r\nEconomic opportunities are there, and they are huge, \r\nbut if they are to be taken advantage of fully, it is high \r\ntime to address more resolutely the security challenges \r\nin several areas of the Black Sea Basin. Human rights \r\nare a fundamental prerequisite and must be given full \r\nobservance and respect in the process. \r\n Romania considers that the wider Black Sea \r\nRegion today should be regarded in a broader \r\nperspective. Opening up cooperation in the Black Sea \r\nRegion is a necessity. Thanks in particular to the \r\nefforts made during the chairmanship of Greece, the \r\nEuropean Union (EU) has acknowledged the \r\nimportance of a safe and stable Black Sea region for \r\nEuropean security. \r\n I wish to welcome, in this respect, the platform of \r\ncooperation between BSEC and the European Union to \r\nbe submitted to the European Commission to get the \r\nEU much more involved in the wider Black Sea region, \r\nand especially in projects of economic and democratic \r\ndevelopment. We need to raise the profile of our region \r\non the United Nations agenda and other international \r\norganizations, which have the capacity and will to \r\nenhance our cooperation, and to contribute to \r\nstrengthening the future of the BSEC. They are all \r\nconfident that the relations we are building within the \r\nregion can become a success story. That depends on us, \r\nas directly interested parties, but also on our friends \r\nworldwide. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n Now, I should like to turn to the task of \r\nintroducing the draft resolution. I am speaking as the \r\nrepresentative of the host country of the last summit of \r\nheads of State and Government of la Francophonie. In \r\nthat capacity, it is an honour for me to take the floor on \r\nbehalf of the sponsors to introduce draft resolution \r\nA/61/L.7, entitled “Cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the International Organization of la \r\nFrancophonie”. My task has every chance of being \r\nsuccessful as it is being carried out under the General \r\nAssembly presidency of an individual whose \r\nconnection with the French-speaking world is well \r\nknown. \r\n I would like to express our appreciation to the \r\nSecretary-General for the quality of the report \r\ncontained in document A/61/256, prepared under \r\nagenda item 108, entitled “Cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and regional and other organizations”. \r\nSection J of the report, relating to the International \r\nOrganization of la Francophonie (OIF), does justice to \r\nthe wealth and intensity of the links established \r\nthrough time between this Organization and the \r\norganization of countries sharing the French language. \r\n I would also like to pay tribute on this occasion to \r\nthe Secretary-General of OIF, President Abdou Diouf, \r\n A/61/PV.38\r\n \r\n15 06-58069 \r\n \r\nfor his dedication and his constant efforts to promote \r\nboth the role of OIF and the development of its \r\nrelations with the United Nations. \r\n Mr. Majoor (Netherlands), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair. \r\n The draft resolution has 10 preambular \r\nparagraphs, and 18 operative paragraphs. The \r\npreambular part recalls the principles on which \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nInternational Organization of la Francophonie (OIF) is \r\nbased. It also reflects the importance of regional \r\ncooperation in multilateral relations, the establishment \r\nand strengthening of democracy and the rule of law, \r\naccess to new technology in the service of sustainable \r\ndevelopment, respect for cultural and linguistic \r\ndiversity and dialogue between cultures and \r\ncivilizations. \r\n The operative part reflects the positive and \r\nconstructive participation of the OIF in the work of the \r\nUnited Nations and cooperation between the two \r\norganizations in the area of conflict prevention and \r\nother areas of mutual interest, as well as the role \r\nplayed by the OIF in international conferences held \r\nunder the auspices of the United Nations. The \r\noperative part also welcomes the work done at \r\nBucharest at the eleventh Summit of la Francophonie \r\non a subject of great relevance and pressing interest — \r\nnamely, new technology in the service of education. It \r\nalso refers to cooperation between the OIF and the \r\nUnited Nations, and between the OIF and the \r\nspecialized agencies of the United Nations system, \r\nwith a view to achieving development and poverty \r\neradication. \r\n In conclusion, the International Organization of la \r\nFrancophonie, to which as of last month no fewer than \r\n68 States and Governments belong as members or \r\nobservers, plans to make a greater contribution, within \r\nits mandate, to the work of the United Nations and to \r\nthe lofty objectives of promoting peace, democracy, \r\nfull respect for human rights and equitable \r\ndevelopment for all. These are some of the reasons \r\nwhy it is my pleasure to extend an invitation to United \r\nNations Member States of the General Assembly, on \r\nbehalf of the sponsors, to give their full support to draft \r\nresolution A/61/L.7. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Ukraine, who will speak on behalf of \r\nAzerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine (GUAM). \r\n Mr. Khandogiy (Ukraine): I have the honour to \r\nspeak today on behalf of the GUAM countries: \r\nAzerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. \r\n Over the past few years, cooperation between \r\nregional organizations and the United Nations has \r\nconsiderably expanded, strengthened and developed in \r\na most constructive way. The GUAM countries firmly \r\nbelieve that the United Nations and regional \r\norganizations should complement one another \r\nharmoniously, using their comparative advantages. \r\n We are confident that the activities of regional \r\norganizations can strengthen and reinforce a variety of \r\ncritically important objectives of the United Nations, \r\nsuch as conflict resolution and the maintenance of \r\npeace and security, promoting democracy and human \r\nrights, countering terrorism and transnational crime \r\nand supporting economic development. \r\n Allow me to touch upon issues of particular \r\nimportance to the GUAM countries — cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the Organization for \r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), between \r\nthe United Nations and the Black Sea Economic \r\nCooperation Organization (BSEC), and emerging \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and GUAM \r\nitself. \r\n The Kyiv Declaration on establishing the GUAM \r\nOrganization for Democracy and Economic \r\nDevelopment, signed in May 2006, marked a new level \r\nin the GUAM integration process. By signing this \r\nDeclaration, the Presidents of Georgia, Ukraine, \r\nAzerbaijan and Moldova confirmed the desire of these \r\nStates to promote democracy, stability and security, the \r\nrule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms, \r\ncombating international terrorism, aggressive \r\nseparatism, extremism and transnational organized \r\ncrime, the deepening of European integration and the \r\nachievement of sustainable development and the well-\r\nbeing of their peoples, as well as resolving protracted \r\nconflicts. \r\n The GUAM countries are of the view that \r\npeacekeeping is a very important part of the \r\npartnership of the United Nations with regional \r\norganizations, including the settlement of conflicts, \r\npost-conflict activities and peacebuilding. In this \r\nregard, we underline the need to enhance such \r\ncooperation in terms of finding solutions to the \r\nprotracted conflicts in the territories of Georgia, the \r\nRepublic of Moldova and Azerbaijan; these have \r\nA/61/PV.38  \r\n \r\n06-58069 16 \r\n \r\nevolved over the past 15 years. It is critically important \r\nthat the international community, in particular the \r\nUnited Nations and the OSCE, continue to take \r\npractical steps to settle these conflicts, which are \r\namong the most serious obstacles to stability, \r\ndemocracy and economic prosperity in our region. \r\n In this regard, the GUAM member States are \r\ngrateful to those States that supported the inclusion in \r\nthe agenda of the sixty-first session of the General \r\nAssembly of a new item entitled “Protracted conflicts \r\nin the GUAM area and their implications for \r\ninternational peace, security and development”. It was \r\nan important step that will help us to focus the \r\nattention of the international community on the need \r\nfor more effective steps in order to achieve progress in \r\nthe settlement of conflicts on the territories of \r\nAzerbaijan, Georgia and Moldova. \r\n We call for the implementation of Security \r\nCouncil resolutions and decisions of the OSCE on the \r\nconflicts in Nagorno-Karabakh, in Azerbaijan and \r\nAbkhazia, in Georgia, as well as the for realization by \r\nthe Parties concerned of a plan for a peaceful \r\nsettlement of the conflict in South Ossetia in Georgia, \r\noffered by the President of Georgia, and the initiative \r\nby the President of Ukraine on the Transdnistrian \r\nconflict in Moldova on a settlement through \r\ndemocracy. \r\n The GUAM countries attach great importance to \r\nthe strengthening of cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the Organization for Security and \r\nCooperation in Europe. With its vast geographical \r\ncoverage, comprehensive approach to security, \r\nincluding the political, military, human, economic and \r\nenvironmental dimensions, and a unique toolbox of \r\ninstitutions, operations and mechanisms, the OSCE \r\nprovides added value to the achievement of the goals \r\nof the United Nations. \r\n Over the years, the OSCE and the United Nations \r\nhave developed political and operational coherence in \r\nresponse to emerging threats to security and stability. \r\nThe OSCE is committed to assisting in the \r\nimplementation of United Nations Security Council \r\nresolutions in the area of terrorism and weapons of \r\nmass destruction. Cooperation is ongoing in the fight \r\nagainst organized crime, illicit arms trade and human \r\ntrafficking; synergies exist in the spheres of \r\ndemocratization, strengthening the rule of law and \r\nrespect for human rights. We also welcome the \r\nconcrete practical outcome of cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations Economic Commission for Europe and \r\nthe OSCE Coordinator for Economic and \r\nEnvironmental Activities, which has taken the form of \r\njoint projects. We support further development of \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the OSCE \r\nin the areas of conflict prevention, crisis management \r\nand post-conflict rehabilitation, where the OSCE has \r\naccumulated unique experience and expertise through \r\nits specialized institutions and field presence. \r\n Let me now turn to the subject of cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and BSEC. The GUAM \r\ncountries welcome growing cooperation, both in \r\nquantity and quality, among the member States of \r\nBSEC. In recent years, we have witnessed an increase \r\nin and a greater positive contribution of BSEC \r\nactivities to the strengthening of the economy, security \r\nand stability in the region. The BSEC continues to \r\nextend its efforts to strengthen regional cooperation in \r\nvarious fields, including energy, transport, trade and \r\neconomic development, banking and finance, \r\ncommunications, environmental protection, among \r\nmany others. \r\n Since the issues of energy security are among the \r\nmost important for Europe today, the Black Sea-\r\nCaspian region is of special significance for security \r\nand for the stable transportation of energy resources to \r\nEurope. The GUAM States are ready to take an active \r\npart in promoting energy projects within the framework \r\nof the BSEC. We are also convinced that the BSEC \r\nshould provide effective support to the efforts of the \r\nworld community aimed at combating terrorism, \r\nresolving the protracted conflicts in the region and \r\ncombating transborder crime. It is necessary to \r\ncoordinate BSEC activities with corresponding \r\nprogrammes supported by the United Nations, the \r\nOSCE, the European Union and NATO. \r\n Better cooperation between the United Nations \r\nand regional organizations is a work in progress. \r\nToday, we have significant practical experience to \r\nbuild upon. With the overall goal of enhancing \r\ninternational peace and security and ensuring real \r\nimpact on the ground, GUAM and its member States \r\nremain committed to further improving cooperation \r\nwith the United Nations and regional organizations in \r\nthe future. \r\n A/61/PV.38\r\n \r\n17 06-58069 \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Papua New Guinea, who will speak \r\non behalf of the Pacific Islands Forum. \r\n Mr. Aisi (Papua New Guinea): I present this \r\nstatement on behalf of the members of the Pacific \r\nIslands Forum group based in New York: Australia, \r\nFederated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Nauru, New \r\nZealand, Palau, Republic of the Marshall Islands, \r\nSamoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and \r\nmy own country, Papua New Guinea.  \r\n At the outset, I thank the Secretary-General for \r\nhis report on cooperation between the United Nations \r\nand regional and other organizations (A/61/256 and \r\nAdd.1). My intervention is focused on sub-item (r) of \r\nagenda item 108, “Cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the Pacific Islands Forum”.  \r\n The theme that the President of the General \r\nAssembly has chosen for the sixty-first session, \r\n“Implementing a global partnership for development”, \r\nis a very appropriate one in the context of the \r\ndeliberations on this agenda item. Our limited \r\neconomic resource base and our remote location across \r\nthe Pacific Ocean, coupled with a lack of technical \r\nexpertise, of institutional and administrative capacity \r\nand of the financial resources needed to address the \r\nmany multifaceted challenges in the economic, social, \r\nenvironmental and related fields, make it imperative \r\nthat we collaborate with the United Nations system and \r\nother development partners. \r\n The cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe Pacific Islands Forum has gained momentum in \r\nrecent years. However, there is room to strengthen our \r\nrelations and to build on the progress made so far. That \r\nis demonstrated by the increased interaction and \r\ncollaboration among the United Nations Secretariat, \r\nthe Pacific Islands Forum secretariat and other \r\nagencies of the Council of Regional Organizations in \r\nthe Pacific, such as the South Pacific Regional \r\nEnvironmental Programme, the South Pacific Applied \r\nGeoscience Commission, the Secretariat of the Pacific \r\nCommunity and the Forum Fisheries Agency. The Paris \r\nDeclaration on Aid Effectiveness forms the \r\noverarching umbrella for the United Nations strategy in \r\nthe Pacific. We welcome the forthcoming United \r\nNations strategy for the Pacific region and the United \r\nNations development assistance framework. \r\n In that connection, we encourage continued \r\nregular consultations between our Forum’s secretariat \r\nand the United Nations, as well as United Nations \r\nparticipation in meetings of Pacific Islands Forum \r\nleaders, with a view to fostering closer partnerships \r\nthrough knowledge-sharing and cooperation on key \r\nstrategic areas such as terrorism, international peace \r\nand security and trade. \r\n It is our collective desire to strengthen those \r\nrelations in our need for a partnership to address the \r\never-growing challenges before us, including the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) by 2015; to carry out our sustainable \r\ndevelopment agenda, including the full and effective \r\nimplementation of the Mauritius Strategy for Further \r\nImplementation of the Barbados Programme of Action \r\nand of the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation; and \r\nto contribute positively to international peace and \r\nsecurity, including by implementing the Global \r\nCounter-Terrorism Strategy and by addressing the \r\nchallenges relating to small arms and light weapons. \r\n At the forefront of the partnership between the \r\nUnited Nations and the Pacific Islands Forum are the \r\nOrganization’s 14 development agencies, including the \r\nUnited Nations Development Programme, UNICEF, \r\nthe United Nations Population Fund, the United \r\nNations Development Fund for Women, the Food and \r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations, the \r\nOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs \r\nand the United Nations Environment Programme. We \r\nare indebted to those agencies for their commitment \r\nand service in responding to our development \r\nchallenges on a daily basis. \r\n Further examples of collaboration between the \r\nUnited Nations system and the Pacific Islands Forum \r\nare reflected in the Secretary-General’s report. These \r\ninclude the successful mission in Bougainville, thanks \r\nto the United Nations Observer Mission in \r\nBougainville and the Department of Political Affairs of \r\nthe United Nations Secretariat; the development of \r\njoint proposals to complement the activities of the \r\nGovernment of the Solomon Islands and the Regional \r\nAssistance Mission to the Solomon Islands; the vital \r\nrole of the Joint United Nations Programme on \r\nHIV/AIDS in the fight against the HIV/AIDS \r\npandemic; and the efforts of other United Nations \r\nagencies in undertaking important programmes and \r\ninitiatives in our region. \r\n Such programmes complement the activities \r\nenshrined in our Pacific Plan, which is the overarching \r\nA/61/PV.38  \r\n \r\n06-58069 18 \r\n \r\nframework for collaboration and cooperation among \r\nthe Pacific Islands Forum countries. The Pacific Plan is \r\ngeared towards the security, good governance, \r\neconomic growth and sustainable development of our \r\nregion. \r\n As equal members of the United Nations, the \r\nPacific Islands Forum countries deserve a fair hearing \r\nfrom the United Nations system, which is reflected by \r\nan in-country United Nations presence and by the \r\nprovision of quality support for our development \r\nefforts. Certain Pacific nations, such as the Federated \r\nStates of Micronesia, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, \r\nNauru, Palau, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu, have a very \r\nminimal United Nations presence on the ground or \r\nnone at all. That makes it difficult for those countries \r\nto receive the support needed to make progress towards \r\nthe achievement of the MDGs and the fulfilment of \r\nother internationally agreed commitments and \r\nobligations. \r\n Nevertheless, we are grateful for the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s decision to establish a United Nations \r\npresence in those countries and to expand the \r\nOrganization’s in-country presence in Solomon Islands, \r\nthrough proactive engagement with UNDP and other \r\nagencies. We thank the Secretary-General for that \r\nimportant initiative and trust that the necessary \r\nformalities will be completed as soon as possible. \r\n Our people must see activities on the ground that \r\ngive practical effect to the Pacific leaders’ vision of a \r\nregion that is respected for the quality of its \r\ngovernance, the sustainable management of its \r\nresources and the full observance of democratic values, \r\nas well as for its defence of human rights. Our people \r\nmust participate in activities and projects that provide \r\nthem with economic, social and political security. To \r\nthat end, it is important that the international \r\ncommunity urgently address our communications and \r\nenergy challenges and provide for alternative economic \r\nopportunities that will support and enhance the \r\nsustainable management of scarce resources. \r\n The undertaking of concrete projects and \r\nprogrammes that address those concerns and improve \r\nthe livelihood of the people is a litmus test for the \r\nvalidity of such partnerships. We must sustainably \r\nmanage our resources, improve decision-making to \r\nachieve results and avoid creating unnecessarily \r\ncumbersome bureaucracies that have little impact in \r\nterms of delivering concrete projects in our island \r\ncommunities. \r\n With a view to strengthening the ongoing \r\ncollaboration between the United Nations and the \r\nPacific Islands Forum, we will present a draft \r\nresolution entitled “Cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the Pacific Islands Forum”. We would \r\nvery much appreciate the unanimous support of all \r\ndelegations, expressed through the adoption of the \r\ndraft resolution. \r\n Mrs. Ferrari (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines): \r\nIt is an honour to speak, on behalf of the Caribbean \r\nCommunity (CARICOM), in this debate on sub-item \r\n(e), “Cooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nCaribbean Community”, of agenda item 108. \r\n First, I would like to reiterate the appreciation of \r\nthe Caribbean Community for the role played by the \r\nUnited Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti during a \r\ndifficult time for that country. CARICOM reiterates its \r\ncall upon the United Nations and the international \r\ncommunity to turn their attention to assisting Haiti in \r\nits development efforts. \r\n CARICOM continues to utilize a variety of \r\napproaches for meaningful interaction with the \r\nspecialized agencies and institutions of the United \r\nNations to address the development needs of \r\nCARICOM member States. These institutional \r\narrangements are characterized by considerable \r\nflexibility designed to enable the region to benefit \r\nmaximally from the competences, capacities and \r\ncomparative advantages of the United Nations system. \r\n CARICOM member States continue to have \r\naccess to the technical, training, advisory, operational \r\nand financial resources provided by various United \r\nNations agencies to individual countries and \r\nsubregional groupings, as well as the CARICOM \r\nsecretariat and other CARICOM institutions with \r\nregion-wide mandates and responsibilities. \r\n The thematic conferences convened by the United \r\nNations system, including special sessions of the \r\nGeneral Assembly — for example, the United Nations \r\nMillennium Summit, the follow-up conference on \r\nfinancing for development and the special session on \r\nHIV/AIDS — have also been central forums for the \r\ndiscussion of critical development issues, the \r\nformulation of policy recommendations and the \r\nmobilization of resources. Those mechanisms \r\n A/61/PV.38\r\n \r\n19 06-58069 \r\n \r\nexemplify the coordination of effort needed to facilitate \r\nthe convergence between the objectives, priorities and \r\ncapacities of the international community and the \r\ncritical development priorities identified by the \r\nCaribbean Community. \r\n In keeping with the agreement reached between \r\nthe representatives of CARICOM and the United \r\nNations system when they met here in New York in \r\nApril 2004, the region sought the support of the United \r\nNations and its specialized agencies in a number of \r\npriority areas. The first was assistance to facilitate the \r\nimplementation of the Caribbean Single Market and \r\nEconomy, in particular in the areas of infrastructure for \r\na common capital market, the financial services sector \r\nand tourism; to develop national integration and public \r\neducation programmes; and to strengthen CARICOM’s \r\nlegal systems and institutions.  \r\n The second priority area was the further \r\nimplementation of the Barbados Programme of Action \r\nfor the Sustainable Development of Small Island \r\nDeveloping States, particularly in the context of the 10-\r\nyear review conducted in Mauritius in January 2005 \r\nand its follow-up. Efforts to implement resolution \r\n54/224, in particular to promote an integrated \r\nmanagement approach to the Caribbean Sea in the \r\ncontext of sustainable development, constituted the \r\nthird priority area.  \r\n The fourth area was increased cooperation on \r\ndisaster reduction and management, including flood-\r\nhazard management, capacity-building, hazard \r\nmapping and vulnerability assessments. The fifth area \r\nwas support for the implementation of the Action Plan \r\nof CARICOM’s Regional Task Force on Crime and \r\nSecurity. The sixth area was a continued focus on \r\nHIV/AIDS, access to care and treatment and an \r\nintegrated multisectoral approach to prevention; \r\nincreased control of chronic non-communicable \r\ndiseases; and the impact of social inequity on human \r\nand social development within and between countries. \r\n The Community is pleased with the response by \r\nthe relevant United Nations agencies to these critical \r\nareas in the region’s development and counts on the \r\ncontinuing support of the United Nations. \r\n The issue of crime and security is also of key \r\nimportance to the Caribbean Community. The use of \r\nsmall arms and light weapons in illegal criminal \r\nactivities throughout the Caribbean clearly proves the \r\nneed for a concerted and sustained strategic \r\nprogramme over time to address the growing \r\navailability of illegal firearms. \r\n In addition to this, the region has been plagued by \r\nthe increase in the illegal cultivation, production, \r\nextraction, manufacturing and processing, as well as \r\ntrade in and transhipment, of narcotic drugs. This, \r\ncoupled with activities associated with money \r\nlaundering, has the potential to undermine the \r\neconomies of our countries. The initiatives of the \r\nUnited Nations Regional Centre for Peace, \r\nDisarmament and Development in Latin America and \r\nthe Caribbean and the United Nations Office on Drugs \r\nand Crime (UNODC), working in partnership with \r\nother regional and international bodies, have been \r\ncritical for the region. Given the role played in the past \r\nby these agencies, the region believes that the closure \r\nof UNODC by end of this year will be detrimental. Our \r\nministers have pleaded for its retention, and the \r\nCARICOM region hopes that those pleas will not fall \r\non deaf ears and that the United Nations will review \r\nthat plan. \r\n As indicated in the report, the Economic \r\nCommission for Latin America and the Caribbean \r\n(ECLAC) continues to provide technical support to the \r\ncountries of the Caribbean. CARICOM looks forward \r\nto the intensification of the work by ECLAC, in \r\ncollaboration with the CARICOM secretariat, the \r\nCaribbean Development Bank and other regional \r\nagencies in analysing issues of relevance and \r\nimportance to the economic and social development of \r\nthe region, in supporting the CARICOM Single Market \r\nand Economy, in strengthening the region’s statistical \r\nbase, economic forecasting and modelling capabilities \r\nand in analysing macroeconomic, trade and sectoral \r\npolicies. \r\n The region intends to enhance its level of \r\ncollaboration with the United Nations Conference on \r\nTrade and Development in 2007 and 2008. The \r\nCARICOM secretariat has approached that agency for \r\nsupport for its development agenda and is making the \r\ncase for special and differential treatment for small \r\neconomies in the context of the Doha development \r\ntrade negotiations at the World Trade Organization, as \r\nwell as in the areas of services, investment, and \r\nagriculture and non-agricultural issues. \r\n The Caribbean Community continues to \r\ncollaborate with UNESCO and UNICEF. In this regard, \r\nit is anticipated that those agencies will continue to \r\nA/61/PV.38  \r\n \r\n06-58069 20 \r\n \r\nprovide valuable support to the region, particularly \r\nthrough technical assistance to countries in the \r\ndevelopment and implementation of policies, standards \r\nand regulations and in the adoption of guidelines for a \r\ncomprehensive policy, minimum standards and a \r\nregulatory framework for early childhood development \r\nservices. \r\n CARICOM looks forward to continued \r\ncollaboration with the United Nations Environment \r\nProgramme, which has provided extensive support to \r\nthe Caribbean region in addressing its environment and \r\nsustainable development goals and in the \r\nimplementation of both the Barbados Plan of Action \r\nand the Mauritius international Strategy. In this regard, \r\nwe wish to acknowledge the strengthening of the unit \r\ndealing with small island developing States in the \r\nRegional Office for Latin America and the Caribbean \r\nthrough the provision of additional technical resources \r\nto assist the region, the consolidation of the Caribbean \r\nsmall island developing States programme and the \r\nprovision of dedicated resources to facilitate its \r\nimplementation in the region. We believe that that \r\nprogramme, which was recently endorsed by \r\nCARICOM ministers for the environment, can provide \r\na framework which can be used as the basis for the \r\ndevelopment of a comprehensive environmental and \r\nsustainable development programme for Caribbean \r\nsmall island developing States. It can also provide a \r\nvehicle to begin to pool resources in a complementary \r\nand comprehensive manner. \r\n Collaboration with the Food and Agriculture \r\nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO) in the area \r\nof food security is ongoing through the Italian \r\nGovernment’s contribution to the FAO Trust Fund for \r\nFood Security. Through this collaboration, the \r\nCommunity has been in a position to upgrade its \r\nRegional Food Security Programme, and to focus on \r\nthe implementation of the Jagdeo Initiative with \r\nrespect to the transformation of the region’s agriculture \r\nsector. This has assisted each Member State in \r\ndeveloping its own medium-term agricultural sector \r\nframework and in identifying bankable investment \r\nprojects. \r\n The FAO also spearheaded, in collaboration with \r\nthe Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on \r\nAgriculture, the development of preventive measures \r\nagainst the avian flu, and a three-year project to that \r\nend has been established. \r\n The Caribbean Community welcomes the close \r\nworking relationship that has been established between \r\nthe Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS and \r\nthe CARICOM-Pan-Caribbean Partnership against \r\nHIV/AIDS in the implementation of regional projects \r\nfinanced by the World Bank. It is expected that this \r\ncollaboration will continue in other areas related to \r\nhealth. The region also looks forward to developing \r\nsimilar strategic partnerships with the relevant \r\nagencies, including the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme as it seeks to address the issues of non-\r\ncommunicable diseases such as diabetes, obesity and \r\nhypertension, areas which CARICOM heads of \r\nGovernment have agreed should be addressed as a \r\nmatter of urgency. \r\n In conclusion, the Caribbean Community has \r\nbenefited immensely over the years from meaningful \r\ncooperation and collaboration with United Nations \r\nsystem agencies. CARICOM looks forward to \r\ncontinued close collaboration with the United Nations \r\nand its specialized agencies in the promotion and \r\nimplementation of the development efforts of our \r\nregion. \r\n The CARICOM secretariat and the United \r\nNations Department of Political Affairs have been in \r\nconsultations on arrangements for the proposed fourth \r\ngeneral meeting between representatives of CARICOM \r\nand its associated institutions and the United Nations \r\nand its specialized agencies. The CARICOM \r\nsecretariat looks forward to hosting this meeting early \r\nin 2007. \r\n We will be introducing a draft resolution in the \r\nnear future entitled “Cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the Caribbean Community”, and we would \r\nlook for support for it from all Member States of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Belgium, who will speak on behalf of \r\nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in \r\nEurope. \r\n Mr. Verbeke (Belgium): Belgium, in its capacity \r\nas Chairman-in-Office of the Organization for Security \r\nand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), highly values the \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the OSCE. \r\n In January 2006, my Minister, Mr. Karel De \r\nGucht, briefed the Security Council on the programme \r\nof action of the Belgian chairmanship. He reiterated \r\n A/61/PV.38\r\n \r\n21 06-58069 \r\n \r\nour commitment to close cooperation during his \r\nparticipation last September in the Security Council \r\ndebate entitled “Cooperation between the United \r\nNations and regional organizations and other \r\nintergovernmental bodies in maintaining international \r\npeace and security” (see S/PV.5529). \r\n The secretariats of the two organizations had \r\nfruitful staff level meetings in May of this year and the \r\nOSCE participated actively in the seventh high-level \r\nmeeting between the United Nations and the regional \r\norganizations. Several high-level representatives of the \r\nUnited Nations attended meetings and seminars \r\norganized by the OSCE, thereby showing the depth of \r\ncontacts and cooperation between the two \r\norganizations. \r\n On 16 March 2006, the Permanent Council of the \r\nOSCE formally adopted a declaration on cooperation \r\nwith the United Nations. In this declaration, the OSCE \r\naffirmed its readiness to continue playing its role as a \r\nregional arrangement under Chapter VIII of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations, in particular, in the context of \r\nthe framework for cooperation between the United \r\nNations and regional organizations as enhanced under \r\nthe Outcome Document of the 2005 World Summit and \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1631 (2005). The Council \r\nfurther called on the Secretary-General, in consultation \r\nwith the Chairman-in-Office and the Permanent \r\nCouncil, as appropriate, to take steps to further \r\nstrengthen cooperation in this regard. \r\n In order to further underpin this close \r\ncooperation, a General Assembly resolution on the \r\nrelationship between the United Nations and the OSCE \r\nwould be more than welcome. It was not possible, \r\nhowever, for the General Assembly to adopt such a \r\nresolution at its fifty-ninth session, nor at its sixtieth \r\nsession. Belgium, as Chairman-in-Office, will continue \r\nto work towards such a resolution during the current \r\nsession of the General Assembly. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Azerbaijan, who will be speaking on \r\nbehalf of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, \r\nas well as on behalf of the Economic Cooperation \r\nOrganization. \r\n Mr. Mammadov (Azerbaijan): Today, I have the \r\nhonour to speak on behalf of two organizations, \r\nnamely, the Organization of the Islamic Conference \r\n(OIC) and the Economic Cooperation Organization \r\n(ECO). I am currently the Chairman of both \r\norganizations.  \r\n In my capacity as the current Chairman of the \r\nOIC group at the United Nations, it is a great honour to \r\naddress the General Assembly on the agenda item \r\nentitled “Cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference”. I would \r\nlike to convey the greetings of the Secretary General of \r\nthe OIC and to wish the Assembly every success in its \r\nwork at the sixty-first session. I would also like to \r\nextend my sincere gratitude to the President and to her \r\ncolleagues in the Bureau for steering the work of the \r\nAssembly so successfully. We are confident that the \r\nsession will be very ably directed under her leadership. \r\n We have read with interest the report of the \r\nSecretary-General contained in document A/61/256. It \r\ncontains informative details pertaining to the ongoing \r\ncooperation between our two organizations during the \r\nperiod under review. I wish to take this opportunity to \r\nexpress our sincere thanks and appreciation to the \r\nSecretary-General for this important and valuable \r\nreport and for his leadership role in enhancing \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional \r\nand other organizations in areas of common concern. \r\nWe would also like to commend the Secretariat for its \r\npart in the preparation of the report, which also \r\nincludes contributions from other bodies of the United \r\nNations system. \r\n As in previous sessions, the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport is devoted to the status of implementation of \r\nprogrammes and activities in priority areas of \r\ncooperation jointly developed by our two organizations \r\nand their respective agencies and bodies during the \r\nperiod under review. As the report reflects, the progress \r\nof implementation is encouraging. On behalf of the \r\ngeneral secretariat of the OIC and its specialized \r\ninstitutions, I would like to reassure the General \r\nAssembly that we remain dedicated to the joint tasks \r\nwe are pursuing. \r\n In my capacity as the current Chairman of the \r\nOIC Group at the United Nations, I would like to \r\ninform members that a draft resolution entitled \r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference” has been \r\ndistributed among the United Nations Membership. \r\nNext week, we will hold informal consultations on the \r\ntext. Today, I would like to draw the attention of the \r\nA/61/PV.38  \r\n \r\n06-58069 22 \r\n \r\nAssembly to two particularly significant operative \r\nparagraphs in the text. \r\n First, the draft resolution highlights the efforts of \r\nthe OIC Secretary General in strengthening the role of \r\nthe organization in conflict prevention, confidence-\r\nbuilding, peacekeeping, conflict resolution and post-\r\nconflict rehabilitation in member States as well as in \r\nconflict situations involving Muslim communities. In \r\nthat regard, we would like to affirm that the Secretary \r\nGeneral of the OIC will continue to play an active role \r\nin these areas in our common search for solutions to \r\nthese important global problems. \r\n Secondly, our two organizations are requested to \r\ncontinue to maintain close and multifaceted \r\ncooperation in conflict prevention, conflict resolution \r\nand post-conflict peacebuilding. In that regard, \r\noperative paragraph 2 of the OIC draft resolution \r\nencourages the United Nations system, its funds and \r\nprogrammes, and the specialized agencies to continue \r\nto expand their cooperation with the subsidiary organs \r\nand specialized and affiliated institutions of the OIC, \r\nparticularly in the implementation of its 10-year \r\nProgramme of Action. \r\n The Ten-Year Programme of Action of the \r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference reviews the \r\nmost prominent challenges facing the Muslim world \r\ntoday, such as combating terrorism, good governance, \r\nhuman rights, poverty alleviation in Africa and higher \r\neducation, science and technology. The Programme of \r\nAction also includes ways and means of addressing \r\nthese global issues objectively and realistically, in \r\norder to serve as a practicable and workable \r\nprogramme for all OIC member States. \r\n In this regard, with the development of the Ten-\r\nYear Programme of Action, we look forward in the \r\nfuture to further strengthened, better coordinated and \r\nmutually cooperative interaction with the specialized \r\nagencies and other organizations of the United Nations \r\nsystem in their respective areas of interest. \r\n I shall conclude my statement on the same note of \r\nhope and expectation, as I have done in past years, for \r\nfuture cooperation between our two organizations in all \r\nareas of common concern and in the best interests of \r\nour member States. We appreciate the fact that, in his \r\nreport, the Secretary-General highlighted these aspects \r\nof the ongoing cooperation between the United Nations \r\nand the OIC. The levels of cooperation between the \r\ntwo bodies are thus duly described. \r\n As the current Chairman of the Islamic \r\nConference of Foreign Ministers, Azerbaijan stands \r\nready to deepen the existing levels of cooperation \r\nbetween the two organs on regional, as well as global \r\nmatters of concern. We pledge to the General Assembly \r\nthe full and continuous cooperation and support of \r\nAzerbaijan and the OIC. \r\n Azerbaijan attaches great value to cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the Economic \r\nCooperation Organization (ECO). Indeed, the ECO \r\nregion has a vast potential and comparative advantages \r\nin a number of areas, such as human and natural \r\nresources and in scientific and industrial capacity, \r\namong others. The ECO is ready to engage in \r\nconstructive dialogue with the United Nations system \r\nand other relevant stakeholders on how to explore and \r\nutilize these resources. \r\n Blessed with these advantages, we are committed \r\nto reinforcing our efforts to turn the ECO into a \r\ndemand-driven organization, with tangible economic \r\nresults that would benefit member States and the region \r\nas a whole. In our view, in order to realize untapped \r\npotential and achieve tangible results, we should \r\npursue cooperation in such priority fields as transport, \r\ntrade, energy, agriculture, tourism and information and \r\ncommunication technologies. I would like to call upon \r\nthe international community to support the efforts of \r\nthe ECO in this regard. \r\n I would also like to inform the Assembly that \r\nAzerbaijan, in its capacity as Chairman of the ECO for \r\nthe current year, is pleased to submit the agreed text of \r\na draft resolution (A/61/L.8) on cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and the Economic Cooperation \r\nOrganization, which we believe will be adopted by \r\nconsensus. \r\n In my national capacity, I would like to say that \r\nAzerbaijan attaches great importance to its cooperation \r\nwith a number of regional organizations and the \r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \r\n(OSCE). This year, close cooperation continued \r\nbetween the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime \r\nand the OSCE. Joint conferences, seminars and other \r\nactivities were organized and projects were \r\nimplemented. It is important that such measures and \r\nprojects be reflected in the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. \r\n This year the preparation for an environmental \r\noperation to be conducted in the fire-affected occupied \r\n A/61/PV.38\r\n \r\n23 06-58069 \r\n \r\nterritories of Azerbaijan can be pointed out as one of \r\nthe important areas of cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the OSCE. In accordance with resolution \r\n60/285, as an initial stage of the environmental \r\noperation, an assessment mission was conducted by a \r\ngroup of international experts, led by the OSCE, in the \r\nfire-affected territories of Azerbaijan in early October \r\nof this year. The objective of the mission was to assess \r\nthe short- and long-term damage inflicted on those \r\nterritories by the fires and to prepare recommendations \r\nfor the forthcoming environmental operation. The close \r\ncooperation between the United Nations Environment \r\nProgramme and the Economic and Environmental \r\nSubcommittee of the Permanent Council of the OSCE \r\nin the preparation of the assessment mission should be \r\nespecially highlighted. \r\n One important issue related to cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the OSCE is the fight \r\nagainst religious intolerance and discrimination. This is \r\nparticularly critical in the light of anti-Islamic \r\nmanifestations around the world. The OSCE \r\napproaches the issue of combating Islamophobia \r\nthrough the prism of negative manifestations of \r\ndiscrimination and intolerance against all religions. We \r\nbelieve that coordination and cooperation between the \r\nrelevant bodies of the United Nations and the OSCE in \r\nthis area should be strengthened. \r\n The Council of Europe is another organization of \r\nwhich Azerbaijan is a member, and we also attach great \r\nimportance to our cooperation with this organization. \r\nConsidering the fact that conflict resolution is not \r\nwithin the mandate of the Council of Europe, \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nCouncil of Europe is limited to conflict prevention. In \r\nthis regard, we propose that cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and the Council of Europe in the area \r\nof conflict resolution be maintained in fields such as \r\nthe protection of human rights, humanitarian, \r\nenvironmental and social issues, as well as early \r\nprevention and elimination of the negative \r\nconsequences of conflicts. \r\n In conclusion, let me assure the Assembly that \r\nAzerbaijan will do its best to enhance cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the relevant regional \r\norganizations. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Guinea-Bissau, who will speak on \r\nbehalf of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking \r\nCountries. \r\n Mr. Cabral (Guinea-Bissau) (spoke in French): \r\nThe United Nations Charter, in particular its Chapter \r\nVIII, acknowledges the role of regional organizations. \r\nThis role has grown to a level of importance never \r\nbefore equalled and is becoming even greater, given \r\nthe regional nature of most conflicts. This confers upon \r\nregional organizations a responsibility that they must \r\nfully assume. \r\n This is true, for example, of the Economic \r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS). The \r\nrole of ECOWAS has frequently been commended by \r\nthe international community, notably by the Security \r\nCouncil. \r\n It is my honour today to speak on behalf of the \r\nCommunity of Portuguese-Speaking Countries (CPLP), \r\nover which my country has presided since last July. \r\nThe CPLP is very pleased about the relationship that \r\nexists between the United Nations Secretariat and our \r\norganization. This cooperation has grown to include an \r\never-larger number of activities. \r\n Since the CPLP obtained observer status, this \r\ncooperation has become stronger and has extended, \r\ninter alia, to the specialized agencies. In the context of \r\nongoing training, for example, the United Nations \r\nConference on Trade and Development has decided to \r\nhold seminars with a view to ensuring that young \r\npeople, especially those coming from African countries \r\nsuch as ours, are familiarized with the workings of \r\ninternational trade and, in the interests of our \r\nrespective countries, to better follow ongoing \r\nnegotiations at the world level. \r\n But that cooperation is not limited to the United \r\nNations Conference on Trade and Development. The \r\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United \r\nNations (FAO) has also recently done similar things; in \r\ngranting assistance mainly to Portuguese-speaking \r\nAfrican countries, the FAO has decided to provide \r\nassistance so that we are in a better position and have \r\nbetter tools to manage the soil and land, for example, \r\nand to adopt land-use regimes that are consistent with \r\nour country’s needs. \r\n In addition, we recently had an opportunity with \r\nUNESCO, to commemorate Portuguese-language Day \r\nin the context of the struggle we are carrying out to \r\nensure that multilingualism is a reality, in particular \r\nA/61/PV.38  \r\n \r\n06-58069 24 \r\n \r\nwithin the United Nations system. The International \r\nLabour Organization is also helping us to combat the \r\nexploitation of young people — in particular children. \r\nHere, speaking on behalf of the countries I represent in \r\nthis forum, I must emphasize how happy I am about the \r\nexemplary nature of our cooperation.  \r\n The role of regional organizations, as just noted, \r\nis of vital importance, bearing in mind that conflicts \r\nare most often of a regional nature. As far as those of \r\nus within the CPLP are concerned, we also hope to \r\nmake our contribution to the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. \r\n In short, all conflicts, whether localized within \r\nour countries or within our regions, call upon our \r\nattention in many ways. We have decided, therefore, to \r\nensure that our cooperation with the Secretariat, among \r\nothers, develops further. In that context, the Executive \r\nSecretary of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking \r\nCountries has consistently sought to ensure that that \r\ncooperation is active and, if possible, exemplary. \r\n Again, I wish to welcome the report of the \r\nSecretary-General. Its content emphasizes the \r\nimportance of cooperation between the United Nations \r\nSecretariat, United Nations agencies and programmes \r\nand regional organizations and others. The statements \r\nwe have heard this morning confirm our belief that it is \r\nnecessary to see such cooperation develop further, in \r\norder to better respond to the aspirations of the peoples \r\nwe represent and to address appropriately the \r\nenormous set of tasks that is the responsibility of the \r\nUnited Nations. However, we, the Member States, \r\nrepresent the United Nations and we are, therefore, the \r\nUnited Nations and share that responsibility. I can say \r\nthat we are willing to share that responsibility and to \r\nassume it fully. \r\n Once again, speaking on behalf of the \r\nCommunity of Portuguese-Speaking Countries, I must \r\nsay how happy I am that our cooperation is so \r\nexemplary, and I wish to express the hope that our \r\ncooperation will grow ever stronger and extend to new \r\nareas that are even more useful to our respective \r\ncountries. \r\n Mr. Gross (Switzerland): Please let me first \r\nexpress my gratitude to the Government of \r\nSwitzerland, which allowed me to speak in its place \r\nwithout having to speak in its name. I have the honour \r\nto address you as a Swiss member of parliament and a \r\nmember of the Swiss delegation in the Parliamentary \r\nAssembly of the Council of Europe. I am proud to do \r\nthis for the second time because, after quietly \r\nfollowing the General Assembly’s deliberations from \r\nthe sidelines up in the gallery ten years ago, I then \r\nreturned home to launch the idea of a citizens’ \r\ninitiative in favour of Switzerland joining the United \r\nNations and thus correcting the negative vote on the \r\nmatter we had 20 years ago. This political project, as \r\nyou know, turned out to be successful in 2002. \r\n As you know, the United Nations and the Council \r\nof Europe were born following the same catastrophic \r\nexperiences and tried to draw the same lessons from \r\nthem. They each joined the national forces to establish \r\nintergovernmental political bodies in order to prevent \r\nsimilar disasters from happening again. The Council of \r\nEurope’s ten founding States — Turkey was one of \r\nthem, Switzerland then again needed a little bit more \r\ntime — followed the founders of the United Nations \r\nfour years later. But they took from the beginning the \r\ncommon introductory reference to our respective \r\nfounding charters more seriously. The Council of \r\nEurope translated the reference “We the Peoples” not \r\nonly into a governmental body composed of \r\nambassadors representing Governments — the so-\r\ncalled Committee of Ministers — but also a \r\nParliamentary Assembly of members of the national \r\nparliaments, thus associating directly elected \r\nrepresentatives of the peoples in the supranational \r\npolitical endeavours. \r\n The political will of the pioneers of the European \r\nIntegration process was at that time also strong enough \r\nto create the European Court for Human Rights in \r\nStrasbourg, where, since 1959, every citizen of a \r\nCouncil of Europe member State — today nearly 800 \r\nmillion people in soon to be 47 States — can submit \r\ncomplaints against the rulings of their highest national \r\ncourts for violations of the European Convention on \r\nHuman Rights. \r\n The decisions of the Court have to be respected \r\nby the authorities of every State — the unique creation \r\nof a supranational authority accessible by hundreds of \r\nmillions of people. It showed how courageous the \r\nEuropean pioneers were at that time, and how far they \r\nwere ready to go in order to overcome the atrocities \r\ncommitted by nation States not yet civilized by human \r\nrights and international law.  \r\n In the context of the 2005 summit of the Council \r\nof Europe, one of the foreign ministers described the \r\n A/61/PV.38\r\n \r\n25 06-58069 \r\n \r\nParliamentary Assembly as “the true engine of the \r\nCouncil of Europe”. The Prime Minister of \r\nLuxembourg showed in his report this spring that it \r\nwas the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of \r\nEurope that was, much more than others bodies, the \r\ntrue defender of the basic values, as well as more \r\ncourageous and innovative than other bodies of the \r\ninstitution. Speaking about a report on the institutional \r\nbalance of the Council of Europe, which was discussed \r\njust two weeks ago in our week-long autumn session in \r\nStrasbourg, our Austrian colleague, Peter Schieder, \r\nwho is also present here today, noted that it is the first \r\nembodiment of the progress of the democratic spirit in \r\ninternational relations. \r\n I would like to underline that the Parliamentary \r\nAssembly of the Council of Europe is not simply an \r\nannex to a primarily governmental organization that \r\nmeets only a few days in a year, listens to officials and \r\ndecides on resolutions. The Parliamentary Assembly of \r\nthe Council of Europe is a genuinely transnational \r\nparliament that meets four times a year for a whole \r\nweek and works between sessions in ten committees \r\nthat meet about six times in addition to the sessional \r\nmeetings and to whose resolutions and \r\nrecommendations the Committee of Ministers is \r\nobliged to defer and respond. This has created not only \r\nmore than 200 conventions — a genuine pan-European \r\nspace with a common understanding of human rights, \r\ndemocracy and the rule of law — but also a genuinely \r\ntransnational parliamentary discourse, exchange and \r\nlearning process that is able not only to bring \r\nlegitimacy to transnational law and policy-making but \r\nalso to directly shape national legislation and \r\ngovernmental accountability. \r\n You are certainly aware why I tried to show you \r\nthe usefulness and the great merits of the Parliamentary \r\nAssembly of the Council of Europe, the parliamentary \r\nassembly of an international organization that was \r\ncreated to represent the peoples. I would like to suggest \r\nfurther consideration of lessons we could learn from \r\nthis successful pan-European experience, so as to \r\nintroduce an elaborated and robust parliamentary \r\ndimension to the United Nations — a parliamentary \r\ndimension that goes beyond the respective bodies and \r\nother international organizations. \r\n It would also be worthwhile to elaborate a \r\nparliamentary dimension that is integrated into the \r\nstructures of the United Nations, interacts on the basis \r\nof specially designed procedures with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, the Security Council and the General \r\nAssembly, and which might provide a legitimacy only \r\nelected members of parliament may provide. \r\n A parliamentary dimension that allows for the \r\nopenness, frankness, critical thinking and \r\nstraightforwardness which characterize parliamentary \r\ndebates on global issues and concerns would be \r\ninvaluable, and would produce greater innovation and \r\ncreativity than other forms of debate. Such a dimension \r\ndemonstrates what Pericles recognized 2,500 years \r\nago, namely, that a tough debate is the most important \r\nprecondition for making a wise decision. \r\n Finally, the ideal deliberative body would also \r\ninclude a parliamentary dimension which would \r\nprovide the basis for successfully countering the \r\ncriticism that Governments and administrations prefer \r\nto work with non-governmental organizations and \r\ncorporations, rather than democratically elected \r\nrepresentatives at home. \r\n There are many different ways to start a process \r\nto implement a parliamentary dimension within the \r\nUnited Nations. For example, on the basis of several \r\nmeetings and existing reports, the United Nations \r\ncould annually address transnational parliamentary \r\nbodies in various regions around the world, such as the \r\nParliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. \r\nDoing so would stimulate the creation of such bodies \r\nas we know already exist in Latin America, Asia and \r\nAfrica. Incidentally, the Organization for Economic \r\nCooperation and Development (OECD) is already \r\ntaking such steps with the Parliamentary Assembly and \r\nwith members of parliament from our observer States. \r\nJapan, Mexico and Canada are participating regularly \r\nin these parliamentary screening efforts by the OECD. \r\n The General Assembly could also agree to create \r\na sister chamber composed of delegates — perhaps not \r\ndirectly elected among parliamentarians from all \r\nMember States since such a body would quickly \r\nbecome too large — from the transnational \r\nparliamentary bodies of the major regions of the world, \r\nfor example, the parliamentary assemblies of the \r\nCouncil of Europe, Latin America, Africa and Asia. \r\nThe United Nations would then undertake proceedings \r\nto create duties and obligations for all its bodies to \r\ncooperate with a new United Nations parliamentary \r\nchamber. \r\n I am of course aware that such changes require \r\ngreat political will, including the will of Governments \r\nA/61/PV.38  \r\n \r\n06-58069 26 \r\n \r\nto share power with parliamentarians on the \r\ntransnational level. If this will does not exist, the \r\nhegemony of Governments on the transnational level \r\nwould continue to undermine the power of national \r\ndemocracy and national parliaments. Historically, this \r\nkind of will arose only after catastrophes and only in \r\norder to prevent new ones from emerging.  \r\n Today we cannot grant ourselves the dubious \r\nprivilege of learning only in the context of \r\ncatastrophes. For this reason, I wish us all the strength \r\nto learn and to reform power structures without the \r\nneed to be pushed to do so by a new global \r\ncatastrophe. While such an approach might be much \r\nmore challenging and time-consuming, its great \r\nadvantage would be that nearly all of us would be able \r\nto participate actively in a reform that is so much \r\nneeded for the sake of this unique world and of \r\nhumanity. \r\n Mr. Abdalhaleem (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): I \r\nwould like to welcome and thank the heads of the \r\nregional organizations who are in New York today.  \r\n First of all, I would like to refer to one passage \r\nfrom Chapter VIII of the Charter which was adopted by \r\nthe founding fathers of this Organization, as follows: \r\n  “Nothing in the present Charter precludes \r\nthe existence of regional arrangements or \r\nagencies for dealing with such matters relating to \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity as are appropriate for regional action, \r\nprovided that such arrangements or agencies and \r\ntheir activities are consistent with the Purposes \r\nand Principles of the United Nations.” \r\n I would also like to recall the World Summit \r\nOutcome, which was adopted by heads of State or \r\nGovernment at the High-level Plenary Meeting of the \r\nGeneral Assembly held in this Hall in September 2005. \r\nThat document reaffirmed the importance of \r\nmultilateralism in confronting the challenges of our \r\ntime. It also noted the increasing role played by \r\nregional organizations in terms of international peace \r\nand security, pursuant to Chapter VIII of the Charter, \r\nwhich requires the promotion of cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and regional organizations. \r\nAddressing issues of peace and security is a joint \r\nresponsibility of the United Nations and regional \r\norganizations. Because of their direct links and their \r\ngeographical proximity and cultural and social \r\ncharacteristics held in common with States that suffer \r\nfrom conflict, regional organizations have shown that \r\nthey can find common ground and political agreement \r\nthrough dialogue. I would recall, for example, the \r\nexperience acquired by the African Union and the \r\nEconomic Community of West African States. Herein \r\nlies the importance of developing or reviving \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional \r\norganizations pursuant to agreements that take into \r\naccount the hierarchy of institutions and the \r\ncomplementarity and coordination of roles.  \r\n Among the most positive recent practices we \r\nhave seen in the context of the reform process are the \r\nperiodic meetings between the Secretary-General and \r\nregional organizations, an annual event held in parallel \r\nwith the Security Council’s meeting with \r\nrepresentatives of regional organizations for the \r\npurpose of studying all aspects of cooperation, \r\nincluding cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nregional organizations.  \r\n Within the context of the relationship among \r\nthese various mechanisms and coordinating structures, \r\nthe United Nations must now set its priorities, first \r\namong which is the promotion of the capacity of \r\nregional organizations and, particularly, the African \r\norganizations, in peacebuilding and peacekeeping.  \r\n We are not talking about regional organizations \r\nthat have significant resources and capabilities at their \r\ndisposal, such as NATO, the Organization of American \r\nStates and the European Union. Rather, the African \r\nUnion possesses young institutions, such as its Peace \r\nand Security Council, the development of whose \r\ncapacities and resources should be a priority. Trust \r\nneeds to be built among these various institutions so \r\nthat they can play their proper regional role in building \r\nand keeping peace in Africa, a continent which suffers \r\nfrom many conflicts and civil wars. \r\n The second priority of the United Nations in this \r\ncontext is the promotion of dialogue and coordination \r\nto avoid shortcomings, bridge gaps and address urgent \r\nmatters. That requires urgent action, enormous \r\nresources, humanitarian intervention in some conflicts, \r\nand financial, technical and logistical support. The \r\nregional role should be complemented, not competed \r\nwith. We support all of these practical relationships \r\nand, in keeping with Chapter VIII, Article 52, of the \r\nCharter, “The Security Council shall encourage the \r\ndevelopment of pacific settlement of local disputes \r\nthrough such regional arrangements”. \r\n A/61/PV.38\r\n \r\n27 06-58069 \r\n \r\n Thirdly, financial support for training and \r\nexchange of expertise on the ground is very important; \r\nsuch activities should take into account the \r\npeacekeeping experience the United Nations has \r\nacquired. That support should build capacity in the \r\nareas of disarmament, demobilization and \r\nreintegration, activities which need significant \r\nresources and capacity. \r\n Fourthly, it is crucial to have special support for \r\nproactive monitoring and early warning systems for the \r\nprevention of conflicts or anything that endangers \r\ninternational peace and security within the specialized \r\nroles of regional organizations.  \r\n These organizations have to play a greater role in \r\nenshrining these principles of coexistence and \r\ncollective security. The signing on 9 January 2006 of \r\nthe Comprehensive Peace Agreement between the \r\nSudan and the Sudan People’s Liberation Army is \r\nproof of the peacebuilding capacity and effectiveness \r\nof regional organizations when they receive \r\ninternational support, particularly from the United \r\nNations, donor nations and influential partners.  \r\n The signing of the Darfur Peace Agreement is \r\nfurther proof of the capacity of African States to build \r\npeace. Clearly, the party that achieved the Peace \r\nAgreement — and that supported it when it was just a \r\ndream — is in the best position to ensure its \r\nimplementation, more so than any other party to the \r\nAgreement, particularly if it receives proper support \r\nwithin the context of international cooperation. \r\n Mr. Mansour (Islamic Republic of Iran): After \r\nsixty-one years of invaluable experience in the United \r\nNations system, many feel that regional arrangements \r\nplay a crucial role in the harmonization of nations \r\naround the globe and in giving shape to the provisions \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations and the decisions \r\nof its entities. Therefore, cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations system and regional organizations \r\ncould lead to greater effectiveness and efficiency of \r\nthose arrangements in achieving the goals they \r\nenvisaged. \r\n There is no doubt that any endeavour on the part \r\nof the United Nations to identify and remove barriers \r\nto cooperation will contribute to ensuring that this \r\nbody will meet the challenges it faces. In that context, I \r\nwould like to make several points concerning \r\ncooperation between the United Nations system and the \r\nEconomic Cooperation Organization (ECO), which was \r\ngranted observer status to the United Nations in 1993.  \r\n The Economic Cooperation Organization, whose \r\nmembership includes 10 countries in Central, Southern \r\nand Western Asia with a combined population of more \r\nthan 400 million people, has indeed entered a new era \r\nand is flourishing, as it develops new initiatives and \r\nprogrammes in the economic, social and environmental \r\nfields. \r\n The establishment of the ECO Trade and \r\nDevelopment Bank, the entry into force of the \r\nFramework Agreement on Transit Transportation, the \r\noperationalization of the ECO Fund for the \r\nReconstruction of Afghanistan and the reform in the \r\ninternal structure of ECO are among the most \r\nimportant and recent developments in the organization. \r\nThe signing of the ECO Trade Agreement by the \r\nmember States and its enforcement hopefully by the \r\nend of December 2006 will, it is hoped, make the year \r\n2006 a turning point in the history of the organization. \r\nThe Ministerial Meeting of ECO, held on \r\n26 September 2006 here in New York on the sidelines \r\nof the United Nations General Assembly, placed \r\nemphasis on the significance of the cooperation \r\nbetween ECO and the United Nations system. \r\n Fortunately, ECO member States have prepared \r\nthemselves for such cooperation by making the \r\ndecisions needed to strengthen relations between ECO \r\nand other regional and international organizations. \r\n Recently, the Council of Ministers adopted the \r\nframework of the ECO Plan of Action for the \r\nenhancement of ECO external relations. In addition, \r\nthe Department of Human Resources and Sustainable \r\nDevelopment was recently established in the ECO \r\nSecretariat. That measure is another step to follow up \r\non ECO-United Nations cooperation, particularly in the \r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) in the region. \r\n Implementation of the recommendations of the \r\nUnited Nations Secretary-General contained in \r\ndocument A/61/256 is crucial for the achievement of \r\nECO projects and programmes. In that document, the \r\nSecretary-General recommended that various \r\nspecialized agencies and other organizations and \r\nprogrammes of the United Nations system and relevant \r\ninternational financial institutions consolidate their \r\nefforts and extend technical and financial assistance \r\nA/61/PV.38  \r\n \r\n06-58069 28 \r\n \r\ntowards the implementation of ECO programmes and \r\nprojects. \r\n We firmly believe that consideration and adoption \r\nof the proposed draft resolution on cooperation \r\nbetween the Economic Cooperation Organization and \r\nthe United Nations, during the sixty-first session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, will be beneficial to the work of \r\nboth organizations. \r\n Mr. Awad (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): The \r\ndelegation of Egypt is honoured to introduce the draft \r\nresolution entitled “Cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the League of Arab States”, on behalf of \r\nthe following countries: Algeria, Bahrain, Comoros, \r\nDjibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libyan \r\nArab Jamahiriya, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, \r\nPalestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syrian \r\nArab Republic, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates and \r\nYemen. The draft resolution we have just submitted on \r\nbehalf of those Arab countries concerning cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the League of Arab \r\nStates recognizes the need to increase and strengthen \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nLeague of Arab States and its specialized agencies, in \r\norder to obtain the objectives shared by both \r\norganizations. We commend the efforts made by the \r\nLeague of Arab States to strengthen multilateral \r\ncooperation among Arab countries, and we urge the \r\nUnited Nations to continue supporting those efforts.  \r\n The objective of the draft resolution, as requested \r\nby the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the \r\nSecretary General of the League of Arab States, is to \r\ncontinue to work to strengthen cooperation between the \r\ntwo organizations in order to fulfil the purposes and \r\nprinciples stipulated in the United Nations Charter, as \r\nwell to strengthen international peace and security, \r\neconomic and social development and disarmament, \r\nand to put an end to colonization and to promote the \r\nright to self-determination and the elimination of all \r\nforms of racism and racial discrimination. \r\n We would urge all United Nations specialized \r\nagencies and funds and programmes to strengthen \r\ncooperation and dialogue between the United Nations \r\nand the Arab League, in particular in the priority \r\nsectors, namely; energy, rural development, combating \r\ndesertification, green belts, technical and professional \r\ntraining, the transfer of technology, the environment, \r\nthe media, trade, finance, water resources, agricultural \r\ndevelopment, the advancement of women, transport, \r\ncommunications and information, strengthening the \r\nprivate sector and strengthening and building capacity. \r\nLastly, the draft resolution calls for regular \r\nconsultation between representatives of the secretariats \r\nof the two organizations to review and strengthen \r\ncoordination mechanisms between the two \r\norganizations. \r\n I shall now discuss Egypt’s position concerning \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional \r\nand other organizations. Since Egypt is an African, \r\nArab and Islamic country, a founding member of the \r\nAfrican Union, the League of Arab States and the \r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference and a member \r\nof the International Organization of la Francophonie, \r\nwe are convinced of the importance of regional \r\ninteragency cooperation as the basis of multilateral \r\ninternational action. We therefore wish to stress the \r\nspecial importance of the Secretary-General’s report on \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional \r\nand other organizations (A/1/256) in the context of \r\nrapid international developments. Such cooperation \r\nrequires that we strengthen the concept of dialogue in \r\norder to prevent confrontation and war and to support \r\npeaceful coexistence at the political, economic and \r\nsocial levels. \r\n In that regard, I should like to focus on a number \r\nof areas of cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthese organizations and groupings that serve as \r\nexamples to guide us in attaining our objectives in \r\nvarious areas.  \r\n With regard to the economic and social aspects of \r\nsuch cooperation, it has become more urgent to \r\nstrengthen mechanisms for regional and subregional \r\ndialogue and cooperation to address the great \r\ndemographic growth that is now imposing a heavy \r\nburden on natural resources and their sustainability, \r\ncompared with what the world was like at the time \r\nwhen this Organization was founded. We will not be \r\nable to achieve security or stability unless there is \r\nsocio-economic development in Africa and on all other \r\ncontinents. \r\n We are following very closely the tireless efforts by \r\nUnited Nations programmes and funds throughout the \r\nworld, particularly in Africa. However, we wish to recall \r\nthat the African continent is the only region of the world \r\nthat will not be able to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals on time. That is why we would like \r\nthe Secretary-General to submit practical proposals \r\n A/61/PV.38\r\n \r\n29 06-58069 \r\n \r\naimed at strengthening inter-agency cooperation between \r\nUnited Nations bodies and those of the New Partnership \r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD) during the present \r\nGeneral Assembly session and next year’s. We expect the \r\nAssembly to honour the commitment undertaken at the \r\n2005 World Summit to support NEPAD and not hold \r\nback the financing of that task when the Organization’s \r\nprogramme budget is adopted, so that commitments \r\nundertaken in other forums can be implemented. \r\n At the political level, with regard to strengthening \r\nthe concept of collective security from a regional \r\nperspective, the African continent is in urgent need of \r\ncapacity-building in the area of peacekeeping. We hope \r\nthat the Secretary-General will submit a comprehensive \r\nstudy on the 10-year programme adopted at the 2005 \r\nSummit to build Africa’s peacekeeping capacity. That is \r\nessential not only to restore stability, but also to \r\nstrengthen African ownership of the process of conflict \r\nmanagement and settlement. In addition, the \r\nestablishment of the Peacebuilding Commission, the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund, the United Nations Democracy \r\nFund and the Central Emergency Response Fund will \r\nhelp to promote democratic change and economic and \r\nsocial development in Africa. We therefore look forward \r\nto cooperation and complementarity between all those \r\nmechanisms and the relevant African institutions, \r\nincluding the African Union, NEPAD and the Economic \r\nCommission for Africa. \r\n Cooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nLeague of Arab States is key to the strengthening of \r\ndialogue and cooperation in a vital area stretching from \r\nthe Arab Gulf to the Atlantic Ocean, through 22 Arab \r\nStates. Those States are within the mandate of two \r\nregional United Nations commissions — the Economic \r\nand Social Commission for Western Asia, and the \r\nEconomic Commission for Africa. In addition to the \r\npolitical cooperation between those two bodies, which \r\ndates back to their establishment, those efforts include \r\nmanaging the conflicts in the Middle East, including the \r\nArab-Israeli conflict, and addressing the situations in the \r\nSudan, Iraq and the Horn of Africa. Cooperation also \r\nincludes information technology, empowerment of \r\nwomen, the fight against HIV/AIDS, and other \r\ndevelopment areas referred to in the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport. \r\n We emphasize the importance of cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the Arab League with a \r\nview to strengthening dialogue and contacts in various \r\nareas of common interest, particularly Arab-African, \r\nArab-Latin American and Arab-Chinese cooperation and \r\nother transregional cooperation frameworks that \r\nstrengthen contacts among States, peoples and cultures. \r\n There are now more than 1.2 billion Muslims \r\nthroughout the world. They are brought together under \r\nthe umbrella of the Organization of the Islamic \r\nConference (OIC), which has become a main framework \r\nfor cooperation. Those relations are strengthened through \r\nthe United Nations at a time when the tone of militancy \r\nin the dialogue among cultures and religions is \r\nintensifying. The OIC seeks to strengthen the settlement \r\nof differences and explain different conceptions and \r\nvisions in order to bring people together in tolerance and \r\npeaceful coexistence. Joint efforts must be undertaken to \r\naddress the great apprehension of Muslims in the East \r\nand the West with regard to religious discrimination. The \r\nOIC is playing a major role in that regard, which, \r\ntogether with its role of promoting peace, will enable it \r\nto serve as an institutional donor to the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission. The OIC is also playing an important role \r\nin South-South cooperation within the United Nations. \r\n Among the member States of the International \r\nOrganization of la Francophonie, Egypt is one of the \r\nlargest troop contributors to United Nations \r\npeacekeeping operations. We would like to see greater \r\ncooperation in that regard in relation to conflict \r\nprevention and peaceful dispute settlement, which is a \r\ncommon denominator of United Nations action.  \r\n The delegation of Egypt was a sponsor of the draft \r\nresolution on cooperation between the United Nations \r\nand the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) (A/61/L.6), \r\nwhich was introduced a short while ago by the \r\nrepresentative of Italy. Cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the IPU has become a tangible element \r\nenshrined in General Assembly resolutions and in action \r\ncarried out in accordance with a programme established \r\nat the level of the parliaments of member States to bring \r\nviews closer together and to clarify different \r\nconceptions. Hope was expressed at the 2005 World \r\nSummit that such cooperation could be strengthened. \r\nThat hope was echoed recently in resolution 60/286, on \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly. \r\n Strengthening the dialogue between the General \r\nAssembly and the IPU in political affairs will have a \r\npositive impact with regard to the situation in the Middle \r\nEast, Iraq, the Sudan and Afghanistan. It will support the \r\nOrganization’s efforts to reach a political settlement to \r\nthose problems, which are destroying lives and property \r\nA/61/PV.38  \r\n \r\n06-58069 30 \r\n \r\nat a time when the world’s peoples aspire to freedom, \r\njustice and development in accordance with their own \r\nvision and their free will. \r\n We also welcome dialogue between the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union and United Nations bodies such as \r\nthe Human Rights Council and the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission and other international forums, including \r\nthe General Assembly and the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil. \r\n Lastly, we would like to express our hope that the \r\nforthcoming report of the Secretary-General will contain \r\npractical and enforceable proposals on cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and all regional and other \r\norganizations and that the proposals in the report will not \r\nbe limited to the Inter-Parliamentary Union only. Such \r\ncooperation should be strengthened through annual \r\ndialogue between the General Assembly and heads of the \r\nregional organizations and their secretariats. This will \r\nhelp to enrich cooperation in all its aspects. \r\n Mr. Liu Zhenmin (China) (spoke in Chinese): As \r\nglobalization grows ever more deeply rooted, our world \r\nis getting smaller and smaller, with more and more \r\nproblems that call for concerted action by all countries. \r\nAs the most representative international organization, the \r\nUnited Nations is now facing a greater need to \r\nstrengthen its cooperation with regional and other \r\ninternational organizations to promote world peace and \r\nsecurity and the common development of humankind. \r\nFor this reason, the Chinese delegation welcomes the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s deliberations on this important \r\nagenda item, “Cooperation between the United Nations \r\nand regional and other organizations”. \r\n Allow me to comment, in particular, on the \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the Asian-\r\nAfrican Legal Consultative Organization (AALCO). \r\nAALCO is the only intergovernmental legal consultative \r\norganization in the Asian and African region. Here, we \r\ncannot fail to recall the famous Bandung Conference, \r\nheld some 50 years ago: AALCO represents one of its \r\nmost significant achievements. Over the years, the spirit \r\nof unity, friendship and cooperation advocated by the \r\nBandung Conference has been a source of inspiration for \r\nAsian and African countries. \r\n This year marks the fiftieth anniversary of \r\nAALCO. At its forty-fifth annual session last April, \r\nmember States gathered together to celebrate the \r\n \r\noccasion. Several months have elapsed, but the fond \r\nmemory lingers. As a regional organization operating in \r\nthe legal field, AALCO has been carrying forward the \r\nBandung spirit over the past 50 years in providing a \r\nforum for exchanges and cooperation on international \r\nlegal matters among Asian and African countries and \r\nassisting them in engaging in international legal \r\npractices, while promoting, through its activities, the \r\nprogressive development and codification of \r\ninternational law. \r\n Over the years, AALCO has been following the \r\nwork of the Sixth Committee and the International Law \r\nCommission. Many important international legal issues \r\nhave been the subject of focused discussions in the \r\norganization, including the work of the International Law \r\nCommission, the Law of the Sea, international \r\ncooperation in combating trafficking in women and \r\nchildren, international legal instruments in the \r\nanticorruption field, measures to eliminate international \r\nterrorism, and the World Trade Organization’s \r\nframework agreements as a code of conduct for world \r\ntrade. The comments or proposals by AALCO on these \r\nquestions have served as an important reference for \r\nAsian and African countries participating in related \r\nGeneral Assembly deliberations, and even for the work \r\nof other legal organs of the United Nations. \r\n In today’s world, Asian and African countries have \r\nmade significant progress in political, economic and \r\nsocial areas, concurrent with a marked elevation of their \r\nstanding and role in international affairs. They have \r\nbecome an important force for world peace and common \r\ndevelopment. Accordingly, Asian and African countries \r\nwill continuously broaden their participation in \r\ninternational legal affairs and take a more effective part \r\nin the process of democratization and rule of law \r\ngoverning international relations. As a legal consultative \r\norganization of Asian and African countries, AALCO is \r\npoised to play a more active role in this regard. \r\n As a member State of both the United Nations and \r\nAALCO, China attaches great importance to the AALCO \r\nand is most supportive of its work. I wish hereby to \r\nreaffirm that the Chinese Government will, as always, \r\ncontinue to contribute to the close cooperation between \r\nAALCO and the United Nations and other related \r\norganizations. \r\n The meeting rose at 1.05 p.m. \r\n"
