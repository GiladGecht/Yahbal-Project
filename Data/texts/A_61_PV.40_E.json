This thirty-sixth round of \r\nballoting, in accordance with rule 94 of the rules of \r\nprocedure, will also be the seventeenth unrestricted \r\nballot. \r\n For this thirty-sixth round of balloting, may I \r\nremind the Assembly that any Member State from \r\namong the Latin American and Caribbean States may \r\nbe a candidate except those outgoing members and \r\nthose already members of the Security Council, namely, \r\nArgentina and Peru. \r\n Before we begin the voting process, I should like \r\nto remind members that pursuant to rule 88 of the rules \r\nof procedure of the General Assembly, no \r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting except on a \r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the voting. \r\n We shall now begin the voting process. Members \r\nare requested to remain seated until all ballots have \r\nbeen collected. \r\n Ballot papers marked “B” will now be distributed. \r\nMay I ask representatives to write on the ballot papers \r\nmarked “B” for the Latin American and Caribbean \r\nStates the name of the one State for which they wish to \r\nvote. Ballot papers marked “B” will be declared invalid \r\nif they contain the name of more than one State as well \r\nas if they contain the name of a Member State that does \r\nnot belong to that region. \r\n At the invitation of the President, Mr. Jumat \r\n(Brunei Darussalam), Mr. Sepúlveda (Chile), \r\nMrs. Cerere (Kenya), Ms. Klausa (Poland) and \r\nMr. Flueck (Switzerland) acted as tellers. \r\n A vote was taken by secret ballot. \r\n The meeting was suspended at 3.20 p.m. and \r\nresumed at 3.55 p.m. \r\n The President: The result of the voting is as \r\nfollows: \r\n Group B – Latin American and Caribbean States \r\nNumber of ballot papers:   187 \r\nNumber of invalid ballots:   0 \r\nNumber of valid ballots:   187 \r\nAbstentions:     6 \r\nRequired two-thirds majority:  121 \r\nNumber of votes obtained: \r\n Guatemala     109 \r\n Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) 72 \r\nA/61/PV.40  \r\n \r\n06-58500 2 \r\n \r\n Since the result of the ballot has been \r\ninconclusive, there still remains one seat to be filled \r\nfrom among the Latin American and Caribbean States. \r\nWe must therefore proceed to the eighteenth \r\nunrestricted ballot. \r\n For this thirty-seventh round of balloting, may I \r\nremind the Assembly that any Member State from \r\namong the Latin American and Caribbean States may \r\nbe a candidate except those outgoing members and \r\nthose already members of the Security Council, namely \r\nArgentina and Peru.  \r\n We shall now begin the voting process.
