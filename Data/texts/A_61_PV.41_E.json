(Bahrain) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 3.20 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 7 (continued) \r\n \r\nOrganization of work, adoption of the agenda and \r\nallocation of items \r\n \r\n  Third report of the General Committee \r\n(A/61/250/Add.2) \r\n \r\n The President: In its report, the General \r\nCommittee recommends to the General Assembly that \r\nagenda item 68, entitled “Report of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil”, be considered in plenary meeting and in the \r\nThird Committee, on the understanding that the Third \r\nCommittee would consider and act on all \r\nrecommendations of the Human Rights Council to the \r\nGeneral Assembly, including those that deal with the \r\nDevelopment of International Law in the field of \r\nhuman rights. \r\n Taking into account this recommendation, the \r\nGeneral Assembly plenary would consider the Annual \r\nReport of the Human Rights Council on its activities \r\nfor the year, and also on the understanding that the \r\ndivision of work between them was agreed upon with \r\nthe understanding that this arrangement is due to the \r\nfact that the Human Rights Council only commenced \r\nits work in June 2006. \r\n It is also understood that the current arrangement \r\nis in no way a reinterpretation of Assembly resolution \r\n60/251 and will be reviewed before the beginning of \r\nthe sixty-second session, on the basis of the experience \r\ngained with the efficiency and practicality of this \r\narrangement. \r\n May I therefore take it that the General Assembly \r\napproves that recommendation? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President: The Chairman of the Third \r\nCommittee will be informed of the decision just taken \r\nby the General Assembly. \r\n \r\n  Documentation for the election of the members \r\nof the International Law Commission  \r\n(item 105 (c)) \r\n \r\n The President: As was announced at the 38th \r\nmeeting, on Friday, 20 October 2006, I would now like \r\nto consult the General Assembly on a matter \r\nconcerning sub-item (c) of agenda item 105, on the \r\nelection of the members of the International Law \r\nCommission, which has been scheduled to take place \r\non Thursday, 16 November 2006. \r\n On that day the Assembly will proceed to the \r\nelection of 34 members of the Commission, whose \r\nterms of office are to commence on 1 January 2007. It \r\nshould be recalled that, in accordance with the Statute \r\nof the International Law Commission, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral communicated to the Governments of Member \r\nStates, in documents A/61/92 and A/61/92/Corr.1, the \r\nlist of candidates submitted within the required time \r\nfor the submission of nominations, that is, by 1 June \r\n2006, as well as a withdrawal in document \r\nA/61/92/Add.1. The statements of qualifications of the \r\nA/61/PV.41  \r\n \r\n06-58718 2 \r\n \r\ncandidates are contained in documents A/61/111 and \r\nA/61/111/Corr.1, A/61/111/Corr.2 and A/61/111/Add.1.  \r\n Subsequent to that date, the Secretary-General \r\nreceived additional information on nominations \r\nconcerning candidates, new candidates and a \r\nwithdrawal. The names of the new candidates and \r\nadditional information are to be found in documents \r\nA/61/92/Add.2 and A/61/92/Add.3. \r\n Under those circumstances, it is necessary for the \r\nGeneral Assembly to take a decision as to whether the \r\nnew candidatures should be accepted in spite of the \r\nsubmission of their names subsequent to the deadline, \r\nand whether they should be incorporated into a \r\nconsolidated list of candidates. It has been the practice \r\nof the Assembly to incorporate such late submissions \r\ninto a consolidated list. \r\n If I hear no objection, I shall take it that it is the \r\nwish of the General Assembly to request the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to issue such a consolidated list of candidates. \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President: The consolidated list of \r\ncandidates will be issued under the symbol A/61/539. \r\n \r\n  Letter from the Chairman of the Committee on \r\nConferences addressed to the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly (A/61/320/Add.1) \r\n \r\n The President: Document A/61/320/Add.1 \r\ncontains a letter dated 19 October 2006 from the \r\nChairman of the Committee on Conferences addressed \r\nto the President of the General Assembly. Members are \r\naware that, pursuant to section 1, paragraph 7 of \r\nresolution 40/243, no subsidiary organ of the General \r\nAssembly should be permitted to meet at Headquarters \r\nduring the main part of a regular session of the \r\nAssembly, unless explicitly authorized by the \r\nAssembly. \r\n Authorization is therefore sought for the \r\nExecutive Board of the International Research and \r\nTraining Institute for the Advancement of Women to \r\nhold one meeting in New York during the main part of \r\nthe sixty-first session of the General Assembly, on the \r\nstrict understanding that the meeting will have to be \r\naccommodated when facilities and services can be \r\nmade available without adversely affecting the \r\nactivities of the General Assembly and its Main \r\nCommittees. It is also the understanding that \r\neverything possible will be done to ensure the most \r\nefficient use of conference services. \r\n May I take it that it is the wish of the General \r\nAssembly to authorize the Executive Board of the \r\nInternational Research and Training Institute for the \r\nAdvancement of Women to meet during the main part \r\nof the sixty-first session of the General Assembly? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 70 \r\n \r\nReport of the International Court of Justice \r\n \r\n  Report of the International Court of Justice \r\n(A/61/4) \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/61/380) \r\n \r\n The President: May I take it that the General \r\nAssembly takes note of the report of the International \r\nCourt of Justice? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President: In connection with this item, the \r\nAssembly also has before it the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the Secretary-General’s Trust Fund to \r\nAssist States in the Settlement of Disputes through the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, which has been \r\ncirculated in document A/61/380. \r\n I call on Ms. Rosalyn Higgins, President of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice. \r\n Ms. Higgins: It is an honour for me to address \r\nthe General Assembly for the first time in my \r\npresidency on the occasion of the Assembly’s \r\nexamination of the report of the International Court of \r\nJustice for the period 1 August 2005 to 31 July 2006. \r\nSpeaking to the General Assembly on the Court’s \r\nreport is a tradition initiated by Sir Robert Jennings \r\nduring his presidency. It is one that I am happy to \r\nmaintain and that the Court greatly values. \r\n I am pleased to address the Assembly today under \r\nthe presidency of the Legal Adviser to the Royal Court \r\nin the Kingdom of Bahrain. I warmly congratulate you, \r\nMadam President, on your election to preside over the \r\nsixty-first session, and wish you every success. \r\n I begin by recalling that currently 192 States are \r\nparties to the Statute of the Court, and that 67 of them \r\nhave accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court \r\nin accordance with Article 36, paragraph 2, of the \r\n A/61/PV.41\r\n \r\n3 06-58718 \r\n \r\nStatute. Furthermore, approximately 300 treaties refer \r\nto the Court in relation to the settlement of disputes \r\narising from their application or interpretation. \r\n As the annual report of the Court transmitted to \r\nthe General Assembly recounts, in the period from \r\n1 August 2005 to 31 July 2006 the Court made an order \r\nwith respect to a request for provisional measures in \r\none case, held public hearings in two cases, and \r\nrendered Judgments in two further cases. It should be \r\nunderstood that the cases of Armed Activities on the \r\nTerritory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo v. Uganda) and Application of the Convention \r\non the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of \r\nGenocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and \r\nMontenegro) have been exceptionally heavy, legally \r\nspeaking, and complex in a variety of ways. Several \r\ncases are contained within each head case. The Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro case \r\nrequired public hearings that stretched over two and a \r\nhalf months. The Court has sifted through vast amounts \r\nof documentary and audiovisual evidence, and heard \r\nwitness testimony in the courtroom for the first time \r\nsince 1991. \r\n During the period under review the Court has \r\nbeen seized of three new cases: a dispute regarding \r\nnavigational and related rights between Costa Rica and \r\nNicaragua; a dispute regarding the status of a \r\ndiplomatic envoy to the United Nations vis-à-vis the \r\nhost State, between the Commonwealth of Dominica \r\nand Switzerland; and a dispute concerning pulp mills \r\non the River Uruguay between Argentina and Uruguay. \r\nFollowing a further request from the Commonwealth of \r\nDominica, the case against Switzerland was in fact \r\nremoved from the Court’s List.  \r\n Today there are 13 cases in the General List of \r\nthe Court, following the entering in the General List in \r\nAugust this year of an application from the Republic of \r\nDjibouti instituting proceedings against France. The \r\napplication was made by Djibouti in January this year. \r\nOn 10 August France consented to the Court’s \r\njurisdiction for this specific dispute in accordance with \r\nArticle 38, paragraph 5, of the Rules of Court. That is \r\nonly the second instance since the adoption, in 1978, of \r\nArticle 38, paragraph 5, in which a State has accepted \r\nanother State’s invitation to recognize the jurisdiction \r\nof the International Court to deal with a case against it. \r\n The cases come from all over the world. There \r\nare four between European States, four between Latin \r\nAmerican States, two between African States, one \r\nbetween Asian States and two of an intercontinental \r\ncharacter. The Court’s international character is also \r\nreflected in its composition. Following the elections \r\nheld last autumn by the General Assembly and the \r\nSecurity Council, the Court currently has the benefit of \r\nmembers from China, France, Germany, Japan, Jordan, \r\nMadagascar, Morocco, Mexico, New Zealand, the \r\nRussian Federation, Sierra Leone, Slovakia, the United \r\nKingdom, the United States of America and Venezuela. \r\n The subject matter of the cases before the Court \r\nis extremely varied. As is frequently the case, the \r\nCourt’s docket contains a number of cases concerning \r\nterritorial disputes between neighbouring States \r\nseeking a determination of their land and maritime \r\nboundaries, or a decision as to which of them has \r\nsovereignty over particular areas. That is the position \r\nfor five cases concerning, respectively, Nicaragua and \r\nHonduras, Nicaragua and Colombia, Malaysia and \r\nSingapore, Romania and Ukraine and Costa Rica and \r\nNicaragua. Another classic type of dispute is where a \r\nState complains of the treatment of its nationals by \r\nother States. That is the position in the cases of the \r\nRepublic of Guinea against the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo, the Republic of the Congo against France, \r\nand the Republic of Djibouti against France. Those last \r\ntwo cases also raise issues relating to jurisdictional \r\nimmunities of State officials. \r\n A further category of cases that is frequently \r\nreferred to the Court concerns the use of force and \r\nevents that the Assembly or the Security Council have \r\nhad to address. At the moment the Court is deliberating \r\non a case in which Bosnia and Herzegovina seeks the \r\ncondemnation of Serbia and Montenegro for violations \r\nof the 1948 United Nations Convention on the \r\nPrevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. \r\nThe Court is further seized of a similar claim brought \r\nby Croatia against Serbia and Montenegro. \r\n Today I plan, as is traditional, to report on the \r\nJudgments rendered by the International Court over the \r\npast year. I shall deal with those decisions in \r\nchronological order. I have had the occasion to deal \r\nwith some of these legal issues in more depth with the \r\nlegal advisers at their meeting. Should any specific \r\npoints be of particular interest, members will be able to \r\nsee them discussed in that speech. \r\n On 19 December 2005 the Court handed down its \r\nJudgment in the case concerning Armed Activities on \r\nA/61/PV.41  \r\n \r\n06-58718 4 \r\n \r\nthe Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo v. Uganda). By way of background, on 23 June \r\n1999 the Democratic Republic of the Congo filed an \r\napplication instituting proceedings against Uganda for \r\n“acts of armed aggression perpetrated in flagrant \r\nviolation of the United Nations Charter and of the \r\nCharter of the OAU”. In its application, the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo contended that \r\n “such armed aggression ... [had] involved inter \r\nalia violation of the sovereignty and territorial \r\nintegrity of the [Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo], violations of international humanitarian \r\nlaw and massive human rights violations”. \r\n Uganda disputed the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo’s claim, and counterclaimed, on 21 April 2001, \r\nthat the Democratic Republic of the Congo had \r\ncommitted acts of aggression against it, had attacked \r\nUgandan diplomatic premises and personnel in \r\nKinshasa as well as other Ugandan nationals, and had \r\nviolated the Lusaka Agreement. By an Order of \r\n29 November 2001, the Court found that the first two \r\ncounterclaims were admissible, but that the third was \r\nnot. \r\n In its Judgment on the merits, the Court started \r\nby noting that it was aware of the complex and tragic \r\nsituation that had long prevailed in the Great Lakes \r\nregion and of the suffering of the local population. It \r\nobserved that the instability in the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo in particular had had negative \r\nsecurity implications for Uganda and some other \r\nneighbouring States. However, it stated that its task \r\nwas to respond, on the basis of international law, to the \r\nparticular legal dispute brought before it.  \r\n The Court treated first the question of the \r\ninvasion of the Democratic Republic of the Congo by \r\nUganda. Having examined the materials put before it \r\nby the parties, the Court found that in the period \r\npreceding August 1998 the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo had not objected to Uganda’s military presence \r\nand activities in its eastern border area. The two \r\ncountries had, among other things, agreed that their \r\nrespective armies would “cooperate in order to ensure \r\nsecurity and peace along the common border”. The \r\nCourt, however, drew attention to the fact that the \r\nconsent that had been given to Uganda to place its \r\nforces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and to \r\nengage in military operations, was not an open-ended \r\nconsent. It was limited in terms of objectives and \r\ngeographic location to actions directed at stopping \r\nrebels operating across the common border. It did not \r\nconstitute a consent to all that was to follow. \r\n The Court examined carefully the various treaties \r\ndirected to achieving and maintaining a ceasefire, the \r\nwithdrawal of foreign forces and the stabilization of \r\nrelations. It concluded that none of those instruments, \r\nsave for the limited exception regarding the border \r\nregion of the Ruwenzori mountains contained in the \r\nLuanda Agreement, constituted consent by the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo to the presence of \r\nUgandan troops on its territory.  \r\n The Court also rejected Uganda’s claim that its \r\nuse of force, where not covered by consent, was an \r\nexercise of self-defence. The preconditions for self-\r\ndefence did not exist. Indeed, the unlawful military \r\nintervention by Uganda was of such magnitude and \r\nduration that the Court considered it to be a grave \r\nviolation of the prohibition on the use of force \r\nexpressed in Article 2, paragraph 4, of the Charter. The \r\nCourt also found that by actively extending military, \r\nlogistic, economic and financial support to irregular \r\nforces having operated on the territory of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, the Republic of \r\nUganda had violated the principle of non-use of force \r\nin international relations and the principle of non-\r\nintervention. \r\n The Court then moved to the legal issue of \r\noccupation and of the violations of human rights and \r\nhumanitarian law. It observed first that, under \r\ncustomary international law, as reflected in article 42 \r\nof the Hague Regulations of 1907, territory is \r\nconsidered to be occupied when it is actually placed \r\nunder the authority of the hostile army, and the \r\noccupation extends only to the territory where such \r\nauthority has been established and can be exercised. \r\nHaving concluded that Uganda was the occupying \r\nPower in Ituri at the relevant time, the Court stated \r\nthat, as such, it was under an obligation, according to \r\narticle 43 of the Hague Regulations, to take all \r\nmeasures in its power to restore and ensure, as far as \r\npossible, public order and safety in the occupied area, \r\nwhile respecting, unless absolutely prevented, the laws \r\nin force in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. That \r\nhad not been done. The Court also considered that it \r\nhad credible evidence sufficient to conclude that the \r\nUganda People’s Defence Forces (UPDF) troops had \r\ngenerally in the Democratic Republic of the Congo \r\nengaged in various violations of international \r\n A/61/PV.41\r\n \r\n5 06-58718 \r\n \r\nhumanitarian law and human rights law. The details are \r\nspecified in the Judgment. Those violations were found \r\nto be attributable to Uganda. \r\n The third issue the Court had to deal with was \r\nthat of the alleged exploitation of natural resources by \r\nUganda. The Court considered that it had ample, \r\ncredible and persuasive evidence to conclude that \r\nofficers and soldiers of the UPDF, including the most \r\nhigh-ranking officers, were involved in the looting, \r\nplundering and exploitation of the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo’s natural resources, and that the \r\nmilitary authorities did not take any measures to put an \r\nend to those acts. Uganda was responsible for both the \r\nconduct of the UPDF as a whole and the conduct of \r\nindividual soldiers and officers of the UPDF in the \r\nterritory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. \r\nThat was so even when particular UPDF officers and \r\nsoldiers acted contrary to instructions given, or \r\nexceeded their authority. The Court found that it did \r\nnot have at its disposal credible evidence to prove that \r\nthere was a governmental policy on the part of Uganda \r\ndirected at the exploitation of the natural resources of \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, or that \r\nUganda’s military intervention was carried out in order \r\nto obtain access to Congolese resources. \r\n In respect of the counterclaims of Uganda, the \r\nCourt found first that Uganda had not produced \r\nsufficient evidence to show that the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo had provided political and \r\nmilitary support to anti-Ugandan rebel groups \r\noperating in its territory. The Court added that any \r\nmilitary action taken by the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo against Uganda after the invasion by \r\nUganda in 1998 would be justified as action taken in \r\nself-defence under Article 51 of the United Nations \r\nCharter. \r\n As for the second counterclaim, the Court found \r\nthat there was sufficient evidence to prove the attacks \r\nagainst the embassy and the maltreatment of Ugandan \r\ndiplomats on embassy premises and at Ndjili \r\nInternational Airport. It found that the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo had breached its obligations \r\nunder the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. \r\nThe removal of property and archives from the \r\nUgandan embassy was also in violation of the rules of \r\ninternational law on diplomatic relations. \r\n The Court noted that the nature, form and amount \r\nof compensation owed by each party had been reserved \r\nand would only be submitted to the Court should the \r\nparties be unable now to reach agreement on the basis \r\nof the Judgment just rendered by the Court. \r\n The period 2005-2006 turned out to be very much \r\nan African year for the Court. Less than two months \r\nafter issuing its decision in Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo v. Uganda, on 3 February 2006, the Court \r\nrendered its judgment on the preliminary objections to \r\njurisdiction and admissibility raised by Rwanda in the \r\ncase concerning Armed Activities on the Territory of \r\nthe Congo (New Application: 2002) (Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo v. Rwanda). It found that here it \r\nhad no jurisdiction to entertain the application filed by \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo. \r\n The background was the filing, in 2002, by the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo of an application \r\nalleging  \r\n “massive, serious and flagrant violations of \r\nhuman rights and of international humanitarian \r\nlaw resulting from acts of armed aggression \r\nperpetrated by Rwanda on the territory of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo in flagrant \r\nviolation of the sovereignty and territorial \r\nintegrity of the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo, as guaranteed by the United Nations and \r\nOAU Charters”. \r\n The Court’s deliberations mainly turned on the \r\ninterpretation of particular jurisdictional provisions and \r\non the analysis of requirements they contained. The \r\nCourt essentially found that the international \r\ninstruments invoked by the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo could not be relied on, as either Rwanda was \r\nnot a party to them, or had made reservations to them, \r\nor other preconditions for seizing of the Court had not \r\nbeen satisfied. \r\n As the Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the \r\napplication, it was not required to rule on the \r\napplication’s admissibility. The Court was mindful that \r\nthe subject matter was very close to Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo v. Uganda and that it needed to \r\nbe carefully explained as to why the Court did not \r\nproceed to the merits in this case. The Court explained \r\nthat it was precluded by its Statute from taking any \r\nposition on the merits of the claims made by the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. However, the \r\nCourt reiterated that there was \r\nA/61/PV.41  \r\n \r\n06-58718 6 \r\n \r\n “a fundamental distinction between the \r\nacceptance by States of the Court’s jurisdiction \r\nand the conformity of their acts with international \r\nlaw … whether or not States have accepted the \r\njurisdiction of the Court, they are required to \r\nfulfil their obligations under the United Nations \r\nCharter and the other rules of international law, \r\nincluding international humanitarian and human \r\nrights law, and they remain responsible for acts \r\nattributable to them which are contrary to \r\ninternational law.” (A/61/4, para. 16) \r\n Finally, on 13 July this year, the Court handed \r\ndown its Order for the indication of provisional \r\nmeasures in the case concerning Pulp Mills on the \r\nRiver Uruguay (Argentina v. Uruguay). \r\n Early in May this year Argentina initiated \r\nproceedings against Uruguay concerning alleged \r\nviolations by Uruguay of obligations under the Statute \r\nof the River Uruguay, a treaty signed by the two States \r\nin 1975. Argentina’s application was accompanied by a \r\nrequest for the indication of provisional measures \r\nrequiring Uruguay, first, to suspend the authorizations \r\nfor the construction of the mills and halt building work \r\non them pending a final decision by the Court, and, \r\nsecondly, to cooperate with Argentina to protect and \r\npreserve the aquatic environment of the River Uruguay, \r\nto refrain from taking any further unilateral action with \r\nrespect to construction of the two mills which does not \r\ncomply with the 1975 Statute, and to refrain from any \r\nother action which might aggravate the dispute or \r\nrender its settlement more difficult. \r\n In its Order, the Court found that there was \r\nnothing in the record to demonstrate that the very \r\ndecision by Uruguay to authorize the construction of \r\nthe mills posed an imminent threat of irreparable \r\ndamage to the aquatic environment or to the economic \r\nand social interests of the riparian inhabitants. On the \r\nbasis of the evidence before it, the Court was not \r\nconvinced that the rights claimed by Argentina would \r\nno longer be capable of protection if the Court were to \r\ndecide not to indicate at this stage of the proceedings \r\nthe suspension of the authorizations and of the \r\nconstruction work itself. At the same time, the Court \r\nmade it clear that, by proceeding with the work, \r\nUruguay “necessarily bears all risks relating to any \r\nfinding on the merits that the Court might later make” \r\nand that the construction of the mills at the current site \r\ncould not be deemed to create a fait accompli. The \r\nCourt specifically states that the decision in the present \r\nproceedings in no way prejudges questions relating to \r\nthe merits of the case. The parties retain the right to \r\nsubmit arguments in respect of the substance of the \r\ncase in further stages of the proceedings. \r\n As well as delivering these Judgments and Order, \r\nthe Court has completed the hearings in the case \r\nconcerning Application of the Convention on the \r\nPrevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide \r\n(Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro) \r\nand it is currently under deliberation. In the [run-up to \r\nthe case, the Court had made preparatory proposals on, \r\ninter alia, whether witness examination should be \r\npreceded with affidavits, how to organize the cross-\r\nexamination, how to secure the confidentiality of the \r\ntestimony during the hearings, what type of translation \r\nto provide for the witnesses and for the Court, and yet \r\nmore. Very particular arrangements had to be made \r\nwith the press. This case is heavy and complex in a \r\nvariety of ways. It includes what are called several \r\n“sub-cases” and involves an unprecedented amount of \r\nfacts and evidence requiring detailed and systematic \r\nanalysis.  \r\n Although the hearings have been mainly focused \r\non the merits of the case, a number of jurisdictional \r\nissues were discussed by the Parties as a result of \r\nvarious developments since the Court delivered its \r\nJudgment on jurisdiction and admissibility in 1996, \r\nand particularly the implications of the admission of \r\nthe then Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to the United \r\nNations in 2000. \r\n I turn to what is next on the horizon for the \r\nInternational Court. Next month we begin public \r\nhearings on preliminary objections in the case \r\nconcerning Ahmadou Sadio Diallo (Republic of Guinea \r\nv. Democratic Republic of the Congo). Next March the \r\nCourt will hear a case on the merits: Maritime \r\nDelimitation between Nicaragua and Honduras in the \r\nCaribbean Sea (Nicaragua v. Honduras). After that the \r\nCourt will hear preliminary objections in the case \r\nTerritorial and Maritime Dispute (Nicaragua \r\nv. Colombia) and arguments on the merits in the case \r\nconcerning Sovereignty over Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu \r\nPuteh, Middle Rocks and South Ledge \r\n(Malaysia/Singapore). \r\n Our aim is to increase further our throughput in \r\nthe coming year. To this end, the Court has agreed for \r\nnext year upon a very full schedule of hearings and \r\ndeliberations, with more than one case being in \r\n A/61/PV.41\r\n \r\n7 06-58718 \r\n \r\nprogress at all times. In this context, I draw attention to \r\none request we will present in our budget submission. \r\nThe Court’s budgetary requests are always modest, and \r\nour requests for 2008 to 2009 will be particularly \r\nrestrained. But there is one matter that is very \r\nimportant to us: the Court will request nine P-2 law \r\nclerks, which will enable us to achieve a full \r\ncomplement of one law clerk for each member of the \r\nCourt. \r\n This matter was raised by President Schwebel \r\neight long years ago, and was the subject of a specific \r\nrequest made six long years ago by President \r\nGuillaume. At that time, he pointed to the fact that each \r\njudge has to examine case files which regularly run to \r\nseveral thousand pages and to conduct hearings that are \r\nsometimes unavoidably lengthy. The situation is even \r\nmore pressing today, given the increasing number of \r\nfact-intensive cases and the rising importance of \r\nresearching, analysing and evaluating not only \r\ndoctrinal materials, but also the applicable \r\njurisprudence of other international tribunals as well as \r\nthe testimony as to alleged facts.  \r\n The Court wishes to provide its Judgments in a \r\ntimely fashion, but it is simply impossible for it to do \r\nso if the judges have no assistance across this range of \r\nwork. We can no longer scrape by on a small pool of \r\nsix shared clerks. At the end of the day, this shortage of \r\nassistance is harmful to the client States which use us. \r\nThe absence of clerks is judicially inefficient, and this \r\nfact seems everywhere recognized. It is, in reality, \r\nastounding that the International Court is the only \r\nsenior international court without this form of \r\nassistance.  \r\n Each judge of the European Court of Justice is \r\nassisted by three law clerks. Each of the 16 judges at \r\nthe International Criminal Tribunal for the former \r\nYugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Criminal \r\nTribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) has one law clerk \r\nassigned to him or her, and there is at least one \r\n“floating” law clerk assigned to the Chamber. The \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) has provided one \r\nlaw clerk for each of its 18 judges. Quite simply, the \r\nInternational Court of Justice can no longer provide the \r\nservice that Member States bringing cases desire, if it, \r\nas the principal judicial organ of the United Nations, is \r\ndenied what is routinely accorded to every other senior \r\ncourt, national as well as international. \r\n The International Court has been continuing to \r\nreview its procedures and working methods. In \r\nSeptember 2005, the Court adopted amendments to \r\nArticle 43 of its Rules, regarding the notifications to be \r\nsent by the Court to those not directly involved in a \r\ncase who are parties to a convention whose \r\nconstruction may be in question in the proceedings. \r\nTwo paragraphs were added to Article 43 to cover the \r\ncase of international organizations that are parties to \r\nsuch conventions and to establish an appropriate \r\nprocedural framework for this purpose. Now they, too, \r\nhave a means for submitting observations on the \r\nparticular provisions of the convention whose \r\nconstruction is at issue in the case. \r\n The Court recently noted the growing interest of \r\nStates, reflected in the Court’s docket, in issues \r\nrelating to human rights, international humanitarian \r\nlaw and environmental law. In 1993, a Chamber for \r\nEnvironmental Matters was created by the Court, and it \r\nhas been periodically reconstituted. But in its years of \r\nexistence, no State has yet asked for a case to be heard \r\nby the Chamber. Cases such as Gabcíkovo-Nagymaros \r\nProject (Hungary/Slovakia) and Pulp Mills on the \r\nRiver Uruguay (Argentina v. Uruguay) have been \r\nsubmitted to the plenary Bench. A survey of State \r\npractice suggests that States prefer that environmental \r\nlaw not be compartmentalized, but that it find its place \r\nwithin international law as a whole. Indeed, \r\nenvironmental law has now become an important part \r\nof what we may term the mainstream of international \r\nlaw. Accordingly, this year the Court decided not to \r\nhold elections for a Bench for the Chamber for \r\nEnvironmental Matters. At the same time, should \r\nparties in future cases request a chamber for a dispute \r\ninvolving environmental law, such a chamber could \r\nstill be constituted under Article 26, paragraph 2, of the \r\nStatute of the Court. \r\n As the Assembly knows, the International Court \r\nof Justice celebrated its sixtieth anniversary this year. A \r\nsolemn sitting of the Court, in the presence of the \r\nQueen of the Netherlands, the Secretary-General of the \r\nUnited Nations and the President of the General \r\nAssembly, was organized in April to mark the \r\noccasion.  \r\n The anniversary has provided an occasion for the \r\nCourt to reflect on what it has achieved and where it \r\ncan improve. Sixty years ago the International Court \r\nstood virtually alone as the forum for the resolution of \r\ninternational disputes. For a variety of reasons, new \r\nA/61/PV.41  \r\n \r\n06-58718 8 \r\n \r\ncourts and tribunals have burgeoned, being established \r\nto deal with a variety of international needs, such as \r\nthe law of the sea, trade, human rights, investment and \r\nthe accountability of individuals for international \r\ncrimes. We are forging cordial relationships with each \r\nother. The Court has set up an informal system of \r\nexchanges whereby judges at the ICTY and ICC \r\nreceive summaries or relevant excerpts of our cases \r\nthat address legal questions of particular interest to \r\nthem, and vice versa. \r\n This growth in the number of new courts and \r\ntribunals has generated a certain concern about the \r\npotential for a lack of consistency in the enunciation of \r\nlegal norms, and the attendant risk of fragmentation. \r\nYet these concerns have not proved significant. The \r\ngeneral picture has been one of these courts seeing the \r\nnecessity of locating themselves within the embrace of \r\ngeneral international law.  \r\n The authoritative nature of International Court of \r\nJustice Judgments is widely acknowledged. It has been \r\ngratifying for the International Court to see that the \r\nnewer courts and tribunals have regularly referred, \r\noften in a manner essential to their legal reasoning, to \r\nJudgments of the International Court of Justice with \r\nrespect to questions of international law and procedure. \r\nIn just the past five years, the Judgments and Advisory \r\nOpinions of the International Court have been \r\nexpressly cited with approval by the International \r\nTribunal for the Law of the Sea, the European Court of \r\nHuman Rights, the European Court of Justice, the \r\nUnited Nations Commission on Human Rights, the \r\nInter-American Commission on Human Rights, the \r\nInternational Centre for Settlement of Investment \r\nDisputes, the International Criminal Tribunal for the \r\nFormer Yugoslavia and arbitral bodies, including the \r\nEritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission. The International \r\nCourt, for its part, has been closely following the work \r\nof these other international bodies also.  \r\n The ability of international judges, lawyers, \r\nscholars, the media and, indeed, interested members of \r\nthe general public to follow the work of the Court will \r\nbe further enhanced by its new website, which will be \r\nlaunched shortly. The new website will contain five \r\ntimes more data than the current, already admired \r\nwebsite, including every Judgment, Order and pleading \r\nsince 1946, as well as other new features. \r\n The International Court is the embodiment of the \r\nUnited Nations, being its principal judicial organ. This \r\nauthority accorded to the Court has served the United \r\nNations well over the years. The Court is indeed the \r\nCourt of all the Members, in the sense that it is \r\ncomposed of 15 judges from around the world elected \r\nby the entire United Nations membership. The \r\ndecision-making process of the Court is such that all \r\nthe judges are engaged in all the cases, save in those \r\noccasional circumstances in which the parties \r\nthemselves request a Chamber. Our Judgments and \r\nOpinions are written by the judges themselves. It is not \r\nthe Court of any region or of any personalities. It is the \r\nCourt of the United Nations. \r\n The International Court welcomes the special \r\nefforts that the Members of the United Nations have \r\nmade to strengthen our activities. In particular, we \r\nappreciate the recognition of the important role of the \r\nInternational Court expressed in the Outcome \r\nDocument (resolution 60/1) resulting from the meeting \r\nof more than 170 Heads of State or Government at \r\nUnited Nations Headquarters for the 2005 World \r\nSummit. The Court, for its part, will continue to work \r\nwith dedication and with its customary impartiality, \r\nand hopes that Members will provide us with the \r\nmodest additional resources that we need to serve them \r\nwell. \r\n I assure the General Assembly that the \r\nInternational Court will maintain the high quality of its \r\ndecisions, while striving to meet the expectations of \r\nthose States that entrust us with finding a solution for \r\nthem in a timely fashion. The Court deeply values the \r\ntrust placed in it by the United Nations, and stands \r\nready to work with the Organization towards the \r\nfulfilment of the goals enshrined in the Charter. \r\n Ms. Ertman (Finland): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the European Union. The acceding \r\ncountries Bulgaria and Romania, the candidate \r\ncountries Turkey, Croatia and The former Yugoslav \r\nRepublic of Macedonia, the countries of the \r\nStabilization and Association Process and potential \r\ncandidates Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, \r\nMontenegro and Serbia, and the European Free Trade \r\nAssociation countries Iceland, Liechtenstein and \r\nNorway, members of the European Economic Area, as \r\nwell as Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova, align \r\nthemselves with this declaration. \r\n It gives the European Union great pleasure to \r\ncongratulate the International Court of Justice on its \r\nsixtieth anniversary. The Union reaffirms its strong \r\n A/61/PV.41\r\n \r\n9 06-58718 \r\n \r\nsupport for the Court. We are particularly pleased to do \r\nso at a time when the international legal order is \r\nrapidly developing. That development is reflected in \r\nthe work of the International Court of Justice, as States \r\nhave been increasingly willing to submit disputes for \r\nsettlement.  \r\n Submitting a dispute to the Court is not, and must \r\nnot be, considered a hostile act by the other party. As \r\nthe principal judicial organ of the United Nations, the \r\nCourt is the cornerstone of the international legal order. \r\nIt has significantly strengthened the international rule \r\nof law and has contributed to respect for law. It not \r\nonly continues to play an important role in the \r\nresolution of international disputes, but also \r\ncontributes to their prevention.  \r\n The Court is also to be seen within the wider \r\ncontext of the international order. In the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes, the Court plays an important \r\nrole in maintaining and restoring international peace \r\nand security, as highlighted at the open debate on \r\nstrengthening international law held in the Security \r\nCouncil in June, under the Danish presidency. \r\n With the rapid expansion of its scope and its \r\ngrowing specialization — in particular, with the \r\ndevelopment of special treaty regimes — international \r\nlaw is increasingly governing new areas of \r\ninternational life. That may herald new challenges for \r\nthe international judiciary in its work of interpreting \r\nand applying this expanding body of law. In that \r\nfunction, the Court undoubtedly has as central a role as \r\never and deserves the full support of all members of \r\nthe international community. \r\n The International Court of Justice is not the only \r\ninternational tribunal now at work. In recent years, we \r\nhave witnessed the establishment of several new \r\ninternational courts of law. The International Tribunal \r\nfor the Law of the Sea deals with matters that may also \r\nfall within the jurisdiction of the Court. Others, like the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former \r\nYugoslavia, the International Criminal Tribunal for \r\nRwanda and the International Criminal Court, deal \r\nwith cases brought against individuals. All of them \r\nmay be seen as complementing one another and \r\nstrengthening the international legal order. \r\nNevertheless, the International Court of Justice, as the \r\nprincipal judicial organ of the United Nations, is the \r\nonly truly universal court in the exercise of general \r\njurisdiction in the settlement of international disputes \r\nbetween States. \r\n The European Union is grateful to the President \r\nof the Court, Judge Rosalyn Higgins, for presenting the \r\nreport on its work. The report clearly demonstrates \r\nthat, at the mature age of 60, the Court — with \r\n12 cases on its docket at present — is fully occupied. \r\nMember States need to ensure that the Court has the \r\nresources it needs, given the importance of its task. In \r\nthat context, the European Union also recalls the Trust \r\nFund to Assist States in the Settlement of Disputes \r\nthrough the International Court of Justice. \r\n The European Union also commends the Court \r\nfor paying increasing attention to the development of \r\nits website, which gives instant access to its Judgments \r\nand reasonings, thus contributing to wider \r\ndissemination and recognition of the work of the Court. \r\n Finally, the obligation of States to settle their \r\ndisputes through peaceful means lies at the heart of the \r\ninternational order. In that context, the European Union \r\nrecalls the recommendation of the 2005 World Summit \r\nthat States that have not yet done so consider accepting \r\nthe jurisdiction of the Court, in accordance with its \r\nStatute. The European Union underlines the utmost \r\nimportance of State compliance with the Court’s \r\ndecisions. \r\n Ms. Graham (New Zealand): Let me first \r\nexpress, on behalf of Canada, Australia and New \r\nZealand, my thanks to the President of the International \r\nCourt of Justice, Judge Rosalyn Higgins, for her \r\ninsightful and comprehensive report on the work of the \r\nCourt over the past year.  \r\n Sixty years after the Court’s establishment, the \r\ngrowing demands being placed on it show the \r\ninternational community’s confidence in it as a fair, \r\nimpartial and transparent judicial body. The Court’s \r\nincreasing workload demonstrates the essential \r\ncontribution it makes, as the principal judicial organ of \r\nthe United Nations, to the peaceful resolution of \r\ndisputes between States and to the development of \r\ninternational law. \r\n The application of the international rule of law \r\nremains crucial for a peaceful world. As countries that \r\nfirmly believe in the rule of law, we hope that leaders \r\nwill continue to support and explore ways to apply this. \r\nThe International Court of Justice, as the only \r\ninternational court of general jurisdiction, is central to \r\nA/61/PV.41  \r\n \r\n06-58718 10 \r\n \r\nensuring that the rule of law is maintained and \r\nstrengthened at the international level, and for that \r\nreason the Court deserves our support. \r\n It is important for smaller States to have access \r\nalongside their neighbour members to such impartial \r\nmeans to resolve their disputes. The Court represents \r\nthe equality of all Members within the United Nations. \r\n Our confidence in the Court and its continuing \r\nability to render considered Judgments on complex \r\ninternational legal issues is reflected in our acceptance \r\nof the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction in accordance \r\nwith Article 36 (2) of its Statute. We continue to urge \r\nother Members of the United Nations that have not yet \r\ndone so to deposit with the Secretary-General a \r\ndeclaration of acceptance of the Court’s compulsory \r\njurisdiction. \r\n The 12 cases currently on the Court’s docket are \r\nindicative of the workload facing the Court. It is fitting \r\nto see the wide regional spread of cases coming before \r\nthe Court, as well as the diverse subject matter of those \r\ncases. In addition, they reflect the willingness of States \r\nto turn to judicial settlement of their disputes, and are \r\nreflective of an ever-growing faith in the decisions of \r\nthe Court and in the rule of law by the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n Canada, Australia and New Zealand encourage a \r\ncontinued focus by the Court — and by parties to cases \r\nbefore it — on efficient and disciplined working \r\nmethods. Our three countries support the intention of \r\nthe Court to apply more strictly its decisions aimed at \r\naccelerating proceedings. In that context, Canada, \r\nAustralia and New Zealand will reflect further on the \r\nsuggestion in the report of the Court regarding the need \r\nto increase the provision of individualized legal \r\nassistance for judges, in the form of an increased \r\nnumber of law clerks. \r\n Canada, Australia and New Zealand look forward \r\nto the International Court of Justice continuing to play \r\nits vital role in the peaceful settlement of international \r\ndisputes and strengthening the international legal order, \r\nas mandated by the Charter. \r\n Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): I \r\nshould like at the outset to express the appreciation of \r\nthe delegation of Egypt to Judge Rosalyn Higgins, \r\nPresident of the International Court of Justice, for her \r\ninvaluable briefing on the work of the Court over the \r\npast year.  \r\n The creation of the United Nations coincided \r\nwith the birth of a new era in international relations \r\nbased on the international rule of law, primarily the \r\nsignificant purposes and principles of the Charter — \r\nnamely, the non-use of force in international relations, \r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes and respect for \r\nterritorial integrity and sovereign equality. Those \r\nprinciples continue to govern international relations. \r\nOver the past 60 years, the International Court of \r\nJustice has played a leading role in enhancing such \r\nprinciples by playing an effective role in the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes and the development of the \r\nprovisions of international law.  \r\n The Court has, indeed, succeeded in resolving \r\nalmost 100 cases relating to land and maritime borders, \r\nas well as in strengthening legal obligations regarding \r\nthe non-use of force and non-interference in the \r\ninternal affairs of States and in enhancing relations \r\namong States. Furthermore, it has issued several \r\nAdvisory Opinions reaffirming established legal \r\nprinciples and rules, among which the Advisory \r\nOpinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of \r\nNuclear Weapons and the Advisory Opinion on the \r\nlegal consequences of the construction of the \r\nseparation wall in the occupied Palestinian territory are \r\nthe most noteworthy. \r\n As we review the work of the Court today, we \r\nmust acknowledge the value of its distinguished work. \r\nWe welcome the increasing inclination of States to \r\nbring their disputes before the Court, which we believe \r\nis a true reflection of the international community’s \r\ngenuine confidence in the International Court of Justice \r\nand its belief in the Court’s neutrality and \r\nindependence. The fact that 12 cases are pending — as \r\nthe President of the Court stated today — is a further \r\naffirmation of that confidence.  \r\n Nevertheless, during the past 60 years, the \r\nCourt’s experiences and its relations with the other \r\norgans and specialized agencies of the Organization \r\nhave shown that the latter can benefit as a result of that \r\njudicial body’s potential to enhance international \r\nrelations and provide a legal dimension to the \r\ninternational community’s approach to global issues, \r\nespecially those under consideration by the General \r\nAssembly and the Security Council. \r\n Without doubt, enabling the Court to play that \r\nrole requires Member States — those represented in the \r\nSecurity Council as well as in the General Assembly — \r\n A/61/PV.41\r\n \r\n11 06-58718 \r\n \r\nto become involved by requesting Advisory Opinions \r\nfrom the Court on issues on which there is legal \r\ndisagreement. Furthermore, it will require us to commit \r\nto implementing such opinions when they pertain to the \r\ninterpretation of established legal principles, especially \r\nthose set out in the Charter.  \r\n The true value of the decisions and Advisory \r\nOpinions of the International Court of Justice lies not \r\nonly in the facts and principles that they establish, but \r\nalso in their contribution to the enrichment, \r\ndevelopment and codification of international law. \r\nThose decisions enshrine legal and moral values that \r\nshould be respected by all members of the international \r\ncommunity, thereby further enhancing international \r\npeace and security. \r\n This is especially the case with regard to the \r\nAdvisory Opinion recently issued by the Court in \r\nresponse to a request from the General Assembly on \r\nthe legal consequences of the construction of the \r\nseparation wall in the occupied Palestinian territory. \r\nThis Advisory Opinion is a clear reaffirmation of a \r\nwell-established legal principle on which we are all \r\nagreed — namely, the inadmissibility of the acquisition \r\nof land by force. Thus, the Advisory Opinion is both \r\nlegally and morally binding.  \r\n It is essential, therefore, that we develop a clear \r\nfollow up mechanism for the implementation of \r\ndecisions and Advisory Opinions issued by the Court \r\nso as to ensure that their scope is not limited to the \r\nCourt itself and the parties involved in the dispute. \r\nRather, there should be international recognition by \r\nUnited Nations bodies of their commitment to \r\nfollowing up and implementing in practical terms the \r\nCourt’s decision.  \r\n The Court has a legal obligation to correct any \r\nmisinterpretation of the rules and norms of \r\ninternational law, especially as they relate to the \r\nlegitimate right to self-defence, the use of force under \r\nthe pretext of the international campaign to combat \r\nterrorism and the attempt to promote democracy or \r\nrespect for human rights by force, as well as in dealing \r\nwith the encroachment by the Security Council on the \r\nmandate of the General Assembly as set out in the \r\nCharter on issues relating to, inter alia, human rights, \r\nterrorism and weapons of mass destruction. That is \r\nbeing done by increasingly resorting to requests for \r\nAdvisory Opinions to correct such procedural \r\nmisperceptions within a sound legal framework.  \r\n On past occasions the General Assembly has \r\npraised the role of the International Court of Justice \r\nand expressed appreciation for its contributions. The \r\nmost recent example was in the 2005 World Summit \r\nOutcome. I have great pleasure in referring to the \r\nadoption by the Special Committee on the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations and on Strengthening of the Role of \r\nthe Organization, in its previous session, of the draft \r\nresolution now before the Sixth Committee \r\n(A/C.6/61/L.6) on the commemoration of the sixtieth \r\nanniversary of the International Court of Justice. Egypt \r\nwas proud to introduce the draft resolution, which \r\npraises the excellent performance of the Court, \r\nreaffirms its vital role, and expresses gratitude for the \r\nCourt’s work, which enhances its international \r\nstanding. We are also proud that the Sixth Committee \r\nis currently in the process of adopting the draft \r\nresolution for recommendation to the Assembly for \r\nadoption during this session. That is a reflection of the \r\nspecial close relationship between the United Nations \r\nand the International Court of Justice as its chief \r\njudicial organ. \r\n Mr. Shinyo (Japan): It is my great pleasure and \r\nhonour, on behalf of the Government of Japan, to \r\naddress the Assembly under your presidency, Madam.  \r\n My delegation would like to express its gratitude \r\nto President Rosalyn Higgins for her in-depth report \r\ndescribing the current situation of the International \r\nCourt of Justice. We would also like to express our \r\nappreciation of, and support for, the achievements in \r\nthe work of the International Court of Justice during \r\nthe past year. \r\n In view of the ongoing globalization of the legal \r\nissues that the international community currently faces, \r\nand given that they increasingly involve transnational \r\nmatters, the importance of the role of the International \r\nCourt of Justice today cannot be overstated. As the \r\nonly international court of a universal character with \r\ngeneral jurisdiction, the International Court of Justice \r\nhas contributed significantly to the peaceful settlement \r\nof conflicts, and it is expected to continue to promote \r\npeace and justice in the world by establishing and \r\nmaintaining the primacy of international law. \r\n Japan, as a country that firmly upholds the \r\nprinciple of the rule of law, considers that there is a \r\nneed for all Member States to rely on the international \r\njudicial system to peacefully resolve conflicts. We \r\ntherefore continue to fully support in particular the \r\nA/61/PV.41  \r\n \r\n06-58718 12 \r\n \r\nwork of the International Court of Justice, which is the \r\nsupreme organ in this field.  \r\n Our delegation values the Court’s achievements \r\nover the past year, which reflect its jurists’ profound \r\nknowledge of international law and their far-sighted \r\nperspective on international society. Especially \r\nnoteworthy are the Court’s efforts to address such new, \r\ncutting-edge issues as massive violations of human \r\nrights and the management of shared natural resources, \r\nwhich show clearly the important role to be played by \r\nthe international judicial system in solving the difficult \r\nproblems confronting humankind today.  \r\n While bearing in mind the importance of the \r\nrulings of the Court, the Government of Japan expects \r\nthat the Court will continue its efforts at \r\nrationalization, in order to manage its heavy workload \r\nand at the same time retain the confidence of Member \r\nStates in its work. \r\n We express our congratulations on the sixtieth \r\nanniversary of the Court’s inaugural sitting, which was \r\ncelebrated in April this year. The Court’s unmatched \r\nhistory as a judicial organ shows how essential its role \r\nhas been for the international community. We expect \r\nthat the Court will continue to contribute to further \r\nstrengthening of the rule of law in the years to come. \r\n In conclusion, I wish to reiterate the great \r\nimportance attached to the lofty cause and work of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice as the principal judicial \r\norgan of the United Nations. Japan, for its part, will \r\ncontinue to contribute to the invaluable work of the \r\nCourt. \r\n Mr. Abdelsalam (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): At \r\nthe outset, I have the pleasure to convey our sincere \r\ncongratulations to the International Court of Justice, \r\nwhich recently celebrated its sixtieth anniversary — \r\n60 years during which it has been a steadfast edifice of \r\njustice and a trusted guardian of the principles of \r\ninternational law. The International Court of Justice \r\nembodies the will to enforce the rule of law as an \r\nalternative to violence and the use of force in inter-\r\nState relations. In that connection, we would like to \r\nexpress our gratitude to the delegation of Egypt for its \r\ninitiative in introducing a draft resolution \r\ncommemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the \r\nestablishment of the International Court of Justice. \r\n We would also like sincerely to thank Judge \r\nRosalyn Higgins, President of the International Court \r\nof Justice, for her comprehensive presentation of the \r\nCourt’s report, which provides an account of the many \r\nactivities undertaken by the International Court of \r\nJustice in the implementation of its duties. \r\n The report before us illustrates once again the \r\nexpanding role of the International Court of Justice in \r\nshouldering its responsibility as the main judicial body \r\nof the United Nations and the sole international court \r\nwith universal jurisdiction and character. The Court is \r\nthe most active mechanism capable of implementing \r\nthe Charter’s provisions for the peaceful resolution of \r\ninternational disputes based on the standards of \r\ninternational justice and law. The Court is therefore an \r\nessential instrument for the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. \r\n We were pleased to learn from the report that 192 \r\nStates have joined the International Court of Justice \r\nStatute, while 67 States, including the Sudan, have \r\ndeposited declarations of acceptance of the Court’s \r\ncompulsory jurisdiction. That sends a meaningful \r\nsignal that reaffirms the trust of Member States in the \r\nInternational Court of Justice’s ability to resolve \r\ndisputes in an honest way and in accordance with the \r\nprovisions of international law. Another positive sign is \r\nthe continuing increase in the number of cases pending \r\nbefore the Court. That strengthens trust in the Court \r\nand its ability to undertake the most urgent and \r\nimportant tasks of the United Nations, namely, the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes.  \r\n The 2005 World Summit Outcome recognized the \r\nincreasing number of challenges facing the \r\ninternational community, as well as the urgent need to \r\nstrengthen the capacity of the United Nations to make \r\nit possible to overcome those challenges efficiently and \r\neffectively. As the International Court of Justice is one \r\nof the main organs of the United Nations, and therefore \r\nconfronts similar challenges as the ones facing the \r\nOrganization, it is important to both support and \r\nincrease the capacities of the Court. One of the first \r\nsteps that can be taken in that regard is to accept the \r\nlegal jurisdiction of the Court. \r\n As the Court carries out its tasks, it is only \r\nlogical to accept its rulings, because justice cannot be \r\nfragmented or negotiated. Here, we recall the Advisory \r\nOpinions issued by the Court, including its Advisory \r\nOpinion on the Legal Consequences of the \r\nConstruction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian \r\nTerritory. The failure to comply with that Opinion \r\n A/61/PV.41\r\n \r\n13 06-58718 \r\n \r\ndefies the will of the international community and \r\nmocks international justice.  \r\n No discussion of the obligation of Member States \r\nto support the Court would be complete without \r\nreferring to the burden placed upon it and the need for \r\nit to shed light on the challenges and obstacles in its \r\nway while proposing appropriate recommendations for \r\nthe consideration of Member States.  \r\n My delegation would like to stress the importance \r\nof making voluntary contributions to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s Trust Fund in order to help countries bear the \r\nexpenses of the cases that they have brought before the \r\nCourt. In particular, supporting the Fund would enable \r\npoor countries to achieve peaceful settlements of \r\ndisputes. \r\n My delegation commends the Court for its efforts \r\nto disseminate its publications to Member States and to \r\nincrease access to those publications, particularly \r\nthrough its website, which gives users an opportunity \r\nto view the Court’s rulings, Advisory Opinions and \r\nOrders, thereby enhancing harmony under international \r\nlaw. We believe that the Court must continue those \r\nlaudable efforts by striving to strengthen its ties with \r\nother international legal bodies, as well as with \r\nregional and national ones, to raise awareness of the \r\nCourt’s role and activities. \r\n Finally, my delegation reaffirms its confidence in \r\nthe important role played by the Court. We renew our \r\ncommitment to supporting it so that it can carry out its \r\ntasks in the best possible manner. \r\n Mr. Andrianarivelo-Razafy (Madagascar) \r\n(spoke in French): The delegation of Madagascar \r\nwishes to thank Ms. Rosalyn Higgins, President of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, for her excellent \r\npresentation of its report, which contains relevant \r\ninformation enabling us to appreciate the progress \r\nmade and the effectiveness of the work of all the \r\nCourt’s personnel in recent years. \r\n In this year of the celebration of the Court’s \r\nsixtieth anniversary, the delegation of Madagascar \r\ncongratulates the International Court of Justice on the \r\nimportant role it has played for 60 years as the \r\nprincipal judicial organ of the United Nations and the \r\nforum par excellence for the pacific settlement of \r\ndisputes among States. \r\n The significant number of conflicts in today’s \r\nworld makes us believe that, more than ever before, \r\nhumanity needs an essential framework for promoting \r\nits security and development, with respect for the rule \r\nof law at the national and international levels. The \r\nUnited Nations bears a particular responsibility as the \r\nonly universal Organization charged with ensuring \r\nrespect for human rights and establishing the \r\nconditions needed for the maintenance of justice.  \r\n In that regard, the International Court of Justice, \r\nwhich is a judicial entity of the United Nations, plays a \r\nprimary role in strengthening the rule of law. The \r\ndiversity of the cases brought before the Court \r\nconfirms that it is the only international court of a \r\nuniversal character with general jurisdiction, before \r\nwhich States have the obligation to justify the legality \r\nof their conduct or their actions under international \r\nlaw.  \r\n It should be emphasized that, because of State \r\nsovereignty, the principle and norm whereby no State \r\ncan have obligations imposed upon it, States freely \r\nsubmit their disputes to the Court. The protection and \r\nimplementation of the principle of sovereignty in the \r\narea of international litigation are given concrete \r\nexpression by the rule of the consensual character of \r\ncompetence. That character guarantees that judicial \r\ndecisions will be carried out. \r\n Furthermore, Article 94 of the Charter is explicit \r\nin conferring on the Security Council the power to \r\ndecide, if necessary, on measures to be taken to execute \r\na ruling. Under the Charter system, only the Council \r\nand the International Court of Justice have the power to \r\ntake decisions that, by their obligatory nature, are not \r\nsubordinate to the acceptance of the State concerned. \r\nUnder those conditions, all decisions of the Court are \r\neffective. It is within the institutional structure of the \r\nUnited Nations itself that the question of the \r\neffectiveness of its decisions arises.  \r\n The universality of the Court is due to the fact \r\nthat, over the 60 years of its existence, it has dealt with \r\ncases from every region of the world. To date, \r\n67 States out of the 192 Members of the United \r\nNations have recognized the binding jurisdiction of the \r\nCourt. We urge States that have not yet done so to \r\nrecognize the Court’s jurisdiction as binding, in \r\naccordance with Article 36, paragraphs 2 and 5, of its \r\nStatute. For its part, Madagascar deposited its \r\ndeclaration of acceptance upon its admission to the \r\nUnited Nations, on 20 September 1960. \r\nA/61/PV.41  \r\n \r\n06-58718 14 \r\n \r\n We recall that, in the Millennium Declaration and \r\nthe Outcome Document of the 2005 Summit, Heads of \r\nState or Government decided to spare no effort to \r\nstrengthen the rule of law and respect for all \r\ninternationally recognized human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms. On that occasion, they \r\nemphasized “the obligation of States to settle their \r\ndisputes by peaceful means in accordance with Chapter \r\nVI of the Charter, including, when appropriate, by the \r\nuse of the International Court of Justice.” (resolution \r\n60/1, para. 73). \r\n The unprecedented increase in the number of \r\ncases brought before this international juridical body \r\nover the past decade shows us the increased confidence \r\nthat it inspires and the increased importance of its \r\nactivities. In addition to land and maritime border \r\ndisputes, the Court currently has on its docket cases \r\ninvolving the issues of genocide and the use of force. \r\nWe welcome the Court’s efforts to manage its increased \r\nworkload with the maximum efficiency. They include \r\nadopting new measures to specifically address the \r\nCourt’s internal functioning, the increased use of \r\ninformation technology and the amendment of certain \r\nprovisions of its Rules in order to speed up \r\nproceedings. In that connection, the delegation of \r\nMadagascar supports the plan to strengthen qualified \r\nhuman resources and to increase financial resources in \r\nproportion to its workload.  \r\n Experience has shown that recourse to the Court \r\nhas not only alleviated conflicts, but has also helped to \r\nestablish lasting settlements owing to its impartiality.  \r\n On this happy occasion, I should like to conclude \r\nby wishing the Court every success in its future work. \r\n Mr. Bayo Ojo (Nigeria): Let me at the outset \r\ncongratulate the President of the International Court of \r\nJustice, Ms. Rosalyn Higgins, on the detailed and \r\nenlightening report on the activities of the Court for the \r\nperiod 1 August 2005 to 31 July 2006. It shows that, as \r\nthe principal judicial organ of the United Nations, the \r\nCourt is living up to the expectations of Member \r\nStates.  \r\n We pay tribute to all the Court’s judges for their \r\ncommitment and devotion to upholding the principles \r\nof international law. For the 60 years of its existence \r\nthe Court has demonstrated its capability to effectively \r\ndischarge its dual role of deciding upon disputes \r\nsubmitted to it by Member States and advising the \r\nUnited Nations and its organs on legal issues. \r\n It is a mark of the recognition of the important \r\nwork of the Court that as at 31 July this year \r\n192 Member States had become parties to its Statute, \r\nand that 67 of them, including Nigeria, had deposited \r\nwith the Secretary-General a declaration of acceptance \r\nof the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction, in accordance \r\nwith Article 36, paragraph 2, of its Statute. Nothing \r\nshould be done to undermine confidence in the Court’s \r\ncapability and proceedings. Meanwhile, we encourage \r\nStates that have not yet done so to consider \r\ncomplementing their support with a declaration \r\naccepting the jurisdiction of the Court. \r\n Further practical proof of the rising confidence in \r\nthe Court is its increasing workload, which currently \r\nstands at 12 cases of varying subject matter drawn \r\nfrom all over the world. \r\n Nigeria’s attachment to the Court is deep and \r\nlong-standing. It is reflected in the positive roles of \r\neminent Nigerian jurists who have served on the Court, \r\nand is underscored by the voluntary submission of the \r\ndispute between Nigeria and Cameroon regarding the \r\nBakassi Peninsula to the Court for adjudication and our \r\nadherence to its decision. On 14 August this year \r\nNigeria lowered its flag for the last time and \r\neffectively withdrew its presence from the Bakassi \r\nPeninsula, in accordance with the ruling of the Court. \r\nWith this final act, Nigeria has fulfilled its obligations \r\nunder the terms of the agreement between it and \r\nCameroon. This reflects political will at the highest \r\nlevels of the two countries, dogged work and \r\ncooperation among senior officials, as well as the \r\nsupport and understanding of the international \r\ncommunity.  \r\n May I in particular restate my country’s \r\nappreciation of the positive contributions of the \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, who chaired \r\nGreentree, the meeting of the two countries last July, at \r\nthe end of which the final agreement was signed. We \r\nare no less grateful for the sustained interest and \r\nsupport of the international community in this matter. \r\nNigeria calls on all Member States to emulate this \r\nexample of good-neighbourliness and the supremacy of \r\ninternational law in relations between States. Only then \r\nshall we attain global peace and stability, and \r\nespecially strengthen the Court in its very important \r\nrole. Indeed, this is consistent with Article 2, \r\nparagraph 3, of the Charter, which enjoins Members to \r\n“settle their international disputes by peaceful means in \r\n A/61/PV.41\r\n \r\n15 06-58718 \r\n \r\nsuch a manner that international peace and security, \r\nand justice, are not endangered.” \r\n Nigeria is happy to note that, in spite of its heavy \r\nworkload, the Court is not just forging ahead, but is \r\nalso devising measures to improve its working methods \r\nas well as secure greater collaboration from the parties \r\nto proceedings. We note with satisfaction the Court’s \r\nefforts to rationalize the work of its Registry, to revise \r\ncertain provisions of its Rules, to shorten and simplify \r\nproceedings and to increase the number of decisions \r\nreached each year. We are confident that the utmost \r\ncare will be exercised to ensure that due process is \r\nfollowed at all times. \r\n We agree with the observations in the report that, \r\ngiven the Court’s activity and the need for it to respond \r\nas rapidly as possible to pending cases, Member States \r\nshould provide it with the wherewithal to carry out its \r\nnumerous tasks. This includes adequate funding and \r\nstaffing. While we shall coordinate efforts within the \r\nUnited Nations to do so, we believe Member States can \r\nand should consider making voluntary contributions to \r\nthe Trust Fund to Assist States in the Settlement of \r\nDisputes through the International Court of Justice. We \r\nurge all Member States to sustain their clearly \r\nexemplified confidence in the Court, not only by taking \r\ncases before the Court, but also through adherence to \r\nits decisions. This will enhance the Court’s relevance \r\nand ensure its universality. \r\n Finally, Nigeria urges the Court to continue to \r\ngive meticulous, impartial and professional attention to \r\nall cases coming before it, as well as to all its other \r\nduties under the Statute. \r\n Mr. Hachani (Tunisia) (spoke in French): It is a \r\ngreat pleasure for the delegation of Tunisia to take the \r\nfloor on this agenda item.  \r\n At the outset I wish, on behalf of my delegation, \r\nto thank Judge Rosalyn Higgins, President of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, for her detailed and \r\ncomprehensive statement on the work of the main \r\njudicial body of the United Nations. Her report reflects \r\nthe valuable role that the Court plays in the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes among States and the promotion \r\nof international law in international relations. Tunisia \r\nwelcomes the contribution the Court has consistently \r\nmade since its establishment to the development of \r\ninternational law and the promotion of peace and \r\nsecurity in the world. By offering a prudent, civilized \r\nalternative to violence and recourse to force, the Court \r\nhelps to strengthen the peaceful coexistence of peoples.  \r\n There is no doubt that the large number of cases \r\nand questions before the Court today clearly reflect the \r\nincreased confidence of the international community in \r\nthe role of the Court and the impartiality, independence \r\nand credibility of its decisions. This increase has, \r\nnonetheless, imposed on it the obligation to carry out \r\nsuccessfully a strict and constant review of its rules of \r\nprocedure and working methods to cope with an ever \r\nheavier workload. We support its ongoing efforts in \r\nthis area, and call upon all Members of the United \r\nNations to show greater interest in the Court’s \r\ndifficulties over its staffing and financial resources, \r\nand to do everything possible to ensure that it can carry \r\nout its work more effectively and thus contribute more \r\nquickly and systematically to the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes. \r\n The Opinions of the Court are unanimously \r\nconsidered the best formulation of the content of \r\ninternational law in force. We reaffirm the importance \r\nof the Court’s Advisory Opinions, which are issued at \r\nthe request of the Security Council or the General \r\nAssembly. We believe that the Council would benefit \r\nfrom making greater use of the experience of the \r\nprincipal judicial organ of the United Nations to \r\nstrengthen the legal value of its resolutions seeking to \r\nestablish international peace and security. By using the \r\nAdvisory Opinions of the Court, the General Assembly, \r\ntoo, could strengthen its capacity to carry out its tasks \r\nas perfectly as possible.  \r\n Despite their advisory nature, the Opinions of the \r\nCourt should be taken seriously. This applies to the \r\nAdvisory Opinion rendered by the Court at the request \r\nof the General Assembly on the legal consequences of \r\nbuilding a separation wall in the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritories. This Advisory Opinion constitutes a clear \r\nand unambiguous interpretation of an important legal \r\nprincipal that we should all be familiar with, namely, \r\nthat occupying the territory of others by force is \r\nforbidden.  \r\n The invitation to strengthen the principles of \r\ndemocracy and the rule of law should not be limited to \r\nthe national level. These principles should be \r\nstrengthened and respected by the international \r\ncommunity and in international relations. That is why \r\nthe International Court of Justice, being the principal \r\njudicial organ of the United Nations, is qualified to \r\nA/61/PV.41  \r\n \r\n06-58718 16 \r\n \r\nplay a decisive role in strengthening these principles so \r\nas to promote and reaffirm law and justice. \r\n We believe that the reform of the United Nations \r\nshould include the International Court of Justice, so \r\nthat it can genuinely carry out its mission in a world \r\nthat is undergoing radical change. \r\n In conclusion, I reaffirm the great importance that \r\nTunisia attaches to the lofty cause and action of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice as the principal judicial \r\nbody of the United Nations. We hope that the Court \r\nwill be given the resources it needs to maintain the \r\npace of its work and the quality of its deliberations, \r\nthus continuing to make an active contribution to \r\nstrengthening the primacy of law and the promotion of \r\ninternational justice. \r\n Mr. Joel Hernández (Mexico) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): The delegation of Mexico wishes to express \r\nsincere appreciation to the International Court of \r\nJustice for the work carried out in the past year and, in \r\nparticular, to its President, Judge Rosalyn Higgins, for \r\nthe report submitted this afternoon. We also appreciate \r\nher presence in the Assembly, where she has shared \r\ndevelopments of the Court with representatives and \r\nlegal advisers to Foreign Ministries of Member States. \r\nClearly, her presence does us honour and reflects her \r\npersonal dedication to international justice. \r\n Mexico congratulates the Court on its sixtieth \r\nanniversary on 12 April. During its 60 years the \r\nInternational Court of Justice has shown that it is ever \r\nmore important in interpreting, developing and \r\napplying international law. But, above all, we confirm \r\nthat year after year the Court is a fundamental \r\ncomponent of the international system for the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. There \r\nis no doubt that its uninterrupted work over this period \r\ndemonstrates that the confidence of States in the Court \r\nhas grown considerably, thanks in part to its efforts to \r\nconstantly improve its working methods. \r\n We also congratulate Judge Rosalyn Higgins and \r\nJudge Awn Shawkat Al-Khasawneh on their election as \r\nPresident and Vice-President of the Court, respectively. \r\nWe welcome the fact that a woman is presiding over \r\nthe Court for the first time in its 60-year history, and \r\nreiterate our confidence that more women will become \r\njudges in the Court in the near future. \r\n I also express the satisfaction of the Government \r\nof Mexico at the election of Mr. Bernardo Sepúlveda to \r\nthe highest world tribunal, and my country’s gratitude \r\nto the General Assembly for that honour. It is the first \r\ntime since 1973 that a Mexican has assumed this high \r\nfunction, resuming a longstanding tradition of \r\npromoting the best Mexican jurists to this lofty \r\nposition. We are convinced that the work of Judge \r\nBernardo Sepúlveda in the Couòt will further the \r\nstrengthening of the primacy of international law in \r\nrelations between States. \r\n Allow me to stress some of what we regard as the \r\nmost important aspects of the past year. We welcome \r\nthe fact that, for the second time, a country has \r\naccepted the jurisdiction of the Court under the \r\nprovisions of Article 38, paragraph 5, of the Rules of \r\nthe Court. My country attaches great importance to \r\npromoting recognition of the jurisdiction of the Court \r\nthrough declarations by States, but, clearly, we must \r\nrecognize that voluntary acceptance of the Court’s \r\njurisdiction is a mechanism that States can also use as a \r\nway of settling a dispute by peaceful means. \r\n The Court is becoming increasingly involved in \r\nmatters of great complexity and importance for \r\ninternational law. I refer, for example, to the work that \r\nthe highest jurisdictional body of the United Nations \r\nhas carried out in connection with cases of the crime of \r\ngenocide: Application of the Convention on the \r\nPrevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide \r\n(Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro) \r\nand Application of the Convention on the Prevention \r\nand Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Croatia v. \r\nSerbia and Montenegro). This shows once again that \r\nthe Court is playing a very important role in \r\ninternational efforts to maintain peace among peoples. \r\n International humanitarian law seeks to protect \r\nthose who have suffered the consequences of armed \r\nconflict. In the cases I have just mentioned the Court \r\npromotes the application of that branch of international \r\nlaw. In the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia \r\nand Montenegro the Court held several hearings to \r\ncollect testimony from witnesses and experts, thereby \r\nentering the difficult but important area of obtaining \r\nevidence from those directly involved in the conflict. \r\nEven more interesting, the Court has had to consider \r\nhow to take into account the jurisprudence of the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former \r\nYugoslavia. \r\n In this connection, it is important that the Court \r\nhas taken into account the International Law \r\n A/61/PV.41\r\n \r\n17 06-58718 \r\n \r\nCommission Articles on International Liability of \r\nStates for wrongful acts, which it did in considering the \r\ncase of Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo \r\n(Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Uganda). We \r\ncan see, therefore, that with these actions the fears that \r\nthe law would be fragmented have been dispelled. The \r\nexistence of several international legal tribunals and \r\norgans will not create chaos in international law, if \r\neach performs its function within the competence \r\nassigned to it. But if the Court itself takes into account \r\nthe work done in other forums, progress will be made \r\nin harmonizing the international legal system. \r\n I wish also to express the appreciation of the \r\nGovernment of Mexico for the publication of \r\nsummaries of the Judgments of the Court in Spanish. \r\nThis extremely important publication of the Court is \r\nvery useful to students and others studying \r\ninternational law in Spanish-speaking countries. \r\nNevertheless, of all the cases concerning Advisory \r\nOpinions requested by the General Assembly, the \r\nSecurity Council and the specialized agencies, only \r\ntwo were translated by the United Nations Secretariat. \r\nMy delegation is holding consultations in the Sixth \r\nCommittee to remedy this situation through translation \r\ninto the official languages of the United Nations of \r\nlanguages which are not the official languages of the \r\nCourt, so that all the Advisory Opinions exist in the six \r\nofficial languages of the United Nations. \r\n In addition, we are aware of the Court’s need for \r\nsupport in continuing to carry out its great mission. Of \r\ncourse, it is crucial that the judges have the requisite \r\nhuman and material support to perform their duties. We \r\nagree with the Court’s appeal with regard to there \r\nbeing only five law clerks to carry out the legal \r\nresearch for 14 judges and all the ad hoc judges elected \r\nfor each case. It is important that, given the enormous \r\nworkload, the General Assembly heed the Court’s \r\nappeal, reiterated by the President today, to increase \r\nthe number of law clerks. \r\n I conclude by reiterating Mexico’s commitment \r\nto the Court’s lofty purposes. We are convinced that the \r\nmain judicial organ of the United Nations should \r\ncontinue to be strengthened, in order that the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes submitted to it by States shall \r\ncontribute to the future maintenance of international \r\npeace and security. \r\n Mr. Sen (India): At the outset, I thank the \r\nPresident of the International Court of Justice, Judge \r\nRosalyn Higgins, for her detailed and comprehensive \r\npresentation of the report of the Court. \r\n The International Court of Justice, the principal \r\njudicial organ of the United Nations, is an important \r\nforum for the peaceful settlement of international \r\ndisputes. In April the Court celebrated the sixtieth \r\nanniversary of its inaugural sitting. We congratulate the \r\nCourt on its distinctive contribution to the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security in all the years of its \r\nexistence. \r\n The United Nations was established to save \r\nsucceeding generations from the scourge of war. Its \r\nfounding fathers sought to achieve that objective by the \r\ntwin approach of prohibiting the use of force under \r\nArticle 2, paragraph 4, of the Charter and by promoting \r\nthe peaceful settlement of international disputes under \r\nArticle 33. As a central element in the promotion of \r\ninternational peaceful settlement, departing from the \r\nmodel of the League of Nations, the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations established, through Article 92, the \r\nInternational Court of Justice as its principal judicial \r\norgan. Further, in the case of disputes under \r\nconsideration by the Security Council, Article 36, \r\nparagraph 3, directs the Security Council to \r\nrecommend to the parties that they refer all legal \r\ndisputes to the International Court of Justice. Finally, \r\nArticle 92 makes the Statute of the International Court \r\nof Justice an integral part of the Charter. \r\n The foregoing provisions clearly indicate the \r\nrespect for, and the central role assigned to, the \r\nInternational Court of Justice within the United \r\nNations Charter system. That is a status that is unique \r\nto the International Court of Justice, and not enjoyed \r\nby any other tribunal established since 1945. \r\n The recent period has witnessed the creation of a \r\nnumber of specialized regional and international \r\ncourts. The political process connected with the \r\nestablishment of special international judicial bodies \r\nhas been, on occasion, perceived as diminishing the \r\nrole of the International Court of Justice in the field of \r\nthe peaceful settlement of international disputes. \r\nMoreover, legitimate questions have been raised about \r\nthe legal basis underlying the establishment by the \r\nSecurity Council of the ad hoc International Criminal \r\nTribunals established for the former Yugoslavia and \r\nRwanda. The Security Council does not have that \r\npower under the Charter, and, while it can set up \r\nsubsidiary bodies, it cannot give them powers that it \r\nA/61/PV.41  \r\n \r\n06-58718 18 \r\n \r\ndoes not have itself: the established legal principle of \r\nnemo dat quod non habet. The lack of challenge from \r\nthe general membership of the United Nations does not \r\nmean acceptance of such an exercise in the future, still \r\nless any general endorsement of a power that the \r\nCharter does not give. \r\n However, despite all those developments, the \r\nInternational Court of Justice still remains the only \r\njudicial body with legitimacy directly derived from the \r\nCharter, enjoying general jurisdiction and available to \r\nall States of the international community on all aspects \r\nof international law. All other international judicial \r\ninstitutions, established as they are with competence \r\nover specified fields, are confined to their limited areas \r\nof jurisdiction and lack general jurisdiction of a \r\nuniversal nature. \r\n Over the past 50 years the Court has dealt with a \r\nvariety of legal issues. Its Judgments have covered \r\ndisputes concerning sovereignty over islands, \r\nnavigational rights of States, nationality, asylum, \r\nexpropriation, the law of the sea, land and maritime \r\nboundaries, the enunciation of the principle of good \r\nfaith, equity and the legitimacy of the use of force. The \r\nissues currently before it are equally wide ranging, and \r\nits Judgments have played an important role in the \r\nprogressive development and codification of \r\ninternational law. Despite the caution it has exhibited, \r\nand the sensibility it has shown to the political realities \r\nand sentiments of States, the Court has asserted its \r\njudicial functions and consistently rejected arguments \r\nto deny it jurisdiction on the ground that grave political \r\nconsiderations were involved in a case in which it \r\notherwise found proper jurisdiction for itself. Thereby \r\nthe Court clearly emphasized the role of international \r\nlaw in regulating inter-State relations, which are \r\nnecessarily political. \r\n In the same vein, the Court — or for that matter \r\nany other competent judicial body — should not regard \r\nitself as precluded from questioning the validity of a \r\nSecurity Council resolution in so far as it affects the \r\nlegal rights of States. The issue was raised very \r\npointedly by Judge Shahabudin and others in the \r\nLockerbie case. \r\n Many legal scholars rightly emphasize that the \r\nCourt should not concede to the Security Council a \r\nplace above the Charter; it should, rather, adopt a \r\ntextual approach to Article 39, the wording of which \r\ncontains all the necessary elements for a delimitation \r\nof the competences of the Security Council under \r\nChapter VII. The Court should not hesitate to affirm \r\nthe rule of law in the international legal order. In the \r\nLockerbie and Namibia cases the Court showed that it \r\nhas the power of judicial review, but, unfortunately, \r\nthis is limited to a very few contentious proceedings \r\nand a very few Advisory Opinions that are sought. The \r\npower of judicial review has been a crucial element in \r\na democratic system of checks and balances ever since \r\nMarshall’s famous judgment in Marbury v. Madison. \r\nThe most practical, and perhaps the only, way of \r\nintroducing those checks and balances into the \r\nfunctioning of the Security Council is through an \r\nexpansion of the permanent and non-permanent \r\nmembership of the Council and a transformation of its \r\nworking methods. That is important, because \r\nsometimes the justice that is done by the Security \r\nCouncil is really the kind of justice that is done after \r\nthe heavens fall, and that is why so often we are busy \r\ncatching the larks.  \r\n The phenomenal explosion of the Court’s docket \r\nattests to the Court’s high standing and authority, not \r\nonly in the United Nations system, but in the \r\ninternational community itself. It also reflects the \r\nincreased relevance of, and respect for, due process of \r\nlaw that States exhibit, and is an affirmation of faith in \r\nthe Court. From being in a situation in which, in the \r\nearly 1970s, it was called the Court without a case, it is \r\nnow faced with the problems of plenty. In fact, it now \r\nfinds itself in the position of being unable, within its \r\nexisting resources, to respond effectively and in time to \r\nthe demands made on it as a result of its increasing \r\nworkload. \r\n As emphasized in its report, the Court is taking \r\nvarious measures to rationalize the work of its \r\nRegistry, making greater use of information \r\ntechnology, improving its working methods and \r\nsecuring greater collaboration from parties to reduce \r\nthe time taken for individual cases. The report says that \r\nthe Court’s docket increasingly includes fact-intensive \r\ncases, which raise new procedural issues for it. The \r\nCourt’s request, therefore, for individualized legal \r\nassistance for all its members is reasonable and must \r\nbe implemented urgently to enable it to efficiently \r\ncarry out its designated functions as the principal \r\njudicial organ of the United Nations.  \r\n Mr. Maqungo (South Africa): Allow me to take \r\nthis opportunity to thank the President of the \r\n A/61/PV.41\r\n \r\n19 06-58718 \r\n \r\nInternational Court of Justice, Judge Rosalyn Higgins, \r\nfor her elucidating introduction of the Court’s report. \r\n We commend the Court for taking steps, such as \r\nrationalizing the work of the Registry, to absorb the \r\nincreasing workload it faces. \r\n South Africa is fully committed to the peaceful \r\nresolution of disputes. Hence, the International Court \r\nof Justice is very important to us as the judicial forum \r\nfor resolving disputes peacefully. We are encouraged \r\nby the growing number of States, in particular African \r\nStates and other developing States, that are bringing \r\ntheir disputes before the International Court of Justice \r\nrather than resorting to less peaceful means.  \r\n It is also gratifying to see the evident political \r\nwill to implement the decisions of the International \r\nCourt of Justice. We witnessed the continued \r\nimplementation of the decision of the Court regarding \r\nthe Bakassi Peninsula, disputed between the two \r\nfriendly nations of Nigeria and Cameroon, when, on \r\n14 August, it was reported that the Nigerian military \r\nhad withdrawn from part of the disputed peninsula, \r\nconsistent with the decision of the Court. In addition, \r\nwe have just heard from the Minister of Justice of \r\nNigeria comments to that effect.  \r\n Another positive development has been the \r\nconduct of the friendly Government of Uganda in \r\nproceeding to negotiate reparations to its neighbour, \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, following the \r\nruling of the Court in their case last December, which \r\nwas in favour of the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo. In a different case, involving the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo and Rwanda, the Court handed \r\ndown a Judgment indicating that it had no jurisdiction \r\nin the case.  \r\n In the year under review there have also been \r\ncases between small and larger countries, as \r\ndemonstrated by the case involving two friendly \r\ncountries, Djibouti and France, where France accepted \r\nthe jurisdiction of the Court, as well as the case of \r\nFrance and Congo-Brazzaville, involving an issue \r\nsimilar to that in the Djibouti and France case. The \r\nPresident of the International Court of Justice has \r\nalready spoken extensively about those cases, which \r\nare indeed evidence of positive developments in \r\nrespect for the rule of law and the peaceful resolution \r\nof disputes. \r\n The growing trend by countries, in particular \r\ndeveloping countries, to resolve their disputes through \r\nutilization of the Court must therefore be encouraged. \r\nThe Trust Fund to Assist States in the Settlement of \r\nDisputes through the International Court of Justice \r\nmust therefore be maintained and more widely \r\npublicized. It is worrying that the Fund has had a \r\ndecreasing level of resources since its inception, and \r\nthat the number of contributions to it remains low. We \r\nencourage all States and other relevant entities to \r\ncontribute to the Trust Fund. We take note that the \r\nFund has received no application in the year under \r\nreview, and attribute that to lack of information \r\nregarding its availability. \r\n Let us now turn to the working methods of the \r\nCourt. Recent cases before it, such as those of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda and the \r\nBosnia and Serbia case, have involved extensive fact-\r\nfinding by the Court. To a large extent, the Court \r\ntraditionally relies on documentary evidence to \r\nascertain the factual situation in any given case, while \r\ninternational criminal tribunals — such as the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former \r\nYugoslavia and the International Criminal Tribunal for \r\nRwanda — in similar situations rely heavily on oral \r\nevidence. We appreciate the difference in constitution \r\nbetween the International Criminal Tribunals, on the \r\none hand, and the International Court of Justice, on the \r\nother. But we believe that the Court may wish to avail \r\nitself of greater use of oral testimony in order to \r\nresolve factual disputes, rather than keep its traditional \r\nreliance on documentary evidence. We have taken note \r\nof the report by the President of the Court that it has in \r\nfact made use of oral testimony since 1991, and \r\nencourage it to do so more often. For that reason, the \r\nSouth African delegation is favourably disposed to \r\nconsider a request by the Court to increase the number \r\nof law clerks to ensure that the Judges can work more \r\nrapidly and efficiently in their deliberative and \r\nadjudicatory tasks.  \r\n We would also like to take this opportunity to \r\nwish the Court a happy sixtieth anniversary. \r\n Mr. Chávez Basagoitia (Peru) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): I would like to thank the President of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, Judge Rosalyn Higgins, \r\nfor her detailed and comprehensive introduction of the \r\nCourt’s annual report. \r\nA/61/PV.41  \r\n \r\n06-58718 20 \r\n \r\n Since its establishment, the International Court of \r\nJustice has made an essential contribution to the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security; the \r\nfulfilment of the fundamental purposes of the United \r\nNations through the peaceful resolution of legal \r\ndisputes between States; the development of \r\ninternational law; and the observance of the rule of \r\nlaw. That contribution continues to be essential. As we \r\ncelebrate 60 years since the Court began its work, the \r\nnumber of cases submitted to it, in terms of disputes \r\nboth for resolution and for Advisory Opinions, \r\ncontinues to grow. That reflects the effectiveness of the \r\nCourt as a mechanism for the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes as well as the international community’s \r\nconfidence in its impartiality, independence and \r\nprofessionalism. We therefore congratulate the judges \r\non what they have achieved in those 60 years, and \r\nencourage them to continue to shoulder the great \r\nresponsibility entrusted to them by the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n Peru believes that it is of the utmost importance \r\nthat the jurisdiction of the International Court of \r\nJustice be universally accepted. We therefore call upon \r\nStates that have not yet done so to consider accepting \r\nthe binding jurisdiction of the Court. Peru would also \r\nlike to express its gratitude to the States that have made \r\ncontributions to the Trust Fund to Assist States in the \r\nSettlement of Disputes through the International Court \r\nof Justice. We also join the Secretary-General’s often \r\nrepeated appeal to States, intergovernmental \r\norganizations, national institutions, non-governmental \r\norganizations, people working in the law and ordinary \r\ncitizens to make financial contributions to the Fund. \r\n Peru recognizes the importance of justice being \r\nadministered both efficiently and in a timely manner. \r\nPeru therefore urges the Court to continue its efforts to \r\nimprove its working methods and rules. In that \r\nconnection, we hope that the new edition of the \r\npublication setting out the instruments governing the \r\nwork and practice of the Court, as well as its rules, will \r\nsoon be available in all the official languages of the \r\nUnited Nations. We make that appeal as regards \r\nlanguage because we are convinced that the work of \r\nthe Court should be well known throughout the world, \r\nnot only in governmental and academic circles, but \r\nalso, and above all, among the general population. \r\n In that regard, we emphasize the Court’s \r\ncontribution to the discussion of its activities and \r\ndecisions, especially through its website, which is soon \r\nto be updated, and encourage it to continue in that \r\ndirection, particularly through making available in all \r\nthe official languages of the United Nations its \r\nJudgments, findings and Advisory Opinions. We \r\nreiterate our proposal concerning the possibility of \r\nhaving academic institutions cooperate in translating \r\nthat documentation, to be made available by electronic \r\nmeans to those who are interested. \r\n Peru agrees with the President of the Court that \r\nwith carefully balanced continued change the Court \r\ncontinues to be an example and guide for our \r\nconstantly growing international legal system.  \r\n As a country that has historically demonstrated \r\nits strict compliance with international law, Peru will \r\ntherefore continue to support the International Court of \r\nJustice in the discharge of its important \r\nresponsibilities.  \r\n Mr. Henczel (Poland): The Polish delegation \r\nfully associates itself with the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of Finland on behalf of the European \r\nUnion. In addition, in the year of the sixtieth \r\nanniversary of the inaugural sitting of the Court, we \r\nwould like to share a few more reflections on the \r\nCourt’s jurisdiction and the challenges it is facing. \r\n Concerning the history of the Court, allow me to \r\nrecall with appreciation the work of the eminent Polish \r\njudges, Professor Bohdan Winiarski and Professor \r\nManfred Lachs. They contributed substantially to the \r\ndevelopment of the jurisprudence of the Court, and \r\nwere also honoured to serve as its President, from 1961 \r\nto 1964 and from 1973 to 1976 respectively.  \r\n As for the scope of the Court’s jurisdiction, it is \r\nregrettable that today, of 192 Member States of the \r\nUnited Nations, only 68, including Poland, have made \r\ndeclarations recognizing the jurisdiction of the Court \r\nas compulsory. Wider acceptance of the jurisdiction of \r\nthe International Court of Justice becomes an \r\nimperative of our time, due to the extraordinary \r\nexpansion and development of the body of \r\ninternational law.  \r\n We need not only to strengthen the international \r\nrule of law, but equally to counteract one of the \r\ngreatest weaknesses of international law: its ineffective \r\nimplementation. It is in this context that the \r\ninternational community should perceive its duty to \r\nstrengthen both judicial and non-judicial means of \r\nimplementing international law. For those of us who \r\n A/61/PV.41\r\n \r\n21 06-58718 \r\n \r\nare guided by the wisdom of the Roman law tradition, \r\nthe obvious conclusion follows from the statement Ubi \r\nius ibi remedium — Where there is law, there must be a \r\nremedy. As Judge Higgins pertinently pointed out \r\nduring the Security Council’s thematic debate on the \r\nstrengthening of international law, on 22 June, \r\n“strengthening international law” means “the widening \r\nand deepening of the content of international law, \r\nand … the fortifying of the mechanisms for securing \r\ncompliance with or enforcement of international law” \r\n(S/PV.5474, p. 5). \r\n The International Court of Justice is a reflection \r\nof international law in force, with all its strengths and \r\nweaknesses. Therefore, it is so important to have a \r\nCourt that is able to develop jurisprudence of \r\ninternational law and remedy its weaknesses. Through \r\na number of cases, the Court has introduced \r\ninterpretations of rules or principles going well beyond \r\nthe parameters of individual judicial determinations \r\nand paving the way for new legal thinking or \r\napproaches. \r\n As is the case with other judicial institutions, the \r\nInternational Court of Justice is sometimes confronted \r\nwith attempts to politicize its activities in both \r\ncontentious and advisory jurisdictions. It should be \r\nfirmly emphasized that the Court’s judicial role has \r\nprevailed over such attempts and has become a well-\r\nestablished principle of its modus procedendi. In that \r\nway the Court has strengthened its authority as the \r\nprincipal judicial institution of the United Nations. \r\n Another dilemma facing judicial institutions, \r\nincluding international courts, is whether their conduct \r\nshould be tailored to what is termed judicial constraint \r\nor to judicial activism. Weaknesses of, and lacunae in, \r\ninternational law may naturally invite temptations to \r\nexcessive judicial activism by actually developing \r\ninternational law. The collective wisdom of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice has demonstrated that the \r\nfocus has commendably been concentrated on its role \r\nof judicial constraint, with a reasonable proportion of \r\njudicial activism. The Court thus offers solid, well-\r\nreasoned and profound interpretations without \r\nreplacing the Governments in their law-making role. \r\n Recent years of the activity of the International \r\nCourt of Justice have seen, as its annual report says, at \r\npage 75, “Still a heavy caseload, but a reduced \r\nbacklog”. It must be noted that in addressing the \r\nproblem of its workload the Court did not rely solely \r\non its budgetary requests. The Court regularly reviews \r\nits methods of work and adopts various organizational \r\nand procedural improvements. However, there is still a \r\nneed for continued rationalization and modernization \r\nof procedures to ensure efficient proceedings without \r\nundue delays. As in domestic jurisdictions, the \r\nInternational Court of Justice should be guided by the \r\nprinciple “justice delayed, justice denied”. Although a \r\ngrave and large-scale malaise of excessively lengthy \r\njudicial proceedings has not yet gravely affected the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, such a risk cannot be \r\nunderestimated. \r\n Significant lessons in this respect can be learned \r\nfrom domestic and other international judicial systems \r\nthat are already confronted with the phenomenon of \r\nprotracted judicial proceedings. One general lesson is \r\nthat this problem of lengthy proceedings needs to be \r\naddressed in anticipation. Another conclusion, and \r\nquite a surprising one, is that increased financial and \r\nother resources can remedy the situation, but only to a \r\ncertain extent and for a limited temporal duration. It \r\nhas been the experience of the European Court of \r\nJustice in Luxembourg and the European Court of \r\nHuman Rights in Strasbourg that budgetary increases \r\nand the growth of judicial infrastructure are essentially \r\nhelpful, but that their momentum has its limitations, \r\nbecause the workload starts to be on the increase again. \r\nThis is why more far-reaching and profound reforms of \r\nthe bodies and proceedings should be envisaged well in \r\nadvance. Otherwise, harmful effects may generate \r\nirreversible consequences for international law. \r\n Let me add a few observations on the so-called \r\nproliferation of international courts and tribunals. The \r\nposition of the International Court of Justice as the \r\nonly international judicial body to possess general \r\njurisdiction cannot be questioned. A discernible trend \r\ntowards further judicialization of modern international \r\nlaw has been noted. Not only has the number of \r\nregional courts increased, but so, too, has the number \r\nof ad hoc and specialized, sectoral courts. This trend \r\nproves that international law is undergoing a \r\nfundamental transformation, which strengthens its \r\njudicial power. However, proliferation of international \r\ncourts has raised many concerns about possible \r\noverlapping jurisdictions, conflicts of jurisprudence, \r\nthreats to cohesion of international law, and forum \r\nshopping, which would allow Governments to file their \r\napplications with the courts most favourable to their \r\narguments. \r\nA/61/PV.41  \r\n \r\n06-58718 22 \r\n \r\n It appears that most of these concerns may be \r\nexaggerated. In her address at the ceremony marking \r\nthe tenth anniversary of the International Tribunal for \r\nthe Law of the Sea, the President of the International \r\nCourt of Justice, Judge Rosalyn Higgins, noted that \r\nthey had not proved significant and that some overlap \r\nwas inevitable. \r\n Although that proliferation of courts has not yet \r\nbrought about serious instances of conflicts between \r\nthe international jurisdictions, first cases of conflicting \r\njurisprudence have been discernible. If, nevertheless, \r\ncertain conflicts between the international jurisdictions \r\noccur, they should be attenuated by the collective \r\nwisdom of the judges, and the consistency of the \r\njurisprudence will be maintained. \r\n The Court’s unique character and its increasing \r\nrole in our global society found its proper expression in \r\nthe declaration by the presidency on behalf of the \r\nEuropean Union on the occasion of the sixtieth \r\nanniversary of the Court on 12 April 2006:  \r\n “While the establishment of specialized \r\ninternational courts, tribunals and other dispute \r\nsettlement institutions confirms the increasing \r\nacceptance of the judicial settlement of disputes, \r\nthe ICJ remains the principal judicial institution \r\nand at the heart of an international order based on \r\nthe rule of law”. \r\n The Government of the Republic of Poland \r\nhighly appreciates the International Court of Justice, \r\nwhich, as President Shi rightly pointed out in his \r\npresentation of the Court’s 2005 report, deals “with \r\ncases as promptly and efficiently as possible while \r\nmaintaining the quality of its judgments and respecting \r\nthe consensual nature of its jurisdiction” (A/60/PV.39, \r\np. 6). Therefore, the Polish delegation supports the \r\nCourt’s budgetary proposals, which would enable it to \r\nbetter serve the international community. Strong \r\ninternational law requires a strong international \r\njudicial institution. \r\n Mr. Belinga-Eboutou (Cameroon) (spoke in \r\nFrench): This debate on the report of the International \r\nCourt of Justice is, in the view of my delegation, of \r\ntwofold importance. First, it comes at a time when the \r\nHeads of State and Government of Member States \r\nagree that international law is vital in inter-State \r\nrelations, as their conclusions at the 2005 World \r\nSummit, as well as in the Millennium Declaration, \r\nclearly illustrate. Secondly, it is important because it is \r\ntaking place in the year when the Court celebrates its \r\nsixtieth anniversary. We congratulate Egypt on its \r\ninitiative with regard to the draft resolution \r\n(A/C.6/61/L.6) on this event, an initiative with which \r\nCameroon is happy to associate itself.  \r\n We would like to express our warm appreciation \r\nto Ms. Higgins, President of the International Court of \r\nJustice, for the excellent quality of the solid and \r\ndetailed report she has just presented, a report whose \r\nmerits have been stressed by several previous speakers.  \r\n The International Court of Justice has never had \r\nso much success as it has over recent years. Member \r\nStates are entitled to welcome this success, particularly \r\nat a time when the rule of law, at both the national and \r\ninternational levels, has become one of the major \r\nconcerns of our day. This admirable vitality of the \r\nCourt stems from the juridical quality of its judgments \r\nand the increasingly great speed with which it takes up \r\ncases before it. It also demonstrates the essential role \r\nof the Court, the principal judicial organ of the United \r\nNations, in the contemporary international juridical \r\nsystem, because of its remarkable contribution both to \r\nthe development of international law and to the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.  \r\n The presentation of the Court’s report for the \r\nperiod August 2005 to July 2006 gives the Cameroon \r\ndelegation an opportunity to outline a few ideas on a \r\nquestion that has drawn the attention of States over \r\nrecent years, and on which a number of delegations \r\nhave spoken in this debate: the implementation of \r\ncertain decisions of international jurisdictions, in \r\nparticular by the International Court of Justice itself.  \r\n It is not the task of the Court to ensure the \r\nexecution of its Judgments, unless, of course, the \r\nparties expressly request it; its judicial function ends \r\nthe moment it hands down its Judgment. But a judge \r\ncannot be entirely indifferent to the fate of his \r\nJudgment, even if it is ultimately up to the parties to \r\nfind the best ways and means to implement the verdict \r\nof the Court.  \r\n In this regard, the experience of implementing the \r\nCourt’s Judgment of 10 October 2002 on the land and \r\nmaritime boundary between Cameroon and Nigeria is \r\nworth sharing. Implementation, which began in \r\nNovember 2002, took a decisive turn with the \r\nconclusion between Cameroon and Nigeria of the \r\nGreentree Agreement of 12 June this year, which was \r\nsigned by the Heads of State of the two countries and \r\n A/61/PV.41\r\n \r\n23 06-58718 \r\n \r\ncountersigned by the Secretary-General of the United \r\nNations and the representatives of Germany, the United \r\nStates, France and the United Kingdom. The agreement \r\nis part of the comprehensive mechanism for \r\nimplementation of the Judgment, with the two heads of \r\nState and the Secretary-General as the political entity \r\nand the Cameroon-Nigeria Mixed Commission the \r\nbody tasked with the technical follow-up of the \r\nprocess. The Commission, established through the \r\ngood offices of the Secretary-General, is under the \r\nchairmanship of his Personal Representative.  \r\n The effective implementation of the Greentree \r\nAgreement began on 14 August 2004 with the \r\nwithdrawal and transfer of authority in the Bakassi \r\nPeninsula. That required courage, patience, wisdom \r\nand perseverance on the part of President Paul Biya of \r\nCameroon, and open-mindedness, commitment, \r\ndetermination and a clear view of what was at stake on \r\nthe part of President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria. \r\nThey needed a long-term vision of relations between \r\ntwo States and two fraternal peoples — a vision \r\nbuttressed by a profound commitment to peace — to \r\nprevent a conflict in which the armed forces of the two \r\ncountries had confronted each other for 12 years \r\ndegenerating into a general conflagration that could \r\nhave consumed the Gulf of Guinea and would \r\nundoubtedly have further destabilized the African \r\ncontinent. \r\n The Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, needed \r\nfinesse and diplomatic tact, as well as conviction and a \r\nhigh-minded sense of duty, to ensure that his good \r\noffices were successful, thus making possible what \r\nunquestionably constitutes the greatest success in the \r\nfield of peace in the world in 2006. \r\n Surely Africa deserves to have the international \r\ncommunity take note of this exemplary model for the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes, and to receive the \r\nattention of all the bodies that encourage those who \r\npromote the cause of world peace? For it is now \r\ngenerally agreed that this unprecedented experience \r\ncould be a model in its field, as the Secretary-General \r\nhimself has said. \r\n Strengthening the role of the International Court \r\nof Justice, as advocated in the proposed reform of the \r\nUnited Nations, requires strengthening the confidence \r\nof States in the Court. That is possible only if the \r\nStates parties to a case before it have a guarantee that \r\nits Judgment will be carried out. As we said here on \r\n29 September last year, \r\n  “Implementation of the rulings of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice — for which it is \r\nnot responsible — remains of pivotal importance \r\nto international peace and security, because a \r\ndispute does not end, and is not considered to \r\nhave ended, until the Court’s ruling has been \r\nfully implemented.” (A/60/PV.25, p. 11) \r\nOn 27 October 2005 we recalled: \r\n “Notwithstanding all of the pledges and \r\nstatements of intent made, the Court cannot live \r\nup to the hopes of the international community \r\nunless its decisions are implemented fully and \r\nspeedily.” (A/60/PV.39, p. 21)  \r\nImplementation of the Judgments is therefore of the \r\nhighest importance. \r\n In this spirit, my delegation would like to make \r\nsome suggestions that may contribute to strengthening \r\nthe mechanism laid down in Article 94, paragraph 2, of \r\nthe Charter, the mechanism to which the representative \r\nof Madagascar referred.  \r\n First, the delegation of Cameroon wonders \r\nwhether it might not be appropriate to have what we \r\nmight call an updated reading of that provision of the \r\nCharter in the light of the recent evolution in the \r\nCourt’s jurisprudence. Indeed, since its Order of \r\n2 March 1999, in the LaGrand case, the Court \r\nconsiders that its Orders in terms of provisional \r\nmeasures are as binding as its Judgments. However, \r\nArticle 94, paragraph 2, refers explicitly only to failure \r\nto implement a Judgment of the Court. So the question \r\narises as to whether it would not be appropriate to \r\ninterpret this provision in the future as extending also \r\nto all decisions rendered by the Court in contentious \r\nissues and having binding force. \r\n Secondly, to extend the suggestions made here \r\nlast year by Cameroon, on 29 September and \r\n27 October, would it not be a good idea to consider \r\ncreating a follow-up mechanism for implementation of \r\nthe Court’s decisions? Such a mechanism, established \r\nwithin the framework of preventive diplomacy, could \r\nbe attached to the Secretariat, which would thus be in a \r\nposition to inform both the United Nations and all \r\nMember States. Clearly, if international peace and \r\nsecurity are the business of each and every Member \r\nState, so is implementation of the Court’s decisions. \r\nA/61/PV.41  \r\n \r\n06-58718 24 \r\n \r\n I have given just an outline of thoughts that I \r\nhope will commend themselves to the General \r\nAssembly. If it finds them to be of any interest, \r\nCameroon will contribute at the most appropriate level \r\nwith more exhaustive proposals. \r\n Mr. Shah (Pakistan): At the outset, let me thank \r\nthe President of the International Court of Justice, \r\nJudge Rosalyn Higgins, for presenting its report on its \r\nwork during the past year. I also thank her for her \r\nexcellent briefing on the role and functioning of the \r\nCourt. \r\n Justice and the rule of law are the key to an \r\norderly international society. The need for international \r\nlegal order and justice has never been so acutely felt as \r\nit is today. Justice and fairness have become an integral \r\nrequirement of present-day existence. They are critical \r\nto the realization of all human rights. \r\n Pakistan fully supports the aims and objectives of \r\nthe International Court of Justice. We believe that \r\nstrengthening the work of the Court will contribute \r\ntowards the strengthening of international legal \r\ninstitutions, as well as the rule of law. \r\n The Court’s position as the principal judicial \r\norgan of the United Nations is unique. It is the only \r\ninternational court of a universal character with general \r\njurisdiction. \r\n Chapter VI of the Charter offers vast possibilities \r\nfor the United Nations and its organs to play an \r\nimportant role in the pacific settlement of disputes and \r\nconflict prevention. Article 36, paragraph 3, clearly \r\nsets out the role of the Court in the settlement of \r\ndisputes. Article 1, paragraph 1, recognizes that \r\nsettlement of international disputes “by peaceful means \r\nand in conformity with the principles of justice and \r\ninternational law” is one of the basic purposes of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n More than 300 bilateral and multilateral treaties \r\nprovide for the Court to have jurisdiction in the \r\nresolution of disputes arising out of their application or \r\ninterpretation. Almost 65 countries, including Pakistan, \r\nhave accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court \r\nin accordance with Article 36 of its Statute. In addition \r\nto the settlement of disputes, the Court can be \r\nconsulted by the General Assembly and the Security \r\nCouncil on any legal question. Other organs of the \r\nUnited Nations and its specialized agencies can also \r\nconsult the Court on legal questions, subject to \r\nauthorization by the General Assembly. The Court can \r\nalso be consulted by States with their special \r\nagreement on specific disputes. These provisions offer \r\na wide array of options for the settlement of disputes to \r\nMember States and the United Nations as a whole. It is \r\nfor Member States and the United Nations organs to \r\nmake the best possible use of the Court’s facilities. \r\n In pursuance of its aims and objectives, the Court \r\nhas delivered excellent decisions during the period \r\nunder consideration. We especially noted with \r\nappreciation the Court’s Judgment delivered on \r\n19 December 2005 in Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo v. Uganda. The Judgment validates a number of \r\nfundamental principles of international law, including, \r\nfirst, the principle of the non-use of force in \r\ninternational relations; secondly, the prohibition of \r\nkilling, torture and other forms of inhuman treatment \r\nof civilian populations; thirdly, the prohibition of the \r\ndestruction of civilian property and the establishment \r\nof a distinction between civilian and military targets; \r\nfourthly, respect for human rights and international \r\nhumanitarian law in occupied territories; fifthly, the \r\nestablishment of law and order in occupied territories; \r\nand, sixthly, establishment of the principle of \r\ncompensation for damages in occupied territories. We \r\nare of the view that this Judgment will go a long way \r\nin promoting respect for international law in the event \r\nof armed hostility. \r\n We have also noted with appreciation the Court’s \r\nefforts to re-examine its working methodology in order \r\nto tackle its heavy workload and to realize the work of \r\nthe Registry. In view of the Registry’s dual role of \r\njudicial support and international secretariat, it was an \r\nimportant challenge. We appreciate that these efforts \r\nhave resulted in shortening the period between the \r\nclosure of written proceedings and the opening of oral \r\nproceedings. We hope the Court will continue to \r\nperiodically review its working methodology to meet \r\nupcoming challenges. \r\n We have also taken note of the Court’s views \r\nregarding the shortage of law clerks for the judges. We \r\nbelieve that the Court should have at its disposal all the \r\nresources necessary to perform the task assigned to it. \r\nThe General Assembly should provide the Court with \r\nthe resources needed to perform its work effectively \r\nand efficiently. We hope that a detailed proposal by the \r\nCourt with its annual budget for 2008-2009 will find \r\nsupport at the time of its consideration. \r\n A/61/PV.41\r\n \r\n25 06-58718 \r\n \r\n The commitment we have made to strengthen and \r\nadvance the international rule of law will be a lasting \r\nlegacy for future generations. Pakistan stands ready to \r\ncooperate fully and to contribute fully to the work of \r\nthe Court in realizing such commitments. \r\n Mr. Ja’afari (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): My delegation would first like to express its \r\nappreciation to Judge Rosalyn Higgins, President of \r\nthe International Court of Justice, for her \r\ncomprehensive statement about the International Court \r\nof Justice’s work over the past year.  \r\n The International Court of Justice is an essential \r\nbody and the principal United Nations organ \r\nguaranteeing the rule of law in international relations \r\nin a genuine manner, in a world that grows more \r\ncomplicated by the day. This is realized through the \r\nCourt’s role in achieving peaceful settlements of \r\ndisputes amongst States.  \r\n As we celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the \r\nCourt’s formation, Syria would like once again to \r\ncommend the principal judicial organ of the United \r\nNations, especially for its continued contribution to the \r\nadvancement of international law and the \r\nencouragement of justice among States. In this regard, \r\nwe note that two Syrian judges had the honour of \r\nparticipating in the settlement of international disputes \r\nin this competent Court. Syria has continuously and \r\ntraditionally been interested in the proceedings of the \r\nCourt, and has completely supported it. This is not \r\nunusual, since my country’s region has from the \r\nearliest times witnessed forms of written human \r\njustice. In this regard, the Charter, in our opinion, is \r\nstill relevant for dealing with current international \r\nissues, because it is based on justice and equality in \r\ninternational relations. \r\n The International Court of Justice, 60 years after \r\nits formation, is more qualified by virtue of its Statute \r\nto undertake this task than ever before, owing to the \r\ninternational community’s need for it and its increasing \r\nneed for the international community. Here we note the \r\nCourt’s ruling in two cases and its adoption of \r\nprecautionary measures in another case during the \r\nperiod under consideration. We also note the large \r\nnumber of cases submitted to the Court, cases that \r\ncover a variety of subjects. We also note clear \r\ngeographic diversity of the States that have resorted to \r\nthe Court. This reaffirms the credibility of the work, \r\nactivities and legal Opinions of the Court. This \r\nintensive workload reflects the fact that the Court \r\nembodies the principle of the equality of States before \r\ninternational law and that it is a neutral third party and \r\nguardian of international law, and as such presents a \r\ncoherent international legal order. \r\n The report presented by Judge Higgins mentioned \r\nmany cases that the Court has recently considered. It \r\nalso stated the results achieved and the respect which \r\nits rulings received. In that context, we express our \r\nappreciation for the Opinions of the Court and reaffirm \r\nthat respect for them is the real and true test of a \r\nState’s effective belief in the rule of law. That is \r\nbecause justice cannot only be a point of view; rather, \r\nits true value lies in its implementation and in the \r\nState’s compliance with the ruling — whether that \r\nState is large or small, powerful or weak, rich or poor. \r\n In that regard, we recall the Advisory Opinion \r\nissued by the Court on Israel’s construction of the \r\nseparation wall in the occupied Palestinian territories. \r\nThe Court found that Israel’s construction of the wall \r\nwas in violation of international law and that Israel is \r\ntherefore obligated to put an end to its violation of \r\ninternational law and to compensate for any damages \r\ncaused by the wall’s construction. The Court also \r\nfound that all States are bound to recognize the illegal \r\nstatus arising from the construction of the wall, and \r\nthat countries must guarantee that Israel abide by \r\ninternational humanitarian law as stated in the Fourth \r\nGeneva Convention. \r\n Despite the fact that the legal Opinion of the \r\nCourt stresses the need for the United Nations, \r\nincluding the Security Council and the General \r\nAssembly, to adopt measures to put an end to the \r\nillegal status arising from the construction of the wall, \r\nthe Security Council regrettably has not played its role, \r\ndue to the selectivity practised by some of its member \r\nStates and their protection of Israel’s violations of \r\ninternational law, as long as those violations serve their \r\npolicies and interests.  \r\n In that regard, we wish to indicate another \r\nimportant legal Opinion issued by the Court, which is \r\nconsidered an important term of reference — namely, \r\nthe Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Use or \r\nThreat of Use of Nuclear Weapons. Here we also note \r\nthat several nuclear-weapon States have, unfortunately, \r\nbeen speaking openly and irresponsibly over the years \r\nof the possibility of using such weapons. Such actions \r\nare a direct, open and illegal threat against other States.  \r\nA/61/PV.41  \r\n \r\n06-58718 26 \r\n \r\n Since the early 1990s the United Nations has \r\nwitnessed an important wave of calls for reform. In \r\nthat context, we must achieve balance in the working \r\nmethods of the main organs of the United Nations, \r\nespecially the Security Council and the General \r\nAssembly. We feel it is necessary in that context for the \r\nCourt to monitor how these main organs abide by their \r\nmandate under the Charter, in particular the Security \r\nCouncil, as its agenda has become inflated in a \r\nworrisome manner and has extended beyond its \r\nmandate in many instances. The fact that the courts of \r\nsome countries have deliberated the legitimacy of some \r\nof the measures adopted by the sanctions committees \r\nof the Security Council should ring warning bells and \r\nmake us realize the dire urgency of strengthening the \r\nCourt’s role. \r\n We have noted that the Court has a heavy \r\nworkload, which we expect to intensify during the next \r\nfew years, a matter that we cannot ignore. If we want it \r\nto be an effective and independent judicial body in the \r\nservice of the international community, we must give \r\nthe necessary attention to its staffing needs and \r\nfinancial needs. Syria therefore supported the \r\nintroduction of two new professional posts for the \r\n2007-2008 budget, and we hope that more resources \r\nwill be allocated to the Court. \r\n My country supports the proposals of the Court to \r\nincrease the number of legal clerks. In that regard, we \r\nnote that there are no specialized language employees, \r\nwhich causes the Court to resort to the services of \r\ninterpreters from abroad. We hope that the Court will \r\npropose in its next programme budget the creation of \r\nthe necessary posts for those tasks. We stress the \r\nimportance of observing the principle of equitable \r\ngeographic distribution in filling them, in order to \r\nguarantee the balanced representation of all the regions \r\nof the world and their respective legal systems. In \r\naddition, we encourage all countries that can make \r\ncontributions to the Trust Fund to do so. \r\n In closing, Syria once again expresses its respect \r\nand appreciation for the role of the Court in carrying \r\nout its tasks. It pledges to exert, with all other United \r\nNations Member States that believe in justice and the \r\nrule of law, every possible effort to strengthen the \r\nCourt’s role in all fields. \r\n The President: May I take it that it is the wish of \r\nthe General Assembly to conclude its consideration of \r\nagenda item 70? \r\n  It was so decided. \r\n \r\n  The meeting rose at 6.20 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
