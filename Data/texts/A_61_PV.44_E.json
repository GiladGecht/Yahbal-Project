(Bahrain) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m. \r\n \r\n In the absence of the President, Mr. Al-Murad \r\n(Kuwait), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 133  \r\n \r\nFinancing of the United Nations Operation \r\nin Burundi \r\n \r\n  Report of the Fifth Committee (A/61/547) \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): If there \r\nis no proposal under rule 66 of the rules of procedure, I \r\nshall take it that the General Assembly decides not to \r\ndiscuss the report of the Fifth Committee that is before \r\nthe Assembly today. \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): \r\nStatements will therefore be limited to explanations of \r\nvote. The positions of delegations regarding the \r\nrecommendation of the Fifth Committee have been \r\nmade clear in the Committee and are reflected in the \r\nrelevant official records. \r\n May I remind members that, under paragraph 7 of \r\ndecision 34/401, the General Assembly agreed that  \r\n  “When the same draft resolution is \r\nconsidered in a Main Committee and in plenary \r\nmeeting, a delegation should, as far as possible, \r\nexplain its vote only once, that is, either in the \r\nCommittee or in plenary meeting, unless that \r\ndelegation’s vote in plenary meeting is different \r\nfrom its vote in the Committee.”  \r\n May I remind delegations that, also in accordance \r\nwith General Assembly decision 34/401, explanations \r\nof vote are limited to 10 minutes. \r\n Before we begin to take action on the \r\nrecommendation contained in the report of the Fifth \r\nCommittee I should like to advise representatives that \r\nwe are going to proceed to take a decision in the same \r\nmanner as was done in the Fifth Committee. \r\n The Assembly will now take a decision on the \r\ndraft resolution recommended by the Fifth Committee \r\nin paragraph 8 of its report. The Fifth Committee \r\nadopted the draft resolution without a vote. May I take \r\nit that the Assembly wishes to do the same? \r\n The draft resolution was adopted (resolution \r\n61/9). \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 133. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 103 (continued) \r\n \r\nElections to fill vacancies in principal organs \r\n \r\n (a) Election of five non-permanent members of the \r\nSecurity Council \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nGeneral Assembly will resume the election of five  \r\nnon-permanent members of the Security Council to \r\nA/61/PV.44  \r\n \r\n06-59416 2 \r\n \r\nreplace those members whose term of office expires on \r\n31 December 2006. \r\n As members will recall, when the 40th plenary \r\nmeeting was adjourned on Wednesday afternoon, \r\n25 October 2006, there still remained one seat from \r\namong the Latin American and Caribbean States to be \r\nfilled.  \r\n In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of \r\nprocedure, we shall now proceed to the next round of \r\nballoting by secret ballot. This forty-second round of \r\nballoting, in accordance with rule 94 of the rules of \r\nprocedure, will also be the twentieth unrestricted \r\nballot.  \r\n For this forty-second round of balloting, may I \r\nremind the Assembly that any Member State from \r\namong the Latin American and Caribbean States may \r\nbe a candidate except those outgoing members and \r\nthose already members of the Security Council, \r\nnamely, Argentina and Peru. \r\n Before we begin the voting process, I should like \r\nto remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the \r\nrules of procedure of the General Assembly, no \r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting except on a \r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the voting.  \r\n We shall now begin the voting process. Members \r\nare requested to remain seated until all ballots have \r\nbeen collected. \r\n Ballot papers marked “B” will now be \r\ndistributed. May I ask representatives to write on the \r\nballot papers marked “B”, for the Latin American and \r\nCaribbean States, the name of the one State for which \r\nthey wish to vote. Ballot papers marked “B” will be \r\ndeclared invalid if they contain the name of more than \r\none State, as well as if they contain the name of a \r\nMember States which does not belong to that region.  \r\n At the invitation of the President, Mr. Jumat \r\n(Brunei Darussalam), Mr. Sepúlveda (Chile), \r\nMrs. Cerere (Kenya), Ms. Klausa (Poland) and \r\nMs. Tardy-De Bortoli (Switzerland) acted as \r\ntellers. \r\n A vote was taken by secret ballot.  \r\n The meeting was suspended at 10.25 a.m. and \r\nresumed at 10.50 a.m. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nresult of the voting is as follows: \r\n Group B — Latin American and Caribbean States \r\n Number of ballot papers:    186 \r\n Number of invalid ballots:    0 \r\n Number of valid ballots:     186 \r\n Abstentions:       5 \r\n Required two-thirds majority:     121 \r\n Number of votes obtained: \r\n  Guatemala       105 \r\n  Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)  75 \r\n  Uruguay       1 \r\n Since the result of this ballot has again been \r\ninconclusive, there still remains one seat to be filled \r\nfrom among the Latin American and Caribbean States. \r\nWe must therefore proceed to the twenty-first \r\nunrestricted ballot. \r\n For this forty-third round of balloting, may I \r\nremind the Assembly that any Member State from \r\namong the Latin American and Caribbean States may \r\nbe a candidate except those outgoing members and \r\nthose already members of the Security Council, \r\nnamely, Argentina and Peru. \r\n Before we begin the voting process, I should like \r\nto remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the \r\nrules of procedure of the General Assembly, no \r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting except on a \r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the voting.  \r\n We shall now begin the voting process. Members \r\nare requested to remain seated until all ballots have \r\nbeen collected. \r\n Ballot papers marked “B” will now be \r\ndistributed. May I ask representatives to write on the \r\nballot papers marked “B”, for the Latin American and \r\nCaribbean States, the name of the one State for which \r\nthey wish to vote. Ballot papers marked “B” will be \r\ndeclared invalid if they contain the name of more than \r\none State, as well as if they contain the name of a \r\nMember State which does not belong to that region.  \r\n At the invitation of the President, Mr. Jumat \r\n(Brunei Darussalam), Mr. Sepúlveda (Chile), \r\nMrs. Cerere (Kenya), Ms. Klausa (Poland) and \r\nMs. Tardy-De Bortoli (Switzerland) acted as \r\ntellers. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I ask \r\nmembers to cooperate as usual during the voting \r\nprocess. I wish to remind members that once the voting \r\nhas begun, all lobbying activities in the Hall must stop. \r\nIn particular, that means that no more election \r\n A/61/PV.44\r\n \r\n3 06-59416 \r\n \r\npropaganda materials should be distributed. I also ask \r\nall delegations to stay in their seats so that the voting \r\nprocess can proceed smoothly. I thank members for \r\ntheir cooperation.  \r\n A vote was taken by secret ballot.  \r\n The meeting was suspended at 11 a.m. and \r\nresumed at 11.20 a.m. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nresult of the voting is as follows: \r\n Group B — Latin American and Caribbean States \r\n Number of ballot papers:    191 \r\n Number of invalid ballots:    0 \r\n Number of valid ballots:    191 \r\n Abstentions:      4 \r\n Required two-thirds majority:    125 \r\n Number of votes obtained: \r\n  Guatemala      106 \r\n  Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)  78 \r\n  Ecuador      2 \r\n  Jamaica      1 \r\n Since the result of this ballot has again been \r\ninconclusive, there still remains one seat to be filled \r\nfrom among the Latin American and Caribbean States.  \r\n We shall therefore proceed to the forty-fourth \r\nround of balloting, which is the twenty-second \r\nrestricted ballot. This forty-fourth round of balloting \r\nshall be restricted to the two States from among the \r\nLatin American and Caribbean States which were not \r\nelected but obtained the largest number of votes in the \r\nprevious ballot, namely, Guatemala and the Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela. This is in accordance with rule \r\n94 of the rules of procedure. \r\n Before we begin the voting process, I should like \r\nto remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the \r\nrules of procedure of the General Assembly, no \r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting except on a \r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the voting.  \r\n We shall now begin the voting process.
