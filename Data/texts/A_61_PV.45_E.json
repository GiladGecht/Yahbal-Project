The Secretary-General also reports that the \r\nPresident has requested that the terms of office of all \r\n18 ad litem judges be extended until 31 December \r\n2008, which is the date when trials at the International \r\nTribunal are, in accordance with its completion \r\nstrategy, expected to be completed. \r\n Members will recall that the General Assembly, \r\nby its decision 57/414 C of 25 June 2003 and in \r\naccordance with article 12 ter, paragraph 1 (d), of the \r\nstatute of the International Tribunal, elected from a list \r\nof candidates approved by the Security Council 18 ad \r\nlitem judges to a four-year term of office beginning on \r\n25 June 2003. \r\n Of those 18 ad litem judges, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has to date appointed a total of 10 to serve on \r\ntrials at the International Tribunal, nine of whom are, \r\nin accordance with the statute of the Tribunal, currently \r\nserving on either multi-accused or single-accused \r\ntrials. \r\n The Secretary-General also reports that the \r\nPresident of the Tribunal estimates that the multi-\r\naccused trials, in which six ad litem judges are serving, \r\nwill continue beyond 24 June 2007, and, in addition, \r\nthat there are two single-accused trials that the \r\nPresident has indicated may be completed only after \r\n24 June 2007. \r\n The Secretary-General further reports that the \r\nPresident of the International Tribunal does not wish \r\nthe appointment of ad litem judges to new trials that \r\nwill continue beyond 24 June 2007 to be delayed until \r\nA/61/PV.45  \r\n \r\n06-59771 2 \r\n \r\nafter the election of new ad litem judges. He therefore \r\nwishes to be able to request the appointment of ad \r\nlitem judges to new trials as soon as possible. \r\n The President indicates that this may include, \r\ndepending on their expertise and availability, not only \r\nad litem judges who have previously been appointed, \r\nbut also ad litem judges who have not yet been \r\nappointed to serve at the International Tribunal. He has \r\naccordingly requested that the terms of the remaining \r\neight ad litem judges also be extended until \r\n31 December 2008. \r\n As the statute of the International Tribunal does \r\nnot provide for extending the term of office of the \r\nad litem judges, the approval of the Security Council, \r\nas the parent organ of the International Tribunal, and of \r\nthe General Assembly, as the organ that elects its \r\njudges, would be needed in order to extend the term of \r\noffice of all the ad litem judges of the International \r\nTribunal elected on 25 June 2003. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral, therefore, requests that the General Assembly \r\nand the Security Council grant such approval. \r\n Furthermore, in his letter the Secretary-General \r\nreports that the approval of the Security Council and \r\nthe General Assembly is needed to allow Judges Bossa, \r\nArrey, Lattanzi, Muthoga, Short, Hökborg, Hikmet, \r\nKam and Park to serve in the International Tribunal \r\nbeyond the cumulative period of service provided for \r\nunder article 12 ter, paragraph 2, of the statute of the \r\nInternational Tribunal and until 31 December 2008. \r\n Article 12 ter, paragraph 2, provides that: \r\n  “During their term, ad litem judges will be \r\nappointed by the Secretary-General, upon request \r\nof the President of the International Tribunal for \r\nRwanda, to serve in the Trial Chambers for one or \r\nmore trials, for a cumulative period of up to, but \r\nnot including, three years”. \r\n The Secretary-General therefore requests that the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council grant such \r\napproval. \r\n The Secretary-General reports that, as far as the \r\nfinancial consequences of the President’s proposal are \r\nconcerned, ad litem judges will have their terms \r\nextended only until the date when the completion of \r\ntrials is foreseen. The Security Council and the General \r\nAssembly would then, in 2008, be able to review the \r\nstatus of the International Tribunal’s ad litem judges. \r\n The Secretary-General also reports that, in \r\naccordance with General Assembly resolution 57/289, \r\nshould the cumulative period of service of ad litem \r\njudges amount to three years or more, this will not \r\nresult in any change in their entitlements and benefits \r\nand, in particular, will not give rise to any additional \r\nentitlements or benefits other than those that already \r\nexist, which will, in such an eventuality, be extended \r\npro rata by virtue of the extension of their service. \r\n In document A/61/548, the President of the \r\nSecurity Council transmits to the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly the text of Council resolution 1717 \r\n(2006), of 13 October 2006, whereby the Council, inter \r\nalia: \r\n  “1. Decides in response to the request by \r\nthe Secretary-General and notwithstanding the \r\nprovisions of Article 12 ter of the Statute of the \r\nInternational Tribunal for Rwanda, to extend until \r\n31 December 2008 the term of office of the \r\nfollowing ad litem judges of the International \r\nTribunal who were elected on 25 June 2003: \r\nMr. Aydin Sefa Akay (Turkey); Ms. Florence Rita \r\nArrey (Cameroon); Ms. Solomy Balungi Bossa \r\n(Uganda); Mr. Robert Fremr (Czech Republic); \r\nMs. Taghrid Hikmet (Jordan); Ms. Karin Hökborg \r\n(Sweden); Mr. Vagn Joensen (Denmark); \r\nMr. Gberdao Gustave Kam (Burkina Faso); \r\nMs. Flavia Lattanzi (Italy); Mr. Kenneth Machin \r\n(United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern \r\nIreland); Mr. Joseph Edward Chiondo Masanche \r\n(United Republic of Tanzania); Mr. Tan Sri \r\nDato’Hj. Mohd. Azmi Dato’ Hj. Kamaruddin \r\n(Malaysia); Mr. Lee Gacuiga Muthoga (Kenya); \r\nMr. Seon Ki Park (Republic of Korea); \r\nMr. Mparany Mamy Richard Rajohnson \r\n(Madagascar); Mr. Emile Francis Short (Ghana); \r\nMr. Albertus Henricus Johannes Swart \r\n(Netherlands); Ms. Aura E. Guerra de Villalaz \r\n(Panama).  \r\n  “2. Decides in response to the request by \r\nthe Secretary-General to allow ad litem Judges \r\nBossa, Arrey, Lattanzi, Muthoga, Short, Hökborg, \r\nHikmet, Kam and Park to serve in the \r\nInternational Tribunal for Rwanda beyond the \r\ncumulative period of service provided for under \r\nArticle 12 ter of the Statute and until \r\n31 December 2008; \r\n A/61/PV.45\r\n \r\n3 06-59771 \r\n \r\n  “3. Requests States to continue to make \r\nevery effort to ensure that their nationals who \r\nwere elected as ad litem judges of the \r\nInternational Tribunal for Rwanda remain \r\navailable to serve until 31 December 2008”. \r\n If there is no objection, I propose that the \r\nAssembly endorse this recommendation of the \r\nSecretary-General that was endorsed by the Security \r\nCouncil in its resolution 1717 (2006), and that the \r\nrecommendation take effect as of 26 October 2006. \r\n It was so decided. \r\n May I take it that it is the wish of the General \r\nAssembly to conclude its consideration of agenda item \r\n156? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 103 \r\n \r\nElections to fill vacancies in principal organs \r\n \r\n (b) Election of eighteen members of the Economic \r\nand Social Council \r\n \r\n  Letter from the Permanent Representative of \r\nSpain to the President of the General Assembly \r\n(A/61/89) \r\n \r\n  Letter from the Permanent Representative of \r\nTurkey to the President of the General \r\nAssembly (A/61/296) \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will first proceed to a by-election to elect \r\ntwo members of the Economic and Social Council, in \r\naccordance with rule 140 of the rules of procedure. In \r\nthis connection, I would first like to draw the attention \r\nof members to document A/61/89, containing a letter \r\ndated 7 June 2006 from the Permanent Representative \r\nof Spain to the United Nations, in which he announces \r\nthat Spain would like to relinquish its seat on the \r\nEconomic and Social Council for the remainder of its \r\nterm in favour of Portugal. \r\n I would also like to draw the attention of \r\nmembers to document A/61/296, containing a letter \r\ndated 21 August 2006 from the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Turkey to the United Nations, in \r\nwhich he announces that Turkey would like to \r\nrelinquish its seat on the Economic and Social Council \r\nfor the term 2006-2008 in favour of Greece, as of \r\n31 December 2006. \r\n As a result, two vacancies will occur and two new \r\nmembers must therefore be elected to fill the unexpired \r\nterms of office of Spain and Turkey, commencing on \r\n1 January 2007 and expiring 31 December 2008. In \r\naccordance with paragraph 4 of General Assembly \r\nresolution 2847 (XXVI), of 20 December 1971, and \r\ntaking into account that the vacancies will occur from \r\namong the Western European and other States, the two \r\nnew members should therefore be elected from that \r\nregion.  \r\n I should like to inform the Assembly that the \r\ncandidate that receives a two-thirds majority of \r\nmembers present and voting will be declared elected. \r\nIn the case of a tie vote, there will be a special \r\nrestricted ballot limited to those candidates that have \r\nobtained an equal number of votes. May I take it that \r\nthe General Assembly agrees to the procedure?  \r\n It was so decided. \r\n In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of \r\nprocedure, the election shall be held by secret ballot \r\nand there shall be no nominations.  \r\n In accordance with rule 92, we shall now proceed \r\nto the election by secret ballot. \r\n I should like to inform members that as of \r\n1 January 2007, the following States from the Group of \r\nWestern European and other States will be represented \r\non the Economic and Social Council: Australia, \r\nAustria, Denmark, France, Germany, Iceland and the \r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. \r\nTherefore the names of these seven States should not \r\nappear on the ballot.  \r\n Before we begin the voting process, I should like \r\nto remind members that pursuant to rule 88 of the rules \r\nof procedure, no representative shall interrupt the \r\nvoting except on a point of order on the actual conduct \r\nof the vote. I hope that delegates will cooperate during \r\nthe elections and remind them that there should be no \r\nlobbying during the ballots. That means that once the \r\nvoting has started, no campaign or other material \r\nshould be distributed. I call on all delegates to stay in \r\ntheir seats so that we can hold the election in an \r\norderly manner. I thank the delegates for their \r\ncooperation. \r\n We shall now begin the voting process. Members \r\nare requested to remain seated until all ballots have \r\nbeen collected. \r\nA/61/PV.45  \r\n \r\n06-59771 4 \r\n \r\n Ballot papers will now be distributed. I request \r\nrepresentatives to use only those ballot papers that are \r\nbeing distributed and to write on them the names of the \r\ntwo States for which they wish to vote. A ballot paper \r\ncontaining more than two names from the region will \r\nbe declared invalid. If a ballot paper contains the \r\nnames of Member States which do not belong to the \r\nregion, those names will not be counted at all. \r\n At the invitation of the President, Ms. Batista \r\nDíaz (Dominican Republic), Ms. Barthélémy \r\n(France), Ms. Kasymova (Kyrgyzstan), \r\nMs. Aperans (Latvia), Mrs. Rahantabololo \r\n(Madagascar), Ms. Till (New Zealand) and \r\nMr. Oosthuizen (South Africa) acted as tellers. \r\n A vote was taken by secret ballot. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I call on \r\nthe representative of Mali, who wishes to speak on a \r\npoint of order. \r\n Mr. Diarra (Mali) (spoke in French): I am sorry \r\nto interrupt the voting process, but my delegation is not \r\nclear on what is at stake in these elections. It was our \r\nunderstanding that there were four candidates from \r\namong the Group of Western European and other \r\nStates, and that Portugal and Greece were also added to \r\nthe list. My delegation would like some clarifications \r\nbefore voting. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): As I \r\nsaid earlier, the General Assembly is now proceeding \r\nto a by-election to elect two members of the Economic \r\nand Social Council, in accordance with rule 140 of the \r\nrules of procedure.  \r\n I drew the attention of members to a letter from \r\nthe Permanent Representative of Spain to the United \r\nNations announcing that Spain would like to relinquish \r\nits seat on the Economic and Social Council for the \r\nremaining term, in favour of Portugal, and to a letter \r\nfrom the Permanent Representative of Turkey to the \r\nUnited Nations announcing that Turkey would like to \r\nrelinquish its seat on the Council for the term 2006-\r\n2008, in favour of Greece. \r\n Following that, the General Assembly will \r\nproceed to the regular election of 18 members of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council. \r\n At the invitation of the President, Ms. Batista \r\nDíaz (Dominican Republic), Ms. Barthélémy \r\n(France), Ms. Kasymova (Kyrgyzstan), \r\nMs. Aperans (Latvia), Mrs. Rahantabololo \r\n(Madagascar), Ms. Till (New Zealand) and \r\nMr. Oosthuizen (South Africa) acted as tellers. \r\n A vote was taken by secret ballot. \r\n The meeting was suspended at 10.40 a.m. and \r\nresumed at 11.20 a.m. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nresult of the voting is as follows: \r\n Group E — Western European and other States \r\n Number of ballot papers:   189 \r\n Number of invalid ballots:   5 \r\n Number of valid ballots:   184 \r\n Abstentions:     5 \r\n Required two-thirds majority:  120 \r\n Number of votes obtained: \r\n  Portugal      133 \r\n  Greece      129 \r\n  Canada      28 \r\n  Luxembourg     25 \r\n  Netherlands     15 \r\n  United States     15 \r\n Having obtained the required two-thirds majority, \r\nGreece and Portugal have thus been elected members \r\nof the Economic and Social Council for a term of \r\noffice beginning on 1 January 2007 and ending on \r\n31 December 2008. \r\n I congratulate Greece and Portugal, which have \r\nbeen elected members of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil. \r\n The General Assembly will next turn to the \r\nelection of 18 members of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil to replace those members whose term of office \r\nexpires on 31 December 2006. \r\n The 18 outgoing members are: Armenia, \r\nBangladesh, Belize, Belgium, Canada, Colombia, \r\nIndonesia, Italy, Mauritius, Namibia, Nigeria, Panama, \r\nPoland, the Republic of Korea, Tunisia, the United \r\nArab Emirates, the United Republic of Tanzania and \r\nthe United States of America. \r\n Pursuant to rule 146 of the rules of procedure, \r\nthose countries are eligible for immediate re-election. \r\n Members will recall that Greece and Portugal \r\nhave just been elected to fill the two seats relinquished \r\nby Spain and Turkey, effective 1 January 2007. \r\n A/61/PV.45\r\n \r\n5 06-59771 \r\n \r\n Consequently, as of 1 January 2007, the \r\nfollowing States will be represented on the Economic \r\nand Social Council: Albania, Angola, Australia, \r\nAustria, Benin, Brazil, Chad, China, Costa Rica, Cuba, \r\nthe Czech Republic, Denmark, the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, France, Germany, Greece, \r\nGuinea, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, Iceland, India, \r\nJapan, Lithuania, Madagascar, Mauritania, Mexico, \r\nPakistan, Paraguay, Portugal, the Russian Federation, \r\nSaudi Arabia, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Thailand and \r\nthe United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern \r\nIreland. \r\n The names of those 36 States should therefore not \r\nappear on the ballots. \r\n In accordance with paragraph 4 of General \r\nAssembly resolution 2847 (XXVI), of 20 December \r\n1971, and taking into account the number of States that \r\nwill remain members of the Council after 1 January \r\n2007, the 18 members should be elected as follows: \r\nfive from African States, four from Asian States, two \r\nfrom Eastern European States, three from Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean States and four from Western \r\nEuropean and other States. The ballot papers reflect \r\nthat pattern. \r\n I should like to inform the Assembly that those \r\ncandidates, their number not exceeding the number of \r\nseats to be filled, that receive the greatest number of \r\nvotes and a two-thirds majority of members present \r\nand voting will be declared elected. \r\n In the case of a tie vote for a remaining seat, \r\nthere will be a special restricted ballot limited to those \r\ncandidates that have obtained an equal number of \r\nvotes. \r\n May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to \r\nthat procedure? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): In \r\naccordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, the \r\nelection shall be held by secret ballot, and there shall \r\nbe no nominations. \r\n Regarding candidatures of the respective regional \r\ngroups, the Secretariat has been informed that for the \r\nfive vacant seats from among the African States, the \r\nGroup has endorsed five candidates: Algeria, Cape \r\nVerde, Malawi, Somalia and the Sudan. For the four \r\nvacant seats from among the Asian States, the Group \r\nhas endorsed four candidates: Indonesia, Iraq, \r\nKazakhstan and the Philippines. For the two vacant \r\nseats from among the Eastern European States, there \r\nare three candidates: Belarus, Bulgaria and Romania. \r\n For the three vacant seats from among the Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean States, there are four \r\ncandidates: Argentina, Barbados, Bolivia and \r\nEl Salvador. \r\n For the four vacant seats from among the Western \r\nEuropean and other States, the Group has endorsed \r\nfour candidates: Canada, Luxembourg, the Netherlands \r\nand the United States of America. \r\n In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of \r\nprocedure, we shall now proceed to the election by \r\nsecret ballot. \r\n Before we begin the voting process, I should like \r\nto remind members that pursuant to rule 88 of the rules \r\nof procedure of the General Assembly, no \r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting except on a \r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the voting. \r\n We shall now begin the voting process. Members \r\nare requested to remain seated until all ballots have \r\nbeen collected.  \r\n Ballot papers marked “A”, “B”, “C”, “D” and “E” \r\nwill now be distributed. I request representatives to use \r\nonly those ballot papers and to write on them the \r\nnames of the States for which they wish to vote. A \r\nballot paper containing more names from the relevant \r\nregion than the number of seats assigned to it will be \r\ndeclared invalid. If a ballot paper contains names of \r\nMember States that do not belong to that region, those \r\nnames will not be counted at all. \r\n At the invitation of the President, Ms. Batista \r\nDíaz (Dominican Republic), Ms. Barthélémy \r\n(France), Ms. Kasymova (Kyrgyzstan), \r\nMs. Aperans (Latvia), Mrs. Rahantabololo \r\n(Madagascar), Ms. Till (New Zealand) and \r\nMr. Oosthuizen (South Africa) acted as tellers. \r\n A vote was taken by secret ballot. \r\n The meeting was suspended at 11.40 a.m. and \r\nresumed at 12.50 p.m. \r\n The Acting President: The result of the voting is \r\nas follows: \r\nA/61/PV.45  \r\n \r\n06-59771 6 \r\n \r\n Group A — African States  \r\n Number of ballot papers:   192 \r\n Number of invalid ballots:   0 \r\n Number of valid ballots:   192 \r\n Abstentions:     2 \r\n Required two-thirds majority:  127 \r\n Number of votes obtained: \r\n  Cape Verde    187 \r\n  Algeria     184 \r\n  Malawi     184 \r\n  Somalia     180 \r\n  Sudan     170 \r\n Group B — Asian States \r\n Number of ballot papers:   192 \r\n Number of invalid ballots:   0 \r\n Number of valid ballots:   192 \r\n Abstentions:     3 \r\n Required two-thirds majority:  126 \r\n Number of votes obtained: \r\n  Philippines    188 \r\n  Kazakhstan    187 \r\n  Indonesia     184 \r\n  Iraq      181 \r\n  Myanmar     1 \r\n Group C — Eastern European States \r\n Number of ballot papers:   192 \r\n Number of invalid ballots:   0 \r\n Number of valid ballots:   192 \r\n Abstentions:     1 \r\n Required two-thirds majority:  128 \r\n Number of votes obtained: \r\n  Romania     139 \r\n  Bulgaria     123 \r\n  Belarus     112 \r\n Group D — Latin American and Caribbean States \r\n Number of ballot papers:   192 \r\n Number of invalid ballots:    0 \r\n Number of valid ballots:   192 \r\n Abstentions:      0 \r\n Required two-thirds majority:  128 \r\n Number of votes obtained: \r\n  Barbados     160 \r\n  Bolivia     138 \r\n  El Salvador    133 \r\n  Argentina      120 \r\n Group E — Western European and other States \r\n Number of ballot papers:   192 \r\n Number of invalid ballots:   0 \r\n Number of valid ballots:   192 \r\n Abstentions:      6 \r\n Required two-thirds majority:  124 \r\n Number of votes obtained: \r\n  Luxembourg    185 \r\n  Netherlands    176 \r\n  Canada     175 \r\n  United States    168 \r\n  Spain      1 \r\n Having obtained the required two-thirds majority \r\nand the largest number of votes, Algeria, \r\nBarbados, Bolivia, Canada, Cape Verde, El \r\nSalvador, Indonesia, Iraq, Kazakhstan, \r\nLuxembourg, Malawi, the Netherlands, the \r\nPhilippines, Romania, Somalia, the Sudan and \r\nthe United States of America were elected \r\nmembers of the Economic and Social Council for \r\na three-year term beginning 1 January 2007. \r\n The Acting President: There still remains one \r\nseat to be filled from among the Eastern European \r\nStates.  \r\n We shall therefore proceed to the first restricted \r\nballot. \r\n This second round of balloting shall be restricted \r\nto the two States from among the Eastern European \r\nStates that were not elected but that obtained the \r\nlargest number of votes in the previous ballot, namely, \r\nBelarus and Bulgaria. That is in accordance with rule \r\n94 of the rules of procedure. \r\n Before we begin the voting process, I should like \r\nto remind members that pursuant to rule 88 of the rules \r\nof procedure of the General Assembly, no \r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting except on a \r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the voting. \r\n We shall now begin the voting process. Members \r\nare requested to remain seated until all ballots have \r\nbeen collected.  \r\n Ballot papers marked “C” will now be \r\ndistributed. \r\n May I ask representatives to write on the ballot \r\npapers the name of the State for which they wish to  \r\n A/61/PV.45\r\n \r\n7 06-59771 \r\n \r\nvote. Ballot papers marked “C”, for the Eastern \r\nEuropean States, will be declared invalid if they \r\ncontain the name of a State other than Belarus or \r\nBulgaria, or if they contain the name of more than one \r\nState. \r\n At the invitation of the President, Ms. Batista \r\nDíaz (Dominican Republic), Ms. Barthélémy \r\n(France), Ms. Kasymova (Kyrgyzstan), \r\nMs. Aperans (Latvia), Mrs. Rahantabololo \r\n(Madagascar), Ms. Till (New Zealand) and \r\nMr. Oosthuizen (South Africa) acted as tellers. \r\n A vote was taken by secret ballot. \r\n The meeting was suspended at 1 p.m. and \r\nresumed at 1.20 p.m. \r\n The Acting President: The result of the voting is \r\nas follows: \r\n Group C — Eastern European States \r\n Number of ballot papers:   184 \r\n Number of invalid ballots:   1 \r\n Number of valid ballots:   183 \r\n Abstentions:      2 \r\n Required two-thirds majority:  120 \r\n Number of votes obtained: \r\n  Belarus      90 \r\n  Bulgaria      89 \r\n This restricted ballot has once again been \r\ninconclusive. There still remains one seat to be filled \r\nfrom among the Eastern European States. \r\n In accordance with the rules of procedure, we \r\nshould continue with the series of restricted ballots. \r\nHowever, in view of the lateness of the hour, I propose \r\nthat we postpone further balloting until 3 p.m. today. \r\n It was so decided. \r\n  The meeting rose at 1.20 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
