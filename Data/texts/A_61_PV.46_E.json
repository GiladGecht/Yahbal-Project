In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of \r\nprocedure, we shall now proceed to the next round of \r\nballoting by secret ballot. The third round of balloting \r\nwill, in accordance with rule 94 of the rules of \r\nprocedure, also be the second restricted ballot. \r\n This third round of balloting shall be restricted to \r\nthe two States from among the Eastern European States \r\nthat were not elected but obtained the largest number \r\nof votes in the previous ballot, namely, Belarus and \r\nBulgaria. That is in accordance with rule 94 of the \r\nrules of procedure. \r\n Before we begin the voting process, I should like \r\nto remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the \r\nrules of procedure of the General Assembly, no \r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting except on a \r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the voting.  \r\n We shall now begin the voting process. Members \r\nare requested to remain seated until all ballots have \r\nbeen collected. \r\n Ballot papers marked “C” will now be distributed. \r\nMay I ask representatives to write on the ballot papers the \r\nname of one State for which they wish to vote. Ballot \r\npapers marked “C”, for the Eastern European States, will \r\nbe declared invalid if they contain the name of State other \r\nthan Belarus or Bulgaria, as well as if they contain the \r\nname of more than one State. \r\n At the invitation of the Acting President, Ms. Batista \r\nDíaz (Dominican Republic), Ms. Barthélémy \r\n(France), Ms. Kasymova (Kyrgyzstan), Ms. Aperans \r\n(Latvia) and Ms. Till (New Zealand) acted as \r\ntellers. \r\n A vote was taken by secret ballot. \r\n The meeting was suspended at 3.25 p.m. and \r\nresumed at 3.40 p.m. \r\n The Acting President: The result of the voting is \r\nas follows: \r\nA/61/PV.46  \r\n \r\n06-60673 2 \r\n \r\n Group C – Eastern European States \r\nNumber of ballot papers:   186 \r\nNumber of invalid ballots:   2 \r\nNumber of valid ballots:   184 \r\nAbstentions:     3 \r\nRequired two-thirds majority:  121 \r\nVotes obtained: \r\n Belarus     93 \r\n Bulgaria     88 \r\n Since no candidate obtained the required two-\r\nthirds majority in the previous ballot, there remains \r\none seat to be filled from among the Eastern European \r\nStates.

Thereafter, we shall continue \r\nwith the election of the members of the Economic and \r\nSocial Council. In connection with the Economic and \r\nSocial Council election, I would also like to announce \r\nto members that I have been informed by the \r\ndelegation of Australia that it wishes to relinquish its \r\nseat on the Economic and Social Council for the \r\nremainder of its term, in favour of New Zealand. \r\nConsequently, the Assembly will conduct another by-\r\nelection to fill that seat. \r\n The meeting rose at 6.35 p.m. \r\n"
