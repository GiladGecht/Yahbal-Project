(Bahrain) \r\n \r\n \r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Al-Murad \r\n(Kuwait), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 44 (continued) \r\n \r\nCulture of peace \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/61/175) \r\n \r\n  Draft resolutions (A/61/L.11 and A/61/L.16) \r\n \r\n Mr. Zaki (Pakistan): Today we are considering \r\nthe important agenda item entitled “Culture of peace”. \r\nWe are grateful to the Secretary-General for his report \r\non this item contained in document A/61/175. Pakistan \r\nhas had a long-standing association with this subject \r\nand has endeavoured to promote a culture of peace \r\nthrough its traditional resolution entitled “Promotion of \r\nreligious and cultural understanding, harmony and \r\ncooperation” in the General Assembly. That resolution \r\nhas been adopted by consensus in successive sessions \r\nof the General Assembly at the fifty-eighth, fifty-ninth \r\nand sixtieth sessions.  \r\n This year marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of \r\nthe Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of \r\nIntolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or \r\nBelief, which the General Assembly adopted in 1981, by \r\nresolution 36/55. Article 3 of the Declaration states that  \r\n  “Discrimination between human beings on \r\ngrounds of religion or belief constitutes an affront \r\nto human dignity and a disavowal of the \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nand shall be condemned as a violation of the \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms \r\nproclaimed in the Universal Declaration of \r\nHuman Rights [of 1948]”. \r\n The Declaration encouraged the promotion of \r\nunderstanding, tolerance and respect for religion and \r\nbelief and acknowledged that freedom of religion \r\nshould contribute to the attainment of the goals of \r\nworld peace, social justice and friendship among \r\npeoples, and to the elimination of ideologies or \r\npractices of colonialism, racism and racial \r\ndiscrimination. Building on the same principles, in \r\n1999 the General Assembly adopted the historic \r\nDeclaration on a Culture of Peace, which emphasized \r\nthe promotion of multilateral cooperation, respect for \r\nlife, the ending of violence and the freedom and \r\npractice of non-violence through dialogue, cooperation \r\nand commitment to the peaceful settlement of disputes. \r\n The significance of those international \r\ncommitments to promote tolerance and peace are \r\nparticularly relevant in today’s globalized world, where \r\nthere is increased interaction among all cultures and \r\ncivilizations. Such close interaction has given rise to \r\nnew forms of exchanges and understanding among \r\npeoples across regions, and has provided unprecedented \r\nopportunities for the transmission of ideas. \r\n Ironically, those vast networks of connectivity \r\nand interdependence have not only brought peoples \r\ncloser to each other but, at the same time, have \r\nproduced divisions and friction among and within \r\nA/61/PV.48  \r\n \r\n06-60547 2 \r\n \r\nsocieties. The proliferation of the sources and channels \r\nof information has, while promoting better knowledge \r\nof other peoples, quite often reinforced stereotypes and \r\ndeepened differences and alienation. Indeed, the gulf of \r\nmisunderstanding among faiths and civilizations seems \r\nto have grown wider. Quite often, those divisions and \r\nfrictions are manifested in religious tones and tenors. \r\nThere is both a knowledge deficit and an understanding \r\ndeficit. \r\n As the world today is composed of States with \r\ndiverse political, economic, social and cultural systems \r\nthat have been determined by their history, traditions \r\nand cultural values, the stability of international peace \r\nand security can only be guaranteed by the universal \r\nrecognition of the rights of all peoples and nations to \r\nfreely determine their own approach towards progress \r\nand development. The role of the General Assembly is \r\nimperative in building an environment conducive to \r\ncreating an equitable world order, as envisaged in the \r\nProgramme of Action on a Culture of Peace. \r\n Acknowledging that important role, the President \r\nof the sixtieth session expressed strong commitment to \r\nthe need for dialogue and understanding among \r\ncivilizations, cultures and religions to prevent \r\nprovocative incidents and to develop better ways of \r\ntolerance and respect for religions and beliefs. We hope \r\nthat the sixty-first session, under the able leadership of \r\nits President, will continue that work and make a \r\npositive contribution to promote and advance much \r\nneeded dialogue on the important and sensitive issue of \r\nrespect for religions. \r\n In her report to the sixty-first session, the Special \r\nRapporteur on freedom of religion or belief highlighted \r\nthe alarming trend of religious intolerance in many \r\nregions of the world. The Rapporteur noted with concern \r\nthat “tolerance between religious communities was \r\n[adversely affected by] the actions carried out by … \r\ngovernmental bodies and ... the negative role played by \r\n… media in stigmatizing certain religious communities.” \r\n(A/61/340, para. 26) \r\n The General Assembly, as well as the Human \r\nRights Council, should assume the leading \r\nresponsibility in developing ways and means to help \r\navert the worst consequences of the defamation of \r\nreligions manifested in instances of Islamophobia. \r\n There are some embryonic legal elements in the \r\nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights \r\nand the International Convention on the Elimination of \r\nAll Forms of Racial Discrimination that deal with \r\nincitement to religious hatred. While there is a need to \r\nsincerely invoke and apply all those existing \r\nmechanisms to promote understanding among religions \r\nand civilizations, there is also an urgent need to fill the \r\njuridical vacuum and redress the paucity of relevant \r\nlaws that address issues relating to religious \r\nintolerance. In that regard, Pakistan would like to make \r\nthe following proposals. \r\n First, the General Assembly, as well as the \r\nHuman Rights Council, through their appropriate \r\nresolutions and decisions, should condemn religious \r\nintolerance and address the defamation of religions, in \r\nparticular the unwarranted linkage of Islam with \r\nviolence and terrorism. The United Nations, in its \r\nendeavour to promote religious multiculturalism, \r\nshould appeal to the larger membership to deter and \r\ndiscourage antagonism and discrimination against \r\nIslam and Muslim peoples. \r\n Secondly, during its current session the General \r\nAssembly should hold a high-level event involving \r\ncivil society organizations to focus on the issue of the \r\nincitement to racial and religious hatred and the \r\npromotion of tolerance. \r\n Following the recommendations of the Special \r\nRapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, the \r\nGeneral Assembly should encourage Member States to \r\ncommence consultations to develop an international \r\nstrategy to address the issue of religious intolerance \r\nand to prepare a legally binding instrument to combat \r\nthe defamation of religion and prevent religious \r\nintolerance. \r\n In order to promote harmony and cooperation \r\namong cultures and civilizations, President General \r\nPervez Musharraf of Pakistan has advanced a strategy \r\nof enlightened moderation that highlights the principles \r\nof enhancing human welfare, freedom and progress \r\neverywhere, of forging harmony and understanding \r\namong all peoples and of seeking the peaceful \r\nresolution of conflicts and disputes. That strategy was \r\nendorsed by the Summit of the Organization of the \r\nIslamic Conference held in Putrajaya, Malaysia, in \r\n2003. \r\n In conclusion, I am pleased to announce that, in \r\nline with our past practice to promote a culture of \r\npeace at the United Nations, Pakistan, in collaboration \r\nwith the Philippines, will once again introduce a draft \r\nresolution on promoting religious and cultural \r\n A/61/PV.48\r\n \r\n3 06-60547 \r\n \r\nunderstanding during the sixty-first session. Inter alia, \r\nthe draft resolution will emphasize the need to \r\nstrengthen freedom, justice, tolerance, cooperation and \r\nrespect for the diversity of cultures and religions as \r\nimportant elements in building international peace and \r\nsecurity.  \r\n It is our hope that the General Assembly will \r\nadopt that draft resolution by consensus. That would be \r\na manifestation of our collective resolve to promote \r\npeace, prosperity and hope for all, and a categorical \r\nrejection of intolerance, hatred and discrimination. It is \r\nimperative that ethnicity, religion, culture, language \r\nand race not be allowed to become a source of \r\ndivisiveness among our common humanity. We the \r\nrepresentatives assembled here must be the catalysts of \r\ncooperation, and not the prophets of doom. We must \r\naffirm the indivisibility of the human race. We must \r\nreassert our common humanity and our common \r\nuniversal values. It is only thus that we can build a \r\nstable structure of peace and harmony among all the \r\npeoples of the United Nations. \r\n Mr. Aldai Ali (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I have the pleasure and honour to extend to the \r\nActing President my congratulations and respect on his \r\nelection to assist in presiding over the General \r\nAssembly, a forum for collaborative efforts to address \r\nhuman concerns. I am also especially pleased to \r\ncongratulate Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa on her \r\nelection as the first Arab woman to assume the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly. \r\n My delegation has studied the report of the \r\nSecretary-General regarding the promotion of \r\ninterreligious dialogue (A/60/201), as well as the report \r\nregarding the comprehensive mid-term review of the \r\nInternational Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-\r\nViolence for the Children of the World (2001-2010), \r\nprepared by UNESCO and transmitted under a note by \r\nthe Secretary-General (A/60/279). While we commend \r\nthe progress achieved by Member States and agencies \r\nof the United Nations, as well as by non-governmental \r\norganizations, in the various areas covered by the \r\nInternational Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-\r\nViolence, we have also taken note of the hurdles that have \r\nimpeded the achievement of progress in other areas.  \r\n Peace has been one of the major objectives of \r\nUNESCO since its establishment at the end of the \r\nSecond World War. UNESCO has taken up the task of \r\nbuilding the culture of peace in the minds of people \r\nsince the end of the twentieth century. That is a very \r\ncomplicated task, given the state of the world today, in \r\nwhich there is both war and major economic and \r\nstrategic changes. \r\n In defining the culture of peace, UNESCO has \r\nproven itself to be an organization of values, promoting \r\ncommon attitudes and behaviours based on non-\r\nviolence and respect for the fundamental rights of \r\nhuman beings and in fostering understanding, tolerance \r\nand unity. It has done so in a framework of cooperation \r\nthat encourages contributions by all social groups and \r\npromotes the exchange of information. \r\n The culture of peace is closely linked to the \r\npromotion of development, economic and social \r\nsecurity, democracy, political stability, disarmament, \r\nmilitary security, economic equality and dialogue and \r\ninternational cohesion. Developing a culture of peace \r\nis based on shared international values, including \r\nrespect for human life, freedom, justice, unity, \r\ntolerance, human rights and gender equality. It is well \r\nunderstood that peace based on justice, respect for \r\nhuman rights and individual dignity is also a \r\nhumanitarian objective in its own right. Peace is the \r\nroad to construction and stability and an avenue to \r\ncreativity and innovation in all areas.  \r\n The Sudan’s current generation was raised on the \r\nbasis of the principles to which I have referred. Those \r\nprinciples have led to peace in my country. Today’s \r\ngeneration was not raised to respect war and \r\naggression. In fact, following the example of their \r\ngreat forefathers, our people have rejected war, \r\ninjustice and persecution and have chosen to protect \r\ntheir land, honour and property. He who dies without \r\nprotecting his land, honour and property is a martyr. \r\nPeace has also become a strategic objective of my \r\ncountry: it is the cornerstone of development and \r\nprogress.  \r\n As the Sudan looks ahead to a bright future of \r\npeace, following many years of civil war that led to the \r\ndeaths of more than 2 million of my fellow citizens and \r\nthe displacement of more than 4 million women, \r\nchildren and the elderly — in addition to the \r\ndestruction of infrastructure and natural resources — at \r\nthe beginning of 2005 my country attained its most \r\nimportant achievement in its modern history, namely, \r\nthe Comprehensive Peace Agreement covering the \r\nsouthern part of our country. That Agreement put an \r\nend to bloodshed that lasted for 22 years. Following \r\nA/61/PV.48  \r\n \r\n06-60547 4 \r\n \r\nthat very important development, the Sudan has \r\nfocused its efforts on making the Agreement a reality. \r\nNow, nearly two years since the conclusion of the \r\nAgreement, the list of our accomplishments includes \r\nthe implementation of several of the Agreement’s \r\nprovisions at the federal and provincial levels. \r\n This year, my country added to that achievement \r\nyet another accomplishment by signing the Abuja \r\nPeace Agreement on Darfur. That undertaking was \r\nsponsored by the African Union and generously hosted \r\nby our sisterly country, Nigeria. My Government is \r\nhard at work to convince the other parties to adhere to \r\nthe Agreement, in order that peace and stability may \r\nprevail throughout the Sudan. In that regard, I wish to \r\nsay that my Government’s efforts will continue. We \r\nhave achieved a comprehensive peace agreement of \r\nutmost importance in the eastern part of the country. \r\nThat accord was gratefully sponsored by our brotherly \r\ncountry, Eritrea. \r\n In the context of that peaceful environment, the \r\nSudan has worked to make the culture of peace a \r\nreality — transforming it from theory to daily practice. \r\nIn that connection, with the assistance of United \r\nNations specialized agencies, the Sudan launched a \r\nprogramme to help refugees and displaced persons \r\nreturn to their land. We have also provided assistance \r\nto those who have returned voluntarily so they may \r\nresume normal lives. In addition, we have successfully \r\ncarried out a disarmament, demobilization and \r\nreintegration programme, to enable former combatants \r\nto return to civilian lives, civil society and jobs. \r\nMoreover, we are working to make it possible for \r\nreturnee children to continue their education through \r\nintensive educational programmes that include the \r\nprinciples and values of a culture of peace and \r\ntolerance.  \r\n Following that same approach, my Government \r\nhas put in place special committees to amend laws to \r\nbring them into conformity with the transitional \r\nconstitution, promulgate a law on political parties and \r\nspeed up the process of national reconciliation and \r\nrehabilitation. In addition to putting in place special \r\npriority programmes to fulfil the requirements of peace \r\nand security by implementing and strengthening the \r\nprinciples of the Peace Agreement, my Government has \r\nalso continued to set up appropriate machinery for \r\nconflict prevention and resolution. We have stepped up \r\neducational and awareness campaigns to promote the \r\nculture of peace by conducting studies on the resettling \r\nof nomads and controlling the arbitrary expansion of \r\nagricultural projects, as well as by putting into effect \r\nlocal laws to resolve conflicts and disputes. \r\n The Sudan is determined to continue to achieve a \r\npeaceful resolution for the issue of Darfur, a solution \r\nthat is in the interests of the peoples of the region, and \r\nto implement fully the provisions of the agreements \r\nreached at Naivasha, Cairo, Abuja and eastern Sudan. \r\nWhenever possible, we will also work to speed up the \r\nestablishment of the machinery agreed upon within the \r\nset timeframes, as agreed by the parties. We will also \r\ncontinue to address the issues of refugees and \r\ndisplaced persons. \r\n My country is working to develop a federal \r\nregime on sound bases by expanding the authority and \r\nmandate of our provinces, at the expense of the central \r\nGovernment, as well as to bring development to those \r\nareas that are underdeveloped or that have been \r\naffected by war. We are also working to step up \r\ncampaigns to raise awareness and guidance about the \r\nculture of peace, especially in tribal areas. We are \r\ntrying to involve local, provincial and national \r\nauthorities in the reconciliation process and to \r\nrepatriate nomads, providing them with safe drinking \r\nwater and enabling them to relocate in order to avoid \r\ntribal disputes. \r\n In the field of information, the Sudan has worked \r\nto expand national and provincial radio and television \r\nprogrammes and broadcasts focusing on a culture of \r\npeace. A number of centres for the promotion of a \r\nculture of peace have been set up in universities and \r\nother places of higher learning, as well as in civil \r\nsociety organizations. The Sudan has also worked with \r\nthe press and publications centre to raise awareness \r\nabout a culture of peace and to encourage the \r\nexpression of diverse local cultures and languages, \r\nunder the theme of “Unity in diversity”. \r\n In that context, my Government has continued to \r\ndevote particular attention to the issues of religion and \r\nof freedom of belief and worship, with emphasis on \r\nlocal religious beliefs. My Government has also \r\nestablished and supported a number of civil society \r\norganizations focusing on religion, a dialogue of \r\ncultures and peaceful coexistence. \r\n My country is very concerned at current tensions \r\nand quarrels at the regional and international levels, \r\ngiven that certain Powers are fomenting and enjoying \r\nconflict among religions and cultures, defaming other \r\n A/61/PV.48\r\n \r\n5 06-60547 \r\n \r\nreligions instead of respecting them and their \r\nfollowers. The caricatures that mocked our Prophet \r\nMuhammad and other such actions are reprehensible \r\nand will come back to haunt their perpetrators. This \r\nrepresents a setback in terms of our achievements in \r\nthe context of the interreligious and intercultural \r\ndialogue. We must therefore ensure that a mechanism \r\nis put in place to put an end to any defamation of \r\nreligions, cultures or societies, in order to maintain \r\ninternational peace, security and stability. \r\n My country fulfilled its commitment to achieve \r\nthe agreement that led to the Comprehensive Peace \r\nAgreement. It is continuing to deploy efforts in the \r\nwestern and eastern parts of the country to make the \r\nculture of peace and agreement thereon a reality. This \r\nwill require that the international community fulfil the \r\nfinancial pledges it made at the Oslo donors conference. \r\nWe hope that it will support the mechanisms necessary \r\nto ensure the full realization of the culture of peace and \r\nstability to which we all aspire. \r\n We cannot speak of the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security in today’s world without focusing on \r\nefforts to deal with emerging conflicts and their causes, \r\nin addition to promoting a multifaceted culture of peace \r\nby including Governments, United Nations agencies and \r\nnon-governmental organizations in the process. \r\n Mr. Hamidon (Malaysia): My delegation is \r\nencouraged by the efforts of various United Nations \r\nbodies, under the coordination of UNESCO, to \r\npromote a culture of peace. \r\n The decade 2001-2010 was designated as the \r\nInternational Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-\r\nViolence for the Children of the World. As we \r\napproach the end of 2006, a little more than midway \r\nthrough this decade, we should pause and reflect on \r\nwhether our efforts have contributed to the realization \r\nof a culture of peace. \r\n If we take peace to mean more than just the \r\nabsence of war, but also justice and equity for all as a \r\nbasis for living together in harmony and free from \r\nviolence, I would point out, offering my own country \r\nas a humble example, that Malaysia has achieved that \r\ngoal. This can be seen in the relations that characterize its \r\nmulti-ethnic, multireligious and multicultural society. \r\n It is no accident that this has been achieved. \r\nSince our independence, almost five decades ago, the \r\nMalaysian Government, through concerted and \r\nconsistent efforts, has sought to build a stable and \r\nprosperous nation by implementing policies that \r\nemphasize the creation of a just and equitable society, \r\ndespite the different beliefs, religions and ethnicities of \r\nits people. In many ways, the socio-economic and \r\npolitical policies pursued by Malaysia in effect \r\nincorporate many of the areas for action outlined in the \r\nUnited Nations Declaration and Programme of Action \r\non a Culture of Peace. \r\n Among the eight action areas in the Declaration \r\nand Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace, I \r\nwould highlight the sixth, which concerns advancing \r\nunderstanding, tolerance and solidarity. It was in this \r\ncontext, in 2001, that the United Nations \r\ncommemorated the International Year of Dialogue \r\namong Civilizations. On that note, I have to say that \r\nwe are still far from where we were five years ago in \r\nachieving understanding, tolerance and solidarity \r\namong the peoples of the world, which are represented \r\nin the United Nations. \r\n Let us recall that it was around this time a year \r\nago that the world was shaken by images of the \r\noutpourings of discontent and anger that followed the \r\npublication of caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad, a \r\nsacred figure central to the Islamic faith and close to \r\nthe hearts of its faithful. Have we really learned any \r\nlessons from the pain, hurt and loss experienced on \r\nboth sides, or was it all in vain? \r\n We are fully aware that the world we live in is \r\nchanging. Where there were once national borders \r\nseparating peoples, borderlessness prevails. Goods, \r\nservices and labour are flowing more freely due to the \r\nprocess of trade liberalization and globalization, but \r\nthis has been accompanied by the opening of a \r\nPandora’s box. Ideas, beliefs and cultures intermingle \r\nand mix and, at times, as we have seen recently, could \r\nlead to explosive situations. \r\n I would say that my country is not too different \r\nfrom New York City. They are both rich and teeming \r\nwith life due to the kaleidoscopic makeup of their \r\npeople. But this experience is not without its \r\nchallenges, which we must address. \r\n In that regard, allow me to quote from the \r\npreamble to the Constitution of UNESCO: \r\n“Since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the \r\nminds of men that the defences of peace must be \r\nconstructed”.  \r\nA/61/PV.48  \r\n \r\n06-60547 6 \r\n \r\n Those words carry a deep meaning on which we \r\nshould meditate, particularly here in the General \r\nAssembly, where the peoples of the world are \r\nrepresented and where we can have a meeting of the \r\nminds so as to seek to promote understanding, \r\ntolerance and solidarity, and, hopefully, achieve a \r\nculture of peace. \r\n Mr. Zhang Dan (China) (spoke in Chinese): \r\nCivilization is a product of human progress and \r\ndevelopment. During its long history, humankind has \r\ncreated, nurtured and developed civilizations of all \r\nkinds. History has taught us that dialogue, exchanges \r\nand, indeed, convergence among various civilizations \r\nare a natural tendency and an intrinsic desire on the \r\npart of all civilizations aimed at their own refinement \r\nand sustained development. \r\n We believe that consideration by the General \r\nAssembly of the agenda item on a culture of peace is \r\nconducive to reinforcing a dialogue among \r\ncivilizations, promoting the settlement of disputes by \r\npeaceful means and establishing a family of nations \r\ncharacterized by harmonious coexistence. In recent \r\nyears, the relevance of the concept of a culture of \r\npeace has grown increasingly important, especially \r\nwhen considering the idea that it is necessary to avoid \r\nequating terrorism with any specific civilization or \r\nreligion in the fight against terrorism. \r\n The Chinese nation has always been peace-\r\nloving. Our ancient thinkers have left us with a great \r\nconcept of “concord with difference” — that is, concord \r\nwithout monotony and difference without conflict. \r\nObserving and addressing issues from that perspective \r\nwill not only help countries maintain friendly relations \r\nwith their neighbours, but also facilitate the resolution \r\nof disputes in the international community. \r\n The Chinese delegation is pleased to note that, by \r\nadopting the Declaration and Programme of Action on \r\na Culture of Peace and the Programme of Action of the \r\nGlobal Agenda for Dialogue among Civilizations, the \r\ninternational community is paying increasing attention \r\nto dialogue among different civilizations. The relevant \r\nUnited Nations and international organizations and \r\ntheir member States have used various means, \r\nincluding study visits, educational activities and \r\nscientific research, to help people of various countries \r\nacquire a better understanding of the cultures and \r\nreligions of other people. All of that has greatly \r\npromoted the culture of peace. \r\n The long process of history has left humanity \r\nwith a rich cultural heritage. That heritage, unique to \r\neach nation, is the valuable property not only of \r\nindividual nations and peoples, but also of all \r\nhumankind. The Chinese Government has always \r\nattached great importance to the protection of cultural \r\nheritage. It has acceded to relevant international \r\ninstruments such as the Convention on the Means of \r\nProhibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export \r\nand Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property and the \r\nConvention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible \r\nCultural Heritage. It has also set up a framework \r\ncomprising its own system of laws in that regard, based \r\non the law of the People’s Republic of China on the \r\nprotection of cultural relics. \r\n The Government has designated the second \r\nSaturday of June of each year, as Cultural Heritage \r\nDay, with the aim of raising the awareness of the \r\ngeneral public of the importance of the protection of \r\ncultural heritage, and to create a favourable atmosphere \r\nto encourage everyone to take part in such endeavours. \r\n China will continue to participate actively in the \r\nactivities of UNESCO in returning cultural property to \r\ntheir countries of origin, in seeking appropriate solutions \r\nin that regard and in contributing to international efforts \r\ntowards the protection of cultural heritage.  \r\n Mr. Chabar (Morocco) (spoke in French): At the \r\noutset, my delegation wishes to thank the UNESCO for \r\nthe quality of its report (see A/61/175) and for the \r\nrelevant information it contains. The holding of this \r\ndebate is an opportunity for the international \r\ncommunity to assess initiatives taken so far to promote \r\na culture of peace and to develop forums for dialogue \r\namong civilizations and religions. It is also an \r\nopportunity to say to those who speak of the clash of \r\ncivilizations that such a notion is a politically incorrect \r\nand philosophically dubious concept. That fact draws \r\nits essence and legitimacy from the early history of \r\nMorocco and its multifaceted roots as well as from our \r\nunderstanding of Islam. Thus we reach out to others \r\nwhile remaining ourselves and in order to enrich our \r\nsociety we engage in a dynamic exchange with others. \r\nConflicts among societies often result from \r\nmisunderstandings of one another and out of ignorance \r\nand lack of respect for the moral and societal values of \r\nothers. \r\n Based upon our profound convictions, the \r\nKingdom of Morocco has firmly supported the \r\n A/61/PV.48\r\n \r\n7 06-60547 \r\n \r\ninitiative for the Alliance of Civilizations initiated by \r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan. Mr. André Azoulay, \r\nCounselor to His Majesty the King, participated in this \r\nexercise, and in that manner my country supports the \r\nimplementation of a project for a new world order \r\nbased on relations between the Western Christian world \r\nand the Arab Muslim world — a society whose \r\ndimensions are ideological, political, institutional and \r\ncultural. \r\n Throughout the past year, the world of the \r\ntwenty-first century has been characterized by \r\nunbridled globalization. It has seen inter-ethnic and \r\ncultural tensions generated by defamatory and \r\nprovocative actions in the name of the freedom of \r\nexpression. Morocco condemns and has condemned \r\nthose actions, based on the principle that the freedom \r\nof some cannot be exercised to the detriment of the \r\nsacred values of others. It is in that spirit that my \r\ncountry welcomes the efforts undertaken by UNESCO \r\nin that area, and supports the initiative to make \r\ndialogue an essential ingredient for bringing religions \r\nand civilizations closer together and in preventing \r\nconflicts. \r\n It goes without saying that the dissemination of \r\nknowledge will to a great extent extend from the \r\npromotion of economic development and from \r\nstrengthening human and institutional capacities. We \r\nare convinced that international cooperation and \r\ncultural exchanges among nations are important \r\nmechanisms for bringing peoples closer together. The \r\nsame is true for education in the area of human rights \r\nand the inclusion of marginalized communities.  \r\n The Kingdom of Morocco has continued in that \r\nvein and includes in its educational system and its \r\nschool programmes the promotion of human rights. It \r\nhas opened up its audiovisual media and actively \r\nparticipates in international efforts aimed at bridging \r\nthe digital divide. In addition, it has supported and \r\ncontributed to the initiative of His Excellency Mr. \r\nAbdoulaye Wade, President of Senegal, to create a fund \r\nto assist developing countries to catch up in the area of \r\ninformation and communication technology. My \r\ncountry also hosts a number of training courses in \r\nvarious areas for foreign professionals, in particular \r\nthose from sub-Saharan Africa.  \r\n Protecting cultural heritage and capacity-\r\nbuilding, as well as increasing the awareness of \r\ncultural values, are effective means for peoples and \r\nnations to preserve their identity and their traditions in \r\na national and international environment imbued with \r\npeace, tolerance and mutual respect. \r\n The international community must now do more \r\nin the area of education — to design curriculums, \r\nmanuals and activities that will advocate cultural and \r\nreligious tolerance, the peaceful settlements of \r\nconflicts and the promotion of human rights, bearing in \r\nmind the need to keep the citizen at the heart of those \r\ninterests. \r\n The international community is also invited to \r\nharmonize its efforts to make it possible for everyone \r\nto have access to information technology, which is now \r\nthe prime means for disseminating and distributing \r\nknowledge. Faced with the challenge of ever-\r\nincreasing ignorance of one another, the ever-\r\nnarrowing sense of identity and the ideological void \r\nthat we have, to our detriment, ignored for so long, we \r\nmust be more open and foster a mingling of ideas of \r\nhumanism and humanity, in the best tradition of our \r\nworld. \r\n We are called upon to carry out a tireless battle \r\nagainst ideological and moral degradation that \r\noccurred when the world was not watching and \r\nviolence took over the landscape of politics and \r\nreligion. My delegation is a sponsor of draft resolution \r\nA/61/L.11, as introduced by the Philippines and \r\nPakistan. It meets the concerns of a number of \r\ndelegations. My delegation therefore hopes that the \r\ndraft will be adopted by consensus.  \r\n My delegation will also continue to place great \r\nimportance on promoting a culture of peace and \r\nsupport any constructive and responsible initiative \r\nalong those lines. It will also consider with interest \r\ndraft resolution A/61/L.16, introduced this morning by \r\nthe representative of Bangladesh, entitled \r\n“International Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-\r\nViolence for the Children of the World, 2001-2010”. \r\n Mrs. Asmady (Indonesia): My delegation has \r\nalways attached great importance to the promotion of a \r\nculture of peace. That is one of the important \r\napproaches that we are pursuing in order to deal with \r\nthe persistent occurrence of prejudice, intolerance, \r\nmisperceptions and xenophobia, which generate hatred, \r\nviolence and disharmony within and among societies, \r\nas well as among peoples and nations throughout the \r\nworld. \r\nA/61/PV.48  \r\n \r\n06-60547 8 \r\n \r\n It is now widely recognized that the active \r\npromotion of a culture of peace and dialogue among \r\ncivilizations, leading to universal respect for our \r\ndiversity of beliefs, cultures and languages, is vital for \r\nthe achievement of sustainable peace. \r\n We thank the Director-General of UNESCO for \r\nhis informative report on various activities carried out \r\nby the organization in this field, as contained in \r\ndocument A/61/175. Of particular importance to my \r\ndelegation is UNESCO’s programme to promote a \r\nculture of peace through education. We believe that \r\nthat programme should be expanded in order to reach a \r\nwider target through the active involvement of various \r\nstakeholders, especially civil society. \r\n It is worth recalling that both the Millennium \r\nDeclaration and the 2005 United Nations World Summit \r\naffirmed shared values and principles such as freedom, \r\nequality, solidarity and tolerance as being essential to \r\ninternational relations in the twenty-first century. That \r\nis indeed a reaffirmation of the imperative of \r\npromoting a culture of peace to achieve sustainable \r\npeace at all levels in this increasingly globalized world. \r\n Mr. Chidyausiku (Zimbabwe), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair.  \r\n It should be born in mind that, despite the \r\nproliferation of intercultural, intercivilizational and \r\ninterfaith initiatives in recent times, the world is still \r\nbeset by violence, hatred, discrimination, ignorance \r\nand poverty. We really need to step up our endeavours \r\nto meet the challenges ahead of us. \r\n Our debate today is, in itself, a strong indication \r\nthat we must all be prepared to work together to \r\ndevelop better ways to promote tolerance and respect \r\nfor diversity and freedom of thought, conscience, \r\nreligion and belief. It is an opportunity to reflect more \r\ndeeply on the promotion of dialogue on those \r\nimportant and sensitive issues, including the need for \r\nbetter implementation of all relevant provisions of the \r\nexisting international instruments, as well as for \r\nexploration of further international measures to \r\nenhance the promotion of a culture of peace. \r\n As a heterogeneous country itself, Indonesia is a \r\nfirm believer in the merit of promoting dialogue among \r\ncivilizations, cultures and religions. Indonesia has been \r\ntaking specific steps in the fields of education, culture, \r\nmedia, religion and society to promote the shared \r\nvalues of peace, compassion and tolerance. \r\n We should support the role of the media in \r\nbridging gaps, developing better understanding among \r\nvarious religions, cultures and peoples, facilitating a \r\npolicy of dialogue among societies and assisting in the \r\ncreation of an environment conducive to the sharing of \r\nhuman experience, thereby contributing to the \r\nadvancement of the culture of peace. We believe that, \r\nwhile the media can be a force for good, they can also — \r\nas demonstrated by the cartoon controversy — do a great \r\ndeal of harm. \r\n In that connection, Indonesia, in collaboration \r\nwith Norway, held the first Global Inter-Media \r\nDialogue last September in Bali, which was attended \r\nby leading mass media practitioners from five \r\ncontinents. The objective of the Inter-Media Dialogue \r\nwas to increase the sensitivity of the mass media to \r\nother cultures and faiths without compromising \r\nfreedom of expression. \r\n Also of tremendous importance was the active \r\ninvolvement by informal community leaders in the \r\nSecond International Conference of Islamic Scholars, \r\nheld last June in Jakarta, which was attended by 300 \r\nscholars from more than 54 countries. The Conference \r\nproduced a programme of action entitled “To Promote \r\nIslam as a Religion of Moderation and Tolerance”. \r\nIndonesia also recently hosted the World Peace Forum, \r\nheld in Jakarta from 14 to 16 August 2006, aimed at \r\nbuilding dialogue and mutual cooperation among \r\ncivilizations and promoting better understanding of \r\nhuman values. Furthermore, Indonesia has been actively \r\npromoting interfaith and intercultural dialogue in the \r\nAsia-Pacific region and within the Asia-Europe Meeting. \r\nThat is our way of advancing the culture of peace \r\nwithin and among cultures, religions and civilizations. \r\n In today’s global multicultural environment, we \r\nshould encourage dialogue at all levels of society, using it \r\nas an effective tool for promoting harmony and tolerance \r\nin interpersonal as well as inter-State relationships. \r\nAcknowledgement of global multiculturalism should \r\nalso be reflected through respect for the sovereign \r\nintegrity of all nations and the continued commitment \r\nof developed countries to provide assistance to \r\ndeveloping countries.  \r\n Religion and culture are the core components of \r\ncivilization. That implies that the promotion of \r\ndialogue among nations and societies must be seen as \r\ncritical on the global agenda and as a factor \r\ncontributing to the cultivation of a culture of peace. \r\n A/61/PV.48\r\n \r\n9 06-60547 \r\n \r\n We still have a long way to go towards the \r\nachievement of a culture of peace throughout the world. \r\nWe should continue to explore various ways and means to \r\nadvance such a culture. In that regard, we support the \r\nidea of declaring one of the coming years as the Year of \r\nDialogue among Religions and Cultures, during which \r\nGovernments, the United Nations system and civil society \r\nwill be invited to undertake appropriate activities marking \r\nthat event. We also support the idea of establishing a \r\ndepartment within the Secretariat to deal with issues \r\nrelating to the promotion of a culture of peace. \r\n Mrs. Chabau Montalvo (Cuba) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): In 1945, through the Charter of the United \r\nNations, we designed a new system of international \r\nrelations to prevent a repetition of the terrible \r\nexperiences of the two world wars, to save succeeding \r\ngenerations from the scourge of war and to create a \r\ndemocratic and equitable international order based on \r\nrespect for the dignity of all human beings. \r\n Those were the objectives for which our \r\nOrganization was established to maintain international \r\npeace and security. We also decided that the United \r\nNations would base its actions on the principles of the \r\nsovereign equality of all its Members, the peaceful \r\nsettlement of international disputes, the non-use or \r\nthreat of use of force and non-intervention in the \r\ninternal affairs of States. We also agreed that all \r\npeoples would achieve economic and social progress. \r\n However, chaos continues to prevail in the world, \r\ndespite attempts to convince us that conditions and \r\nrules now exist that will guarantee peace, order, well-\r\nbeing and security, which our planet needs so much. \r\n A few countries that monopolize economic, \r\ntechnical and political power continue to uphold an \r\ninternational order that makes them ever richer and the \r\nmajority of the countries ever poorer, exploited and \r\ndependent. \r\n Six decades after the creation of the United Nations, \r\nthe current economic and social situation threatens the \r\nvery existence of humankind. Thus, today more than 1.1 \r\nbillion people — one sixth of the world’s population — \r\nsurvive on less than $1 a day and more than 2.7 billion \r\n— almost half of the Earth’s inhabitants — barely \r\nsurvive on less than $2; 500 million infants live in \r\nextreme poverty; 1 million children under the age of \r\nfive die annually from preventable diseases; more than \r\n100 million children cannot attend school; and 850 \r\nmillion people suffer hunger. \r\n Moreover, the survival of millions of persons and \r\nentire nations is threatened by the atmosphere of \r\ninternational insecurity caused by the aggressive \r\npolicies and plans of the only super-Power of this \r\nunipolar world. Likewise, it is alarming that powerful \r\ncountries seek to foment conflicts, appealing to \r\ninterventionist concepts that contravene the Charter \r\nand that only aggravate the root causes of armed \r\nconflict, from generalized poverty to the desire to \r\ncontrol strategic natural resources. \r\n Notwithstanding the existence of that adverse \r\nlandscape affecting the developing countries — and \r\nalthough the winds of reform are blowing in the United \r\nNations, there is no intention of radically reforming \r\nthis decadent institution so as to make it a body that \r\ntruly represents the interests of all peoples of the world \r\nand not just a select few — it is indispensable to foster \r\nan atmosphere of international peace. \r\n It is essential to uphold a culture of peace and \r\nnon-violence that promotes dialogue between \r\ncivilizations and the right of all peoples to self-\r\ndetermination and solidarity as a fundamental value, \r\npursuant to which the world’s problems should be \r\naddressed so that the responsibility to solve them may be \r\nshared and focused on helping those who need it most. \r\n It must be firmly maintained that sovereignty \r\ncannot be sacrificed to an exploitative and unjust order \r\nin which a hegemonic super-Power, supported by its \r\npower and strength, can claim to decide it all. The \r\nmain causes of the current conflicts are the poverty and \r\nunderdevelopment that prevail in the overwhelming \r\nmajority of countries, and the unequal distribution of \r\nthe world’s wealth and knowledge. \r\n The current underdevelopment and poverty are \r\nthe consequences of the conquest, colonization, \r\nenslavement and plundering of the territories of vast \r\nparts of the world by the former metropolises, the \r\nemergence of imperialism, and the bloody wars to \r\ndivvy up the world anew. Today, those perennial \r\nPowers have the moral obligation to indemnify our \r\ncountries for the damage that they inflicted on us over \r\ncenturies. \r\n None of that which exists in the economic and \r\npolitical order serves the interests of humanity. That \r\norder, which marginalizes and excludes 80 per cent of \r\nthe world’s population, cannot be sustained. We believe \r\nthat the main objective of the United Nations is to save \r\nthe world not only from war, but also from \r\nA/61/PV.48  \r\n \r\n06-60547 10 \r\n \r\nunderdevelopment, hunger, disease, poverty and the \r\ndestruction of natural resources that are essential to \r\nhuman existence. And we should do it soon, before it is \r\ntoo late. \r\n Cuba reiterates its adherence to multilateralism \r\nand multilaterally agreed solutions, pursuant to the \r\nUnited Nations Charter and international law, as the \r\nonly acceptable way to address international problems. \r\nOnly thus will there be peace and development for all. \r\n Our contribution to that undertaking is based on a \r\ncomprehensive international cooperation programme, \r\nwhich is selflessly implemented in the areas of sport, \r\nhealth and education by thousands of Cuban specialists \r\nand technicians who provide support services in many \r\ncountries. They do all that despite the tight economic, \r\ncommercial and financial blockade imposed on Cuba \r\nby the United States, against which most Members of \r\nthe United Nations will again declare themselves on \r\nWednesday, 8 November. \r\n The dream of achieving truly just and rational \r\nnorms that govern human destinies seems impossible to \r\nmany. We are convinced that the struggle for the \r\nimpossible should therefore be a goal that the \r\nOrganization sets for itself. We have to sow ideas, \r\neradicate selfishness and foster solidarity and genuine \r\ninternational cooperation. Once we do so, there will be \r\nno need for all the weapons created by this civilization. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on the \r\nObserver of the Holy See. \r\n Archbishop Migliore (Holy See): The \r\nmaintenance, defence and promotion of peace in the \r\nworld are at the summit of the functions and priorities \r\nof the United Nations. Through conviction and many \r\nyears’ experience, the Organization believes that peace \r\nis first and foremost a culture, prior to being a network \r\nof peaceful relations among nations, anchored in the \r\nsystem of rules and mechanisms of international law. \r\n Throughout the years of United Nations activity, \r\nthe Holy See has expressed confidence in this \r\ninstitution as a privileged forum in which nations can \r\nwork in concert for the promotion of peace, and has \r\noffered its own contribution in reading the signs of the \r\ntimes, deepening reflection, and above all rallying \r\nentire communities throughout the world to foster and \r\nmaintain a culture of peace. \r\n At the start of this year, Pope Benedict XVI \r\naddressed all women and men of goodwill with a \r\nmessage entitled “In Truth, Peace”. Reading the signs of \r\nour times — in which terrorism, nihilism and fanatical \r\nfundamentalism threaten peaceful coexistence — the \r\nPope underlined the inseparable bond between peace \r\nand truth. \r\n Peace implies a truth that is common to all \r\npeoples beyond cultural, philosophical and religious \r\ndiversities. It is the idea of the dignity of every human \r\nperson intimately linked to the transcendent. Thus \r\npeace will be reached once it is understood and put into \r\npractice as the realization of this shared truth, in \r\nmutual respect for cultural diversities. \r\n An extreme exaltation of differences clashes with \r\nthis fundamental truth. We need to regain the \r\nawareness that we share a common destiny that is \r\nultimately transcendent so as to maximize our \r\nhistorical and cultural differences, not in opposition to, \r\nbut in cooperation with, people belonging to other \r\ncultures. To this end, we need to affirm our common \r\ncommitment to promoting institutions and methods of \r\njoint action and cooperation between peoples and \r\nnations, and especially to fostering education for \r\npeace, at a level well above the necessary and hoped-\r\nfor structural reforms. \r\n In this context, my delegation would like to \r\nrenew its support for the ongoing International Decade \r\nfor a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the \r\nChildren of the World, 2001-2010. We all have a great \r\nresponsibility for the formation of future generations. \r\nThat is why the Pontifical Council for Inter-religious \r\nDialogue will convene a meeting in Assisi tomorrow \r\nfor young people from different countries and cultural \r\nand religious backgrounds, engaging them in a \r\npersonal commitment to dialogue, prayer and education \r\non tolerance and peace. \r\n The lack of the basic truth of peace at the cultural \r\nlevel has undoubtedly produced devastating effects \r\ndown through the years, and there are still cultures and \r\nmentalities that even today deny it exists. The most \r\ndramatic example of this is international terrorism. The \r\ncriminal designs of international terrorism rest on false \r\ncultural roots that deny the existence of a link between \r\ntruth and human life. Such roots are identifiable in \r\nnihilism and in fanatical fundamentalism, which are \r\nerroneous ways of relating to truth. The nihilist denies \r\nthe very existence of truth, while the fundamentalist \r\nclaims to be able to impose it by force. Despite their \r\ndifferent origins and cultural backgrounds, both show a \r\n A/61/PV.48\r\n \r\n11 06-60547 \r\n \r\ndangerous contempt for human beings and human life, \r\nand ultimately for God himself. \r\n The causes of lack of peace in our world cannot \r\nbe reduced to those of an exclusively social or political \r\nnature. Terrorism, war, genocide and national and \r\ninternational injustice that discriminate, oppress and \r\nabandon entire populations to hunger and helplessness, \r\nor hinder or threaten the right to existence of nations, \r\ncan also be explained by deeper motivations of a \r\ncultural, ideological, philosophical and even religious \r\nnature. Social behaviour and political choices usually \r\nfollow. At this level, it is essential to formulate both \r\nnational and international peace policies that will \r\nembrace the truth of peace and shun lies as a system \r\nfor relations or governance. \r\n With the 2005 Summit Outcome Document, this \r\nOrganization adopted the principle of the responsibility \r\nto protect as a practical translation of the exercise of \r\nsovereignty and of governance. The responsibility to \r\nprotect presupposes the capacity and the will to remove \r\nthreats, to establish relations and mechanisms apt to \r\ncontinue to dissuade humanity from resolving their \r\ndisputes through the use of force and, to the extent \r\npossible, to substitute law for force. \r\n The responsibility to protect is intimately linked \r\nwith and directly proportional to respect for the truth of \r\npeace, whether it is a question of deciding to use force \r\nin extreme cases, the conduct during and after conflict, \r\nmilitary expenditure, the arms trade, disarmament and \r\nnuclear proliferation, demographics or the approach to \r\ndevelopment. To realize peace at the social and \r\npolitical levels, the correct relation between truth and \r\npeace at the cultural level needs to be re-established. \r\n The Acting President: In accordance with \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 49/2 of 19 October 1994, \r\nI call upon the Observer for the International \r\nFederation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. \r\n Mr. Schulz (International Federation of Red \r\nCross and Red Crescent Societies): The International \r\nFederation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies \r\n(IFRC) is taking the floor under this item because of \r\nthe importance it attaches to a much stronger effort by \r\nGovernments, international organizations and civil \r\nsociety on this subject. \r\n We are now past the mid-point of the International \r\nDecade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the \r\nChildren of the World. The atmosphere that greeted the \r\nadoption of General Assembly resolution 52/15 in 1997 \r\nis by now probably a distant memory for many \r\norganizations and Governments, but the need for \r\nconcerted action has probably never been greater. \r\n This is a message we receive unequivocally from \r\nour worldwide membership of national Red Cross and \r\nRed Crescent Societies. It is a message they give to us \r\nas we prepare for the Thirtieth International \r\nConference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, which \r\nwill be held in Geneva in late November 2007. \r\n The IFRC’s member Societies are looking to us, \r\nas their representative in the international community, \r\nto bring information about what the major actors are \r\ndoing, not just what they are saying, to promote \r\ntolerance and respect for diversity. These are essential \r\nactions if the world is truly to combat discrimination \r\nand prejudice. They are essential actions in a world \r\nthat is witnessing a surge in community prejudice. \r\n There are many examples of our work and that of \r\nnational Societies. To give a few examples, the British \r\nRed Cross has worked with the Bangladesh Red \r\nCrescent to bridge gaps and bring support to people \r\nliving in vulnerability in the United Kingdom. Early \r\noutreach work has developed into other actions for first \r\naid and community health assistance. A programme of \r\nvolunteer recruitment has provided much-needed \r\nresources capable of making a difference for the \r\ncommunity. Similar work, concentrating on volunteer \r\nrecruitment, has also been reported by other Red Cross \r\nSocieties, including those of Denmark, Germany and \r\nSweden. In Iceland, the Government and the Icelandic \r\nRed Cross have joined forces in training Icelandic \r\nvolunteer peacebuilders in preparation for their peace \r\nmissions. \r\n I mention these actions not just for the record, but \r\nto emphasize our belief that action must take place \r\nwith the full involvement of the communities \r\nthemselves. This is essential in all countries, but it is of \r\nspecial importance in countries where migration has \r\nbrought together people of different cultures, \r\nethnicities, traditions and beliefs. The issue of \r\nmigration and integration has been a key subject in the \r\nwork of some of our partner international \r\norganizations, and we pay tribute to the International \r\nOrganization for Migration and the Office of the \r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for \r\nthe work they have done to broaden understanding of \r\nthe problems and the need for solutions. \r\nA/61/PV.48  \r\n \r\n06-60547 12 \r\n \r\n We know that the IFRC has a role to play as a \r\nnetwork bringing together all the world’s cultures \r\nunder one set of fundamental principles. In this \r\ncontext, we underline the important role of the Office \r\nof the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and we \r\nsee a range of opportunities in this field in the future, \r\nlinking our national Societies to national human rights \r\ninstitutions. \r\n We are working now with our bridging role — \r\nbridging Governments, intergovernmental organizations, \r\ncivil society and non-governmental organizations \r\n(NGOs) at high levels, and bridging communities and \r\nlocal authorities where grassroots contact is the key. \r\nWe use our membership of the “big six” — the six \r\nmain international youth organizations — to emphasize \r\nthe role of youth in finding and implementing \r\nsolutions, and we emphasize worldwide the need for \r\nyouth to work with the fundamental principles of the \r\nmovement to promote tolerance and respect for \r\ndiversity as they prepare to lead the countries of the \r\nworld in the future. \r\n Our support for the Secretary-General’s initiative, \r\nthe Alliance of Civilizations, was demonstrated \r\nthrough the participation of our Deputy Secretary-\r\nGeneral in the hearings organized by the High-level \r\nGroup for the Alliance of Civilizations in July 2006 in \r\nGeneva. At the hearings, he recalled the pledge \r\ndelivered by the IFRC in 2003 at the International \r\nConference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent. The \r\npledge contains the vow of the IFRC, which is \r\nimportant to this debate, in two respects: to develop \r\npublic dialogue and advocacy, promoting tolerance, \r\nnon-discrimination and respect for diversity at the \r\nnational and international level; and to develop \r\npartnerships, promote dialogue and support \r\nprogrammes in this area with Governments and \r\ninternational and national organizations working \r\ntowards the same goals, particularly in view of the \r\nimportance of the role played by young people in peer \r\nand non-formal education to promote international \r\nfriendship and understanding. \r\n We also spoke of the need to intensify community \r\nparticipation in such programme, highlighting, in \r\nparticular, the importance of an enabling volunteer \r\nenvironment through which such programmes can \r\nflourish at the community level and through which a \r\nreal impact can be made on the stigmatization and \r\nexclusion which so many marginalized people face in \r\nour times. \r\n Against this background, I give the Assembly our \r\ncommitment to maintain a high profile on these issues. \r\nWe will consult thoroughly and widely as we prepare \r\nfor the 2007 International Conference in Geneva, \r\nwhich will bring together the world’s Governments and \r\nour national society leaders. We look forward to a \r\nstrong and positive outcome from this debate, with \r\ncommitments from all to make this world a better place \r\nto live. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on this agenda item.  \r\n I would like to inform members that action on \r\ndraft resolution A/61/L.11 will be taken at a later date. \r\nThe Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 44.  \r\n \r\nAgenda item 49  \r\n \r\nSport for peace and development \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/61/373) \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/61/L.12) \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Tunisia to introduce the draft \r\nresolution A/61/L.12.  \r\n Mr. Hachani (Tunisia) (spoke in French): Allow \r\nme at the outset to congratulate the Secretary-General \r\non his report entitled “Sport for Development and \r\nPeace: the way forward” (A/61/373) and to tell him \r\nhow much my delegation appreciates the work done by \r\nMr. Adolf Ogi, former President of Switzerland, \r\nSpecial Adviser to the Secretary-General on Sport for \r\nDevelopment and Peace, as well as for his tireless \r\nefforts to ensure the success of programmes aimed at \r\npromoting sport worldwide. I also wish to thank his \r\nrepresentative, Mr. Djibril Diallo, Director of the New \r\nYork Office of Sport for Development and Peace, for \r\nhis commitment to the cause of sport and for his \r\nvaluable contribution in this area. \r\n I wish to reiterate the determination of Tunisia to \r\npursue its efforts to make sport, which is so necessary \r\nfor healthy body and mind, the link and common \r\ndenominator among Member States whose commitment \r\nto peace, the essential objective of our Organization, is \r\nwidely shared. I also wish to express our satisfaction at \r\nthe interest and enthusiasm generated during the \r\nInternational Year of Sport and Physical Education \r\n2005, which was celebrated by the holding of events \r\n A/61/PV.48\r\n \r\n13 06-60547 \r\n \r\nworldwide, thus underscoring the importance of sport \r\nfor the participants and their commitment to the \r\nuniversal character of this activity. \r\n In the framework of the Year, Tunisia organized \r\nthe International Conference on Sport and Health, \r\nwhich culminated in the Hammamet Declaration in \r\nwhich participant States reiterated the importance of \r\nsport and physical education for a lifestyle that is \r\nphysically and mentally healthy. Given the noble \r\ncharacter of sport and its vital contribution in the rise \r\nof future generations who seek out good physical and \r\nmental fitness, Tunisia welcomes the unanimous \r\nadoption at the thirty-third session of the UNESCO \r\nGeneral Conference of the International Convention \r\nagainst Doping in Sport, the first global instrument to \r\ncombat this dangerous scourge. Tunisia takes this \r\nopportunity to invite Member States to take all \r\nnecessary measures to address this danger which \r\nundermines both the health of athletes and the image \r\nand credibility of sporting events which honour \r\nmankind, such as the Olympic Games. \r\n In order to keep enthusiasm high and to make \r\nsport a means of promoting universal principles for \r\nfuture generations, I have the honour to introduce draft \r\nresolution A/61/L.12, entitled “Sport as a means to \r\npromote education, health, development and peace”, on \r\nbehalf of the sponsors whose names appear in that \r\ndocument. \r\n Since the publication of that document, the \r\nfollowing Member States have become sponsors: \r\nAfghanistan, Albania, Antigua and Barbuda, Armenia, \r\nAustralia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Belarus, \r\nBelize, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Cape Verde, \r\nthe Central African Republic, Comoros, Congo, Costa \r\nRica, Côte d’Ivoire, Croatia, Cuba, the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, Djibouti, the Dominican \r\nRepublic, Egypt, El Salvador, France, Guatemala, \r\nIsrael, Japan, Kazakhstan, Luxembourg, Madagascar, \r\nMalaysia, Mali, Malta, Moldova, Mongolia, \r\nMontenegro, Oman, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, \r\nSaint Lucia, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Slovenia, South \r\nAfrica, Spain, the Sudan, Suriname, the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Togo, Trinidad and \r\nTobago, Ukraine, the United Kingdom of Great Britain \r\nand Northern Ireland, Uzbekistan, Viet Nam and \r\nZambia. \r\n This draft resolution is the fruit of broad \r\nconsultations, both with a great number of Member \r\nStates as well as with United Nations institutions. I \r\nwish to thank them sincerely for their interest in this \r\ntext and for the active role they played in the success \r\nof the International Year of Sport and Physical \r\nEducation. The draft resolution encourages all \r\nparticipants in the field of sport to set up awareness \r\nprogrammes for peace worldwide by organizing \r\nsporting events and by mainstreaming sport in their \r\ndevelopment programmes, drawing on the Action Plan \r\ncontained in the report of the Secretary-General.  \r\n The draft resolution also invites Member States to \r\nset up sport programmes to further promote the \r\ninternational community’s interest in important \r\nsubjects such as gender equality and the empowerment \r\nof women. It also takes note with appreciation of the \r\norganization by the United Nations on 29-31 October \r\n2006 of the first Global Youth Leadership Summit, \r\nwhich highlighted the importance of sport in the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). \r\n Solidarity among peoples at the beginning of the \r\ntwenty-first century is not only a choice but a necessity \r\nwhich we are convinced can be solidified through \r\nsport. For this reason, the delegation of my country as \r\nwell as the delegations of other sponsoring countries \r\nhope that this draft resolution will be supported by all \r\nMember States; this will send a strong message to all \r\nthose men and women who promote the noble practice \r\nof sport and will constitute a major encouragement for \r\nathletes. \r\n Ms. Alzaabi (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in \r\nArabic): On behalf of the delegation of the United Arab \r\nEmirates, it gives me great pleasure to begin my \r\nstatement by thanking the Secretary-General for his \r\nrecent report and for the valuable information \r\ncontained therein, with which we expect to enrich our \r\ndeliberations on this item. \r\n The observance of the Olympic Truce, which was \r\nstarted by the General Assembly in the last decade, and \r\nthe unanimity of heads of State and Government at the \r\nsixtieth session of the General Assembly on the \r\nimportance of developing sport for peace and \r\ndevelopment, reflect the determination of the \r\ninternational community to harness that type of human \r\nactivity to achieving the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. Events have demonstrated that the interest of \r\nGovernments and civil societies in developing sport \r\nand physical education can significantly contribute to \r\nA/61/PV.48  \r\n \r\n06-60547 14 \r\n \r\nstrengthening their national development programmes, \r\nparticularly in the areas of improving public health \r\namong citizens, bringing local communities together, \r\npromoting respect for law among individuals, \r\nmaintaining the safety of public facilities and \r\nenvironment, and enhancing coherence and diversity \r\namong individuals and communities. At the global \r\nlevel, international athletic events have contributed to \r\nstrengthening international respect for the traditions \r\nand cultures of peoples and brought them closer \r\ntogether by enhancing the spirit of cooperation, \r\ntolerance, harmony and love among them. \r\n The United Arab Emirates welcomes the efforts \r\nof the United Nations to ensure the success of the \r\nInternational Year for Sport and Physical Education \r\n2005 and its other initiatives for cooperation and \r\npartnership with the International Olympic Committee \r\nand other organizations, including the establishment of \r\ninstitutional arrangements and funds and the \r\norganization of conferences and national seminars, as \r\nreferred to in the recent report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. All such activities seek to improve the quality \r\nof sporting events, to create an environment conducive \r\nto the achievement of various development plans, and \r\nto improve the quality of educational, cultural and \r\nhealth-related services for all.  \r\n The United Arab Emirates stresses the importance \r\nof expanding such initiatives to include in particular \r\nthe extension of financial, economic and moral \r\nassistance to developing countries, especially the \r\nsmallest and poorest, that are affected by wars and \r\nconflicts in order to enable them to meet their local \r\nneeds, eliminate hotspots of poverty, violence and \r\ndissension in their societies, rebuild the infrastructure \r\nof their sport institutions, and promote sport among \r\ntheir youth, who will thus be able to share their athletic \r\nexperiences and actively participate in regional and \r\nOlympic games.  \r\n In that context, we also stress the importance of \r\nreaching an international consensus on a code of good \r\npractice for sport and for developing strategic \r\npartnership programmes for all stakeholders and sport-\r\nrelated organizations, including sport associations and \r\nthe private sector. That will contribute to disseminating \r\nethics of human conduct and the principles of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter and to supporting joint efforts \r\nto enhance the social integration of vulnerable groups, \r\nincluding persons with disabilities and the elderly. \r\nMoreover, partnership programmes will also help to \r\nsupport natural disaster response programmes and to \r\ncombat violence, terrorism, crime, deviance, the illicit \r\ntrade in drugs and many other vices. \r\n Convinced that young people are its true national \r\nwealth, the Government of the United Arab Emirates \r\nhas given special attention to the sport sector and its \r\nyoung men and women by incorporating physical \r\neducation into the primary educational system. It has \r\nalso supported the student scout movement with a view \r\nto developing the mental, physical and moral skills of \r\nstudents and instilling in them the values and principles \r\nnecessary for improving their integration into local \r\ncommunities and their participation in environmental \r\nprotection and awareness programmes, especially those \r\nrelated to humanitarian, social and health-related \r\nactivities and local and national development. \r\n Given its determination to sharpen and develop \r\nthe skills and capacities of its young people throughout \r\ntheir years of primary education in order to enable \r\nthem to effectively participate in national development \r\nplans at all levels, the Government of the United Arab \r\nEmirates has sought to institutionalize the sport sector. \r\nIt has allocated substantial budgetary resources to \r\nfinancing sport development activities and youth \r\nprogrammes and incorporated them into its national \r\nsocial, environmental and health development \r\nprogrammes. It has also established various \r\nassociations for sponsoring sport activities, including \r\nthe General Authority for Youth and Sport, the Sport \r\nFederations Council and the National Olympic \r\nCommittee, which all participate in developing and \r\nimplementing a strategy to promote and sponsor \r\nnational sport activities and to develop training, \r\nrefereeing and fair competition among athletes.  \r\n The strategy also aims at supporting national \r\nclubs and unions and their teams. It has increased the \r\nnumber of sport clubs established in accordance with \r\nthe latest international standards and regulations. These \r\nhave contributed significantly in the past two decades \r\nto promoting sport among young people of both sexes, \r\nespecially those with special needs, and enhanced their \r\nactive participation in many of the national, regional \r\nand international competitive sports, including the \r\nOlympic Games. This has resulted in some of our \r\nnational clubs and athletes winning distinguished \r\nmedals and championships. In the interest of \r\nsafeguarding the health of its athletes, the United Arab \r\nEmirates has also signed the Copenhagen Declaration \r\non Anti-Doping in Sport. \r\n A/61/PV.48\r\n \r\n15 06-60547 \r\n \r\n The United Arab Emirates, which believes that \r\nthe Olympic Truce can be an effective tool for ending \r\nwars and conflicts, urges the United Nations and \r\nrelevant regional organizations to step up their joint \r\nefforts to revive that tradition and to utilize sport \r\nactivities and competitions organized during conflicts \r\nto stabilize ceasefires, and to encourage belligerents to \r\nconsider other ways of addressing their conflicts and to \r\nuse dialogue and peaceful means for resolving their \r\nconflicts instead of resorting to war and destruction.  \r\n In that context, we also affirm the importance of \r\nenhancing other international initiatives aimed at \r\npromoting the concept of sport for all and at \r\nincorporating its noble values into educational and \r\ndevelopment strategies and programmes in order to \r\nenhance interaction and dialogue among different \r\ncultures and civilizations, promote mutual interests \r\namong peoples, and advance peacebuilding efforts. We \r\nalso look forward to reaching international consensus \r\non an anti-doping convention to prevent the abuse of \r\ndrugs in all sport activities and to develop sport for \r\nyoung people in a healthy and sound environment that \r\npromotes their involvement in achieving the goals of \r\nsecurity, peace and development in their communities. \r\n Mr. Maurer (Switzerland): My delegation has \r\ntaken note with great satisfaction of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report entitled “Sport for development and \r\npeace: the way forward”, which he has submitted to the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-first session. We are also \r\npleased that we are debating the report together with \r\ndraft resolution A/61/L.12, entitled “Sport as a means \r\nto promote education, health, development and peace”. \r\n We are particularly pleased today with the \r\noutstanding publication on the International Year of \r\nSport and Physical Education 2005, which has just \r\nbeen released, and which I can show to members in its \r\nbeautiful United Nations blue cover. I am fully aware \r\nhow sensitive an issue it is these days to promote a \r\nbook from this rostrum. This book may not have the \r\nphilosophical depth of a work by Noam Chomsky, but \r\nit is an impressive testimony to the great number and \r\nvariety of initiatives, activities and networks aimed at \r\nmaking a difference through sport and play. It \r\nillustrates the efforts of the United Nations system, \r\nGovernments, sport organizations and development \r\nagencies, as well as the private sector, to harness the \r\ngreat positive potential of sport and physical education \r\nto specifically and systematically promote \r\ndevelopment, education, peace and health. \r\n None of that would not have been possible \r\nwithout the outstanding commitment of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral himself and of his Special Adviser on Sport for \r\nDevelopment and Peace and his teams in Geneva and \r\nNew York. Switzerland congratulates them and thanks \r\nthem for their untiring efforts. \r\n Recalling our main contribution to the \r\nInternational Year of Sport and Physical Education \r\n2005, we should like to highlight once again the \r\nimportance of the second Magglingen Conference on \r\nSport and Development, convened in December 2005 \r\nat the initiative of the Special Adviser. The Conference \r\nmarked the culmination and conclusion of the \r\nInternational Year of Sport and Physical Education \r\n2005. It brought together more than 400 participants \r\nfrom 70 countries and all sectors of society. \r\n The Conference represented a milestone on the \r\npath towards a worldwide partnership of sport and \r\ndevelopment. Its outcome document, the Magglingen \r\nCall to Action, was adopted unanimously by all \r\nparticipants. It is an action-oriented document targeted to \r\neveryone: sports organizations, athletes, Governments, \r\ndevelopment agencies, the private sector, the media, \r\nresearch institutions and armed forces. It calls upon all \r\nof them to use and promote sport for development and \r\npeace in their respective fields. For example, it calls upon \r\nmultilateral organizations and the United Nations system \r\nto take a lead role in policy dialogue at the strategic and \r\nglobal levels, to raise the awareness of international \r\nactors and other partners, to strengthen networks and \r\nenhance coordination, and to promote the implementation \r\nand evaluation of projects and programmes. \r\n Both the publication of the Special Adviser and \r\nthe Magglingen Conference and its outcome show \r\nclearly that a solid foundation has been laid over the \r\npast few years, in particular 2005. \r\n Today, it is up to all stakeholders not only to \r\nagree to a common vision, common aims and common \r\nareas for action for the future, but also, and even more \r\nimportant, to maintain the momentum for the further \r\nimplementation of sport as an instrument to contribute \r\nto the attainment of development objectives, in \r\nparticular the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). In that regard, the main challenges ahead are \r\ntaken up in the draft resolution before us today, which \r\nwe fully support. \r\n The time is ripe to continue investing in \r\nimplementation. That means that agencies, funds and \r\nA/61/PV.48  \r\n \r\n06-60547 16 \r\n \r\nprogrammes are called upon to systematically integrate \r\nand mainstream sport as an instrument in their own \r\noperational work — to translate the conceptual basis \r\ninto action. While we understand the concern to \r\nincrease the focus and prioritize the work of funds and \r\nprogrammes, we are deeply convinced that sport is not \r\na distraction from that focus, but a formidable vehicle \r\nfor achieving the MDGs. \r\n The momentum so far, as well as the needs and \r\nchallenges ahead, strengthen our conviction that it is \r\ntime to significantly step up our efforts and activities. \r\nFurther efforts are needed to enable the enormous \r\npotential of sport for development and peace to become \r\na lasting reality. \r\n We appeal to the United Nations family to join \r\nforces in order to establish a coherent and effective \r\nmechanism in that regard. The Special Adviser’s role \r\nof providing guidance on the institutional future of \r\nsport for development and peace within the United \r\nNations system is instrumental. \r\n Today’s debate is about sport for development \r\nand peace. Switzerland, however, is convinced that it is \r\nabout much more. In our view, it is about the profile of \r\nthe United Nations. Our engagement within the \r\nOrganization is focused on intensifying its outreach, \r\nwhether to civil society, to the private sector, to the \r\nscientific community or to the world of sport. The future \r\nof the United Nations lies in its partnerships with civil \r\nsociety at large. In that regard, sport is an ideal vehicle \r\nfor bringing outreach and partnerships to life. \r\n The draft resolution on the agenda of today’s \r\ndebate embodies that spirit. Switzerland fully supports \r\nits adoption. \r\n Mr. Al-Henzab (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): It \r\ngives me great pleasure to address the members of the \r\nGeneral Assembly on this important item. I should also \r\nlike to commend the United Nations Office of Sport for \r\nDevelopment and Peace for promoting the concept of \r\nsport for development and peace throughout the world. \r\n Increasingly, the topic of sport for development \r\nand peace is being accorded recognition and \r\nimportance at the global level. The observance of the \r\nInternational Year of Sport and Physical Education \r\n2005 reflected international recognition of the organic \r\nrelationship between sport and peace and development, \r\na relationship that was highlighted in the 2005 World \r\nSummit Outcome Document (resolution 60/1).  \r\n The State of Qatar subscribes to the notion that \r\nhuman beings are at the core of development. We \r\nattach great importance to the promotion of social \r\njustice and the safeguarding of values and practices \r\nthat ensure social cohesion. We seek to create a \r\nfavourable environment for women, girls, young \r\npeople and other social groups not only by providing \r\nprimary education and basic health care to all citizens, \r\nbut also by basing our development agenda on the \r\ndevelopment of human resources and respect for \r\nhuman rights.  \r\n From the outset, the State of Qatar has supported \r\nUnited Nations activities to promote sport for \r\ndevelopment and peace. At the national level, we have \r\ntaken concrete steps to develop and implement \r\nsustainable sport and physical education programmes \r\nand policies. The advocacy, care and vision of His \r\nHighness Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, Emir of \r\nthe State of Qatar, and Her Highness Sheikha Mozah \r\nNasser Abdullah Al Misnad, Consort of the Emir, have \r\nresulted in a host of successful initiatives to enhance \r\nunderstanding among countries and societies. \r\n Indeed, the leaders of the State of Qatar regard \r\nsport as a direct, rewarding and important investment \r\nin Qatari children and young people that enables them \r\nto increase their productivity and enhance their sense \r\nof single community and common vision. The State of \r\nQatar has launched a variety of initiatives such as the \r\npromotion of women’s sport and the enhancement of \r\nphysical education departments within our national \r\neducational system. \r\n At the global level, the State of Qatar, although \r\nsmall in size, has made great strides in playing a \r\npivotal role in the promotion of international peace and \r\ncooperation. An important example is our hosting of \r\nthe fifteenth Asian Games at Doha, Qatar, in December \r\n2006, which will help to bridge cultural divides, unite \r\ncommunities and help build leadership capacities and \r\nvalues within the sport world in the Asia-Pacific \r\nregion.  \r\n The State of Qatar views sport and physical \r\neducation as a catalyst for development and recognizes \r\ntheir multifaceted benefits, in particular for socio-\r\neconomic development, for inculcating human values \r\nin the hearts and minds of citizens, and for promoting \r\npeace, international understanding and tolerance. \r\n The role of sport in peace and development is a \r\npriority for all nations. Sport is a vehicle that \r\n A/61/PV.48\r\n \r\n17 06-60547 \r\n \r\ntranscends differences and that teaches skills and \r\nvalues for a lifetime. It helps develop a sense of \r\ncommunity and common purpose. Sport promotes \r\nintegration, teamwork and tolerance. It strengthens \r\nbonds of friendship among young people. The peace \r\nwe seek throughout every region of the world is not \r\nsimply the absence of armed conflict or hostility; it is a \r\nweb of unity among nations woven from the strands of \r\ninterdependence, cooperation and creative thought. \r\nSport is, in large measure, a vehicle for peacebuilding, \r\nfostering social cohesion and the unity of mankind. \r\n The international community needs to harness the \r\npower of sport for peace and development. Greater \r\nattention should be given to the following issues. First, \r\nsport and physical education should evolve from a \r\nmarginal sector to a priority development sector and \r\nshould be viewed as a catalyst for socio-economic \r\ndevelopment. Secondly, sport must be viewed as a human \r\nright that overcomes barriers of race, religion, gender, \r\ndisability and social background. Thirdly, sport should be \r\nbetter integrated into government development polices \r\nand United Nations development programmes. \r\nFourthly, more thought must be given to using sport as \r\na means to promote intercultural dialogue, in particular \r\nduring post-conflict and peacebuilding phases. Fifthly, \r\nthere is a need for partnership between national \r\nOlympic committees and the United Nations system to \r\nimprove the allocation of resources and to optimize \r\ntheir use. Were we to implement those and other \r\nmeasures, we would succeed in making sport an \r\nessential component of development. \r\n I would like finally to thank the friendly \r\ndelegation of Tunisia for introducing draft resolution \r\nA/61/L.12, which the State of Qatar fully supports. \r\n Mr. Sayeed (India): We thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report entitled “Sport for Development \r\nand Peace: the way forward” (A/61/373). We note that \r\nthe report reviews the achievements of the \r\nInternational Year of Sport and Physical Education \r\n2005, including the broad range of activities and \r\ninitiatives carried out worldwide by Member States, the \r\nUnited Nations system and other stakeholders for \r\ncontinuing the momentum generated by the \r\nInternational Year. \r\n Activities relating to sports and physical \r\neducation are necessary components of human resource \r\ndevelopment. They have a positive impact on the \r\noverall personality of youth through the promotion of \r\ngood health, comradeship and a spirit of friendly \r\ncompetition. Apart from providing beneficial \r\nrecreation, sports also improve productivity and foster \r\nsocial harmony and discipline. \r\n India believes in the key role of sports in national \r\nlife. Given the importance of sports and games, the \r\nGovernment of India has taken several initiatives to \r\nimprove the standard of sports in the country. In the \r\nmodern world, the complexion of sports has undergone \r\na transformation due to the use of modern equipment \r\nand the introduction of modern infrastructure and \r\nhighly sophisticated equipment. The high degree of \r\ncompetitiveness in international sports has led to the \r\nnurturing of talent from a tender age and to greater \r\nemphasis on hard physical training along scientific \r\nlines. \r\n Despite resource constraints, India has been \r\nmaking efforts for broad-basing sports and for the \r\nprovision of modern sports infrastructure. The \r\nGovernment has focused its attention on the need for \r\nupgrading the skills of the coaching fraternity and for \r\nthe provision of adequate sports-science backup. The \r\nGovernment has encouraged the national sports \r\nfederations to function more efficiently and is also \r\nencouraging the active involvement of business and \r\nindustry in the promotion of sports. The Government of \r\nIndia formulated a new national sports policy in 2001, \r\nkeeping those objectives in view. \r\n India has a long tradition of sports and physical \r\nfitness. In keeping with that tradition, the Government \r\nof India has instituted several sports awards to \r\nencourage achievements by sportspersons. The \r\nGovernment is also encouraging international \r\ncooperation in the field of sports and physical \r\neducation and has been providing financial assistance \r\nto recognized national sports federations. \r\n The Sports Authority of India was established by \r\nthe Government in 1984 to achieve the twin objectives \r\nof the broad-basing of sport and nurturing talent in \r\nchildren of various age groups by providing them with \r\nthe necessary infrastructure, equipment, coaching and \r\nother facilities. The Sports Authority is implementing a \r\nnumber of sports promotion schemes. Under one of its \r\nschemes, it established a sports medicine centre, which \r\nis operational full-time. The Sports Authority also \r\nmaintains a dope control centre. \r\n The Government of India has been promoting \r\nsports through several schemes that provide incentives \r\nA/61/PV.48  \r\n \r\n06-60547 18 \r\n \r\nto encourage sports activities. The Sports Fund for \r\nPensions for Meritorious Sportspersons was launched \r\nin 1994 and is providing pensions to about 375 \r\nsportspersons. A scheme for the promotion of sports \r\nand games in schools was introduced in 1986 to raise \r\nthe standard of sports at the school level and to \r\nencourage participation in inter-school competitions. \r\n To broad-base games and sports in rural areas, the \r\nGovernment launched the Rural Sports Programme in \r\n1970-71. Under that scheme, tournaments are also \r\norganized for indigenous sports that are popular in \r\ndifferent parts of the country. The Sports Scholarship \r\nScheme was launched in 1970-71 to assist talented \r\nboys and girls in receiving a nutritious diet, sports \r\nequipment and other support and to pursue sports as a \r\ncareer option. The National Welfare Fund for \r\nSportspersons was set up in 1982 to assist outstanding \r\nretired sportspersons. Under this scheme, pension and \r\ngrants are provided to eminent sportspersons as well as \r\ntheir families. A National Sports Development Fund \r\nhas been instituted to mobilize resources for \r\nGovernment and non-governmental sources, including \r\nthe private and corporate sectors. \r\n We have taken note of the various activities \r\norganized by the United Nations system to help build \r\non the momentum of the International Year. We \r\nencourage the United Nations system to undertake \r\nactivities for sport for development and peace and to \r\ndevelop indicators and benchmarks for evaluating and \r\nmonitoring those activities. We agree with the \r\nSecretary-General that it is national Governments that \r\nare responsible for the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals.  \r\n We have taken note of the Secretary-General’s \r\nsuggestions to Member States for maximizing the \r\npositive impact of sports and realizing the full potential \r\nof that powerful tool. India recognizes the positive \r\nvalue of sport as an instrument that can bring people \r\ntogether in a neutral and apolitical setting. In our \r\nneighbourhood, the game of cricket has sometimes \r\nserved as an instrument of diplomacy, adding a new \r\nphrase to our lexicon, namely, cricket diplomacy. \r\n India believes that sports activity is integral to the \r\nall-around development of the human personality. We \r\nhave, therefore, remained engaged with the efforts of \r\nthe Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Sport \r\nfor Development and Peace, including his efforts to \r\norganize the United Nations Global Youth Leadership \r\nSummit. We are convinced that the engagement of \r\nyouth will help energize the efforts of countries to \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals. We \r\nsupport efforts by the United Nations system to \r\ngenerate awareness among the youth through such \r\ninitiatives. \r\n Mr. Salih (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I would like to express our appreciation to the \r\nPresident and to the Bureau, for their approach to \r\nguiding the work of the General Assembly. My \r\ndelegation thanks the Secretary-General and the Sport \r\nfor Development and Peace International Working \r\nGroup for their valuable efforts.  \r\n My delegation sponsored last year’s General \r\nAssembly resolution 60/9, on the International Year of \r\nSport and Physical Education 2005. This year, my \r\ndelegation will also join in sponsoring draft resolution \r\nA/61/L.12, on sport as a means to promote education, \r\nhealth, development and peace. My delegation also \r\nwelcomes the Global Youth Leadership Summit \r\norganized by the United Nations in October 2006. \r\n Because my Government understands the vital \r\nimportance of sport and youth and the increasing role \r\nof this sector in capacity-building, development and \r\npromoting a culture of peace, we have established a \r\nnew ministry for sport, youth and culture within the \r\nGovernment of National Unity, which establishes and \r\nsupervises strategies and policies concerning those \r\nissues, and links them to legislation. That legislation is \r\nintegrated with sport and youth institutions whose \r\nmembers are democratically elected through national \r\nand local sports unions and clubs and our national \r\nOlympic committee. \r\n In its efforts to strengthen the important sport \r\nsector, my country has expanded its range of \r\npossibilities both horizontally and vertically by \r\nestablishing physical education and sport programmes \r\nin institutes and universities, in order to graduate \r\nstudents qualified in many aspects of sport, who will \r\nthen work in secondary schools, clubs and youth \r\ncentres in villages, communities and towns. There is no \r\ndoubt that that will be a positive development for \r\nsports projects; it will train qualified sport \r\nprofessionals. \r\n In February 1957, at Khartoum, my country was \r\nhonoured to contribute to the establishment of the \r\nConfederation of African Football (CAF), along with \r\nEgypt and Ethiopia. CAF is one of several African \r\n A/61/PV.48\r\n \r\n19 06-60547 \r\n \r\nentities that was established even before the \r\nOrganization of African Unity in 1963. In February \r\n2007, we will commemorate the golden anniversary of \r\nthe establishment of CAF. The celebration will be held \r\nin the capital of my country, underscoring my country’s \r\nsupport for the sport and cultural aspects of CAF. \r\nHistory will recognize the Confederation as having led \r\nthe first regional and international effort to isolate and \r\npunish the apartheid regime of South Africa: South \r\nAfrica was prohibited from attending on participating \r\nin the first African Cup of Nations, held in Khartoum \r\nin 1957. \r\n My country has hosted regional sports \r\ncompetitions for countries of East and Central Africa \r\non many occasions, because we believe in the \r\nimportance of interaction among young people of the \r\ncontinent for increased communication and peace for \r\nall. Through our Olympic committee and our national \r\nsports associations, sport has played an important role \r\nin raising our awareness and in promoting development \r\nprojects in the areas of education, health, awareness of \r\nthe danger of pandemics such as HIV/AIDS, polio \r\nvaccination campaigns, the fight against malaria, \r\nawareness of the dangers of drugs and the use of \r\nsteroids and stimulants, and environmental protection \r\nprogrammes.  \r\n Some of my country’s most famous athletes \r\nparticipate in charitable causes. They include the \r\nrunner Omar Khalifa, who is known worldwide for \r\nactivities such as travelling from continent to continent \r\nfor Sport Aid to help the victims of famine, \r\ndesertification and drought in Africa; the swimmers \r\nSultan Kayyah and Sariya Gadalla; and the football \r\nstars Haytham Mustafa and Faisal al-Ajam of the Al-\r\nHilal and Al-Mirrikh clubs have participated in charity \r\nand social programmes, particularly for the children of \r\nmy country and for the population and the children of \r\nPalestine, through playing for the Arab team which \r\nplayed a number of games two years ago, and serving \r\nas goodwill ambassadors for SOS Children’s Villages. \r\nAll of that has had a good impact. The national \r\nSudanese teams and clubs have had the honour of \r\nstrengthening relations with other Arab and African \r\ncountries through formal and friendly competitions. \r\n The signing of the Comprehensive Peace \r\nAgreement and the Darfur Peace Agreement has \r\ndoubled the responsibility of sport in its role in \r\npromoting development, peace and unity in the Sudan \r\nthrough strengthening those concepts and linking them \r\nwith the reality of life among young people, children \r\nand women. Sports clubs in the Sudan, in particular the \r\nAl-Hilal and the Al-Mirrikh clubs, form a melting pot \r\nof unity among the provinces of the Sudan. We are a \r\ncountry of diverse religions, creeds, cultures and \r\nethnicities, and sport is a pot in which all of the \r\ncomponents of Sudanese society are mixed and unified. \r\nSport makes an important contribution to providing \r\nsupport and assistance for areas of conflict in the \r\nsouth, in Darfur and in the camps for refugees and \r\ndisplaced persons. Sport has also helped to bolster \r\neducation and health projects. \r\n Given the importance of sport for peace and \r\ndevelopment, my country hopes for unified support \r\nfrom the international community. The Sudan looks \r\nforward to the cooperation of Member States, the \r\nUnited Nations and sport-related organizations, in \r\nworking in coordination with my country to mobilize \r\nefforts in the area of sports and youth through the \r\nprovision of financial, technical and logistical \r\nresources for capacity-building and for preparing \r\nqualified people as administrators in our Olympic \r\ncommittee and in national clubs and teams. We need \r\nassistance in training coaches and referees and in \r\nsponsoring talented athletes in all sports, as well as \r\nequipment and infrastructure such as playing fields and \r\ncentres for youth and students in schools and \r\nuniversities. We must improve efficiency and increase \r\nthe job placement of physical education graduates in \r\norder to build a solid base for young people and for \r\ngenerations to come. \r\n In particular, we would like to note the \r\nimportance of providing the necessary support for \r\ncapacity-building programmes for sports specialists \r\nand journalists, as they are an important sector in the \r\nsports social and cultural system. This could be done \r\nthrough their elected association for sportswriters. \r\nSome prominent initiatives of many sports journals in \r\nthe Sudan are undertaken in the area of supporting poor \r\nfamilies, dealing with incurable diseases and \r\nsponsoring orphans. In addition, they play an \r\nimportant, responsible and pioneering role in \r\ndisseminating good values, good conduct and serving \r\nhigher interests, spreading the culture of peace and \r\ncombating bad habits. All of this will have a positive \r\nimpact in promoting the role of sports as a means of \r\nenhancing and spreading the values of peace and \r\ndevelopment and highlighting the values of right, \r\ngoodness and tolerance in a country emerging from \r\nA/61/PV.48  \r\n \r\n06-60547 20 \r\n \r\nconflict and war into an oasis of understanding, love \r\nand advancement through sports. \r\n The delegation of Sudan would like to submit a \r\nproposal to the General Assembly through which the \r\nUnited Nations could sponsor a sports initiative in \r\ncooperation with FIFA, the International Olympic \r\nCommittee and the African Union for Soccer in order \r\nto rebuild and rehabilitate the infrastructures of \r\ncountries emerging from conflict and war, in Africa in \r\ngeneral and in my country in particular. \r\n Mr. Chabar (Morocco) (spoke in French): My \r\ndelegation wishes to thank Secretary-General Kofi \r\nAnnan for his report entitled “Sports for Development \r\nand Peace: the way forward” (A/61/373). We welcome \r\nthe relevant information contained in that report, in \r\nparticular the Action Plan, which provides a road map \r\nfor the next three years to strengthen partnerships \r\nthrough sports as a means of promoting programmes \r\nfor development and peace. \r\n It is important to highlight the fact that sports and \r\nphysical education are important means for promoting \r\ntolerance and a culture of peace and for bringing \r\npeoples closer together. The Kingdom of Morocco \r\ntherefore supports the activities of the United Nations \r\nOffices of Sport for Development and Peace in Geneva \r\nand in New York and invites Member States to make \r\nnecessary resources available to those offices so that \r\nthey can carry out their mandates appropriately. \r\n For several years now, the Kingdom of Morocco \r\nhas included sport in its educational and school \r\nsystems and has used this discipline as a means of \r\ncombating poverty and exclusion. It played an active \r\npart in the holding of the International Year for Sport \r\nand Physical Education 2005 and set up a national \r\ncoordination centre for this purpose. The active \r\ninvolvement of the Kingdom of Morocco in this area \r\nstems from its profound conviction that sport has \r\nbecome a powerful partner for development, because \r\nof the important role it can play in the achievement of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals and because it is a \r\nfactor for bringing about an era of lasting peace. \r\nMorocco has decreed sport for all as one of its national \r\npriorities. \r\n My delegation therefore believes that we must \r\nkeep up the pace set by the International Year and the \r\nAction Plan and encourage the United Nations and \r\nother partners to move on from awareness activities to \r\nthe implementation of a number of activities on a \r\nbroader scale. This can be achieved by strengthening \r\ncooperation and coordination among Member States to \r\npromote a common understanding of the role of sport \r\nin the service of development and peace. \r\n We must also set up an information network and \r\ndefine priorities to promote sports as a model and draft \r\nsports policies to ensure everyone’s participation. It is \r\nimportant to increase sporting activities and to integrate \r\nthem in physical education, as well as in public health \r\npolicies and other relevant policies. My delegation \r\nsupports the activities of the Special Adviser to the \r\nSecretary-General on Sport for Development and Peace \r\nand hopes that his mandate will be maintained. \r\n The Kingdom of Morocco is a sponsor of draft \r\nresolution A/61/L.12 and hopes to see it adopted by \r\nconsensus. \r\n Mr. Liu Zhenmin (China) (spoke in Chinese): \r\nThe Chinese delegation wishes to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the report (A/61/373) submitted under this \r\nagenda item. The report reviews the achievements of \r\nthe International Year of Sport and Physical Education \r\n2005, puts forward the United Nations Action Plan on \r\nsport for development and peace and pointed the way \r\nforward for the future efforts of the United Nations and \r\nits Member States in the field of sports. \r\n The Chinese delegation appreciates the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s proposal in the report to integrate sport into \r\nthe development agenda and the programmes for \r\nhealth, education, development and peace, and to use it \r\nas a tool for achieving the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. We agree that “sport for all” should constitute a \r\nbasis for systematic efforts to use sports to promote \r\ndevelopment and peace. We believe that more attention \r\nand resources should be devoted to the cause of sport \r\nfor development and peace. \r\n China has a huge population and pays great \r\nattention to sports. A mutually reinforcing relationship \r\nhas developed between sport and development in \r\nChina. The past five years witnessed enormous \r\nachievements in China’s economic and social \r\ndevelopment, and also the rapid development of sports. \r\nThe year 2006 marks the eleventh anniversary of the \r\nlaunch of the Outline of the National Plan on Sport and \r\nFitness for All. Today, awareness of the benefits of \r\nsports is rising among the Chinese people, resulting in \r\nincreasing participation in sports and fitness activities. \r\nSport for all at the grass-roots level has turned a brand \r\nnew page in its development. \r\n A/61/PV.48\r\n \r\n21 06-60547 \r\n \r\n As the host of the 2008 Olympic Games, China’s \r\npreparations for the Games are now in full swing. For \r\nthe next five years, China’s overall objective in the \r\nfield of sports will be to use the opportunity of hosting \r\nand participating in the 2008 Olympics as a spur to the \r\nnation-wide efforts to implement sport for all, achieve \r\npreliminary results in creating a national system of \r\nsport and fitness with Chinese characteristics and \r\nrealize the integrated, coordinated and sustainable \r\ndevelopment of sports. \r\n In 2007, the twelfth Special Summer Olympic \r\nGames will be held in Shanghai. This is the first time \r\nfor the Special Summer Olympic Games to make its \r\nway into a developing country. This will surely further \r\nenhance the development of various activities related \r\nto the Special Olympics and promote China’s efforts in \r\nsafeguarding the rights and interests of persons with \r\ndisabilities. In order to present the Shanghai Special \r\nOlympics to the world, the Permanent Mission of \r\nChina to the United Nations, in concert with the \r\nMunicipal Government of Shanghai, the International \r\nCommittee for Special Olympic Games, the \r\nPreparatory Committee of the Special Olympic Games \r\nin Shanghai and the United Nations New York Sport \r\nOffice, will organize a thematic forum, reception and \r\nphoto exhibition next Friday, 10 November. We look \r\nforward to the active participation of all delegations \r\nand representatives of the Secretariat. \r\n As pointed out in the 2005 World Summit \r\nOutcome (resolution 60/1), sport can foster peace and \r\ndevelopment and contribute to an atmosphere of \r\ntolerance and understanding. The Chinese delegation \r\nwishes to reiterate on this occasion that we are ready to \r\njoin other Member States in working for the cause of \r\nsport for development and peace. We will integrate it \r\ninto our vision of building a harmonious society and, \r\nworking on that basis, contribute to our joint efforts for \r\ninternational peace, development and prosperity. \r\n Ms. Picco (Monaco) (spoke in French): First of \r\nall, allow me to thank the Secretary-General for his \r\nreport in which he presented the United Nations Plan \r\nof Action on Sport for Development and Peace \r\n(A/61/373) that we will be endorsing at the end of our \r\nmeeting. We would also like to congratulate the Special \r\nAdviser to the Secretary-General and the members of \r\nthe Office of Sport for Development and Peace for the \r\nwork that they have carried out and, specifically, for \r\nthe success of the Global Youth Leadership Summit \r\nwhich has just concluded in New York.  \r\n Any initiative which seeks to implement the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) should be \r\nwelcomed. Sport, as a vector for development and \r\npeace, transcends generations, cultures and beliefs.  \r\n On the initiative of its Princess, and in particular \r\nHis Serene Highness Prince Albert II, who is a member \r\nof the International Olympic Committee and an \r\naccomplished athlete who has participated at five \r\nOlympic Games, the Principality of Monaco has \r\nalways promoted sports as an instrument for peace, for \r\nexample, through the Olympic truce.  \r\n We therefore welcome, with great satisfaction, \r\nthe due recognition of the role of physical education \r\nand sport in promoting the basic values and principles \r\nof solidarity, tolerance, a culture of peace, gender \r\nequality, the recognition of special needs of the \r\nhandicapped and the intercultural dialogue, values also \r\ncontinue in the Charter of our Organization. Sport, like \r\nculture, is an extraordinary means for human beings to \r\ncommunicate. We believe that sport is one of the \r\nnecessary elements for a true alliance of civilizations.  \r\n In addition, the participation of world-renowned \r\nchampions who are admired by all as goodwill \r\nambassadors is an exceptional tool because they can, \r\nbetter than anyone, transmit the ideals of the United \r\nNations to youth and promote the MDGs.  \r\n The Principality of Monaco organizes many world-\r\nrenowned sports events. During these competitions, \r\nathletes participate in competitions to benefit local \r\nnon-governmental organizations that work in the field \r\nof development. At the initiative of the Economic \r\nYouth Chamber of Monaco, a week-long relay race has \r\nbeen organized for many years. This race, known as \r\n“No Finish Line”, promotes children’s rights and is \r\nsupported by several generations of participants.  \r\n Both adults and children are united in their effort \r\nto defend a just cause while carrying out a healthy \r\nactivity. In the preparation of this race, children and \r\ntheir teachers are encouraged to think about the reasons \r\nbehind the need for the race beyond their family \r\nenvironment.  \r\n Every year, the Principality also organizes the \r\nSpecial Olympics Monaco, in which 52 handicapped \r\nathletes in 8 European teams inspire spectators’ \r\nadmiration. In October 2007, our Special Olympics \r\ndelegation will participate in the Special Olympic \r\nGames in Shanghai.  \r\nA/61/PV.48  \r\n \r\n06-60547 22 \r\n \r\n In 2007, Monaco will host the Games of the \r\nSmall States of Europe, an event created in 1984, \r\nwhich welcomes athletes from eight small European \r\nStates in the best competitive spirit. We hope that this \r\nevent, which receives the sponsorship of the \r\nInternational Olympic Committee, will allow us to \r\ndemonstrate the role of sport for peace and \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n Mr. Muñoz (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): I take the \r\nfloor to stress our support for the draft resolution \r\nentitled “Sport as a means to promote education, \r\nhealth, development and peace” (A/61/L.12). Chile has \r\nbeen very enthusiastic in supporting the consensus at \r\nthis General Assembly because we are convinced that \r\nsport is an effective vehicle to promote not just peace \r\nand development, but also to contribute to creating an \r\nenvironment of tolerance and dialogue which are so \r\nnecessary in the world today.  \r\n We would therefore like to congratulate Tunisia \r\non its work in putting forward this new draft \r\nresolution. Here, we would like to stress our interest in \r\nthe Plan of Action put forward by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his report “Sport for Development and \r\npeace: the way forward” (A/61/343), which we \r\nconsider an excellent tool for guidance over the next \r\nthree years which will allow us not just to bring \r\ntogether the efforts of Governments, civil society and \r\nmultilateral organizations, but also to expand and \r\nstrengthen plans and programmes that are being \r\nimplemented in these fields within each of our \r\ncountries.  \r\n The Plan of Action should also help us to \r\npromote a world culture of sport among young people, \r\nadults and the elderly, including, of course, \r\nhandicapped athletes — men, women and children, \r\ninhabitants of developed and developing countries — \r\nso as to improve their quality of life and contribute to a \r\nless violent, healthier and more tolerant world. We \r\nthink we need fewer bullets and more balls to use for \r\nsports, less conflict and more sports cooperation for \r\npeace and development.  \r\n At this point, I would like to acknowledge the \r\nrole of Mr. Adolph Ogi, the Special Adviser to the \r\nSecretary-General on Sport for Development and \r\nPeace, as well as Mr. Djibril Diallo, Director of the \r\nNew York Office of Sport for Development and Peace.  \r\n I would also like to recall that, from the \r\nbeginning, Chile has been promoting these shared \r\nobjectives. These objectives have been included in the \r\ninitiative in my country of incorporating paragraph 145 \r\nof the 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1) \r\nwhich refers to the need to stress that sports can foster \r\npeace and development among all of our peoples. \r\n What has been done so far is important, but there \r\nis still much to be done. We favour establishing \r\npartnerships to mobilize resources and to build national \r\ncapacity, particularly together with the private sector \r\nand civil society. In this connection, foundations, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and sports federations play \r\na central role. \r\n Chile believes firmly that adopting this draft \r\nresolution could provide an excellent platform to fully \r\nimplement the international development objectives as \r\nstated in the Millennium Declaration. As an active \r\nmember of the Group of Friends of Sport for \r\nDevelopment and Peace, Chile is pleased with the work \r\ncompleted during 2006 and believes that, in order to \r\ncapitalize on these accomplishments, we need more \r\nspecific initiatives that will allow us to integrate sports \r\nin plans and programmes for development and peace, \r\nboth in the national and international spheres. We \r\ncommit ourselves to continue to work actively together \r\nwith others in achieving these noble objectives. \r\n Mr. Zheglov (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): Sport, peace and development are closely \r\ninterrelated concepts. The absence of war is an \r\nessential condition for competitive sport. Sport brings \r\npeoples closer together; the spirit of competition in \r\nsport does not mean combat between enemies, but \r\nworking with partners in the general quest for \r\ndevelopment. In a globalized world that is facing new \r\nchallenges and threats and in which dialogue between \r\ncivilizations is essential, we believe that international \r\ncooperation in sports can play an important role in \r\ncombating national and religious hatred and in \r\nstrengthening the world community. As a powerful \r\neducational tool for developing mutual respect and \r\ntolerance, sport can be a factor in combating terrorist \r\nideologies and intolerance. This was evident in the \r\nconcrete outcomes of the International Year of Sports \r\nand Physical Education, which helped to address a \r\nnumber of social and economic issues. In the \r\nframework of the International Year of Sport, an \r\ninternational conference on sport and peace was held in \r\nMoscow; it gave fresh momentum to international \r\nefforts to prevent conflict, to reject enmity and \r\naggression and to promote peace and harmony. \r\n A/61/PV.48\r\n \r\n23 06-60547 \r\n \r\n The President and the Government of the Russian \r\nFederation consider the dissemination in our country of \r\nthe humanist values of sport to be of great importance. \r\nWith that objective in mind, in January 2006 Russia \r\nadopted a federal programme for the development of \r\nphysical education and sport. The programme aims to \r\nincrease threefold the number of individuals \r\nparticipating in sport and significantly develop sports \r\ninfrastructure. We attach particular importance to \r\ndisseminating the high ideals of sport and the Olympic \r\nmovement among children and young people. The \r\nnumber of important international sporting events \r\nbeing held in Russia is increasing. In 2006, our country \r\nhosted the world championships in track and field and \r\nwomen’s soccer and European championships in \r\nwrestling and shooting, as well as the world and \r\nEuropean championships in water polo, judo and \r\nfreestyle. We are now focusing on our bid to host the \r\n2014 Winter Olympic Games and the Paralympic \r\nGames in Sochi. We believe that holding the Olympics \r\nin our country will promote the development of the \r\nOlympic movement. \r\n Russia particularly welcomes the activities of the \r\nUnited Nations in strengthening international \r\ncooperation in the area of competitive sports and in \r\nreaffirming the ideals of sport. We welcome the joint \r\ninitiatives of the United Nations and the International \r\nOlympic Committee aimed at promoting the \r\ndevelopment of sport and physical education, \r\ndeveloping education and health programmes, \r\nprotecting the environment, combating hunger and \r\npromoting the advancement of women. Supporting \r\nsports, especially at the policy level, can help countries \r\nto achieve the Millennium Development Goals. We \r\nwelcome the Secretary-General’s report on sport for \r\ndevelopment and peace (A/61/373). Russia is a sponsor \r\nof draft resolution A/61/L.12, introduced by Tunisia \r\nand entitled “Sport as a means to promote education, \r\nhealth, development and peace”. We appeal for support \r\nfor that constructive document.  \r\n We thank Mr. Adolf Ogi, Special Adviser to the \r\nSecretary-General on Sport for Development and \r\nPeace, for the active role that he has played. We are \r\nready to continue our fruitful collaboration with the \r\nSpecial Adviser and fully support the continued \r\noperation of the New York Office for Sport for \r\nDevelopment and Peace, headed by Mr. Djibril Diallo. \r\n Sport is a universal language of communication. \r\nAs participants in sporting events include people from \r\nvarious countries, cultures and faiths, it would appear \r\nthat “sports diplomacy” has great potential and can \r\nbecome an effective medium for promoting a culture of \r\npeace and dialogue among civilizations. As Pierre de \r\nCourbetin said, sport is a true ambassador for peace, a \r\nbridge to establish friendship and mutual \r\nunderstanding among peoples. We must make full use \r\nof that potential. \r\n Mr. Løvald (Norway): It is widely acknowledged \r\nthat sport can contribute to an atmosphere of tolerance \r\nand understanding. Sport and physical education can \r\npresent opportunities for solidarity and cooperation in \r\norder to promote tolerance, a culture of peace, social \r\nand gender equality, adequate resources for the special \r\nneeds of persons with disabilities, intercultural \r\ndialogue and social cohesion. \r\n The International Year of Sport and Physical \r\nEducation 2005 generated considerable attention in \r\nterms of the relevance of sports for peace and \r\ndevelopment. The momentum created as a result of the \r\nInternational Year provides a good basis for important \r\nfollow-up. A key aspect in this regard will be the \r\nstrengthening of the clear linkage between the \r\nopportunity to participate in sport and the achievement \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the \r\nbroader goals of sustainable development and peace. \r\n Sports-based initiatives should be among the \r\nefforts to achieve the MDGs. The integration and \r\nmainstreaming of sport for development and peace in \r\ndevelopment programmes and policies are key in this \r\nregard. Norway supports the strategy that “sport for \r\nall” should be the basis for the systematic use of sport \r\nfor development and peace. The most effective way to \r\npromote sport for all is through schools. Sport must be \r\nintegrated into education plans in schools at all levels. \r\n The United Nations has a clear role in \r\nimplementing the agenda of sports for development \r\nand peace. The United Nations should promote the \r\nimplementation of partnerships, initiatives and \r\ndevelopment projects. Partnerships have proved to be a \r\nuseful approach in advancing and coordinating sport \r\nfor development and peace. Partnerships can also lay \r\nthe groundwork for the cost-effective integration of \r\nsports for development and peace into national \r\ndevelopment policies and programmes. \r\n Sport programmes should be initiated to promote \r\ngender equality and the empowerment of women. \r\nConcerted efforts should be made to move positions \r\nA/61/PV.48  \r\n \r\n06-60547 24 \r\n \r\nforward on women and sport. The follow-up process \r\nshould be more systematic and effective in order to \r\nsupport a gender perspective. Intensified efforts in the \r\narea of sports should also be used to promote greater \r\nawareness and action to foster peace. In this regard, the \r\nfull implementation of Security Council resolution \r\n1325 (2000), on women and peace and security, is \r\nimportant. \r\n Norway supports the United Nations Action Plan \r\non Sport for Development and Peace, presented in the \r\nreport of the Secretary-General (A/61/373). The aim of \r\nthe Action Plan is to realize the full potential of sport \r\nas a powerful, cost-effective way of supporting \r\nMember States in achieving the MDGs by 2015 and in \r\nattaining the broader goals of sustainable development \r\nand lasting peace. The intention is to expand and \r\nstrengthen partnerships and sport for development and \r\npeace programmes and projects, as well as advocacy \r\nand communications activities. \r\n In this respect I would like to emphasize the \r\nimportant work done by civil society. In particular, \r\nNorway has been proud to support Right To Play, an \r\ninternational humanitarian non-governmental \r\norganization headed by the Norwegian four-time Olympic \r\ngold medallist Johann Olav Koss, with programmes in \r\nclose to 30 countries. We are equally impressed by the \r\nMathare Youth Sports Association in Kenya and its \r\nwork for children and youth in slum areas. \r\n Norway would also like to praise the work of the \r\nSpecial Adviser to the Secretary-General on Sport for \r\nDevelopment and Peace, Mr. Adolf Ogi, for his \r\ndedication to these issues. He has indeed played a key \r\nrole in promoting this important agenda. \r\n Mr. Spatafora (Italy): Let me start by thanking \r\nmy colleague and friend, Ambassador Hachani of \r\nTunisia, for his initiative to introduce this important \r\ndraft resolution once again this year.  \r\n Let there be no doubt as to the strong support of \r\nthe Government of Italy for this new area of activities \r\nof the United Nations — support that was recently \r\nrenewed by our Minister for Sport and Youth in her \r\nstatement at the opening of the youth leadership \r\nsummit that took place in this very Hall last Sunday, \r\norganized by the United Nations New York Office of \r\nSport for Development and Peace. \r\n Italy is actively involved in the work of the \r\nGroup of Friends of Sport for Development and Peace. \r\nI would like here to commend the efforts of the Office \r\nof Sport for Development and Peace, under the \r\npassionate and committed leadership of the Special \r\nAdviser, Mr. Ogi, and of Mr. Djibril Diallo, who \r\ndeserve our warmest and most sincere thanks. Let me \r\nrecall here that the former President of the General \r\nAssembly, Mr. Eliasson, used to say that without \r\npassion, nothing happens in life, and without \r\ncompassion, the wrong things happen. Well, I must say \r\nthat Djibril Diallo, the Director of the new United \r\nNations Office, truly shows that passion and that \r\ncompassion. \r\n Italy is happy to be a sponsor of this draft \r\nresolution, as it was last year. I do not want to repeat \r\nhere what I said last year on this subject, which has \r\nalso been stated very eloquently by other colleagues \r\nwho spoke earlier this evening. We all know and \r\nacknowledge to what extent sport is a new and \r\nimportant tool for achieving the goals of the United \r\nNations in the field of peace, development, education \r\nand health. \r\n We have achieved a broad consensus on the basis \r\nof our strategy in this field; what we need now is \r\naction. \r\n What I wish to stress here today is the fact that \r\nthe responsibility for implementing this draft \r\nresolution, once adopted, now lies with Member States \r\nand the United Nations system. The draft makes \r\nspecific requests for action by all Member States. We \r\nare all called by the resolution to put in place concrete \r\noperational initiatives in order to translate into reality \r\nthe United Nations strategy in this field. \r\n We are called to mainstream sport for \r\ndevelopment in our development programmes in order \r\nto apply the benefits of this strategy directly in, for \r\nexample, least developed countries. We are in \r\nparticular called to assist the least developed countries \r\nin their capacity-building efforts in sports programmes. \r\n We are called also to promote new funding and \r\narrangements in taking forward this strategy, and, \r\nfinally, we are called to mobilize our civil society \r\nthrough the engagement of sport organizations, athletes \r\nand the private sector. \r\n We are the United Nations. What is at stake is our \r\ncredibility — the credibility of the General Assembly \r\nand of its revitalized role. When we all meet again in \r\nthis Hall next year to review the situation, we will have \r\n A/61/PV.48\r\n \r\n25 06-60547 \r\n \r\nto produce evidence of concrete progress and action in \r\nthis field. We will have to show that we have delivered \r\nand that we are delivering because we have a vision \r\nand the political will to go on implementing it. \r\n Mr. Psiachas (Greece): Greece proudly \r\nco-sponsored the draft resolution on sport as a means \r\nto promote education, health, development and peace. \r\nIn addition, Greece continues to promote the idea of \r\nthe Olympic Truce, a noble cause dating back to our \r\nantiquity. \r\n The international community is becoming \r\nincreasingly aware of the unique position of sport to \r\nspread the message of peace and foster development. \r\nGreece, which last hosted the Olympic Games in their \r\nbirthplace and, incidentally, currently holds the titles of \r\nEuropean champion in both football and basketball, \r\nfully supports the Secretary-General’s Action Plan and \r\nlooks forward to developing synergies among \r\nGovernments, sport-related organizations, and the \r\nprivate sector. \r\n Greece would like in that regard to convey its \r\nsincere thanks and congratulations to the Special \r\nAdviser on Sport for Development and Peace, as well \r\nas to the Office of Sport for Development and Peace, \r\nfor their bold initiatives in this area. \r\n Mr. Lutterotti (Austria): Sport is indeed — as \r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan said — a universal \r\nlanguage and a powerful tool that brings people \r\ntogether, no matter what their origin, background, \r\nreligious beliefs or economic status. \r\n Austria strongly believes in the power of sport to \r\ncontribute to development and peace. Sport is an \r\neffective and low-cost means of promoting the \r\nattainment of the Millennium Development Goals, to \r\nwhich Austria is fully committed. We note with \r\nsatisfaction that the International Year for Sport and \r\nPhysical Education in 2005 created an important \r\nmomentum worldwide. That momentum was reinforced \r\nby the recent youth leadership summit held in New \r\nYork. Now it is up to us to build upon this momentum. \r\nIn this perspective, we welcome the report of the  \r\n \r\nSecretary-General and his Action Plan. Sports as a \r\nmeans for peace and development must remain high on \r\nour agenda. \r\n We wish to commend the Special Adviser to the \r\nSecretary-General on Sport for Development and \r\nPeace, Mr. Adolf Ogi, for his tireless, energetic and \r\naction-oriented efforts. We hope that he will continue \r\nto serve in this capacity in the future with the support \r\nof the United Nations system. Our special thanks also \r\ngo to the New York Office of Sport for Development \r\nand Peace, under the able leadership of Mr. Djibril \r\nDiallo. \r\n Austria welcomes draft resolution A/61/L.12 on \r\n“Sports as a means to promote education, health, \r\ndevelopment and peace”. We thank Tunisia for its \r\nefforts in drafting and negotiating the draft resolution. \r\nMy delegation is pleased to be a co-sponsor. \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\ntake action on draft resolution A/61/L.12, entitled \r\n“Sport as a means to promote education, health, \r\ndevelopment and peace”. \r\n There are four additional sponsors: Cameroon, \r\nMauritius, Portugal and the United Arab Emirates. \r\n May I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt \r\ndraft resolution A/61/L.12? \r\n Draft resolution A/61/L.12 was adopted \r\n(resolution 61/10). \r\n The Acting President: May I take it that it is the \r\nwish of the Assembly to conclude its consideration of \r\nagenda item 49? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n \r\nProgramme of work \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I should \r\nlike to inform Member States that, at the request of the \r\nsponsor, consideration of agenda item 45, entitled “The \r\nrole of the United Nations in promoting a new global \r\nhuman order”, has been postponed to a later date. \r\n The meeting rose at 6 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
