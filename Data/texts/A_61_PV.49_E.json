(Bahrain) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 103 (continued) \r\n \r\nElections to fill vacancies in principal organs \r\n \r\n (a) Election of five non-permanent members of the \r\nSecurity Council \r\n \r\n The President: The General Assembly will \r\nresume its consideration of sub-item (a) of agenda item \r\n103 on the election of five non-permanent members of \r\nthe Security Council to replace those members whose \r\nterm of office expires on 31 December 2006. \r\n As members will recall, when the 44th plenary \r\nmeeting was adjourned on Tuesday morning, 31 October \r\n2006, there still remained one seat from among the \r\nLatin American and Caribbean States to be filled. \r\n Before proceeding further, I would like to inform \r\nmembers that I have received a letter dated 3 November \r\n2006 from the Chairman of the Group of Latin American \r\nand Caribbean States informing the Assembly that, \r\nafter the withdrawal of Guatemala and the Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela as candidates to the Security \r\nCouncil for the period 2007-2008, the Group has \r\nendorsed the candidature of Panama. \r\n In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of \r\nprocedure, we shall now proceed to the next round of \r\nballoting by secret ballot. \r\n This forty-eighth round of balloting, will, in \r\naccordance with rule 94 of the rules of procedure, also \r\nbe the twenty-third unrestricted ballot. \r\n For this forty-eighth round of balloting, may I \r\nremind the Assembly that any Member State from \r\namong the Latin American and Caribbean States may \r\nbe a candidate except those outgoing members and \r\nthose already members of the Security Council, namely \r\nArgentina and Peru. \r\n Before we begin the voting process, I should like to \r\nremind members that pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of \r\nprocedure of the General Assembly, no representative \r\nshall interrupt the voting except on a point of order on \r\nthe actual conduct of the voting. \r\n We shall now begin the voting process. Members \r\nare requested to remain seated until all the ballots have \r\nbeen collected. \r\n Ballot papers marked “B” will now be distributed. \r\nMay I ask representatives to write on the ballot papers \r\nmarked “B” for the Latin American and Caribbean States \r\nthe name of the one State for which they wish to vote. \r\n Ballot papers marked “B” will be declared invalid \r\nif they contain the name of more than one State as well \r\nas if they contain the name of a Member State which \r\ndoes not belong to that region. \r\n At the invitation of the President, Mr. Sepúlveda \r\n(Chile), Ms. Cerere (Kenya), Mr. Riedzal \r\n(Malaysia), Ms. Klausa (Poland) and Mr. Flueck \r\n(Switzerland) acted as tellers. \r\n A vote was taken by secret ballot. \r\n The meeting was suspended at 10.25 a.m. and \r\nresumed at 10.40 a.m. \r\nA/61/PV.49  \r\n \r\n06-60535 2 \r\n \r\n The President: The result of the voting is as \r\nfollows: \r\n Group B — Latin American and Caribbean States \r\n Number of ballot papers:   190 \r\n Number of invalid ballots:   1 \r\n Number of valid ballots:   189 \r\n Abstentions:     9 \r\n Required two-thirds majority:  120 \r\n Number of votes obtained: \r\n  Panama     164 \r\n  Venezuela     11 \r\n  Guatemala     4 \r\n  Barbados     1 \r\n Having obtained the required two-thirds majority \r\nand the largest number of votes, Panama is \r\nelected a member of the Security Council for a \r\ntwo-year term beginning 1 January 2007. \r\n The following five States have thus been elected \r\nmembers of the Security Council for a two-year \r\nterm beginning 1 January 2007: Belgium, \r\nIndonesia, Italy, Panama and South Africa. \r\n The President: I congratulate the States that have \r\nbeen elected members of the Security Council, and I \r\nthank the tellers for their assistance in this election. \r\n I am delighted that the General Assembly has just \r\nelected Panama, starting from 1 January 2007, as the \r\nsecond non-permanent member of the Security Council \r\nfrom among the Latin American and Caribbean Group \r\nof States. \r\n On this occasion, I would like to extend my \r\nwarmest congratulations to Panama on its election and \r\nwish it every success in the discharge of this important \r\nmandate. \r\n Allow me also to commend the Latin American and \r\nCaribbean Group of States for the spirit of compromise \r\nand solidarity they have shown throughout this process. \r\n In this context, I would like to express my \r\nsincerest appreciation to both Guatemala and the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela for their joint \r\ndecision to work closely with other members of the \r\nGroup in order to reach consensus on a compromise \r\ncandidate. I also wish to thank both countries for their \r\ncourteous manner and the exemplary cooperation \r\nextended to my office and to me personally. \r\n I now give the floor to the representative of \r\nGuatemala. \r\n Mr. Skinner-Klee (Guatemala) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): Madam President, thank you for allowing me \r\nto take the floor on this occasion. \r\n My delegation wishes to use this opportunity to \r\nreiterate its gratitude to your Government in particular \r\nand to each of the 116 countries that have supported us \r\nat this time in our aspiration to fill the non-permanent \r\nmember vacancy traditionally filled by a member of the \r\nLatin American and Caribbean Group in the Security \r\nCouncil during the 2007-2008 biennium. Our special \r\nrecognition goes to our Mesoamerican partners, the \r\ncountries of Central America, Colombia and Mexico. \r\n We also wish to thank all the members of the \r\nGeneral Assembly for their patience, as well as for the \r\nrespect shown through this electoral process that \r\nconcludes today. \r\n To the Government and people of Panama, we \r\nextend our heartfelt congratulations for their selection \r\nby the Latin American and Caribbean Group, on the \r\ninitiative of Guatemala and Venezuela, to be proposed \r\nto the General Assembly as the consensus candidate to \r\nrepresent our region in the Security Council during the \r\n2007-2008 biennium. We feel well-represented by \r\nPanama, a brotherly country and member of the Central \r\nAmerican Integration System. \r\n Although we regret the polarization of the campaign \r\nby reasons that had nothing to do with our own conduct, \r\nwe are proud of the fact that Guatemala could carry out a \r\nsystematic and professional campaign, well planned, \r\nand, above all, with dignity, respect and collegiality, \r\nthat was worthy of the endorsement of as many as 116 \r\nof the countries Members of this Organization. \r\n At all times, Guatemala has defended the \r\nprinciples and purposes enshrined in the United \r\nNations Charter, especially with regard to the friendly \r\nrelations among States, equitable geographical rotation \r\nand participation of small States in the various United \r\nNations bodies. \r\n Guatemala has waited for the opportunity to \r\nparticipate in the Security Council for more than 60 \r\nyears. We have more than sufficient merit to serve on \r\nthat body, and this is why my Government has duly \r\npresented to our regional Group its candidacy for the \r\nvacancy that will come up for the 2012-2013 biennium. \r\nIt is our hope that on that occasion the countries of the \r\nGroup of Latin American and Caribbean States will \r\ngive us their support. \r\n A/61/PV.49\r\n \r\n3 06-60535 \r\n \r\n Mr. Arias Cárdenas (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of the \r\nPresident of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, \r\nHugo Rafael Chávez Frías, and on behalf of our \r\npeople, we would like to thank all United Nations \r\nrepresentatives. We would like to thank you, Madam \r\nPresident, and the General Assembly for its support \r\nand understanding. \r\n We made a proposal — a very frank proposal of \r\nour own — to provide the Security Council with a \r\nbalanced and independent voice. The election was \r\nquite unique; it was more than a campaign between two \r\nbrotherly countries within one region where there was \r\nno consensus. Various statements were made in this \r\nvery Hall. Afterwards, the Ambassador of the United \r\nStates claimed that this had been a triumph for his \r\ncountry, for the United States, and that it had achieved \r\nits objective, namely to ensure that a developing \r\ncountry such as ours did not achieve a seat on the \r\nSecurity Council. \r\n We could deny this or draw other conclusions \r\nfrom this, but we would prefer not to do so. We would \r\nprefer to say that we would not like to speak of defeat \r\nor the defeated. But there must be lessons learned from \r\nthese 46 rounds of balloting in the General Assembly. \r\nFor the big countries, it should be clear that they \r\ncannot impose their will and that the Assembly will not \r\naccept imposition, because it exercises its freedom in \r\ndemocracy. We should also remember that some \r\nembraces end up by killing you, like a bear hug; and \r\neveryone should remember the strength and power of \r\nthe General Assembly. \r\n Finally, we must learn the strength of dialogue. In \r\nlooking at the proposal that the Group of Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean States (GRULAC) has put \r\nforward to the General Assembly — the proposal of \r\nPanama — which is a bridge between Central America \r\nand South America — a country that was part of the \r\ngreat liberator Simon Bolívar’s big homeland, Greater \r\nColombia, we hope that country will move forward, be \r\nindependent, impartial and balanced within the \r\nSecurity Council. Of course, as a nation with a vision, \r\nwe will be prepared to support them in every way \r\npossible. \r\n The President: That concludes our consideration \r\nof sub-item (a) of agenda item 103. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 103 (continued) \r\n \r\nElections to fill vacancies in principal organs \r\n \r\n (b) Election of eighteen members of the Economic \r\nand Social Council \r\n \r\n The President: The General Assembly will \r\nresume its consideration of sub-item (b) of agenda item \r\n103 on the election of 18 members of the Economic \r\nand Social Council to replace those members whose \r\nterm of office expires on 31 December 2006. \r\n Before proceeding further, I would like to remind \r\nmembers that, as was announced at the 46th plenary \r\nmeeting, on Thursday, 2 November 2006, we shall first \r\nhold elections to fill the one remaining seat from \r\namong the Eastern European States. Thereafter, we \r\nshall proceed to a by-election to elect a member of the \r\nCouncil from among the Western European and other \r\nStates. \r\n The General Assembly will now proceed to the \r\nelections to fill the one remaining seat from among the \r\nEastern European States. In accordance with rule 92 of \r\nthe rules of procedure, we shall proceed now to the \r\nnext round of balloting by secret ballot. This ninth \r\nround of balloting which, in accordance with rule 94 of \r\nthe rules of procedure, will also be the fifth restricted \r\nballot. This ninth round of balloting shall be restricted \r\nto the two States from among the Eastern European \r\nStates that were not elected in the previous ballot, \r\nnamely Belarus and Bulgaria. This is in accordance \r\nwith rule 94 of the rules of procedure. \r\n Before we begin the voting process, I should like \r\nto remind members that pursuant to rule 88 of the rules \r\nof procedure of the General Assembly, no \r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting except on a \r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the voting. \r\n We shall now begin the voting process. Members \r\nare requested to remain seated until all ballots have \r\nbeen collected. \r\n Ballot papers marked “C” will now be \r\ndistributed. May I ask representatives to write on the \r\nballot papers the name of the State for which they wish \r\nto vote. Ballot papers marked “C” for the Eastern \r\nEuropean States will be declared invalid if they contain \r\nthe name of a State other than Belarus or Bulgaria, as \r\nwell as if they contain the name of more than one \r\nState.  \r\nA/61/PV.49  \r\n \r\n06-60535 4 \r\n \r\n At the invitation of the President, Mr. Lomba \r\n(Gabon), Ms. Farfán (El Salvador), Mr. Komar \r\n(Indonesia), Ms. Aperans (Latvia) and Ms. Bovi \r\n(San Marino) acted as tellers. \r\n A vote was taken by secret ballot. \r\n The meeting was suspended at 11 a.m. \r\n  Mr. Penjo (Bhutan), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\n  The meeting resumed at 11.20 a.m. \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The result of the voting is \r\nas follows: \r\n Group C — Eastern European States \r\nNumber of ballot papers:    192 \r\nNumber of invalid ballots:     1 \r\nNumber of valid ballots:   191 \r\nAbstentions:      1 \r\nRequired two-thirds majority:   127  \r\nNumber of votes obtained: \r\n Belarus      114 \r\n Bulgaria      76  \r\n Since no candidate obtained the required two-\r\nthirds majority in the previous ballot, there remains \r\none seat to be filled from among the Eastern European \r\nStates. We shall therefore proceed to the tenth round of \r\nballoting. \r\n I give the floor to the representative of Bulgaria \r\non a point of order. \r\n Mr. Piperkov (Bulgaria): Upon instructions from \r\nmy Government, I wish to make the following \r\nstatement. \r\n The Republic of Bulgaria submitted its \r\ncandidature for membership of the United Nations \r\nEconomic and Social Council guided by the will to \r\ncontribute in good faith to effective partnership and \r\ncooperation among United Nations Member States in \r\nthe economic and social field. My country gave ample \r\nproof of its commitment to the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil during its several previous terms on the \r\nCouncil.  \r\n At the time of the elections for new members of \r\nthe Economic and Social Council held on 2 November \r\n2006, there were clear indications of wide support \r\namong Member States for the Bulgarian candidature. \r\nHowever, although in the first round Bulgaria received \r\n123 votes — five votes short of the required two-thirds \r\nmajority — we have taken note of the fact that our bid \r\nto serve on the Economic and Social Council for the \r\nperiod 2007-2009 did not receive the support of the \r\nrequired majority of Member States. Acting in a spirit \r\nof goodwill and cooperation, Bulgaria has therefore \r\ndecided to withdraw its candidature and to postpone it \r\nto a later time.  \r\n My country remains committed to the goals of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council and stands ready to \r\ncontribute in every possible way to streamlining the \r\nwork of that main United Nations body.  \r\n I would like to express our deep and sincere \r\ngratitude to all the countries that have given us their \r\nunwavering support throughout the election campaign.  \r\n The Acting President: I thank the representative \r\nof Bulgaria for his cooperation.  \r\n Taking into account the statement just made by \r\nthe representative of Bulgaria, we will proceed to the \r\nnext restricted ballot, in accordance with rule 94 of the \r\nrules of procedure. This round of balloting shall be \r\nrestricted to the two States from among the Eastern \r\nEuropean States that were not elected in the previous \r\nballot, namely, Belarus and Bulgaria. This is in \r\naccordance with rule 94 of the rules of procedure. \r\n Before we begin the voting process, I should like \r\nto remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the \r\nrules of procedure of the General Assembly, no \r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting except on a \r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the voting. \r\n We shall now begin the voting process. Members \r\nare requested to remain seated until all ballots have \r\nbeen counted. \r\n Ballot papers marked “C” will now be distributed. \r\nMay I ask representatives to write on the ballot papers \r\nthe name of the State for which they wish to vote. \r\nBallot papers marked “C” for the Eastern European \r\nStates will be declared invalid if they contain the name \r\nof a State other than Belarus or Bulgaria, as well as if \r\nthey contain the name of more than one State. \r\n At the invitation of the President, Mr. Lomba \r\n(Gabon), Ms. Farfán (El Salvador), Mr. Komar \r\n(Indonesia), Ms. Aperans (Latvia) and Ms. Bovi \r\n(San Marino) acted as tellers. \r\n A vote was taken by secret ballot. \r\n The meeting was suspended at 11.30 a.m. and \r\nresumed at 11.45 a.m. \r\n A/61/PV.49\r\n \r\n5 06-60535 \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The result of the voting is \r\nas follows: \r\nGroup C — Eastern European States \r\nNumber of ballot papers:    191 \r\nNumber of invalid ballots:     1 \r\nNumber of valid ballots:   190 \r\nAbstentions:      22 \r\nRequired two-thirds majority:   112  \r\nNumber of votes obtained:   \r\n Belarus      156 \r\n Bulgaria      12 \r\n Having obtained the required two-thirds majority, \r\nBelarus was elected a member of the Economic \r\nand Social Council for a three-year term \r\nbeginning 1 January 2007. \r\n The Acting President: Having obtained the \r\nrequired two-thirds majority of members present and \r\nvoting, the following 18 States have thus been elected \r\nmembers of the Economic and Social Council for a \r\nthree-year term beginning on 1 January 2007: Algeria, \r\nBarbados, Belarus, Bolivia, Canada, Cape Verde, \r\nEl Salvador, Indonesia, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Luxembourg, \r\nMalawi, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Romania, \r\nSomalia, the Sudan and the United States of America. \r\n I congratulate those States which have been \r\nelected members of the Economic and Social Council. \r\n As was announced earlier this morning, the \r\nAssembly will now proceed to a by-election to elect a \r\nmember of the Economic and Social Council, in \r\naccordance with rule 140 of the rules of procedure. \r\n In that connection, I should like to draw the \r\nattention of members to document A/61/557, \r\ncontaining a letter dated 2 November 2006 from the \r\nPermanent Representative of Australia to the United \r\nNations. In his letter, the Permanent Representative of \r\nAustralia announces that Australia would like to \r\nrelinquish its seat on the Economic and Social Council \r\nfor its remaining term in favour of New Zealand. \r\n As a result, a vacancy will occur and a new \r\nmember must therefore be elected to fill the unexpired \r\nterm of office of Australia, commencing 1 January \r\n2007 and expiring on 31 December 2007. \r\n In accordance with paragraph 4 of General \r\nAssembly resolution 2847 (XXVI) of 20 December \r\n1971, and taking into account that the vacancy will \r\noccur from among the Western European and other \r\nStates, the new member should therefore be elected \r\nfrom that region. \r\n I should like to inform the Assembly that the \r\ncandidate which receives a two-thirds majority of \r\nmembers present and voting will be declared elected. \r\nIn the case of a tie vote, there will be a special \r\nrestricted ballot limited to those candidates that have \r\nobtained an equal number of votes. \r\n May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to \r\nthat procedure? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The Acting President: In accordance with rule \r\n92 of the rules of procedure, the election shall be held \r\nby secret ballot, there shall be no nominations, and we \r\nshall now proceed to the election by secret ballot. \r\n I should like to inform members that, as of \r\n1 January 2007, the following States from the Group of \r\nWestern European and other States will be represented \r\non the Economic and Social Council: Austria, Canada, \r\nDenmark, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, \r\nLuxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, the United \r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the \r\nUnited States of America. \r\n The names of those 12 States should therefore not \r\nappear on the ballot. \r\n Before we begin the voting process, I should like \r\nto remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the \r\nrules of procedure of the General Assembly, no \r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting except on a \r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the voting. \r\n We shall now begin the voting process. Members \r\nare requested to remain seated until all the ballots have \r\nbeen collected. \r\n Ballot papers will now be distributed. I request \r\nrepresentatives to use only those ballot papers and to \r\nwrite on them the name of the one State for which they \r\nwish to vote. Ballot papers will be declared invalid if \r\nthey contain the name of more than one State as well as \r\nif they contain the name of a Member State which does \r\nnot belong to that region. \r\nAt the invitation of the President, Ms. Farfán (El \r\nSalvador), Mr. Lomba (Gabon), Mr. Komar \r\n(Indonesia), Ms. Aperans (Latvia) and Ms. Bovi \r\n(San Marino) acted as tellers. \r\n A vote was taken by secret ballot. \r\nA/61/PV.49  \r\n \r\n06-60535 6 \r\n \r\n The meeting was suspended at 12 noon and \r\nresumed at 12.15 p.m. \r\n The Acting President: The result of the voting is \r\nas follows: \r\nGroup E — Western European and other States \r\nNumber of ballot papers:    186 \r\nNumber of invalid ballots:     1 \r\nNumber of valid ballots:   185 \r\nAbstentions:      8 \r\nRequired two-thirds majority:   118  \r\nNumber of votes obtained:   \r\n New Zealand     176 \r\n San Marino      1 \r\nHaving obtained the required two-thirds majority, \r\nNew Zealand was elected a member of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council for a term of office \r\nbeginning 1 January 2007 and ending on \r\n31 December 2007. \r\n The Acting President: I congratulate New \r\nZealand, which has been elected a member of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council, and I thank the tellers \r\nfor their assistance in this election. \r\n The General Assembly has thus concluded its \r\nconsideration of sub-item (b) of agenda item 103. \r\n The meeting rose at 12.20 p.m. \r\n"
