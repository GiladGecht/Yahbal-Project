The Kingdom of Lesotho \r\ntherefore congratulates the Secretary-General on \r\nconvening this special meeting. \r\n It is an undisputable fact that international \r\nmigration involves both very positive impacts and very \r\noverwhelming challenges. Issues of human trafficking, \r\nhuman smuggling and acts of terrorism under the guise \r\nof migration are some of the challenges bedevilling the \r\nphenomenon of international migration. However, \r\nissues of international cooperation and regional \r\nintegration of States, improved migration infrastructure \r\nand the globalization drive have also reduced the \r\nimpact of the negative issues on migration. All these \r\nefforts should be channelled towards the realization of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals and the \r\nstrengthening and implementation of Member States’ \r\npoverty reduction strategies. My country’s position is \r\nthat the international community’s commitment and \r\ncooperation is needed more than ever before. \r\n I wish to submit a few recommendations to the \r\nHigh-level Dialogue for consideration. First, \r\ninternational migration affects national and regional \r\ndevelopment strategies and policies, and the disparities \r\nthat exist between the movement of capital, goods, \r\ninformation and the movement of persons must be \r\naddressed in a manner that increases global economic \r\nefficiency, reduces unemployment in some sectors in \r\ncountries of origin and promotes technology transfer, \r\ninvestment and venture capital. Secondly, effective \r\npolicies and practices must be put in place to address \r\nirregular migration, which includes the trafficking and \r\nsmuggling of persons. The protection of the human \r\nrights of migrants and their families, as enunciated in \r\nthe conventions of the United Nations and the \r\nInternational Labour Organization, is a central \r\ncomponent of comprehensive and balanced migration \r\nmanagement practices. \r\nA/61/PV.4  \r\n \r\n06-52183 2 \r\n \r\n Thirdly, there is solid evidence that migration of \r\ncitizens from one country to another has, in many \r\ninstances, assisted in improving the economic outlook \r\nfor one or both countries. The Kingdom of Lesotho has \r\nbeen and continues to be one of the main suppliers of \r\nmigrant labour to the neighbouring Republic of South \r\nAfrica. That has earned Lesotho huge economic \r\nbenefits in the form of remittances that have been \r\nrepatriated. \r\n The importance of remittances to many \r\nhouseholds and economies should be recognized. \r\nHowever, remittances in general, should not be seen as \r\na substitute for foreign direct investment, trade, \r\noverseas development assistance and debt relief. \r\nPolicies should be developed to assist remitters and \r\ntheir households by lowering the cost of remitting, \r\nremoving restrictions on the transfer of funds and \r\nimproving the level of investment and the productive \r\nuse of remittances. A professor once remarked that, as \r\nlong as the trends of globalization and technology \r\nretain their current dynamic, the issue of migration \r\nwith its concepts of “brain drain”, “brain gain” and \r\n“brain sharing” will remain with us for a long time. \r\n Regional consultative processes such as the \r\nMigration Dialogue for Southern Africa are crucial for \r\nfostering dialogue, mutual understanding and concerted \r\neffort among stakeholders with regard to migration \r\nchallenges. This High-level Dialogue is urged to \r\nrecognize their value and to encourage cooperation \r\namong them. \r\n Managing migration is a very daunting task for \r\nany country. That is complicated by the need for a \r\ncountry to ensure that those who enter its borders are \r\ndesirable members of our international community, not \r\ncriminals or perpetrators of terrorist acts. That requires \r\nboth stern and accommodating migration laws: the \r\nlegislation should be very harsh to those who have evil \r\nintentions when entering a country, while it should \r\nfacilitate protection for those with noble and \r\nacceptable intentions and freedom for them to stay in \r\nthe country. The balance is delicate and needs the \r\ncooperation and continued dialogue of the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n The President: Before I give the floor to the next \r\nspeaker, I have an announcement. As members are \r\naware, the General Assembly heard 20 speakers this \r\nmorning, and we still have 127 speakers remaining for \r\nthe High-level Dialogue. \r\n In this connection, there is no alternative but for \r\nthe Assembly to continue the meeting until 9 p.m. I \r\nwould like once again to appeal to Member States to \r\nlimit their statements to four minutes so that we can \r\nexhaust the list of speakers at a reasonable hour \r\ntomorrow evening. I hope that I can count on the \r\ncooperation of representatives to keep to the time limit. \r\n I give the floor to Her Excellency Senator \r\nAmanda Vanstone, Minister for Immigration and \r\nMulticultural Affairs of Australia. \r\n Ms. Vanstone (Australia): The challenge for \r\nStates is how best to govern flows of people in a way \r\nthat achieves the greatest benefit for all the parties \r\nconcerned — sending and receiving States and \r\nmigrants themselves. \r\n Australia’s entire social and economic fabric and \r\nsuccess have been built upon migration. Over the past \r\ndecade alone, we have welcomed nearly 1 million \r\npeople as permanent settlers. Almost 25 per cent of our \r\npopulation was born outside our country. \r\n We are pleased to have been recognized by the \r\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and \r\nDevelopment as an immigration country par excellence. \r\n That experience convinces us that well-managed \r\nmigration is the best way of ensuring that the process \r\nof migration results in the greatest benefits for all \r\nconcerned and, importantly, of reducing many of the \r\ntragic abuses now associated with irregular migration. \r\n Carefully managed legal migration is the best \r\nway to protect both the legitimate interests of States \r\nand the human rights of migrants. In this way, the \r\nscope for the exploitation of migrants by people-\r\nsmugglers, traffickers and unscrupulous employers is \r\nvastly diminished. \r\n The Australian experience also convinces us that \r\nwell- designed national migration policies backed by \r\neffective administrative capacity will do the most to \r\nopen up opportunities for nation-building and \r\ndevelopment. Migration policies based on labour \r\nmarket research and analysis, wide consultation with \r\nstakeholders and follow-up evaluation ensure that \r\nmigration is successfully geared to the needs and \r\ncapacities of a State. \r\n By fostering orderly humanitarian migration, we \r\nhave been able to make a commitment to seek out \r\nthose most in need and to maintain a resettlement \r\n A/61/PV.4\r\n \r\n3 06-52183 \r\n \r\nprogramme, with generous post-arrival help in all those \r\nthings required to establish a new life in another \r\ncountry, supported by whole-of-Government funding of \r\nabout $2 billion every four years. These policies will \r\ngreatly contribute to a positive experience for \r\nindividual migrants by ensuring respect and facilitating \r\nself-sufficiency and willing participation in our society. \r\nThe development challenges and benefits flowing from \r\nreturn migration, the recirculation of skills, remittances \r\nand diaspora-related investment have all been well \r\ndocumented. Development plans and strategies would \r\nclearly benefit from much stronger linkages with the \r\neffective management of migration. \r\n The contribution that migration can make to the \r\nachievement of development goals is not possible \r\nwithout effective administrative capacity to deliver. We \r\nbelieve that the International Organization for \r\nMigration (IOM), with its tremendous experience in \r\nmigration matters and its worldwide reach, is ideally \r\nplaced to be the prime vehicle for worldwide capacity-\r\nbuilding. In our own region, some States have strong \r\ncapacities and others do not. \r\n We work with partner countries in the Asia-\r\nPacific region to help build capacity so that we and our \r\npartners can reap the benefits of orderly migration and \r\ncurb the abuses associated with irregular migration. \r\n The very nature of international migration \r\nrequires cooperation among States. We are a long-term \r\nparticipant in dialogue and cooperation bilaterally, in \r\nregional consultative processes and at the global level. \r\nWe believe that the best way to promote understanding \r\nand cooperation on migration is by focusing on shared \r\ngoals and practical cooperative activities. \r\n At the global level, we participate actively in the \r\nhigh-quality annual dialogue on migration policy \r\nsponsored by the IOM. We have been closely involved \r\nin best-practice forums such as the Berne Initiative. In \r\nour own region, we participate in a range of \r\nconsultative processes. Australia believes that these \r\nprocesses, and similar regional processes in other parts \r\nof the world, form the most effective building blocks \r\nfor international dialogue and cooperation. We know \r\nthey work. \r\n Future international dialogue on migration is \r\nlikely to be most effective if it is built on these existing \r\nregional processes. They reflect the shared interests of \r\nStates and utilize the expertise of bodies such as the \r\nIOM. \r\n The President: I give the floor to His Excellency \r\nThe Honourable Nicholas Goche, Minister of Public \r\nService, Labour and Social Welfare of Zimbabwe. \r\n Mr. Goche (Zimbabwe): Allow me to \r\ncongratulate you, Madam, on your election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \r\nsession and to express my confidence that this High-\r\nlevel Dialogue on International Migration and \r\nDevelopment will have a fruitful outcome under your \r\nable stewardship. I would also like to thank the \r\nSecretary-General for his comprehensive report on the \r\nsubject under discussion today. \r\n It is indeed a welcome development that the \r\ninternational community has awakened to the \r\nimportance of international migration, not only as it \r\nrelates to the globalization process but also as it affects \r\ndevelopment in both countries of origin and countries \r\nof destination. The phenomenon of international \r\nmigration presents opportunities and challenges when \r\nexamined in terms of development. It is therefore our \r\nhope that this Dialogue will assist us in our collective \r\nefforts to map out concrete and practical strategies to \r\nturn international migration into a developmental tool \r\nthat is beneficial to all, in particular developing \r\ncountries. \r\n The perceived benefits of international migration \r\nto developing countries should not be limited to \r\nremittances alone. While remittances can go a long \r\nway towards improving the livelihoods of the recipient \r\nfamilies, they do not constitute a financial resource \r\nupon which long-term development strategies can be \r\nbased. Moreover, remittances do not compensate for \r\nthe loss of much-needed skilled and professional \r\npersonnel whom developing countries lose almost daily \r\nto developed countries. \r\n Zimbabwe, like many developing countries, \r\ninvests heavily in the education and training of its \r\npersonnel. However, a study done in 2005 shows that \r\nthe country had lost 60 per cent of its State-registered \r\nnurses and half of its medical doctors. Such a massive \r\nloss of skilled personnel, arising in part from the \r\naggressive recruitment methods employed by agencies \r\nand public and private organizations in developed \r\ncountries, calls for a more systematic approach to \r\naddressing this problem at the global level, at the core \r\nof which should be mechanisms whereby developed \r\ncountries compensate developing countries. \r\nA/61/PV.4  \r\n \r\n06-52183 4 \r\n \r\n For our part, we, as developing countries, should \r\nput in place policies and take measures that allow us to \r\nbenefit in terms of development from the phenomenon \r\nof migration. Such measures, which should also target \r\nour citizens abroad, should include reducing the cost of \r\nremittances, creating development funds to which non-\r\nresidents can contribute and encouraging non-residents \r\nto invest in designated sectors of the economy through \r\nappropriate measures to facilitate such investments. \r\n The other side of migration is the one that relates \r\nto irregular and undocumented migrants involved in \r\nillegal border crossing or “border jumping”, as it is \r\nknown in our region. These migrants constitute a group \r\nthat is more vulnerable to all kinds of exploitation and \r\nhuman rights abuses, and they form the bulk of \r\neconomic refugees. It is, therefore, vital that measures \r\nbe put in place to ensure their protection and humane \r\ntreatment. Bilateral and multilateral initiatives are \r\nneeded to ensure better treatment of these migrants. \r\nAlongside such efforts should be measures to address \r\nthe problem of xenophobia through public awareness. \r\nIndeed, xenophobic tendencies have become one of the \r\nbiggest challenges of our time. \r\n The Zimbabwe Government is currently working \r\nwith UNICEF, the International Organization for \r\nMigration and the International Labour Organization to \r\nprovide humanitarian assistance to irregular migrants \r\nwho face deportation from neighbouring countries. \r\nThis initiative, which the Government of Zimbabwe \r\nappreciates, is one example of the role that the United \r\nNations system and other international organizations \r\ncan play in assisting those who find themselves away \r\nfrom home and in difficult circumstances. \r\n Let me conclude by pointing out that, to the \r\nextent that migration is the unfinished business of \r\nglobalization, Zimbabwe will continue to encourage \r\nglobal dialogue on migration. Our considered view is \r\nthat only internationally agreed strategies and \r\nprogrammes will address the challenges posed by \r\ninternational migration and maximize the opportunities \r\nfor development that it presents for the benefit of all. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I now give the \r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdulla Ali Mohd \r\nAl-Kaabi, Minister of Labour and Social Affairs of the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates. \r\n Mr. Al-Kaabi (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in \r\nArabic): I wish at the outset, on behalf of my \r\ndelegation, to congratulate you, Madam, and your \r\ncountry on your election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-first session. Our delegation also \r\nexpresses its deepest appreciation to your predecessor, \r\nMr. Jan Eliasson, for his efforts in guiding the work of \r\nthe General Assembly during the sixtieth session. Our \r\nappreciation goes also to Secretary-General Kofi \r\nAnnan for his tireless efforts and for his \r\ncomprehensive reports on the various aspects of \r\ninternational migration and development. We also align \r\nourselves with the statement made by the Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of South Africa on behalf of the Group \r\nof 77 and China. \r\n International migration is a phenomenon that is as \r\nold as the human need to search for livelihood and \r\nsecurity. If thoughtfully regulated and invested in, it \r\ncould play a key role in constructive cooperation \r\namong the world’s nations in the areas of human \r\nassistance, the exchange of economic benefits and the \r\nbuilding of bridges of cultural tolerance among peoples \r\nand States. This would help promote sustainable \r\ndevelopment programmes, especially in developing \r\ncountries, and would bolster good relations and \r\nstrengthen efforts aimed at maintaining international \r\npeace and security. \r\n Since its establishment, the United Arab Emirates \r\nhas recognized the importance of economic and \r\ncultural cooperation between friendly and fraternal \r\ncountries; this carries with it economic and social \r\nbenefits and gains for all parties. Since oil began to \r\nflow in our country, the State has opted to import \r\nforeign labour to help build the infrastructure \r\nnecessary for laying the foundations of a modern State \r\nand advancing its institutions in order to achieve \r\nsustainable development and prosperity for its citizens. \r\n At the same time, it established a partnership \r\nwith labour-exporting countries, especially developing \r\nones, to help vitalize their economies and implement \r\ndevelopment programmes in those countries. It is \r\nestimated that external remittances amount to $22 \r\nbillion annually. Expatriate labour represents about 90 \r\nper cent of the total workforce in the United Arab \r\nEmirates. \r\n In the light of these statistics and their economic \r\nimplications, and to protect the special characteristics \r\nof Emirate society in the face of the cultural and social \r\nimpact of values and norms brought into the country by \r\nexpatriate labour, which could influence the social \r\nfabric and demographic make-up of the country, as \r\n A/61/PV.4\r\n \r\n5 06-52183 \r\n \r\nwell as for other sensitive reasons, the United Arab \r\nEmirates has enacted a set of laws and regulations \r\nensuring that guest workers in the country are \r\ntemporary, not permanent, immigrants. These workers \r\ndo not emigrate to live permanently in the United Arab \r\nEmirates; rather, they come on temporary work \r\ncontracts to perform specific jobs, after which they \r\nreturn home. These arrangements are made according \r\nto mechanisms and procedures agreed upon by \r\ncountries exporting and importing labour and have \r\nbeen endorsed by the International Migration \r\nOrganization. This arrangement has had positive \r\noutcomes and has yielded fruitful results for the \r\neconomies of both parties. \r\n Acting from its convictions and in line with a \r\npolicy based on principles of cooperation and respect \r\nfor human beings and for cultural and religious \r\ndiversity, the United Arab Emirates provides \r\nexpatriates with a friendly and tolerant social \r\nenvironment that meets their social and human needs. \r\nBelieving in the important role that expatriate labour \r\nplays in stimulating the economy, the State has enacted \r\nlaws and regulations to regulate the entry, residence \r\nand work of foreign workers and to ensure that their \r\nrights are protected in accordance with national laws \r\nand international treaties on labour, workers and \r\nhuman rights. The United Arab Emirates has ratified \r\nnine international treaties in this sphere. \r\n One of the most important rules was the law \r\npromulgated last year by our head of State, His \r\nHighness Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, \r\nregulating the use of children in camel racing. It \r\nprohibits using children of either sex, under the age of \r\n18, in any form of camel racing and subjects violators \r\nto severe penalties. Another new measure was adopted \r\nin July 2006, requiring that construction companies \r\nallow a two-and-a-half-hour midday break for \r\nlabourers who work under the sun during the months of \r\nJuly and August, when the temperature rises to very \r\nhigh levels. \r\n In conclusion, we hope that our dialogue will \r\nachieve its desired goal of leading our countries \r\ntowards progress, prosperity and sustainable \r\ndevelopment. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. E. Ahamed, Minister of State for \r\nExternal Affairs of India. \r\n Mr. Ahamed (India): Madam President, let me \r\njoin my colleagues in extending to you our heartfelt \r\nfelicitations on your election. \r\n International migration is a subject of much \r\nglobal interest at present. It involves people and has \r\ndiffering impacts on sending, receiving and transit \r\ncountries, including on their economies and their \r\nsocieties. I am, therefore, glad that international \r\nmigration is being discussed at the United Nations. I \r\nwould like to thank the Secretary-General for his \r\ndetailed report (A/60/871), as well as for the events \r\norganized as part of the preparatory process for this \r\nHigh-level Dialogue. \r\n India is a major country of origin, destination and \r\ntransit of migrants, with a long history of attracting \r\npeople and of sending people to other lands. It is \r\nestimated that around 20 million people of Indian \r\norigin live in other countries, while another 20 million \r\nmigrants, including a large number of irregular \r\nmigrants, are in India today. Overseas Indians, by dint \r\nof sheer effort, very often in trying circumstances, have \r\nsignificantly contributed to the countries of their \r\ndestination, while at the same time playing a positive \r\nrole in building a bridge with India. Recognizing this, \r\nevery year we celebrate their achievement with a \r\nPravasi Bharatiya Divas, or Day of the Indian Migrant, \r\nand have taken several innovative investment and \r\npolicy initiatives including the overseas citizenship of \r\nIndia programme. \r\n In the context of globalization there is a need to \r\nrecognize the inevitability of international migration. \r\nThat presents challenges and opportunities, including \r\nthe increased demand for specialists in developed \r\ncountries to strengthen their international \r\ncompetitiveness. In fact, the World Bank’s Global \r\nEconomic Prospects 2006 notes that a rise in migration \r\nfrom developing countries raises incomes of natives in \r\nhigh-income countries. The developed countries would \r\ntherefore benefit from a greater openness than hitherto \r\nin allowing movement of natural persons across \r\nnational frontiers and from greater political will and \r\ndetermination for a successful conclusion of the GATS \r\nMode 4 negotiations. \r\n High-income countries must address the \r\nlegitimate needs of migrants, including a refund of \r\ntheir pension benefits and social security contributions, \r\nespecially in cases of migrations of shorter duration. \r\nThe lack of appropriate or matching structures in the \r\nA/61/PV.4  \r\n \r\n06-52183 6 \r\n \r\ncountry of origin should not be made an excuse for the \r\ndenial of a migrant’s legitimate pension benefits. \r\nEfforts, especially in the case of short duration \r\nmigrants, also need to be made to reduce the cost of \r\nremittances. \r\n Coming from Kerala, one of the largest places of \r\norigin of many of our workers overseas, I can \r\npersonally testify to the importance of remittances. \r\nThey are often the most important source of livelihood \r\nfor the families of the migrant workers, and support not \r\njust one, but many persons. \r\n There are no restrictions in India on migrating \r\noverseas. We favour a regular, non-discriminatory and \r\norderly process, whether for permanent or short-term \r\nmigration. In this context, artificial barriers to \r\nmigration by high-income countries should not be \r\ncreated. Receiving, as well as sending countries, \r\nshould act to reinforce the positive impacts of from \r\nmigration and work together in a cooperative \r\natmosphere, while being sensitive to each other’s \r\nconcerns. \r\n We also believe that countries of origin benefit \r\nfrom the return of migrants with skills or capital that \r\nthey would not have acquired at home. The existence \r\nof reliable domestic institutions encourages the \r\ninvolvement of migrants in the development of their \r\ncountries of origin. Brain drain, as a result of the \r\nmigration of skilled and highly trained people, can also \r\nbe translated into an overall gain. \r\n As we speak about international migration today, \r\nwe also need to note the problematic facet of irregular \r\nmigration, which is a cause of concern for our \r\ncollective well-being. Moreover, there are serious \r\nsecurity implications, including the use of irregular \r\nmigrants as an instrument for cross-border terrorism \r\nand for creating social tension in the host country. This \r\nneeds to be tackled with a firm resolve. It is no longer \r\nthe concern only of domestic law enforcement, but is a \r\nmatter of global priority requiring a coordinated and a \r\nconcerted action. A similar firm resolve is required to \r\ntackle the scourge of people-smuggling and trafficking, \r\nespecially of women and children. \r\n Cooperative international efforts should result in \r\ncomprehensive, mutually beneficial solutions that are \r\nbased on the best practices dealing with international \r\nmigration. We recognize that international migration \r\nsolutions and approaches relevant to a particular \r\ncountry or region may not be appropriate for others. \r\nOur efforts should focus on promoting teamwork \r\namong nations and maximizing the benefits of \r\ninternational migration while reducing its negative \r\neffects. We also believe that regular interaction among \r\ncountries, including at the United Nations, could result \r\nin a win-win situation for all. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I call upon \r\nMrs. Aisha Abdel Hady, Minister of Manpower and \r\nMigration of the Arab Republic of Egypt. \r\n Mrs. Hady (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): I wish to \r\nexpress my gratitude and deep appreciation to the \r\nSecretary-General and staff of the United Nations for \r\ntheir endless effort in support of the general \r\nmembership of the Organization and their work \r\ntowards achieving the internationally agreed \r\ndevelopment goals. This Dialogue offers a very \r\nimportant opportunity to debate the relationship \r\nbetween migration and development in all its \r\ndimensions, in the hope that we can, through this \r\nconstructive dialogue, establish practical mechanisms \r\nand methods that maximize the benefits of migration \r\nand minimize its negative impact. \r\n Undoubtedly, international migration, if well \r\nmanaged, can contribute positively to countries of \r\norigin and countries of destination in every way —\r\n,economically, socially, politically, and culturally. \r\nMigration also faces many challenges that should be \r\naddressed in a responsible and balanced way, and in a \r\ncooperative and constructive manner, between \r\ncountries of origin and countries of destination and \r\nrelevant international organizations and civil society. \r\n International developments in recent years, \r\nincluding the increasing influence of globalization, \r\nhave affected the international community, as well as \r\ninternational migration. These developments have led \r\nto an increase in the number of people seeking to \r\nmigrate. Moreover, advances in information \r\ntechnology, coupled with more sophisticated means of \r\ncommunication and transportation, have encouraged \r\ncitizens of developing countries to migrate to \r\ndeveloped countries. The industrial boom and the \r\ndecline in population growth have also resulted in the \r\nneed of developed countries to attract working and \r\nhighly skilled labour from developing countries. This \r\nhas resulted in a wider gap between countries — both \r\neconomically and socially. It has also prompted new \r\nmotives for migration in poorer countries, particularly \r\nin the light of the prevailing shift from planned \r\n A/61/PV.4\r\n \r\n7 06-52183 \r\n \r\neconomies to market-oriented economies, with \r\naccompanying growth in unemployment in poorer \r\ncountries. \r\n There is therefore a need for us to address this \r\ndevelopmental imbalance in order to manage the \r\nphenomenon of migration — particularly illegal \r\nmigration — while protecting the rights of migrant \r\nworkers in receiving countries. We should seek to \r\ncreate a spirit of integration between migrants and the \r\ncitizens of those countries, and constantly work to help \r\ngenerate legal migration by increasing its flow through \r\nnew channels that maximize its developmental effects. \r\n If the economic effects of international migration \r\nconstitute an obvious reality, their social effects are \r\nalso very significant. In this context, all countries are \r\nresponsible, whether countries of origin or destination, \r\nfor the protection and preservation of the rights of \r\nmigrant workers and their families, regardless of their \r\nlegal status, according to national legislation and \r\ninternational law — namely, the 1990 International \r\nConvention on the Protection of the Rights of All \r\nMigrant Workers and Members of Their Families, \r\nwhich entered into effect in July 2003, and the United \r\nNations Convention against Transnational Organized \r\nCrime and its Protocols, particularly the Protocol to \r\nPrevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, \r\nespecially Women and Children, and the Protocol \r\nagainst the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea, and \r\nAir. \r\n Egypt believes that all countries should ratify \r\nthose conventions and that all instruments setting out \r\nthe rights of migrants should be brought together in \r\none document. Furthermore, we call for the \r\nstrengthening of international cooperation in promoting \r\nthe adoption of measures necessary to help migrants to \r\nintegrate successfully into the communities of recipient \r\ncountries in all economic, social and cultural fields. \r\n There can be no doubt that linking remittances to \r\ndevelopment in both countries of origin and host \r\ncountries is of the utmost importance in helping to \r\neradicate poverty, improve living and working \r\nconditions and reduce unemployment. Migration \r\npolicies should protect the economic and social \r\ninterests of all the countries concerned, without \r\nignoring the rights of the individual migrant. \r\n Given that remittances from migrants play a \r\nprominent role in the economic and social development \r\nof countries of origin, every effort should be made to \r\nderive the greatest possible benefit from those \r\nremittances. This will require cooperation between all \r\nparties, in both countries of origin and host countries, \r\naimed at reducing the cost of transferring remittances \r\nto countries of origin for investment in development \r\nprocesses. \r\n Egypt would like to emphasize strongly that \r\nmigrants’ remittances represent a private source of \r\ncapital that must not, under any circumstances, be \r\nconsidered as an alternative to assistance provided to \r\ncountries of origin in connection with the global \r\npartnership to eradicate poverty and achieve \r\nsustainable development. Consequently, an increase in \r\nthe volume of those remittances should not affect the \r\nvolume of official development assistance to countries \r\nof origin. \r\n It is important to highlight that the brain drain — \r\nthe migration of highly skilled labourers and scientists \r\nfrom countries of origin to recipient countries — has a \r\nnegative impact on the economic, political and social \r\ndevelopment of countries of origin. This phenomenon \r\nis of particular significance given the increasing \r\nnumber of highly skilled and specialized migrants who, \r\nby leaving their countries of origin, deprive such \r\ncountries of the benefit of their investment in the \r\neducation of those individuals. It is imperative, \r\ntherefore, that we reaffirm the need to limit the \r\nnegative effects of the selective migration policies of \r\nsome recipient countries that lead to the “brain drain”. \r\nCountries of origin should therefore be compensated \r\nfor the loss resulting from the migration of highly \r\nskilled workers and professionals. \r\n In this regard, Egypt supports the \r\nrecommendations contained in the report of the Global \r\nCommission on International Migration, particularly \r\nwith regard to directing joint investment projects and \r\nforeign assistance towards the sectors and countries \r\nthat are most affected by the migration of highly \r\nskilled labour. \r\n We also welcome the Secretary-General’s \r\ninitiative to ensure cooperation on immigration-related \r\nissues, as well as the appointment of a special \r\nrepresentative to deal with this vital issue. We look \r\nforward to an agreement among the relevant States in \r\nthat regard. \r\n Due attention should also be given to capacity-\r\nbuilding, particularly in developing countries, as that \r\nissue is one of the challenges in addressing global \r\nA/61/PV.4  \r\n \r\n06-52183 8 \r\n \r\nmigration in a holistic manner. In this context, Egypt \r\nemphasizes the need for technical and financial \r\nassistance to the source countries in order to provide \r\nsupport to national authorities entrusted with \r\nformulating migration policies. \r\n The migration policies and procedures that Egypt \r\nhas adopted are aimed at legalizing the status of illegal \r\nEgyptian migrants in the context of Egypt as a source \r\ncountry. It is in our interests to promote the \r\nlegalization of the status of illegal Egyptian migrants \r\nto the extent that circumstances allow in the recipient \r\ncountries and to work in close cooperation with our \r\ndevelopment partners to ensure the adoption of policies \r\nprotecting migrants from collective deportation and \r\nintegrating legal migrants and shielding them from \r\nracism and other forms of hostility. In that way we can \r\nprotect legal Egyptian migrants, working within legal \r\nframeworks to cooperate with recipient countries and \r\nsupport development plans to create jobs, achieve \r\nsustainable development and eradicate poverty. \r\n Egypt is also endeavouring to benefit from the \r\nexpertise and experience of its migrants, who should be \r\nconsidered a national resource, and to strengthen the \r\nlink between migrants and their homeland. \r\n To conclude, Madam President, I wish you every \r\nsuccess in your efforts during this session. \r\n The President: I give the floor to Her Excellency \r\nMrs. Vilija Blinkevičiūtė, Minister of Social Affairs \r\nand Labour of Lithuania. \r\n Mrs. Blinkevičiūtė (Lithuania): I would like to \r\nexpress my gratitude to the United Nations for having \r\norganized this important High-level Dialogue and for \r\nits significant contribution to migration, globalization \r\nand development issues. \r\n This Dialogue is a great opportunity to discuss \r\nthe interrelationship between development and \r\nmigration processes. The enhancing of cooperation as \r\nwe seek to increase synergy between migration and \r\ndevelopment is not only a priority for the European \r\nUnion (EU), but also at the top of the global policy \r\nagenda. \r\n Governments, international organizations and \r\nother actors involved in international policymaking \r\nincreasingly perceive migration as a factor capable of \r\ncontributing positively to the attainment of \r\ndevelopment goals. In seeking to maximize the benefits \r\nof migration and to minimize its negative impact, it is \r\nvery important to ensure that appropriate policies are in \r\nplace. We need to find the most effective ways and \r\nmeans of contributing to the enhancement of coherence \r\nbetween migration and development policies. Our \r\nactivities in this field will also make an important \r\ncontribution to the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. \r\n Lithuania has already experienced both sides of \r\nthe impact of migration on development. Our country \r\nis dealing mainly with economic migration. The impact \r\nhas been very recent; however, some trends can already \r\nbe discerned. \r\n Unfortunately, we are confronting negative \r\nmigration. At its peak in 1992, some 25,000 residents \r\nleft the country — about 0.7 per cent of the population. \r\nAt that time the change from a planned to a free-market \r\neconomy resulted in a high unemployment rate in our \r\ncountry, and Lithuanians started to leave to work \r\nabroad more frequently. \r\n Currently, potential Lithuanian migrants — \r\nespecially young people — tend to move abroad for \r\nshort periods for economic reasons and in order to gain \r\nexperience. The number willing to emigrate is \r\ndecreasing, because the economy is growing and there \r\nare now greater opportunities in Lithuania. There is \r\nalso better knowledge now of the positive and negative \r\naspects of emigration. \r\n Emigration played a big role in the rapid decline \r\nof the unemployment rate and in the increase in wages \r\nin Lithuania. On the other hand, emigration has had an \r\neffect on the immigration of foreigners into the \r\ncountry. Owing to shortages in the qualified labour \r\nforce, Lithuanian employers have started to employ \r\nforeign — non-EU — citizens more frequently. \r\n We recognize the necessity of carefully regulated \r\nmigration processes. Therefore, Lithuania is seeking to \r\ncreate a single comprehensive tool, both political and \r\ninstitutional, at all administrative levels, to ensure \r\nproper and adequate migration management. That will \r\nyield appropriate solutions to various problems, \r\nincluding demographic ones. \r\n Lithuania is aiming to ensure the effective \r\nmanagement of economic migration issues through \r\ndomestic policy measures relating to, inter alia, the \r\nbusiness environment, the labour market, human \r\nresources, skills improvement and health protection, as \r\n A/61/PV.4\r\n \r\n9 06-52183 \r\n \r\nwell as by increasing the economic activity of the \r\nLithuanian people. \r\n Particular attention is paid to informing \r\nLithuanian residents who intend to emigrate abroad \r\nabout the risks of irregular migration and trafficking, \r\nand to informing those who have already left the \r\ncountry about opportunities if they return to Lithuania. \r\nLithuania recognizes that effective return policies are \r\nrequired. For instance, we started a project aimed at the \r\nreturn of our scientists and doctors who work abroad \r\nand have observed a lively interest in it. Moreover, we \r\nhave already seen some signs of return migration in the \r\nprivate sector due to its active development and \r\neconomic growth and the subsequent increase in wages. \r\n In that context, Lithuania emphasizes its interest \r\nin promoting close international cooperation. It is \r\nimportant to exchange best practices in solving migration \r\nissues, as well as to create new mechanisms to ensure \r\nthe positive influence of migration on development. \r\n We know that there is no single miracle solution \r\nto the problems we are discussing today. Therefore, we \r\nshould encourage dialogue based on partnership and \r\ncooperation, involving all stakeholders and aimed at \r\nproper and effective solutions. \r\n I believe that our meeting today will be an \r\nimportant step in the right direction. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency The Honourable Michael Browne, Minister \r\nof National Mobilisation, Social Development, Gender \r\nAffairs, Non-Governmental Organizations Relations, \r\nLocal Government and Persons with Disabilities of \r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines. \r\n Mr. Browne (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines): \r\nAs this is the first time that I have the honour to \r\naddress you in your current capacity, Madam, let me \r\nextend warm and sincere congratulations to you on \r\nyour election to the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-first session. The delegation of \r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines extends best wishes \r\nfor a successful tenure of office, and we offer our \r\nsupport of policies, programmes and practices that \r\nobjectively advance the welfare of the disadvantaged \r\nof the world. \r\n This body is to be congratulated for frontally \r\nputting on the agenda the issue of international \r\nmigration, contextualizing it within a developmental \r\nframe. We share the view of Secretary-General Annan, \r\nwhen he expressed the hope that this High-level \r\nDialogue “will be a beginning, not an end”. Of course, \r\nthere are precursors to this encounter since the matter \r\nhas occupied international attention for a long time. \r\nHowever, it does allow the global community the \r\nopportunity to address the issue in a collective manner \r\nthat could create the necessary political will, thereby \r\npermitting the mobilization of relevant and requisite \r\nresources. \r\n Although a tiny nation in the global scheme of \r\nthings, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines has a large \r\nhistorical and contemporary experience of migration. \r\nOur approach to the matter, deriving from that \r\nexperience, is essentially humanist, and we humbly \r\nsuggest that it is a philosophical prism through which \r\nthe issue can be viewed. \r\n The complex dialectic of immigration and \r\nemigration, which constitutes migration, demands an \r\nappreciation of the context of the phenomenon. If we \r\naccept the thesis of push-pull factors at work, clearly \r\nwe must also acknowledge the connection between \r\nunderdevelopment and development; that the relatively \r\nhigh standard of living of developed countries cannot, \r\nin historical and contemporary terms, be separated \r\nfrom the low standard of living of underdeveloped and \r\nunderdeveloping countries. That is why issues of \r\neconomic exploitation, whatever the modus — trade \r\nimbalances, poor working conditions, low wages — are \r\ninseparable from the issue before us, and that is why \r\nthe issue of reparations must be part of this Dialogue. \r\n The humanist perspective insists that the issue be \r\naddressed within the framework of a reconfiguration of \r\nthe world’s resources. This is the axis on which the \r\nDialogue must spin, if it is to have meaning. The effect \r\notherwise would be to perpetuate an injustice against \r\n“The wretched of the earth”, to borrow the words of a \r\nCaribbean son, Frantz Fanon. \r\n The Government of Saint Vincent and the \r\nGrenadines places no barriers on emigrants, persons \r\nwishing to leave our country, with the exception, \r\nnaturally, of criminals. But, bearing in mind that \r\nemigrants include well-trained nationals, produced at \r\nconsiderable cost to our small nation, we subscribe to \r\nthe view that appropriate protocols should be \r\nestablished. We in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines \r\nwere very involved in the development of the \r\nCommonwealth Teacher Recruitment Protocol adopted \r\nby Commonwealth Ministers of Education on \r\nA/61/PV.4  \r\n \r\n06-52183 10 \r\n \r\n1 September 2004. Of note also, is the 18 May 2003, \r\nadoption of the Commonwealth Code of Practice for \r\nthe International Recruitment of Health Workers. The \r\nmatter of protocols must be a focal point of our \r\ndiscussion. \r\n Immigration is understandably complex, since it \r\nraises other issues, among which is security. In other \r\ncontexts, though not in ours, the matter of xenophobia \r\nis of relevance. While we remain receptive to persons \r\nfrom all parts of the world, including retirees who \r\nenjoy the tranquillity and fine weather of our beloved \r\nhomeland, we reserve the right of scrutiny and due \r\ndiligence. That brings to the fore the issue of bilateral \r\ncooperation and agreement, and hence the international \r\ndimension. \r\n It is noteworthy that our country operates under \r\nthe revised Treaty of Chaguaramas which established \r\nthe Caribbean Community (CARICOM) Single Market \r\nand Economy. That Treaty makes provision, under \r\narticles 45 and 46, for the movement of CARICOM \r\nnationals. In Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, we \r\nhave passed the requisite legislation in support of \r\ncertain categories of persons wishing to work and \r\noperate in our country. \r\n Saint Vincent and the Grenadines affirms its \r\nsupport for the intent and thrust of the April 2006 \r\nBrussels Declaration of the African, Caribbean and \r\nPacific Countries on this issue. That Declaration \r\naddresses the gamut of issues from remittances to the \r\nrepatriation of criminals. \r\n In conclusion, it is necessary for this Dialogue to \r\ncontinue and for us to implement, as speedily as \r\npossible, the recommendations of this encounter. In so \r\ndoing, we must always bear in mind the conditions \r\nwhich give rise to the phenomenon which occupies our \r\nattention today. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Jean de Dieu Somda, Minister of Regional \r\nCooperation of Burkina Faso. \r\n Mr. Somda (Burkina Faso) (spoke in French): \r\nMadam, allow me at the outset to convey to you the \r\nwarm and heartfelt congratulations of my delegation \r\nupon your election to the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-first session, and to pledge to you \r\nthe full cooperation of my delegation. \r\n The sixty-first session will go down in the annals \r\nof the United Nations because it is also the occasion of \r\na first-ever High-level Dialogue on International \r\nMigration and Development. Burkina Faso, a country \r\nof emigration, is pleased that the High-level Dialogue \r\nis being held, as it provides a valuable opportunity for \r\nStates to exchange views on their experiences in \r\nmanaging migration. It is also a framework for \r\ncooperation in such management, in order to do a \r\nbetter job addressing the phenomenon of migration. \r\n Burkina Faso, a nation of about 12 million \r\npeople, has more than one third of its population living \r\nabroad. Burkina Faso emigration is essentially a \r\nphenomenon of youth between the ages of 15 and 30 \r\nyears. My country is convinced that we will not \r\nmanage migration flows through security or border \r\ncontrol measures. It is rather by attacking the root \r\ncauses of migration that we will find appropriate \r\nsolutions to the problem. As migration and \r\ndevelopment are inextricably linked, it is now more \r\nurgent than ever to work to close the gap that separates \r\ndeveloped countries from developing countries, and to \r\nstrengthen peacebuilding and the building of political \r\nstability in order to manage migration flows, as well as \r\nto prevent conflicts. \r\n The countries of the North must take the \r\nmigration aspect into account as an essential element in \r\nthe financing of poverty reduction strategies. \r\nDeveloped countries must understand that the best way \r\nto limit the number of potential immigrants is to \r\ncontribute to the development of their countries of \r\norigin. In that regard, we welcome the cooperation \r\nbetween Burkina Faso and the Republic of China on \r\nTaiwan. That cooperation has made possible the \r\nsuccessful implementation of six national commitments \r\nmade by President Blaise Compaore for the purpose of \r\ncombating poverty and emigration by young people \r\nand women. \r\n My country is convinced that poverty and the \r\nshortage of jobs and sufficient opportunities for the \r\nfuture are the major causes of migration. For almost \r\nhalf a century, my country has been taking numerous \r\nsteps to better manage migration at the national level. \r\nThose steps have included the May 1993 establishment \r\nof the Supreme Council of Burkinabé Abroad; the \r\nNovember 2004 adoption of a strategic framework to \r\nreduce poverty; the setting up of the Ministry of Youth \r\nand Employment, to deal specifically with promoting \r\nthe employment of young people; and the creation of a \r\nministry to address the question of technical and \r\nvocational training to meet the need of the labour \r\n A/61/PV.4\r\n \r\n11 06-52183 \r\n \r\nmarket for qualified persons. We have also developed \r\nthousands of hectares of arable land and introduced \r\nsmall-scale irrigation, which will make it possible to \r\nplant off-season crops. Lastly, on 13 and 14 July 2006, \r\nBurkina Faso held a national symposium on migration \r\nwhose main purpose was to develop a national policy \r\non migration. \r\n It would be illusory to believe that we can halt \r\nmigration in the current atmosphere of globalization. \r\nWe should instead focus on managing it well, for it \r\nrepresents not just something negative but also a factor \r\nin development for countries of origin, transit and \r\ndestination. Let us therefore seize the valuable \r\nopportunity provided by the High-level Dialogue on \r\nInternational Migration and Development to lay the \r\nfoundations for cooperation that will promote \r\nconcerted and responsible management of the \r\nphenomenon of migration. \r\n More than ever before, humanity is facing the \r\nmomentous challenge of managing migration. Burkina \r\nFaso firmly believes, however, that with common \r\ndetermination and genuine cooperation between States \r\nand regional and international organizations, international \r\nmigration will no longer be a scourge. Rather, it will be \r\nan important development factor for all our countries. \r\nWe should therefore welcome the support of the \r\nInternational Organization for Migration, which has \r\nhelped numerous African countries, including Burkina \r\nFaso, to better mobilize their diaspora populations to \r\ntake part in national development. My country has \r\ngreat hopes for the High-level Dialogue, which is to \r\nproduce relevant recommendations in the interests of \r\nour respective countries. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to Her \r\nExcellency Ms. Barbro Holmberg, Minister for \r\nMigration and Asylum Policy of Sweden. \r\n Ms. Holmberg (Sweden): Migration is a strong, \r\npositive force. When people travel, meet and exchange \r\nideas, societies can make leaps forward in \r\ndevelopment. That force contributes to the elimination \r\nof poverty in the world and to reaching the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. \r\n Migrants are not victims; they are made victims \r\nby human smugglers and traffickers. To reach the full \r\ndevelopment potential of migration, we must fight \r\nthose who treat people — men, women and children — \r\nas if they were goods on a market that can be sold to \r\nthe highest bidder. We must fight discrimination and \r\nexploitation. Let me highlight five important issues for \r\nthe Swedish Government. \r\n First, people living and working in a country, \r\nregardless of whether they are migrant workers or \r\ncitizens, should have the same rights and the same \r\nobligations. To achieve that, I think, we need regular \r\nmigration. By contrast, irregular migration leaves \r\npeople in our societies with limited rights and no \r\nsafety. Irregular migration also reveals the existence of \r\na dual labour market, one for citizens and those with \r\nwork permits and one for those without work permits. I \r\ntherefore believe we must increase opportunities for \r\nlegal migration. Only when a person legally resides in \r\na country can he or she be guaranteed the same rights \r\nas citizens of that country. That should include the \r\nright to family reunification, full access to the labour \r\nmarket and full access to the social security system. I \r\nthink that, if employers or we in the rich countries need \r\nlabour, we should be ready to pay for it. It is a question \r\nnot only of managing migration, but also of values and \r\nhuman rights. \r\n The second point I would like to make is that the \r\nroot causes of forced migration cannot be solved by \r\nmigration policy or border controls alone. We need \r\nprogressive development policies. We all know that \r\nfreer and fairer trade and agricultural policy have a far-\r\nreaching effect on development and poverty reduction \r\nin the world. It is every Government’s obligation to \r\ncreate a society where women and men can build a \r\nfuture. It is also an international responsibility to create \r\na more equal world. I am very proud that Sweden will \r\nthis year reach the target of devoting one per cent of its \r\ngross domestic product to development assistance. \r\n Thirdly, the right to asylum must be preserved. \r\nThose in need of international protection must have \r\naccess to a safe haven. Our borders have to stay open. \r\nWe must ensure that the measures taken to curb \r\nirregular migration do not prevent refugees from \r\ngaining the international protection that they are \r\nentitled to. \r\n Fourthly, it should be easier for people to move \r\nfrom one country to another and back. We know that \r\npeople bring knowledge. There is a brain gain. It is a \r\nhuge challenge to make sure that all countries benefit \r\nfrom that, and not only receiving countries. I think \r\ncircular migration is the key to its promotion. \r\n Finally, I believe that the High-level Dialogue is \r\nnot the end of a process; it is the beginning. We can no \r\nA/61/PV.4  \r\n \r\n06-52183 12 \r\n \r\nlonger address migration at the national and regional \r\nlevels alone. The tools we have at our disposal are not \r\nenough. I believe it to be crucial for States to have a \r\nforum where we can continue this process in a \r\nconstructive way, as well as on the global level. That \r\nforum should be intergovernmental, open-ended, \r\nconsultative and non-decision-making in character. \r\nSweden fully supports the idea put forward this \r\nmorning by the Secretary-General. I would also like to \r\nexpress my gratitude to the Government of Belgium for \r\nits offer to organize the first meeting of such a forum. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to Her \r\nExcellency Ms. Alicia Muñoz, Minister of Government \r\nof the Republic of Bolivia. \r\n Ms. Muñoz (Bolivia) (spoke in Spanish): At the \r\noutset, on behalf of the delegation of Bolivia, I would \r\nlike to extend my congratulations to you, Madam \r\nPresident, on your election to preside over this \r\nimportant debate. We are convinced that, under your \r\nwise leadership, we will succeed in our undertaking. \r\n It is estimated that 20 per cent of Bolivia’s \r\nestimated population of 10 million people — which is \r\nto say, 2 million Bolivians — reside outside the country. \r\n In recent decades, the end-points of migration \r\nflows have become more diverse as demand for labour \r\nhas changed in receiving countries. At the European \r\nParliament and in a meeting in Vienna in March of this \r\nyear, Bolivia’s President Evo Morales underscored that \r\nmigration is a structural component of the economic \r\ninequality between countries. \r\n As a country comprised primarily of indigenous \r\npeoples and headed by its first indigenous President, \r\nwho was freely and democratically elected, Bolivia \r\nsees a need to emphasize the effects of migration on \r\nindigenous and rural communities. Migration has a \r\nfundamental impact on the economic, social and \r\ncultural foundations of exchange and complementarity \r\nupon which the organizational structures of rural and \r\nnative economies are based. Entire communities have \r\nbeen depopulated throughout vast areas, and the \r\nmanagement of their natural resources, their \r\ndevelopment and the strengthening of their identities \r\nhave been deeply affected as a result. Migration has an \r\nindigenous face insofar as Bolivians are concerned. \r\n While it is true that foreign remittances have \r\nimportant economic benefits, they also have a negative \r\nimpact in that they undermine the structure of \r\nindigenous communities and villages. In addition, they \r\nentail a social cost since, owing to the liberalization of \r\nthe economy, which accelerates the onset of the market \r\neconomy, employment and exploitation are globalized, \r\nwhereas salaries, human rights and citizens’ rights are \r\nnot. Emigrants are treated as merchandise, and the \r\nfreedom to move or to transfer between countries is \r\ncriminalized. It is therefore important that we consider \r\nintercultural factors and take comprehensive human \r\nrights approaches. Hence the significance of this major \r\nevent organized by the United Nations. \r\n There can be no doubt about the right to \r\nemigrate, which has been enshrined in international \r\nconventions and treaties. We do question, however, the \r\nabsence of regulatory mechanisms and normative \r\nprocesses in the countries that receive cheap labour: for \r\nexample, the supply of cheap labour is higher when \r\nthere is greater demand for temporary or seasonal \r\nwork. \r\n We must also consider migration from the \r\nperspective of women. It is no longer appropriate in \r\ninternational forums to continue to analyse how the \r\ntreatment of and trafficking in human beings has a \r\ngreater impact on women; how sexual and labour \r\nexploitation is the second most lucrative business after \r\ndrug trafficking; and how criminal groups and \r\norganizations find legitimacy in receiving countries. \r\nWe therefore call for the adoption of legal measures to \r\nput an end to the demand that fosters the trade in \r\nhuman beings. \r\n Bolivia has legal instruments at its disposal to \r\ncombat crimes associated with human smuggling and \r\ntrafficking, an issue to which it is devoting its efforts. \r\nTo that end, we recently established an inter-ministerial \r\ncommission on migration in which migrants and \r\nrepresentatives from civil society organizations and \r\nindigenous peoples work alongside the Government. \r\n We therefore believe that it is important for \r\nreceiving countries to put in place effective \r\ncooperation mechanisms and to establish policies \r\nleading to the ratification of the International \r\nConvention on the Protection of the Rights of All \r\nMigrant Workers and Members of Their Families and \r\nother human rights treaties. \r\n In line with the indigenous principle of “in order \r\nto live well”, the Government of Bolivia is developing \r\neconomic policies aimed at bringing about broad \r\nstructural reforms that will re-energize production and \r\n A/61/PV.4\r\n \r\n13 06-52183 \r\n \r\nproduce employment. Bolivia is enormously rich in \r\nnatural resources and has plenty of land. It has an \r\nindigenous President who is prepared to regain the \r\ndignity and sovereignty of our people. We hope that \r\nour people will never again have to leave their homes, \r\nfamilies, villages, communities, language, dress and \r\neverything else that makes up our cultural identity. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Ng Eng Hen, Minister for Manpower of \r\nSingapore. \r\n Mr. Ng (Singapore): The forces of globalization \r\nhave in recent years escalated and forged closer \r\neconomic integration among countries. The same \r\nprocesses that started with the ease of movement of \r\ncapital and goods across borders have now also \r\nenabled labour mobility on a massive scale. As is now \r\nclearly evident, those migratory trends have both short- \r\nand long-term consequences for both the source and \r\nreceiving countries. The High-level Dialogue therefore \r\nprovides a timely opportunity to discuss international \r\nmigration and its impact on economic and social \r\ndevelopment. \r\n As a small city-State heavily dependent on global \r\ntrade, Singapore has always welcomed foreign \r\nmanpower to bolster our total workforce, which is now \r\nat about 2.4 million people. Today, more than one in \r\nfour workers in Singapore is a foreigner. Without the \r\ncontribution of foreign manpower, our economic \r\ngrowth would have been stymied by labour and skills \r\nshortages. We are a cosmopolitan city with a diverse \r\npopulation of people from different continents, who \r\nbring with them diverse ethnicities, cultures and \r\ncustoms. \r\n But because of our limited size and small \r\npopulation, we allow foreigners to work in Singapore \r\nin a regulated manner through a work pass and visa \r\nframework with established rules and criteria. While \r\nSingapore is supportive of greater openness and global \r\nintegration, like other countries we are also mindful of \r\nthe economic, social and security implications of \r\nirregular migration. We therefore have a tough stance \r\nagainst immigration offenders and those involved in \r\nhuman smuggling and trafficking. To keep irregular \r\nmigration at bay, we have a multipronged approach, \r\nwith measures ranging from the enactment of deterrent \r\nlaws to stringent enforcement. Penalties against illegal \r\ntrafficking or deployment of foreign workers are \r\npunitive. For example, human traffickers face jail \r\nterms of up to five years under our Immigration Act. \r\n Foreign nationals under our work pass system are \r\nprotected under Singapore’s laws and, in some \r\nsituations, accorded even greater protection than locals. \r\nFor example, we have enhanced our Penal Code to \r\nincrease by one-and-a-half times the penalties for acts \r\nof abuse against foreign domestic workers by their \r\nemployers. That is to send a clear signal that foreign \r\nworkers have benefits and rights under our law. \r\n To ensure that lower-skilled foreign workers \r\nunderstand and are able to assert their rights, we have \r\nstepped up promotional and outreach efforts to inform \r\nthem of the available channels of assistance. Various \r\nadministrative and assistance measures have also been \r\nimplemented to protect migrant workers from abuse, \r\nunfair practices and exploitation. For foreign domestic \r\nworkers in particular, we have introduced further \r\nprotection measures, which include compulsory \r\norientation courses for employers and workers, tighter \r\nregulation of recruitment agencies and strict \r\nenforcement against employment infringements and \r\nabuse. \r\n As migration transcends national borders, \r\ncollective efforts at the regional and global levels are \r\nrequired to reinforce national capacities for \r\nunderstanding and managing migration issues. Source \r\ncountries can do their part in establishing measures to \r\neducate migrant workers in their rights and \r\nresponsibilities and curb exploitative recruitment \r\npractices. Dialogue between source and receiving \r\ncountries can also strengthen cooperation and enhance \r\nthe regulation of migration. This United Nations \r\nDialogue can facilitate the benefits of labour migration \r\nby articulating a common framework that fosters \r\nunderstanding and places appropriate responsibilities \r\non source and receiving countries and other \r\nstakeholders. \r\n The President: I give the floor to His Excellency \r\nMr. Garba Lompo, President of the Human Rights \r\nCommission of Niger. \r\n Mr. Lompo (Niger) (spoke in French): First of \r\nall, I would like to convey warm congratulations to the \r\nGeneral Assembly from His Excellency Mr. Tandja \r\nMamadou, President of the Republic of Niger. Also, on \r\nbehalf of my delegation, and in my own name, I would \r\nlike to convey to you, Madam President, our sincere \r\ncongratulations on the skill with which you are \r\nA/61/PV.4  \r\n \r\n06-52183 14 \r\n \r\ndirecting this meeting. Finally, I wish to say how happy \r\nI am to be participating in this important meeting and \r\nto be adding the contribution of my country, Niger, to \r\nthe effort of the international community to find \r\nsolutions to the thorny problems of international \r\nmigration. \r\n In these early years of the twenty-first century, \r\nthe phenomenon of migration is increasingly assuming \r\ndisturbing proportions, due in particular to massive \r\ndisplacements of individuals with their often dramatic \r\nconsequences. To meet this economic, social, political \r\nand security challenge, migration must be better \r\ncoordinated through capacity-building in the relevant \r\nservices. One of the major problems besetting our \r\nStates in general, and Niger in particular, lies in the \r\ndrastic lack of means to combat this phenomenon more \r\neffectively. \r\n We should point out here that because of its \r\npivotal position between sub-Saharan and North \r\nAfrica, its porous borders and its limited means or \r\naction, Niger has to contend with substantial migratory \r\nflows. This phenomenon is very acute all along its \r\nborders where there is a convergence of drug \r\ntraffickers, armed bandits and, above all, clandestine \r\nmigrants from different places. The routes taken by \r\nthose migrants are so many in number that Niger has \r\npractically become an open door for tens of thousands \r\nof would-be immigrants. \r\n Mr. Baja (Philippines), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n The emergence and development of transit \r\nmigration promotes reflexes and behaviours which, if \r\nwe are not careful, give rise to the emergence of groups \r\nor networks prepared to exploit the misery of those \r\npoor migrants in their desperate quest for happiness. \r\nWhat we are seeing is, so to speak, the emergence of \r\nan uncivil society living by illicit means. This \r\nsituation, you will agree, can only lead to a vicious \r\ncircle of tragedies inherent in uncontrolled migrations, \r\nincluding trafficking in human beings. Buffeted by \r\npoverty, driven by the illusion of finding better job \r\nprospects, migrants often become easy prey for \r\ncriminal groups that specialize in human trafficking. \r\n The question of persons in transit then forms part \r\nof an even more vast and far more worrisome problem. \r\nIt is very difficult to know whether an individual is the \r\nvictim of trafficking when he or she is in transit. Thus, \r\ntransit migration must be approached within the \r\nbroader context of the protection of fundamental rights \r\nand as an integral part of efforts to combat trafficking, \r\nboth nationally and internationally. \r\n The issue of transit migration needs to be \r\nanalysed in order to find lasting solutions at the human, \r\neconomic and security levels. It raises the importance \r\nof developing and implementing mechanisms based on \r\nthe responsibility of States, whether the country of \r\norigin, the country of destination or the transit country. \r\n Niger, which is a country of transit migration, is \r\naware of the role that falls to it in joint action to ensure \r\nrespect for and protection of the rights of migrants and \r\nto prevent and combat clandestine immigration and \r\ntrafficking in human beings. In other words, Niger will \r\ndeal with migration with all the requisite attention and \r\nresolve in the broader framework of subregional, \r\nregional and international cooperation. \r\n In that regard, and very concretely, Niger would \r\nsuggest the establishment of an efficient mechanism to \r\ncombat clandestine immigration and trafficking in \r\nhuman beings. Such a mechanism would involve \r\nimplementing on the ground a policy of respecting and \r\nprotecting the rights of migrant workers and combating \r\nhuman trafficking. \r\n There can be no guarantee that the rights of all \r\nmigrant workers will be durably respected and \r\nprotected unless we design and implement bold \r\npolicies within bilateral and multilateral cooperative \r\nframeworks. It is in that way — and it is in that way \r\nalone — that we shall be able together to find the \r\nmeans to effectively and sustainably combat the \r\nphenomenon of clandestine immigration. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Hamid Awaluddin, Minister for \r\nLaw and Human Rights of Indonesia. \r\n Mr. Awaluddin (Indonesia): Allow me, on behalf \r\nof the Indonesian delegation, to congratulate Her \r\nExcellency Ms. Al-Khalifa on her election as the sixty-\r\nfirst President of the General Assembly. The \r\nIndonesian delegation will continue to do its utmost to \r\nsupport her and promote fruitful discussions at the \r\nsixty-first session of the General Assembly on this \r\nimportant issue. \r\n We also wish to thank the Secretary-General for \r\nfacilitating the necessary preparations for this \r\nDialogue, and for the submission of his comprehensive \r\n A/61/PV.4\r\n \r\n15 06-52183 \r\n \r\nreport entitled “International migration and \r\ndevelopment” (A/60/871). \r\n Indonesia as a sending, receiving and transit \r\ncountry welcomes today’s historic Dialogue. We \r\nsincerely hope that this Dialogue will bring us closer to \r\nbetter coherence, coordination and cooperation on \r\nmigration. Migration issues should not divide but unite \r\nus. In the view of my delegation, that is the \r\nsignificance of this High-level Dialogue. \r\n In this context, we are of the view that there is a \r\nneed to understand in greater detail the impacts and the \r\nmultidimensional nature of migration. That would \r\nrequire the development of a comprehensive global \r\nresearch and database system. We can subscribe to the \r\nproposal of establishing a global forum at the United \r\nNations, so long as it involves all Member States, \r\ncomplements the regional efforts of Governments \r\nsupported by relevant international organizations, such \r\nas the International Organization for Migration (IOM), \r\nand takes into consideration the inputs of civil society, the \r\nbusiness sector and non-governmental organizations. \r\n The High-level Dialogue must promote the \r\nformulation of a common and global set of priorities in \r\nview of the efforts to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals by 2015 and to ensure the effective \r\ncoordination of Government efforts at the national, \r\nregional and international levels, with the support of \r\nrelevant intergovernmental and non-governmental \r\norganizations. \r\n Our efforts to ensure the protection of human \r\ndignity often are so easily overshadowed not only by \r\neconomic and financial considerations, but also by acts \r\nof prejudice and ignorance. Protecting human dignity \r\nshould not be restricted by shortsighted concerns \r\nperceived at the borders. Migrants with the hope of a \r\nbetter life abroad should not have to become prey to \r\nclandestine criminal groups. \r\n For Indonesia, ensuring the orderly flow and \r\nprotection of migrant workers continues to be a top \r\npriority. We have begun stepping up national \r\ncoordination efforts not only with relevant ministries, \r\nbut also with civil society, non-governmental \r\norganizations and the business sector. Having adopted \r\nLegislation 39/2004 on the protection and placement of \r\nIndonesian migrant workers, we are in the process of \r\nestablishing a national body, under the direct \r\nsupervision of the President, for the purpose of better \r\nmanaging the flow of Indonesian migrants through an \r\ninstitutional mechanism. We are currently in the final \r\nstages of adopting new legislation that combats \r\ntrafficking in persons. \r\n Indonesia endorses migration policies that \r\nempower migrants. Such policies should enable them \r\nto capitalize on entrepreneurship programmes through \r\nmicrofinance and simultaneously to enhance the role of \r\ndiasporas. We also subscribe to the importance of \r\ntemporary and circulatory migration programmes with \r\na view to enhancing the benefit of international \r\nmigration not only for the host and origin countries, \r\nbut also and particularly for migrants and their \r\nfamilies. In today’s debate on international migration, \r\nwe have been made aware of its apparent advantages, \r\nincluding migrant remittances, which have contributed, \r\namong other things, to the alleviation of poverty and \r\nhunger. \r\n Bilaterally, the Indonesian Government has \r\nestablished agreements not only with receiving \r\ncountries, but also among migrant sending countries. \r\nIndonesia has been proactive in approaching sending \r\ncountries to better protect our migrants abroad. \r\n At the regional level, Indonesia has in fact \r\nconducted and collaborated actively in several regional \r\nforums, not only in the Association of South-East \r\nAsian Nations, but with other countries in Asia and the \r\nPacific. Through informal regional consultative \r\nprocesses, such as the Colombo Process and the Bali \r\nProcess on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons \r\nand Related Transnational Crime, Indonesia has taken \r\nthe concept of dialogue and coordination to new levels \r\nof common understanding and action-oriented \r\nactivities. \r\n To that end, Indonesia and Australia, as co-chairs \r\nof the Bali Process, are proud to submit contributions \r\nto the High-level Dialogue and future negotiations. Just \r\nyesterday, a side event was organized by the co-chairs \r\nto the participants of this Dialogue to share the \r\nexperiences of the Bali Process and on how to enhance \r\ncooperation with other processes in the future. \r\n Much has been attained, and what remains are \r\nhopes for some practical concrete actions that will pave \r\nthe way for future cooperation, coordination and \r\ncollaboration among all Governments on the issue of \r\ninternational migration for development for the simple \r\npurpose of maintaining human dignity and ensuring the \r\nwelfare of our transnational migrants and their \r\nfamilies. The President of the General Assembly may \r\nA/61/PV.4  \r\n \r\n06-52183 16 \r\n \r\nrest assured that Indonesia will continue to lend her its \r\nsupport on this noble cause. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHer Excellency Mrs. Emilia Maslarova, Minister of \r\nLabour and Social Policy of Bulgaria. \r\n Mrs. Maslarova (Bulgaria) (spoke in Russian): \r\nBulgaria welcomes the convening of the High-level \r\nDialogue on International Migration and Development \r\nas a necessary and timely step. \r\n Bulgaria fully supports the position of the \r\nEuropean Union delegation expressed at this forum. \r\nWe share the opinion that migration can contribute to \r\nachieving a higher level of economic and social \r\ndevelopment. The Dialogue provides an opportunity to \r\nincorporate the international migration issue into the \r\nagenda for development within the framework of the \r\nMillennium Declaration. \r\n It is important that our discussion continue after \r\nthe High-level Dialogue has ended. It will provide us \r\nall with a beneficial exchange of experience. We feel \r\nthat the duplication of structures and activities should \r\nbe avoided. It would be useful to direct efforts towards \r\nbetter coordination between the existing structures and \r\nforums of the United Nations and the other \r\ninternational organizations working in that field. \r\n As an external border country of the European \r\nUnion from January 2007 on, Bulgaria is very \r\ninterested in the creation of instruments for the \r\nintegrated management of migration processes. In that \r\nregard, we are ready to cooperate at all levels in \r\ncompliance with the common European Union policy \r\nand practice. \r\n From the viewpoint of its national experience, \r\nBulgaria attaches great importance to the regional \r\napproach to cooperation in the field of migration and \r\ndevelopment. As a very good example in that regard, \r\nwe can point to the Rabat process. \r\n The issue of statistics is an important element of \r\nnational migration policies. To that end, we have \r\nconducted a sociological study on emigration attitudes \r\namong the adult population in Bulgaria. The High-level \r\nDialogue is the first international forum at which we \r\nare presenting preliminary data provided by the \r\nresearch of Gallup International in August 2006. The \r\nstudy has been distributed to members of the \r\nAssembly. The results show that the number of citizens \r\nwilling to emigrate for the long term has fallen by half \r\nto approximately 15,000-16,000. During the first year \r\nof Bulgaria’s European Union membership, fewer than \r\n4,000 people intend to seek work in European Union \r\nmember States. \r\n Where do Bulgarians want to work? First on their \r\nlist of preferences is Spain, followed by Germany, the \r\nUnited States of America, Greece, Great Britain, and \r\nCanada. A norm for the migration behaviour of \r\nBulgarian citizens is coming into focus and is \r\ncomparable to that of the average European Union \r\ncitizen. That fact is a result of the stable economy and \r\nthe low unemployment rate in our country, currently at \r\n8.76 per cent. \r\n To conclude, let me emphasize once again that \r\nBulgaria fully supports positive migration that can \r\ncontribute to the full achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, as formulated in the Millennium \r\nDeclaration. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Dato’ Seri Mohd Radzi Sheikh Ahmad, \r\nMinister of Home Affairs of Malaysia. \r\n Mr. Mohd Radzi (Malaysia): The convening of \r\nthis meeting is both important and timely, given the \r\nincreasing prominence that the issue of migration and \r\ndevelopment will play in the coming years, as well as \r\nthe increasing complexity of that phenomenon. \r\n As a country that is strategically located in the \r\nSouth-East Asian region and which has enjoyed \r\nsustained economic growth, Malaysia is all too aware \r\nof the role that migration can play in the development \r\nprocess and the difficulties that it poses. For Malaysia, \r\nthe key challenge is to balance the need to maximize \r\nthe economic benefits derived from migration and the \r\ndesire to protect the interests of all concerned. We \r\nbelieve that the key to achieving that is to ensure the \r\norderly management of migrant flows. In that regard, \r\nMalaysia’s foreign worker policy is premised on the \r\nneed to manage migration in cooperation with source \r\ncountries in order to achieve mutual benefits. \r\n As part of those efforts, the Malaysian \r\nGovernment has instituted the following measures. \r\nFirst, we have signed bilateral memorandums of \r\nunderstanding with seven source countries — Sri \r\nLanka, the People’s Republic of China, Thailand, \r\nPakistan, Bangladesh, Vietnam and Indonesia — on the \r\nrecruitment of foreign labour. Secondly, we are \r\npromoting international cooperation, including at the \r\n A/61/PV.4\r\n \r\n17 06-52183 \r\n \r\nregional level; in the context of the Association of \r\nSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), there is active \r\ncooperation involving the foreign-workers-related \r\nagencies of ASEAN members. Thirdly, we are \r\nimproving monitoring and supervising systems, as well \r\nas enforcement and preventive measures in accordance \r\nwith the relevant laws of Malaysia. Finally, Malaysia \r\nconducted two amnesty exercises in 2002 and 2004, \r\nwhen illegal immigrants were repatriated to their home \r\ncountries at the Malaysian Government’s expense. \r\n In ensuring the effectiveness of measures to \r\nregulate the orderly flow of migration, the legitimate \r\nconcerns of receiving and sending countries alike must \r\nbe reflected. In the case of Malaysia, the increasing \r\nnumbers of migrant workers have given rise to cases of \r\nhighly communicable diseases, such as hepatitis B, \r\ntuberculosis and leprosy, all of which were previously \r\nunder control or eradicated altogether. At the same \r\ntime, the number of crimes committed by migrants has \r\nincreased three-fold, rising from 1,333 in 1992 to 3,113 \r\nin 2002. We are concerned that the statistics show that \r\nup to 40 per cent of crimes committed by migrants \r\nwere violent ones. \r\n Malaysia has taken various preventive measures \r\nto curb illegal migration, including through the \r\nintroduction of a biometric system. Using that system, \r\nthe details of outgoing illegal immigrants, as well as of \r\nnew incoming legal foreign workers, are recorded in \r\nthe Immigration Department’s database as reference \r\nagainst illegal entries and other immigration offences. \r\nSuch information is vital to ensuring that the welfare of \r\nforeign workers in the country are safeguarded, as well \r\nas to assisting authorities against criminal and terrorist \r\nactivities carried out by migrants. \r\n In the same vein, the issue of remittances is a \r\ncrucial one for migrants. In that connection, I wish to \r\nemphasize that Malaysia imposes no restriction on \r\nworkers’ remitting money back home. In 2002, 1.2 \r\nmillion foreign workers remitted $640 million. In \r\n2005, 1.8 million foreign workers remitted $768 \r\nmillion. As to the human rights of migrants, despite \r\nisolated cases of abuse, foreign workers enjoy full \r\nprotection of their human rights under Malaysian law. \r\n Like other countries, Malaysia is concerned over \r\nthe issue of trafficking in persons. While we have \r\nsufficient laws to deal with that problem and are also in \r\nthe process of enacting specific legislation to address \r\nit, we note that two major difficulties exist. One is the \r\ndifficulty of distinguishing between genuine victims \r\nand those who knowingly allow themselves to be \r\ntrafficked for economic gain. The second is the lack of \r\nresources for destination countries to repatriate the \r\nvictims on a voluntary basis. \r\n I would like to conclude by touching on the issue \r\nof the follow-up to the High-level Dialogue. As a firm \r\nbeliever in the multilateral process, we believe that the \r\nUnited Nations is the best forum for discussing global \r\nissues, which include international migration and \r\ndevelopment. At the same time, clarity is required in \r\nthe follow-up process itself so that it will not be \r\nduplicative and ineffective. We therefore have an open \r\nmind on that issue and look forward to playing a \r\nconstructive role in the ensuing discussions. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao, \r\nMinister of the Interior of Pakistan. \r\n Mr. Khan Sherpao (Pakistan): It gives me great \r\npleasure to be here today representing Pakistan at a \r\nforum in which issues of tremendous importance are \r\nbeing addressed. We have come together looking for \r\ninnovative solutions and ideas to better manage \r\nmigration and address the needs of our peoples and our \r\ncountries. \r\nWe would like to place on record Pakistan’s deep \r\nappreciation and admiration of the initiative taken by \r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan. \r\n Pakistan attaches great importance to the High-\r\nlevel Dialogue on International Migration and \r\nDevelopment. It provides a unique opportunity to the \r\ninternational community to build common approaches \r\nto promoting coherence between migration and \r\ndevelopment and to identify ways to increase the \r\ndevelopment benefits of migration and reduce its \r\nnegative impact. \r\n We wish to align ourselves with the statement \r\nmade by the Minister of Home Affairs of South Africa \r\non behalf of the Group of 77 and China. \r\n Migration in an interdependent world has benefits \r\nfor sending and receiving countries alike. That requires \r\ncooperation among countries at the bilateral, regional \r\nand global levels to address the issues of immediate \r\nconcern. The unprecedented level of attendance at this \r\nDialogue and the focus and attention it has generated \r\non migration issues must be used to lay the foundation \r\nA/61/PV.4  \r\n \r\n06-52183 18 \r\n \r\nfor a sustained dialogue and enhanced international \r\ncooperation on migration and development. \r\n While recognizing the potential of migration to \r\ncontribute to world development, it is important also to \r\nrecognize the need to establish adequate and \r\ntransparent mechanisms to channel migration in a safe, \r\nlegal, humane and orderly manner in order to combat \r\nirregular migration and prevent enabling conditions for \r\norganized crime and the exploitation of people. \r\n The protection of the rights of migrants and \r\nvictims of trafficking is of great concern to us. The \r\nGovernment of Pakistan will work with other countries \r\nto ensure the well-being and dignity of its migrants and \r\nto insist on the dignified return of its nationals, where \r\nrequired. We attach great importance to the \r\nimplementation of existing United Nations and \r\nInternational Labour Organization conventions on the \r\nprotection of migrant workers. \r\n Interestingly, the preparatory process for the \r\nHigh-level Dialogue has already made a significant \r\ncontribution by moving the migration and development \r\ndebate to a higher plane. In Pakistan, we take a holistic \r\nview of the whole issue when formulating our \r\nmigration policy. The ongoing consultative process \r\ninvolves representatives of Government, civil society \r\nand international organizations. A two-day inter-\r\nministerial conference was organized on 29 and \r\n30 August 2006, in collaboration with the International \r\nOrganization for Migration; it resulted in inputs from \r\nall stakeholders for an integrated and cohesive \r\nresponse from Pakistan at this important Dialogue on \r\nmigration and development. \r\n Pakistan is happy to see international migration \r\nissues move up on the global agenda. We strongly \r\nfavour more intense international cooperation and \r\ncollaboration on international migration to enhance its \r\ndevelopment impact. Our task, through this Dialogue, \r\nis to develop a coherent approach to effectively deal \r\nwith the challenges and opportunities associated with \r\nthe large movement of migrants across national \r\nfrontiers and between continents, and to optimize the \r\ndevelopment impact of this phenomenon. Pakistan \r\nbelieves that without the requisite machinery and \r\ninstitutional support, it will be difficult to advance the \r\nobjective of generating and sustaining the much-\r\nneeded coherence and coordination on migration \r\nissues. We would therefore favour building on existing \r\narrangements to further the global dialogue on \r\nmigration and development. In our view, one way of \r\ndoing that would be to allow the Global Migration \r\nGroup to meet inter-governmentally under the auspices \r\nof the Economic and Social Council. \r\n We are here today with a renewed commitment to \r\ncontinue to work together with the rest of the \r\nmembership to strengthen the process in order to \r\nutilize migration for the betterment of our peoples. Let \r\nus remember today that in our united efforts we must \r\nbear in mind that, ultimately, we want the best for our \r\nfellow human beings and for our countries. That can be \r\nachieved only if we work together positively, \r\nrecognizing the importance of migration in our lives \r\nand in our world. Let us commit ourselves to growth \r\nand betterment, not only for ourselves but for each \r\nother. I am sure that together we can make a great \r\ndifference. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ali S. J. Errishi, Secretary of \r\nExpatriate, Immigrant and Refugee Affairs of the \r\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya. \r\n Mr. Errishi (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya): It gives \r\nme great pleasure to congratulate Ambassador \r\nAl-Khalifa on her election as President of the sixty-\r\nfirst session of the General Assembly. I am also \r\ndelighted that an Arab woman holds that high office in \r\nthe service of peace, security and prosperity. We are \r\nfully confident that she has the wisdom and experience \r\nto guide us through this Dialogue, which seeks to make \r\nthe role of migration in development even stronger. I \r\nwould also like to take this opportunity to express our \r\nsupport for the statement that the Minister of Home \r\nAffairs of South Africa has delivered on behalf of the \r\nGroup of 77 and China. \r\n The fact we are holding this Dialogue at such a \r\nhigh level reflects the extent to which the international \r\ncommunity recognizes the important role that \r\nmigration plays in international relations. Throughout \r\nhistory, migration has helped to create and sustain \r\nfruitful contacts among various peoples and cultures. \r\nThere is no doubt that migration has contributed to the \r\nfree commerce of ideas and experiences, and there is \r\nno doubt that it has been one of the main engines of \r\nmaterial and intellectual progress in our world. \r\n However, migration into sovereign spaces cannot \r\nbe constructive unless the cultural, legal and political \r\nrealities which define those sovereign spaces are taken \r\ninto account. Ignoring that fact will have nothing but \r\n A/61/PV.4\r\n \r\n19 06-52183 \r\n \r\nnegative consequences on the important role that \r\nmigration plays in bringing peoples of the world closer \r\ntogether. While migration contributes to the increase in \r\nthe rates of intellectual and economic growth of many \r\ncountries, it can also at times be a serious challenge to \r\nother countries. It is therefore imperative that we agree \r\non realistic mechanisms that recognize the right of \r\nsovereign States to protect their borders and that, at the \r\nsame time, respect the human rights of immigrants. \r\n The cost of chaotic, illegal migration is much \r\ngreater than its benefits. It may even at times threaten \r\nthe national security of certain countries. For when the \r\nnumber of illegal immigrants reaches a certain limit, \r\nthe citizens of the country in question begin to feel that \r\ntheir economic, social and cultural interests are at risk. \r\nIn that event, political and social tensions begin to \r\nemerge, which in turn may lead to instability and civil \r\nunrest. Also, when the market of a given country \r\ncannot absorb large numbers of illegal immigrants and, \r\nthus provide them with jobs, some of those immigrants \r\ntend to engage in illicit economic activities such as \r\ndrug trafficking, organized crime, theft and trafficking \r\nin human beings. \r\n It is for those reasons that my country has \r\ncommitted itself to the view that the problem of illegal \r\nimmigration cannot be solved without dealing with its \r\nroot causes. We have consistently called on the \r\ninternational community to live up to its \r\nresponsibilities and to contribute to the economic \r\ndevelopment of the countries from which immigrants \r\nflow. \r\n The flow of illegal immigrants can only come to \r\nan end through sustainable development and long-term \r\ninvestment, which will create jobs that offer decent \r\nwages. It is in the pursuit of that plan that my country \r\nbelieves that it is important to have an African-\r\nEuropean summit to discuss and find sustainable \r\nsolutions to the problem of illegal immigration — \r\nsolutions that would protect the rights, security and \r\ndignity of legal immigrants while at the same time \r\ncreating conditions which will save millions of people \r\nfrom subjecting themselves to the dangers and \r\nindignities of illegal migration. Towards that end, I am \r\nhappy to announce that my country is working to \r\norganize a meeting for African and European ministers \r\nto discuss migration and development. \r\n I would also like to mention that, as a part of its \r\ncommitment to the economic integration of the \r\ncountries in the African Union, Libya has invested in \r\nagricultural and industrial projects in a number of \r\nAfrican countries. My country has also contributed to \r\nthe funding of a number of development projects in \r\ncooperation with the Food and Agriculture \r\nOrganization of the United Nations. For example, my \r\ncountry has invested in five projects in some of the \r\ncountries in the Sahel and Sahara grouping. Studies are \r\nalso under way to expand that programme to include \r\nseven other African countries. \r\n In addition to that, in December of 2005 my \r\ncountry announced the establishment of the Qadhafi \r\nProject for African Youth, Children and Women, in \r\ncooperation with the appropriate international \r\norganizations. The aim of that project is to help end \r\npoverty, hunger and disease, to spread education and to \r\ntrain African women while helping to protect their \r\nrights. \r\n Finally, I would like to say that we agree with \r\nwhat the Secretary-General states in his report \r\n(A/60/871), that immigration is not a process in which \r\none party obtains a comparative advantage at the \r\nexpense of other parties. Indeed, in my country there \r\nare more than a million immigrants who work in \r\nvarious sectors of our economy and make more than $2 \r\nbillion a year, a good part of which goes back to their \r\nfamilies in their countries of origin. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency The Honourable Doug Shane Gibson, \r\nMinister of Immigration, Labour and Training of the \r\nCommonwealth of the Bahamas. \r\n Mr. Gibson (Bahamas): The Commonwealth of \r\nthe Bahamas welcomes the holding of this High-level \r\nDialogue on International Migration and Development, \r\nwhich brings international migration in all its many \r\nfacets to the table for discussion and dialogue among \r\nMember States. The Bahamas would like to align itself \r\nwith statements made by the Minister of Home Affairs \r\nSouth Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. \r\n The Bahamas fully supports the establishment of \r\na better way to match the supply with the demand for \r\nmigration in a safe, legal, humane and orderly way, in \r\norder to maximize the societal and human development \r\npotential of global labour mobility with the \r\ndevelopment of public and private stakeholders. The \r\nCommonwealth of the Bahamas is an archipelagic \r\nnation with 700 islands and more than 2,000 limestone-\r\nformed islets and cays. Our southernmost island, \r\nA/61/PV.4  \r\n \r\n06-52183 20 \r\n \r\nInagua, is 60 miles north-east of Cuba, while Bimini is \r\nonly 50 miles south-east of Florida. The territorial \r\nwaters of the Bahamas are some 100,000 square miles \r\nand its land mass is 5,400 square miles. Thirty of our \r\nislands are inhabited, and we have a total population of \r\napproximately 308,000, almost two thirds of whose \r\nmembers reside in our capital, New Providence. \r\n The preceding remarks were designed not only to \r\nsensitize Member States as to how small we are in size \r\nand population, but to also make them aware of how \r\nvulnerable we are in terms of policing our vast borders. \r\n The Bahamas has an economy which is based \r\nprincipally on tourism and financial services, with very \r\nsmall inputs from the agricultural and industrial \r\nsectors. We welcome more than 5 million visitors \r\nannually, and the financial sector is mainly composed \r\nof foreign banks. It is evident, therefore, that migration \r\nhas positively impacted the Bahamas in many respects. \r\n However, as noted in the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral (A/60/871), there are many challenges in \r\nmanaging migration, including the prevention of \r\nirregular or unauthorized migration. In this connection, \r\nthe negative side of migration for the Bahamas is that \r\nfor the past 60 years we have been plagued with illegal \r\nmigration. In addition to the normal regularization of \r\nnon-citizens for visits, business, employment, family, \r\neducation, training, asylum, et cetera, a large number \r\nenter by simply running their vessels aground in \r\nshallow waters and taking up residence with the \r\nassistance of non-citizens, with or without status, who \r\nare already in the country. \r\n Illegal immigrants then become a serious burden \r\non the social and educational services of the country \r\nbecause their numbers are not taken into account when \r\nwe are planning for new schools and health services. \r\nThe end result is that institutions are not able to \r\nadequately accommodate the citizens and legal \r\nresidents for whom they were built. Illegal immigrants \r\nalso become a serious national security issue because \r\nsome of those who enter our country are either \r\nconvicted criminals or fugitives from justice. \r\n For these and many other reasons, it is necessary \r\nfor States to implement comprehensive migration \r\npolicies and have constant dialogue with neighbouring \r\nStates in order to establish workable solutions for \r\nmatters of mutual concern that affect them. \r\n Opportunities in our country have provided a \r\ncomfortable standard of living for citizens and legal \r\nmigrants. However, no country can feel totally safe \r\nwhen there are significant numbers of strangers within \r\nits borders who are also reaping benefits designed only \r\nfor its taxpaying public. In that respect, irregular \r\nmigration has for many years negatively impacted the \r\nBahamas. \r\n During our brief stay in New York, we will begin \r\na dialogue with relevant States with a view to coming \r\nup with workable solutions to these most vexing \r\nproblems. We would like to again welcome this forum \r\nto allow Member States to discuss matters that concern \r\nus all. \r\n I thank members for their attention; it is my \r\nsincere hope that we can all work together to come up \r\nwith workable solutions to ease the burden of illegal \r\nmigration on receiving States. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Eric Solheim, Minister of \r\nInternational Development of Norway. \r\n Mr. Solheim (Norway): Hardly any force is \r\nchanging the world as rapidly as the force of migration. \r\nAllow me to speak on a personal note for a little while. \r\nWhen I was a young boy in Norway, not so many \r\ncenturies ago, and Norway was an all-white — or \r\nmaybe I should say all-pink — society and an all-\r\nChristian society, I myself and my comrades would \r\nvery gladly have paid an entrance fee to see most of the \r\npeople in this Hall today. I had hardly ever seen anyone \r\nfrom Sri Lanka, my second homeland, or anyone from \r\nAfrica. Now my children are running around in exactly \r\nthe same streets, and their best friends come from \r\nChina, Iran, Pakistan and Turkey. What a change. And \r\nof course similar changes are going on all over the \r\nglobe. \r\n The contribution of this meeting here in New \r\nYork today is to put migration at the top of the global \r\nagenda, where it should stay, as one of the main topics \r\nof the world today. Some say that we should not \r\ndiscuss this subject at the United Nations. Others reply, \r\n“What else should we discuss at the United Nations, if \r\nwe should not discuss the main issues of the day?”, or \r\n“If we should not discuss it at the United Nations, then \r\nwhere else should we discuss the matter of immigration \r\nand emigration?” \r\n A/61/PV.4\r\n \r\n21 06-52183 \r\n \r\n I think it is also absolutely pertinent that \r\nmigration is being discussed in the city of New York, \r\nwhich, for Norwegians, was the first place they met a \r\nforeign country when we had our huge wave of \r\nmigration 75 or 100 years back. Today, there are as \r\nmany Norwegians or people of Norwegian origin in the \r\nUnited States as there are in our own country. And \r\nwhere they put their feet on foreign soil was right here \r\nin New York, many of them on Ellis Island. So New \r\nYork is the right place to start the international debate \r\non migration. \r\n I would also thank the Secretary-General for the \r\nway he has put migration on the international agenda, \r\nwhich is with a sense of optimism. We all know there \r\nare problems. There are the problems of trafficking, \r\nabuse and brain drain; there are so many problems \r\nrelated to migration. But at its core, it is a positive \r\ndevelopment, making life better for so many people \r\nthat most migrants are winners in today’s world of \r\nglobalization. Basically, nearly all aspects of migration \r\nare positive. So we should face this debate with \r\noptimism, not as an area mainly characterized by \r\nproblems. It is in that spirit that we approaching the \r\nissue today, which, from our perspective, is very good. \r\n I will be honest: the debate on migration in \r\nNorway, as a new country receiving migrants, has for \r\nthe past two decades basically been a debate on how to \r\nintegrate people. That is an important debate and a \r\ndebate that will continue. But we have hardly faced the \r\nother debate, which is the link between migration and \r\ndevelopment. That is the new debate which has been \r\nput on the international agenda. The very close \r\nrelationship between migration and development has \r\nbeen an eye-opener for us. We want to approach this \r\nissue with a twofold approach. \r\n First, in a migrant’s country of origin, there \r\nshould be a choice. People should have a choice \r\nbetween migrating and staying, which means that \r\nwhatever can be done to assist in the process of \r\ndevelopment should be done. Norway is approaching \r\nthe target of directing 1 per cent of our gross national \r\nproduct towards development aid, and we are close to \r\nreaching it. The Swedes may be ahead of us, but we \r\nwant to reach that aim in the very near future — that is \r\npart of our contribution to development. That is one \r\nchoice. \r\n There are others. When people come to the \r\nrecipient country, they should have rights. They should \r\nhave rights with regard to the labour market and human \r\nrights, and they should be offered decent work. \r\nTherefore, choice and rights would be our approach to \r\nthe new debate on how to link development and \r\nmigration. \r\n We also note that there should be a particular \r\nemphasis on the matter of women and children. We \r\ntend to believe that migrants are men, while the United \r\nNations Population Fund and others remind us firmly \r\nthat half of the migrants are women. Women tend also \r\nto be more easily abused in the process of migration. \r\nThus, the issues related to women and children should \r\nbe in the forefront of the migration debate. \r\n When approaching migration issues we should be \r\npractical, as opposed to discussing theories \r\nsurrounding migration. The practical debate that we \r\nwill engage in with our immigrant communities \r\nconcerns the issue of remittances; what can the \r\nGovernments of the international system do to put \r\npressure on the banking system to introduce more \r\ncompetition in order to reduce the cost of remittances? \r\nIt is a shame that some people are paying 20 per cent \r\nof the amount they want to send back to their relatives, \r\nto the people transferring the money. Those transfer \r\ncosts should be reduced and we should be part of that \r\nprocess. \r\n Finally, looking forward, migration must have its \r\nplace on the global agenda. We fully support the global \r\nforum, and we pay tribute to the Government of \r\nBelgium for being ready to hold future events in that \r\nregard. We will be able to listen to all of the advice \r\nfrom the International Organization for Migration and \r\nthe International Labour Organization, and from \r\nGovernments which have much more experience than \r\nNorway in this field. But the entire process has been an \r\neye-opener to us. We are at the beginning of the \r\nprocess, not at the end. I would end by paraphrasing a \r\nwell-known phrase of Churchill, from the Second \r\nWorld War, which I think also describes where we \r\nstand in the debate on migration today: this is not the \r\nend, it is not even the beginning of the end; but what \r\nyou are seeing here today may be the end of the \r\nbeginning of the debate on migration. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Athauda Seneviratne, Minister of \r\nLabour and Foreign Employment of Sri Lanka. \r\n Mr. Seneviratne (Sri Lanka): Let me begin by \r\nconveying the greetings of the President and the people \r\nA/61/PV.4  \r\n \r\n06-52183 22 \r\n \r\nof Sri Lanka to all the participants attending the High-\r\nlevel Dialogue. The High-level Dialogue on \r\nInternational Migration and Development will help us \r\nto identify appropriate ways and means to maximize \r\nthe development benefits arising out of migration \r\nphenomena. \r\n We are pleased that international migration has \r\ncome to the top of the global agenda this year, and it is \r\nour expectation that this trend will continue so that we \r\ncan address all aspects of the issue in a more \r\ncomprehensive manner. We are pleased that there is an \r\nemerging global consensus that labour migration is a \r\npositive force for development. \r\n As rightly highlighted in the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport, there is a convergence of views that migration \r\nis a development-friendly phenomenon, benefiting both \r\ncountries of origin and destination. Remittances to \r\ndeveloping countries are now more than three times the \r\nvolume of overseas aid, and close behind the level of \r\nglobal foreign direct investment. The overseas diaspora \r\nalso represents a development resource for the home \r\ncountry for promoting investments, transfer of skills \r\nand stimulating exports for development. \r\n We are also concerned that the focus of the \r\nmeeting and the current international emphasis on \r\nissues connected to migration has not placed adequate \r\nemphasis on the need for a rights-based approach to \r\ninternational migration. We have also failed to define \r\nclearly the linkages between economic growth and \r\nsustainable development and migration, and more work \r\nis needed in this regard. \r\n There are a number of other matters for \r\nconsideration. For example, policies in developed \r\ncountries continue to favour the admission of skilled \r\nworkers rather than low-skilled workers. Developing \r\ncountries can ill afford such a brain drain, as the loss of \r\ntrained manpower skills affects the level and quality of \r\nservices needed in education and health care in the \r\ncountry of origin. At the same time, the protection and \r\ntreatment of workers is an issue of concern. There are \r\ncountless stories of victims of trafficking, female \r\ndomestic workers in forced labour situations, non-\r\npayment of wages, poor conditions of work and \r\ngrowing racism and discrimination. Women migrant \r\nworkers are particularly vulnerable, and it must not be \r\nforgotten that they represent about half of the global \r\nmigrant workforce. In some diaspora communities we \r\nhave also observed the emergence of illegal activities \r\nand extortion of the migrants for purposes of funding \r\ninsurgent movements and terrorism in their home \r\ncountries. \r\n Clearly, there is a need for increased international \r\ncooperation. There is already a robust body of key \r\nUnited Nations and international conventions, which \r\nspell out a normative framework for principles and \r\ngood practices in respect of labour migration. In that \r\nregard, we call upon all States to ratify, in particular, \r\nthe International Convention on the Protection of the \r\nRights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their \r\nFamilies (1990). The ILO Multilateral Framework on \r\nLabour Migration can also serve as a politically \r\nbinding and valuable guide. In addition, in order to \r\ncurb illegal migration, opportunities must be provided \r\nfor legal migration. \r\n If we are to promote international migration as an \r\ninstrument of global development, we also need the \r\nparticipation of all stakeholders — Governments, \r\nsocial partners, civil society and migrants \r\nthemselves — in migration policymaking. The \r\ninternational community also needs to achieve greater \r\ncoherence and coordination in its approaches. I am \r\nhappy to note that a Global Migration Group has \r\nalready been formed and that the Secretary-General has \r\nproposed a consultative global migration forum at the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to note that migration \r\nand development is only one element among the issues \r\npertaining to migration and development. Let us use \r\nthis High-level Dialogue to evolve a win-win situation \r\nfor origin and destination countries, as well as for the \r\nmigrants themselves. And it is imperative that we \r\ncontinue the dialogue on all migration issues at the \r\nhighest levels, for that purpose. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ze’ev Boim, Minister of Immigrant \r\nAbsorption of Israel. \r\n Mr. Boim (Israel): As the Secretary-General said \r\nin his remarks this morning, international migration \r\ntoday cries out for a global discussion. Indeed this is an \r\nimportant forum, and I look forward to our discussions \r\nin the coming days. \r\n Israel is an immigrant country. Since its \r\nestablishment, waves of immigrants have arrived on its \r\nshores, carrying with them the hopes and dreams of a \r\nbetter future. For 2,000 years, the vast majority of Jews \r\n A/61/PV.4\r\n \r\n23 06-52183 \r\n \r\nlived outside of Israel and could only pray to return to \r\ntheir homeland. The gathering of the Jewish people in \r\ntheir own land through immigration is central to the \r\nnational ethos of the Jewish people. Indeed, the Israeli \r\nimmigrant experience is the very story of the modern \r\nJewish State. \r\n Today, Israel’s population is over 7 million \r\npeople — of those 7 million, 27.5 per cent are foreign \r\nborn. Those “ascending” to Israel from Russia, \r\nEthiopia, France and South America, as well as a host \r\nof other countries, experience a process in Israel \r\nspecifically tailored to their needs, which better \r\nfacilitates their successful absorption into society. \r\n In Israel, immigrant integration begins with \r\nlearning Hebrew, the national language. Multiple \r\nframeworks exist for studying Hebrew, ranging from \r\nfull-time schools to online courses. Financial \r\nassistance is also provided for immigrants. The average \r\nnewcomer, with a wife and two children, receives an \r\n“absorption basket”, with a value of $10,000, for living \r\nexpenses during their first six months in the country. \r\nThese subsidized months give immigrants the \r\nopportunity to use their first half-year in Israel to learn \r\nHebrew, find a job, rent an apartment and prepare \r\nthemselves for their new lives. \r\n Satisfactory employment for immigrants also \r\nremains a critical concern for Israel. In recent years, \r\nIsrael has absorbed vastly differing groups of \r\nimmigrants; some coming with advanced degrees and \r\nhighly developed, technical skills, while others arrive \r\nilliterate in their native language. As such, vocational \r\nassistance is available for new immigrants in a variety \r\nof programmes. These include licensing and qualifying \r\ncourses, vocational training and employment centres \r\noffering career guidance, placement services and \r\nindividual assistance. \r\n Israel’s public and private sectors have \r\nparticularly benefited from immigrants. Since the \r\nbeginning of the 1990s, Israel has welcomed large \r\nwaves of newcomers, primarily from the former Soviet \r\nUnion — among them, many doctors, engineers and \r\nscientists. Many artists, writers and musicians also \r\nimmigrated at that time, leading to a dramatic \r\nenrichment in arts and culture. \r\n Throughout all this, Israel has tried to respect the \r\nindigenous culture of the immigrant communities. The \r\noutcome has been the growth of a rich society built on \r\na tapestry of multiculturalism, pluralism and tolerance. \r\nVery special relations exist between Israel and the \r\nJewish communities around the world. As a result, \r\nIsrael has experience on how to nurture partnerships \r\nbetween Diaspora and origin communities. In that \r\nregard, Israel works with international partners to share \r\nthis information and cooperate on a variety of levels. \r\n Like other countries, Israel also faces challenges \r\npresented by the tragic growth of human trafficking. \r\nTrafficking is a crime that imperils the lives of those \r\nsubjected to it. As a signatory to both the United \r\nNations Convention against Transnational Organized \r\nCrime and its supplementary Protocol on Trafficking in \r\nPersons, Israel continues to work in this area and \r\ncombat trafficking. \r\n Israel is wholeheartedly committed to welcoming \r\nimmigrants and fully integrating them into society \r\nwhile respecting their cultural heritage. Israel will \r\nwork with international partners to maximize the \r\nsocietal and human development potential of the global \r\nlabour market. \r\n Indeed, Israel’s commitment to bettering the \r\nmigrant experience is deeply rooted in the Jewish \r\ntradition. As it is written in the Bible, Exodus, chapter \r\n23, verse 9, “And you know the soul of the stranger, \r\nbecause you too were strangers in the land of Egypt.” \r\n The President returned to the Chair. \r\n The President: I give the floor to His Excellency \r\nMr. Paul Antoine Bohoun Bouabré, Minister of State, \r\nMinister of Planning and Development of Côte \r\nd’Ivoire. \r\n Mr. Bouabré (Côte d’Ivoire) (spoke in French): I \r\nwish, on behalf of Côte d’Ivoire, to express my \r\ngratitude for the opportunity to participate in this High-\r\nlevel Dialogue on International Migration and \r\nDevelopment. Côte d’Ivoire is traditionally a country \r\nmarked by intense international and internal migration. \r\nMore than two out of five persons living in Côte \r\nd’Ivoire are migrants. The majority of immigrants are \r\nmen — 58 per cent of the population. The number of \r\nmigrant women is, however, increasing. Another \r\ncharacteristic of immigrants is that they tend to be of \r\nworking age: 62.5 per cent are between the ages of 15 \r\nand 40. \r\n As a general rule, international migrations are \r\ndriven by economic reasons. Whether rural or urban, \r\nmen or women — migrants are usually looking for \r\nsomething better — a well-paying job and a lifestyle \r\nA/61/PV.4  \r\n \r\n06-52183 24 \r\n \r\nconducive to self-fulfilment. International and internal \r\nmigration in Côte d’Ivoire has contributed significantly \r\nto the development of our country, but also to the \r\ndevelopment of the countries of the West African \r\nsubregion. \r\n While international migration has been a factor of \r\ndevelopment for Côte d’Ivoire, so it has also been for \r\nthe migrants’ countries of origin. Most immigrants \r\ntransfer large sums of money to their country of origin. \r\nJudging by the activities of the four electronic transfer \r\nsystems, in 2004 and 2005 respectively, funds \r\namounting to $100 million and $97 million were \r\ntransferred from Côte d’Ivoire to countries of the West \r\nAfrican Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA). \r\n The level of integration of immigrant populations \r\nis exemplary. Except for participation in politics and \r\nrestrictions on rural property ownership, foreign \r\npopulations enjoy all economic and social rights. But \r\nlike any social phenomenon, given its scope and \r\nconcentrated nature, migration poses serious problems, \r\nto which the Government needs to find sustainable \r\nsolutions. They have to do mainly with land ownership \r\nand how to manage immigrant populations, especially \r\ntheir children born in Côte d’Ivoire. \r\n For development to be sustainable in Africa, it \r\nmust be dealt with on a regional basis. Côte d’Ivoire \r\nsupports this and actively participates in regional \r\neconomic integration. We would like to point out that a \r\nnumber of issues are being dealt with appropriately on \r\na regional collective basis. Migration in Africa is one \r\nof those issues, and it would be a good thing to place \r\nthis question on the agenda of urgent issues in Africa in \r\ngeneral and in the West African subregion in particular. \r\n The social, political and military crisis that has \r\nbeen occurring in Côte d’Ivoire since December 1999 \r\nhas brought about a deterioration of the already \r\nprecarious situation of the most vulnerable people: \r\nprimarily children, youth, women and immigrants. This \r\ncrisis has created new categories of people in \r\ndifficulty, particularly internally displaced persons, \r\nchild soldiers and ex-combatants. Precariousness \r\nexposes Ivoirians and foreigners to all types of risks, \r\nleading to uncertainty, insecurity and increasing \r\npoverty. This is why people risk going to Western \r\ncountries: primarily North America and Europe. Côte \r\nd’Ivoire is gradually becoming a country of \r\nemigration. \r\n In order to meet the challenge of sustainable \r\ndevelopment, the only viable response to the \r\nprecariousness that I have mentioned, it is essential \r\nthat African countries have structured, organized, \r\nenlightened governments; in other words, modern \r\nStates must be built and consolidated. This is a \r\nchallenge for Africa, a long-term task in which we in \r\nCôte d’Ivoire have been engaged with more or less \r\npositive results since independence in 1960. The crisis \r\nof the past few years, however, is jeopardizing our \r\nefforts. \r\n In a context of subregional economic integration \r\nand aggressive globalization, Côte d’Ivoire cannot \r\nclose itself off from the rest of the world. It will always \r\nwelcome people given its position as a main pole of \r\nregional economic growth. That is why we welcome \r\nthis High-level Dialogue, which allows us to share \r\nideals and unite our efforts in defining the best possible \r\npolicies and effective strategies for managing \r\nmigration for sustainable development in the interests \r\nof our people. \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Albert Kan Dapaah, Minister of the Interior of \r\nGhana. \r\n Mr. Kan Dapaah (Ghana): Madam President, my \r\ndelegation would like to congratulate you on your \r\nelection and to express appreciation to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his incisive report on international \r\nmigration and development (A/60/871). \r\n Migration is a fundamental feature of today’s \r\nworld and demands attention at the international level. \r\nIt is, therefore, not surprising that so much attention \r\nhas been focused on this High-level Dialogue as a way \r\nof exploring new ways of making the greatest possible \r\nuse of migratory flows. Ghana firmly believes that in \r\norder to give recognition to the growing link between \r\nmigration and development, international migration has \r\nto find a way into country development strategies, such \r\nas Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers. This, however, \r\ncan happen effectively only if the nature and scope of \r\nmigration are fully understood and addressed within \r\nthe globalization framework. \r\n To this end, data availability, research and \r\nanalysis need to be enhanced to put into place coherent \r\nnational and international policies and actions that can \r\nmaximize its benefits and reduce its negative effects. \r\nBrain drain is no doubt one of the most adverse effects \r\nof migration for countries, like Ghana, which have a \r\n A/61/PV.4\r\n \r\n25 06-52183 \r\n \r\ngood educational system but whose economic situation \r\ncannot provide adequate job and development \r\nopportunities for everyone. \r\n In this regard, my delegation would like to \r\nsupport calls for the promotion of return programmes \r\nin countries of origin as well as destination, thus \r\nhelping to transfer back knowledge and skills acquired, \r\nproviding our diaspora a certain level of ownership in \r\nGhana’s development. We also call for the promotion \r\nof ethical recruitment practices or help to replenish the \r\nstock of brain power in countries of origin by \r\nsupporting education and training within the \r\nframework of their development assistance. \r\n Remittances and the income multipliers they \r\ncreate are crucial resources for development and \r\nsustenance strategies in countries of origin, as in most \r\ncases they now exceed official development assistance. \r\nMoney remitted by migrants reaches even the most \r\nremote rural areas and has significant impact at the \r\nindividual and household consumption levels, thereby \r\nalleviating poverty and creating immediate multiplier \r\neffects for the local economy. \r\n But despite the huge increase in remittances, \r\nmost countries of origin are still struggling with how to \r\nharness effectively the capital created for national \r\ndevelopment. Initiatives encouraging migrants to \r\nreturn to their country of origin to share their \r\nknowledge, expertise and experience have yielded \r\npositive results. Ghana, for instance, has made efforts \r\nto reach out to its diaspora to encourage them to invest \r\nin businesses and transfer their skills. It was in this \r\nregard that the Government adopted the Dual \r\nCitizenship Law in 2001. \r\n In Ghana, as in most of Africa and indeed the \r\nworld, we are witnessing an increasing feminization of \r\nmigration. More and more women engage in \r\ntraditionally male migration patterns, moving across \r\nlong distances to fulfil their own and their family’s \r\neconomic needs. This gender phenomenon has serious \r\nsocial consequences within countries of origin with \r\ncritical implications for migration management. In this \r\nregard, it gives me great pleasure to announce that \r\nGhana has recently passed a human trafficking law and \r\nset up a national task force to see to its \r\nimplementation. We are also a signatory to the \r\nECOWAS (Economic Community of West African \r\nStates) Political Declaration and the Action Plan \r\nagainst Trafficking in Human Beings. \r\n Economic and opportunity disparities, armed \r\nconflicts and related factors will continue to provide \r\nimpetus for labour mobility. The delegation of Ghana, \r\ntherefore, supports the establishment of a mechanism \r\nto match supply with demand better in safe, legal, \r\nhumane and orderly ways to maximize the societal and \r\nhuman development potential of global labour \r\nmobility. \r\n The Government of Ghana concurs with the view \r\nhighlighted in the Secretary-General’s report that \r\npolicy coherence and harmonization need to be \r\nenhanced at the national and global levels. It \r\nappreciates the support that it continues to get from \r\nIOM and the Global Migration Group, and \r\nrecommends that they be endorsed by this Dialogue as \r\ninter-agency mechanisms to promote coherence and \r\ncollaboration among multilateral agencies. \r\n In conclusion, let me re-echo the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s remarks that we have everything to gain and \r\nnothing to lose by exploring international migration in \r\na more systematic and a more informed way. My \r\ndelegation is confident that the deliberations and \r\noutcome of this Dialogue will meet our expectations \r\nand will provide a framework on how to make \r\nmigration work for all through cooperation. \r\n The President: I give the floor to His Excellency \r\nThe Honourable Ralph Fonseca, Minster for Home \r\nAffairs and Public Utilities of Belize. \r\n Mr. Fonseca (Belize): It affords me particular \r\npleasure, Madam, to congratulate you on your election \r\nto the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nfirst session, which once again proves the adage that \r\nwomen hold up half the sky. \r\n Allow me to commend the preparatory work \r\nconducted by Member States, the United Nations, the \r\nInternational Organization for Migration and civil \r\nsociety organizations, whose contributions represent an \r\nimportant input in the context of our present \r\ndiscussions. \r\n As numerous speakers before me have \r\nacknowledged, the High-level Dialogue on \r\nInternational Migration and Development is the first \r\nmajor event in United Nations history to focus \r\nexclusively on international migration issues. It \r\npresents a unique opportunity for the international \r\ncommunity to strategize and develop policies to \r\nA/61/PV.4  \r\n \r\n06-52183 26 \r\n \r\nenhance the role of migration in promoting \r\ndevelopment and poverty reduction. \r\n Our challenge is manifold. Not only must we \r\nreach a common understanding of the complexities of \r\ninternational migration as a phenomenon in and of \r\nitself, but we must also contextualize that phenomenon \r\nin our development agenda. \r\n Above all, we must ensure that our discussions to \r\nthis end move beyond ephemeral words and result in \r\nconcrete actions. We recognize the United Nations as \r\nthe appropriate platform to facilitate these discussions. \r\n Since Belize’s independence in 1981, migration \r\nflows have transformed the social and demographic \r\ncomposition of Belize, changing it from a country with \r\na majority Afro-Caribbean population to one with a \r\nMestizo ethnic majority. The Government of Belize \r\nformulated policies and, with the assistance of the \r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for \r\nRefugees (UNHCR), embarked on programmes to \r\nensure the successful assimilation of these new \r\nBelizeans. The programmes allowed farmers access to \r\narable land and provided free education and free \r\nprimary health care. Legislation was put in place to \r\nallow for permanent residency or citizenship. A \r\nRefugee Department was established to process the \r\nlarge number of refugees, and the Labour Department \r\nincreased the number of employment permits granted. \r\nIn 1999, an amnesty came into effect, allowing \r\nundocumented migrants and recent arrivals to apply for \r\npermanent residency. \r\n As the report of the Economic Commission for \r\nLatin America and the Caribbean observed, as the \r\nGovernment undertakes efforts to respond to the \r\nchallenges that immigration flows have posed for the \r\ncountry over the past 20 years, new migration trends \r\nare emerging. These trends include inflows of more, \r\ngenerally better qualified, people from Asia and North \r\nAmerica, outflows of highly qualified natives, \r\nparticularly women, and the relocation of families. \r\n The concept of co-development put forward in \r\nthe Secretary-General’s report on international \r\nmigration and development is pivotal for rethinking \r\nmigration as a tool for development. International \r\nmigration is intrinsically linked to the development of \r\nboth receiving and sending countries. Migration flows \r\ncan, indeed, satisfy the labour demands of advanced \r\neconomies while reducing unemployment and \r\nunderemployment in countries of origin and in the \r\nprocess generate remittances, savings and know-how \r\nfor the benefit of the latter. The emphasis in \r\nco-development is on the complementarities between \r\ncountries of origin and countries of destination, which \r\noperate in a mutually beneficial symbiotic cycle. \r\n Given the deliberate decision to link migration \r\nand development, the concept of co-development \r\nnecessitates coherence in policymaking at the national \r\nand international levels. Furthermore, its emphasis on \r\ncomplementarities likewise necessitates a new \r\napproach to migration management, founded on the \r\nprinciple of common interests and shared \r\nresponsibilities. But, most important of all, it requires a \r\ncommitment to enduring multilateral and \r\nmultidimensional cooperation. \r\n In moving forward, we must set policies aimed at \r\nenhancing migration’s contribution to development and \r\nreducing its negative impact. These policies at their \r\ncore must respect the human dimension of migration. \r\nThe Secretary-General rightly notes that the benefits of \r\ninternational migration, not only for the migrants \r\nthemselves, but also for receiving societies, are \r\ncontingent on the protection of migrant’s rights. We \r\nshould encourage the universality and support the full \r\nand effective implementation of the various human \r\nrights and international labour instruments that make \r\nup the normative framework on international \r\nmigration. \r\n Although the shaping of migration continues to \r\nbe a sovereign right of States, they must collaborate on \r\nthe issue and move to coordinated action. The High-\r\nlevel Dialogue presents the first major opportunity for \r\nMember States to find concrete means of enhancing \r\nthat collaboration, in the process ensuring that the \r\npotential contributions of migration to development are \r\nfully realized. We fully endorse and associate ourselves \r\nwith those who are promoting the building of a \r\nmechanism for effective multilateral evaluation and \r\ncooperation to address international migration. \r\n The President: I give the floor to His Excellency \r\nMr. Jean Généus, Minister for Haitians Living Abroad \r\nof Haiti. \r\n Mr. Généus (Haiti) (spoke in French): The \r\nRepublic of Haiti welcomes the initiative and the \r\nvision of the General Assembly, under the leadership of \r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan, in organizing a High-\r\nlevel Dialogue on International Migration and \r\nDevelopment. In so doing, the Assembly remains true \r\n A/61/PV.4\r\n \r\n27 06-52183 \r\n \r\nto its tradition of being an essential platform for the \r\ngreat contemporary debates challenging the \r\ninternational community. \r\n The link between migration and development is \r\nwell illustrated in the context of Haiti, a major source \r\nof international migration. However, whereas the \r\npositive effects of migration on countries of destination \r\nare quite clear, its benefits for Haiti are more nuanced. \r\nIndeed, much remains to be accomplished to maximize \r\nthe potential of migration to contribute not only to \r\npoverty reduction, but also to the development of our \r\ncountry. \r\n The Republic of Haiti welcomes the primary \r\nobjective of this High-level Dialogue: to debate the \r\nmultidimensional aspects of international migration \r\nand development. The High-level Dialogue also seeks \r\nappropriate ways and means to derive maximum \r\nadvantage from the phenomenon of migration, while \r\nreducing its harmful effects. \r\n Migration offers an opportunity to obtain better \r\nsocial and economic opportunities, which improve the \r\nwell-being of individuals and families. Migration also \r\npromotes the economic emancipation of female \r\nmigrants within their households, where they are \r\nincreasingly playing a major role. That is a positive \r\ndevelopment that should be supported. Moreover, \r\nmigration contributes to poverty reduction in Haiti \r\nthrough remittances, which bring in more than \r\n$1 billion per year, or more than 25 per cent of the \r\ngross domestic product. \r\n Migration’s contributions to the development of \r\nHaiti should thus be taken better into account, through \r\na series of actions. The means of legal entry to \r\ndestination countries, which have a great demand for \r\nlow- or unskilled migrant labour, should be increased. \r\nNext, we should promote protection of the rights and \r\ninterests of migrants — particularly women, the most \r\nvulnerable sector of the population — so that they all \r\ncan contribute further to the Republic of Haiti’s \r\ndevelopment efforts. \r\n We must also address the crucial issue of large-\r\nscale regular emigration on the part of highly skilled \r\nnationals. That exodus of skills is both a loss of \r\ninvestment in human capital and a hindrance to the \r\ndevelopment of social services and the private sector. \r\nIn that connection, the Haitian Government would like \r\nto work together with countries of destination to \r\npromote policies and programmes encouraging \r\nprofessional migrants to contribute powerfully to the \r\ntransfer of technologies and the sharing of knowledge, \r\nskills and contacts with their countries of origin. \r\n For its part, the Republic of Haiti is fully aware \r\nthat its development and the management of the \r\nmigration issue remain the responsibility of its \r\nGovernment. In addition, thanks to technical support \r\nfrom the International Organization for Migration, the \r\nGovernment has already established an interministerial \r\nand intersectoral group that is working to formulate a \r\npolicy on migration in general and the migration ob \r\nlabour in particular. Haiti will also seek to further \r\nencourage intervention by the private sector and civil \r\nsociety in order to capitalize on the financial capacity \r\nof the diaspora to contribute to the country’s \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Given the shortcomings of unilateral measures, \r\nthe Haitian Government calls earnestly for the \r\nstrengthening of bilateral and multilateral cooperation \r\nto find solutions that are favourable to both countries \r\nof origin and countries of destination. \r\n At the global level, Haiti favours strengthening \r\nthe Global Migration Group and the International \r\nDialogue on Migration. The latter serves to broaden the \r\nscope of discussions by including important actors \r\nsuch as the World Trade Organization, which is \r\nincreasingly interested in the issue of the economic \r\nfallout of labour mobility. \r\n Given the importance of the impressive \r\ndevelopment of regional consultative processes, Haiti \r\nwill spare no effort to strengthen both its presence at \r\nand its active participation in such processes. To that \r\nend, my Government warmly welcomes the efforts \r\nbeing made to strengthen cooperation in regional \r\nconsultative processes. Such cooperation should \r\nfacilitate participation by Haiti and other key countries \r\nthat are sources of migratory movement by \r\nsubstantially overcoming the stumbling block of the \r\nlanguage barrier, which is a genuine restraint on \r\nintegration. \r\n Ultimately, this High-level Dialogue offers us \r\nall — countries of origin, transit and destination — a \r\nhistoric opportunity to assume collective responsibility \r\nfor the issue of migration. My country is honoured by \r\nthe massive participation of States in these meetings. \r\nHaiti earnestly hopes that this Dialogue will serve as a \r\ncatalyst for a modern and innovative debate on \r\ninternational migration that respects human rights and \r\nA/61/PV.4  \r\n \r\n06-52183 28 \r\n \r\ncreates mutual benefits for countries of origin and \r\ndestination. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Nicholas Schmit, Minister Delegate for \r\nForeign Affairs and Immigration of Luxembourg. \r\n Mr. Schmit (Luxembourg) (spoke in French): I \r\nshould like at the outset to thank all those — in \r\nparticular the Secretary-General — who have taken the \r\ninitiative in arranging this High-level Dialogue on \r\nInternational Migration and Development. I should \r\nalso like to congratulate Peter Sutherland on his report, \r\nwhich has the great merit of presenting an overview of \r\nall the major aspects of migration. It should enable us \r\nto better organize our cooperation in this area. \r\n The beginning of this dialogue within the United \r\nNations among countries of origin, transit and \r\ndestination is a positive and promising signal. We all \r\nhave in mind the tragic scenes that take place every \r\nday in the Mediterranean, the Atlantic or elsewhere. \r\nThose untenable situations require that we search \r\ntogether for both short-term and lasting solutions. \r\n At the Rabat Conference, held in July 2006 by the \r\nGovernment of the Kingdom of Morocco, countries of \r\nAfrica, Northern Africa and Europe came together to \r\nestablish a partnership among all parties to better \r\norganize migration flows so as to curb clandestine \r\nmigration — which in a few months has claimed \r\nthousands of lives of young people fleeing poverty — \r\nand to strengthen a North-South partnership aimed at \r\nre-launching economic and social development to \r\neliminate the causes of such migration, which is \r\nprompted by despair. We now have the opportunity to \r\ndevelop a global partnership to make migration a true \r\nsource of enrichment both for countries of origin and \r\nreception and for migrants themselves. \r\n My country, Luxembourg, is a country of \r\nimmigration, because immigrants represent 40 per cent \r\nof our population. We are aware of the essential \r\ncontribution made by immigration to our economic and \r\nsocial development. But we are also aware that \r\nmigration cannot be successful without an active \r\nintegration policy in host countries. \r\n Closer surveillance of borders, a better-\r\ncoordinated combat against criminal networks which \r\nencourage clandestine immigration and clandestine \r\nwork and which shamefully profit from them are \r\nwithout doubt necessary, but they cannot by themselves \r\ndo away altogether with clandestine and uncontrolled \r\nmigratory flows. We need medium- and long-term \r\naction to eradicate poverty, which is the real root cause \r\nof this type of migration. That is how effective \r\nmanagement of migratory flows can contribute to \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals. \r\n In this regard, we must strengthen the \r\nframeworks for bilateral, regional and multilateral \r\ncooperation, providing appropriate instruments and \r\nfinancial resources to make regular and legal migration \r\nan instrument of development. In this regard, the issue \r\nof financial remittances, the brain drain and migrant \r\nrights are essential. The European Union is \r\nincorporating all of these issues relating to migration in \r\nits foreign policies, as the President of the Union \r\nmentioned in his speech. \r\n Better protection of the most vulnerable migrants, \r\nwomen and children in particular, is absolutely \r\nnecessary, particularly by effectively combating \r\ntrafficking in human beings. Respect for human rights \r\nis an essential element that must be strengthened in all \r\nmigration policies. \r\n I would also like to draw attention to the need for \r\nan information policy, particularly in the societies of \r\nthe North, regarding the advantages of legal migration \r\nfor our ageing societies; that is the most effective way \r\nto combat xenophobia, racism, discrimination and \r\nexclusion. \r\n Today, my country devotes 0.87 per cent of its \r\ngross domestic income to development cooperation. \r\nMy country would like to participate, above and \r\nbeyond this Dialogue, to ongoing reflection on the \r\nquestion of migration and development. We support the \r\nestablishment of a global forum, provided that it is an \r\ninformal structure which allows for a genuine sharing \r\nof experiences, as proposed by the Secretary-General. \r\nWe must commend Belgium, which has already \r\nexpressed its readiness to host the first meeting of such \r\na Forum in 2007. \r\n Now, we must draw the correct conclusions from \r\nthe Dialogue that we have conducted over these two \r\ndays in New York. We must now enrich and better \r\ncoordinate our policies, better organize our cooperation \r\nand make our policies more coherent in the interest of \r\nour countries, both of the North and of the South, in \r\nthe interest of our societies and, most important, in the \r\ninterest of migrants. \r\n A/61/PV.4\r\n \r\n29 06-52183 \r\n \r\n The President: I give the floor to His Excellency \r\nMr. Sergiy Rudyk, Minister, Head of the Committee on \r\nNationalities and Migration of Ukraine. \r\n Mr. Rudyk (Ukraine): At the outset, Madam \r\nPresident, let me, on behalf of the Government of \r\nUkraine, congratulate you and, through you, Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan, on the timely organization of this \r\nvery important Dialogue. I hope that our deliberations \r\nduring these two days will contribute significantly to \r\nthe development both of the countries where migrants \r\ncome from and of those where they arrive. \r\n My delegation wishes to align itself with the \r\nstatement made by Ms. Tarja Filatov of Finland on \r\nbehalf of the European Union. We have carefully \r\nexamined the Secretary-General’s comprehensive \r\nreport on international migration and development \r\n(A/60/871). In our view, it addresses the core of the \r\nissues. We agree that migration and development are \r\ninterrelated and that the international community \r\nshould foster cooperation in this field to make better \r\nuse of the development potential of migration. \r\n Let me elaborate on Ukraine’s experience with \r\nthe migration process and with related constraints. Due \r\nto its geopolitical situation, Ukraine has a high level of \r\nmigration. One can observe that Ukraine is both a \r\ncountry of origin and a destination for international \r\nmigration and has become a crossroads of migratory \r\nmovements from East to West, South to North and \r\nback. According to United Nations data, my country \r\noccupies fourth place in the number of international \r\nmigrants. \r\n During its 15 years of independence, Ukraine has \r\npassed through three important periods of international \r\nmigration. At the beginning of the 1990s, a great \r\nnumber of Ukrainian nationals went abroad for \r\npermanent residence. At the end of the last century, the \r\nprocess of stabilization took place, and currently we \r\nare observing a positive balance in migratory \r\nmovement. At the very beginning, we lacked \r\nexperience in the area of migration management. For \r\nthe first time, we faced such phenomena as asylum \r\nseekers, refugees, illegal migrants and guest workers. \r\nToday, Ukraine has acceded to the 1951 Convention \r\nrelating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 \r\nProtocol relating to the Status of Refugees. Since 2002, \r\nUkraine has been a full member of the International \r\nOrganization for Migration. \r\n But a lot remains to be done. With the European \r\nUnion now bordering Ukraine, migration movements \r\nare likely to grow, and this defines Ukraine as a \r\ncountry with mixed streams of migrants. That reality \r\nhas encouraged the Government of Ukraine to \r\nintroduce measures that would diminish illegal \r\nimmigration. Monitoring the migration process and \r\npossible participation in the system to prevent illegal \r\nmigration are the main priorities of relevant \r\nGovernment institutions. Guidelines and procedures \r\nhave been established in accordance with international \r\npractice on applications for refugee status. Close to \r\n2,300 individuals have already received such status in \r\nUkraine. \r\n As far as migration from Ukraine is concerned, it \r\nprimarily involves those who are seeking better jobs. \r\nAccording to data that have not been officially \r\nconfirmed, many millions of Ukrainians are currently \r\nworking abroad, while the official data show that there \r\nare only 56,000. That is a clear indication of a further \r\nneed to facilitate legal migration in cooperation \r\nbetween countries of origin and receiving countries in \r\norder to reduce irregular or illegal immigration. With \r\nthe assistance of the European Union, the Office of the \r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and \r\nthe International Organization for Migration, Ukraine \r\nis successfully implementing programmes to develop \r\ninstitutional capacity for migration management, the \r\nmain purpose of which is its development of migration \r\nservices in Ukraine in keeping with international \r\nhumanitarian standards. The establishment of the \r\nImmigration Service of Ukraine is ongoing. \r\n In conclusion, let me commend the Special \r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General, Peter \r\nSutherland, for the role he has played in this area. We \r\nwelcome the decision to extend his mandate. We hope \r\nthat this Dialogue will contribute to a better \r\nunderstanding of world migration processes and the \r\nneed for collective coordinated efforts, both on the \r\nnational and the regional level. As Secretary-General \r\nKofi Annan told us this morning, “It is now time to \r\nturn to the evidence” (A/61/PV.3). \r\n The President: I give the floor to His Excellency \r\nThe Honourable Tarsis Bazana Kabwegyere, MP, \r\nMinister of Relief, Disaster Preparedness and Refugees \r\nof Uganda. \r\nA/61/PV.4  \r\n \r\n06-52183 30 \r\n \r\n Mr. Kabwegyere (Uganda): Madam President, I \r\ntake this opportunity to join in congratulating you on \r\nthe assumption of your important role. \r\n Uganda takes cognizance of the well-developed \r\nmanual, the International Agenda for Migration \r\nManagement, to which my country contributed during \r\nthe global consultative process at the regional level and \r\nunder the Berne Initiative. What are now needed are \r\ncomprehensive and coherent global policies to manage \r\ninternational migration. \r\n Why do we need comprehensive and coherent \r\nglobal polices to manage international migration? As \r\nthe labour market has become increasingly global, \r\nlabour migration has become a key means of \r\naccomplishing essential business objectives, such as \r\naddressing labour market shortages. Improved \r\nmechanisms are needed to better match global labour \r\nsupply and demand in ways that maximize the societal \r\nand human development potential of global labour \r\nmobility. \r\n The need to invest in human resource \r\ndevelopment has taken on international significance as \r\na result of increasing labour mobility. Ensuring that \r\nlabour movements are safe, humane, legal and orderly \r\nis in the inherent interest of stakeholders, including \r\nindividual migrants, Governments, countries of origin \r\nand destination, the private sector and civil society. \r\nThe regulatory framework for migration needs to be \r\nmade more transparent. A centralized information \r\nsource on national and regional migration legislation, \r\nregulations and administrative requirements would \r\nbenefit all stakeholders. Remittances have become a \r\nsignificant source of global finance and a potential \r\ndriver of economic growth in developing countries like \r\nUganda. \r\n With respect to our own experience in migration \r\nmanagement, internal displacement caused by rebel \r\nactivity in northern Uganda brought various \r\nchallenges, including protected camps to guard the \r\npeople from abductions and forced recruitment. Today, \r\nwe are in peace talks with the rebels in Juba in the \r\nsouthern Sudan to end that conflict peacefully so that \r\npeople can return home from internally displaced \r\npersons camps and engage in production and self-\r\ndetermination. \r\n Uganda has put in place progressive refugee \r\nlegislation that can now allow refugees to live \r\ndignified lives by accessing land, produce, and work \r\nand to enjoy all the accruing rights. We have also been \r\nactively involved in regional efforts to resolve the \r\ndisplacement of people in the Great Lakes region, in \r\nparticular through Uganda’s chairmanship of the \r\nsuccessfully completed Burundi peace talks; in \r\nsouthern Sudan under the Intergovernmental Authority \r\non Development; and through our efforts in Somalia. \r\n The Constitution of Uganda has been amended to \r\nallow Ugandans who have acquired other citizenship to \r\nremain Ugandans — in other words, we have allowed \r\ndual citizenship under the Constitution. We have also \r\nset up a unit in the Ministry of Labour to handle the \r\nexternalization of labour. Regulations have been \r\ndeveloped and endorsed by the Government to guide \r\nthat process, where we have surplus labour. \r\n Through the East African Community, with \r\nsupport from the United States Government, we have, \r\nthrough the International Organization for Migration, \r\nimplemented a migration management programme in \r\nwhich labour officials have acquired related training \r\nand have been provided with small, necessary \r\nequipment to handle migration. The project also lays \r\ndown a framework for a comprehensive review of \r\nmigration legislation. \r\n Our commitment to and support for the \r\nestablishment of an East African federation to \r\nguarantee free movement of people, goods, and \r\nservices as the region develops into a one-citizenship \r\ncountry will ease free movement of people. \r\n In conclusion, we badly need capacity-building \r\nand positive programmes that can bring us all together \r\nat an effective level of global migration management. \r\nBut, above all, we need a total review of the global \r\neconomy in order to understand why international \r\nmigration has become such a big problem. \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Juma Alifa Ngasongwa, Minister for Planning, \r\nEconomy and Empowerment of the United Republic of \r\nTanzania. \r\n Mr. Ngasongwa (United Republic of Tanzania): \r\nAt the outset, Madam, let me congratulate you on your \r\nelection as President of the sixty-first session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and assure you of my delegation’s \r\nfull support. \r\n We align ourselves with the statement delivered \r\nby the Minister of Home Affairs of South Africa on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China. \r\n A/61/PV.4\r\n \r\n31 06-52183 \r\n \r\n The Government of the United Republic of \r\nTanzania welcomes this High-level Dialogue on \r\nmigration and the opportunity it has provided for \r\nputting the issue of migration and development on the \r\ninternational agenda. We welcome the reports prepared \r\nby the Secretary-General for this Dialogue. The reports \r\nhave provided us with a wealth of information on this \r\nmatter. The recommendations contained therein \r\nprovide a basis for our deliberations and material for \r\nfurther discussions. My Government welcomes the \r\nrecommendation made in the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport (A/60/871) for a consultative forum on \r\nmigration. However, more discussions are needed on \r\nthe establishment of this forum and the form it should \r\ntake in view of the ongoing reforms of the United \r\nNations. \r\n Migration is an old historical phenomenon with \r\nvaried causes and consequences. The current rising \r\ntrend of migration can be attributed to many factors, \r\nincluding rapid globalization, advances in transport, \r\ncommunication and technology, deteriorating political, \r\nsocial and environmental conditions, demographic \r\nfactors and armed conflicts. The patterns of migration \r\nflows are mixed, complex and challenging. We should \r\nalso point out that internal national migration is \r\nequally challenging to policymakers and adds \r\ncomplexity to the phenomenon of international \r\nmigration. \r\n Migrants are not a homogenous group; migrants \r\nmay have the same basic needs, but they also have \r\nneeds that are specific to their groupings, which need \r\nto be addressed accordingly in managing international \r\nmigration. \r\n For my Government, international migration and \r\ndevelopment is a new area that we are trying to \r\nunderstand and cope with. The Government, with \r\nsupport from the International Organization for \r\nMigration, initiated a project in 2004 on Migration for \r\nDevelopment in Tanzania. A preliminary assessment \r\nhas been undertaken, and the Government is now \r\nworking on the issues raised in the study. The \r\nmanagement of migration requires a coordinated, \r\nmultisectoral approach and compliance with \r\ninternational human rights standards and practice. In \r\nthat regard, we wish to emphasize the importance of \r\ninternational cooperation and support in capacity-\r\nbuilding, especially in the following areas. First is the \r\npromotion of policy coherence on migration issues and \r\nsector development policies, since migration cuts \r\nacross various sectors. We need also to explore the \r\nmainstreaming of migration into poverty reduction and \r\nemployment creation strategies. \r\n The second area is that of advocacy and \r\ncommunication of information on safe and legal \r\nmigration such that migration is a result of informed \r\nchoice and not a survival strategy and that it occurs in \r\nconditions of dignity. \r\n The third area is the prevention and elimination \r\nof smuggling in persons, especially women and \r\nchildren. And fourthly, the promotion of respect for the \r\nhuman rights of migrant workers and their families. \r\n The volume of the remittances transmitted by \r\nmigrant workers and the benefits of those remittances \r\nto their home communities have been widely \r\nrecognized. Their positive impact on individual \r\nhousehold income can be significant, but it cannot \r\nreplace official development assistance. We must look \r\nsimultaneously into ways to enhance the productive \r\nuse of remittances as well as to reduce the cost of \r\nsending such funds. \r\n While we cannot prevent migration, my \r\nGovernment is also concerned about both the issue of \r\nthe brain drain caused by the migration of skilled \r\nworkers and the “brain waste” produced when skilled \r\nmigrants are not utilized efficiently. We encourage the \r\neffective engagement of diasporas in contributing to \r\nthe development of their countries of origin. We also \r\nencourage the transfer of technology from receiving to \r\nsending countries. \r\n While it is widely recognized that, when properly \r\nmanaged, migration is beneficial to both sending and \r\nreceiving communities, we note also that there is an \r\ninformation gap on many aspects of the linkage \r\nbetween migration and development. We would \r\ntherefore urge more collaboration and cooperation \r\namong nations to gain and share knowledge and skills \r\nthat will assist in the development of policies and \r\nregulations that will govern the many aspects and \r\ndimensions of migration in a way that will bring about \r\na win-win situation for migrants, their countries of \r\norigin and the States that receive them. \r\n Let me conclude by saying that international \r\nmigration is a phenomenon that is here to stay and that, \r\nas managing migration goes beyond a country’s \r\nboundaries, what is needed is concerted efforts among \r\nus to address the root causes of migration and to \r\nA/61/PV.4  \r\n \r\n06-52183 32 \r\n \r\nprovide an environment where migration is freely \r\nundertaken in a safe, informed and dignified manner \r\nand with full respect for human rights. My country is \r\ncommitted to work with the international community in \r\nthat endeavour. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to Her \r\nExcellency Mrs. Aigul Ryskulova, Chairperson of the \r\nState Committee on Migration and Employment of \r\nKyrgyzstan. \r\n Mrs. Ryskulova (Kyrgyzstan) (spoke in \r\nRussian): First and foremost, allow me, on behalf of \r\nthe Government of the Republic of Kyrgyzstan, to \r\nexpress our sincere gratitude to Secretary-General Kofi \r\nAnnan for the successful organization of this meeting. I \r\nalso wish to thank Mr. Brunson McKinley, Director \r\nGeneral of the International Organization for \r\nMigration, for the consistent support given to the \r\ndevelopment of migration policy in our country. \r\n This High-level Dialogue on Migration and \r\nDevelopment is very important, as it offers an \r\nopportunity to outline our future efforts in that regard. \r\n The regulation of migration processes is currently \r\none of the main policy issues for all States. The \r\ndomestic and foreign policies of all countries are based \r\non economic values and indicators that are in turn \r\nclosely linked to migration and development issues. \r\nIncreasingly, developing countries have begun to \r\npursue determined and well-designed policies, to \r\nintroduce legislation and to establish bodies to deal \r\nwith processes associated with the regulation of \r\nmigration. Like any other country developing under the \r\nrules of a market economy, Kyrgyzstan has \r\nexperienced all sorts of migration. \r\n Kyrgyzstan’s geopolitical situation — including \r\nits proximity to countries with unstable political \r\nenvironments — as well as the military campaigns to \r\nour south and general domestic unemployment have \r\ninfluenced priorities in the regulation of migration \r\nprocesses in Kyrgyzstan. A clear State policy on \r\nmigration is currently in effect in the Kyrgyz Republic, \r\nwhich is being implemented by the newly established \r\nState Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic for Migration \r\nand Employment. We believe that policy in this area \r\nshould be based on recognition of the fact that \r\nmigration is an objective process. In that context, our \r\nprimary aim is to serve the interests of the individual, \r\nsociety and the State as a whole. \r\n In our work, we believe it is necessary to \r\nemphasize the positive consequences and potential of \r\nmigration, including its positive impact on the balance \r\nof payments, domestic labour markets, the reduction of \r\npoverty, cultural enrichment and the transfer of labour \r\nknow-how and skills when the migrants return home, \r\nto name but a few aspects. \r\n Unfortunately, Kyrgyzstan has recently faced a \r\nnumber of problems related to migration, primarily \r\nthose associated with protecting the rights and legal \r\ninterests of migrants and members of their families in \r\ncountries of destination. The Government has taken \r\ncertain bold steps aimed at creating an international \r\ntreaty basis for migration, providing advice and \r\ninformation to migrants about their rights and \r\nestablishing expatriate communities, cultural centres \r\nand centres to provide legal protection. \r\n The time has come to enhance support for \r\nmigrants who remit funds in a legal and advantageous \r\nmanner, through intergovernmental and inter-bank \r\nagreements aimed at reducing transaction costs. Other \r\nproblems must still be addressed, including how to \r\nmore effectively utilize migrants’ remittances in order \r\nto help them start small businesses and to invest in \r\nfamily budgets and education. I believe this will be \r\ndifficult without the assistance and experience of \r\ninternational and financial institutions, especially the \r\nInternational Organization for Migration (IOM). The \r\nGovernment of the Kyrgyz Republic has significant \r\ncollaboration with the IOM in managing the migration \r\nprocess, capacity-building and development of \r\nlegislation. IOM and Kyrgyzstan are also working on a \r\nnew concept of migration policy that will reflect major \r\nglobal trends and make use of the world’s experience \r\nin that regard. \r\n One of the main tenets of international migration \r\nis that the State has the capacity to control and regulate \r\nborder crossings. That, however, does not constitute an \r\nabsolute mandate, for it must adhere to the human right \r\nto travel freely and the commitments of States set out \r\nin various international agreements and treaties. \r\n Acknowledging the commitment of the Kyrgyz \r\nRepublic to the fundamental principles and norms of \r\ninternational law, our Government is making every \r\neffort to ensure the rights of all categories of migrants. \r\nOur Government is providing assistance to persons \r\ndisplaced involuntarily, refugees, persons seeking \r\n A/61/PV.4\r\n \r\n33 06-52183 \r\n \r\nKyrgyz citizenship and persons of Kyrgyz origin who \r\nhave chosen to live abroad. \r\n I hope that this meeting will lead to a \r\nconstructive dialogue that sheds light on the various \r\nissues related to the legal and institutional context of \r\nthe management of migration processes and of \r\npopulation flows. I also hope that we will endeavour to \r\nidentify priorities for the future development of \r\nmigration policies among the countries represented \r\nhere. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Zhazbeck Abdiyev, Vice-Minister and \r\nChairperson of the Committee on Migration, Ministry \r\nof Labour and Social Protection of Kazakhstan. \r\n Mr. Abdiyev (Kazakhstan) (spoke in Russian): \r\nMigration is a phenomenon that has for quite some \r\ntime not received much attention. We are today \r\ngradually beginning to appreciate the need to manage \r\nmigration flows for the sake of the development of \r\ncountries of origin and destination alike. Societies must \r\nfocus efforts towards resolving the problems of the \r\nreintegration of migrants and enhancing the protection \r\nof their rights in countries of destination. Of no less \r\nimportance is the gender aspect of migration. As is \r\nwell known, women migrants are more vulnerable and \r\nface greater risks and discrimination than men. \r\n Unfortunately, human trafficking, slavery and \r\nsexual exploitation continue to be burning issues on the \r\nglobal agenda. Measures to eradicate those scourges of \r\nthe contemporary world should include improving the \r\neconomic and social situation of vulnerable sectors of \r\nthe population. We must also strengthen international \r\nand State cooperation in that area. The protection and \r\nrehabilitation of the victims of trafficking are \r\nextremely important components in combating this \r\ntype of transnational crime. No less important is the \r\nneed to punish those who traffic in human beings, as \r\nwell as the need for agencies that deal with this issue to \r\nput in place stricter controls. \r\n As a country of destination, transit and origin of \r\nmigrants, Kazakhstan devotes particular attention to \r\nproblems involving illegal, ethnic and labour migration \r\nand the protection of the rights of migrant workers. \r\nThe migration policy of my country includes the \r\nfollowing priorities. \r\n One of our policies is to liberalize the migration \r\nregime, protect rights and freedoms on the basis of the \r\nrule of law and to observe strict compliance with the \r\nnorms of international law. We also seek to create \r\nconditions for the return of ethnic Kazakhs — \r\nOralmans — to their native land, as well as to utilize \r\nexternal labour migration to attract highly skilled \r\nworkers. \r\n The Government of Kazakhstan is strengthening \r\nits national migration legislation and implementing a \r\nnational migration policy programme. Work is under \r\nway to develop a new concept of migration policy that \r\nwill incorporate international best practices adapted to \r\nour conditions. \r\n This year, my country became the first country of \r\nthe Commonwealth of Independent States to carry out \r\na pilot campaign to legalize illegal migrant workers. \r\nThat effort has allowed migrant workers to register \r\nwith local migration agencies. \r\n An interdepartmental working group has been \r\nworking since February to develop and implement \r\nmigration policy. The group includes representatives \r\nfrom the International Organization for Migration and \r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner \r\nfor Refugees. \r\n Kazakhstan is party to bilateral treaties and \r\nmultilateral conventions that directly or indirectly \r\nprotect the rights of migrants. Our country is also \r\nworking closely with the relevant international \r\norganizations and United Nations agencies in this area. \r\n Kazakhstan hopes that the High-level Dialogue \r\non International Migration and Development will \r\nsignificantly contribute to identifying trends in \r\ninternational migration and its effects on development. \r\nMigration issues transcend all existing borders between \r\nStates. It is important to identify ways to successfully \r\nand effectively manage migration for development. \r\nThe global agenda should include among its priorities \r\nsuch issues as economic growth, human development, \r\nthe creation of decent jobs in developing countries, \r\ngender equality, the protection of the rights of migrants \r\nand finding solutions to the problems of labour \r\nmigration, illegal migration, human trafficking, \r\nmigrant health care, HIV/AIDS and the brain drain. \r\n We believe that, if properly managed, migration \r\ncan be mutually beneficial and hold out great potential \r\nfor the development of the countries of destination, \r\ntransit and origin. The problems of migration can be \r\nsolved. Further open dialogue and closer cooperation at \r\nA/61/PV.4  \r\n \r\n06-52183 34 \r\n \r\nthe bilateral, regional and global levels can guarantee \r\nthe success of that noble endeavour. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Hans Winkler, State Secretary for \r\nForeign Affairs of Austria. \r\n Mr. Winkler (Austria): Austria fully subscribes \r\nto the statement delivered by the representative of \r\nFinland on behalf of the European Union (EU). \r\n At the outset, I would like to express our \r\ngratitude to Secretary-General Kofi Annan and \r\nMr. Peter Sutherland, his Special Representative for the \r\nHigh-level Dialogue on International Migration and \r\nDevelopment, for their inspiration, for getting their \r\npriorities right and for the substantial preparatory work \r\nthey devoted to this event, along with Member States \r\nand non-governmental actors throughout the world. \r\n Migration issues have been at the top of the \r\npolitical agenda for years. Yet policies comprising both \r\nmigration and the development aid dimension, and \r\ndesigned to create a positive impact on the ground, are \r\nstill very urgently needed. Our endeavour here at the \r\nglobal level has to be underpinned by concrete action \r\nat the regional and subregional levels, where tailor-\r\nmade solutions can be worked out. \r\n In July 2006, the Euro-African Ministerial \r\nConference on Migration and Development, held in \r\nRabat, brought together for the first time countries of \r\norigin, transit and destination along the migration \r\nroutes from western, central and northern Africa to \r\nEurope, as well as regional and international \r\norganizations. In the years to come, the implementation \r\nof the action plan that was agreed at Rabat will have a \r\nconcrete impact on the ground, which is urgently \r\nneeded to better manage migratory flows and to \r\nprevent humanitarian disasters, which we have all \r\nwitnessed in the Mediterranean and eastern Atlantic. \r\n At the same time, the EU has always underlined \r\nthat a continent-wide approach to migration is needed. \r\nWe look forward to the holding of a pan-African \r\nconference on migration under the aegis of the \r\nCommission of the African Union (AU). We believe \r\nthat those processes could inspire work in other \r\nregions. \r\n With regard to Austria, migratory flows on the \r\none hand, and a focus on development cooperation on \r\nthe other, overlap, in particular with regard to several \r\ncountries in South-East Europe. We are including \r\ninformation on legal migration and on the hazards of \r\nillegal migration in our development programmes. We \r\nare also looking into the potential of sizeable diasporas \r\nfor development cooperation purposes. \r\n This morning, in his very inspiring speech (see \r\nA/61/PV.3), the Secretary-General reminded us that, \r\nincreasingly, countries are tending to be simultaneously \r\ncountries of origin and countries of destination. In that \r\nconnection, we must bear in mind that the South-South \r\ndimension of migration warrants our particular \r\nattention. When requested by partner countries, \r\ndevelopment cooperation can also contribute towards \r\ncapacity-building in the area of managing migration for \r\nthe benefit of all involved, and in the area of \r\npreventing trafficking and the smuggling of migrants. \r\n Migrant women, who constitute half of all \r\ninternational migrants worldwide and make valuable \r\nand social and economic contributions to sending and \r\nhost countries alike, are facing double discrimination \r\nall over the world — as women and as migrants. We \r\ntherefore strongly believe that a gender perspective \r\nshould be incorporated into all migration policies and \r\nstrategies. \r\n An effective and fruitful dialogue starts by \r\nexploring and understanding each other’s positions. It \r\nis crucial to gain such mutual understanding of the \r\ncauses and effects of migration, as well as of its impact \r\nin terms of development. The links between migration \r\nand development are complex. But I believe that, when \r\nmanaged effectively, migration can create a win-win \r\nsituation that may have a substantial positive impact on \r\nall parties involved. \r\n Austria shares the view expressed by many \r\ndelegations that the issue of follow-up is crucial. \r\nAustria will therefore be an active participant in our \r\ncommon work in progress, which will make sure that \r\nthis increasingly important topic remains on the \r\ninternational agenda. The Dialogue must continue, and \r\nwe support all proposals that will keep it alive without \r\nbuilding new bureaucratic structures. \r\n In conclusion, I should like to say that I was \r\nparticularly impressed by the metaphor used in the \r\nSecretary-General’s report on international migration \r\nand development (A/60/871), namely, that of the \r\nmigrant as a human link between cultures and \r\nsocieties. Could we easily think of a function more \r\nimportant than that of creating links between cultures \r\nand societies currently in grave danger of being torn \r\n A/61/PV.4\r\n \r\n35 06-52183 \r\n \r\napart by the strong centrifugal tendencies that are \r\nemerging as reactions to the very process of \r\nglobalization? \r\n The President: I now call on Her Excellency \r\nMs. Marta Altolaguirre, Vice-Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Guatemala. \r\n Ms. Altolaguirre (Guatemala) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): I would like to begin my statement by \r\nthanking the Secretariat on behalf of the Government \r\nof Guatemala for so efficiently organizing this High-\r\nlevel Dialogue on International Migration and \r\nDevelopment. I am of the view that this topic is \r\nextremely important in an increasingly globalized \r\nworld. I would also like to express our thanks to the \r\nSecretary-General for his report (A/60/871) on the \r\ntopic under discussion and to congratulate him on the \r\npreparatory events that have opened our minds to \r\ndiscussing and reviewing the phenomenon of migration \r\nand its impact on development which, I am sure, will \r\ncontribute to ensuring that this High-level Dialogue is \r\na success. \r\n Guatemala shares the views expressed during the \r\nstatements made by the representative of South Africa \r\non behalf of the Group of 77 and China and by the \r\nrepresentative of Guyana on behalf of the Rio Group. \r\n My delegation has particular interest in \r\ninternational migration, since Guatemala, although \r\nprincipally a country of origin, is also a country of \r\ntransit and destination. Central America in general is a \r\nhighly mobile region, particularly towards the North. \r\nGuatemala is of the view that international migration \r\nhas been a shared and constant phenomenon \r\nthroughout human history and that it has become more \r\ncomplex and more intense as time passes and with the \r\ndevelopment of technology. Such movements should \r\nnever be criminalized; they should be understood from \r\nthe ethical and the political perspectives. I should note \r\nthat in our region people are no longer emigrating to \r\nflee from conflict; they are driven by a natural desire to \r\nseek better opportunities. \r\n Migration is the outcome of the right to freedom \r\nof movement and of considered decisions by \r\nindividuals, but also of the need satisfactorily to \r\nprovide for their families. In addition, it is the result of \r\nan increasing trend among young people, who, with \r\ntheir considerable energy and desire for advancement, \r\nare attracted by better earning opportunities beyond \r\ntheir borders. \r\n We should also highlight the increasing number \r\nof women who decide to leave their communities and, \r\nin the process, encounter all types of risks, including \r\nsexual exploitation and, more broadly speaking, \r\ntrafficking in persons. Like men, they leave in search \r\nof better opportunities, but they also leave to meet \r\npressing family needs and responsibilities. \r\n The subject of transborder relations is particularly \r\nimportant, because these affect many young people in \r\ntheir desire to achieve family reunification abroad. \r\nRegionally, in Central America, meetings have been \r\nheld to coordinate protection mechanisms for children \r\nand to ensure safe repatriation of minors. \r\n Clearly, international migration responds to the \r\ndemand for workers, receiving countries’ labour needs, \r\nand the inability of societies of origin to create \r\nsufficient jobs. It is also clear that the governance of \r\nthis migration requires unified and rational cooperation \r\namong States. These comments are just some examples \r\nthat show that international migration is a fact that is a \r\nresponsibility that all of us should assume in a \r\ncomprehensive manner. Like Guatemala, all countries \r\ncan be or have been societies of origin, transit or \r\ndestination at some time in their history. \r\n Guatemala welcomes the endeavour at this High-\r\nlevel Dialogue to understand the relationship between \r\ninternational migration and development, and to \r\nremedy the limitations that exist in many countries of \r\norigin. We consider that the concept of co-development \r\nset out by the Secretary-General in his report is a \r\nchallenge that should be further considered. \r\nInternational migration can contribute to development \r\nin our countries, but it is our shared responsibility to \r\nensure that this development takes place in a stable and \r\nsustainable manner. \r\n It is crucial that we put an end to forced \r\nmigration, whether it be caused by instability or by \r\nlack of opportunities. That responsibility lies mainly \r\nwith the countries of origin, but there is a universal \r\nobligation to protect the human rights of every person, \r\nand that obligation must be met by all. It is also worth \r\nmentioning that it is only through rational cooperation \r\namong countries of origin, transit and destination that \r\nwe will be able effectively to combat the trafficking \r\nand smuggling of individuals. \r\n In short, we must always consider this issue from \r\nthe human perspective. \r\nA/61/PV.4  \r\n \r\n06-52183 36 \r\n \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Pracha Guna-Kasem, Senior Adviser to the \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Thailand. \r\n Mr. Guna-Kasem (Thailand): Thailand wishes to \r\nexpress its appreciation for the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral (A/60/871) on international migration and \r\ndevelopment, which highlights the interconnection \r\nbetween these two issues, as well as the question of \r\nhow this phenomenon can benefit countries, be they \r\ncountries of origin, transit or destination of migrants. \r\nWe also welcome the report of the Global Commission \r\non International Migration, which provides a \r\ncomprehensive overview of international migration in \r\nvarious parts of the world and proposes a substantive \r\nlist of useful recommendations on effective migration \r\nmanagement. \r\n Thailand is, all in one, a country of origin, transit \r\nand destination. We have thus accumulated a great deal \r\nof experience and many lessons, both positive and \r\nnegative, on migration issues. I would like to share \r\nwith members some of our thoughts on migration \r\nissues. \r\n First, Thailand believes that international \r\nmigration is overall a positive global phenomenon that, \r\nif properly managed, can enrich societies and cultures \r\nand contribute significantly to economic growth and \r\ndevelopment in both countries of origin and countries \r\nof destination. It is on this premise that the Royal Thai \r\nGovernment in 2004 embarked on a regularization \r\nscheme for approximately 2 million illegal migrant \r\nworkers from neighbouring countries who were already \r\npresent in Thailand. This has resulted in 1.3 million \r\nmigrant workers being registered and in most of them \r\nbeing issued work permits which entitle them to access \r\nto basic health services. On the outbound front, the \r\nGovernment has been facilitating Thai nationals \r\nseeking legal employment opportunities abroad by \r\nproviding, for example, many pre-departure training \r\nprogrammes to develop workers’ skills necessary to \r\nmeet the demands of labour markets abroad. \r\n Secondly, we are of the view that rights-based \r\nand victim-centred approaches are essential to any \r\nmigration management efforts, since people on \r\nirregular migration, especially women and children, are \r\nhighly vulnerable to being trafficked and abused. In \r\nthat regard, Thailand has attached great importance to \r\nintensifying efforts to protect the fundamental human \r\nrights and human dignity of migrants, irrespective of \r\ntheir documentation status. Migrant workers are \r\nempowered to exercise their rights and to have access \r\nto resources and remedies through the information, \r\ntraining and education provided by the Thai \r\nGovernment. We have also been promoting legal \r\npractices regarding the recruitment of migrant workers, \r\nand ensuring access to effective legal remedies for \r\nmigrants. \r\n Thirdly, we share the views of many previous \r\nspeakers that multidimensional aspects of international \r\nmigration and development must be taken into account \r\nwhen formulating an effective national migration \r\npolicy. International migration is linked with diverse \r\npolicy issues including development, human rights, \r\nhuman security, trade and health, as well as national \r\nsecurity concerns. Therefore, a coherent, \r\ncomprehensive and integrated migration policy \r\ninvolving multiple stakeholders is crucial to attaining \r\nour mutual goal of maximizing the benefits of \r\ninternational migration, and minimizing its negative \r\neffects. \r\n Fourthly, international migration cannot be \r\nmanaged effectively in isolation from international \r\ncooperation, simply because it involves more than one \r\ncountry and concerns more than one global issue. \r\nThailand fully recognizes the importance of \r\npartnership, capacity-building and the sharing of the \r\nbest practices at all levels, particularly the bilateral and \r\nregional levels. \r\n We have played an active role in the regional \r\nconsultative and cooperation frameworks, namely, the \r\nIntergovernmental Asia-Pacific Consultations on \r\nRefugees, Displaced Persons and Migrants; the \r\nRegional Ministerial Conference on People Smuggling, \r\nTrafficking in Persons and Related Transnational \r\nCrime, or the Bali Process; and the Coordinated \r\nMekong Ministerial Initiative against Trafficking. We \r\nhave initiated and concluded several bilateral \r\nmemorandums of understanding with countries in the \r\nMekong subregion to address migration-related \r\nproblems, for example, the memorandums of \r\nunderstanding with Cambodia and the Lao People’s \r\nDemocratic Republic on Bilateral Cooperation for \r\nEliminating Trafficking in Children and Women and \r\nAssisting Victims of Trafficking, and the \r\nmemorandums of understanding with Cambodia, the \r\nLao People’s Democratic Republic and Myanmar on \r\nCooperation in the Employment of Workers. \r\n A/61/PV.4\r\n \r\n37 06-52183 \r\n \r\n Lastly, Thailand supports the Secretary-General’s \r\nproposal to consider the possibility of developing a \r\nglobal consultative process within the United Nations, \r\nwith the active participation of all stakeholders, to \r\nmaintain the dialogue on international migration after \r\nthis High-level Dialogue. We hope that the proposed \r\nmechanism would effectively serve as a potential \r\nintergovernmental forum to sustain the momentum of \r\npolitical will and develop the basis for future \r\ncooperation on international migration laid by this \r\nHigh-level Dialogue. \r\n The President: I give the floor to His Excellency \r\nMr. Kiyohiko Toyama, Vice-Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Japan. \r\n Mr. Toyama (Japan): I would like to begin by \r\ncongratulating you, Madam, on your election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \r\nsession. Let me take this opportunity to assure you that \r\nyou have the Government of Japan’s full support as \r\nyou lead the General Assembly in addressing the \r\nchallenges facing the United Nations. \r\n It is essential that every society be fair in the way \r\nit receives and treats people from other countries. \r\nSocieties should promote cultural diversity and strive \r\nfor openness, flexibility and more mobile workforces. \r\nMigrants, in turn, can contribute to the development of \r\ntheir countries of origin by gaining skills and engaging \r\nin economic activity. Many issues must be resolved, \r\nhowever, in order for international migration to be of \r\nbenefit to migrants and their countries of origin and \r\ndestination. Not only must countries make efforts \r\nwithin their national frameworks, but they must also \r\nengage in international cooperation. This High-level \r\nDialogue is therefore most timely, and, on behalf of the \r\nGovernment of Japan, I would like to thank the United \r\nNations for its initiative in convening it. \r\n The preamble to the Constitution of Japan states \r\nthat “[we] recognize that all peoples of the world have \r\nthe right to live in peace, free from fear and want”. \r\nThat is the basis of the idea of human security that \r\nJapan has been promoting with a view to protecting \r\npeople and giving them the power to protect \r\nthemselves. \r\n Japan believes that, in the interest of human \r\nsecurity for all people, it is important to combine the \r\nfollowing two approaches to international migration; \r\nfirst, we must protect people who have been forced to \r\nleave their homes because of threats to their welfare \r\nand also empower them, enabling them to better \r\nwithstand adversity. Second, we must protect people \r\nmigrating in search of better lives, and create \r\nenvironments where they can realize their potential in \r\naccordance with the laws and regulations of countries \r\nof destination. Taking action on both of these fronts is \r\nthe basic precondition for creating a positive link \r\nbetween migration and development, paying particular \r\nattention to the needs of women, children and other \r\nvulnerable members of society. \r\n Allow me to expand on this idea. Japan has \r\nimplemented numerous projects in other countries \r\naimed at empowering communities where people have \r\nbeen forced to flee their homes because of conflicts, \r\nnatural disasters, human trafficking, organized crime \r\nand other major threats to their safety. Those projects, \r\nwhich include aid for refugees and victims of human \r\ntrafficking, as well as advocacy activities, are being \r\nconducted with financial and technical assistance from \r\nJapan and financing from the United Nations Trust \r\nFund for Human Security, established in 1999 as the \r\nresult of a Japanese initiative to help United Nations \r\nagencies carry out activities in this area. \r\n In addition, Japan is implementing its Action Plan \r\nof Measures to Combat Trafficking in Persons, adopted \r\nin 2004 in the areas of prevention, law enforcement \r\nand protection. Japan is also exchanging views with \r\nGovernments, non-governmental organizations and \r\ninternational organizations in Asia, Europe and Latin \r\nAmerica to pursue effective ways of preventing human \r\ntrafficking. Japan is also actively participating in the \r\nBali Process, a regional framework in Asia and the \r\nPacific to help combat illegal immigration, human \r\nsmuggling and trafficking and related transnational \r\ncrimes. \r\n Migrants can contribute to the development of \r\nboth their country of origin and their country of \r\ndestination through their economic activity, their \r\ntechnical skills and capital they can provide. In order \r\nto realize such a win-win situation, however, migrants \r\nshould abide by the laws of their countries of origin, \r\ntransit and destination, under which they should at the \r\nsame time be afforded due protection. Moreover, \r\ninternational cooperation to support the development \r\nof the capacity of each individual is necessary for \r\nmigrants to obtain the maximum benefit from \r\nmigration. \r\nA/61/PV.4  \r\n \r\n06-52183 38 \r\n \r\n For those reasons, Japan has extended \r\ncooperation to developing countries with a view to \r\nenhancing human resources in education and health. \r\nFor example, Japan has offered assistance for training \r\nteachers and improving teaching manuals, curricula \r\nand textbooks. In the health sector, this cooperation has \r\ntaken the form of training medical and counselling \r\nstaff engaged in the fight against HIV/AIDS. \r\n In addition, for over 40 years the Japan Overseas \r\nCooperation Volunteers have been sent to developing \r\ncountries to participate at the grass-roots level in \r\ncommunity- and nation-building efforts. On the basis \r\nof this experience, Japan has just launched, in \r\ncooperation with the United Nations Volunteers, an \r\nAsian youth volunteers programme for Africa to \r\npromote an exchange of volunteers between the two \r\ncontinents. \r\n The issue of international migration and \r\ndevelopment is a critical global challenge. Japan \r\ntherefore regards this High-level Dialogue as a \r\nsignificant step for all of us. After it has concluded, we, \r\nthe international community, will need to deepen our \r\ndialogue and strengthen our cooperation. Japan is \r\ncommitted to working towards both of those ends. \r\n The President: I give the floor to His Excellency \r\nMr. João Gomes Cravinho, Secretary of State for \r\nForeign Affairs and Cooperation of Portugal. \r\n Mr. Cravinho (Portugal): Allow me at the outset, \r\nMadam President, to congratulate you on your recent \r\nelection, and to wish you every success as you carry \r\nout your lofty responsibilities. \r\n I would like to align myself with the statement \r\nmade earlier by the representative of Finland on behalf \r\nof the Presidency of the European Union. For Portugal, \r\nthis is a uniquely important opportunity for us to \r\ncontribute some additional views that are of particular \r\nrelevance to us. \r\n This year has witnessed a number of international \r\ngatherings devoted to the theme of migration, \r\ngatherings held in the cities of Brussels, Turin and, \r\nmost important, in July, in Rabat. Today and tomorrow \r\nwe are taking another step in this international \r\ndialogue, and before the year is out we will have had \r\nfurther opportunities to take the discussion forward. \r\n In these meetings, it has become clear that, \r\ndespite controversies and divergences of opinion, we \r\ncan identify important lines of consensus. The first \r\nconcerns the urgent need to address migration in a \r\nshared and responsible way, since the issue will not \r\nsimply disappear if it is ignored. Secondly, stable and \r\neffective responses cannot be merely national; they \r\nmust be based upon international approaches, at the \r\nregional and global levels, focusing both on South-\r\nNorth and on South-South migration flows. The third \r\nline of consensus is that sustainable responses must be \r\nmultidimensional and coherent, involving the \r\nmanagement of migration flows, the integration of \r\nmigrant communities and the promotion of \r\ndevelopment. \r\n We believe that these lines of convergence \r\nconstitute a valuable starting point for our discussions. \r\nThe Secretary-General’s report in connection with this \r\nHigh-level Dialogue (A/60/871) states, in paragraph \r\n59, that “Governments understand that their citizens \r\nworking abroad can be development assets and are \r\nstrengthening ties with them.” In this regard, we should \r\nalso recognize, as part of the growing consensus, the \r\nimportance of the great potential of diaspora \r\norganizations as an instrument of development for \r\ncountries of origin. In addition to this, we believe — \r\non the basis of our own historical experience — that \r\nthe positive impact that remittances can have upon \r\ndeveloping countries should also be included in this \r\nconsensus. \r\n Portugal recognizes that the linkages between \r\ninternational migration and development are complex. \r\nGlobalization poses great challenges for the \r\nmanagement of migration flows. But it is clear that \r\nmigration, when managed effectively, can make \r\nenormous contributions, both to the host country and to \r\nthe country of origin. It is important to bear this in \r\nmind as we develop our policy responses. Indeed, \r\nmigratory flows have been a widespread and very \r\npositive phenomenon in human history, and we must \r\nnot fall into the trap of promoting policies that focus \r\non a single aspect of migration, whatever the pressures \r\nresulting from unbalanced media portrayals may be. \r\n Migration flows must be managed in such a way \r\nthat the awarding of entry clearance for a migrant \r\nshould always be synchronized with integration \r\nmeasures that prevent social exclusion, while \r\nreinforcing fair treatment under the law for migrants \r\nand their families, for example in terms of access to \r\neducation, health care and employment within national \r\nsystems. \r\n A/61/PV.4\r\n \r\n39 06-52183 \r\n \r\n From the development perspective, it is important \r\nto focus our attention on the poorest countries, \r\nespecially those in Africa. In this context, we attach \r\ngreat importance to supporting capacity in the fields of \r\ninstitution-building, peacebuilding, conflict prevention, \r\nhuman rights, democracy and the rule of law and \r\npoverty eradication. The lack of such capacity in many \r\ncountries is one of the root causes of migration. \r\n Again, according to the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport and to civil society hearings in the context of \r\nthis High-level Dialogue, the integration of immigrants \r\nmust play a key role within national and regional \r\npolicies. The effective integration of migrant workers \r\nwithin globalized labour markets is critical. Migrant \r\ncommunities should be able to feel at home and to \r\nenjoy their rights, as well as fulfilling their duties. But \r\nthey should also be given space to preserve their \r\nidentities and keep their roots alive. \r\n In my country, we have been experiencing \r\nsubstantial growth in migration flows and its \r\ndiversification in terms of quality, which poses a very \r\ninteresting challenge for our society, as well as \r\nproviding a valuable opportunity. Our role as a host \r\ncountry for migrants — after many decades of being a \r\ncountry of origin — has led us to engage in \r\ncoordination efforts within various sectors of public \r\npolicy that have an impact upon migration. \r\n We are currently in the process of adopting a \r\nglobal and integrated migration policy that highlights \r\nthe social, economic and cultural advantages of the \r\nphenomenon without ignoring the challenges involved. \r\nWe are working towards promoting various forms of \r\nlegal immigration, with a view to further discouraging \r\nillicit entry. \r\n This new legislation being promoted by the \r\nPortuguese Government is giving special consideration \r\nto issues of flexibility related to “circular migration” \r\nflows and temporary migration visas. \r\n It also gives attention to repressing the violence \r\nresulting from all forms of trafficking in human beings, \r\nwhich affects women and children in particular. The \r\nnew migration law intensifies prevention efforts by \r\nfocusing on illegal recruitment networks and traffic in \r\nhuman beings, while at the same time implementing \r\nmeasures to provide support to the victims. As we all \r\nknow, development cannot be achieved at the expense \r\nof human rights. \r\n In our view, it is essential to have appropriate \r\nstatistical mechanisms to assess numbers, as well as the \r\ncapacity to analyse, interpret and use such data. We \r\nrecently created an observatory of migration \r\nmovements among the Portuguese-speaking countries. \r\nThe main objective of the project is to promote better \r\nknowledge of migratory realities in all the countries \r\ninvolved by sharing legislative and statistical \r\ninformation, undertaking studies in the area of \r\nmigration and asylum and creating a contact network. \r\n Our interest in these issues will continue to be \r\ndiscussed in Portugal throughout 2006 and 2007. \r\nMigrant flows from the Community of Portuguese-\r\nspeaking Countries are still very significant. For \r\nhistorical reasons, those countries are also the main \r\nrecipients of Portuguese development assistance. In \r\nrecognition of this link, in June we organized a seminar \r\nwith the International Organization for Migration \r\n(IOM) on the role of the Portuguese-speaking diaspora \r\nin promoting development in their countries of origin. \r\nIn October, Lisbon will also be hosting the important \r\nMetropolis Conference, on the special theme “Paths \r\nand Crossroads: Moving People, Changing Places”. \r\n Another new step is that Portugal and Cape Verde \r\nare in the process of institutionalizing a joint working \r\ngroup designed to define common strategies that are \r\nappropriate for the specificity of Cape Verde and \r\nimmigration in Portugal, which is also a transit country \r\nfor Cape Verde and immigrants to other countries. In \r\nshort, the group will address the issues pertaining to \r\nmigration and its multiple components. \r\n On the issue of remittances, which are private \r\nflows, we believe that more research can be done about \r\ntheir contribution to the development of countries of \r\norigin. Portugal has promoted a research study on \r\nremittances with the Inter-American Development \r\nBank, and we have further work in the pipeline on that \r\nimportant issue, with other partners. \r\n Allow me to end with a reference to two pivotal \r\narenas of dialogue on migration in which we shall \r\ninvest strongly over the coming year. The first \r\nconcerns the dialogue between Europe and Africa, \r\nwhich is an extremely appropriate framework for \r\nplacing migration issues within the broader context of \r\na strengthened EU-Africa partnership. We are therefore \r\nworking hard towards the next EU-Africa Summit. \r\n Furthermore, and bearing in mind that the High-\r\nlevel Dialogue is part of a continuing process, we \r\nA/61/PV.4  \r\n \r\n06-52183 40 \r\n \r\nconsider it important to give continuity to our work \r\nover these two days and to find the best ways of \r\nkeeping the topic on the international agenda. Thus, my \r\nGovernment will avail itself of the opportunity of \r\nholding the Portuguese Presidency of the European \r\nUnion, during the second semester of 2007, to make \r\nsure that migration remains at the forefront of our \r\nattention. \r\n The President: I give the floor to Her Excellency \r\nMrs. Judit Fazekas Lèvaynè, State Secretary of the \r\nMinistry of Justice of Hungary. \r\n Mrs. Lèvaynè (Hungary): Hungary would like to \r\nexpress its pleasure in seeing the present High-level \r\nDialogue taking place as a result of the thorough \r\npreparatory work of United Nations Member States. \r\nWe believe it is both desirable and useful to launch a \r\nmultifaceted international coordination process in the \r\nwake of this event of high symbolic importance. As a \r\npart of the process, we support every constructive joint \r\nelaboration of ideas and approaches at the bilateral, \r\nregional and, where appropriate, international \r\ncommunity level. \r\n We believe that a major task of the follow-up \r\nprocess is to boost the efficiency of cooperation among \r\ninternational organizations working with migration. \r\nHungary therefore welcomes the creation of the Global \r\nMigration Group, as an initiative integrating migration \r\nand development organizations. \r\n International migration is a remarkably \r\ndiversified and dynamically changing phenomenon. \r\nHence, Hungary’s role in migration flows has been \r\nchanging over the past one and a half decades — since \r\nits transition from a communist country to a \r\nparliamentary democracy. During that period, Hungary \r\nchanged from a country producing migrants — and \r\nduring the middle of the twentieth century, also \r\nrefugees — to a country essentially of transit and \r\nreceiving. Today, Hungary is at the crossroads of two \r\nof the four main migration routes leading to the EU: \r\nthe East and the South-East migration routes. Hungary \r\nhas very positive experiences regarding regional \r\ninitiatives and intergovernmental forms of cooperation \r\ndealing with migration. We support a multi-faceted \r\ninternational coordination process and the elaboration \r\nof an international consultative forum based on the \r\ncooperation of Governments. \r\n We are happy to work closely with all United \r\nNations Member States to cooperate on the idea of a \r\nglobal migration forum. We strongly believe that an \r\ninternational structure involving interested United \r\nNations Member States can build on the extremely \r\nimportant experiences of regional consultative \r\nprocesses. However, Hungary cannot support the \r\ncreation of another agency or organization; instead, we \r\nencourage further cooperation of already existing \r\ninternational organizations and regional initiatives. \r\n It was our pleasure to host the Global \r\nCommission on International Migration (GCIM) \r\nRegional Hearing for Europe in November 2004. I \r\nwould like to take the opportunity to thank the \r\nmembers of the Global Commission and the staff of the \r\nGCIM secretariat for their great work performed \r\nduring the elaboration of the GCIM report and \r\nthereafter. \r\n Migration issues are related to several policy \r\nareas of outstanding importance. Those areas include, \r\namong others, poverty alleviation, state sovereignty, \r\nindividual fundamental rights, global economy and \r\nemployment, environment issues and health and \r\nsecurity. It is hardly possible to cover all the \r\nconnections to those areas in a high-level discussion \r\nsuch as the present one. \r\n This High-level Dialogue has to deal with both \r\nhorizontal and more technical issues. However, it is of \r\ngreat importance to focus primarily on the practical \r\naspects of the positive connection between migration \r\nand development. Hence, we believe it is essential to \r\ncover enhancement of the development impact of \r\nmigrant remittances, sharing best practices of circular \r\nmigration schemes and coordination of the follow-up \r\nto the present event. \r\n The first discussion of migration issues under the \r\nauspices of the United Nations must present all \r\nrelevant approaches to and aspects of those issues, in \r\norder to show the colourful picture of the international \r\nmigration landscape. Although we are all familiar with \r\nthe fact that the landscape also includes numerous \r\nalarming points, I hope that, by mutual extension of \r\neach other’s viewpoints, delegations will find ways to \r\nuse migration and development issues for their \r\ncommon benefit and to produce concrete results as \r\nsoon as possible. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to Her \r\nExcellency The Honourable Teopolina Mushelenga, \r\nDeputy Minister of Home Affairs and Immigration of \r\nNamibia. \r\n A/61/PV.4\r\n \r\n41 06-52183 \r\n \r\n Ms. Mushelenga (Namibia): Madam President, \r\nallow me, on behalf of my delegation, to congratulate \r\nyou on your election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-first session. I would like to \r\nassure you of my delegation’s full support and \r\ncooperation. \r\n My delegation is very pleased to participate in the \r\nHigh-level Dialogue on International Migration and \r\nDevelopment. This important forum offers Member \r\nStates an opportunity to address one of the global \r\nchallenges facing the world today: international \r\nmigration. We welcome the opportunity to discuss and \r\nfurther reflect on these issues, which have both \r\ncommon and different implications for our countries \r\nand, indeed, for the world at large. In that regard, \r\nNamibia reiterates its full support for the African \r\nCommon Position on Migration and Development, \r\nadopted in Banjul. \r\n In the same vein, Namibia would like to align \r\nitself with the statement made by the Minister of Home \r\nAffairs of South Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 \r\nand China. \r\n Migration is multifaceted and complex, affecting \r\nand affected by human security; economic, social and \r\npolitical developments; gender inequality; and many \r\nother processes. Therefore, responses to migration \r\nmust be comprehensive, contextually appropriate and \r\ncognizant of both the contributions and effects of \r\nmigration in terms of development, security and \r\npolitical stability. It is also important to take into \r\nconsideration the fact that the majority of migrants \r\nworldwide are women and that, in many places, they \r\noutnumber male migrants. Gender inequality \r\ncontributes to the forced migration of, and trafficking \r\nin, women and girls. \r\n The foundation of Namibian immigration policy \r\nis our desire to promote development with equity and \r\nto manage migration in order to ensure that it \r\ncontributes to our overall development objectives and \r\ndoes not undermine the progress we have made so far. \r\nWe therefore seek to attract sustainable and suitable \r\ninvestment in the country, to import specific skills and \r\nto transfer them to Namibians. We also believe that \r\nthose who come can learn new skills from us that they \r\nwill eventually take with them. \r\n We are realists and therefore recognize that an \r\nimmigration policy in today’s world should also \r\naddress the security concerns of both receiving States \r\nand migrants. We will need to find ways to ensure that \r\nneither a State’s security nor its obligations to \r\nguarantee social, economic, security and safety to its \r\ncitizens are compromised. \r\n We recognize the positive effects that migration \r\ncan have on the economic development of both \r\ncountries of origin and countries of destination. \r\nHowever, we are convinced that the migration of \r\nskilled persons acts as a drain on a country of origin, \r\nbecause it results in the loss of the investment made in \r\ntheir training. We therefore hope that this High-level \r\nDialogue will provide us with the best ideas to help us \r\nformulate policy guidelines that ensure that the “brain \r\ngain” in some countries does not mean a “brain drain” \r\nin others. In that regard, we recognize the need for \r\nmore cooperation between States and non-State actors \r\nto maximize the development benefits derived from \r\nmigration. We welcome the participation of the private \r\nsector, non-governmental organizations and civil \r\nsociety in this Dialogue. \r\n Some migration is fuelled by instability and \r\nuncertainty. While many are searching for places where \r\neconomic and social conditions are better, others are \r\nsimply searching for a place where they can be safe. In \r\nthe southern African region, the asylum/migration \r\nnexus is an increasing problem. Over approximately \r\nthe past decade and a half, southern Africa has been \r\ntransformed from a sending region into a receiving \r\nregion. Namibia, with its long history of United \r\nNations support and its own experience of exile, \r\ncontinues to respect the institution of asylum and \r\nrefugee rights. At the same time, we seek to promote \r\nthe voluntary repatriation of those refugees who can \r\nreturn to countries to which stability and peace have \r\nnow returned. In the near future, we will also look at \r\nthe issue of the local integration of a yet-to-be-\r\ndetermined number of refugees — long-term residents \r\nwho no longer have ties to their countries of origin or \r\nare unable to return for other reasons and who can \r\ncontribute to our national development objectives. \r\n Namibia, along with other African countries, has \r\nbeen considering legal and normative frameworks for \r\nthe promotion of safe and managed migration. An \r\nimportant guiding instrument is the Southern African \r\nDevelopment Community Protocol on the Facilitation \r\nof Movement of Persons. That instrument, however, \r\nneeds to be buttressed by good practices. \r\nA/61/PV.4  \r\n \r\n06-52183 42 \r\n \r\n One of the recommendations of a comprehensive \r\nstudy done by the Global Commission on International \r\nMigration calls for bilateral agreements as a means to \r\naddress migration issues that affect two States. In that \r\nregard, Namibia has agreements with our neighbouring \r\nStates Angola and Zambia to allow members of \r\ncommunities along the common border to have \r\nfreedom of movement within a limited area inside each \r\ncountry, with the simple requirement of a border pass. \r\nSuch arrangements encourage cross-border trade, \r\ncultural exchanges and harmonious relations between \r\nand among States. \r\n Finally, Namibia hopes that this Dialogue will be \r\nnot an end in itself, but the beginning of multilateral \r\ndiscussions that will help the international community \r\nto find solutions to this challenging issue. This \r\nDialogue should also look at the capacity of receiving \r\nStates with a view to helping them better manage the \r\nchallenges posed by migration. In that regard, the need \r\nfor technical and humanitarian assistance for \r\ndeveloping countries should be recognized and \r\naddressed. Namibia accordingly welcomes and \r\nsupports the proposal of the Secretary-General to \r\nestablish an international forum for dialogue on \r\nmigration and development. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency The Honourable Delano Franklyn, Minister \r\nof State, Ministry for Foreign Affairs and Foreign \r\nTrade of Jamaica. \r\n Mr. Franklyn (Jamaica): It is my special honour \r\nto congratulate you, Madam, on your recent election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly. The United Nations \r\nmission to ensure gender parity is clearly bearing fruit. \r\n This Dialogue on migration and development is \r\nquite timely, and Jamaica wishes to associate itself \r\nfrom the very outset with the statement made on behalf \r\nof the Group of 77 and China on this important subject. \r\n Migration policies must be approached in a \r\ncomprehensive manner, given the multidimensional \r\nnature of the phenomenon. We should therefore avoid \r\nthe growing tendency to focus only on security and \r\nborder control issues. Other important concerns — \r\nsuch as the human rights of migrants, identifying \r\nsolutions to the negative impact of the brain drain and \r\nenhancing cooperation on issues related to migration \r\nand mobility — are among those that should also be \r\ngiven equal treatment. \r\n Over the past four decades, Jamaica has \r\nexperienced a rate of approximately 20,000 nationals \r\nmigrating annually. For Jamaica, one of the positive \r\nspin-offs of migration is the increase in receipts from \r\nremittances, growing from less than $100 million in \r\n1990 to $1.65 billion in 2005. That represents 16 per \r\ncent of Jamaica’s gross domestic product. Within the \r\nsame period, poverty was reduced from 28.4 per cent \r\nto 14.8 per cent. It can therefore be concluded that in \r\nJamaica there is a direct correlation between the \r\nreduction in poverty and the increase in the inflow of \r\nremittances. \r\n A strategy is required to maximize the continued \r\nincrease in the inflow of remittances for national \r\ndevelopment. I put forward the following policy \r\ninitiatives for consideration: first, facilitating and \r\nstimulating short-term labour migration through \r\nbilateral agreements, secondly, decreasing the costs of \r\nformal transfers by stimulating more competition in the \r\nmarket, and thirdly, developing creative synergies \r\nbetween banks and microfinance institutions. \r\n Remittances should in no way, however, be seen \r\nas a reward for the migration of trained professionals. \r\nSuch a conclusion would be wrong, since remittances, \r\nas significant as they are, cannot adequately replace the \r\nloss of skilled human resources. \r\n Jamaica and the other countries of the English-\r\nspeaking Caribbean have a very high rate of loss of \r\ntertiary-level graduates to the Organization for \r\nEconomic Cooperation and Development countries. It \r\nis estimated at over 60 per cent annually in the case of \r\nJamaica. \r\n In that context, Jamaica supports the proposal for \r\nco-development. There is a compelling case to be made \r\nfor the developed countries to make some financial \r\ncontribution to developing countries in order to offset \r\nsome of the costs incurred in the training of those \r\ngraduates. Co-development partnerships must be linked \r\nwith an element of training so that local personnel can \r\ntake over when experts leave. \r\n The growing importance of migration makes it \r\nimperative that the rights of migrants be protected. \r\nWhile there are some bilateral agreements which offer \r\nsuch protection, it remains an area of major concern to \r\nJamaica. As a result, steps are currently being taken by \r\nthe Government of Jamaica to become a party to the \r\nInternational Convention on the Protection of the \r\n A/61/PV.4\r\n \r\n43 06-52183 \r\n \r\nRights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their \r\nFamilies (1990). \r\n Gender is also a key dimension of international \r\nand regional migration. Men generally dominate initial \r\nimmigration flows and are later joined by female \r\nfamily members and children. Nearly half of all \r\ninternational migrants are women. The data for the \r\nCaribbean is consistent with that finding, where \r\nthroughout the Caribbean, women represent 52 per cent \r\nof all migrants, and men 48 per cent. \r\n The gender transformation arising from \r\nemigration is having an impact on family structures \r\nand networks. Women are vulnerable to gross abuses \r\nand exploitation, particularly those in domestic \r\nemployment, and are also more likely to suffer gross \r\nviolations of their rights. The beneficial outcomes of \r\nmigration for women critically depend on respect for \r\nthe rights enshrined in the core human rights \r\ninstruments. \r\n The Jamaican diaspora plays a significant role in \r\nnational development. The fundamental objective of \r\nthe Government of Jamaica is to identify and organize \r\nmembers of the Jamaican diaspora in the various \r\ncountries and develop a permanent and structured link \r\nwith Jamaica. One element of this is a two-yearly \r\ndiaspora conference in Jamaica. A second consists in \r\norganizing the various communities in the host \r\ncountries to allow for democratic and accountable \r\nrepresentation. Jamaica also has the intention to create \r\na joint select committee of both Houses of Parliament. \r\nThat initiative will elevate matters relating to the \r\ndiaspora to the legislative level. \r\n Jamaica is of the view that this High-level \r\nDialogue must not stop here. What is critical, however, \r\nis to build on its outcome so that talk can be followed \r\nup by action. We strongly recommend that follow-up \r\nshould promote policy research and analyses on \r\nmigration and development, with the imperative to \r\nformulate and implement appropriate actions. \r\n The President: I give the floor to His Excellency \r\nMr. Isikia Rabiei Savua, chairman of the delegation of \r\nFiji. \r\n Mr. Savua (Fiji): This first multilateral attempt \r\nto address the issues of migration and development on \r\na global level should begin with a sustained \r\nconstructive dialogue and cooperation to identify \r\nappropriate ways to accentuate benefits and remove \r\ndeleterious factors. \r\n Fiji supports meaningful efforts to promote a \r\nbalanced and comprehensive approach to international \r\nmigration and development, by building partnerships \r\nand ensuring coordinated actions to develop capacities, \r\nincluding the management of migration. \r\n The report of the Secretary-General contains a \r\nnumber of important observations. It identifies \r\nmigration as a key component of the globalization \r\nprocess. It also states that international migration is a \r\nconstructive force for development, both in countries \r\nof origin and in countries of destination, and calls for \r\nsustained dialogue. We endorse the sentiments of the \r\nSecretary-General, that international cooperation is \r\nindeed crucial, if we are to achieve a win-win situation \r\nthrough the establishment of a United Nations forum \r\nfor dialogue on international migration. We believe that \r\nsuch a forum would stimulate Governments to look at \r\nthe issues of migration and development in a holistic \r\nmanner and add value to activities undertaken at the \r\nbilateral and regional levels. \r\n The complexities and interlinkages between \r\nmigration, development and security call for careful \r\nconsideration of the impact of migration. Migration \r\npolicies should be focused on comprehensive security \r\nand must be complementary to sustainable \r\ndevelopment policies. Developing countries need \r\npragmatic solutions to their development challenges in \r\norder to ensure the attainment of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). We reiterate that poverty, \r\npopulation growth, underdevelopment and lack of \r\nopportunities contribute to the “pull and push” factors \r\nin migration. \r\n Remittances, one of the developmental impacts of \r\ninternational migration, and one which has great \r\npotential as a development impetus, should be \r\nfacilitated in a reliable, quick, economical and legal \r\nmanner. The need to address and promote conditions \r\nfor cheaper, faster and safer transfer of remittances \r\nshould be seriously addressed. However, remittances \r\nshould never be considered as a substitute for \r\ninvestment, trade, aid and debt relief to address the \r\nMDGs and underdevelopment. \r\n Allied to that is the need to strengthen the \r\ndiaspora communities and ensure their involvement in \r\nthe development process. Also important are issues that \r\nwould require our continued attention, including \r\nA/61/PV.4  \r\n \r\n06-52183 44 \r\n \r\nmanaging temporary labour migration, increasing the \r\nbenefits while mitigating the costs of the migration of \r\nskilled personnel, engaging transnational communities \r\nin the development process of countries of origin, \r\nmaking return migration an asset, the best way to \r\ncollaborate in reducing and preventing the smuggling \r\nof and trafficking in persons, benefiting from the \r\nopportunities of the globalization of education, \r\npreventing the exploitation of migrants, and the \r\nimportance of fostering a secure, regular and orderly \r\nprocess of migration. \r\n The Dialogue must ensure that ample \r\nopportunities are accorded to migrants so that their \r\nrights and freedoms are not compromised. Migrants  \r\n \r\nshould continue to be the focus of the migration \r\ndebate. Women and children constitute the majority of \r\nmigrants. They continue to be disadvantaged, and this \r\nDialogue must adopt measures to reduce their \r\nvulnerability, exploitation and abuse. \r\n Migration is a global issue and will grow in \r\nimportance. We must address it as such. We should \r\nneither downplay its significance nor ignore it \r\ncompletely, as that will only worsen an already \r\nchallenging situation. The success of the Dialogue will \r\ndepend on how we can achieve a win-win situation that \r\nbenefits the migrants and responds to the needs of both \r\nthe countries of origin and countries of destination. \r\n  The meeting rose at 7.50 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
