(Bahrain) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 18 \r\n \r\nNecessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/61/132) \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/61/L.10) \r\n \r\n  Amendment (A/61/L.19) \r\n \r\n Mr. Maqungo (South Africa): On this important \r\noccasion, the Chairman of the Group of 77 and China, \r\nAmbassador Kumalo, would have preferred to deliver \r\nthis statement himself. However, due to the fact that he \r\nis traveling, I, as Chargé, have the honour to speak on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China.  \r\n The heads of State and Government of the Group \r\nof 77 and China at the Second South Summit, held in \r\nQatar in June 2005, condemned the use of economic \r\ncoercive measures designed to prevent countries from \r\nexercising their right to decide their own political, \r\neconomic and social systems, and called on all \r\ncountries not to recognize unilateral extraterritorial \r\nlaws which impose sanctions on other States and \r\nforeign companies. The heads of State and Government \r\nalso recognized that the embargo has caused a high \r\ndegree of economic and financial damage that has \r\nnegatively impacted on the welfare and well-being of \r\nthe people of Cuba. \r\n At the thirtieth annual ministerial meeting of the \r\nGroup of 77 and China, the ministers once again firmly \r\nrejected the imposition of laws and regulations with \r\nextraterritorial impact and all other forms of coercive \r\neconomic measures, including unilateral sanctions \r\nagainst developing countries, and reiterated the urgent \r\nneed to eliminate them immediately. They emphasized \r\nthat such actions not only undermine the principles \r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and \r\ninternational law, but also severely threaten the \r\nfreedom of trade and investment. They therefore called \r\non the international community neither to recognize \r\nthose measures nor to apply them. \r\n The Group of 77 and China is guided by the basic \r\nnorms of international law and conduct in its principled \r\nsupport for the need to eliminate coercive economic \r\nmeasures as a means of political and economic \r\ncoercion. The Group of 77 and China believes that \r\nconstructive dialogue can foster mutual trust and \r\nunderstanding, as well as engender harmony and \r\npeaceful coexistence between nations. \r\n The Group of 77 and China has therefore \r\nconsistently opposed all aspects of the embargo \r\nimposed by the United States of America against Cuba. \r\nThe Group of 77 and China views the continued \r\nimposition of an economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo as a violation of the principles of the \r\nsovereign equality of States and of non-intervention \r\nand non-interference in each other’s domestic affairs. \r\n The Group of 77 and China is committed to \r\nworking towards a better world for all in which \r\nA/61/PV.50  \r\n \r\n06-60788 2 \r\n \r\nnations, no matter how large or small, coexist \r\npeacefully. The achievement of such peaceful \r\ncoexistence among nations requires adherence by all \r\nnations to the rule of law, including international law. \r\n The action by the United States of America \r\nagainst the Republic of Cuba has lasted for 49 years, \r\nwith 70 per cent of Cubans having been born under the \r\nembargo. Yet, that long-standing economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargo has been consistently rejected by \r\na growing number of Member States to the point at \r\nwhich the opposition has become almost unanimous. \r\n Thus, the need to respect international law in the \r\nconduct of international relations has been recognized \r\nby most members of this body, as has been evidenced \r\nby the growing support for the draft resolution that we \r\nare to adopt today. The States Members of the United \r\nNations have been considering this item and support \r\nhas grown steadily from 59 Member States opposing \r\nthe United States embargo of Cuba in 1992 to 182 last \r\nyear. \r\n I believe that the presence of such a large number \r\nof Member States in this Hall today and their \r\nparticipation in these deliberations are indications of \r\ntheir opposition to unilateral extraterritorial measures. \r\nThey express their firm opposition to unilateral \r\nmeasures as a means of exerting pressure on \r\ndeveloping countries, as such measures are contrary to \r\ninternational law, international humanitarian law, the \r\nUnited Nations Charter and the norms and principles \r\ngoverning peaceful relations among States. \r\n The Group of 77 and China, in accordance with \r\ninternational laws and norms, will again support the \r\ndraft resolution before us today. We do so because that \r\nrelentless and unilateral action has caused untold \r\nsuffering to the people of Cuba. Considering the \r\nimpact that this embargo has had on the every day lives \r\nof the Cuban people, it is therefore no surprise to see \r\nthat the overwhelming majority of Member States are \r\nhere today to join in the support for the Cuban people. \r\n Mr. Severin (Saint Lucia): I am honoured to \r\naddress this Assembly on behalf of the States members \r\nof the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). \r\n The Caribbean Community aligns itself with the \r\nstatement made by the representative of South Africa \r\non behalf of the Group of 77 and China. \r\n The situation affecting Cuba is of significant \r\nimportance to countries of the wider Caribbean and \r\nremains a source of continuing concern and disquiet. \r\nThe United Nations Charter is very clear regarding \r\nsuch matters as respect for the sovereign equality of \r\nStates, non-interference in the internal affairs of States, \r\nthe self-determination of peoples, the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes, and the maintenance of friendly \r\nrelations between States. For States members of the \r\nCaribbean Community, those principles constitute core \r\nelements in the conduct of our international relations, \r\nand our adherence to them is paramount. We take note \r\nof the report of the Secretary-General in document \r\nA/61/132, which contains an impressive catalogue of \r\nreplies from Member States and from United Nations \r\nbodies on the matter of the embargo against Cuba. \r\n CARICOM member States have been consistent \r\nover the years in their opposition to the embargo, \r\nwhich has caused untold hardship to the people of \r\nCuba. The introduction of new legislative and \r\nadministrative arrangements in the last few years, with \r\nthe expressed intent of strengthening the embargo, has \r\nonly served to intensify that hardship. We continue to \r\noppose this imposition of unilateral punitive measures, \r\nin particular the extraterritorial application of national \r\nlegislation. \r\n CARICOM States reaffirm the positions of the \r\nGroup of 77 and China and the Movement of Non-\r\nAligned Countries in opposing such unilateral actions. \r\nWe maintain the position that constructive engagement \r\nand peaceful negotiations remain the only acceptable \r\nmeans for advancing long-term peace and stability. \r\n Cuba is the most populous State of the Caribbean \r\nregion and an integral part of the Pan-Caribbean \r\nprocess. Caribbean ties with Cuba have historical \r\nsignificance, cemented by years of active cooperation \r\nat various levels. The member States of the Caribbean \r\nCommunity continue to maintain close relations with \r\nCuba through a wide range of programmes of \r\ncooperation in areas including trade, health care, the \r\nglobal fight against HIV-AIDS, and human resources \r\ndevelopment. \r\n The CARICOM-Cuba Joint Commission, \r\nestablished to foster mutual cooperation, remains \r\ncommitted to widening and deepening those \r\ncollaborative efforts. CARICOM continues to engage \r\nCuba in a constructive and mutually beneficial \r\npartnership that has yielded concrete benefits for the \r\npeople of the Caribbean. \r\n A/61/PV.50\r\n \r\n3 06-60788 \r\n \r\n Cuba’s assistance to CARICOM States and \r\nothers, through the assignment of health-care personnel \r\nand the provision of medical care, continues to be an \r\nimportant sign of its commitment to regional \r\ncooperation. As a small State whose economy has been \r\nsubjected to a crippling embargo over the past four \r\ndecades, Cuba continues to impress the world with its \r\nboundless capacity for providing assistance in the areas \r\nof health care and education to other countries that are \r\ndisadvantaged. \r\n CARICOM States have been beneficiaries of that \r\nassistance. Within the past year, thousands of \r\nCARICOM nationals benefited from the Cuban eye \r\ncare programme aptly called the Miracle Programme. \r\nThousands more have continued to benefit from \r\nscholarships in tertiary and professional-level \r\neducation. \r\n Cuba is an integral part of the Caribbean region \r\nand threatens no one. It should not be isolated or \r\nexcluded from participation in regional and \r\nhemispheric processes. That country’s commitment to \r\nthe social and economic development of the Caribbean \r\ncontinues to be well demonstrated. \r\n CARICOM reiterates its unwavering support for \r\nthe right of the Cuban people to self-determination in a \r\nmanner beneficial to their social and economic \r\ndevelopment. The embargo imposed against Cuba is an \r\nanachronism and serves no useful purpose in the \r\ntwenty-first century. It has served only to preserve a \r\nstate of tension between two neighbouring countries \r\nand to generate concern, disquiet and discomfort \r\nthroughout the Caribbean Basin. \r\n The Caribbean Community enjoys friendly \r\nrelations with the United States of America. In that \r\nspirit, we urge its Government to bring an end to the \r\nembargo and to engage in constructive dialogue with \r\nthe intention of normalizing relations with Cuba. Such \r\nan initiative would remove a source of tension and \r\nconflict, and significantly enhance the prospects for \r\npeace, poverty alleviation, development and \r\ncooperation within the hemisphere of the Americas. \r\n It is in that context that CARICOM States support \r\nthe contents of the draft resolution presently before the \r\nGeneral Assembly and will vote in support of its \r\nadoption. We will strongly resist any and all efforts \r\nbeing promoted to amend it. \r\n Mr. Berruga (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nGovernment of Mexico is taking the floor to reaffirm \r\nits rejection of the application of unilateral economic \r\nembargo measures. That opposition proceeds from the \r\nlegal principle, recognized in this and other \r\nmultilateral forums, that discourages the use of \r\ncoercive measures without prior authorization in \r\naccordance with the provisions established in that \r\nregard by the Charter of the United Nations. \r\n Mexico reaffirms that any kind of political, \r\neconomic or military sanctions imposed against States \r\ncan emanate only from decisions or recommendations \r\nformulated by the Security Council or the General \r\nAssembly. Likewise, our country regrets the serious \r\nhumanitarian consequences of such sanctions — \r\nsanctions that are contrary to international law and \r\nmust not stand in the way of diplomacy and dialogue, \r\nwhich are the ideal ways to resolve disputes between \r\nStates. \r\n The Government of Mexico has maintained that \r\nposition in various agencies of the United Nations \r\nsystem on the basis of the fact that the United States \r\nembargo against Cuba is a unilateral policy hampering \r\neconomic and social cooperation with that State. The \r\nreport submitted by the Secretary-General to the \r\nGeneral Assembly (A/61/132) on the implementation \r\nof resolution 60/12 cites many considerations arguing \r\nagainst the United States embargo and confirming the \r\nexistence of an overwhelming consensus regarding the \r\nneed to end that hostile practice. \r\n The damage caused by the embargo is well \r\nknown and well documented; we need only refer to the \r\nfindings of various United Nations entities and organs. \r\nThe Economic Commission for Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean has noted that the embargo imposed against \r\nCuba for more than four decades has had a negative \r\nimpact on that country’s economic, political and social \r\nlife. UNICEF specifically cites the harmful effects of \r\nthe United States embargo on Cuba’s ability to acquire \r\nthe cytostatic therapies so needed by children suffering \r\nfrom cancer. \r\n The United Nations Conference on Trade and \r\nDevelopment stresses that the extraterritorial effects of \r\nthe embargo imposed by Washington have significant \r\nconsequences for Cuba because of the influence of \r\nUnited States interests in transnational corporations. \r\nAccording to the United Nations Human Settlements \r\nProgramme, the embargo imposed against Cuba limits \r\nA/61/PV.50  \r\n \r\n06-60788 4 \r\n \r\nthe country’s access to low-cost water-treatment \r\nchemicals and equipment, which has a negative impact \r\non the environment and jeopardizes public health. \r\n For its part, the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme emphasizes that the United Nations system \r\nhas encountered difficulties and restraints in carrying \r\nout technical cooperation projects in Cuba because it is \r\nimpossible to acquire equipment and other products \r\nmanufactured in the United States or protected by that \r\ncountry’s patents. \r\n The Government of Mexico bases its bilateral and \r\nmultilateral relations on the general principles of \r\ninternational law, which regulate peaceful and civilized \r\ncoexistence among sovereign States. That is why those \r\nprinciples have remained fully valid over time with \r\nregard to the item before us. They have been \r\nconsistently reiterated since 1992, when the \r\nGovernment of the Republic of Cuba submitted to the \r\nGeneral Assembly for its consideration a draft \r\nresolution aimed at ending the economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargo. Since then, Mexico has voted in \r\nfavour of the resolutions adopted by the Assembly in \r\nthat regard. This embargo must end. \r\n Likewise, the Government of Mexico has been \r\nemphatic in opposing unilateral laws that jeopardize \r\nthe progress made towards greater cooperation, \r\nintegration and free trade. Thus, through different \r\nmechanisms, it has conveyed to the international \r\ncommunity its position against national laws with \r\nextraterritorial effects on third countries, in violation of \r\ninternational law. \r\n Mexico emphatically rejects the amendment \r\nproposed by Australia last night, since it not only \r\nignores the thrust of agenda item 18 but also appears to \r\nbe a dangerous attempt to justify an economic embargo \r\nthat clearly and flagrantly contravenes international \r\nlaw and the principles enshrined in the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n At this session of the General Assembly, Mexico, \r\nfor the fifteenth time, reiterates its support for the draft \r\nresolution on the lifting of the United States embargo \r\nagainst Cuba. It is time for that resolution, which has \r\nreceived near-unanimous support from the Assembly, \r\nto be translated into reality. \r\n The President: I should like to propose that the \r\nlist of speakers in the debate on this item be closed. \r\n I hear no objection. \r\n It was so decided. \r\n Mr. Le Luong Minh (Viet Nam): At the outset, I \r\nwould like to thank the Secretary-General for his report \r\non the implementation of resolution 60/12, entitled \r\n“Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba” (A/61/132). My delegation \r\nwarmly welcomes the presence of Mr. Felipe Pérez \r\nRoque, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of \r\nCuba, at this plenary meeting of the General Assembly. \r\nIn that connection, we align ourselves with the \r\nstatement made by the representative of South Africa \r\non behalf of the Group of 77 and China. \r\n For over four decades, the economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba has been severely hindering \r\nCuba’s economic and social development, causing \r\nnumerous hardships and difficulties for the Cuban \r\npeople. According to information provided by the \r\nGovernment of Cuba, direct economic damages caused \r\nby the embargo to the Cuban people exceed $86.1 \r\nbillion. Last year alone, damages exceeded $4.108 \r\nbillion. Those figures are indeed appalling. \r\n Because of its adverse effects on the livelihood of \r\nthe Cuban people and of its extraterritorial character, \r\nthis embargo imposed by the United States of America \r\nagainst Cuba has since 1992 been repeatedly rejected \r\nby the international community through 14 identical \r\nresolutions, adopted every year by the Assembly by an \r\nabsolute majority. \r\n The General Assembly has over the past 14 years \r\nurged the United States to put an end to this embargo, \r\nreaffirming the sovereign equality of States, the \r\nprinciples of non-intervention and non-interference in \r\ntheir internal affairs and freedom of international trade \r\nand navigation, and expressing concern at the \r\ncontinued promulgation and application by Member \r\nStates of laws and regulations, the effects of which \r\naffect the sovereignty of other States and the legitimate \r\ninterests of persons under their jurisdiction. \r\n However, despite the urging of the General \r\nAssembly and of many intergovernmental forums and \r\nbodies, the embargo has not only remained intact but \r\nhas in fact been tightened through the enforcement of \r\nlaws and provisions of a distinctly extraterritorial \r\ncharacter. The embargo, which runs counter to the \r\nfundamental principles of international law, the United \r\nNations Charter and the World Trade Organization \r\n A/61/PV.50\r\n \r\n5 06-60788 \r\n \r\n(WTO), has become the longest-ever in history. Its \r\nprolongation will only cause further tension in the \r\ncontext of the bilateral relations between the United \r\nStates and Cuba and result in further hardships and \r\ndifficulties for the Cuban people, especially those most \r\nvulnerable, such as women and children. This situation \r\nrequires an urgent solution. \r\n It remains the fundamental position of the \r\nVietnamese Government that every State has the \r\ninalienable right to determine its own political system \r\nand path of development suitable to its own specific \r\nconditions. Viet Nam believes that the differences \r\nbetween the United States and Cuba can and should be \r\nsettled through dialogue and negotiations, on the basis \r\nof mutual respect, respect for each other’s \r\nindependence and sovereignty, and non-interference in \r\neach other’s internal affairs. We believe that the \r\nnormalization and development of friendly relations \r\nbetween these two geographically close neighbours can \r\nonly serve the interests of their peoples and those of \r\nregional and international peace and security. \r\n We encourage steps in that direction, and, acting \r\nin the spirit of the 14 General Assembly resolutions \r\nmentioned earlier — most recently resolution 60/12, \r\nadopted last year — we join others in calling upon the \r\nUnited States of America to end its economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo against Cuba. \r\n Let me conclude by affirming that the Vietnamese \r\npeople’s sentiments of friendship and solidarity with \r\nthe Cuban people will be further strengthened. The \r\nVietnamese Government and people, together with \r\nother countries and peoples, will continue to do their \r\nutmost to assist the Government and the people of \r\nCuba in overcoming the effects of the embargo. \r\n Mr. Liu Zhenmin (China) (spoke in Chinese): \r\nThe Chinese delegation associates itself with the \r\nstatement made by South Africa on behalf of the Group \r\nof 77 and China. \r\n Each year for 15 consecutive years, the General \r\nAssembly has adopted a resolution urging all countries, \r\nin compliance with the Charter of the United Nations \r\nand the principles of international law, to repeal or \r\ninvalidate all laws and measures with extraterritorial \r\neffects that compromise the sovereignty of other States, \r\nundermine the legitimate rights and interests of entities \r\nand persons under the jurisdiction of those States and \r\naffect their freedom of trade and navigation. \r\nRegrettably, today, the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo against Cuba is still in place. \r\n In this age of globalization, exchanges and \r\ncooperation among countries, on an equal footing, \r\nrepresent the trend of our time. Normal economic, \r\ncommercial and financial ties among countries are in \r\nthe interest of all countries and are by no means a \r\nfavour bestowed by any one country on others. \r\nDialogue on an equal footing is the best way to resolve \r\ndifferences. \r\n For more than 40 years, an embargo and \r\nsanctions have been imposed against Cuba under the \r\npretext of promoting democracy, freedom and human \r\nrights in Cuba. But what is the reality? First, the \r\npractice of attempting to force another country to give \r\nup its independently chosen path of development, even \r\nto overthrow its Government, through an embargo and \r\nsanctions constitutes a violation of the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and of \r\nthe basic norms governing contemporary international \r\nrelations. Such practices have nothing to do with \r\npromoting democracy and freedom.  \r\n Secondly, the embargo and sanctions imposed on \r\nCuba are extraterritorial in nature and are therefore in \r\nviolation of international law and the principles, \r\nobjectives and rules of international trade. They also \r\nrun counter to the principle of trade liberalization.  \r\n Thirdly, the embargo and sanctions against Cuba \r\nhave seriously obstructed and constrained the efforts of \r\nthe Cuban people to eradicate poverty, improve their \r\nliving standards and achieve economic and social \r\ndevelopment. The embargo and sanctions pose a grave \r\nthreat to the enjoyment by the Cuban people of the \r\nrights to life and to development. \r\n The facts show that some 40 years of embargo \r\nand sanctions against Cuba have not only harmed the \r\ninterests of that country and others, thus seriously \r\nhampering development efforts at the international \r\nlevel, but also contradict the principles of democracy, \r\nfreedom, the rule of law and human rights, thus \r\ncompletely defeating the policy goals claimed by the \r\ncountry concerned. While harming others, they do not \r\nbenefit the imposer itself either. \r\n The Chinese Government always adheres to the \r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, \r\nadvocates the sovereign equality of States and non-\r\ninterference in each other’s internal affairs, and \r\nA/61/PV.50  \r\n \r\n06-60788 6 \r\n \r\nendeavours to promote democracy and the rule of law \r\nin international relations. We believe that countries \r\nshould, in the light of their specific national conditions, \r\nchoose their own political, economic, and social \r\nsystems and mode of development. We are of the view \r\nthat differences and disputes between States should be \r\nsolved through dialogue and cooperation on the basis \r\nof equality and mutual respect. \r\n In view of all that, the Chinese Government \r\nresolutely opposes the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo and sanctions imposed on Cuba. It is \r\nour hope that the country concerned will take concrete \r\nactions, engage in dialogue instead of confrontation, \r\ncarry out contacts and exchanges instead of embargo \r\nand sanctions, and implement the relevant United \r\nNations resolutions without delay. China therefore \r\nsupports the draft resolution submitted by Cuba under \r\nthe current agenda item. \r\n Mr. Godard (United States of America): The \r\nUnited States trade embargo is a bilateral issue and as \r\nsuch should not come before the General Assembly. We \r\nmaintain the embargo to demonstrate our continuing \r\ncall for economic and political freedom for all Cubans. \r\nWe maintain the embargo so that the benefits of United \r\nStates food and medical sales go to the Cuban people, \r\nnot to privileged leaders. \r\n Cuba has introduced the draft resolution claiming \r\nthat the embargo adversely affects the Cuban people, \r\ncynically asking everyone to ignore the truth that the \r\nCuban Government’s policy of systematically denying \r\nthe human, economic, labour and political rights of its \r\npeople over 47 years is the real source of the adverse \r\naffects on the Cuban people. Yet the Cuban \r\nGovernment asks that members vote to blame the \r\nUnited States for its failures. \r\n The draft resolution inaccurately blames the \r\nUnited States trade embargo for the hardships of the \r\nCuban people, while exonerating the Cuban \r\nGovernment’s own policies, which deny the right of \r\nthe Cuban people to a fair wage, to own and operate a \r\nbusiness, to buy and sell property, to freely associate \r\nand to freely express their opinions. The United \r\nNations Economic Commission for Latin America and \r\nthe Caribbean has concluded that Cuba must promote \r\nsmall business opportunities to bring life to the Cuban \r\neconomy, but the Cuban Government has refused to \r\naccept the need for the kind of free market reforms that \r\nwould bring opportunities to the Cuban people. \r\n Today’s draft resolution also inaccurately claims \r\nthat the United States embargo is a violation of \r\nfreedom of navigation. In fact, the United States \r\nembargo does not prevent the rest of the world from \r\ntrading with Cuba or providing Cuba with access to \r\nfood or medicine. In fact, since 1992, the United States \r\nhas licensed over $1.5 billion in the sale and donation \r\nof medicine and medical equipment for the Cuban \r\npeople, and over $8 billion worth of agricultural \r\ncommodities in the past years. In November 2005, the \r\nhead of Cuba’s food importing agency confirmed that \r\nthe United States was Cuba’s biggest food supplier. \r\n If the Cuban Government wants the United States \r\nto end the embargo, it knows what is needed: reforms \r\nthat will benefit the Cuban people, such as free and fair \r\nelections, an open economy, independent trade unions \r\nand a free press, to name a few. In 2002, President \r\nBush made clear that his response to such concrete \r\nreforms would be an effort with the United States \r\nCongress to ease restrictions on trade and travel \r\nbetween the United States and Cuba. However, four \r\nyears have passed and the Cuban Government has \r\nanswered the challenge for freedom only with \r\nimprisonment for human rights leaders and trade \r\nunionists. \r\n The draft resolution blames the United States \r\nembargo for the adverse impact on the Cuban people, \r\nbut does not refer to the Cuban Government’s own \r\nembargo against its people — an embargo that even \r\nprevents United Nations and international human rights \r\ninvestigators from traveling to Cuba and meeting freely \r\nwith the Cuban people. The draft resolution does not \r\ncondemn that embargo. \r\n The United States supports the right of the Cuban \r\npeople to determine their own future freely through a \r\ngenuine transition to political and economic liberty. We \r\nrecall the words of José Martí, “El Apostol”, as he is \r\nknown, who said that “only oppression should fear the \r\nfull exercise of freedom”. \r\n We will vote against the draft resolution and we \r\nencourage all delegations that support the rights of and \r\na transition to freedom for the Cuban people to do the \r\nsame. We should send a clear message to the Cuban \r\nGovernment that it is not the embargo, but rather its \r\nown denial of the basic human rights of its people, that \r\nis the cause of their suffering. \r\n Mr. Atiyanto (Indonesia): Time and again, we \r\nhave had to address the issue of ending the economic, \r\n A/61/PV.50\r\n \r\n7 06-60788 \r\n \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed on Cuba. \r\nIn reflecting on this matter, Indonesia associates itself \r\nwith the views expressed by the representative of \r\nSouth Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.  \r\n Let me thank the Secretary-General for his \r\ncomprehensive report as contained in document \r\nA/61/132. The report presents opinions of Member \r\nStates, expressing unanimously, their disagreement and \r\nopposition to the application of the unilateral and \r\nextraterritorial economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo against Cuba.  \r\n Indonesia’s long-standing position on this issue is \r\nwell known. It is based on the principle that the \r\napplication of unilateral and extraterritorial economic \r\nand trade measures runs counter to the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and contravenes international law. The \r\nprinciples of non-intervention in countries’ internal \r\naffairs and the freedom of international trade and \r\nnavigation must also be respected and upheld. \r\n The application of an economic and trade \r\nembargo has produced negative effects in the economic \r\nand social lives of innocent people, especially women \r\nand children. These measures also constitute a major \r\nimpediment to the full enjoyment of the right to \r\ndevelopment by a sovereign State and its people. They \r\nviolate human rights, considering the right to \r\ndevelopment is a basic human right, and they also \r\nundermine civil and political rights, as well as \r\neconomic, social and cultural rights.  \r\n This situation is not in line with the spirit of the \r\nglobal partnership for development as set out in the \r\nMillennium Declaration, the Monterrey Consensus and \r\nthe Johannesburg Plan of Implementation. In fact, at \r\nthe 2005 World Summit, our leaders strongly reiterated \r\ntheir determination to ensure the timely and full \r\nrealization of the development goals and objectives, \r\nincluding the Millennium Development Goals to \r\neradicate poverty. Indonesia’s position is in keeping \r\nwith those expressions of global solidarity.  \r\n Based on those principles, Indonesia will vote in \r\nfavour of draft resolution A/61/L.10 on the necessity of \r\nending the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo imposed by the United States of America on \r\nCuba. In this regard, we want, once again, to \r\nemphasize the fact that the continuation of the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo on Cuba \r\nwill only serve to maintain high tensions between the \r\ntwo neighbouring countries. This certainly will not \r\nbring us very far in our commitment to and respect for \r\nthe purposes and principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations and international law. Both of these are \r\nindispensable foundations for a more peaceful, \r\nprosperous and just world. In such situations, \r\ndemocracy has limited space within which to develop. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Felipe Pérez Roque, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Cuba, to introduce draft resolution \r\nA/61/L.10. \r\n Mr. Pérez Roque (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThis is the fifteenth consecutive occasion that Cuba is \r\nsubmitting to the General Assembly the draft \r\nresolution, entitled “Necessity of ending the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States of America against Cuba”. We do so in \r\ndefence of the rights of the Cuban people, but also in \r\ndefence of the rights of the American people and the \r\nrights of the peoples represented in this Assembly. \r\n The economic war unleashed by the United States \r\nagainst Cuba, the longest and most ruthless ever \r\nknown, qualifies as an act of genocide and constitutes a \r\nflagrant violation of international law and the Charter \r\nof the United Nations. Throughout the past 48 years, \r\nthe United States blockade has caused economic \r\ndamage to Cuba of over $86 billion. Seven in every ten \r\nCubans have, from the time of their birth, lived, \r\nsuffered from and endured the effects of the blockade, \r\nwhich attempts to defeat us through hunger and \r\ndisease. \r\n The blockade prevents Cuba from trading with \r\nand receiving tourism from the United States. It \r\nprevents Cuba from using the United States dollar in its \r\nexternal transactions and from receiving credits or \r\nengaging in operations with United States banks or \r\ntheir subsidiaries in other countries. The blockade does \r\nnot allow the World Bank or the Inter-American \r\nDevelopment Bank to give even a modest loan to \r\nCuba. \r\n But more serious than all that is that the Untied \r\nStates blockade imposes its criminal provisions on \r\nCuba’s relations with other countries that make up this \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n We have seen how the representatives of the \r\nUnited States Government have again repeated the \r\nsame fallacious arguments — the same lies as in \r\nprevious years. It is a lie when they say that this is a \r\nA/61/PV.50  \r\n \r\n06-60788 8 \r\n \r\nbilateral matter, when they say that Cuba can trade and \r\npurchase in other countries what it cannot buy in the \r\nUnited States, when they say that the United States \r\ndoes not pursue the vessels of other countries that \r\nattempt to come to Cuba and when they say that Cuba \r\nuses the embargo as a pretext. I repeat to the delegate \r\nof the United States what has been said in past years: if \r\nthe United States Government is of the view that Cuba \r\nuses this as a pretext, then why do they not remove this \r\npretext by lifting the embargo? Why do they not \r\nremove the embargo against Cuba if the United States’ \r\nopinion is that Cuba is using it as a pretext to justify its \r\nfailure? \r\n The blockade prevents Cuba from trading with \r\ncompanies based in Member States, not just United \r\nStates enterprises, but enterprises of Member States \r\nthat are subsidiaries of United States corporations. \r\nVessels with flags from Members countries cannot call \r\nat United States ports if they have previously carried \r\ngoods from or to Cuba. That is the Torricelli Act, \r\nsigned by President Bush, senior, in 1992. \r\n The United States blockade also prevents \r\ncompanies from the rest of the world — those of your \r\ncountries, fellow members — from exporting to the \r\nUnited States products containing Cuban raw materials, \r\nand it prevents those companies from exporting to \r\nCuba products or equipment containing more than 10 \r\nper cent American components. That is the truth of the \r\nmatter. The blockade pursues the businesses of other \r\ncountries, not just those of the United States. Others — \r\nyour compatriots, fellow members — who seek to \r\nmake investments in Cuba, along with their families, \r\nare threatened with refusal of entry into the United \r\nStates and they can even be brought to trial in United \r\nStates courts. That is the Helms-Burton Act of 1996. \r\n I am not going to give endless examples that \r\nprove what I have said. The Secretary-General has \r\nissued an extensive report (A/61/132), with the \r\nfeedback of 96 countries and 20 international agencies \r\nand organizations, which unequivocally reveals the \r\nhardships and shortages that the blockade imposes on \r\nthe lives and development of the Cuban people. \r\n We consider it important to inform the General \r\nAssembly about the plan for the reconquest of Cuba \r\napproved by President Bush in May 2004 and updated \r\nin July 2006. In it, we can clearly see what the United \r\nStates Government would do in our country if it ever \r\nhad it under its control. According to the President of \r\nthe United States, what is most important is to return \r\nall of the properties in Cuba to their former owners. \r\nThat would include, for example, taking the land away \r\nfrom the hundreds of thousands of farmers in Cuba \r\nwho now own their own land, either individually or in \r\ncooperatives, in order to reinstate the system of big \r\nlandowners. That would also mean evicting millions of \r\nCuban landowners from their homes in order to return \r\ntheir properties or plots of land to their former \r\nclaimants. \r\n President Bush describes this as an accelerated \r\nprocess that would be under the complete control of the \r\nUnited States Government — which, for those \r\npurposes, would set up a so-called commission for the \r\nrestitution of property rights. \r\n Another structure would also be established — a \r\nUnited States Government standing committee for the \r\neconomic reconstruction of Cuba, which would run the \r\nprocess of implementing in Cuba an extremely harsh \r\nneoliberal adjustment programme that would include \r\nthe unbridled privatization of education and health \r\nservices and the elimination of social security and \r\nwelfare. Retirement benefits and pensions would be \r\nremoved and retirees would be offered the chance to do \r\nconstruction work as part of a so-called corps of Cuban \r\nretirees. \r\n President Bush recognizes in the plan that it will \r\nnot be easy to apply the plan in Cuba. Therefore, he \r\ninstructs the State Department to create a repressive \r\napparatus as an immediate priority, which we imagine \r\nwill be trained in the brutal techniques of asphyxiation \r\nthat Vice-President Cheney does not consider to be \r\ntorture, in order to stifle the unrelenting resistance of \r\nthe Cuban people. It is even recognized that there will \r\nbe a long list of Cubans to be persecuted, tortured and \r\nmassacred. \r\n The plan even contemplates a central child \r\nadoption centre to hand over to families in the United \r\nStates and in other countries the children of those \r\nparents who lay down their lives fighting or become \r\nvictims of repression. That entire cynical and brutal \r\nprogramme to recolonize a country after destroying \r\nand invading it, would be run by a character who has \r\nalready been appointed and whose ridiculous post, \r\nreminiscent of that of Paul Bremer, is entitled Cuba \r\nTransition Coordinator: a man named Caleb McCarry, \r\nwhose only record of note is his close friendship with \r\nthe terrorist groups of Cuban origin that are still \r\n A/61/PV.50\r\n \r\n9 06-60788 \r\n \r\nmasterminding and executing from Miami, with \r\ncomplete impunity, new assassination plots and acts of \r\nsabotage against Cuba. \r\n Those are the same groups that are asking \r\nPresident Bush to release the terrorist Luis Posada \r\nCarriles, the brains behind the explosion of a Cuban \r\npassenger aeroplane, while five courageous Cuban \r\nanti-terrorist fighters have been subjected to a cruel \r\nand prolonged imprisonment in the United States since \r\n1998. \r\n Two years after its enactment, most of the plan \r\nhas already been implemented. Thus, new and greater \r\nrestrictions were imposed on family visits to Cuba by \r\nCubans resident in the United States. Americans who \r\ntravelled to Cuba were viciously persecuted. In the \r\ncourse of the last two years, more than 800 people \r\naccused of travelling to our country have been fined. \r\nAdditional constraints were imposed on the sending of \r\nremittances to Cuba. Academic, cultural, scientific and \r\nsporting exchanges have been virtually eliminated. \r\nSince 2004, 85 companies have been penalized for \r\nallegedly violating the blockade against Cuba. \r\n The fierce persecution against our country’s \r\nfinancial transactions and trade has been further \r\nintensified. There are also tangible results from the \r\ndemented worldwide tracking conducted by the so-\r\ncalled Group for the Identification of Cuban Assets on \r\neverything that appears to be a payment from or to \r\nCuba. \r\n Along with the strengthening of the blockade, in \r\nMay 2004 President Bush approved another $59 \r\nmillion to pay his scarce and disheartened mercenaries \r\nin Cuba with a view to fabricating a non-existent \r\ninternal opposition and to pay for propaganda \r\ncampaigns and illegal radio and television broadcasts \r\nagainst Cuba. But it was all in vain. President Bush \r\nrealized that time was running out and he could not \r\nkeep his promise to the extremist Cuban groups in \r\nFlorida. His domestic and foreign woes were growing \r\nand continue to grow, and socialist Cuba was and still \r\nremains upright and unrelenting. Then, on 10 July \r\n2006, President Bush added new measures to his plan. \r\n A significant aspect of the new 93-page \r\nconcoction is that it contains a secret annex, with \r\nactions against Cuba that have not been made public \r\nand which, as they explain, would not be revealed in \r\norder to achieve their effective realization and for \r\nnational security reasons. \r\n Will these include new assassination plots against \r\nCuban leaders, more terrorist acts or a military \r\naggression? From this rostrum, today, before the \r\nGeneral Assembly, we challenge President George W. \r\nBush to publicly disclose the content of that document, \r\nwhich he has not to date had the courage to reveal. The \r\nplan, of course, includes the allocation of additional \r\nmoney. This time around, it is $80 million over two \r\nyears and no less than $20 million per year until the \r\nCuban revolution is defeated — in other words, \r\nforever. There is also an increase in the radio and \r\ntelevision broadcasts against Cuba, overtly violating \r\nInternational Telecommunication Union standards. \r\n In addition, renewed efforts are being made to \r\ncreate a so-called coalition of countries to support so-\r\ncalled regime change in Cuba. The Bush plan is \r\nparticularly emphatic on the extraterritorial application \r\nof the economic war against Cuba. Thus, new \r\nmechanisms are being established to improve the \r\nmachinery that enforces the blockade regulations and \r\nnew sanctions are being adopted. \r\n One that stands out for its novelty is the criminal \r\nprosecution of violators. Title III of the Helms-Burton \r\nAct authorizes the filing of lawsuits in United States \r\ncourts against foreign investors in Cuba, particularly \r\nthose from countries supporting the continuance of the \r\nCuban revolution. \r\n More stringent enforcement of title IV is also \r\nenvisaged. This would deny entry into the United \r\nStates of investors in Cuba and their families; the \r\npersecution is aimed in particular at those investing in \r\noil prospecting and extraction, tourism, nickel, rum and \r\ntobacco. As a tool to track down sales of Cuban nickel \r\nto other markets — not just to the United States \r\nmarket, but to businesses in other countries represented \r\nhere as well — a so-called inter-agency Cuban nickel \r\ntask force was created. \r\n The siege is being tightened on exchanges \r\nbetween American and Cuban churches, and there is a \r\nban on humanitarian donations to Cuban religious \r\norganizations. \r\n But one new blockade measure approved by \r\nPresident Bush deserves particular comment. The \r\ndocument states that the United States will deny all \r\nexports of medical equipment that can be used in \r\nhealth-care programmes for foreign patients. That is, \r\nthe United States Government, which has always gone \r\nout of its way to cause the failure of Cuba’s \r\nA/61/PV.50  \r\n \r\n06-60788 10 \r\n \r\ninternational medical cooperation programmes, now \r\nadmits that its persecution may even reach the point of \r\ntrying to block Cuba’s purchase of necessary \r\nequipment from other parts of the world.  \r\n I must emphasize again that the embargo has \r\nreached the point of prohibiting exchanges between \r\nUnited States churches and Cuban churches. Churches \r\nin the United States are being forbidden from sending \r\ndonations, medicines or other supplies for \r\nhumanitarian use to their counterpart churches in Cuba. \r\nPresident Bush’s blockade against Cuba has thus even \r\ndeclared war on United States and Cuban churches, \r\ntrying to thwart the will of God. Secondly, it seeks to \r\nprevent Cuba from buying medical equipment for \r\ninternational medical cooperation programmes.  \r\n Some background information is essential here. \r\nSince 1962, the year in which Cuban doctors rendered \r\nassistance abroad for the first time, in Algeria, nearly \r\n132,000 Cuban doctors, nurses and health technicians \r\nhave provided services in 102 countries. At present, \r\n31,000 Cuban health workers are rendering services in \r\n69 countries; of those, 20,000 are physicians. Yes, \r\n31,000 health workers are providing care in 69 \r\ncountries; in many of the countries represented here. \r\n A medical brigade specializing in catastrophes and \r\nemergency situations was established on 19 September \r\n2005, in the midst of the scourge visited upon 2 million \r\npoor people and black people in the southern United \r\nStates by the combined force of Hurricane Katrina and \r\nof the Government’s irresponsibility and insensitivity. \r\nThe brigade is composed of 10,000 members who are \r\nappropriately trained and equipped, and it bears the \r\nname of a young American, Henry Reeve, who \r\ngloriously laid down his life in 1873 in the Cuban \r\ncountryside as a general in our liberation army. At the \r\nfounding of the brigade, more than 1,500 Cuban \r\ndoctors were ready to leave for the most ravaged areas \r\nand save who knows how many lives — lives which \r\nwere lost after President Bush’s refusal to receive \r\nthem. \r\n A total of 2,564 members of this brigade worked \r\nfor eight months in Pakistan in the wake of the \r\nearthquake there. They set up 32 field hospitals that \r\nwere later on donated to that brother nation. They \r\ncared for 1.8 million patients and saved 2,086 lives. \r\nSubsequently, a further 135 Cuban healers rendered \r\nassistance in Indonesia and set up two field hospitals, \r\nwhich were also donated. They treated 91,000 patients \r\nand performed 1,900 surgeries. Cuban doctors had \r\npreviously worked in disaster areas, such as Peru in \r\n1970, Venezuela in 1999, Sri Lanka and Indonesia in \r\n2004 and Guatemala in 2005, to give but a few \r\nexamples. \r\n If President Bush were to succeed in his cynical \r\nplan, Cuba would be prevented from offering its \r\nmodest and generous effort to other peoples, many of \r\nwhom are represented here, in a field where nobody \r\nquestions our development and experience. \r\n Since 2004, Cuba has been implementing \r\nOperation Miracle, through which nearly 400,000 \r\npatients from 28 countries, not including some 100,000 \r\nCubans, have been operated on, free of charge, and \r\nhave recovered their eyesight. Our country alone could \r\nnot defray all of the relevant expenses, but Cuban \r\ndoctors, technicians, technology and equipment have \r\nlaid the groundwork to operate on 1 million Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean people every year. \r\n If the American offensive were to succeed in \r\ncurtailing this endeavour, an equivalent number of \r\npeople suffering from more than 20 eye diseases would \r\nlose their eyesight. The United States Government \r\nknows this, but it does not give up on its gruesome \r\nplan to stifle Cuba. And here I am speaking only of \r\nthose treated for their eyesight, and not the hundreds of \r\nmillions of people benefiting from the comprehensive \r\nhealth-care programmes conducted by the Cuban \r\ninternationalist doctors. \r\n Cuba is not only providing medical services. It is \r\ncurrently providing training to more than 46,000 young \r\nmedical students from 82 nations of the third world, \r\neither in Cuba or in their own countries. \r\n Cuba will not surrender. Nor will it falter in \r\nadvancing these humane endeavours, which signify \r\nthat a world of peace, justice and cooperation is \r\npossible. Cuba’s commitment to the rights of all the \r\nworld’s dispossessed is stronger than the hatred of the \r\nexecutioners. \r\n Millions of Cubans are now awaiting the decision \r\nthat this Assembly will take. We ask you, delegates of \r\nMember States, today to support respect for Cuba’s \r\nrights, which is also respect for the rights of the \r\npeoples that you represent. \r\n We ask you to vote in favour of the draft \r\nresolution entitled “Necessity of ending the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the \r\n A/61/PV.50\r\n \r\n11 06-60788 \r\n \r\nUnited States of America against Cuba”. We do so with \r\nour heads held high, with optimism and confidence, \r\nand with the hope of repeating the verses sung by a \r\npoet of our generation, Silvio Rodriguez, because in \r\nCuba \r\n “Nobody is going to die, \r\n “Our whole life is our good-luck talisman, \r\n “It is our cloak. \r\n “Nobody is going to die, \r\n “Certainly not now when the anthem of the \r\nHomeland is our song.” [excerpt from Preludio \r\nde Girón] \r\n And if they impose a war on us, there will not be \r\nenough soldiers in the United States to cover the \r\ncasualties that they would endure in a country that has \r\nresisted and has been preparing its defence for over 45 \r\nyears. \r\n This is the statement I had prepared in submitting \r\nour draft resolution. However, an unprecedented \r\nincident in this Assembly compels me to add a few \r\nremarks. For the first time since 1992, when the \r\nAssembly began considering the issue of the blockade \r\nagainst Cuba, the United States Government is trying \r\nto sabotage this vote through an amendment. After \r\nseveral weeks of exerting brutal pressure, the United \r\nStates realized that it could not reverse the \r\noverwhelming support generated by this draft \r\nresolution. It then attempted to talk a large number of \r\ndelegations into abstaining, and it failed. Then, it \r\nthreatened and blackmailed others to reject it, and it \r\nfailed again. It finally decided to boycott this vote in \r\norder to divert attention from the main issue, which is \r\nits embargo against Cuba, which is a flagrant violation \r\nof international law, and it decided that the Australian \r\ndelegation would submit the draft amendment prepared \r\nin Washington. \r\n I have here the talking points distributed by the \r\nUnited States on Monday, 6 November, seeking \r\nsupport for an amendment that Australia only presented \r\nas its own yesterday, Tuesday, 7 November, in the \r\nafternoon. It is curious that the delegation of the \r\nUnited States requests support in this paper for an \r\namendment that Australia had not even decided as yet \r\nto submit. The United States tried to get one of the \r\nEuropean Union countries to present it, but it did not \r\nsucceed. It sought support in other countries, but it \r\ncould not muster support there either. Finally, a very \r\nhigh-level call from Washington to the Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Australia determined that Australia \r\nwould serve as the lackey to submit the United States \r\namendment. \r\n Is this amendment an expression of genuine \r\nconcern by Australia? No, it is not. It is merely \r\nindicative of its abject submission to the United States \r\nGovernment. Besides, Australia does not have the \r\nmoral authority to refer to the human rights situation in \r\nCuba. The Australian Government is an accomplice to \r\nUnited States imperialism. It is some sort of “pocket \r\nimperialism”, always ready in the Pacific to follow its \r\nWashington mentors. Thus, not only did it cooperate \r\nwith and send troops, along with the United States \r\nArmy, to the war in Viet Nam, in which 4 million \r\nVietnamese lost their lives, but it also participated \r\nenthusiastically with over 2,000 soldiers in the \r\ninvasion of Iraq, an absolutely illegal preventive war. \r\nStill today, some 1,300 Australian soldiers remain in \r\nIraq on the ground, even though a mere 22 per cent of \r\nthe Australian population supports this venture. \r\n The Australian Government, which subjects the \r\ncountry’s aboriginal population to a real apartheid \r\nregime, does not have the moral authority to criticize \r\nCuba. The Australian Government, which supports the \r\ntorture centre of the United States in Guantánamo and \r\nwhich supported the summary trials in military \r\ntribunals against the prisoners that were harassed and \r\ntortured there, including Australian prisoners, does not \r\nhave the moral authority to criticize Cuba. Much less \r\nso does the United States. We all saw the appalling \r\nimages from the Abu Ghraib prison and the heinous \r\nimages from Guantánamo. We know that they have \r\norganized and still maintain clandestine prisons and \r\nsecret flights on which they have carried drugged and \r\nhandcuffed prisoners. We saw the horrendous images \r\nof hurricane Katrina, when human beings were doomed \r\nto die because they were black, because they were \r\npoor. After everything we now know, this Assembly \r\ncannot be deceived or manipulated. \r\n Therefore, on behalf of Cuba, we ask you, ladies \r\nand gentlemen, to vote first in favour of the no action \r\nmotion that we will present in order to oppose the \r\namendment proposed by Australia and, later, to vote in \r\nfavour of draft resolution A/61/L.10 submitted by \r\nCuba. \r\n The United States representative has raised in his \r\nspeech before this Assembly the sacred name of José \r\nMartí, the apostle of Cuban independence, and, in \r\nA/61/PV.50  \r\n \r\n06-60788 12 \r\n \r\ndoing so, he stained this glorious name of a man who \r\nsaid that the war waged in Cuba for independence was \r\nto prevent the imposition of United States control over \r\nthe islands of the Caribbean. Our delegation takes \r\noffence at the use of the name of José Martí to justify \r\nthe embargo. I would remind the General Assembly, \r\nand in particular the delegation of the United States, \r\nthat José Martí also said that trenches of ideas are more \r\nvaluable than trenches made of stone. It is trenches of \r\nideas that have made the noble, generous and heroic \r\npeople I represent here invincible. \r\n Mr. Ja’afari (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): I would like at the outset to associate my \r\ncountry, the Syrian Arab Republic, with the statement \r\ndelivered by the Permanent Representative of South \r\nAfrica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. \r\n The purposes and principles of the United \r\nNations Charter underscore the right of States to \r\nexercise sovereignty over their own territory and the \r\nrule of non-interference in the internal affairs of other \r\nStates. All United Nations Member States, especially \r\nthe major Powers that contributed to the drafting of the \r\nCharter and who themselves suffered the bitterness of \r\nNazi and fascist interference in their affairs and \r\nencroachment on their sovereignty during the Second \r\nWorld War, are expected to respect the Charter more \r\nthan other States, because the Charter is the \r\nconstitution of this Organization and its ultimate frame \r\nof reference. \r\n The unilateral embargo imposed by the United \r\nStates against Cuba and the new measures aimed at \r\ntightening this embargo are in contradiction with the \r\nCharter and the principles of international law, in \r\nparticular the principles of equal sovereignty among \r\nStates, non-interference in their internal affairs and free \r\ninternational trade and navigation. Thus, the embargo \r\ninevitably becomes illegal and contradicts the criteria \r\nagreed on by the international community regarding \r\nrelations among States. \r\n The embargo imposed against Cuba some 48 \r\nyears ago set a precedent for unilateral behaviour by \r\nMember States outside the framework of international \r\nlaw. The embargo has subjected Cuba to economic, \r\npolitical and social losses of every kind; it has \r\nentrenched the suffering of the Cuban people, \r\nespecially children and the elderly; and it has had an \r\nimpact on the Cuban people’s intensive efforts to \r\nachieve well-being and prosperity. The embargo \r\ncontinues to harm the Cuban economy, which has \r\ndirectly lost some $86 billion, in addition to tens of \r\nbillions of dollars in indirect losses. Moreover, the \r\nembargo continues to harm the social and cultural \r\ndevelopment of the Cuban people. It has also deprived \r\nthe Cuban people of the opportunities and benefits of \r\ntrade. The embargo directly violates the basic freedoms \r\nand human rights of the Cuban people, including the \r\nright to live in dignity and the right to development. \r\n My delegation commends Cuba’s continued \r\nefforts to conduct a constructive dialogue with the \r\nUnited States of America in order to settle all issues \r\nunder dispute between the two countries on the basis of \r\nequal sovereignty, mutual respect, non-interference in \r\nthe internal affairs of States, and respect for the \r\nprinciples and purposes of the United Nations Charter \r\nand for the principle of good-neighbourliness. My \r\ndelegation believes that normalization of relations \r\nbetween the United States and Cuba would be in the \r\ninterest of the peoples of the two countries.  \r\n Syria underscores the right of peoples freely to \r\nselect their own political, economic, social and cultural \r\nsystems, in accordance with international law. The \r\nsupport of 182 States for resolution 60/12 at the \r\nprevious session is a clear indication of the \r\ndetermination of the overwhelming majority of the \r\ninternational community to end the unjust embargo \r\nimposed against Cuba and to emphasize the need to \r\nrespect the national political, economic and social \r\nsystems that every country selects of its own free will \r\nin accordance with its own national interests. \r\n In that regard, we would like to recall the Final \r\nDocument of the recent Conference of heads of State or \r\nGovernment of the Non-Aligned Movement, held in \r\nHavana. Heads of State or Government again called \r\nupon the United States of America to put an end to the \r\nunilateral economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nagainst Cuba. It also expressed the concern of the \r\ncountries of the Non-Aligned Movement over the \r\nwidening of the embargo against Cuba and the \r\ncontinuous new legislative measures aimed at \r\nintensifying the embargo.  \r\n We would also like to recall the Doha \r\nDeclaration, adopted by the developing countries at the \r\nGroup of 77 and China’s Second South Summit, held \r\nin Qatar in 2005, in which the Summit categorically \r\nrejected laws and regulations with extraterritorial \r\nimpact and all other forms of coercive economic \r\n A/61/PV.50\r\n \r\n13 06-60788 \r\n \r\nmeasures. The Summit expressed grave concern over \r\nthe negative impact of economic sanctions on the \r\ndevelopment capacity of targeted countries. It made a \r\nspecial appeal in the name of all the leaders of the \r\ndeveloping countries for the immediate lifting of the \r\nembargo against Cuba. \r\n The international community has repeatedly \r\nexpressed its rejection of the unilateral sanctions against \r\nCuba and their extension by the so-called Helms-Burton \r\nAct adopted by the United States. That act extends the \r\njurisdiction of United States national legislation and \r\nencroaches on the sovereignty of other States that deal \r\nwith Cuba. This is incompatible with the principle of \r\nthe sovereign equality of States and with international \r\nlaw. Syria also condemns the recent expansion of \r\naggressive United States policies against Cuba, \r\nincluding through the threat of use of military force, in \r\nclear violation of the Charter of the United Nations. \r\n Despite all the previous appeals by the General \r\nAssembly over the past 15 years, the United States \r\nGovernment has not yet taken any steps to respond to \r\nthe will of the international community. Moreover, the \r\nUnited States intentionally and stubbornly continues its \r\nincorrect disregard for the legitimate requests of the \r\ninternational community.  \r\n Furthermore, the United States has imposed new \r\nmeasures to tighten the embargo on independent, \r\nsovereign Cuba. The behaviour of the United States of \r\nAmerica and the measures it takes pose a clear threat to \r\nthe independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial \r\nintegrity of Cuba; this directly threatens stability in the \r\nregion and constitutes a blatant threat to international \r\npeace and security. \r\n The Security Council and the General Assembly, \r\nin accordance with their mandates, are called upon to \r\ntake all necessary measures to put an end to the \r\nembargo, the economic sanctions and the hostile \r\npolicies and measures of the United States both against \r\nits neighbouring countries and against other Member \r\nStates geographically distant from the United States. In \r\nthat regard, my delegation hopes that all elements of \r\nthe embargo imposed by the United States against \r\nCuba will be lifted and that the international \r\ncommunity’s voice, as expressed by the General \r\nAssembly and other bodies, will be heeded and \r\ncomplied with by the United States. My country, Syria, \r\nwill therefore vote in favour of the draft resolution. \r\n Mr. Raghavan (India): We associate ourselves \r\nwith the statement made by South Africa on behalf of \r\nthe Group of 77 and China. The embargo and sanctions \r\nimposed by the United States against Cuba have been \r\nin place for over four decades and have been a subject \r\nof discussion in the General Assembly for 15 \r\nsuccessive sessions. \r\n The embargo has had an impact on Cuban efforts \r\nto eradicate poverty, improve livelihoods and promote \r\nsocio-economic development. It has also hindered the \r\nfull enjoyment of human rights, such as the right to \r\ndevelopment, and the right to food, medical care and \r\nsocial services which, despite these constraints, are of \r\na high order.  \r\n The American Association for World Health \r\nconcluded that with regard to its impact on the Cuban \r\nhealth system, the embargo caused a significant rise in \r\nsuffering, with patients going without essential drugs, \r\nor doctors performing medical procedures without \r\nadequate equipment. The embargo also continued to \r\nhave an impact on food aid deliveries. The negative \r\nimpact of the embargo in the educational sector is \r\nlinked to trade restrictions that prevent the purchase of \r\nneeded imports at more competitive prices. \r\n The embargo and sanctions have limited Cuba’s \r\naccess to markets, capital, technology and investment \r\nand are not in conformity with multilateral trading \r\nregimes and cannot be justified even under the \r\n“essential security interests” exception clause of the \r\nWorld Trade Organization’s General Agreement on \r\nTrade in Services. \r\n Under normal conditions, Cuba and the United \r\nStates would be natural economic partners, benefiting \r\nmutually from trade. It is our understanding that a \r\nconsiderable part of United States businesses would \r\nlike to take advantage of the Cuban market. Imports of \r\nUnited States food and agricultural products, which \r\naccount for 13 per cent of total Cuban imports of food \r\nand agricultural products, reflects the impact of the \r\nUnited States legislation enacted in 2000 that eased \r\nfood and medical sanctions against Cuba. According to \r\nsome estimates, the potential loss to United States \r\nbusiness ranges between $1 billion to $15 billion. \r\n The General Assembly has rejected laws and \r\nregulations with extraterritorial impact and all other \r\nforms of economic coercion. The Assembly has \r\nadopted resolutions urging all countries to comply with \r\nthe Charter and principles enshrined in legal \r\nA/61/PV.50  \r\n \r\n06-60788 14 \r\n \r\ninstruments and to repeal or invalidate all laws and \r\nmeasures that carry extraterritorial effects, bearing on \r\nthe sovereignty of other States, the legitimate rights \r\nand interest of peoples or entities under their \r\njurisdiction, and the freedom of trade and navigation. \r\nSanctions, irrespective of their purpose, have to \r\ncomply with the international legal principles of non-\r\nintervention and proportionality. \r\n We share the view expressed by the countries \r\nwhich have reiterated their opposition to the \r\nextraterritorial aspect of the economic embargo that \r\nwas implemented in accordance with the 1992 Cuban \r\nDemocracy Act (the so-called “Torricelli Law”), and \r\nthe 1996 Helms-Burton Act, through which the \r\nextraterritorial reach of the embargo encompasses \r\nforeign companies as well as foreign subsidiaries of \r\nUnited States companies doing business with Cuba. \r\n Mr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair. \r\n India, one of the largest democracies in the \r\nworld, has consistently opposed any unilateral \r\nmeasures by countries which impinge on the \r\nsovereignty of another country, including any attempt \r\nto extend the application of a country’s laws \r\nextraterritorially to other sovereign nations. India \r\nbelieves that efforts to consolidate endeavours in \r\ncreating and strengthening an economic environment \r\ncapable of providing equal opportunities to all \r\ncountries are required and that the international \r\ncommunity needs to redouble its efforts to have an \r\nenvironment free from sanctions and embargoes. \r\n Mr. Gharibi (Islamic Republic of Iran): At the \r\noutset, my delegation would like to fully associate \r\nitself with the statement made by the representative of \r\nSouth Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.  \r\n There is no doubt that the blockade is in violation \r\nof the internationally agreed principles governing \r\nrelations among States, such as the sovereign equality \r\nof States, non-intervention in their internal affairs, and \r\nfreedom of international trade and navigation. As my \r\ndelegation has reiterated in previous statements, \r\nunilateral coercive economic policies and measures \r\nshould be regarded as major impediments to the \r\ninternational community in pursuing its common \r\ncauses and interests. Such measures run counter to the \r\npromotion of cooperation and partnerships which is \r\nrequired for the creation of a favourable environment \r\nfor the benefit of all at the international level. \r\n The reports of the Cuban Government on the \r\nimpact of the embargo clearly indicate that such \r\nunilateral measures have been conducive to further \r\ndisparities in the areas of health, economy, education \r\nand training, trade, tourism, civil aviation, and even \r\ncultural activities. The adoption of 14 consecutive \r\nresolutions up to 2005 by the United Nations General \r\nAssembly is the reaction of the international \r\ncommunity to such measures.  \r\n These resolutions call upon all States to refrain \r\nfrom applying laws and measures of this kind and take \r\nnecessary steps to repeal or invalidate them as soon as \r\npossible. The reason is crystal clear. Resorting to \r\nembargo as a tool to achieve political objectives \r\nundermines the collective efforts of Member States for \r\nachieving economic growth and sustainable \r\ndevelopment at national, regional and international \r\nlevels. \r\n I would also like to recall that the Johannesburg \r\nPlan of Implementation called upon States to refrain \r\nfrom any unilateral measure as contravening \r\ninternational law and the United Nations Charter, and \r\nas impeding the full achievement of economic and \r\nsocial development by the population of the affected \r\ncountries, in particular women and children.  \r\n The Johannesburg Plan also indicates that such \r\nunilateral measures hinder the well-being of the \r\naffected people and create obstacles to the full \r\nenjoyment of their human rights, including the right of \r\neveryone to a standard of living adequate for their \r\nhealth and well-being, a right to food, medical care and \r\nnecessary social services. \r\n The Johannesburg Plan of Implementation also \r\nstipulates that States should cooperate to promote a \r\nsupportive and open international economic system \r\nthat would lead to economic growth and sustainable \r\ndevelopment in all countries. It adds that trade policy \r\nmeasures for environmental purposes should not \r\nconstitute a means of arbitrary unjustifiable \r\ndiscrimination in international trade. \r\n The 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution \r\n60/1) reaffirmed the commitment of all countries to \r\nensure that developing countries participate fully in the \r\nworld trading system in order to meet the needs of their \r\neconomic development. The Summit of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement, held in September 2006 in \r\nHavana, Cuba, reiterated its position on this issue. The \r\nSummit called upon the Government of the United \r\n A/61/PV.50\r\n \r\n15 06-60788 \r\n \r\nStates of America to put an end to the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo against Cuba, \r\nwhich, in addition to being unilateral and contrary to \r\nthe purposes and principles of the United Nations \r\nCharter, international law and the principle of good-\r\nneighbourliness, is causing huge material losses and \r\neconomic damage to the people of Cuba. \r\n My delegation believes that resorting to \r\nunjustifiable economic coercive measures against other \r\nStates on the basis of political criteria is not acceptable \r\nto the international community. The extraterritorial \r\napplication of internal laws creates an antagonistic \r\nenvironment in international relations and adversely \r\naffects world peace and security. Such political acts \r\nwith economic implications continue to restrict \r\ninvestment, trade, employment, technology transfer \r\nand the prospects for economic growth not only of the \r\ntargeted countries but also of other countries. \r\n We hope that those Member States which \r\ncontinue to apply unilateral coercive economic laws \r\nand measures will take the necessary steps to repeal or \r\ninvalidate them at the earliest opportunity. \r\n Mr. Hamidon (Malaysia): At the outset, my \r\ndelegation would like to associate itself with the \r\nstatement made earlier by the representative of South \r\nAfrica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. We \r\nwould also like to express our appreciation to the \r\nSecretary-General for his report (A/61/132) on this \r\nsubject. \r\n Since the initiation of resolutions on this item 15 \r\nyears ago, the international community has \r\ncontinuously demonstrated that it rejects the use of \r\nunilateral measures by one Member of this \r\nOrganization to effect political change in another. The \r\nfact that last year 182 countries supported resolution \r\n60/12, as compared to the 179 that supported resolution \r\n59/11 in 2004, may be taken to be an indication of the \r\nunwavering, and indeed strengthening, position of the \r\ninternational community in this regard. \r\n Laws, particularly extraterritorial legislation, \r\nsuch as the Torricelli and the Helms-Burton Acts, have \r\nbeen formulated by the United States with the sole \r\npurpose of hurting Cuba and its people, including the \r\nmost vulnerable segments of the population. It is clear \r\nthat, by limiting Cuba’s access to markets, capital, \r\ntechnology and investment, these laws exert pressure \r\non Cuba to change its political and economic \r\norientation, which, the United States hopes, will in turn \r\nbring about regime change in Cuba. \r\n It is also clear that these laws, by virtue of their \r\nextraterritorial and unilateral nature, clearly contravene \r\nuniversally accepted principles of international law, \r\nincluding the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nFurthermore, the embargo is also inconsistent with the \r\nDeclaration on Principles of International Law \r\nconcerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation Among \r\nStates in accordance with the Charter of the United \r\nNations. Given the illegal nature of these laws and the \r\nembargo, Malaysia is fundamentally opposed to them. \r\n This unilateral embargo clearly has had serious \r\nconsequences for the Cuban people and their economy. \r\nIt has been estimated that, for last year alone, direct \r\neconomic damage caused by the unilateral embargo \r\nwas to the tune of $4.2 billion. Cumulative damages to \r\nthe Cuban economy have been estimated to be in the \r\nregion of $86.1 billion. In addition, the unilateral \r\nembargo is a serious obstacle to the full enjoyment of \r\nthe rights of the Cuban people to life, health, food and \r\neducation, to name but a few. \r\n But the damage is not confined to Cuba alone. \r\nThe embargo is detrimental to the interests of other \r\ncountries, such as Malaysia, which adheres to the \r\nprinciple of friendly relations among countries. \r\nCertainly, efforts to exploit fully the potential benefits \r\narising from stronger and deeper bilateral relations \r\nbetween Malaysia and Cuba have been stymied by the \r\nimposition of this measure. \r\n Ironically, the imposition of these laws is also \r\ndetrimental to the way in which the international \r\ncommunity at large views the United States. It gives \r\nthe impression that the United States is willing to \r\ncontinuously act in contravention of international law \r\nand global public opinion against a country that poses \r\nno direct threat to it. It reduces the United States’ \r\nmoral clout on issues that are important to them and to \r\nmany other countries, including Malaysia. These issues \r\ninclude free and fair trade, as well as the promotion \r\nand protection of human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms. \r\n As a country that enjoys excellent bilateral \r\nrelations with both the United States and Cuba, we \r\nwould like to urge the former to look beyond the \r\nconfines of vested interests, rethink its overall \r\napproach towards Cuba and evolve its policy from one \r\nA/61/PV.50  \r\n \r\n06-60788 16 \r\n \r\nof isolating its smaller neighbour to one of dialogue \r\nand accommodation. \r\n Malaysia once again reaffirms its strongest \r\ncommitment to respect fully the principles of \r\ninternational law. For this reason, and for the practical \r\nreasons outlined earlier, Malaysia will continue to \r\nreaffirm its solidarity with the Cuban people by \r\nsupporting and, once again, voting in favour of the \r\ndraft resolution (A/61/L.10) on this subject. \r\n Mr. Mbuende (Namibia): My delegation \r\nassociates itself with the statement delivered by the \r\nrepresentative of South Africa on behalf of the Group \r\nof 77 and China. \r\n My delegation has come here again for what has, \r\nover the past 15 years, become virtually an annual \r\njudicial pilgrimage to vote in favour of draft resolution \r\nA/61/L.10, entitled “Necessity of ending the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States of America against Cuba” — or rather to \r\npass a verdict on the Torricelli and Helms-Burton Acts. \r\nThese Acts have been sentenced to judicial death many \r\ntimes in the past. Why have they not been executed or \r\nscrapped from the law books? Experts are unanimous \r\nin their belief that those Acts not only contradict \r\ninternational law but also cannot stand the test of time \r\nin terms of the United States of America’s own legal \r\ntradition. \r\n There is a striking consensus among the \r\ndeveloped and developing countries. Many countries \r\nwent out of their way to enact laws that would militate \r\nagainst the impact of the Helms-Burton Act. In \r\ndemocratic societies, if a law is as unpopular as the \r\nones that gave rise to the draft resolution that we are \r\ndebating today, it is common practice to either repeal \r\nor amend it. The irony of those Acts is that they keep \r\non coming back, with a vengeance, extending their \r\nprovisions to new areas. But that does not make them \r\nacceptable. \r\n Namibia will today vote in favour of this draft \r\nresolution — not only as an expression of solidarity \r\nwith the people of Cuba but above all in defence of the \r\nsovereignty of so many nations on which the terms of \r\nthe embargo encroaches. \r\n Namibia is committed to the principle of freer \r\ntrade and the movement of the factors of production \r\ninternationally. The world order we are working \r\ntowards is underpinned by the greater participation of \r\nall countries, in particular developing countries, in the \r\nglobal economy, by increasing their share of world \r\ntrade and access to capital flows. We cannot associate \r\nourselves with a law or initiative that goes against that \r\ntrend.  \r\n Namibia believes in the autonomy of market \r\nforces to do business anywhere, on the basis of \r\ncommercial viability. We do not believe in undue \r\npolitical interference in the market place. In fact, the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo against \r\nCuba represents unjustifiable interference, having \r\nraised the cost of doing business not only with Cuba, \r\nbut also in third countries. This is a threat to a healthy \r\nbusiness environment. How many countries did not \r\nhave to incur costs to pass domestic legislation to \r\nprevent the application of the Helms-Burton Act? \r\n Namibia is equally concerned with the impact of \r\nthe embargo against Cuba on the plight of the poor. \r\nAny hardship imposed on a people, whether by natural \r\ncalamities or politics, affects the poor and vulnerable \r\ngroups in any society. That is certainly true of Cuba. \r\nHowever, the embargo is a blow not only to the poor in \r\nCuba, but also in Africa and Latin America. \r\n Let us put ourselves in the position in the poor in \r\nmany African villages where the only doctor is from \r\nCuba. I cannot help but go back some 30 years to the \r\nsmall town of Arusha, in Tanzania, where I needed \r\ndental attention and where the only dentist was from \r\nCuba. Did anybody ask himself or herself what the \r\nimpact would be of the withdrawal of Cuban doctors \r\nfrom many African countries? Cuba, notwithstanding \r\nits own challenges, has been and continues to be an \r\nimportant partner of many African countries in the \r\nstruggle against poverty. The embargo has had much \r\nfurther-reaching implications than one would imagine.  \r\n It is important that the embargo be brought to an \r\nend, because it is politically unjustifiable, \r\ncommercially costly and antidevelopment. It is against \r\nthat background that my delegation urges the United \r\nStates Government to heed the international call and to \r\nimplement the General Assembly resolutions. It is in \r\nthe interests of all of us, including the Governments of \r\nthe United States and Cuba, that measures be taken to \r\nnormalize relations between the two countries. \r\n Mr. Mombo (United Republic of Tanzania): My \r\ndelegation fully associates itself with the statement \r\nmade by the representative of South Africa on behalf of \r\nthe Group of 77 and China.  \r\n A/61/PV.50\r\n \r\n17 06-60788 \r\n \r\n Today marks the fifteenth year since this item \r\nwas introduced into the General Assembly agenda for \r\ndeliberation. The economic embargo imposed on the \r\nGovernment and people of Cuba is in its forty-eighth \r\nyear — one of the longest in contemporary times. \r\n As in the past, the Government of the United \r\nRepublic of Tanzania takes the floor to join other \r\nMember States in calling for the lifting of the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nunilaterally imposed against Cuba. The country has \r\nendured the embargo valiantly but at a forbidding cost. \r\n The embargo, as we all know, has been \r\nparticularly damaging to the Cuban population, \r\nparticularly the most vulnerable category: women, \r\nchildren and the elderly. It need not be so. The \r\nembargo needs to be terminated. \r\n Like many other countries, we are concerned that \r\nthe sanctions imposed under the Helms-Burton Act \r\nexceed the jurisdiction of national legislation and \r\nencroach on the sovereignty of other States that deal \r\nwith Cuba. We therefore deem the Act to be \r\nincompatible with the principle of the sovereign \r\nequality of States. The embargo is a systematic \r\ncollective punishment in violation of human rights and \r\ninternational law. It runs counter to all prevailing moral \r\nand ethical values, as innocent people suffer. The \r\nextraterritorial nature of the embargo continues to \r\ncause considerable damage to Cuba as well as to third \r\ncountries, which are prevented from taking full \r\nadvantage of the opportunities offered by the Cuban \r\neconomy. \r\n Tanzania reaffirms its continued support to and \r\ncooperation and solidarity with the people of Cuba and \r\nsupports the draft resolution being submitted for \r\nadoption by this Assembly.  \r\n In view of the fact that the embargo has caused \r\nsignificant suffering to the people of Cuba, we call on \r\nthe United States Government to end it and normalize \r\nrelations with Cuba in the interests of all the people of \r\nCuba and of the United States of America. That may \r\nprove to be the most constructive way of reconciling \r\ndecades old differences and promote a positive spin-off \r\nfor the region and the world. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nPermanent Representative of Australia to introduce the \r\namendment to draft resolution A/61/L.10, contained in \r\ndocument A/61/L.19. \r\n Mr. Hill (Australia): In every session since 1982, \r\nthe Assembly has consistently adopted resolutions on \r\nthe necessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba. Australia, in common with the \r\noverwhelming majority of Member States, has \r\nsupported those resolutions for many years. Australia \r\nbelieves that the trade embargo of Cuba is wrong and \r\nshould be lifted immediately for the benefit of the \r\npeople of Cuba and of the rules-based international \r\ntrading system, which we strongly support. \r\n Having said that, we recognize the reasons that \r\nmotivated the embargo — concerns valid then and still \r\nvalid today — about the lack of political freedom and a \r\nfailure to meet internal human rights obligations by the \r\nGovernment of Cuba. In the past, we, as well as others, \r\nhave made explanations of vote detailing our concerns \r\nabout such human rights situations, but to no avail. \r\nYear after year, there have been those who have made \r\nsuch statements, but it has not led to change.  \r\n There is simply no point in repeating the same \r\npractice year after year. Therefore, this year we \r\npropose a different approach — that the General \r\nAssembly adopt an amended resolution that, on the one \r\nhand, calls for an end to the embargo but, on the other \r\nhand calls upon Cuba to improve its human rights \r\nperformance. This can be done through the adoption of \r\nan amendment that we circulated yesterday and that is \r\nnow being distributed as draft amendment A/61/L.19. \r\nIt would insert a new operative paragraph after \r\noperative paragraph 3.  \r\n It reads:  \r\n  “Noting that such laws and measures were \r\nmotivated by valid concerns about the continued \r\nlack of democracy and political freedom in Cuba, \r\ncalls upon the Cuban Government to release \r\nunconditionally all political prisoners, cooperate \r\nfully with international human rights bodies and \r\nmechanisms, respect the Universal Declaration of \r\nHuman Rights and comply fully with its \r\nobligations and all human rights treaties to which \r\nit is a State party.” \r\n The advantage is that the General Assembly has \r\nthe opportunity for a win-win outcome, saying that we \r\nwant to see an end to the embargo but also saying that \r\nthe people of Cuba, who do not have the opportunity of \r\nfree political expression, deserve better. \r\nA/61/PV.50  \r\n \r\n06-60788 18 \r\n \r\n The price of speaking up and asking for nothing \r\nmore than is reasonable is to be abused by the Cuban \r\nMinister with false allegations and offensive language. \r\nIt is no wonder others are not prepared to take such \r\nactions, but it does underline the necessity for an \r\namendment of this type. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I give \r\nthe floor to the representative of Cuba, who wishes to \r\nspeak on a point of order. \r\n Mr. Malmierca Díaz (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nAs the Foreign Minister of Cuba has already stated, we \r\nwould like to put forward a no-action motion regarding \r\nthe amendment contained in document A/61/L.19 \r\nunder rule 74 of the rules of procedure of the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n The amendment to draft resolution A/61/L.10, \r\ndrafted by the United States and submitted by \r\nAustralia, is contrary to the letter and the spirit of the \r\nsuccessive resolutions adopted by the General \r\nAssembly that have demanded the lifting of the unjust \r\nand illegal embargo against the people of Cuba. The \r\ndraft amendment, far from facilitating compliance with \r\nthe rightful demand by the international community \r\nthat an end be put to such an extraterritorial policy, \r\nwhich clearly contravenes the norms and principles of \r\ninternational law, is but a pretext to continue and \r\nintensify the unilateral embargo by the United States \r\nagainst the people of Cuba. \r\n If the Bush Administration and Governments \r\nsubordinate to its imperialist policy against the Cuba \r\nnation had any genuine concern regarding human rights \r\nin our country, they should have addressed it in the \r\nThird Committee or the Human Rights Council. But \r\nthey do not dare to hold a face-to-face debate on this \r\nsubject. What is being attempted today is to legitimize \r\na supposed right of the powerful to impose unilateral \r\ncoercive measures that contravene international law, \r\nusing any pretext available. \r\n What is at stake today is the defence of the norms \r\nand principles of international law and the protection \r\nof multilateralism against the dominance of force and \r\ninjustice. \r\n Guided by our firm conviction that even to \r\nconsider the amendment put forward by Australia at the \r\nurging of the United States would be to go against the \r\nvery basis of international relations, as enshrined in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, Cuba reiterates that it \r\nhas decided to put forward a no-action motion on the \r\nproposed amendment contained in document \r\nA/61/L.19, under rule 74 of the rules of procedure of \r\nthe General Assembly. \r\n Cuba requests that the Assembly consider this no-\r\naction motion and requests all States to support it. \r\nCuba further requests a recorded vote in this respect. \r\n The Acting President: The representative of \r\nCuba has moved, within the terms of rule 74 of the \r\nrules of procedure, that no action be taken on the \r\namendment contained in document A/61/L.19. \r\n Rule 74 reads as follows: \r\n  “During the discussion of any matter, a \r\nrepresentative may move the adjournment of the \r\ndebate on the item under discussion. In addition \r\nto the proposer of the motion, two representatives \r\nmay speak in favour of, and two against, the \r\nmotion, after which the motion shall be \r\nimmediately put to the vote.” \r\n Mr. Godard (United States of America): The \r\nannual General Assembly resolution condemning the \r\nUnited States bilateral embargo against Cuba \r\ninaccurately attributes the suffering of the Cuban \r\npeople to the embargo. The resolution does not speak \r\nat all to the adverse impact on the Cuban people of the \r\nCuban Government’s own policies, which deny them \r\nbasic human, labour, political and economic rights. \r\n This year we believe it is especially important for \r\nthe international community to speak up on behalf of \r\nthe Cuban people and recognize that the best hope for \r\nimproving the lives of the Cuban people is for the \r\nregime to pursue a transition to democracy and allow \r\nthe Cuban people full enjoyment of their human, \r\neconomic, labour and political rights. \r\n We oppose this no-action motion in order to help \r\npreserve the General Assembly as a meaningful forum \r\nin which to address human rights issues. No-action \r\nmotions, which encourage the United Nations to turn a \r\nblind eye to even the most egregious violators of \r\nhuman rights, undermine the effectiveness of this body. \r\nIt is not in our collective interest for the General \r\nAssembly to be seen as the protector and apologist of \r\nregimes that abuse human rights. \r\n We will vote against this motion and urge other \r\ndelegations to do the same. \r\n A/61/PV.50\r\n \r\n19 06-60788 \r\n \r\n Mr. Maqungo (South Africa): The delegation of \r\nCuba has put forward a no-action motion. Let me \r\nreiterate that, when South Africa spoke on behalf of the \r\nGroup of 77, we stated that, at the thirtieth annual \r\nGroup of 77 and China ministerial meeting, the G-77 \r\nministers firmly rejected the imposition of laws and \r\nregulations with extraterritorial impact and all other \r\nforms of coercive economic measures, including \r\nunilateral sanctions against developing countries, and \r\nreiterated the urgent need to eliminate them \r\nimmediately. They emphasized the fact that such \r\nactions not only undermine the principles enshrined in \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and international law, \r\nbut also severely threaten freedom of trade and of \r\ninvestment. They therefore called on the international \r\ncommunity to neither recognize those measures nor to \r\napply them. \r\n The amendment proposed by the delegation of \r\nAustralia is not acceptable to the South African \r\ndelegation, because it asks of us to abdicate our \r\nresponsibility of defining our own democracy and what \r\nconstitutes political freedom. The amendment notes \r\nthat such laws and measures were motivated by valid \r\nconcerns about the continued lack of democracy and \r\npolitical freedom in Cuba. Surely, if we are to abdicate \r\nour responsibility to define what constitutes democracy \r\nand what constitutes political freedom vested in one \r\nState and also to vest any State with the right to pass \r\nextraterritorial laws, that will certainly not be a win-\r\nwin situation for the Assembly, but a lose-lose \r\nsituation. For that reason, South Africa will vote in \r\nfavour of a no action motion. \r\n Mr. Liu Zhenmin (China) (spoke in Chinese): \r\nThe contents of Australia’s amendment are not new to \r\nus. It distorts the purpose of draft resolution A/61/L.10. \r\nSince 1992 the General Assembly has been adopting \r\nconsecutive resolutions urging countries concerned to \r\nend the economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nagainst Cuba. That fully reflects the preponderant view \r\nof the international community on the issue. \r\n We believe the General Assembly should reject \r\nthe amendment. Therefore, the Chinese delegation is in \r\nfavour of Cuba’s motion to take no action on the \r\nAustralian amendment.  \r\n Mr. Hill (Australia): Not surprisingly, I am \r\nopposed to the motion of no action, and I respectfully \r\nsuggest that there is a confusion between the merits of \r\nthe amendment I have moved and the right to have it \r\ndebated.  \r\n The representative of South Africa has just \r\nargued that each of us has the right to define our own \r\ndemocracy. That might be so, but each of us is also \r\nobliged to comply with the terms of the Charter, the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and the major \r\nconventions to which we are party. The amendment I \r\nam seeking to have debated in effect calls upon Cuba \r\nto do just that.  \r\n I would suggest that a failure to appreciate the \r\nlinkage between the embargo as it is now in place and \r\nCuba’s failure to meet its international obligations \r\nunder the Human Rights Convention is a failure to \r\naccept reality. There is, in fact, a clear linkage. We are \r\nprepared to put the case forward for our amendment if \r\nwe are given the opportunity. But to not be permitted \r\nthat opportunity in this Hall of debate, I would \r\nrespectfully argue, is not to be given the opportunity to \r\nlook at the totality of the issue. The totality of the issue \r\nis clearly whether there is merit in the embargo. That \r\ncalls into play the issue of Cuba’s human rights record, \r\nand therefore a debate upon that would determine how \r\nnation States might be prepared to vote on the \r\nembargo. \r\n We would argue that there is a linkage, that the \r\nissue of Cuba’s human rights record is important and \r\nthat it could be debated in the Third Committee, as was \r\nsuggested by the representative of Cuba. We take that \r\nsuggestion on board. But it is also possible to seek to \r\namend other relevant motions to give the Assembly the \r\nopportunity to debate an issue of such importance. We \r\nare taking that opportunity today. \r\n I remind the Assembly that all we are asking is \r\nthat it call upon the Cuban Government to release \r\nunconditionally all political prisoners, to cooperate \r\nfully with international human rights bodies and \r\nmechanisms and to respect the Universal Declaration \r\nof Human Rights and to comply fully with its \r\nobligations under all human rights treaties to which it \r\nis a State party. \r\n We are not calling upon Cuba to in any other way \r\nto meet an obligation for which it might have \r\ndiscretion. We are simply calling upon it to meet the \r\nobligations that we all accept, and on that basis to \r\njustify the removal of the embargo and to give all of us \r\ngreater comfort in supporting the removal of the \r\nA/61/PV.50  \r\n \r\n06-60788 20 \r\n \r\nembargo as addressed in the draft resolution before us \r\ntoday. \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly has thus \r\nheard two delegations speaking in favour and two \r\ndelegations speaking against the motion put forward by \r\nCuba. \r\n In accordance with the rules of procedure I shall \r\nnow put to the vote the motion submitted by the \r\nrepresentative of Cuba to take no action on the \r\namendment thereto contained in document A/61/L.19. \r\nIn submitting its motion, the representative of Cuba \r\nalso requested that a recorded vote be taken. \r\n The Assembly will now vote on the motion put \r\nforward by Cuba not to take action on the amendment \r\ncontained in document A/61/L.19.  \r\n A recorded vote was taken. \r\nIn favour: \r\n Algeria, Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, \r\nArmenia, Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Bahrain, \r\nBangladesh, Barbados, Belarus, Belize, Bhutan, \r\nBolivia, Botswana, Brazil, Brunei Darussalam, \r\nBurkina Faso, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, \r\nCape Verde, Central African Republic, Chad, \r\nChile, China, Colombia, Comoros, Congo, Costa \r\nRica, Cuba, Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea, Democratic Republic of the Congo, \r\nDjibouti, Dominica, Dominican Republic, \r\nEcuador, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, \r\nEthiopia, Fiji, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Grenada, \r\nGuinea, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, \r\nIndia, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), \r\nJamaica, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kuwait, \r\nKyrgyzstan, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, \r\nLebanon, Lesotho, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, \r\nMadagascar, Malawi, Malaysia, Maldives, Mali, \r\nMauritania, Mauritius, Mexico, Mongolia, \r\nMozambique, Myanmar, Namibia, Nauru, Nepal, \r\nNiger, Nigeria, Oman, Pakistan, Panama, Papua \r\nNew Guinea, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Qatar, \r\nRussian Federation, Rwanda, Saint Kitts and \r\nNevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the \r\nGrenadines, Sao Tome and Principe, Saudi \r\nArabia, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, \r\nSingapore, Solomon Islands, Somalia, South \r\nAfrica, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Suriname, Swaziland, \r\nSyrian Arab Republic, Tajikistan, Thailand, Togo, \r\nTrinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, \r\nTurkmenistan, Tuvalu, Uganda, Ukraine, United \r\nArab Emirates, United Republic of Tanzania, \r\nUruguay, Uzbekistan, Venezuela (Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of), Viet Nam, Yemen, Zambia, \r\nZimbabwe \r\nAgainst: \r\n Albania, Andorra, Australia, Austria, Belgium, \r\nBenin, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, \r\nCanada, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, \r\nDenmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, \r\nGermany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, \r\nIsrael, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, \r\nLuxembourg, Malta, Marshall Islands, \r\nMicronesia (Federated States of), Moldova, \r\nMonaco, Montenegro, Netherlands, New Zealand, \r\nNorway, Palau, Poland, Portugal, Republic of \r\nKorea, Romania, San Marino, Serbia, Slovakia, \r\nSlovenia, Spain, Sweden, the former Yugoslav \r\nRepublic of Macedonia, United Kingdom of \r\nGreat Britain and Northern Ireland, United States \r\nof America \r\nAbstaining: \r\n Kiribati, Liechtenstein, Samoa, Switzerland, \r\nTonga \r\n The motion for no action was adopted by 126 \r\nvotes to 51, with 5 abstentions. \r\n [Subsequently, the delegation of Benin informed \r\nthe Secretariat that it had intended to vote in \r\nfavour.] \r\n The Acting President: Since the motion for no \r\naction has been adopted, no action will be taken on the \r\namendment contained in document A/61/L.19. We will \r\ntherefore proceed to consider draft resolution \r\nA/61/L.10. \r\n Before giving the floor to the speakers in \r\nexplanation of vote before the vote, I would like to \r\nremind delegations that explanations of vote are \r\nlimited to 10 minutes and should be made by \r\ndelegations from their seats. \r\n Ms. Lintonen (Finland): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the European Union. Albania, \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Iceland, \r\nMoldova, Montenegro, Norway, Romania, Serbia, the \r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Turkey and \r\nUkraine align themselves with this explanation of vote. \r\n Regarding the no-action motion, the European \r\nUnion voted against, on the basis of the EU’s long-\r\n A/61/PV.50\r\n \r\n21 06-60788 \r\n \r\nstanding opposition to the use of no-action motions, \r\nwhich it considers contrary to the spirit of dialogue.  \r\n As for the substance of this issue, the European \r\nUnion believes that the United States trade policy \r\ntowards Cuba is fundamentally a bilateral issue. \r\nNevertheless, the EU and its member States have \r\nclearly expressed their opposition to the extraterritorial \r\nextension of the United States embargo, such as that \r\nprovided for in the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 and \r\nthe Helms-Burton Act of 1996. \r\n The European Union cannot accept the fact that \r\nunilateral measures imposed by the United States on \r\nspecific countries limit the Union’s economic and \r\ncommercial relations with third countries — in this \r\ncase, Cuba. Therefore, in November 1996, the Council \r\nof Ministers of the European Union adopted a \r\nregulation and joint action to protect the interests of \r\nnatural or legal persons resident in the EU against the \r\nextraterritorial effects of the Helms-Burton legislation, \r\nprohibiting compliance with that legislation. \r\n Moreover, on 18 May 1998, at the European \r\nUnion-United States Summit in London, a package was \r\nagreed upon that included waivers to Titles III and IV \r\nof the Helms-Burton Act, a commitment by the United \r\nStates Administration to resist future extraterritorial \r\nlegislation of that kind, and an Understanding with \r\nRespect to Disciplines for the Strengthening of \r\nInvestment Protection. The EU continues to urge the \r\nUnited States to implement its side of the 18 May 1998 \r\nUnderstanding. \r\n The European Union’s policy towards Cuba is \r\nclear and was set out in a Common Position in 1996. \r\nThe objective of the EU in its relations with Cuba is to \r\nencourage a pacific process of transition, led by the \r\nCuban people, to pluralist democracy and respect for \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as to \r\nsustainable economic recovery and improvement in the \r\nliving standards of the Cuban people. The European \r\nUnion underlines that it is willing to cooperate with \r\nCuba in those fields on the basis of a dialogue with the \r\nCuban Government and Cuban civil society as soon as \r\nthe Government shows the political will to engage in a \r\ndialogue aimed at tangible results, especially in the \r\nfield of human rights. Member States most recently \r\nreaffirmed their commitment to that Common Position \r\non 12 June 2006. \r\n The European Union believes that critical \r\nengagement with the Cuban Government, alongside \r\ndialogue with wider Cuban civil society, is the most \r\neffective way to promote peaceful change in Cuba. \r\nHowever, the EU considers that full cooperation with \r\nCuba will depend upon improvements in the areas of \r\nhuman rights and political freedom in that country. The \r\nEU remains deeply concerned about the human rights \r\nsituation in Cuba. \r\n The EU also remains deeply concerned about \r\ncases in which representatives of the peaceful \r\nopposition and of civil society have been intimidated \r\nand harassed in order to repress critical voices. In \r\naddition, family members of political prisoners have \r\nbeen victims of so-called acts of repudiation. There \r\nremain prisoners who have been neither charged nor \r\ntried, and people suspected of sympathizing with the \r\nbanned political opposition have been detained and \r\nsentenced under the provisions of the Penal Code on \r\n“pre-delictive dangerousness”. The EU urges the \r\nCuban Government to unconditionally release all \r\npolitical prisoners and to refrain from carrying out acts \r\nagainst members of their families. We appeal to the \r\nCuban authorities to cooperate fully with international \r\nhuman rights bodies and mechanisms — especially the \r\nPersonal Representative of the High Commissioner for \r\nHuman Rights on the situation of human rights in \r\nCuba. \r\n The Cuban Government’s achievements in health \r\ncare and education are undermined by its restrictions \r\non civil, political and economic rights. The domestic \r\nCuban economic policy and the economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargo imposed by the United States \r\nseriously hamper the economic development of Cuba, \r\nnegatively affecting the standards of living of the \r\nCuban people. \r\n With regard to the United States of America, we \r\nexpress our rejection of all unilateral measures against \r\nCuba that are contrary to commonly accepted rules of \r\ninternational trade, and reiterate our view that the \r\nlifting of the United States trade embargo would open \r\nCuba’s economy, to the benefit of the Cuban people. \r\nWith regard to Cuba, the European Union urges the \r\nCuban authorities to bring about real improvements in \r\nall the fields that I have mentioned. \r\n For all of those reasons, and despite its serious \r\ncriticism of Cuba’s human rights record, the European \r\nUnion will unanimously vote in favour of draft \r\nresolution A/61/L.10. \r\nA/61/PV.50  \r\n \r\n06-60788 22 \r\n \r\n Mr. Maksimychev (Russian Federation) (spoke \r\nin Russian): The Russian Federation has consistently \r\nsupported the position that it is inadmissible to carry \r\nout unilateral measures of an extraterritorial nature in \r\ninternational relations. We believe that in today’s \r\nworld, any attempt to isolate individual countries is \r\ncounterproductive. Russia, like the absolute majority of \r\nUnited Nations Member States, decisively condemns \r\nthe United States embargo against Cuba and favours a \r\nswift lifting of that embargo.  \r\n At every session of the General Assembly since \r\n1994, Russia has supported resolutions entitled \r\n“Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba”. We are convinced that ending \r\nthe embargo and normalizing the relations between the \r\nUnited States and Cuba would generally help to \r\nimprove the situation in Cuba and further integrate the \r\ncountry into global economic processes.  \r\n Guided by those considerations, and expressing \r\nsolidarity with the will repeatedly expressed by the \r\noverwhelming majority of Member States, Russia \r\nbelieves it is essential to support the draft resolution \r\nrequiring a lifting of the embargo and normalization of \r\nthe relations between the United States and Cuba, \r\nwhich would serve the interests of the peoples of Cuba \r\nand the United States and have a positive effect on the \r\noverall situation in the region of Central America and \r\nthe Caribbean and the world as a whole. Therefore, we \r\nwill once again vote in favour of the draft resolution at \r\nthe present session of the General Assembly. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in explanation of vote. \r\n The Assembly will now proceed to take action on \r\ndraft resolution A/61/L.10. A recorded vote has been \r\nrequested. \r\n A recorded vote was taken. \r\nIn favour: \r\n Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Andorra, Angola, \r\nAntigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Armenia, \r\nAustralia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Bahrain, \r\nBangladesh, Barbados, Belarus, Belgium, Belize, \r\nBenin, Bhutan, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, \r\nBotswana, Brazil, Brunei Darussalam, Bulgaria, \r\nBurkina Faso, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, \r\nCanada, Cape Verde, Central African Republic, \r\nChad, Chile, China, Colombia, Comoros, Congo, \r\nCosta Rica, Croatia, Cuba, Cyprus, Czech \r\nRepublic, Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea, Democratic Republic of the Congo, \r\nDenmark, Djibouti, Dominica, Dominican \r\nRepublic, Ecuador, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, \r\nEritrea, Estonia, Ethiopia, Fiji, Finland, France, \r\nGabon, Gambia, Georgia, Germany, Ghana, \r\nGreece, Grenada, Guatemala, Guinea, Guinea-\r\nBissau, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Hungary, \r\nIceland, India, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic \r\nof), Ireland, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Jordan, \r\nKazakhstan, Kenya, Kiribati, Kuwait, \r\nKyrgyzstan, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, \r\nLatvia, Lebanon, Lesotho, Liberia, Libyan Arab \r\nJamahiriya, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, \r\nLuxembourg, Madagascar, Malawi, Malaysia, \r\nMaldives, Mali, Malta, Mauritania, Mauritius, \r\nMexico, Moldova, Monaco, Mongolia, \r\nMontenegro, Morocco, Mozambique, Myanmar, \r\nNamibia, Nauru, Nepal, Netherlands, New \r\nZealand, Niger, Nigeria, Norway, Oman, \r\nPakistan, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, \r\nPeru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, \r\nRepublic of Korea, Romania, Russian Federation, \r\nRwanda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint \r\nVincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, San Marino, \r\nSao Tome and Principe, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, \r\nSerbia, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Singapore, \r\nSlovakia, Slovenia, Solomon Islands, Somalia, \r\nSouth Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Suriname, \r\nSwaziland, Sweden, Switzerland, Syrian Arab \r\nRepublic, Tajikistan, Thailand, the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Timor-Leste, \r\nTogo, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, \r\nTurkey, Turkmenistan, Tuvalu, Uganda, Ukraine, \r\nUnited Arab Emirates, United Kingdom of Great \r\nBritain and Northern Ireland, United Republic of \r\nTanzania, Uruguay, Uzbekistan, Vanuatu, \r\nVenezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), Viet Nam, \r\nYemen, Zambia, Zimbabwe \r\nAgainst: \r\n Israel, Marshall Islands, Palau, United States of \r\nAmerica \r\nAbstaining: \r\n Micronesia (Federated States of) \r\n Draft resolution A/61/L.10 was adopted by 183 \r\nvotes to 4, with 1 abstention (resolution 61/11). \r\n A/61/PV.50\r\n \r\n23 06-60788 \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I shall now give the floor \r\nto those representatives who wish to speak in \r\nexplanation of vote on the resolution just adopted. \r\n I would like to remind delegations that \r\nexplanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and \r\nshould be made by delegations from their seats. \r\n Mr. Tarrago (Brazil) (spoke in Spanish): I have \r\nthe honour to speak on behalf of the countries members \r\nof MERCOSUR — Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, \r\nVenezuela and Brazil — and the associated States \r\nBolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. \r\n As has been our practice in previous years, the \r\ncountries members of MERCOSUR and the associated \r\nStates voted in favour of the resolution that has just \r\nbeen adopted. The General Assembly reaffirms the \r\nneed to end the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo imposed against Cuba. The international \r\ncommunity reaffirms its support for multilateralism \r\nand its rejection of unilateral coercive measures. \r\n The message is clear. The embargo against Cuba \r\nis contrary to the principles of international law and the \r\npurposes and principles of the Charter, to which we are \r\nall committed. Nor is it in conformity with the \r\nmultilateral rules of trade or the legal obligations of the \r\nmembers of the World Trade Organization. \r\n The extraterritorial application of domestic laws \r\ndoes not contribute to the promotion of democratic \r\nvalues or to dialogue among sovereign States. On the \r\ncontrary, it can lead to increased polarization and \r\nconfrontation. The embargo has been rejected by the \r\nGeneral Assembly, as well as by other international \r\nforums and bodies, including the Organization of \r\nAmerican States, the Latin American Economic \r\nSystem, the Ibero-American Summit and the Rio \r\nGroup. \r\n The countries of MERCOSUR and the associated \r\nStates joined in the rejection by the international \r\ncommunity of the promulgation and implementation of \r\nsuch unilateral coercive and extraterritorial measures. \r\nOur countries have demonstrated once more their \r\nsupport for multilateralism as the only just and \r\neffective way of resolving disputes among States and \r\npromoting understanding, security, human rights and \r\ncooperation. \r\n Mr. Abdalhaleem (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): My \r\ndelegation aligns itself with the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of South Africa, who spoke on behalf of \r\nthe Group of 77 and China. \r\n For more than four decades, the Cuban people \r\nhave been suffering as a result of the devastating \r\neffects of the embargo imposed unilaterally by the \r\nUnited States against their country. That is a flagrant \r\nviolation of the principles of the Charter, which calls \r\nfor anchoring the values of cooperation, equality, \r\nfraternity, justice and solidarity, as well as respect for \r\npeoples’ freedom of choice. Consolidation of the \r\nprinciples of the rule of law, rejection of oppression \r\nand hegemony, respect for human rights, in particular \r\nthe right to development, are all at the very heart of our \r\nOrganization’s mission, and all Member States should \r\nseek to strengthen them. \r\n For the fifteenth consecutive year, the General \r\nAssembly has considered the item entitled “Necessity \r\nof ending the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo imposed by the United States of America \r\nagainst Cuba”. Today, 183 countries voted in favour of \r\nthe draft resolution, which seeks to end the embargo, \r\nthus making absolutely clear how serious it is when a \r\ncountry arrogates to itself the right to impose unilateral \r\nsanctions. The embargo against Cuba is unjust and \r\nconstitutes a violation of the fundamental principles of \r\nthe Charter, as well as of the rules of international law \r\nand the principles that govern and organize economic, \r\ntrade and financial relations among countries.  \r\n The continuation of the embargo runs counter to \r\nthe reform effort that is now under way in the United \r\nNations, and represents a denial of the unanimity of the \r\nMember States regarding the need to promote and to \r\ntranslate into reality the principles underlying that \r\neffort to replace confrontation with cooperation and \r\nrespect for the right of peoples to choose their own \r\npolitical, economic and social systems. \r\n Despite the fact that the international community \r\nhas constantly reaffirmed the need to end the embargo, \r\nthe Cuban people are continuing to suffer greatly. \r\nIndeed, their suffering increased last year as a result of \r\nthe tightening of the embargo, which is now \r\nextraterritorial in nature. Restrictions against financial \r\ntransactions of Cuban citizens and of their moneys \r\nhave been further tightened in a draconian manner. \r\nAttempts are now being made to deter foreign \r\ninvestors, banks and corporations from establishing \r\ncommercial and financial relations with Cuba. All of \r\nthat is happening in blatant disregard of the will of the \r\nA/61/PV.50  \r\n \r\n06-60788 24 \r\n \r\ninternational community and General Assembly \r\nresolutions. \r\n Since 1997, my country too has been suffering \r\nbecause of unilateral economic sanctions as a result of \r\nsuch unjustifiable policies, as have other countries. In \r\nthe Sudan, we know full well the seriousness of such \r\nmeasures and their terrible and cruel consequences. We \r\nvery much understand the losses suffered by Cuba and \r\nthe magnitude of suffering inflicted on the Cuban \r\npeople because of the embargo. We would like to take \r\nthis opportunity to reaffirm our solidarity with the \r\nfriendly people and Government of Cuba. We reaffirm \r\nour rejection of those measures and call upon the \r\nCuban people to continue to resist them, as well as to \r\ncontinue their remarkable achievements in all areas \r\nthrough the multilateral system, which we have all \r\nchosen as the framework for joint action. \r\n The Sudan’s position regarding these policies is \r\nbased on firm principle. We are resolute in standing \r\nagainst any policies of embargo and against exclusion \r\nand hegemonic policies. We therefore voted in favour \r\nof draft resolution A/61/L.10, submitted by Cuba, \r\nentitled “Necessity of ending the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States of America against Cuba”. We would like \r\nto thank the States that voted in favour of the draft \r\nresolution for having expressed their strong rejection \r\nof unilateral measures that violate the principles of the \r\nCharter and of international law. \r\n Mr. Loayza Barea (Bolivia) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nAs we have done for more than 10 years, we in the \r\nGeneral Assembly continue to discuss the need to bring \r\nto an end the financial and trade embargo against the \r\nfraternal people and Government of Cuba, but without \r\nsuccess. As a result of this continuous action at the \r\nlevel of multilateral diplomacy, a series of resolutions \r\nhave been adopted, urging all States to adhere to the \r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter and the \r\nprinciples embodied in international legal instruments \r\nand to repeal all laws and other extraterritorial \r\nmeasures impacting on the sovereignty of other States \r\nand their legitimate interests, as well as the freedom of \r\ntrade and navigation.  \r\n Unfortunately, we see that the decision taken by \r\nthe international community has come up against a \r\nunilateral decision in favour of the embargo, which is \r\ncontrary to democratic principles and fails to offer a \r\npositive response to the will of the majority here \r\nrepresented.  \r\n The embargo and the sanctions imposed by the \r\nUnited States on Cuba, which have been in place for \r\nover 40 years, have an impact, on the one hand, on the \r\nlegitimate endeavours of the Cuban people to find their \r\nown course and their own mechanisms to achieve \r\ndevelopment and yet seek paradoxically, on the other \r\nhand, through such coercive measures of a unilateral \r\nnature, to promote democracy, freedom and human \r\nrights in Cuba.  \r\n We feel strongly that this attitude fails to meet \r\neither the principles or the sentiments of the majority \r\nof countries within the United Nations system. These \r\nactions are contrary to the principles of freedom and \r\ndemocracy and in addition impact the human rights of \r\nthe people of Cuba. The way in which these principles \r\nare being used demonstrates a distortion of their goals \r\nand purpose.  \r\n Bolivia constantly seeks, from a sovereign and \r\ndignified position, to maintain relations of friendship \r\nand cooperation with the United States. We urge the \r\nUnited States Government to review and end this \r\npolicy, which has met the condemnation and opposition \r\nof the international community and gives rise to \r\nconstant concern in Latin America as a result of the \r\nnegative impacts on Cuba, on its people and on the \r\nregion.  \r\n We firmly believe that the international \r\ncommunity has made clear its concern regarding the \r\nembargo in that it is contrary to the principles of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter and because of the negative \r\nimpact on the Cuban people, depriving them of their \r\nright to goods and to free movement and of access to \r\nmedicines and components for manufacturing \r\nmedicines among other things. We identify with the \r\nwill of the international community in this demand that \r\nan immediate end be brought to the embargo against \r\nCuba. We are of the view that the mechanisms of a fair \r\ninternational system based on international law and on \r\ntreaties allow for a coexistence that accommodates \r\ncontradictions and differences but rejects hostile \r\nconfrontations.  \r\n The differences in systems and views of States \r\nshould be resolved through cooperation and dialogue \r\non a basis of equality and mutual respect. Moreover, \r\nBolivia has had personal experience with the \r\nsignificant difficulties that developing countries daily \r\n A/61/PV.50\r\n \r\n25 06-60788 \r\n \r\nface in implementing policies intended to achieve and \r\npromote the welfare of our populations. Therefore, we \r\nunderstand and express our solidarity with the people \r\nof Cuba and its Government, which are suffering as the \r\nresult of a policy that hampers the development to \r\nwhich all nations are entitled.  \r\n We urge the United States Government to replace \r\nconfrontation with dialogue, sanctions with \r\ncommunication and effectively implement the relevant \r\nresolutions of the United Nations in this regard. \r\nBolivia firmly opposes these sanctions and the \r\neconomic and financial embargo. We support the \r\nCubans in seeking to protect their national \r\nindependence and their sovereignty and we echo the \r\nwords of Brazil on behalf of the Rio Group. For those \r\nreasons, we have voted for the draft resolution.  \r\n Mr. Swe (Myanmar): The international \r\ncommunity has consistently expressed its unequivocal \r\nsupport for the call to end the economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargo by the United States against \r\nCuba, since the General Assembly adopted resolution \r\n47/19 by a clear majority 15 years ago. The Summit \r\nConference of the Heads of State or Government of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement held in Havana last September \r\nalso reiterated its call to the Government of the United \r\nStates of America to put an end to the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo against Cuba.  \r\n Myanmar strongly believes that the promulgation \r\nand application by Member States of laws and \r\nregulations, the extraterritorial effects of which effect \r\nthe sovereignty of other States and the legitimate \r\ninterests of entities and persons under their \r\njurisdiction, as well as the freedom of trade and the \r\nfreedom of navigation, violate both the spirit and letter \r\nof the United Nations Charter and the universally \r\naccepted principles of international law. Accordingly, \r\nMyanmar opposes all forms of unilateral, economic \r\nand financial coercive measures, as well as sanctions \r\nand embargos that are contrary to international law. \r\nMyanmar, as one of the initiators of the five principles \r\nof peaceful coexistence, scrupulously respects the \r\nprinciple of sovereign equality of all States, non-\r\nintervention and non-interference in the internal affairs \r\nof countries.  \r\n The economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nimposed by the United States on Cuba has not only \r\nnegatively impacted the economy of the country, but \r\nalso adversely affected the well-being of the people. \r\nThe embargo is aimed at destroying the political, \r\neconomic and social system of the Cuban people. The \r\nblockage imposed on the health centre in particular is \r\ncausing undue suffering and hardship to the Cuban \r\npeople, particularly the most vulnerable segment \r\namong the population — women and children. We \r\nregard this as inhumane and strongly oppose such \r\nmeasures.  \r\n These measures can in no way promote peace and \r\nstability in the region. These measures are against \r\ninternational law. Myanmar wholeheartedly associates \r\nitself with the call by the international community on \r\nthe United States to bring an end to the embargo and \r\nsanctions on Cuba. My delegation, therefore, voted in \r\nfavour of the draft resolution to reaffirm our opposition \r\nto laws and regulations that have extraterritorial effect \r\nand to demonstrate our friendship with the Government \r\nand people of Cuba.  \r\n Mr. Chidyausiku (Zimbabwe): The fact that the \r\nGeneral Assembly continues to debate and pass \r\nresolutions year after year on the same issue, calling \r\nfor similar action, without being heeded, is ample \r\ntestimony to the shortcomings of the dispute settlement \r\nmechanisms of the United Nations system. The \r\nresolution on the necessity of ending the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial blockade on Cuba has \r\nenjoyed overwhelming support over the years. It is \r\nnow time for the United States Government to take \r\nbold and positive steps to open up to the people of \r\nCuba, restore the confidence of millions of people \r\naround the world in the United Nations system and \r\nrekindle that hope that was sparked by the adoption of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations many decades ago. \r\n My country, Zimbabwe, understands only too \r\nwell the negative impact of such ill-conceived, \r\nillegitimate and immoral measures on the lives of \r\nordinary people, as it is also a victim of such illegal \r\nmeasures.  \r\n The majority of States Members of the United \r\nNations, including Zimbabwe, have consistently \r\nrejected the adoption of national laws and regulations \r\nwith extraterritorial impact, and all other coercive \r\neconomic measures, including unilateral sanctions, \r\nwhich are targeted mainly against developing countries \r\nthat seek to reassert their sovereignty.  \r\n The destiny of Cuba lies with the Cuban people, \r\nwhose right it is to choose an economic and social \r\nsystem of their own choice that best suits their \r\nA/61/PV.50  \r\n \r\n06-60788 26 \r\n \r\ncircumstances. Is it not ironic that the leading \r\nadvocates of free trade have become, at the same time, \r\nchampions of blockades in a vile game of double \r\nstandards? The persistence of the United States \r\nGovernment in that practice, which harms the \r\nlivelihoods of innocent people, also undermines all \r\ndevelopment efforts aimed at achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and all other internationally agreed \r\ndevelopment goals.  \r\n Not only is the embargo imposed by the United \r\nStates Government on Cuba a violation of international \r\nlaw and the principles of the United Nations Charter; it \r\nalso runs contrary to the letter and spirit of the \r\nprinciples of the World Trade Organization (WTO) \r\naimed at achieving freer trade. The United States and \r\nCuba are both members of the WTO. \r\n The Secretary-General’s report makes it clear that \r\nthe United States embargo on Cuba has denied that \r\ncountry access to markets, development credit granted \r\nby international financial institutions, and technology, \r\nand that it has further restricted freedom of navigation, \r\ntrade and remittances to beneficiaries in that country. \r\n My delegation therefore voted, in solidarity with \r\nthe Government and people of Cuba, in favour of the \r\nresolution. \r\n Mr. Dapkiunas (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): For \r\nthe fifteenth year in a row, the General Assembly has \r\ncalled almost unanimously for an immediate end to the \r\nembargo on Cuba. Each year, we have seen an increase \r\nin the number of countries in favour of that goal. The \r\ninternational community has long understood that \r\neconomic wars, like any other action undertaken on a \r\nfalse pretext, do not yield positive results. They lead \r\nonly to destruction. \r\n It is difficult to understand the reasons behind the \r\nflouting of the international community’s appeal to end \r\nthe embargo on Cuba. It is impossible to justify \r\nattempts to further tighten economic sanctions, as \r\noccurred this year.  \r\n At the summit of the Non-Aligned Movement \r\nheld in Havana, Movement heads of State and \r\nGovernment agreed that only a sober and realistic \r\nvision of the contemporary world will allow calm and \r\nstability to be established. We call on those who \r\ncontinue to favour sanctions and the isolation of Cuba \r\nto be realistic. The Cubans should be allowed to live \r\nand work in peace. The sooner the need is recognized \r\nto focus on real, rather than spurious international \r\nproblems, the sooner order will reign in the world and \r\npeople will come to believe in the future. \r\n Belarus is proud once again to take this \r\nopportunity to add its voice to the demands to end the \r\nembargo on the Cuban people. We are happy to stand \r\nwith Cuba, our friend and tried and true partner. \r\n Mr. Maema (Lesotho): My delegation fully \r\nassociates itself with the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of South Africa on behalf of the Group \r\nof 77 and China. \r\n Lesotho rejects the unilateral imposition of all \r\nforms of economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargoes, as well as the unilateral application of \r\nother coercive measures by one State against another. \r\nIndeed, my delegation regards all coercive measures — \r\nbe they economic, political or other — by one State \r\nagainst another as dangerous and thus inadmissible. In \r\nour view, such measures can never enhance \r\ninternational peace and stability, but must compromise \r\nthem.  \r\n My delegation therefore insists on respect by all \r\nof the rule of law and on strict compliance with \r\ninternational law, particularly the noble principles of \r\nthe sovereign equality of States and of non-intervention \r\nand non-interference in their internal affairs, as \r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.  \r\n My delegation is therefore disheartened that, \r\ndespite its adverse effects on the Cuban people over the \r\nyears, and despite the fact that it has been condemned \r\nby an overwhelming majority of this Assembly since \r\n1991, the embargo on Cuba has to date not been lifted. \r\nIronically, the adoption over the years of further \r\ncoercive measures that seek to isolate Cuba from \r\ninternational trade and further hurt the Cuban people \r\nhave constantly been accompanied by claims that the \r\nblockade has been and is aimed at enhancing \r\ndemocracy, freedom and human rights in Cuba. Indeed, \r\nwe have heard similar claims today. \r\n My delegation wishes to reiterate its well-known \r\nposition that it is the sovereign right of the people of \r\nany country, including Cuba, to determine the system \r\nof Government and the model of development most \r\nappropriate for their country. We also reiterate our \r\nstrong conviction that, in order to exercise those rights, \r\nmillions of people in Cuba need not have endured, for \r\nover four decades, the untold hardship, suffering and \r\n A/61/PV.50\r\n \r\n27 06-60788 \r\n \r\nmisery caused by the blockade, as they have and still \r\ndo. \r\n The support that has just been expressed by the \r\nMember States that intervened on this agenda item and \r\nby the overwhelming majority that voted in favour of \r\nthe resolution today truly reflects the fact that the \r\nunilateral embargo and measures aimed at tightening \r\nthe blockade of Cuba are contrary to the principles of \r\ninternational law, particularly those enshrined in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations.  \r\n The Government of the Kingdom of Lesotho \r\ntherefore strongly opposes the unilateral economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo on Cuba and urges \r\nits lifting. For that reason, my delegation voted in \r\nfavour of resolution 61/11. \r\n Mr. Aburawi (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in \r\nArabic): My delegation voted in favour of resolution \r\n61/11 because we believe that the imposition of \r\nsanctions and embargoes is not and never can be the \r\nright way to resolve disputes among States. The United \r\nNations Charter provides proper avenues to resolve \r\nbilateral differences, including by negotiation, \r\ninvestigation, mediation, reconciliation, adjudication or \r\nresort to regional agencies and organizations. All such \r\naction should be conducted on the basis of full \r\nequality, mutual respect and non-interference in the \r\ninternal affairs of countries. \r\n That approach has been repeatedly stressed by \r\nStates Members of the United Nations through the \r\nresolutions of the General Assembly, which must be \r\ncomplied with without delay, as they embody justice \r\nand common sense and consecrate the norms of \r\ninternational law. Such resolutions also send the clear \r\nmessage that no progress can be made towards \r\nestablishing general peace, developing friendly \r\nrelations among States and achieving higher levels of \r\ndevelopment without international cooperation \r\nanchored in mutual respect for the sovereignty of \r\nStates regardless of their size or population, or the \r\nnature of their political and economic system.  \r\n The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya once again reaffirms \r\nits strong opposition to unilateral measures that are \r\nenforced against States for political reasons. We would \r\nlike to express our deep concern over the maintenance \r\nby some States of unilateral coercive economic \r\nextraterritorial measures because they are in explicit \r\ncontravention of norms of international law, especially \r\nthe two principles of equal sovereignty among States \r\nand non-interference in their internal affairs.  \r\n The application of such measures would only \r\ndeepen human suffering and further exacerbate \r\ndifferences and hatred among peoples of interrelated \r\ninterests, which necessitates compliance with the \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations. Proper \r\nand civilized solutions to problems should be found, \r\nsolutions that would ensure that basic human rights \r\nsuch as the right to development, food, medical care \r\nand essential social services would not be interrupted. \r\n The people of Cuba have been suffering from an \r\nunfair embargo for over four decades, an embargo that \r\nhas caused severe, untold damage and that has affected \r\nthe entire Cuban population, including children, \r\nwomen and the elderly. The embargo has also \r\nhamstrung the ability of the Cuban administration to \r\nimport necessary foodstuffs, agricultural supplies, \r\nmedical equipment and drugs needed for health care.  \r\n We hope that the resolution just adopted will \r\ncontribute to the elimination of the suffering and \r\nhardship endured by the Cuban people through a \r\nfavourable response from the country concerned to its \r\nprovisions. We call on the United States to resolve its \r\ndifferences with Cuba by peaceful means and to set \r\naside unilateral coercive measures that violate the \r\nCharter and human rights and attempt to hinder \r\ndevelopment efforts, which constitute a noble objective \r\nof the United Nations system. \r\n Mr. Kapoma (Zambia): Zambia reiterates its \r\nsupport for the call to lift the economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba. My delegation is disappointed \r\nto note that the embargo has lasted for more than four \r\ndecades, and it is our earnest desire that it be lifted \r\nwithout further delay.  \r\n The Resident Coordinator findings clearly \r\ndemonstrate that the embargo has negative implications \r\nfor Cuba’s balance of trade, foreign exchange earnings \r\nand volume of production. Additionally, the embargo \r\nhas had a negative impact on Cuba’s commercial \r\nactivities in the areas of food, agriculture, health, \r\neducation, science and technology. This state of affairs \r\nhas been demonstrated in the various accounts outlined \r\nin the report of the Secretary-General. \r\n Mr. Al-Murad (Kuwait), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\nA/61/PV.50  \r\n \r\n06-60788 28 \r\n \r\n The Zambian Government continues to express \r\nconcern at the persistent imposition of restrictions by \r\nthe United States of America against the people of \r\nCuba. A violation of this nature must be discouraged to \r\nthe greatest extent possible. Therefore, my delegation \r\nappeals to all States Members of the United Nations to \r\nsupport the immediate lifting of the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo against Cuba. \r\n For 15 consecutive years, the General Assembly \r\nhas adopted resolutions under the agenda item entitled \r\n“Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba”. Last year, the resolution was \r\nadopted by 182 votes in favour and only 4 against. The \r\nsupport of the resolution shows the overwhelming \r\nrejection by the international community of the \r\nembargo, which should therefore be lifted. \r\n We acknowledge the resilience of the Cuban \r\npeople in the face of the difficulties arising from the \r\nsanctions. The embargo imposed by the United States \r\nof America against Cuba demonstrates by all accounts \r\na failed policy and should therefore be abandoned. \r\n Let me conclude by stating that the measures \r\ntaken under the Helms-Burton Act continue to violate \r\nCuba’s rights to free trade and navigation. Based on the \r\ninformation provided by the United Nations system on \r\nthe embargo’s negative impact on the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programmes in Cuba, my delegation \r\nvoted, as it has done in the past, in favour of the \r\nresolution. We will continue to do so for as long as the \r\nembargo continues. \r\n Mr. Kittikhoun (Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic) (spoke in French): More than four decades \r\nhave gone by and the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed on Cuba by the United \r\nStates of America is still with us. This has been a long, \r\npainful and tough period for the innocent Cuban \r\npeople. The embargo has benefited neither side; quite \r\nthe contrary, it has created additional tension between \r\ntwo neighbouring countries. \r\n In today’s world, with its multifaceted \r\ncooperation among States, it is disappointing that there \r\nare still unilateral, discriminatory commercial \r\npractices. In our view, the extraterritorial application of \r\nthe domestic laws of one country clearly violates the \r\npurposes and principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations. In keeping with the relevant resolutions of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, no Member shall promulgate or \r\napply laws, regulations or measures whose \r\nextraterritorial effects undermine the sovereignty of \r\nother Member States as well as freedom of trade. Each \r\nnation has the sovereign right to participate freely in \r\nthe international commercial and financial system. In \r\nthe light of the universal principal of sovereignty, no \r\ncountry has the right to interfere in the internal affairs \r\nof another country, despite the existence of different \r\nsocial and political systems.  \r\n As a sovereign, independent nation, the Republic \r\nof Cuba has the right to choose its own political system \r\nas well as its own development model. In order to \r\nreduce poverty and attain sustainable development, \r\nCuba should be free to maintain and promote economic \r\nand commercial relations with all countries of our \r\nplanet. \r\n The Lao People’s Democratic Republic, together \r\nwith the majority of United Nations Member States, \r\nwill continue to work to end the economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargo against Cuba. This decidedly \r\nobsolete policy runs counter to international law and it \r\nhas already caused so much suffering to the Cuban \r\npeople. The Republic of Cuba is a member of the \r\nUnited Nations and as Members ourselves we must do \r\neverything to help that country fully to recover its \r\nlegitimate right to integration in the globalized world \r\neconomy. \r\n Accordingly, my Government voted in favour of \r\nthe draft resolution A/61/L.10. \r\n Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt): The delegation of Egypt \r\nvoted in favour of the motion not to take action on the \r\namendment proposed by Australia in document \r\nA/61/L.19 because Egypt believes firmly that the \r\nhuman rights situation in Member States of the United \r\nNations should be addressed without selectivity, double \r\nstandards or politicization, and with full respect for the \r\ncompetence of the Human Rights Council and the \r\nThird Committee, using cooperative and non-\r\nconfrontational methods as clearly stipulated in the \r\n2005 outcome document and Assembly resolution \r\n60/251, establishing the Human Rights Council.  \r\n For us, the proposed amendment falls outside the \r\ninstitutional framework of our consideration of the \r\nitem before us today. It would have been better for the \r\nsponsor of the amendment and his supporters to submit \r\nseparate draft resolutions to the General Assembly and \r\nto the Security Council on the consistent and \r\nsystematic violations that are committed on a daily \r\n A/61/PV.50\r\n \r\n29 06-60788 \r\n \r\nbasis against the human rights of the Palestinian \r\npeople. At this very moment, the Palestinian people are \r\nunder fierce attacks from Israeli military forces, \r\nresulting in a massacre this morning, with 18 persons \r\nkilled and 50 persons injured today alone in Beit \r\nHanoun, raising the number of casualties in the latest \r\nmilitary operation by Israel to more than 100 persons \r\nkilled and hundreds of others wounded over a period of \r\nfive days. This is an issue that requires priority in our \r\nconsideration of how to effectively address human \r\nrights violations and human rights violators if we are \r\ntruly serious in our commitment to avoid selectivity, \r\ndouble standards and politicization. \r\n Finally, our vote in favour of the resolution \r\ncontained in document A/61/L.10 is in full \r\nimplementation of the provisions of the Final \r\nDocument of September’s Summit Conference of \r\nHeads of State or Government of Non-Aligned \r\nCountries, held at Havana, which stipulates, in its \r\nparagraph 234.6:  \r\n  “The Heads of State or Government re-\r\nemphasized that the exploitation of human rights \r\nfor political purposes, including selective \r\ntargeting of individual countries for extraneous \r\nconsiderations, which is contrary to the founding \r\nprinciples of the Movement and the United \r\nNations Charter, should be prohibited. They \r\nurged that, in the discussion on human rights, \r\nadequate attention be given to the issues of \r\npoverty, underdevelopment, marginalization, \r\ninstability and foreign occupation that engender \r\nsocial and economic exclusion and violation of \r\nhuman dignity and human rights, which cannot be \r\ndivorced from any meaningful discussion relating \r\nto human rights”.  \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): We \r\nhave heard the last speaker in explanation of vote. \r\n I now call on the representative of Cuba, who \r\nwishes to speak in exercise of the right of reply. May I \r\nremind delegations that, in accordance with General \r\nAssembly decision 34/401, statements in exercise of \r\nthe right of reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first \r\nintervention and to five minutes for the second and \r\nshould be made by delegations from their seats. \r\n Mrs. Núñez Mordoche (Cuba) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): The demented intensification of the \r\ngenocidal policy of hostility, aggression and embargo \r\ncarried out by the United States against the Cuban \r\npeople reflects the frustration of the current \r\nGovernment of the United States and its inability to \r\nreverse the firm decision of Cubans to defend their \r\nindependence and sovereignty to the last breath.  \r\n Those who claim the supposed right to unleash \r\nwars of conquest, massively bombard defenceless \r\ncivilian populations in the name of freedom and the \r\nnon-proliferation of weapons and institutionalize \r\ntorture in the name of democracy have no moral \r\nauthority to judge the Cuban revolution, which is a \r\nsymbol of resistance and dignity for the peoples of the \r\nworld. Nothing demonstrates the anti-Cuban nature of \r\nthe policies and actions of the current United States \r\nAdministration as clearly as the successive versions of \r\nthe annexation plan prepared by the so-called \r\nCommission for Assistance to a Free Cuba, established \r\nby President Bush. \r\n Putting an end to the freedom and independence \r\nenjoyed today by Cuban men and women and \r\ndestroying the society that they have freely chosen \r\nhave become obsessions of the centres of power of the \r\nUnited States. Attempting to justify the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo against Cuba on the \r\nbasis of a false concern about a non-existent situation \r\nof human rights violations is unsustainable and \r\nfallacious. Those who have been responsible for \r\npractices of torture and the most brutal harassment of \r\npersons detained at Guantánamo and Abu Ghraib \r\ncannot give lessons on human rights. The United States \r\ndoes not qualify as a judge and does not have the moral \r\nauthority to evaluate any country.  \r\n We will not dwell on the matter of Australia. \r\nCuba’s Minister for Foreign Affairs was clear, and I \r\nwill merely repeat what he said. Australia’s submission \r\nof an amendment at the behest of the United States is a \r\ndemonstration of its abject submission to and \r\ncomplicity with the Government of the United States. A \r\nGovernment such as that of Australia, which nearly \r\nexterminated its aboriginal peoples and which today \r\nsubjects them to apartheid, does not have the moral \r\nauthority to condemn Cuba. \r\n Permit me to address the European Union and its \r\nmembers. What stood out in the Union’s explanation of \r\nvote regarding the draft resolution against the embargo \r\nwas hypocrisy and subordination to the anti-Cuban \r\npolicy of its major ally.  \r\n The European Union does not have the moral \r\nauthority to refer to the human rights situation in Cuba. \r\nA/61/PV.50  \r\n \r\n06-60788 30 \r\n \r\nIn its countries, there is growing racism and \r\nxenophobia and an upsurge in reprisals and \r\ndiscrimination against those who emigrate to Europe to \r\nescape poverty caused by centuries of colonial \r\nexploitation and an unjust international order that \r\nenables the Union to reap profits from sweat and from \r\npillaging the resources of the South. What credibility \r\nshould we give to the human rights concerns of \r\nGovernments that have not had the courage to condemn \r\nthe human rights violations carried out by the United \r\nStates in its arbitrary detention and torture centre at \r\nGuantánamo, or of Governments that provided their \r\nterritory for secret CIA flights carried out for the \r\npurpose of torturing prisoners?   \r\n The Cuban revolution, having resisted half a \r\ncentury of brutal aggression, embargo and hostility \r\nfrom the most powerful super-Power that has ever \r\nexisted, moves inexorably forward. It is a genuinely  \r\n \r\npopular and indigenous revolution that has enabled us \r\nto build a participative democracy and an ever more \r\nhuman and just society that places the human person at \r\nthe centre of its activities. That is why we will continue \r\nto fight and are prepared to give up our own lives, if \r\nnecessary.  \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): May I \r\ntake it that it is the wish of the Assembly to conclude \r\nits consideration of agenda item 18? \r\n It was so decided.  \r\n \r\nProgramme of work \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I would \r\nlike to inform members that the General Assembly, in \r\nthe morning of Friday 10 November, will consider \r\nagenda item 68, “Report of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil”. \r\n  The meeting rose at 1.30 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\n"
