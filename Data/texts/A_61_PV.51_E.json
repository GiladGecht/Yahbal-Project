(Bahrain) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 10.25 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 68 \r\n \r\nReport of the Human Rights Council (A/61/53) \r\n \r\n The President: Under agenda item 68, the \r\nAssembly has before it the annual report of the Human \r\nRights Council circulated in document A/61/53. \r\n In connection with this item, I would like to \r\nrecall that the General Assembly, on the \r\nrecommendation of the General Committee, decided at \r\nits 41st plenary meeting, on 26 October 2006, to \r\nconsider agenda item 68 in plenary meeting and in the \r\nThird Committee, on the understanding that the Third \r\nCommittee would consider and act on all \r\nrecommendations of the Human Rights Council to the \r\nAssembly, including those that deal with the \r\ndevelopment of international law in the field of human \r\nrights. Taking this decision into account, the Assembly \r\nwill consider in plenary meeting the annual report of \r\nthe Human Rights Council on its activities for the year. \r\n This division of work was agreed upon with the \r\nunderstanding that this arrangement is motivated by the \r\nfact that the Human Rights Council only began its \r\nwork in June 2006. It is also understood that the \r\ncurrent arrangement is in no way a reinterpretation of \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 60/251 and will be \r\nreviewed before the beginning of the sixty-second \r\nsession of the Assembly, on the basis of the experience \r\ngained with the efficiency and practicality of this \r\narrangement. \r\n Upon the conclusion of the debate in plenary on \r\nthis item, the General Assembly will revert to this \r\nagenda item in the context of its consideration of the \r\nreport of the Third Committee. \r\n The Assembly will now start its consideration of \r\nthe annual report of the Human Rights Council on its \r\nactivities for the year. \r\n Before proceeding further, I would like to consult \r\nmembers about inviting the President of the Human \r\nRights Council to present the first annual report of the \r\nCouncil. Bearing in mind the provisions of the General \r\nAssembly decision on the allocation of the item and \r\nwithout setting a precedent, may I take it that it is the \r\nwish of the General Assembly to invite the President of \r\nthe Human Rights Council to present the first annual \r\nreport of the Council? \r\n I see no objection. \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President: We shall proceed accordingly. In \r\naccordance with the decision just taken and without \r\nsetting a precedent, I now give the floor to Mr. Luis \r\nAlfonso de Alba, President of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, to present the report of the Council. \r\n Mr. de Alba (spoke in Spanish): It is an honour \r\nfor me to present to the General Assembly the report \r\non the work of the Human Rights Council during the \r\nperiod since its historic creation on 15 March 2006 in \r\naccordance with resolution 60/251 of this General \r\nAssembly. \r\nA/61/PV.51  \r\n \r\n06-61126 2 \r\n \r\n At the outset, I should like to refer to the steps \r\ntaken by the Human Rights Council in carrying out its \r\nmandate in its first year. Secondly, I shall address some \r\nof the challenges that the international community has \r\nto face in order to strengthen the Council, which, as set \r\nforth in the resolution to which I have referred, is  \r\n “responsible for promoting universal respect for \r\nthe protection of all human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms for all, without distinction \r\nof any kind and in a fair and equal manner” \r\n(resolution 60/251, para. 2). \r\n The Council held its first regular session from \r\n19 to 30 July and has since held two special sessions \r\non 5 and 6 July and 11 August, respectively. It met \r\nagain in regular session from 18 September to \r\n6 October, and the session will be resumed on \r\n27 November. A third regular session will be convened \r\nimmediately following the conclusion of the second \r\nand before the end of the year. \r\n At the Council’s first session, a number of high-\r\nlevel meetings were held with the participation of more \r\nthan 85 personalities, representatives of civil society \r\nand national institutions, and parliamentarians. That \r\nbroad-based high-level participation reflects the \r\nimportance that States and the various institutions of \r\nthe United Nations system and the international \r\ncommunity in general attach to the new body, as well \r\nas the high expectations it has generated. \r\n The Council received the report of the High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights, Ms. Louis Arbour. \r\nInteractive dialogues were also convened on a variety \r\nof themes, with the wide-ranging participation of \r\nmember States, as well as of observers and \r\nrepresentatives of civil society. \r\n In the context of the dialogue and interaction with \r\nthe special human rights instances and mechanisms, the \r\nCouncil had an exchange of views with the \r\nChairperson of the Coordination Committee of special \r\nprocedures, the Vice-Chairperson of the fifty-seventh \r\nsession of the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and \r\nProtection of Human Rights, and the Chairperson of \r\nthe eighteenth meeting of the chairpersons of the \r\nhuman rights treaty bodies. \r\n Similarly, the Council held discussions on such \r\nquestions the situation of human rights in Palestine and \r\nthe other occupied Arab territories; support for the \r\nDarfur Peace Agreement: backing efforts for the \r\nstrengthening of the promotion and protection of \r\nhuman rights; avoiding incitement to hatred and \r\nviolence for reasons of religion or race through the \r\npromotion of tolerance and dialogue; the human rights \r\nof migrants in the context of the High-Level Dialogue \r\non International Migration and Development; and the \r\nrole of human rights defenders in promoting and \r\nprotecting human rights. \r\n The Council adopted a resolution on the situation \r\nof human rights in Palestine and the other occupied \r\nArab territories, and another on incitement to racial \r\nand religious hatred and the promotion of tolerance. \r\n With regard to the Council’s work on the \r\ndevelopment of international law in the sphere of \r\nhuman rights and its consideration of specific issues, \r\nthe Council adopted and recommended for adoption by \r\nthe General Assembly an international convention for \r\nthe protection of all persons from enforced \r\ndisappearance and a draft United Nations declaration \r\non the rights of indigenous peoples. \r\n Furthermore, a decision was made to extend the \r\nmandates of three working groups in that area, namely, \r\nthe Open-ended Working Group established with a \r\nview to considering options regarding the elaboration \r\nof an optional protocol to the International Covenant \r\non Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; the Working \r\nGroup on the Right to Development; and the \r\nIntergovernmental Working Group on the effective \r\nimplementation of the Durban Declaration and \r\nProgramme of Action. \r\n With regard to measures in implementation of \r\nparagraph 6 of resolution 60/251, the Council decided \r\nto extend exceptionally for one year the mandates and \r\nthe mandate holders of all the special procedures of the \r\nCommission on Human Rights, of the Sub-Commission \r\non the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights, as \r\nwell as the procedure established in accordance with \r\nEconomic and Social Council resolution 1503 \r\n(XLVIII). That will allow the procedures to continue \r\nuntil the end of the review process. Moreover, the \r\nSecretary-General and the High Commissioner for \r\nHuman Rights will be able to submit to the Council all \r\nreports and studies that may have been requested by \r\nthe former Commission on Human Rights during the \r\nfourth session and to update them in response to \r\ndevelopments, as required. With those measures, the \r\nCouncil is seeking to avert a vacuum in human rights \r\nprotection during the transitional period. \r\n A/61/PV.51\r\n \r\n3 06-61126 \r\n \r\n Furthermore, the Council established an open-\r\nended intergovernmental working group to formulate \r\nconcrete recommendations on the issue of reviewing \r\nand, where necessary, improving and rationalizing all \r\nmandates, mechanisms, functions and responsibilities \r\nin order to maintain a special procedures system, \r\nspecialized assessments and a claims procedure. The \r\nworking group will report to the Council periodically \r\nin order to complete the review of mandates in June \r\n2007. \r\n The General Assembly decided that the Council \r\nshould also conduct a universal periodic review, based \r\non objective and reliable information, of the fulfilment \r\nby each State of its human rights obligations and \r\ncommitments. It also decided that the Council shall \r\ndevelop the modalities and necessary time allocation \r\nfor the universal periodic review mechanism within \r\none year.  \r\n At the end of its mandate, the Human Rights \r\nCouncil established an intersessional open-ended \r\nintergovernmental working group to consult on and \r\nconsider the various proposals in that regard. In that \r\nconnection, the Council requested substantive \r\ncontributions from the Office of the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights, which are \r\nessential to designing a well-founded mechanism. The \r\ncreation of a universal periodic review mechanism, as \r\ndefined by the General Assembly, is undoubtedly one \r\nof the most complex and urgent tasks in the \r\ninstitutional building of the Council. \r\n The Human Rights Council has the challenge of \r\nconsolidating itself and of proving itself capable of \r\nmeeting the international community’s expectations. \r\nDuring this transitional period, we have therefore \r\nadopted many of the effective practices of the \r\nCommission on Human Rights when we have felt it \r\nappropriate to do so. At the same time, we have \r\nstressed the need to be creative and innovative in all \r\nareas where we need to be so. That will help us to \r\ndesign new machinery for the promotion and protection \r\nof human rights. \r\n We have another important challenge. That is the \r\nmanner in which the Council will address human rights \r\nviolations, including grave and systematic violations \r\nand emergency situations involving human rights, as \r\nwell as the manner in which it will carry out its \r\npreventive tasks, in accordance with the mandate \r\nconferred by the Assembly in resolution 60/251. \r\n The Council has held two special sessions to date. \r\nThe first addressed the human rights situation in the \r\noccupied Palestinian territory, and the second \r\naddressed the grave situation of human rights in \r\nLebanon caused by Israeli military operations. \r\n The outcome of the first special session was the \r\nadoption by the Council of a resolution to dispatch an \r\nurgent fact-finding mission headed by the Special \r\nRapporteur on the situation of human rights in the \r\nPalestinian territories occupied since 1967. \r\nRegrettably, the mission has not yet been able to get \r\nunder way. \r\n In the second special session, a high-level \r\ncommission of inquiry was created, consisting of three \r\ninternationally recognized and prestigious individuals. \r\nThe commission has already begun its visits on the \r\nground and is ready to conclude its work. The \r\nCommission will submit its report to the Council at its \r\nthird regular session.  \r\n It is noteworthy that during the second session, \r\nnow under way, it was possible to develop a \r\nconstructive dialogue with a very high number of \r\nspecial procedures and with representatives of other \r\nhuman rights mechanisms under a new format. That led \r\nto better and richer participation on the part of Member \r\nStates and observers as well as of representatives of \r\ncivil society and national human rights institutions. A \r\ngeneric resolution was adopted allowing for continuity \r\nin the work under way, and it is hoped that a body of \r\ndecisions and resolutions submitted by Member States \r\nwill be adopted by the end of this month, when that \r\nsession concludes. Thus we can safely say that the \r\nwork of institution-building has not resulted in any \r\nprotection vacuum and that the system as a whole is \r\ncontinuing to function. \r\n After a year, the Council’s should have \r\ntransparent, fair and impartial methods of work, which \r\nwill enable genuine dialogue and be results-oriented, as \r\nset out in paragraph 12 of resolution 60/251. \r\n Likewise, it will have to pay due attention to the \r\nimplementation of its decisions, and, in that \r\nconnection, I would note that we have already taken \r\nsubstantive steps forward in that direction by following \r\nup, at each of our sessions, the decisions adopted by \r\nthe Council.  \r\n Likewise, the Council will have to agree on an \r\nagenda that is in keeping with the General Assembly’s \r\nA/61/PV.51  \r\n \r\n06-61126 4 \r\n \r\ndecision to promote universal respect for the protection \r\nof the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all \r\npersons, in the context of an annual cycle of meetings \r\nthat will enable the Council to consider, in an orderly \r\nand rational manner, all of the issues under its purview. \r\nThe idea is to avail ourselves of the possibility of \r\nmeeting on several occasions throughout the year, \r\nstaggering consideration of certain items and following \r\nup regularly on all mandates, and of reacting more \r\nquickly to events as they occur. We will also have to \r\ndevelop new rules of procedure to promote the orderly \r\nprogression of our work. \r\n Before concluding, I would note that the mandate \r\nand nature of the Council, as well as the pressing tasks \r\nbefore it — that is, consideration of various substantive \r\nitems as well as its own institutional development — \r\nrequire that the Council have at its disposal the tools \r\nand resources necessary to its consolidation and to \r\ncarry out its functions properly.  Likewise, I deem it \r\nimportant to take an innovative, open and positive \r\napproach to the various issues before the Council so as \r\nto achieve a true reform of the human rights system. \r\n Building a new institution that meets the \r\nexpectations of the international community will \r\ncertainly require the committed participation of each \r\nand every one of the States Members of the United \r\nNations as well as the commitment of all of those \r\nstakeholders that are directly or indirectly involved, in \r\norder to provide it the conditions and the support that it \r\nrequires to establish itself. This is not an easy task and \r\ncannot be accomplished by mere expressions of \r\ngoodwill. We must intensify efforts and reach \r\nagreement on complex issues.  \r\n I believe that we have made a great deal of \r\nprogress and that by June of next year we will be in a \r\nposition to achieve the goals that have been set for us. \r\n Ms. Lintonen (Finland): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the European Union (EU). The \r\nacceding countries Bulgaria and Romania, the \r\ncandidate countries Croatia and the former Yugoslav \r\nRepublic of Macedonia, the countries of the \r\nStabilization and Association Process and potential \r\ncandidates Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, \r\nMontenegro and Serbia and the European Free Trade \r\nAssociation (EFTA) country Norway, member of the \r\nEuropean Economic Area, as well as the Republic of \r\nMoldova, align themselves with this declaration. \r\n The EU warmly welcomes the report of the \r\nHuman Rights Council presented by the President of \r\nthe Council, Ambassador De Alba. The EU appreciates \r\nAmbassador De Alba’s work as President of the \r\nCouncil and wishes to express to him its full support. \r\n The creation of the Human Rights Council \r\nprovides new opportunities to promote and protect \r\nhuman rights. The first report of the Council, now \r\nbefore the General Assembly plenary, provides a \r\nchance to reflect on the beginning of the work of the \r\nCouncil. We welcome this opportunity to present our \r\nviews on the first report of the Human Rights Council. \r\nIn accordance with the General Assembly decision on \r\nthe allocation of this item, the account of the \r\nrecommendations of the Human Rights Council to the \r\nGeneral Assembly will be given at a meeting of the \r\nThird Committee later today. \r\n During its first session, the Human Rights \r\nCouncil held a discussion on issues identified by the \r\nMember States and observer States of the Council. The \r\nCouncil addressed the situation of human rights in the \r\noccupied Palestinian territories, religious intolerance, \r\nthe human rights of migrants, the role of human rights \r\ndefenders, and the situation in Darfur after the signing \r\nof the Abuja Peace Agreement. The EU welcomed the \r\nopportunity for an exchange of views on those \r\nimportant issues. The EU regrets that the Council was \r\nnot able to adopt substantive decisions on all those \r\ntopics. \r\n The Council also continued the work already \r\nbegun by the Commission on Human Rights. \r\nResolutions were adopted on the Working Group on an \r\noptional protocol to the International Covenant on \r\nEconomic, Social and Cultural Rights, on the Right to \r\nDevelopment and on the Intergovernmental Working \r\nGroup on the Effective Implementation of the Durban \r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action. \r\n The two recommendations of the Council to the \r\nGeneral Assembly, the draft resolutions on the \r\nInternational Convention for the Protection of all \r\nPersons from Enforced Disappearance and on the \r\nDeclaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples are to \r\nbe further considered in the Third Committee later \r\ntoday. As their final adoption is for the plenary of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, the European Union wishes to \r\nexpress its full support for the two texts aimed at \r\nstrengthening the promotion of human rights within the \r\nUnited Nations system and calls for their prompt \r\n A/61/PV.51\r\n \r\n5 06-61126 \r\n \r\nadoption by the General Assembly at its sixty-first \r\nsession, as recommended by the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. \r\n The EU also warmly welcomed the dialogue with \r\nthe High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. \r\nLouise Arbour, during the first session of the Human \r\nRights Council. The EU reaffirms its firm support for \r\nthe work and independence of the High Commissioner \r\nand her Office, which is making a crucial contribution \r\nto the promotion and protection of human rights \r\nworldwide. Apart from other important functions, an \r\nactive role is crucial on the part of the High \r\nCommissioner in contributing to an effective and \r\noperational Human Rights Council. \r\n The EU wishes to reiterate its commitment to an \r\nopen and constructive dialogue among all stakeholders, \r\nincluding the valuable contribution of non-\r\ngovernmental organizations on various human rights \r\nquestions in the framework of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. We all should continue our efforts towards a \r\nconstructive dialogue on all issues, including the most \r\ndifficult questions. We welcome similar efforts to \r\npromote dialogue made by a number of other \r\ndelegations. \r\n In accordance with resolution 60/251, the first \r\nsession of the Human Rights Council decided to extend \r\nall the mandates, mechanisms, functions and \r\nresponsibilities of the Commission on Human Rights, \r\nwhich were thus assumed by the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. That important consensus step prevented a \r\nprotection gap during the Council’s transitional year. \r\nAs the system of special procedures is crucial to ensure \r\nthe effective promotion and protection of human rights, \r\nthe EU firmly believes that in the context of the review \r\nprocess the system should be further strengthened. All \r\nStates should fully cooperate with special procedures \r\nin order to contribute to their effective functioning and \r\nto translate the dialogue with special procedures into \r\noperational outcomes. \r\n Other positive steps concerning the future work \r\nof the Council, such as the decision to establish a \r\nworking group to develop the modalities of the \r\nuniversal periodic review, were also taken during the \r\nfirst session, in accordance with resolution 60/251. The \r\nEU expects the universal periodic review to develop \r\ninto a meaningful mechanism complementing other \r\nforms of activity of the Human Rights Council related \r\nto country situations, and to bring real added value. \r\nThe EU will continue to play an active role to that \r\neffect. \r\n The EU emphasizes the importance of making \r\nprogress on those two important issues in a timely \r\nmanner. In the meantime, the EU looks forward to \r\nworking with all stakeholders in a constructive and \r\nconsensual manner in the framework of the working \r\ngroups. \r\n The EU believes that special sessions of the \r\nCouncil are a way to make an efficient contribution to \r\nthe protection and promotion of all human rights for \r\nall. It is important that the Human Rights Council \r\naddress urgent situations and express a united view. \r\nThis will require genuine discussion and consultations. \r\n At the first special session, on the situation in the \r\noccupied Palestinian territory, the European Union \r\nexpressed its concern about the situation which had \r\nevolved between Israel and the Palestinians and called \r\non all parties to abstain from any actions that violated \r\ninternational humanitarian and human rights law. The \r\nsecond special session took place following the \r\nescalation of hostilities in Lebanon and Israel. The EU \r\ndeplored the loss of innocent lives and called for an \r\nimmediate cessation of hostilities, to be followed by a \r\nsustainable ceasefire. \r\n The EU would have preferred the Council to have \r\nadopted texts addressing the situation in a more \r\nbalanced manner, reflecting all relevant aspects of the \r\ncrises, and it regrets that no genuine discussions took \r\nplace, as provided for in resolution 60/251. \r\n It is important that the Human Rights Council \r\neffectively fulfil its mandate relating to prevention and \r\naddress situations of human rights violations \r\nworldwide. The EU is also determined to work towards \r\nthose goals with all stakeholders when the second \r\nsession of the Human Rights Council is resumed and at \r\nthe forthcoming third session of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. \r\n Mrs. Ferrari (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines): \r\nI have the honour to make this brief statement on \r\nbehalf of the States members of the Caribbean \r\nCommunity (CARICOM). \r\n CARICOM member States wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Human Rights Council, Ambassador \r\nLuis Alfonso de Alba, for his statement. We would like \r\nto take this opportunity to congratulate Ambassador De \r\nAlba on his election as the first President of the \r\nA/61/PV.51  \r\n \r\n06-61126 6 \r\n \r\nCouncil. CARICOM member States consider it a great \r\nhonour for the Latin American and Caribbean Group \r\nthat the States members of the Council agreed to \r\ndesignate a member of our Group as the first President \r\nof the Human Rights Council. We are also pleased to \r\nnote the decision that the composition of the Bureau \r\nwill fully respect the principle of equitable \r\ngeographical distribution. \r\n We would like to extend our congratulations to all \r\nthose elected as members of the Bureau and to the \r\nmembership of the Human Rights Council as a whole \r\nfor undertaking the challenge of revamping and \r\nstrengthening the United Nations human rights \r\nmachinery with the aim of ensuring the effective \r\nenjoyment by all of all human rights: civil, political, \r\neconomic, social and cultural rights, including the right \r\nto development. \r\n In this context, we note the progress made during \r\nthe first session of the Human Rights Council towards \r\nthe implementation of 60/251, particularly with the \r\nestablishment, at its first session, of two open-ended \r\nintergovernmental working groups to address, \r\nrespectively, the universal periodic review and \r\ninstitution-building. \r\n For CARICOM member States, the core of the \r\nwork of the Human Rights Council is the establishment \r\nof a cooperative mechanism for the promotion of \r\nhuman rights, serving as a vehicle for the promotion of \r\ngenuine cooperation for capacity-building and mutual \r\nassistance. We endorse the view expressed by the \r\nSecretary-General that the Council’s work should mark \r\na clean break from the past; that should be apparent in \r\nthe way it develops and applies the universal periodic \r\nreview mechanism. \r\n CARICOM is of the view that the development of \r\na universal periodic review that is impartial and \r\napplicable to all States will usher in a new era of \r\ninternational cooperation on human rights matters. The \r\nwork of the Human Rights Council working group \r\ntasked with the development of modalities, as well as \r\nthe allocation of sufficient time for the review, are \r\ncritical. We note the decision of the Council to hold \r\ninformal consultations through an open-ended \r\nconsultative process in order to compile proposals and \r\nrelevant information and experiences. \r\n As the Human Rights Council discharges its \r\nmandate, we must always be mindful of the need to \r\nensure that it caters not to political agendas but rather \r\nto humanity, and particularly those who have been \r\ndenied their rights. If we maintain this perspective, \r\nthen the Council should be able to promote and protect \r\nthe highest ideals and standards of human rights. \r\n Mr. Skinner-Klée (Guatemala) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): We would like, first of all, to join with those \r\nwho have expressed gratitude to Ambassador Luis \r\nAlfonso de Alba, President of the recently created \r\nHuman Rights Council, for having accepted the \r\ninvitation of the General Assembly and the Third \r\nCommittee to introduce the report of the Council \r\n(A/61/53) and to discuss, in two parts, something \r\nwhich — in the view of my delegation — should have \r\nbeen discussed at one plenary meeting of the General \r\nAssembly, such as this morning’s. We understand that \r\nthe division of labour makes it possible to \r\naccommodate the various positions of delegations, and \r\nwe accept it this year, on the understanding that this \r\nnot constitute a precedent for the future consideration \r\nof the work of the Human Rights Council. \r\n Given the importance of the role of the United \r\nNations in the area of the promotion and protection of \r\nhuman rights, we believe that when the General \r\nAssembly receives and discusses the annual report of \r\nthe Human Rights Council, its consideration will not \r\nbecome merely a symbolic act or an annual ritual. \r\nRather, it must be a working tool that allows the \r\nGeneral Assembly, in an exhaustive and complete \r\nmanner, to fulfil its role as supervisor of the work and \r\npolicies adopted by the Human Rights Council. \r\n It is imperative that we move forward in \r\nconsolidating the Human Rights Council, a body which \r\nwe have accorded the responsibility to promote \r\nuniversal respect for all human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms of all persons. That is why, when we consider \r\nits report, we must accord it the importance that it \r\nmerits; our consideration must be comprehensive. The \r\nsubmission of the report and our consideration of it \r\nconstitute the main link between the General Assembly \r\nand the Human Rights Council. As for the report itself, \r\nwe hope that it will not be merely descriptive or overly \r\nlong but, rather, that it will contain assessments that \r\nwill enable all States Members of the Organization to \r\nunderstand and assess the Council’s work. The report \r\nshould highlight developments with respect to \r\nachievements in the area of human rights and present \r\nobservations regarding situations in which such rights \r\nhave been violated. \r\n A/61/PV.51\r\n \r\n7 06-61126 \r\n \r\n Given that the Human Rights Council was \r\nrecently created and that it is still in the organizational \r\nstage of its endeavours, some delegations were \r\nconcerned to hear the President’s account of what took \r\nplace during the first regular session and the first two \r\nspecial sessions. We acknowledge that, of those, only \r\nthe first session concerned the regular work of the \r\nbody. During that session, two important resolutions \r\nrecommended by the Council were adopted: the \r\nInternational Convention for the Protection of All \r\nPersons from Enforced Disappearance; and the United \r\nNations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous \r\nPeoples, which we will consider this afternoon in the \r\nThird Committee. We are aware that the Council \r\nPresident may not need to report personally to the \r\nAssembly every year for the consideration of each and \r\nevery item. \r\n As a member of the Human Rights Council, \r\nGuatemala recognizes that crucial tasks remain \r\nunfinished: the ongoing reform of its working methods \r\nand the fulfilment of the lofty ideals for which it was \r\ncreated. All of that requires time and dedication to \r\ncarry out the Council’s mandate as well as a \r\nresponsible, constructive, transparent and inclusive \r\ndialogue among its members.  \r\n We support the decision to extend exceptionally \r\nfor one year the mandates and the mandate holders of \r\nall the special procedures of the Commission and of the \r\nSub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of \r\nHuman Rights, as well as the procedure established in \r\naccordance with Economic and Social Council \r\nresolution 1503 (XLVIII). We also welcome the \r\nestablishment of the intersessional open-ended \r\nintergovernmental working group to determine the \r\nmodalities of the universal periodic review mechanism, \r\nwhich will have to be based on a transparent, objective \r\nand impartial methodology designed to permit genuine \r\ndialogue and to avoid selectivity, double standards and \r\npoliticization.  \r\n Finally, I wish to express my delegation’s \r\nsatisfaction with the work accomplished thus far by the \r\nHuman Rights Council. My Government is convinced \r\nthat strengthening the Council and promoting universal \r\nrespect for the protection of all human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms will undoubtedly pave the way \r\nfor peace and security throughout the world without \r\ndistinctions of any kind and in a just and equitable \r\nmanner.  \r\n Ms. Hughes (United States of America): Since \r\nthe founding of the United Nations and the \r\nestablishment in 1946 of the Commission on Human \r\nRights, the United States has led efforts to promote and \r\nprotect human rights. We remain true to our \r\nfundamental belief in and pursuit of human rights, both \r\nat home and around the globe. \r\n It was in that spirit that the United States engaged \r\nin the negotiations to create a new, stronger successor \r\nbody to the Commission on Human Rights. We sought \r\nto set the highest standards for membership in the new \r\nbody and to provide it with the tools it would need to \r\nmake a real and significant difference in the promotion \r\nand protection of human rights. While the results of the \r\nnegotiations fell short of our hopes, the United States \r\nnevertheless committed itself to working cooperatively \r\nwith members of the Human Rights Council and with \r\nother partners to help shape the Council into a \r\nmechanism that could meet the high expectations of \r\ncountries and, most especially, of victims of abuse. \r\n The Council has gotten off to a slow and \r\ndiscouraging start. Some say that that is due in part to \r\nthe growing pains of a new institution. That is not an \r\nexcuse; it is not reason enough to allow the Council to \r\nbecome sidetracked from its reason for being. It is up \r\nto the members of the Human Rights Council to \r\nexercise the political will and determination — and to \r\nhave the intellectual honesty — to make the Council \r\ninto the body that it is supposed to be. \r\n The first two regular sessions of the Council \r\nhaltingly began the work of laying the foundations for \r\nthe Council’s work, but much remains to be done. Our \r\ngreatest disappointment lies, however, in the Council’s \r\nfailure to pronounce itself equitably and forcefully on \r\nserious human rights situations that endanger persons \r\nin various regions of the world. \r\n To date, the Council has accomplished little that \r\nwill make a concrete and significant difference in the \r\nlives of millions around the world who are prevented \r\nfrom enjoying and exercising their rights. It has failed \r\nto reach agreement to address egregious violations of \r\nhuman rights in places such as the Sudan. In this time \r\nof tension among peoples of different faiths and \r\ncultures, the Council has also missed the opportunity to \r\npromote a dialogue to increase understanding and \r\ntolerance among religions and cultures. The Council \r\ncould reaffirm — and should have reaffirmed — \r\nA/61/PV.51  \r\n \r\n06-61126 8 \r\n \r\nfundamental rights such as freedom of thought, \r\nconscience, religion and association. \r\n As the Council approaches its third regular \r\nsession, we are faced with yet another call for a special \r\nsession on the situation in the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritories. This will be the third such session in less \r\nthan a year of the Council’s operation. Some States \r\nseem to view the Council as just another arena in \r\nwhich to play political games, and not as a vehicle for \r\nadvancing the cause of human rights or for giving \r\nredress to the victims of abuse. \r\n The Council has two sessions remaining in this \r\nfirst transitional and critical year. If it is to meet the \r\nexpectations and hopes of people all over the world, its \r\nmembers must seize the opportunity presented to them \r\nto shape it and set it on the right path. They have a \r\nresponsibility to build a Council that can truly protect \r\nand promote human rights around the world. Sadly, so \r\nfar, the Human Rights Council, into which was put so \r\nmuch hope and work, has been a disappointment. We \r\ncan only hope, and work to help ensure, that it reverses \r\ncourse and fulfils the purpose for which it was created.  \r\n Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt): Permit me at the outset to \r\nexpress my delegation’s deep appreciation to \r\nAmbassador De Alba, President of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, for his report (A/61/53) and for his diligent \r\nleadership of the Council. We believe that, under his \r\ncapable leadership, the Council will be successful in \r\nfulfilling its mission and will be able to overcome the \r\ndifficulties preventing the attainment of its objectives. \r\n We have replaced the Commission on Human \r\nRights with the Human Rights Council. That was an \r\nimportant step aimed at eliminating all the problems \r\nthat troubled us — problems related to the way in \r\nwhich the international community dealt with human \r\nrights issues as a result of politicization, double \r\nstandards and selectivity. It was hoped that that step \r\nwould gear international political will towards \r\novercoming those difficulties.  \r\n In that regard, we need to develop a clear vision \r\nas to how the new Council will deal with various \r\naspects of the issue of human rights. In the view of my \r\ndelegation, that starts with revising the means by which \r\ncountries’ specific draft resolutions are dealt with both \r\nin the Human Rights Council and in the General \r\nAssembly. There is a need for a firm stand against draft \r\nresolutions that are not based on objective and \r\nunequivocal evidence of systematic violations that \r\ntruly require the attention of the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n On the other hand, we need the Human Rights \r\nCouncil to take firm decisions against grave and \r\nsystematic violations of human rights, such as those \r\ncommitted in the Palestinian territories and Lebanon, \r\nand to take such decisions by consensus, not by \r\ndivisive votes. For us, condemning and deploring alone \r\ndo not work — it is not enough. \r\n We need to establish the ground rules for a \r\nmeaningful relationship between the Council and the \r\nGeneral Assembly, particularly the Assembly’s Third \r\nCommittee. That was the fundamental reason why the \r\nCommission on Human Rights was detached from the \r\nEconomic and Social Council and replaced by the \r\nHuman Rights Council, to become a subsidiary body of \r\nthe General Assembly. \r\n Therefore, any attempt to have the Council take \r\nover the role of the Third Committee will eventually \r\nfail, since that would go against the will of the majority \r\nof this body. It is therefore not only necessary, but also \r\nin the interests of coherence, that the Council report all \r\nof its recommendations, including its resolutions and \r\ndecisions, to the body that is institutionally responsible \r\nin that regard — namely, the Third Committee and, \r\nsubsequently, the General Assembly.  \r\n We are fully confident that, in dealing with \r\nhuman rights issues, the Council will overcome \r\ninherited problems. In this regard, my delegation \r\nbelieves the following steps to be of the utmost \r\nimportance.  \r\n First, we must institutionalize dialogue and \r\ncooperation, not confrontation, as a means of tackling \r\nhuman rights issues, with due regard for the diversity \r\nof cultures and civilizations. This requires us not only \r\nto expand the scope of the work of the Council to \r\nencompass dialogue and interaction with States, but \r\nalso to pool our technical and financial resources to \r\nenable Member States to fulfil better, on their own, \r\ntheir obligations in promoting and protecting human \r\nrights and fundamental freedoms. \r\n Secondly, there is a need to maintain a healthy \r\nand interactive relationship between the Council on the \r\none hand and the Third Committee on the other, since \r\nthe latter is the only international forum in the field of \r\nhuman rights in which all Member States are \r\nrepresented. It was on the basis of that belief that we \r\n A/61/PV.51\r\n \r\n9 06-61126 \r\n \r\nhave extended an invitation to the President to hold \r\nannual interactive dialogues with Third Committee \r\nmembers. \r\n Thirdly, we also need to provide the Council with \r\nthe financial, administrative and technical resources it \r\nneeds to perform its task, as well as to ensure \r\nimplementation, so that it is not faced with financial \r\nconstraints or technical problems, such as those that it \r\nis now facing. Our support for the Human Rights \r\nCouncil in this regard should not be less than our \r\nsupport for the Commission on Human Rights. \r\n Fourthly, it is imperative to successfully complete \r\nthe stage of transition from the Commission on Human \r\nRights to the Human Rights Council by updating the \r\nmandates of the entire galaxy of committees, \r\ncommissions, working groups and institutions in such a \r\nway that the interests of all States and the diversity of \r\nthe thematic issues on the agenda are preserved and \r\nmaintained. \r\n Fifthly, we must coordinate our efforts so as to \r\nensure that equal importance and attention are given to \r\nall aspects of human rights so as to avoid selectivity \r\nand prioritization. \r\n In conclusion, I would like once again to \r\nwelcome the President of the Human Rights Council \r\nand to wish him and the members of the Council all the \r\nbest in their future endeavours aimed at promoting a \r\nbetter understanding of and an international dialogue \r\non human rights issues and to overcome all the \r\nproblems pertaining to the establishment of the \r\nCouncil. My delegation will further study the contents \r\nof the report and present its comments on it when \r\ndiscussing it under the relevant agenda item in the \r\nThird Committee.  \r\n Mr. Sinha (India): My delegation thanks the \r\nPresident of the Human Rights Council for forwarding \r\nthe report of the Council (A/61/53). We convey our \r\nappreciation to him for steering the work of the \r\nCouncil in an effective and efficient manner. My \r\ndelegation also conveys, through you, Madam, our full \r\nsupport to the President of the Council in his \r\nendeavours. \r\n At the outset, we would like to express our \r\nsatisfaction about the General Assembly decision on \r\nthe consideration of the report of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. As the Council is a subsidiary body of the \r\nAssembly, it is natural that all reports and \r\nrecommendations of that Council be transmitted to the \r\nAssembly plenary through the Third Committee, where \r\nthe expertise on human rights issues resides. However, \r\nwe are conscious of the delays that may occur in \r\nconsideration of the report if it were to be referred to \r\nthe Third Committee in its totality, given the different \r\nschedules of the two bodies. We also recognize that the \r\nHuman Rights Council began functioning in June \r\n2006, and hence there is a need to adopt a flexible \r\napproach during the first year, and to formalize the \r\nreporting arrangements between the General Assembly \r\nand the Human Rights Council based on our experience \r\nover the next year. \r\n The creation of the new Human Rights Council \r\nby the General Assembly reflects the collective resolve \r\nand commitment of the Member States to constantly \r\nadjust and improve the framework for addressing \r\nhuman rights challenges. It remains our expectation \r\nthat in its work the new body will be guided by the \r\nspirit of cooperation and mutual understanding. We \r\nhope that the Council will evolve an even-handed \r\napproach in its promotion and protection of all human \r\nrights and translate the right to development into a \r\nreality. It should promote human rights through \r\ninternational cooperation and genuine dialogue among \r\nMember States, including capacity-building and mutual \r\nassistance, and emerge as a forum for voluntary \r\nparticipation and the sharing of national experiences \r\nand best practices in the promotion and protection of \r\nall human rights and fundamental freedoms. \r\n The General Assembly resolution establishing the \r\nCouncil defined the broad parameters of the Council’s \r\narchitecture. It also mandated the Council to develop \r\nthe modalities of its new mechanisms within one year. \r\nThe Council is also required to improve and rationalize \r\nall mandates, mechanisms, functions and \r\nresponsibilities of the former Commission on Human \r\nRights. \r\n The Human Rights Council has so far held two \r\nregular and two special sessions. As we note from the \r\nreport, the Council has set up two intergovernmental \r\nworking groups to devise a universal periodic review \r\nmechanism and to undertake the review and \r\nrationalization of mandates and mechanisms of the \r\nformer Commission on Human Rights. Meanwhile, the \r\nCouncil has taken interim decisions to facilitate the \r\nuninterrupted functioning of the existing mandates \r\nduring the transitional period. The Council also took \r\naction on substantive human rights issues, most \r\nA/61/PV.51  \r\n \r\n06-61126 10 \r\n \r\nnotably its recommendation to the General Assembly \r\non the adoption of the draft Declaration on the Rights \r\nof Indigenous Peoples and the draft International \r\nConvention for the Protection of All Persons from \r\nEnforced Disappearance.  \r\n We note with satisfaction that the mandate of the \r\nWorking Group on the Right to Development has been \r\nextended by one year. Further, by holding two special \r\nsessions, the Human Rights Council has demonstrated \r\nits ability to swiftly react to human rights emergencies. \r\nWe remain conscious of the enormous challenges \r\nahead of the Council in defining and operationalizing \r\nits architecture. Some progress in this regard has \r\nalready been made within the framework of informal \r\nmeetings of the two working groups. However, a lot \r\nremains to be done and therefore the focus of the \r\nCouncil’s work during the remainder of the year should \r\nbe on institution-building. The success of the Human \r\nRights Council would, to a large extent, depend on the \r\noutcome of these processes. \r\n India actively and constructively participated in \r\nthe multilateral negotiations that led to the \r\nestablishment of the new Human Rights Council. We \r\nremain committed to continue to work to make the \r\nHuman Rights Council a strong, effective and efficient \r\nbody capable of promoting and protecting human rights \r\nand fundamental freedoms for all. \r\n Mr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): We welcome the \r\npresentation today of the report of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil (A/61/53) by its President. The establishment \r\nof the Council was one of the crucial decisions in the \r\nfollow-up to the 2005 World Summit. The sometimes \r\noverwrought criticism of the Commission on Human \r\nRights, its predecessor, created the need for setting the \r\nhuman rights discourse on a new basis. The Council \r\noffers the opportunity we all had been looking for to \r\nfocus work of the United Nations on the \r\nimplementation of human rights standards, on engaging \r\nin a genuine dialogue and on a better division of work \r\nbetween Geneva and New York. \r\n The report before us is clearly structured and \r\nmakes a welcome distinction between \r\nrecommendations to the General Assembly and \r\ndecisions taken by the Council. This format reflects the \r\nletter and the spirit of resolution 60/251 in that the \r\nCouncil has, of course, the competence to make \r\nautonomous decisions and, at the same time, make \r\nrecommendations to the General Assembly as the \r\nuniversal body which continues to have competence in \r\nthe field of human rights. The resolution establishing \r\nthe Council makes specific reference, in this context, to \r\nrecommendations for the further development of \r\ninternational law in the field of human rights, and the \r\ntwo recommendations contained in the report have \r\ntherefore been forwarded to the Third Committee for \r\naction.  \r\n On 26 October, as the President described earlier, \r\nthe General Assembly decided on a division of work \r\nbetween the plenary of the General Assembly and the \r\nThird Committee. We expect that this arrangement, \r\nreached after lengthy negotiations in the General \r\nCommittee, will be honoured by all parties until its \r\npossible review at future sessions. \r\n The Council has held only two regular \r\nsessions — the second of which has not yet \r\nconcluded — and two special sessions. It has thus not \r\ngone through a full reporting cycle, and any \r\npronouncement on the substance of its work must be \r\npreliminary. However, we note that the opportunity that \r\nthe establishment of the Council offers has not been \r\nmade use of to the fullest extent. It must be said in \r\nparticular that the spirit of dialogue, which was the \r\nguiding principle in setting up the Council, has not \r\nbeen applied in practice in a satisfactory manner.  \r\n This situation was particularly damaging in \r\nconnection with the second special session, where the \r\nCouncil first remained inactive for a considerable \r\nperiod of time and then was rushed to the adoption of a \r\nresolution that was barely consulted on and therefore \r\npassed by a strongly divided vote.  \r\n In general terms, it is fair to say that the Council \r\nhas not been off to an easy start. It is understood that \r\nthe first year of this new body should focus on \r\ninstitution-building and that the transitional phase the \r\nhuman rights work is going through will necessarily \r\nlead to more limited results on issues of substance. \r\nHowever, areas where substantive action is needed \r\nmust still be forthcoming; results should be sought on \r\nthe basis of consultations that go beyond regions and \r\ninterest groups and with the full involvement of States \r\nthat are not members of the Council.  \r\n One of the new features of the Council that differ \r\nfrom the Commission is the special responsibility \r\nconferred on the members of the Council for upholding \r\nthe highest standards in the promotion and protection \r\nof human rights. This special responsibility does not \r\n A/61/PV.51\r\n \r\n11 06-61126 \r\n \r\nentail, however, the exclusion of States that are not \r\nserving as members. Resolution 60/251 in fact states \r\nquite the opposite, and the discussions in Geneva have \r\nillustrated clearly that the quality of the Council’s work \r\nwould benefit from stronger involvement of States that \r\ndo not serve as members. \r\n While there was much enthusiasm about the fresh \r\nstart for the human rights work of the United Nations, \r\nthere have not been enough concrete ideas about how \r\nto shape this fresh start. We commend the President of \r\nthe Council for the initiatives he has taken in this \r\nrespect, but we also believe that States must come \r\nforward themselves with innovative approaches that \r\nare in keeping with resolution 60/251.  \r\n On several occasions, the temptation to slip back \r\ninto the well-known patterns of the Commission — and \r\nsometimes even worse patterns of behaviour — was \r\ntoo strong to resist for many. This trend must be \r\nreversed and it must be reversed soon. Like any new \r\nbody, the Council must be given a grace period and \r\nhave the opportunity to organize its work and \r\nproceedings in a circumspect and undisturbed manner. \r\nBut this grace period is quickly coming to an end, and \r\nthe efforts to put the Council on a solid foundation are \r\nnowhere near conclusion.  \r\n It is therefore crucial that the close of the second \r\nsession be prepared carefully and in a manner which \r\nleads to the adoption of a limited number of decisions \r\ndealing with matters of substance and matters of \r\nurgency. We should see to it that these decisions are \r\nmade with the strongest possible political support.  \r\n The Council’s third session could also make a \r\nnumber of substantive decisions on the basis of \r\nthorough preparation and wide consultations. In \r\nparallel, the necessary clarity should be created in the \r\narea of working methods, which should be guided by \r\nthe principles of inclusion and dialogue. This approach \r\nwill enable the Council to become a fully operational \r\nand fully functional body, in particular after decisions \r\nhave been reached on the issues of universal periodic \r\nreview and review of special procedures. \r\n Mr. Berruga (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): At the \r\noutset, my delegation would like to thank the President \r\nof the Human Rights Council, Ambassador Luis \r\nAlfonso de Alba, for having introduced this first report \r\nof the Human Rights Council and for the efforts he has \r\nshown in carrying out the Council’s work during this \r\nstage of consolidation. \r\n The establishment of the Human Rights Council \r\nconstitutes the most important progress and updating of \r\nthe institutional human rights multilateral framework \r\nin recent decades. With this decision of the General \r\nAssembly, we have strengthened human rights and \r\nplaced this topic as one of the three major pillars of \r\ncollective action by the international community today. \r\n Mexico welcomes with satisfaction the progress \r\nmade by the Council in the first months of its \r\nendeavours. We trust that, with the constructive spirit \r\nand renewal that led to its establishment, States will \r\nsucceed in overcoming the inertia that in the past has \r\nhad a negative impact on the work of the former \r\nHuman Rights Commission. \r\n Mexico welcomes the fact that the Council has \r\ntaken the first steps in carrying out its important \r\nresponsibilities by developing an international legal \r\nframework for human rights. The adoption and remittal \r\nto this General Assembly of the draft international \r\ninstruments relating to forced disappearances and the \r\nrights of indigenous peoples is clear proof of the \r\nprogress made by the Council in these areas. We hope \r\nto see progress as well in the development of other \r\nimportant instruments and standards under \r\nconsideration by the Council. \r\n On the other hand, the fact that the Council held \r\ntwo special sessions in the first months of its work \r\nindicates a difference in its way of analyzing \r\nemergency human rights situations, as compared with \r\nits predecessor, the Commission. In light of these \r\nimportant advances, it is important to acknowledge \r\nthat, at this stage of formation, the Council is dealing \r\nwith special challenges that demand innovative \r\napproaches in keeping with the high priority and \r\nresponsibilities that the States have conferred upon it. \r\nMore than ever before, we must show our political \r\ncommitment to its work and to provide the Council \r\nwith the necessary tools in order that it can carry out \r\nthe mandate we gave to it barely a few months ago in \r\nthis very Hall. \r\n In this connection, Mexico renews its \r\ncommitment to continue working constructively in the \r\nworking group entrusted with the design of the \r\nmodalities of the universal periodic review mechanism, \r\nwhich, we hope, will be able to lay the foundation to \r\nensure full observance of human rights through \r\ncooperation, transparency and mutual respect. \r\nA/61/PV.51  \r\n \r\n06-61126 12 \r\n \r\n Likewise, we attach the highest importance to the \r\nwork started by the Council on the review of the \r\nmandates of special procedures. Not only should \r\nconsistency be sought in the functioning of special \r\nprocedures, but this exercise must have visible effects \r\non the ground, guaranteeing access by our citizens to \r\navailable international protection mechanisms and \r\nestablishing a clear correlation between the \r\nrecommendations adopted by the Council and their real \r\nimplementation. \r\n At this stage of transition and of institutional \r\nconsolidation of the Council, one of the priority issues \r\nthat we must consider is the establishment of a sound \r\nand clear relationship between the Third Committee \r\nand the Human Rights Council. We must do this so as \r\nnot to put at risk the considerable progress we have \r\nachieved in both bodies. As we see it, the work of these \r\ntwo bodies is complementary, and thus it is most \r\nimportant for us to begin shortly a discussion on their \r\nmutual division of work in order to strengthen a well \r\nintegrated interaction between them and avoid any \r\nunnecessary duplication of functions and initiatives \r\nthat can be detrimental to the work of both bodies. \r\n The success of the Human Rights Council bears a \r\nstrict proportion to the trust that the Member States \r\nplace in it. We must not forget that the establishment of \r\nthe Council came in response to the commitment of us \r\nall to enhance the human rights mechanism of the \r\nUnited Nations in order to ensure that all persons enjoy \r\nall human rights, as set forth in the twelfth preambular \r\nparagraph of resolution 60/251. \r\n Let us make sure that this commitment is \r\ntranslated into tangible actions, thus enabling the \r\nHuman Rights Council to carry out the ambitious \r\nagenda we have given it, so as to be equal to the \r\ndemands of the international community of the United \r\nNations in this very delicate matter. \r\n Mr. Rachkov (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): My \r\ndelegation welcomes the report of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil and expresses its gratitude to Ambassador de \r\nAlba for his work as President. \r\n We also feel that the report should be considered \r\nfirst by the experts in the Third Committee and then in \r\nthe plenary of the General Assembly. \r\n At this time, the Human Rights Council is going \r\nthrough an important and predetermining phase as it \r\nbecomes the fundamental human rights organ of the \r\nUnited Nations. The results of the first session and the \r\ntwo special sessions confirmed the correctness of the \r\nGeneral Assembly decision to establish this United \r\nNations body. Important decisions were adopted to \r\nestablish an intergovernmental open-ended working \r\ngroup to develop the modalities of the universal \r\nperiodic review mechanism and also to analyze and \r\nrationalize the mandates and mechanisms of the special \r\nprocedures. These decisions make it possible for us to \r\nassess critically the inheritance left to us by the Human \r\nRights Commission, to keep what is good and to \r\ndiscard the negative experiences of the Commission. \r\n By adopting United Nations resolution 60/251 on \r\nthe creation of the Human Rights Council, we \r\nconfirmed our determination to ensure universality, \r\nobjectivity and non-selectivity in considering human \r\nrights questions and also the need to eliminate double \r\nstandards and politicization. The universal periodic \r\nreview will allow systematic study of the human rights \r\nsituation in all countries and to assess those situations \r\non the basis of unified criteria. Such an approach must \r\nexclude politicization of human rights issues and \r\nshould serve as the basis for constructive dialogue on \r\nquestions of the observance of human rights. \r\n During the planned review and rationalization of \r\nall of the mandates and mechanisms in the transition \r\nfrom the Committee to the Council, we intend to speak \r\nin favour of keeping and, where necessary, \r\nstrengthening the special procedures. However, this \r\nsupport will be given only to those procedures that \r\nwere not created for political reasons and have not \r\ncompromised the Council by exceeding the powers \r\ncontained in the mandate. The Council must take firm \r\ndecisions on not adopting mandates like those that \r\npoliticized and discredited the Human Rights \r\nCommission and led to the failure of its work. The \r\nnegative experience of the politicization of human \r\nrights issues by individual countries and the \r\napplication of double standards to exert pressure on \r\nother States should be left in the past. This relates in \r\nparticular to resolutions and procedures relating to \r\nspecific countries. In this respect, we note with \r\nsatisfaction that the Council has not eliminated the \r\ncountry mechanisms, but will use them only when truly \r\nnecessary. \r\n However, can we confirm that the politicization \r\nof the mechanisms for the protection of human rights is \r\nin the past? Unfortunately, the answer is no, and this \r\nhas been said before. It is generally recognized that \r\n A/61/PV.51\r\n \r\n13 06-61126 \r\n \r\ntoday no country must escape criticism in the area of \r\nhuman rights. Human rights is a very sensitive issue \r\nfor the majority of States. Unfortunately, some \r\ncountries frequently use this factor within international \r\norganizations to pursue their own political interests. \r\nHaving failed to achieve their goals in the Commission \r\non Human Rights, such States continue to manipulate \r\nhuman rights issues and to introduce politically \r\nmotivated draft resolutions on specific countries in the \r\nThird Committee, thus dragging the international \r\ncommunity into bilateral relations. These Third \r\nCommittee draft resolutions threaten the future and \r\ndestroy the trust of the international community.  \r\n When we carry out reviews, we need to ensure \r\nthat they are comprehensive and that they relate \r\nequally to all countries. In the context of elaborating \r\nthe working methods of the Human Rights Council, we \r\nbelieve that before concluding the process of \r\ndetermining the form of the periodic reviews and \r\nrationalizing the special procedures it would be useful \r\nto call a moratorium on all such country-specific draft \r\nresolutions in the Third Committee.  \r\n We call on the States Members of the United \r\nNations to support our delegation’s position relating to \r\ncountry-specific resolutions, including by refusing to \r\nlend support to the sponsors of politically motivated \r\ndraft resolutions on human rights in Belarus. \r\n Mr. Soler Torrijos (Panama) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nLet my first words be to express our thanks for the \r\nsubmission of the first report of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil to the General Assembly (A/61/53) and to \r\ncongratulate its President, Ambassador Luis Alfonso de \r\nAlba, on his endeavours. The task of building up the \r\nCouncil is in his hands, and we are convinced that \r\nunder his leadership the Council will continue to \r\nbecome stronger as the most appropriate arena for \r\npromoting the work of the United Nations in favour of \r\nthe cause of human rights throughout the world. For us, \r\nit is also fundamental to highlight the work done by the \r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for \r\nHuman Rights in providing significant support for the \r\nsmooth transition from the Commission to the Council.  \r\n With the adoption of General Assembly \r\nresolution 60/251, which established the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, the Council’s foundations were laid and a \r\nnumber of principles to guide its functioning were \r\nestablished. The Council must now carry out the \r\nenormous work of giving these principles greater \r\ncontent and solidity. Like other delegations, we would \r\nhave liked this process to move forward more rapidly. \r\nHowever, we are aware that the Council has before it \r\ndecisions which require a greater level of attention. We \r\ndo not lose sight of the fact that the Council has made \r\nsignificant achievements since it began its operations, \r\nincluding the adoption of the International Convention \r\nfor the Protection of All Persons from Enforced \r\nDisappearances and the United Nations Declaration on \r\nthe Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the holding of \r\ntwo special sessions to deal with urgent violations of \r\nhuman rights.  \r\n It is true that an important part of the work of the \r\nCouncil has been devoted to a large number of \r\nprocedural issues. In this context, we are grateful for \r\nthe support of the Office of the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights in this area, \r\nparticularly with regard to the modalities of the \r\nuniversal periodic review. As we see it, this \r\nmechanism, like that of the special procedures, will be \r\nfundamental in the work of the United Nations to \r\npromote the protection and promotion of all human \r\nrights: civil, political, economic, social and cultural \r\nrights, as well as the right to development.  \r\n There is a great deal of work still to be done here. \r\nProof of the Council’s efficiency in carrying out its \r\nmandates will be in the creation of this universal \r\nperiodic review mechanism and in its capacity to \r\ncorrect the problems of selectivity and excessive \r\npoliticization in analysing the situation of human rights \r\nin countries. \r\n The Human Rights Council still has several \r\nimportant decisions ahead. More than a single \r\nfortunate initiative, what is at stake is the very \r\neffectiveness of the United Nations to fulfil the \r\nprinciples and purposes of the Charter, the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights and the Vienna \r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action with regard to \r\nthe promotion and protection of human rights \r\nthroughout the world. \r\n We take this opportunity to express our opinion \r\non the division of labour which should exist between \r\nthe Third Committee and the Human Rights Council. \r\nThe work of evaluation and follow-up of the situation \r\nof human rights in specific countries is a task for the \r\nHuman Rights Council, whose issues should be \r\naddressed through mechanisms and special procedures \r\nfor that purpose. We believe that the General \r\nA/61/PV.51  \r\n \r\n06-61126 14 \r\n \r\nAssembly’s Third Committee is appropriate only to \r\nadopt general expressions that indicate the \r\ninternational community’s feelings on such topics. In \r\nany case, detailed study on human rights situations and \r\nrecommendations to deal with them are tasks for the \r\nHuman Rights Council, a body which we have \r\nempowered to that end. We urge all delegations to turn \r\nto the Human Rights Council for specific evaluations \r\nand follow-up of emergency situations which affect \r\nhuman rights in any part of the planet. \r\n We have been attentively following the process of \r\nbuilding up the Council. Our country, which was born \r\nlinked to international activity, and which during its \r\nhistory suffered both the consequences of the loss of \r\nhuman rights and the benefits of their recovery, \r\nremains committed to the strengthening of human \r\nrights throughout the world, and in particular the \r\nstrengthening and consolidation of the United Nations \r\nhuman rights machinery. \r\n Mr. Reyes Rodríguez (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThe Cuban delegation has prepared a formal speech for \r\nthis debate. We will give it this afternoon when the \r\nThird Committee has an opportunity to consider the \r\nreport of the Human Rights Council (A/61/53) and to \r\nhear the views of delegations on this issue. \r\nNonetheless, in cooperation with you, Madam, as you \r\ncarry out your mandate as President, and above all \r\nbecause of our respect for the presentation made by the \r\nPresident of the Council, we have agreed to have this \r\ndebate this morning.  \r\n In reality, we believe this is a negative precedent \r\nfor our future work and for the General Assembly’s \r\noversight of the work of the Human Rights Council. \r\nThis debate should never have taken place before the \r\nThird Committee had an opportunity to listen, study \r\nand consider the report of the Human Rights Council. \r\nClearly, Cuba uses every opportunity and every arena \r\nto set out its views in this area which, unfortunately, is \r\none of the main issues on the United Nations agenda.  \r\n Thus, in a sort of brainstorming session, we are \r\ngoing to share some of our views and concerns on the \r\nfuture work of the Human Rights Council.   \r\n First of all, I would like to join other delegations \r\nthat have spoken this morning in expressing our \r\nsincere gratitude for the efforts and skilful guidance of \r\nAmbassador Luis Alfonso de Alba at the helm of the \r\nHuman Rights Council.  \r\n We disagree with delegations that have expressed \r\ngreat concern about what they believe was a disaster in \r\nGeneva. Cuba believes that this is a rather complex \r\nprocess. Moving ahead hastily and taking risks could \r\ntherefore lead to a repetition of the mistakes that led to \r\nthe failure and eventual demise of the Human Rights \r\nCommission. We believe that the key factor that led to \r\nthe establishment of the Council was precisely the need \r\nto put an end to the political manipulation of the work \r\nof the United Nations human rights machinery. I think \r\nthat we would contribute little to the promotion of \r\nhuman rights for all — which, after all, is our main \r\ngoal — if we were to repeat those unsavoury practices.  \r\n In that connection, we share the opinion of the \r\ndelegation of Egypt that there is a need to give \r\nsignificant priority to addressing violations of human \r\nrights wherever they occur in the world. I would like to \r\nemphasize that we are of course not referring to the \r\nsituation in Palestine or violations of human rights in \r\nthe Middle East. Cuba reaffirms its resolute support for \r\nmaintaining the issue of Palestine on agenda of the \r\nHuman Rights Council. The fact that it has been \r\nnecessary to convene three extraordinary sessions of \r\nthe Human Rights Council to consider the situation in \r\nPalestine has not been because the Council has \r\nmanipulated the issue or given it selective treatment. \r\nRegrettably, it has been because of the grave violations \r\nof human rights that are taking place in that part of the \r\nworld, which are affecting the lives of thousands of \r\nwomen, children, older persons and other members of \r\nthe brotherly people of Palestine. \r\n However, we think that is very important, and we \r\nbelieve that one of the first issues to be resolved in the \r\nCouncil’s work is the need to establish clear-cut \r\nprocedures for the adoption of country-specific \r\nresolutions. We believe that when the Commission on \r\nHuman Rights decided to take up the practice of \r\nadopting country-specific resolutions it did so \r\nessentially to address serious, massive and systematic \r\nviolations of human rights. Specifically that pertained \r\nto extrajudicial executions, wide-scale torture and mass \r\nand arbitrary deportations. Unfortunately, the Human \r\nRights Commission in recent years adopted resolutions \r\naimed at questioning the constitutional order in certain \r\ncountries. That is the sort of practice that must be \r\nstopped. That is the sort of interference in the internal \r\naffairs of States — including in particular those that \r\nquestion the right of peoples to self-determination — \r\nthat the Council cannot afford to repeat. \r\n A/61/PV.51\r\n \r\n15 06-61126 \r\n \r\n Another basic issue that we believe must be \r\naddressed is the need to clearly define the subordinate \r\nrole of the Human Rights Council to the various \r\nworking bodies of the General Assembly. Allow me to \r\nrepeat that, as far as Cuba and many other delegations \r\nare concerned, the Third Committee should be the first \r\nbody — and, subsequently, the plenary of the General \r\nAssembly — to take a decision on the report of the \r\nHuman Rights Council. We shall continue our efforts \r\nand demand that that understanding, which we believed \r\nhad already been agreed, is duly implemented. \r\n Another of Cuba’s key concerns has to do with \r\nthe need to find a satisfactory solution to the work \r\ndone by the two bodies created by the Human Rights \r\nCouncil to implement resolution 60/251. I refer \r\nbasically to the working group charged with \r\nestablishing the modalities for the universal periodic \r\nreview mechanism and the working group established \r\nto implement paragraph 6 of resolution 60/251 — the \r\nlatter being the group mandated with rationalizing and \r\nreviewing the work, mandates and mechanisms \r\ninherited from the former Commission on Human \r\nRights. Cuba believes that those two groups must work \r\nin tandem.  \r\n We would like to raise an alarm about the \r\npossibility that a group of countries may attempt to \r\nmake progress on just one track, thereby blocking or \r\nimpeding the implementation of the mandate to review \r\nand rationalize the mechanisms. I should point out that \r\nwe are not making that warning out of delusion or \r\nunfounded concern. It should be recalled that after the \r\nVienna World Conference on Human Rights, the \r\nGeneral Assembly, and basically its Third Committee, \r\ncreated a working group on the implementation of \r\nparagraphs 17 and 18 of the Vienna Declaration. A \r\ngroup of countries, of which Cuba was part, \r\ndemonstrated flexibility, making it possible to make \r\nprogress in setting up the post of United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights while leaving \r\nparagraph 17 pending — a situation that continues \r\ntoday. It will therefore be a priority for Cuba that both \r\ngroups work in tandem and that they fulfil their \r\nmandates simultaneously.  \r\n Another issue we would like to share with the \r\nAssembly has to do with the need to establish an \r\nagenda for the Human Rights Council. By that we do \r\nnot mean the provisional agenda that has been utilized \r\nin the Council sessions to date. We are referring to a \r\nthematic agenda — which will clearly have to include \r\nthe issue of Palestine — that will make it possible for \r\ndelegations to truly be prepared for substantive Council \r\ndebates. At the Council’s third session, Cuba, along \r\nwith a group of delegations, will make a major effort to \r\nwork on this issue. \r\n Mr. Majoor (Netherlands), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair. \r\n Another concern of the Cuban delegation pertains \r\nto the need, as the Council consolidates itself, for it to \r\nclearly define its working methods and procedures. I \r\nmention this because resolution 60/251 is very clear in \r\nindicating that the rules of procedure of the General \r\nAssembly are the fundamental basis for the work of the \r\nHuman Rights Council. Let me say, however, that the \r\ndelegation of Cuba has felt that a group of delegations \r\nis questioning the validity of the rules of the General \r\nAssembly for the work of the Human Rights Council. \r\nIn so doing they are seeking to avoid the use of points \r\nof order, procedural motions and other established and \r\naccepted practices in the Assembly’s rules of \r\nprocedure. \r\n In conclusion, allow me to say that this great \r\nundertaking cannot succeed if we do not achieve \r\nprogress with regard to the issue of equitable \r\ngeographic composition of the Office of the United \r\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Cuba \r\nrecently circulated a draft resolution that enjoys \r\nsignificant co-sponsorship and is designed to move \r\nahead so that the General Assembly can pronounce on \r\nthe need to achieve equitable geographic \r\nrepresentation. This is not a second-tier issue. Let me \r\nsay that, as the Assembly is aware, the Office, its staff \r\nand experts are precisely the ones who prepare reports \r\nand documents and provide all the substantive support \r\nfor the Council’s work. We can achieve the objective of \r\na Council that is truly universal, representative of \r\nevery region of the world and reflective of all the \r\nworld’s religions, as well as a Council that takes into \r\naccount our cultural diversity and points of view as it \r\nseeks to provide full human rights for all, only when \r\nwe also achieve the goal of improving the composition \r\nof the membership of the Office. \r\n Lastly, I wish to reiterate Cuba’s support for the \r\nefforts of the President of the Human Rights Council. \r\nWe will work with all truly interested delegations that \r\nwish to ensure that the Council is the sort of body our \r\npeoples need to make progress in ensuring full human \r\nrights for all. We will not allow the Human Rights \r\nA/61/PV.51  \r\n \r\n06-61126 16 \r\n \r\nCouncil to become a new inquisition tribunal to be \r\nused against the countries of the South, or to repeat the \r\npolitical manipulation of the Council’s work, which so \r\nadversely affected the work of the Commission on \r\nHuman Rights. \r\n Mr. Normandin (Canada) (spoke in French): At \r\nthe outset, I would like to express our sincere gratitude \r\nto the President of the Human Rights Council for all \r\nthe work he has done, as well as for his introduction of \r\nthe Council’s report (A/61/53) this morning. \r\n The adoption on 15 March of resolution 60/251, \r\nwhich established the Human Rights Council as a \r\nsubsidiary organ of the General Assembly, was a \r\nhistoric opportunity to renew and reinforce our \r\ncollective efforts to fulfil our common purpose under \r\nthe Charter as Member States to promote and \r\nencourage respect for human rights. The establishment \r\nof the Human Rights Council was a significant \r\nmilestone in making human rights, along with security \r\nand development, one of the three pillars of the work \r\nof the United Nations, as agreed by our leaders at the \r\n2005 Summit. In the words of Secretary-General Kofi \r\nAnnan, “we will not enjoy development without \r\nsecurity, we will not enjoy security without \r\ndevelopment, and we will not enjoy either without \r\nrespect for human rights” (A/59/2005, para. 17). \r\n Resolution 60/251 established a strong \r\nfoundation and set out great responsibilities for this \r\nnew organ. The Council’s first responsibility is to \r\npromote universal respect for the protection of human \r\nrights and fundamental freedoms, without distinction \r\nof any kind and in a fair and balanced manner. The \r\nCouncil is also responsible for addressing situations of \r\nviolations of human rights, including gross and \r\nsystematic violations, and for drafting \r\nrecommendations in that regard. We have taken note of \r\nthe fact that the General Assembly has indicated that \r\nthe Council’s work should be guided by the principles \r\nof universality, impartiality, objectivity, non-\r\nselectivity, constructive international dialogue and \r\ncooperation. We must not fail to fulfil those \r\nresponsibilities, for if we do we will fail all those \r\naround the world who have placed their hopes for \r\nbetter lives in larger freedom in this new organ. \r\n Canada was honoured to be elected by the \r\nAssembly as a member of the Council. In announcing \r\nits candidacy for the Council, Canada made a pledge to \r\nwork for an effective Council and to continue to \r\ncooperate with its mechanisms and with the Office of \r\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Human \r\nRights. Canada intends to honour its pledge. All \r\nmembers of the Council and all States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations have a duty to cooperate with the \r\nCouncil and its mechanisms. \r\n In resolution 60/251, the General Assembly \r\ndecided that the Human Rights Council should submit \r\nan annual report to it. The report that has been \r\npresented to us today covers the Council’s first session \r\nas well as its first and second special sessions. The \r\nCouncil made significant achievements at its first \r\nsession, in particular the adoption by consensus of a \r\nnew Convention that will strengthen protections \r\nagainst enforced disappearance, which are a grave \r\nhuman rights violation that continue to be perpetrated \r\naround the world. Canada was pleased to be able to \r\nparticipate in a dialogue with the High Commissioner \r\nfor Human Rights following the Council’s first session. \r\nWe reiterate our support for the High Commissioner \r\nand underscore the independence of his functions.  \r\n The Council also established by consensus two \r\nworking groups. One will carry out the important task \r\nof determining the modalities of the universal periodic \r\nreview, a process that will promote the implementation \r\nby all States of their obligations, and the other will \r\nfocus on the review and strengthening of the mandates \r\nof the former Commission on Human Rights. During \r\nthis year of transition, the Council should focus on \r\nestablishing strong institutions while at the same time \r\nfulfilling its mandate to promote respect for human \r\nrights. That is a difficult but crucial task. \r\n Nevertheless, it was disappointing that at the \r\nCouncil’s first session some States chose to pursue the \r\npath of divisiveness rather than the more constructive \r\npath of international dialogue and cooperation that the \r\nAssembly called for in resolution 60/251. We regret the \r\nadoption by the Council of some instruments and \r\ndecisions by a vote, where more dialogue could have \r\nled to broader agreement and greater impact on the \r\nground. \r\n The Council is not an end in itself, but a means to \r\nan end. The Council provides an opportunity to show \r\nthat a focus on implementation, dialogue and \r\ncooperation can produce measurable improvements \r\nwith regard to human rights where it matters most, \r\nnamely, on the ground. We must build on the \r\nfoundation of resolution 60/251 to ensure that the \r\n A/61/PV.51\r\n \r\n17 06-61126 \r\n \r\nCouncil is truly effective in protecting human rights \r\nand that it makes a positive difference in the lives of \r\npeople around the world. Canada has always been a \r\nproponent of multilateralism — but effective \r\nmultilateralism that favours results over processes.  \r\n The challenges are huge, because establishing \r\nand strengthening institutions requires a great deal of \r\ntime, creativity and commitment. All States Members \r\nof the United Nations must reaffirm their commitment \r\nto seize the opportunity provided by resolution 60/251 \r\nby fulfilling the Council’s responsibility to promote \r\nrespect for human rights for all. Canada will work to \r\nensure that the Council is able to respond to urgent \r\nhuman rights situations and that it maintains a focus on \r\nthe implementation of the rights that belong to \r\neveryone. \r\n Mr. Maurer (Switzerland) (spoke in French): We \r\nwould like to thank the President of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil for his report (A/61/53) on the Council’s initial \r\nwork. We would also like to thank him personally for \r\nhis tireless endeavours as President of the Council. \r\n Switzerland welcomes the 26 October 2006 \r\ndecision of the General Assembly regarding the \r\nallocation of agenda item 68, entitled “Report of the \r\nHuman Rights Council”. My delegation supports the \r\ncompromise through which this year’s report of the \r\nCouncil will be taken up both in plenary meeting and \r\nin the Third Committee, on the understanding that the \r\nCommittee will focus solely on the recommendations \r\nof the Human Rights Council to the General Assembly, \r\nincluding recommendations aimed at the development \r\nof international human rights law. We favour such a \r\ndistribution of work and believe that this compromise \r\nis valid this year because the Human Rights Council \r\ndid not begin its work until June 2006. \r\n The Human Rights Council constitutes one of the \r\nmajor reforms of the Organization. It is a decisive step \r\ntowards the promotion and the protection of human \r\nrights that reflects our collective determination to place \r\nthe three pillars of the United Nations — security, \r\ndevelopment and human rights — on the same level. \r\nHowever, we would like to emphasize that this is only \r\none phase, for real reform to promote and protect \r\nhuman rights will entail fully implementing resolution \r\n60/251, which established the Human Rights Council. \r\n We began that implementation by inaugurating \r\nthe Human Right Council at Geneva on 19 June 2006, \r\na new United Nations body that Switzerland is proud to \r\nhost. Above all, we launched the hope that henceforth \r\nvictims of human rights violations will be able to \r\nbenefit from increased protection and that the more \r\nambitious goal of preventing such violations could be \r\nachieved. We must ensure that that hope is translated \r\ninto reality, for the sake of the credibility of the United \r\nNations. \r\n The first sessions of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil — the regular and special sessions alike — \r\nhave illustrated that the Council provides us with an \r\nadequate tool to achieve the goal we have set for \r\nourselves. The regular sessions were able to address \r\nboth questions of substance and those pertaining to the \r\nconsolidation of the Commission itself. In particular, \r\nwe welcome the substantial interactive dialogue that \r\ntook place during the second regular session between \r\nStates, civil society and the High Commissioner for \r\nHuman Rights, dealing with the special procedures by \r\ntheme and by country. \r\n The holding of the two special sessions on the \r\nsituation in the Gaza Strip and in Lebanon also \r\ndemonstrated that the Council has the capacity to \r\nintervene promptly in the event of a human rights \r\nemergency, in accordance with its mandate. There is, of \r\ncourse, room for improvement, especially as regards \r\nhow draft resolutions are introduced and adopted. Let \r\nus recall that the culture of dialogue that all Members \r\nof the United Nations desire must be strengthened. \r\nMembers of the Council must in the future demonstrate \r\ntheir willingness to negotiate. It is crucial that the \r\nMember States of the Council adopt a more coherent \r\napproach that is more in line with the commitments \r\nthey undertook voluntarily regarding the Council. \r\nMoreover, the human rights situations in other contexts \r\nand parts of the world also merit specific and detailed \r\nexamination. \r\n At this stage, the Council is still an instrument \r\nwhose use is a sensitive matter. We should all \r\ndemonstrate an open and constructive spirit in order to \r\nfurther strengthen this new body. The Council has the \r\npotential to strengthen and to improve the United \r\nNations human rights system — if resolution 60/251 is \r\nfully implemented — through the potential for \r\ncooperation in this new body, the innovation of the \r\nuniversal periodic review process and by an increase in \r\nthe number of sessions, which will make possible more \r\nsustained commitment throughout the year. \r\nA/61/PV.51  \r\n \r\n06-61126 18 \r\n \r\n The months that remain until the end of June \r\n2007, when the Council’s first year will conclude, \r\nshould enable us to put in place a universal periodic \r\nreview mechanism and to revise and adapt the \r\nmandates transferred from the Commission on Human \r\nRights. Such institutional consolidation is a priority. At \r\nthe same time, it will be crucial to demonstrate that the \r\nCouncil can respond appropriately and effectively to \r\nsituations in which human rights are violated.  \r\n The tasks awaiting us in Geneva are therefore \r\nsubstantial, but they are not insurmountable. It will \r\nalso be important to determine the relationship and \r\ndistribution of tasks between the Third Committee and \r\nthe Human Rights Council. That matter is currently \r\npending, but will require the attention and commitment \r\nof all the actors concerned in the capitals, in Geneva \r\nand in New York. \r\n In conclusion, if we can set partisan and \r\nideological differences aside in order to focus on the \r\ninterests of victims, we will succeed. Those interests \r\ntake precedence, and must always take precedence, \r\nbecause it is on that criterion alone that the Human \r\nRights Council and the United Nations will ultimately \r\nbe judged. \r\n Ms. Martina (Ukraine): It is an honour to \r\nparticipate in the discussion of the first report \r\n(A/61/53) of the Human Rights Council to the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n The establishment of the Council and the \r\nbeginning of its functioning launched a new era in our \r\nefforts to achieve universal promotion and protection \r\nof human rights. It also marked a significant step \r\ntowards the implementation of commitments made at \r\nthe World Summit in 2005. \r\n We welcome the report of the Council, which was \r\nintroduced by the Council’s President, Ambassador de \r\nAlba. It is important that the efforts of the Council’s \r\nmembers at the first session were aimed at ensuring the \r\neffective functioning of this universal human rights \r\nbody and, in particular, at fully employing the potential \r\navailable in all of the Commission’s valuable assets \r\nand not allowing them to be lost during the transition \r\nprocess. In that regard, we welcome the Council’s \r\ndecision to extend all of the Commission’s mandates, \r\nmechanisms, functions and responsibilities, which \r\nshould be further strengthened and become useful \r\ninstruments for the Council. We also appreciate the \r\nCouncil’s adoption of the draft International \r\nConvention for the Protection of All Persons from \r\nEnforced Disappearance. We would like to express our \r\nfull support for its adoption by the General Assembly. \r\n Ukraine has always supported the elaboration of \r\nan international instrument for the effective protection \r\nand promotion of the rights of indigenous peoples. \r\nUnfortunately, owing to the procedure used for the \r\nintroduction of proposals for adoption by the Council, \r\nthe Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, \r\nwhile containing very useful provisions aimed at \r\nprotecting the rights of indigenous peoples, contained \r\nsome fundamental flaws and did not enjoy consensus \r\nin the Council. \r\n A huge amount of work remains to be done in \r\norder to make the Council work without confrontation \r\nand avoiding the selective, politicized and double-\r\nstandard approaches, for which the Commission was \r\nwidely criticized in the past. Constructive dialogue and \r\ncooperation should be the basis for the Council’s \r\nefforts to improve the record of States in the area of \r\nhuman rights. We see that task as having been the \r\nprimary aim of the reform from the very outset. \r\n We are, therefore, convinced that it is important \r\nto establish a productive universal periodic review \r\nmechanism that is based on clear-cut criteria applicable \r\nto all countries without exception and aimed at \r\nproviding specific conclusions and actionable \r\nrecommendations. We welcome the fact that the \r\nCouncil has begun this important work and hope that \r\nthat task will be completed by the end of the Council’s \r\nfirst year of work. \r\n While improving existing United Nations \r\nmechanisms and developing new approaches to the \r\nprotection and promotion of human rights, the Council \r\nshould also pay special attention to the development of \r\nprevention mechanisms. It should speak out clearly and \r\nin a timely manner against emerging situations that \r\nmight bring about gross violations of human rights. \r\n We also believe that the Council must develop \r\nmechanisms to establish interaction and cooperation \r\nwith regional and subregional organizations. Indeed, \r\nwhile there are organizations with great experience in \r\nhuman rights issues, there are also subregional entities \r\nthat could also contribute to, and gain from, \r\ncooperation with the Council. Among them are the \r\nUkrainian-Georgian joint initiative known as the \r\nCommunity of Democratic Choice and the \r\nOrganization for Democracy and Economic \r\n A/61/PV.51\r\n \r\n19 06-61126 \r\n \r\nDevelopment, which see as one of their main \r\nobjectives the goal of intensifying cooperation in the \r\nfields of democracy, human rights and the rule of law. \r\n As a member of the Council, Ukraine will make \r\nevery effort to ensure that the Human Rights Council \r\nfulfils its mandate responsibly and effectively, thereby \r\nimproving the effectiveness of United Nations \r\nmechanisms in the areas of protecting and promoting \r\nhuman rights throughout the world. \r\n Mr. Saeed (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): Allow me \r\nat the outset to welcome the President of the Human \r\nRights Council, Ambassador De Alba, and thank him \r\nfor introducing his report to the General Assembly. We \r\nare grateful for his efforts and those of all the members \r\nof the Council. \r\n The Sudan will make a detailed statement on the \r\nreport, complete with recommendations and \r\nobservations, when it is debated under agenda item 68 \r\nin the Third Committee this afternoon. \r\n The Sudan participated actively and in a spirit of \r\npurposeful, constructive dialogue in the lengthy \r\nconsultations that culminated in the establishment of \r\nthe Human Rights Council and the adoption by the \r\nGeneral Assembly of resolution 60/251 on 15 March. \r\nThe Council was created within the framework of \r\nreforming and reinvigorating the Organization in order \r\nto dispel the stagnation that has characterized it over \r\nthe past 60 years and made it unable to express and \r\nreflect the new realities, facts and events of the \r\ninternational community.  \r\n The arguments put forward by the United States \r\nduring the consultations were an extension of its \r\nunilateral attitude, arrogance and false pretensions to \r\nbeing the sole judge and jury in the field of human \r\nrights. The isolated and isolationist arguments made by \r\nthe United States delegation were not accepted by the \r\nMembers because they were clearly a politicized \r\nexpression of selectivity and double standards. The \r\nGeneral Assembly’s decision to adopt the resolution on \r\nthe Human Rights Council was strongly opposed by \r\nthe United States because it did not correspond to that \r\ncountry’s wishes and whims, whereby the Council \r\nwould have become a pliable instrument to help the \r\nUnited States achieve its ambitions and carry out its \r\nschemes. Those whims and schemes were rejected \r\nthrough the exercise of the free will of the Member \r\nStates, thereby defeating the United States \r\nexclusionary exercise, which was totally unacceptable \r\nto the international community. \r\n During the consultations, the Member States had \r\nhoped that the Human Rights Council would be a \r\nframework for cooperation through dialogue and \r\nobjectivity in order to avoid confrontation and the \r\ntargeting of States of the South. That, of course, was \r\nunacceptable to the United States delegation, which \r\nchose the path of confrontation and the targeting of \r\ncertain States. \r\n If they had been made by a country that respects \r\nand consecrates human rights and has a clean or, at the \r\nvery least, reasonable human rights record, the \r\nreferences to the human rights situation in the Sudan \r\nmight have been found acceptable. We would have \r\nexpressed our desire to convene a dialogue allowing us \r\nto exchange information and to seek to explain the \r\nreality of the situation in the Sudan and Darfur. \r\nHowever, because they were made by the United \r\nStates — the world’s worst violator of human rights — \r\nthose references were amazing and ridiculous. \r\n All are aware of the enormity of the gross human \r\nrights violations in the United States. The scandals of \r\nGuantánamo, Abu Ghraib, the clandestine prisons, and \r\nlaws that violate the liberties, freedoms and privacy of \r\nAmerican citizens through surveillance and other \r\nmeans are there for all to see. Our memory is fresh of \r\nthe United States shameful support for the apartheid \r\nregime of South Africa. The story of United States \r\nhuman rights violations is not new, but history repeats \r\nitself every day and at every moment.  \r\n We call on the United States to address its human \r\nrights situation at home before it uses and abuses \r\nhuman rights forums to settle political scores and to \r\nachieve its narrow objectives and interests. We hope \r\nthat the Human Rights Council will be a reflection of \r\nthe approach favouring dialogue, cooperation and \r\nobjectivity, and not that of the confrontation and \r\nselectivity that led us to reconsider the circumstances \r\nof the former Commission on Human Rights and to \r\nestablish the new Council.  \r\n The Sudan reaffirms its commitment to working \r\nwith the international community for the promotion \r\nand protection of human rights through mechanisms of \r\ncooperation, dialogue and capacity-building based on \r\nimpartiality, objectivity and the absence of \r\npoliticization, selectivity and double standards. \r\nA/61/PV.51  \r\n \r\n06-61126 20 \r\n \r\n Mr. Badji (Senegal) (spoke in French): My \r\ndelegation warmly congratulates the President and all \r\nthe members of the Human Rights Council for the \r\nimportant work they have done this year, as reflected in \r\nthe report submitted for our attention. \r\n The General Assembly’s consideration of the first \r\nreport of the Human Rights Council, less than a year \r\nafter its establishment, is an historic moment allowing \r\nus to focus on the functioning, effectiveness and \r\nefficiency of that body. It is certainly premature to take \r\nstock or even to make an exhaustive assessment of the \r\nwork of the Council, which is still in its first year of \r\nfunctioning. However, given the conditions that \r\nprevailed at its establishment, we need to be attentive \r\nto its first steps. \r\n My delegation feels it wise to recall that it was to \r\npreserve and consolidate the achievements of the \r\nformer Commission on Human Rights and, above all, \r\nto mitigate its shortcomings that we decided \r\nunanimously on 3 April to create a body capable of \r\nensuring the universal, objective and non-selective \r\nconsideration of human rights matters.  \r\n Now that the Council has been up and running for \r\na few months, it is time to welcome the climate in \r\nwhich its work has been undertaken at its several \r\nsessions, as well as the spirit of cooperation and \r\ndialogue displayed by member States. Particular \r\nattention was paid to making the Council’s working \r\nmethods more transparent and inclusive, thereby \r\nguaranteeing justice, equity and the full participation \r\nof all actors. During this transitional period and \r\nbeyond, such an environment and adequate resources \r\nare essential if that body is to meet the expectations \r\nthat led to its creation. \r\n Returning to the report, my country welcomes the \r\nadoption of certain resolutions and decisions that will \r\nhave a broad impact on the entire international \r\ncommunity, such as that relating to the International \r\nConvention for the Protection of All Persons from \r\nEnforced Disappearance. We invite the General \r\nAssembly to adopt this international instrument which \r\nstrengthens the system of protection of human rights.  \r\n As regards the United Nations Declaration on the \r\nRights of Indigenous Peoples, my delegation feels that, \r\nalthough this is an extremely important text, it is \r\nessential that we expand and deepen consultations on \r\nthis subject so as to fill in any possible gaps and \r\nachieve the broadest possible consensus.  \r\n Here, I should also like to encourage the working \r\ngroup concerned with devising the modalities for the \r\nprocedure for the universal periodic review of the \r\nprotection and promotion of human rights in all \r\ncountries, a mechanism that will be important, \r\nimpartial and fair. \r\n In this same context, we should also welcome the \r\nadoption at the two special sessions of the Human \r\nRights Council of resolutions on the urgent \r\nhumanitarian situation in Palestine and in Lebanon, \r\nwhich is still at the forefront of our attention.  \r\n We share the conviction that the respect and \r\npromotion of all human rights without distinction, \r\nincluding the right to development, is one of the main \r\nguarantees of peace and stability at the national and \r\ninternational levels. That is why we must ensure that \r\nwe denounce and, if necessary, take appropriate \r\nmeasures to deal with all forms of violations of human \r\nrights, without prejudice and with full objectivity. \r\n Our fight should also lead to encouraging all \r\ncountries to become party to and to conform with \r\npertinent international instruments relating to the \r\nrespect and protection of human rights.  \r\n Senegal, reaffirming its devotion to the respect of \r\nhuman rights, once again welcomes the establishment \r\nof the Human Rights Council and undertakes to spare \r\nno effort to enable it to discharge its mission \r\nsuccessfully in accordance with its statement of \r\ncommitment. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on this item. The Assembly has \r\nthus concluded this stage of its consideration of agenda \r\nitem 68.  \r\nOrganization of work \r\n \r\n [The President in the Chair.] \r\n The President: I should like to consult members \r\nregarding the extension of the work of the Sixth \r\nCommittee.  \r\n Members will recall that at its second plenary on \r\n13 September 2006, the General Assembly approved \r\nthe recommendation of the General Committee that the \r\nSixth Committee would complete its work by \r\nThursday, 9 November 2006. However, I have been \r\ninformed by the Chairman of the Sixth Committee that \r\nthe Committee has not been able to conclude its work \r\nby Thursday, 9 November, and would need an \r\nadditional meeting on 15 or 16 November 2006, \r\ndepending on the availability of conference services. \r\n A/61/PV.51\r\n \r\n21 06-61126 \r\n \r\n May I therefore take it that the General Assembly \r\nagrees to extend the work of the Sixth Committee for \r\none additional meeting? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The meeting rose at 12.30 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
