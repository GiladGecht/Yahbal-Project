(Bahrain) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 108 (continued) \r\n \r\nCooperation between the United Nations and \r\nregional and other organizations \r\n \r\n (g) Cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe Council of Europe: draft resolution \r\n(A/61/L.14) \r\n \r\n (i) Cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe Economic Cooperation Organization: draft \r\nresolution (A/61/L.8) \r\n \r\n (m) Cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe League of Arab States: draft resolution \r\n(A/61/L.17) \r\n \r\n The President: Members will recall that the \r\nAssembly held its debate on sub-items (a) through (t) \r\nof agenda item 108 at its 38th and 39th plenary \r\nmeetings, on 22 October. \r\n I call on the representative of the Russian \r\nFederation to introduce draft resolution A/61/L.14. \r\n Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): As the Chairman of the Ministerial \r\nCommittee of the Council of Europe, Russia has the \r\nhonour to present a draft resolution entitled \r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nCouncil of Europe”, contained in document A/61/L.14, \r\nunder agenda item 108 (g). \r\n It is also my pleasure to announce that Austria, \r\nAzerbaijan, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, \r\nCanada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, \r\nGeorgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, \r\nKazakhstan, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, \r\nMontenegro, Norway, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the \r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia have joined \r\nthe list of sponsors. \r\n I wish to thank all the sponsors of the draft \r\nresolution for their contributions and strong support, as \r\nwell as those delegations that participated so \r\nconstructively in its harmonization. \r\n The draft resolution on cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and Council of Europe fully meets the \r\naspirations of both organizations to closer cooperation \r\nin the field of peace and security, the defence of human \r\nrights, the struggle against terrorism, conflict \r\nprevention and post-conflict peacebuilding. Its \r\nadoption will no doubt promote the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and the principle \r\nstrategic goals adopted at the Third Summit of the \r\nCouncil of Europe, held in Warsaw, on the basis of \r\ndemocracy, human rights, the rule of law, cultural \r\ndiversity and social solidarity. \r\n I call on all States members of the General \r\nAssembly to pursue the partnership relations that have \r\ndeveloped between the two organizations and to \r\nconsolidate the shared work of the United Nations and \r\nregional organizations. \r\nA/61/PV.52  \r\n \r\n06-61315 2 \r\n \r\n In conclusion, I express my sincere gratitude to \r\nall States members of the Council of Europe for their \r\nspirit of cooperation during our presidency. We hope \r\nthat the draft resolution on cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and the Council of Europe will be \r\nadopted by the General Assembly without a vote and \r\nby consensus. \r\n The President: The Assembly will now take \r\ndecisions on the draft resolutions contained in \r\ndocuments A/61/L.8, A/61/L.14 and A/61/L.17. \r\n We turn first to draft resolution A/61/L.8, entitled \r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nEconomic Cooperation Organization”.  \r\n May I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt \r\ndraft resolution A/61/L.8? \r\n Draft resolution A/61/L.8 was adopted (resolution \r\n61/12). \r\n The President: We shall now turn to draft \r\nresolution A/61/L.14, entitled “Cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and the Council of Europe”. \r\n Cyprus has joined the list of sponsors of draft \r\nresolution A/61/L.14. \r\n May I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt \r\ndraft resolution A/61/L.14? \r\n Draft resolution A/61/L.14 was adopted \r\n(resolution 61/13). \r\n The President: We shall now turn to draft \r\nresolution A/61/L.17, entitled “Cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and the League of Arab States”. \r\n May I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt \r\ndraft resolution A/61/L.17? \r\n Draft resolution A/61/L.17 was adopted \r\n(resolution 61/14). \r\n The President: May I take it that it is the wish of \r\nthe General Assembly to conclude its consideration of \r\nsub-items (g), (i) and (m) of agenda item 108? \r\n It was so decided. \r\nAgenda item 69 \r\n \r\nStrengthening of the coordination of humanitarian \r\nand disaster relief assistance of the United Nations, \r\nincluding special economic assistance: reports of the \r\nSecretary-General (A/61/79 and A/61/463) \r\n \r\n (a) Strengthening of the coordination of emergency \r\nhumanitarian assistance of the United Nations \r\n \r\n  Letter by the Secretary-General (A/61/550) \r\n \r\n  Reports of the Secretary-General (A/61/85, \r\nA/61/87 and A/61/314) \r\n \r\n (d) Assistance to the Palestinian people: report of \r\nthe Secretary-General (A/61/80) \r\n \r\n The President: So far this year, the world has \r\nbeen spared major natural disasters and there have been \r\nfresh opportunities for peace, be they in Uganda, the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo or Timor-Leste. As \r\na result of those favourable circumstances, there has \r\nbeen a reduction in the number of events requiring \r\nhumanitarian assistance this year.  \r\n That pause gives the United Nations opportunity \r\nto focus preparedness activities in several regions \r\nprone to natural events and to consolidate the \r\nhumanitarian reforms initiated during the World \r\nSummit in September 2005. That reform programme \r\nhas already been successful.  \r\n The Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), \r\nestablished by the General Assembly last December, \r\nhas delivered time-critical responses, saving lives in 25 \r\ncountries. It was particularly effective during the \r\nLebanon crisis this summer, providing immediate \r\nfunding for the transportation of humanitarian goods \r\nacross Lebanon when no funds would have been \r\navailable otherwise. It will be important to continue to \r\nimprove CERF and to ensure that it is fully funded in \r\nfuture.  \r\n Last week, the Secretary-General’s High-level \r\nPanel on United Nations System-wide Coherence noted \r\nthat the United Nations has a unique and leading role \r\nto play in humanitarian disasters and emergencies. The \r\nPanel also recommended various measures to enhance \r\nthat role further, building on the ongoing reforms.  \r\n The humanitarian community continues to face a \r\nnumber of challenges in various areas.  \r\n First, there are a number of ongoing emergencies \r\nthat need to be addressed urgently, such as the drought \r\nin the Horn of Africa, which is affecting 15 million \r\npeople in five countries. Drought cycles have \r\nincreasingly rendered populations more vulnerable to \r\nminor shocks that can disrupt livelihoods, trigger \r\nfamine and even cause conflicts.  \r\n A/61/PV.52\r\n \r\n3 06-61315 \r\n \r\n Secondly, access to populations in need of \r\nhumanitarian assistance remains an issue of great \r\nconcern. In the Darfur region of the Sudan, 3.6 million \r\npeople are in need of relief supplies. However, access \r\nfor humanitarian personnel is restricted due to growing \r\ninsecurity. Since 30 June this year, 12 humanitarian \r\nworkers have been killed in Darfur. A substantial grant \r\nfrom the Central Emergency Response Fund has \r\nallowed helicopter access to remote areas, but only for \r\na three-month period. That is not a sustainable \r\nsolution.  \r\n Thirdly, gender-based violence is also an issue of \r\nconcern to the humanitarian community. Sexual \r\nviolence is only one form of gender-based violence; \r\nforced conscription and the recruitment of boys into \r\nmilitary ranks are others. Member States have the \r\nprime responsibility for preventing those violations by \r\nputting in place measures to prosecute perpetrators and \r\nby establishing structures to take care of their victims.  \r\n Finally, today’s debate also covers sub-item (d) \r\non assistance to the Palestinian people. Significant \r\nlong-term financial support from the international \r\ncommunity is needed in order to avoid a further \r\ndegradation of the humanitarian and economic \r\nsituation in Palestine. Due to the ongoing political \r\nuncertainty and economic hardship, United Nations \r\nagencies have directed most of their activities towards \r\nimmediate emergency assistance.  \r\n As we conduct our deliberations today, let us \r\nkeep in mind all the vulnerable people around the \r\nworld in need of humanitarian assistance. Our common \r\nefforts to strengthen the coordination of the \r\nhumanitarian and emergency response system of the \r\nUnited Nations should seek to reduce the suffering and \r\nimprove the chances of survival in times of \r\nemergencies. We must not fail those who depend on the \r\nUnited Nations as their final hope.  \r\n Ms. Lintonen (Finland): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the European Union (EU). The \r\nacceding countries Bulgaria and Romania; the \r\ncandidate countries Turkey, Croatia and the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia; the countries of the \r\nStabilisation and Association Process and potential \r\ncandidates Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and \r\nSerbia; as well as Ukraine and the Republic of \r\nMoldova align themselves with this declaration. \r\n The European Union wishes to thank the \r\nSecretary-General for the reports provided for this \r\nsession. At the outset, the European Union wishes to \r\nexpress its condolences to respective countries in view \r\nof recent humanitarian emergencies resulting in lost \r\nlives and livelihoods. We wish to pay tribute to the \r\ncourageous humanitarian field workers and express our \r\nsorrow over the personnel who have lost their lives in \r\nbringing assistance to those in need. \r\n The European Union is committed to advancing \r\nthe humanitarian reform agenda to promote a more \r\npredictable and effective humanitarian response, \r\nincluding the development of a stronger standing \r\nresponse capacity, improved coordination capacity and \r\nmore predictable funding. The Union wishes to \r\nreaffirm the United Nations leadership role in \r\nhumanitarian action and welcomes the improvements \r\nin humanitarian response now under way as a result of \r\nthe reform efforts. However, joint and decisive action \r\nis needed to further improve humanitarian action and \r\nto prevent crises from the outset. The European Union \r\nis especially alarmed at the deteriorating humanitarian \r\nand security situation in the Sudan, particularly in \r\nDarfur, and in Sri Lanka. \r\n The humanitarian principles of humanity, \r\nneutrality, impartiality and independence remain the \r\ncornerstones for the provision of humanitarian \r\nassistance, which has to be needs-based. That is what \r\nmakes humanitarian assistance unique and is \r\nsomething we as humanitarian actors are committed to. \r\nThe European Union is an active proponent of \r\ninternational humanitarian law, human rights and \r\nrefugee law, including the protection of civilians and \r\nhumanitarian personnel. \r\n The primary responsibility for the protection of \r\ncivilians rests with national Governments. In that \r\nregard, we also recall the World Summit outcome of \r\nlast year on the responsibility to protect. Based on that \r\nresponsibility of national Governments, the European \r\nUnion wishes to strongly urge all Governments and \r\nparties to conflict to ensure safe and unimpeded access \r\nto humanitarian assistance and the protection of \r\naffected populations. The protection and security of \r\nstaff, both in the field and at Headquarters, is of utmost \r\nimportance. Attacks on humanitarian personnel cannot, \r\nunder any circumstances, be tolerated. The European \r\nUnion strongly condemns all threats and acts of \r\nviolence against humanitarian personnel and United \r\nNations and associated personnel. \r\nA/61/PV.52  \r\n \r\n06-61315 4 \r\n \r\n The EU calls for an immediate end to all \r\nviolence, including sexual and gender-based violence. \r\nEffective measures for prevention, as well as for the \r\nprotection of and support for victims of gender-based \r\nviolence, must be put in place by Member States. That \r\nshould include the development and effective \r\nimplementation of necessary legislation, standards, \r\npolicies and resources at all levels. \r\n Bringing perpetrators to justice is vital. The EU \r\naffirms once again the need to hold accountable those \r\nresponsible for illegal acts and strongly urges all States \r\nto take stronger action to end impunity, including by \r\nensuring that any such acts committed on their territory \r\nbe investigated fully and that those responsible be \r\nbrought to justice without delay. The EU strongly \r\nsupports the International Criminal Court (ICC) and \r\ncalls upon all States that are not yet party to the Rome \r\nStatute of the ICC to ratify or accede to it without \r\ndelay. \r\n The EU finds it encouraging that the number of \r\nrefugees throughout the world continues to decrease, \r\nbut recognizes that refugee situations have become \r\nmore complex and protracted and that the number of \r\ninternally displaced persons has grown. The protection \r\nof and assistance to internally displaced persons should \r\nbe comprehensively strengthened. The EU welcomes \r\nthe new role of the United Nations High Commissioner \r\nfor Refugees as a cluster lead in the clusters of camp \r\ncoordination and camp management, protection and \r\nemergency shelter in conflict-related internal \r\ndisplacement situations, and looks forward to \r\nachieving further clarity in the system-wide response to \r\nthe issue of internally displaced persons. \r\n The humanitarian coordinator/resident \r\ncoordinator system is key to a successfully coordinated \r\nhumanitarian response at the country level. The EU \r\nwelcomes the improvements already made, including \r\nreinforced training programmes and the establishment \r\nof a pool of humanitarian coordinators. The recently \r\nlaunched cluster leadership approach is equally \r\nimportant, as it strengthens coordination by more \r\nsystematically identifying roles and responsibilities \r\nwithin the United Nations system. That facilitates \r\nstrengthened leadership, coordination, strategic \r\nplanning and the identification of needs and response \r\ngaps. The cluster approach should be an inclusive \r\nprocess involving all humanitarian actors in order to \r\nincrease efficiency at the field level. The EU looks \r\nforward to further efforts in that regard, including the \r\nstrengthening of surge capacity. \r\n The EU welcomes efforts to develop and improve \r\nstand-by capacities for humanitarian assistance. In our \r\nview, that could include more permanent arrangements \r\nwith member States and with regional organizations. \r\nLocal capacity is particularly important in sudden-\r\nonset disasters. \r\n Recognizing the benefits of effective engagement \r\nand coordination of relevant humanitarian actors, the \r\nEU continues to support and further encourages strong \r\npartnerships with local actors, non-governmental \r\norganizations and civil society, including the Red Cross \r\nand Red Crescent Movement. \r\n Humanitarian perspectives should be taken into \r\naccount in political, security and peacekeeping \r\noperations, bearing in mind the importance of \r\npreserving humanitarian space in integrated missions. \r\nThe EU believes that the Peacebuilding Commission \r\ncan further contribute to a coordinated response of the \r\nUnited Nations to States emerging from conflict. The \r\nfirst country-specific meetings held in October on \r\nSierra Leone and Burundi represented an encouraging \r\nstart.  \r\n The predictability, timeliness and equity of \r\nhumanitarian funding needs to be improved, as some \r\nemergencies remain chronically underfunded or even \r\nneglected. In that regard, the establishment of the \r\nCentral Emergency Response Fund (CERF) constitutes \r\na major improvement. The report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral indicates that CERF has contributed to the \r\ntimeliness of response and towards improved \r\ncoordination, in particular at the country level. It has \r\nalso contributed to a more equitable distribution of aid, \r\naddressing core needs in underfunded emergencies, \r\nparticularly in Africa. The States members of the EU \r\nhave so far contributed over $180 million to CERF, and \r\nadditional pledges have been made.  \r\n The European Union remains committed to the \r\nGood Humanitarian Donorship initiative and \r\nencourages the efforts of all donors to implement the \r\nprinciples rigorously. Effective coordination among \r\ndonors themselves would contribute to a more coherent \r\nresponse and to a decrease in unnecessary and \r\noverlapping actions by donors. \r\n The EU recalls the need for reliable, accurate and \r\ntimely needs assessments and multi-agency lessons-\r\n A/61/PV.52\r\n \r\n5 06-61315 \r\n \r\nlearned processes. Efforts to further improve the \r\nquality and inclusiveness of the consolidated appeals \r\nprocess should continue. \r\n Natural disasters are on the increase and have a \r\ndebilitating impact, particularly on low-income \r\npopulations. We fully agree with the Secretary-General \r\nthat prevention is better than cure. Additional \r\ninvestments are needed for disaster risk reduction to \r\nproceed from merely reacting to disasters with relief \r\nefforts to actually building resilience. Donors and \r\nhazard-affected countries need to invest more in \r\ndisaster mitigation and preparedness measures, \r\nincluding, in particular, national-level and local \r\ncapabilities, which includes the idea of saving not only \r\nlives, but also assets and livelihoods. Disaster risk \r\nreduction efforts should be integrated into sustainable \r\ndevelopment and poverty reduction strategies. Close \r\ncooperation of States Members of the United Nations, \r\nin particular the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme (UNDP) and the International Strategy for \r\nDisaster Reduction, as well as the international \r\nfinancial institutions, is crucial in building long-term \r\nresilience and implementing the priorities set out in the \r\nHyogo Framework for Action. \r\n It is a great challenge to find ways to turn the \r\ntragic events of natural disasters and conflicts into an \r\nopportunity for long-term development and settlement. \r\nThe United Nations system needs to give more \r\nattention to bridging the existing gaps in addressing \r\nsituations of transition from relief to development. The \r\nEuropean Union welcomes the designation of UNDP to \r\nlead in the early recovery cluster within the cluster \r\nleadership framework.  \r\n Successful transition can be achieved only if \r\nthere is a strong commitment to ensuring that all \r\nmembers of society are able to play an active role in \r\nthe process. Achieving sustainable development will \r\nnot be possible without the full involvement of women. \r\nThe EU wishes to underline that gender and age should \r\nbe included in strategies for emergency response and \r\nreconstruction programmes as cross-cutting issues \r\nfrom the earliest stages.  \r\n Finally, the EU wishes to pay tribute to Mr. Jan \r\nEgeland for his untiring efforts in recent years in the \r\nhumanitarian area. We would like to take this \r\nopportunity to reaffirm our strong support for him and \r\nhis team at the United Nations Office for the \r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs in their \r\nimportant work. The European Union remains \r\ncommitted to contributing towards a more coordinated \r\nand effective humanitarian response. \r\n Ms. Rouse (Grenada): I have the honour to \r\nspeak, on behalf of the States members of the \r\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM) that are Members \r\nof the United Nations, on agenda item 69, \r\n“Strengthening of the coordination of humanitarian and \r\ndisaster relief assistance of the United Nations, \r\nincluding special economic assistance”, and its sub-\r\nitem (a), “Strengthening of the coordination of \r\nemergency humanitarian assistance of the United \r\nNations”. \r\n We welcome the Secretary-General’s reports on \r\nthose agenda items and wish to take this opportunity to \r\ncongratulate the Emergency Relief Coordinator and his \r\nstaff for their hard work and dedication in facing the \r\nchallenges presented during this past year. \r\n Reports of an upward trend in disasters, with \r\nvastly devastating effects, and the probability that this \r\ntrend will continue as vulnerabilities increase are \r\ndisconcerting. Even more worrisome in that context to \r\nthe CARICOM member States is the reported growing \r\nfrequency and severity of hydro-meteorological \r\nhazards. \r\n Addressing the complexities of disasters and \r\nending the cycles of vulnerabilities necessitate an \r\nintegrated approach to disaster management that would \r\ninclude, as indicated in the Secretary-General’s report \r\ncontained in document A/61/85, disaster planning and \r\npreparedness, sustained assistance for post-disaster \r\nrecovery and reconstruction, and the prioritization of \r\nrisk reduction as a matter of urgency. \r\n Towards that end, the World Summit Outcome set \r\nforth three broad areas to improve the United Nations \r\nhumanitarian system. Without prejudice to the \r\nimportance of progress at an even pace in all three \r\nareas, CARICOM has particular interest in the \r\nimprovement of facilities for rapid access to funds in \r\nthe initial phases of a humanitarian emergency and for \r\nensuring equitable response to neglected emergencies \r\nor otherwise chronically underfunded emergencies. \r\n As small island developing States with particular \r\nvulnerabilities to hurricanes, floods and earthquakes, \r\nour development itself is dependent upon the frequency \r\nand magnitude of such weather events. Yet \r\ninternational response to disasters that struck Grenada, \r\nA/61/PV.52  \r\n \r\n06-61315 6 \r\n \r\nGuyana, Haiti and Jamaica, to name a few, in the more \r\nrecent past has been inadequate. It was therefore in that \r\ncontext that we welcomed the launching of the Central \r\nEmergency Response Fund (CERF) on 9 March as a \r\nmeans to ensure a more predictable and timely \r\nresponse to humanitarian emergencies and recognized \r\nthe innovative grant element in the improved Fund. \r\n CARICOM is pleased with the application of the \r\nFund during the first six months since its launching. \r\nWe note in particular the immediate disbursement of \r\nfunds based on appeals for rapid response for situations \r\nin Africa, as well as the allocation of funds in \r\nunderfunded crises. \r\n In order to ensure that CERF remains an effective \r\nfunding tool, its funds must be replenished. In that \r\nregard, CARICOM member States urge the \r\ntransformation of pledges into firm funding \r\ncommitments. \r\n Secondly, it is important to recall the purpose of \r\nCERF as a mechanism of last resort and the \r\ncomplementary role it plays to humanitarian appeals \r\nmechanisms and emergency funds by individual \r\nagencies. In that regard, CARICOM notes that the \r\nFund has been able to complement other humanitarian \r\nfunding arrangements, especially with assistance to the \r\nWorld Food Programme, the Office of the United \r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees, the \r\nInternational Organization for Migration, the Food and \r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations, the \r\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund, the World Health \r\nOrganization, the United Nations Population Fund and \r\nother entities in filling unmet needs and supporting \r\nlife-saving programmes. Consequently, in light of the \r\nrole of the Fund, as stated in the report of the \r\nSecretary-General, donor funding to CERF must be \r\nadditional to donors’ response to emergency funds and \r\nto appeals from agencies. \r\n CARICOM member States take this opportunity \r\nto recall the important function of the Advisory Group, \r\nas established pursuant to resolution 60/124, to provide \r\nadvice to the Secretary-General on the use and impact \r\nof the Central Emergency Response Fund. We \r\ncommend the Advisory Group’s work thus far and note \r\nits report of 12 October 2006 on the use and \r\nmanagement of CERF. CARICOM also endorses the \r\nAdvisory Group’s recommendation that Member States \r\nmake every effort to achieve as soon as possible the \r\n$500-million target established by the General \r\nAssembly and welcomes the advocacy role the Group \r\nintends to undertake for the early attainment of that \r\ntarget. CARICOM further encourages the highest level \r\nof participation, as possible, at the forthcoming donor \r\nconference for the Fund on 7 December. \r\n In 1991, CARICOM member States established a \r\ndisaster management programme to coordinate disaster \r\nresponse and management at the regional level. The \r\nfunctions of the Caribbean Disaster Emergency \r\nResponse Agency (CDERA) include providing \r\ninformation to interested organizations on disasters \r\naffecting the region; disaster mitigation; establishing \r\nand maintaining, on a sustainable basis, adequate \r\ndisaster response capabilities among CARICOM \r\nStates; and mobilizing and coordinating disaster relief. \r\n CARICOM member States appreciate the \r\nongoing support of the international community with \r\nrespect to disaster mitigation. We make particular \r\nmention of the recent donation by the Government of \r\nTurkey that regional initiative in the sum of $400,000 \r\nto CDERA for the support of the wider Comprehensive \r\nDisaster Management (CDM) programme in the region. \r\nThat donation was timely, as it brought flexibility to \r\nsupporting gaps in CDM resources and will be utilized \r\nto support country programming, among other \r\nactivities. \r\n We also welcome the conclusion of a Financing \r\nAgreement for Institutional Support and Capacity \r\nBuilding for Disaster Management in the Caribbean \r\nbetween the European Union and the Caribbean Forum. \r\nThe €3.4 million project is intended to strengthen and \r\nincrease CDERA’S effectiveness and to improve its \r\ncoordination within the region; review and revise \r\nexisting disaster management legislation with a view to \r\nestablishing appropriate legislation where needed; set \r\nup and support national awareness and management \r\ncampaigns in collaboration with government agencies, \r\nnon-governmental organizations and other parties \r\nworking in that area; and increase the use of \r\ninformation and communications technologies for \r\nemergency planning, thereby making the \r\ncomprehensive disaster management programme more \r\neffective and its capacity enhanced for management \r\nand related teaching and research through exchange \r\nstudies and other research in that field. \r\n CARICOM believes that the assistance rendered \r\nby the Financing Agreement will doubtless serve not \r\nonly to strengthen CDERA, and by extension the \r\n A/61/PV.52\r\n \r\n7 06-61315 \r\n \r\nhuman resource capacity of the region, but even more \r\nto underwrite our economic and social development. \r\n CARICOM is well aware that the future success \r\nof the Fund is dependent on the will and support of \r\nMember States in increasing their contributions in \r\norder to meet the three-year target of $500 million \r\nendorsed by the General Assembly. As the theme for \r\nthe sixty-first session — “Implementing a global \r\npartnership for development” — reminds us, we must \r\nall work together and support each other in all areas \r\npossible. \r\n Mr. Nikitov (Ukraine): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the States members of the \r\nOrganization for Democracy and Economic \r\nDevelopment (GUAM), namely, Azerbaijan, Georgia, \r\nMoldova and Ukraine. \r\n At the outset, we would like to thank the \r\nSecretariat for the report submitted under agenda item \r\n69. \r\n The past year was marked by a continuing rise in \r\nthe number of large-scale disasters and affected \r\npopulations. Recent humanitarian crises have \r\ndemonstrated the overall capability of the humanitarian \r\ncommunity to launch a massive response when called \r\nupon. However, it is quite obvious that the quality of \r\nsuch a response still needs further improvement. \r\nHumanitarian response does not always meet the basic \r\nneeds of affected populations in a timely way; it varies \r\nconsiderably from crisis to crisis, and current capacity \r\nlevels are not always sufficient to meet the demands of \r\nmajor emergencies occurring at the same time. While \r\nsome of the factors affecting response are specific to \r\nindividual crises, some of the key challenges seem to \r\nbe systematic in nature. \r\n The GUAM States believe that the further \r\nstrengthening of the current international humanitarian \r\nresponse system and improving the coordination of \r\nhumanitarian assistance, sustained and unhindered \r\nhumanitarian access, as well as flexible and predictable \r\nemergency funding, are key issues. \r\n At the national level, institutional capacity-\r\nbuilding and support for national efforts in \r\nstrengthening humanitarian response capacities, \r\nincluding through sharing best practices and expertise \r\nand establishing national contingency plans, are critical \r\nfor proper disaster preparedness and response. \r\n Better coordination by the United Nations of \r\ninternational efforts on the ground is needed in order to \r\navoid unnecessary duplication and to increase the \r\nefficiency of the Organization. The humanitarian skills \r\nand capabilities of both humanitarian and resident \r\ncoordinators in countries at risk of natural disasters and \r\nhumanitarian emergencies should be further developed \r\nand upgraded. \r\n Humanitarian assistance and funding should not \r\nbe limited to providing immediate response to crises, \r\nbut must take into account long-term needs in the \r\ntransition phase. The capacity gaps of the United \r\nNations coordination mechanisms in the transition \r\nspace have to be adequately addressed to ensure \r\nefficient response to transition needs. \r\n We therefore welcome the continued efforts of \r\nthe United Nations humanitarian system to further \r\nimprove and strengthen the coordination of \r\nhumanitarian response. We believe that the cluster \r\nleadership approach is a step forward towards \r\nimproving predictability, accountability and the \r\neffectiveness of humanitarian response. The timely and \r\npredictable funding of cluster-related activities at both \r\nthe global and country levels is critical to the \r\neffectiveness of that approach. \r\n Looking back at the developments of the past \r\nyear, one should recognize the persistence of serious \r\nhumanitarian challenges. Restricted humanitarian \r\naccess, non-compliance with international \r\nhumanitarian law and humanitarian principles, and \r\ncontinued attacks on humanitarian workers can be \r\nmentioned once again in that regard, but it is more \r\ndisturbing that such humanitarian concerns as the \r\nspread of HIV/AIDS, sexual exploitation and the abuse \r\nof civilians in humanitarian crises have loomed large. \r\n The GUAM States are concerned by the alarming \r\nspread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in humanitarian \r\ncrises, which further amplifies the suffering of civilian \r\npopulations. It is particularly discouraging that, \r\ncoupled with famine and natural disasters, HIV/AIDS \r\nis driving ever-larger sectors of nations towards \r\ndestitution. Efforts to address the problem could be \r\nmore successful if reinforced by concrete action on the \r\npart of Member States, particularly through the \r\ndevelopment of national strategies that address the \r\nspread of HIV among humanitarian workers and \r\ninternational peacekeepers. \r\nA/61/PV.52  \r\n \r\n06-61315 8 \r\n \r\n Speaking on the transition from relief to \r\ndevelopment, we cannot but refer to the consequences \r\nof the Chernobyl disaster. Now, 20 years after the \r\ntragic accident, the impact of that catastrophe on the \r\nlives of millions of affected people continues to pose \r\nan enormous challenge in the region. \r\n We attach special significance to the role of the \r\nUnited Nations in strengthening the international \r\nresponse to the consequences of the Chernobyl \r\ncatastrophe. We thank the delegations that took part in \r\na special plenary meeting in spring this year in the \r\nframework of the sixtieth session of the General \r\nAssembly to honour the victims of the Chernobyl \r\ndisaster and to raise public awareness about the long-\r\nterm consequences of the Chernobyl catastrophe. We \r\nappreciate the contribution made by all Member States \r\nand organizations of the United Nations system, as \r\nwell as representatives of civil society, the private \r\nsector and the donor community to the development of \r\ncooperation to mitigate and minimize the consequences \r\nof the Chernobyl disaster. \r\n Mr. Al-Shamsi (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in \r\nArabic): It gives me pleasure to extend to you, Madam, \r\nand to the members of the Bureau, sincere gratitude \r\nand appreciation for your efforts in guiding our work at \r\nthis meeting. I would also like to express our \r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for his important \r\nreports under this agenda item.  \r\n The loss of life and the destruction caused by \r\nnatural disasters and conflicts during the past few \r\nyears, in both developing and developed countries, and \r\nthe universally sympathetic response and provision of \r\nassistance to those countries, confirm, beyond any \r\ndoubt, the need for effective international solidarity \r\nand cooperation in confronting the aftermath of \r\ndisasters and containing their destructive effects, as \r\nwell as in alleviating the suffering of the affected \r\npersons and assisting them in resuming their normal \r\nlives as soon as possible. In this context, the United \r\nArab Emirates emphasizes the central role of the \r\nUnited Nations in the strengthening of the coordination \r\nof long-term humanitarian and disaster relief \r\nassistance. We greatly value the efforts made by the \r\nOrganization and all those working in the field of \r\nhumanitarian assistance and relief.  \r\n In this regard, we would like to reaffirm the \r\nimportance of implementing the recommendations of \r\ninternational conferences on the coordination of \r\ninternational efforts to elaborate an international \r\nstrategy to deal with natural disasters at every stage, \r\nfrom early warning to relief assistance, rebuilding and \r\ndevelopment, as well as to adopt appropriate measures \r\nto assist poor countries in building their national \r\ncapacities to deal with natural disasters and the \r\nconsequences of war. \r\n The United Arab Emirates is one of the largest \r\ncontributors in the field of humanitarian and relief \r\nassistance in emergencies, as well as in terms of long-\r\nterm assistance in all areas of the world. It provides \r\nassistance through donations, in cash and in kind, most \r\nof which goes to the affected countries through direct \r\nbilateral arrangements between them and the United \r\nArab Emirates. The United Arab Emirates also fulfils \r\nits financial commitments to the United Nations bodies \r\nconcerned with humanitarian and relief assistance and \r\ndevelopment activities, such as the United Nations \r\nRelief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the \r\nNear East, the Office of the High Commissioner for \r\nRefugees, the International Committee of the Red \r\nCross and other development bodies of the \r\nOrganization. The United Arab Emirates has pledged to \r\ngive $1.038 million to those bodies in 2007.  \r\n In May 2006, in order to support the coordination \r\nof international efforts in this field, the United Arab \r\nEmirates joined the donor partnership group and the \r\ndonor support group within the Office for the \r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs, whose \r\nmembership comprises the most active donor countries \r\nin the humanitarian field. \r\n In support of international efforts to respond to \r\nnatural disasters, the United Arab Emirates established \r\nDubai Humanitarian City to provide facilities and \r\nintegrated services to national and international \r\nhumanitarian organizations. It has always attached \r\ngreat importance to enhancing the capabilities of \r\naffected countries to respond effectively to disasters \r\nand to supporting their efforts, including research, \r\naimed at enhancing their ability to predict natural \r\ndisasters and contain their consequences, while \r\nstrengthening the infrastructure of those countries.  \r\n To reduce the harmful effects of climate change \r\non the environment around the world, the United Arab \r\nEmirates has ratified the Kyoto Protocol to limit global \r\nwarming and greenhouse emissions. We have also \r\nratified the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the \r\nOzone Layer and the Montreal Protocol on Substances \r\n A/61/PV.52\r\n \r\n9 06-61315 \r\n \r\nThat Deplete the Ozone Layer. The United Arab \r\nEmirates has adopted a national strategy to implement \r\nthose instruments. \r\n During the period 2004-2006, the Government of \r\nthe United Arab Emirates, working with the Emirates \r\nRed Crescent Authority, contributed about $775 \r\nmillion to support and enhance international efforts to \r\nassist tsunami victims, as well as the victims of the \r\nearthquake that hit Pakistan and southern India, \r\nHurricane Katrina, which struck the United States of \r\nAmerica, and the earthquake that took place in \r\nIndonesia in May, 2006. Part of those donations were \r\nalso provided for the reconstruction of countries \r\naffected by conflict, including Afghanistan, Iraq, \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina and Lebanon. By September \r\n2006, the Red Crescent Authority of the United Arab \r\nEmirates had spent more than $275 million on \r\nhumanitarian and relief projects in 100 countries \r\nthroughout the world. In September 2006, the United \r\nArab Emirates pledged to resume the Emirates \r\nSolidarity Project for demining in southern Lebanon. \r\n The United Arab Emirates attaches great \r\nimportance to supporting and assisting the Palestinian \r\npeople and Government and to alleviating the suffering \r\nof the people during the humanitarian crisis caused by \r\nthe brutal assault on them by the Israeli occupation \r\nforces. United Arab Emirates donations to the \r\nPalestinians in the period 2000-2005 amounted to $829 \r\nmillion. Those funds are in addition to other \r\nhumanitarian assistance provided through the relevant \r\nUnited Nations agencies to meet their immediate \r\nlivelihood needs and to rebuild the cities destroyed by \r\nthe savage Israeli assault.  \r\n Furthermore, in July 2005 the United Arab \r\nEmirates allocated $100 million to construct the city of \r\nKhalifa bin Zayed on the ruins of the evacuated Israeli \r\nsettlements in Gaza. Relief and services projects in \r\nPalestine carried out by the United Arab Emirates Red \r\nCrescent Authority have exceeded $122 millions \r\ndollars, in addition to other assistance in kind. \r\n The United Arab Emirates is deeply concerned \r\nabout the deteriorating humanitarian conditions of the \r\nPalestinian people in the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritories resulting from the economic, political and \r\nmilitary blockade imposed by the Israeli occupying \r\nforces — a blockade that has denied people access to \r\nhumanitarian and economic assistance. The massacres, \r\nthe collective punishment, the incursions into cities and \r\nvillages, the confiscation of farmland and water \r\nresources, the destruction of property and the \r\nconstruction of the expansionist separation wall, have \r\nall led to the death and disabling of thousands of \r\ncivilians and to the internal displacement of thousands \r\nmore. Huge losses have been inflicted on the economy, \r\nas a result of which more than two thirds of the people \r\nnow live below the poverty line, while half of the \r\nchildren suffer from diseases related to malnutrition. \r\nThis situation is in danger of developing into a serious \r\nhumanitarian disaster. \r\n We call upon the United Nations, especially the \r\nSecurity Council, to fulfil its responsibility for the \r\nprotection of the Palestinian people and to compel \r\nIsrael, the occupying Power, to stop its acts of \r\naggression and its other crimes immediately; to lift its \r\nblockade of the occupied Palestinian territories; and to \r\nhalt the construction of the illegal expansionist wall \r\nand dismantle those parts that have already been \r\nconstructed, in compliance with the international \r\nlegality and the principles of international \r\nhumanitarian law. Further, it should resume the peace \r\nnegotiations on the basis of the relevant international \r\nresolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative adopted at the \r\nBeirut Summit. \r\n Mr. Wali (Nigeria), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n We further emphasize the need for UNRWA to \r\ncontinue to discharge its responsibility to provide \r\nservices to refugees in all of its areas of operation and \r\nthe need to continue financial support for the regular \r\nand urgent activities and programmes of the Agency. \r\nWe further urge donor countries to resume their \r\nassistance to the Palestinian people and Government in \r\norder to alleviate their suffering until an end is put to \r\nthe Israeli occupation of their land and until the \r\nestablishment of an independent State of Palestine, \r\nwith Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital. \r\n Mr. Sen (India): We would like to thank the \r\nSecretary-General for the reports that have been \r\nprepared for the discussions under this agenda item. \r\nWe also thank the Under-Secretary-General, Mr. Jan \r\nEgeland, for the introduction of the reports. We \r\nappreciate the candid approach adopted in the report \r\nthat identifies areas for improvement even as it \r\ndescribes positive developments. \r\n The Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) \r\nwas launched in March this year to address the concern \r\nA/61/PV.52  \r\n \r\n06-61315 10 \r\n \r\nregarding the allocation and availability of resources \r\nfor humanitarian assistance and to enable the United \r\nNations to provide timely humanitarian assistance \r\nevenly across emergencies. India strongly supported \r\nthat initiative out of its conviction that through this \r\nreform measure, the United Nations would be better \r\npositioned to assist developing countries in their hour \r\nof need in the aftermath of a disaster. India \r\ndemonstrated solidarity with the international efforts \r\naimed at addressing the needs of developing countries \r\nfor emergency humanitarian assistance through \r\npledging a contribution of $2 million to CERF at its \r\nlaunch in New York, half of which has already been \r\ndisbursed. \r\n As promised by the Secretary-General, detailed \r\ninformation on the use of CERF has been provided to \r\nMember States. The report indicates that CERF has \r\nmade good progress towards its objectives of \r\npromoting early action and response to reduce loss of \r\nlife and of enhancing United Nations humanitarian \r\nassistance to time-critical needs in the aftermath of \r\ndisasters and in underfunded emergencies.  \r\n We note that the Emergency Relief Coordinator \r\nhas focused on the need for the timely allocation and \r\ndisbursement of CERF funds. We also note with \r\nsatisfaction that despite the fact that its implementation \r\nis at an early stage, CERF has enabled humanitarian \r\nassistance to be made available within 72 hours. We \r\nencourage the Emergency Relief Coordinator to \r\ncontinue efforts to address administrative delays and \r\nstreamline application processes. While appreciating \r\nthe need for completing the requisite paperwork prior \r\nto disbursement of funds, there is a need for balance so \r\nthat developing countries are not burdened by \r\nexcessive paper work at a time when the capacities of \r\ntheir authorities are stretched in coping with the \r\naftermath of a disaster. \r\n We have perused with interest the note on the \r\nmeeting of the CERF Advisory Group held in Geneva \r\nin October 2006. We note that the Advisory Group \r\nmade some substantive recommendations for further \r\nimprovements, such as through the consideration of an \r\numbrella letter of understanding, delegation of \r\nauthority and development of additional standardized \r\ntemplates. The Advisory Group also emphasized the \r\nimportance of a field-driven approach. We would \r\nsuggest that the recommendations of the Advisory \r\nGroup, including those related to the decision to \r\nundertake field visits to implementation sites, be \r\nexamined by the Emergency Relief Coordinator and his \r\nrecommendations brought to the Member States for \r\ntheir consideration. \r\n India is committed to the Guiding Principles for \r\nthe provision of humanitarian assistance contained in \r\nthe annex to resolution 46/182. We believe that \r\nhumanitarian assistance must be provided in \r\naccordance with the principles of humanity, neutrality \r\nand impartiality. We recall that the Guiding Principles \r\nenjoin that sovereignty, territorial integrity and national \r\nunity of States must be fully respected and that \r\nhumanitarian assistance should be provided with the \r\nconsent of the affected country and in principle on the \r\nbasis of an appeal by the affected country. \r\n In that context, we are concerned at the \r\nrecommendations of the report on humanitarian access, \r\nwhich are not in line with the scope of the Guiding \r\nPrinciples of resolution 46/182. We have been \r\nencouraged by the achievements that the United \r\nNations has made through the establishment of CERF. \r\nThose gains can be consolidated and built upon by \r\nretaining the neutrality and non-political character of \r\nhumanitarian assistance. The International Committee \r\nof the Red Cross commentary on the Fourth Geneva \r\nConvention describes “humanitarian” as “being \r\nconcerned with the condition of man considered solely \r\nas a human being, regardless of his value as a military, \r\npolitical, professional or other unit” and “not … \r\naffected by any political or military consideration”. \r\n Country ownership is crucial, and this should be \r\ngenuine and not disingenuous. Humanitarian assistance \r\nis aimed at relieving immediate suffering only, and \r\ntherefore ensuring all of this should be relatively \r\neasier. \r\n The report appears to project the Guiding \r\nPrinciples on Internal Displacement as standards for \r\ncountries to follow. The Guiding Principles were \r\ndeveloped on the basis of experience of massive \r\ndisplacement in war and conflict situations. The \r\nSecretary-General’s reports in the past have \r\nacknowledged that adequately assisting internally \r\ndisplaced persons (IDPs) requires knowledge and \r\nunderstanding of the specific context in which the \r\ndisaster occurred. India believes that well-functioning \r\nand stable Governments with strong national and legal \r\ninstitutions can and do take care of their IDPs. They \r\nare also best placed to understand their own national \r\ncontext and legislative requirements. \r\n A/61/PV.52\r\n \r\n11 06-61315 \r\n \r\n The report recommends the strengthening of \r\nlocal, national and regional capacities for preparing for \r\nand responding to humanitarian emergencies. India has \r\nstrengthened its disaster preparedness and response \r\ncapacity over the past several years. The aftermath of \r\nthe tsunami disaster further spurred those efforts. The \r\nDisaster Management Act 2005 envisages a holistic \r\nand comprehensive approach to disaster management \r\nwith a greater focus on prevention, mitigation, \r\npreparedness and capacity-building. The National \r\nDisaster Management Authority (NDMA), chaired by \r\nthe Prime Minister, has been created with a provision \r\nfor similar organizational arrangements at the state and \r\ndistrict levels. Some states have already taken action in \r\nthat regard.  \r\n The NDMA has formed core groups to formulate \r\nstrategy and guidelines to mitigate the effects of \r\ndisasters such as earthquakes, cyclones, floods, and \r\nchemical and industrial disasters. The Disaster Risk \r\nManagement Project is being implemented jointly with \r\nthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) \r\nin 169 districts with high vulnerability to natural \r\ndisasters and includes the important elements of \r\ncommunity preparedness and community capacity-\r\nbuilding. The process of the creation of disaster-\r\nresponse teams for providing a specialized response \r\nhas started, and equipment and training needs are being \r\nconsidered. \r\n The political economy of humanitarian assistance \r\nis, of course, broader, touching on ethical issues such \r\nas the principle of negative action, which states that \r\nnot doing enough and letting death and disaster happen \r\nis as bad as actually inflicting death and disaster, and \r\neconomic development, because it is the poor that \r\noften bear the brunt of natural disasters, science and \r\ntechnology.  \r\n In India, satellite-based early-warning systems \r\nhave greatly mitigated, if not eliminated, the \r\nconsequences of cyclones, and we hope they will do \r\nthe same in connection with any future tsunamis. We \r\nhave always been prepared to share that technology \r\nwith developing countries. \r\n We note that, as desired by Member States, the \r\nreport recommends other areas for improving the \r\ndelivery of United Nations humanitarian assistance, \r\nincluding through the improvement of United Nations \r\ncoordination activities at the field level. The report \r\ncites the cluster leadership approach as an effort in that \r\ndirection and recommends that at the country level, \r\ncluster lead agencies should collaborate closely with \r\nGovernment partners. We believe that there is a need \r\nfor further information on and an understanding of this \r\napproach, especially from the perspective of the \r\nreceiving countries where this approach has been \r\nimplemented so far. \r\n In keeping with the basic principles that guide the \r\nwork of the United Nations at the country level, we \r\nrecommend that this approach be implemented at the \r\ncountry level with the consent and under the leadership \r\nof the national Government of the affected State. An \r\nevaluation of the effectiveness of the cluster approach \r\nin enhancing coordination among United Nations \r\nagencies, taking into account the financial costs \r\nincurred in implementing the approach and \r\nincorporating the inputs of the affected States, should \r\nbe presented to Member States. We agree with the \r\nSecretary-General that the cluster approach can be \r\nconsidered only as a first step and not as a solution.  \r\n We are happy that the report has devoted \r\nconsiderable attention to the issue of chronically \r\nunderfunded emergencies. We note that the report \r\nrecommends the development of indicators for \r\nhumanitarian assistance. We recommend that the issue \r\nbe discussed carefully at the intergovernmental level, \r\nin the first instance. \r\n Mr. Shinyo (Japan): First of all, Japan welcomes \r\nthe ongoing efforts to achieve reform in the \r\nhumanitarian sector, which will make for more \r\neffective provision of humanitarian assistance and \r\nprotection of those in need. We commend Under-\r\nSecretary-General Egeland and the Office for the \r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) for the \r\nwork they have done, together with other humanitarian \r\npartners, to improve the predictability and \r\neffectiveness of humanitarian activities. Japan, together \r\nwith the rest of the international community, will \r\ncontinue to do its utmost to promote humanitarian \r\nreform. \r\n We welcome the establishment of the Central \r\nEmergency Response Fund and also the positive and \r\nconcrete results of its efforts to realize the objectives \r\ndescribed in the resolution of the General Assembly \r\nlast year. Enlargement of the donor base is another \r\npositive outcome since the establishment of the Fund. \r\nFor example, the Government of Hyogo prefecture in \r\nJapan has committed itself to contributing 100 million \r\nA/61/PV.52  \r\n \r\n06-61315 12 \r\n \r\nyen to the Fund. Outreach to local governments and \r\ncivil society leads to enhancement of capacity to deal \r\nwith humanitarian issues. The Government of Japan, \r\ntherefore, will continue to support such efforts. \r\n It is essential to properly review the Central \r\nEmergency Response Fund in order to help it to \r\nrespond to humanitarian crises more effectively. We \r\nneed to do so in a more comprehensive and systematic \r\nmanner, including by examining the challenges and \r\nproblems the Fund faces. For example, what \r\ncontribution does the Fund make towards reinforcing \r\nthe existing process of providing humanitarian \r\nassistance, involving, as it does, instruments such as \r\nthe Consolidated Appeal Process and flash appeals? We \r\nalso need to clarify the criteria for resource allocation, \r\nespecially in an underfunded emergency window.  \r\n One of the challenges the Fund faces, as clearly \r\ndescribed in the report of the Secretary-General, is the \r\nimprovement of the speed with which it makes \r\ndisbursements, so that the Fund can become an \r\neffective mechanism for providing assistance in \r\nemergencies. Japan wishes to join in any constructive \r\nefforts to achieve that goal. \r\n We would like to express our support for the \r\ncluster approach, one of the pillars of humanitarian \r\nreform. It is a useful method for strengthening response \r\ncapacity, increasing the effectiveness of multilateral \r\nhumanitarian assistance and improving coordination. \r\nAlthough there is much to be done, we are glad to hear \r\nfrom many in the field that the approach has worked, in \r\nthe follow-up to the earthquake in Pakistan and in other \r\nhumanitarian crises.  \r\n The cluster approach is also useful in addressing \r\nthe issue of internally displaced persons, as long as \r\nthere is no international organization with a clear \r\nmandate to deal with this problem. Here again, we \r\nwould appreciate a comprehensive assessment of the \r\neffectiveness and challenges of the cluster approach to \r\nbe followed. We need consultation and information \r\nexchange on the ground between all relevant \r\nhumanitarian actors, on the one hand, and strong \r\nleadership to implement this approach effectively, on \r\nthe other. This is also a reason why Japan supports \r\nOCHA’s ongoing efforts to strengthen the role and \r\nfunction of humanitarian coordinators. We believe that \r\ndecentralization of authority, to be achieved by giving \r\nhumanitarian coordinators stronger mandates, should \r\nbe explored in this context. \r\n Disaster reduction is an essential pillar of \r\nsustainable development and is, therefore, one of the \r\nissues that is vitally important for the United Nations \r\nto address. Even in the short time that has passed since \r\nthe World Conference on Disaster Reduction was held \r\nin Kobe in January 2005, massive disasters have struck \r\nin many places, including Pakistan, the Philippines and \r\nJava in Indonesia, demonstrating the urgent need to \r\nimplement the Hyogo Framework for Action.  \r\n The new facility launched by the World Bank on \r\ndisaster reduction will certainly facilitate \r\nimplementation of the Hyogo Framework, and we \r\ntherefore welcome it. We strongly believe that the \r\nHyogo Framework will be even more fully \r\nimplemented once components of International \r\nStrategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR) become \r\nstronger. We support the clear recommendation in the \r\nrecent report of the Secretary-General’s High-Level \r\nPanel, entitled “Delivering as One”, that the United \r\nNations’ efforts on risk reduction need to be urgently \r\nenhanced, through full implementation and funding of \r\ninternational agreements and other recent initiatives \r\nand the involvement of communities.  \r\n As a nation with extensive knowledge and \r\ntechnology relating to disaster reduction, Japan wishes \r\nto be actively involved in achieving a strengthened \r\nISDR, and we intend to make contributions to the \r\ndeliberations of its Programme Advisory Committee. \r\nJapan will share the experience, expertise and \r\nknowledge it has accumulated in Kobe, where there are \r\nmany organizations specializing in disaster-related \r\nactivities and working with countries in Asia and \r\nbeyond. \r\n We commend humanitarian personnel for \r\ncarrying out their difficult responsibilities under often \r\nsevere crisis conditions. We must do everything we can \r\nto ensure the safety of these individuals. We also wish \r\nto underline the importance of ensuring unhindered \r\naccess to affected people for the purpose of providing \r\nthem with assistance. In order to assist people in need, \r\nJapan, in conjunction with the rest of the international \r\ncommunity, will continue to join actively in efforts to \r\nstrengthen coordination of humanitarian and disaster \r\nrelief assistance. \r\n Mr. Chulkov (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): This year has been very important for the \r\ninternational humanitarian community. The \r\ninternational community has shown its resolve to \r\n A/61/PV.52\r\n \r\n13 06-61315 \r\n \r\nimprove the global mechanism of humanitarian \r\nresponse and bring it to a qualitatively new level of \r\noperation. We are glad that this work, as can be seen \r\nfrom the report of the Secretary-General, yielded the \r\ndesired results. In this context, we wish to point to the \r\nrole of the Secretariat, in particular the United Nations \r\nOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs \r\n(OCHA), headed by its leader, Mr. Egeland.  \r\n Through joint efforts, member countries \r\nsucceeded in reinforcing our disaster response capacity. \r\nWe have reinforced the mechanism of humanitarian \r\ncoordination, first of all, in the field. In our view, the \r\nassignment of the relevant authority to the United \r\nNations resident humanitarian coordinator to \r\ncoordinate the activities of the United Nations \r\nhumanitarian agencies in the field is consistent with the \r\ntask of achieving a more adequate humanitarian \r\nresponse. However, we also believe that the United \r\nNations country teams should maintain close \r\npartnership with host Governments, especially because \r\nGovernments have the responsibility, first and \r\nforemost, to take care of their citizens, including those \r\nin need, and have the primary role in establishing \r\npriorities in humanitarian response strategies.  \r\n The so-called cluster approach is an important \r\nelement of improving the mechanism of response in the \r\nfield. We should apply it carefully, taking into account \r\nlocal specifics and circumstances without automatic \r\nextension to other countries. The Secretariat has to \r\nconsider the fact that its mandate in this area, given to \r\nit by the Member States, is to fill the gaps rather than \r\nclusterization in all areas. \r\n We closely follow the establishment of the United \r\nNations multidimensional integrated peacekeeping \r\noperations with humanitarian components. We support \r\nthe Secretariat in its effort to preserve and defend the \r\nhumanitarian space. \r\n The qualitative improvement of the international \r\nhumanitarian response resulted also in the creation of \r\nthe Central Emergency Response Fund. We share the \r\npositive assessment by the Secretary-General of the \r\nfirst months of its work. We are satisfied by the way \r\nthe reporting on fund expenditures is organized, which \r\nensures transparency in its operation. We are looking \r\nforward to an independent biennial report on its work. \r\n We have taken note of the Fund Advisory Group’s \r\nrecommendations on potential Fund allocations to \r\nsupport disaster reduction activities. We are not \r\nconvinced that this approach is right, especially taking \r\ninto account the existence and operation of a separate \r\nUnited Nations Trust Fund for Disaster Relief \r\nAssistance. \r\n The international humanitarian response \r\nmechanism cannot be regarded as static even after such \r\nlarge-scale improvements. Statistical data show an \r\nincrease in the frequency and gravity of large-scale \r\nnatural and man-made disasters in the world with ever-\r\ngreater consequences. This means that we should \r\ncontinue our efforts to maintain this mechanism at the \r\nappropriate level. \r\n We continue to assign the key role in these efforts \r\nto the United Nations and its Office for the \r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). We \r\nbelieve that OCHA should continue to pay priority \r\nattention to the fundamental principles of the provision \r\nof humanitarian assistance — humanity, neutrality and \r\nimpartiality, as well as the independence of \r\nhumanitarian agencies. Moreover, none of these \r\nprinciples should prevail over others. On the contrary, \r\nonly the comprehensive and consistent implementation \r\nof these principles in humanitarian activities can bring \r\nabout, in our view, the best possible results in \r\nproviding assistance to those in need. \r\n At present, it is increasingly evident that we need \r\nto be able to forecast disaster emergencies and prepare \r\nin advance. We support the measures to strengthen the \r\nmechanisms of planning and preparedness for \r\nemergencies triggered by disasters. It is necessary to \r\nbuild up the national systems of early warning, damage \r\nassessment and disaster mitigation, as well as increase \r\ninternational cooperation in this field. We assign the \r\nkey role in this area to the International Strategy for \r\nDisaster Reduction. We believe it is necessary to \r\nintensify international cooperation so as to achieve the \r\nobjectives of the Strategy and the final documents of \r\nthe World Conference on Disaster Reduction in Kobe. \r\n In conclusion, to pursue a point that my colleague \r\nfrom Ukraine was making, this year is a significant one \r\nfor the peoples of Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. Last \r\nApril we marked the twentieth anniversary of the tragic \r\naccident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, which \r\nwas the largest man-made catastrophe in terms of its \r\nscope, complexity and consequences. On 28 April \r\n2006, the United Nations General Assembly held a \r\nSpecial Commemorative Meeting in observance of this \r\ntragic date. This significant event in the history of the \r\nA/61/PV.52  \r\n \r\n06-61315 14 \r\n \r\nUnited Nations marked a new stage in the development \r\nof international cooperation on Chernobyl, in the \r\nstrengthening of which the United Nations should \r\ncontinue to play a particularly catalytic and \r\ncoordinating role. We express our deep gratitude to all \r\nMember States for their solidarity; we regard it as a \r\ntoken of successful cooperation in this area for the \r\nfuture. \r\n Mr. Maurer (Switzerland) (spoke in French): \r\nSwitzerland attaches great importance to the \r\nintergovernmental discussions and negotiations on the \r\nstrengthening of the coordination of United Nations \r\nhumanitarian aid in the framework of the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n For several years now Switzerland has advocated \r\ngreater complementarity between this work and that of \r\nthe humanitarian segment of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil substantive session. At this stage, we believe \r\nthat positive results have been achieved, which is \r\nencouraging for the future efforts in this area. We \r\ninvite Member States to pursue, with the support of the \r\nSecretariat, the discussions aimed at reallocating the \r\nhumanitarian issues dealt with by the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Switzerland is pleased with the improvements to \r\nthe emergency response capacity of the United Nations \r\nsystem and with the fact that increased attention is now \r\nbeing paid to international humanitarian coordination. \r\nFor Switzerland, each key component of the \r\ninternational humanitarian system — the United \r\nNations, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent \r\nMovement and non-governmental organizations \r\n(NGOs) — contributes to the common goal of saving \r\nlives and of alleviating suffering when it has not been \r\npossible to prevent it. We call for greater cooperation \r\nbetween humanitarian actors in order to increase \r\neffectiveness.  \r\n At the same time we wish to stress that \r\nhumanitarian action must be based on realistic \r\nassessments of the needs for protection and assistance \r\nof all the persons affected — without any distinction \r\nand in accordance with humanitarian principles — as \r\nwell as on the known capacity of all the national and \r\ninternational actors on the ground. We would like to \r\nreiterate that the primary responsibility for protecting \r\nand assisting internally displaced persons lies with the \r\nGovernments concerned, which can refer to the \r\nGuiding Principles on Internal Displacement. The \r\nrelevance of these principles was reaffirmed by the \r\nheads of State and Government at the 2005 World \r\nSummit. \r\n Switzerland stresses the primacy of civil \r\norganizations in the implementation of humanitarian \r\naid, in particular in zones affected by conflicts. We \r\ninvite Member States to make use of the existing \r\ninstruments governing civil-military cooperation in \r\ncrisis situations. We thank the Norwegian Government \r\nfor taking the initiative, in collaboration with the \r\nUnited Nations Office for the Coordination of \r\nHumanitarian Affairs (OCHA), to call a high-level \r\nmeeting on 27 November 2006 in Oslo, to advocate for \r\nthe effective implementation of the 1994 Guidelines on \r\nthe Use of Military and Civil Defence Assets in \r\nDisaster Relief, which have now been updated. \r\n As the Secretary-General rightly underlines in his \r\nreport, preparedness capacities for natural disasters \r\nmust be strengthened, both at the community level in \r\ncollaboration with all parties concerned and at the \r\nnational, regional and international levels, in \r\naccordance with the Hyogo Framework for Action. \r\nSwitzerland is pleased with the efforts initiated by the \r\nSecretariat, with the support of partner organizations of \r\nthe Inter-Agency Standing Committee, to strengthen, \r\nfor the long term, the humanitarian coordinator system, \r\nwhich is the cornerstone of increased United Nations \r\neffectiveness and credibility at the field level. \r\n Lastly, with regard to the gender dimension in \r\nemergency situations, we are pleased to note the \r\nforthcoming publication of the Inter-Agency Standing \r\nCommittee gender handbook.  \r\n Mr. Miller (United States of America): There has \r\nbeen much activity and much progress in the realm of \r\nhumanitarian reform this year, in particular through the \r\nrefinement and implementation of the cluster approach, \r\nthe further strengthening of the humanitarian \r\ncoordinator system and the establishment of the \r\nexpanded Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF). \r\n The United States supports the cluster approach, \r\nwhich strengthens United Nations leadership through \r\nthe formal assignment of coordination roles for \r\nhumanitarian activity. That approach has helped to \r\naddress some critical and long-standing gaps in \r\ncoordination. We would like to stress the importance of \r\nbroad participation and inclusiveness in the cluster \r\nsystem. We hope that non-governmental organizations \r\n(NGOs), international organizations, donors and host \r\n A/61/PV.52\r\n \r\n15 06-61315 \r\n \r\nGovernments will all be welcome at the coordination \r\ntable. We hope that ongoing intergovernmental \r\ndiscussion can help clarify the value of the cluster \r\napproach, which can, if implemented thoughtfully, \r\nenhance humanitarian services by instituting both \r\npredictability and accountability. \r\n Protracted civil conflicts continue to create some \r\nof the largest situations of forced displacement in our \r\nera. One of the most significant and long-standing gaps \r\nin humanitarian response concerns the protection of \r\ninternally displaced persons (IDPs). The cluster lead \r\ninitiative aims to address the United Nations role in \r\nthat regard, most significantly by assigning an overall \r\nIDP protection role to the Office of the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The \r\nUnited States supports that new role. \r\n Another important pillar of the reform effort \r\ninvolves the selection and training of humanitarian \r\ncoordinators. This is a critical element for \r\nstrengthening the United Nations humanitarian system, \r\nand it has received insufficient attention. We recognize \r\nthat it is a complicated issue involving a range of \r\nUnited Nations agencies, but we encourage the \r\nEmergency Relief Coordinator to continue to work for \r\nsubstantial improvements in this area.  \r\n The United States also understands the critical \r\nneed for the efficient deployment of humanitarian \r\npersonnel in response to crises, and we therefore agree \r\nin principle with the recommendation to establish more \r\neffective standby arrangements. We look forward to \r\nmore details regarding the proposed method to enhance \r\nstandby capacities. We are willing to share our \r\nexperience in this area with the United Nations system \r\nand with other Member States. \r\n There is no doubt that the expanded CERF is an \r\neffective tool for rapid response to humanitarian \r\nemergencies, and that the Fund provides a valuable \r\navenue for the participation of additional donors. We \r\nare less sure about CERF’s value in addressing \r\nunderfunded emergencies. We need clearer definitions \r\nand the development of criteria to govern \r\ndisbursements in that area. An allocation system based \r\non the percentages of funding received for each United \r\nNations appeal is inadequate. Not all appeals fully \r\nreflect the range of humanitarian activity, and some are \r\nnot limited to emergency response. While it may be \r\ninteresting to make a comparison of needs across \r\nhumanitarian crises, we must not neglect the range of \r\ncomplex issues that impact vulnerability. \r\n The United States is also concerned about \r\ndiscussions that cite a need for greater equity of \r\nresources as a goal of humanitarian assistance. That \r\ncontradicts the fundamental premise that humanitarian \r\naction is based on need. We support the strengthening \r\nand standardizing of methodologies to assess \r\nhumanitarian needs, but we caution against attempting \r\nto compare needs and vulnerability across crises. It is \r\nwidely accepted in the humanitarian community that it \r\nis not appropriate to establish universal standards of \r\nvulnerability. It is also important to clarify that \r\nstandards of delivery, such as those established by the \r\nSphere Project, are not necessarily linked to resource \r\nallocation. The cost of aid in one context cannot be \r\ncompared to another without a complete analysis of a \r\nwide range of factors. \r\n The capacity of the United Nations and other \r\nhumanitarian actors on the ground to conduct sound \r\nanalysis and to effectively deliver humanitarian \r\nassistance is critical to success. However, without full \r\nand unhindered access for humanitarian actors, even \r\nthe most robust response efforts will fail to meet \r\nemergency needs. Deliberate attacks on humanitarian \r\nworkers have become a significant impediment to life-\r\nsaving aid in many crises. We must work to guarantee \r\nthe safety and security of relief workers. \r\n In conclusion, I want to reaffirm the strong \r\nsupport of the United States for the core humanitarian \r\nprinciples of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and \r\nindependence. These provide a foundation for \r\ninternational humanitarian work, and must continue to \r\nguide our efforts, especially as we strive to address the \r\nrange of challenges we face today. \r\n Mr. Campbell (Australia): The international \r\nhumanitarian community is increasingly confronted \r\nwith complex and changing crises. In response we must \r\nwork to increase the effectiveness of humanitarian \r\nassistance and to accurately measure its impact. There \r\nis a moral and operational imperative to maximize the \r\nimpact of humanitarian assistance. We should be able \r\nto demonstrate that we are doing so. \r\n Australia supports the central and unique role of \r\nthe United Nations in providing leadership and \r\ncoordination of international humanitarian action. We \r\nwere pleased that the report of the Secretary-General’s \r\nHigh-level Panel on United Nations System-wide \r\nA/61/PV.52  \r\n \r\n06-61315 16 \r\n \r\nCoherence underlined the importance of the role of the \r\nUnited Nations in humanitarian action and gave greater \r\nimpetus to the humanitarian reform agenda. The \r\nhumanitarian reform agenda, led by the Office for the \r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), has an \r\nintegral role to play in improving humanitarian \r\nresponse capacity, coordination and financing. \r\nAustralia supports those efforts and commends the \r\nprogress in improving United Nations coordination and \r\nenhancing the impact of humanitarian assistance. But \r\nthere is still work to be done to continue to improve \r\neffectiveness and to address key challenges associated \r\nwith humanitarian action. I would like to highlight a \r\nfew areas where Australia believes we must continue to \r\nfocus our collective efforts. \r\n The humanitarian coordinator system is a critical \r\npart of the reform agenda. We have joined others in \r\ncalling for the humanitarian coordinator system to be \r\nmade stronger, and we wish to acknowledge the \r\nchanges and improvements that have been made. We \r\nencourage OCHA to continue to develop the system, \r\nincluding through the selection and training of \r\nhumanitarian coordinators and resident coordinators. It \r\nis important that the cadre of people available for \r\ndeployment be further developed and deepened; in \r\ndoing this we encourage active efforts to improve the \r\ngender balance of the pool. \r\n Steps to improve the response capacity of the \r\nUnited Nations system and of individual agencies in \r\nkey sectors are also important. In that regard, we \r\nwelcome the development of the cluster leadership \r\napproach and were pleased to contribute to the global \r\ncluster appeal. While there is still work to be done to \r\ndevelop the cluster approach, we have seen the positive \r\nimpact it can have — for example, in the response to \r\nearthquakes in Pakistan and Yogyakarta. The cluster \r\napproach is also a useful mechanism to address major \r\nshortcomings in response capacity globally. We urge \r\nOCHA and others in the humanitarian community to \r\ncontinue to strengthen the cluster approach. \r\n Financing is also an important pillar of the \r\nhumanitarian reform agenda. The Central Emergency \r\nResponse Fund (CERF) has had a positive impact on \r\nhumanitarian response. Australia provided $A10 \r\nmillion to CERF, and we are pleased with the results \r\ndelivered so far. However, there is still work to be done \r\nto improve procedures and to strengthen comparative-\r\nneeds assessment between underfunded emergencies. \r\nWe encourage OCHA to continue to strengthen CERF \r\nand to broaden its donor base, including by attracting \r\nprivate donors and contributions from a wide range of \r\nMember States. \r\n Australia strongly supports the efforts by OCHA \r\nto build partnerships with, and within, the broader \r\nhumanitarian community. In our view, partnerships are \r\nnow a fourth pillar of the humanitarian reform agenda. \r\nWe believe the forum held in July to bring together all \r\nhumanitarian actors was an important step. The \r\nagreements that arose from it were positive. We look \r\nforward to hearing more about how they are to be taken \r\nforward and about the impact that stronger partnerships \r\nwill have on humanitarian preparedness and response. \r\nWe would add that military and civilian police \r\nrelationships are also important in humanitarian \r\nresponse, and efforts should be made to strengthen \r\ncoordination with those actors. \r\n Violence continues to be deliberately directed \r\nagainst civilian populations and aid workers in \r\nemergency situations. That will not be stopped without \r\nthe full support of the United Nations and its Member \r\nStates. In particular, it is of grave concern to Australia \r\nthat gender-based violence continues to be a real and \r\nsignificant problem during, and in the aftermath of, \r\nhumanitarian emergencies. We call on the United \r\nNations to strengthen its resolve to combat gender-\r\nbased violence. It is vital that we focus the necessary \r\nresources and efforts on preventing and prosecuting \r\ngender-based violence, alongside working to address \r\nthe causes of such violence. We urge all Member States \r\nto ensure that their national laws and judicial and \r\ncommunity mechanisms are adequate to prevent, \r\naddress, promptly investigate and prosecute gender-\r\nbased violence, and to support the victims of such acts. \r\n Before I conclude, I would like to express \r\nAustralia’s appreciation to Under-Secretary-General \r\nJan Egeland for the work he has done over the past \r\nthree years at the helm of OCHA and as Emergency \r\nRelief Coordinator. While Mr. Egeland will no doubt \r\nbe looking forward to new challenges, we believe he \r\ncan reflect with pride on his achievements and on the \r\nimpact he has had on bringing humanitarian assistance \r\nto those in need and on strengthening the system to \r\nrespond. On behalf of the Australian Government, I \r\nwould like to convey my sincere congratulations to \r\nMr. Egeland for his outstanding contribution to the \r\nUnited Nations system and to international \r\ndevelopment. We wish him well for the future. \r\n A/61/PV.52\r\n \r\n17 06-61315 \r\n \r\n Finally, let me reiterate Australia’s strong support \r\nfor the current humanitarian reform agenda. The \r\nreforms are beginning to demonstrate their potential, \r\nand our challenge is to ensure that over the coming \r\nyears that potential is realized. We must ensure that the \r\nmomentum and progress achieved thus far are \r\nsustained, and we must look to other ways that we can \r\ncontinue to improve the impact of humanitarian \r\nassistance. \r\n Mr. Mahjoub (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I would like, on behalf of my delegation, to \r\nexpress my gratitude to the Secretary-General for his \r\nreports (A/61/79 and A/61/463) submitted under \r\nagenda item 69, entitled “Strengthening of the \r\ncoordination of humanitarian and disaster relief \r\nassistance of the United Nations, including special \r\neconomic assistance”, and the reports (A/61/85, \r\nA/61/87 and A/61/314) submitted under sub-item 69 \r\n(a), entitled “Strengthening of the coordination of \r\nemergency humanitarian assistance of the United \r\nNations”.  \r\n As we debate this important item, we cannot fail \r\nto commend all those who work in the humanitarian \r\nfield for their sacrifices in reaching those in need. My \r\ndelegation highly appreciates the efforts made by the \r\nUnited Nations and its specialized agencies and by \r\nother organizations. We express our particular \r\nappreciation to the Office for the Coordination of \r\nHumanitarian Affairs (OCHA). We also wish to express \r\nour gratitude for the contributions and relief assistance \r\nextended to the Sudan during emergencies and crises.  \r\n My delegation would like to share with the \r\nAssembly our country’s experience in the area of \r\nhumanitarian assistance — a pioneering experience \r\nthat could benefit the international system and groups \r\nworking in the humanitarian field and enhance their \r\nability to address such situations in a way that ensures \r\nmaximum efficiency and optimal benefits while \r\nadhering fully to the principles that must govern \r\nhumanitarian efforts. \r\n In addition to its excellent experience over the \r\ndecades with donors of humanitarian assistance, my \r\ncountry continues to honour its international and \r\nregional obligations. The Sudan is host to one of the \r\nlargest groups of refugees in Africa. With \r\nunconditional generosity, our people give all they can \r\nto alleviate the suffering of refugees, sharing our \r\nmeagre resources with them and providing them with \r\nshelter, food and safe haven. My country has also \r\ncontributed to alleviating the effects of earthquakes in \r\nvarious regions of countries near and far. In addition, \r\nwe have contributed to easing the suffering of those \r\naffected by the tsunami in South-East Asia, as an act of \r\nsolidarity with peoples who have the closest of ties to \r\nthe Sudan.  \r\n Humanitarian assistance efforts must take into \r\naccount the need for close and direct cooperation and \r\ncoordination with Governments and national \r\norganizations. They must also take into consideration \r\nthe sovereignty of States, dealing with them in a way \r\nthat maintains the dignity of their peoples. The fact that \r\na country has fallen victim to a humanitarian crisis and \r\nrequires relief and assistance from the international \r\ncommunity in no way means that its cultural \r\nspecificities and national dignity can be infringed \r\nupon. In that regard, my delegation calls for more \r\nefficient coordination among national, regional and \r\ninternational agencies working in the field so that \r\nresponsibilities and tasks can be shared in order to \r\nprovide for better prepared and more timely responses. \r\nMy delegation also calls for full commitment to the \r\nguiding principles for humanitarian activities, which \r\nwere clearly established in General Assembly \r\nresolution 46/182 and reiterated in subsequent \r\nresolutions. There is a need to discuss ways of \r\nstrengthening respect for, and implementation of, those \r\nprinciples. \r\n A review of the Sudan’s experience with \r\nhumanitarian assistance reveals certain facts that the \r\nGeneral Assembly must consider. In many situations, \r\nover 60 per cent of assistance resources have been \r\nallocated for administrative costs. That has robbed \r\nhumanitarian efforts of credibility and placed those in \r\nneed at the bottom of the list of priorities of \r\nhumanitarian efforts. It is therefore natural that we \r\nurgently and seriously consider the best ways to reduce \r\nadministrative costs and rectify the current situation. \r\nAt the same time, national capacity-building and the \r\nparticipation in humanitarian relief efforts of national \r\nvoluntary organizations must be given the necessary \r\nattention and resources to allow them to immediately \r\naddress disasters. They are more familiar with the \r\ncircumstances of the societies affected and are capable \r\nof playing a cost-effective role, saving important \r\nresources that could be directed towards those in need. \r\n The focus of humanitarian operations on direct \r\nfood assistance must be reevaluated, so as to avoid \r\nA/61/PV.52  \r\n \r\n06-61315 18 \r\n \r\ndestructive effects on the economy and on production \r\ncapacities and local food sources. It can encourage \r\nfarmers and producers to turn away from production, \r\nthereby expanding the cycle of poverty and creating \r\nunwise patterns of consumption, deepening crises and \r\nslowing the recovery process. In that connection, my \r\ndelegation would like to cite a study conducted by \r\nconcerned parties in the Sudan, which confirmed that \r\nover the past 10 years 80 per cent of food assistance \r\nhas come from abroad. That pattern has a negative \r\nlong- and medium-term effect on the productive \r\ncapacities of affected countries. We therefore reiterate \r\nthe importance of purchasing foodstuffs on local \r\nmarkets, assisting recovery and making up losses in \r\ngross domestic product resulting from halts in \r\nproduction in areas affected by disasters and crises. \r\n Those who follow humanitarian assistance efforts \r\nin various parts of the world will note that such \r\nundertakings are governed by the wishes of donors \r\nrather than by the real needs of affected populations. \r\nThe situation must be addressed quickly in order to \r\nensure the effectiveness and benefits of humanitarian \r\nassistance.  \r\n Moreover, close coordination, transparency and \r\naccountability require cooperation, in a spirit of \r\npartnership, between donor and recipient countries. It \r\nis indeed necessary that in such a partnership donor \r\ncountries provide recipient countries information about \r\ntheir financial contributions to humanitarian groups \r\nand organizations working in those States, enabling \r\nrecipients to track expenditures and enhancing \r\naccountability vis-à-vis those in need and all parties \r\nconcerned. Humanitarian relief operations and \r\nassistance must take place in an environment of \r\ncomplete transparency, and must not be used as a \r\npretext to implement other agendas in the guise of \r\nhumanitarianism. Otherwise, humanitarian efforts will \r\nbe meaningless and serve to manufacture and deepen \r\ncrises, thereby sapping the overall credibility of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n In conclusion, my delegation would like to take \r\nthis opportunity to reiterate its full readiness to \r\ncooperate unreservedly with the United Nations and all \r\nother parties concerned, with the full transparency and \r\nopenness necessary for successful coordination and \r\ncooperation in the area of humanitarian assistance, \r\nwith a view to providing unconditional assistance to \r\nthose in need in an environment free from hidden \r\nagendas and complexity so as to achieve the goals of \r\nhuman solidarity reflected in the Charter and other \r\nUnited Nations commitments. \r\n Mr. Liu Zhenmin (China) (spoke in Chinese): \r\nThe Chinese delegation would like to express its \r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for the reports he \r\nhas submitted in connection with the agenda item \r\nunder consideration. I wish to make the following \r\nremarks under that item. \r\n Over the past year there have been frequent \r\noccurrences of various kinds of natural disasters and \r\nemergencies all over the world. Over 92,000 precious \r\nlives were lost, nearly 30 million people became \r\nhomeless and over 100 million people lost their \r\nlivelihoods. Furthermore, the infrastructure of affected \r\ncountries was seriously damaged. All of that has \r\ncaused enormous suffering and huge economic losses \r\nto the Governments and the peoples of affected \r\ncountries. The frequent occurrence of natural disasters \r\ncalls for increased humanitarian assistance from the \r\ninternational community and poses a great \r\nhumanitarian relief challenge to the United Nations \r\nsystem. \r\n As required by resolution 60/124, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral launched the Central Emergency Response \r\nFund (CERF) in March this year, with a view to scaling \r\nup resources so that the United Nations system can \r\nmore effectively help affected countries to cope with \r\nvarious natural disasters and begin recovery and \r\nrehabilitation work in a timely manner. Thanks to the \r\njoint efforts of all parties, the Central Emergency \r\nResponse Fund has raised $273 million since its \r\nestablishment, and has provided timely and effective \r\ndisaster relief assistance to victims of major disasters \r\nin response to emergencies in several crisis regions, \r\nthereby registering great progress on the way towards \r\nreaching the goals it has set for itself.  \r\n The Chinese Government has actively \r\nparticipated in and supported reform in the area of the \r\nhumanitarian relief provided by the United Nations \r\nsystem. We have pledged $1 million to the Central \r\nEmergency Response Fund as a concrete effort to help \r\nalleviate the suffering and losses of the Governments \r\nand peoples of disaster-stricken countries. The Chinese \r\ndelegation believes that the establishment of the \r\nCentral Emergency Response Fund is a major \r\nachievement in the reform of United Nations \r\nhumanitarian activities and will enhance the capability \r\nof the United Nations system to respond to the need for \r\n A/61/PV.52\r\n \r\n19 06-61315 \r\n \r\nhumanitarian assistance and to provide necessary start-\r\nup funds for major emergency disaster relief \r\noperations.  \r\n That being said, the Fund’s resources amount to \r\nonly 5 per cent of the total sum that the United Nations \r\nplans to raise through the consolidated appeal \r\nmechanism. Thus, it can in no way replace the \r\ntraditional role played by that mechanism. The Chinese \r\ndelegation calls upon the international community, and \r\ndeveloped countries in particular, to make greater \r\ncontributions to the Central Emergency Response Fund \r\nso that it can reach its target of $500 million at an early \r\ndate. We also hope that United Nations organizations \r\nand agencies involved in humanitarian assistance will \r\ncontinue to use the consolidated appeal mechanism and \r\nto explore various avenues so as to provide further \r\nrelief resources for the economic recovery and \r\nrehabilitation of affected countries. \r\n Given the frequent occurrence of natural disasters \r\nand emergency situations in recent years, an increasing \r\nnumber of organizations and agencies have participated \r\nin humanitarian assistance efforts at the international, \r\nnational and non-governmental level. In addition, the \r\ncoordinating role of the United Nations in the area of \r\nhumanitarian assistance is receiving increasing \r\nattention from all sides. It is therefore necessary to \r\nfurther strengthen the leading role of the United \r\nNations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian \r\nAffairs (OCHA), in order to enable it to play its \r\ncoordinating role more effectively. The mandates and \r\nresponsibilities of various organizations and agencies \r\nshould be clearly defined, and work overlap reduced, \r\nso that recipient Governments can benefit to the \r\nmaximum from international assistance in their post-\r\ndisaster relief, recovery and rehabilitation endeavours.  \r\n At the national level, we welcome the \r\nestablishment and improvement of the humanitarian \r\ncoordinator system within the United Nations. \r\nCoordinators should receive necessary training and \r\nguidance so as to enhance their capacity to provide \r\nrelief and on-the-ground coordination and, under the \r\nleadership of the Governments of affected countries, \r\nprovide more technical support for relief activities. \r\n The Governments of affected countries should \r\nplay a leading role in all aspects of relief activities, as \r\nwell as in planning for recovery and rehabilitation. \r\nStrengthening international and regional cooperation is \r\nan effective means for affected countries to cope with \r\nnatural disasters and to enhance their capacity to \r\nreduce and prevent disasters. In providing \r\nhumanitarian assistance to affected countries, the \r\nUnited Nations and the international community should \r\nalways adhere to the guiding principles of humanity, \r\nneutrality and impartiality, make a full assessment of \r\nthe severity of disasters and disaster relief capacities of \r\naffected countries and provide assistance based on the \r\nactual needs and priorities of those countries.  \r\n Furthermore, when relief assistance begins, \r\nconsideration should be given to the transition to \r\nrecovery and rehabilitation. In the process of project \r\nplanning and implementation as well as in the \r\nallocation and use of resources, the wishes, autonomy \r\nand ownership of affected countries should be fully \r\nrespected, and mutual communication between donors \r\nand affected countries should be strengthened so as to \r\nensure the effectiveness of assistance. \r\n The United Nations enjoys a clear advantage and \r\npossesses rich experience in disaster relief, disaster \r\nprevention and disaster reduction. In the future, it \r\nshould continue to strengthen and develop partnerships \r\nwith other international organizations, financial \r\ninstitutions and non-governmental organizations \r\nengaged in humanitarian relief work. The international \r\ncommunity should give humanitarian assistance greater \r\npriority in terms of resources, mechanisms and \r\ntechnology and use sophisticated scientific and \r\ntechnological means and information to help disaster-\r\nprone countries and regions to establish early-warning \r\nsystems, enhance their supply-stocking and rapid \r\ndeployment capabilities as well as their ability to \r\nprevent and respond to natural disasters. \r\n China is a disaster-prone developing country. \r\nThrough years of study and practice, it has established \r\na fairly comprehensive disaster-prevention and \r\ndisaster-reduction system suitable to our national \r\nconditions. The Chinese Government attaches great \r\nimportance to international cooperation in the \r\nhumanitarian field and, in response to requests by \r\nGovernments of affected countries and appeals by the \r\ninternational community, has actively participated in \r\nmajor international emergency relief operations. To the \r\nextent possible, it has provided some affected countries \r\nwith timely humanitarian assistance, in cash and in \r\nkind, through both bilateral and multilateral channels, \r\nincluding food aid, emergency disaster relief and \r\nassistance in the settlement of refugees and in post-\r\ndisaster reconstruction.  \r\nA/61/PV.52  \r\n \r\n06-61315 20 \r\n \r\n Last year, China successfully hosted the Asian \r\nConference on Disaster Reduction and the China-\r\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations seminar on a \r\ntsunami early warning system. In the aftermath of the \r\npowerful earthquake in South Asia, China provided \r\nrelief assistance to Pakistan. This year, China actively \r\nparticipated in the relief operation after an earthquake \r\nhit Yogyakarta province in Indonesia. Those examples \r\nfully demonstrate the compassion, support and care of \r\nthe Chinese Government for the Governments and the \r\npeoples of affected countries, as well as its firm \r\ncommitment to international humanitarian cooperation. \r\nAs a member of the developing world, the Chinese \r\nGovernment will continue, as always, to support the \r\nefforts of the United Nations and the international \r\ncommunity in the areas of disaster relief, reduction and \r\nprevention. We are willing to exchange and share \r\nexperiences and lessons with other countries and to \r\ncarry out more wide-ranging international cooperation \r\nin the field of disaster management and emergency \r\nrelief and assistance. \r\n Mr. McNee (Canada): Over the course of the past \r\nyear, international humanitarian action has brought \r\nhope and comfort to millions of people worldwide. \r\nUnited Nations agencies and other actors continue to \r\nmake concerted efforts to ensure more effective, \r\ncoordinated and timely humanitarian action in response \r\nto crises. In many respects, we can look back on the \r\npast year as one of important progress and positive \r\nchange. Key elements of the humanitarian reform \r\nagenda are becoming a reality. But we cannot take that \r\nprogress for granted. Our collective humanitarian-\r\nresponse capacity continues to be stretched by ongoing \r\ncrises that affect the lives of millions of people.  \r\n Despite some positive developments, residual \r\nUnited Nations inter-agency rivalries persist, and \r\ncooperation with non-governmental organizations \r\n(NGOs) and other partners is often strained. Conflicts \r\nsuch as those in Darfur, the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo, northern Uganda and Sri Lanka continue to \r\nremind us of the toll that violence takes on civilian \r\npopulations. Earthquakes in Pakistan and Indonesia \r\nserve as potent and deadly reminders that natural \r\ndisasters cannot be prevented, but that we can, and \r\nmust, do better in terms of investing in disaster \r\nmanagement and risk reduction. All Member States \r\nhave an important stake in ensuring that the United \r\nNations is successful in its efforts to strengthen the \r\nglobal humanitarian system. We have a collective \r\nresponsibility to ensure that the positive momentum \r\nseen to date on that agenda is maintained over the long \r\nterm. \r\n In that respect, Canada continues to place \r\nimportance on reinforcing the coordination of \r\nhumanitarian action within the United Nations. Key \r\nissues related to enhancing response, capacity and the \r\nassessment of needs require our attention and \r\ncommitment. I would like to outline a number of \r\nCanada’s priorities in that regard. \r\n First, we applaud United Nations efforts to \r\nintroduce the cluster coordination system as a means of \r\nimproving humanitarian response by promoting \r\nstronger inter-agency cooperation, including \r\ncooperation with other humanitarian organizations. As \r\na collaborative mechanism, it establishes centres of \r\naccountability to ensure that needs are appropriately \r\nidentified and that action is taken to address key gaps \r\nin response capacity. Nevertheless, we have noted a \r\nnumber of key areas where progress has been slow to \r\ncome, specifically in the global protection and early \r\nrecovery clusters. \r\n We recognize that it is still early days in terms of \r\nevaluating the cluster approach. It will take time for \r\nthe respective United Nations entities to build their \r\ncapacity and to support humanitarian coordinators in \r\nthat ensuring that more timely, predictable and \r\neffective humanitarian action is achieved. However, we \r\nexpect cluster coordinators to exercise the leadership \r\nand cooperation required to overcome challenges in \r\noperationalizing the cluster approach. Moreover, it is \r\nvital that the Office for the Coordination of \r\nHumanitarian Affairs (OCHA) work with cluster \r\nleaders to buttress their coordination capacity, to \r\nestablish benchmarks against which States can measure \r\nprogress and to monitor implementation. \r\n Secondly, in order to ensure more effective \r\nhumanitarian response we must strengthen our ability \r\nto assess and monitor humanitarian needs. The Good \r\nHumanitarian Donorship initiative recognizes the \r\nimportance of allocating humanitarian funding in \r\nproportion to needs as a guiding principle. Yet, if we \r\nare to target funds where needs are greatest, it is \r\nessential that we can agree on how to identify those \r\nneeds and how to best address them in a manner that is \r\nconsistent across crises. Improving the evidence base \r\nrequired for decision-making must therefore become a \r\n A/61/PV.52\r\n \r\n21 06-61315 \r\n \r\nhigher priority among United Nations entities and other \r\nhumanitarian partners. \r\n Clearly, such a development would have \r\nimportant implications for key initiatives such as the \r\nCentral Emergency Response Fund. Canada has made a \r\nsignificant contribution to the Fund this year; it is, in \r\nour view, an important means of providing more \r\ntimely, flexible and predictable funding in response to \r\nnatural disasters and complex emergencies. That is at \r\nthe heart of the Good Humanitarian Donorship \r\ninitiative. But for the Fund to achieve its objectives, its \r\nallocations need to be guided by good evidence-based \r\nanalysis, needs assessments and priority-setting by \r\ncountry teams under the leadership of humanitarian \r\ncoordinators. OCHA should also work to establish a \r\nresults framework for the Fund, in order to clearly \r\ndemonstrate its impact on improving the equity and \r\neffectiveness of humanitarian assistance. \r\n Thirdly, I wish to underscore the importance of \r\nstrengthening the role and capacities of resident and \r\nhumanitarian coordinators. High quality and \r\nexperienced humanitarian coordinators and resident \r\ncoordinators who can provide a comprehensive vision \r\nfor the humanitarian presence in the field, while \r\nengaging relevant authorities when necessary, are \r\nessential. Without strong individuals playing these \r\nroles, greater individual agency capacity and access to \r\nresources will prove ineffective. Canada welcomes \r\nefforts by OCHA to broaden the pool of potential \r\nhumanitarian coordinators to include individuals from \r\nother United Nations agencies and non-governmental \r\norganizations, and the strengthening of the capacity of \r\nhumanitarian and resident coordinators through \r\ncontinuous training. \r\n Fourthly, we must continue to have a strong cadre \r\nof able staff prepared to keep the protection of civilians \r\nat the forefront in their discussions with relevant \r\nauthorities, including non-State actors where \r\nappropriate. In complex emergencies, flagrant \r\nviolations of international humanitarian law are all too \r\noften the norm and not the exception. Rampant sexual \r\nand gender-based violence remains a reality in too \r\nmany contexts. \r\n The United Nations protection deployment \r\ncapacity established by OCHA is a welcome and much \r\nneeded common service. Protecting civilians remains \r\nfundamental to effective humanitarian action. The \r\nprotection deployment capacity is helping to increase \r\nagency capacity to monitor, identify and develop more \r\ntimely strategies to address violations of human rights \r\nand humanitarian law and to protect people. However, \r\nthe protection deployment capacity is only meant to \r\naugment regular agency activities for protection and, \r\ntherefore, we expect that relevant United Nations \r\nagencies will accelerate efforts to strengthen their \r\ninternal capacities to address this critical need. \r\n Fifthly, greater emphasis needs to be placed on \r\nhow we can enhance civil-military cooperation, \r\nrecognizing the value and expertise of civilian and \r\nmilitary actors in specific contexts, and respecting that \r\nhumanitarian action should be largely civilian led. In \r\nthe context of a natural disaster response, Canada \r\nbelieves the United Nations must be more proactive in \r\nidentifying gaps in civilian capacities that may best be \r\nfilled by military and civilian defence assets. Through \r\nOCHA, the United Nations must provide Governments \r\nwith better guidance on the standards that those \r\noffering such assets must meet, develop more robust \r\nstandby arrangements to ensure effective and \r\ncoordinated responses, and mitigate duplication with \r\nvarious regional entities developing parallel processes. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n Finally, as we encourage more timely and \r\neffective humanitarian responses in crisis situations, \r\nour Governments must remain acutely aware that the \r\nsafety of those who do this work is increasingly at risk. \r\nDeliberate attacks on United Nations and associated \r\npersonnel persist, with deadly consequences. Between \r\nmid-July and the end of August of this year, 28 aid \r\nworkers were killed while trying to help civilians in \r\nneed. A recent study has highlighted that attacks \r\nagainst aid workers are increasingly politically \r\nmotivated and that national humanitarian staff are more \r\nat risk than ever before. \r\n There must not be impunity for those who target \r\nand attack aid workers. I urge those Member States \r\nwho have yet to sign or ratify the 1994 Convention on \r\nthe Safety and Security of United Nations and \r\nAssociated Personnel to do so. Member States must \r\ninvestigate and prosecute the perpetrators of such acts \r\nwhenever and wherever they occur. \r\n At the same time, humanitarian aid agencies must \r\nimprove their security management, training and \r\nresources, including for national staff. They must better \r\ncollaborate with one another on security related issues \r\nA/61/PV.52  \r\n \r\n06-61315 22 \r\n \r\nand include security in their programmes as a cost of \r\ndoing business. \r\n In conclusion, I wish to reiterate Canada’s \r\ncommitment to efforts aimed at strengthening the \r\nhumanitarian system. Successful humanitarian action is \r\nan important component of the wider United Nations \r\nreform agenda, including proposed reforms to the \r\ninternational peace and security architecture. This also \r\napplies to efforts to enhance the United Nations human \r\nrights capacity and to effectively address the transition \r\nfrom relief to development, through mechanisms such \r\nas the Peacebuilding Commission. In this regard, we \r\nare pleased to see that the report of the High-level \r\nPanel on United Nations System-wide Coherence has \r\nbeen completed and look forward to considering its \r\nrecommendations closely, including those in the \r\nhumanitarian field. \r\n The reality is that we cannot prevent every crisis. \r\nConsequently, when the need arises, we must be \r\nconfident that we can respond effectively and quickly \r\nto populations in need. \r\n In closing, we would like to pay tribute to Jan \r\nEgeland, who has played such a fundamental role in \r\ndriving the humanitarian reform agenda forward. \r\nCanada looks forward to continuing to work closely \r\nwith the Emergency Relief Coordinator, United \r\nNations entities and humanitarian partners and Member \r\nStates to further strengthen the humanitarian system. In \r\ndoing so, it is important that through our collective \r\nefforts we can make real and lasting change to the lives \r\nof people affected by crisis. Our collective and \r\nsustained commitment and leadership is more critical \r\nthan ever. \r\n Prince Mishal Bin Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz Al-\r\nSaud (Saudi Arabia) (spoke in Arabic): I wish at the \r\noutset to thank His Excellency the Secretary-General \r\nfor his report entitled “International cooperation on \r\nhumanitarian assistance in the field of natural disasters, \r\nfrom relief to development” (A/61/314).  \r\n Humanitarian assistance to counter natural and \r\nman-made disasters is a noble and essential activity; it \r\nreflects international solidarity and the unity of \r\nmankind. Strengthening this humanitarian activity and \r\nincreasing its effectiveness are an obligation and a \r\nchallenge to the international community owing to the \r\nvast human and financial losses these catastrophes \r\nentail. In this context, we must benefit from the \r\nexperience of the numerous States that have faced \r\nnatural disasters, as well as from the information that \r\nexists on capacity that is available at the regional and \r\ninternational levels. \r\n The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has consistently \r\ncalled for strengthened understanding and close \r\nrelations among peoples in order to highlight the great \r\nimportance of international human solidarity if we are \r\nto create a world where well-being, stability and \r\nsecurity prevail, free from threats or dangers. Saudi \r\nArabia continues to be a generous country that has \r\nprovided generous assistance out of human solidarity. \r\nIt has also provided effective assistance and emergency \r\naid in various parts of the world and has become the \r\nlargest donor for the benefit of peoples and countries \r\naffected by disasters. It has thereby sent a message of \r\nlove, amity, solidarity, support and cooperation to the \r\nworld.  \r\n The total contribution of the Kingdom of Saudi \r\nArabia in various areas of emergency response from \r\n1975 to 2004 exceeds $4,986,000,000; this does not \r\ninclude our support for the reconstruction effort in \r\nIraq, which is in excess of $1 billion. A further $430 \r\nmillion in assistance was provided to countries and \r\npeoples affected by the earthquakes and the tsunami in \r\nAsia, and the Saudi people gave a further $90 million \r\nin direct contributions. In addition, the Kingdom of \r\nSaudi Arabia has provided $2.5 billion to the brother \r\ncountry of Lebanon.  \r\n Saudi Arabia’s humanitarian assistance has not \r\nbeen limited to bilateral or direct assistance. We have \r\nalso participated in international humanitarian efforts \r\nthrough specialized programmes and agencies. We \r\nhave supported regional and international development \r\ninstitutions by providing capital of more than $24 \r\nbillion. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has also pledged \r\n$1 million to the Central Emergency Response Fund, in \r\naddition to $4 million from the Saudi Development \r\nFund to initiatives to help persons affected by natural \r\ndisasters under the auspices of the International \r\nMonetary Fund. \r\n If we are to respond realistically and seriously to \r\nthe frustration and despair of people suffering from \r\nhunger, poverty, disease, ignorance, underdevelopment \r\nand debt, we must mainstream the concepts of \r\nhumanity, equality, justice and sustainable \r\ndevelopment in all areas — health, education, the \r\neconomy and society — with a view to achieving \r\n A/61/PV.52\r\n \r\n23 06-61315 \r\n \r\nstability and enhancing international peace and \r\nsecurity.  \r\n Thus, there is a need to establish a partnership \r\nbased on genuine solidarity, to forge development acts \r\nbetween North and South, and urgently to increase \r\nofficial development assistance. We must also address \r\nthe problem of the debt of poor and middle-income \r\ncountries by increasing foreign direct investment and \r\ntechnology transfer to the largest possible number of \r\ndeveloping countries and working seriously to \r\nliberalize international trade. \r\n The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has joined in \r\ninternational efforts aimed at ending poverty and \r\nhunger, by providing economic and financial assistance \r\nthrough its various national funds, through \r\ninternational and regional institutions, as well as \r\nthrough bilateral agreements with developing \r\ncountries. Here, the Kingdom is guided by its deep \r\nbelief in peaceful coexistence, human solidarity and \r\nconstructive cooperation for the good of humanity as a \r\nwhole.  \r\n The total amount provided by the Kingdom of \r\nSaudi Arabia during this period, through bilateral and \r\nmultilateral channels, in grants and development \r\nassistance under favourable terms exceeds $83.7 \r\nbillion, which represents 4 per cent of our annual gross \r\ndomestic product, the largest such percentage in the \r\nworld. Eighty-seven developing countries on several \r\ncontinent have benefited from this assistance. This \r\nassistance is aimed at supporting the long-term \r\neconomic and social development of these countries \r\nand helping them develop their infrastructure and the \r\nvital sectors of health, education, water and \r\nagriculture, for example by helping them dig wells and \r\nbuild dams. With regard to alleviating the debt burden \r\nof a number of countries, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia \r\nhas cancelled more than $6 billion owed by the \r\nneediest among developing countries.  \r\n We know that oil is an important strategic and \r\neconomic commodity for developing countries and for \r\nconsumer countries alike. The Kingdom of Saudi \r\nArabia therefore acts prudently and impartially to \r\nprotect the interests of producer countries without \r\noverlooking the interests of the broader international \r\ncommunity. It acts tirelessly to ensure the stability of \r\noil prices in order to safeguard lasting economic \r\ngrowth worldwide.  \r\n In order to strengthen cooperation in this field, \r\nthe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, on instructions from the \r\nCustodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Abdullah \r\nBin Abdelaziz Al Saud, has founded the International \r\nEnergy Forum, whose secretariat is hosted in Riyadh. \r\nThe Forum is intended to discuss various energy topics \r\nand opportunities for cooperation and dialogue \r\nbetween consumer and producer countries and \r\nstrengthen such cooperation to ensure the stability of \r\noil markets and world economic growth for the well-\r\nbeing of all. \r\n Optimal use of the world’s enormous economic \r\nresources could bridge the huge gap between rich and \r\npoor countries, put an end to hunger and disease and \r\nsupport development in all its aspects. Similarly, \r\nfinding just solutions to the various problems that \r\nweigh on international peace and security can \r\nstrengthen the security and peace to which the peoples \r\nand notions of the world aspire. \r\n Mr. Cherginets (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): \r\nHumanitarian operations have always been an \r\nimportant element of the activities of the United \r\nNations, and the Organization is closely identified with \r\nthem in countries and regions in need of international \r\nassistance. In recent decades, these operations have \r\nbeen at the forefront of efforts to help victims of \r\nhumanitarian disasters. \r\n Unfortunately, such crises are caused not only by \r\nnatural disasters, as was in the case in South Asia \r\nfollowing the tsunami or the earthquake in Pakistan; \r\nmore frequently, the international community is also \r\ncalled upon to respond to acute humanitarian needs of \r\npeople in countries suffering from armed conflict. \r\nRecent years have proven to be a serious test of the \r\ncapacity of the United Nations to organize and \r\ncoordinate international humanitarian assistance for \r\nneedy countries and regions. \r\n How does the Organization deal with this task? \r\nWe feel that it is still too early to give it high marks \r\nhere. The Secretariat and the specialized agencies take \r\ntoo much time in assessing country needs and in \r\nbureaucratic formalities that obstruct the tasks of \r\nhumanitarian organizations. As a result, some States \r\nprefer to provide humanitarian assistance on a bilateral \r\nbasis, without involving the United Nations machinery. \r\n In this connection, we welcome and support the \r\nefforts of Mr. Jan Egeland, Under-Secretary-General \r\nfor Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief \r\nA/61/PV.52  \r\n \r\n06-61315 24 \r\n \r\nCoordinator, to strengthen United Nations coordination \r\nmechanisms and the Organization’s capacity to respond \r\nto humanitarian crises as they arise. \r\n In December 2005, the Republic of Belarus was \r\none of the sponsors of General Assembly resolution \r\n60/124, establishing the Central Emergency Response \r\nFund. We hope that, through the joint efforts of \r\nMember States, we will be able in the near future to \r\nattain the planned amount of $500 million for the \r\nFund. This is an important undertaking that will enable \r\nthe Organization to respond to the needs of people \r\nsuffering from conflict and natural disasters. \r\n There is an important trend on the part of United \r\nNations specialized agencies and funds to work out a \r\nstrategy for humanitarian activities. As a member of \r\nthe Executive Board of UNICEF, Belarus supported a \r\nproposal in September 2006 for a three-fold increase in \r\nUNICEF’s emergency programme, from $25 million to \r\n$75 million. We noted with concern UNICEF Board \r\ninformation that, in July, during the military action in \r\nsouthern Lebanon, the Central Emergency Response \r\nFund was the sole source of funding for UNICEF’s \r\nresponse and humanitarian assistance to Lebanese \r\nchildren. Our delegation supports the leadership of \r\nUNICEF, the United Nations Population Fund and \r\nother organizations in their desire to strengthen their \r\npotential to participate in humanitarian operations. \r\n The Republic of Belarus seeks to be an active \r\nparticipant in international humanitarian operations, \r\nregardless of all the difficulties of its transitional \r\nperiod, which includes a large financial expenditure to \r\nclean up the man-made catastrophe of the Chernobyl \r\nnuclear power plant. Belarus was one of the first to \r\nrespond to the misfortunes in the Indian Ocean area in \r\n2004 and granted assistance, free of charge, to the \r\naffected States. Nor did we remain a bystander in the \r\nrecent conflict in the Middle East; in the very heat of \r\nthe war, Belarus took in children from affected States \r\nand provided heavy aircraft to carry significant \r\nassistance cargo. \r\n We intend to develop our cooperation with the \r\nUnited Nations in the mitigation of man-made \r\ndisasters. Currently, a bilateral draft agreement is being \r\ndrawn up between Belarus and the United Nations on \r\nmeasures to speed up the entry and exit of transit cargo \r\nfor emergency assistance, as well as staff needed for \r\nemergency procedures. This agreement will help \r\nsimplify the movement of humanitarian cargo in \r\nBelarus and across the territory. We also feel that the \r\nconclusion of such an agreement, a new practice \r\nbetween Belarus and the United Nations, will \r\nconstitute an effective contribution by our country to \r\nspeeding up the delivery of international humanitarian \r\nassistance to people affected by disasters. \r\n The twentieth anniversary of the Chernobyl \r\ndisaster cannot be forgotten. We are grateful to the \r\nGovernments of Japan, Switzerland, Italy, Germany, \r\nthe United States and Ireland, and to the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency, the Red Cross and other \r\ninternational organizations; regardless of the changed \r\npriorities of international cooperation for Chernobyl \r\nand the socio-economic recovery of the affected \r\nterritory, they continue to devote attention to rendering \r\nhumanitarian assistance to the victims of the disaster.  \r\n The provision of mobile medical laboratories for \r\nremote populated areas and support for national efforts \r\nin monitoring the state of health of the affected \r\npopulation are important to us even today, 20 years \r\nfollowing the catastrophe. We are particularly grateful \r\nfor the efforts of the many international non-\r\ngovernmental organizations that serve as catalysts for \r\ninternational assistance to overcome the dire legacy of \r\nChernobyl, and we express the hope that work on \r\nhumanitarian support for the affected population will \r\nbe continued on the part of the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n Today’s discussion eloquently illustrates how \r\nmuch still remains to be done by the United Nations \r\nand by the entire international community in the \r\nhumanitarian area alone. We strongly regret the \r\nattempts by some large States to turn the General \r\nAssembly into a forum for political persecution and \r\npublic punishment of States not to their liking, not \r\nbelieving in the strongly urged single universally \r\napplied model of development.  \r\n In terms of human rights, for example, we see \r\nsuch actions as displacing the strengths and resources \r\nof Governments from the real and essential problems \r\nof the people of our planet to stir up instead \r\nconfrontation and mistrust. Those States pursue a goal \r\nthat can easily be perceived as deflecting the attention \r\nof the international community from their own political \r\ncriminal aggression with respect to independent States.  \r\n If all the resources set aside by a number of \r\ncountries to support political opposition in Belarus and \r\nother States not to their liking — which is a gross \r\n A/61/PV.52\r\n \r\n25 06-61315 \r\n \r\ninterference in the internal affairs of States — were \r\ndirected instead towards United Nations humanitarian \r\nwork, we would then be able to attain the planned level \r\nof $500 million for the Central Emergency Response \r\nFund. It is high time that responsible politicians gave \r\nthis some thought. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to thank Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan for his decades of work for the \r\nworld community and to congratulate the Secretary-\r\nGeneral-designate, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, on his election to \r\nthis high and very responsible position. We wish him \r\nevery success in his endeavours on behalf of the \r\npeoples of the world. \r\n Ms. Blum (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): I wish \r\nto thank the Secretary-General for his report on \r\nstrengthening of the coordination of emergency \r\nhumanitarian assistance of the United Nations \r\n(A/61/85).  \r\n In Colombia, humanitarian assistance to \r\nvulnerable populations is one of the State’s main \r\npriorities. The Presidential Agency for Social Action \r\nand International Cooperation coordinates a \r\ncomprehensive programme of action for the displaced \r\npopulation. The focus of the programme centres on the \r\ndignity of individuals and restoring the rights of \r\ndisplaced persons. Their social and economic \r\nreintegration into their places of origin or places of \r\nrelocation is also a high priority of the Government. \r\n The programme is funded by national resources \r\nand international cooperation resources. Its \r\ncomponents include emergency assistance, which has \r\ncovered 82 per cent of affected persons. The return of \r\nfamilies has been carried out with the support of the \r\nState and of various agencies, taking into account the \r\nhumanitarian principles of voluntary return and \r\nsecurity. Creating conditions for the social and \r\neconomic stabilization of affected persons through \r\nmeasures such as credits for productive projects and \r\ntechnical training, as well as supplementary support in \r\nthe areas of health, education and housing, are basic \r\ncomponents of the national policy in this area. \r\n Several years ago, we incorporated into our law \r\nthe Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement. Their \r\nadoption is among the recommendations contained in \r\nthe Secretary-General’s report.  \r\n With regard to the phenomenon of displacement, \r\nColombia believes it is essential that analyses be made \r\non the basis of objective, reliable and verifiable data. \r\nThat is why we are curious about the figure, cited in \r\nthe Secretary-General’s report, relating to internally \r\ndisplaced persons in my country. The report indicates \r\nneither the methodology followed to arrive at that \r\nestimate nor the statistical sources used. According to \r\nofficial figures, the number of registered displaced \r\npersons is 1,875,000 for the period 1998-2006. In \r\nColombia, despite the complexity of this phenomenon, \r\nthere has been a progressive and substantial reduction \r\nin the annual number of new displacement cases. That \r\nreflects the positive results of the Government’s \r\ndemocratic security policy and social development \r\npolicy. The number of newly displaced persons added \r\nto the national registry decreased from 425,000 in 2002 \r\nto 169,000 in 2005, and so far in 2006 it has fallen to \r\n90,000.  \r\n My delegation wishes to emphasize that it is \r\nimportant that humanitarian assistance be guided by \r\nthe principles of neutrality, impartiality and humanity, \r\nthat it correspond to the needs of countries and \r\ntherefore that it supplement Governments’ efforts to \r\nimprove their response capacity and their institutional \r\ninfrastructure in this area. That is the only way to deal \r\neffectively with emergency situations and to guarantee \r\nsustainability when it comes to restoring the social \r\nconditions of those suffering from the effects of \r\nhumanitarian emergencies. \r\n For those reasons, among others, my delegation \r\nbelieves that the thematic group approach, or cluster \r\napproach, is inappropriate as a model for humanitarian \r\nassistance. The main objective of the support provided \r\nby United Nations agencies must be strengthening \r\nnational capacities to deal with emergencies. In the \r\ncluster approach, the realities and specific conditions \r\nin countries requiring humanitarian assistance are not \r\nrecognized. In Colombia, for example, not all of the \r\nagencies participating in this area belong to the United \r\nNations; some of them are not even part of the United \r\nNations system. \r\n An approach such as the one proposed would \r\nweaken the role of Governments, because they could \r\nbe replaced by agencies as coordination entities. It is \r\nGovernments and States that should coordinate \r\nhumanitarian assistance, with the participation of \r\nagencies — not the other way around. Strengthening \r\nthe role of the United Nations must not come at the \r\nexpense of the role of Governments in this sensitive \r\narea. Therefore, any implementation of a model or \r\nA/61/PV.52  \r\n \r\n06-61315 26 \r\n \r\nprogramme in a country must have that country’s \r\nconsent. Likewise, any humanitarian reform initiative \r\nmust be based on an intergovernmental mandate, which \r\nin turn must always respect the sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity of States. \r\n I wish to take this opportunity to pay a special \r\ntribute to the World Food Programme for its \r\ncooperation with the Government of Colombia in \r\nassisting displaced persons. Outside the United Nations \r\nsystem, we wish to commend the work of the \r\nInternational Organization for Migration and the \r\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross. The \r\nexample set by the efforts of those entities should be \r\nthe rule, not the exception, in the area of humanitarian \r\nassistance. \r\n Accordingly, the financing of humanitarian \r\nassistance should be channelled towards the agencies \r\nand institutions that work best with States, have the \r\nbest performance record and therefore contribute most \r\neffectively to the strengthening of national institutions \r\nand their implementation capacity. Thus, resources \r\ncould be allocated to the entities whose work is most \r\neffective and efficient. \r\n The Secretary-General’s report refers to next \r\nsteps, in which engagement in humanitarian assistance \r\nwould be broadened. My delegation wishes to \r\nemphasize that it is important that the terms of such a \r\nbroadening be negotiated with the State in question. \r\nWe recognize and are grateful for the support of the \r\nentities working in this area.  \r\n At the same time, we agree with the report’s \r\nrecommendation that national leadership be \r\nstrengthened with a view to taking the required actions. \r\nThat would help to prevent the politicization of \r\nhumanitarian assistance and ensure full compliance \r\nwith its guiding principles. Otherwise, the system’s \r\nresponse capacity would be weakened and could suffer \r\na loss of legitimacy and credibility.  \r\n Establishing operative frameworks that take \r\ncountries’ specific situations into account would be \r\npositive for the system. Short-term successes must not \r\ncause us to lose the perspective of sustainability and \r\npermanent capacity for dealing effectively with \r\nemergency situations and providing timely \r\nhumanitarian assistance. \r\n Mr. Abdul Azeez (Sri Lanka): My delegation \r\nthanks the Secretary-General for his informative report \r\n(A/61/85) presented to the General Assembly under \r\nthis agenda item. We also take this opportunity to \r\nexpress our special thanks to President Clinton, United \r\nNations Special Envoy for Tsunami Recovery, for his \r\ncommitment and leadership in coordinating the \r\nongoing international efforts, and to all the \r\nstakeholders that supported us in the tsunami \r\nreconstruction and rehabilitation efforts in Sri Lanka. \r\nWe also welcome the recent initiative launched by \r\nPresident Clinton — Mangroves for the Future — and \r\nsupported by the International Union for the \r\nConservation of Nature and Natural Resources, known \r\nalso as the World Conservation Union, the United \r\nNations Environment Programme and the United \r\nNations Development Programme. \r\n The socio-economic impact of the tsunami was of \r\ngreat consequence as it compounded previously \r\nexisting vulnerabilities. Due to the timely response of \r\nthe Government, local communities, local non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and the private sector, \r\nbolstered by the United Nations and other international \r\nand intergovernmental organizations, the country \r\nrecorded no additional deaths owing to tsunami-related \r\ndiseases or lack of delayed medical treatment.  \r\n With international support, the Government \r\ncarried out immediate repairs of basic infrastructure, \r\nsuch as major pipelines and water resources, roads, \r\nbridges, electricity and telephone lines. National and \r\nforeign military personnel helped in the rescue \r\noperation, the identification and burial of the dead and \r\ndebris clearance. Nearly 600 schools and places of \r\nworship provided emergency shelter and food aid was \r\nprovided to 910,000 people. A compensation scheme \r\nfor victims was also put in place. \r\n The past decade has witnessed a significant \r\nincrease in human and economic losses caused by \r\nnatural disasters. The frequency and severity of these \r\nextreme events can be traced to several factors, the \r\nmain one being climate change. Increased vulnerability \r\nthroughout the world, caused by a number of \r\ndevelopment practices, also remains a significant \r\nfactor. The effects of climate change and the increasing \r\ndeterioration of the environment, particularly \r\ndeforestation and the reduction of both the quantity and \r\nquality of water, represent a major challenge in the \r\nnear future. \r\n Vulnerability to disasters also depends on human \r\nbehaviour. At issue is the degree to which a socio-\r\n A/61/PV.52\r\n \r\n27 06-61315 \r\n \r\neconomic system is either susceptible or resilient to the \r\nimpact of natural hazards. Such susceptibility or \r\nresilience is determined by a number of factors such as \r\nawareness of the hazards, the condition of human \r\nsettlements and infrastructure, public policy and \r\nadministration and the wealth of a given society and its \r\norganizational abilities in all fields of disaster and risk \r\nmanagement. A socio-economic system’s strength also \r\ndepends largely on development practices that do not \r\nfactor in any possible susceptibility to natural hazards. \r\nRisk reduction refers to activities taken to decrease \r\nboth vulnerable conditions and their causes, especially \r\nthose related to drought, floods and landslides. \r\n The Government of Sri Lanka has projected that \r\nit would take at least three to five years to complete the \r\ntask of rehabilitation and reconstruction and to fully \r\nrestore the services and livelihoods affected by the \r\ntsunami. This effort will cost approximately $2.2 \r\nbillion. The international community has committed \r\n$2.1 billion, out of which roughly $600 million has \r\nbeen disbursed. In addition, debt relief or moratorium, \r\nand balance of payments support, have also been \r\nreceived. Based on a clear assessment of the \r\nexperience so far, the Government is in the process of \r\nidentifying remaining gaps and taking corrective \r\nmeasures to ensure the speediest recovery. \r\n Sri Lanka has undertaken an objective assessment \r\nof post-tsunami relief, recovery and reconstruction \r\nintervention, and has projected the way forward. This \r\nexercise was carried out in conjunction with many \r\ndevelopment partners, resulting in a joint report \r\nentitled “Post-tsunami recovery and reconstruction”. \r\nEquity has been made a primary guiding principle in \r\nthe tsunami recovery programme, which takes into \r\naccount both overall poverty alleviation objectives and \r\nthe special needs of conflict-affected areas.  \r\n Given the number of actors involved and the size \r\nof the reconstruction needs that have arisen, \r\ncoordination, monitoring and evaluation have posed a \r\nhuge challenge. A clear lesson learned from this \r\ncomplex process has been the need for increased \r\ncommunication with the affected communities on vital \r\nconcerns such as gender mainstreaming, and with \r\nnational and international partners and agencies on \r\navoiding duplication of efforts. \r\n The delegation of Sri Lanka is pleased to note \r\nthat the issue of better utilization of resources through \r\nimproved coordination on the ground is very rightly \r\nincluded as an integral component of the recovery \r\nprogramme. Disaster management has also become a \r\nnational priority with the creation of a new ministry. A \r\nnational early warning and protection system has been \r\ndeveloped and will be coordinated by the country’s \r\nmeteorological department. Sri Lanka has also \r\nidentified the importance of building local capacity for \r\ntimely interventions in the event of natural disasters. \r\n We reckon that the United Nations and \r\ninternational efforts should support but cannot \r\nsubstitute for the efforts by both the Government and \r\nlocal civil society. The imperative of fully utilizing \r\nlocal human resources and local procurement as a \r\nmeans to contribute to national economic development \r\nand poverty alleviation should be acknowledged and \r\npromoted. \r\n In the recovery and reconstruction process, equity \r\nconcerns deserve particular attention. It is the shared \r\nresponsibility of the Government and development \r\nstakeholders to ensure that no one is left behind. In this \r\nregard, we hope that all pledges will be converted into \r\ncommitments, thus enabling the Government, assisted \r\nby other relevant actors, to coordinate and accelerate \r\nthe reconstruction and development of areas affected \r\nby disasters, and to ensure sustainable recovery of \r\nproperties, livelihoods, industries and infrastructure. \r\n Sri Lanka is making all efforts to ensure rapid \r\nrecovery of affected areas and to foster long-term \r\nsocial and economic development. Sri Lanka is \r\nresolved to achieve its 21st century growth plan and \r\nMillennium Development Goals through empowerment \r\nof local communities and strategic coordination of \r\nexisting Government and non-government \r\nstakeholders.  \r\n By mid-2006, 56,000 units of transitional shelter \r\nwere completed by development partners to \r\naccommodate the displaced families living in \r\nemergency shelters. Of this number, 6,105 units have \r\nbeen decommissioned and at least 5,224 families have \r\nmoved into permanent shelters. Through a combination \r\nof the donor-driven, owner-driven, private sector and \r\ngroup housing programmes, 55,483 houses have \r\nalready been completed and 40,589 units are under \r\nconstruction. The authors of the tsunami housing \r\npolicy paper have estimated the number of total \r\nhousing units required to be approximately 120,000. \r\nThe recovery process is making positive progress and \r\nwe are hopeful that we will realize the targets set. \r\n In conclusion, allow me to observe that the \r\ntsunami tragedy highlighted to all of us the value of \r\ncollective action and international solidarity. The \r\nA/61/PV.52  \r\n \r\n06-61315 28 \r\n \r\nGovernment and the people of Sri Lanka thank once \r\nagain all those who have helped us and continue to \r\nhelp us in our recovery programme.  \r\nProgramme of work \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I should like to inform \r\nmembers that there has been a request by the sponsors  \r\n \r\nof the draft resolution contained in document \r\nA/61/L.20 that action on the draft resolution be \r\npostponed. \r\n The General Assembly will therefore take up sub-\r\nitem (r) of agenda item 108 at a later date. \r\n The meeting rose at 1.05 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n"
