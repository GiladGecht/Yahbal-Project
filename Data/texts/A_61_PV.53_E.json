International assistance, which has been a \r\nlifeline for the Palestinian people, began as much-\r\nneeded humanitarian assistance to a people, the \r\nmajority of whom had become refugees by force and \r\ncoercion. Soon after, with increased international \r\nattention to the core political context of the Palestinian \r\nquestion, international assistance to the Palestinian \r\npeople developed. That evolved into assistance on \r\nwhich the Palestinian people could depend. It helped \r\nthem endure the crushing reality of the Israeli military \r\noccupation and the economic and political deprivation \r\nthat has been imposed on them and with which the \r\nmajority of them have had to live. \r\n This assistance is also very political in terms of \r\nits context. That was clearly evident from the sharp \r\nincrease in international assistance with the start of the \r\npeace process and the establishment of the Palestinian \r\nNational Authority. Numerous large-scale \r\ninfrastructure projects were internationally funded, \r\nlaying the foundation for sustainable development in a \r\nstable Palestine leading to a brighter tomorrow for \r\nfuture generations. The international community was \r\ndetermined to support the political efforts of the \r\nPalestinian leadership to achieve peace and stability in \r\nthe region through the building of a stable and \r\neconomically viable Palestinian entity, committed to \r\npeace and respect for international law. Regrettably, \r\nthat commitment and the resulting accomplishments \r\nhave been confronted with the crushing military might \r\nof the Israeli occupation, which, over the past six \r\nyears, has decimated the cherished achievements of the \r\nPalestinian people. In fact, through illegal policies and \r\nmilitary aggression, as well as a severe economic \r\nsiege, Israel, the occupying Power, has ensured the ruin \r\nof the Palestinian economy and the transformation of \r\nthe Palestinian population from a young, productive \r\nsociety into a crippled and starved one. \r\n It has been 39 years since the Israeli occupation \r\nof the Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, \r\nA/61/PV.53  \r\n \r\n06-61363 2 \r\n \r\nbegan. Much has changed on the ground and at the \r\npolitical level since then, but one thing has remained \r\nrelentlessly consistent: the Israeli occupation’s policy \r\nof subjugating the Palestinian people by exploiting \r\ntheir resources, denying them their rights and \r\nsabotaging their dreams. \r\n Before the beginning of the peace process, the \r\nIsraeli occupation shackled the Palestinian economy \r\nand kept it hostage, denying it the ability to reach its \r\nfull potential or to establish any viable foundations. \r\nProduction, manufacturing, import and export were all \r\neconomic activities denied the Palestinians and \r\nreserved for the exclusive benefit of Israel, the \r\noccupying Power. For decades, the Palestinian \r\neconomy was coerced into being an outlet for Israeli \r\nproducts that enjoyed absolute hegemony over the \r\nmarket. Even after the signing of various economic \r\nagreements as part of the peace process, Israel, the \r\noccupying Power, insisted on the upper hand over the \r\nflow of currency, merchandise and other economic \r\nelements, keeping overwhelming pressure on the \r\nfledgling Palestinian economy.  \r\n In addition to exercising that hegemony over the \r\npast six years, Israel, the occupying Power, has also \r\nemployed an intricate system of closure and siege that \r\nhas repeatedly caused serious crises in the Palestinian \r\neconomy and, more recently, has absolutely devastated \r\nall sectors of society. \r\n Israel, the occupying Power, has spared no effort \r\nand left no stone unturned in working to achieve \r\neconomic and social development for its citizens at the \r\nexpense of the Palestinian people. More important, it \r\nhas made a policy of denying the Palestinian people the \r\nright even to lay down the foundations for a future \r\nState, destroying whatever achievements are \r\naccomplished to that end. \r\n Over the past six years, Israel, the occupying \r\nPower, has repeatedly and systematically targeted and \r\ndestroyed the economic achievements that international \r\nassistance funded for the Palestinian people.  \r\n Infrastructure projects, including water and \r\nsewage networks, have been repeatedly targeted and \r\ndestroyed by the Israeli military aggression. Gaza’s \r\nonly electrical power plant was destroyed. Its \r\ninternational airport and port have also been turned \r\ninto a pile of rubble by the Israeli occupying forces. \r\nPalestinian institutions, including those essential for \r\nthe protection and upholding of the rule of law, have \r\nalso been systematically destroyed. The crippling \r\neffect of this systematic campaign of destruction \r\ncannot be overstated.  \r\n At the same time, it is very important to keep in \r\nmind that this tragic situation is doubly devastating \r\nbecause the losses incurred by the Palestinian people \r\nare losses that the Palestinian economy cannot \r\nwithstand and at the same time are funded by \r\ninternational resources that the Palestinian people \r\ncannot replace. Allow me to emphasize here that the \r\ndestruction of one internationally funded project means \r\nthat important and scarce resources have to be diverted \r\nto the project’s reconstruction, resulting in the \r\nPalestinian people losing a potential additional \r\neconomic asset to their economy.  \r\n In effect, this systematic Israeli campaign of \r\ndestruction and sabotage has trapped the Palestinian \r\npeople into a cycle of repair and reconstruction rather \r\nthan of construction and development. The \r\ncomprehensive nature of the devastation wrought in all \r\nsectors of the Palestinian economy and society by \r\nIsraeli military aggression leaves no room for \r\ndevelopment and planning. Instead, it confines the \r\nPalestinian people to a limited reality, where survival is \r\nan end goal rather than a given, and where \r\ndevelopment is a long-forgotten priority rather than a \r\ncontinuous reality. \r\n Examining the destruction of what international \r\nassistance builds is only half of the story, for it does \r\nnot expose the wider picture. Nor does it uncover the \r\ncomprehensive effect of these devastating Israeli acts \r\nof aggression. Hand in hand with the economic siege \r\nimposed on the occupied Palestinian territory, \r\nparticularly the Gaza Strip, Israel, the occupying \r\nPower, has succeeded in neutralizing any positive \r\noutcome of international assistance to the Palestinian \r\npeople. It has diverted this assistance from sustainable \r\ndevelopment into largely emergency humanitarian \r\nassistance. While the generous contributions of the \r\ninternational community in this respect enjoy the \r\nhighest regard and appreciation of the Palestinian \r\npeople and their leadership, they do not solve the \r\nproblem. This is simply because what is now largely \r\nemergency assistance only aids Palestinian recipients \r\nin surviving the current crisis, rather than in building \r\nfor a brighter future. It is therefore of great importance \r\nto look at current assistance needs in this context. \r\n A/61/PV.53\r\n \r\n3 06-61363 \r\n \r\n Currently, a large number of Palestinians live \r\nunder the poverty line of less than $2.10 a day. Over \r\nthe past year, the number of people living under the \r\npoverty line in Gaza has risen by 30 per cent, to a \r\nshocking 75 per cent. These disturbing figures are the \r\ndirect result of the siege that Israel, the occupying \r\nPower, has imposed on the Gaza Strip, which isolates it \r\nfrom the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory and \r\nthe world.  \r\n Consequently, out of 1.4 million Palestinians \r\nliving in the Gaza Strip, 1.1 million now depend on \r\nUnited Nations assistance for their daily food. Simply \r\nto say “food insecurity” in this case is an \r\nunderstatement. Regrettably, these astounding facts are \r\nthe tip of the iceberg in Palestine, which, as the United \r\nNations and other experts have warned, is facing a \r\ncatastrophic humanitarian situation as a result of the \r\noppressive policies of the Israeli occupation. \r\n Over the past year, international assistance to the \r\nPalestinian people has continued, although through a \r\nnew mechanism designed by the Quartet as a response \r\nto the appointment of the new Palestinian Government. \r\nHowever well-intended this new mechanism is, the \r\nconsequences on the ground of what has essentially \r\nbeen an international community boycott of the \r\nPalestinian Authority has been absolutely paralysing. \r\nThis is especially significant when taking into \r\nconsideration the fact that the current mechanism does \r\nnot include assistance to the Palestinian Authority that \r\nwould aid it in paying the 130,000 public servants who \r\nconstitute 23 per cent of the employed Palestinian \r\npopulation. Moreover, the boycott is compounded by \r\nIsrael’s withholding of the $60 million a month owed \r\nto the Palestinian Authority in collected taxes. \r\n These new circumstances vis-à-vis international \r\nassistance have aggravated an already intolerable \r\neconomic and humanitarian situation on the ground. \r\nAdding to the woes of high unemployment and virtual \r\neconomic collapse, Palestinian public servants, who \r\nhad hitherto been the remaining secure financial \r\ncontributors to the economy, are now, in a word, \r\nbankrupt.  \r\n While it is understandable that assistance cannot \r\nbe provided contrary to a Member State’s policies or \r\npolitical goals, this international boycott is \r\ninexplicable, as it has effectively resulted in the \r\ncollective punishment of the Palestinian people. The \r\nboycott is simply counterproductive, because it has \r\nalso complicated an already complex situation on the \r\nground, both politically and economically. In this \r\ncontext, I would like to draw the Assembly’s attention \r\nto the recent report submitted by Mr. John Dugard on \r\nthe situation of human rights in the Palestinian \r\nterritories occupied since 1967, in which he stated that \r\n“[T]he Palestinian people have been subjected to \r\neconomic sanctions — the first time an occupied \r\npeople have been so treated” (A/HRC/2/5, summary). \r\n Israel, the occupying Power, has repeatedly used \r\nthe convenient guise of self-defence and so-called \r\nsecurity needs to justify its unrelenting violations of \r\ninternational law and international humanitarian law, \r\nits campaign of destruction and military aggression \r\nagainst the Palestinian economy as well as the siege it \r\nhas imposed on the occupied Palestinian territory, \r\nincluding East Jerusalem and, in particular, the Gaza \r\nStrip.  \r\n Self-defence and security needs should never be \r\nacceptable excuses for gross human rights violations \r\nand contraventions of international law. In effect, \r\naiming attacks at civilian targets is forbidden under \r\ninternational humanitarian law and is considered a war \r\ncrime. In view of the occupying Power’s responsibility \r\nfor the lives and welfare of the population under its \r\noccupation, Israel is obliged under international law to \r\nmake reparation for the war crimes it has committed.  \r\n This case should be no different. Indeed, the \r\nserious situation on the ground resulting from the \r\nreprehensible actions of the occupying Power should \r\nfurther motivate the international community to act \r\nresolutely and put a final end to the destruction of an \r\nentire people, not merely their property, funded \r\nprojects and potential future. \r\n In this context, international assistance to the \r\nPalestinian people is of imperative importance, as this \r\nassistance is the lifeline on which a viable Palestinian \r\nState, living side by side with Israel, could be founded. \r\nThe destruction of Palestinian infrastructure, public \r\nbuildings and other economically vital institutions by \r\nthe occupying Power amounts to war crimes, as many \r\nreports submitted to the Assembly have stated.  \r\n These must be brought to a halt so that the \r\nassistance of the international community can be \r\nrediverted towards construction and development. The \r\ninternational community must not allow Israel, the \r\noccupying Power, to continue wasting and sabotaging \r\nthe world’s generous contributions through its \r\nA/61/PV.53  \r\n \r\n06-61363 4 \r\n \r\ncollective punishment of the Palestinian people, denial \r\nof their rights and destruction of their chances for a \r\nviable State. \r\n Ms. Sahussarungsi (Thailand): I am delivering \r\nthis statement on behalf of the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Thailand. \r\n Allow me at the outset to acknowledge with \r\nappreciation the efforts undertaken by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in the context of the series of reports focusing \r\non the current recovery process in the aftermath of \r\nnatural disasters, as well as the strengthening of \r\ninternational coordination of emergency humanitarian \r\nassistance — reports that are before us. \r\n As Thailand was one of the countries adversely \r\naffected by the tsunami in 2004, the issue of \r\nhumanitarian and emergency assistance is close to our \r\nhearts. We are pleased to humbly share with the \r\nAssembly, in this joint debate under agenda item 69, \r\nsub-item (a), our own past experiences regarding the \r\nstrengthening of emergency and humanitarian \r\nassistance for the road to recovery, as well as our views \r\non the strengthening of international cooperation in \r\nthose fields. \r\n The road to recovery in the aftermath of the \r\ntsunami in Thailand has remained challenging for our \r\ncountry. In this regard, we appreciate all of the \r\nassistance contributed by the international community \r\nduring that time. For its part, the Thai Government has \r\nestablished a policy of preparedness for disaster  \r\ncrisis — a national master plan that the State agencies \r\nconcerned can use as a framework to adopt methods \r\nand measures to respond to future disasters in the \r\nregion. \r\n Of equal importance to crisis management are \r\npre- and post-crisis management, which require \r\ncooperation among national agencies and from the \r\ninternational community. One approach to mitigating \r\nthe impact of disasters is establishing early-warning \r\nsystems, while raising the alert level of the general \r\npublic and relief operators. Thailand believes that \r\nregional arrangements are necessary to effectively \r\nrespond to regional disasters. \r\n In this regard, in late 2005, Thailand, together \r\nwith countries in the South-East Asian and Indian \r\nOcean region, established a Multi-Donor Trust Fund \r\nfor a tsunami early-warning system. The objective of \r\nthe Trust Fund is to enhance the development of \r\ncapacity-building for a tsunami early warning system \r\nfor the countries in the South-East Asian and Indian \r\nOcean region. The Fund is under the management of \r\nthe United Nations Economic and Social Commission \r\nfor Asia and the Pacific. The current amount in the \r\nFund is $12.5 million — $10 million having been \r\ncontributed by Thailand and $2.5 million by Sweden. \r\nAt the most recent meeting of the Advisory Council of \r\nthe Trust Fund in October 2006, approximately 23 \r\nprojects were proposed through regional and national \r\narrangements for the utilization of the Fund, and we \r\nwish to encourage further contributions to the Fund — \r\nand its utilization — by the international community, \r\ncivil society and the private sector. \r\n We also wish to draw attention to the Association \r\nof Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum standby \r\narrangement. The arrangement aims to facilitate timely \r\nand effective relief efforts in the region through \r\nstrengthened linkages, and we believe that it can \r\ncomplement and link up with existing United Nations \r\narrangements and programmes, as well as with those of \r\nother organizations, including the World Food \r\nProgramme (WFP). In this regard, we wish to express \r\nour appreciation to the WFP for having chosen \r\nThailand to be the site of the Asian regional \r\npreparedness and response facility. We believe that the \r\nUtapao air base offers an ideal location for the \r\nhumanitarian operation. The Government of Thailand \r\nwill work out the details with the WFP in order soon to \r\nmake it a reality. \r\n Thailand also welcomes the establishment of the \r\nCentral Emergency Response Fund, which will \r\nstrengthen responses in the context of time-critical \r\nrequirements, as well as core elements of humanitarian \r\nresponses in underfunded crises. \r\n Sustainable development with an emphasis on \r\nhuman and social development is the core of \r\nThailand’s humanitarian assistance policy. Emphasis \r\nwill also be placed on sustainable and long-lasting \r\nresults. In this regard, it is of the utmost importance \r\nthat United Nations agencies coordinate their policies \r\nand programme implementation in order to deliver \r\nassistance more effectively and make real changes on \r\nthe ground. The capacity-building of local communities \r\nand individuals is also a key factor in determining \r\nsustainable responses. \r\n In this regard, the United Nations country team \r\nhas a key role to play in strengthening synergies \r\n A/61/PV.53\r\n \r\n5 06-61363 \r\n \r\nbetween the capacity-development efforts of local and \r\ninternational actors, including the private sector and \r\nnon-governmental organizations, with a view to \r\nensuring greater coherence of policies and \r\neffectiveness of humanitarian responses. \r\n In this respect, Thailand takes note of the report \r\nof the High-level Panel on System-wide Coherence to \r\nimprove the effectiveness and efficiency of the United \r\nNations, particularly in the field of humanitarian \r\nassistance. We also look forward to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s forthcoming report and recommendations. \r\n Strengthening the capacity of national and local \r\ngovernment and communities to prepare for and \r\nrespond to crises is crucial if we are to mitigate the \r\nnegative effects of disasters. The United Nations \r\nshould assess existing preparedness capabilities and \r\nnetworks at the national and local levels in order to \r\nprovide for the diverse needs of capacity-building \r\nassistance. \r\n Finally, my delegation wishes to stress that the \r\nsuccess of our work with the United Nations depends \r\nnot on what we promise, but on changes and \r\nimprovements we actually make in the lives of people \r\non the ground. \r\n Mr. Løvald (Norway): Norway remains a strong \r\nsupporter of the humanitarian work of the United \r\nNations. We support the reform agenda and the efforts \r\nmade to strengthen the humanitarian response system. \r\nA lot has been done in this regard. However, there are \r\nstill challenges that need to be addressed. \r\n Norway would like the United Nations to \r\nintensify its work to integrate a gender perspective in \r\nall United Nations programmes in a systematic manner. \r\nEvaluations of the recent emergency responses \r\nfollowing the tsunami, the Pakistan earthquake and the \r\nsituation in Darfur demonstrated that gender issues \r\nhave been neglected to a large extent.  \r\n Gender aspects must be integrated in the cluster \r\nreform agenda and in disaster risk reduction strategies. \r\nMore effective preventive and protective measures are \r\nneeded to address sexual and gender-based violence. \r\nWe are pleased with the ongoing work in the Inter-\r\nAgency Standing Committee on concrete measures to \r\nmainstream gender in humanitarian action. \r\n It is safe to conclude that the Central Emergency \r\nResponse Fund (CERF) has been a success so far. The \r\nCERF has led to improved response and more \r\npredictable funding, both as regards sudden-onset \r\nemergencies and neglected crises. It is vital to maintain \r\nspeed and flexibility while at the same time ensuring \r\nsufficient financial control. In line with the \r\nrecommendation by the High-level Panel on System-\r\nwide Coherence, Norway intends to increase its \r\ncontribution to the CERF in 2007. We encourage other \r\ndonors to increase their contributions. At the same \r\ntime, a wider donor base is needed, and we encourage \r\nMember States that have not yet contributed to do so. \r\n Effective humanitarian coordination on the \r\nground is of utmost importance. Strengthening the \r\nhumanitarian coordinator system is all about having the \r\nright people with the right skills in the right places at \r\nthe right times. Recent initiatives, such as developing a \r\nstand-by capacity of trained humanitarian coordinators, \r\nare steps in the right direction. \r\n Norway remains fully committed to the cluster \r\napproach as a key element of humanitarian reform. \r\nImportant improvements have been achieved, but a lot \r\nremains to be done to ensure a clearer division of \r\nlabour, better capacity and defined operational targets. \r\nWe need to develop more effective partnerships \r\nbetween the United Nations and non-United Nations \r\nhumanitarian actors, such as non-governmental \r\norganizations and the Red Cross and Red Crescent \r\nMovement. \r\n The prevention of humanitarian crises needs to be \r\nput higher on the United Nations agenda. We are faced \r\nwith prolonged armed conflicts, as well as climate \r\nchange, environmental degradation, floods, droughts, \r\nhurricanes, population growth, uncontrolled \r\nurbanization and corruption. We need to be better \r\nprepared to respond to humanitarian crises that result \r\nfrom these challenges. \r\n Norway would like to underline that cooperation \r\nbetween military forces and humanitarian agencies in \r\ndisaster relief must be approached from a humanitarian \r\nperspective. Recent emergencies have demonstrated the \r\nneed for better coordination between humanitarian and \r\nmilitary responses, based on clear guidelines. The \r\nUnited Nations Office for the Coordination of \r\nHumanitarian Affairs has now updated the Oslo \r\nGuidelines on the Use of Military and Civil Defence \r\nAssets in Disaster Relief. The Guidelines will be  \r\nre-launched in Oslo on 27 November. We hope that the \r\nupdated Guidelines will contribute to a better \r\nA/61/PV.53  \r\n \r\n06-61363 6 \r\n \r\nunderstanding and better practices in civil-military \r\ncoordination in the years to come. \r\n In conflict situations too — such as that in \r\nAfghanistan — it is vital to ensure effective civil-\r\nmilitary coordination, while at the same time \r\nrespecting the different roles and responsibilities of \r\ncivilian and military actors. There is a need for a \r\nchange of pace in civilian efforts to build a durable \r\npeace in Afghanistan. In order to achieve this, civil-\r\nmilitary coordination must be improved. In particular, \r\nwe would like to see a strengthened coordination role \r\nfor the United Nations Assistance Mission in \r\nAfghanistan, in close collaboration with the Afghan \r\nauthorities. We look forward to discussing further how \r\nthis can be achieved. \r\n The High-level Panel on System-wide Coherence \r\nhas called for a more unified United Nations country \r\npresence: the “One UN” programmes. The Panel \r\nconfirms the need to continue humanitarian reform \r\nefforts vigorously. The recommendations must be \r\nfollowed up, and we look forward to the continued \r\nleadership of the Secretary-General and the incoming \r\nSecretary-General in this respect. \r\n Finally, Norway wishes to express its gratitude to \r\nthe Emergency Relief Coordinator, Mr. Jan Egeland, \r\nfor his tireless efforts in mobilizing the United Nations \r\nand the entire humanitarian community to respond to \r\nhumanitarian emergencies. His strong leadership \r\nfollowing the Indian Ocean tsunami set new standards \r\nfor emergency response. He has also brought the \r\nworld’s attention to neglected and underfunded crises, \r\nsuch as those in Darfur and in northern Uganda. \r\n Mr. Kapoma (Zambia): My delegation would \r\nlike to thank the Secretary-General for the good report \r\n(A/61/314) on international cooperation on \r\nhumanitarian assistance in the field of natural disasters, \r\nfrom relief to development. The report highlights key \r\nchallenges faced by the international community in \r\nimproving the international response to disasters and in \r\nstrengthening the capacity of disaster-prone countries \r\nin disaster management. \r\n Zambia attaches a great deal of importance to \r\nUnited Nations efforts in strengthening the \r\ncoordination of humanitarian and disaster relief \r\nassistance, and to the special economic disaster-\r\nmanagement assistance that has been provided and \r\ncontinues to be provided to disaster-prone countries. \r\nWe therefore welcome the recommendations contained \r\nin the report of the Secretary-General, which was \r\nsubmitted in response to resolution 60/125 of  \r\n15 December 2005, which requested the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to improve the international response to \r\nnatural disasters. \r\n My delegation recognizes that disasters cause \r\ndirect losses to productive capital and stocks and to \r\neconomic and social infrastructure, as well as indirect \r\nlosses, by disrupting production and the flow of goods \r\nand services, thus leading to loss of earnings. \r\nFurthermore, we recognize that the importance of \r\naddressing what has become a vicious cycle of \r\nrecurrent human and material loss, environmental and \r\nsocial degradation and increased vulnerability requires \r\nthat the international community work together \r\ntowards a disaster management approach that addresses \r\nthe interconnectedness of threats and vulnerabilities on \r\na global level. We believe that this approach should \r\nengage national Governments in strategic disaster \r\nplanning and preparedness at regional, national and \r\nlocal levels, sustaining high levels of assistance for \r\npost-disaster recovery and reconstruction and giving \r\npriority to risk reduction as a matter of serious \r\nconcern. \r\n Mr. Chidyausiki (Zimbabwe), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair. \r\n Zambia values the importance of the institutional, \r\nadministrative and legal frameworks for effective \r\ndisaster management, the more so now when the \r\nemphasis is more on disaster risk reduction — a \r\nproactive approach — than on disaster management, \r\nwhich tends to be reactive in nature. In this regard, \r\nZambia launched, in 2005, a national disaster \r\nmanagement policy and a national disaster \r\nmanagement operations manual. \r\n The development of the policy and its subsequent \r\nlaunch were necessitated by the need to move away \r\nfrom an ad hoc and fragmented approach to a disaster \r\nmanagement to a proactive and coordinated approach. \r\nThe policy provides the national framework for a \r\ndisaster management regime that spells out the \r\nfunctions of all stakeholders, from the central \r\nGovernment to the satellite or village committees at the \r\ncommunity level. The country is also in the process of \r\nputting in place a legal framework for disaster \r\nmanagement. The bill to that effect is at the draft stage. \r\n To ensure consensus on national issues relating to \r\ndisasters, Zambia has also established the National \r\n A/61/PV.53\r\n \r\n7 06-61363 \r\n \r\nDisaster Management Consultative Forum, which is a \r\nnational platform that brings together the Government, \r\nUnited Nations agencies, non-governmental \r\norganizations and private-sector agencies. The platform \r\nprovides a forum for exchange of information relating \r\nto disaster-risk reduction activities and also serves as \r\nthe entry point for humanitarian assistance from the \r\nprivate sector and civil society. \r\n With regard to international cooperation on \r\nhumanitarian assistance, Zambia has participated in a \r\nnumber of international assistance activities such as the \r\ninternational rescue operation for the Mozambique \r\nflood experience in 2000, and has participated, and \r\ncontinues to participate, in a number of United Nations \r\nassessment missions. I would also like mention that \r\nZambia is ready to participate in any future \r\ninternational activities, as and when the need arises. \r\n Zambia has also recorded some achievements in \r\nthe area of disaster and risk reduction. Those include \r\ninitiating the disaster management bill; establishing \r\nand equipping an emergency operations centre; \r\noperationalizing the national disaster management \r\nstructure, taking it from the Committee of Ministers to \r\ncommunity members at community and village level; \r\nhosting the Southern African Development Community \r\nsimulation exercise code-named Operation Blue Angel, \r\nwhich involved the airlifting of relief supplies from \r\ntowns to rural parts of Zambia in 2003; and \r\nsuccessfully implementing the World Bank-supported \r\nemergency drought recovery project from 2003 to \r\n2005. \r\n Despite those achievements, Zambia still faces a \r\nnumber of constraints. Those include the lack of \r\ncomprehensive baseline information on vulnerability; \r\nlimited logistical capacity for timely response to \r\ndisaster situations; the need to streamline an early \r\nwarning system; and the lack of comprehensive \r\nnational capacity assessment relating to resource \r\navailability for disaster response and the \r\nimplementation of mitigation activities. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to appeal to the \r\ninternational community to continue to support least \r\ndeveloped countries in strengthening the coordination \r\nof humanitarian and disaster relief assistance. In the \r\ncase of Zambia, we would request assistance in the \r\nfollowing areas for building capacity for preparedness \r\nand timely disaster response: education and training for \r\ndisaster preparedness; logistical capacity for timely \r\nresponse to disaster situations; streamlining and \r\nstrengthening early warning systems; carrying out a \r\ncomprehensive vulnerability assessment and analysis \r\nin order to have baseline information on national \r\nvulnerability; and carrying out a national capacity \r\nassessment to determine resource availability and gaps. \r\n Once provided, that assistance would play a very \r\nimportant role in enabling Zambia to participate \r\neffectively in humanitarian assistance in the field of \r\nnatural disasters when the need arises, both at the \r\nnational and the international level. \r\n Mr. Bouresly (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nGeneral Assembly has before it today an important \r\nagenda item: “Strengthening of the coordination of \r\nhumanitarian and disaster relief assistance of the \r\nUnited Nations”. In recent years, the United Nations \r\nhas done important work through its specialized \r\ninstitutions, programmes and offices, especially in \r\nfacilitating the transport and provision of emergency \r\nassistance. We support the recommendations of the \r\nSecretary-General regarding re-orienting international \r\nhumanitarian assistance efforts and the provision of \r\ngoods and services, so as to strengthen local, national \r\nand regional disaster relief management and implement \r\nthe programmes of the International Federation of Red \r\nCross and Red Crescent Societies. \r\n I would like to underscore that the State and \r\npeople of Kuwait continue to stand by friendly and \r\nbrotherly countries that have suffered as a result of \r\ndevastating disasters. We welcome the efforts, \r\nsolidarity and cooperation of the international \r\ncommunity, as well as its rapid response in providing \r\ngenerous assistance and managing the delivery of \r\nhumanitarian relief to mitigate the effects of such \r\ndisasters on the people affected by them. The \r\ninternational community has given expression to the \r\nnoblest form of solidarity and cooperation during \r\ncrises, such as the 2004 tsunami, which affected South-\r\nEast Asian and Indian Ocean countries, the devastating \r\ndisaster caused by Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana, in \r\nthe United States, and the earthquakes that struck \r\nPakistan. Kuwait’s policy in addressing such disasters \r\nis to provide bilateral assistance to affected regions and \r\ncountries after assessing their needs, keeping in mind \r\nthe need to act expeditiously. Over the past two years, \r\nwe have provided $800 million to countries suffering \r\nas a result of the tsunami, $800 million to countries \r\nwhose citizens suffered from the South Asian \r\nearthquakes and $500 million to the victims of \r\nA/61/PV.53  \r\n \r\n06-61363 8 \r\n \r\nHurricane Katrina. We have also participated in \r\naddressing the destructive effects of Hurricane Wilma \r\nby offering $300,000 to Jamaica, Grenada, Cuba, \r\nHonduras, Haiti and Belize. Those figures reflect net \r\nassistance, as we deduct no transport or administrative \r\ncosts from our contributions.  \r\n We have also contributed $200,000 to the Central \r\nEmergency Response Fund (CERF). In addition, we \r\nhave provided $2.5 million to the Kuwaiti Red \r\nCrescent to provide assistance to the victims of the \r\nearthquake in Pakistan and South Asia. That is in \r\naddition to our contributions to United Nations entities, \r\nincluding the Office for the Coordination of \r\nHumanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the World Health \r\nOrganization, the World Food Programme, UNICEF \r\nand the United Nations Population Fund. \r\n The rise in natural disasters in recent years, \r\nincluding in terms of their devastating impact on \r\nhuman lives and their socio-economic and \r\nenvironmental effects, in particular in developing \r\ncountries, calls for international solidarity and the \r\nmobilization of efforts commensurate with the scale of \r\ndisasters. In that regard, we would like to point to the \r\nimportance of a strong regional early warning system, \r\nto mitigate the harmful effects of natural disasters. \r\n With regard to assistance to the Palestinian \r\npeople, the report (A/61/80) of the Secretary-General \r\nemphasizes that, in the period under consideration, \r\nthere has been a very rapid series of events in the \r\noccupied Palestinian territories. This period has been \r\nmarked by uncertainty, ambiguity and disappointment. \r\nThe report also cites very grave figures about the \r\nPalestinian economy. For instance, according to the \r\nOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, \r\n48 per cent of Palestinians live below the poverty line, \r\n23 per cent are unemployed and 76 per cent have \r\nexpressed the desire to receive assistance. In this \r\nregard, we emphasize that Kuwait continues to offer \r\nassistance to the Palestinian Authority, either directly \r\nor through the United Nations Relief and Works \r\nAgency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East \r\n(UNRWA).  \r\n We believe that the international community must \r\nintensify its efforts to put an end to Israel’s outrageous \r\nviolations, to halt construction of the separation wall, \r\nto end restrictions on the movement of Palestinians, \r\nand resume negotiations to reach a peaceful, just and \r\ncomprehensive settlement  of the Middle East conflict. \r\n Kuwait will continue aid on a bilateral basis, as \r\nwell as through United Nations agencies, not only for \r\ndisaster relief but also to help rebuild through efforts \r\nundertaken by entities such as the Kuwait Economic \r\nDevelopment Fund and Kuwaiti civil society \r\norganizations and charities, with a view to creating a \r\nworld of peace, stability  and prosperity for all. \r\n Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I should like to express my support for the \r\nstatement made by the representative of South Africa \r\non behalf of the Group of 77 and China, and to convey \r\nmy appreciation to the Secretary-General for his \r\nreports, which help to facilitate our discussions on this \r\nissue — one that is of special importance to Egypt. \r\n The Secretary-General’s report, submitted in \r\naccordance with resolution 60/124, on strengthening of \r\nthe coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance \r\nby the United Nations (A/61/85) is a response to issues \r\nof real concern. There was an 18 per cent increase in \r\nthe number of large-scale disasters last year, which \r\ncaused the deaths of 92,000, affected the lives of 157 \r\nmillion others and resulted in $159 billion worth of \r\nmaterial damage. We are particularly concerned about \r\nthe statistics that show that hydrometeorological and \r\ngeological disasters are increasing in frequency, \r\ndiversity, intensity and strength and that their \r\ndestructive impact is therefore also increasing. \r\n Accordingly, Egypt reaffirms that there is an \r\nurgent need to build up the institutional capacities of \r\ncountries to effectively and successfully deal with \r\nnatural disasters and the consequences of conflict and \r\nwar before disaster strikes through preventive actions \r\naimed at strengthening the capacities of countries in \r\nterms of predictability, early warning and \r\npreparedness, as well as to prepare for the subsequent \r\nphase of assisting in eliminating the effects of disasters \r\nthrough reconstruction efforts leading towards \r\nsustainable development. \r\n The report of the Secretary-General confirms \r\nthat, despite the many international instruments \r\nemphasizing the importance of building capacity to \r\nrespond to disasters, such capacity remains constrained \r\nbecause of a lack of funding and other resources. Thus, \r\nin the face of these changes, United Nations efforts to \r\ncoordinate national and international entities and to \r\npromote international multilateral coordination must be \r\nintensified. \r\n A/61/PV.53\r\n \r\n9 06-61363 \r\n \r\n We therefore welcome the Secretary-General’s \r\ninvitation to Member States, donors and relevant \r\nhumanitarian organizations to invest in preparedness, \r\nvigilance and recovery operations aimed at reducing \r\nthe possible negative affects of emergency \r\nhumanitarian situations. We agree with his reference to \r\nthe regional dimension in dealing with crises that \r\nrequire a cross-border response, and support his \r\nproposal that Member States and relevant United \r\nNations organizations support regional coordinating \r\nmechanisms, which will result in additional coherence \r\nand the flexible, effective and optimal use of \r\ncapacities. \r\n Egypt is eager to participate in international \r\nefforts to deal with the effects of humanitarian \r\ndisasters and in international, regional and bilateral \r\nefforts to provide emergency humanitarian relief \r\naccording to the needs and priorities of affected \r\ncountries. Egypt was one of the countries that \r\nestablished the Central Emergency Response Fund and \r\nhas provided the Fund with financial support. We have \r\nalso provided technical support through the \r\nparticipation of one of our experts in the Fund’s \r\nconsultative group. In this regard, we support the \r\nrecommendation contained in the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport that the impact of the Fund be maximized and its \r\nfunctions improved, as envisioned in resolution \r\n60/124. \r\n We have all agreed that we should avoid using \r\ngeneral and non-specific concepts in humanitarian \r\nactivities, such as the language used in the \r\nrecommendation in the Secretary-General’s report that \r\ndonors provide the necessary resources for \r\nimplementing the cluster approach and cluster-related \r\nactivities at the country level. The usefulness of \r\ndefining concepts and consolidating activities when \r\ndealing with natural disasters and other crises has yet \r\nto be proved. \r\n Because countries have the right, the \r\nresponsibility and the primary role to provide \r\nassistance and protection to their citizens, in \r\naccordance with resolution 46/182, the important role \r\nplayed by non-governmental and civil society \r\norganizations should be based on reinforcing national \r\nefforts and ensuring that assistance reaches those in \r\nneed. Such organizations, which provide for people’s \r\nurgent humanitarian needs, should not be exploited as a \r\nmeans of interfering in the internal affairs of countries \r\nor of imposing special agendas that focus attention on \r\ncertain groups and not on others. \r\n The events of the past few days — namely the \r\nSecurity Council’s failure to stop Israel’s attacks \r\nagainst the Palestinians, owing to the use of the veto — \r\nhave confirmed that there is an urgent need for an \r\neffective response to the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on assistance to the Palestinian people \r\n(A/61/80), which was submitted pursuant to resolution \r\n60/126. \r\n The tragic reality of Palestinian daily life under \r\nthe Israeli occupation, and Israel’s continued and \r\nincreasing violations of human rights, including its \r\nhindrance of organized international and regional \r\nefforts to alleviate the suffering of the Palestinian \r\npeople, require the General Assembly to take a firm \r\nstance, especially since recent events have shown that \r\nthe use of force — whether in Palestine or in \r\nLebanon — will not result in a settlement. Rather, it \r\nwill only worsen feelings of frustration and despair that \r\nfoster extremism and hatred, which we do not need. \r\n If we are to prevent a further deterioration in the \r\nquality of life inside the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritories, a further decline of the Palestinian economy \r\nand an increase in the economic, social and \r\nhumanitarian needs of the Palestinian population, the \r\nSecretary-General’s recommendation that significant \r\nfinancial assistance be provided by the international \r\ncommunity must be effectively implemented. \r\n If international support is to achieve the goal to \r\nwhich we aspire, United Nations agencies must be able \r\nto urgently and adequately meet the humanitarian \r\nneeds of the Palestinian people by strengthening \r\nexisting mechanisms. The role of the United Nations \r\nRelief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the \r\nNear East must therefore be supported; it should be \r\nable to play its proper role in the Palestinian territory. \r\nIsrael must respect the Agreement on Movement and \r\nAccess, which must be renewed, and all restrictions on \r\nthe movement of assistance organizations must be \r\nremoved. The Palestinian people must be allowed to \r\ninteract with the rest of the world and to receive \r\nhumanitarian assistance until our fundamental goal is \r\nachieved at the earliest opportunity through the \r\nestablishment of an independent Palestinian State, with \r\nJerusalem as its capital, as a result of negotiation, and \r\nnot through violence and humanitarian crises. \r\nA/61/PV.53  \r\n \r\n06-61363 10 \r\n \r\n We are looking forward to receiving the \r\nrecommendations of the Secretary-General in this \r\nregard. His report on assistance to the Palestinians \r\nended with a number of observations, without \r\npresenting any prospects for addressing the issue in \r\nfuture. We believe that that should be rectified \r\neffectively by the Secretariat in its future reports so \r\nthat the vision of the United Nations can interact with \r\nthe vision of Member States in order to end the \r\nsuffering of the Palestinian people under occupation. \r\n Mr. Skinner-Klée (Guatemala) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): We wish to thank the Secretary-General for \r\neach of the reports submitted under this agenda item, \r\nwhich I shall now discuss — particularly the report on \r\nstrengthening of the coordination of emergency \r\nhumanitarian assistance of the United Nations \r\n(A/61/85) and the report on international cooperation \r\non humanitarian assistance in the field of natural \r\ndisasters (A/61/314).  \r\n We also wish to highlight and express gratitude \r\nfor the efforts to strengthen the coordination of \r\nhumanitarian and relief assistance in cases of disaster \r\nby the United Nations and all countries that find \r\nthemselves in a constant struggle to reduce them. In \r\nthat connection, we commend the efforts of the Office \r\nfor the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and \r\nparticularly of its Under-Secretary-General, who has \r\nhad a very busy year full of important achievements, \r\nparticularly for Africa.  \r\n Emergency humanitarian assistance should begin \r\nwith risk reduction and preventive attention to persons \r\nwho live in conditions that make them vulnerable. We \r\nmust recognize the need to break the devastating \r\nvicious cycles of vulnerability that exact a constant toll \r\nin terms of human and material losses as well as \r\nenvironmental and social degradation. In order to put \r\nan end to those cycles, we agree with the idea of \r\nfocusing first on potential disaster hot spots and \r\nchannelling our efforts from a regional perspective so \r\nas to ensure a comprehensive, integrated and \r\nmultidimensional response over the long term. \r\n Guatemala, like the other countries of Central \r\nAmerica, is an obvious potential disaster hot spot that \r\nconstantly suffers from great vulnerability. We know \r\nthat from June to November, the region can be hit by \r\nhurricanes, storms, floods and mudslides; that from \r\nNovember to June, it can suffer from droughts and \r\nforest fires; and that throughout the year, it can be \r\nbeset by volcanic eruptions, earthquakes and tidal \r\nwaves. Our risk is of cataclysmic proportions. \r\n Thus, according to the Secretary-General’s report, \r\nlast year Guatemala was among the 10 most affected \r\ncountries in terms of both the number of persons killed \r\nby natural disasters and the number of those affected \r\nby such disasters. Sadly, within that group of countries, \r\nour country ranks fourth in terms of major economic \r\ndamage caused by natural disasters.  \r\n Under those circumstances, we agree that the \r\ncapacity of national and local responses must be \r\ndetermined before we can decide on which aspects \r\nneed to be strengthened and where. Guatemala has a \r\nnational coordinator for the reduction of natural or \r\nman-made disasters — an institution comprising \r\noffices and entities from the public and private sectors \r\nthat work together on risk management and mitigation. \r\nIt also works with other countries in the Central \r\nAmerican region, within the framework of the \r\nCoordination Centre for the Prevention of Natural \r\nDisasters in Central America, to pool efforts, experts \r\nand resources in order to face disasters more \r\neffectively.  \r\n With regard to the United Nations humanitarian \r\nassistance coordination system, we believe that, with \r\nthe establishment of the Central Emergency Response \r\nFund (CERF), we now have valuable elements at our \r\ndisposal that will not only permit greater predictability \r\nfor the financing of humanitarian emergency responses, \r\nbut will also contribute to humanitarian assistance \r\ndirected to specific needs — assistance that, we trust, \r\nwill be more rapid and effective. \r\n Likewise, we consider important and support the \r\nbroadening of engagement by interested actors, \r\nincluding those in the private sector, in the area of \r\nhumanitarian response. In that connection, we support \r\nthe idea of broadening engagement and coordination \r\nwith entities outside the United Nations and creating \r\nmore formal interaction structures that will make it \r\npossible to mount a coordinated response before and \r\nafter crises. We also believe that the cluster approach is \r\nan important opportunity to achieve greater \r\nparticipation by the international community.  \r\n Regarding the chronic financing deficit crisis, my \r\ndelegation believes that all disasters are of equal \r\nimportance and that they should not be assessed in \r\nterms of which country suffers the greatest number of \r\ndeaths or has the most damage or the broadest media \r\n A/61/PV.53\r\n \r\n11 06-61363 \r\n \r\ncoverage. That is why we support the Good \r\nHumanitarian Donorship initiative, as well as the \r\nSecretary-General’s recommendation that indicators be \r\nestablished for humanitarian assistance, in particular \r\nby setting minimum levels of assistance for \r\nbeneficiaries and long-term targets related to the \r\nMillennium Development Goals.  \r\n In that context, we take this opportunity to \r\nexpress our gratitude for the information provided by \r\nthe Secretary-General in the report contained in \r\ndocument A/61/85/Add.1 concerning the detailed use \r\nof CERF, which includes important conclusions \r\nregarding its first six months of operation. Like other \r\ndelegations, we urge that the pledges to the Fund \r\nbecome cash payments, because if CERF is to be a \r\nuseful tool, its funds must be replenished. We consider \r\ntimely the high-level donor conference for CERF, to be \r\nheld in early December this year. It will be a good \r\nopportunity to obtain additional pledges and \r\ncontributions for emergency response. \r\n Through many difficulties over the years, \r\nGuatemala has understood the importance of meeting \r\nthe special needs of vulnerable groups, whose fragility \r\nis worsened by the collapse of community and \r\ngovernmental structures. In that connection, we agree \r\nwith the Secretary-General on the need to pay special \r\nattention to the scourge of gender-based violence \r\ncommitted in humanitarian emergency situations. We \r\nreiterate once again our total and categorical rejection \r\nof that form of violence. That is why we support efforts \r\nto strengthen national institutions and to adopt \r\nmeasures providing greater protection, training and \r\neducation to the population to prevent upsurges in this \r\nkind of violence during humanitarian crises. Our \r\ninternational obligations, and the duty to protect human \r\nrights and the rule of law, compel us to punish such \r\nviolations against our vulnerable populations and to \r\nprovide appropriate support and offer minimum \r\nguarantees to surviving victims.  \r\n Guatemala also believes that the special attention \r\nthat must be given to particularities and cultural \r\nspecificities is crucial. In October 2005, the \r\ndevastating effects of tropical storm Stan were felt \r\nmainly in our indigenous communities. According to \r\nthe Secretary-General’s report, more than 670 persons \r\ndied, 844 were reported missing, 386 were injured and \r\nan estimated 475,000 were affected.  \r\n The community tradition of indigenous peoples is \r\na fundamental contribution both to the success of the \r\nmanagement of the humanitarian crisis assistance \r\nsystem and to efforts aimed at subsequent recovery, \r\nwhich necessarily depends on reconstruction of the \r\nsocial fabric. Therefore, we strongly support the notion \r\nthat humanitarian assistance must take into account the \r\ncultural specificities of each country, not only to \r\ncoordinate effective integration activities, but also to \r\nguard against the pernicious effects of the dislocation \r\nof populations and the resulting social chaos that \r\njeopardizes their traditions.  \r\n Another aspect to which we accord high priority \r\nis the incorporation of humanitarian components into \r\nthe initial mandate of integrated peacekeeping \r\nmissions. Our own experience has raised our awareness \r\nof that issue. We are a country that, during its transition \r\nfrom conflict to peace, suffered the consequences of \r\nnatural disasters, such as the powerful Hurricane \r\nMitch, which devastated Central America in 1998, only \r\ntwo years after the signing of the peace agreements in \r\nGuatemala. Thus, we support and recognize the \r\nusefulness of the efforts made thus far in the missions \r\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the \r\nSudan. We also urge that, despite the challenges ahead \r\nin the missions in Haiti and Côte d’Ivoire, we continue \r\nto carefully determine priorities and improve \r\ncoordination with humanitarian actors in the process of \r\nplanning integrated missions. \r\n We are therefore pleased with the importance the \r\nreport of the High-level Panel on System-wide \r\nCoherence gives to the Organization’s role in \r\nhumanitarian assistance and to its reform in order to \r\nensure a better response capacity. \r\n Finally, I wish briefly to refer to the tragic events \r\nin recent months in the Gaza Strip and in the West \r\nBank, as well as in Lebanon. The situation in the Gaza \r\nStrip is cause for particular concern. It is regrettable to \r\nsee the growing pace at which the situation continues \r\nto deteriorate. Israeli military operations, actions of \r\nPalestinian extremist groups and growing tension \r\nbetween Hamas and Fatah partisans are the main \r\nfactors in this deterioration. The humanitarian situation \r\nhas deteriorated further as a result of the extensive \r\ndestruction of civilian infrastructure in the territory. We \r\nstress that crossing points must remain open in order to \r\nallow for the entry of food, medicines and other \r\nimportant items, especially fuel. \r\nA/61/PV.53  \r\n \r\n06-61363 12 \r\n \r\n With regard to the humanitarian situation in \r\nLebanon, we appreciate the efforts made by OCHA and \r\nthe humanitarian agencies. The priority in the present \r\ncircumstances must be to guarantee access to the \r\naffected population in southern Lebanon and provide \r\nassistance to persons returning to their homes. We also \r\nwish to recall that the presence of many unexploded \r\nmunitions creates an additional challenge for these \r\noperations. \r\n We appeal to the donor community to respond \r\ngenerously to the humanitarian needs in the Gaza Strip \r\nand in Lebanon. \r\n Mr. Malmierca Díaz (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nUnfortunately, we continue to face the reality of a \r\nworld characterized by inequality and growing threats \r\nand obstacles to peace and development, where \r\nhumanitarian crises proliferate and where there is a \r\ncontinuing lack of will among those who can mobilize \r\nresources to alleviate the consequences of disasters. \r\n Nature’s fury does not distinguish between \r\ndeveloping and developed countries. Nevertheless, the \r\nconsequences of successive natural disasters in recent \r\nyears reveal, as never before, the serious crisis \r\nunderlying the international sustainable development \r\nagenda that we, the third world countries, are facing. \r\nThe peoples of the South continue to suffer the impact \r\nof conditions resulting from the current unjust \r\ninternational order, which undermines national \r\ncapacity to respond immediately to the huge challenges \r\nimposed by the effects of natural disasters. \r\n Therefore, it is essential that humanitarian \r\nassistance be accompanied by serious commitment, \r\nwithout conditions, to the economic growth and \r\nsustainable development of the developing nations. \r\nThere, contributions for humanitarian assistance should \r\nnot be predetermined and should not be made at the \r\nexpense of resources for international development \r\ncooperation. \r\n In an international system marked by unipolarity \r\nand the exercise of hegemony through the illegal “pre-\r\nemptive” use of armed force, Cuba reaffirms the \r\nvalidity of the principles of humanity, neutrality, \r\nimpartiality and independence, as enshrined in General \r\nAssembly resolution 46/182 and in successive \r\nAssembly resolutions. The principle of independence is \r\ncrucial. Humanitarian objectives should be divorced \r\nfrom political, economic, military or any other \r\nobjectives that any actor might have vis-à-vis areas in \r\nwhich humanitarian assistance operations are being \r\nimplemented. \r\n The present state of affairs requires that the \r\ntransition from relief to development capture the \r\ninterest that it deserves and that the international \r\ncommunity act diligently to enable those who are \r\nrecovering from the impact of natural disasters to \r\nresume their national plans for viable economic growth \r\nand to continue their progress towards sustainable \r\ndevelopment fostering the creation of the resources \r\nrequired for a long-term response to the disaster’s \r\nconsequences. \r\n In this regard, it is crucial to take steps to revive \r\nsocio-economic activity in affected communities. \r\nThese can include the following: the cancellation, \r\nsignificant relief or rescheduling of external debt, \r\ngiving the country a grace period that would help \r\naccelerate its relief, reconstruction and development \r\nefforts; the promotion of a coordinated effort involving \r\na variety of new and additional sources of financial \r\nresources for the affected nations, including the \r\ninternational financial organizations, especially the \r\nWorld Bank; and granting temporary facilities and \r\ntrade preferences for specific domestic products, in \r\nparticular those from the areas affected by the disaster. \r\nThis would aim at helping to rebuild productive \r\ncapacities and generate jobs. Other actions could be \r\nlaunched through UNICEF, UNESCO and other bodies, \r\nagencies, funds and programmes of the United Nations \r\nsystem in order to help children affected by disasters, \r\nespecially those who become orphans, thus \r\ncontributing to their physical and mental development. \r\n In this context, the increasing negative impact of \r\nnatural disasters demands the strengthening of national \r\nactivities related to prevention, mitigation and \r\nplanning, and the implementation of the outcome of the \r\nsecond World Conference on Disaster Reduction, held \r\nin Japan in January 2005. \r\n International cooperation mechanisms should be \r\nstrengthened. The experiences of recent years with the \r\nhurricanes that have hit the Caribbean basin, the Gulf \r\nof Mexico and Central America, as well as the natural \r\ndisasters suffered in Pakistan, Indonesia and other \r\nplaces, are proof of this. \r\n Giving assistance out of solidarity with those who \r\nneed it is one of the pillars of Cuba’s foreign policy, \r\nand our cooperation programme has continued \r\nthroughout the more than 40 years of our Revolution. \r\n A/61/PV.53\r\n \r\n13 06-61363 \r\n \r\nIn this spirit, Cuban doctors, teachers, engineers and \r\nother professionals and technicians have provided \r\nnoble services in several regions of our planet. After \r\nHurricane Katrina’s impact, the Henry Reeve \r\ninternational contingent of doctors specializing in \r\ndisaster situations and serious epidemics was formed \r\non 19 September 2005. Its members have provided \r\nassistance to people in many countries. They stand \r\nready to act not only in natural disasters, but also in \r\nother emergency situations that require assistance, such \r\nas epidemic outbreaks, and in the worldwide fight \r\nagainst HIV/AIDS. \r\n This is Cuba’s contribution: specialists and \r\nengineers ready to share the Cuban national experience \r\nin assistance work and emergency aid; doctors who \r\nwill save lives, ease the pain and fight outbreaks of \r\ndisease, providing essential health services to those \r\nwho have lost everything and who suffer the calamity \r\nof neglect. As their only reward, they take home the \r\nsatisfaction of a job well done and do not ask for the \r\nfrivolous fame offered by coverage in big transnational \r\nmedia. Nor, perhaps, will they receive any awards or \r\nprizes for their humanitarian conduct; that is not what \r\nthey seek. The appreciation of those persons whom \r\nthey cure and save will suffice. \r\n The selfless solidarity of Cuba, a small, \r\nblockaded third-world country, should serve as an \r\nexample to coax hugely rich States and international \r\nfinancial bodies into providing needed assistance to \r\nthose who suffer terribly at the hands of nature. It is \r\npossible. The suffering of the victims is in stark \r\ncontrast to the trillion dollars that are wasted in \r\nmilitary expenditures every year. \r\n We need permanent mobilization, a true spirit of \r\nhuman solidarity and a strong political commitment to \r\nsolve the underlying ills that feed the uncontrollable \r\nforces of natural disasters. As long as that is not \r\nachieved, the efforts by the Office for the Coordination \r\nof Humanitarian Assistance will be in vain. \r\n Mr. Ainchil (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): At \r\nthe outset, the delegation of Argentina would like to \r\nexpress its appreciation to the Secretary-General for \r\nthe relevant reports he has submitted under agenda \r\nitem 69. They constitute an excellent basis for our \r\ndeliberations today. \r\n Every year we are witnesses to the devastating \r\neffects of natural disasters that overwhelm the capacity \r\nof national authorities, showing the chronic \r\nvulnerability of a great number of developing \r\ncountries. Those disasters cause enormous human and \r\nmaterial losses, and their consequences will last, \r\nunfortunately, for a long time. \r\n At the same time, many of the humanitarian \r\ncrises that we face are not the result of natural events \r\nbeyond the control of Governments and communities, \r\nbut the consequence of the deliberate action of armed \r\ngroups, with or without governmental control, causing \r\nsuffering among civilian populations. \r\n The 2005 World Summit Outcome  (resolution \r\n60/1) recognized human rights as a pillar of the \r\nOrganization that should permeate all of its activities in \r\na crosscutting manner. It is from that rights-based \r\nperspective that places the individual at the centre of \r\nour concerns that Argentina supports the humanitarian \r\naction of the United Nations. In this regard we wish to \r\nexpress our appreciation to the Office for the \r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and the \r\nagencies of the United Nations system that every day, \r\nunder the most dangerous circumstances, provide \r\nhumanitarian assistance and protection to populations \r\naffected by emergencies. \r\n When speaking of the humanitarian activities of \r\nthe United Nations, we cannot fail to express our \r\nserious concern for the safety and security of \r\nhumanitarian personnel, including locally recruited \r\npersonnel. The Secretary-General’s report on this issue \r\n(A/61/463) indicates that humanitarian personnel \r\ncontinue to be killed or injured and are victims of \r\nhostage-taking, physical assault, rape and sexual \r\nassault, robbery, harassment and detention, and that the \r\nright of the United Nations to protect them is denied in \r\nviolation of agreed conventions. That is simply \r\nunacceptable.  \r\n Argentina once again condemns the criminal acts \r\nof violence of all kind suffered by humanitarian \r\npersonnel when performing their duty. We also express \r\nour sincere condolences to the families and friends of \r\nthose who have generously given their lives assisting \r\npeople in situations of extreme need. \r\n The delegation of Argentina is concerned by the \r\ncontinued lack of access of populations affected by \r\nemergencies, including refugees and internally \r\ndisplaced persons, to humanitarian assistance and \r\nprotection. As stated in Security Council resolution \r\n1674 (2006), parties to a conflict are urged to allow \r\nhumanitarian personnel full unimpeded access to \r\nA/61/PV.53  \r\n \r\n06-61363 14 \r\n \r\ncivilians, to make available all necessary facilities for \r\ntheir operations and to promote the safety, security and \r\nfreedom of movement of humanitarian personnel and \r\ntheir assets. \r\n Argentina firmly believes that, in the context of \r\nthe humanitarian action of the United Nations, special \r\npriority should be given to the situation of women, \r\nchildren and vulnerable groups, as they constitute the \r\nleast protected sectors in current humanitarian \r\nemergencies. \r\n In addition to the work of Member States and of \r\nthe United Nations system, we would like to stress the \r\nessential role played by other humanitarian actors in \r\nthe field, including non-governmental organizations. \r\nEfforts aimed at improving coordination mechanisms \r\nbetween the United Nations and those actors should be \r\ncontinued both at Headquarters and in the field, \r\nincluding on safety and security matters. \r\n Concerning the participation of civil society in \r\nhumanitarian action, Argentina continues to develop \r\nthe White Helmets Initiative, placing teams of \r\nspecialized volunteers, previously trained and on a \r\nstandby basis, at the disposal of the United Nations \r\nhumanitarian system. \r\n The desperate situation of displaced populations \r\nis not affected by the fact that those populations may or \r\nmay not have crossed an international border. In all \r\ncases, displaced populations are entitled to assistance \r\nand protection. Argentina would like to express its \r\nsupport to the work of OCHA and the United Nations \r\nagencies concerning internally displaced persons, \r\nbearing in mind the standards compiled in the United \r\nNations Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement. \r\nThe experience and capacity of the Office of the \r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is \r\nessential in this respect. \r\n The end of the last century brought to light again \r\nthe horrible realities of genocide, atrocities of war and \r\nmassive attacks against civilian populations. The \r\nSecurity Council has provided a legal framework on \r\nthe protection of civilians in armed conflicts through \r\nits resolutions 1265 (1999), 1296 (2000) and 1674 \r\n(2006). At the same time, new concepts have been \r\ndiscussed, questioning the idea of absolute sovereignty \r\nof the State with respect to horrifying criminal acts. \r\nArgentina participated in the formulation of those \r\nnorms and has repeatedly stated, in various forums, \r\nthat the principle of non-intervention in the internal \r\naffairs of States must be balanced by the principle of \r\nnon-indifference towards massive violations of human \r\nrights and humanitarian law.  \r\n In this respect, the General Assembly, in the 2005 \r\nWorld Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1), consolidated \r\nthe debate of the previous years through the adoption \r\nof the concept of responsibility to protect populations \r\nfrom genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and \r\ncrimes against humanity. In that important document, \r\nour leaders indicated their readiness to take collective \r\naction in a timely and decisive fashion, through the \r\nSecurity Council, against these grave situations. \r\n Finally, the Argentine delegation would like to \r\nthank Mr. Jan Egeland for his committed service to the \r\nUnited Nations as Emergency Relief Coordinator and \r\nto wish him the best in his future activities. \r\n Mr. Jenie (Indonesia): The Indonesian delegation \r\nwelcomes today’s meeting on strengthening of the \r\ncoordination of emergency humanitarian assistance of \r\nthe United Nations. My delegation wishes to express \r\nits appreciation for the reports on that subject \r\nsubmitted by the Secretary-General, which offer an \r\nanalysis and a set of recommendations to be considered \r\nby the General Assembly. \r\n It is indeed important to strengthen the present \r\nfoundation with a view to mobilizing an effective \r\ninternational response to humanitarian emergencies. At \r\nthe same time, our gathering here today should aim to \r\nmake communities safer as a global priority that goes \r\nfar beyond emergency relief. \r\n For obvious reasons, loss of life and destruction \r\nstrike a familiar chord in all of us, compelling us to \r\noffer an international humanitarian response to \r\nalleviate the suffering. However, we are all aware that \r\nafter the period of immediate emergency relief has \r\npassed there is a bigger and more arduous task ahead: \r\nnamely, to rebuild and bring normalcy back to the \r\naffected populations. \r\n Therefore, while Indonesia supports \r\nstrengthening the coordination of emergency \r\nhumanitarian assistance of the United Nations as an \r\nimportant first step in disaster response, we \r\nnevertheless have concerns regarding efforts beyond \r\nthat initial phase. My delegation therefore appreciates \r\nthe Secretary-General’s report entitled “International \r\ncooperation on humanitarian assistance in the field of \r\nnatural disasters, from relief to development” \r\n A/61/PV.53\r\n \r\n15 06-61363 \r\n \r\n(A/61/314). This report acknowledges the importance \r\nof the efforts of the United Nations and other \r\ninternational organizations in supporting disaster-\r\naffected countries as they make the transition from \r\nemergency to reconstruction. \r\n On this issue, coordination between national \r\nGovernments and United Nations agencies and \r\ninternational organizations is important to achieve \r\ngreater coherence and avoid duplication of \r\nprogrammes in order to ensure that the results are in \r\nline with the aspirations of the affected communities. \r\nMoreover, in the reconstruction phase, one of the \r\nbuilding blocks that will help countries and their \r\npopulations deal better with disasters is the \r\nenhancement of local, national and regional capacities \r\nfor disaster management. \r\n The international community must be able to \r\nrecognize that it plays a supporting role. We agree that \r\nstrengthening disaster risk management capacities not \r\nonly builds on technical strengthening, as pointed out \r\nby the Secretary-General, but requires the support of \r\ndonors and financing institutions as well. \r\n One of the funding sources for humanitarian \r\nassistance is the Central Emergency Response Fund \r\n(CERF) which was upgraded and launched this year. \r\nRecognizing that the sustainability of the Fund depends \r\non maintaining the political and financial thrust \r\ngenerated during its launching, Indonesia has \r\ncontributed a total of $50,000 to the Fund this year. \r\n In terms of the use of the Fund, in spite of its \r\nlimitations, Indonesia is confident that the appropriate \r\ndecisions and measures will be adopted, taking into \r\naccount the principles of neutrality, humanity and \r\nimpartiality, as outlined in General Assembly \r\nresolution 46/182 of 19 December 1991. \r\n With respect to the coordination of humanitarian \r\nassistance, it will be recalled that at one time the \r\nhumanitarian system consisted of only a few players. \r\nNow, many organizations with varying skills and \r\npriorities have a bearing on the delivery of \r\nhumanitarian assistance. In this regard, Indonesia \r\nagrees that strengthening coordination is crucial and \r\njoined other Member States last year in endorsing the \r\nimprovement of the humanitarian system. \r\n One of the areas requiring strengthening is the \r\ncapacity of the United Nations humanitarian system to \r\nidentify and fill gaps in critical humanitarian \r\nprogramme sectors. In this connection, the Emergency \r\nRelief Coordinator developed the cluster leadership \r\napproach as a means to develop a strong standing \r\nresponse capacity, more predictable and responsible \r\nleadership, greater effectiveness in aid delivery and \r\nimproved coordination.  \r\n While my delegation recognizes that the cluster \r\napproach is still in its early stages, it would seem \r\nbeneficial to determine whether or not it has \r\nstrengthened system-wide preparedness, technical \r\ncapacity at the global level and delivery of \r\nhumanitarian assistance at the country level. The \r\nsharing of lessons learned and best practices \r\naccumulated during the implementation of the cluster \r\napproach in the Pakistan earthquake response, as well \r\nas in some African countries, would certainly shed \r\nsome light on the ongoing process. \r\n Before concluding, allow me to touch on the \r\nSecretary-General’s report on international assistance \r\nto alleviate the suffering of the Palestinian people \r\n(A/61/80). We commend the work of the United \r\nNations in providing assistance to the Palestinian \r\npeople even in the most difficult of situations. In this \r\nregard, we urge the international donor community to \r\ncontinue its generous support. Ultimately, however, we \r\nmust rededicate ourselves to peace in the Middle East \r\nand to the creation of a viable and sovereign \r\nPalestinian State in accordance with relevant United \r\nNations resolutions, the Quartet Road Map and the \r\nArab Peace Initiative of 2002. \r\n Indonesia fully supports strengthening United \r\nNations capacity to coordinate humanitarian response. \r\nAt the same time, we must remember that it is the start \r\nof a much longer process which is equally important in \r\npriority.  \r\n Mr. Sardenberg (Brazil): I wish to express my \r\ndelegation’s appreciation for the continuous efforts of \r\nthe United Nations system in helping States to \r\nstrengthen capacities to prepare for and respond to \r\nemergencies and, in particular, for the leadership of the \r\nSecretary-General in this area. \r\n The participation of Brazil in humanitarian \r\nefforts is growing. An inter-ministerial working group \r\nfor international humanitarian assistance has recently \r\nbeen established by our Government, and the Brazilian \r\nCongress is currently conducting a comprehensive \r\nreview of national legislation on humanitarian matters. \r\nBrazil is actively engaged in the White Helmets \r\nA/61/PV.53  \r\n \r\n06-61363 16 \r\n \r\nInitiative and, within this framework, is working \r\nclosely with Argentina, the initiator of this process, and \r\nother countries of our region to build up partnerships \r\nwith the World Food Programme and the Organization \r\nof American States. \r\n Brazil has also delivered more humanitarian \r\nassistance, especially by donating food, medicines, \r\nmedication kits, blankets and shelter. In the last two \r\nyears, Brazil has pledged resources for the \r\nreconstruction of Lebanon and the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritories and contributed to the assistance of victims \r\nof the Asian tsunami, the South Asia earthquake and \r\nthe floods in Guyana, Ecuador and Suriname. \r\n I wish to highlight a few aspects of United \r\nNations humanitarian assistance that my delegation \r\ndeems essential at this stage. First, there is the need to \r\nstrengthen local, national and regional capacities, \r\nwhich are an essential element to the timely and \r\noptimal use of resources in preparing and responding \r\nto emergencies, as well as in supporting the resilience \r\nof societies in post-emergency situations. \r\n We concur with the Secretary-General’s report \r\n(A/61/85) in its assertion that improvements to the \r\nhumanitarian response system will work only if all \r\nrelevant actors are involved. In addition to national and \r\nlocal governments, representatives of civil society \r\nshould fully participate in all phases of the \r\ncoordination of humanitarian response. Our own \r\nexperience in situations following natural disasters \r\nconfirms that local communities and community-based \r\norganizations play an important role in humanitarian \r\nresponse. The inclusion of those actors in the \r\ncoordination efforts will render the response system \r\nmore effective as a whole. \r\n My delegation shares the concerns expressed on \r\nthe situation of displaced populations, especially in \r\ncomplex emergency situations. While it is encouraging \r\nto learn that the general trend is toward a decreasing \r\nnumber of refugees, the growing number of internally \r\ndisplaced persons continues to challenge efforts being \r\nmade in the humanitarian field. In certain cases, this \r\nproblem is made even more serious by the lack of \r\naccess of humanitarian personnel to those who need \r\nassistance. In several situations of armed conflict, a \r\ndeliberate denial of access is a powerful weapon \r\nagainst the civilian population, in flagrant violation of \r\ninternational humanitarian law. In other cases, the \r\ndenial of access may mask breaches of international \r\nhuman rights law and refugee law. \r\n The sovereign right of States to protect their own \r\npopulations should not be an excuse for the denial of \r\naccess of humanitarian personnel and the enjoyment of \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms by the \r\npopulations concerned. As the State is primarily \r\nresponsible for the protection of its citizens, it also has \r\nthe main responsibility of investigating and \r\nprosecuting violations of human rights in cases of \r\narmed conflict. \r\n Brazil is in solidarity with the work of \r\nhumanitarian personnel, who usually find themselves \r\nin situations of extreme risk when endeavouring to \r\nachieve their mandate. I take this opportunity to \r\ndeplore the persistent acts of violence against \r\nhumanitarian workers, which has resulted in 215 \r\nviolent incidents against United Nations personnel \r\nsince July last year, including 15 deaths. We fully agree \r\nwith the recommendation of the Secretary-General \r\nregarding the need for a stronger commitment by States \r\nto the protection of humanitarian personnel. \r\n One of the fundamental aspects of humanitarian \r\nassistance is that of transition from disaster to \r\ndevelopment. Brazil shares the increased concern about \r\nthe negative impacts of natural disasters and complex \r\nemergencies on the attainment of development goals, \r\nsince they are associated with displacement, \r\nagricultural and environmental damage, enduring \r\ncycles of poverty, destruction of infrastructure and the \r\nspread of disease, among other things. \r\n Building the capacity of national institutions \r\nshould be another main feature of United Nations \r\naction, with the aim of creating favourable conditions \r\nfor the development of sustained and nationally owned \r\nstrategies. But this is not all. \r\n In order to address the gap that exists from relief \r\nto rehabilitation and development, the various reports \r\nof the Secretary-General correctly underline the need \r\nto mobilize international cooperation from a \r\ncomprehensive perspective. Such a comprehensive \r\napproach should include a frank and straightforward \r\ndiscussion on climate change and its connection to \r\nnatural disasters. \r\n To conclude, I wish to draw attention to a matter \r\nthat permeates the discussion on humanitarian issues. \r\nThe prevailing dual model that places providers and \r\n A/61/PV.53\r\n \r\n17 06-61363 \r\n \r\nbeneficiaries of humanitarian assistance in separate \r\nfields needs to be reviewed. A balanced approach to the \r\nhumanitarian agenda must correct the misperception \r\nthat developing countries are only recipients of \r\nassistance and that assistance is assessed only in \r\nmonetary terms. \r\n Developing countries, particularly those in the \r\nneighbourhood of conflict-ridden areas, make a \r\nsubstantial contribution to humanitarian assistance \r\nprovided either through the United Nations or \r\nbilaterally. They usually absorb massive refugee flows \r\nand the highest economic and social costs of regional \r\nhumanitarian emergencies. They also contribute \r\nthrough human resources, training programmes and \r\nSouth-South cooperation, not to mention the supply of \r\nfood, clothes, drugs and vaccines. \r\n It follows that developing countries must be \r\ngiven an appropriate role in the humanitarian reform \r\nagenda and be assured of broader participation in \r\ndecision-making and policy supervision of \r\nhumanitarian affairs. One condition for such a \r\ndevelopment would be a substantial increase in the \r\ninvolvement of the relevant United Nations sector with \r\nthe countries of the South, in terms of promoting best \r\npractices and of helping to better identify available \r\noptions for cooperation in the field of humanitarian \r\nassistance. We in Brazil are ready to work together \r\nwith the United Nations in order to accomplish these \r\nends. \r\n Mr. Gonzalez Milla (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): First, we would like to \r\nthank the United Nations Office for the Coordination \r\nof Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) for the work done to \r\nstrengthen humanitarian assistance in the United \r\nNations. We thank the Secretary-General for the \r\nreports presented on this important matter and for his \r\nefforts, and we have taken note of the \r\nrecommendations. \r\n The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela attaches \r\ncrucial importance to the question of humanitarian \r\nassistance and disaster relief at the international level. \r\nWe must live on the basis of our experience. The \r\ncreation of the Simon Bolívar International \r\nHumanitarian Assistance Task Force, coordinated by \r\nthe National Directorate of Civil Protection and \r\nDisaster Management, under the Ministry of Interior \r\nand Justice, is clear proof of the cooperation and \r\nsolidarity of our country in this area. \r\n This cooperation is organized according to the \r\nthree stages of a disaster — namely, prevention, \r\nemergency assistance and reconstruction or \r\nrehabilitation of the impacted areas. Recently, \r\nVenezuela, within the regional framework of the Inter-\r\nAmerican Agency for Cooperation and Development of \r\nthe Organization of American States (OAS), offered \r\nexperts to provide training in the area of disaster \r\nprevention, in particular on the basis of our successful \r\nnational experience in this field. Also, the Strategic \r\nPlan for Partnership for Development of the \r\nOrganization of American States incorporated this \r\nquestion, on the initiative of our country, as part of its \r\nactivities. \r\n At the national level, we have coordinated risk \r\nreduction actions and activities and have devoted \r\nattention to various groups affected by adverse events. \r\nAt the international level, since 2005, we have \r\nsupported our brothers in Cuba, Jamaica, El Salvador, \r\nGuatemala and Guyana; and, in 2006, we have lent \r\nassistance to Ecuador, Suriname, Chile, Bolivia and \r\nLebanon. In the case of Suriname, a country that \r\nsuffered the greatest disaster in its recent history, \r\nassistance to this brother country was in two stages. \r\nOne was the emergency assistance stage, which \r\nincluded 14 tons of rice, grain, children’s clothing, \r\nmedicines; in the second stage, we sent 126 additional \r\ntons of cargo, with 33,000 gallons of fuel for ships, \r\naircraft and electric generators. Working in \r\ncoordination with the Government of that country, we \r\nsent some water pumps, based on the Government’s \r\ndamage assessment and the needs of the affected \r\npopulation that live mostly in indigenous villages. \r\nThey were of the Wayana and Trio tribes, near the \r\nborder with Brazil. \r\n In Bolivia, we also responded to the \r\nGovernment’s call to assist in an emergency caused by \r\nrains. We offered 24 experts in risk and disaster \r\nmanagement, all of them members of the Simon \r\nBolívar Humanitarian Task Force. We contributed 12.5 \r\ntons of non-perishable foods, blankets, carts, picks and \r\nshovels, in addition to a four-wheel-drive vehicle. This \r\nwas part of the first advance assistance to our brother \r\ncountry, aimed in particular at the populations in the \r\nnorth and south of the Bolivian alteplano and at other \r\nareas of the Department of La Paz, a region where 80 \r\nper cent of the families affected by these natural \r\ndisasters are found. \r\nA/61/PV.53  \r\n \r\n06-61363 18 \r\n \r\n Also, in Chile, at the request of the Government \r\nand based on the bonds of friendship and solidarity that \r\nunite us, the Venezuelan Government sent 34 tons of \r\ngoods, including medicines, foodstuffs, drinking water, \r\nrubble-removing machinery, among other things, to \r\nsupport the local authorities after the devastating rains \r\nthat affected that nearby country. \r\n In Ecuador, the Government of Venezuela sent 10 \r\ntonnes of goods to support the authorities of that \r\ncountry in caring for those affected by the floods \r\ncaused by heavy rains in February 2006, which \r\naffected 29,000 families, according to Ecuadorian \r\nauthorities. Donations were made in accordance with \r\nthe damage assessment, needs analysis and the \r\nrequirements of the Ministry of Social Welfare and the \r\nOrganization for Civil Protection of Ecuador. \r\n Similarly, in Lebanon, during the serious \r\nemergency that country faced as a result of armed \r\naction by Israel, Venezuela sent more than 20 tons of \r\nhumanitarian assistance, mainly foodstuffs, drinking \r\nwater and medicine, in an operation coordinated by the \r\nVenezuelan Foreign Ministry and the Lebanese \r\nauthorities. In Jamaica, representatives of the Simon \r\nBolívar assistance brigade, operating in Jamaica since \r\n2005, have been building more than 100 housing units \r\nin solidarity with Jamaican families affected by \r\nhurricane Ivan in 2004. \r\n In the framework of the training offered by the \r\nNational Organization of Civil Protection and Disaster \r\nManagement, 30 members of the Simon Bolívar \r\nHumanitarian Task Force, fire fighters and volunteer \r\norganizations received, over a two-week period, a \r\ncourse on first response in situations of massive \r\ndisasters. The course was given by expert consultants \r\nfrom the Swiss Cooperation for Development, and we \r\nthank Switzerland for this important contribution in \r\nstrengthening our national capacity in this field. \r\n The work of the Government of Venezuela is to \r\nlend necessary support to any country in the South \r\nAmerican continent needing assistance, as well as to \r\nany country that may need humanitarian assistance, \r\nespecially those populations where the attention of the \r\ninternational community has not been focused, but \r\nwhere disaster has repercussions, even though they \r\nmay be considered small-scale disasters. \r\n That is why the Venezuelan Government has \r\nestablished contacts within the framework of the  \r\nOAS — specifically with the sector dealing with \r\ncivilian protection and disaster management, which is \r\npart of the Department of Sustainable Development \r\nand included in the Inter-American Strategic Plan for \r\nPartnership for Development. These contacts will make \r\nit possible to help Venezuela participate in OAS \r\ninstitutions and to enable all countries of the continent \r\nto take advantage of experience in mitigating, \r\npreventing and combating natural disasters. We hope \r\nthat the OAS will adopt that successful experience in \r\nthe form of a pilot mechanism to help its members \r\nbenefit from that important experience.  \r\n In that context, we will take steps within the \r\nUnited Nations framework to ensure that the Simón \r\nBolívar Humanitarian Task Force is seen as an \r\nimportant component of the regional disaster response \r\nnetworks and that its experience in the Latin American \r\nand Caribbean region is taken into account by United \r\nNations disaster assessment and coordination teams in \r\nthe region.  \r\n Finally, the strength of our country in the \r\nhumanitarian area is grounded in the national \r\nConstitution and is a matter of State policy. It is clear \r\nthat natural phenomena and disasters affect everyone \r\nequally, all people, without class distinctions. The \r\nBolivarian Government is, therefore, prepared to offer \r\nsupport under any circumstances that may arise.  \r\n The Acting President: I now call upon the \r\nobserver of the Holy See.  \r\n Archbishop Migliore (Holy See): My delegation \r\nwould like to add its voice to the expressions of deep \r\nconcern about the destruction caused by recent man-\r\nmade and natural disasters. In every case, those \r\ndisasters have served to reaffirm the pre-eminent value \r\nof humanitarian law and the consequent duty to \r\nguarantee the right of affected civilians and refugees to \r\nhumanitarian aid. From hurricanes to earthquakes, \r\nfrom drought to war, the past year has shown that all \r\npeoples and countries are susceptible to the \r\ncatastrophic effects of disasters and that a coordinated \r\nemergency response is crucial in preventing the loss of \r\nlife, rehabilitating communities and establishing long-\r\nterm redevelopment strategies. \r\n That is why we believe that it remains vitally \r\nimportant to shed light on humanitarian situations that \r\nhave not received international headlines and remain \r\ncritically underfunded. We welcome efforts to highlight \r\nsuch forgotten crises and efforts to secure funds for \r\nessential life-saving activities. \r\n A/61/PV.53\r\n \r\n19 06-61363 \r\n \r\n As is well known, the Holy See, through the \r\nPontifical Council Cor Unum and organizations such as \r\nCaritas Internationalis, is active in non-partisan \r\nhumanitarian assistance in every corner of the globe. \r\nAs demonstrated by the 2004 tsunami, the 2005 \r\nPakistan earthquake and the hurricane season of the \r\nsame year, concern for our neighbours transcends the \r\nboundaries of national communities and has \r\nincreasingly broadened its horizons to the whole world. \r\n The chambers of this House have been the scene \r\nof many discussions about the various aspects of \r\nglobalization. But if that phenomenon has one \r\nparticularly positive aspect, it is its potential to marshal \r\nan array of means for the delivery of humanitarian \r\nassistance. The welcome and growing globalized \r\nresponse to humanitarian emergencies requires \r\ncoordination that carefully balances efficiency with \r\nrespect for the autonomy of the various humanitarian \r\nactors. \r\n To that end, there remains little doubt that \r\ncoordination of relief activities in emergency situations \r\nis essential and that the United Nations should play a \r\ncoordinating role. However, it is not the principle of \r\ncoordination, but its modalities, that need to be \r\nconstructively adapted to meet the needs of all people \r\nand all agencies. Humanitarian organizations have \r\nspecific characteristics, qualifications and empathies \r\nthat they bring to their work, which, in view of the \r\ncumulative goal before us, we would do well to \r\nrespect. Coordinators should play a fundamental role in \r\nthe collection and dissemination of information, in \r\ncreating contacts with local authorities and in giving \r\nadvice to humanitarian organizations.  \r\n Further, collaboration between coordinators and \r\nhumanitarian agencies is important in order to \r\nformulate agreements and policies that respect the \r\nspecificities and mandates of the humanitarian \r\nagencies, while allowing them to continue to operate \r\nconstructively within a given set of circumstances. \r\n A set of criteria appears to be required in order to \r\ncreate fully comprehensive and respectful cooperation. \r\nFirst, any coordinating system must respect the \r\nindependence and autonomy of humanitarian \r\norganizations. Secondly, the coordinating body must \r\nnot simply favour large humanitarian organizations, but \r\nshould also allow competent medium-sized and small \r\norganizations to have a legitimate role in relief. \r\nThirdly, United Nations bodies must not detract from \r\nthe ability of non-governmental organizations to act — \r\nespecially those well acquainted with the peoples in \r\nquestion and their needs — or from their effectiveness \r\nin the field. Those principles could help to ensure that \r\na multifaceted response to humanitarian crises remains \r\navailable in all disaster areas. \r\n In the area of funding, the recent establishment of \r\nthe grant facility of the Central Emergency Response \r\nFund (CERF) promises to be an important element in \r\nensuring that reliable emergency relief funds are \r\navailable upon short notice. It is to be hoped that the \r\nEmergency Relief Coordinator will harmonize CERF’s \r\nactivities with those of other intergovernmental and \r\nnon-governmental emergency relief funds in order to \r\nallow for the effective employment of resources. \r\nFurther, large relief funds, such as CERF, should not \r\nlimit the ability of civil society and faith-based \r\nhumanitarian relief organizations to attract private and \r\ngovernmental donations. \r\n The Holy See looks forward to participating \r\nactively in the debate on this very important question, \r\nbecause it is through the exchange of ideas and best \r\npractices that the most effective means to alleviate \r\nsuffering and rebuild communities can and must be \r\nfound. \r\n The Acting President: In accordance with \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 47/4 of 16 October 1992, \r\nI now call on the observer of the International \r\nOrganization for Migration. \r\n Mr. Dall’Oglio (International Organization for \r\nMigration): The International Organization for \r\nMigration (IOM) welcomes the opportunity to address \r\nthe General Assembly and to share its views on the \r\nstrengthening of the coordination of humanitarian and \r\ndisaster relief assistance. That is a topic intrinsically \r\ncharacterized by collaboration and partnership with a \r\nbroad range of humanitarian actors, particularly in the \r\nareas most relevant for IOM’s operational work: the \r\nsituation of population displacement and sudden \r\npopulation movements.  \r\n The reports of the Secretary-General that have \r\nbeen prepared for this session of the General Assembly \r\noffer a valuable opportunity to take stock of progress \r\nmade and to draw lessons for the future with respect to \r\nnew modalities for working together. In addition, the \r\nrecommendations of the Advisory Group for the \r\nCentral Emergency Response Fund (CERF) provide \r\nA/61/PV.53  \r\n \r\n06-61363 20 \r\n \r\nimportant insights into the predictability and \r\neffectiveness of the humanitarian response. \r\n It is with a sense of guarded optimism that IOM \r\nrecognizes that 2006 has been a year of implementation \r\nof the humanitarian reform agenda in all its sectors: \r\nimprovement of operational response coordination, \r\nmore predictable funding and the devolution of certain \r\nresponses to the field. IOM has played its part in that \r\nreform process, assuming responsibilities for cluster \r\nperformance, engaging in and benefiting from CERF \r\nand ensuring that relevant expertise is planned and \r\nmobilized to benefit the humanitarian coordination \r\nsystem in the field. \r\n Inter-agency collaboration in the implementation \r\nof the cluster approach within the Inter-Agency \r\nStanding Committee is already giving us preliminary \r\nindications of the opportunities that lie ahead for \r\nimproved coordination and coherence if this approach \r\nis followed consistently by all partners. \r\n In order, for instance, to increase effectiveness \r\nand exploit synergies, and as cluster lead for camp \r\ncoordination and camp management in natural \r\ndisasters, the IOM has agreed with the Office of the \r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees — \r\nthe lead agency for camp coordination and camp \r\nmanagement for conflict-induced internally displaced \r\npersons (IDPs) — on a unified cluster approach at the \r\nglobal level for both natural-disaster and conflict-\r\ninduced IDPs. This unified approach avoids \r\nduplication, while recognizing the primary \r\nresponsibility each agency has for its respective areas. \r\n Now, more than a year into the cluster approach, \r\nwe are able to see some tangible results. In the spirit of \r\nthe unified cluster, the IOM and UNHCR are \r\nperforming the functions of a virtual secretariat, \r\nsupporting the shared objectives of this cluster. An \r\nincrease in external emergency networks is also taking \r\nplace, to include those actors with experience and \r\ninterest in disaster response. An example of this is the \r\ncreation of a cluster working group for both members \r\nand non-members of the Inter-Agency Standing \r\nCommittee that holds joint workshops and training in \r\norder to create a pool of qualified staff readily \r\ndeployable at the onset of an emergency and \r\nfacilitating increased participation of non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, a key requirement for \r\nstrengthening operational capacities. \r\n Similarly, close coordination with the \r\nInternational Federation of Red Cross and Red \r\nCrescent Societies, conveners for shelter responses in \r\nnatural disasters, is necessary for ensuring that issues \r\ncommon to both shelter and camp management and \r\ncamp coordination are addressed. In sum, the \r\naforementioned example amply demonstrates that, \r\nwhile still in its infancy stage, the cluster approach has \r\nprovided a more collaborative inter-agency framework, \r\nstimulating a more responsive, timely and effective \r\nmechanism, both at the global and country levels. \r\nIncreased interoperability, stronger preparedness and \r\nbetter-integrated training have more systematically \r\nbrought organizations and their staff together to \r\naddress common challenges and to foster a shared \r\nenvironment. \r\n The IOM stresses that inter-agency coordination, \r\nhowever, must not hinder the response or eclipse the \r\nkey role of national partners. In the final analysis, the \r\nrelevance of the cluster approach will be decided by its \r\ncapacity to add value to national responses, at all \r\nstages of an emergency, including in the assessment \r\nprocess. \r\n The IOM would also like to put on record its \r\nsatisfaction concerning the evolution of the Central \r\nEmergency Response Fund (CERF). In its short period \r\nof operation, the IOM has witnessed a greatly \r\nimproved turn-around time for application, thus \r\nleading to immediate improvement of response \r\ncapacity at the field level. Within its rapid response \r\nwindow, the CERF has been instrumental in IOM’s \r\nrelief activities in Côte d’Ivoire, Sri Lanka and Timor \r\nLeste, while the under-funded emergency window has \r\nsupported important humanitarian projects in Haiti, the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and Zimbabwe. \r\n The CERF can aid organizations such as the IOM \r\nconsiderably in shortening funding gaps in response to \r\nserious humanitarian crises. The IOM trusts that the \r\ninternational donor community, including non-\r\ntraditional donors, will appreciate the significance of \r\nthis new mechanism and will help meet the funding \r\ntarget established in the relevant resolution. \r\n Finally, we could not conclude these remarks \r\nwithout expressing the organization’s appreciation for \r\nthe dedication and commitment of the Emergency \r\nRelief Coordinator, who used his tenure to the fullest, \r\ninspiring public opinion, guiding and prioritizing the \r\ninternational community’s response and leading the \r\n A/61/PV.53\r\n \r\n21 06-61363 \r\n \r\nreform process. To Mr. Jan Egeland and his team at the \r\nUnited Nations Office for the Coordination of \r\nHumanitarian Affairs, the IOM renews its commitment \r\nto a most valuable partnership. \r\n The Acting President: In accordance with \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 49/2 of 19 October 1994, \r\nI call on the observer of the International Federation of \r\nRed Cross and Red Crescent Societies. \r\n Ms. Johnson (International Federation of Red \r\nCross and Red Crescent Societies): I welcome this \r\nopportunity to address the General Assembly, on behalf \r\nof the International Federation of Red Cross and Red \r\nCrescent Societies, in this very important debate on \r\nhumanitarian coordination. \r\n We know that the number of disasters resulting \r\nfrom natural hazards is rising, along with the number \r\nof organizations providing response. The need for \r\nstrong coordination is clear. With this in mind, and \r\ndrawing on our eight decades of experience in disaster \r\nmanagement, I would like to touch on four essential \r\nconditions for effective coordination. \r\n First, effective coordination requires a thorough \r\nunderstanding by all parties of our specific mandates \r\nand our capacities. There is a wide range of \r\norganizations active in humanitarian action, each with \r\nits own areas of expertise and modes of operation. Last \r\nJuly, a historic meeting took place in Geneva, bringing \r\ntogether 40 leaders from the three pillars of \r\nhumanitarian action: the United Nations, the non-\r\ngovernmental organization community and the Red \r\nCross and Red Crescent Movement, which includes the \r\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross, as well as \r\nthe International Federation and our 185 members. At \r\nthat meeting, which launched the Global Humanitarian \r\nPlatform, the leaders of these three pillars recognized \r\nthe particularities of one another’s organizations and \r\nagreed to work together as equal partners with \r\ncomplementary roles. The discussions affirmed the \r\nuniqueness of the Red Cross movement and of the Red \r\nCross and Red Crescent societies. Our national \r\nsocieties are an important bridge between local and \r\nnational levels. On the one hand, we mobilize \r\nvolunteers in thousands of communities around the \r\nworld; on the other, we have special auxiliary status \r\nwhich is recognized by national Governments. \r\n At the same time, we are bound by the Red Cross \r\nmovement’s fundamental principles. Here, I would like \r\nto underline, in particular, the importance of \r\nindependence and neutrality as cornerstones of \r\neffective Red Cross/Red Crescent action. \r\n The second essential condition for effective \r\ncoordination is a clear definition of responsibilities. \r\nThe International Federation welcomes and supports \r\nthe reform initiative launched by Jan Egeland, the \r\nEmergency Relief Coordinator, and the drive for more \r\neffective and better coordinated humanitarian response. \r\nWe are active participants in the meetings of the Inter-\r\nAgency Standing Committee, and we are well placed to \r\ncontribute to the outcomes of humanitarian reforms at \r\nthe global level, along with other leading humanitarian \r\nactors. We are optimistic that, with clear and inclusive \r\nleadership, the new coordination mechanisms — the \r\nclusters — can make a real difference, improving the \r\nspeed and effectiveness of emergency response. \r\n It is based on this belief that we have offered to \r\nplay a global leadership role in emergency shelter in \r\nnatural disasters. This special role has been clarified by \r\na memorandum of understanding signed by the \r\nInternational Federation and the United Nations Office \r\nfor the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) \r\nin September of this year. The memorandum sets out \r\nour willingness to take on this role, while remaining \r\nloyal to our fundamental principles of independence \r\nand neutrality by working alongside, but not as part of, \r\nthe United Nations system. \r\n The third essential condition for effective \r\ncoordination, in our view, is the participation of \r\nnational authorities and local communities. It is our \r\nexperience that, to be effective, natural disaster \r\nmanagement must be owned at both national and local \r\nlevels. National Governments are, first and foremost, \r\nresponsible for preparing and assisting their people to \r\nface natural disasters. Red Cross and Red Crescent \r\nsocieties are identified by national legislation as \r\nauxiliary to their public authorities. \r\n We call on Governments to recognize and more \r\neffectively integrate the contributions of national \r\nSocieties in national contingency planning processes. \r\nLocal response capacity must be recognized and \r\nsupported, for it is key to the success of nationally led \r\ndisaster management efforts. Friends and neighbours \r\nare always the first to respond in a crisis. Our \r\nexperience at the community level shows that the \r\ninvestment in local capacity — for instance, in well-\r\ntrained volunteers — pays off. By investing in local \r\ncommunity capacity, we can greatly reduce suffering, \r\nA/61/PV.53  \r\n \r\n06-61363 22 \r\n \r\nwe can speed recovery, and we can smooth the return \r\nto sustainable livelihoods. \r\n We believe that the fourth essential condition for \r\neffective coordination is a holistic approach integrating \r\npreparedness, response, recovery and risk reduction. \r\nThe importance we attribute to disaster risk reduction \r\nis highlighted in our Global Agenda, which calls for \r\nincreased action with vulnerable communities to \r\nreduce disaster risk. It is also highlighted in our efforts \r\nto help States meet the objectives of the Hyogo \r\nFramework for Action and to strengthen the \r\nInternational Strategy for Disaster Reduction system. \r\n While seeking to ensure that every country has \r\nthe capacity to respond to its own needs, we also work \r\nto build the legal preparedness of the international \r\ncommunity of States through our programme on \r\ninternational disaster response laws, rules and \r\nprinciples (IDRL). IDRL was recently discussed in the \r\nSixth Committee and received positive recognition \r\nfrom many Governments. It will be a significant item \r\non the agenda of the November 2007 International \r\nConference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent. \r\n The International Federation’s own ability to \r\nprepare for disasters requires the long-term \r\ncommitment of donors for predictable funding. Since \r\n1985, our own Disaster Response Emergency Fund \r\n(DREF) has provided emergency funding for \r\nimmediate disaster response before an international \r\nappeal is launched by the International Federation. The \r\nFund has also enabled us to fund smaller response \r\noperations for those many disasters that do not make \r\nthe headlines in the international press. We have \r\ntherefore followed closely the development of the \r\nCentral Emergency Response Fund (CERF), and \r\nwelcomed its expansion. However, we would like to \r\ntake this opportunity to remind Governments that the \r\nRed Cross Movement does not access CERF funding \r\nand that, in order to support effective and fast \r\nhumanitarian action in a broader range of crises, it is of \r\ncritical importance to support Red Cross facilities, such \r\nas DREF. \r\n In closing, I would like to remind the Assembly \r\nthat there are thousands upon thousands of Red Cross \r\nand Red Crescent volunteers throughout the world on \r\nthe front lines, responding to terrible disasters, day in \r\nand day out. The effective coordination of international \r\nsupport for those volunteers, for their neighbours and \r\nfor their local and national Governments is an \r\nimperative for all international humanitarian \r\norganizations. The International Federation will \r\ncontinue to do all it can to deliver better coordinated \r\nand more effective humanitarian action, and we are \r\ndedicated to working with all institutions that share \r\nthat commitment. \r\n The Acting President: In accordance with \r\nresolution 48/265 of 24 August 1994, I now call upon \r\nthe Observer for the Sovereign Military Order of \r\nMalta. \r\n Mr. Shafer (Sovereign Military Order of Malta): \r\nAllow me first of all to express my sincere thanks, on \r\nbehalf on the Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of \r\nMalta, for the opportunity to take the floor and present \r\nthe views of the Order on strengthening the \r\ncoordination of humanitarian disaster assistance of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n The past year was marked by an 18 per cent rise \r\nin the number of large-scale disasters, affecting 157 \r\nmillion people. The overall trends suggest that \r\ntragedies are becoming more frequent. The Order is \r\ntherefore very pleased to see that the Central \r\nEmergency Response Fund (CERF) has made great \r\nprogress towards its objective of improving field-level \r\ncoordination and further strengthening the \r\nhumanitarian response in under-funded crises. \r\n The Order of Malta fully recognizes the need for \r\ncoordination in the field and the pre-eminent role that \r\nmechanisms like the CERF and United Nations \r\nagencies can play in this respect. However, the Order \r\nbelieves that the management and funding should not \r\nbe overly centralized. \r\n The Order works actively in partnership with \r\nUnited Nations agencies, States and local and \r\ninternational non-governmental organizations to further \r\nstrengthen a synchronized response to all humanitarian \r\nchallenges. One example is the Sudan, where the Order \r\nhas been active since 1998 and has assisted over \r\n630,000 Sudanese people in basic health care.  \r\n In Darfur, the Order ensures health care for over \r\n115,000 people and, with the collaboration of UNICEF \r\nand the World Health Organization (WHO), has \r\nvaccinated more than 16,000 people against polio. The \r\nOrder offers medical assistance to pregnant women, \r\ntreats children and combats cholera and malaria. It is \r\ncommitted to providing aid to the most isolated and \r\nvulnerable communities.  \r\n A/61/PV.53\r\n \r\n23 06-61363 \r\n \r\n In the region of Wadah, in northern Sudan, where \r\nmedical services had not been available for more than \r\nthree years, the Order is now providing these services \r\nto more than 30,000 people — again in collaboration \r\nwith UNICEF and WHO. On average, about 6,000 \r\npatients in this country alone are treated each month in \r\nthe numerous hospitals of the Order. Together with its \r\nwork in northern Sudan, the Order of Malta continues \r\nto develop its long-term health-care services in \r\nsouthern Sudan, where the focus is on combating \r\ntuberculosis, leprosy and sleeping sickness. \r\n The Order has more than 80,000 dedicated \r\nvolunteers, who work in 120 countries to provide \r\nemergency relief to victims of natural disasters and \r\nthose affected by war and lethal epidemics.  \r\n In the case of an emergency situation, it is \r\nimperative for humanitarian assistance not only to \r\nprovide immediate relief to victims, but to develop \r\ncomprehensive long-term support systems. The Order \r\nis convinced of that, and has demonstrated its ability to \r\nbroaden its role from immediate relief to long-term \r\ndevelopment in many areas. In northern Pakistan, the \r\nOrder had personnel on the ground in the first days \r\nfollowing the devastating earthquake. It collaborated \r\nwith other organizations and the local community to \r\nprovide medical care, water and vital goods for the \r\nsurvivors. Once the emergency needs had been met, the \r\nOrder shifted its activities towards sustainable \r\nrehabilitation.  \r\n The Order always strives to accomplish two goals \r\nin the execution of its humanitarian work. First, it \r\nseeks to place local non-governmental organizations at \r\nthe centre of the relief effort and the training of local \r\nstaff at the core of many of its projects. \r\n Secondly, the Order strongly believes that a long-\r\nterm commitment is necessary so as to have a lasting \r\nimpact on the community. This is exemplified in our \r\nsupport in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \r\nwhere the Order has been active for more than 10 \r\nyears. The Order closely collaborates with 300 locally \r\nrun health-care facilities there, providing them with \r\nmedicine and medical equipment. As a result, more \r\nthan 900,000 people in the province of Kivu, and \r\nnearly 2 million people in Ituri, have access to primary \r\nhealth care. \r\n The United Nations has taken significant \r\nmeasures to improve the safety and security of \r\nhumanitarian aid workers, but they continue to be \r\nvictims of physical attacks, threats and robberies. They \r\nare often the first to respond to a crisis in the most \r\nunsafe regions, and the last to remain, long after \r\nfinancial resources ebb away. The Order stands with \r\nthe Secretary-General in his appeal to Member States \r\nto fulfil their obligations to ensure the safety of all \r\nhumanitarian aid workers. It is only with the full \r\ncommitment and cooperation of all Member States that \r\nmeaningful steps to enhance security for humanitarian \r\nworkers can be achieved. \r\n Regarding agenda item 69, sub-item (d), \r\n“Assistance to the Palestinian people”, may I say that \r\nthe Order remains dedicated to the development of a \r\nsustainable health system for the Palestinian people. \r\nThe Order of Malta has, for 16 years, operated the \r\nHoly Family Hospital of Bethlehem-Palestine — a \r\nmaternity hospital on whose board my wife serves — \r\nwhere more than 36,000 healthy children have been \r\ndelivered. Those works are carried out despite the fact \r\nthat the hospital has been besieged and damaged as a \r\nconsequence of the violence — violence that \r\ncontinues — in the area. \r\n The humanitarian principles, neutrality, \r\nimpartiality and independence of the Order of Malta \r\nprovide the credentials for it to continue the delivery \r\nand to improve the effectiveness of the provision of \r\nhumanitarian relief and development. Allow me to \r\nassure the Assembly that the Order is responding daily \r\nto the challenges that humanitarian work presents, and \r\nwe will continue to closely follow the leadership and \r\ninitiatives of the United Nations and its agencies. \r\n The Acting President: In accordance with \r\nGeneral Assembly 45/6 of 16 October 1990, I now call \r\non the observer of the International Committee of the \r\nRed Cross. \r\n Mr. Buff (International Committee of the Red \r\nCross): It is a great pleasure for me to speak today, on \r\nbehalf of the International Committee of the Red Cross \r\n(ICRC), about the essential issue of humanitarian \r\ncoordination. \r\n During the past year, the ICRC engaged once \r\nagain in wide-ranging and intensive humanitarian \r\nactivities owing to diverse situations of armed conflict \r\nand internal violence. In some 80 countries in which it \r\nis active, the ICRC’s absolute priority is to maintain \r\nand strengthen its ability to reach and help those who \r\nare affected. \r\nA/61/PV.53  \r\n \r\n06-61363 24 \r\n \r\n During the same year, the United Nations \r\nhumanitarian system began to implement changes \r\naimed at fundamentally improving its international \r\nresponse to humanitarian crises. The ICRC was \r\ninvolved in the discussion on United Nations \r\nhumanitarian reforms because, although those reforms \r\nare primarily a matter for the United Nations, they \r\nhave implications for humanitarian organizations \r\noutside the United Nations system. \r\n The ICRC resolutely supports the main reforms \r\nof the United Nations humanitarian system and sees a \r\nnumber of potential benefits in those efforts. An \r\nimproved and strengthened response capacity within \r\nthe United Nations, including clearer lead \r\nresponsibilities, will make possible a more efficient \r\nand more reliable humanitarian response where it \r\ncounts most — in the field — for people affected by \r\ndisaster or armed conflict. The ICRC will continue to \r\nparticipate and cooperate with the United Nations \r\nsystem to an extent that corresponds with the ICRC’s \r\nresponsibility to act at all times as a neutral and \r\nindependent intermediary and that enables the ICRC to \r\ncarry out strictly and exclusively humanitarian \r\nactivities. \r\n This year saw the implementation of the United \r\nNations cluster approach. The ICRC, in its task of \r\nmeeting the needs of affected populations in a holistic \r\nway, cannot be governed by that approach. Indeed, \r\nassistance and protection are interlocking aspects of its \r\noperations and are provided simultaneously, because \r\nneeds cannot be strictly divided into categories or \r\nsectors. At the same time, the ICRC firmly believes in \r\na diversity of approaches, so that various agencies can \r\nact according to their respective mandates and \r\nstrengths and can provide an effective presence where \r\nit is needed and a capacity to deliver in order to \r\nachieve the best possible results. \r\n For that reason, effective coordination between \r\nthe ICRC and the United Nations humanitarian system \r\nis taking place where it is necessary in order to achieve \r\nefficient operational complementarity and a \r\nstrengthened response for people in need of protection \r\nand assistance. For example, when the cluster approach \r\nwas implemented in Pakistan, Liberia, the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, Uganda, Somalia and Lebanon, \r\nICRC delegations were already operational in all those \r\ncontexts and participated in a constructive manner in \r\nthe numerous cluster meetings, while at the same time \r\nrespecting the ICRC’s principles of neutrality and \r\nindependence. \r\n The ICRC’s natural partners in the humanitarian \r\ncommunity are, first and foremost, the other \r\ncomponents of the International Red Cross and Red \r\nCrescent Movement: the International Federation and \r\nits member national societies, particularly in the \r\ncountries where the ICRC operates. In emergencies, the \r\nnational societies are the local capacity of the \r\nInternational Movement. They are usually the first \r\nresponders and, as such, are the first to provide critical \r\nlife-saving activities. The national societies remain the \r\nICRC’s primary partners in operations, and whenever \r\npossible — for example, recently in Lebanon — they \r\nare fully supported and resourced to deliver vital front-\r\nline emergency medical services. \r\n Thus, the ICRC’s first priority with regard to \r\nhumanitarian coordination is to invest in the national \r\nsocieties of countries where it operates. By supporting \r\nand developing their local capacities and improving \r\ncoordination in emergency situations, the ICRC is \r\ndetermined to reinforce the response of the \r\nInternational Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. \r\n In conclusion, the ICRC renews its commitment \r\nto work in the best interests of the victims of armed \r\nconflicts and other situations of violence. Its goal is to \r\navoid duplication and to ensure a comprehensive \r\nhumanitarian response without gaps. In doing so, the \r\nICRC must act in accordance with the mandate \r\nentrusted to it by the 194 States parties to the Geneva \r\nConventions of 1949. At the same time, the ICRC \r\nrecognizes that it cannot meet by itself all the specific \r\nneeds of victims, and it does not claim to be able to do \r\nthis. For that reason, it is the ICRC’s conviction that \r\nvarious approaches to humanitarian coordination must \r\nbe considered. That represents our greatest chance to \r\nmeet the expectations that suffering populations are \r\nentitled to have of the international humanitarian \r\ncommunity. \r\n The Acting President: The General Assembly \r\nhas thus concluded this stage of its consideration of \r\nagenda item 69 and its sub-items (a) and (b).  \r\n  The meeting rose at 5.35 p.m. \r\n"
