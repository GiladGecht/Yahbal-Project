(Bahrain) \r\n \r\n \r\n The meeting was called to order at 3.20 p.m. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 106 (continued) \r\n \r\nAppointments to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs \r\nand other appointments \r\n \r\n (h) Appointment of members of the Joint \r\nInspection Unit \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/61/109) \r\n \r\n The President: As indicated in document \r\nA/61/109, the General Assembly is required, during the \r\nsixty-first session, to appoint five members to fill the \r\nvacancies in the Joint Inspection Unit that will arise \r\nfrom the expiration of the term of office, on \r\n31 December 2007, of Mr. Even Fontaine Ortiz of \r\nCuba, Mr. Tang Guanging of China, Mr. Victor Vislykh \r\nof the Russian Federation, Ms. Deborah Wynes of the \r\nUnited States of America and Mr. Muhammad Yussuf \r\nof the United Republic of Tanzania. \r\n As is also indicated in document A/61/109, in \r\naccordance with article 3, paragraph 1, of the Statute of \r\nthe Joint Inspection Unit, the President of the General \r\nAssembly shall consult with Member States to draw up \r\na list of countries — in this case, five countries — that \r\nwould be requested to propose a candidate for \r\nappointment to the Joint Inspection Unit. \r\n After holding the necessary consultations with \r\nthe regional groups, I should like to communicate to \r\nthe Assembly the following information that I have \r\nreceived from the Chairmen of the regional groups. \r\n For the single seat from among the Group of \r\nAfrican States, there are three candidates, namely, \r\nEgypt, the Sudan and the United Republic of Tanzania. \r\n For the single seat from among the Group of \r\nAsian States, the Group has endorsed China. \r\n For the single seat from among the Group of \r\nEastern European States, the group has endorsed the \r\nRussian Federation. \r\n For the single seat from among the Group of \r\nLatin American and Caribbean States, the Group has \r\nendorsed Cuba. \r\n For the single seat from among the Group of \r\nWestern European and other States, the Group has \r\nendorsed the United States of America. \r\n As the Groups of Asian States, Eastern European \r\nStates, Latin American and Caribbean States and \r\nWestern European and other States have each endorsed \r\none candidate for one vacancy — namely, China, the \r\nRussian Federation, Cuba and the United States of \r\nAmerica, respectively — those four countries will be \r\nrequested to propose a candidate each for appointment \r\nto the Joint Inspection Unit. \r\n Since there are three candidacies from among the \r\nAfrican States for one vacancy, I should like, in \r\naccordance with past practice, to consult with Member \r\nStates through the procedure of holding an advisory \r\nvote by secret ballot to select one country from among \r\nthe African States to be requested to propose a \r\ncandidate for appointment to the Joint Inspection Unit. \r\nA/61/PV.55  \r\n \r\n06-61848 2 \r\n \r\n Although that advisory vote would not be an \r\nelection, we would follow the rules of procedure of the \r\nAssembly governing elections. If there is no objection, \r\nmay I take it that the General Assembly agrees to that \r\nprocedure? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President: In accordance with existing \r\npractice, the country receiving the greatest number of \r\nvotes, and not less than a majority of the votes of those \r\npresent and voting, shall be the country selected to \r\npropose a candidate for appointment to the Joint \r\nInspection Unit. \r\n May I also take it that the General Assembly \r\nagrees to that procedure? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President: In the case of a tie vote, there \r\nwill be a restricted ballot, limited to those candidates \r\nthat have obtained an equal number of votes. \r\n May I take it that the Assembly agrees to that \r\nprocedure? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President: May I remind members that the \r\nAssembly is not appointing members to the Joint \r\nInspection Unit at this time. It is only selecting one \r\ncountry, which will be requested to propose a \r\ncandidate. Therefore, only the name of a country, and \r\nnot the name of an individual, should appear on the \r\nballot paper.  \r\n I should now like to repeat the names of the three \r\ncountries from among the African States that wish to \r\npropose a candidate: Egypt, the Sudan and the United \r\nRepublic of Tanzania. \r\n I should furthermore like to point out that, from \r\namong the African States, Senegal already has a \r\nnational serving on the Joint Inspection Unit. The name \r\nof that State should therefore not appear on ballot \r\npapers. \r\n The Assembly will now proceed to the selection \r\nof one country from among the African States that will \r\nbe requested to propose a candidate to fill the vacancy \r\nin the Joint Inspection Unit. \r\n Before we begin the voting process, I should like \r\nto remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the \r\nrules of procedure of the General Assembly, no \r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting except on a \r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the voting. \r\n We shall now begin the voting process. Members \r\nare requested to remain seated until all ballots have \r\nbeen collected.  \r\n Ballot papers will now be distributed. May I \r\nrequest representatives to write on the ballot papers the \r\nname of the one State for which they wish to vote. \r\nBallot papers containing more than one name will be \r\ndeclared invalid. If a ballot paper contains the name of \r\na Member State that does not belong to the region, that \r\nballot paper will be declared invalid. Ballot papers \r\nbearing the name of an individual will not be counted \r\nat all. \r\n At the invitation of the President Ms. Wiesinger \r\n(Austria), Ms. Salayeva (Azerbaijan), Mr. Camara \r\n(Guinea), Ms. Romulus (Haiti), and Mr. Adiya \r\n(Mongolia) acted as tellers. \r\n A vote was taken by secret ballot. \r\n The meeting was suspended at 3.35 p.m. and \r\nresumed at 4 p.m. \r\n The President: The result of the voting is as \r\nfollows: \r\n Group A – African States \r\n Number of ballot papers:  165 \r\n Number of invalid ballots:   1 \r\n Number of valid ballots:  164 \r\n Abstentions:      0 \r\n Number of members present and voting: 164 \r\n Required simple majority of members present  \r\n and voting:      83 \r\n Number of votes obtained: \r\n  Egypt     85 \r\n  United Republic of Tanzania 73 \r\n  Sudan     6 \r\n The President: Having obtained the required \r\nmajority and the greatest number of votes, I declare \r\nthat Egypt will be the country selected to propose a \r\ncandidate for appointment to the Joint Inspection Unit. \r\n I thank members for their advice, and the tellers \r\nfor their assistance. \r\n In accordance with article 3, paragraph 1, of the \r\nstatute of the Joint Inspection Unit, China, Cuba, \r\nEgypt, the Russian Federation and the United States of \r\nAmerica will be requested to submit the names of \r\n A/61/PV.55\r\n \r\n3 06-61848 \r\n \r\ncandidates and the curricula vitae highlighting the \r\ncandidates’ relevant qualifications for the tasks ahead. \r\n I would like to remind members that, in \r\naccordance with resolution 59/267, of 23 December \r\n2004, candidates should have experience in at least on \r\nof the following fields: oversight, audit, inspection, \r\ninvestigation, evaluation, finance, project evaluation, \r\nprogramme evaluation, human resources management, \r\nmanagement, public administration, monitoring and/or \r\nprogramme performance, as well as knowledge of the \r\nUnited Nations system and its role in international \r\nrelations.  \r\n After holding the appropriate consultations \r\ndescribed in article 3, paragraph 2, of the statute of the \r\nJoint Inspection Unit, including consultations with the \r\nPresident of the Economic and Social Council and the \r\nSecretary-General, in his capacity as Chairman of the \r\nUnited Nations System Chief Executives Board for \r\nCoordination, the President of the General Assembly \r\nwill propose the names of the candidates to the \r\nAssembly for appointment to the Joint Inspection Unit. \r\n We have thus concluded this stage of our \r\nconsideration of sub-item (h) of agenda item 106. \r\n  Programme of work \r\n \r\n The President: I would like to inform members \r\nthat, as its first item on Monday, 20 November 2006, \r\nthe Assembly will resume its consideration of agenda \r\nitem 74, entitled “Report of the International Criminal \r\nCourt”, to take action on draft resolution A/61/L.21. \r\n As the second item, the Assembly will consider, \r\nin a joint debate, agenda item 47, entitled “Integrated \r\nand coordinated implementation of and follow-up to \r\nthe outcomes of the major United Nations conferences \r\nand summits in the economic, social and related \r\nfields”, agenda item 112, entitled, “Strengthening of \r\nthe United Nations system”, agenda item 113, entitled \r\n“Follow-up to the outcome of the Millennium \r\nSummit”, and agenda item 149, entitled “United \r\nNations reform: measures and proposals”.
