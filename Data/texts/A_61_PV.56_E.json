(Bahrain) \r\n \r\n \r\n The meeting was called to order at 10.45 a.m. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 74 (continued) \r\n \r\nReport of the International Criminal Court  \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/61/L.21) \r\n \r\n The President: Members will recall that the \r\nAssembly held its debate on this agenda item at its \r\n26th and 27th plenary meetings on 9 October 2006. \r\n I give the floor to the representative of the \r\nNetherlands to introduce draft resolution A/61/L.21 \r\n Mr. Majoor (Netherlands): I have the honour to \r\nintroduce this morning the draft resolution entitled \r\n“Report of the International Criminal Court”. \r\n In addition to the list of countries contained in \r\ndocument A/61/L.21, the following countries have \r\nindicated their wish to be included as sponsors: \r\nAntigua and Barbuda, Burundi, Cambodia, the Central \r\nAfrican Republic, the Comoros, the Congo, Costa Rica, \r\nDjibouti, Dominica, Gabon, the Gambia, Haiti, \r\nJamaica, Liberia, Madagascar, the Marshall Islands, \r\nMontenegro, Panama, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint \r\nVincent and the Grenadines, Tajikistan, Timor Leste, \r\nUganda and Zambia. That brings the total number of \r\nsponsors of the draft resolution to 103. \r\n On 9 October, the President of the International \r\nCriminal Court presented the second annual report of \r\nthe International Criminal Court to this body. We had a \r\nvery constructive and in depth debate then, and I do not \r\nwant to repeat that discussion here today. Allow me, \r\nhowever, to highlight a few elements. \r\n The establishment of the Court was the most \r\nsignificant development in recent years in our long and \r\nongoing struggle to eradicate impunity. There can be \r\nno lasting peace without justice, and justice and peace \r\nare thus complementary requirements. In that regard, \r\nwe will continue to strive for universal adherence to \r\nthe Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. \r\nWe are therefore very pleased to welcome the countries \r\nthat have recently become parties to the Rome Statute. \r\n The annual report of the Court clearly \r\ndemonstrates that the International Criminal Court is \r\nnow fully operational. The judicial phase of its \r\noperations has started, involving both operations in the \r\nfield as well as courtroom proceedings against the first \r\naccused to be tried. We are pleased that the Court has \r\nrecently established a liaison office at the United \r\nNations here in New York, which we hope will enhance \r\nthe relationship between the two organizations and \r\nfacilitate communication. \r\n The International Criminal Court’s report, as well \r\nas the debate in the General Assembly a few weeks \r\nago, underlined the important role the International \r\nCriminal Court plays in our common multilateral \r\nsystem, which aims to end impunity and to establish \r\nthe rule of law, to promote and encourage respect for \r\nhuman rights, and to restore and maintain international \r\npeace and security. The assistance given by the Court \r\nto the Special Court for Sierra Leone and the \r\ncollaboration in the framework of the International \r\nA/61/PV.56  \r\n \r\n06-62233 2 \r\n \r\nIndependent Investigation Commission are proof of \r\nthat. \r\n The President of the International Criminal Court, \r\nin his address to the General Assembly a few weeks \r\nago, stressed the fact that cooperation between the \r\nCourt and the United Nations and cooperation by \r\nStates and international and regional organizations are \r\nfundamental to an effective and efficient functioning \r\nCourt, especially in relation to the arrest and surrender \r\nof accused persons, the provision of evidence, the \r\nrelocation of witnesses and the enforcement of \r\nsentences. We call on all States to support the Court’s \r\nefforts in that regard. The continuous support of civil \r\nsociety deserves to be mentioned as well. \r\n The draft resolution before us today serves three \r\nmain objectives. First, it provides political support for \r\nthe International Criminal Court as an organization, for \r\nits aims, as well as for the work it carries out.  \r\n Secondly, it underlines the importance of the \r\nrelationship between the International Criminal Court \r\nand the United Nations, which the two organizations \r\ncontinue to build on the basis of the Relationship \r\nAgreement.  \r\n Lastly, it serves to remind States and international \r\nregional organizations of the need to cooperate with \r\nthe International Criminal Court in carrying out its \r\ntasks.  \r\n The Netherlands hopes that the adoption of this \r\ndraft resolution today will lead to even greater support \r\nfor the International Criminal Court in its fight against \r\nimpunity and its attempt to hold those accused of very \r\nserious crimes accountable for their actions. \r\n The President: We shall now proceed to consider \r\ndraft resolution A/61/L.21. In connection with that \r\ndraft resolution, I give the floor to the representative of \r\nthe Secretariat. \r\n Mr. Botnaru (Chief, General Assembly Affairs \r\nBranch): In connection with draft resolution A/61/L.21, \r\nI wish to inform the General Assembly that by the \r\nterms of operative paragraphs 7 and 13 of the draft \r\nresolution, the General Assembly would emphasize the \r\nimportance of the full implementation of the \r\nRelationship Agreement between the United Nations \r\nand the International Criminal Court, which forms a \r\nframework for close cooperation between the two \r\norganizations and for consultation on matters of mutual \r\ninterest pursuant to the provisions of that Agreement \r\nand in conformity with the respective provisions of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and the Rome Statute, as \r\nwell as the need for comprehensive information from \r\nthe Secretary-General with respect to steps taken in the \r\nimplementation of the Relationship Agreement and \r\nwould take note of the decision of the Assembly of \r\nStates Parties to the Rome Statute of the International \r\nCriminal Court at its fourth session to hold its sixth \r\nsession in New York in 2007, while recalling that, \r\naccording to article 112, paragraph 6, of the Rome \r\nStatute, the Assembly of States Parties shall meet at the \r\nseat of the Court or at United Nations Headquarters, \r\nand would request the Secretary-General to provide the \r\nnecessary services and facilities in accordance with the \r\nRelationship Agreement and General Assembly \r\nresolution 58/318 of 13 September 2004.  \r\n In accordance with the decision of the General \r\nAssembly contained in resolution 58/318, all expenses \r\nresulting from the provision of services, facilities, \r\ncooperation and any other support rendered to the \r\nInternational Criminal Court or the Assembly of States \r\nParties to the Rome Statute of the International \r\nCriminal Court, including under any arrangements that \r\nmay be otherwise agreed under article 10 of the \r\nRelationship Agreement that may accrue to the United \r\nNations as a result of the implementation of the \r\nRelationship Agreement, shall be paid in full to the \r\nOrganization.  \r\n According to Article 10 of the Relationship \r\nAgreement just referred to,  \r\n “[t]he United Nations agrees that, upon the \r\nrequest of the Court, it shall, subject to \r\navailability, provide on a reimbursable basis, or \r\nas otherwise agreed, for the purposes of the Court \r\nsuch facilities and services as may be required, \r\nincluding for the meetings of the Assembly of \r\nStates Parties..., its Bureau or subsidiary bodies, \r\nincluding translation and interpretation services, \r\ndocumentation and conference services. When the \r\nUnited Nations is unable to meet the request of \r\nthe Court, it shall notify the Court accordingly, \r\ngiving reasonable notice”.  \r\n Accordingly, under the terms of General \r\nAssembly resolution 58/318 and Article 10 of the \r\nRelationship Agreement, the implementation of the \r\nactions prescribed in the draft resolution, should it be \r\nadopted by the General Assembly, would not give rise \r\nto any financial implications for the United Nations. \r\n A/61/PV.56\r\n \r\n3 06-62233 \r\n \r\n The President: Before giving the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of the United States, who wishes to \r\nspeak in explanation of position before a decision is \r\ntaken on the draft resolution, allow me to remind \r\ndelegations that explanations of vote or position are \r\nlimited to 10 minutes and should be made by \r\ndelegations from their seats.  \r\n Ms. Willson (United States of America): The \r\nconcerns of the United States about the Rome Statute \r\nand the International Criminal Court (ICC) are well \r\nknown. They include the ICC’s assertion of jurisdiction \r\nover nationals of States not parties to the Rome Statute, \r\nincluding United States nationals, and the lack of \r\nadequate oversight of the ICC’s activities, including \r\nthose of the Prosecutor, who may initiate cases without \r\nfirst seeking approval of the Security Council. \r\nAccordingly, the United States dissociates itself from \r\nconsensus on draft resolution A/61/L.21. \r\n Our concerns about the ICC are concerns about \r\nmeans, not about ends. We strongly support, and work \r\nactively to advance, international criminal justice and \r\naccountability for war crimes, genocide and crimes \r\nagainst humanity. In this regard, we have been leading \r\nsupporters of the International Criminal Tribunals for \r\nthe Former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda, and of the \r\nSpecial Court for Sierra Leone. We also accepted the \r\nSecurity Council’s decision to refer to the ICC the \r\nserious crimes committed in Darfur. \r\n We respect the views of the supporters of the ICC \r\nand understand that they would like the ICC to attain \r\nuniversal support. But we disagree with them about \r\nwhether the ICC, as currently constituted under the \r\nRome Statute, will effectively and appropriately \r\npromote those important objectives. As we have done \r\nin past years, we again made a good faith effort to \r\nwork with supporters of the ICC to have this draft \r\nresolution include language acknowledging that there \r\nare legitimate differences of views among States about \r\nthe ICC and recognizing the right of States to decide \r\nnot to become parties to the Rome Statute. Again this \r\nyear, supporters of the ICC have refused that \r\nreasonable request. \r\n Today’s draft resolution observes that effective \r\ncooperation and assistance by States, the United \r\nNations and other international and regional \r\norganizations remains essential for the ICC to carry out \r\nits activities. Respecting the positions of all parties is \r\nessential to our efforts to find practical ways to work \r\ntogether and ensure accountability. \r\n Today’s draft resolution references the \r\nRelationship Agreement between the United Nations \r\nand the ICC and requests that the United Nations \r\nprovide services and facilities to the ICC in connection \r\nwith certain meetings that the ICC plans to hold. We \r\nunderscore the importance in this regard of paragraph 3 \r\nof General Assembly resolution 58/318, which decides \r\nthat all expenses to the United Nations resulting from \r\nthe provision of services, facilities, cooperation and \r\nany other support to the ICC under the Relationship \r\nAgreement shall be paid in full to the United Nations. \r\nThis requirement that the United Nations must be \r\nreimbursed for all such assistance to the ICC must be \r\nstrictly observed. \r\n We note the request in paragraph 7 of today’s \r\ndraft resolution that the Secretary-General provide \r\ncomprehensive information with respect to steps taken \r\nin the implementation of the Relationship Agreement. \r\nIn that connection, we call on the Secretary-General to \r\nprovide clear and timely information to the General \r\nAssembly on all assistance provided by the United \r\nNations to the ICC and on the steps taken by the \r\nUnited Nations to secure reimbursement in full for the \r\ncosts of such assistance, in accordance with resolution \r\n58/318. \r\n The United States will continue to be a leading \r\nadvocate for international criminal justice and \r\naccountability for war crimes, genocide and crimes \r\nagainst humanity. We regret that resolutions like the \r\none to be adopted today hinder, rather than promote, \r\ncooperation among States in these efforts. \r\n The President: The Assembly will now take a \r\ndecision on draft resolution A/61/L.21. May I take it \r\nthat the Assembly decides to adopt draft resolution \r\nA/61/L.21? \r\n Draft resolution A/61/L.21 was adopted \r\n(resolution 61/15). \r\n The President: May I take it that it is the wish of \r\nthe General Assembly to conclude its consideration of \r\nagenda item 74? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n \r\nA/61/PV.56  \r\n \r\n06-62233 4 \r\n \r\nAgenda items 47, 112, 113 and 149 \r\n \r\nIntegrated and coordinated implementation of and \r\nfollow-up to the outcomes of the major United \r\nNations conferences and summits in the economic, \r\nsocial and related fields \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/61/90) \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/61/L.24) \r\n \r\nStrengthening of the United Nations system \r\n \r\nFollow-up to the outcome of the Millennium Summit \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/61/383) \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/61/L.24) \r\n \r\nUnited Nations reform: measures and proposals \r\n \r\n The President: In connection with agenda item \r\n113, the note by the Secretary-General, circulated as \r\ndocument A/61/383, transmits the report of the World \r\nHealth Organization on enhancing capacity-building in \r\nglobal public health. \r\n In connection with draft resolution A/61/L.24, I \r\nwish to draw the attention of members to a number of \r\ncorrections, which are now being distributed in the \r\nHall. Those corrections will be incorporated into the \r\nfinal version of the draft resolution.  \r\n We shall first proceed to take up draft resolution \r\nA/61/L.24. Thereafter, we shall proceed with the joint \r\ndebate on agenda items 47, 112, 113 and 149.  \r\n \r\nStatement by the President \r\n \r\n The President: I am very pleased that the \r\nAssembly has before it today a draft resolution on the \r\nstrengthening of the Economic and Social Council. \r\nThis document is the result of a long, and at times \r\ndifficult, process of consultations. We have finally \r\nconcluded that important process in a spirit of true \r\ncompromise.  \r\n I would like to take this opportunity to thank all \r\ndelegations for their active and constructive \r\nparticipation in the consultation process on this \r\nimportant matter. In particular, I would like to express \r\nmy most sincere gratitude to Ambassador Verbeke of \r\nBelgium and Ambassador Diarra of Mali for their \r\nstrong and dedicated leadership in conducting the \r\nconsultations, and to commend Mr. Ruiz Massieu \r\nAguirre of Mexico for his tireless facilitation.  \r\n This draft resolution is an important milestone in \r\nrealizing the vision set out by our leaders at the 2005 \r\nWorld Summit. The draft resolution, once adopted, will \r\nstrengthen the role of the Economic and Social Council \r\nas a central body for coordination, policy review, \r\npolicy guidance and recommendations on issues of \r\neconomic and social development, as well as for the \r\nimplementation of international development goals. \r\nThe draft resolution will also be an acknowledgement \r\nof the central importance of development as one of the \r\nprincipal pillars of the United Nations. \r\n This draft resolution will enable the Economic \r\nand Social Council to launch the annual ministerial \r\nreview and the Development Cooperation Forum \r\nduring the 2007 high-level segment of the Council, to \r\nbe held in Geneva. Beginning in 2008, the \r\nDevelopment Cooperation Forum will meet every other \r\nyear in New York.  \r\n The draft resolution will also enable the Council \r\nto respond to humanitarian emergencies as and when \r\nthey occur, by convening ad hoc meetings. That will \r\nhelp to make United Nations humanitarian responses \r\nmore effective and efficient. \r\n Furthermore, the draft resolution will bring into \r\nsharper focus the linkages between the work of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and the Council’s Ad Hoc \r\nAdvisory Groups on countries emerging from conflict. \r\nI am confident that those new functions will put the \r\nCouncil at the centre of global efforts to achieve \r\ninternationally agreed development goals, including \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. That is both a \r\ndemanding responsibility and a tremendous \r\nopportunity for the Council to perform more \r\neffectively.  \r\n We have worked hard for nearly a year to reach \r\nagreement on strengthening of the Economic and \r\nSocial Council. It is my sincere hope that this draft \r\nresolution will be adopted by consensus, so that the \r\nEconomic and Social Council can carry out its new \r\nfunctions as mandated by our leaders at the 2005 World \r\nSummit.  \r\n We shall now proceed to consider draft resolution \r\nA/61/L.24, as corrected. In connection with the draft \r\nresolution, I now give the floor to the representative of \r\nthe Secretariat. \r\n Mr. Botnaru (Chief, General Assembly Affairs \r\nBranch): I should like to inform members that in \r\n A/61/PV.56\r\n \r\n5 06-62233 \r\n \r\nconnection with draft resolution A/61/L.24, as \r\ncorrected, entitled “Strengthening of the Economic and \r\nSocial Council”, I wish to put on record the following \r\nstatement of financial implications, on behalf of the \r\nSecretary-General, on the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil as a Charter body, in accordance with rule 153 \r\nof the rules of procedure of the General Assembly. \r\n The paragraphs that would give rise to financial \r\nimplications are operative paragraphs 2, 3, 8, 14, 18 \r\nand 19 of the draft resolution. \r\n The conference-servicing implications are as \r\nfollows.  \r\n First, the meeting referred to under subparagraph \r\n(a) of paragraph 2 — the special high-level meeting \r\nwith the Bretton Woods institutions, the World Trade \r\nOrganization and the United Nations Conference on \r\nTrade and Development — has already been included \r\nin the calendar of conferences and meetings of the \r\nUnited Nations. It is understood that there will be no \r\nchange to the pattern of the special meeting — that is, \r\none day, with two fully serviced plenary meetings, one \r\nin the morning and one in the afternoon; and four fully \r\nserviced round tables, either in the morning or in the \r\nafternoon. \r\n Therefore, should the General Assembly adopt \r\nsubparagraph (a) of operative paragraph 2, no \r\nadditional resources would be required. \r\n Secondly, the meetings referred to under \r\nsubparagraph (b) of operative paragraph 2 and in \r\noperative paragraphs 3 and 8, that is, the annual high-\r\nlevel policy dialogue with international financial and \r\ntrade institutions, the biennial high-level Development \r\nCooperation Forum, and the Council’s convening of \r\nannual ministerial-level substantive reviews, will be \r\nheld within the framework of the high-level segment of \r\nthe substantive session of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil. No additional parallel meetings will be \r\nrequired over and above the existing pattern of \r\nmeetings. Therefore, should the General Assembly \r\nadopt subparagraph (b) of operative paragraph 2 and \r\noperative paragraphs 3 and 8, no additional resources \r\nwould be required. \r\n Thirdly, under subparagraph (c) of operative \r\nparagraph 2, on discussions on a theme from the \r\neconomic, social and related fields; operative \r\nparagraph 14 on the need for ad hoc meetings on \r\nspecific humanitarian emergencies; and operative \r\nparagraph 18, on ensuring the provision of full \r\nconference services to the Council for all meetings \r\nnecessary to enable the Council to fulfil its \r\nstrengthened mandate, it is our understanding that \r\nthese meetings do not represent an increase over the \r\ntotal number of meetings reserved annually as a \r\npractice for the preparatory process of the substantive \r\nsession of the Economic and Social Council and \r\ntherefore would not require additional resources. \r\n However, as advance planning is essential in \r\nensuring the satisfactory provision of conference \r\nservices as well as achieving cost-effectiveness, the \r\nexact dates of those meetings will need to be \r\ndetermined by consultations between the substantive \r\nsecretariat and the Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management. \r\n Fourthly, under operative paragraph 19, on the \r\nmeetings to facilitate the fulfilment of its newly \r\nassigned responsibilities for organizing the annual \r\nministerial reviews, as referred to under subparagraph \r\n(b) of operative paragraph 2; and the Development \r\nCooperation Forum, as referred to under operative \r\nparagraph 3, up to two weeks of meetings, it will be \r\nrecalled that, in its resolution 60/246, the General \r\nAssembly, having considered the report of the \r\nAdvisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary \r\nQuestions, decided that such additional resources as \r\nmay be necessary be reflected in the relevant \r\nperformance report for the biennium 2006-2007.  \r\n Through advance planning and consultations \r\nbetween the substantive secretariat and the Department \r\nfor General Assembly and Conference Management, it \r\nis anticipated that those meetings can be judiciously \r\nscheduled so that they can be accommodated from \r\nwithin existing resources. \r\n The President: I give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of France on a point of order. \r\n Mr. Pic (France) (spoke in French): My \r\ndelegation wishes to indicate that we would like to \r\nreserve the right to provide, in writing, requests to \r\nchange the French translation of this draft resolution. \r\n The President: The Assembly will now take a \r\ndecision on draft resolution A/61/L.24, entitled \r\n“Strengthening of the Economic and Social Council”, \r\nas corrected. \r\n May I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt \r\ndraft resolution A/61/L.24, as corrected? \r\nA/61/PV.56  \r\n \r\n06-62233 6 \r\n \r\n Draft resolution A/61/L.24, as corrected, was \r\nadopted (resolution 61/16). \r\n The President: I shall now call on those \r\nrepresentatives wishing to speak in explanation of \r\nposition on the resolution just adopted. May I remind \r\ndelegations that explanations of vote are limited to 10 \r\nminutes and should be made by delegations from their \r\nseats. \r\n Ms. Lintonen (Finland): The European Union \r\n(EU) attaches great importance to the strengthening \r\nand revitalizing of the Economic and Social Council, \r\nas set out in the World Summit Outcome Document. \r\nWe would therefore like to express our strong support \r\nfor the successful finalization of this resolution. \r\n The European Union is pleased that the Economic \r\nand Social Council can now finally proceed with \r\nplanning for the upcoming session of the Council and \r\ncontinue its work with reformed functions, as \r\nmandated by the World Summit Outcome Document \r\nand this resolution. \r\n The European Union would like to express its \r\nappreciation to you, Madam President, and to the co-\r\nChairmen — Mr. Verbeke, Ambassador of Belgium, \r\nand Mr. Diarra, Ambassador of Mali — for their \r\nleading role in contributing to the completion of this \r\nprocess. We would like also to extend our warmest \r\ncompliments to the facilitator, Mr. Carlos Ruíz of \r\nMexico. \r\n In addition, we would like to thank all \r\nnegotiation partners for the constructive spirit that kept \r\nup the momentum and enabled us to reach consensus \r\non this important issue. The European Union hopes that \r\nthis positive approach will also facilitate a timely \r\nagreement on the remaining questions during the \r\nresumed session of the Economic and Social Council \r\nand promote our efforts to adapt the work of the \r\nCouncil. \r\n Mr. Kumalo (South Africa): The Group of 77 \r\nand China welcomes the adoption of the resolution on \r\nthe strengthening of the Economic and Social Council. \r\nWith the adoption of this resolution, the United \r\nNations has reaffirmed the role of the Economic and \r\nSocial Council as the central mechanism for system-\r\nwide coordination in promoting the integrated and \r\ncoordinated implementation of, and follow-up to, the \r\noutcomes of the major United Nations conferences in \r\nthe economic, social and related fields. As a principal \r\nbody for coordination and policy review, policy \r\ndialogue and recommendations on issues related to \r\neconomic and social development, the Economic and \r\nSocial Council will now be able to play its proper role. \r\n The Group of 77 and China is pleased that the \r\nmandate from our leaders has been adhered to in \r\naccordance with the World Summit Outcome and that \r\nthe Economic and Social Council has been \r\nstrengthened through the creation of the biannual \r\nDevelopment Cooperation Forum and the annual \r\nministerial review.  \r\n The Group of 77 and China welcomes the new, \r\nstrengthened role of the substantive session and the \r\nfact that the General Assembly has decided that the \r\nDevelopment Cooperation Forum will, in the context \r\nof international economic and development \r\ncooperation, identify gaps, review trends and progress \r\nand provide policy guidelines and recommendations, \r\nwith the aim being to enhance the implementation of \r\ninternationally agreed development cooperation and to \r\nstudy the issues affecting the achievement of the \r\ninternationally agreed development goals, including \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals.  \r\n We therefore welcome the decision that the \r\nDevelopment Cooperation Forum should undertake \r\nregular reviews and assessments of international \r\neconomic and development policies and of their impact \r\non development. That is a vital element that will enable \r\nthe Economic and Social Council to play a major role \r\nin the efficient use of monitoring and follow-up \r\nmechanisms to ensure that commitments and actions \r\nare effectively implemented in the context of \r\ninternational economic and development policies and \r\ncooperation. \r\n The Group of 77 and China looks forward to the \r\nhigh-level deliberations at the annual ministerial \r\nreview to evaluate progress and implementation by \r\nmeans of a cross-sectoral approach, focusing on \r\nthematic issues common to the outcomes of the major \r\nUnited Nations conferences and summits in the \r\neconomic, social and related fields, as well as to assess \r\nthe achievement of the goals and targets of the \r\nconferences and summits.  \r\n The Group of 77 and China believes that the \r\nresolution clearly and distinctly outlines the \r\nrelationship between the Peacebuilding Commission \r\nand the Economic and Social Council. That will enrich \r\nand enhance the work of the Peacebuilding \r\n A/61/PV.56\r\n \r\n7 06-62233 \r\n \r\nCommission in post-conflict development and \r\nreconstruction. \r\n The Group of 77 and China welcomes the \r\nrecognition by Member States that there has been \r\ninsufficient provision of conference services and \r\nsubstantive support to the Council’s meetings, which \r\nhas impeded the Council’s ability to fulfil its mandate. \r\nThe Group therefore welcomes the renewed \r\nrecognition that the Council, as a Charter body, is \r\nentitled to convene meetings as and when needed, with \r\nfull substantive support and conference services to \r\nfacilitate its strengthened mandate, in particular when \r\nit relates to humanitarian emergencies. \r\n In conclusion, on behalf of the Group of 77 and \r\nChina, I would like to thank you, Madam President, for \r\nworking with us in the final stages of this resolution. I \r\nwould also like to thank the two Co-Chairs, the \r\nambassadors of Mali and Belgium, and, of course, our \r\ntireless facilitator, Mr. Carlos Ruiz Massieu Aguirre of \r\nMexico, for their dedication, patience and hard work. \r\nWe would also like to acknowledge the cooperation of \r\nour negotiating partners, who made it possible for us to \r\nadopt this important resolution by consensus. \r\n Mr. Sen (India): We welcome resolution 61/16, \r\non strengthening of the Economic and Social Council, \r\nand congratulate you, Madam President, on your \r\nleadership in bringing the negotiations on that \r\nresolution to a conclusion. Its adoption no doubt paves \r\nthe way for the operationalization of the Council’s new \r\nfunctions, namely, the annual ministerial review and \r\nthe Development Cooperation Forum, mandated by the \r\n2005 World Summit. \r\n With the adoption of this resolution, we have \r\nonce again reconfirmed the role of the Economic and \r\nSocial Council as the principal body within the United \r\nNations for coordinating policy review, policy dialogue \r\nand recommendations on issues of economic and social \r\ndevelopment. India has consistently maintained that it \r\nis primarily a question of political will — rather than \r\nof reinventing the Economic and Social Council — to \r\nenable the Council to effectively fulfil its mandate \r\nrelating to oversight and system-wide coordination, \r\nwith respect not only to United Nations agencies, funds \r\nand programmes, but also to the specialized agencies \r\nof the United Nations. \r\n We agree with the statement made by the Chair of \r\nthe Group of 77, my colleague from South Africa, that \r\nthe elements outlined in this resolution in the context \r\nof the Development Cooperation Forum will strengthen \r\nthe Economic and Social Council, particularly with \r\nregard to its oversight and system-wide coordination \r\nfunctions. That will provide the Council with an \r\nopportunity to review trends and progress in \r\ninternational development cooperation and to provide \r\npolicy guidance and recommendations. An important \r\nfunction of the Forum will be to undertake regular and \r\nperiodic review and assessment of international \r\neconomic policies and of their impact on development.  \r\n In the context of systemic issues, it is particularly \r\nimportant to implement the commitment to enhancing \r\nthe ability of developing countries to participate \r\nmeaningfully in decision-making, an important \r\ncomponent of which is to assist developing countries in \r\nenhancing their capacity to assess the impact that \r\npolicy changes have on them. While the industrialized \r\ncountries have the capacity to make their own \r\nassessments, most of the developing countries do not \r\nhave the resources to do so.  \r\n The situations in several developing countries \r\namply demonstrate the impact of the structural \r\nadjustment policies of the International Monetary Fund \r\n(IMF). Many on the verge of civil conflict not only \r\nhave failed to benefit from those policies, but have \r\nplunged deeper into conflict. Also, in the case of many \r\ncountries, the IMF bail-out packages did not work in \r\nthe way predicted during the crisis.  \r\n Hence, there is a need for assessment of the \r\ndisparity between predicted consequences and what \r\nactually happens. Given the lack of resources among \r\ndeveloping countries, the deliberative discussions \r\nwithin the international economic institutions could be \r\ncomplemented if there were an independent body to \r\nevaluate their policies, as well as alternative proposals \r\nconcerning their impact on developing countries and \r\non development. The United Nations is best placed to \r\ndo so. Detailed consideration in the Economic and \r\nSocial Council, with policy guidance from the General \r\nAssembly, would be helpful.  \r\n We are confident that the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil, on the basis of the review and assessment of \r\ninternational economic policies and the international \r\nfinancial, monetary and trade policies of relevant \r\ninstitutions, will make recommendations where needed \r\nso that the necessary correctives can make the \r\ninternational economic environment supportive of \r\ndevelopment. Not only will that increase confidence in \r\nA/61/PV.56  \r\n \r\n06-62233 8 \r\n \r\nand the legitimacy of international economic \r\ngovernance; it may also lead to better economic \r\ngovernance that may benefit both the developing and \r\ndeveloped worlds.  \r\n We welcome the agreement related to the role of \r\nthe Economic and Social Council in peacebuilding. We \r\nlook forward to the Council’s contribution in that area \r\nand to the Peacebuilding Commission’s benefiting \r\nfrom it. We also welcome the reaffirmation of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council’s entitlement as a \r\nCharter body, which is so important to its ability to \r\nfulfil its mandate effectively. \r\n In conclusion, I once again congratulate you, \r\nMadam President, on your leadership. I also thank the \r\nCo-Chairs, the ambassadors of Belgium and Mali, as \r\nwell as the Facilitator, from the Mission of Mexico.  \r\n Mr. Miller (United States of America): While the \r\nEconomic and Social Council, as a Charter body, is \r\nentitled to convene meetings as and when needed, the \r\nUnited States believes that it is important to stress that \r\nthe Council should also ensure the efficient use of its \r\nsession time, while working to fulfil its mandates \r\neffectively.  \r\n Our support for resolution 61/16 is thus \r\ncontingent upon our understanding that the resolution \r\nhas no financial implications. The Department of \r\nGeneral Assembly and Conference Management must \r\nbe accorded flexibility and time for adequate planning \r\nin order to ensure that it can utilize existing resources, \r\nas noted in the Secretariat’s statement.  \r\n My delegation would also like to emphasize that \r\nthe resolution does not specify the number or \r\nfrequency of meetings that should occur, nor does it \r\nrequire any additional meetings.  \r\n The President: We shall now proceed with the \r\njoint debate under agenda items 47, 112, 113 and 149.  \r\n Mr. Rosengren (Finland): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the European Union (EU). The \r\nacceding countries Bulgaria and Romania, the \r\ncandidate countries Turkey, Croatia and the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the countries of the \r\nStabilization and Association Process and potential \r\ncandidates Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, \r\nMontenegro and Serbia, as well as Ukraine and \r\nMoldova, align themselves with this statement. \r\n In September 2005, heads of State gathered at the \r\nWorld Summit to assess the implementation of the \r\noutcomes of the major United Nations conferences and \r\nsummits and the progress made in implementing the \r\nMillennium Declaration and to find additional \r\nmomentum for achieving the internationally agreed \r\ndevelopment goals, including the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). What is important is to \r\nembed the Goals into country-led processes in a \r\nmanner which would eradicate poverty and promote \r\nsustained economic growth, environmental \r\nsustainability and global prosperity for all. \r\n The EU is pleased that during the past year \r\nachievements have been reached in the United Nations \r\nreform process launched by the World Summit. In that \r\nregard, we would like to mention the establishment of \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, the adoption of the United Nations Global \r\nCounter-Terrorism Strategy, the work of the Informal \r\nWorking Group on Mandate Review, the progress made \r\nso far on management reform and the follow-up by the \r\nGeneral Assembly to the World Summit Outcome \r\nconcerning the development and reform of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council. \r\n The EU would like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report on the role of the Economic and \r\nSocial Council in the integrated and coordinated \r\nimplementation of the outcomes of and follow-up to \r\nmajor United Nations conferences and summits \r\n(A/61/90). Through its annual consideration, the \r\nEconomic and Social Council has made progress in \r\nimplementing its commitments in the follow-up to the \r\ninternationally agreed development goals and \r\nobjectives, including the MDGs. The coordinating role \r\nof the Economic and Social Council in the economic, \r\nsocial, environmental and humanitarian fields and in \r\nfostering dialogue within the wider United Nations \r\nsystem was further discussed at the Council’s 2006 \r\nsubstantive session. \r\n In the 2005 World Summit Outcome and its \r\nfollow-up, the mandate of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil to ensure follow-up to the outcomes of the \r\nmajor United Nations conferences and summits was \r\nreiterated. The EU strongly supports those \r\ndevelopments and looks forward to the coming year, \r\nwhen new functions of the Council, especially the \r\nannual ministerial reviews, will be implemented. \r\n A/61/PV.56\r\n \r\n9 06-62233 \r\n \r\n As the 2005 Summit emphasized, development \r\nmust be based on global partnership. The EU remains \r\nfirmly committed to supporting country-led sustainable \r\ndevelopment through actions on aid volume and \r\neffectiveness, debt relief, innovative finance \r\nmechanisms, trade and the international institutions. \r\n Respect for human rights — including economic, \r\nsocial and cultural rights — the rule of law, solid \r\ndemocratic institutions responsive to the needs of the \r\npeople, good governance, sound economic policies and \r\nimproved infrastructure are the basis for sustainable \r\neconomic growth, poverty eradication and employment \r\ncreation. The EU is committed to working towards the \r\nachievement of the MDGs, recognizing that they can \r\nonly be attained if both women and men are able to \r\nplay an equal part in all areas of life. As recognized in \r\nthe Outcome Document of the 2005 World Summit \r\n(resolution 60/1) development, peace and security and \r\nhuman rights are interlinked and mutually reinforcing. \r\n The EU welcomes the first report to the General \r\nAssembly on enhancing capacity-building in global \r\npublic health (A/61/383). The EU believes that health \r\nis central to the achievement of the internationally \r\nagreed development goals, including the MDGs, and \r\nthat such goals position health as a core part of the \r\ndevelopment agenda. We would therefore find it useful \r\nfor this body to consider an assessment of global \r\nprogress towards achieving improvements in health, \r\nhighlighting the contributions of the United Nations \r\nsystem. \r\n Despite our efforts, and although there have been \r\nimpressive gains in human health worldwide in recent \r\nyears, we are still in a situation where many countries \r\nare unable to cope with the burden posed by disease on \r\ntheir health systems, due to inherent weaknesses in \r\nnational health systems, unpredictable and uneven \r\nfunding and the dire lack of skilled human resources. \r\nWithout skilled and motivated health personnel, any \r\nhealth sector intervention is bound to fail, placing at \r\nrisk our current efforts to address avian flu and human \r\ninfluenza. We must therefore use opportunities, such as \r\nthat offered by the current debate, to redouble our \r\nefforts to mobilize political commitment and to \r\nadvocate for increased financial resources for the \r\nhealth sector. \r\n The World Summit Outcome and last year’s \r\nresolution 60/35, on capacity-building in global public \r\nhealth provided excellent guidance to Member States \r\non how to improve health outcomes. In particular, we \r\nrecall our commitments to increase investment, \r\nbuilding on existing mechanisms and through \r\npartnerships to improve health systems in developing \r\ncountries with the aim of providing sufficient \r\ninfrastructures, management systems and supplies, as \r\nwell as adequate numbers of health workers. \r\n Last April, the EU adopted a Strategy for Action \r\non the Crisis in Human Resources for Health in \r\nDeveloping Countries and is presently working on an \r\naction plan addressing that global issue. \r\n The EU has supported pioneering work in \r\nresearch collaboration with developing countries in the \r\nfield of health systems. It is essential that research and \r\ndevelopment in the area of health systems, and the \r\nrational, cost-effective and appropriate use of \r\ntechnologies, are supported and continued alongside \r\nthe innovative creation of new compounds and \r\ntechnologies. \r\n The EU welcomes the attention and proposals \r\noffered in the report to better respond to reproductive \r\nhealth issues. It is crucial to ensure universal access to \r\nHIV/AIDS prevention and treatment to all people, \r\nfocusing especially on vulnerable groups. The scaling-\r\nup of support through the strengthening of social \r\nprotection systems and the creation of opportunities for \r\nless susceptible livelihoods for affected households, \r\nparticularly those with children, have a preventive \r\neffect and need to be part of the HIV/AIDS response. \r\nDevelopment of paediatric drugs and coverage of \r\ntreatment for children lags far behind what is available \r\nfor adults. \r\n Although we will not have a resolution on \r\nenhancing capacity-building in global public health \r\nthis year, we reaffirm our commitment to the issue and \r\nour willingness to discuss health in a holistic manner in \r\nthe General Assembly. \r\n National ownership and leadership are the \r\nprerequisites for sustainable development results. In \r\nthis regard there has been good progress at the national \r\nlevel, especially when it comes to introducing poverty \r\nreduction strategies. Progress has already been made in \r\naligning United Nations development plans, the \r\ncommon country assessment and United Nations \r\nDevelopment Assistance Framework, with \r\ncomprehensive national development strategies, in \r\nparticular with the poverty reduction strategy. In this \r\nregard, it is also important to ensure the input of civil \r\nA/61/PV.56  \r\n \r\n06-62233 10 \r\n \r\nsociety and private sector, as full national ownership \r\nrequires broad-based engagement and participation of \r\nall relevant stakeholders. \r\n Furthermore, the EU is committed to working \r\nwith the partners to find solutions to improve the \r\nUnited Nations system-wide coherence on the basis of \r\nthe recommendations of the High-level Panel, which \r\nwere recently made available. In this regard, the EU \r\nconsiders the interlinkages of development and \r\nhumanitarian and environmental activities of high \r\nimportance. The EU also intends to further improve the \r\ncoherence of its own policies and activities affecting \r\nthese issues. \r\n Mr. Kumalo (South Africa): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. \r\n The integrated and coordinated implementation \r\nof and follow-up to the outcomes of the United Nations \r\nmajor conferences and summits in the economic, social \r\nand related fields is essential and must remain the \r\npriority role of the United Nations, if we are to succeed \r\nin eradicating poverty and in lifting billions of people \r\nout of dehumanizing and degrading poverty and \r\nhunger. \r\n We are only six years into the twenty-first \r\ncentury, one third of the way to the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) target of reducing poverty \r\nand hunger by half by 2015, and still, billions live in \r\ndegrading poverty. If we are to succeed in fully \r\nimplementing the Millennium Development Goals by \r\n2015, then the full and timely implementation of all \r\ncommitments made at all the United Nations summits \r\nand conferences must become a reality. \r\n With the rapid progress of globalization and the \r\ncontinued uncertain prospects of a global economic \r\nrecovery, the gap between the developed and \r\ndeveloping countries is growing. This is increasing the \r\nimbalance in the global economic, financial and social \r\narchitecture even further, once again in favour of the \r\ndeveloped countries. \r\n Therefore, for the Group of 77 and China, the \r\ncritical target of 2015 set by our leaders in the \r\nMillennium Declaration to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals is of paramount importance. The \r\n2005 World Summit Outcome clearly stated that the \r\nimplementation of the internationally agreed \r\ndevelopment goals, including the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, would not be achieved, in \r\nparticular in sub-Saharan Africa, unless there is a \r\ndramatic and urgent increase in resource flows. This \r\nhas never been more urgent than it is now. \r\n There is an urgent need for concerted multilateral \r\naction to achieve the Millennium Development Goals \r\nas a means for solving economic and social problems, \r\nfor promoting peace and security and for the creation \r\nof an enabling international economic environment \r\naimed at supporting developing countries’ efforts to \r\nachieve sustained economic growth and sustainable \r\ndevelopment. \r\n The United Nations has a vital role to play in the \r\npromotion of an equitable global economic, financial \r\nand trading regime. In this regard, the United Nations \r\nsystem, and the international organizations and \r\ninstitutions, including the Bretton Woods institutions \r\nand the World Trade Organization, must translate all \r\ncommitments made at the major United Nations \r\nconferences and summits in the economic, social and \r\nrelated fields into concrete and specific actions aimed \r\nat achieving the internationally agreed development \r\ngoals, including the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nThe 2005 World Summit Outcome reminds us just how \r\nimportant this is. \r\n The Group of 77 and China cannot \r\noveremphasize the need for the United Nations to play \r\na fundamental role in the promotion of international \r\ncooperation for development, and in ensuring the \r\ncoherence, coordination and implementation of the \r\ninternationally agreed development goals, including all \r\nactions agreed upon by the international community. \r\nThis is to strengthen coordination within the United \r\nNations system, in close cooperation with all other \r\nmultilateral financial, trade and development \r\ninstitutions in order to support sustained economic \r\ngrowth, poverty and hunger eradication and sustainable \r\ndevelopment in developing countries. \r\n The United Nations, therefore, has an important \r\nresponsibility to assist Governments to stay fully \r\nengaged in the follow-up to and implementation of \r\nagreements and commitments reached at the major \r\nUnited Nations conferences and summits. \r\n There is an urgent need, as called for in the \r\ndevelopment follow-up resolution (resolution 60/265), \r\nto fully implement the global partnership for \r\ndevelopment and enhance the momentum generated by \r\nthe 2005 World Summit Outcome, in order to \r\noperationalize and implement, at all levels, the \r\n A/61/PV.56\r\n \r\n11 06-62233 \r\n \r\ncommitments made in all the outcomes of all the major \r\nUnited Nations conferences and summits. \r\n In this regard, the Group of 77 and China calls \r\nfor the full implementation of the development follow-\r\nup resolution. It has clearly and succinctly outlined the \r\nactions that must be undertaken in the context of the \r\nimplementation of all the outcomes of all the major \r\nUnited Nations conferences and summits in the \r\neconomic, social and related fields. \r\n The United Nations must start to monitor, track \r\nprogress and review implementation of the \r\ninternationally agreed development goals and the \r\nMDGs. Therefore, the United Nations system must, in \r\naccordance with the development follow-up resolution, \r\nstrengthen the existing mechanisms and establish other \r\neffective mechanisms to monitor, review and follow up \r\non the implementation of the outcomes of all the major \r\nUnited Nations conferences and summits as a matter of \r\npriority. \r\n At today’s adoption of the resolution on the \r\nstrengthening of the Economic and Social Council, the \r\nCouncil’s role as the central mechanism for system-\r\nwide coordination in promoting the integrated and \r\ncoordinated implementation of and follow-up to the \r\noutcomes of the major United Nations conferences and \r\nsummits has been reaffirmed. It is the principal body \r\nfor coordination, policy review, policy dialogue and \r\nrecommendations on issues of economic and social \r\ndevelopment, as well as for implementation of the \r\ninternational development goals agreed to at the major \r\nUnited Nations conferences and summits, in \r\naccordance with the Charter. \r\n With the adoption of the development follow-up \r\nand Economic and Social Council strengthening \r\nresolutions and  in accordance with the mandate from \r\nour leaders, the United Nations has been reaffirmed as \r\nthe central, fully inclusive, global, multilateral, \r\ninternational and representative organization \r\nresponsible for development policies, review and \r\nprogress and for the integrated and coordinated \r\nimplementation of and follow-up to the outcomes of \r\nthe United Nations major conferences and summits.  \r\n Our leaders, through the outcomes of all major \r\nUnited Nations conferences and summits, have laid the \r\nnecessary foundations for enhancing development — \r\nthe substance is in its place. Commitments have been \r\nmade; the systemic issues have already been already \r\nbeen agreed upon. All that is needed now is full and \r\ntimely implementation. The Group of 77 and China \r\ntherefore once again reiterates a call to developed \r\ncountries for the full and timely implementation of the \r\nglobal partnership for development so as to enable \r\ndeveloping countries to achieve the goals and targets of \r\nthe internationally agreed objectives, including the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, by 2015.  \r\n Mr. Kryzhanivskyi (Ukraine): I have the honour \r\nto speak on behalf of the States members of the GUAM \r\nOrganization for Democracy and Economic \r\nDevelopment (ODED-GUAM), namely, Azerbaijan, \r\nGeorgia, Moldova and Ukraine. The GUAM States \r\nwould like to thank the Secretary-General for his \r\nreports.  \r\n The outcomes of the United Nations conferences \r\nand summits in the economic and social fields have \r\nstrengthened a common vision of development and a \r\nculture of responsibility in advancing those outcomes. \r\nThus, integrated and coordinated follow-up in the \r\nimplementation process is crucial to preserving the \r\nthematic unity and integrity of each conference while \r\naddressing the interlinkages among them. In this \r\nregard, we would like to recall General Assembly \r\nresolutions 50/227 and 57/270 B, and we stress the \r\nimportance of further progress in this regard.  \r\n Our States are committed to the implementation \r\nof the outcomes of the major United Nations \r\nconferences and, for our part and in line with our \r\ncommitments, we have adopted comprehensive \r\nnational development strategies and pursued reform \r\nprocesses to accelerate our development and make such \r\ndevelopment sustainable. We stand ready to engage in \r\na dialogue towards strengthening intergovernmental \r\ncooperation and interaction among United Nations \r\nagencies, the Bretton Woods institutions and the World \r\nTrade Organization. \r\n The GUAM States agree that progress has been \r\nslow in providing a road map toward system-wide \r\ncoherence of the different follow-up mechanisms and \r\nin recognizing the need for all-encompassing \r\ndevelopment strategies that take into consideration the \r\nlinkages between the conference results both within the \r\nUnited Nations system and at the governmental level. \r\nWhile commending the efforts of the United Nations \r\nSystem Chief Executives Board for Coordination and \r\nthe United Nations system at large to enhance inter-\r\nagency coordination and integration of internationally \r\nagreed development goals at both policy and \r\nA/61/PV.56  \r\n \r\n06-62233 12 \r\n \r\noperational levels, we note the paramount importance \r\nof systematic inter-agency cooperation and of \r\nincreasing strategic and operational coherence across \r\nall areas. The latter is even more relevant at the \r\ncountry level, and thus we look forward to further \r\ncontributions from the United Nations Development \r\nGroup towards promoting policy coherence through \r\nbetter utilization of the United Nations Development \r\nAssistance Framework. \r\n The GUAM States are convinced that \r\ninternationally agreed development goals, including \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals, should remain an \r\noverarching framework for international development \r\ncooperation and that the cooperation itself should be \r\npursued in a spirit of global partnership for \r\ndevelopment. In that regard, we welcome the decision \r\nto launch the preparatory process to review the \r\nimplementation of the outcomes of the International \r\nConference on Financing for Development. \r\n The 2005 World Summit sent a strong message \r\nthat there is a continued need to promote an integrated \r\nand coordinated follow-up to the major United Nations \r\nconferences and summits as well as to envisage \r\ntangible measures to strengthen the role of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council as a principal body for \r\ncoordination of the implementation of the \r\ninternationally agreed development goals. \r\n Mr. Pedroso (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): First of \r\nall, my delegation would like to associate itself with \r\nthe statement made by the representative of South \r\nAfrica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China as well \r\nas to put forward some considerations on this issue, \r\nwhich is of particular importance for developing \r\ncountries. \r\n Five years after the adoption of the Millennium \r\nDeclaration (resolution 55/2), in which we committed \r\nourselves to working for the famous — albeit \r\nmodest — Millennium Development Goals, the so-\r\ncalled development agenda for our countries is far from \r\nbecoming a reality because we continue to face \r\nenormous challenges and obstacles as a result of the \r\nneoliberal globalization process. Lasting solutions to \r\nissues addressed in the Monterrey Consensus, such as \r\nofficial development assistance (ODA), external debt, \r\nforeign direct investment and international trade \r\ncontinue to be a pipe dream today and, particularly for \r\ndeveloping countries, continue to be truly critical. \r\n Just a few figures will show this. Four fifths of \r\nhumanity is living in conditions of underdevelopment \r\nand poverty. Of them, 1.3 billion are in extreme \r\npoverty and account for only 1.3 per cent of world \r\nconsumption. The foreign debt of developing countries \r\ncontinues to grow, and last year reached the staggering \r\nfigure of $2.8 trillion, an increase of 1.6 per cent from \r\nthe previous year. In the case of the least developed \r\ncountries, their foreign debt burden reached \r\nunprecedented levels. For every dollar devoted to the \r\nofficial development assistance, developing countries \r\npay six dollars just for servicing their debt which we \r\nhave already paid many times over. But this debt \r\ncontinues to mount. Developed countries spend an \r\nalmost $1 billion daily on agricultural subsidies, which \r\nis three times more than they devote to ODA.  \r\n The number of persons with physical hunger has \r\nreached 852 million, and there are 876 million illiterate \r\nadults, whereas developed countries spend $17 billion \r\na year on pet food. Every year, 8 million children die \r\nbefore their first birthday and 19 million children under \r\nthe age of 5 die from curable diseases or from \r\nmalnutrition. Another 325 million children do not go to \r\nschool, while every year more than $1 trillion goes to \r\ncommercial advertising. Sixty per cent of the world’s \r\necosystems are being degraded or are unsustainably \r\nused. The availability of drinking water is 60 per cent \r\nof the 1970 levels, and at present we are 2.3 billion \r\nmore human beings than at that time. \r\n The persistence of an unfavourable international \r\neconomic environment and an unjust world order have \r\nbrought about this cruel and frightening panorama, \r\nincreasingly marginalizing developing countries. \r\nToday, it is more necessary than ever that developed \r\ncountries fulfil the commitments that they have \r\nundertaken at the major United Nations conferences \r\nand summits in the economic, social and related fields, \r\nincluding the Millennium Development Goals. Those \r\nshould no longer be treated as dead letter or mere \r\npolitical announcements aimed at diluting \r\nresponsibilities or delaying their fulfilment. \r\n If the negative effects of the imposition of the \r\nneoliberal model in a globalized world are not duly \r\naddressed, and the gap between the rich and the poor \r\ncontinues to increase, we will inevitably bear witness \r\nto further crises and conflicts. \r\n With just 10 per cent of the more than $1 trillion \r\ncurrently devoted to military expenditure, the very \r\n A/61/PV.56\r\n \r\n13 06-62233 \r\n \r\nmodest Millennium Goals could be achieved. \r\nUnfortunately, the industrialized world seems to be \r\nunaware of that fact and persists in its lack of political \r\nwill to make historic decisions that would solve the \r\nstructural inequalities of the international economic \r\nsystem, which is absolutely unsustainable. \r\n The solution to the problems that the developing \r\ncountries face today as a consequence of the unjust and \r\nunequal world economic order, and the preservation of \r\nnature and the human race itself, are issues that \r\nconcern the entire international community, without \r\ndistinction between rich and poor. It is imperative that \r\nwe all work within the context of true multilateral \r\ninternational cooperation based on the principles of \r\nsolidarity, complementarity and mutual benefits. \r\n We need the steadfast political will of the richest \r\ncountries to fulfil their commitments, which is \r\nundoubtedly the hugest challenge to overcome. Only \r\nthen will we be able to guarantee a true and just global \r\nassociation for development. \r\n Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): We \r\nmeet today to discuss the agenda item entitled \r\n“Integrated and coordinated implementation of and \r\nfollow-up to the outcomes of the major United Nations \r\nconferences and summits in the economic, social and \r\nrelated fields”. Egypt attaches high priority to that \r\nitem, and particularly to the issues of economic and \r\nsocial development, as they constitute the real measure \r\nof peoples’ abilities to achieve the desired development \r\nand address the changes and fluctuations that prevail in \r\ntoday’s world. \r\n In that regard, I wish to express my support for \r\nSouth Africa’s statement on behalf of the Group of 77 \r\nand China. I also wish to affirm the developing \r\ncountries’ high regard for the United Nations role and \r\nmandate in economic and social development and other \r\nrelated fields. That vital role represents the lion’s share \r\nof the United Nations activities, which cannot be \r\nsubstituted by any other role at any level, be it \r\nbilateral, regional or international. On that basis, we \r\noppose any attempt to shift that role outside the United \r\nNations to other realms dominated by politicization \r\nand conditionality, and we will work in coordination \r\nwith developing countries to counteract any such \r\nattempt. \r\n The adoption at the World Summit last June of \r\nthe resolution on development follow-up (resolution \r\n60/265) and the recent agreement on the draft \r\nresolution related to the strengthening of the Economic \r\nand Social Council, following intensive negotiations on \r\nboth texts, send a clear message and are proof of the \r\nstrength of international political will in those two \r\nareas, especially on the part of developing countries, to \r\npreserve the mandate of the United Nations in the area \r\nof sustainable development in a context of \r\nintergovernmental oversight, which we seek to be \r\ncharacterized by just representation and democratic \r\ndecisions adopted by the General Assembly and the \r\nEconomic and Social Council. \r\n Despite international recognition of the important \r\nrole of the United Nations in the field of development, \r\nmany of the Organization’s decisions and resolutions in \r\nthe social and economic fields continue to go \r\nunimplemented. \r\n Although we reached an agreed text after difficult \r\nnegotiations on the draft resolution on the \r\nstrengthening of the role of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil — including its provision of a necessary time \r\nframe for the Council to assume the new duties \r\nentrusted to it, its stipulations regarding the activation \r\nof the development cooperation forums and the annual \r\nministerial review, and its enhanced relationship with \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission — we look forward to \r\nincreased political will from our development partners \r\nin order to help the Council to undertake its new duties \r\nin an optimal manner, in conjunction with activating \r\nthe role of its other subsidiary organs, such as the \r\ntechnical committees, the regional commissions and \r\nthe Committee for Development Policy. \r\n With the adoption of the resolution on \r\nstrengthening the Economic and Social Council based \r\non the mandate given by the heads of State and \r\nGovernment at the 2005 Summit, it is important to \r\nstress the importance of activating the work of the \r\nessential subsidiary organs of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil within the same framework. In that regard, we \r\nwould refer in particular to the regional commissions, \r\ntaking into account the regional perspective of the \r\nprogrammes they conduct and the exceptional technical \r\nand administrative expertise they provide, as well as \r\nthe basis they represent for intergovernmental \r\ncooperation, which allows them to support the efforts \r\nof developing countries in the field of development. \r\nAccordingly, we support the activation and \r\ndevelopment of the commissions in order to counter \r\nefforts to reduce their role and terminate their mandate. \r\nA/61/PV.56  \r\n \r\n06-62233 14 \r\n \r\n In that regard, Egypt endorses the content of the \r\nSecretary-General’s report on the role of the Economic \r\nand Social Council in the integrated and coordinated \r\nimplementation of and follow-up to the outcomes of \r\nmajor United Nations conferences and summits, in \r\naccordance with General Assembly resolutions 50/227, \r\n52/12 B and 57/270 B, including encouraging the \r\ninteraction of regional commissions with the Economic \r\nand Social Council, increasing the contributions of the \r\ncommissions within the Council’s strengthened \r\nmandate, specifying obstacles of implementation and \r\noptimal practices, as well as deepening cooperation \r\namong the various regional commissions. \r\n We also agree with the Secretary-General’s report \r\nconcerning the importance of activating and enhancing \r\nintergovernmental dialogue between the Economic and \r\nSocial Council and the Breton Woods institutions. That \r\ndialogue should take into account the critical and \r\npivotal activities of the important subsidiary bodies \r\naffiliated to the Council. The draft resolution’s \r\nemphasis on strengthening the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil in that important relationship ushers in a new \r\nera of cooperation to the benefit of developing \r\ncountries. \r\n At the same time, we would like to express our \r\nsupport for the call in the Secretary-General’s report \r\nfor new and innovative approaches to encourage \r\nparticipation by civil society and the private sector in \r\ndeveloping countries and for their participation in the \r\npreparation of and follow-up to the annual ministerial \r\nreview and the development cooperation forums. The \r\nnon-governmental sector has an important role to play \r\nin supporting development activities, but it must not \r\nsupersede the role of Governments and should conform \r\nto the procedural and substantive rules of procedure \r\nthat govern the work of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil as an intergovernmental body. \r\n In addition to making use of existing \r\nmechanisms, efforts should be directed towards \r\nenhancing and activating a number of instruments and \r\nthemes whose implementation is considered equivalent \r\nto the implementation of the outcomes of United \r\nNations conferences in the economic and social fields. \r\nAmong those is the global partnership for development \r\nthe thematic title of the sixty-first session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, in addition to support for science \r\nand technology for development, and other thematic \r\nissues of high priority to developing countries, \r\nespecially those in Africa. \r\n The internationally agreed development goals, \r\nespecially the Millennium Development Goals, remain \r\nat the heart of the implementation of the United \r\nNations outcomes and decisions in the relevant \r\neconomic and social fields, as they embody a broad \r\nsection of issues and challenges periodically addressed \r\nby United Nations conferences in that context. The \r\nmodest progress achieved in this implementation to \r\ndate and the anticipated failure of many developing \r\ncountries to achieve MDG targets is strong evidence of \r\nthe deficiencies still dominating the implementation \r\nfollow-up process.  \r\n In this context, the delegation of Egypt would \r\nlike to emphasize the importance of implementing the \r\nobligations contained in the development follow-up \r\nresolution, which affirms the increase in resources \r\navailable to operational activities for development on a \r\ncontinued and predictable basis. This obligation has in \r\nfact not been translated into a real increase of \r\nresources, and that has adversely affected those \r\nactivities and diminished their role in achieving the \r\ninternational development goals. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that the \r\nreal essence of the process of implementing United \r\nNations decisions is embodied in the political will of \r\nMember States. The Economic and Social Council and \r\nits subsidiary mechanisms are only tools that reflect \r\nthis will, which if absent will not lead to any progress. \r\nThe developing countries are only demanding a just \r\nright to development, not only through assistance, but \r\nmore importantly through creating an appropriate \r\natmosphere and helpful circumstances conducive to the \r\nimplementation of their development policies \r\naccording to their priorities and needs. That would \r\nenhance their integration into the world economy as \r\neffective partners. It requires mutual trust among \r\ndeveloping countries and their development partners in \r\nthe developed world. It also necessitates the pursuit of \r\ncommon efforts to build and strengthen this trust and \r\nmake optimal use of it. \r\n Mr. Al-Shalhoub (Saudi Arabia) (spoke in \r\nArabic): I would like to express my thanks and \r\ngratitude to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his \r\nreport on the integrated and coordinated \r\nimplementation of and follow-up to the outcomes of \r\nthe major United Nations conferences and summits in \r\nthe economic, social and related fields (A/61/90), as \r\nwell as his note on the strengthening of the United \r\nNations and the follow-up to the outcomes of the \r\n A/61/PV.56\r\n \r\n15 06-62233 \r\n \r\nMillennium Summit and reforming the United Nations \r\n(A/61/383).  \r\n The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia views this as a \r\nvaluable opportunity to reaffirm the important role of \r\nthe United Nations in handling the new developments, \r\nand challenges of the twenty-first century. The \r\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia associates itself with the \r\nviews of the Group of 77 and China with regard to this \r\nissue.  \r\n The implementation of and follow-up to United \r\nNations conferences and summits requires good \r\nintentions, as well as mutual trust between all partners, \r\nand an understanding of the interests of every party in \r\nan atmosphere of constructive dialogue, equality and \r\nmutual understanding. The five-year review of those \r\nconferences that is conducted by the United Nations is \r\nevidence of the care and efforts of Member States to \r\ngarner broad support for the outcome of the United \r\nNations conferences, including the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs).  \r\n The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has participated \r\neffectively and positively in all United Nations \r\nsummits and conferences. In affirmation of its genuine \r\nbelief in the importance of international action and its \r\nkeenness to enhance such comprehensive efforts, Saudi \r\nArabia has joined many specialized organizations and \r\nratified numerous international agreements and \r\nconventions that have been concluded with the \r\nencouragement of and under the sponsorship of the \r\nUnited Nations. Such action reaffirms Saudi Arabia’s \r\nconstant quest to give precedence to the language of \r\ndialogue and objectivity as a main characteristic of \r\ninternational efforts to entrench the concept of peace \r\nand security among peoples. This in turn would speed \r\nup the achievement of constructive cooperation, \r\nsecurity and prosperity among all countries.  \r\n The enormous international changes and \r\nchallenges that the international community is facing \r\ntoday require us, in the context of the reform approach \r\nthat is prevailing at the United Nations, to reconsider \r\nthe Organization’s working methods and structure in \r\norder to enhance its abilities at peacemaking, not just \r\npeacekeeping. In this regard, the Kingdom of Saudi \r\nArabia supports reaching an international consensus on \r\nexpanding the Security Council and increasing \r\nequitability of distribution and transparency in its \r\nwork. Saudi Arabia also calls for activating \r\ncooperation between the organs of the United Nations, \r\nespecially the General Assembly, the Security Council \r\nand the Economic and Social Council.  \r\n Out of its conviction of the need to activate the \r\nwork of the United Nations and to improve its \r\nperformance and its organs, the Kingdom of Saudi \r\nArabia has participated effectively in current efforts \r\naimed at modernizing and stimulating United Nations \r\nbodies in a manner that will enable them to assume \r\ntheir roles at a level commensurate with the new \r\ndevelopments and changes that the world is \r\nexperiencing today.  \r\n The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia believes that the \r\nreform efforts that have taken hold of the United \r\nNations must not be viewed in an abstract manner. \r\nRather, they must be related to the issues that the \r\nUnited Nations deals with. In addition, we must take \r\ninto account the impact of the reforms or changes on \r\nthe effectiveness and performance of United Nations \r\nbodies — especially the Security Council, which is \r\ndirectly responsible for the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security.  \r\n There is no doubt that structural and \r\norganizational reforms with a view to raising the level \r\nof the Organization’s performance and effectiveness \r\nare needed immediately, so that the United Nations can \r\nundertake its responsibilities and bear its burdens. This \r\nis all tied to the political will of States to effectively \r\nimplement the principles, visions and expectations of \r\nthe United Nations. Those responsibilities include a \r\ntrue commitment to the decisions and \r\nrecommendations made by the United Nations and its \r\nconferences. Today more than ever, we need a United \r\nNations that is effective and able to undertake its duties \r\ntowards achieving international peace and security and  \r\nsustainable development and guaranteeing human \r\nrights within the framework of respect for the \r\ncharacteristics of diverse cultures and societies.  \r\n The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia affirms that the \r\ndangers and problems that face the world today are not \r\nlimited to only a few countries, since their effects and \r\nimpact are comprehensive in nature. This requires that \r\nwe consolidate the concepts of international \r\ncooperation, mutual interest and common \r\nresponsibility in an atmosphere of respect, equality and \r\ntrust in order to achieve humanity’s hope for a better \r\nfuture. This should be based on joint interests and \r\ncommon benefits, as well as on narrowing the gap in \r\nquantity and quality between the countries of North \r\nA/61/PV.56  \r\n \r\n06-62233 16 \r\n \r\nand South in the hope of creating one prosperous \r\nworld.  \r\n The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia affirms that there \r\ncan be no true development or economic prosperity or \r\npolitical stability in just one part of the world while the \r\nrest of the world suffers from poverty, famine, wars \r\nand conflict. Moreover, resorting to force and violence \r\nin settling disputes has wasted considerable financial \r\nand human resources and has unnecessarily depleted \r\nnatural resources. That has deepened economic and \r\nsocial underdevelopment, undermined human dignity, \r\nhindered development programmes and decreased the \r\nchances of achieving the MDGs by 2015, which has \r\nbeen decided. Moreover, it confirms the fact that there \r\ncan be no development without stability and no \r\nstability without total respect for the principles of \r\ninternational law, the adoption of dialogue and the \r\noptimal utilization of economic resources for the \r\ninterest of all peoples.  \r\n Mr. Liu Zhenmin (China): The Chinese \r\ndelegation supports the statement made by South \r\nAfrica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. In \r\n2005, world leaders gathered in New York and jointly \r\nreaffirmed that development is a central goal, thus \r\nreflecting the common aspiration of the people of the \r\nworld to achieve that goal. World leaders have made \r\nsolemn commitments to implementing the outcomes of \r\nthe major United Nations conferences and summits in \r\nthe economic, social and related fields and to realizing \r\nthe internationally agreed development goals, \r\nincluding the MDGs, in a timely manner. It is the \r\nunshirkable responsibility of all countries to maintain \r\nthat momentum and to vigorously promote \r\ninternational development cooperation. \r\n To achieve development involves a \r\ncomprehensive and multifaceted process, and the \r\noutcomes of major United Nations conferences and \r\nsummits in the economic and social fields will not \r\nmaterialize overnight. It is necessary to define key \r\nareas and set the order of priorities, so as to mobilize \r\nmaximum resources, achieve the best distribution of \r\nefforts and achieve the most desirable result. Thanks to \r\nthe joint efforts of all countries, the MDGs have \r\nreceived worldwide recognition and extensive support \r\nand their significance was reaffirmed by the World \r\nSummit in 2005. The focus of our attention should now \r\nbe turned to full implementation of the MDGs. \r\n Action at the national level is a pivotal link in the \r\nintegrated and coordinated implementation of the \r\noutcomes of the major United Nations conferences and \r\nsummits. There exists a wide spectrum of national \r\nconditions, and only by combining the consensus \r\nreached at international conferences with their own \r\nspecific national conditions can countries truly claim \r\nownership and thus act in an effective and relevant \r\nmanner. National Governments have the responsibility \r\nto employ the results of international consensus in their \r\nnational development strategies and to make those an \r\norganic part of their own development programmes. \r\n At the regional and international levels, \r\nconstructive dialogue should be encouraged to promote \r\nthe exchange of experiences, stimulate new ideas and \r\nbetter mobilize resources and the technical means to \r\nsupport national efforts towards the coordinated \r\nimplementation of their own development strategies. \r\n It is essential for the United Nations to continue \r\nto lead discussions on follow-up actions. It is therefore \r\nnecessary for the relevant United Nations meetings to \r\nbe pragmatic and action-oriented in their agendas and \r\nfind innovative ways of working. The related policy \r\ndiscussions should specify real policies, expand the \r\nconsensus and find shortcomings and weaknesses, so \r\nas to better mobilize and coordinate international \r\nactions. There should be better communication and \r\ncoordination among organizations and agencies to \r\nensure policy coherence and avoid contradiction and \r\noverlapping. \r\n Recent discussions on United Nations system-\r\nwide coherence have been very helpful. Worldwide \r\nattention and the extensive involvement of all social \r\nsectors are driving forces for international development \r\ncooperation. We should continue to encourage the \r\nprivate sector and civil society to play an important \r\nrole in implementing development goals. \r\n Effective global action needs the appropriate \r\norganizational guarantees. The Economic and Social \r\nCouncil, as the main organ within the United Nations \r\nsystem to promote economic and social development, \r\nhas a special advantage when pushing for the \r\nimplementation of the internationally agreed \r\ndevelopment goals. The 2005 World Summit provided \r\nthe Economic and Social Council with two major new \r\ntools — annual ministerial substantive reviews and \r\ndevelopment cooperation forums. We hope that the \r\nEconomic and Social Council and its subordinate \r\n A/61/PV.56\r\n \r\n17 06-62233 \r\n \r\nbodies will make good use of the opportunity to \r\nreinforce their functions and coordinate their work, so \r\nas to ensure coordinated follow-up to the outcomes of \r\nthe major conferences and summits. We are pleased to \r\nnote that the draft resolution on strengthening \r\nECOSOC has just been adopted (resolution 61/16). \r\n Integrated and coordinated implementation calls \r\nfor integrated and coordinated supervision. Currently, \r\nmany agencies, both within and outside the United \r\nNations system, have reviewed the progress made in \r\nachieving the development goals in their own specific \r\nfield, using inconsistent standards with limited \r\ninfluence. The resolution on follow-up to major United \r\nNations conferences and summits again emphasized the \r\nimportance of United Nations supervision and \r\nevaluation of progress in the implementation of \r\ndevelopment commitments. It is therefore necessary to \r\nestablish a unified and comprehensive framework led \r\nby the United Nations for the evaluation of progress on \r\nthe internationally agreed development goals. That \r\nwould measure national progress and would also \r\nmonitor and evaluate international cooperation and \r\ndevelopment aid. \r\n China has been a vigorous supporter and \r\npractitioner in the implementation of the outcomes of \r\nthe major United Nations conferences and summits in \r\nthe economic and social fields. We have made \r\nunswerving efforts to give development top priority, \r\npursue the people-oriented concept of scientific \r\ndevelopment, achieve comprehensive, coordinated and \r\nsustainable economic and social development and build \r\na harmonious society. We have attached great \r\nimportance to various international commitments, \r\ncarefully learned from the success of other countries, \r\nabsorbed useful concepts and methods and persisted in \r\nreform and innovation. As a result, the living standard \r\nof the Chinese people has improved by a fairly big \r\nmargin, which has also contributed to the realization of \r\ninternationally agreed global development goals. \r\n Three out of eight MDGs are directly linked to \r\nhealth issues. The realization of other goals is also \r\nclosely linked to the issue of public health. We have \r\nnoted that all countries, especially the developing \r\ncountries and countries in economic transition, are \r\nfaced with grave challenges in the field of public \r\nhealth. We welcome the various strategies on public \r\nhealth capacity-building contained in the report of the \r\nSecretary-General (A/61/383), including establishing \r\nan emergency response system and a global \r\nsurveillance and response system in accordance with \r\ninternational health regulations, increasing public \r\nawareness, strengthening public health resources, and \r\noffering the assistance of the World Health \r\nOrganization (WHO) and related international agencies \r\nto Member States. The Chinese delegation urges all \r\ncountries to give careful consideration to the relevant \r\nrecommendations in the report and fully implement \r\nthem on the basis of General Assembly resolution \r\n60/35. \r\n The Chinese Government has made the United \r\nNations debates on public health a priority. Over the \r\npast three years, China has initiated each year the draft \r\nresolution on strengthening capacity-building in public \r\nhealth. China supports the work of WHO in related \r\nareas. We have carried out extensive cooperation with \r\nWHO, the World Bank and the Asia-Pacific Economic \r\nCooperation concerning HIV/AIDS, malaria, severe \r\nacute respiratory syndrome and the pandemic \r\ninfluenza, avian flu, which is highly pathogenic to \r\nhumans as well as post-disaster rescue and treatment \r\nand disease control. \r\n In recent years, the Chinese Government has \r\ninvested enormously in public health capacity-\r\nbuilding. In October this year, President Hu Jintao \r\nstressed the need to build a national basic medical care \r\nnetwork covering both urban and rural residents, \r\nincluding improving public health and medical \r\nservices, as well as disease prevention and control, \r\npublic health supervision, emergency response to \r\noutbreaks of public health incidents, accelerating the \r\ndevelopment of medical undertakings in the western \r\npart and the rural areas of China, and reinforcing urban \r\ncommunity medical services so as to achieve the goal \r\nof a basic health-care service that is enjoyed by all. \r\nThat goal is in line with the goal of WHO — Health for \r\nAll. China is ready and willing to work with other \r\nStates to support the work of the World Health \r\nOrganization (WHO) and other related agencies in \r\nenhancing capacity-building in the area of global \r\npublic health. \r\n Mr. Baba-Ahmed (Nigeria): Nigeria aligns itself \r\nwith the statement of South Africa on behalf of the \r\nGroup of 77.  \r\n It is gratifying that the major United Nations \r\nconferences and summits have helped to shape our \r\nunderstanding and pursuit of development, while their \r\nvarious outcomes have provided the framework for \r\nA/61/PV.56  \r\n \r\n06-62233 18 \r\n \r\ncollective action. At the 2005 Summit, our leaders not \r\nonly recognized the valuable role of those conferences \r\nand summits in mobilizing the international \r\ncommunity, but also committed themselves to establish \r\na just and lasting peace throughout the world in \r\naccordance with the purposes and principles of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter. The integrated and coordinated \r\nimplementation of and follow-up to the outcomes of \r\nthe major United Nations conferences and summits in \r\nthe economic, social and related fields holds the key to \r\nthe full realization of all internationally agreed \r\ndevelopment goals, including the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). \r\n Barely two weeks ago, we exchanged views \r\ninformally in this very Hall on the report of the \r\nSecretary-General’s Panel on United Nations System-\r\nwide Coherence in the Areas of Development, \r\nHumanitarian Assistance and the Environment. \r\nConsistent with what we Member States have long \r\nrecognized, the Panel underscored the linkage between \r\npeace, development, security and the environment. An \r\nintegrated, coordinated and holistic implementation is \r\ntherefore necessary for the translation into concrete \r\naction of the lofty ideas and promises that have \r\nemerged from the major United Nations conferences \r\nand summits in order to fulfil the aspirations of the \r\npeoples we represent, especially the poor and \r\nvulnerable among them. \r\n Our debate today must once again focus attention \r\non the need for the full and timely implementation of \r\nand follow-up to our collective commitments entered \r\ninto at the various conferences and summits. Fittingly, \r\nthe internationally agreed development goals provide a \r\nyardstick to measure and evaluate progress using the \r\ninstrumentality of the legislative mandates and \r\nintergovernmental processes at our disposal. Here, the \r\nrole of the United Nations as the epitome of \r\nmultilateralism, and in particular the Economic and \r\nSocial Council, including its funds, programmes and \r\nfunctional commissions, cannot be overemphasized. \r\n In his report (A/61/90) submitted to the \r\nEconomic and Social Council and to the Assembly, the \r\nSecretary-General identified the opportunities as well \r\nas the challenges in the context of advancing progress \r\nin the implementation of internationally agreed \r\ndevelopment goals. The role of the Council as the \r\ncentral body for coordination, policy review and \r\ndialogue on development cooperation will no doubt \r\nneed to be strengthened. The agreement reached on the \r\nfinal text of draft resolution A/61/L.24 on the \r\nstrengthening of the Economic and Social Council \r\npaves the way for that process. Nigeria is pleased that \r\nMember States were able to reach consensus on that \r\nimportant resolution and hopes that speedy measures \r\nwill be to taken to give effect to its broad provisions in \r\norder to enable the Council to perform its expanded \r\nfunctions. \r\n The new architecture approved in the 2005 World \r\nSummit Outcome Document regarding the annual \r\nministerial review and Development Cooperation \r\nForum is a challenge to us all. We need to significantly \r\nchange the way we do things and aim to achieve better \r\nresults. We must work vigorously and deliberately to \r\npromote greater convergence between \r\nintergovernmental processes and United Nations \r\nsystem activities for development. It is only by so \r\ndoing that we can accelerate the implementation and \r\nrealization of the objectives of internationally agreed \r\ndevelopment goals, secure coherence in policies and \r\npromote a global partnership for development. \r\n Indeed, while resolutions 50/227 and 57/270 B \r\ndefine the parameters for follow-up to the various \r\nUnited Nations conferences and summits, Nigeria \r\nshares the Secretary-General’s view that progress has \r\nbeen slow in adopting an all-encompassing \r\ndevelopment strategy that takes into account the \r\nlinkages between the different conference outcomes. \r\nWithout a doubt, there is a linkage between the issues \r\nthat have emerged from the various conferences and \r\nsummits. The international community must not just \r\npay lip service to the notion of a shared vision of \r\ndevelopment, but must act in unison in pursuit of a \r\ncommon goal, that is, the provision of a better life for \r\nall peoples, as envisioned in the Charter. \r\n Nigeria looks forward to Member States working \r\nwith the United Nations system to promote \r\ndevelopment as a universal goal. In that regard, cross-\r\nsectoral rather than sectoral strategies will be required \r\nto address issues that cut across the major United \r\nNations conferences and summits. In the same way, \r\nefforts must be made to enable the various elements of \r\nthe United Nations system to deliver as one. It was \r\nwith a view to promoting such an approach that \r\nNigeria built and donated the United Nations House in \r\nAbuja in order to bring the various United Nations \r\nentities under one roof. We are not, however, \r\nunmindful of the challenges and difficulties inherent in \r\nhaving one United Nations country team, one country \r\n A/61/PV.56\r\n \r\n19 06-62233 \r\n \r\nprogramme, one budget and one leader. We hope that \r\nthe discussions and negotiations that will soon ensue in \r\nthe Assembly will help to identify ways to meet the \r\nchallenges and surmount the difficulties. \r\n It is paramount that concrete action be taken to \r\nhelp countries achieve the goals and targets of their \r\nnationally owned and driven development strategies. \r\nThe first session of the annual ministerial review, for \r\ninstance, will undoubtedly reveal that six years after \r\nthe Millennium Summit, sub-Saharan Africa is not on \r\ncourse to achieve the MDGs. Rather, the proportion of \r\npeople living in extreme poverty on the continent is on \r\nthe increase. Similarly, there has been a steady increase \r\nin the incidence of HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis \r\nand other communicable and non-communicable \r\ndiseases. \r\n As the continent grapples with its myriad \r\nchallenges, Africa’s capacity to pull itself up by its \r\nown bootstraps is severely constrained by, inter alia, its \r\nexcruciating debt burden, lack of market access, poor \r\ninfrastructure and limited capital flows. Though the \r\nvarious measures and initiatives taken — such as the \r\nprovision of debt relief, increased official development \r\nassistance and greater engagement by development \r\npartners with the continent — are commendable, more \r\nneeds to be done to meet the special and peculiar needs \r\nof Africa. That is an area in which Nigeria hopes the \r\nbiennial Development Cooperation Forum will help \r\nkeep Africa on the global radar and mobilize the \r\nrequisite resources for the implementation and \r\nrealization of the internationally agreed development \r\ngoals, as well as the objectives of Africa’s flagship \r\ninitiative, the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD). \r\n Reporting on our activities, assessing results, \r\nsharing experiences — including best practices and \r\nchallenges — in a coherent manner will influence the \r\nstrategies, policies and tools we use for the \r\nimplementation of and follow-up to our commitments. \r\nThe United Nations system, especially its functional \r\ncommissions, funds and programmes, including the \r\nregional commissions and other relevant regional \r\ninstitutions, must assist in implementation and follow-\r\nup activities. In that regard, Nigeria is concerned that \r\nalthough the functional commissions are playing \r\ncrucial roles in relation to the follow-up to \r\nconferences, cooperation between them is limited and \r\nprogress in ensuring linkages in the processes is \r\ninsufficient. \r\n A weak United Nations cannot adequately serve \r\nthe cause of development. We recognize that the \r\nUnited Nations is, essentially, a service provider and a \r\nchief advocate. Member States are the financiers, \r\npolicymakers and consumers of its services. Its \r\nstrength, therefore, depends to a large extent on the \r\ninvestment that we make in it.  \r\n In that regard, Nigeria believes that it is our \r\ncollective Charter obligation to provide resources \r\nsufficient for the implementation of all mandates that \r\nMember States have entrusted to the Secretary-General \r\nand his team. These reforms must cut across all the \r\nprincipal organs of the United Nations in order to make \r\nthe Organization more efficient, effective and \r\nresponsive to current challenges. Furthermore, the \r\nreforms must not be viewed from the narrow \r\nperspective of cost-cutting. Rather, we should examine \r\ncarefully all the measures called for and agree on the \r\nneed to allocate new resources, where necessary, for \r\ntheir full implementation. \r\n Nigeria also believes that the success of any \r\nSecretariat and management reform depends on \r\ntransparent accountability measures anchored in an \r\nefficient internal system of administration of justice. \r\nMoreover, the reforms must be supportive of, rather \r\nthan detrimental to, the United Nations development \r\nagenda in its totality. In that regard, resources must be \r\nprovided for the full implementation of all agreed \r\nreform activities, including those in support of the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development. Similarly, the \r\nSecretariat and other entities within the United Nations \r\nsystem should reflect in their composition, at all levels, \r\nthe international character of the Organization. \r\n Nigeria supports the strengthening of the General \r\nAssembly and the focusing of its agenda on global \r\npriorities and substantive issues of the day. We share \r\nthe view that the position and role of the President of \r\nthe General Assembly need to be strengthened. We are \r\nstudying carefully the division of labour between the \r\nGeneral Assembly — essentially its Second and Third \r\nCommittees — and the Economic and Social Council. \r\nIn determining our position, we will take into account \r\nthe lessons learned from the findings on how the \r\nEconomic and Social Council performs its expanded \r\nfunctions. \r\n Nigeria’s position on reform of the Security \r\nCouncil is very well known. Suffice it to say that \r\nreform of the Council to make its decisions more \r\nA/61/PV.56  \r\n \r\n06-62233 20 \r\n \r\nlegitimate and transparent is overdue and urgent. \r\nReforms at the United Nations would be incomplete \r\nwithout expanding the size and composition of the \r\npermanent membership of the Security Council.  \r\n Representation for Africa in that category is \r\nnecessary to achieve inclusiveness and give effect to \r\nthe wishes and aspirations of the people of the African \r\ncontinent. Indeed, Africa occupies centre stage in the \r\nSecurity Council’s activities and thus needs to \r\ncontribute its perspective to the work of the Council. \r\nNigeria thus calls for concrete efforts to reform the \r\nSecurity Council and, in particular, to give Africa \r\nrepresentation in the permanent Council membership. \r\n In the final analysis, we will bear responsibility \r\nin the court of humanity for the actions that we take, or \r\nfail to take, to promote better standards of life in larger \r\nfreedom for the peoples of the world. \r\n Mr. Rachkov (Belarus): The delegation of \r\nBelarus welcomes the successful conclusion of the \r\nnegotiating process on a resolution of the utmost \r\nimportance: that on strengthening of the Economic and \r\nSocial Council. We commend the tireless efforts of the \r\nCo-Chairs, Ambassador Johan C. Verbeke of Belgium \r\nand Ambassador Cheick Sidi Diarra of Mali, to bring \r\nus to the remarkable outcome of the consultations. \r\n It gives us great pleasure to note that this \r\nresolution contains a number of important provisions \r\nand ideas that could enhance the potential of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council to improve coordination \r\nwithin the United Nations system and to enhance the \r\neffectiveness of United Nations efforts to support the \r\nprogress made by developing countries and countries \r\nwith transitional economies in achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, thus promoting \r\neconomic growth and social progress throughout the \r\nworld.  \r\n We would like to highlight just a few of those \r\nideas, such as adopting a ministerial declaration as an \r\noutcome of the high-level segment of the substantive \r\nsession; providing an opportunity for countries to make \r\nvoluntary national presentations within the framework \r\nof annual ministerial-level substantive reviews; \r\nestablishing a multi-year programme of work for the \r\nministerial-level substantive reviews, and convening ad \r\nhoc meetings of the Economic and Social Council on \r\nhumanitarian emergencies. Belarus was an active \r\nadvocate of those important elements of Council \r\nreform during the entire negotiating process. We are \r\npleased to see them in the resolution. \r\n What is also significant is that the resolution is an \r\nimportant step towards ensuring appropriate financial \r\nand administrative support for the work of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council to facilitate the \r\nfulfilment of its newly assigned responsibility for \r\norganizing the annual ministerial reviews and the \r\nDevelopment Cooperation Forum, as well as to hold ad \r\nhoc meetings. \r\n We believe in the strengthened Economic and \r\nSocial Council. We believe in its ability to effectively \r\norganize the international support so needed by \r\ncountries fighting against poverty, hunger, social \r\ninequality, environmental degradation, vulnerability to \r\nnatural disasters and dangerous infectious diseases. As \r\na member of the Council for the term 2007-2009, \r\nBelarus will do its best to contribute significantly to \r\nthe successful fulfilment of the Council’s tasks. \r\n Mr. Atiyanto (Indonesia): First of all, through \r\nyou, Madam President, I should like to thank the \r\nSecretary-General for his report (A/61/90) on the role \r\nof the Economic and Social Council in the integrated \r\nand coordinated implementation of the outcomes of \r\nand follow-up to major United Nations conferences and \r\nsummits, in the light of General Assembly resolutions \r\n50/227, 52/12 B and 57/270 B. In that context, \r\nIndonesia fully aligns itself with the statement made by \r\nthe Permanent Representative of South Africa on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China, especially in \r\nwelcoming the adoption of resolution 61/16, on the \r\nstrengthening of the Economic and Social Council.  \r\n Time and again, we have discussed the issue of \r\nintegrated and coordinated implementation of and \r\nfollow-up to the outcomes of the major United Nations \r\nconferences and summits in the economic, social and \r\nrelated fields. However, the truth of the matter is that \r\none third of the world’s population still lives in \r\npoverty. We need to make progress. \r\n It is in that context that we welcome the adoption \r\nof the long-awaited resolution on the strengthening of \r\nthe Economic and Social Council, which will enable \r\nthe Council to perform its role in accordance with the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and the relevant \r\nresolutions of the General Assembly, including \r\nresolution 60/1, especially paragraph 155. It will also \r\nenable the Council to start adapting the organization of \r\nits agenda and methods of work. In that way, the \r\n A/61/PV.56\r\n \r\n21 06-62233 \r\n \r\nCouncil will be in a better position to facilitate and \r\ncontribute to the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals.  \r\n Furthermore, the Council is also now better \r\nequipped to address the current challenges of \r\ndevelopment, particularly on issues related to poverty; \r\nmalnutrition and hunger; such pandemic diseases as \r\navian influenza, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and \r\npolio; and natural disasters.  \r\n In our view, by maintaining the current \r\nsegmented structure of its substantive session, the work \r\nof the Economic and Social Council will not be \r\ndisrupted. Meanwhile, the convening of the biennial \r\nhigh-level development cooperation forums and annual \r\nministerial substantive reviews as part of the high-level \r\nsegment will strengthen the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil to ensure integrated and coordinated follow-up \r\nto the outcomes of the major United Nations \r\nconferences and summits in the economic, social and \r\nrelated fields.  \r\n We also support the reaffirmation of the role of \r\nthe Economic and Social Council in providing overall \r\ncoordination and guidance so as to ensure coherence \r\nand avoid the duplication of mandates and activities \r\namong United Nations funds and programmes. We also \r\nwelcome the recognition of the important link between \r\nthe work of the Economic and Social Council and the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission. \r\n As one of the countries affected by the Indian \r\nOcean earthquake and tsunami, we are encouraged to \r\nnote that, by this resolution, the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil will have a more enhanced role in addressing \r\nhumanitarian emergencies, including natural disasters, \r\nupon the request of affected Member States. That will \r\nhelp to raise awareness and promote the engagement of \r\nall stakeholders in support of international relief \r\nefforts. \r\n My delegation looks forward to the \r\nimplementation of the spirit and letter of the resolution. \r\nTherefore, it is also critically important to ensure that \r\nthe Economic and Social Council, as a Charter body, \r\nreceives sufficient provision of conference services and \r\nsubstantive support to perform its functions, including \r\nits newly assigned responsibilities, as mandated by the \r\n2005 World Summit. \r\n Mr. Sen (India): We thank the Secretary-General \r\nfor his reports on the integrated and coordinated \r\nimplementation of and follow-up to the outcomes of \r\nthe major United Nations conferences and summits in \r\nthe economic, social and related fields.  \r\n We have to ensure the dialectic of the \r\nimplementation of those conferences in order to look at \r\nthe outcomes in a coordinated way and, at the same \r\ntime, to follow the individual outcomes of each \r\nconference. That is something that has been on the \r\nUnited Nations agenda for a long time, and indeed \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 57/270 B also clearly \r\nemphasizes the need for such coordinated and \r\nintegrated follow-up and implementation.  \r\n The primary element here, as we can see from the \r\nagenda item of the debate itself, is the issue of \r\nimplementation. That, I think, is the sine qua non of \r\neverything in the item, because, incidentally, the issue \r\nof implementation has also been on the agendas of both \r\nthe Economic and Social Council and the General \r\nAssembly for some time, and is emphasized in \r\nresolution 57/270 B. It was also emphasized in the \r\nWorld Summit outcome that we all know and, more \r\nrecently, in General Assembly resolution 60/265 on \r\ndevelopment, which emphasizes the need to implement \r\nthe global partnership for development — which, \r\nincidentally, is also encapsulated in Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goal 8. \r\n Apart from implementation, what are the key \r\nissues that confront us here? As far as we can see, \r\nimplementation has also to be interpreted broadly to \r\ninclude resources, because resources are the key. We \r\ntouched on some of those issues when the resolution on \r\nthe strengthening of the Economic and Social Council \r\nwas adopted earlier this morning. \r\n Apart from that, we clearly need to look at the \r\nworld outside and at the developments that are taking \r\nplace in the economic and social fields outside, \r\nbecause that which is unclear has to be made clear. \r\nThat which is partial has to be made complete, and that \r\ncan be done only in terms of implementation in the \r\ncontext of a close examination of what is happening \r\noutside in the real world. \r\n Last but not least, we need to take up the \r\nunfinished agenda of United Nations reform. The \r\nglobal economy today is characterized, on the one \r\nhand, by multinational corporations, whereby \r\nproduction takes place in several countries, as we all \r\nknow, and, on the other, by financial exchanges and \r\ntransfers that have totally outstripped the exchange of \r\nA/61/PV.56  \r\n \r\n06-62233 22 \r\n \r\nreal goods and services. The Bretton Woods institutions \r\nand the World Trade Organization (WTO) have become \r\nthe global framework, the institutional base, for those \r\ntransactions, which are often simply a search for \r\nspeculative profits. Those profits are underpinned by \r\nthe rules of many of those international institutions. \r\nTherefore, we need to look at the policies of those \r\ninstitutions. It is in that context that we emphasize the \r\nneed for the Economic and Social Council to carry out \r\nits mandate by periodically assessing international \r\neconomic policies, including the policies of those \r\ninstitutions. \r\n We all know, to take one example, that the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund has diverged greatly, just \r\nas the WTO has, from the original Keynesian mandate. \r\nToday, we have a situation in which it has been \r\ninvolved in countries on the eve of civil conflict, and \r\nthey have in fact plunged deeper into conflict. It has \r\noffered bail-out packages in crises, but those packages \r\nhave not bailed out the beneficiaries and have, in fact, \r\nsometimes made the crisis worse. On the other hand, \r\nwe also need to examine, as several economists have \r\nmaintained, the equity of having a bail-out package for \r\ninternational banks and for the rich, but not for those \r\nwho are living on subsidized food.  \r\n Similarly, I think that, in the case of the WTO, we \r\nhave a situation in the world in which — as we saw \r\nquite clearly at Doha — the entire consensus is that we \r\nshould look at borders as not being important for the \r\nfree exchange of goods and the free exchange and \r\nmovement of services. But when it comes to labour or \r\ntechnology flows, we are told a different story. That is \r\none of the reasons that Doha failed. \r\n Similarly, we are told that subsidies are a very \r\nbad thing in the industrial sector, but it is quite a \r\ndifferent story when it comes to agricultural subsidies. \r\nThe property and patent rights of the holders of \r\nintellectual property rights are sacred, but when it \r\ncomes to defending the interests of the biodiversity of \r\ndeveloping countries, then again it is another story. \r\nWhen it comes to protecting their biogenetic resources, \r\nwe are told that we have to wait awhile. Therefore, if \r\nimplementation is to be worthwhile and if the build-up \r\nthat we require on the outcomes of these conferences is \r\nto have meaning, then they must be geared to the real \r\nworld outside.  \r\n That is also true in the case of the question of \r\nemployment. The third pillar of the original Bretton \r\nWoods triad was the International Trade Organization \r\n(ITO). Its agenda stated clearly that we need to look \r\nnot only at getting prices right or liberalizing trade as a \r\nmeans of maximizing welfare, but also at positive \r\naction on employment itself, without which we cannot \r\nreally have an outcome which would be in the interest \r\nof the broad majority of the world.  \r\n Similarly, in this context, it is very important that \r\nwe also look at the implementation of the official \r\ndevelopment assistance target of 0.7 per cent of gross \r\nnational income, because there are any number of \r\ndeveloping countries, in particular in Africa, where \r\nthere is simply not the physical infrastructure or the \r\ninstitutions necessary for attracting private investment. \r\nTo talk of private enterprise in this context is thus as \r\nirrelevant as to talk of private enterprise in, for \r\nexample, the context of pickpockets. A pickpocket is \r\nalso a champion of private enterprise. Bringing in \r\nmajor corporations is simply to endow the pickpocket \r\nwith some of the virtues of a pirate; this does not really \r\nhelp. Therefore, I think the question of implementation \r\nand of clarifying what is unclear and building on what \r\nhas been done has to be seen in the context of these \r\ndevelopments in the real world. \r\n Similarly, the Economic and Social Council that \r\nwe have set up has the resources, and we hope that \r\nthese resources will not simply be based continually \r\nand forever on savings elsewhere so that there are no \r\nimplications calling for extra resources. But ultimately, \r\nif the Economic and Social Council is truly to do some \r\nof these things and if it is to be a Charter body in the \r\nreal sense of the word, then, quite clearly, future \r\nbudgeting would have to look at this issue very \r\ncarefully. We are also happy about the Council’s role \r\non issues of post-conflict resolution, which is \r\nsomething that will be of great benefit to many \r\ndeveloping countries. \r\n In the case of the reform of management, we find \r\nthat some of the reports commissioned at great cost \r\nhave once again brought in discredited ideas like \r\ngovernance. In fact, if you look at it, that is the greatest \r\nencroachment of all, because it is an attempt, through \r\ngovernance, to recreate the General Assembly and its \r\nFifth Committee in the image of the Security Council, \r\nwhere there exists the dominance of a few.  \r\n I believe that, in implementing the outcomes, we \r\nneed to bear some of those aspects in mind. \r\n A/61/PV.56\r\n \r\n23 06-62233 \r\n \r\n With regard to the General Assembly itself, \r\nwhich is the main Charter body and the chief \r\ndeliberative organ of the United Nations, we have said \r\nmany times that the Assembly must be reinvested with \r\nthe powers that it has under the Charter. There has to \r\nbe an equitable and fair balance among the different \r\norgans: the Security Council, the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil and the General Assembly. Now, one may say \r\nthat part of the reason why the General Assembly has \r\nweakened is the encroachment, but then one needs to \r\nask why the encroachment exists. Encroachment takes \r\nplace because so far the General Assembly has really \r\nconcentrated on procedural measures in large part, \r\nrather than on substantive measures. Therefore, as part \r\nof the implementation, it is also necessary to \r\nimplement resolution 60/286, adopted at the sixtieth \r\nsession on the revitalization of the General Assembly. \r\nThis implementation would be a part of the \r\nrevitalization itself.  \r\n But, again, this revitalization is something that \r\nwould not be complete until substantive issues were \r\naddressed. For this, there is a clear case for once again \r\nsetting up the Ad Hoc Working Group on the \r\nRevitalization of the General Assembly so that issues \r\nsuch as peace and security, development, management, \r\nincluding human resources management, and the \r\ncodification and development of international law are \r\ntaken up in a manner that is in the interest of all the \r\ncountries in this Organization. \r\n Last but not least, I think I mentioned the \r\nquestion of the unfinished agenda. Here, it is important \r\nto take up the reform of the Security Council itself as \r\nwell. We do not look upon this in terms of power at all. \r\nIt is not a question of power, but of public reason and \r\nequity, and not necessarily a question of politics, but of \r\nethics, because without reform of the Security Council, \r\nwe would have a reform that was like Hamlet without \r\nthe Prince of Denmark. It would not touch the essential \r\ncorrelations of power, and without that, the outcome \r\nwill not be optimal. We currently have a situation \r\nwhere there is one veto in the International Monetary \r\nFund and five vetoes in the Security Council without \r\nany kind of countervailing power vested in other \r\ncountries to bring a measure of optimality into the \r\ndecision-making. Without that, we will not be able to \r\nensure even that economic decision-making is optimal, \r\nlet alone political or social decision-making.  \r\n India has always maintained that we need an \r\nequitable, a fair and just balance between the Security \r\nCouncil and the General Assembly. We need a Security \r\nCouncil which, for the sake of its own interests, rests \r\non a broad base of support in the General Assembly. \r\nFor this, the General Assembly must be strong. In \r\nanother forum, I recently paraphrased some words of \r\nRobespierre which are relevant here — that power \r\nwithout virtue is pernicious but virtue without power is \r\nimpotent. We therefore request this balance to have \r\ntruly optimal decisions, and to have genuine, integrated \r\nand coordinated implementation of outcomes of \r\nconferences. Otherwise, the only follow-up to \r\nconferences will be to have more conferences. If we \r\nare to avoid this, such balance is necessary, and for that \r\nsome practical will is important. Ultimately, it is a \r\nquestion of political will. Political will is necessary to \r\ntransform any thought or idea into the practical energy \r\nof reform. This is the only law of thermodynamics that \r\nthe United Nations needs.  \r\n It was a citizen of our host country and the first \r\nUnited Nations official to get a Nobel Peace Prize, \r\nRalph Bunche, who said, if I remember correctly, that \r\nthe United Nations has no vested interest in the status \r\nquo. We thus cannot allow vested interests to ensure \r\nthat we remain committed to the status quo. We have to \r\novercome this and move beyond the status quo to \r\ncreate a real institution that would make the United \r\nNations once again a part of and a rallying point for the \r\nvast majority of countries, in fact for all the countries \r\nin the world.  \r\n To end, I would like to cite some of the very \r\nmoving words that were used at a conference in New \r\nDelhi recently, we do not look upon our work as \r\nsomething couched in the framework of power, but as \r\nsomething that is couched in the framework of \r\ninternational justice and equity. Therefore, in applying \r\nthese words, we need to work for a United Nations that \r\nis not dominated by division, power and military \r\nmight, but a United Nations that genuinely becomes a \r\nglobal force for peace, prosperity and progress. \r\n The President: In accordance with resolution \r\n57/32, of 19 November 2002, I now call on the \r\nobserver for the Inter-Parliamentary Union. \r\n Mrs. Filip (Inter-Parliamentary Union): Because \r\nof the lateness of the hour, I will shorten my statement. \r\nHowever, the full text will be distributed in the Hall. \r\n I am pleased to address the General Assembly on \r\nagenda item 112, which relates to strengthening the \r\nUnited Nations system. It will come as no surprise that \r\nA/61/PV.56  \r\n \r\n06-62233 24 \r\n \r\nI will refer to this theme from the perspective of the \r\nconsolidated parliamentary dimension of the work of \r\nthe United Nations. As resolution 61/6, adopted by \r\nconsensus in this Hall on 20 October, attests, the \r\nUnited Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union \r\n(IPU) are working together on virtually every item on \r\nthe agenda for peace, democracy and development. The \r\nconcern with democracy, in particular, is central to our \r\njoint action, as we saw very recently in Doha at the \r\nsixth International Conference on New and Restored \r\nDemocracies.  \r\n Democracy, together with development, is the \r\nbest defence against conflict and the best guarantee for \r\nlasting peace. The recent memorandum of \r\nunderstanding between the United Nations Democracy \r\nFund and the IPU, and the close consultations under \r\nway with the United Nations Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, augur well for increased cooperation in \r\nthis area for the years to come. \r\n The resolution also calls for the further \r\ndevelopment of the annual parliamentary hearing and \r\nother specialized parliamentary meetings at the United \r\nNations, as joint United Nations-IPU events. The \r\nformal recognition of the joint nature of those events \r\nwill require the United Nations to take partial \r\nownership of them, and eventually fully integrate them \r\ninto the overall agenda and meeting schedule of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n Moreover, resolution 61/6 states, in paragraph 8, \r\nthat the IPU is now invited to be more closely involved \r\nin the elaboration of system-wide strategies for \r\nconsideration by the United Nations “with a view to \r\nensuring greater and more coherent support by \r\nparliaments to the work of the United Nations”. That \r\nprovision will help us to improve the coordination of \r\nour respective operational activities so that we can \r\nbetter support each other in the field. It will also help \r\nus to plan future activities in the light of the \r\nrecommendations that may come out of the annual \r\nhearing and other specialized meetings. \r\n How does this relate to the strengthening of the \r\nUnited Nations system? First and foremost, let me \r\nremind the Assembly what we mean by the \r\nparliamentary dimension of the United Nations. That \r\ndimension must be forged by parliaments and their \r\nmembers. It has to be firmly rooted in the activities \r\nthat parliaments carry out at the national level — at \r\nhome. It includes action by parliaments to contribute to \r\nand monitor international negotiations and debates at \r\nthe United Nations and in related agencies, to oversee \r\nthe enforcement of what is adopted by Governments \r\nand to ensure national compliance with international \r\nnorms and the rule of law. It also involves scrutinizing \r\nthe activities of the United Nations and providing input \r\nfor their deliberations. \r\n The IPU is convinced that members of \r\nparliaments can play an extremely important role in \r\nbuilding national political support for international \r\naction. In the IPU’s view — which is shared by many \r\nUnited Nations Member States — the United Nations \r\nstands to gain considerably by making sure that \r\nparliaments and their members have a full and \r\nundistorted understanding of major processes and \r\nactivities under way at the United Nations. We have \r\nput forward a series of proposals relating to how we \r\nbelieve this can be best achieved. \r\n The 2006 parliamentary hearing held at the \r\nbeginning of last week in the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil Chamber was, we feel, a very positive \r\nindication that that is, indeed, possible. The meeting \r\nbenefited from the tremendous interest of national \r\nparliaments, which were well represented. It also drew \r\nin many representatives from the Permanent Missions, \r\nincluding Permanent Representatives, as well as United \r\nNations officials and representatives of academia. \r\nThere was a substantive and interactive discussion of \r\nissues that are high on the United Nations agenda — \r\nconflict prevention, peacebuilding, good governance \r\nand the fight against corruption — which resulted in a \r\nnumber of proposals for action by parliaments at the \r\nnational level, in support of United Nations initiatives. \r\nThe results of the hearing will be circulated at the \r\nUnited Nations in the coming weeks, as an official \r\ndocument of the General Assembly. \r\n I would like to provide just one example of what \r\ncame out of the hearing. Participating legislators very \r\nmuch welcomed the opportunity to learn about the new \r\nUnited Nations Peacebuilding Commission and its \r\nmandate and operational expectations. They stressed \r\nthe need for the Commission to focus in particular on \r\nthe institution of parliament. All too often in the past, \r\nthey argued, the international community invested huge \r\namounts of resources and funds in preparing for free \r\nand fair elections, only to abandon almost immediately \r\nthe very institution that was born out of the respective \r\nelections.  \r\n A/61/PV.56\r\n \r\n25 06-62233 \r\n \r\n Parliament, I think we all agree, is the forum \r\ndesigned to bring together all the various groups within \r\nsociety, and work within parliament therefore provides \r\na very real alternative to war. But a new, embryonic \r\nparliament does not run itself; it needs to be nurtured, \r\nand — in the early years, at least — it needs to receive \r\nas much assistance as possible, first and foremost from \r\nthe international community. \r\n In discussing the Peacebuilding Commission, \r\nparticipants repeatedly stressed the need for adequate \r\nfinancing of the Peacebuilding Fund, and pledged to \r\ntake that message back home to their capitals, with a \r\nview to building greater political support for the Fund. \r\nMore generally, they felt that parliaments could play an \r\nimportant role in bridging the divide between \r\npeacebuilding and development assistance. They called \r\nattention to the danger of relapse into conflict, which \r\nshould not be ignored. They emphasized the crucial \r\nimportance of involving women in all aspects of the \r\npeacebuilding exercise, and pledged to play a more \r\nproactive role in the implementation of Security \r\nCouncil resolution 1325 (2000). In particular, they \r\nargued strongly in favour of placing democratically \r\nelected parliaments high among the priorities of the \r\nUnited Nations Peacebuilding Commission. \r\n Those are just some of the ways in which the IPU \r\nintends to continue to work in the years to come, and in \r\nso doing help strengthen the United Nations system.  \r\n The President: We have heard the last speaker in \r\nthe debate on this item. \r\n The General Assembly has thus concluded this \r\nstage of its consideration of agenda items 47, 112, 113 \r\nand 149. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 150 \r\n \r\nInternational Year of Reconciliation, 2009 \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/61/L.22) \r\n \r\n The President: I give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Nicaragua to introduce draft \r\nresolution A/61/L.22. \r\n Mr. Sevilla Somoza (Nicaragua) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): The world today is one in which many actors \r\nand forces intersect. It is a world where new problems \r\nand contradictions are emerging and old ones are \r\nreappearing, where conflicts of all kinds arise as a \r\nresult of a variety of causes, where environmental \r\ncrisis seems inevitable and where the scourges of \r\nhunger and pandemics afflict all of our peoples. \r\nProclaiming 2009 as the International Year of \r\nReconciliation is a way of seeking universal \r\nreconciliation, on the basis of solidarity, brotherhood \r\nand the enshrined values and principles of freedom, \r\njustice, peace, non-discrimination, democracy, \r\ndevelopment and human rights — the very pillars that \r\nsupport the United Nations. \r\n If we proclaim reconciliation as the path leading \r\nto the achievement of world peace, we should say that \r\nreconciliation means restoring humanity’s lost unity — \r\nparticularly today, when human societies are fractured \r\nor deeply divided and afflicted by extreme poverty or \r\nconfronted by territorial or ethnic conflicts. \r\n We understand that, and we therefore propose \r\nreconciliation, in the sense of seeking and establishing \r\nnew paradigms for human coexistence and \r\nunderstanding. It is impossible to exist without others, \r\nand it is always possible to live in peace with others.  \r\n We see this proposal to proclaim 2009 the \r\nInternational Year of Reconciliation as an initiative that \r\nis appropriate for the sphere of international relations \r\nand relations between States, nations, peoples, cultures \r\nand individuals. Such an exercise requires that we \r\nconsider forgiveness, truth, justice and mercy, as \r\nmaintained by the most seasoned experts on peaceful \r\nconflict settlement. However, as long as we continue to \r\nbelieve that war is the means to achieve peace, \r\nhumanity — which is no longer an abstract entity — \r\nwill suffer its present ills and others that are even \r\nworse. Thus, we will be plunged into darkness and \r\nbarbarity. \r\n Reconciliation results from putting into practice \r\nethics and superior values as opposed to petty interests. \r\nIt involves making the common good and human \r\ndignity the cornerstone of development. Reconciliation \r\nmeans analysing and overcoming the causes of \r\nviolence and oppression and the origins of the \r\nproblems and threats facing humanity. It also results \r\nfrom criticizing our own culture and way of thinking, \r\nwhich are inclined to be bellicose or self-centred. Here, \r\nreconciliation poses a challenge. \r\n That is why we believe that the perspectives of \r\nall world views, world religions, political systems, \r\npeoples and individuals can contribute to world \r\nreconciliation through activities, plans and \r\nprogrammes that will ultimately create conditions for \r\nA/61/PV.56  \r\n \r\n06-62233 26 \r\n \r\ngreater unity among human beings. Only if we are \r\nunited can we confront the problems that are common \r\nto everyone, although not caused by everyone, such as \r\nthe grave ecological crisis already affecting millions of \r\nhuman beings.  \r\n Thus, through systematic and practical \r\nreconciliation, promoted by States and citizens, we can \r\ncarry out concrete actions needed in any society — in \r\nkeeping with their history and culture. Reconciliation \r\nbetween States in conflict, between Governments and \r\ncitizens, between genders, between generations, \r\nbetween men and women, between human beings and \r\nnature, between religions, ethnic groups and cultures, \r\nbetween the North and the South, between developed \r\ncountries and poor countries without access to \r\ntechnology — that is the essence of reconciliation in a \r\nworld where antagonisms, ruptures and discord could \r\nlead to our demise.  \r\n For the supreme value of peace — a gift that is \r\nobtained not through military victories but through a \r\nlife of brotherhood and justice — this initiative to \r\ndeclare 2009 the International Year of Reconciliation is \r\nvital. We propose that it be celebrated with energy and \r\nvitality by all nations of the world. It has been \r\nsupported by the High-level Group for the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations, established by the United Nations; the \r\nWorld Forum of Civil Society Networks; the World \r\nCouncil of Churches; the Polytechnic University of \r\nNicaragua’s Martin Luther King Institute for Social \r\nResearch and Action, which is a network of civil \r\nsociety organizations working for a culture of peace in \r\nthe world; and many other entities of world civil \r\nsociety. \r\n On behalf of the Governments of Argentina, \r\nBrazil, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, \r\nMauritius, Panama, the Philippines, Rwanda and my \r\nown country, Nicaragua, I ask that members support \r\nthis initiative, draft resolution A/61/L.22, entitled \r\n“International Year of Reconciliation, 2009”, which has \r\nseven preambular paragraphs and three operative \r\nparagraphs. \r\n The first preambular paragraph recalls the \r\npurposes and principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations, which we consider to be highly relevant to \r\nreconciliation processes, including bringing about by \r\npeaceful means, and in conformity with the principles \r\nof justice and international law, adjustment or \r\nsettlement of international disputes.  \r\n In the second preambular paragraph, it is \r\nrecognized that reconciliation processes are \r\nparticularly necessary and urgent in countries and \r\nregions of the world which have suffered or are \r\nsuffering situations of conflict that have affected and \r\ndivided societies in their various internal, national and \r\ninternational facets.  \r\n The third preambular paragraph recognizes the \r\nmany activities carried out by the United Nations \r\nsystem and the international community in diverse \r\nareas that lead to the initiation and development of \r\nreconciliation processes.  \r\n In the fourth preambular paragraph, the Assembly \r\nexpresses its awareness that dialogue among opponents \r\nfrom positions of respect and tolerance is an essential \r\nelement of peace and reconciliation. \r\n The fifth preambular paragraph states that the \r\nAssembly is also aware that truth and justice are \r\nindispensable elements for the attainment of \r\nreconciliation and lasting peace. \r\n The sixth preambular paragraph recalls the role of \r\nthe media in reporting on reconciliation processes. \r\n The seventh and last preambular paragraph \r\nexpresses the Assembly’s conviction that the \r\ndeclaration of an International Year of Reconciliation \r\nat the end of the first decade of the new Millennium \r\nwill provide the international community with the \r\nopportunity to pursue, with the active involvement of \r\nall stakeholders, efforts to develop reconciliation \r\nprocesses, which are necessary to and a condition for \r\nthe establishment of firm and lasting peace. \r\n In operative paragraph 1, the Assembly expresses \r\nits steadfast determination to pursue reconciliation \r\nprocesses in those societies that are affected and/or \r\ndivided by conflicts. \r\n In operative paragraph 2, the Assembly decides to \r\nproclaim 2009 the International Year of Reconciliation. \r\n Finally, in operative paragraph 3, the Assembly \r\ninvites concerned Governments and international and \r\nnon-governmental organizations to support \r\nreconciliation processes among affected and/or divided \r\nsocieties and to plan and implement adequate cultural, \r\neducational and social programmes to promote the \r\nconcept of reconciliation, including holding \r\nconferences and seminars and disseminating \r\ninformation about the issue. \r\n A/61/PV.56\r\n \r\n27 06-62233 \r\n \r\n We hope that this draft resolution will not have \r\nany financial implications for the United Nations and \r\nthat it will be adopted by consensus. Many \r\npersonalities, peace scholars, universities and national \r\ncivil societies have expressed to us their support, \r\nacceptance and approval regarding this proposal of \r\nreconciliation for the year 2009. \r\n The President: The Assembly will now take \r\naction on draft resolution A/61/L.22. I should like to \r\nannounce that, since the introduction of the draft \r\nresolution, Chile has joined the list of sponsors.  \r\n May I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt \r\ndraft resolution A/61/L.22? \r\n Draft resolution A/61/L.22 was adopted \r\n(resolution 61/17). \r\n The President: I should like to thank the \r\ninterpreters for their patience and cooperation. \r\n I shall now give the floor to the representative of \r\nthe Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, who wishes to \r\nmake a statement in explanation of position on the \r\nresolution just adopted. \r\n Ms. Escobar-Gómez (Venezuela) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): The delegation of Venezuela wishes to make \r\na statement of position following the adoption of the \r\ndraft resolution.  \r\n We welcome Nicaragua’s commendable initiative \r\nin submitting the draft resolution, whose goal is the \r\npromotion of peace through the proclamation of the \r\nyear 2009 as the International Year of Reconciliation.  \r\n We would like to make an interpretive statement \r\non the sixth preambular paragraph of the resolution \r\nrelating to the role of the media. \r\n In the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, certain \r\nmedia, abusing their total freedom of expression, have \r\nbeen manipulating public opinion and poisoning the \r\nminds of certain sectors of the Venezuelan \r\npopulation — all of this in conjunction with certain \r\nsectors of the United States of America, which have \r\ngone to the extreme of calling for the assassination of \r\nour President, Mr. Hugo Chávez Frías. \r\n The case of Venezuela is not unique. The \r\ninappropriate and anti-democratic use of means of \r\ncommunication represents the greatest threat to \r\nfreedom of expression and to reconciliation. \r\n The President: May I take it that it is the wish of \r\nthe Assembly to conclude its consideration of agenda \r\nitem 150? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n \r\nProgramme of work \r\n \r\n The President: I would like to inform members \r\nof some revisions to the programme of work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. At the request of the sponsors, \r\nconsideration of agenda item 15, “Zone of peace and \r\ncooperation of the South Atlantic”, has been postponed \r\nto a later date. Consideration of agenda item 27, \r\n“Protracted conflicts in the GUAM area and their \r\nimplications for international peace, security and \r\ndevelopment”, originally scheduled for Monday, \r\n4 December 2006, has been postponed to Thursday \r\nmorning, 7 December 2006, as the second item.  \r\n Consideration of agenda item 110, \r\n“Revitalization of the work of the General Assembly”, \r\nalso originally scheduled for Monday, 4 December, has \r\nbeen postponed until Tuesday morning, 12 December. \r\nOn Wednesday afternoon, 6 December, the General \r\nAssembly will take up the report of the First \r\nCommittee.  \r\n The meeting rose at 1.30 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
