May I take it that the General \r\nAssembly decides to consider this item directly in \r\nplenary meeting? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President: I should like to inform members \r\nthat the item entitled “Support by the United Nations \r\nsystem of the efforts of Governments to promote and \r\nA/61/PV.57  \r\n \r\n06-62681 2 \r\n \r\nconsolidate new or restored democracies” becomes \r\nitem 157 on the agenda of the current session. \r\n The General Assembly has thus concluded its \r\nconsideration of the fourth report of the General \r\nCommittee. \r\n \r\nProgramme of work \r\n \r\n The President: I should like to inform members \r\nthat document A/INF/61/4/Rev.2, containing a revised \r\nprogramme of work and schedule of plenary meetings \r\nfor the remainder of the main part of the sixty-first \r\n \r\n session, was issued this morning and has been \r\ndistributed in the Conference Room.
