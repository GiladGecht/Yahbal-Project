Migrant men and women bring much-\r\nneeded skills and labour to sending and receiving \r\ncountries. Remittances can give poor families a stable \r\nincome, and the migration experience can change \r\nattitudes and empower people, particularly women. \r\n The United Kingdom is committed to supporting \r\ndeveloping countries’ efforts to help poor people \r\nbenefit from migration. We are doing that in a number \r\nof countries already. For example, we work with \r\ncountries to make remittances cheaper and easier to \r\ntransfer, and we finance programmes that provide poor \r\nmigrants in developing countries with services. We are \r\nready to do more. \r\n We believe that the key to success is strong \r\npartnerships in development and in migration. The \r\nUnited Kingdom is committed to the country-led \r\napproach to development. We believe that developing \r\ncountries should drive their own development. That is \r\nwhy we would like to see migration policies and \r\nactions better integrated into national poverty-\r\nreduction strategies. The African Union common \r\nposition on migration and development urged member \r\nStates to mainstream migration in that way. We \r\nwelcome and support that initiative because donors are \r\nmore likely to get behind countries’ efforts to manage \r\nmigration effectively if it appears in national strategies. \r\nA/61/PV.5  \r\n \r\n06-52450 2 \r\n \r\n But, sadly, the migration and development story \r\nis not always a positive one. Migrants can be poorly \r\ntreated. Developing countries lose skilled people, such \r\nas doctors, nurses and teachers, and that puts a strain \r\non services. People are also trafficked and smuggled, \r\nwhich puts them at risk of exploitation when they \r\narrive, underlining why irregular migration, without \r\nthe prospect of a legitimate job at the end of it, does \r\nnot help migrants or the countries they leave. \r\n We take the risks of migration seriously. \r\nInternational cooperation to reduce those risks is \r\nabsolutely vital. It requires us to cooperate to \r\nencourage the use of legal migration opportunities and \r\nto prevent and deal sensibly with irregular and illegal \r\nmigration and the issue of returns. \r\n One of the most effective ways that we can help \r\nto reduce the risks of migration is through the United \r\nKingdom’s development programme. Being focused on \r\npoverty reduction, our development assistance will be \r\nhelping to reduce the circumstances that make people \r\nfeel they have no alternative other than to migrate. But \r\nmore specifically, we are helping to mitigate the risks \r\nin a number of ways, including through programmes \r\nthat aim to counter the brain drain and programmes \r\nthat improve the ability of women migrants to access \r\ntheir rights. The United Kingdom also does not \r\nactively recruit health professionals from developing \r\ncountries that do not want to lose their staff. \r\n We see the value of this Dialogue as an \r\nopportunity to come together, as States affected in \r\ndifferent ways by international migration, to increase \r\nour mutual understanding and analysis of the issues in \r\na discussion that is both constructive and positive. We \r\nalso want to find practical ways and means to \r\nimplement what we have said and to learn from others’ \r\nexperience. \r\n That is why the United Kingdom supports the \r\nproposal that the Dialogue should continue beyond this \r\nmeeting. There is, in our view, a space for a global \r\nforum or group that meets on a regular, voluntary, non-\r\nbinding and informal basis to build a consensus on the \r\nopportunities and challenges that migration presents \r\nfor development and to share best practice. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Paolo Ferrero, Minister of Social \r\nSolidarity of Italy. \r\n Mr. Ferrero (Italy) (spoke in Italian; English text \r\nfurnished by the delegation): I wish to thank the \r\nGeneral Assembly for having organized this historic \r\ninternational meeting. I hope that it can be a tool for a \r\nbetter understanding of the migration phenomenon, \r\nwhich is a great problem of our times, and for trying to \r\nimprove coexistence among different cultures, which is \r\na promise for collective security and the safeguarding \r\nof peace. \r\n I also wish to confirm that Italy’s views are \r\nreflected in the concepts expressed earlier in this Hall \r\nby the European Union. \r\n Italy, as members know, was for many years a \r\ncountry of emigration. Our emigrants experienced \r\nracism. As a Government, we are committed to \r\nmodifying our national legislation to place at its centre \r\nthe rights of people and human and social rights, and in \r\nparticular to end the drama of illegality that many \r\nimmigrants in our country are experiencing today. \r\n We understand quite clearly that the phenomenon \r\nof migration is rooted in the social and economic \r\nimbalances of our world, between wealthy and poor \r\nnations. At its heart, we find a spark of hope among \r\nthose who leave their homes to build themselves a \r\nbetter future. In that framework, we wish to strive to \r\nstrengthen development cooperation in all its aspects \r\nby reactivating bilateral, European and Mediterranean \r\ncooperation to address the issue.  \r\n We are therefore developing training programmes \r\nin the countries of origin to confront the criminal \r\norganizations that engage in human trafficking. To that \r\nend, we are updating our migration legislation in order \r\nto promote legal entry into our country and thereby \r\nundermine illegal immigration. \r\n Women and children are often the main victims \r\nof trafficking in human beings. It is critical to \r\nguarantee minors full access to the rights and \r\nprotections established by the Convention on the \r\nRights of the Child. We wish to stress that point \r\nbecause we note that it does not yet enjoy the central \r\nplace in our debate that it deserves.  \r\n As to our countries’ other policies, the \r\nGovernment has presented two bills to Parliament to \r\nmake family reunification easier and to reduce to five \r\nyears the time needed for an immigrant to acquire \r\nItalian citizenship. The right to citizenship is \r\nfundamental. Another focus is social rights. In Italy all \r\n A/61/PV.5\r\n \r\n3 06-52450 \r\n \r\nimmigrants, legal and illegal alike, are guaranteed full \r\naccess to national health care, and all children enjoy \r\nthe right to go school, thus reducing the dropout rate, \r\none of the most negative phenomena we are currently \r\nexperiencing.  Moreover, we are drafting legislation \r\non immigrants’ right to vote in local elections and \r\nsafeguarding freedom of religion and creed in order to \r\nintegrate all the various cultural and religious \r\nexperiences into the social fabric of our country.  \r\n In conclusion, migrants are not guests on \r\nperpetual probation, but rather new citizens, able to \r\nenrich our cultural heritage with elements of their own \r\ncultures. First and foremost, they are people seeking to \r\nbuild their own life project. We must therefore work to \r\nraise migration out of the realm of illegality and to \r\nfoster the integration of foreign citizens into our \r\ncommunities. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to Her \r\nExcellency Ms. Mary Wallace, Minister of State at the \r\nDepartment of Agriculture of Ireland. \r\n Ms. Wallace (Ireland): I am pleased to represent \r\nIreland today at a United Nations forum which \r\nspecifically links international migration to the concept \r\nof development. I can say from Ireland’s perspective \r\nthat our preparation for this Dialogue has developed \r\nand improved our understanding of the synergies \r\nbetween those two areas and provided the impetus for \r\nincreased contacts and action. \r\n I want at the outset of my remarks to express my \r\nappreciation to my fellow countryman, Peter \r\nSutherland, for the work undertaken by him as the \r\nSecretary-General’s Special Representative for this \r\nDialogue. \r\n I would like to associate myself with the \r\nstatement made by Ms. Tarja Filatov, Minister of \r\nLabour of Finland, on behalf of the European Union. \r\n For Ireland, this theme naturally has a particular \r\nresonance. It is no exaggeration to say that migration, \r\nand in particular emigration, has been a defining \r\nelement of Ireland’s history and experience in the last \r\n200 years. Perhaps the greatest achievement of our \r\neconomic policies of recent years is that, for our young \r\npeople, migration is now a matter of choice rather than \r\nthe necessity that it once was. \r\n The dramatic growth of our economy in the last \r\ndecade has resulted in Ireland’s experiencing the forces \r\nof migration in a completely new way. My country has \r\nbecome a major destination for migrant workers, with \r\nan estimated 9 per cent of our working population \r\nbeing non-Irish. Recent preliminary 2006 census \r\nresults indicated that, in a population of 4.2 million, \r\nthe number of non-Irish nationals in the State is likely \r\nto be roughly 400,000, as compared to 222,000 in \r\n2002. \r\n We greatly value their contribution to Ireland’s \r\nsocial and economic development, as well as to our \r\ncountry’s cultural diversity. We believe that this \r\nmigration has benefited migrants themselves and their \r\ncountries of origin. The substantial increase in \r\nmigration over a short period of time has posed \r\nchallenges to the State and necessitated putting in place \r\nstructures, legislation and systems to manage it. \r\n A sound and transparent legislative framework to \r\nmanage migration effectively is essential in any \r\ndeveloped economy. Recently, the Government of \r\nIreland announced its proposals for new immigration, \r\nresidence and protection legislation, which represents a \r\nradical overhaul of our immigration laws dating back \r\nto 1935. That legislation will provide the framework \r\nfor orderly and managed legal migration into the State. \r\nIt will set out, in a single code, comprehensive \r\nstatutory procedures for the application of stated \r\npolicies in the various stages of the immigration \r\nprocess. We are also developing policies aimed at \r\nencouraging people with special qualifications, skills \r\nand entrepreneurial abilities to consider Ireland as a \r\npermanent destination.  \r\n Integration strategies for legal migrants are \r\nanother vital element in the whole area of people \r\nmovement. Ireland is committed to enhancing the \r\nframework already in place for integration, as well as \r\nto ensuring that our migrant population is provided \r\nwith full legal protection against exploitation, whether \r\nin the workplace or elsewhere in society. \r\n We are, however, coming to terms with the reality \r\nthat Ireland is irrevocably a major multicultural society \r\nwith over 160 nationalities living and working in the \r\ncountry. The integration of newcomers into that new \r\nmulticultural society is one of the most important \r\nsocial issues we will face over the next few decades.  \r\n A key challenge for this High-level Dialogue is to \r\nidentify appropriate ways and means to maximize the \r\ndevelopment benefits of international migration and to \r\nminimize its negative impacts. Ireland recognizes that \r\neach country is primarily responsible for its own \r\nA/61/PV.5  \r\n \r\n06-52450 4 \r\n \r\ndevelopment, but seeks to support its partner \r\nGovernments in the developing world in working to \r\nreduce poverty and to enable their people to meet their \r\nbasic needs in health, education and sustainable \r\nlivelihoods. Ireland is committed to reaching the \r\nUnited Nations official development assistance target \r\nof 0.7 per cent of gross national income by 2012. This \r\nyear, our aid spending is at its highest level ever not \r\nonly in terms of volume but also as a percentage of our \r\ngross national product (GNP). \r\n This High-level Dialogue cannot ignore the \r\nnegative impact of migration on development. We \r\nrecognize the problems encountered when qualified \r\nprofessionals migrate to better-paid jobs in richer \r\ncountries. The situation has become critical in sub-\r\nSaharan Africa, where the health workforce has \r\nbecome seriously depleted. There is clearly a need to \r\ntake concerted action to address the push-and-pull \r\nfactors of health worker migration. \r\n A priority of the aid programme of the \r\nGovernment of Ireland is to support partner countries \r\nto improve the management and working conditions for \r\nhealth workers in order to encourage them to continue \r\nworking in their own countries. We also recognize the \r\nresponsibility of richer countries to manage \r\ninternational recruitment so that skilled health workers \r\nare not encouraged to migrate from severely \r\nunderstaffed countries. The Government of Ireland is \r\ncommitted to best practices in recruitment, and we \r\nwelcome the European Union initiative to develop a \r\ncode of conduct for ethical recruitment of health \r\nworkers. \r\n There is increasing recognition of the potential of \r\nmigrants’ remittances to contribute to economic \r\ndevelopment at the household, local, national and \r\nregional levels. Ireland takes the view that work on the \r\ndevelopment potential of remittances must take place \r\nin a context where it is recognized that those \r\nremittances are private funds and are not a substitute \r\nfor national development efforts, comprehensive \r\ndevelopment strategies or official development aid. \r\n The Secretary-General’s report suggests the \r\nestablishment of a consultative forum that would offer \r\nGovernments a venue for discussing issues related to \r\ninternational migration and development systematically \r\nand comprehensively. Ireland supports the \r\nestablishment of such a forum, which would be non-\r\nbureaucratic, open ended, State owned, consultative \r\nand non-decision-making and would provide a \r\nframework for continued dialogue on challenges that \r\nface all our societies in the areas of migration and \r\ndevelopment. \r\n The President: I now call on Her Excellency \r\nMs. Consuelo Rumí, Secretary of State for Immigration \r\nand Emigration of Spain. \r\n Ms. Rumí (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): My \r\ndelegation endorses Finland’s remarks on behalf of the \r\nEuropean Union delivered at the start of this High-\r\nlevel Dialogue, in which one of the most important \r\nphenomena of our time is being discussed. The \r\nphenomenon of immigration and its link with \r\ndevelopment in this interdependent world has a \r\ngrowing impact in the countries of origin and in those \r\nof transit and destination. For that reason, the United \r\nNations, where we are all represented, is an especially \r\nappropriate and necessary framework for discussion of \r\nthis matter. \r\n Spain does not forget that for centuries and until \r\nvery recently it was a country of emigration and that in \r\nthe past few years it has become one of the main \r\nimmigrant-receiving countries. The Government of \r\nSpain deals with the issue of migration from an open \r\nand integral perspective and promotes the planning and \r\nimplementation of development strategies that deal \r\nwith the root causes of migratory flows and create \r\nopportunities and expectations of a dignified life in the \r\ncountries of origin. As a result, we consider that \r\nmigratory policies should serve to maximize the \r\nbenefits of a legal and organized migration and reduce \r\nthe inevitable negative consequences for the countries \r\ninvolved, as well as for the migrants and their families. \r\nHowever, that will be possible only through dialogue \r\nand cooperation among the countries involved. It will \r\nbe possibly through shared responsibility in \r\nappropriate management of migration flows.  \r\n On the other hand, the appropriate integration of \r\nimmigrants in the country of destination will increase \r\nimmigrants’ capacity to contribute to the development \r\nof their country of origin. It must be recalled that better \r\nintegration requires a clear effort by the countries of \r\ndestination. They have the responsibility to design \r\nprogrammes for receiving immigrants, providing \r\nemployment and integrating immigrants into the \r\neducation system and social life on the basis of \r\npromoting equal treatment and non-discrimination. \r\n A/61/PV.5\r\n \r\n5 06-52450 \r\n \r\n We must also take into account the benefits of \r\nvoluntary return programmes. The establishment of \r\nmechanisms that make available information about \r\nthese programmes and their financing could be an \r\nincentive for immigrants to return to their country of \r\norigin and to contribute towards that country’s \r\ndevelopment. \r\n The Government of Spain will soon approve the \r\nfirst Strategic Plan for Citizenship and Integration, for \r\n2006-2009, endowed with 2 million euros, and with \r\nnumerous measures in favour of integration, structured \r\naround 12 areas of action: welcoming, education, \r\nemployment, housing, social services, health, equal \r\ntreatment, women, youth, participation, public \r\nawareness and development. \r\n Spain is also aware that the deep causes of \r\nmigration are linked to the lack of opportunities in the \r\ncountries of origin. That is the source of our current \r\nefforts in development cooperation, which we know all \r\ntoo well will bear fruit only in the medium term. That \r\neffort will enable us to reach the target of 0.5 per cent \r\nof our gross domestic product in 2008, thus doubling in \r\nfour years the Spanish contribution in this field. \r\n The Government of Spain is determined to \r\nintensify international cooperation, promoting specific \r\nmeasures for action within the European Union. It is \r\nimportant that all countries involved, both countries of \r\norigin and countries of destination, prepare, on the \r\nbasis of the principle of joint responsibility and \r\nmanagement, appropriate measures and programmes of \r\naction. This is the path that was undertaken at the \r\nEuro-African Conference on Migration and \r\nDevelopment held in Rabat in July and that we \r\nunderstand marks the path to follow in the future. The \r\nIbero-American Meeting on Migration and \r\nDevelopment held in Madrid, also in July, had a similar \r\noutcome and highlighted the need to advance towards \r\nan Ibero-American coordination mechanism within the \r\nframework of the Ibero-American Conference. \r\n We are convinced that international migration \r\ncannot be handled unilaterally. The interests of \r\nmigrants and their families, and their security and \r\nwelfare, are at stake. Many human lives are lost \r\ntragically in the course of irregular emigration \r\nprocesses, and many human beings suffer as a result of \r\nillegal trafficking. There are no immigration policies \r\nthat can be credible without a major, decisive struggle \r\nagainst clandestine immigration, which is a blight on \r\nour time and whose victims are the immigrants \r\nthemselves, as well as the society that receives them.  \r\n The position of the Government of Spain is \r\nabsolutely firm. During the past few years, it has been \r\nreinforcing control measures and developing an \r\neffective strategy against clandestine trafficking, \r\nincluding a proposal to provide bilateral and \r\nmultilateral cooperation, which are truly indispensable \r\nin this area. International migration must be addressed \r\nin an orderly manner as an extraordinary opportunity \r\nfor all, with responsibilities that ought to be shared. \r\n To that end, and with the aim of promoting \r\nreflection and concerted action on the phenomenon of \r\nmigration at the global level, Spain has been \r\nsupporting the dialogue leading to the establishment of \r\nthe global forum on migration and development \r\nproposed by the Secretary-General. Here, I wish to \r\nexpress my Government’s appreciation and support for \r\nthe efforts of Mr. Peter Sutherland, Special \r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General. In the context \r\nof the global forum, a follow-up mechanism could be \r\nestablished in the areas charted by this High-level \r\nDialogue.  \r\n Therefore, we hope that this Dialogue will be \r\nfruitful and reach significant conclusions that will be \r\nbeneficial for the international community regarding \r\nthe actions to be taken in the area of international \r\nmigration and development. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Luis Paolo Barreto, Deputy Minister of \r\nJustice of Brazil. \r\n Mr. Barreto (Brazil) (spoke in Spanish): Around \r\nthe world, there is practically universal \r\nacknowledgement of the importance of migration and \r\nof the contributions of migrants to countries of \r\ndestination. In many nations, immigrants have been \r\nessential for economic, social and cultural \r\ndevelopment. What we now see is a pronounced lack of \r\npreparation on the part of Governments, the media and \r\nsociety in addressing this issue. Laws, policies and \r\ncontrol strategies are adopted one after another in an \r\nattempt to achieve what is now called the governance \r\nof migration. Restrictive migration laws have not been \r\neffective in containing migratory flows; often indeed \r\nthey serve as an incentive for the activities of \r\ninternational syndicates specializing in the smuggling \r\nof migrants and human trafficking.  \r\nA/61/PV.5  \r\n \r\n06-52450 6 \r\n \r\n The issue of migration governance is generally \r\naddressed by way of agreements to fight such \r\nsyndicates and to tighten visa restrictions, passport \r\ncontrols and airport, maritime and ground security \r\nmeasures. There are discussions about criminalizing \r\nirregular immigration and about electronic and \r\nbiometric identification systems, rigorous visa \r\nprocedures, data checks and shared mechanisms for \r\nrejecting immigrants. Several such measures have been \r\ndebated and adopted in many countries, with \r\nunsatisfactory results. While the number of violations \r\nof immigrants’ human rights and cases of \r\ndiscrimination, incarceration and punishment increases \r\nby the day, the pace of migration continues to \r\naccelerate.  \r\n There is now talk of strategies to invest in \r\ncountries of origin, supposedly to help promote \r\ndevelopment, but actually to help contain migratory \r\nflows. By themselves, such strategies will not be \r\neffective.  \r\n We urge that the issue of migration be addressed \r\nin terms of human rights. Our objective is to guarantee \r\nfor migrants the full exercise of their civil rights. We \r\nsupport globalization and migration policies, dignified \r\ntreatment of migrants and the fight against all forms of \r\nxenophobia. We favour broader international protection \r\nfor refugees. We believe that the integration of human \r\nbeings should be the main objective of foreign policies. \r\n Countries have the sovereign right to establish \r\nrules governing the entry, stay and exit of foreigners in \r\nand from their territory. However, no country is \r\nunanswerable to the international community for \r\nviolating the rights of immigrants. The transnational \r\nnature of human rights is firmly established. The \r\ncriminalization of migrants, mass deportations, \r\ndiscriminatory treatment, denying international \r\nprotection to refugees and treating migrants as if they \r\nhad no rights cannot be accepted, even under the \r\npretext of national sovereignty. \r\n Brazil, as current President of the Common \r\nMarket of the South, is making available to interested \r\ndelegations a document detailing the significant \r\nprogress made by our regional bloc in simplifying the \r\nmovement and regularization of persons while \r\npromoting joint action to prevent and combat the \r\nsmuggling of migrants and human trafficking.  \r\n Brazil fully supports the proposal of the \r\nSecretary-General, Kofi Annan, to establish a global \r\nforum on migration and development. We believe that \r\nsuch a forum will be an important way — perhaps the \r\nonly way — to address the issue of migration in a \r\nmanner appropriate to today’s world.  \r\n We also regard as constructive Peter Sutherland’s \r\nproposal of an informal and inclusive global forum that \r\nwould examine the links between migration and \r\ndevelopment from a comprehensive and holistic \r\nperspective with a major focus on human rights. We \r\nbelieve that the Global Migration Group should \r\nsupport the operations of such a forum. I also believe \r\nthat it is essential to strengthen the Office of the United \r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees so that it can \r\ntackle the grave problem of persecution in the world in \r\nrelation to race, nationality, social group, political \r\nopinion, conflict and serious human rights violations.  \r\n Calm discussion on this issue could open the door \r\nto joint, creative, human and just solutions with regard \r\nto the phenomenon of migration, which linked our own \r\nancestors together. It is a right that must also be \r\nensured for our descendants.  \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Wieslaw Tarka, Deputy Minister of the \r\nInterior and Administration of Poland. \r\n Mr. Tarka (Poland): Poland fully supports the \r\nstatement delivered by the representative of Finland on \r\nbehalf of the European Union. I should like to make a \r\nfew additional comments on the issues under \r\ndiscussion as viewed from our perspective. \r\n The recognition of migration policy as a constant \r\ncomponent of a country’s development and \r\nmodernization strategy requires that it be based on \r\nreliable knowledge of the nature and consequences of \r\nmigration-related phenomena at both the national and \r\nglobal levels. Therefore, we highly appreciate the \r\ninitiative of organizing the High-level Dialogue on \r\nInternational Migration and Development. We also \r\nagree that today’s debate should mark the beginning of \r\nan international sharing of experience gained in this \r\nfield. We expect that it will be a multithematic \r\ndiscussion on the complex issues involved. \r\n I wish to express our appreciation to the \r\nSecretary-General, Kofi Annan, to his team and to the \r\nSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General, Peter \r\nSutherland, for their excellent and comprehensive \r\npreparation of this meeting. \r\n A/61/PV.5\r\n \r\n7 06-52450 \r\n \r\n Although the international aspects of migration-\r\nrelated cooperation are highly significant, its regional \r\ndimension is of key importance. Therefore, we express \r\nour support for an increase in the activities and the \r\nparticipation of all the regional commissions of the \r\nUnited Nations system with regard to migration and \r\ndevelopment issues. \r\n It was not long ago that we met at the Euro-\r\nAfrican Conference held in Rabat. Its outcome proved \r\nthat such meetings should also be conducted in other \r\nregions, including Eastern Europe, where migration-\r\nrelated issues will, to an ever greater extent, influence \r\nthe economic and social situation. \r\n Poland is currently formulating the specific \r\ncomponents of its migration policy. Historical events \r\nclearly show that Poles have been active participants in \r\nthe migration processes. Our accession into the \r\nEuropean Union integrated our country into the global, \r\nand primarily European, migration system at a higher \r\nlevel. Globalization processes influencing the \r\nmigration phenomenon will also have an impact on \r\nmigration in Poland. \r\n We are not only a country of emigration but have \r\nalso become a country of immigration. During the last \r\ndecade, Poland has become a transit and destination \r\ncountry. To an ever greater extent, we have been \r\nexperiencing the phenomenon of temporary migration. \r\nTherefore, we believe that special attention should be \r\ngiven to this particular issue and its challenges. \r\n Owing to our geographical location, Poland is a \r\nplace of migration mostly for the people from the \r\nEast — from neighbouring European countries as well \r\nas Asian States. \r\n As a result of political changes in the last 15 \r\nyears, our country has established a legal and \r\ninstitutional system for migration-related issues that is \r\nin compliance with European standards. This process is \r\nstill in progress pursuant to the evolving changes in \r\nEuropean Union migration and asylum policy. \r\n Poland has not experienced a mass population \r\ninflux. However, recognizing the importance of \r\nmigration at the global level, we actively participate in \r\nthe international discussion on the development \r\nbenefits resulting from the phenomenon for receiving \r\ncountries, countries of origin and migrants themselves. \r\n Both our experience and our analysis of our \r\nEuropean partners’ migration policies support our view \r\nthat effective migration management is possible and \r\nthat it should be based on intensive cooperation and \r\npartnership among countries of origin, transit and \r\ndestination. Such cooperation should be led on \r\nbilateral, regional, multilateral and global levels. The \r\nconstructive role of non-governmental organizations \r\nand local communities is also to be emphasized. \r\n We are convinced that the most efficient use of \r\nthe organizational and financial potential of countries, \r\nregions, institutions and other partners, will be best \r\nachieved by ensuring coherence and avoiding \r\nduplication. \r\n It is indispensable to maintain the mechanism of \r\nfurther cooperation among States in the area of \r\nmigration within the United Nations. Therefore, we \r\nappreciate the Secretary-General’s initiative aimed at \r\nestablishing a consultation forum for United Nations \r\nMember States which will provide a comprehensive \r\napproach to migration- and development-related issues. \r\nIn our opinion, such a forum is needed. However, it \r\nshould be established within the framework of existing \r\nUnited Nations structures and in cooperation with the \r\nInternational Organization for Migration (IOM). \r\n This High-level meeting is the first time that the \r\nissues of migration and development have been raised \r\nat such a high level. I am deeply convinced that we all \r\nperceive these questions to be of great importance and \r\nworthy of further development, with a view to \r\nimproving the quality of the global debate on this \r\ntopic. We are all aware that migration is an always-\r\npresent phenomenon, and therefore our main task is to \r\nfind the best way to maximize its benefits and \r\nefficiently tackle the challenges it poses. Poland is \r\nready to take an active part and contribute to our \r\ncommon efforts in this domain. \r\n The President: I give the floor to His Excellency \r\nMr. Alejandro Borda, Vice-Minister of Multilateral \r\nPolitical Affairs of Colombia. \r\n Mr. Borda (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): My \r\ndelegation is delighted to see you, Madam President, \r\npresiding over our debates and is convinced that, under \r\nyour leadership, we shall achieve the targets that we \r\nhave proposed. \r\n Owing to its complexity, international migration \r\nis charged by tensions between globalization and \r\nnational sovereignty, between best practices and worst \r\nrealities, between unilateral and multilateral positions. \r\nA/61/PV.5  \r\n \r\n06-52450 8 \r\n \r\n Globalization has turned migration into a cross-\r\ncutting matter which is closely related to development, \r\nhuman rights, the struggle against poverty, and the \r\nquest for opportunities in an inequitable world, which \r\nis why this phenomenon should be addressed at the \r\nglobal and intergovernmental levels. \r\n The global approach fully justifies its treatment \r\nin a context as inclusive as the United Nations, as the \r\nsole intergovernmental forum of a global nature. \r\nTherefore, the convening of this High-level Dialogue is \r\nwelcome, and we should follow it up with all due \r\nconsideration. \r\n Colombia considers it advisable to establish \r\nregular and ongoing dialogue, which would make it \r\npossible achieve a general and comprehensive \r\nmigration policy, and should lead to specific mandates \r\nfor the agencies concerned. \r\n There are other intergovernmental institutions \r\nwhose composition is not universal, and which \r\napproach the issue of migration from specific points of \r\nview. But, given their characteristics and limitations, \r\nthese bodies do not approach the migration issue from \r\na comprehensive perspective. For that reason, our \r\ndialogue should be broad and inclusive of all migration \r\nelements and should at all costs avoid considering a \r\nmigrant as “unskilled labour on the move”, that is, \r\nmerely as some merchandise required to develop the \r\neconomy. On the contrary, we should start by thinking \r\nabout the human dimension of the migrant and respect \r\nfor his or her fundamental rights. \r\n Regional dialogue on migration matters is useful. \r\nWe believe that many specific issues could be \r\napproached in greater depth in the framework of \r\nregional encounters, in order to seek cooperation \r\nstrategies. Nonetheless, migration is a phenomenon \r\nthat is not limited to regional dynamics. Therefore, we \r\nneed to preserve the broad and inclusive framework of \r\nthe United Nations to assure that its analysis will take \r\naccount of all aspects of its complex reality as a global \r\nphenomenon linked to development. \r\n The High-level Dialogue should be a constructive \r\nforum, with flexible mechanisms for fostering \r\nunderstanding, policy agreement and cooperative \r\nsolidarity, and which encourage thought at the \r\ndomestic and global levels on the structural causes of \r\nmigration and the possibilities of development. \r\n My delegation thanks the Secretary-General for \r\nhis report on international migration and development \r\n(A/60/871). In general terms, we share the approach of \r\nthe document, which has visualized migration as a \r\nmultidimensional phenomenon, presenting challenges \r\nand opportunities for countries of origin and \r\ndestination alike, by linking migration to development. \r\n When considering the agendas for migration and \r\ndevelopment together, we should take into account the \r\nprevailing global economic model, which undermines \r\nlocal forms of production and encourages migrant \r\nflows to developed countries when the local population \r\nhas no viable possibility of overcoming poverty or \r\ngenerating wealth, investing or saving. \r\n With the results of the economic model \r\nimplemented in Latin America to improve living \r\nstandards, proposals have been made based on a new \r\nparadigm of sustained development through the \r\nproductive use of remittances. It should be noted that \r\nremittances are private resources, and therefore they \r\ncannot be the subject of government intervention. Their \r\nuse is determined by the migrant and his immediate \r\nfamily, and the medium- and long-term effects of this \r\nmechanism have not been sufficiently evaluated in \r\nmacroeconomic terms. \r\n In a multilateral context, the concept of “best \r\npractices” has been imposed as the model from which \r\ninternational public policy has been slowly built up. \r\nNonetheless, in the field of migration, this model \r\ncannot be an excuse for sidestepping the “worst \r\nrealities” to which migrants are exposed in societies \r\nthat exploit them or turn their backs on them: \r\nxenophobia, discrimination, racism, and the dismissal \r\nof the economic and cultural contributions made by \r\nmigrants to their communities of origin and their \r\ndestination societies. We should look at the everyday \r\nrealities of migrants and their problems in order to start \r\nthe participatory quest for solutions and innovative \r\npolicies.  \r\n A clear understanding of the positive aspects of \r\nmigration — tolerance, acceptance of the cultural \r\ndiversity of migrants and their harmonious integration \r\ninto receiving societies — should form the basis of the \r\nfirst and most important of the so-called best practices. \r\n Finally, my delegation would like to share some \r\nthoughts on the phenomenon of migration in general \r\nthat cause us some concern. I wish to refer here to the \r\n A/61/PV.5\r\n \r\n9 06-52450 \r\n \r\nprinciple of shared responsibility with respect to \r\nmigration in general. \r\n The principle of shared responsibility was \r\nadopted by the international community to address a \r\ncriminal phenomenon — illicit drugs and their \r\ntrafficking, as well as related crimes. To apply that \r\nprinciple to migration in general on that same basis \r\nwould be tantamount to equating migrants with a \r\nconsignment of illegal drugs such as cocaine. That \r\nwould contravene fundamental principles in that respect. \r\nMigration per se is not a criminal phenomenon. \r\nTrafficking in individuals or in drugs is criminal. \r\nTherefore shared responsibility in this respect must \r\ninvolve international solidarity vis-à-vis the criminal \r\nphenomenon of the illicit trafficking in human beings \r\nand related criminal activities. \r\n The President: I give the floor to Mr. Leonardo \r\nFranco, Vice-Minister for Latin American Affairs of \r\nArgentina. \r\n Mr. Franco (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nMadam President, let me begin by thanking the \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for having \r\norganized this High-level Dialogue on International \r\nMigration and Development. \r\n Migrations are an essential part of Argentine \r\nhistory. In the past my country received great numbers \r\nof immigrants, mainly from Europe; in recent decades, \r\nthey have been coming from brotherly South American \r\ncountries. Argentines, too, have had to leave, as they \r\ndid for political reasons in the 1970s. We wish publicly \r\nto thank other countries for having welcomed our \r\nrefugees. More recently, for economic reasons, \r\nArgentines have also sought better opportunities abroad. \r\n For all those reasons, my country is participating \r\nin this High-level Dialogue with great interest, given \r\nthe very high priority that the Argentine Government \r\nattaches to the subject of migration. My country’s \r\nparticipation is taking place in a context of regional \r\nintegration that addresses the subject of migration \r\nmultilaterally, from a human rights perspective, thus \r\ngoing beyond the traditional view of the issue, which is \r\nbased exclusively on the interests of the State and its \r\nsovereignty. \r\n We have as evidence of this the significant \r\nadvances achieved through binding agreements within \r\nMercosur and associated countries, which make this \r\nnew vision a reality for migrants in our region. I should \r\nlike in particular to draw attention to the consensus \r\nagreements reached at the South American Conference \r\non Migration, contained in the 2006 Asunción \r\nDeclaration. \r\n Argentina, in keeping with its historical tradition \r\nin that respect, would like to affirm that the quest for \r\nbetter living conditions elsewhere should not be \r\nviewed as blameworthy, much less criminalized. \r\nCountries should therefore address the issue by seeking \r\nto establish mechanisms for cooperation and \r\nintegration, assuming a common responsibility in this \r\nrespect. Such undertakings should be given concrete \r\nexpression, not just lip service. \r\n Argentina enshrined this new spirit in its \r\nmigration policy through the 2004 National Law on \r\nMigration. That new law reflects the commitment of \r\nour country to guaranteeing full respect for the human \r\nrights of migrants and their families. It also establishes \r\nmechanisms that can facilitate the regularization of \r\nmigration, thus contributing to the elimination of all \r\nforms of discrimination, xenophobia or racism. \r\n In Argentina, under the new legislation, the right \r\nto health care, social assistance and education at all \r\nlevels is guaranteed, on an equal footing, to all \r\nforeigners, whatever their migration status. \r\n As a consequence of the establishment of the \r\nMercosur and Associated States Residence Agreement, \r\nsigned in San Salvador de Bahía, Brazil, in 2002, \r\nArgentina implemented the National Programme on the \r\nNormalization of Migratory Documents — known as \r\n“Patria Grande” — which reflects a human and social \r\nperspective on the subject, benefiting all foreigners \r\nborn in States members of that bloc. The only conditions \r\nfor migratory regularization relate to nationality and \r\none’s police record, which must be clean. \r\n That programme has made it possible, in the three \r\nmonths of its existence, to regularize more than \r\n250,000 immigrants from South American countries. It \r\nis important to note that this programme is not an \r\namnesty programme but a State policy that will apply, \r\nfrom now on, to all nationals of Mercosur and \r\nassociated States who are currently in Argentina or will \r\narrive at a later date. \r\n The Argentine Government is aware of the \r\nrelationship between the issue of migration and \r\ninternational security. That is why my country has \r\nstated in various forums that it is vital to address those \r\nA/61/PV.5  \r\n \r\n06-52450 10 \r\n \r\nissues from a rights-based perspective, to ensure that \r\nmeasures adopted to promote international security do \r\nnot negatively affect respect for fundamental human \r\nrights. \r\n Accordingly, the Argentine Republic, while \r\nrecognizing that the exercise of a State’s sovereignty \r\nincludes control over its borders and the right to decide \r\nwhom it will admit to its national territory, nonetheless \r\nbelieves that due process should apply in that regard. \r\n Likewise, we believe that internal security is \r\nbetter served by regularizing and providing documents \r\nto immigrants who arrive in our country than by \r\nmarginalizing them or relegating them to anonymity, \r\nthereby rendering them defenceless against unscrupulous \r\nemployers or traffickers and their despicable ways. \r\n Our migratory policy incorporates a gender \r\nperspective aimed at ensuring that migrant women can \r\nfulfil their important role as agents of development and \r\ntransmitters of values. \r\n The trafficking of persons is one of the most \r\nurgent and serious problems related to the movement \r\nof individuals. Reports indicate that the geographical \r\nscope of the problem has expanded and that the \r\nmajority of victims are women and children. \r\nInternational cooperation is indispensable in uncovering \r\nand combating the complex transnational networks \r\ninvolved in the trafficking of human beings.  \r\n Before concluding, I would like to draw attention \r\nto the fact that Argentina has circulated a paper entitled \r\n“A paradigm shift: addressing international migration \r\nfrom a human rights perspective” (A/61/315, annex). \r\n In conclusion, we believe that, if they are to \r\nsucceed, the actions of the international community in \r\nthe area of migration must me addressed in a \r\ncomprehensive manner and on a multilateral basis. \r\nArgentina reaffirms its determination to participate \r\nactively in forums and mechanisms for international \r\ncooperation, with a view to promoting new principles \r\nfor migration based on the ethical consideration of \r\nrespect for the human rights of migrants. Accordingly, \r\nI would like to welcome, on behalf of my country, the \r\nGovernment of Belgium’s offer to host the first session \r\nof the consultative forum on migration. \r\n The President: I give the floor to His Excellency \r\nMr. Joris Demmink, Secretary-General of the Ministry \r\nof Justice of the Netherlands. \r\n Mr. Demmink (Netherlands): First of all, let me \r\nstress that this High-level Dialogue is a very timely \r\nevent. As the Secretary-General states in paragraph 7 \r\nof his report (A/60/871), “Each of us holds a piece of \r\nthe migration puzzle, but none has the whole picture. It \r\nis time to start putting it together”. \r\n The Netherlands attaches great importance to this \r\nglobal Dialogue and firmly believes that it should be \r\nthe beginning, not the end, of a global process of \r\ndiscussion and cooperation. It is only through open and \r\nconstructive dialogue about the positive and negative \r\naspects of migration and respect for each other’s views \r\nthat States can achieve mutually beneficial \r\ncooperation. This concerns both South-North and \r\nSouth-South cooperation, since the problems linked to \r\nSouth-South migration are as important as those linked \r\nto South-North migration. Migration should therefore \r\nbe addressed as a global phenomenon. \r\n We align ourselves with the statement made by \r\nthe representative of Finland on behalf of the European \r\nUnion (EU), especially as regards the relationship \r\nbetween migration and the Millennium Development \r\nGoals, the brain drain, circular migration, reducing \r\ntransfer costs for remittances, smuggling and \r\ntrafficking and the protection of refugees. \r\n There is a clear relationship between migration \r\nand development. Migration has both positive and \r\nnegative consequences for the economic and social \r\ndevelopment of the country of origin, as well as of the \r\ncountry of destination. Development can therefore \r\ninfluence the need to migrate. The Netherlands \r\nannually spends 0.8 per cent of its gross domestic \r\nproduct on the fight against poverty in the world, \r\nthereby contributing to the removal of root causes of \r\nmigration. \r\n Two years ago, the Dutch Minister for \r\nDevelopment Cooperation and her colleague \r\nresponsible for immigration and integration presented \r\nto parliament a joint paper on migration and \r\ndevelopment. An English version is available in this \r\nHall. In our view, it is a good example of policy \r\ncoherence. Coherence has to start at home if it is to be \r\neffective internationally. \r\n The Netherlands is also a strong advocate of \r\ncoherence, cooperation and policy coordination among \r\nStates and between States and international \r\norganizations — in our own region, among regions and \r\nglobally. At the same time, we organize regular \r\n A/61/PV.5\r\n \r\n11 06-52450 \r\n \r\nmeetings with representatives of migrants’ \r\norganizations to enable them to provide input for \r\npolicy formulation. \r\n Countries benefit from managing flows of \r\nmigrants. Creating migration management capacity can \r\ntherefore make a major contribution. The Netherlands \r\nactively supports projects, especially in Africa, helping \r\nimmigration agencies and other authorities to register \r\nand assist migrants and protect refugees. \r\n Temporary labour migration can have significant \r\nadvantages for migrants themselves, as well as for their \r\ncountries of origin and destination. The Netherlands is \r\nexamining how temporary labour migration from \r\ndeveloping countries can serve the interests not only of \r\nthe Netherlands and of migrants, but of countries of \r\norigin as well.  \r\n The Netherlands works to promote “brain gain” \r\nby encouraging migrants to temporarily return to their \r\ncountries of origin to contribute to development. \r\nMigrants can act as a bridge between countries of \r\norigin and destination. For instance, in Ghana we \r\ndeveloped a project for the temporary return of \r\nGhanaian doctors who qualified in the Netherlands. \r\nLast April, we started a new project for the temporary \r\nreturn of qualified migrants to Afghanistan, Sierra \r\nLeone, the Sudan, Serbia, Montenegro and Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina. \r\n Every country should protect the rights of \r\nmigrants, particularly women and children, and combat \r\nxenophobia and racism. The Special Rapporteur on the \r\nHuman Rights of Migrants, acting under the mandate \r\nof the new Human Rights Council, has a vital role \r\nhere. \r\n For many women and their families, migration is \r\nthe all-important step towards a better life — not only \r\nbecause it means more income, but because of the \r\npossibilities of empowerment that it offers. But \r\nmigration also poses risks for women. Migrant women \r\noften do work that is dirty, difficult, demeaning and \r\ndangerous. Trafficking in persons is the dark underside \r\nof globalization, and it must be exposed and rooted out. \r\n It is essential that this Dialogue continue. We call \r\nupon the General Assembly at this High-level Dialogue \r\nto support the Secretary-General’s proposal for a \r\nglobal, informal and voluntary forum in which States \r\ncan discuss common problems, exchange best practices \r\nand find common solutions; the establishment of such a \r\nforum is supported by the Global Migration Group and \r\nthe Special Representative of the Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Peter Sutherland. We warmly welcome Belgium’s \r\noffer to host the first meeting of the forum. In the \r\nmeantime, countries will have to continue working \r\ntogether in every conceivable way. This week we have \r\nmade a good start. \r\n The President: I give the floor to His Excellency \r\nMr. Victor Filistovich, Vice-Minister of Interior of \r\nBelarus. \r\n Mr. Filistovich (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): On \r\nbehalf of the delegation of the Republic of Belarus, I \r\nwould like to thank the Secretariat for its excellent \r\nwork in having organized this High-level Dialogue on \r\nInternational Migration and Development. \r\n The fact that Member States are participating at \r\nsuch a high level in this forum clearly shows their \r\nreadiness to cooperate in a productive manner in \r\nregulating migration and reducing its negative social \r\neffects. It also proves their commitment to protecting \r\nthe rights and freedoms of migrants and refugees, as \r\nwell as their willingness to discuss the major \r\nchallenges of migration and the impact that it has on \r\ndevelopment throughout the world. \r\n Belarus supports a constructive international \r\ndialogue on migration and the need for effective \r\nmeasures to fight trafficking in persons, as well as on \r\nother, emerging, challenges that pose a threat to our \r\nsocieties. One concrete example of that support is the \r\ninitiative of Belarus to establish a global partnership \r\nagainst slavery and trafficking in persons in the \r\ntwenty-first century.  \r\n Belarus believes that the draft resolution it has \r\nprepared on improving coordination of efforts against \r\nslavery and trafficking in persons will prove to be an \r\nimportant step towards a global partnership framework. \r\nSupport for that initiative would represent a valuable \r\ncontribution to fighting an almost forgotten evil that is \r\nnow posing a growing threat to human civilization. \r\nSupport for the initiative would also mean making a \r\nsolid contribution to the common effort of building \r\ninternational peace and security. \r\n Human trafficking will never be eradicated as \r\nlong as the demand for it continues to increase. In its \r\nendeavour to ensure a stronger legal framework to hold \r\naccountable those seeking sexual relations with the \r\nvictims of trafficking, Belarus has organized a high-\r\nA/61/PV.5  \r\n \r\n06-52450 12 \r\n \r\nlevel international conference on Fighting the demand \r\nfor trafficking: ways to improve international \r\ncooperation among countries of origin and destination. \r\nBelarus will host that conference on 26 and 27 October. \r\n In early 1990s, the process of migration \r\nthroughout the vast area of the former Soviet Union \r\nsaw fundamental changes that led to enormous, out-of-\r\ncontrol migration flows. That process affected Belarus \r\nas well. The timely adoption of a State migration \r\nstrategy, along with effective legal measures and two \r\nState programmes, helped to bring order to chaotic \r\nmigration and to ensure stability within the country. \r\n Belarus has now ensured that there is adequate \r\nmigration legislation in place that complies with \r\ninternational standards. We also have a system of \r\nefficient legal and social assistance for migrants. \r\nBelarus has also established an effective legal regime \r\nfor refugees and other aliens staying in the country and \r\nhas taken practical measures to fight illegal migration \r\nand human trafficking. There is also a regime in place \r\nto cover foreign residents.  \r\n Belarus is currently implementing a third State \r\nmigration programme for 2006-2010. It aims to \r\nstrengthen State security, promote economic growth \r\nand ensure that migrants fully enjoy their legal rights. \r\n The Belarus State migration policy includes the \r\nfollowing priorities: utilizing the potential of migration \r\nto promote social, economic and demographic \r\ndevelopment; promoting the social integration of \r\nmigrants; attempting to stem the outward flow of \r\nacademics; ensuring free access to job opportunities \r\nabroad; and promoting international cooperation in the \r\nfield of migration. \r\n Given the negative impact of emigration by \r\nqualified and prospective professionals on the \r\nintellectual potential of the country, Belarus shares the \r\nview of the Secretary-General that there is a need to \r\nretain qualified professionals in countries that invest in \r\ntheir education and training. \r\n It is undeniable that the challenge of migration \r\nhas a global dimension today. Migration can therefore \r\nbe most effectively addressed only on the basis of \r\ninternational solidarity, cooperation and coordinated \r\nefforts by all interested parties. At the same time, the \r\nimmediate impact of migration and the need to tackle it \r\noften weigh most heavily upon countries that on their \r\nown are unable to implement programmes aimed at \r\nregulating migration, creating national asylum systems \r\nand confronting illegal migration. Such countries need \r\nassistance from the international community to develop \r\neffective migration policies and establish national \r\ncontrols and statistical instruments in the area of \r\nmigration. Developing countries, countries with \r\neconomies in transition, such as Belarus, and transit \r\ncountries face similar problems. \r\n Belarus is actively participating in a number of \r\ninternational and subregional forums on migration \r\nissues. We are also cooperating closely in this area both \r\nwith other States and with international organizations. \r\nOur cooperation with neighbouring countries is \r\nparticularly dynamic and productive. \r\n The Republic of Belarus proposed, and is now \r\nparticipating in, the establishment of the Euro-Asian \r\nProgramme on Forced Displacement and Migration. \r\nThe programme provides a new mechanism for \r\ndialogue and interaction on the basis of the 1996 \r\nGeneva Conference on the problems of refugees and \r\ndisplaced persons. \r\n Belarus agrees that there is a need to expand \r\ninternational cooperation and dialogue on migration. \r\nWe are still considering the proposal to establish a \r\nconsultative forum on migration. At the same time, we \r\nbelieve that while considering that proposal we need to \r\nensure that existing mechanisms for cooperation are \r\nfully utilized, especially the experience and facilities of \r\nthe International Organization for Migration. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to express the hope \r\nthat the High-level Dialogue will encourage us to take \r\nnot one but a number of steps towards our common \r\nobjective of ensuring global peace and security. \r\n The President: Before we proceed, I would like \r\nto inform members that this afternoon, before we \r\ncontinue with our list of speakers, the Chairpersons of \r\nthe four round tables will present summaries of the \r\ndeliberations of their respective sessions.  \r\n I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Jorge \r\nLázaro, Vice-Minister for Peruvian Communities \r\nAbroad of Peru. \r\n Mr. Lázaro (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): At the \r\noutset, I would like first to say that Peru associates \r\nitself with the statements delivered yesterday by the \r\nrepresentative of Guyana on behalf of the Rio Group \r\nand by the representative of South Africa on behalf of \r\nthe Group of 77 and China. \r\n A/61/PV.5\r\n \r\n13 06-52450 \r\n \r\n Peru is participating in this Dialogue with great \r\ninterest and expectations, for we believe that the call \r\nby the Secretary-General is in line with the major \r\nobjectives of countries like Peru that have a high \r\nnumber of migrants abroad.  \r\n For six years now, my country has been \r\nsystematically carrying out a policy to provide consular \r\nservices and protection on the basis of protecting the \r\ninterests and rights of Peruvians living abroad. \r\nAlthough there has been significant progress, even \r\nmore challenges remain. The current Government \r\ntherefore attaches particular importance to the \r\nprotection of Peruvians abroad. That clearly entails \r\ntaking steps at the bilateral, subregional, regional, \r\nhemispheric and international levels. As an illustration \r\nof that tangible commitment, last May Peru hosted the \r\nSpecial International Conference of Developing \r\nCountries with Substantial International Migrant \r\nFlows. The Conference adopted the Lima Declaration \r\n(A/61/91, annex), a document that I am certain will \r\nenrich our debates. \r\n We therefore believe that the time is right for the \r\ninternational community to acknowledge the \r\ncontributions of migration and to consider a renewed \r\nand multidimensional focus when putting in place \r\npolicies that are specific, viable and sustainable. That \r\nwould be a logical step to take on the path we have \r\nembarked upon to jointly address the problems and \r\npositive elements of international migration.  \r\n Progress has been made along thematic lines \r\nthanks to the dedicated work done as part of the Berne \r\nInitiative. Progress has also been made on the \r\ntheoretical and practical fronts thanks to the work of \r\nthe International Organization for Migration, an \r\norganization to which Peru is grateful for its \r\nunwavering support for our undertakings in the area of \r\nmigration. We also take note of the contribution made \r\nby the report of the Global Commission on \r\nInternational Migration.  \r\n That said, we are faced with a great \r\nresponsibility. This Dialogue aims at putting in place \r\nthe cornerstone of an ambitious agenda, namely, \r\nundertaking a shared commitment to enhance the \r\npositive impact of migration for countries of origin, \r\ntransit and destination, as well as for migrants \r\nthemselves. We now need to set into motion the \r\npolitical will of all Member States in order to reach \r\nagreement on priorities, approaches and guidelines. \r\nPeru is therefore amenable to the proposal of the \r\nSecretary-General regarding the establishment of a \r\nforum on international migration within a United \r\nNations framework. In that regard, we wish to express \r\nour gratitude for the work of Mr. Peter Sutherland. \r\n Mr. Goche (Zimbabwe), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n In that undertaking we should bear in mind that \r\nsome of the most up-to-date and advanced know-how \r\nregarding migrant protection can be found in countries \r\nof origin. In that connection, I should just like to \r\nmention two efforts in which my country has recently \r\nparticipated. The first was the decision soon to begin \r\nnegotiations with Argentina to bilateralize the Common \r\nMarket of the South Residency Agreement. That \r\nagreement is based on a legal principle that already \r\nrepresents significant progress, namely, that residency \r\nis based on proof of nationality, and not on \r\nemployment status. The second example has to do with \r\nour recent signing with Chile of a memorandum of \r\nunderstanding on employment, which is based on the \r\nUnited Nations International Convention on the \r\nProtection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and \r\nMembers of Their Families.  \r\n We have every intention of making this Dialogue \r\na success in addressing international migration and \r\ndevelopment. We are convinced that, in expressing our \r\nviews, we will also be able to learn from the lessons \r\nand other positive experiences shared here and apply \r\nthem in our country. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Emilio Giménez Franco, Vice \r\nMinister for Economic Affairs and Integration of \r\nParaguay. \r\n Mr Giménez Franco (Paraguay) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): I have the honour to speak on behalf of the \r\nSouth American Conference on Migration. I do so in \r\nmy capacity as representative of the country serving as \r\nPresident Pro Tem and in discharge of the mandate of \r\nthe Conference. \r\n The Sixth South American Conference on \r\nMigration met in Paraguay on 4 and 5 May and issued \r\nthe Asunción Declaration, which gives clear and \r\nbalanced expression to the continent’s consensus \r\nposition on migration and development, viewing them \r\nas a multidimensional phenomenon of growing \r\ncomplexity. The Asunción Declaration emphasizes the \r\nA/61/PV.5  \r\n \r\n06-52450 14 \r\n \r\nprogress that has been made in migration in the \r\nCommon Market of the South, the Andean Community \r\nand the South American Community of Nations, as \r\nwell as the unilateral measures adopted by some States \r\nin positive response to the necessities of international \r\nmigration. Such measures include the “Patria Grande” \r\nplan to regularize migration, proposed by the Republic \r\nof Argentina. \r\n The Conference urged the international \r\ncommunity to work on migration policies based on the \r\nethical dimension of respect for the rights of migrants. \r\nIt proclaimed that migration should be seen as the right \r\nof every individual and that the human rights of \r\nmigrants deserve wholehearted respect, regardless of \r\nthe migrants’ status. Migrant workers and their families \r\nshould be protected from the acts of racism, \r\nxenophobia and discrimination that are ever more \r\nfrequently seen in certain societies. We in South \r\nAmerica believe that promoting social inclusion and \r\ntolerance towards migrants and their families can \r\nmaximize the positive impact of migration.  \r\n The Asunción Declaration acknowledges the \r\nrecent strong feminization of migratory movements. \r\nAlmost half of current migrants are women, which has \r\na heavy impact on families and the social groups \r\nremaining in the countries of origin. Since women \r\nmigrants suffer two-fold discrimination, both as \r\nwomen and as migrant labourers, greater efforts must \r\nbe made to protect them, ensuring in particular the \r\nrights of women and unaccompanied minors, \r\nregardless of their status in the receiving countries. \r\n We firmly assert that migrants are the agents of \r\ndevelopment. They should be guaranteed access to the \r\nlabour market, and the receiving countries should \r\nacknowledge their professional and academic \r\ncredentials. That would help to identify the positive \r\naspects of migration, both for the migrants themselves \r\nand for the sending and receiving countries.  \r\n That connection between migration and \r\ndevelopment explains the increase in migratory flows. \r\nInequality, social exclusion, lack of opportunity and \r\nincome gaps stimulate global human mobility. They \r\nalso have an impact on the countries of origin, which \r\nlose their most skilled human resources, whose training \r\nputs enormous economic strain on developing \r\ncountries. In contrast, the receiving countries profit \r\nfrom the highly skilled human resources they host, \r\nwhich reflects the transfer of the public investment in \r\neducation made by the developing countries to the \r\ndeveloped ones. Having lost their best-trained people, \r\nthe sending countries see their productivity reduced, \r\nwhich in turn has a negative impact on their own \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n For all those reasons, we must deal with the \r\nunjustifiable contradiction that, while we promote and \r\npractice the free mobility of financial resources \r\nthrough globalization, human mobility suffers from \r\ncounter-globalization.  \r\n The remittances that emigrants send home to their \r\nfamilies are private. They must be considered as a \r\nphenomenon separate and distinct from official \r\ndevelopment assistance. We must find the mechanisms \r\nto direct those funds towards the development of the \r\nsocieties they are intended for, while ensuring the \r\nprivacy, confidentiality and security of remittances, as \r\nwell as the lowest possible cost for such transactions. \r\n Given its multidimensional complexity, the \r\nphenomenon of migration is not immune to the activities \r\nof transnational organized crime groups. Migration \r\nfrequently degenerates into violations of human rights. \r\nThe dream of building a better future for migrants and \r\ntheir families frequently leads to illegal trafficking in \r\nmigrants, trade in persons and even organ trafficking. \r\n We therefore believe that mechanisms to halt \r\nirregular migration should not limit migrants’ access to \r\ninternational protection. Migrants of irregular status, \r\nand in particular those who have fallen prey to \r\ntrafficking, should enjoy sufficient guarantees and \r\noptions from the sending, transit and receiving States \r\nin order to be able to regularize their situation, \r\ndenounce criminals, and have unrestricted access to \r\nsocial services, even if they have migrated illegally. \r\n The United Nations must be more involved in the \r\nprotection and defence of the rights of migrants. \r\nParticular consideration should be given to the \r\nsituation relating to the International Convention on \r\nthe Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers \r\nand Members of Their Families, adopted in December \r\n1990. While that instrument came into effect in 2003, \r\nonly 34 of the 192 countries of the United Nations \r\nhave ratified it to date. Many countries of our continent \r\nare not among the ratifiers. It is a troubling fact that \r\nnot one of the developed countries has ratified it. \r\n South America is a continent that has always been \r\naffected by migration, either as a destination for the \r\n A/61/PV.5\r\n \r\n15 06-52450 \r\n \r\npast five centuries or as a place of origin in recent \r\ntimes. The South American Conference on Migration \r\nrecognizes certain negative effects of migrant flows, \r\nbut many of those could be mitigated if the countries \r\ninvolved were to promote coordinated and consensual \r\nwork in the context of the principle of shared \r\nresponsibility, with a view to counteracting illicit \r\ntrafficking in migrants, the trade in persons, trafficking \r\nin minors and other related crimes, in accordance with \r\ncurrent international law. \r\n Given the many years that the countries of our \r\nregion and the Ibero-American community have been \r\nworking with the International Organization for \r\nMigration, the commitment of that organization to \r\nworking in full cooperation with the United Nations \r\nand its States Members to streamline resources and \r\nensure best practices, and Secretary-General Kofi \r\nAnnan’s concern on this issue, the initiative to create a \r\nglobal forum on migration should provide an \r\nopportunity to demonstrate that we can efficiently, \r\neffectively and transparently address the challenge of \r\nmaking global migration policies coherent.  \r\n To the extent that public policies are adopted to \r\npromote co-development in the countries of origin, \r\ntransit and destination, they will contribute to \r\nstabilizing the populations in their respective societies; \r\nthe costs and benefits of migratory flow will be \r\nassumed symmetrically by the countries concerned; \r\nmigration will be managed in a responsible, egalitarian, \r\nsecure and respectful way; and social development will \r\nensue in the terms stipulated in the United Nations \r\nDeclaration on the Right to Development and the \r\nloftiest principles of international humanitarian law. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency The Honourable Richard Msowoya, \r\nMinister of State in the Office of the President \r\nResponsible for Poverty and Disaster Management \r\nAffairs of Malawi. \r\n Mr. Msowoya (Malawi): At the outset, I would \r\nlike to associate my delegation with the statement \r\ndelivered by the representative of South Africa on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China. \r\n Let me also express the Government of Malawi’s \r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for preparing a \r\ncomprehensive and illuminating report that highlights \r\nthe multidimensional aspects of migration and \r\ndevelopment. The report clearly brings out the strong \r\nlinkages between migration and development, and it \r\nalso makes some recommendations that merit the \r\nattention and critical consideration of the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n Migration generates social, cultural and political \r\nconsequences that must be carefully considered in \r\norder to ensure that it works for both the sending and \r\nreceiving countries. We therefore welcome this \r\nopportunity to share knowledge about how to manage \r\nthe movement of people. \r\n The globalization of markets, information and \r\ntechnology, as well as the liberalization of many laws \r\naffecting individuals’ mobility, have enabled vast \r\nmovements of people on a scale never seen before. And \r\njust as they have with globalization, many of our \r\ncountries have failed to take full advantage of the \r\nbenefits of increased migration. \r\n Indeed, there are some indisputable advantages of \r\ninternational migration to the development of \r\ncountries. Those include the dynamic human link \r\nbetween cultures, economies and societies; \r\nremittances; skills and know-how accumulation; \r\ntransfer of technology and institutional knowledge; and \r\ninspiring ways of thinking, both socially and \r\npolitically, among others. However, if those are not \r\nproperly harnessed, a lot of us stand to lose. That is \r\nwhy we would like to underline the need to carefully \r\ndesign policies that will guarantee that international \r\nmigration becomes beneficial for the development of \r\nthe countries of origin and the receiving countries \r\nalike. \r\n The report of the Secretary-General states that \r\nnearly 200 million people live outside their country of \r\nbirth, and in 2005 they contributed nearly $250 billion \r\nin remittances to their countries of origin. It is now \r\nwidely acknowledged that remittances are one of the \r\ndevelopment effects of migration, particularly at the \r\nindividual or household level. While celebrating the \r\nimportance of remittances, we need to be reminded that \r\ncountries of origin certainly lose human capital through \r\nthe emigration of skilled professionals and unskilled \r\nlabourers. \r\n In the case of Malawi, for every three doctors \r\ntrained, two are likely to migrate in search of better \r\nprospects. The statistics are worse for registered \r\nnurses. For the past five years, Malawi has witnessed \r\nthe mass exodus of nurses to work in the West. That \r\nhas seriously hampered the delivery of health services \r\nat home. \r\nA/61/PV.5  \r\n \r\n06-52450 16 \r\n \r\n Brain drain is a serious deterrent to sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Therefore, there is a serious need for us \r\nto work together to come up with strategies at all levels \r\nthat will ensure that migration benefits all concerned. \r\nWe call for intensified international cooperation that \r\ncan benefit the small national economies that are most \r\nvulnerable to brain drain, particularly in such crucial \r\nsectors as health and education. \r\n Malawi would like to join some delegations that \r\nhave spoken before to advocate regular and \r\nconstructive dialogue between countries of origin and \r\ndestination in order to strengthen cooperation and to \r\nidentify common solutions, including the allocation of \r\ndevelopment aid for the eradication of poverty in \r\ncountries of origin. \r\n The need to explore other opportunities for \r\ninvolving the diaspora in development is of critical \r\nimportance. In that respect, we would like to \r\nacknowledge the Migration for Development in Africa \r\nproject, spearheaded by the International Organization \r\nfor Migration and the Transfer of Knowledge through \r\nExpatriate Nationals programmes, which have in a \r\nmodest way brought out the potential of the diaspora in \r\nthe development of their countries. Those are \r\nprogrammes that must be supported and encouraged. \r\n Furthermore, our Governments need support in \r\ntheir efforts to encourage national expatriates to return \r\nto their countries of origin directly through \r\nprofessional and financial incentives, and indirectly by \r\ncreating legal and institutional frameworks conducive \r\nto return. \r\n Malawi is supportive of the Secretary-General’s \r\nproposal to have a consultative forum that would \r\nprovide an opportunity to discuss issues relating to \r\ninternational migration and development in a \r\nsystematic and comprehensive way. We believe that \r\nthis would ensure the retention of migration and \r\ndevelopment high on the development agenda of the \r\ninternational community. \r\n Malawi has porous borders. As a transit country, \r\nwe receive a lot of asylum seekers in genuine need. \r\nHowever, transnational criminal elements have also \r\ntaken advantage of the situation to launch their \r\ncriminal activities, including trafficking of women and \r\nchildren. Those are transnational problems that require \r\ntransnational solutions. \r\n Let me conclude by emphasizing the need to \r\nplace the effective protection of the economic, social \r\nand cultural rights of the migrant at the centre of all \r\nmigration management systems. It is my delegation’s \r\nsincere hope that this dialogue will not be an end in \r\nitself. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Albert Agossou, Minister Delegate \r\nto the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Charge of African \r\nIntegration and the Diaspora of Benin. \r\n Mr. Agossou (Benin) (spoke in French): Benin \r\nwelcomes the positive initiative of the international \r\ncommunity to organize this High-level Dialogue on \r\nInternational Migration and Development. \r\n Globalization promotes the mobility of the \r\nfactors of production, including labour. Like other \r\nfactors, the cross-border mobility of labour must now \r\nrespond, in the same way as any export commodity, to \r\never-more stringent standards. That is the lesson that \r\nmy country, the Republic of Benin, has learned in its \r\nfight against unofficial and clandestine migration. In \r\nthat regard, host countries and countries of origin are \r\ncalled upon to act. As both a sending and receiving \r\ncountry, Benin has suffered the negative consequences \r\nof migration, but also benefits from some of its \r\npositive aspects.  \r\n As most reports note, migration is expected to \r\nincrease, and there is no indication that it will decrease \r\nin the medium term. On the contrary, all factors lead us \r\nto believe that not even the newly adopted immigration \r\npolicies of the northern countries will stem the brain \r\ndrain.  \r\n In addition to the traditional forms that we know \r\nand have studied, one type of migration is of particular \r\nconcern to my Government — that of vulnerable \r\npersons, such as women and children, who are subject \r\nto trafficking and human trade. Trafficking, \r\nexploitation and trade in children are the results of the \r\nlimitations and failures of the educational system. Such \r\nfailures include the facts that schooling is not \r\nuniversal; that people with higher education are finding \r\nit increasingly difficult to find work, which \r\ndiscourages parents from sending children to school; \r\nand that legislation and insufficient enforcement \r\ncannot halt the trafficking of children. \r\n As to Benin, an approximate assessment — which \r\nwe hope to develop in depth — indicates that its \r\n A/61/PV.5\r\n \r\n17 06-52450 \r\n \r\npopulation living and working outside the country \r\nstood at about 1 million in 1983 and had risen to \r\nalmost 3 million by 2005. Of those 3 million, 1.02 per \r\ncent chose Europe as a destination and 0.27 per cent \r\nchose North America. The vast majority — 98.29 per \r\ncent — live in Africa. \r\n The Government of Benin recognizes the \r\nimportance of international migration and its impact on \r\nthe country’s economy. The number of citizens \r\nconcerned, the amount of remittances sent by migrants \r\nand the tragic experience of migrants who are forced to \r\nreturn attest to the acuteness of the problem for Benin \r\nand justify the efforts made to manage the diaspora at \r\nthe institutional and political levels. \r\n I should now like to focus on the link between the \r\nprosperity of our countries — countries of origin — \r\nand the brain drain. It is acknowledged that skilled \r\nmigrants contribute to the economic growth of \r\nreceiving countries. It has also been observed that \r\nskilled migrants are less likely than those with fewer \r\nskills to send remittances to their country of origin, \r\nperhaps because of the opportunities for integration \r\noffered by the receiving country and the stability of \r\nemployment for highly skilled labour. Be that as it \r\nmay, the emigration of highly skilled labour represents \r\na direct loss in terms of the development of \r\ncommunities and countries of origin — a loss that, \r\nmembers will agree, is not offset by the remittances \r\nperiodically sent back. But we must recognize that the \r\nweakness of the productive capacities of countries of \r\norigin, which does not allow them to hold on to their \r\nskilled personnel trained at great expense, is one of the \r\nreasons for it.  \r\n However, the sending of remittances establishes a \r\ndirect link between migration and development. \r\nTherefore, above and beyond the issue of remittances, \r\nwe must operationalize existing mechanisms in order \r\nto transfer the knowledge of the diaspora to the country \r\nof origin. That would increase the contributions made \r\nby emigrants to the development of our countries.  \r\n With regard to remittances, between 1999 and \r\n2005 Beninese citizens living abroad officially \r\ntransferred to Benin a total of $698.4 million. If we \r\nlook at the purposes to which those resources were \r\nassigned, we see that, in the absence of an appropriate \r\nsource of guidance and advice, remittances are used \r\nmostly to purchase household goods and property. That \r\nhighlights the need for a policy to assist and guide \r\nmigrants so that they will want to invest in their \r\ncountry of origin.  \r\n Mindful of the importance of such remittances, \r\nBenin calls on the international community to support \r\nthe Ministerial Declaration of the Ministerial \r\nConference of the Least Developed Countries on \r\nmigrant remittances, particularly the initiative to \r\nestablish a migrant remittance observatory for least \r\ndeveloped countries. Here, I wish to reiterate my \r\ncountry’s offer to the international community to serve \r\nas the headquarters for such an observatory.  \r\n Notwithstanding the many legislative and \r\nregulatory measures already adopted, the difficulties \r\nobserved in the management of migration to promote \r\ndevelopment require that the international community \r\ntake a number of actions that would be directly in line \r\nwith the decisions of the Summit of Heads of State and \r\nGovernment of the African Union held in Banjul in \r\nJuly 2006. It should offer children who have been \r\nexcluded from the formal education system an \r\nalternative form of literacy training and education for \r\nbetter subsequent integration into the economic fabric; \r\nencourage bilateral agreements between countries of \r\nemigration and immigration to protect the rights of \r\nmigrant workers, particularly the most vulnerable \r\namong them; encourage all States to integrate into their \r\ndevelopment and poverty alleviation strategies \r\ncoherent migration policies that ensure respect for the \r\ninternationally recognized rights of migrants; provide \r\ntechnical and financial support to countries of \r\nemigration so that they raise the awareness of their \r\npopulations regarding the conditions prevailing in \r\ntraditional countries of immigration; improve \r\nknowledge about migrant workers’ rights in countries \r\nof immigration with a view to facilitating respect for \r\nthose rights; help countries to know more about their \r\ndiasporas; and promote and strengthen mechanisms to \r\nfacilitate use of the expertise of diasporas to meet the \r\nneeds of countries of origin. \r\n Benin is confident that these meetings will enable \r\nus to discuss all these issues. Following up on them \r\nwill require everyone’s support for the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s proposal to establish a consultative global \r\nforum on migration and development issues. The forum \r\nwill be a special framework for discussion and \r\nconsultation on the challenges and issues bound up \r\nwith international migration. \r\nA/61/PV.5  \r\n \r\n06-52450 18 \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHer Excellency Mrs. Rosario Graciano de los Santos, \r\nVice-Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Dominican \r\nRepublic. \r\n Mrs. Graciano de los Santos (Dominican \r\nRepublic) (spoke in Spanish): It is important for me to \r\nparticipate in this important meeting. International \r\nmigration is one of the great global phenomena of our \r\ntime. In today’s world, the mobility of people who \r\ncross international borders and move to other countries \r\nin search of better living conditions is constantly \r\nincreasing. They are driven by a lack of \r\ndevelopment — in particular, a lack of jobs and an \r\nadequate livelihood, not only for them, but also for \r\ntheir families. \r\n As representatives of Governments, we must play \r\na significant role in formulating and carrying out \r\npublic policies concerning the positive impact of \r\nmigration. We must explain the link between migration \r\nand development. Understanding and identifying the \r\nrole of countries — especially countries of \r\nimmigration — in that regard is the main challenge \r\nbefore us.  \r\n The Dominican Republic, as a country that both \r\nsends and receives migrants, has witnessed significant \r\nchanges in migration since the mid-1970s. The \r\nincreasing proportion of women migrants, the changing \r\nperception of Dominicans living abroad and the \r\nprocess of social change in the diaspora itself — \r\ncaused by the enhanced social standing of second- and \r\nthird-generation emigrants, whose social, economic \r\nand cultural conditions are better than those of their \r\nforebears — offer the best possible framework within \r\nwhich to implement policies that reflect those profound \r\nchanges. \r\n Policies on international migration are a \r\nsovereign matter for States, which have national \r\nstandards for their formulation and execution. \r\nHowever, Governments in all regions of the world are \r\naware that migration must be planned and managed \r\nthrough international coordination and cooperation.  \r\n Governments are accordingly making a point of \r\nparticipating in non-binding regional consultative \r\nforums bringing together representatives of States, \r\nnon-governmental organizations and business people, \r\namong other actors, to discuss the problem of \r\nmigration in a cooperative manner, promoting \r\nexchanges and the coordination of bilateral and \r\nmultilateral agreements on international migration. \r\n Our country joins in the efforts of the \r\ninternational community to raise awareness about the \r\ndimensions of the phenomenon of migration at the \r\nglobal level. The High-level Dialogue on International \r\nMigration and Development is an appropriate forum in \r\nwhich our countries can discuss new ideas on \r\nmigration policies aimed at promoting development. \r\nSuch policies should have both a national and a global \r\nfocus to enhance regional consultations, which thus far \r\nhave had very fruitful results for the participating \r\nStates. We hope that this important meeting will come \r\nup with proposals and recommendations that lead \r\ncountries to improve conditions so that they can meet \r\nthe challenges posed by migration and take advantage \r\nof the opportunities it offers. \r\n I should like to highlight three important \r\ninitiatives taken recently by the Government of the \r\nDominican Republic in cooperation with other \r\ncountries of the region.  \r\n First is the International Congress on Creating \r\nSynergies between Migration and Development, held \r\nin collaboration with the International Organization for \r\nMigration (IOM).  \r\n Another is the private sector forum to explore \r\nlinkages between remittances and development, \r\norganized with the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme (UNDP) and the United Nations Fund for \r\nInternational Partnerships (UNFIP), which brought \r\ntogether participants from companies dealing with \r\nremittances, microfinance and information and \r\ncommunications technology and regulators and parties \r\noffering support for projects. \r\n The third initiative is the Regional Consultation \r\non Migration, Remittances and Development in Latin \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean, organized with UNDP, the \r\nSpecial Unit for South-South Cooperation, the United \r\nNations Public-Private Alliance for Rural Development, \r\nthe United Nations International Research and Training \r\nInstitute for the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW) \r\nand others, and with support from several private-\r\nsector companies. Government, business and diaspora \r\ngroups, non-governmental groups and international \r\norganizations representing 13 countries attended, \r\nincluding Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, the Dominican \r\nRepublic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, \r\nHonduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Nicaragua and Peru. \r\n A/61/PV.5\r\n \r\n19 06-52450 \r\n \r\nPresident Leonel Fernández Reyna of the Dominican \r\nRepublic delivered an important statement on diaspora \r\nissues and remittances, and the meeting adopted a \r\ndeclaration for consideration at this High-level Dialogue. \r\n I am very pleased to make the declaration \r\navailable to this meeting. We wish to invite those \r\npresent here to give attention to the proposals in the \r\ndeclaration, and we urge that Governments and \r\ninternational bodies, especially UNDP, use them as a \r\nbasis for new policies and actions in response to the \r\nneeds and to the opportunities that we have identified. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency, Mr. Eissa Maldoun, Deputy Minister for \r\nLabour Affairs of the Syrian Arab Republic. \r\n Mr. Maldoun (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): First of all, we would like to congratulate \r\nMs. Al-Khalifa on her election to head the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-first session. We wish her every \r\nsuccess in her work and pledge the support of our \r\ndelegation. I would also like to support the statement \r\nmade by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of South \r\nAfrica, who spoke on behalf of the Group of 77 and \r\nChina.  \r\n Migration is a human phenomenon and has \r\nexisted since time immemorial. Throughout history it \r\nhas taken different forms, individually and collectively. \r\nAt the same time, it has basically been a quest for \r\nbetter living conditions, undertaken to meet the \r\neconomic needs of migrants. Migration has been a \r\nmelting pot of civilizations and cultures which has \r\noften brought together civilizations, cultures and peoples.  \r\n We cannot consider migration today without \r\ntaking into consideration globalization, which has \r\npositive and negative aspects. Since the migrant’s \r\ninterest in improving his or her living conditions is \r\nwhat dominates, globalization reflects with great \r\nclarity the need to close the gaps left by severe \r\neconomic inequalities throughout the world. We need \r\ninternational action in order to deal with the core issues \r\nof migration, economic development and the fair \r\ndistribution of wealth.  \r\n In order to draw maximum benefit from \r\ninternational migration and achieve collective \r\ndevelopment, it is necessary to develop a global \r\neconomic methodology and an international policy that \r\nrecognizes migration’s role in development. To achieve \r\nsuch a methodology, it would be wise not to consider \r\nremittances as a substitute for official development \r\nassistance (ODA).  \r\n It is also necessary to lower the costs of \r\ntransferring funds and to make sure that remittances \r\nare made easily to countries of origin without any type \r\nof discrimination whatsoever. Likewise, migrants \r\nshould be able to transfer retirement pensions without \r\nany obstacles created by the tax system of the host \r\ncountries. It is also vital to provide assistance for \r\nremittances to developing countries. Counter-terrorism \r\nlaws should not be an impediment for transfers of \r\nfunds that are necessary for development. It is just as \r\nnecessary not to impose unilateral financial restrictions \r\nthat would impede such transfers. In this context, the \r\nquestion of partnerships between associations of \r\nmigrants abroad and the Governments of their \r\ncountries of origin needs to be studied.  \r\n Our region has seen an artificial form of \r\nmigration that was not dealt with in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report (A/60/871), albeit that it has a very \r\nserious impact. In paragraph 110, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral talks about the relationship between migration \r\nand development, but does not take into account some \r\nimportant elements, such as displacement. For \r\nexample, the report does not discuss forced migration, \r\nnor the question of the protection of refugees or those \r\nwho seek asylum. \r\n Illegal migration, as we have seen in our region, \r\nparticularly among Palestinians under Israeli occupation, \r\nhas caused the displacement of hundreds of thousands \r\nof Palestinians, now numbering millions. Those people \r\nhave been forcibly displaced internally, or externally to \r\nneighbouring countries.  \r\n Syria and other countries in the region have \r\nknown various forms of migration from neighbouring \r\ncountries because of the Israeli occupation and the \r\naggressive actions that caused the forced migration of \r\nPalestinians. In addition, Syria has welcomed more \r\nthan 400,000 displaced Syrians from the Israeli-\r\noccupied Golan, more than half a million Palestinian \r\nrefugees and many more Iraqis.  \r\n The last form of migration is the temporary \r\nmigration of more than 200,000 Lebanese, a direct \r\nconsequence of the latest Israeli aggressions against \r\nLebanon. There is no need to explain to the Assembly \r\nthe magnitude of the obstacles that such migration \r\ncreates for the economic and social development of our \r\ncountry and the entire region.  \r\nA/61/PV.5  \r\n \r\n06-52450 20 \r\n \r\n The humanitarian situation that migrants face, \r\nconsidering the diverse types of migration, should be \r\nof great interest to the international community, which \r\nhas adopted a number of international instruments to \r\nregulate and maintain the rights of migrants. We \r\nbelieve that the International Convention on the \r\nProtection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and \r\nMembers of Their Families is the most comprehensive. \r\nMy country, Syria, which believes that it is necessary \r\nto preserve the rights of migrant labour, has become a \r\nparty to that Convention and to other human rights \r\nconventions that regulate human rights for workers.  \r\n We have also become a party to six international \r\ninstruments that come within the United Nations \r\nsystem of human rights conventions. Moreover, \r\ncombating the illicit trade in persons and human \r\nsmuggling requires an intensification of efforts on the \r\npart of the international community. We believe that \r\nthe best way to coordinate our actions in this area is \r\nthrough the transfer of technology that can be used to \r\nuncover such crimes. \r\n Damascus, which is the oldest capital in the \r\nworld, has experienced throughout its history 33 \r\ndifferent civilizations that have become one, thus \r\nmaking Syria and Syrian society a unique example in \r\nhistory. Syrian society is capable of accepting \r\nimmigrants and integrating them, and of engaging in a \r\ncultural and civilizational dialogue.  \r\n Over the past few centuries, Syrian emigrants \r\nhave made tremendous contributions to the civilization, \r\nculture and economy of host countries throughout the \r\nworld. Those migrants are people who have two \r\ncountries — the country of destination and the Syrian \r\nArab Republic itself. \r\n We definitely support the content of the report of \r\nthe Secretary-General. We also believe that discussions \r\non international migration policies should not be based \r\non an economic approach alone. Migration also \r\nproduces social, cultural and political effects that need \r\nto be addressed. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Asgar Alakbarov, Vice-Minister for \r\nInternal Affairs of the Republic of Azerbaijan. \r\n Mr. Alakbarov (Azerbaijan) (spoke in Russian): \r\nThe Government of the Republic of Azerbaijan \r\nwelcomes the convening of this High-level Dialogue \r\non Migration and Development, which will allow us to \r\nidentify prospects for future international cooperation \r\non migration for years to come.  \r\n In Azerbaijan, more than 20 laws and by-laws \r\nhave been enacted to regulate the migration process, \r\nmost notably the laws on migration and labour \r\nmigration. Azerbaijan is a State party to seven basic \r\nUnited Nations legal instruments on the rights of \r\nmigrants, including the United Nations Convention \r\nagainst Transnational Organized Crime and its \r\ncomplementary Protocols on migrant smuggling and \r\ntrafficking in persons. Those legal instruments laid the \r\nfoundation for a National Action Plan to Combat \r\nHuman Trafficking and a law on combating trafficking \r\nin human beings, which were adopted in 2004 and \r\n2005, respectively. National measures to regulate \r\nmigration are based on the State Concept of Migration \r\nPolicy adopted in 2004 and on the State Migration \r\nProgramme. One of the steps for the implementation of \r\nthat Programme was the establishment of the Migration \r\nService within the Ministry of Internal Affairs in 2005. \r\n Since the restoration of our national \r\nindependence in 1991, Azerbaijan has seen substantial \r\nemigration, so that it may be described as essentially a \r\ncountry of origin for migrants. The reason for that lies \r\nin the hardships ensured in the transitional period, \r\nfurther aggravated by the emergence of some one \r\nmillion refugees and internally displaced persons as a \r\nresult of the occupation of a part of Azerbaijan\u0027s \r\nterritory by Armenia. \r\n In addition, a significant number of our fellow \r\ncitizens are currently residing and working in many \r\nCommonwealth of Independent States countries. The \r\ninfluence of migrants on the social and economic life \r\nof the country is undeniable. At the same time, there \r\nappears to be a need to develop special tools to \r\nencourage the use of remittances for poverty reduction \r\nand sustainable development. There is also a need to \r\nsimplify procedures for transferring funds. Active \r\ninteraction with financial and other relevant agencies \r\nin the countries of destination offers a means of solving \r\nthis problem. \r\n Permit me to touch upon another urgent issue, \r\nnamely, protection of the rights of migrants. We cannot \r\nbut be deeply concerned at the recent increase in the \r\nnumber of manifestations of racism and xenophobia \r\ntowards migrants. Existing stereotypes of migrants \r\ncreate obstacles to their full integration into society, \r\nmaking for serious social problems. In this regard, I \r\n A/61/PV.5\r\n \r\n21 06-52450 \r\n \r\nwould like to appeal to the countries of destination to \r\nundertake the necessary measures. \r\n Trafficking in human beings is the most \r\ndangerous consequence of illegal migration; combating \r\nthat type of crime should therefore be a priority. A \r\nDepartment to Combat Human Trafficking has \r\naccordingly been established within the Ministry of \r\nInternal Affairs; a hotline has been launched with the \r\nassistance of the Organization for Security and \r\nCooperation in Europe and non-governmental \r\norganizations; and a shelter for victims of human \r\ntrafficking is currently near completion. \r\n In order both to address negative aspects of \r\nmigratory processes and to benefit from their positive \r\npotential, an active and efficient partnership is needed \r\nbetween the countries of origin and the countries of \r\ndestination, as well as close cooperation between \r\nGovernment agencies, the private sector and civil \r\nsociety. Cooperation with relevant international \r\norganizations is equally important. In this context, the \r\nwork of the Global Migration Group is crucial. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to acknowledge the \r\nefficient and consistent activities of the International \r\nOrganization for Migration. I am confident that, in \r\nclose collaboration with the United Nations, the IOM \r\nwill contribute significantly to addressing the urgent \r\nissues under discussion during this Dialogue. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on Her \r\nExcellency Mrs. Ana Eugenia Durán, Vice-Minister of \r\nGovernment and Policy of Costa Rica. \r\n Mrs. Durán (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nwould like to begin my statement by reiterating Costa \r\nRica’s full support for what has been said by the \r\ndelegations of South Africa and Guyana on behalf of \r\nthe Group of 77 and China and the Rio Group, \r\nrespectively.  \r\n In those group statements, the global nature of \r\nmigration was reiterated, as was the need to address the \r\nphenomenon from an equally global perspective. We \r\nemphasized the challenges before us and the \r\nadvantages that together we must turn to best account. \r\nThe link between migration and development, the \r\nimpact of globalization, the increasing feminization of \r\nmigration and the need to address this complex topic in \r\nhuman terms, as well as from a human rights \r\nperspective, is a constant that must be emphasized at \r\nevery opportunity. \r\n My delegation understands that we have been \r\ninvited to a Dialogue and, accordingly, we hope to \r\nbenefit not only from the experiences and aspirations \r\nwe share with one another, but also, and in particular, \r\nfrom the concrete, positive results emanating from this \r\ninteraction. \r\n I should like to share some data regarding the \r\nsituation in my country. Before doing so, I avail myself \r\nof this opportunity to congratulate our brothers from \r\nGuatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua, \r\nwho, together with Costa Rica, today are celebrating \r\nour Day of Independence. \r\n Although a small and developing country, Costa \r\nRica is ranked by the United Nations Population \r\nDivision as first among destination countries in Latin \r\nAmerica and ninth worldwide. Translated into figures, \r\nthat means that, in February of this year, 10 per cent of \r\nour population were migrants, which explains why the \r\ntopic is of particular importance to us. \r\n It seems clear that the vast majority of our \r\ncountries are simultaneously countries of origin, transit \r\nand destination. However, there is still a preconceived \r\nidea that migration in our time is a North-South \r\nphenomenon. Statistics reveal how distant from reality \r\nthat is. \r\n The phenomenon of South-South migration \r\nshould also be considered in all of its facets and \r\nimplications. Accordingly, one of the greatest \r\nchallenges to a developing country that is mainly a \r\ndestination country is to take duly into account the \r\nincrease in demand for basic services to ensure that \r\nthere will be a life of dignity for the entire population, \r\nincluding the migrant population. That is the greatest \r\nchallenge facing the developing countries. \r\n As a country committed to the promotion and \r\ndefence of human rights, Costa Rica is convinced that \r\nany migration legislation and policy should protect \r\nagainst all forms of racism and discrimination, \r\nsquarely oppose xenophobia and promote positive \r\nmaximization of the benefits of contact between \r\nimmigrants and local inhabitants. \r\n At the same time, it is clear that the Government \r\nmust guarantee the security and well-being of its \r\ncitizens, taking appropriate measures within the rule of \r\nlaw to prevent the entry and residence of foreigners \r\nwhose criminal backgrounds or illegal behaviour \r\nsuggest that they might jeopardize security. \r\nA/61/PV.5  \r\n \r\n06-52450 22 \r\n \r\n This is a difficult balance to strike. To do so, \r\nCosta Rica has identified the following three basic \r\naspects among others. The phenomenon of migration \r\nshould be addressed at the national level by bringing \r\ntogether all the sectors concerned, both positively and \r\nnegatively, avoiding the temptation of short-term \r\npolitical gains and giving priority to an approach that \r\nprovides guarantees and has a human face. The \r\ninternational community must take joint action to \r\nensure that migration is orderly and safe and that it \r\nrespects human rights of all. The international \r\ncommunity must provide focal points for cooperation \r\nand development, focusing on individuals and ensuring \r\ntheir well-being. Attainment of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals is important but insufficient. \r\n This requires a high degree of coordination and \r\ncooperation by all sectors at the national and \r\ninternational levels. It also calls for deep knowledge \r\nand understanding about the social, economic and \r\ninstitutional repercussions of migration, in both \r\ncountries of destination and countries of origin and \r\ntransit. \r\n Finally, any discussion of the issue of migration \r\nas well as its causes and consequences in Latin \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean should take into account \r\nthat approximately 90 per cent of the Latin Americans \r\nliving in extreme poverty live in middle-income \r\ncountries. The priorities of international cooperation \r\nshould take this reality into account. \r\n We look forward to the day when we can say that \r\nthe citizens of all our countries are residing in the place \r\nof their free choice with an adequate and dignified \r\nstandard of living. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nMr. José Mandra, Vice-Minister of the Interior of \r\nMozambique. \r\n Mr. Mandra (Mozambique) (spoke in \r\nPortuguese; English text provided by the delegation): \r\nMy delegation wishes to associate itself with the \r\nstatement made by the Minister of Home Affairs of \r\nSouth Africa on behalf of the Group 77 and China. \r\n Migration has now reached unprecedentedly high \r\nlevels owing to, among other factors, greater access to \r\ntravel, persistent regional and subregional economic \r\ndisparities, natural disasters, armed conflicts, political \r\ninstability and the vulnerability of national borders. \r\nMigration is inevitable and unstoppable as long as \r\nthere is a deep imbalance of development among \r\ncountries. This should not be viewed as a problem or \r\nthreat. If well coordinated between countries of origin \r\nand destination, it can produce positive effects on the \r\neconomy and can create jobs and generate profits. In \r\nAfrica, and in particular in my country, Mozambique, \r\nas far as labour is concerned, migration of the work \r\nforce is a current and historical reality with a direct \r\nimpact on the economy and society. \r\n The approach to the problem of immigration \r\nshould bear in mind respect for human rights and \r\ndignity, regional and international cooperation and the \r\nsharing of responsibilities among countries of origin, \r\ntransit and destination. The relationship between \r\nmigration and development cannot be separated. On \r\nthe one hand, migration enriches the culture and \r\nsociety of host countries, with far-reaching \r\nimplications for employment and economic growth. On \r\nthe other hand, however, migration can lead to a brain \r\ndrain that reduces the active population and qualified \r\nwork force in the countries of origin. \r\n In addressing the issue of international migration \r\nand development, we acknowledge the need to build a \r\nbroad political consensus concerning the challenges \r\nfaced by the international community: challenges such \r\nas security, organized crime, pressure on resources, \r\ndevelopment inequalities and imbalances, xenophobia, \r\nunemployment and legal differences. \r\n Notwithstanding such issues, as far as the \r\nSouthern Africa Development Community (SADC) is \r\nconcerned, free movement of persons through the \r\nterritory of other countries can be an enabling factor in \r\nthe regional integration process. Free movement of \r\npersons is the most visible way in which ordinary \r\ncitizens benefit from the building of a community of \r\nStates. Accordingly, we argue for adopting an \r\nincremental approach to problems related to migration, \r\nthrough the adoption of policies within the framework \r\nof community organizations aimed at regional \r\nintegration. These policies would include the \r\nmanagement and monitoring of migration, migratory \r\nlabour, forced displacement, national and international \r\nsecurity and stability, crisis prevention and \r\nmanagement, conflict resolution, and international and \r\nregional cooperation. \r\n On the relationship between migration and \r\ndevelopment, Mozambique subscribes to the priorities \r\nestablished under the African Common Position aimed \r\n A/61/PV.5\r\n \r\n23 06-52450 \r\n \r\nat mitigating poverty, which include agriculture and \r\nrural development, good governance, harmonization of \r\neconomic and social policies, improved protection of \r\nwomen, youth, and persons with disabilities, the \r\nstrengthening of regional, interregional and \r\ninternational cooperation and the promotion of health \r\nsector policies. \r\n Recognizing the importance of migration and its \r\nconsequences for the economic, political, social and \r\ncultural life of our continent, Governments took \r\nimportant steps to define a strategic framework for a \r\njoint African migration policy. The overall objective of \r\nthat strategic framework is to encourage African States \r\nto integrate migration issues into their national and \r\nregional agendas through the development of national \r\nmigration policies. The framework is intended to \r\naddress a number of challenges that arise from \r\ninternational migration, including threats to peace and \r\nsecurity, mechanisms for the protection of refugees and \r\ncombating transnational organized crime, development \r\nof human resources to mitigate the effects of the brain \r\ndrain, promotion of regional cooperation and \r\nintegration, promotion of economic growth and trade \r\nthrough the development of infrastructure and the \r\ncreation of an environment conducive to the \r\nparticipation of migrants, particularly those in the \r\ndiasporas, in the development of their countries of \r\norigin through the transfer of know-how, savings and \r\nremittances. \r\n The President returned to the Chair. \r\n The inputs resulting from this High-level \r\nDialogue on International Migration and Development \r\nwill encourage the mainstreaming of migration into the \r\ndevelopment strategies of our countries, regions and \r\ncontinents, through the promotion of coherent and \r\ncoordinated policies. \r\n The President: I call on Mr. Carlos López, \r\nUnder-Secretary on Migratory Issues, Ministry for \r\nForeign Affairs of Ecuador. \r\n Mr. López (Ecuador) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nEcuador fully endorses the statements made by the \r\nrepresentative of Jamaica on behalf of the Group of 77 \r\nand China and by the representative of Guyana on \r\nbehalf of the Rio Group. \r\n Ecuador is one of a small number of countries \r\nthat is both a country of origin and a country of \r\ndestination for migrants. In addition, Ecuador receives \r\ndisplaced persons from other countries, a phenomenon \r\nthat differs from but is complementary to migration, \r\nmaking it the country with the largest number of \r\nrefugees in Latin America. This has made it necessary \r\nto formulate new political policies and massive \r\neconomic efforts that, without cooperation from the \r\ninternational community — which is still not \r\nenough — cannot succeed.  \r\n The shared responsibility between countries of \r\norigin and countries of destination in the search for \r\nsolutions on migratory issues must not disregard the \r\nrole of transit countries. This will also enhance the \r\nstruggle against illegal trafficking in humans, which \r\ninvolves resources greater than those of drug \r\ntrafficking, and will help us tackle the corruption that \r\npromotes it and the evil effects of human smuggling.  \r\n Ecuador, together with Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, \r\nColombia, Chile, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay \r\nand Venezuela signed the Asunción Declaration \r\n(A/61/86, annex) that emanated from the South \r\nAmerican Conference on Migration, which enshrined \r\nthe principle of shared responsibility. \r\n Ecuador has undertaken actions in cooperation \r\nwith friendly countries, international organizations, \r\ncivil society and the public sector, such as voluntary \r\nreturn programmes with the cooperation of the \r\nInternational Organization for Migration (IOM) and the \r\nsignature of agreements, such as the one signed with \r\nSpain to regulate and manage migratory flows. This is \r\na bilateral pilot programme that guarantees secure \r\nlabour contracts under conditions that are equal for the \r\ncitizens of both signatories, without intervention of \r\nthird parties and in accordance with labour-employer \r\nnorms. \r\n Domestically, the National Plan for Ecuadorians \r\nLiving Abroad establishes the basis for \r\ncomprehensively addressing migration issues, in a way \r\nthat ensures that the State will guarantee the rights of \r\nits citizens anywhere in the world and promote their \r\ndynamic reintegration into national development \r\nefforts. An important experience is the creation of the \r\nWorking Group on Employment Migration that \r\ncontributes to the establishment of public policies on \r\nmigration from the perspective of migrant rights. It \r\nincludes the participation of civil society, international \r\norganizations and public institutions. Furthermore, on \r\n30 August 2006, the President approved the National \r\nPlan of Action against kidnapping, illegal trafficking in \r\nA/61/PV.5  \r\n \r\n06-52450 24 \r\n \r\nmigrants, sexual and labour exploitation and other \r\nkinds of exploitation and prostitution of women, \r\nchildren and teenagers. \r\n The most vulnerable population — women, \r\nchildren and seniors — faces the destruction of the \r\nfamily environment, suffers the consequences of \r\ndisplacement and the loss of their roots and is \r\nsusceptible to sexual exploitation, school exclusion and \r\nwork discrimination. Respect for human rights is the \r\npath to the achievement of the Millennium Goals. \r\n One key effect of migration for the Ecuadorian \r\neconomy is remittances, which have now become our \r\nsecond largest source of income. In that connection, \r\nEcuador has focused its action on reducing the cost of \r\ntransfers, through agreements signed by the central \r\nbank with the participation of a large number of non-\r\nofficial entities, and always taking into account the \r\nprivate nature of those funds. Simultaneously, \r\ncampaigns to encourage the proper use of remittances \r\nin productive projects have been initiated. Due to high \r\nmigration among developing countries, the question of \r\nremittances will become a new area of South-South \r\ncooperation. \r\n Migrant associations in receiving countries are \r\nfocal points to channel the ambitions of citizens living \r\nabroad and should become a good mechanism for \r\nencouraging intercultural exchange, for adaptation to \r\nthe environment and for spreading the concept of \r\nco-development. That concept should be reflected, \r\nessentially, in the transfer of technology from receiving \r\ncountries to countries of origin and in transfer of the \r\nabilities and skills of migrant human resources. Nor \r\nmust we forget projects that strengthen migrants’ ties \r\nwith their countries of origin through opportunities to \r\ninvest in their communities. \r\n The principle of sovereignty must not diminish \r\nthe rights of the migrant, irrespective of their legal \r\nstatus. It should, however, guarantee with tolerance, \r\nthe peaceful integration of individuals into receiving \r\nsocieties. Regularization of the status of migrants is an \r\nobjective that benefits both origin and destination \r\ncountries, as well as migrants themselves, without \r\ncriminalizing them. \r\n Finally, my country considers that integration \r\nprogrammes should facilitate migration and broaden \r\nthe concept of the free transit of persons, as well as of \r\ngoods, services and capital. These are the challenges of \r\nthis Dialogue: to convert migration into a source of \r\nwealth and development and to ensure that migration \r\nbecomes voluntary, and never forced. In that way, we \r\nwill meet the expectations that have brought us to this \r\nDialogue, which we hope will continue through the \r\nglobal forum. Here, we thank Belgium for offering to \r\nhost the forum’s first meeting. \r\n The President: I give the floor to His Excellency \r\nThe Honourable Germán Espinal, Director-General of \r\nMigration of Honduras.   \r\n Mr. Espinal (Honduras) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nHonduras welcomes the convening of this High-level \r\nDialogue. Without doubt, it provides an excellent \r\nopportunity to address the phenomenon of migration \r\nfrom a holistic and multifaceted perspective, by \r\nidentifying and defining the elements of the migration \r\nagenda, as well as the necessary follow-up machinery. \r\nWe also wish to say how pleased we are to see you, \r\nMadam, elected as President of the General Assembly; \r\nwe are confident that your diplomatic experience will \r\nensure the success of our proposed objectives.  \r\n Today, 15 September, we celebrate the \r\nindependence of the Central American countries. That \r\nis a very fortunate coincidence. Historically, Honduras \r\nhas been a country of origin for migrants, but it is also \r\nlocated in a transit region and has been a country of \r\ndestination, receiving populations that have been \r\ndisplaced for labour reasons — displacement explained \r\nby high population density — or that sought refuge \r\nduring the decade of military-political conflict. Despite \r\nour limitations, we Hondurans have been able to share \r\nsolidarity, friendship and hospitality, often flying in the \r\nface of the political agenda of the day.  \r\n Honduras considers that an effective strategic \r\nmigration agenda must include basic components such \r\nas: respect for labour-related human rights that \r\nsafeguard the dignity of migrants, particularly the most \r\nvulnerable groups — women and children; combating \r\ntrafficking in humans and rehabilitating its victims; and \r\nensuring the protection of migrants. We call for a \r\nholistic vision; that requires increased international \r\ncooperation directed towards developing \r\ncompetitiveness and transforming the backwardness in \r\nstandards of living. That will result in a better life for \r\nthe entire population.  \r\n At the same time, we must recognize the \r\ninterconnection among labour markets, which involves \r\nthe sharing of experiences in order to develop \r\ninnovative proposals that can promote the mobility of \r\n A/61/PV.5\r\n \r\n25 06-52450 \r\n \r\nindividuals as part of a controlled, safe and transparent \r\nmigration which uses duration of residency in the \r\ndestination country as one of its basic criteria. \r\nHonduras also would like to reaffirm the need to \r\nreform the programmes of international agencies that \r\nare directly or indirectly involved with migration. \r\n Without downplaying the conceptual aspects of \r\nmigration, we believe that in order to address \r\ndeteriorating social conditions, increased poverty and \r\ngrowing inequity, Latin American societies are \r\nconsidering alternative models of development. Given \r\ngrowing and justified protest by the impoverished \r\nmajority, the need for structural reforms to achieve \r\nmore equitable development becomes more evident \r\neach day. Social marginalization, corruption and a lack \r\nof jobs and opportunity cause a large part of the \r\nemigrant population to travel to developed countries. \r\n This underscores the necessity of embracing the \r\nprinciple of shared responsibility, and of continuously \r\nstrengthening international cooperation in support of \r\nemerging migratory processes that promote integration. \r\nWe draw support from the political will expressed by \r\nour heads of State at various summits, notably at the \r\nPanama Summit held earlier this year, and we stress \r\nthe need for programmes promoting the free movement \r\nof persons, goods and services. \r\n The outcomes of such initiatives were first \r\napplied in the region that includes Nicaragua, \r\nGuatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. There, the basic \r\nelements of a consensus-based migration policy are \r\nbeing adopted, the result of a search for solutions \r\ninvolving Government efforts, civil society \r\nparticipation and support from international and \r\nregional-integration organizations. \r\n The Secretary-General of the Central American \r\nIntegration System (SICA) calls for and supports that \r\ncoordination. The SICA secretariat offers technical \r\nassistance to develop a technological platform \r\nencompassing the migration agenda in the region I just \r\nmentioned, as well as other important actions. \r\n The International Organization for Migration \r\n(IOM) is contributing by providing technical assistance \r\nat all levels. Forums for dialogue and coordination are \r\nbeing activated within the context of the Regional \r\nConference on Migration and the Central American \r\nCommission for Migration. In that environment where \r\ninitiatives are proposed and formulated, the region has \r\nthe opportunity to promote and consolidate democracy \r\nby supporting comprehensive development through \r\nreforms aimed at regional stability. Helping ease crises \r\nin countries of origin by providing assistance and \r\npermitting relief in the form of migrants’ remittances \r\nleads to policies of solidarity and hence to an effective \r\nmedium-term solution and matching commitments by \r\nLatin American countries and developed countries. \r\n But if this remittance income is no longer \r\nreceived and if additional migrants are barred from \r\nentry, the result would be to exacerbate not only the \r\neconomic crisis, but also the social and political \r\nproblems in countries of origin, thereby straining the \r\nalready deficient capacity of our countries to respond \r\nto overpopulation.  \r\n We believe that tightening measures to curb the \r\nflow of migrants would exacerbate the already critical \r\nsituation in the region and would threaten the viability \r\nof structural reforms that can ensure stability. The \r\nmeasures that have been implemented are signs — both \r\nconcrete and symbolic — of a rejection of migrants, \r\nand, as a real threat to the safety and human rights of \r\nmigrants, they fuel a broad rejection of such policies. \r\n Let me touch on the process of deciding on and \r\nformulating foreign policy. Those aspects ought to be \r\ntaken into account, as the approach here will determine \r\nwhether Central America forms strategic alliances to \r\nachieve development or encounters conflicting \r\napproaches involving further obstacles and hostility \r\nthat would surely worsen the crisis that characterizes \r\ninternational relations. \r\n Honduras enthusiastically welcomes the proposed \r\nestablishment of a global forum on international \r\nmigration, involving the United Nations. This would \r\nbring together actors in the sphere of migration and \r\npromote the sharing of experiences. We reaffirm the \r\nneed to strengthen complementary efforts of \r\ninternational cooperation and to enhance mutual \r\nbenefits. \r\n In conclusion, I recall again that Honduras stands \r\nready to participate in and support activities that will \r\ncontribute to building the institutional and conceptual \r\nframework that is necessary for our region, for the \r\nUnited Nations and for the international community in \r\ngeneral, and that will lead to effective cooperation.   \r\n The President: I now give the floor to Her \r\nExcellency Ms. Belela Herrera, Vice-Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Uruguay.  \r\nA/61/PV.5  \r\n \r\n06-52450 26 \r\n \r\n Ms. Herrera (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nwould like to thank the Secretariat for its work to \r\npromote and ensure the success of this High-level \r\nDialogue. Uruguay is firmly committed to its success. \r\n For the Iberian-American countries, the issue of \r\ninternational migration is a priority. It is being \r\naddressed as a focal point of the upcoming summit of \r\nIbero-American heads of State, to be held in \r\nMontevideo from 3 to 5 November 2006. Uruguay \r\nwould like to congratulate the Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Kofi Annan, and the Special Representative of the \r\nSecretary-General on international migration, and \r\ndevelopment, Mr. Peter Sutherland, for their \r\ncontribution to ensuring that the issue of migration is \r\nincluded on the world social agenda. \r\n Uruguay entirely agrees with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that this matter concerns all countries, \r\nirrespective of whether they are countries of origin or \r\ncountries of destination. Many countries are both, and \r\nmigration issues should thus be a matter for close \r\ncooperation between countries of origin and of \r\ndestination to address migration in all its complexity. \r\nIn view of the global nature of the issue, it must be \r\naddressed multilaterally. Accordingly, Uruguay \r\nsupports the proposed establishment of a standing \r\nforum in the United Nations framework to address the \r\ncomplex issues of migration. \r\n We reaffirm the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) and believe that a genuine commitment to \r\nthem by Member States would diminish the inequities \r\nand eliminate the more negative aspects of migration. \r\nThrough co-development, migration should no longer \r\nbe a flight forward imposed by poverty. Our country \r\nbelieves that full recognition of the individual human \r\nand social rights of migrants and their families is \r\nfundamental, and emphasizes the need for full \r\nimplementation by all Member States of the \r\nInternational Convention on the Protection of the \r\nRights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their \r\nFamilies. \r\n In our region, the sixth South American \r\nConference on Migration unanimously endorsed the \r\nDeclaration of Asuncion in March 2006. It emphasizes \r\na set of guiding principles that are essential when \r\nconsidering the topic. In the context of the States \r\nmembers of the Common Market of the South \r\n(MERCOSUR), heads of State agreed to sign the \r\nintra-MERCOSUR treaty on free residency, which \r\nguarantees the rights and mobility of persons from \r\nmember States of that regional grouping. \r\n In my own country, we have launched a \r\ndetermined strategy to connect with the more than half \r\nmillion Uruguayan emigrants, who account for 13 per \r\ncent of our population. In formulating that strategy, we \r\ntook into account the valuable contributions made by \r\ncivil society organizations and academia. Civil society \r\nhas also played a very important role in providing \r\nadvice to develop the migration law that will be \r\nintroduced in the Uruguayan parliament in the coming \r\ndays.  \r\n With regard to nationality and citizenship, we \r\nhave been working to provide proof of Uruguayan \r\ncitizenship to nationals abroad in order to facilitate the \r\nfull regularization of their status in their countries of \r\ndestination. We are also pursuing the necessary legal \r\nchannels to enable Uruguayans to vote when abroad, \r\nthis being one of the core elements of linkage. \r\n On the economic and business front, progress has \r\nbeen made in drawing up important agreements with \r\nfinancial institutions in order to make remittances part \r\nof the banking system, thereby reducing their cost. We \r\nhave also established links with Uruguayan groups in \r\norder to encourage them to invest their savings and \r\ncapital in Uruguay, as well as to promote such efforts \r\nmore broadly in communities in receiving States.   \r\n In addressing the various needs and requests of \r\nUruguayans abroad, we are providing access to health \r\nservices, housing and insurance, all closely linked to \r\nthe remittance system that has been developed with our \r\ncentral bank at the centre. \r\n In the area of culture, we are developing a set of \r\nprogrammes and measures aimed at strengthening the \r\ncultural identity of Uruguayans abroad. They include \r\ndistance learning, support and promotion of the \r\nSpanish language, cultural products, exhibitions of \r\nUruguayan art and artists in the various Uruguayan \r\ncommunities abroad and, in particular, encouraging \r\ntravel by highly qualified Uruguayans in academic, \r\nartistic and business circles. The aim is to give \r\nUruguayans abroad access to the country’s rich \r\nheritage without their having necessarily to return.  \r\n Lastly, our system of linkages implies a new form \r\nof citizen participation in the country of origin while \r\nresiding elsewhere. To this end, we have sought to \r\norganize communities abroad, in order that they may \r\n A/61/PV.5\r\n \r\n27 06-52450 \r\n \r\nhave places to meet for discussions and suggestions \r\nwith regard to their own problems or those of \r\nUruguayan society at large. We believe that this \r\napproach could be a good way to manage migration \r\nwhile respecting human rights and fostering the \r\nparticipation of migrant groups.  \r\n In conclusion, we would like to reaffirm that it is \r\nour joint responsibility to ensure that migration results \r\nin an enriching cross-cultural experience that \r\nultimately brings about true progress for civilization. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Zvonko Zinrajh, State Secretary \r\nand Deputy Minister of Interior of Slovenia. \r\n Mr. Zinrajh (Slovenia): With almost 200 million \r\ninternational migrants in the world — and with trends \r\nthat indicate that those numbers will grow even further \r\nin the future and become more widespread than they \r\nare at the moment — Slovenia believes it is necessary \r\nto enhance dialogue and cooperation between \r\nGovernments in order to act in a more coherent way.  \r\n We are convinced that special attention must be \r\npaid to protecting human rights and guaranteeing \r\nsecurity. Those are two essential elements in the area \r\nof preventing illegal migratory flows, and in particular \r\nin combating trafficking in human beings. In that \r\nregard, greater emphasis should be placed on a new \r\nconcept of human security that shifts the focus from \r\nsecurity policies mainly concerned with the protection \r\nof State territories to those focused on people, \r\nregardless of gender, race, religion, ethnicity, \r\ncitizenship or other distinguishing characteristics. \r\n When managed effectively, migration can have a \r\nsubstantially positive impact on both the country of \r\ndestination and the country of origin, as well as on the \r\nmigrants themselves. We therefore underline the need \r\nfor a balanced, global, coherent and comprehensive \r\napproach that harnesses the benefits of regular \r\nmigration, develops policies to address irregular \r\nmigration and includes cooperation with third \r\ncountries. \r\n One of the most important elements of holistic \r\nmigration policies is the link between migration and \r\ndevelopment. In that regard, more consideration should \r\nbe given both to how migration issues can be \r\nintegrated into poverty reduction strategies, and other \r\nnational development strategies of partner countries, \r\nand to how donors can support partners’ priorities in \r\nthat context. That would include policy responses to \r\nbrain drain and an answer to the question on how to \r\nmaximize the impact of remittances, which remain \r\nprivate funds and should not be seen as a replacement \r\nfor official development assistance. \r\n Slovenia also recognizes the need for concrete \r\nactions in order to deal efficiently with trafficking in \r\nhuman beings, the smuggling of immigrants and other \r\nacute problems. It is becoming evident that, while \r\nillegal migratory flows and the accompanying criminal \r\nactivity can be limited by repressive measures and \r\npolicing operations, they cannot be entirely curbed or \r\nprevented in the long term. \r\n Unfortunately, numerous organized criminal \r\ngangs take advantage of the hardships of migrants, \r\nusing them to generate profits, subjecting them to a \r\nrelationship of slavery and forcing them into criminal \r\nactivity. People become victims of the greed of others \r\nand are often entirely unprotected, in particular the \r\nmost vulnerable groups, such as women and children. \r\nThe fight against human trafficking and the smuggling \r\nof immigrants is central to eradicating forced and \r\nbonded labour, as well as organized crime. Owing to its \r\nspecific nature and the conscious violation of the basic \r\nhuman rights of the victims, trafficking in human \r\nbeings in particular is becoming one of the most \r\nimportant challenges at the global level. \r\n Preventing and suppressing human trafficking \r\ncalls for various measures, including prevention \r\nefforts, providing assistance and protection to victims, \r\ncriminalizing trafficking activities and organizing \r\nawareness-raising programmes. Last, and most \r\nimportant, there is a need to eliminate the root causes \r\nof trafficking — such as poverty, social alienation and \r\nexclusion, discrimination against women and children \r\nand the lack of equal opportunities — and to reduce the \r\nhigh demand in destination countries. Important legal \r\ninstruments have been adopted at the international \r\nlevel intended to prevent human trafficking. However \r\nthey have not yet been fully implemented everywhere. \r\nWe call on Member States to speed up the process of \r\nratification of the international instruments concerned \r\nin order for the necessary measures to be implemented \r\nin practice. \r\n Slovenia welcomes the purposes and goals of the \r\nHigh-level Dialogue in the search for sustainable \r\nsolutions to real problems, with the aim of improving \r\nA/61/PV.5  \r\n \r\n06-52450 28 \r\n \r\nthe relationship between development benefits and the \r\nnegative consequences of international migration.  \r\n This is a long process, which requires the \r\nconsistent implementation of measures at the global \r\nlevel. We believe that high-level dialogue can make a \r\nsignificant contribution to enabling the participating \r\ncountries and organizations to make migration work \r\nbetter for development, promoting cooperation and \r\nfresh approaches, thereby enriching the overall \r\ndiscourse on international migration, improving both \r\nbilateral and multilateral cooperation, especially within \r\nthe United Nations, and developing more effective \r\nmigration policies. \r\n The President: I give the floor to His Excellency \r\nMr. Gagik Yeganian, Vice-Minister for Territorial \r\nAdministration of Armenia. \r\n Mr. Yeganian (Armenia) (spoke in Russian): This \r\nHigh-level Dialogue is in itself proof that the problem \r\nof regulating migration processes has long transcended \r\nnations and States and even bilateral and regional \r\ncooperation. Today, it is truly a global problem. For \r\nArmenia, regulating migration is an issue of strategic \r\nimportance, since, after independence, our country was \r\nforced to confront — among other problems — the \r\nchallenge of an unprecedented number of displaced \r\npersons. Armenia experienced every form of migratory \r\nflow, including the consequences of the deportation of \r\nmore than 360,000 refugees from Azerbaijan to \r\nArmenia as a result of the conflict in Karabakh, and the \r\nimmigration of about 1 million people — about one \r\nthird of the population — from Armenia. \r\n Given the serious problems caused by such large-\r\nscale migratory flows, we must examine the \r\nrelationship between migration and development as it \r\naffects both host countries and countries of origin. This \r\nis something that Armenia has done. I believe that \r\nmany representatives in this Hall are well aware of the \r\ncontribution that the more than 1 million people who \r\nconstitute the Armenian diaspora make to the countries \r\nwhere they live. According to studies by independent \r\nexperts, in the Russian Federation alone — which in \r\nrecent years has received many people from \r\nArmenia — Armenian migrants have created more than \r\n1 million jobs.  \r\n Furthermore, remittances from migrant workers \r\nand Armenians living abroad have had a significant \r\neconomic impact in terms of the ability of our country \r\nto achieve double-digit economic growth for the past \r\nfour years. For Armenia, the effect of migration on \r\ndevelopment processes can be directly linked to \r\nremittances as a source of investment in our economy. \r\nAccording to information from the Central Bank, \r\nindividuals inject annually about $1 billion into \r\nArmenia’s economy. The majority — 76 per cent — of \r\nthose funds are spent on consumer goods; only 2 per \r\ncent is invested in economic activities. We must, \r\ntherefore, as a matter of urgency, use such funds as a \r\nsource of investment in the economy. \r\n We are taking the very first steps in this area — \r\nthe issue is on our agenda for cooperation with the \r\nInternational Fund for Agricultural Development. In \r\nthis regard, we are very interested in establishing \r\ndialogue with other countries and international \r\norganizations, especially since a number of European \r\nUnion countries have been conducting similar \r\nprogrammes with success. \r\n Providing assistance to migrant workers to help \r\nthem to find legal work is one of the objectives of our \r\ndiscussions at this meeting. Many developed countries \r\nare routinely meeting their demand for labour through \r\nrecourse to migrants from developing countries. Such \r\nmigrants take jobs which are traditionally considered to \r\nbe unattractive by the local population, but they also \r\nwork in other areas, including medical services and \r\ninformation technology. \r\n However, legislation relating to migration in \r\ndeveloped countries sometimes automatically makes \r\nsuch people illegal immigrants. I believe that it is high \r\ntime that we found a way to overcome this problem. I \r\nwould suggest that, as a first step, host countries \r\nprovide countries of origin with information regarding \r\nthe demand for work in their labour markets. Specific \r\ngovernmental organizations that help foreign workers \r\ncould advise on procedures in this area and on related \r\nissues. I am deeply convinced that such cooperation \r\ncould be an effective alternative means of combating \r\nillegal migration. \r\n In the context of migration and development, we \r\nattach importance to promoting migrant return. We \r\nfully agree with the Secretary-General that the major \r\nobjective of any migration policy must be to provide \r\nall those who want to live and work in their home \r\ncountries the opportunity to do so.  \r\n I would like to inform the Assembly that, for the \r\nreturn of Armenian citizen migrants, we have \r\nconcluded agreements with three European countries, \r\n A/61/PV.5\r\n \r\n29 06-52450 \r\n \r\ncompleted negotiations with five others and are \r\ncontinuing negotiations with another five. Our \r\nexperience tells us that, in order to avoid the recycling \r\nof irregular migrants, it is necessary to add \r\nreintegration programmes when we readmit. We are \r\ncurrently conducting such programmes with the \r\nGovernments of Switzerland and of France. \r\nFurthermore, we are planning to set up a centre that \r\nwill not only give assistance to returning migrants but \r\nalso provide them with an opportunity, before they \r\nreturn, to go online directly so as to contact the \r\nrelevant Government organizations in Armenia and to \r\nreceive information that is of interest to them. \r\n In many countries throughout the world there is a \r\nsaying to the effect that a good beginning is half the \r\nbattle. That axiom is applicable to this meeting, too. \r\nWe see this as the beginning of a long-term path \r\ntowards dialogue within the United Nations on \r\nmigration issues. At the same time, ultimate success in \r\nthis area will, to a large extent, depend on follow-up. \r\nThe implementation of any recommendations that \r\ncome out of these meetings will require institutional \r\ncapacity, and in our view the International \r\nOrganization for Migration, which has institutional \r\nnetworks throughout the world, could help to reinforce \r\nthat mission. \r\n The President: I give the floor to Her Excellency \r\nMrs. Ndiyoi Mutiti, Chief Immigration Officer of \r\nZambia. \r\n Mrs. Mutiti (Zambia): Let me join previous \r\nspeakers in congratulating you, Madam, on your \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-first session. \r\n My delegation aligns itself with the statement \r\ndelivered by the representative of South Africa on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China. \r\n It is a well-known fact that no country in the \r\nworld has all the skilled human resources needed to \r\nturn the wheels of its economy in both the private and \r\npublic sectors. This has resulted in the criss-crossing of \r\nindividuals from one country to another in search of \r\ngreener pastures. Other movements have been caused \r\nby political instability. \r\n In the case of Zambia, there are a lot of Zambians \r\nwho have left the country to offer their services in \r\nother countries. The country has lost doctors, nurses, \r\nlecturers and teachers to other countries. That has \r\nresulted in disproportionate teacher-pupil, lecturer-\r\nstudent, doctor/nurse-patient ratios, thereby producing \r\na negative impact on a workforce stretched to its limits.  \r\n On the other hand, Zambia has to some extent \r\nrelied on skills from outside the country, particularly in \r\nfields such as medicine, engineering and accountancy, \r\nto mention just a few. The expatriates in Zambia are \r\nmade up of those seeking greener pastures or who are \r\npart of development assistance. It has been noted that \r\nthe challenges related to migration and development \r\nneed to be further assessed and addressed in their \r\nspecific national context. \r\n Zambia has played host to various refugees \r\nfleeing from wars, civil strife and political instability \r\nin the region. The Zambian Government has allowed \r\nsome of the refugees to work and, where possible, run \r\nbusinesses. Furthermore, the Zambian Government has \r\nentered into agreements with other countries and \r\ninternational organizations, such as the International \r\nOrganization for Migration and the Office of the \r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to \r\nfacilitate the repatriation of some refugees once it has \r\nbecome safe for them to return to their countries of \r\norigin.  \r\n The onus is on Member States to deal with \r\nmatters of migration in a developmental manner that \r\nadds value to economies of scale. However, the \r\nmeasures that should be put in place have to ensure \r\nprotection of human rights in accordance with adopted \r\ninternational human rights conventions for both \r\nmigrants and the local communities. Migrants are \r\nvulnerable to exploitative processes which include \r\nforced labour, discrimination, xenophobia and \r\ndeplorable living conditions. It is important to enhance \r\npartnerships with the International Labour \r\nOrganization, through which basic minimum standards \r\nin employment and labour are adopted by most \r\nMember States. \r\n As we live in a global economy, we must \r\nprioritize those issues of migration which will \r\ncontribute to the development of our national \r\neconomies through regional integrated processes. \r\nThese priorities should recognize the experiences of \r\nvulnerable groups such as women, youth and children \r\nwho are easily exposed to exploitative and abusive \r\nacts. \r\n In addition to the economic contribution made to \r\ndevelopment by migrant workers, there is the question \r\nA/61/PV.5  \r\n \r\n06-52450 30 \r\n \r\nof cultural and linguistic adaptation, for which \r\ninstruments need to be developed, thus increasing the \r\nsocial obligations of receiving countries. \r\n The question of remittances as a source of \r\neconomic development in sending countries should be \r\nexplored within the framework of poverty reduction \r\npolicies and direct foreign investment. However, \r\nearners should not themselves be pushed in that \r\ndirection as it is probably better for them to build up \r\ntheir wealth in the host country. Currently, remittances \r\ntransferred through informal operations or hand-carried \r\nare not necessarily captured by reporting systems. \r\nTherefore, there is need to bridge the gap between \r\nestimates and real figures. It had been thought that \r\nhouseholds receiving remittances would invest them \r\nproductively, thus creating new economic opportunities \r\nat home. However, studies show that they are being \r\nused for consumption. \r\n In addition, migrants are not isolated from \r\npandemics such as natural calamities and HIV/AIDS. \r\nNational efforts to contain such scourges should also \r\naddress the plight of migrants, particularly those in \r\nemployment. \r\n In conclusion, I wish to endorse what other \r\nspeakers have said about the need for a comprehensive \r\nand balanced approach in the implementation of \r\nmigration policies and delivery of services. All nations \r\nmust realize the potential of migration as a force for \r\ndevelopment and ensure the protection of rights of all \r\nmigrants. It is our hope that the High-level Dialogue \r\nwill pave the way for further debate on this important \r\nissue within a multilateral context. That will enable \r\nMember States, civil society and indeed other \r\nstakeholders to deliberate, exchange ideas and \r\nstrengthen international cooperation on all aspects of \r\nmigration and development. \r\n The meeting rose at 1.15 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\n"
