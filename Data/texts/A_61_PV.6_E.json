The discussions \r\nin this round table centred on five key points. \r\n First, the round table underscored the substantial \r\npositive impacts of international migration on social \r\nand economic development, while noting certain \r\nnegative impacts as well. There was general agreement \r\nthat the importance of international migration will \r\nincrease in future and that it was therefore crucial for \r\nthe international community and for Member States to \r\nfocus on maximizing its benefits while minimizing the \r\nrisks associated with it. To do so, coherent policies \r\nwere needed, both within and among countries. \r\n We noted that countries often play multiple roles, \r\nso it was therefore not useful to distinguish between \r\ncountries of origin, destination or transit. We noted \r\nalso that migrants themselves, by creating social ties \r\nand transnational networks, were a key part of the \r\nmigration process and its impact on development. \r\n Secondly, labour migration was central to the \r\ndiscussion of migration and development in terms of \r\nboth the motivation for international movements and \r\ntheir consequences for development. The discussion \r\nfocused in particular on the economic benefits, which \r\nwould increase if the labour market functioned more \r\nefficiently.  \r\nA/61/PV.6  \r\n \r\n06-52461 2 \r\n \r\n Issues such as decent work and migrants’ rights \r\nwere also underlined in this context. Certain \r\ndetrimental consequences were noted as well, \r\nparticularly those due to the loss of highly skilled \r\nworkers in many developing countries.  \r\n These effects of the brain drain were most severe \r\nin the health and education sectors, leading to a \r\ndecrease in the quality of those services. In some \r\ncountries, the emigration of skilled personnel has been \r\neroding human capital, with potentially dire \r\nconsequences for the long-term sustainability of those \r\ncountries’ development. Even though many \r\ninterventions concentrated on economic aspects, it was \r\nrecalled that social and cultural aspects are equally \r\nimportant.  \r\n Thirdly, we discussed various approaches for \r\neliminating some of the negative consequences of \r\nmigration and enhancing its positive role in \r\ndevelopment. In that context, the importance of \r\nrecurrent and circular migration was underscored, since \r\nmigrants who return — even for short periods — are \r\noften agents for development. Highly skilled returning \r\nmigrants have much to contribute to promote the \r\neconomic dynamism and development of countries of \r\norigin. \r\n Participants considered various ways in which \r\npermanent or temporary return can be promoted. Thus, \r\nGovernments were encouraged to cooperate with the \r\nprivate sector in establishing reintegration programmes \r\nand promoting, among other things, increased \r\nemployment and investment opportunities for returning \r\nmigrants.  \r\n It was acknowledged that transnational diaspora \r\ncommunities can make important contributions to the \r\ndevelopment of countries of origin. We recognized the \r\nneed to foster contacts between countries and their \r\ncitizens abroad, especially with those who are highly \r\nskilled, or who possess skills in short supply in their \r\ncountries of origin, so as to facilitate the emergence of \r\nmore active knowledge networking. The important role \r\nplayed by remittances in supporting well-being was \r\nalso cited by several participants. However, it was \r\nemphasized that not only economic remittances, but \r\nalso the transfer of knowledge and innovation, can play \r\na major role. \r\n Fourthly, several participants commented on the \r\nneed for greater collaboration between countries of \r\norigin and countries of destination to enhance the \r\nportability of pension benefits and to ensure that \r\nmigrants are not penalized for working throughout \r\ntheir productive lives in more than one country. A \r\nrelated point was the desirability of single taxation \r\narrangements. Many participants stressed that \r\nremittances should not be taxed twice. \r\n Fifthly, participants emphasized the importance \r\nof creating desirable living and working conditions in \r\ncountries of origin so that migration is truly a choice, \r\nnot a necessity. The importance of migration policies, \r\ninternational development policies and poverty \r\nreduction strategies was mentioned frequently. Key \r\nfactors in that regard include, inter alia, the promotion \r\nof good governance, the protection of human rights and \r\nthe improvement of labour market conditions in \r\nsocieties of origin. Greater emphasis on capacity-\r\nbuilding is needed. \r\n Lastly, it was noted that intergovernmental \r\ncooperation, whether at the bilateral, regional or global \r\nlevel, is important to support many of the processes \r\nthat increase the economic and social benefits of \r\ninternational migration. Governments were urged to \r\nfind ways to enhance such cooperation. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to Her \r\nExcellency Ms. Margarita Escóbar, Vice-Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of El Salvador, who will report to the \r\nAssembly on behalf of the Chairman of round table 2.  \r\n Ms. Escóbar (El Salvador): I shall read out the \r\nfollowing summary on behalf of His Excellency \r\nMr. Francisco Laínez, Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nEl Salvador.  \r\n  “I have the honour to summarize the \r\nexcellent debate that took place in round table 2, \r\nwhich focused on measures to ensure respect for \r\nand protection of the human rights of all migrants \r\nand to prevent and combat the smuggling of \r\nmigrants and the trafficking in persons. \r\n  “The discussion in our round table was \r\nlively and enriching, enjoying broad participation \r\nby Member States, United Nations entities and \r\nrepresentatives of civil society. We also benefited \r\nfrom the participation of the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights, Ms. Louise \r\nArbour. It is thus with great pleasure that I will \r\nshare with the Assembly some of the key insights \r\nthat emerged from the discussions. \r\n A/61/PV.6\r\n \r\n3 06-52461 \r\n \r\n  “There was agreement that migrants were, \r\nabove all, human beings endowed with \r\nfundamental and inalienable rights. Human rights \r\nshould be considered part of the necessary \r\nfoundation linking international migration to \r\ndevelopment, since, as participants stressed, it \r\nwas only when the human rights of migrants are \r\nrecognized and safeguarded that the positive \r\ncontributions to countries of origin and \r\ndestination could be fully realized. \r\n  “It was emphasized that all States — \r\nwhether they be points of origin, transit or \r\ndestination for migrants — had the obligation to \r\nrespect the fundamental rights and freedoms of \r\nall migrants, irrespective of their status. Of \r\nparticular relevance was the protection of the \r\nrights and freedoms of groups that are more \r\nvulnerable to exploitation, such as children, \r\nyoung people, women, indigenous people, \r\npersons with disabilities and migrants in irregular \r\nsituations.  \r\n  “The importance of social, economic and \r\ncultural rights was stressed, especially as their \r\nobservance underpinned the successful \r\nintegration of migrants into host societies. There \r\nwas agreement that it was paramount to eliminate \r\nall forms of discrimination and to combat \r\nxenophobia and racism. The Governments of \r\nreceiving countries had the responsibility to \r\noppose discriminatory, racist or xenophobic \r\nattitudes and to promote respect and tolerance.  \r\n  “Member States were urged to ratify all core \r\nhuman rights instruments, in particular the \r\nInternational Convention on the Protection of the \r\nRights of All Migrant Workers and Members of \r\nTheir Families. It was noted that that Convention \r\nreiterated many of the obligations to which States \r\nwere already bound because they were parties to \r\nthe other core human rights instruments. Member \r\nStates were also urged to become parties to all \r\nrelevant International Labour Organization and \r\nUnited Nations conventions and to ensure their \r\nfull implementation.  \r\n  “It was stressed that national legislation on \r\ninternational migration should reflect \r\ninternationally agreed human rights standards. \r\nTrafficking in persons and the smuggling of \r\nmigrants were recognized as major challenges \r\nfacing the international community today. \r\nIntergovernmental cooperation and coordination \r\nwere judged to be essential in effectively \r\ncombating those crimes. Member States were \r\nurged to cooperate more actively to prevent those \r\ncrimes and to bring perpetrators to justice.  \r\n  “It was emphasized that trafficked persons \r\nwere victims and that they were entitled to \r\nprotection and assistance. Several Member States \r\ngave examples of good practices, including media \r\ncampaigns to warn potential migrants about the \r\ndangers involved in trying to cross borders \r\nirregularly or about the ploys traffickers use to \r\nensnare victims. Another good practice was \r\ngranting permission to stay to victims of \r\ntrafficking. \r\n  “It was emphasized that the ratification and \r\nimplementation of United Nations instruments \r\nregarding trafficking in persons and the \r\nsmuggling of migrants was essential, especially \r\nas they provided a framework for international \r\ncooperation in those matters.  \r\n  “While trafficking and smuggling were \r\ncrimes, migration was not, and should not be \r\ncriminalized. Participants urged Governments to \r\nprotect the victims of trafficking in persons, in \r\nparticular by safeguarding their human rights. \r\nSome participants argued that restrictive \r\nmigration policies were at the root of increased \r\nirregular migration and that they made people \r\nmore vulnerable to falling prey to traffickers.  \r\n  “Noting the increased feminization of \r\nmigration, particularly labour migration, the need \r\nfor a gender-sensitive approach in formulating \r\ninternational migration policies was underscored. \r\nIt was stressed that, in many circumstances, \r\nfemale migrants, particularly those working in \r\npoorly regulated sectors, such as domestic \r\nservice, were more vulnerable to exploitation and \r\nabuse than male migrants. It was therefore urgent \r\nto take effective measures to protect the rights of \r\nfemale migrants, irrespective of their occupation \r\nor migration status. \r\n  “Lastly, several delegations expressed \r\nsatisfaction with the opportunity afforded by the \r\nHigh-level Dialogue to discuss the issues of \r\ninternational migration, development and human \r\nrights, and supported the Secretary-General’s \r\nA/61/PV.6  \r\n \r\n06-52461 4 \r\n \r\nproposal to establish a forum to follow up on the \r\ndiscussions that had taken place at the High-level \r\nDialogue.” \r\n The President: I now give the floor to the \r\nChairman of round table 3, His Excellency Mr. Kastriot \r\nSulka, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Labour, \r\nWelfare and Equal Opportunities of Albania. \r\n Mr. Sulka (Albania), Chairman of round table 3: \r\nI have the pleasure to present a summary of the fruitful \r\ndebate which took place in round table 3, which \r\nfocused on the multidimensional aspects of \r\ninternational migration and development, including \r\nremittances. \r\n The round table, which benefited from the active \r\nparticipation of representatives of Member States, \r\nUnited Nations entities and civil society, discussed the \r\nvarious aspects of international migration with a view \r\nto finding ways of enhancing its benefits for \r\ndevelopment. Appreciation was expressed for the \r\nsubstantive support for the round table provided by the \r\nUnder-Secretary-General for Economic and Social \r\nAffairs, Mr. José Antonio Ocampo. I will now highlight \r\nsome of the main conclusions of the round table. \r\n It was recognized that, in order for international \r\nmigration to benefit development and contribute to the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals, it \r\nwas necessary to capitalize on the skills acquired by \r\nmigrants while abroad. It was also necessary to reduce \r\nthe transfer costs of remittances and to strengthen the \r\nbenefits brought about by such transfers by, among \r\nother things, increasing the capacity for productive \r\ninvestment and improving access to financial services \r\nin countries of origin, particularly in rural areas.  \r\n The potential of remittances to reduce poverty \r\nwas underscored, and participants focused on strategies \r\nto maximize their development potential. However, \r\nsome of them warned that remittances could create \r\ndependency among recipients. The importance of \r\nfinding ways to reconcile the positive effects of \r\nremittances on poverty reduction with their possible \r\nnegative impact was underscored. Participants also \r\nstressed that remittances were private funds that \r\nprimarily benefited the families that received them and \r\nshould not be viewed as a substitute for official \r\ndevelopment assistance.  \r\n There was consensus on the need to reduce the \r\ntransaction costs of remittances, since such lower \r\ntransfer costs could significantly contribute to \r\nincreasing the funds that actually reach the families of \r\nmigrants. Participants called on countries of origin to \r\ntake a pro-active approach to enhancing the \r\ndevelopment impact of migrant contributions and \r\nsavings, particularly by collaborating with the private \r\nsector to widen access by migrants and their families to \r\nfinancial institutions, including micro-credit \r\ninstitutions. \r\n Civil society organizations, including migrant \r\nassociations, could play an important role by providing \r\nfinancial counselling to migrant families and by \r\nadvising and supporting them in the area of \r\nentrepreneurship. Access to such support was a means \r\nof leveraging the benefits of remittances for \r\ndevelopment. Coordinating measures to support or \r\npromote entrepreneurship in countries of origin were \r\nthought to be useful. \r\n The involvement of transnational communities in \r\nfostering the development of countries of origin was \r\nthought both desirable and essential to maximize the \r\nbenefits of international migration. Participants \r\nacknowledged the positive contribution of \r\ntransnational communities and networks to the \r\ndevelopment of communities of both destination and \r\norigin. It was recognized that the establishment of \r\nknowledge-sharing networks involving members of \r\nmigrant communities could benefit countries of origin. \r\n A number of participants called for further \r\ninitiatives to explore policy solutions that would \r\nfacilitate the reintegration of migrants upon return to \r\ntheir countries of origin. The issue of ensuring the \r\nportability of pensions and access to social services \r\nwas also raised. Many participants felt that the \r\nreturning migrant could be an agent of development, \r\nprovided that policies in the countries of origin \r\nfacilitated the transfer of funds, access to loans and the \r\nsetting up of small businesses. \r\n The President: The summary of the discussions \r\nin round table 4 will be presented at a later stage.  \r\n Before giving the floor to the first speaker in the \r\ndebate for this afternoon, I would like to inform \r\nmembers that there are still 59 speakers remaining to \r\nbe heard. As I mentioned yesterday, we have to \r\nconclude the High-level Dialogue at the end of this \r\nmeeting. I therefore appeal again to members to make \r\ntheir statements as concise as possible by summarizing \r\nthem and circulating the full text.  \r\n A/61/PV.6\r\n \r\n5 06-52461 \r\n \r\n I now give the floor to His Excellency, \r\nMr. Hassan Muhammad Lawal, Minister for Labour \r\nand Productivity of Nigeria. \r\n Mr. Lawal (Nigeria): We would like to \r\ncongratulate you, Madam, on your election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \r\nsession and to assure you of our readiness to cooperate \r\nwith you to make your tenure a success. We would also \r\nlike to thank the Secretary-General and his staff for the \r\nelaborate report (A/60/871) prepared for our \r\ndeliberations. Nigeria aligns itself with the statement \r\nmade by the representative of South Africa on behalf of \r\nthe Group of 77 and China. \r\n International migration is an age-old phenomenon \r\nwhich, over the ages, has seen people of all colours and \r\ncreeds move around the world for various reasons. \r\nWithout a doubt, migration has enormous benefits and \r\ncan be a potent force for development. But its \r\nchallenges are equally enormous. Against this \r\nbackground, Nigeria is convinced that better-managed \r\nmigration can bring win-win benefits to all countries. \r\n The asymmetries in the material wealth of \r\ncountries and the demand for cheap labour in \r\nindustrialized countries, coupled with unemployment \r\nand poverty, are some of the factors that propel \r\ninternational migration.  \r\n While each country has the right to determine its \r\nmigration policies, the exploitation, maltreatment, \r\nforceful repatriation and other dehumanizing treatment \r\nof migrants who are asylum-seekers — including their \r\nplacement in concentration-style camps — prevalent in \r\nsome countries as measures to manage migration are \r\nindefensible in the twenty-first century. The \r\ninternational community must therefore resist the \r\ntemptation to build thick walls of exclusion or resort to \r\nxenophobia or other forms of discrimination under the \r\npretext of measures to ensure national security. \r\n Rather, we should work collectively to find \r\npracticable and dignifying solutions to the problems \r\nassociated with migration. Nigeria is particularly \r\nconcerned about the degrading treatment of migrants, \r\nin particular those who belong to vulnerable groups, \r\nand calls on States to fulfil their labour and human \r\nrights obligations to migrants, for that is the essence of \r\ndevelopment, as all people aspire to better standards of \r\nlife in greater freedom. \r\n In Nigeria’s view, specific policy measures to \r\nconsider in this Dialogue should include capacity-\r\nbuilding, especially in African countries; the \r\nmobilization of national populations in the diaspora; \r\nthe cheaper, safer and faster transfer of remittances; the \r\nsharing of more information on remittances; and the \r\nintegration of migration issues into national \r\ndevelopment strategies. Other measures that need to be \r\nput in place to support the achievement of national \r\ndevelopment strategies include the speedy conclusion \r\nof the Doha Development Agenda, the resolution of the \r\nexternal debt crisis, the provision of new and \r\nadditional resources, global cooperation to fight \r\ncorruption and terrorism and a greater voice and \r\nparticipation for developing countries in decision-\r\nmaking in international financial and trading \r\ninstitutions.  \r\n In Nigeria, we have adopted a National Economic \r\nEmpowerment and Development Strategy as a \r\nframework to eradicate poverty, promote wealth \r\ncreation and guarantee lasting prosperity for all \r\nNigerians. Furthermore, Nigeria is working vigorously \r\nto achieve the goals and targets set out in the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development.  \r\n Cognizant of the importance of migration, the \r\nGovernment has established institutions to deal with \r\nthe phenomenon, while three Special Assistants have \r\nbeen appointed to advise the President on diaspora \r\nmatters, human trafficking and child labour, as well as \r\non migration and humanitarian affairs. \r\n Nigeria supports the proposal of the Secretary- \r\nGeneral to establish a consultative forum to \r\ncomplement coherent and well-coordinated migration \r\nstrategies at all levels. We believe that the forum would \r\nprovide a venue for States and other relevant \r\nstakeholders to continue the dialogue on migration in \r\nthe absence of institutional arrangements within the \r\nUnited Nations system. Nigeria looks forward to the \r\nfirst meeting of the forum. Nigeria appreciates and \r\ncommends the role of the International Labour \r\nOrganization in providing an international standard for \r\nthe protection of migrants. We also commend the \r\nInternational Organization for Migration for having \r\nraised awareness of the positive role that international \r\nmigration and migrants can play in the economic, \r\nsocial and cultural development of countries.  \r\nA/61/PV.6  \r\n \r\n06-52461 6 \r\n \r\n Finally, we call for more international \r\ncooperation on migration management. \r\n The President: I give the floor to His Excellency \r\nMr. Walter Fust, Director-General of the Swiss \r\nDevelopment Corporation of Switzerland. \r\n Mr. Fust (Switzerland) (spoke in French): \r\nMigration is something that has always existed; it will \r\ncontinue to bring States together as we endeavour to \r\nmanage it and to prevent illegal or undesirable forms of \r\nthe phenomenon. We believe, therefore, that our efforts \r\nshould result in the creation of a true partnership \r\namong States, international organizations and civil \r\nsociety, so that we are able to manage migration in a \r\nmanner that is equitable, fair and transparent, in a spirit \r\nof mutual responsibility. In that context, we must first \r\nand foremost analyse the true causes of migration, inter \r\nalia, poverty, lack of prospects for the future, poor \r\ngovernance, insecurity, the violation of human rights \r\nand armed conflict. \r\n We urgently need to develop instruments to \r\nenable us to maximize the positive effects of migration \r\nwhile minimizing the negative effects. Such \r\nconsiderations inspired Switzerland to launch the \r\nBerne Initiative, a process aimed at the development of \r\nan international agenda for migration management. As \r\na process, the Berne Initiative enables Governments \r\nfrom all regions to share their various policy priorities, \r\nas well as to set out their long-term interests in the \r\ndomain of migration, with a view to arriving at a \r\ncommon approach based on cooperation, \r\ncomprehensiveness, balance and predictability. \r\n The report of the Global Commission on \r\nInternational Migration, published in October 2005, \r\nclearly set out the ideal situation: migration should be a \r\nmatter of choice, not of necessity. Indeed, there are far \r\ntoo many men and women who leave their homes and \r\nfamilies as a result of circumstances that they cannot \r\ncontrol.  \r\n We have a duty to pay more attention to the \r\ncauses of migration and to prevention. In order to do \r\nso, we must together focus on instruments geared \r\ntowards improving living conditions in countries of \r\norigin. Switzerland is committed to that goal and \r\nintends, at the international level, to pursue its \r\ncommitment to fostering human security, promoting \r\npeace and enhancing respect for international law and \r\nhuman rights. \r\n Similarly, Switzerland’s cooperation is \r\nstrategically oriented towards obtaining results that \r\ncontribute to the stabilization of political, economic \r\nand social situations in countries of origin. \r\n Development cooperation projects must do more \r\nto create a sufficient number of stable employment \r\nopportunities in developing countries, while \r\nemphasizing the great importance of savings and credit \r\nschemes. In addition, experience has taught us that the \r\nentrepreneurial capacity of women has been vastly \r\nunderestimated. It is evident that we are dealing here \r\nwith something that has enormous potential for \r\npromoting local economies in a sustainable manner. \r\n Another approach to be further explored is the \r\npossibility of exploiting the synergies between \r\nmigration and development. The remittances that \r\nmigrants send back to their countries of origin amount \r\nto close to $200 billion per year, including transfers \r\nbetween industrialized countries. Notwithstanding the \r\nfact that these are, indeed, private funds, we can and \r\nshould seek out the potential synergies between these \r\nmajor financial flows and official development \r\ncooperation. These remittances, however, are no \r\nsubstitute for official development assistance.  \r\n Our task is to improve the effectiveness of such \r\ntransfers by lowering their cost and by ensuring that \r\ntransfer procedures are secure, legal and exempt from \r\nadditional taxes, while endeavouring to enhance these \r\nfunds’ impact on development. In this regard, \r\nSwitzerland applauds the efforts made by multilateral \r\nbanks, bilateral agencies and other organizations \r\noperating in this area and encourages all partners to \r\nshare their experiences. We encourage States, \r\ninternational organizations and international financial \r\ninstitutions to integrate the issue of migration into their \r\nnational poverty-reduction strategies and their regional \r\npolicies.  \r\n We believe also that macroeconomic policies, \r\nwhen established, should facilitate international and \r\nnational investment, including by diasporas, so that our \r\nactions unfold in a spirit of genuine partnership. \r\n Switzerland believes that the social integration of \r\nmigrants takes place primarily by way of participation \r\nin the labour market and through education. For that \r\nreason, Switzerland advocates policies aimed at \r\nimproving the status of migrant workers, their active \r\nintegration into the workforce, vocational training for \r\nyoung people, a reduction in unemployment and the \r\n A/61/PV.6\r\n \r\n7 06-52461 \r\n \r\ntaking of effective measures against illegal or \r\nclandestine employment. \r\n We should spare no effort in combating the most \r\ninhuman form of forced migration, namely trafficking \r\nin human beings. It is our duty, therefore, to provide \r\nthe victims — children, women and men — with \r\nenhanced support in terms of protection and assistance. \r\nNeither should it be forgotten that the insecurity and \r\nlack of protection to which migrants are exposed tends \r\nto put in danger particularly the elderly, the sick and \r\nthe handicapped. Women and children, too, are also \r\namong the most vulnerable. Sadly, however, all this \r\nrepresents only the tip of the iceberg. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I give the floor \r\nto His Excellency Mr. Richard Fadden, Deputy \r\nMinister, Citizenship and Immigration of Canada. \r\n Mr. Fadden (Canada): The decision to hold the \r\nHigh-level Dialogue is a reflection of the broader \r\nperspective that States and experts are increasingly \r\nadopting in their consideration of issues related to \r\nimmigration. \r\n It has been 12 years since the International \r\nConference on Population and Development (ICPD). \r\nCanada continues to believe that chapter 10 of the \r\nICPD Programme of Action provides an important \r\nguide for global cooperation on issues related to \r\nmigration. Over the past few years, we have witnessed \r\na growing sophistication in the way migration is \r\ntreated. Linkages between migration and other areas of \r\npublic policy are being explored in greater depth, an \r\napproach that Canada finds valuable.  \r\n While it has become commonplace to talk of the \r\nimpact that globalization is having on all parts of the \r\nworld, it would be a mistake to suggest that \r\nglobalization affects all parts of the world in the same \r\nway, or that each country’s response to globalization \r\nneeds to be — or even can be — the same. Although \r\nthere is much to be learned from sharing approaches \r\nand experiences concerning migration, solutions need \r\nto be tailored to local conditions to be effective. In that \r\nregard, the notion of sharing “best practices” requires \r\nrefinement. Not everything can be systematized into a \r\nglobal approach. \r\n The High-level Dialogue brings together many \r\nvoices from the worlds of migration and development: \r\npolicymakers from developed and developing \r\ncountries; international organizations; civil society; \r\nand the United Nations system. Each has something \r\nvaluable to add to the discussion, and, as we move \r\nforward, we need to ensure that each of these voices is \r\ngiven the opportunity to develop and to contribute. \r\n To anchor the discussion within the realities of \r\npolicymaking, however, Canada believes that this \r\nprocess should begin as a dialogue between States. As \r\nit evolves, the dialogue — while remaining under the \r\nleadership of States — should facilitate links with \r\ninterested stakeholders. \r\n As the Secretary-General’s Special \r\nRepresentative has said on a number of occasions, for \r\nprogress to be made on this issue, the various \r\nstakeholders need to approach these discussions in a \r\nconstructive and open way. \r\n Governments cannot and should not work in \r\nisolation. Yet at the same time, it is important that \r\nStates take the opportunity to reflect upon and refine \r\ntheir own perspectives in order to engage \r\nconstructively with others. Canada supports \r\nconsideration of appropriate mechanisms for civil \r\nsociety and the newly created Global Migration Group \r\nto provide input into any ongoing discussions that \r\nStates may decide to undertake. \r\n In considering any ongoing process that might \r\nemerge from the High-level Dialogue, Canada would \r\nencourage States to take the following into account. \r\n An ongoing process should add value to \r\ninternational discussions rather than duplicate what is \r\nalready taking place or what could occur within \r\nexisting mechanisms. This new dialogue should take \r\nplace as a standalone forum and not as part of the \r\nUnited Nations system and its related institutions. \r\nClearly defined links to the United Nations, possibly \r\nthrough the Office of the Special Representative of the \r\nSecretary-General, should be developed. The process \r\nshould focus on developing an understanding of \r\nsubstantive issues rather than on negotiating texts for \r\nresolutions or declarations. Finally, States should take \r\nthe leadership role, as they are responsible for turning \r\nideas into concrete policy. \r\n The President: I give the floor to Her Excellency \r\nMs. Ellen Sauerbrey, Assistant Secretary for \r\nPopulation, Refugee and Migration Affairs of the \r\nUnited States. \r\n Ms. Sauerbrey (United States of America): The \r\nUnited States is pleased to participate in this event, \r\nA/61/PV.6  \r\n \r\n06-52461 8 \r\n \r\nwhich provides the opportunity for States Members of \r\nthe United Nations to discuss our collective \r\nexperiences on migration and development. \r\n The issue of immigration is very close to \r\nAmerica’s heart. It goes to the very core of who we are \r\nas a people and what we believe in as a country: hard \r\nwork, opportunity, rule of law, freedom, tolerance and \r\nliberty. Let there be no confusion: the United States’ \r\ncommitment to promoting orderly migration as a \r\npositive development for all nations is firm and \r\nundiminished by the challenges of the post-9/11 world. \r\n Last year alone, over 1 million foreign nationals \r\nreceived permanent legal residence in the United \r\nStates. America hosts approximately 20 per cent of the \r\nworld’s migrants, coming to us from every corner of \r\nthe globe. Last year we resettled over half of the \r\nworld’s refugees — perhaps the most vulnerable \r\nmigrants.  \r\n All countries of the United Nations family have \r\nshared with us their people, their culture and their \r\nfaiths, representing the magnificent glory and range \r\nand reach of God’s human creation. So when America \r\nlooks in the mirror, it is them that we see. \r\n The United States takes the issue of migration \r\nvery seriously. We are deeply and sincerely committed \r\nto promoting legal, orderly and humane migration as \r\nan engine for economic growth and prosperity for all \r\ncountries. We are also, without hesitation, fully \r\ncommitted to respect for the human dignity and human \r\nrights of migrants. On these points, there should be no \r\ndoubt. \r\n My country approaches the subject of migration \r\nwith humility. Through more than 200 years of \r\nexperience, we have learned that the political, \r\neconomic and human complexities of this phenomenon \r\ndefy easy answers. Even in the eighteenth century, our \r\nfounding fathers debated the appropriate scope of \r\nimmigration to the United States. They mistakenly \r\nfeared that foreign influences would somehow \r\nundermine America’s democratic principles. \r\n The United States recognizes that there are \r\nnegative aspects of migration, such as human \r\ntrafficking and smuggling, and we are committed to \r\nconfronting those challenges. Our national \r\nconversation on migration continues today. Americans \r\nunderstand the need to work through these hard issues \r\nas a nation. We offer ourselves as an example, and \r\nperhaps a reassurance, to others who are struggling \r\nwith immigration as a relatively new topic. \r\n Americans are a practical people when it comes \r\nto immigration. This national preference for the \r\npragmatic and the concrete, coupled with an \r\nunwavering commitment to migration as a positive \r\nphenomenon, shapes how the United States fosters \r\ninternational cooperation in this realm. In our \r\nexperience, migration relationships work best between \r\nneighbours and neighbourhoods, near and far, where \r\nthere are common interests and concerns that lead to \r\ntangible outcomes. We are not interested in grand and \r\nponderous global dialogues simply because we have \r\nseen the inherent weakness that results from their size \r\nand scope. They lumber under the great weight of \r\nrounds and rounds of conversation, far removed from \r\nimmediate problems and realistic solutions. \r\n The United States welcomes the work of the \r\nGlobal Migration Group, which will enhance the \r\nability of the United Nations system and the \r\nInternational Organization for Migration to address the \r\nnexus between migration and development. We \r\nbelieve, however, that the international community, \r\nincluding the United Nations system, already has \r\nadequate capacity to address migration issues and that \r\nthe creation of additional structures could hinder, not \r\nhelp, international goodwill and cooperation on these \r\nissues. Any consideration of United Nations-affiliated \r\ndiscussions must be fully vetted by the Member States \r\nin a transparent and open manner in keeping with the \r\nUnited Nations rules of procedure and out of respect \r\nfor the traditions of this institution. \r\n We continue to believe, as did our forefathers, \r\nthat what binds Americans together is a shared belief in \r\nprinciples guaranteed under our Constitution. The \r\nUnited States expects immigrants to respect the \r\nfundamental rights and responsibilities that accompany \r\nresidence and citizenship. We work as a society to \r\nbuild immigrants’ appreciation for United States \r\ninstitutions, recognizing their personal connection to \r\nour shared American history as an immigrant nation. \r\n Americans support the principle that immigrants, \r\nwhile fully integrating into their new communities, can \r\nalso remain connected to their country of origin. One \r\nof the strongest links is remittances. These financial \r\nflows are a manifestation of migration’s pains as well \r\nas its benefits. They represent enormous toil, sacrifice \r\nand the sorrow of separation from family and \r\n A/61/PV.6\r\n \r\n9 06-52461 \r\n \r\ncommunity. Yet they also symbolize the profound love \r\nof those people and places left behind and the courage \r\nto follow one’s dreams. \r\n Both migrant sending and receiving countries \r\nhave responsibility to maximize migration’s benefits, \r\nincluding remittances. Remittances are private \r\ntransfers of funds, which will have a greater overall \r\nimpact on development in countries of origin when \r\nthose countries undertake economic and social reforms \r\nthat create an environment conducive to asset building, \r\nentrepreneurship and investment. \r\n Immigrants come to the United States, as \r\nPresident Bush has said, not only to take, but to give. \r\nThey come for a chance to work hard, to support their \r\nfamilies and to rise in the world. While migration can \r\nbe beneficial to sending and receiving countries as well \r\nas to migrants themselves, it is important to note that \r\nthe decision to migrate should be made out of choice, \r\nnot necessity. Countries of origin and destination must \r\nwork together to make this a reality. \r\n The President: I give the floor to Mr. Kastriot \r\nSulka, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Labour, \r\nSocial Affairs and Equal Opportunities of the Republic \r\nof Albania. \r\n Mr. Sulka (Albania): Albania welcomes the \r\norganization of the High-level Dialogue on \r\nInternational Migration and Development and believes \r\nthat it will have a strong impact on future efforts and \r\npolicies for the management of migration \r\ninternationally. According to the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport (A/60/871), more than 191 million persons are \r\ninternational migrants — a fact that shows the huge \r\ndimensions of the phenomenon and its influence on \r\ninternational balances. As such, it cannot be considered \r\nto be a phenomenon of developed or developing \r\ncountries alone. \r\n The global policy on migration management for \r\nthe benefit of both States and individuals is largely \r\nreflected in Albania. Since 1991, Albania has \r\nexperienced significant flows of migration at a rate of \r\nup to 20 per cent of the total population. Albanian \r\nmigrants are found mostly in the European Union, \r\nespecially in the two neighbouring countries, Greece \r\nand Italy, but also in Germany, the United States of \r\nAmerica, Canada and Australia. Until 2004, Albania \r\nwas one of the main transit routes in South-East \r\nEurope towards the European Union. As a result, \r\nmigration was a major concern not only for the country \r\nitself but also for its relations with the European Union \r\nand in particular with its neighbours. \r\n I would like to share with you a new approach \r\nthat the Government of Albania has proclaimed \r\nrecently: “Albania: 1 Euro”, aimed at attracting \r\ninvestors in poor areas with high unemployment rates. \r\nThe initiative is addressed in particular at the diaspora \r\nand emigrants, as the need for their contribution is \r\nhigh, taking in consideration that they bring with them \r\nnot only financial capital but also human capital. In \r\nthis way, they share with the community a new \r\nmentality, culture and technological advancements. As \r\nnoted in paragraph 16 of the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport,  \r\n “After working in Greece, Albanians bring home \r\nnew agricultural skills that enable them to \r\nincrease production. By promoting the exchange \r\nof experience and helping build partnerships, the \r\ninternational community can do much to increase \r\nand to spread these positive effects of migration \r\non development.” \r\n While migration creates possibilities for migrants \r\nto have a better life and contributes to the countries of \r\nboth origin and destination, it has a negative impact as \r\na result of the emigration of highly skilled workers and \r\nthe phenomenon of brain drain. \r\n Albania is trying to reverse the trend: from brain \r\ndrain to brain gain, by introducing strategies for \r\nattracting highly skilled workers and excellent students \r\nwho have studied abroad to contribute effectively to \r\nAlbania. The Albanian Government supports and \r\nwelcomes cooperation with civil society and student \r\norganizations that provide financial incentives for the \r\nhighly skilled and students to return. \r\n The United Nations Development Programme is \r\nsupporting an initiative of the Albanian Government \r\nthrough the Brain Gain programme, which seeks to \r\nmaximize the role of migrants and the diaspora in \r\nacademia, public administration and business. This \r\nprogramme supports the Albanian Government’s \r\nefforts to create the conditions and incentive structure \r\nrequired for the engagement of the diaspora in \r\nAlbania’s development. \r\n Albania has seen that without the support and \r\nexpertise of specialized international agencies in the \r\nfield, in particular the International Organization for \r\nMigration, the United Nations, the World Bank, \r\nA/61/PV.6  \r\n \r\n06-52461 10 \r\n \r\nUNICEF, the Office of the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Refugees and the European Union, \r\nand without cooperation among countries, it is difficult \r\nto deal coherently with migration. Experience shows us \r\nthat without close cooperation between countries of \r\ndestination and those of origin it is impossible to fight \r\nillegal migration and manage migration for the benefit \r\nof all. Albania agrees that in framing policies or \r\nestablishing structures, the perspective of emigrants \r\nand civil society should be taken into consideration, \r\nand not only that of the countries of origin and \r\ndestination. We believe that the results of this debate \r\nwill be followed by concrete actions, resulting in better \r\nmanagement of migration internationally. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Hassan Ibrahim Al-Muhannadi, \r\nDirector for Social Planning Management of the \r\nPlanning Council of Qatar. \r\n Mr. Al-Muhannadi (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): It \r\ngives me great pleasure on behalf of the State of Qatar \r\nto congratulate you, Madam President, on your election \r\nas President of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \r\nsession. I am confident that your wisdom and \r\nexperience will guide the work of the Assembly \r\ntowards success. I would like also to thank the \r\nSecretary-General for his tireless efforts to shed light \r\non the question of global migration and development, \r\nand for his exhaustive report (A/60/871). \r\n The phenomenon of migration goes far back in \r\ntime. Its pace has, however, increased in our era \r\nbecause of globalization and its socio-economic \r\nimpacts and the significant progress in communications \r\nand transportation. The current status of migration \r\nrequires serious attention if we are to harness it to \r\nfurther the interests of individuals and nations. \r\nOrganizing this global Dialogue is merely a step \r\ntowards finding effective means to ensure the \r\nprotection of migrants, as well as of countries of origin \r\nand destination. The State of Qatar welcomes the \r\nSecretary-General’s proposal to establish a global \r\nconsultative forum on migration, and we appreciate \r\nBelgium’s offer to host its first meeting.  \r\n The State of Qatar hosts many migrant workers \r\nfrom many nations. They work side by side with \r\ncitizens of Qatar, promoting the development of our \r\nnation’s economy, which is now one of the world’s \r\nfastest growing. The State of Qatar has always been \r\nproud of the contributions made by migrant labour to \r\nits robust economic growth and its tireless efforts to \r\nachieve sustainable development. \r\n Moreover, the State of Qatar is engaging in close \r\nand continuous cooperation with countries of origin. \r\nFor example, it has concluded bilateral agreements \r\nregulating the employment of migrants and identifying \r\nthe role of public authorities in countries of origin and \r\ndestination. These agreements require that such \r\nworkers be employed under labour contracts that \r\nclearly spell out the rights and obligations of both \r\nemployees and employers. The contracts are certified \r\nby officials of both countries to prevent any abuse of \r\nmigrant workers; they also define procedures for \r\nsettling disputes between employees and employers, \r\nenable migrant workers to fully exercise their right to \r\nsend remittances to their countries of origin and set out \r\nrules for paid vacations and other leave. \r\n Our Government has created a tolerant social \r\nenvironment that enables migrant workers to freely \r\npractice their religion and maintain their own culture. \r\nThe State of Qatar also provides migrant workers with \r\nbasic rights and benefits, including education, health \r\ncare and social protection. \r\n Another example of Qatar’s interest in its migrant \r\nworkers is its invitation to all members of the Arab \r\nGulf Cooperation Council to participate in the forum \r\non migrant workers to be held in Doha in April 2007. \r\nThe State of Qatar pays particular attention to \r\nprotecting the rights of migrant workers in accordance \r\nwith its laws and the contracts that are concluded with \r\nthem and certified by the countries of origin. In that \r\nregard, I wish to reiterate that the State of Qatar \r\nhonours its commitments under the contracts \r\nconcluded with it and strictly abides by the relevant \r\ninternational agreements and treaties.  \r\n In conclusion, I should like to express the hope \r\nthat this Dialogue will be fully successful in promoting \r\nprogress and well-being in our nations. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Yannis Valinakis, Vice-Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Greece. \r\n Mr. Valinakis (Greece): On behalf of the Greek \r\nGovernment, I would like to stress the importance of \r\nthe organization by the United Nations of the High-\r\nlevel Dialogue on International Migration and \r\nDevelopment.  \r\n A/61/PV.6\r\n \r\n11 06-52461 \r\n \r\n It was in May 2003, during the Greek presidency \r\nof the European Union (EU), that the European \r\nCouncil adopted, for the first time, Conclusions on \r\nmigration and development, containing a series of \r\nconcrete measures and items for further elaboration by \r\ncommunity organizations and member States. Since \r\nthen, much has been done in the framework of EU \r\naction related to the interrelationship between \r\nmigration and development, and migration has rightly \r\nbeen placed on our development agenda. \r\n The links between migration and development are \r\ncomplex and need further study. It appears that \r\nmigration, when managed effectively, can have a \r\nsubstantial positive impact for both countries of \r\ndestination and countries of origin.  \r\n The European Council, in its Conclusions of \r\n15-16 December 2005, underlined the need for a \r\nbalanced, global and coherent approach to cooperation \r\nwith third countries, utilizing the benefits of legal \r\nmigration and covering policies to combat illegal \r\nimmigration. It recalled that migration issues are a \r\ncentral element in the relations of the Union and its \r\nmember States with third countries.  \r\n The EU commitment to support the development \r\nefforts of countries of origin and transit is also part of a \r\nlong-term process aimed at responding to the \r\nopportunities and challenges of migration. In that \r\nregard, the European Council recognized the \r\nimportance of addressing the root causes of \r\nmigration — for example, through the eradication of \r\npoverty in countries and regions of origin, good \r\ngovernance and the protection of human rights. We \r\nfully subscribe to those basic policy principles. \r\n In the same vein, we consider the Rabat EU-\r\nAfrica Ministerial Conference, held in July 2006, to be \r\na fine paradigm for our relations with a basic group of \r\ncountries of origin and transit. We believe that it will \r\nassist significantly in improving ways to communicate \r\nand cooperate with African partners. \r\n Nevertheless, there is an urgent need to address \r\nthe phenomenon of illegal migration jointly, \r\nappropriately and effectively. The fight against illegal \r\nmigration is an incessant struggle that is taking place \r\nfrom West Africa and the Canary Islands, across the \r\nMediterranean to the Aegean Sea and the Middle East. \r\nIllegal migration has recently taken on huge and \r\nuncontrollable proportions. Given the fact that \r\nGreece’s coastline extends more than 16,000 \r\nkilometres, combating all forms of illegal migration is \r\na declared high priority of the Greek Government. \r\n In conclusion, I should like to reiterate our view \r\nthat the High-level Dialogue should be the beginning \r\nof a new global approach to migration in its various \r\nforms. It should thus focus on initiating broad and \r\nthorough discussion on the relevant issues and on \r\nlessons learned about the multidimensional aspects of \r\ninternational migration and development in order to \r\nidentify appropriate ways and means to maximize the \r\ndevelopment benefits of migration and to minimize its \r\nnegative impacts.  \r\n The President: I now give the floor to \r\nHer Excellency Mrs. Mari Pedak, Director-General of \r\nthe Citizenship and Migration Board of Estonia.  \r\n Mrs. Pedak (Estonia): The general position of \r\nthe European Union (EU) was outlined in the statement \r\nof its presidency. Therefore, as the representative of a \r\nmember of the EU, I will not repeat what has already \r\nbeen said, but rather focus on a number of main aspects \r\nthat are of great importance to Estonia. \r\n Nobel Prize winner Amartya Sen defined \r\ndevelopment as the process of expanding the real \r\nfreedoms that people enjoy. That includes both social \r\nand economic arrangements and political and civil \r\nrights. Although migration is an increasingly complex \r\nphenomenon in our globalizing world, its primary \r\ncause remains the disparities that exist with regard to \r\nthe freedoms enjoyed by individuals. Therefore, I \r\nwould like to stress the need to address the root causes \r\nof migration. They encompass conflict, poverty, \r\nfamine, disease, lack of employment opportunities, \r\ntrade barriers, lack of rule of law and poor governance. \r\nMost of those causes are primarily of man-made origin. \r\n These are significant barriers to freedom that \r\nneed to be abolished in order to eliminate conditions \r\nthat compel people to leave their country. It goes \r\nwithout saying, that we, as States, are primarily \r\nresponsible for creating an environment conducive to \r\ndevelopment. Naturally, one element of that \r\nenvironment would be the efficient and purposeful \r\nutilization of the remittances of migrants for further \r\ndevelopment, such as for education, investment and \r\nmicrocredit. That would benefit both sending and \r\nreceiving societies. Those are some of the reasons that \r\nissues related to international migration must become \r\nan integral part of the development agenda. Likewise, \r\nA/61/PV.6  \r\n \r\n06-52461 12 \r\n \r\ndevelopment issues should be recognized as important \r\nelements of migration policy. \r\n The Secretary-General has stressed the \r\nimportance of respecting the rights of migrants in order \r\nto realize fully the benefits of international migration. \r\nHe also has stressed the obligation to observe the laws \r\nand regulations of the host State. It is almost a truism \r\nthat education plays a key role in personal \r\ndevelopment and significantly expands individuals’ \r\nopportunities and their capacity to live a happy life.  \r\n Former Estonian President Lennart Meri has said \r\nthat a lack of language skills creates lawlessness. Only \r\nby understanding the language will we understand the \r\nlaws and thus, effectively, our rights and obligations. \r\nLearning the local language and respecting the local \r\nculture opens a window of opportunity to an immigrant \r\nto effectively operate in the host society as a subject \r\nand not as an object. It also allows him or her to \r\nincrease his or her competitiveness in the labour \r\nmarket, as well as to obtain new skills and other assets \r\nfor development. To effectively support this process, \r\nwe need to continue local introductory and integration \r\nprogrammes, also bearing in mind that integration is a \r\ntwo-way street and that citizens of receiving nations \r\nmust also be educated. \r\n Last but not least, for successful integration we \r\nall — both sending and receiving States — must avoid \r\nusing migrants for domestic ideological purposes. We \r\nmust not make these people instruments of our \r\ndomestic policy. \r\n We truly hope that this Dialogue on International \r\nMigration and Development will continue to play a \r\nsignificant global role in this respect. \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Carlos Zamora Rodríguez, Director of Consular \r\nAffairs and Cubans Living Abroad of Cuba. \r\n Mr. Zamora Rodríguez (Cuba) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): Allow me, Madam, to congratulate you on \r\nyour election as President of the General Assembly and \r\nto express my delegation’s will and commitment to \r\ncontinue working constructively with you. My \r\ndelegation wishes to associate itself with the statement \r\nmade by the representative of South Africa on behalf of \r\nthe Group of 77 and China. At the same time we would \r\nlike to express some thoughts on this topic.  \r\n The current phenomenon of international \r\nmigration is a consequence of the present world order \r\nimposed by the developed world. The increasing \r\ndifferences between the rich countries and the huge \r\nunderdeveloped and poor areas of the planet are a \r\nconsequence of neo-liberal globalization. Millions of \r\nhuman beings see no alternative for their future other \r\nthan to migrate towards the developed economies of \r\nthe first world. Changing this landscape is a challenge \r\nthat we all must address, for its consequences affect \r\nboth rich and poor countries. It is a matter of urgency \r\nto address the current phenomenon of migration, and it \r\nis appropriate to include the issue in development \r\npolicies. \r\n Maintaining the status quo will only serve to \r\nincrease the pressure of masses of migrants coming \r\nfrom impoverished areas of the planet besieging the \r\nborders of the developed world. This flood cannot be \r\nstopped by criminalizing migration, erecting massive \r\nwalls at the borders or creating administrative or even \r\nmilitary barriers. \r\n We cannot accept approaches aimed at managing \r\nand administering migration flows to meet the needs of \r\nthe developed world. It is essential to change the \r\ncurrent situation of underdevelopment and poverty in a \r\nlarge part of the planet so that migration meets the true \r\nneeds and aspirations of individuals who wish to settle \r\nin another country. Development is the only way to \r\nbalance migration flows in the world of the future. \r\n The planet’s natural resources are being exploited \r\nfor the benefit of the developed countries. In today’s \r\nglobalized economy, the exploitation of human \r\nresources is ever increasing. An unjust international \r\nmigration order has been created to serve the richest \r\nand most powerful countries, which receive skilled \r\nlabour, steal the best brains and talent, and in return \r\nwant our countries to become their border guards, to \r\nstop irregular migration. \r\n For example, in Latin America every year we \r\ntrain 1.2 million university graduates, at a cost of at \r\nleast $20,000 each. Of these, 240,000 — that is, 20 per \r\ncent — are stolen away to work and do research in the \r\nrich nations, which offer them conditions that our \r\nimpoverished nations, cannot guarantee them, and we \r\nreceive no compensation whatsoever. They sell us \r\nremittances as a panacea for development —\r\nremittances that are the fruit of the migrants’ \r\nsacrifices — while constantly reducing their \r\ncommitments and their official development assistance. \r\n A/61/PV.6\r\n \r\n13 06-52461 \r\n \r\n It is time to rectify this. Sincere cooperation is \r\nrequired to contribute to the development of the vast \r\npoor areas of the planet. Without steadfast political \r\nwill, it will not be possible to solve the problem. \r\nHowever, today’s facts call into question the existence \r\nof that political will on the part of the industrialized \r\nworld. \r\n The policy of blockade and aggression against \r\nmy country is one example of the aforementioned \r\nproblem. The so-called Cuban Adjustment Act allows \r\nany Cuban who arrives on United States territory to \r\ntake up residence, no matter the means and procedures \r\nused. This act has encouraged illegal migration and \r\nalien smuggling. It contradicts the bilateral migration \r\nagreement, which establishes the obligation to ensure \r\nlegal, safe and orderly migration. Moreover, the United \r\nStates authorities show no inclination to investigate \r\nand punish organized crime that benefits from alien \r\nsmuggling. \r\n Moreover, Cubans resident in the United States \r\nare the only group of migrants that is restricted in \r\nterms of visiting and helping their relatives in their \r\ncountry of origin, as a result of the regulations issued \r\nby the host country. This situation has become crueller \r\nsince the United States Government’s May 2004 \r\nadoption of measures further restricting travel and \r\nremittances on the basis of an absurd and offensive \r\nlimitation of the concept of family. Today, a son can \r\nvisit his mother only once every three years, even if \r\nshe is dying. \r\n Increasing and unsustainable military \r\nexpenditures constitute another example of the lack of \r\nwill regarding development cooperation. What can \r\njustify the vast and growing amounts spent on the \r\ndevelopment of increasingly deadly and sophisticated \r\nweapons, which are shown by the current wars to be \r\naimed precisely at the poor countries and to cause \r\nsignificant displacements of people? The reduction of \r\nmilitary spending and its investment in development \r\nwould be a demonstration of the genuine will to \r\naddress the issue of development, and to help change \r\nthe current situation. \r\n The developed world has received a substantial \r\ncontribution from migrants to its current standard of \r\nliving, while migrants are the victims of economic, \r\ncultural and social discrimination. The developed \r\nworld can be said to have contracted a debt with the \r\nmigrants for those contributions. A way to pay it back \r\nwould be to cancel the external debt of the source \r\ncountries. \r\n The walls and barriers being built today can hold \r\nback migration, but they do not solve the causes of the \r\npresent and continuing forced migration of millions of \r\nhuman beings. If this High-level Dialogue raises \r\ngreater awareness of the need to seek solutions that \r\nwill address the structural causes of international \r\nmigration, then it will have been worthwhile for the \r\nSecretary-General to have convened it; but if we \r\nconfine ourselves to migratory flow management \r\nformulas, we shall at best be postponing the impending \r\ncrisis to which the phenomenon is leading.  \r\n The beneficiaries of the current world order \r\nshould reflect on this issue — if not with generosity, at \r\nleast with intelligence and common sense. Solutions \r\nare urgently needed. It is better to arrive at them \r\nbetween us all through cooperation. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Christian Wenaweser, chairman of \r\nthe delegation of Liechtenstein. \r\n Mr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): International \r\nmigrants numbering 191 million constitute an \r\nimportant factor in the global economy. Their decision \r\nto migrate has, however, first and foremost an impact \r\non local communities, in countries of origin as well as \r\nin countries of destination. And the impact is not only \r\nan economic one. The report of the Secretary-General \r\n(A/60/871) illustrates that migration also generates far-\r\nreaching social, cultural and political consequences.  \r\n The challenges of governing international \r\nmigration are radically different from those involved in \r\nmanaging the movements of inanimate objects such as \r\ngoods, capital or information. Co-development through \r\ninternational migration should therefore be understood \r\nand discussed as a people-centred process of which \r\nmany aspects cannot be measured in purely economic \r\nterms. Promotion of a people-centred process would \r\nhelp in responding to the many differences in global \r\nmigration patterns and to local conditions of sending \r\nand receiving societies. It would also ensure a human \r\nrights approach in our policymaking at the local, \r\nnational and international levels. \r\n Lack of the rule of law and low levels of human \r\nsecurity, together with underdevelopment, are often at \r\nthe origin of the desire to search for a better future \r\nabroad. Coupled with misinformation on the \r\nA/61/PV.6  \r\n \r\n06-52461 14 \r\n \r\npossibilities and limitations of migration, such \r\nsituations may lead to the exploitation of migrants and \r\nto violations of their human rights.  \r\n States have a responsibility to properly inform \r\npeople about the conditions of regular migration. They \r\nalso have the obligation to raise awareness of the \r\npositive contributions of migrants to society, in order \r\nto counter racism, xenophobia and discrimination, and \r\nthey have to take firm action against any elements in \r\nsociety that seek to abuse, intimidate or exploit \r\nmigrants.  \r\n Mr. Awaluddin (Indonesia), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair. \r\n Migrants who deliberately challenge the rule of \r\nlaw or the human rights of others must, for their part, \r\nexpect States to take measures against them. Ensuring \r\nthe rule of law with full respect for human rights in \r\ncountries of origin and destination must be an essential \r\nelement of any international and national migration \r\npolicy. Rule of law and human rights are the basis for \r\ngood governance of international migration, which is \r\nbeneficial for the sustainable co-development of all \r\ncountries and for the migrants themselves. \r\n While migration is a global phenomenon, its \r\nforms and manifestations vary from region to region, \r\nas does its impact on individual countries. The \r\nexperience of small countries shows that their ability to \r\ncope with the challenges of migration is more likely to \r\nbe stretched. Emigration of highly educated persons \r\ntends to affect small countries earlier because their \r\npool of human resources is limited. Similarly, the \r\neconomies of many small developing States depend to \r\na high degree on remittances. On the receiving side, it \r\nis often the small countries which account for the \r\nhighest percentage of migrants living or working in \r\ntheir jurisdiction. The impact of large cross-border \r\nmovements of persons tends to be more directly felt in \r\nsmall communities.  \r\n As a small State, Liechtenstein has been seeking \r\nto balance economic necessities with the social \r\nchallenges of migration. With a population of roughly \r\n35,000 persons and 34 per cent non-Liechtenstein \r\nnationals residing in the country, Liechtenstein is home \r\nto people from about 90 different countries. One of the \r\npriorities of Government policy lies in the promotion \r\nof integration through the provision of targeted \r\nservices for migrants, to learn the national language. \r\nThose services have proven especially helpful for the \r\nintegration of women migrants and their young \r\nchildren. Many other measures are currently under \r\ndiscussion to further promote integration, which is \r\nbased on the cooperation of both sides — the receiving \r\nand the migrant communities.  \r\n In its development cooperation, Liechtenstein has \r\nbeen placing special emphasis on the development of \r\nrural areas in small developing countries. The projects \r\nit has been financing seek to improve the livelihoods of \r\npeople outside their countries. Political and financial \r\ninvestments in integration measures, based on the rule \r\nof law and respect for human rights, as well as \r\ndevelopment cooperation with small countries, are the \r\ntwo pillars of sound migration policy. Liechtenstein \r\nwill accordingly continue to contribute to international \r\nefforts to realize the full potential of migration, for the \r\nco-development of countries and migrants alike. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Luis Alberto Sepúlveda, Director \r\nof Consular and Migration Affairs of Chile. \r\n Mr. Sepúlveda (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): My \r\ndelegation welcomes the decision of the General \r\nAssembly to hold this High-level Dialogue on the \r\nhighly important topic of international migration and \r\ndevelopment. We are confident that this initiative will \r\nplace that social and economic phenomenon, involving \r\nalmost 200 million people in the world, at the centre of \r\nthe United Nations agenda. \r\n Allow me to point out that the President of Chile, \r\nMs. Michelle Bachelet, also underwent the difficult \r\nexperience of being a migrant, when in the mid-1970s, \r\nowing to political reasons, she had to leave her \r\ncountry. Consequently, she is closely acquainted with \r\nthe adversities and insecurities that come of leaving \r\nbehind homeland and loved ones. \r\n The position of Chile on the key subject of \r\nmigration is basically reflected in the Declaration of \r\nAsunción, adopted at the VIth South American \r\nConference on Migration, held in May 2006, and in the \r\nDeclaration of Santiago on Migration Principles, \r\nagreed upon at the Meeting of Ministers of the Interior \r\nof the Common Market of the South and Associate \r\nStates, held in May 2004. \r\n One of the central themes of this debate should be \r\nthe developmental dimension of migration, and \r\nparticularly its contribution to poverty reduction. The \r\nmain challenge facing us is the process of making \r\n A/61/PV.6\r\n \r\n15 06-52461 \r\n \r\ninternational migration a positive force for the \r\ncomprehensive and harmonious development of our \r\npeoples. \r\n To that end, we must see how the sizeable \r\nresources created by remittances can be channelled \r\ntowards development objectives that benefit migrants \r\nand their families. Chile accordingly considers that the \r\ncost of remittance transfers should be reduced, that \r\nremittance flows should be facilitated and that \r\ndevelopment-oriented investments in recipient \r\ncountries should be encouraged, supplementing and \r\ncomplementing official development assistance. \r\n In addition, we share, along with other Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean States, the concern about the \r\nrights of migrants and their families. In that spirit, \r\nChile last year ratified the International Convention on \r\nthe Protection of the Rights of all Migrant Workers and \r\nMembers of Their Families. We reaffirm our total \r\ncommitment to the promotion and protection of the \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms of all migrant \r\nmen, women and children, regardless of their legal \r\nstatus, beliefs, religion or ethnicity, in accordance with \r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights. \r\n We believe that this High-level Dialogue should \r\nmark the beginning in the Organization of a process of \r\nreflection and ongoing consultation on international \r\nmigration. Nevertheless, we believe that this exercise \r\nshould not lead to the establishment of a new body \r\nwithin the United Nations, nor should it duplicate the \r\nfunctions of existing bodies and mechanisms. \r\n Our country is the product of the integration and \r\nmixture of indigenous populations with various waves \r\nof European and Arab migrants. As a result of \r\neconomic developments in recent decades in our \r\ncountry, Chile has now become a country of \r\ndestination for migrants. As a host country, we have \r\nendeavoured at this time to formulate and implement a \r\npolicy seeking to modernize the management of \r\nmigration, principally by improving the living \r\nconditions of foreigners, so that their establishment and \r\nintegration in the country can benefit all concerned. \r\n The migration policy of Chile is based on the \r\nfollowing principles: guarantees of the right of \r\nresidence and freedom of movement, guarantees of \r\nfreedom of thought and conscience, access to residence \r\non a basis of equality, access to justice as a right of all \r\nimmigrants, social protection of immigrants, \r\nguarantees of the labour rights of foreign workers in \r\nChile, non-discrimination and family reunification. \r\n At the same time, as a country of origin, we have \r\na responsibility towards Chilean migrants residing \r\nabroad. As a crucial step towards meeting that \r\nresponsibility, in 2003 and 2004 our country carried \r\nout its first voluntary census of Chileans residing \r\nabroad. That entailed arduous but valuable work on the \r\nfive continents and in some 100 countries. That effort \r\nhelped to strengthen links between Chilean society and \r\nthe community of Chileans abroad. \r\n We have been able to confirm, in the course of \r\nthese two days, that there is a significant and \r\nexpanding awareness in the international community \r\nregarding the realities of migration, including migrant \r\nrights and the benefits they bring to development and \r\nto poverty relief in the world.  \r\n We hope that this meeting will constitute a real \r\nand decisive milestone on the road to progress in \r\ndealing with this important social phenomenon specific \r\nto our age, which we must decisively address. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ewald Limon, Chairman of the \r\ndelegation of Suriname.  \r\n Mr. Limon (Suriname): Globalization, advances \r\nin communications and transportation, \r\nunderdevelopment, lack of opportunity and poverty, \r\nhave all contributed to the increase in the flow of \r\nmigrants. We share the view that there is a need for \r\neffective management of international migration. For \r\nsuch management to be achieved, all stakeholders must \r\nbe involved and all root causes must be examined. My \r\ndelegation therefore welcomes the convening of this \r\nHigh-level Dialogue and considers it an excellent \r\nopportunity to exchange views at the global level. \r\n We align ourselves with the statement delivered \r\nby the representative of South Africa on behalf of the \r\nGroup of 77 and China. The Government of Suriname \r\nagrees that international migration should be managed \r\nin a manner that contributes to the development efforts \r\nof States. A process of consultation and an exchange of \r\nviews, including best practices on the various aspects \r\nof international migration, are therefore needed. The \r\nconsultations on co-development and the maximization \r\nof the impact of remittances on the development \r\nprocess are of special interest to my delegation. \r\nA/61/PV.6  \r\n \r\n06-52461 16 \r\n \r\n Suriname believes that there is need for a steady \r\nflow of skilled human resources to meet the nation’s \r\ndevelopment objectives. Therefore, the Dialogue \r\nshould discuss and explore possible arrangements to \r\ncompensate for the loss of skilled personnel between \r\nthe receiving States and States of origin, given the high \r\ncost of training human resources. In addition, the \r\nadvantages of the brain gain and brain circulation \r\narrangements could be examined. The Dialogue could \r\nalso examine the use of remittances for economic \r\ninvestment and social advancement, for education and \r\nhealth services and for housing purposes, as well as \r\nassisting in analysing financial services, attracting \r\nsavings for, and investment in, those areas. \r\n With regard to international migration, Suriname \r\nis engaged in a process of evaluation at the national \r\nlevel, and consultation and exchange of views at the \r\nregional level, in order to strengthen our migration \r\npolicy. We are convinced of the need for international \r\nmigration to evolve within a framework that guarantees \r\nfull respect for human rights. \r\n Among our commitments at the national level are \r\nactions to ensure that migration takes place within a \r\nlegal framework and that trafficking in persons is more \r\neffectively countered. At the core of these actions is the \r\nestablishment of a special police unit responsible for \r\nthe combating of human trafficking and related crimes. \r\nIn addition, an information campaign concerning \r\ntrafficking in persons and related crimes was launched, \r\nand policy decisions have been taken that will \r\nguarantee the safe return of victims of trafficking to \r\ntheir countries of origin. \r\n Suriname values the contribution and initiatives \r\nof the various regional organizations and institutions \r\nwith regard to the manifold aspects of international \r\nmigration. We are therefore actively participating in \r\nthat process. \r\n At the regional level, consultations are ongoing \r\nwithin the framework of the African, Caribbean and \r\nPacific groups of States; the South American \r\nconsultation mechanism; and the Caribbean \r\nCommunity. This dialogue can significantly contribute \r\nto discussions on improving coherence on migration \r\npolicy, foster dialogue between sending and receiving \r\nStates, support regional consultative processes and \r\nstrengthen coherence and coordination among agencies \r\nat all levels. \r\n Hence we consider this meeting to be the start of \r\na process at the global level that complements \r\nconsultations and actions at the regional and bilateral \r\nlevel with regard to international migration. We \r\ntherefore support the Secretary-General’s proposal for \r\nthe establishment of a consultative forum on migration \r\nand development issues. \r\n The Acting President: I give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Eduardo Sevilla Somoza, chairman of \r\nthe delegation of Nicaragua. \r\n Mr. Sevilla Somoza (Nicaragua) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): We wish to associate ourselves with the \r\nstatement made by the delegation of Guyana on behalf \r\nof the Rio Group and with the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of South Africa on behalf of the Group \r\nof 77. \r\n Nicaragua welcomes this High-level Dialogue on \r\nMigration and Development and deems it particularly \r\ntimely and relevant, as these two issues should be dealt \r\nwith in a comprehensive and integrated manner. We \r\nrecognize that the issue of migration involves all \r\nsectors of Government, and we believe also that \r\naccount should be taken of the experiences and views \r\nof the relevant non-governmental sectors, including \r\ndiaspora associations, civil society and the private \r\nsector. \r\n We welcome the fact that this dialogue is \r\nmultidimensional and is launching a quest for the best \r\nway to ensure that migration contributes to \r\ndevelopment. Indeed, the United Nations is the forum \r\nbest suited to this exchange of ideas and experiences. \r\nSince migration is a global phenomenon that occurs not \r\nonly between pairs of countries or within one single \r\nregion, but from and to all parts of the world, we must \r\nconsider it collectively. \r\n We very much welcome, as a follow-up to this \r\nHigh-level Dialogue and in order to deal in greater \r\ndepth with the broad subject of migration and \r\ndevelopment, the recommendation of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to establish a consultative forum led by States \r\nand open to the 192 States Members of the United \r\nNations. Such a forum would offer Governments a \r\nvenue to discuss issues related to international \r\nmigration and development in a systematic and \r\ncomprehensive way. \r\n The Government of Nicaragua attaches high \r\npriority to the combat against trafficking in human \r\n A/61/PV.6\r\n \r\n17 06-52461 \r\n \r\nbeings. To that end, in February 2004 we formed a \r\nNational Coalition against Trafficking in Persons, with \r\nthe participation of several related institutions. They \r\nare making significant progress in fighting this scourge \r\nat the national and regional levels, with a firm \r\ncommitment to protecting human rights. \r\n The programme to fight trafficking in persons \r\nlaunched by the Government of Nicaragua together \r\nwith the International Orgaqnization for Migration \r\n(IOM) and members of the national coalition against \r\ntrafficking in persons is holding regular working \r\nsessions with a view to drafting a repatriation protocol \r\nthat sets out administrative and legal guidelines in that \r\nrespect that are based on daily experience. It also aims \r\nto take, along with the participants, concrete actions \r\nand steps in the context of the various components of \r\nthe process: research, repatriation, assistance, and \r\nlegalization of the system. The result will be the \r\ndrafting at the national level of the protocol for the \r\nreturn of boys, girls and adolescents victims of human \r\ntrafficking, which is in the final stages of ratification.  \r\n Our Government also participated in the technical \r\nmeeting held in Guatemala on 9 and 10 March to \r\nconsider the possibility of elaborating a regional \r\nprotocol that would include guidelines for the \r\nrepatriation of victims of trafficking and vulnerable \r\npopulations. The outcome of that meeting yielded a \r\ndraft setting out regional guidelines for providing \r\nspecial protection to boys, girls and adolescents who \r\nare victims of trafficking. \r\n We are aware of the technical limitations to our \r\nwork, but experience has shown that the political and \r\npersonal will of all involved with the issue is \r\nfundamental to the eradication of this social scourge. \r\nThat is why we have been developing a new culture of \r\ncitizenship, thereby contributing to the fulfilment of \r\nthe principle of shared responsibility between the State, \r\nthe family and society in guaranteeing human rights, in \r\nparticular those of children and of adolescents. \r\n The efforts that have been undertaken by the \r\nvarious departments of the Ministry of the Interior \r\nresponsible for the national police, migration, \r\nimmigration, coexistence and citizens’ security are \r\nshowing positive results among the general population \r\nas well as the student population in terms of prevention \r\nand detection. However, since the crime of trafficking \r\nis very complex and has various manifestations, it \r\nwould be better addressed if certain State institutions \r\nand national and international non-governmental \r\norganizations with experience in this area were able \r\nbetter to coordinate their work within the National \r\nCoalition against Trafficking in Persons, so that we \r\ncould more effectively optimize and distribute the \r\nresources available. \r\n The Acting President: I give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ali Hachani, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of Tunisia. \r\n Mr. Hachani (Tunisia) (spoke in French): I \r\nshould like to endorse the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of South Africa on behalf of the Group \r\nof 77 and China. \r\n This important debate is the first high-level event \r\nof the United Nations entirely devoted to migration and \r\ndevelopment. It is the outcome of a long process of \r\ncoordination and reflection undertaken at both the \r\ninternational and regional levels. \r\n In that framework, I should like in particular to \r\nmention the Euro-African conference on Migration and \r\nDevelopment, held at Rabat on 10 and 11 July 2006, \r\nwhose conclusions, namely the Declaration and Action \r\nPlan, encompass a broad range of measures relating to \r\nmigration and development, including the \r\nestablishment of financial mechanisms to promote co-\r\ndevelopment, as well as issues relating to legal \r\nmigration, and judicial and police cooperation in the \r\nfight against illegal immigration. \r\n Increased international interest in questions of \r\nmigration, of which this High-level Dialogue is a \r\nconsequence, shows that now more than ever migration \r\nis a cross-cutting issue in all societies, with economic, \r\npolitical and cultural aspects closely linked to \r\ndevelopment. Globalization especially has brought this \r\nto the foreground. Migration can no longer be dealt \r\nwith on a short-term basis or unilaterally, but as part of \r\na cooperative plan, for the process of migration \r\nrequires coordinated, multidimensional responses. \r\n Because of increased disparities in development, \r\nunbalanced changes in population growth and the \r\nmultiplication of conflicts, there is a clear trend of \r\nincreased migratory flows, which must be taken into \r\naccount in the formulation and implementation of \r\nmigration policies. Thus migration, which is much \r\nmore a necessity than a choice, should be dealt with \r\ncomprehensively and incorporated into programmes for \r\neconomic development and cooperation among States. \r\nA/61/PV.6  \r\n \r\n06-52461 18 \r\n \r\nIt is inconceivable that at a time when borders are \r\nopening to the flow of trade, services and capital, they \r\nare increasingly closed to the flow of persons. This \r\ninevitably leads to clandestine migration and all that \r\nthat implies in terms of risks to individuals and to \r\nsociety in general. \r\n Migration ought not to be a threat, we believe; it \r\nshould be a factor for mutual enrichment, both socio-\r\neconomically and in terms of culture. It is an \r\nappropriate alternative response to the needs of the \r\nlabour market in industrialized countries and an \r\nessential, complementary and rewarding component in \r\nvarious areas of bilateral, regional and multilateral \r\ncooperation. International events over the past few \r\nyears give the issue of migration political, economic, \r\nsocial and cultural importance and confirm the close \r\ninterdependence between changes in both countries of \r\norigin and countries of destination, involving the \r\nresponsibilities of all parties. \r\n I would like to stress that collaborative \r\nmanagement of migration, based on a comprehensive \r\napproach that conforms with and respects the interest \r\nof the different countries, has become one of the major \r\nchallenges that the international community must take \r\nup at the beginning of this millennium in order to \r\nestablish a balance between the imperatives of \r\ndevelopment and the constraints of globalization. \r\n It is also of paramount importance that we \r\nhighlight the promotion of the transfer of new \r\ntechnologies and the exchange of skills in order to \r\nstrengthen the economies of the countries of origin and \r\nof destination through increased international, bilateral \r\nand triangular development cooperation as well as \r\ndecentralized cooperation between local institutions \r\nand development agencies. \r\n My delegation endorses the finding that financial \r\nflows from immigrants are poorly or little used, owing \r\nto high transfer costs. It is necessary to discuss \r\nmeasures to decrease transfer costs and thus provide \r\nadditional resources for financing development. \r\nHowever, remittances sent by migrant workers cannot \r\nbe considered as and made part of international \r\nfinancing for development, not can they substitute for \r\nit. Remittances are fluctuating private resources, of a \r\ncomplementary nature. \r\n My delegation shares the idea that the \r\nMillennium Development Goals process must discuss \r\nmigration and development. \r\n Given the increased interdependence of the two \r\nshores of the Mediterranean — a political and \r\ngeographical area of which Tunisia is part — and the \r\ncomplexity of migratory movements, Tunisia has \r\nrepeatedly appealed for the establishment of a \r\nconstructive dialogue to promote the development of a \r\nsustainable and dynamic process that makes emigration \r\none of the elements of economic cooperation, of \r\nequitable development and of cultural exchanges \r\nbetween the North and South of the Mediterranean, \r\nespecially in the western region. \r\n In that spirit, Tunisia is pleased that the first \r\nMinisterial Conference of the 5+5 Dialogue on \r\nMigration in the Western Mediterranean was held in \r\nTunis on 16 and 17 October 2002. That conference \r\nunanimously adopted the Tunis Declaration, which \r\nrepresents a fundamental new step in Euro-\r\nMediterranean cooperation. \r\n I would also like to mention the positive \r\nevolution of the 5+5 Dialogue through the holding of \r\nannual ministerial meetings, which shows that the \r\ncountries involved recognize the need to continue the \r\ndialogue, consultation and coordination in the area of \r\nmigration. The Fifth Ministerial Conference, to be held \r\nin Madrid in November 2006, will be a new milestone \r\nin the Euro-Mediterranean partnership. \r\n Tunisia will continue to attach appropriate \r\nimportance to the questions of migration and to \r\nmaintain to its partners that unilateral solutions and \r\nadministrative and security measures do not \r\nnecessarily lead to the effective and sustainable \r\nhandling of the migration issue. \r\n As His Excellency President Zine El Abidine Ben \r\nAli has stated, \r\n “Migration today is not the simple search for \r\nemployment and a source of income. It is also an \r\nessential aspect of the creation of wealth, a basis \r\nof stability and united co-development, and a \r\ndecisive factor in enriching areas of mutual \r\nknowledge and rapprochement among nations.” \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Guy Serieys, Chairman of the \r\nDelegation of France. \r\n Mr. Serieys (France) (spoke in French): The \r\nglobal phenomenon of migration is in large part the \r\nresult of inequalities in development between various \r\nregions of our planet. How can we forget that today \r\n A/61/PV.6\r\n \r\n19 06-52461 \r\n \r\none fifth of the world’s population enjoys four fifths of \r\nthe world’s wealth? \r\n Dramatic and daily events that illustrate the vital \r\nneed for mobility make us aware that the phenomena of \r\nmigration cannot be dealt with without taking into \r\nconsideration the development of the countries of the \r\nSouth. We must each, at our own level of \r\nresponsibility, mobilize to re-examine our activities \r\nand efforts from that angle. The goals of development \r\nmust remain the pillar of international cooperation. \r\nAnd for that, we must reinforce the instruments and \r\nmeans for combating poverty and promoting \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals \r\nthat we defined together. In that sense, human \r\ndevelopment, health and education, but also economic \r\ndevelopment, remain our priorities. If immigrants opt \r\nfor exile, it is because the means for attaining those \r\nGoals are not being effectively implemented. Much too \r\nfrequently, conflicts and insecurity motivate this \r\nchoice. \r\n If we meet here today — countries of origin, \r\ncountries of transit and countries of destination — it is \r\nbecause we have become aware of the role that \r\nmigrants play in the development of their countries of \r\norigin. \r\n In order to make the most of that link, the \r\nGovernment of France recently adopted an inter-\r\nministerial strategy on migration and development \r\nbased on three aspects and which fully takes into \r\naccount European initiatives on this issue. \r\n First, we want to facilitate — through \r\nco-development projects that France has been \r\nimplementing for several years — individual and \r\ncollective initiatives by migrants in favour of their \r\nregions of origin through financing microprojects that \r\npromote local development and employment. These \r\ninitiatives require a strong partnership with immigrant \r\nassociations and with the authorities of partner \r\ncountries. In this regard we include Morocco, Mali and \r\nSenegal in the first rank today. \r\n The second aspect of our strategy concerns \r\nremittances by immigrants to their regions of origin. \r\nThe transfer of savings is the most eloquent expression \r\nof the socio-economic tie between diasporas and their \r\nregions of origin. In order to promote the investment of \r\nsavings in development, we back both a reduction in \r\ntransfer costs by encouraging competition between \r\nbanking institutions and support for immigrants in their \r\nprojects. The creation of a development savings \r\naccount should make it possible to exempt from taxes \r\nsavings that are used in the productive sector. \r\n Finally, we should act against the brain drain and \r\nloss of human resources, fostering North-South and \r\nSouth-South mobility. We want to associate the elites \r\nestablished in France with the development of their \r\ncontinent, notably at the level of training and skills \r\ntransfer. We also want to take steps to facilitate the \r\nmobility of qualified people in the diaspora, namely, \r\ndoctors, engineers, university staff and high-level \r\npersonnel who reside in France and who could, with \r\nour help, participate in our cooperation programmes \r\nand thereby transmit their knowledge and skills to the \r\ncountries of the South. \r\n Our approach to the challenges of international \r\nmigration and development can be neither exclusively \r\nbilateral nor exclusively regional. Migration routes \r\nchange as globalization develops, and we must, \r\ntherefore, facilitate the emergence of a multilateral \r\napproach that tends itself to the identification of \r\npractical means of intervention. The proper forum for \r\npursuing this line of thinking is of course the United \r\nNations, but care should be taken not to exclude those \r\nwho are mainly concerned, namely, the migrants \r\nthemselves. \r\n We should pool our experiences. In that regard, \r\nthe most recent Euro-African Ministerial Conference \r\non Migration and Development was, in our opinion, an \r\nessential stage in the definition of a North-South \r\npartnership aimed at providing a global and balanced \r\napproach to migration issues. We should also \r\nencourage the emergence of a system of effective \r\nexchange among Governments and international \r\norganizations working in these areas, be it at the level \r\nof objective analysis of the issues or at the level of \r\nprogrammes to be launched to meet the challenges that \r\nwe face. \r\n I have no doubt that our contributions to this \r\nHigh-level Dialogue will manage to shed light on these \r\nvarious questions, taking account of the variety of the \r\nsituations and people concerned. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Julian Vila-Coma, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of Andorra. \r\n Mr. Vila-Coma (Andorra) (spoke in French): \r\nFirst of all, I would like to congratulate Ms. Rashed \r\nA/61/PV.6  \r\n \r\n06-52461 20 \r\n \r\nAl-Khalifa on her appointment as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and, at the same time, to thank the \r\nSecretary-General for his excellent report on \r\ninternational migration and development (A/60/871) \r\nand his recommendation to set up a global consultative \r\nforum on this issue. We firmly believe such a forum to \r\nbe a fundamental tool for working constructively on \r\nthis phenomenon, one of the most sensitive in today’s \r\nworld, taking into account the links that exist between \r\ninternational migration and development. \r\n In that regard, Andorra also wishes to commend \r\nthe initiative of the Government of Belgium, which has \r\noffered to host the first forum meeting on this topic in \r\n2007. \r\n Andorra, which has long been a country of origin \r\nfor migrants, can testify to the changes that this \r\nphenomenon makes to all the different aspects of the \r\nlife of a small country. Andorra, with an economy \r\nbased essentially on tourism, trade and services, has \r\nnot been untouched by this phenomenon. It underwent \r\nan important change at the end of the first half of the \r\ntwentieth century when it went from being a country of \r\norigin to a country of destination. \r\n The history of Andorra then became inseparable \r\nfrom the phenomenon of immigration, which triggered \r\na process of development unprecedented in its history. \r\nImmigration took place within a legal framework that \r\nmade it possible for the various demographic, \r\neconomic, political and social factors involved in that \r\ntransformation to be carefully tied in with our everyday \r\nlife in order to create a sense of belonging to our \r\ncommunity. \r\n Moreover, upon the adoption of our new \r\nConstitution, political relations were facilitated \r\nbetween Andorra as a country of destination and the \r\ncountries of origin within a legal framework that is \r\nmore favourable to the integration of migrants, while \r\nallowing them to maintain links with their countries of \r\norigin. \r\n Allow me to stress my country’s interest in all the \r\nissues with which we are concerned here. Andorra \r\nselected the subject as the main topic for discussion at \r\nour twenty-third summer congress this year, in order to \r\nanalyse the related challenges and opportunities in \r\nhistorical, political, legal, sociological and cultural \r\nterms. \r\n Andorra supports all strategies based on the study \r\nof the phenomenon of migration in the context of \r\nbilateral and multilateral cooperation, because we are \r\nconvinced that only such an approach will yield \r\npositive results in that regard. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Choi Young-jin, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of the Republic of Korea. \r\n Mr. Choi Young-jin (Republic of Korea): \r\nImmigration echoes many of the aspects of \r\nglobalization. It is indeed, a multidimensional and \r\nglobal phenomenon. With almost 200 million \r\ninternational emigrants in the world, it has the potential \r\nto reshape the basic structure of our societies and to \r\ninject the countries of origin and destination with new \r\nideas, input, and energy. A by-product of our \r\ninterdependence, migration is a testament to our \r\ndiversity. \r\n As is noted in the report of the Secretary-General \r\n(A/60/871), the goals of the High-level Dialogue are \r\nclear: to raise awareness of the development \r\ndimensions of migration, to examine the migration-\r\ndevelopment nexus and to identify examples of best \r\npractices. \r\n The Republic of Korea has been mentioned as a \r\nnoteworthy case with regard to migration policies. We \r\nhave the dual status of a country of origin and \r\ndestination; we attract home our expatriate researchers \r\nthrough various policy incentives; and we successfully \r\nintegrate a large number of foreign immigrants into \r\nKorean society. \r\n In order to maximize the benefits and contain any \r\ncollateral damage of migration, policies tailored to \r\nthose particularities of the country are indispensable. \r\nWithout them, migration could lead to an uneven \r\ndistribution of benefits among societies. \r\n Our first task in addressing this issue, then, \r\nshould be to devise comprehensive and coherent \r\nmigration policies in all concerned countries. Poorly \r\nintegrated immigrants are a source of segregation, \r\nsocial problems, tensions and security-related \r\nchallenges. Countries of destination should focus on \r\nformulating migration policies that take into account \r\nthe long-term objective of social integration. \r\n Another focus of a win-win migration policy \r\ninvolves the introduction of a domestic system to \r\nabsorb the migration benefits by the countries of \r\n A/61/PV.6\r\n \r\n21 06-52461 \r\n \r\norigin. Remittances — at least $167 billion in 2005 \r\nalone — seem to be one of the most immediate and \r\ntangible benefits of migration. Without a solid social \r\nsystem, however, the development potential of those \r\nhuge resources cannot be realized. \r\n In order for remittances to actually benefit the \r\nlocal economy, we first need to seek ways to reduce \r\ntransnational transaction fees. Secondly, migrant \r\nfamilies should be provided with technical assistance \r\nto utilize remittances in order to enhance productivity \r\nand thus increase their income. Microfinances would \r\nbe the most useful system for the families of migrants. \r\nCountries of origin must also put mechanisms in place \r\nto mobilize the developmental potential of skilled \r\nmigrants who return home. \r\n I believe that we cannot maximize the \r\ncontributions of migrants to societies without enlisting \r\nthe help of the business community. The business \r\ncommunity must recognize the economic potential of \r\nmigrants, not only in terms of their labour, but also as \r\ncontributors to the expansion of trade and tourism. The \r\nbusiness community should thus be actively involved \r\nin discussions on the development potential of \r\nimmigration. Furthermore, various methods to \r\nfacilitate real partnerships between Governments, \r\ninternational organizations and the private sector need \r\nto be considered. In this regard, the Global Compact \r\nprovides a worthy model of a successful international \r\nbusiness partnership. \r\n International cooperation on issues relating to \r\nmigration is also crucial. The recently established \r\nGlobal Migration Group should serve to enhance \r\ncoordination, cooperation and coherence between \r\ninternational organizations working in the field of \r\nmigration and development. At the same time, we must \r\nalso embrace regional efforts such as the Bali Process, \r\namong others. \r\n The Acting President: I give the floor to \r\nHer Excellency Ms. Caroline Ziade, chair of the \r\ndelegation of Lebanon. \r\n Ms. Ziade (Lebanon): We welcome the holding \r\nof this High-level Dialogue on International Migration \r\nand Development. We believe that this Dialogue will \r\nprovide an excellent opportunity for an exchange of \r\nideas and views on migration. Furthermore, it will \r\nallow for the exploration of new horizons in terms of \r\nincreasing the mutual benefits derived from migration. \r\nWe also appreciate the efforts of the Secretary-General \r\nin preparing his report (A/60/871) entitled \r\n“International migration and development”, and we \r\nconsider it to be a good step forward. \r\n Lebanon has 4 million people inside the country \r\nand 12 million people abroad, whose number includes \r\n3 per cent of the population of Australia. Gibran Khalil \r\nGibran, Carlos Ghosn, Elias Khoury, George Dabaghi, \r\nNicolas Hayek, Amin Maalouf: they are but a small \r\nexample of the great contribution that Lebanese \r\nexpatriates have bestowed upon their host nations and \r\nthe world. \r\n Migration is a phenomenon that has paralleled the \r\nmodern history of human beings. It was the prospect of \r\novercoming adversity and improving their standard of \r\nliving that pushed many men and women to leave their \r\nhomelands and migrate to wealthier and more \r\ndeveloped countries. It is quite obvious that the main \r\nreasons for migration are poverty, underdevelopment, \r\nsocial exclusion and foreign occupation, together with \r\nthe absence of peace, security and stability, the large \r\nincome differential between high- and low-income \r\ncountries and economic crises. \r\n In 2005, the estimated number of international \r\nmigrants reached 191 million, of whom 115 million \r\nlived in developed countries and 75 million in \r\ndeveloping countries. This means that the magnitude of \r\nSouth-to-South migration is comparable to that of \r\nSouth-to-North migration. \r\n The positive economic and social impact of \r\nmigration on the receiving and sending countries is \r\ncertainly beyond doubt. According to World Bank \r\nestimates, migrants’ remittances at the world level \r\namounted to an estimated $232 billion in 2005. The \r\nshare of global remittances going to developing \r\ncountries is equal to $167 billion. Those remittances \r\nincrease families’ incomes in countries of origin and \r\nhelp them secure access to services such as education \r\nand health. They also improve the entrepreneurship \r\natmosphere and increase the ability of households to \r\nmake productive investments. In Lebanon, for instance, \r\nthe remittances of Lebanese emigrants are estimated to \r\nbe equal to 12 per cent of gross domestic product. \r\n In certain cases, the contribution of remittances to \r\nthe overall economies of countries of origin is greater \r\nthan official development assistance. There is a need, \r\ntherefore, for more action to reduce the transfer fees \r\ntied to migrant remittances with a view to increasing \r\nthe benefits derived from them. The important \r\nA/61/PV.6  \r\n \r\n06-52461 22 \r\n \r\ncontribution of remittances to the economies of the \r\nsending countries should not be used as a pretext to \r\nreduce official development assistance to developing \r\ncountries. \r\n It is well known that migrants who return home \r\nbring with them expertise and savings. They use their \r\nexpertise to transfer to their countries of origin the \r\nknow-how they acquired in the countries of \r\ndestination. Moreover, they use their savings to start \r\nbusinesses that contribute to job creation in the \r\ncountries of origin, thereby reducing unemployment \r\nrates. \r\n In countries of destination, migrants supplement, \r\nrather than substitute, the greater majority of workers \r\nin the receiving countries. Inflows of low-skilled \r\nmigrants help to fill jobs that are no longer attractive to \r\nthe local population. Migrant workers also help to \r\nmaintain services that would otherwise disappear. \r\n The receiving States should respect the human \r\nrights of migrants. The receiving States, together with \r\nthe countries of origin, should combat the traffic in \r\npersons and the smuggling of migrants and punish \r\nthose offences. Also, receiving States should accord \r\nmigrants equal treatment and should prohibit all forms \r\nof discrimination. The successful integration of \r\nmigrants depends upon their protection from racism, \r\nxenophobia and ethnocentrism. \r\n In conclusion, it is important to mention the fact \r\nthat migrants contribute greatly to the dialogue \r\nbetween culture and civilizations. They largely account \r\nfor the very first encounters between different \r\ncivilizations and cultures. The success of that dialogue \r\nhinges upon the acceptance of their differences by the \r\nhosting societies and upon the recognition of such \r\ndifferences as a source of enrichment rather than \r\ndiscord. \r\n The Acting President: In line with the \r\nannouncement made earlier, I now give the floor to the \r\nChairman of round table 4, His Excellency Mr. Jean-\r\nFrançois Ndongou, Deputy Minister to the Minister of \r\nState, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Cooperation, \r\nFrancophonie and Social Integration of Gabon. \r\n Mr. Ndongou (Gabon), Chairman of round table \r\n4 (spoke in French): It is my task to summarize the \r\ndiscussions that took place in round table 4, which \r\nfocused on the issue of promoting the building of \r\npartnerships and capacity-building and the sharing of \r\nbest practices at all levels, including the bilateral and \r\nregional levels, for the benefit of countries and \r\nmigrants alike.  \r\n Our discussion, which was thorough and \r\nthoughtful, arrived at a number of conclusions. There \r\nwas a general consensus that international cooperation \r\nis essential to promote the benefits of international \r\nimmigration and to address its problematic aspects. \r\nInternational cooperation could occur at different \r\nlevels. Bilateral negotiations and formal agreements \r\nare necessary to achieve concrete outcomes and \r\nenhance collaboration on individual matters, but since \r\nmigration involves groups of countries, multilateral \r\ncooperation is also called for. \r\n Most participants gave examples of successful \r\nmultilateral processes at the subregional and regional \r\nlevels. Those processes range from informal \r\nconsultative meetings that contribute to building \r\nunderstanding between various parties and helping to \r\nestablish common ground among the participating \r\ncountries, to the setting up of formal institutions aimed \r\nat achieving regional integration and facilitating the \r\nmovement of people. \r\n The parties agreed that such processes — which \r\nare at different stages of development — are helpful \r\nand should be sustained; they should also no doubt be \r\nreinforced by dialogue at a higher level. Some \r\nparticipants expressed their support for the \r\ncontinuation of dialogue at a global level. Several \r\nspeakers welcomed the proposal of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to set up a global consultative forum that \r\nwould allow informal consultations, so as to find \r\ncommon ground on specific issues related to \r\ninternational migration and development. The forum \r\nwould provide a means to exchange experience and \r\nbest practices so that the challenges posed by \r\ninternational migration could be addressed in concrete \r\nand effective ways. \r\n The importance of building partnership and \r\nstrengthening capacity to face the challenges posed by \r\ninternational migration, as a component of \r\ndevelopment, was underscored. The role that \r\ninternational organizations could play in that regard \r\nwas welcomed. Several types of partnership were \r\nconsidered. Participants noted that partnerships \r\nbetween Governments and the private sector could be \r\ninstrumental in promoting beneficial outcomes from \r\nmigration. Associations of employers and trade unions, \r\n A/61/PV.6\r\n \r\n23 06-52461 \r\n \r\nin particular, could help develop migration policies and \r\nsupport their implementation. \r\n We agreed on the importance of social dialogue \r\nto ensure the support of citizens for equitable migration \r\npolicies, and a better reflection of the views of all \r\nstakeholders on policy development. Governments \r\nwere encouraged to cooperate with the private sector \r\nand civil society, to improve the situation of migrant \r\nworkers and their families and also to foster a more \r\npositive perception of the contributions that migrants \r\nmake to their host countries. \r\n Cooperation between the private sector and \r\ngovernment authorities could facilitate the transfer of \r\nremittances to countries of origin, reduce transfer costs \r\nand, even more importantly, foster the productive use \r\nof migrant’s savings. International cooperation and \r\npartnership were also considered essential to combat \r\nirregular migration and find solutions to the problems \r\nthus raised. The participants called for greater \r\ncooperation between Governments and stakeholders, \r\nincluding migrants’ associations and youth. Civil \r\nsociety in general has a major role to play in \r\ncooperating with government authorities to implement \r\npolicy and to assist migrants in adapting to the host \r\nsociety. \r\n The role of partnerships between different \r\nstakeholders would be to provide training for migrants \r\nand to facilitate their adaptation to the host country and \r\ntheir reintegration upon return; the promotion of \r\nhealthcare for migrants was also highlighted. The \r\nimportance of building partnerships and garnering \r\ninternational cooperation in support of capacity-\r\nbuilding was underscored. Capacity-building was \r\ndeemed necessary by both countries of origin and \r\ncountries of destination. Capacity must be built in all \r\nbranches of government dealing with migrants, \r\nincluding, inter alia, justice, home affairs, migration \r\nservices, foreign affairs, social services and border \r\ncontrol. \r\n Civil society and the private sector could engage \r\nin partnerships for the purpose of capacity-building. \r\nIntergovernmental cooperation is also important, in \r\nparticular to share experiences and responsibility for \r\nborder control, and to ensure the protection of \r\nmigrants, especially those needing international \r\nprotection such as asylum-seekers, refugees and \r\nwomen and children. \r\n Such were the results of the discussion in round \r\ntable 4, which I call upon you to ratify. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Nguyen Tat Thanh, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of Viet Nam. \r\n Mr. Nguyen Tat Thanh (Viet Nam): Let me at \r\nthe outset thank the President of the General Assembly \r\nand the Secretary-General for their initiative and \r\nendeavours in bringing together delegates from around \r\nthe world, as well as representatives of \r\nintergovernmental and non-governmental \r\norganizations, to discuss international migration, a \r\nburning issue of our time. \r\n I am convinced that the High-level Dialogue \r\noffers a historic opportunity for a far-reaching \r\ndiscussion on, and an advanced understanding of, \r\nmultidimensional aspects of international migration \r\nand development. Viet Nam, which has about \r\n2.5 million migrants and migrant workers in more than \r\n80 countries and territories, will do whatever it can to \r\ncontribute to the success of the new process. \r\n Viet Nam associates itself with the statement \r\nmade earlier by the representative of South Africa on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China. My delegation \r\nalso shares most of the views expressed by the \r\nSecretary-General in his report entitled, “International \r\nmigration and development” (A/60/871), as well as his \r\nstatement at the opening of the Dialogue. \r\n Today, international migration is widely \r\nenvisioned in the context of globalization and the \r\ngrowing wealth disparities it engenders between \r\ndifferent countries and regions. In our view, people are \r\ndrawn to migrate mainly because of the “pull” factors, \r\nwhich are encouraged by the demand for more flexible \r\nlabour in countries of destination. That is a natural \r\nphenomenon and part of the “unfinished business of \r\nglobalization”. There is no doubt that, apart from \r\nmaking contributions towards the prosperity of \r\ndestination countries, migrants play an increasingly \r\nimportant role in promoting development and poverty \r\nreduction in countries of origin. \r\n While there is a growing recognition that \r\ninternational migration flows have increased over time, \r\nthe dynamics and policy implications of that \r\nphenomenon have not been given adequate attention. \r\nThe protection of the human rights of migrants and \r\nmigrant workers, including the rights to education, \r\nA/61/PV.6  \r\n \r\n06-52461 24 \r\n \r\nfood and adequate housing, have in many cases been \r\nignored. The exploitation of migrants, especially \r\nwomen and children, through human smuggling, \r\ntrafficking in persons and related transnational crime, \r\nstill happens. \r\n Today, women constitute half of the global \r\nmigrant population and they are among the world’s \r\nmost vulnerable workers. Their working conditions \r\nvary enormously. Some are treated as members of the \r\nemployer’s family, while others are exploited and \r\nsubjected to conditions which, in some cases, amount \r\nto virtual slavery, forced labour, servitude or sexual \r\nexploitation. \r\n Over the past few decades, migration has grown \r\nin volume and migration trends have become ever more \r\ncomplex. However, policy on migration issues is no \r\nlonger discussed in purely regional terms, while a \r\nglobal mechanism capable of coping with the \r\ncomplexities and challenges of growing migration has \r\nnot been put in place, even under the auspices of the \r\nUnited Nations. For many years now, only the \r\nInternational Organization for Migration and a number \r\nof regional structures, in collaboration with related \r\nUnited Nations agencies, have been actively involved \r\nin cooperation on migration.  \r\n The President returned to the Chair. \r\n Viet Nam is of the view that, if this “unfinished \r\nbusiness of globalization” is to be effectively taken in \r\nhand, we must, in addition to enhancing bilateral and \r\nregional cooperation on migration, establish more \r\ninstitutional mechanisms that can serve as forums in \r\nwhich all States, as well as international organizations \r\nand agencies, can exchange views and experiences and \r\npromote cooperation and the coordination of efforts \r\nwith a view to better addressing migration issues at the \r\nglobal level.  \r\n We also hope that the High-level Dialogue can \r\nfocus on considering ways and means to further \r\nintegrate the IOM into the United Nations inter-agency \r\nsystem. In addition, the High-level Dialogue and its \r\nfollow-up meetings should discuss steps and measures \r\nto further integrate migration into national and \r\ninternational development strategies and to promote \r\npartnerships, capacity-building and the sharing of best \r\npractices at all levels — including the bilateral and \r\nregional levels — for the benefit of countries of origin \r\nand countries of destination alike, as well as migrants, \r\nin order to fill a perceived gap in the United Nations \r\nsystem in respect of the issue of migration. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Daniele Bodini, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of San Marino. \r\n Mr. Bodini (San Marino): Permit me at the outset \r\nto congratulate you, Madam President, on your \r\nappointment and to wish you every success. \r\n Our country, San Marino, today enjoys economic \r\nprosperity and an enviable standard of living, but only \r\n60 years ago it was extremely poor and had scant \r\neconomic prospects. As a matter of fact, most of our \r\npeople migrated to countries where they thought they \r\ncould find job opportunities and thus a better life. In \r\nEurope, they emigrated mostly to Italy and France, \r\nwhile the preferred overseas destinations were \r\nArgentina and the United States of America. Migrant \r\nremittances and the return of our emigrants back home \r\nwere essential in boosting our country’s economic \r\ndevelopment and improving its living conditions. As a \r\nnation, we understand very well the anguish created by \r\nmigration and are very sympathetic towards people in \r\nneed who seek a better life away from their native \r\ncountries, sometimes risking their own lives and the \r\nlives of family members in desperate journeys. \r\n We believe that it is the responsibility of \r\ndeveloped countries to help such people so that their \r\nhopes can be fulfilled. Happiness is the fulfilment of \r\nhope. However, the acceptance of migrants in an \r\nenvironment that is not ready to provide adequate \r\neducation, health care, jobs and, most important, social \r\nintegration can lead to the creation of unwanted and \r\ndesolate ghettos and give rise to cultural and religious \r\nclashes, misunderstanding, intolerance and racism. \r\nSuch conditions can create, on the one hand, breeding \r\ngrounds for vocal dissent and violent protest and, on \r\nthe other, selfishness and prejudice. It is our duty as \r\nmembers of the United Nations family not only to \r\nrespond to crises, but also — and more importantly — \r\nto make every effort to prevent them. \r\n In a world of unrelenting globalization, migration \r\nis no longer only a bilateral affair; it is a multilateral \r\nmega-issue. Countries of destination should deal with \r\nmigration in a humane manner, taking into account the \r\nneeds of their own people and of their social and \r\neconomic fabrics. Countries of origin, with the \r\nassistance of the international community, should \r\nensure that their migrants do not fall victim to human \r\n A/61/PV.6\r\n \r\n25 06-52461 \r\n \r\ntrafficking and abuse. Their journeys to foreign \r\ncountries should lead not only to economic rewards, \r\nbut also to their personal fulfilment as human beings, \r\nwhich will eventually enable them to transfer their \r\nknow-how and their social and institutional knowledge \r\nto their native lands. Transparent international \r\nmigration rules and laws should be in place and in \r\nforce to prevent human rights abuses. \r\n San Marino wishes to congratulate the General \r\nAssembly on the success of this high-level meeting. \r\nWe strongly believe that the United Nations, with the \r\ncooperation of all its Members, is the best instrument \r\nfor facing the challenge of migration today and in the \r\nyears to come. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Amir Muharemi, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of Croatia. \r\n Mr. Muharemi (Croatia): Allow me to join \r\npreceding speakers in expressing satisfaction at \r\nparticipating in this High-level Dialogue on \r\nInternational Migration and Development. It gives us \r\nan excellent opportunity for an exchange of views on \r\nthis complex issue, providing new insights into the \r\nglobal phenomenon of migration. \r\n As Croatia aligns itself with the statement made \r\non behalf of the European Union, I will limit my \r\nstatement to a discussion of my country’s national \r\npolicies.  \r\n First of all, let me reiterate one of the messages \r\ncontained in the report of the Secretary-General on \r\ninternational migration and development (A/60/871), \r\nnamely, that each of us holds a piece of the migration \r\npuzzle, but none of us has the whole picture. It is time \r\nto start putting the pieces together. International \r\nmigration cannot be managed unilaterally. \r\nConsequently, country partnerships, bilateral \r\nagreements and regional arrangements on migration are \r\nmultiplying. But the complexity of migration is global; \r\nit is a fundamental feature of today’s world system and \r\ndemands attention at the global level. \r\n The Republic of Croatia is at the crossroads of \r\nmigration flows between the East and the West. As \r\nCroatia is a candidate for membership in the European \r\nUnion (EU), a consistent migration policy will surely \r\nhave new dimensions and new meaning for us. \r\nAlthough our national legislation in this area is a work \r\nin progress, Croatia has already achieved a significant \r\nimprovement in the regulation of migration, asylum \r\nand related matters in the context of harmonizing its \r\ndomestic laws with EU legislation. We are also in the \r\nprocess of adopting a document aimed at regulating \r\nnational migration strategy that envisages steps for \r\ninstitutional capacity-building to effectively manage \r\nmigration.  \r\n Croatia manages migration in accordance with \r\nthe principles of freedom of movement, solidarity and \r\nhumanity, ensuring respect for the human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms of migrants. Legal foreign \r\nimmigrants are permitted to stay in our country either \r\ntemporarily or permanently, and their social inclusion \r\nis one of our top priorities. \r\n Croatia continues to play a prominent role in \r\nregional cooperation. In collaboration with the mission \r\nof the International Organization for Migration in \r\nCroatia, a regional workshop on labour migration for \r\nintegration and development in South-East Europe was \r\nheld this year in Zagreb. Its aim was to find a platform \r\nfor discussing the further development of our policies \r\nand programmes on migration within and between \r\ncountries in South-East Europe, pointing out their \r\npositive implications in terms of economics and \r\nemployment and the fact that they help prevent \r\nirregular migration. \r\n In addition, like many other countries, Croatia is \r\nonly beginning to learn how to maximize the benefits \r\nof migration while minimizing its negative effects in \r\nterms of development. Historically, Croatia has been a \r\ncountry of emigration, but over the past decade we \r\nhave encountered a new challenge, noting the steady \r\ngrowth of a positive migratory balance. Some \r\nindustries, confronted with a shortage of highly skilled \r\nworkers, employ foreigners. That suggests that Croatia \r\nmay face a growing demand for skilled and highly \r\nskilled workers in the near future. In addition, if \r\nnegative demographic trends continue, the \r\ndevelopment of a forward-looking policy may soon \r\nbecome a matter of necessity. \r\n Recognizing the important role of scientists in \r\ndevelopment, the Croatian Government and a group of \r\nprominent scientists have launched a return migration \r\nprogramme which has encouraged Croatian scientists \r\nabroad to foster linkages with Croatia through joint \r\ninternational projects, training or specialization of \r\nskilled personnel.  \r\nA/61/PV.6  \r\n \r\n06-52461 26 \r\n \r\n The active involvement of national and local \r\nauthorities and of regional and international \r\ninstitutions, as well as of the private sector, is required \r\nif multidimensional aspects of migration issues are to \r\nbe addressed and managed in a coherent and \r\ncoordinated way. We strongly believe that migration \r\nissues need to be addressed holistically at all levels — \r\nnational, regional and global. \r\n We support the idea that migration issues should \r\ncontinue to be observed and debated in a voluntary and \r\nconsultative permanent forum, and initially within the \r\nmost valuable setting for the exchange of ideas and the \r\nsharing of experiences — the United Nations — in \r\norder for international migration to be accepted as a \r\nnormal and crucial element in the development \r\nprocess. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Yusupha Kah, Permanent Secretary, \r\nDepartment of State for the Interior of the Gambia. \r\n Mr. Kah (Gambia): My delegation wishes to \r\ncongratulate the Secretary-General for convening this \r\nimportant High-level Dialogue on International \r\nMigration and Development and to associate itself with \r\nthe statement made by the delegation of South Africa \r\non behalf of the Group of 77 and China.  \r\n This meeting is long overdue and sorely needed. \r\nGlobalization has reached a point that now demands a \r\nserious response by the international community to the \r\nmyriad problems surrounding the free movement of \r\npeople across international borders. The report of the \r\nSecretary-General (A/60/871) demonstrates that along \r\nwith the problems there are also countless benefits that \r\ninternational migration brings to both sending and \r\nreceiving countries. Transit countries also benefit from \r\nthe spillovers. It is clear that international migration is \r\nhere to stay. No one can legislate against it or wish it \r\naway.  \r\n It behoves us all, therefore, to initiate and \r\nmaintain a permanent dialogue on the phenomenon, \r\nwith a view to maximizing its benefits and minimizing \r\nits costs. Countries of the North will have to contend \r\nwith the fact that with their current demographic \r\ntrends, it is only through international migration that \r\nthey will be able to keep their economies and social \r\nsystems on an even keel. Developing countries must \r\nalso live with the fact that until the standard of living \r\nof their people improves, more and more of their \r\nnationals will head towards greener pastures in the \r\nindustrialized world. Short of imposing repressive \r\nmeasures that violate human rights, there will be no \r\nway of halting the wave. \r\n As an African country, the Gambia is concerned \r\nabout the growing preference for selective migration \r\nbeing displayed by receiving countries in the \r\ndeveloped world, because it causes a depletion of the \r\nskilled manpower base needed for our social and \r\neconomic development. It also amounts to us \r\nsubsidizing the developed countries through the cost of \r\neducation and training, which we incur in producing \r\nprofessional and skilled workers who are then siphoned \r\naway from us into the developed economies of the \r\nNorth. We must urgently address that growing \r\nphenomenon which is emerging as a major constraint \r\non our development. \r\n While we do admit that many of our countries \r\nbenefit from international migration through the \r\nremittances that migrants transmit into our economies, \r\nwe cannot accept that it should be an alternative to the \r\ncreation of internal mechanisms for growth and \r\ndevelopment; nor should it be a substitute for official \r\ndevelopment assistance. Because remittances \r\nemanating from international migration contribute to \r\nthe reduction of poverty for many households in the \r\nsending countries, ways must be found to mainstream \r\ninternational migration within the development \r\nprocess, and to relate it more explicitly to the \r\nattainment of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). \r\n We strongly support the view that we should \r\nbegin considering ways of reducing the transaction \r\ncosts of remittances and ensuring that the monies \r\nremitted are channelled more formally through our \r\nfinancial systems. \r\n The Gambia does not encourage illegal migration \r\nand has taken measures to minimize it, including: \r\nstrengthening border and sea controls; enhancing \r\ncooperation between law enforcement and security \r\nagencies; improving information gathering from the \r\npublic, particularly those at the border and on our \r\nbeach side; promulgating legislation against the \r\nsmuggling and trafficking in persons; and entering into \r\nbilateral and multilateral cooperation arrangements \r\nwith other countries. \r\n We strongly condemn any violations of the \r\nhuman rights of migrants, whatever their status, and we \r\njoin the African Union in unreservedly condemning \r\n A/61/PV.6\r\n \r\n27 06-52461 \r\n \r\nacts of racism, xenophobia and discrimination \r\nperpetrated against migrants. \r\n As both a sending and a receiving country, the \r\nGambia has mixed experiences. It is true that as a \r\ndeveloping country we are as vulnerable as any other \r\nto having our brightest and best lured away to greener \r\npastures. We have lost quite a number of people over \r\nthe years to Europe and North America. \r\n At the same time, we are a destination for \r\nhundreds of thousands of migrants, especially from the \r\nsubregion. They contribute significantly to our \r\neconomy in critical areas such as manufacturing, \r\nhealth, construction and fishing. A large proportion of \r\nteachers in our school system, and professors in our \r\nuniversity, are migrants, contributing immensely to our \r\nefforts to meet our skilled manpower needs. \r\n As a matter of policy, the Gambia will continue \r\nto seek ways of optimizing the benefits of international \r\nmigration and mitigating its negative effects. We \r\nbelieve that international migration is a complex \r\nphenomenon that requires a multifaceted approach, as \r\nwell as strong political will and commitment on the \r\npart of sending and receiving countries and the \r\ninternational community at large. It is our hope that \r\nthis Dialogue will mark the beginning of a formal and, \r\nif possible, permanent process that keeps the important \r\nsubject of international migration and development \r\nunder discussion within the international community \r\nand leads to the adoption of measures to ensure that it \r\nserves all of mankind, wherever they may be. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Wang Guangya, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of China. \r\n Mr. Wang Guangya (China) (spoke in Chinese): \r\nThe Chinese delegation supports the statement by the \r\nrepresentative of South Africa on behalf of the Group \r\nof 77 and China.  \r\n The emergence of migration and the development \r\nof human society are closely linked. Currently, the \r\nnumber and scale of international migration, as well as \r\nthe range of countries affected and the impact it \r\nproduces on the economy of those countries, have \r\nreached an unprecedented level. On the one hand, the \r\nnormal flow of migration can help people to broaden \r\ntheir horizons; promote economic and social \r\ndevelopment and cultural exchanges among countries; \r\noptimize the allocation of human, technical and \r\nfinancial resources; and enhance cooperation among \r\nStates and joint development. On the other hand, the \r\nsurge in migration has also led to the increasingly \r\nserious problems of illegal migration, human \r\ntrafficking and other transnational crimes, which pose \r\nserious challenges to social security and stability. \r\nMigration and development have thereby become \r\nimportant issues that must be faced squarely by the \r\ninternational community. \r\n The Chinese delegation wishes to share with the \r\nAssembly the following views and proposals on how to \r\nproperly handle this issue and promote joint \r\ndevelopment. \r\n To solve the problems caused by migration, it is \r\nessential to address its root causes. Ultimately, \r\nmigration is caused by unbalanced economic and social \r\ndevelopment among different countries. In order to \r\nfind a lasting solution, it is therefore necessary to \r\ngradually narrow the gap between rich and poor \r\ncountries and bring about joint economic development \r\nand overall social justice.  \r\n Secondly, it is important to improve domestic \r\npolicies, laws and regulations. Countries should \r\ncontinuously improve their migration policies, laws \r\nand regulations, protect the legitimate rights and \r\ninterests of migrants, oppose discriminatory policies \r\nand adhere to the principle of opening up legal \r\nchannels and blocking illegal ones, so as to enhance \r\nthe legal and orderly flow of migration and curb illegal \r\nmigration activities to the greatest possible extent. \r\n Thirdly, international migration must be \r\naddressed within the context of development and in a \r\ncomprehensive and coordinated manner. National \r\nGovernments should give comprehensive consideration \r\nto political, economic, social and cultural factors, \r\nstrengthen coordination among different departments, \r\nfacilitate the flow of migration in an orderly and legal \r\nmanner and enable migrants to be truly integrated into \r\nlocal societies. \r\n We should also act in the fundamental interests of \r\nmigrants, take into account their special characteristics, \r\neffectively safeguard their political, economic and \r\nsocial rights and interests, and fully respect their \r\nreligious beliefs and cultural traditions. It is also \r\nnecessary to reduce the transaction costs of \r\nremittances, enhance the effectiveness of how they are \r\nused and encourage migrants to participate in \r\ninvestment and trade and to return to their own \r\nA/61/PV.6  \r\n \r\n06-52461 28 \r\n \r\ncountries in order to play a role in promoting \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Fourthly, sincere efforts should be made to \r\nachieve international cooperation. The international \r\ncommunity — especially countries of origin, transit \r\nand destination — should strengthen dialogue and \r\ncooperation on the basis of mutual respect, equality \r\nand mutual benefit to effectively manage the flow of \r\nmigration. \r\n The Chinese Government attaches great \r\nimportance to the issue of migration and to the related \r\nopportunities and challenges. In the light of the latest \r\ndevelopments, in recent years the Chinese Government \r\nhas adjusted its border management policy and \r\nimproved the efficiency of arrangements for entering \r\nand exiting the country, in order to facilitate a regular \r\npopulation flow. At the same time, we have acted \r\nresolutely and forcefully against illegal migration. We \r\nhave formulated and improved relevant laws and \r\nregulations, intensified law enforcement and reinforced \r\npublic education. We have also incorporated into our \r\nnational development plan such elements as financial \r\nincentives and tax reductions and exemptions. We have \r\nalso simplified entry and exit procedures to encourage \r\nChinese students abroad to come back to work in China \r\nand reduce the brain drain.  \r\n China has also assumed an active role in \r\ninternational and regional migration cooperation, \r\nexchanged experiences and cooperated with relevant \r\ncountries and international organizations on the basis \r\nof mutual respect and consultations.  \r\n This Dialogue marks the beginning of the \r\ndiscussion of migration and development at the United \r\nNations. We hope that the international community will \r\nseize this opportunity to further strengthen dialogue \r\nand contribute to joint development in the world. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Alexei Tulbure, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of the Republic of Moldova. \r\n Mr. Tulbure (Republic of Moldova): For \r\nMoldova, migration is indeed an important source of \r\ndevelopment. We have come here to confirm the clear \r\nconnection that exists between migration and \r\ndevelopment. That is in fact the theme of our Dialogue \r\nand one of the main conclusions of the Secretary–\r\nGeneral’s report (A/60/871). We fully share the \r\nconclusions of that report and believe that the idea to \r\nhold the High-level Dialogue on International \r\nMigration and Development is an extremely timely \r\none. \r\n In order to have an idea of how strongly Moldova \r\nis affected by the process of migration, it is enough to \r\nknow that Moldova’s dependence on remittances is the \r\nsecond highest in the world and that remittances \r\naccount for 27 per cent of our gross domestic product. \r\nOver 80 per cent of Moldova’s migrants remit funds \r\nand for more than 70 per cent of senders, those \r\nremittances constitute half of their earnings. According \r\nto our official statistics, in 2005 almost 400,000 \r\nMoldovans went to work abroad or to seek jobs. That \r\nconstitutes over 25 per cent of our total active \r\npopulation. \r\n However, migration is also a source of many \r\ndistressing problems. Today I would like to concentrate \r\non the negative aspects of international migration. \r\n The very moment we speak about migration we \r\nstart speaking about discrimination, exclusion, \r\ncriminality, illegal trafficking, smuggling and similar \r\nsubjects. The reason for that is obvious: all the \r\nphenomena I referred to are today connected to \r\ninternational migration. Migration is perceived by \r\nmany as something unlawful, bad and troublesome. \r\nThere are clear signs today that we are not coping with \r\nthe situation or with the new trends in contemporary \r\nmigration processes. Criminals rather than \r\nGovernments often control the main migratory \r\nmovements. The less we are able to develop adequate \r\npolices, frameworks and new institutions to effectively \r\naddress international migration, the more opportunities \r\nwe offer to criminals, who become rich at the expense \r\nof migrants. \r\n What do we need today? In my opinion, we need \r\na sort of rehabilitation of international migration that \r\nshould lead to the development and implementation of \r\nrelevant policies at the local, national, regional and \r\nglobal levels. We need to decriminalize migration \r\nwhile at the same time contributing to the reduction of \r\npoverty and to improving general living conditions in \r\nthe countries of origin. I believe that, while we fight \r\nagainst criminals, the best thing to do would be to \r\nexpand the channels for regular and legal migration — \r\nor, to put it in a more politically correct way, \r\ndocumented migration. That would more closely match \r\nreality. \r\n A/61/PV.6\r\n \r\n29 06-52461 \r\n \r\n The reality is that millions of people today have \r\nno choice but to migrate — in search of food, water, \r\nwork, human dignity and hope. And nobody can stop \r\nthem. There is no need to do so. What we have to do is \r\nto take those people out of the hands of criminals and \r\nhelp them — if it is really impossible to have a decent \r\nlife in their countries of origin — to arrive at their new \r\ndestinations and to integrate into their new \r\nenvironments. That would benefit everyone, migrants, \r\ncountries of origin and countries of destination. Those \r\nnew mechanisms and policies could be developed in \r\nbilateral and multilateral frameworks. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that the \r\nrights of migrants and those of the victims of \r\ntrafficking in human beings are of vital importance. We \r\nalready have some good news in that respect. For \r\nexample, the Council of Europe recently developed and \r\nopened for signature and ratification the Convention on \r\nAction against Trafficking in Human Beings. The \r\nprotection of the rights of victims is at the centre of \r\nthat Convention. We believe that to be an example of \r\ngood international cooperation and joint endeavour \r\nregarding certain aspects of the phenomenon of \r\nmigration that we should commend and build on. I \r\nhope that our High-level Dialogue will be a new and \r\npowerful start in the difficult search for adequate \r\nresponses to the political, economic and cultural \r\nchallenges arising from international migration at the \r\nglobal level. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Irakli Alasania, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of Georgia. \r\n Mr. Alasania (Georgia): The Georgian delegation \r\nwishes to welcome the High-level Dialogue on \r\nInternational Migration and Development as a much- \r\nneeded step towards placing migration issues on the \r\ninternational agenda. \r\n In today’s world of globalization and \r\ninterdependency, every country is affected to a certain \r\nextent by the various issues related to international \r\nmobility. Efficiently managed migration can be \r\nbeneficial to all — countries of origin, transit and \r\ndestination. But there are many challenges and a \r\nnumber of issues that have to be addressed urgently to \r\navoid illegal migration, trafficking, organized crime \r\nand terrorism. \r\n International migration has significantly affected \r\nGeorgia since our independence. Experts estimate that \r\nmore than 20 per cent of the country’s 1989 \r\npopulation — over 1 million people — have left \r\nGeorgia since independence. According to the \r\nSecretariat’s Population Division, Georgia was among \r\nthe top 20 countries worldwide in net emigration \r\nbetween 1995 and 2000. \r\n In the 1990s, socio-economic realities in the \r\ncountry were the leading motivation forcing thousands \r\nto travel abroad for work and education. Our citizens \r\nhave ventured to Russia, Europe, the United States and \r\nCanada for skilled and unskilled job opportunities that \r\noffer higher incomes to better support their families at \r\nhome. Conflicts in two separatist regions — Abkhazia \r\nand Tskhinvali — were other causes of migration. \r\nEthnic cleansing and mass expulsions forced tens of \r\nthousands of our citizens to flee abroad. \r\n In 2003, the Rose Revolution sparked renewed \r\nhope and serious interest among all Georgians living \r\nabroad in our country’s renewed prospects for the \r\nfuture. That provided a window of opportunity to \r\nengage our diverse and far-flung population as partners \r\nin Georgia’s development. We have already taken steps \r\nto begin that process by making it possible to hold dual \r\ncitizenship, which was granted to almost 1,400 persons \r\nin 2005. We are also increasing the outreach of the \r\nPresident and top Government officials. \r\n We hope to pursue a more comprehensive \r\nstrategy, focusing on four main areas: engaging highly \r\nskilled migrants, maximizing remittances, leveraging \r\nand protecting economic migrants and relations with \r\nthe diaspora. Experts estimate that 40 to 55 per cent of \r\nthose leaving Georgia are highly educated. They also \r\nbelieve that movement has resulted in a significant \r\nbrain drain. However, as a result of rapid economic \r\nreforms, Georgia has become a more attractive place to \r\ninvest and work, and is ripe for reaching out to our \r\nhighly skilled diaspora. While we continue to \r\nencourage return, we are also looking to explore ways \r\nto engage the highly skilled members of our diaspora \r\nwhere they are living by creating knowledge networks, \r\nengaging them in joint projects with host countries and \r\nrecruiting them to help promote investment in Georgia. \r\n Remittances are an important source of revenue \r\nfor many Georgian households, and continue to grow \r\nas a percentage of our gross domestic product. Official \r\nestimates show growth rates of 4.8 per cent in 2003 \r\nand 6.3 per cent in 2005. Most experts believe the \r\ngrowth of remittances to be two to three times greater. \r\nA/61/PV.6  \r\n \r\n06-52461 30 \r\n \r\nWe would also like to help our citizens to maximize \r\ntheir private funds by improving the banking system. \r\nWe can also provide new and innovative remittance-\r\nsending tools and products to our migrants by learning \r\nfrom the successes experienced by Latin American and \r\nAsian countries. We want to work with host countries \r\nto empower our citizens to use the banking systems in \r\nthose countries. \r\n Georgia’s working age population has shrunk due \r\nto labour migration, compounded by our slightly \r\nnegative natural population growth rate. We need to \r\noffer our citizens more legal opportunities to work \r\nabroad, protect their rights against discrimination, \r\npromote stronger entrepreneurial linkages and improve \r\nprospects for sustainable return by developing \r\nreadmission agreements and targeting business \r\ndevelopment resources to returnees. \r\n In addition to those who left recently, we believe \r\nthere are roughly 8 million non-citizen ethnic \r\nGeorgians throughout the world. They are primarily \r\nconcentrated in Turkey, Iran, Russia and Israel, as well \r\nas in other countries of the former Soviet Union. Since \r\n2004 we have made great efforts to strengthen cultural \r\nties with our diaspora around the world. \r\n As I mentioned earlier, the issue of legal \r\nopportunities to work abroad is extremely important \r\nfor Georgia. We are also focusing our national and \r\ninternational efforts on the fight against trafficking in \r\nhuman beings. For its part, the Georgian Government, \r\nwith the support of international organizations, has \r\nlaunched a very intensive programme against \r\ntrafficking. To that end, a national action plan has been \r\nadopted, in accordance with which a coordination \r\ncentre was established. \r\n We are all very well aware of the fact that \r\nnational efforts alone are not enough. Support and \r\ncooperation with partners is essential. Investment and \r\nassistance will foster sustainable development, boost \r\neconomies and protect human rights. We hope that our \r\njoint efforts, along with strong action by the \r\ninternational community, the United Nations and other \r\ninternational organizations, will help to address these \r\nproblems. We believe that our forum will be able to \r\ncome up with effective responses to those challenges. \r\n The President: I now call on Her Excellency \r\nMrs. Fekitamoeloa ‘Utoikamanu, Chairperson of the \r\ndelegation of Tonga. \r\n Mrs. ‘Utoikamanu (Tonga): May I take this \r\nopportunity to express our appreciation for the \r\nconvening of this historic High-level Dialogue on \r\nInternational Migration and Development. I would also \r\nlike to thank the Secretary-General for his report \r\n(A/60/871), which provides a comprehensive review of \r\nthe multidimensional aspects of international \r\nmigration, as well as initial thoughts on how to \r\nimprove the governance of migration. \r\n At the outset, Tonga also wishes to align itself \r\nwith the statement made by Her Excellency \r\nMs. Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, Minister of Home \r\nAffairs of South Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 \r\nand China. \r\n Pacific island countries, and my country in \r\nparticular, can date their foreign adventures as far back \r\nas the fourteenth century, before the term “irregular \r\nmigration” was introduced into our vocabulary. We \r\nhave all come a long way. Fast-forwarding to 2006, a \r\nnumber of Tongans equal to more than 100 per cent of \r\nour national population reside in three countries \r\nabroad. Tonga is categorized as a mature migration \r\nremittance economy and, as of 2005, ranks as the \r\nsecond country most dependent on remittances as a \r\npercentage of gross domestic product (GDP) —\r\ncurrently 29 per cent. \r\n In a small way, our country’s experience has \r\ndemonstrated the important nexus between \r\ninternational migration and development. A recent \r\nWorld Bank study that included the results of an \r\nempirical analysis of remittances to Tonga concluded \r\nthat recipient household migration and remittances had \r\na positive impact on migrant-sending countries, \r\nimproved income distribution, had a positive impact on \r\npoverty alleviation, brought about higher rates of \r\nsavings, stimulated business activities and resulted in \r\nlarger investments in education. \r\n The established relationship between migration \r\nand its contribution to poverty alleviation and \r\neconomic development, and the significant \r\ncontribution of remittances to development, are clear. \r\nHowever, the attention accorded to labour emigration \r\nand its positive impact on the development of sending \r\ncountries is perhaps quite limited. Overseas \r\ndevelopment assistance alone cannot address the \r\nproblems associated with small island States. As the \r\nWorld Bank study highlighted, improved and \r\nunrestricted but organized labour mobility can \r\n A/61/PV.6\r\n \r\n31 06-52461 \r\n \r\nsignificantly contribute to a country’s GDP and to \r\noverall global income. \r\n Labour mobility is a potential vehicle to achieve \r\nour commitments to pro-poor strategies such as the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and other global \r\ncommitments to achieve national sustainable \r\ndevelopment strategies. At the same time, Tonga’s \r\ndemographic profile, particularly its population \r\ngrowth, has been stabilized by emigration. But the \r\nmigration phenomenon has not been without costs, \r\nincluding social costs and human capital costs in terms \r\nof the brain drain. \r\n While stressing the importance of remittances as \r\nan important source of development financing, we \r\nview remittances as complementary and not as a \r\nsubstitute for overseas development assistance. On the \r\npressing issue of the transaction costs of remittances, \r\nTonga also welcomes support for addressing this and \r\nfor promoting conditions for cheaper, faster and safer \r\ntransfer of remittances. \r\n Tonga, like many other Pacific island countries, is \r\nnot only a sending State; it is also a transit and a \r\nreceiving State. The challenge for all of us is therefore \r\nto design a migration policy that is closest to what the \r\nSecretary-General described in his report as the best-\r\ncase scenario, where migration benefits the receiving \r\ncountry, the country of origin and migrants themselves. \r\nThat will require commitment and political will, as \r\nwell as the continuation and, where absent, the \r\nenhancement of dialogue, to be followed by specific \r\naction not only at the bilateral but also at the regional \r\nand international levels. Such forums can also address \r\nother important issues, such as irregular migration, \r\nsocial integration and access to services, as well as \r\ndevelop schemes for the temporary movement of \r\npersons that cover both skilled and unskilled workers. \r\n Tonga shares the concern for the exploitation of \r\nmigrants through mechanisms such as trafficking and \r\nmigrant smuggling. In 2005 we passed a transnational \r\ncrimes bill, which criminalizes under domestic law \r\ntrafficking in persons, trafficking in children and \r\npeople-smuggling. \r\n Tonga has also benefited from the support \r\nprovided through its bilateral contacts, as well as by \r\nregional organizations such as the Bali Process on \r\nPeople Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related \r\nTransnational Crime and the Pacific Immigration \r\nDirectors’ Conference. There is potential for the \r\nexpansion of the roles of those existing regional \r\nprocesses to deal with any new issues that may develop \r\nas a member State attempts to deal with the real and \r\ncomplex issues of migration and development. \r\n In conclusion, the High-level Dialogue is an \r\nimportant and vital step in raising awareness of the \r\ndevelopment dimension of international migration. We \r\nmust maintain momentum and agree on the formation \r\nof an appropriate consultative forum, as proposed by \r\nthe Secretary-General in his report, to maintain our \r\nfocus on international migration issues while signalling \r\nthat international migration is a normal but crucial \r\nelement in the development process. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Collin Beck, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of Solomon Islands. \r\n Mr. Beck (Solomon Islands): My delegation \r\nwould like to join others in congratulating you, \r\nMadam, on your election to preside over this important \r\ngathering.  \r\n International migration gives a human face to \r\nglobalization. It defines and represents the global \r\nstructure that divides the world between the \r\nindustrialized North and the developing South. It is \r\nimportant to note that the flow of migrants from the \r\nsouthern hemisphere to the North is due to the \r\ndemographic and social structure of the industrialized \r\nworld and the need for workers. \r\n Solomon Islands values this meeting, as it \r\nprovides an opportunity to ensure that there is a \r\nmechanism in place to measure and match the supply \r\nand demand of the global labour market, as argued by \r\nthe International Organization for Migration and by the \r\nGroup of 77. Solomon Islands attaches great \r\nimportance to this subject, as it pertains to a \r\ndevelopment opportunity that, if not well managed, can \r\nbecome a security concern, both for receiving and \r\nsending States. Migration is also an integral part of \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\n At the national level, Solomon Islands is made up \r\nof half a million people, who speak 80 different \r\nlanguages. It embraces a rich cultural diversity. Inter-\r\nisland migration is therefore an economic issue. The \r\npull factor in all migration routes, be they internal or \r\nexternal, is related to economic gain. Population \r\nmovement tends to occur in the direction of where \r\nthere is economic activity. The challenge is to balance \r\nA/61/PV.6  \r\n \r\n06-52461 32 \r\n \r\nthe participation of migrant workers and indigenous \r\npopulations. To leave anyone a spectator to \r\ndevelopment could lead to instability setting in, as \r\nrecently experienced by Solomon Islands in its ethnic \r\nconflict. In that connection, the High-level Dialogue \r\nmust take time to look at the domestic movement of \r\nlabour as well. \r\n Having said that, both internal and international \r\nmigration contribute to a country’s foreign income, not \r\nonly through remittances but also, most important, \r\nthrough the transfer of knowledge, capacity and good \r\npractices. In other words, it is a win-win situation for \r\nboth migrants and receiving countries. \r\n Within the Pacific region there are varying levels \r\nof international migrant workers. There are countries \r\nwithin the region that provide labour to developed \r\neconomies, while there are also developing countries \r\nthat acquire labour from within the subregion. Also \r\nwithin the Pacific subregion, work has already begun \r\nto explore short-term labour migration with some of \r\nour developed neighbours. While nothing concrete has \r\nyet emerged from those discussions, my delegation is \r\npleased to note that a dialogue on shared migration \r\nopportunities seeking regional concerted action has \r\nbeen put on the table. The regional discussion has \r\nallowed us to better understand the position of \r\nreceiving States, and we hope that it will allow us to \r\nwork towards striking a balance. \r\n For many of the least development countries, \r\ndevelopment has not kept pace with the growth of their \r\npopulations. Limited opportunities have been the push \r\nfactor leading local populations to migrate and seek \r\nemployment internationally. Solomon Islands, on the \r\nother hand, does not have a large migrant population. \r\nBut it does have an abundant supply of labour relative \r\nto the local employment market. A good number of our \r\nworkers are located and employed in rural areas. Urban \r\ndrift has put pressure on agriculture-based economies, \r\nbut it has not provided jobs. Therefore, the \r\nGovernment remains the largest employer in the \r\ncountry, rather than the private sector. The challenges \r\nare due to the high costs of communication and \r\ntransportation, the smallness of the market and lack of \r\nforeign-direct investors to provide the engine for \r\ngrowth needed to see the economy take off. \r\n In that respect, the Government is examining all \r\neconomic opportunities to guarantee our population a \r\nsecure future. Solomon Islands could not agree more \r\nthat there is a need to establish an adequate and \r\ntransparent mechanism, especially as regards short-\r\nterm contracts, that will ensure that workers are \r\ndocumented and legally processed, so as to avoid \r\nhaving workers working outside the system, which \r\nplaces them in a more vulnerable position. \r\n My delegation would also like to see more \r\ncoordination between all international organizations \r\nand United Nations agencies in combating human \r\ntrafficking, including the development of a common \r\nmechanism to address that. \r\n I would like to conclude by assuring you, Madam \r\nPresident, of my delegation’s ongoing support and \r\ncooperation as we seek an international solution to \r\nmigration that will ensure that all countries can benefit. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Andreas Mavroyiannis, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of Cyprus. \r\n Mr. Mavroyiannis (Cyprus): Let me begin by \r\ncongratulating you, Madam President, on having \r\nconvened this High-level Dialogue. The time could not \r\nbe more appropriate for the start of a frank and open \r\nexchange of views and ideas on this important \r\ninternational issue that affects the lives and welfare of \r\nus all, as individuals and as States. I would also like to \r\nextend our gratitude to Secretary-General Kofi Annan \r\nfor focusing high-level political attention on the many \r\nlinkages between development and migration.  \r\n Cyprus aligns itself with the statement made by \r\nthe representative of Finland on behalf of the European \r\nUnion. I would, however, like to make the following \r\nadditional comments. \r\n Mr. Majoor (Netherlands), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair. \r\n Migration is a global phenomenon as old as man \r\nitself. In the quest to find better lives and improve their \r\nstandards of living, people move across borders. \r\n As we now live in an era of increased human \r\nmobility due to technological advances, an era marked \r\nby diversity and multiculturalism, any prevailing \r\nnegative perceptions of the past must not be inhibiting \r\nfactors in dealing with this normal fact of human \r\ncivilization. In principle, migration should not be seen \r\nas a threat to or as a destabilizing factor for the \r\neconomies of recipient countries. Of course, it is a \r\nphenomenon that needs to be regulated. But, if \r\n A/61/PV.6\r\n \r\n33 06-52461 \r\n \r\nsupported by the right policies, it can be a blessing for \r\ndevelopment both in recipient countries and in \r\ncountries of origin.  \r\n Cyprus has historically been a country of \r\nemigration, exporting migrants to richer countries. In \r\nfact, it is estimated that as many Cypriots live abroad \r\nas on the island itself. The invasion of 1974 and the \r\ndisplacement of one third of our population resulted in \r\nnew waves of emigration. Many Cypriot refugees who \r\nhad lost their livelihoods sought employment abroad. \r\nSince then, Cyprus has seen extensive economic \r\ndevelopment and has become a host to migrants, who \r\ncontribute positively to the economy and its high \r\ngrowth rates. The contribution of Cypriots of the \r\ndiaspora was also crucial for the economic miracle that \r\nCyprus experienced in the 1980s.  \r\n Cyprus is firmly committed to the protection of \r\nhuman rights of all migrants and has ratified all major \r\nhuman rights instruments, including the United Nations \r\nConvention against Transnational Organized Crime and \r\nits two Protocols, and the United Nations Convention \r\nrelating to the Status of Refugees. Cyprus is also in the \r\nprocess of ratifying the United Nations Convention on \r\nthe Reduction of Statelessness. Our immigration and \r\nrefugee laws have been harmonized with the relevant \r\nEuropean laws and are implemented according to \r\nEuropean Union policies and practices in this field.  \r\n The report of the Secretary-General (A/60/871) \r\nprovides an in-depth study of the issue of international \r\nmigration and development and contains a plethora of \r\nsuggestions and ideas that merit further discussion and \r\nelaboration. Notable recommendations are also \r\ncontained in the report of the Global Commission on \r\nInternational Migration. Concerning the \r\nrecommendation of the Secretary-General that a global \r\nforum be established, the position of the European \r\nUnion has been presented by the Finnish presidency; \r\nCyprus welcomes Belgium’s offer to host the forum’s \r\nfirst meeting. \r\n Cyprus is fully committed to cooperate with all \r\nrelevant actors at the national, regional and \r\ninternational level and through the common policies of \r\nthe European Union for the enhancement of the benefit \r\nof migration to development, and to fully play its part \r\nin the process that is now being initiated.  \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Dusan Bella, Chairman of the \r\ndelegation of Slovakia.  \r\n Mr. Bella (Slovakia): Especially at the beginning \r\nof twentieth century, my small country produced \r\nthousands upon thousands of migrants bound \r\nparticularly for the United States of America, and I \r\nhave to say that this still affects my country’s social \r\nconsciousness. \r\n Slovakia welcomes the organization of this High-\r\nlevel Dialogue, as migration is increasingly becoming \r\nan integral part of global processes, bringing both \r\nconcerns and challenges — not only to migrants, but \r\nalso to countries of origin, transit and destination. This \r\nfact is supported by the latest Transatlantic Trends \r\nsurvey of United States and European public opinion. \r\nAccording to those findings, 79 per cent of Americans \r\nand 76 per cent of Europeans agree that large numbers \r\nof immigrants coming into their respective countries \r\nconstitute an important threat. \r\n Slovakia, lying on the east-west migratory route \r\nin Europe, has not had to deal with an excessive influx \r\nof migrants so far. Nonetheless, Slovakia, as a smaller \r\nEuropean Union (EU) country, is involved in \r\nformulating EU migration policies and therefore fully \r\nsupports the joint EU position presented at this High-\r\nlevel Dialogue, the European Union Global Approach \r\nto Migration adopted in December 2005, and \r\ninstruments and policy guidelines contained in the so-\r\ncalled Hague programme. That programme sets forth, \r\ninter alia, the European Union objective of creating a \r\ncommon European asylum system. From our own \r\nexperience, we can provide evidence that misuse of \r\nasylum procedures is still a frequent and widespread \r\nphenomenon. To facilitate the integration of migrants \r\nin Slovakia, we are working on a set of guidelines for \r\nan integration policy for migrants, which will cover all \r\nmigrant groups and all aspects of their work and life in \r\nour country. \r\n We consider negotiations on readmission \r\nagreements at the European Union level to be a big \r\nstep forward in the management of migration flows and \r\nin the effort to eliminate illegal migration. \r\n Last year, the Slovak Government adopted a set \r\nof migration policy guidelines which created \r\npreconditions for the implementation of effective \r\npolicies and measures in the areas that are being \r\ndiscussed at this forum. Those policy guidelines aim to \r\nimprove coordination among various Slovak \r\ninstitutions involved in the management of the \r\nmigration process. One of the goals set out in the \r\nA/61/PV.6  \r\n \r\n06-52461 34 \r\n \r\nguidelines is the establishment of an immigration and \r\nnaturalization office before 2010. \r\n Slovakia supports the strengthening of \r\ninternational dialogue and cooperation on migration \r\nissues, but at the same time we share the opinion that \r\nthere is still room for better use of existing institutions \r\nand activities. Of course, any new initiative is welcome \r\nas long as it has potential for success and brings new \r\nadded value to work already done in various \r\ninternational forums. \r\n Slovakia reaffirms the need to fully implement \r\nthe United Nations conventions that fight all sources of \r\nintolerance, encourage cultural variety and focus on \r\nfostering human rights, mutual respect and \r\nunderstanding among civilizations. In this context, I \r\nam pleased to inform the Assembly that the Slovak \r\nGovernment has approved an action plan on preventing \r\nall forms of discrimination, racism, xenophobia, anti-\r\nSemitism and other signs of intolerance. \r\n We are convinced that the management of \r\nmigration is the common responsibility of all countries \r\ninvolved. Therefore, we engage in dialogue on \r\nmigration with various countries and regions in the \r\nworld. But at the same time, our cooperation is \r\npredominantly with our neighbours with the aim of \r\ncreating conditions for the better management of \r\nmigration flows and the smooth extension of the \r\nSchengen area by the end of next year. \r\n The Slovak Republic shares the view that \r\nmigration and development are two inseparable \r\nagendas. The activities of the United Nations, the \r\nEuropean Union and other organizations should be \r\ncarried out along coordinated lines in order to achieve \r\nthe best possible results.  \r\n The misuse of asylum systems has been a major \r\nsource of illegal migration; this phenomenon deserves \r\ninternational attention. Better management of \r\nmigration processes would bring about a decrease in \r\nunfounded asylum claims, and genuine refugees would \r\nthen enjoy better protection and accelerated asylum \r\nprocedures. In addition, we think that more attention \r\nneeds to be drawn to the possibility that suspects \r\ninvolved in terrorist activities could misuse asylum \r\nprocedures.  \r\n Slovakia believes that this Dialogue can be \r\ninstrumental in identifying inconsistencies in existing \r\nmigration and development policies while contributing \r\nsignificantly to the building of partnerships among \r\ncountries of origin, transit and destination. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nMr. Ismael Abraão Gaspar Martins, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of Angola. \r\n Mr. Gaspar Martins (Angola): First of all, allow \r\nme to join others in extending to Ms. Al-Khalifa my \r\ndelegation’s congratulations on her election as \r\nPresident of the sixty-first session of the General \r\nAssembly. We associate ourselves with the statement \r\ndelivered by the Minister of Home Affairs of South \r\nAfrica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. \r\n Responding to the President’s appeal, I shall \r\ndeliver a summary version of my statement and shall \r\ncirculate copies of the full text. \r\n Globalization has created an important \r\npartnership among the countries of the world, but it has \r\nalso widened the gap between rich and poor, not to \r\nmention the economic disparities between countries \r\nand whole regions. That situation, together with other \r\ndifficulties, such as wars, the deterioration of the \r\nenvironment and geopolitical transformations, forces \r\nan increasing number of people to leave their homes. \r\nThat reality requires a comprehensive approach that \r\ntakes into account not only the causes of, but also the \r\ncomplex relationship between migration and economic \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Angola recognizes the high importance of \r\ninternational migration to the development agenda of \r\nthe United Nations. Thus, we thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his comprehensive report on international \r\nmigration, contained in document A/60/871, which \r\nprovides us with useful information on recent \r\ndevelopments in international migration, and in \r\nparticular very revealing statistics on the growing role \r\nof migration as a contribution to economic growth and \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Given the recommendations of the international \r\ncommunity, my country is concerned about the related \r\ncriminality that afflicts many States. The Republic of \r\nAngola is fully immersed in the process of adhering to \r\nthe United Nations Convention against Transnational \r\nOrganized Crime, particularly in relation to the illicit \r\ntraffic of migrants by land, sea and air and to the \r\nprevention and punishment of human trafficking, \r\nespecially of women and children, and we are therefore \r\nengaged in the fight against targeted crimes. \r\n A/61/PV.6\r\n \r\n35 06-52461 \r\n \r\n In conclusion, we agree with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that this High-level Dialogue should be seen \r\nnot only as an end in itself, but also as part of a process \r\nthat will continue to be carefully analyzed in all the \r\nmultidimensional aspects of migration and \r\ndevelopment. We in Angola have the political will to \r\nplay our part towards making the recommendations and \r\nconclusions of this High-level Dialogue an important \r\ncontribution to development. Let us seize this \r\nopportunity to strengthen the Dialogue, thus making \r\nmigration a positive force in common development and \r\nthe fight against poverty. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Johan Verbeke, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of Belgium. \r\n Mr. Verbeke (Belgium) (spoke in French): I \r\nwould like first to thank and congratulate the \r\nSecretary-General for having taken the initiative to \r\norganize this Dialogue and his Special Representative \r\nfor having prepared it so well. \r\n This initiative testifies to vision and courage. \r\nIndeed, nobody could have foreseen in 2003, when the \r\ndecision to convene this Dialogue was taken, that only \r\nthree years later migration would be at the heart of the \r\npolicy concerns of all the members of the international \r\ncommunity, migratory flows having grown not only in \r\nthe North-South direction, but also in the South-South \r\ndirection.  \r\n The debates organized by the Global Commission \r\non International Migration and the regional \r\nconsultations that took place from 2003 to 2005 were \r\nan important catalyst for carrying the debate to a \r\npolitical level. We have a common interest in \r\nidentifying a global and balanced approach by taking \r\nthe multiple dimensions of migration into account.  \r\n We need to install a coherent set of short-, \r\nmiddle- and long-term actions and policies. In the short \r\nterm, we need to make greater efforts to discourage \r\nillegal migration by disseminating objective \r\ninformation on and increased awareness of the risks of \r\nhuman trafficking that are inherent to irregular \r\nmigration. That dissuasion also needs to take place by \r\nmeans of increased border control, the negotiation of \r\nreadmission agreements, and above all by the fight \r\nagainst human trafficking networks. \r\n In the medium term, we need to better \r\nincorporate the migration dimension into our \r\ncooperation policies. That means we must further \r\npromote an environment conducive to development in \r\nthe countries of origin and consider how migration can \r\ncontribute to the realization of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and how it can be included in \r\npoverty reduction programmes. \r\n In the long term, we must make international \r\nmigration, trade and agriculture policies more coherent \r\nwith our development goals. \r\n The conference that Belgium organized in March \r\nin Brussels, in collaboration with the International \r\nOrganization for Migration, the World Bank and the \r\nEuropean Commission, and which was attended by \r\nmany present here today, shed light on those questions \r\nand has helped us to outline some responses. It \r\nhighlighted the valuable role that the diaspora \r\ncommunities can play in favour of their country of \r\norigin. \r\n Another truism that was reiterated in Brussels — \r\nmany truisms need to be hammered home — is that we \r\nwill achieve nothing if we do not treat migratory \r\nphenomena in a spirit of partnership among all the \r\ncountries involved. \r\n Once this High-level Dialogue is over, there are \r\nsome priorities on which we should continue to work. \r\nThe first priority field is data collection. We cannot \r\ndevelop credible policies without more reliable data on \r\nmigratory flows.  \r\n Secondly, we should examine the consequences \r\nof globalization on the job market and ensure a better \r\nbalance between supply and demand.  \r\n Thirdly, the contribution of migration to the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, and especially the \r\nrole of migrant communities that generate transfers not \r\nonly by means of social contributions, but also in the \r\ncultural, financial and economic fields, should also be \r\nstudied.  \r\n Fourthly, over and above transfers is the question \r\nof the voluntary return of persons. The investigations \r\nof the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and \r\nDevelopment have shown that, to date, some of our co-\r\ndevelopment policies, while objectively praiseworthy, \r\nhave not really succeeded in turning those returns into \r\ndevelopment opportunities. Together, we need to \r\nredefine co-development as a genuine approach to \r\ndevelopment. Belgium also proposes in that respect the \r\nA/61/PV.6  \r\n \r\n06-52461 36 \r\n \r\ncreation of a co-development fund at the European \r\nlevel. \r\n Fifthly and lastly, the contribution of migrants in \r\ntheir countries of destination should also be optimized. \r\nThat raises the question of the integration and rights of \r\nmigrants. We are all aware of the fact that this is a vast \r\nprogramme which will not be achieved unless the \r\ninternational community and all its participants take \r\naction. In that regard, we welcome the fact that the \r\nSecretary-General and his Special Representative have \r\nproposed the establishment of a permanent process of \r\ndialogue and cooperation in the form of a global forum \r\nfor migration and development. \r\n Belgium is ready to host the first such forum next \r\nyear in Brussels and we thank those delegations that \r\nhave shown their confidence in Belgium. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHer Excellency Ms. Rosemary Banks, chairperson of \r\nthe delegation of New Zealand. \r\n Ms. Banks (New Zealand): New Zealand \r\nwelcomes the opportunity to participate in this \r\nexchange on international migration and development. \r\nWe recognize that immigration issues and their impact \r\nrequire a long-term strategic dialogue.  \r\n The short-term migration of workers has \r\nsignificant development potential and can benefit both \r\norigin and destination countries by helping meet labour \r\nmarket demand and providing remittance flows and the \r\npotential for skill development and knowledge transfer, \r\nwhile enabling migrants to return home.  \r\n Although there are benefits from labour flows, \r\nthere are also a number of economic and social risks to \r\nthe sending country, which have already been well \r\ndescribed by other speakers. \r\n At this late hour, I would like to touch very \r\nbriefly on New Zealand’s immigration programme, \r\nlabour mobility in the South Pacific region, and the \r\nway we see the future of this Dialogue. \r\n New Zealand is in the midst of the biggest \r\noverhaul of immigration legislation in 20 years. We \r\nhave recently undertaken a wide consultative process \r\non these changes. We currently face critical skill \r\nshortages in key areas of industry. Immigration for us \r\nis vital. \r\n Positive settlement outcomes for new migrants, \r\nalong with robust border security, are priorities within \r\nour immigration change programme. This programme \r\nalready includes a highly successful settlement \r\nstrategy, which acknowledges that migration is an end-\r\nto-end process and that productivity comes best \r\nthrough successful settlement for migrants. \r\n While New Zealand’s main focus is on attracting \r\nskilled labour, we are, at the same time, a developed \r\ncountry located in the South Pacific. As part of our \r\nPacific region, New Zealand recognizes that there must \r\nbe opportunities for Pacific Islanders, skilled and \r\nunskilled, to access permanent employment in New \r\nZealand. In addition to the mainstream immigration \r\npolicy options, we have two dedicated permanent \r\nimmigration schemes: the Samoan Quota (for Samoan \r\nnationals) and the Pacific Access Category (for \r\nnationals of Tonga, Fiji, Tuvalu and Kiribati). \r\n New Zealand believes that open dialogue among \r\ncountries is an effective way of addressing global \r\nmigration issues. That has been demonstrated in \r\nregional processes like the Bali Process on People \r\nSmuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related \r\nTransnational Crime. \r\n Looking to the future and to the way this High-\r\nlevel Dialogue is taken forward, New Zealand would \r\nbe cautious about establishing a new global forum on \r\nmigration. We think that the avenue to address \r\nmigration issues already exists in various structures. \r\nAny new forum that may be agreed should not \r\nduplicate existing forums and should have the potential \r\nto add value to the existing debates. New Zealand \r\nbelieves that if there is a consensus to establish an \r\ninformal forum it should be voluntary and driven by \r\nStates. It should build on the work of regional forums \r\nand allow for consultation and the exchange of good \r\npractices. It should not lead to negotiated outcomes. \r\n In closing, we would like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his thought-provoking report (A/60/871), \r\nand all the delegations who have contributed to this \r\nDialogue. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Ms. Sohail Hernández, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. \r\n Ms. Hernández (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): The Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela welcomes the opportunity of \r\nthis High-level Dialogue on International Migration \r\nand Development as a favourable opportunity to \r\n A/61/PV.6\r\n \r\n37 06-52461 \r\n \r\ndiscuss, on a broad basis, the multidimensional \r\nelements of international migration, including the \r\ngender perspective, cultural diversity and full respect \r\nfor human rights. \r\n The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has \r\ninsisted in various forums that migration is a topic that \r\nshould be tackled from a comprehensive perspective \r\nthat focuses on the social content of the topic itself \r\nbecause, above all, we believe that the origin of the \r\nproblems involved is to be found in the growing \r\nimbalance between developing and developed \r\ncountries, given the prevailing economic system. That \r\nis why we believe that, at the national level, we have to \r\nemphasize the following elements — rejection of \r\ndiscrimination on grounds of race, sex, creed, \r\nnationality or legal status; respect for diversity, since \r\nour society is multi-ethnic and pluricultural; \r\norientation towards priority areas of national \r\ndevelopment; full respect for the human rights of the \r\nmigrant worker and his or her family, including labour \r\nrights, the right to social security and education, inter \r\nalia; a migrant policy based on the principles of \r\ntolerance, solidarity, gender equality, justice and social \r\nequity; and respect for signed and ratified treaties and \r\ninternational conventions.  \r\n Similarly, the Constitution of the Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela, in its Title III on duties, human \r\nrights and guarantees, provides for coverage of the \r\nsocial needs of all persons, whether nationals or \r\nforeigners, as reflected in the recent enactment of a \r\nseries of legal instruments. Among those instruments, I \r\nwould mention in particular, the Aliens and Migration \r\nAct, adopted in May 2004, the regulations to regularize \r\nand naturalize foreigners of February 2004, and the \r\nOrganic Law on the Social Security system of \r\nDecember 2002.  \r\n In addition, the Ministry of Labour and Social \r\nSecurity of Venezuela has developed a series of \r\nadministrative mechanisms that we would like to bring \r\nto the attention of the Assembly, including: the \r\nimplementation of an automated system to issue work \r\npermits for foreign workers; the implementation of a \r\nsystem linked to the computer systems of a national \r\nnetwork of employment agencies; the creation of an \r\nautomated mainframe database; the decentralization of \r\nthe labour and migration services towards the \r\nemployment agency network; and the updating and \r\nsimplification of mechanisms and procedures for \r\ncontrolling migrant flows. \r\n As regards protecting and defending the human \r\nrights of migrants, the national Government has taken a \r\nnumber of measures to promote human rights. Among \r\nthem, I would highlight the national campaign on the \r\nrights and duties of migrant workers and their families \r\nin Venezuela, undertaken by the Ministry of Labour \r\nand Social Security, and the national campaign to \r\nprevent trafficking in human beings promoted by the \r\nMinistry of the Interior and Justice. In addition, in \r\nAugust 2006, we drew up a national plan of action to \r\nprevent, suppress and punish trafficking in human \r\nbeings in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. To \r\ndemonstrate the national Government’s commitment to \r\ncombating trafficking in humans, we organized a \r\nmeeting of national authorities dealing with human \r\ntrafficking under the auspices of the Organization of \r\nAmerican States (OAS). That meeting was the first of \r\nits type held in the American hemisphere. It provided \r\nan opportunity for exchange of information and \r\nexperience, political dialogue and cooperation among \r\norigin, transit and recipient countries on the subject of \r\nhuman trafficking, having due regard to the principle \r\nof co-responsibility among countries of origin, transit \r\nand destination, and with human rights as the central \r\nfocus. \r\n With respect to remittances, Venezuela believes \r\nthat policies must be crafted and coordinated to reduce \r\nthe difficulties involved in transferring remittances. It \r\nis also important to study the possibility of facilitating \r\nthe creation of family microenterprises to help the \r\nfamilies of migrant workers. However, we believe that \r\nremittances cannot and should not become the basis for \r\ndevelopment policies. We cannot forget that \r\nremittances are private transfers and that they cannot at \r\nany point be considered to be or substitute for Official \r\nDevelopment Assistance. \r\n Another problem that countries of origin should \r\ntackle is the problem of qualified and highly qualified \r\nmigration. In that regard, we should study the \r\npossibility of implementing policies and mechanisms \r\nthat stimulate the return of migrants and enable them to \r\nreintegrate more easily into their country of origin, \r\nthereby avoiding brain drain.  \r\n The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela considers \r\nthat cooperation among Member States, whether \r\nbilateral, regional or multilateral, is crucial if we are to \r\nimprove our management of the phenomenon of \r\ninternational migration.  \r\nA/61/PV.6  \r\n \r\n06-52461 38 \r\n \r\n As regards the Secretary-General’s proposal to \r\nset up an intergovernmental consultative forum, \r\nVenezuela considers that that suggestion would mean \r\ncreating a mechanism for far-reaching reflection on \r\nmigration issues, but without binding decisions, which \r\nwould enable our countries to engage in a dynamic and \r\nfruitful exchange of experience.  \r\n At the same time, we have to join forces to \r\nenhance the work that several bodies dealing with the \r\nsubject of migration have been carrying out in recent \r\nyears, and thus arrive at a more coherent approach. \r\n Finally, we would like the conclusions of the \r\nHigh-level Dialogue to take into consideration progress \r\nachieved in migration issues in the South American \r\narea. We hope that the outcome of this Dialogue will \r\ntruly be implemented to benefit migrants themselves. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Madhu Raman Acharya, chairman \r\nof the delegation of Nepal. \r\n Mr. Acharya (Nepal): Migration is one of the \r\nless understood and little discussed matters among \r\nissues associated with globalization. Its potential \r\nbenefits, including its contribution to development, \r\nhave yet to be fully understood. \r\n Nepal’s national experience also suggests that the \r\nimpact of migration on development is not yet clear, \r\nthough there is some positive correlation between the \r\ntwo. For instance, remittances generated by the \r\nNepalese workers abroad now account for 11.7 per cent \r\nof gross domestic product, and have thus been among \r\nthe factors that have contributed to the reduction of \r\nextreme poverty and unemployment. \r\n International migration occurs because of push \r\nfactors, such as poverty, and pull factors, such as the \r\nattraction to a better and productive life abroad. In \r\nother words, underdevelopment produces conditions \r\nfor migration. \r\n Mr. Tidjani (Cameroon), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n If properly managed, migration can become a \r\npositive force in the world economy. If no active policy \r\nchoices are made, it can lead to chaos, confusion and \r\nconflicts. Therefore, we must start a dialogue to allow \r\nfreer access of migrant workers to the economies of \r\ndeveloped countries. After all, human labour is just \r\nanother factor of production and should be allowed to \r\nmove freely just as capital, goods and services are \r\nallowed to do in the context of liberal trade and open \r\neconomic policies. \r\n Despite the positive contribution migrant workers \r\nmake in the economies of countries of origin and \r\nreceiving countries, they are mostly discounted as a \r\nburden to the economic and social system of receiving \r\ncountries and a drain on the talent of sending countries. \r\n Many migrant workers are exploited by \r\nunscrupulous intermediaries or employers. They are \r\nsometimes subject to discrimination in host societies, \r\nand in some cases, they are denied the rights they are \r\nentitled to under international conventions. Thus, there \r\nis a need to strengthen the regime for protection of the \r\nrights of migrants in all situations. \r\n Many developed labour markets seek skilled \r\nmigrant workers. When the few skilled people \r\navailable in poorer countries leave for jobs overseas, \r\ndevelopment falls behind, thus creating conditions for \r\nmore emigration. \r\n Lately, the remittance has emerged as an \r\ninnovative source of private household financing, but it \r\ncan in no way be a substitute for official development \r\nassistance or for debt relief. The vulnerability of the \r\nmigrant sector does not allow countries to become \r\ndependent on it as a source of revenue. \r\n International policies and trade regimes, anti-\r\nhuman trafficking laws, immigration practices and \r\nprovisions on security and terrorism have \r\novershadowed the potential benefits of migration. We \r\ncan achieve many of the objectives of these policies \r\nthrough better management of migration without \r\ncreating hurdles to genuine migrant workers. We need \r\nto engage all relevant stakeholders, including migrants \r\nthemselves, in an international framework of \r\ncooperation for achieving the full potential of \r\nmigration as a driving force for development. \r\n Sadly, this global dialogue on migration has been \r\ntoo little too late. It is marred with conflicting interests \r\nand interpretations. We need to come up with win-win \r\nsolutions for both countries of origin and host \r\ncountries, as well as for migrants themselves. \r\n Like most other global issues, utilization of \r\nmigration for its potential contribution to development \r\nrequires a shared global responsibility, which has been \r\none of the cardinal principles of cooperation in our \r\ntimes. We should endeavour to develop a global \r\n A/61/PV.6\r\n \r\n39 06-52461 \r\n \r\ncompact for migration and development with shared \r\ncommitments, specifically for opening up labour \r\nmarkets and adopting target migrant worker quotas, \r\nand shared responsibilities between migrants’ countries \r\nof origin and countries of destination. Most \r\nimportantly, we should institute a multilateral \r\nmechanism for dialogue to facilitate the better use of \r\nmigration as a tool for development.  \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Hjálmar \r\nHannesson, chairman of the delegation of Iceland. \r\n Mr. Hannesson (Iceland): We thank the \r\nSecretary General for his comprehensive and \r\nenlightening report and the emphasis he has placed on \r\nthis important and highly relevant matter for the United \r\nNations. We also welcome the organization of this \r\nHigh-level Dialogue and the efforts of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to put the issue of migration on the global \r\nagenda. \r\n The report highlights the fact that a new era of \r\nmass international migration has recently begun. \r\nIceland is acutely aware of this. Only 10 years ago, \r\nIceland was one of the most homogeneous societies in \r\nthe world. Today, the portion of our labour market \r\noccupied by immigrants is higher than that of most of \r\nour neighbours. \r\n International migration can contribute in a \r\npositive manner to development and economic growth, \r\nif appropriately regulated and controlled. But if we are \r\nto reduce the negative effects on the migrants \r\nthemselves, we must recognize the need to promote \r\nand protect their human rights. \r\n Gender equality perspectives are highly important \r\nin migration, because gender inequality can be both the \r\ncause and the consequence of international migration. \r\nPromotion of gender equality will, therefore, help to \r\nreduce migration’s negative impact. \r\n I would like to highlight the fact mentioned in the \r\nreport that cross-border movements of persons have \r\nbecome the main vehicle for greater participation by \r\nwomen in the export of services in developing \r\ncountries, which is a positive side of increased \r\ninternational trade in services. The downside of it, \r\nhowever, is that the flexibility of labour can lead to \r\nloss of formal contracts, social security and other \r\nsocial benefits. \r\n It is worrying that current trends in women’s \r\nemployment are headed in the wrong direction, with \r\nlower wages and deterioration in the terms and \r\nconditions of employment. One of the reasons is that \r\nwomen are more likely to find employment in the \r\ninformal economy than are men. \r\n Another challenge that is closely linked to \r\nmigration is the rapid growth of human trafficking and \r\nsmuggling. Attempts have been made to use Iceland as \r\na country of transit on the route over the Atlantic, and \r\nmy authorities have taken steps accordingly. \r\nTrafficking in human beings is a global problem, and \r\nas such needs to be dealt with by the international \r\ncommunity as well as at the national level. Iceland has \r\nsigned the United Nations Convention against \r\nTransnational Organized Crime and the Protocol to \r\nPrevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, \r\nEspecially Women and Children, and we have \r\nemphasized the role of regional institutions in \r\ncombating trafficking in human beings. We have also \r\ncontributed actively to the anti-trafficking work of the \r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. \r\n The fight against trafficking in human beings \r\nshould be a priority for all, as most States are affected, \r\neither as countries of origin, countries of transit or \r\ncountries of destination. It remains one of Iceland’s \r\npriorities, and we have put considerable effort into \r\nraising public awareness on what such trafficking \r\ninvolves. \r\n To conclude, I would like to state that I am \r\ncertain that this High-level Dialogue will provide us \r\nwith a better understanding of all aspects of migration \r\nand development. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Javad Amin Mansour, \r\nchairman of the delegation of the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran. \r\n Mr. Mansour (Islamic Republic of Iran): At the \r\noutset, allow me to congratulate Ms. Rashed \r\nAl-Khalifa on her election as President of the United \r\nNations General Assembly at its sixty-first session, \r\nincluding the High-level Dialogue on International \r\nMigration and Development. I am confident that, under \r\nher leadership, this gathering will be successful in its \r\ndeliberations. \r\n Before making my remarks, upon instruction \r\nfrom the capital, I have to express my Government’s \r\nA/61/PV.6  \r\n \r\n06-52461 40 \r\n \r\nregrets that the Iranian Minister of the Interior was \r\nunable to participate in this High-level Dialogue owing \r\nto the failure of the host country to issue an entry visa. \r\n Now I will make my statement. \r\n Although international migration occurs \r\nessentially as a result of decisions taken by individuals \r\nand families, it affects the relationship with the States \r\nconcerned. International migration, due to its ever-\r\nincreasing growth in terms of scale, scope and \r\ncomplexity, has become a phenomenon with global \r\naspects. It poses new challenges that should be \r\naddressed appropriately and holistically. In addition, \r\nthe undeniable inter-linkage between migration and \r\ndevelopment highlights the need to address the issue, \r\nbearing in mind its undeniable impact on the process of \r\ndevelopment of all countries of origin, transit and \r\ndestination. \r\n It goes without saying that the ongoing \r\nnegotiations on migration should be aimed at \r\nminimizing its negative consequences and maximizing \r\nits benefits for all countries involved, as well as for the \r\nmigrants themselves. In addressing this issue, a \r\nrealistic and global vision is needed. One cannot and \r\nshould not fail to consider the root causes of \r\ninternational migration. \r\n Globalization, and its consequent strengthening \r\nof communication and increase in public awareness, \r\nhave inevitably given rise to expectations and \r\nmovements of people around the globe. Poverty, social \r\nexclusion, unemployment, lack of adequate \r\ninvestments, imbalances and inequalities in the \r\ninternational trading system, uncontrolled population \r\ngrowth, violence, discrimination and a wide gap in \r\nterms of well-being and development between \r\ndeveloped and developing countries are among some of \r\nthe other factors that affect migration. \r\n An increasing number of female migrants and \r\nother vulnerable social groups, as well as the high risk \r\ninherent in the movement of such groups, add to the \r\nalready complex aspects and deserve the international \r\ncommunity’s further attention. \r\n It should be taken into account that almost all \r\ncountries in the world face migration phenomena and \r\nfall in the categories of origin, destination and/or \r\ntransit. Besides, migration is not just a South-South \r\nissue; it also occurs in the countries of the South. It is \r\nobvious that individual countries without bilateral, \r\nregional or international cooperation will not be able to \r\nmanage this phenomenon appropriately or move in the \r\nright direction. \r\n While struggling to address the issue of \r\ninternational migration, in order to minimize the \r\nnegative consequences and maximize benefits for all, it \r\nshould also be seen within the context of \r\ninternationally agreed development goals, including \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In other \r\nwords, we need to address migration and development \r\nwith a view to achieving the MDGs. The full \r\nparticipation and engagement of all countries in \r\nnegotiations, in a transparent and constructive manner, \r\nwill contribute to the achievement of fruitful results. \r\n Another requirement that should be taken into \r\naccount during the negotiations is the appropriate \r\nmanagement of migration at the national, regional and \r\ninternational levels. Building national capacities, \r\nparticularly in developing countries, by establishing \r\nthe necessary infrastructures; creating or modifying \r\nrelevant legal regimes in a coordinated and coherent \r\nmanner; formulating national strategies on migration; \r\nexchanging information, experience and best practices; \r\nand allocating adequate resources to such measures \r\nwill help the international community meet the new \r\nchallenges posed by migration. \r\n Undoubtedly, migrants play an important role in \r\nthe process of development in all countries. Migrants \r\nin general, and skilled and highly educated migrants in \r\nparticular, contribute effectively to the process of \r\ndevelopment in destination countries. Likewise, the \r\ntransfer of technical knowledge and capital to the \r\ncountries of origin by migrants is effective in the \r\ndevelopment of those countries. Therefore, the removal \r\nof obstacles that migrants face in the transfer of \r\nknowledge and expertise in destination countries, \r\nfacilitating and lowering the cost of remittance \r\ntransfers, and enhancing their safety are determinant in \r\nthe process of development. \r\n Being of a country of origin, transit and \r\ndestination, and while suffering greatly from the \r\nnegative consequences of migration, my Government \r\nattaches great importance to the ongoing negotiations \r\nand cooperation at all levels. Iran, which is located in a \r\nstrategic area linking the Persian Gulf to Central Asia \r\nand South Asia to Mediterranean countries, can \r\nplay a key in regional cooperation on migration. I \r\nshould like to highlight here some measures that my \r\n A/61/PV.6\r\n \r\n41 06-52461 \r\n \r\ncountry has resorted to in order to address the question \r\nof migration. \r\n With the cooperation of the International \r\nOrganization for Migration, Iran has embarked on \r\nenhancing national capacity in dealing with migration. \r\nA new law, entitled “Combating human trafficking”, \r\nwas adopted by the Iranian Parliament in July 2004. A \r\nnational cooperation mechanism has been set up in the \r\nIranian Interior Ministry, composed of the \r\nrepresentatives of all relevant ministries. At the \r\nregional level, Iran participated in the quadripartite \r\nministerial meeting on fighting illegal migration and \r\ntrafficking in persons, held between Greece, Iran, \r\nPakistan and Turkey in Athens in December 2005.  \r\n In conclusion, launching the initiative of a \r\ntrilateral dialogue on migration management among \r\nIran, Afghanistan and Pakistan is another step we have \r\ntaken in the region for further cooperation among the \r\ncountries involved. With the implementation of further \r\nprojects in the region aimed at sharing expertise and \r\nknow-how and enhancing capacity on migration, \r\ncountries will be able to improve their understanding \r\nof migration and migration management. I reiterate \r\nthat strengthening regional cooperation is a key to \r\nsuccess for international efforts and cooperation. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Aboubacar Diallo, \r\nchairman of the delegation of Guinea. \r\n Mr. Diallo (Guinea) (spoke in French): It is a \r\ngreat pleasure and privilege for the delegation that I \r\nhave the honour to lead to take the floor at the High-\r\nlevel Dialogue that brings us together here and the \r\nimportance of which is clear to us all. \r\n I should like in particular to pay tribute to the \r\nSecretary-General, whose daily, persistent efforts help \r\nus to achieve our common vision of the world. The \r\ninitiative to organize this meeting and the report which \r\nhe has submitted demonstrate the far-sightedness and \r\nlucidity with which he approaches this critical issue. \r\nMy delegation fully approves the report’s diagnoses \r\nand the proposed measures it contains. \r\n My delegation aligns itself with the statement \r\nmade by the representative of South Africa on behalf of \r\nthe Group of 77 and China. \r\n In adopting the Millennium Development Goals, \r\nthe United Nations set itself the difficult task of \r\nmeeting many challenges, the nature and purpose of \r\nwhich require determined efforts on our part to do \r\nmore to establish the basis for a genuine development \r\ncooperation policy. Among those challenges, the \r\nproblem of international migration and development is \r\nundoubtedly a priority. \r\n Today more than ever before, the immense \r\nopportunities opened by globalization, migration and \r\nthe growth of information and communication \r\ntechnologies unite hundreds of millions of people \r\nthroughout the global village in a common fate. Those \r\nfar-reaching global changes require us to seek together \r\nadequate responses to the many challenges we face. We \r\nmust also bear in mind the no less complex underlying \r\nchallenges. \r\n In that context, it is clear that only active, \r\nrealistic and pragmatic solidarity that integrates the \r\nneeds of development, security and international \r\ncooperation will furnish a long-term solution to the \r\ncontrol and management of migratory flows. We are \r\nconvinced that, through this High-level Dialogue, we \r\nmust contribute to establishing, progressively and in \r\nthe common interests of the countries of origin, transit \r\nand destination, an innovative and effective partnership \r\nto incorporate the following elements seamlessly into \r\ndevelopment policies and programmes: enhanced \r\nnational capacity-building and migration policies; the \r\nessential elements for international standards on \r\ninternational migration; the involvement and \r\nparticipation of international organizations, the private \r\nsector and civil society in this debate; enhanced \r\ncooperation and coordination of efforts between the \r\nUnited Nations, the High Commissioner for Refugees \r\nand the International Organization for Migration in \r\norder to establish appropriate machinery to improve the \r\ncoherence and interactivity of international migration \r\nand development; and exploring and enhancing the \r\npotential for the development of diasporas. \r\n Member States must ensure in particular that \r\nmigration follows a legal path. They must protect the \r\nrights of migrants and prevent their exploitation, \r\nparticularly the vulnerable among them, and counteract \r\ncrimes related to the illicit trafficking of migrants and \r\nthe trade in persons.  \r\n Governments must reassert their commitment to \r\nmeeting those objectives. In order to do so, they must \r\nestablish a strategy based on co-development. In that \r\nvein, we must explore and develop the potential of \r\nnational diasporas as engines of and added value for \r\nA/61/PV.6  \r\n \r\n06-52461 42 \r\n \r\ndevelopment and cooperation efforts. In many ways, \r\nmy delegation sees this as an opportunity for \r\ninnovative thinking and a promising prospect that must \r\nbe taken into account in poverty reduction strategies \r\nand in our countries’ development policies and \r\nprogrammes. Despite the international commitments to \r\nincreasing the level and quality of official development \r\nassistance, it is increasingly clear that it will never be \r\nsufficient to meet the Millennium Development Goals \r\nby 2015, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.  \r\n Today, new mechanisms to mobilize resources for \r\ndevelopment financing are indispensable to \r\ncomplement official development assistance. In that \r\nrespect, it is clearer than ever that the resources \r\nmonopolized by co-development and decentralized \r\ncooperation often exceed official development \r\nassistance. Given that fact, the Government of Guinea \r\nhas established innovative financing mechanisms, \r\nparticularly by mobilizing resources monopolized by \r\nco-development and decentralized cooperation and \r\ndirecting them towards finance for development. \r\nClearly, much remains to be done to ensure the \r\nintegration of international migration into \r\nco-development strategies. \r\n At the national level, initiatives should enjoy \r\ngreater coordination and better cohesion between \r\nmigration policies and development policies. At the \r\ninternational level, a framework structured around co-\r\ndevelopment objectives should produce innovative \r\ninitiatives aimed at promoting the benefits of \r\ninternational migration, including through: facilitating \r\nremittances, reducing their cost and ensuring that they \r\npromote development, and strengthening links between \r\ncountries of origin and their expatriates in terms of \r\nbusiness and investment knowledge.  \r\n The President returned to the Chair. \r\n Here, my delegation wishes to recall the political \r\npurpose of this debate: to strengthen the institutional \r\nframework and enhance the resources of a partnership \r\nthat we would like to be universal, integrating all the \r\naspects and dimensions of international migration. \r\nMoreover, given the temptation on the part of some to \r\nseek security through isolationism and the fierce \r\ndetermination of others to profit from the advantages \r\nof migration, we must stress that today there is no \r\nmiracle cure for the phenomenon of migration. \r\nHowever, there are realistic, pragmatic solutions aimed \r\nat making migration a very valuable tool to promote \r\ncooperation in development. \r\n We hope that the international community, by \r\nresolutely following the path of appropriate, \r\nharmonious and mutually advantageous management of \r\nmigration, will forcefully reaffirm its will to take \r\nresolute action against poverty, persecution, rejection \r\nand stigmatization and to promote political, operational \r\nand consensual dialogue on international migration.  \r\n With a long history shaped by a tradition of \r\ntolerance, the Republic of Guinea has always been a \r\ncountry of destination, transit and intermingling of \r\npeoples, thanks to migration from many lands. That is \r\nwhy the Guinean Government attaches particular \r\nimportance to the close links between migration and \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n In that context, and following this Dialogue, we \r\nplan to hold a national forum on co-development and \r\ndecentralized cooperation in March 2007. The forum \r\nwill bring together national development actors, \r\ntechnical and financial partners and representatives of \r\nthe Guinean diaspora. Its objective will be to provide \r\nthe country with effective policies, strategies and \r\ninstruments to mobilize the additional financing \r\nnecessary to achieve the Millennium Development \r\nGoals by 2015. The delegation of Guinea hopes to have \r\nthe support of the international community to ensure \r\nthe success of this national initiative.  \r\n Finally, my delegation reaffirms its full support \r\nand full cooperation with regard to the process \r\nunderway. We are convinced that the scope of the \r\nchallenges fully justifies such support, so that the issue \r\nof migration can be considered in the universal context \r\nthat it deserves, from the vast perspective afforded to \r\nthe international community. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Abdulla Al Araimi, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of Oman. \r\n Mr. Al Araimi (Oman) (spoke in Arabic): Permit \r\nme at the outset, on behalf of the Sultanate of Oman, to \r\nthank the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, for his report \r\non international migration and development \r\n(A/60/871), which serves as an important working \r\npaper for this High-level Dialogue. It raises a number \r\nof issues and sets out guidelines on migration and its \r\nimpact on social and economic development in \r\ncountries of origin and countries of destination. The \r\n A/61/PV.6\r\n \r\n43 06-52461 \r\n \r\nreport also emphasizes the protection of the rights of \r\nmigrants and the importance of international and \r\nregional cooperation aimed at ensuring collective \r\naction on the phenomenon of migration so as to \r\nmaximize its benefits and promote development at the \r\nnational, regional and international levels. \r\n My country wishes to emphasize the following \r\npoints.  \r\n First, every State has the sovereign right to \r\nregulate the entry and exit of workers from and into its \r\nterritory, to determine who can enter the country and to \r\ndevise policies and mechanisms regulating the \r\nresidence of those workers in accordance with its own \r\nlaws and regulations. \r\n Secondly, countries of origin must cooperate with \r\ncountries of destination to facilitate legal migration and \r\ncombat illegal migration.  \r\n Thirdly, a country of destination has the right to \r\ncontrol its labour market so that its own unemployed \r\ncitizens can find appropriate employment without \r\ncompetition from migrant workers who have entered \r\nthe country illegally. Likewise, migration should not \r\nincrease the unemployment rate in countries of \r\ndestination. That means, of course, that if we are to \r\nbenefit from migration, we must regulate it.  \r\n Fourthly, migrant workers enjoy higher wages in \r\ncountries of destination. However, such countries can \r\nalso help to increase workers’ professional skills in the \r\nprivate sector through training, especially for those of \r\nlimited skills. Thus, they can improve their skills and \r\ndevelop their own productive capacities.  \r\n Fifthly, in the Sultanate of Oman there are many \r\nimmigrants who have come to work but not to establish \r\npermanent or long-term residency. That contributes to \r\nthe long-term development and benefit of our country \r\nand of the countries of origin, and to the workers and \r\nto their families as well.  \r\n Finally, the Sultanate of Oman believes that \r\ncountries of origin must increase the awareness of their \r\nemigrants so that they understand the laws and values \r\nof the country of destination. Countries of destination \r\nmust also respect immigrants’ social and cultural \r\ndiversity and combat the illicit trading in humans. \r\nFurthermore, countries of origin and countries of \r\ndestination must cooperate to control migration, since \r\nthat is in the interests of both parties. \r\n It is the responsibility of the United Nations, \r\ninternational organizations and specialized agencies to \r\ncoordinate the positions of various countries on \r\nmigration in order to make it an essential and positive \r\nfactor in sustainable development at the international, \r\nregional and national levels. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Abdalmahmood Abdalhaleem \r\nMohamad, chairman of the delegation of the Sudan. \r\n Mr. Mohamad (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): We are \r\nextremely pleased to see you, Madam, a distinguished \r\ndiplomat from the sisterly country of Bahrain, \r\npresiding over the General Assembly at this important \r\nsession. Your election to that post is an honour for you \r\nand your country, which continues to be a pioneer in \r\nthe Arab Gulf, in the rest of the Arab world and in the \r\ninternational arena. Your country and the other Arab \r\nGulf States are safe havens for immigrants from many \r\nother countries — including my own — and have \r\nbecome a second home for them. \r\n I should like to thank the United Nations, in \r\nparticular the Secretariat, for this important initiative \r\non international immigration and development, which \r\nhas made that issue one of the concerns and focuses of \r\nthe international community. This initiative is very \r\nimportant because it deepens global understanding of \r\nthe issues related to migration, which is one of the \r\noldest human activities, and of the important role \r\nplayed by many human migrations in shaping history, \r\neconomic life and the common human heritage. In this \r\nrespect, we would like to align ourselves with the \r\nstatement made by the Minister of Home Affairs of \r\nSouth Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.  \r\n Throughout its history, our country’s particular \r\ngeographical position has given rise to considerable \r\nmigration, and the Sudan has long been a country of \r\norigin, destination and transit. We are proud of the \r\nchildren of the Sudan who have contributed to the \r\nconstruction and development of many brotherly and \r\nfriendly countries. At the same time, we are proud of \r\nthose who have come to our country, either on their \r\nway to the Holy Land or as residents who have become \r\npart of our social fabric. This has given our country its \r\nunity in diversity and the values of tolerance and \r\npeaceful coexistence. \r\n At this High-level Dialogue undertaken on \r\nInternational Migration and Development, the issue of \r\nmigration goes beyond development. Economic \r\nA/61/PV.6  \r\n \r\n06-52461 44 \r\n \r\nindicators indeed show that migration is linked with \r\ndevelopment. But it is more: migration is an important \r\nand versatile tool to increase interaction between \r\nmembers of the international human community and to \r\nbring States, peoples and cultures together. \r\n Thus, our view of migration should not be limited \r\nto development. The migrant is not just a milch cow \r\nsending remittances or an engine to drive the economy. \r\nMigrants are human beings whose aspirations and \r\nambitions weave a network of human and cultural \r\ninteractions. We believe that development should be \r\nonly one aspect of migration. Our consideration of \r\nmigration should also address the individual’s moral \r\nand material concerns. A joint effort among countries \r\nof origin, receiving countries and the international \r\ncommunity is needed for successful migration that \r\nbenefits everybody. Migrants have economic and social \r\nrights, such as the right to educate their children, to \r\nmaintain links with their homelands and to carry out \r\nunhindered the various transactions they need to \r\nundertake. In exchange, migrants are obliged to respect \r\nthe rules and laws of the host country. \r\n Although migration is a personal choice, the \r\ninternational community must nonetheless address its \r\nroot causes. This puts the role of the United Nations at \r\nthe forefront in tackling poverty, in providing resources \r\nfor development, in addressing the problem of \r\nindebtness, in promoting cooperation in the \r\nmanagement of disasters and crises and in engaging in \r\nrehabilitation and reconstruction in countries and \r\nsocieties that have emerged from struggles, conflicts \r\nand wars.  \r\n In this context, we believe there is a potential for \r\nbilateral cooperation through the signing of protocols \r\nand labour agreements to deal with migration issues. \r\nWe would like to commend regional cooperation \r\norganizations for their cooperation on migration issues. \r\nThe African Union has integrated this topic into its \r\nprogrammes to buttress the work of African economic \r\nbodies and continental economic integration \r\nmechanisms. The New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) also reflects an interest in the \r\nAfrican diaspora. \r\n At the same time, we are concerned that, \r\nalongside the international focus on migration issues, \r\nxenophobia and violence against foreigners exist. We \r\nalso see a lack of political will on many migratory \r\nissues, as well as the application of double standards. \r\nAt a time when international trade agreements call for \r\nfreedom of movement for goods and persons, some \r\ncountries are becoming more restrictive, especially \r\ntowards those seeking asylum. \r\n We believe that this High-level Dialogue will \r\nstrengthen international efforts to deal with complex \r\nissues in a comprehensive way in order to yield \r\nbenefits for all and to serve everybody’s interests. My \r\ncountry, with its vast experience of migration as a \r\ncountry of origin, destination and transit, has addressed \r\nthe issue through carefully considered institutional \r\nmeasures. Government bodies are working harder to \r\nfacilitate employment for migrants, and we have \r\nestablished a high-level body to service Sudanese in \r\nthe diaspora, help resolve the problems they encounter \r\nand link them with their homeland. An international \r\nconference was held in Khartoum last month for \r\nSudanese working abroad in the mass media and as \r\ncreative writers. \r\n To conclude, we want to emphasize our \r\nappreciation for the holding of this important Dialogue, \r\nwhich establishes joint responsibility to formulate \r\nsolutions that will promote sustainable development \r\nand facilitate the movement of persons, legal migration \r\nand respect for the rights and dignity of migrants. \r\nBeyond efforts to emphasize institutional frameworks \r\nto address migration issues, we believe that the United \r\nNations has the potential to work towards launching an \r\ninternational decade to strengthen cooperation on \r\nmigration and to declare an international day of \r\nmigrants in appreciation for the great national, regional \r\nand international efforts that have been made on \r\nmigration issues. We hope that our deliberations here \r\nwill have a successful outcome.  \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Atoki Ileka, chairman of the delegation of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. \r\n Mr. Ileka (Democratic Republic of the Congo) \r\n(spoke in French): Madam President, the head of the \r\ndelegation of the Democratic Republic of the Congo \r\nfor the sixty-first session of the General Assembly will \r\nsoon have the opportunity to convey to you our \r\nRepublic’s warm congratulations on your election to \r\nthe presidency of the Assembly. \r\n Speaking in the context of the 2005 World \r\nSummit and the recent Euro-African Ministerial \r\nConference on Migration and Development held in \r\nmid-July in Rabat, this High-level Dialogue on \r\n A/61/PV.6\r\n \r\n45 06-52461 \r\n \r\nInternational Migration and Development underlines \r\nonce again how helpless nations are if they try to act \r\nalone and how important it is to seek solutions together \r\nto important problems with transnational implications. \r\n Today we must note that migration has become a \r\nglobal problem. We therefore need a global approach \r\nthat integrates the security, economic, cultural and \r\nfinancial and legislative aspects, because migration \r\nspares no country. My country can, therefore, only be \r\ngratified to see the United Nations so clearly spell out \r\nthe relationship between international migration and \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Our country, long a country of immigration \r\nbecause of the potential of its land and what lies \r\nbeneath, regularly sees its mining areas invaded by \r\nclandestine workers from all over. Conversely, it is not \r\nonly young people without qualifications who are \r\nleaving our country in search of better horizons; we \r\nalso note a brain drain. Our doctors, engineers and \r\nteachers go into voluntary exile to seek a life abroad. \r\n Given that situation, we can see how complex \r\nmigratory flows are. But certain unchanging lessons \r\ncan be learned. First of all, we need to raise awareness \r\nand educate people to keep some potential migrants in \r\ntheir own lands, because the disappointments they \r\nencounter abroad are so great.  \r\n Secondly, our struggle to stop migratory flows is \r\ndoomed to failure without measures to repair \r\ndysfunctional labour markets and create conditions for \r\ndevelopment that will convince people — young \r\npeople in particular — to remain at home. \r\n Thirdly, uncontrolled migration has a negative \r\nimpact on countries of destination. An illegal migrant \r\nencountering obstacles to social integration can spiral \r\ninto criminality and delinquency when faced with \r\nprecarious conditions. \r\n Finally, migration is a factor of destabilization, \r\nnot only for the transit or destination countries, but \r\nalso for the countries of origin, in particular because of \r\nthe brain drain it entails. For countries like the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, precarious \r\nconditions, poverty, unemployment among young \r\ngraduates, underdevelopment and a need for material \r\nsuccess all constitute the fundamental reasons for \r\nmigration.  \r\n Despite the negative aspects mentioned, \r\nmigration can provide added value that we would be \r\nwrong not to take advantage of. For example, it is \r\nevident that in some countries of destination, the \r\ncontribution made by migrant doctors, engineers, \r\nprofessors and other qualified workers makes it \r\npossible to solve a number of problems. At the same \r\ntime, the remittances sent back to their country of \r\norigin are a non-negligible source of financial \r\nassistance to those countries. One could, therefore, \r\nconsider this economic fact to be a positive element of \r\nimmigration and one that should be optimized.  \r\n In the context mainly of our relations with the \r\nWest, the equation of migration and development \r\nbrings out the need for consensual and collective \r\nmanagement of immigration, in harmony with the need \r\nfor a significant effort to achieve economic \r\ndevelopment in the countries of origin, in cooperation \r\nwith the countries of destination and transit and with \r\nall due regard for the interests of all concerned. Over \r\nand above security concerns regarding the protection of \r\nthe borders of countries of destination, the remedy to \r\nuncontrolled migration lies in the promotion of \r\ndevelopment within the countries of origin. We should \r\ninvest in co-development projects and support for \r\ndevelopmental non-governmental organizations and \r\nsmall enterprises in order to stop immigration flows at \r\nthe source.  \r\n The Congolese Government is happy to \r\nparticipate in this High-level Dialogue in order to find \r\nrealistic and lasting solutions to the major problems \r\ncaused in the world by migratory flows and in \r\nparticular by illegal immigration. We must act on the \r\ncauses and the catalysts of migration. The limits of \r\narguments based on a desire to clamp down are \r\nbecoming increasingly evident. The preference of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo accordingly goes to \r\nefforts to convince potential immigrants to stay at \r\nhome. We support the idea that economic and political \r\nstabilization in our countries constitute a structural \r\nresponse to the migration problems in Africa.  \r\n It is indispensable for States to continue to \r\nexplore ways and means of strengthening the link \r\nbetween migration and development, so that properly \r\nmanaged migration can help us attain the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, in particular by improving \r\ndialogue between the Government, the migrants and \r\ntheir families. In thanking the Secretary-General for his \r\nreport (A/60/871), my delegation therefore welcomes \r\nhis proposal to set up a standing forum on migration \r\nissues that could serve as a framework within which to \r\nA/61/PV.6  \r\n \r\n06-52461 46 \r\n \r\npursue the debate, exchange ideas and experiences and \r\nenable Governments to study relevant policies and \r\ntheir impact on development. The Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo fully supports this proposal and \r\nwelcomes the offer made by the Kingdom of Belgium \r\nto host the first meeting of the forum next year in \r\nBrussels.  \r\n The President (spoke in French): I give the floor \r\nto His Excellency Mr. Ibrahim Sesay, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of Sierra Leone.  \r\n Mr. Sesay (Sierra Leone): The delegation of the \r\nRepublic of Sierra Leone wishes to commend the \r\nreport of the Secretary-General (A/60/871), which \r\nhighlights the complexity, new dimension and \r\nparadigm shift on migration issues. We want to thank \r\nthe organizers of this conference, which we find to be \r\nvery timely and extremely important. Please accept our \r\ngratitude, Madam President, for the excellent manner \r\nin which you are conducting the affairs of this session. \r\nMy delegation fully aligns itself with the statement \r\nmade by the Minister of South Africa on behalf of the \r\nGroup of 77 and China. \r\n International migration is an age-old \r\nphenomenon. It supported industrialization, \r\nmodernization and demographic transition in Europe. \r\nToday, it is a paradox that strict visa requirements and \r\nxenophobia exist in many countries, when former \r\ndestination areas of the world are trying to industrialize \r\nand modernize. Yet, it is in those same nations that \r\nmost of the demographic growth dynamics shaping the \r\nworld population are taking place.  \r\n Forty per cent of the population of Sierra Leone \r\nis under 15 years of age. Unemployment is widespread, \r\nand the situation may be worse for young women. \r\nTheir contributions are not sufficiently remunerated \r\neven though they work for longer hours, taking care of \r\nthe home, the elderly and the sick, while undertaking \r\nfarm work.  \r\n From the perspective of the individual young \r\nperson and his family, immigration has been seen as an \r\nescape from deprivation and poverty. Migrant \r\nremittances have been used to pay bills for immediate \r\nhousehold consumption needs and, in a few instances, \r\ninvestments like small businesses or construction of \r\nfamily dwellings. But the volume of remittances from \r\nthe Sierra Leonean diaspora is certainly far below \r\nthose reported in Asian countries or other parts of sub-\r\nSaharan Africa. \r\n Sierra Leone now stands at the crossroads of a \r\nmajor phase of reconstruction and development. As the \r\ncountry implements its first-ever Poverty Reduction \r\nStrategy Paper, it does not have the number of doctors, \r\nnurses, engineers, scientists, lecturers and other \r\nprofessionals and skilled personnel required in the \r\nprocess. The limited numbers available continue to \r\nmigrate to countries of the North in search of a better \r\nlife. \r\n To ameliorate this situation, the Government has \r\nput together a Senior Executive Service scheme that \r\naims to attract highly qualified manpower to all \r\nministries, departments and agencies. In the interim, a \r\nstopgap transitional measure has been worked out with \r\nthe assistance of the International Organization for \r\nMigration. Nationals from Sierra Leone with relevant \r\nexpertise in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom \r\nare being encouraged to return and render services for \r\nup to 30 months, without losing any status or benefits \r\nin their countries of residence. Other, similar initiatives \r\nare being developed, and we call on the countries of \r\nthe North especially to participate in them. It is hoped \r\nthat during their sojourn, the members of the Sierra \r\nLeonean diaspora may become interested in returning \r\nand further contributing to the ensuing development \r\nwork in the country. \r\n In closing, I would stress that this is the time for \r\nreal action. Initiatives like these and regional \r\nconsultative processes between sending and receiving \r\ncountries are some of the best practices that an \r\nincreasingly globalizing world should adopt — if only \r\nto make international migration a win-win game. In \r\naddition, unless the poverty situations in our countries \r\nare solved and the gap between rich and poor countries \r\nminimized, it will be difficult to make any meaningful \r\nimpression on the global South-North migration trend. \r\nMeeting the Millennium Development Goals will also \r\nbe difficult in many of our countries, because even the \r\nrequisite human resource base is eroded and \r\ndevelopment planning and the implementation of plans \r\nare a problem because of lack of capacity. \r\n The President: I give the floor to His Excellency \r\nMr. Pascal Gayama, chairman of the delegation of \r\nCongo.  \r\n Mr. Gayama (Congo) (spoke in French): Madam \r\nPresident, although I am very strongly tempted to \r\ncongratulate you, I will leave that honour to my head \r\nof State or Minister for Foreign Affairs, who will be \r\n A/61/PV.6\r\n \r\n47 06-52461 \r\n \r\nattending this meeting of the General Assembly. I am \r\nsure that it will be done eloquently. \r\n Our debate concerns a burning issue whose tragic \r\nconsequences are witnessed daily in the media. \r\nHowever, historians will confirm that migration is as \r\nold as the world itself — hence the role and status of \r\nthe International Organization for Migration. We wish \r\nto commend it for the work it has done in preparation \r\nfor today’s debate. \r\n Similarly, we would like to reaffirm the \r\nconclusions of the meetings held at Rabat and Algiers, \r\nparticularly the Common African Position emanating \r\nfrom the Banjul Summit of the African Union (AU) last \r\nJuly, which dealt with the issue in all its aspects and \r\nmade a decisive contribution with regard to the \r\nmeasures that need to be undertaken to face this major \r\nchallenge to the international community. \r\n It is a fact that no one can stop migration, \r\nparticularly through current palliative measures. Even \r\nwithin each of our States, we witness the unstoppable \r\nand unending movement of peoples seeking happiness. \r\nRural exodus cannot be stopped until cities lose their \r\nattraction for village dwellers.  \r\n It is the same at the international level, as shown \r\nclearly by the example of the American continent, \r\nwhich in the past has received migrants from all \r\ncontinents. Indeed, the case of America is a positive \r\nexample — that of a strong State that is the result of \r\nimmigration, a new world that has attracted migrants \r\nseeking wealth and well-being. \r\n Today the problem of migration brings us back to \r\nthe same concerns which underpinned the elaboration \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals, including the \r\ncreation of a new world. Achieving those Goals is, we \r\nbelieve, the best guarantee for putting an end to the \r\ntragic situation prevailing on the border between Africa \r\nand its neighbour, Europe, and between Latin America \r\nand its neighbour, North America, with continents \r\npitted one against the other. This brings to mind the old \r\nsaying, “If the mountain will not go to the man, then \r\nthe man must go to the mountain”. \r\n The conclusions that we drew last year with \r\nrespect to the review of the implementation of the \r\nMillennium Declaration are, we believe, still very \r\ntopical. We must fully understand the need for co-\r\ndevelopment. The facts on the ground make it clear \r\nthat, for those who would emigrate, it is a question of \r\nsurvival, and that will be the case so as long as \r\ninequalities and gaps exist between rich and poor \r\ncountries and between rich and poor individuals. \r\n The consequences, as we all can see, is a \r\ndesperate quest for real or imagined happiness, \r\nobtained through a potential visa or through an illegal \r\nnetwork that benefits organized crime. \r\n The world needs peace. As long as hotbeds of \r\ntension remain, and as long as peace is threatened in \r\nany country or region, there will continue to be strong \r\npressure for migration. \r\n The Common African Position adopted by our \r\nGovernments in the light of this High-level Dialogue \r\non Migration and Development reflects the concerns \r\nexpressed at Banjul, the Gambia, last July, by the \r\nAfrican Union Summit, on a problem that will continue \r\nto grow in the coming years. Indeed, we must better \r\naddress a phenomenon that is becoming a new, global \r\ntwenty-first-century version of the migrations that took \r\nplace from the sixteenth through the nineteenth \r\ncenturies, as was said earlier. \r\n Greater integration of migration into development \r\npolicies and programmes is therefore an absolute \r\nnecessity, so that African countries do not suffer from a \r\nbrain drain or from a lack of expertise in domains that \r\nare essential to its development. \r\n Africa does appreciate, however, the \r\ncontributions of expatriates, who send resources that \r\ncontribute to the social investments that need to be \r\nmade for the benefit of its peoples. Thus the Secretary-\r\nGeneral rightly stressed in his report on the work of the \r\nOrganization the fact that  \r\n “remittances from Africans working abroad had \r\novertaken foreign direct investment in the period \r\n2000-2003.” (A/61/1, para. 49) \r\n For the pan-African movement, which has \r\nalready made the African diaspora the “sixth region” of \r\nAfrica, it is an issue of creating a dynamic that \r\nincludes States, the private sector and civil society that \r\ncan promote the transfer of technology and know-how \r\nat the levels needed to ensure sustainable development. \r\n The Congolese delegation would like here to pay \r\ntribute to the International Organization for Migration \r\n(IOM) for the work it is doing to support Africa in the \r\nquest to more effectively and productively address the \r\nphenomenon of migration. The African Union should \r\nA/61/PV.6  \r\n \r\n06-52461 48 \r\n \r\nstep up its cooperation with that organization in order \r\nto translate into reality the idea of an international \r\ndecade for migration and development, an idea which \r\nhas previously been referred to in a number of forums. \r\n In that respect, my country would like to discuss \r\nwith the IOM the possibility of convening, in \r\nBrazzaville, Congo, an initial series of international \r\nmeetings to consider what such a decade would \r\ninvolve. \r\n As concerns our views on other aspects of the \r\nissue, we associate ourselves with the statements made \r\nfrom this very rostrum, inter alia by South Africa’s \r\nMinister of the Interior on behalf of the Group of 77, \r\nwhose views we concur with as concerns migration and \r\ndevelopment. We also take note of the report provided \r\nus by the Secretary-General. \r\n The President: I give the floor to His Excellency \r\nMr. George Olago Owuor, chairman of the delegation \r\nof Kenya. \r\n Mr. Olago Owuor (Kenya): Madam President, \r\nthe Kenyan delegation congratulates you on your \r\nelection and on your assumption of the responsibilities \r\nof President of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \r\nsession.  \r\n The Kenyan delegation wishes also to align itself \r\nwith the statement delivered by South Africa on behalf \r\nof the Group of 77 and China. \r\n We thank the Secretary-General for his useful and \r\nenlightening report on this subject. Kenya underscores \r\nthe close link between international migration and \r\ndevelopment. International migration is not new. \r\nHowever, there have been drastic changes in the \r\ndirection, numbers and push-and-pull factors in the \r\ncountries of origin, transit and destination. These have \r\nbeen caused by improvements in information and \r\ncommunication technologies and by personal desires \r\nfor exposure and development. \r\n Equally important is the attention given and value \r\nattached to international migration by individuals and \r\nnation-States, motivated by the inherent potential and \r\nthreats associated with international migration. It is our \r\nhope that the interaction in this High-level Dialogue \r\nwill shed some light on these issues and demystify \r\nsome of the perceptions and misunderstandings \r\nassociated with international migration. \r\n International migration has more closely been \r\nassociated with globalization and liberalization. It has \r\nbeen observed that globalization has not benefited all \r\ncountries equally, neither has international migration. \r\nHence, one crucial question we should ask ourselves is, \r\n“how can benefits of international migration be equally \r\nshared between the parties involved?” \r\n Quite often the world has looked at the benefits \r\nof migration purely from the monetary perspective. \r\nWhile remittances may constitute one of the important \r\nbenefits, they may not give the full picture. The nature \r\nand magnitude of remittances, especially those going \r\nto the developing countries, are not known, because \r\nmany countries do not have either the capacity or \r\nmechanisms to capture the flow of remittances. \r\n Other benefits of international migration to the \r\ncountries of origin may include the transfer of \r\ntechnology, exposure to other cultures and \r\nopportunities, and the acquisition of knowledge, talent \r\nand skills, among other things. The benefit ultimately \r\ndepends on whether the immigrants maintain links with \r\ntheir countries of origin and whether they are \r\nfacilitated adequately to interact and remit some of \r\ntheir acquisitions. \r\n Immigrants participate in the development of \r\nreceiving countries in various ways. They provide a \r\nlabour force, a demand for consumer goods and \r\nservices and much more. \r\n However, there are numerous negative aspects \r\nassociated with international migration that need \r\nattention. In some cases, international migration has \r\nbeen associated with insecurity and many forms of \r\nillegal activity. Environmental degradation and the \r\nstrain on economic, social and cultural traits and \r\ninfrastructure have been seen as some of the negative \r\naspects. \r\n We are encouraged by the proposal to have an \r\ninternational forum on this issue. The envisaged forum \r\non migration must be institutionalized within the \r\nUnited Nations and other regional and international \r\nforums. The key issues that need detailed examination \r\nin such a forum include human rights, gender aspects \r\nof international migration, security, the link between \r\nrefugees and migration, sociocultural aspects of \r\ninternational migration and regional and international \r\naspects of international migration. \r\n A/61/PV.6\r\n \r\n49 06-52461 \r\n \r\n The Kenya delegation believes that this High-\r\nlevel Dialogue will pave the way for enhanced \r\ncollaboration, cooperation and future interaction at the \r\nregional and international levels on this very important \r\nsubject. We remain committed and ready to engage in \r\nthis debate for the benefit of all peoples and nations \r\nconcerned. \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Paul Badji, chairman of the delegation of Senegal. \r\n Mr. Badji (Senegal) (spoke in French): Senegal \r\nwelcomes the General Assembly’s clear and timely \r\ndecision to place such a relevant issue as international \r\nmigration and development on the agenda of the sixty-\r\nfirst session. This is recognition of the invaluable \r\ncontribution of migrants to development to their \r\nsocieties, both in the host countries and origin \r\ncountries, even if it turns out that migration is also a \r\nsource of concern. \r\n This meeting should enable us to set out \r\nimportant markers for more concerted and more \r\nfruitful international cooperation with regard to the \r\nmanagement of migration. Here, as elsewhere, \r\nunilateralism can only bring tension. \r\n If the main reason that leads those considering \r\nemigration is to seek better social well-being, it is also \r\nthe case that the effects of globalization and economic \r\nliberalization have accentuated that fact and have led to \r\nunprecedented movements of populations. \r\n In Senegal, sectors such as fisheries, agriculture \r\nand food-processing industries that provided \r\nemployment in the past are now facing the \r\nrepercussions of that liberalization and the distortions \r\nof the global market. In consequence, those sectors are \r\nbeing deserted, which means growing unemployment \r\nand declining productivity and income. In that context, \r\nany efforts to stem the movement of populations — \r\nparticularly of young graduates and workers, whether \r\nthey be skilled or unemployed — towards regions more \r\nfavourable to their development could  be ineffective. \r\n The financial windfall that comes from the \r\nsavings that migrants inject into their countries of \r\norigin is not a panacea for development, because in \r\nmost cases it does not lead to productive investment. It \r\ncan even have negative effects by placing countries \r\nthat enjoy these remittances in a situation of \r\ndependence. The impact of the remittances on \r\neconomic progress is minimal compared with the \r\nlosses caused by the brain drain, in terms of \r\ninsufficient human and intellectual resources and \r\nskilled labour. It also means that there is less \r\ninvestment in developing such resources. To this must \r\nbe added the frustration experienced by those people \r\nwho are deprived of their fundamental rights to health, \r\neducation and development by health and school \r\nsystems and an economy that cannot meet their needs. \r\n Thus the relationship between development and \r\nthe availability of human resources puts the brain drain \r\nat the heart of the problem of migration and \r\ndevelopment. In a word, it is the very concept of \r\nsustainable development that needs to be re-examined \r\nthrough the prism of the movements of individuals in a \r\nglobalized world, in the same way as the movements of \r\ngoods, services and capital. \r\n In this process Senegal has set up a project called \r\n“Return to Agriculture (REVA)”, it was recently \r\nlaunched by President Abdoulaye Wade to encourage \r\nintegrated development, particularly in those zones that \r\nare sources of migration. Other initiatives have been \r\ntaken, such as promoting access to microfinance, the \r\ncreation of a fund for the promotion of the youth and \r\nan agency for development of small and medium-sized \r\nenterprises. Documentation on REVA is available in \r\nthis Hall. \r\n Part of the aforementioned project includes \r\nProject Tokten. This project has been defined with the \r\nUnited Nations Development Programme to involve \r\nskills of our expatriates in the national development \r\nprocess. Also, in 2001, an action plan was adopted for \r\nthe return of emigrants and their reinsertion in the \r\neconomic life of the country. \r\n In the context of the crucial and paramount role \r\nof national efforts, I would also like to highlight the \r\nimportance of international partnerships, which are \r\nbecoming all the more essential as we witness the \r\nresurgence of illegal migration, an increasingly tragic \r\nhuman reality.  \r\n Working within its own resource constraints to \r\ncontain this phenomenon, which is now of \r\nunprecedented proportions, Senegal has launched a \r\njoint operation with the countries of the European \r\nUnion (EU), in the context of the EU Agency for \r\nborder cooperation, known as Frontex. In this \r\nconnection, in August an agreement was signed with \r\nSpain that provides for the surveillance of the coast by \r\nA/61/PV.6  \r\n \r\n06-52461 50 \r\n \r\nsea, air and land; these operations are beginning to bear \r\nfruit. \r\n Furthermore, a framework convention is being \r\nnegotiated with France to ensure joint management of \r\nmigratory flows between our two countries. However, \r\nwe stress that the management of international \r\nmigration must not, and cannot, be limited to security \r\nmeasures. We cannot hold back the ocean with our \r\narms. Thus the “Rabat spirit” was born, following the \r\nEuro-African conference that took place in that city on \r\n10 and 11 July, at which a Declaration and Action Plan \r\nwere adopted with a view to providing African and \r\nEuropean countries with the means to better understand \r\nand control the phenomenon of migration.  \r\n We must acknowledge that no policy of \r\nprevention is likely to succeed if the necessary \r\nconditions are not in place to ensure that potential \r\nemigrants stay in their own countries. We must \r\nsynergize our efforts to combat poverty and \r\nunemployment, which are growing exponentially in \r\nmany sectors. \r\n Senegal is convinced that any initiative aimed at \r\nensuring that migration serves development must be \r\nbased on the principles of shared responsibility, \r\ncommon interests and co-development. It must also \r\ntake account of the following requirements. First, we \r\nmust combat illegal emigration, because it leads to \r\ntrafficking and other abuses and can give rise to \r\ninsecurity and tension. We must enhance operational \r\nand logistical cooperation so as to improve border \r\ncontrols and reduce the massive flows of irregular \r\nmigrants, which have recently provoked a xenophobic \r\nreaction in host countries. For its part, Senegal has \r\nchosen to take a zero-tolerance approach to illegal \r\nemigration.  \r\n Secondly, we must promote legal migration and \r\nstabilize migratory flows, particularly through \r\nconcerted information and communication campaigns. \r\nThis is the best way to eliminate negative effects. It \r\nshould be said that the systematic refusal to issue visas, \r\nwhich causes certain people to feel that there is no way \r\nfor them to visit other countries to undertake normal \r\nprofessional activities or to learn about other cultures, \r\ncan prompt some of them to view themselves as \r\nvictims, to consider desperate measures and to take \r\nregrettable steps. Mafia-like gangs operating in both \r\ncountries of origin and countries of destination exploit \r\nthose feelings, and they must be combated vigorously. \r\n Thirdly, we must fully accept and respect the \r\nrights and dignity of migrants and their families so as \r\nto strengthen and make credible the process of jointly \r\nmanaging migration. The idea of co-development will \r\nbe meaningless if migrants cannot enjoy their rights or \r\ndo not have an opportunity to fulfil their \r\nresponsibilities through the effective respect by all \r\nStates of relevant international norms. These include \r\nthe right to health and education, as well as to \r\nprotection for vulnerable social groups, in particular \r\nwomen and young people.  \r\n In conclusion, I would like to welcome the \r\nSecretary-General’s significant proposals. My country \r\nfully supports them, particularly those relating to the \r\nestablishment of a standing global consultative forum \r\nto follow up this process. If that recommendation is \r\nimplemented, the forum would be a useful complement \r\nto the exchange and cooperation mechanisms at the \r\nbilateral and interregional levels that already exist. \r\n The President: I give the floor to His Excellency \r\nBishop Nicholas Di Marzio, chairman of the observer \r\ndelegation of the Observer State of the Holy See. \r\n Bishop Di Marzio (Holy See): It is clear from \r\nour discussions over the past two days that migration is \r\nan essential element of interdependence and exchange \r\namong nations and forms part of the phenomenon of \r\nglobalization. It places people in a global dimension \r\nand in new relationships of interdependence, while the \r\ngrowth of the global economy depends more and more \r\non international migration. But migration is also a \r\ngreat source of human concern, since it involves the \r\nlives and the dignity of so many hundreds of millions \r\nof people. \r\n One of the most controversial elements of this \r\ntopic is irregular migration. The Holy See recognizes \r\nthe sovereign right of nations to determine who may \r\nenter and who may remain in a given State. At the \r\nsame time, States have a grave duty to protect the \r\nrights of all persons, be they regular or irregular \r\nmigrants, and to cooperate in readmitting those who \r\nare obliged to or wish to return — whether voluntarily \r\nor involuntarily — to their home countries. A migrant’s \r\nlegal status is quite separate from his or her human \r\ndignity, since all, without exception, are endowed with \r\ninalienable rights, which can be neither violated nor \r\nignored. \r\n Both sending and receiving States have a \r\nresponsibility to respect and implement commitments \r\n A/61/PV.6\r\n \r\n51 06-52461 \r\n \r\nto international human rights law to ensure the \r\nprotection of all migrants. It falls to States to guarantee \r\nthe rights of individuals; the issue, however, tends not \r\nto be a lack of law, but rather a lack of implementation. \r\n As for authorized and long-term migrants, their \r\nfull integration is required in order to enhance social \r\nharmony and cohesion and to maximize the \r\ncontributions that migrants make to their new societies. \r\nMigrants should respect the cultural and religious \r\nidentities of the host nations and the rights and duties \r\nconferred by citizenship. They should be encouraged to \r\nintegrate socially into, as well as to contribute \r\neconomically to, the receiving countries. The public \r\nperception of migrants also needs to be improved \r\nthrough courageous political leadership and much more \r\ninformed and dispassionate media coverage. \r\n One particular concern of the Holy See is the \r\nsituation of migrants who are forced to migrate against \r\ntheir will — not only refugees, but also those who are \r\ntrafficked, many times for immoral purposes and \r\nhuman slavery. \r\n Of all the issues before States at this High-level \r\nDialogue, perhaps the most difficult is that of the \r\ngovernance of migration. Important national, regional \r\nand international decisions in areas such as \r\ndevelopment, trade and labour markets are rarely \r\nconsidered in terms of their impact on migration. More \r\neffective consultation between Governments and other \r\nstakeholders is required if coherent practices are to be \r\ndeveloped. In this regard, it is our belief that, if States \r\nwere to cooperate more broadly with one another, they \r\nwould be exercising rather than diminishing their \r\nsovereignty. \r\n So far, progress has been made in developing \r\ninformal consultative processes among Governments at \r\nthe regional level, but my delegation agrees with those \r\nwho believe that the time is ripe to consider developing \r\na global consultative process that would allow \r\nGovernments that wish to do so to forge constructive \r\napproaches to transform the positive potential of \r\ninternational migration for development into a reality. \r\nThis global process would build on regional processes \r\nand serve as the link between Governments and the \r\nGlobal Migration Group, in order to ensure that the \r\nactivities of the United Nations, together with those of \r\nthe International Organization for Migration, are \r\nmutually reinforcing and add up to a sum greater than \r\nall of their parts. It would be a standing body, \r\ninvolving Governments with first-hand experience in \r\naddressing migration challenges. In order to \r\naccommodate concerns, we believe that such a forum \r\nshould be States-driven, voluntary and non-binding in \r\nits consultations. In this context, we welcome the offer \r\nto hold a meeting next year in Belgium and look \r\nforward to this initiative. \r\n To sum up, root causes must be tackled so that \r\npeople are not obliged to leave home in order to find \r\ndecent work; migrant protection, especially of refugees \r\nand those who are trafficked or smuggled, must be \r\nbetter addressed; and regularization is needed for those \r\nwho deserve it or who give their contribution to the \r\nhost society, even if they have arrived in an \r\nundocumented or unauthorized manner, in order to \r\nfoster an environment capable of overcoming the \r\npersistent phenomena of discrimination, violence, \r\nhuman trafficking and xenophobia. \r\n Only through international collaboration and an \r\nhonest assessment at home of the benefits of migration, \r\nwill this phenomenon be addressed in a way that is \r\ndecent and humane. \r\n The President: I give the floor to His Excellency \r\nMr. Luca Dall’Oglio, chairman of the delegation of the \r\nInternational Organization for Migration.  \r\n Mr. Dall’Oglio (International Organization for \r\nMigration): In the view of the International \r\nOrganization for Migration (IOM), ensuring that \r\nmigration is a positive force for development involves \r\ntwo important elements: First, consultation and \r\ndialogue on migration; and secondly, concrete, results-\r\noriented activities.  \r\n Our organization firmly believes that dialogue \r\nand consultation are the most effective means to \r\nadvance understanding and international cooperation \r\non migration. At the bilateral level, the IOM facilitates \r\nand supports cooperation agreements in areas such as \r\nlabour migration and irregular migration. At the \r\nregional level, IOM actively promotes, supports and \r\nparticipates in regional dialogue on migration, through \r\nthe regional consultative processes. IOM either serves \r\nas the secretariat for or provides significant technical \r\nand policy support to such processes on every \r\ncontinent. Based on our experience, we would strongly \r\nendorse proposals for greater cross-fertilization among \r\nregional consultative processes, for example through \r\nperiodic meetings of process heads. We would be \r\nprepared to assist if requested.  \r\nA/61/PV.6  \r\n \r\n06-52461 52 \r\n \r\n At the global level, IOM and its membership \r\nlaunched the International Dialogue on Migration in \r\nthe IOM Council in 2001, in fulfilment of IOM’s \r\nconstitutional mandate to provide a forum to States as \r\nwell as international and other organizations for the \r\nexchange of views and experiences, and the promotion \r\nof cooperation and coordination of efforts on \r\ninternational migration issues. Should the global forum \r\nof States on migration and development proposed by \r\nthe Secretary-General be established, the Global \r\nMigration Group (GMG) could serve as the forum’s \r\nsecretariat. During its meeting earlier this month, GMG \r\nagencies agreed that the GMG would consider any \r\nrequest for support which might come out of the High-\r\nlevel Dialogue.  \r\n The second important element in realizing the \r\ndevelopment potential of migration is to identify and \r\nsupport more concrete measures to make migration \r\nwork for development. IOM has two specific, action-\r\noriented proposals that we hope can help turn the \r\ngoodwill of this High-level Dialogue into practical \r\noutcomes.  \r\n The first, the International Migration and \r\nDevelopment Initiative, would facilitate capacity-\r\nbuilding for safe, legal, humane and orderly \r\nparticipation in the global labour market. A better-\r\nregulated market would substantially strengthen \r\nmigrants’ rights and dignity, and improve working and \r\nliving conditions. The proposed initiative also includes \r\nconcrete measures to invest in human resource \r\ndevelopment and to better prepare workers for overseas \r\nemployment. \r\n The second proposal is to create a global research \r\nnetwork on development and migration policy. This \r\nnetwork would engage existing research networks, \r\nGovernments, non-governmental organizations and \r\ninternational organizations. The network would have a \r\ncapacity-building element to enhance the competence \r\nof national researchers, policy makers and other \r\nGovernment officials in developing countries. Overall, \r\nthis proposal seeks to assist both developing and \r\ndeveloped countries to produce migration research and \r\nevaluations that are policy-relevant, timely and aimed \r\nat improving development outcomes. \r\n In the lead-up to the High-level Dialogue, IOM \r\nalso identified seven key messages, which were \r\naccompanied by suggestions on specific ways the \r\nHigh-level Dialogue could contribute to moving the \r\nissues forward. Key among them is mainstreaming \r\nmigration into development planning agendas and \r\ncapacity-building, to deal more effectively with a \r\nglobal labour market. Copies of those messages are \r\navailable here today, and we were pleased to see that \r\nmany of them have been seriously addressed at this \r\ngathering.  \r\n Let me close by stating that the High-level \r\nDialogue has already achieved success by increasing \r\ninternational focus on migration and development \r\nissues. The momentum created by the High-level \r\nDialogue should not be lost. IOM looks forward to \r\nplaying an active role in whatever High-level Dialogue \r\nfollow-up Member States decide to undertake. In this \r\nregard, IOM is already engaged with Secretary-General \r\nAnnan in a constructive dialogue on ways and means to \r\nfurther improve cooperation between the United \r\nNations and IOM under the guidance of our respective \r\nmemberships. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to \r\nHer Excellency Mrs. Florence Mugasha, Deputy \r\nSecretary-General of the Commonwealth Secretariat. \r\n Mrs. Mugasha (Commonwealth Secretariat): The \r\nCommonwealth is delighted to take part in the first-\r\never High-level Dialogue on migration and \r\ndevelopment. We are 53 countries on five continents; \r\nwe account for one third of the world’s population, one \r\nquarter of its countries and one fifth of its trade. We are \r\nrich and poor, of every colour and creed. Our \r\nCommonwealth map is lined with the movements of \r\npeople who left their homes for new opportunities in \r\neducation and in employment. In a fast-globalizing \r\nworld, these movements have continued on a large \r\nscale.  \r\n In the Commonwealth, we are fully cognizant of \r\nthe fact that on one hand, migrants are agents of \r\ndevotement. They provide benefits to their countries of \r\ndestination and their countries of origin. Yet, on the \r\nother hand, we know that the challenge is to manage \r\nmigration and to ensure that the needs of the \r\ninternational labour market are fully met. Managing \r\nmigration means incorporating it into national poverty-\r\nreduction strategies and into the ways in which we \r\ncommit ourselves to meeting the global Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). We need to appreciate \r\nthat migration and education, migration and human \r\nrights, migration and health and migration and business \r\nare all linked.  \r\n A/61/PV.6\r\n \r\n53 06-52461 \r\n \r\n It is hard to quantify some of the other benefits of \r\ninternational migration, but they are by no means less \r\nimportant. These include the growth in skills through \r\nthe movement of labour and management, the \r\npromotion of political, economic and social values and \r\nincreases in foreign direct investment. For every \r\npositive statistic about migration, there is also a \r\nnegative side. The challenge, therefore, is for us to \r\nestablish a workable equilibrium. We cannot be \r\ncomplacent, because the countries which lose \r\nprofessional migrants and the countries which receive \r\nthem both have responsibilities.  \r\n The Commonwealth’s unique contribution to the \r\nmigration debate has codified these responsibilities. In \r\n2003, we developed a Commonwealth Code of Practice \r\nfor the International Recruitment of Health Workers for \r\nuse by its members. There are examples of developed \r\nand developing countries using it together, such as the \r\nUnited Kingdom and South Africa, and of developing \r\ncountries entering into agreements together, such as \r\nKenya and Namibia. The World Health Organization \r\n(WHO) is currently developing its own code, drawing a \r\ngreat deal of inspiration from the Commonwealth \r\nmodel. \r\n This was followed in 2004 by the Commonwealth \r\nProtocol for the Recruitment of Teachers, which sought \r\nto balance the right of teachers to migrate \r\ninternationally against the need to protect the integrity \r\nof national education systems and to prevent the \r\nexploitation of the scarce human resources of poor \r\ncountries. The Protocol is being discussed by regional \r\norganizations such as the Organization of American \r\nStates, and it has also been recommended by the \r\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural \r\nOrganization (UNESCO) and the International Labour \r\nOrganization. Indeed, the Protocol has become a \r\nreference framework for countries beyond the \r\nCommonwealth. We are proud of the fact that we have \r\nbeen able to introduce models of good practice. I \r\nwould encourage all participants here to study the \r\nCommonwealth models with a view to adapting them \r\nto their needs. \r\n At their most recent meeting, held in Valletta, \r\nMalta, in 2005, Commonwealth leaders urged countries \r\nto participate actively in this High-level Dialogue. \r\nThey reaffirmed their resolve to ensure the protection \r\nof the human rights of migrants and of their families. \r\nThey addressed the worst form of migration — \r\ntrafficking in human beings, especially in women and \r\nchildren, and called for strengthened policy responses \r\nin view of their own Commonwealth best practices, \r\npublished in 2003. \r\n One thing is evident in the document: the \r\naffirmation of the leaders’ practical commitment to the \r\nestablishment of a true culture of democracy — a \r\nculture that promotes economic development, which \r\nbest guarantees that migrants leave countries for the \r\nright reasons and that, when they arrive in new \r\ncountries, they reap benefits for themselves as well as \r\nfor the places to which they move.  \r\n The President: I give the floor to His Excellency \r\nMr. Raymond Forde, Vice-President of the \r\nInternational Federation of the Red Cross and Red \r\nCrescent Societies. \r\n Mr. Forde (International Federation of Red Cross \r\nand Red Crescent Societies): The International \r\nFederation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies \r\n(IFRC), representing the richness and diversity of the \r\nworld’s communities under the umbrella of one set of \r\nfundamental principles, recognizes that globalization \r\nmakes migration an inevitable fact of life for all \r\ncountries. \r\n Our position has developed from our grass-roots \r\nmembership, and our first message in this dialogue is \r\nthat more attention should be paid to the vulnerabilities \r\nand needs of migrants, regardless of their status, and \r\nthat the dignity and rights of the migrants should be at \r\nthe centre of States’ actions and policy reforms. \r\n It is important for States to acknowledge that \r\nmigrants, whether regular or irregular, are entitled to \r\ntheir universal human rights. National Red Cross and \r\nRed Crescent Societies assist migrants in a multitude \r\nof ways based on their needs and vulnerabilities. \r\n Our second key message is that States need to \r\nrethink migration policies and regulations controlling \r\nentry and exit to and from their territories, with the \r\nrecognition that the labour movement is part of a \r\nglobal economy. \r\n The IFRC argues for action by Governments at \r\nthe national level, but urges that such action be within \r\nagreed international standards. An important tool in \r\nthis respect is the International Convention on the \r\nProtection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and \r\nMembers of Their Families.  \r\nA/61/PV.6  \r\n \r\n06-52461 54 \r\n \r\n Our third message is born out of this context. It is \r\nimportant that all States — especially in countries with \r\na major influx of migrants — ratify and promote the \r\nimplementation of the Convention. \r\n Our experience in the IFRC leads us to conclude \r\nthat Governments should share our deep concerns \r\nabout the exclusion and stigmatization many migrants \r\nface in their host countries. Therefore, in our fourth \r\nmessage, we encourage Governments to support ways \r\nof fighting discrimination. Integration and non-\r\ndiscrimination are factors that can enable migrant \r\npopulations to maximize their contributions to the host \r\ncountry and reduce the risk of disaffection and \r\nturbulence. \r\n This highlights our last key message. \r\n Governments must form alliances with civil \r\nsociety, the private sector, opinion leaders and their \r\nrespective Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies to \r\nforce these issues to the top of their national agendas \r\nand to work hard for real results. \r\n Time does not allow an exhaustive examination \r\nof what the international community and the United \r\nNations itself could usefully do to support these \r\nprocesses. We are pleased that the issue of migration \r\nhas been accorded such importance in the General \r\nAssembly, for it will assuredly be a major issue at the \r\nInternational Conference of the Red Cross and Red \r\nCrescent, which all Governments and National \r\nSocieties are expected to attend in November 2007, in \r\nGeneva.  \r\n We further recommend that the issue be taken up \r\nby the Economic and Social Council and discussed at \r\nthe regional level, led by the regional Economic and \r\nSocial Commissions. The aim should be to return to the \r\nGeneral Assembly in two years with a programme that \r\nsupports the development of coherent policy \r\napproaches to migration by all Governments.  \r\n The President: I give the floor to His Excellency \r\nMr. Robert Shafer, chairman of the observer delegation \r\nof the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. \r\n Mr. Shafer (Sovereign Military Order of Malta): \r\n Allow me, Madam President, to congratulate you \r\non your recent election and to wish you every success \r\nin carrying out your responsibilities. \r\n The Sovereign Military Order of Malta \r\ncommends the work of the High-level Dialogue on \r\nInternational Migration and Development. As shown in \r\nthe report of the Secretary-General issued last May, \r\nthere are now almost 200 million persons who have \r\nmigrated from their home countries to other countries, \r\nmost seeking, of course, a better life for themselves \r\nand for their families. \r\n As the Secretary-General also notes, however, the \r\nmigration of such vast numbers of persons also \r\npresents correspondingly large challenges in protecting \r\nthe human rights of migrants. We must never let their \r\nstaggeringly high number — 200 million — blind us to \r\nthe reality that each of those millions of men, women \r\nand children is an individual human being.  \r\n These are issues of profound historical and \r\ncontinuing concern to the Order of Malta. When the \r\nOrder of Malta was created over 900 years ago, our \r\nmission was to protect and care for persons in need, \r\nparticularly the poor and those travelling far from \r\nhome. We follow this mission today.  \r\n As part of this worldwide programme of aiding \r\nthe poor, we have found that migrants often are among \r\nthe most vulnerable and the most defenceless. Too \r\noften they are invisible, or worse. \r\n In particular, I note the often abusive treatment \r\nthat migrants receive under what are euphemistically \r\ncalled “guest worker” programmes. These persons too \r\noften receive substandard wages — wages that \r\nfrequently are offset by the exorbitant charges they are \r\nforced to pay to their employers for food and lodging. \r\nSimilarly, the so-called “brokers” who recruit these \r\nmigrants in their home countries and ship them like \r\nchattel to other countries often hold them bound to \r\nsuch inflated fees that migrant workers may remain \r\nperpetually in bondage, unable to pay off their \r\nsupposed debts or to provide the amount of earnings to \r\ntheir families that originally stoked the migratory \r\ndream in the first instance. Such schemes often involve \r\nthe misuse of Government-issued travel documents. \r\n Abuses like these afflict millions of migrant men, \r\nwomen and children. Governments can provide real \r\nrelief. There are some short-term economic advantages \r\nto States that it may be hard for Governments to \r\nignore. Some countries may be content to export their \r\ncitizens so that they can generate remittances that may \r\nalleviate local poverty or fuel local investment. Some \r\nreceiving countries, developing and developed alike, \r\nmay see an economic benefit to using low-cost \r\n A/61/PV.6\r\n \r\n55 06-52461 \r\n \r\nsuppliers of goods, ignoring the high price paid only by \r\nthe labourer. \r\n That is why it is absolutely vital that the High-\r\nlevel Dialogue and all subsequent discussions of \r\nmigration and development pay careful attention to the \r\nobligations of all affected States to protect the human \r\nrights of migrants. The Military Order of Malta \r\nappreciates the opportunity to present its views on \r\nthese important issues and encourages continuing \r\ndiscussion beyond the forum of this Dialogue. \r\n The President: I give the floor to His Excellency \r\nMr. Luis Da Fonseca, Executive Secretary of the \r\nCommunity of Portuguese-Speaking Countries. \r\n Mr. Da Fonseca (Community of Portuguese-\r\nSpeaking Countries): Let me start by congratulating \r\nyou, Madam, on your election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, as well as on the excellent manner \r\nin which you have been conducting the proceedings of \r\nthis important and unprecedented High-level Dialogue. \r\nI would also like to convey our appreciation to the \r\nSecretary-General for the high quality of his report \r\n(A/60/871) on international migration, which \r\nconstitutes a very valuable contribution on how to \r\nfurther enhance the development impact of \r\ninternational migration. \r\n The Community of Portuguese-Speaking \r\nCountries (CPLP) is an intergovernmental organization \r\nwith eight economically diverse member States \r\nspanning four continents. Our countries share a \r\ncommon language and a rich cultural heritage resulting \r\nfrom long periods of historical contact, generating \r\ncultural connections that helped to build bridges and \r\nfacilitated further contacts. Migration is a phenomenon \r\nthat concerns all members of the Community of \r\nPortuguese-Speaking Countries as source, transit and \r\ndestination countries. Portugal — a former source \r\ncountry itself — is now the preferred destination of a \r\nconsiderable number of lusophone and other migrants. \r\nBut migration flows in our space are multidirectional: \r\nwhile most Portuguese-speaking migrants have chosen \r\nPortugal as their destination, Angola, Brazil, Cape \r\nVerde and Mozambique have also become destination \r\nand transit countries, not only for the Community’s \r\ncitizens but also for those from elsewhere. \r\n The impact of migration on our societies is \r\nbecoming increasingly apparent in terms of its \r\neconomic, social, cultural and political aspects. For \r\nthis reason, we welcome this comprehensive debate. \r\nThe CPLP joins the consensus that seems to be \r\nemerging within the international community on the \r\npositive contributions of migration to development and \r\non the need to take effective measures to protect the \r\nrights of migrants and combat discrimination against \r\nthem, as well as to combat the transnational traffic in \r\npeople, which targets mainly women and children, and \r\nother human rights violations. \r\n In fact, the CPLP concurs with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that international migration is intrinsically \r\nlinked to the development of both receiving and \r\nsending countries. Nevertheless, we believe that, if co-\r\ndevelopment is to work, it is imperative that two \r\nconditions be met. International guidelines to improve \r\nthe governance of migration need to be established \r\nand, at the national level, migration policymaking \r\nneeds to be closely coordinated with development \r\npolicies. \r\n Those were some of the outcomes that emerged \r\nfrom a seminar on migration and development within \r\nthe CPLP framework held in Lisbon in June. During \r\nthe seminar, participants agreed that if appropriate \r\npolicies are implemented, migrants will be able to \r\nsimultaneously contribute to the development both of \r\ntheir country of origin and of the receiving country. We \r\nview this as one of the most promising opportunities \r\noffered by twenty-first-century migration. \r\n The fact is that know-how can now be easily \r\ntransferred, making it possible to convert brain drain \r\ninto brain gain. In this respect, however, it is important \r\nto, among other measures, promote the economic, \r\nsocial and political integration of migrants in the host \r\ncountry; ease the red tape involved at various levels in \r\nthe relationship between migrants and public \r\nadministration; reduce the cost of remittance transfers; \r\nand raise awareness regarding the active role that \r\nmigrants can play in development. \r\n Even though economic migration can make a \r\npositive contribution, we cannot ignore the fact that it \r\nis generally motivated by poverty in the source \r\ncountries. Conditions should therefore be put in place \r\nto improve people’s living standards, so as to ensure \r\nthat migration, if undertaken, is not a result of the \r\nfailure of the development process. Governments, the \r\nprivate sector and civil society should work together to \r\ncreate conditions that allow citizens’ needs to be met in \r\ntheir country of choice, including their birthplace. \r\nA/61/PV.6  \r\n \r\n06-52461 56 \r\n \r\n When it comes to facilitating development \r\nthrough migration, regional and other \r\nintergovernmental organizations, such as the CPLP, \r\nshould participate actively at the regional level, by \r\npromoting greater coordination among States, and, at \r\nthe global level, by fostering cooperation between \r\ninternational organizations and by sharing positive \r\nexperiences and best practices. \r\n It was with this in mind that the CPLP, at its most \r\nrecent summit meeting, held in July 2006 in Guinea-\r\nBissau, adopted a resolution on the importance of \r\ninvolving the diaspora in the development process. In \r\naddition, a total of five circulation agreements were \r\nadopted in 2002, aimed essentially at facilitating the \r\ncirculation of CPLP citizens within the Community. An \r\nObservatory of Migration Flows has also been created \r\nto compile and share accurate and up-to-date statistical \r\ndata on the flow of migrants within the CPLP. These \r\nare measures that will hopefully bear fruit and promote \r\nthe full integration of CPLP migrants, granting them \r\nthe necessary support to effectively act as development \r\nagents, while at the same time preventing illegal \r\nmigration. \r\n The linkage between migration and development \r\nis gradually being acknowledged by the international \r\ncommunity, making it possible for international \r\nmigration issues to be systematically incorporated into \r\nnational, regional and global development strategies in \r\nboth the developing and the developed world. \r\n In this context, we strongly support the \r\nSecretary-General’s proposal on the setting up of a \r\nglobal forum on migration and development. We \r\nbelieve that the holding of this High-level Dialogue is \r\nan important first step in that direction. \r\n The President: I give the floor to His Excellency \r\nMr. Fernando Valenzuela, chairman of the observer \r\ndelegation of the European Community. \r\n Mr. Valenzuela (European Community) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): I welcome the organization of the High-level \r\nDialogue on International Migration and Development. \r\nThe debates during these two days have shown that \r\nthese issues are of great interest. The European Union \r\nis particularly interested in these questions, as is \r\nreflected in the statements of the Finnish presidency \r\nand other member States of the European Union. \r\n When speaking of migration, we think of the \r\nSouth-North movement of poor people from poor \r\ncountries who undertake long and often dangerous \r\njourneys to work in wealthier countries. The reality of \r\nour globalized world is, however, much more complex \r\nand changing. The political debate should turn around \r\na broader concept than that of migration and look at the \r\nidea of mobility. From that point of view, the \r\nexperience of the European Union has much to teach \r\nus; the free circulation of persons is now a reality \r\nwithin the European Union. \r\n At the international level, the free circulation of \r\npersons is an unrealistic prospect. However, it is \r\npossible and desirable to facilitate regular movements \r\nof persons. In addition, the European Union supports \r\nefforts towards regional integration, convinced as it is \r\nthat they can contribute to making the free circulation \r\nof persons a reality within the regions concerned. The \r\nprogressive implementation of a European migration \r\nand asylum policy goes hand in hand with notable \r\nefforts to ensure coherence between those policies and \r\nthe contribution of the European Union to the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nFor the European Commission, the main issue of this \r\nDialogue is the link between migratory phenomena and \r\ndevelopment in the countries of origin. \r\n Allow me to give some examples of the efforts \r\nbeing made by the European Commission along those \r\nlines. In addition to the very substantial development \r\nassistance provided by the European Union, the \r\nCommission is considering various initiatives to help \r\nimmigrants make a contribution to the development of \r\ntheir countries of origin, whether in terms of \r\nremittances or through the promotion of circular and \r\nreturn migration. At the same time, the Commission is \r\nstudying with its partners, especially in Africa, \r\nmeasures to attenuate the adverse effects of the \r\nemigration of specialized workers, often referred to as \r\nbrain drain. Likewise, the Commission is prepared to \r\nwork with its partners to develop their capacity to limit \r\nirregular, clandestine migration and promote legal \r\nmigration. The European Commission is also ready to \r\nhelp those countries interested in carrying out detailed \r\nstudies that should help them to establish coherent \r\nmigration policies and that will allow donors to \r\ndetermine the best possible use of their assistance. \r\nThose are the main areas of cooperation that the \r\nEuropean Union is endeavouring to develop with the \r\ncountries of origin and transit in a spirit of shared \r\nresponsibility in the face of what we consider to be a \r\njoint challenge. \r\n A/61/PV.6\r\n \r\n57 06-52461 \r\n \r\n These are also questions that in our opinion \r\nshould be included in the exchange of experiences and \r\ngood practices that could be developed within the \r\nframework of the international consultative forum \r\nmentioned yesterday by the Secretary-General. The \r\nEuropean Commission feels that the future work of the \r\nforum and the efforts of Mr. Peter Southerland, the \r\nextension of whose term of office we welcome, could \r\ncontribute usefully to furthering the debate at the \r\ninternational level concerning the links between \r\nmigration and development, especially in countries of \r\norigin.  \r\n The President: I now give the floor to \r\nMs. Halima Kassim, Deputy Programme Manager for \r\nGender Affairs and Caribbean Community \r\nDevelopment of the Caribbean Community. \r\n Ms. Kassim (Caribbean Community): I bring \r\ngreetings from the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) \r\nand in particular from the Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Edwin Carrington, who regrettably could not be \r\nhere. I also take this opportunity to congratulate you, \r\nMadam, on your election to the presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-first session. \r\n CARICOM is made up of 15 member States and \r\nfive associate members, and we support the statements \r\nmade by those States. Recognizing the impact of \r\nmigration on the development of the Community, the \r\nmatter was discussed at the level of the highest \r\ndecision-making body of CARICOM, which welcomes \r\nthis High-level Dialogue on International Migration \r\nand Development and hopes that it will contribute to an \r\nexchange of best practices on migration and \r\ndevelopment and foster cooperation on key migration \r\nissues at the bilateral and multilateral levels. \r\n Migration is an expression of an individual’s will \r\nfor an improvement in his or her economic situation \r\nand a better quality of life, but it also involves relations \r\nbetween sovereign States. In that regard, there is a need \r\nfor strengthening the governance of migration at the \r\nnational, regional and international levels, and \r\nCARICOM welcomes the Secretary-General’s \r\nsuggestion for a global consultative forum on \r\ninternational migration as a mechanism to forge greater \r\ncooperation and coherence on this issue. Migration is a \r\ncomplex multidimensional phenomenon, and its impact \r\non development for the region is both positive and \r\nnegative. It is clear that the pace of sustainable \r\ndevelopment is influenced by migration flows that \r\nfurther compromise the attainment of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. Migration, therefore, cannot be \r\nseparated from issues of market access, trade \r\nimbalances, debt sustainability, unemployment, \r\npoverty and inequalities. \r\n Our region is impacted to varying degrees by the \r\nphenomenon of migration, as countries of origin and \r\ndestination, through the loss or gain of skilled labour, \r\nmovement of temporary workers, flows of remittances, \r\nhuman trafficking and returning migrants, whether \r\nvoluntary or through the forced repatriation of migrants \r\nand foreign-born legal residents to the region. It is \r\nworth noting that a study is being conducted in \r\nJamaica, Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago on the \r\nsocial implications of the return of nationals who \r\nmigrated at a young age and return as adults. \r\n Demographic trends and economic developments \r\ndetermine in-flows and out-flows of migrants in and \r\noutside the region. Within the region, the flows are also \r\nassociated with various economic activities. It is \r\nenvisaged that within the foreseeable future the \r\ncentrifugal forces would continue to favour \r\nintraregional migration. More so in the light of the \r\nCARICOM Single Market and Economy (CSME), as \r\nprovided for under the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas. \r\nSafeguarding the rights of migrants and their families \r\nis recognized as an important aspect of this \r\ndevelopment, and the CARICOM Agreement on Social \r\nSecurity must be considered a supportive measure for \r\nthe free movement of skills. Additionally, the issue of \r\ncontingent rights is under consideration. \r\n As a result of migration from the region, a \r\nCaribbean diaspora has evolved, primarily in North \r\nAmerica and in the former colonizers, namely, the \r\nUnited Kingdom, France and the Netherlands. The \r\nCaribbean diaspora plays a significant role in the \r\nregion. CARICOM recognizes the importance of its \r\ncontribution to its development and its role in the \r\nstrategic positioning of the region and in the \r\nimplementation of the CSME to maximize the benefits \r\nthat that could bring to the Caribbean people. In that \r\nregard, at the twenty-seventh meeting of the \r\nConference of the Heads of Government held in July \r\nthis year, the proposal was endorsed to convene in June \r\n2007 a conference on the Caribbean, which will seek to \r\ndeepen the region’s relations with the Caribbean \r\ndiaspora in the United States of America. \r\nA/61/PV.6  \r\n \r\n06-52461 58 \r\n \r\n CARICOM recognizes the effect of migration on \r\ndevelopment, as reflected in the attention given to the \r\nissue by the heads of Government at the twenty-\r\nseventh Conference. The Conference agreed that \r\nspecial attention should be paid to establishing policies \r\nin specific areas such as strategies for the retention of \r\nskilled labour, establishment of a reliable information \r\nsystem and database to enhance national capacity, the \r\nbuilding of social support systems to respond to the \r\nrequirements of voluntary and involuntary return of \r\nmigrants and relations with the diaspora. They also \r\nagreed on the need to adopt a multilateral approach to \r\nthe issue of human trafficking and to support a \r\nmultilateral evaluation mechanism to create an \r\nimpartial and transparent mechanism for evaluating the \r\nprogress of countries with respect to human trafficking. \r\nThey supported a recommendation for the \r\nestablishment of a technical working group to \r\nundertake a policy study and report to heads of \r\nGovernment through the relevant Councils within one \r\nyear.  \r\n CARICOM is committed to working towards \r\noptimizing the benefits of migration to development. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Sir John Rumet Kaputin, Secretary-General \r\nof the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States. \r\n Sir John Rumet Kaputin (African, Caribbean \r\nand Pacific Group of States): It is a great honour and \r\nprivilege for the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) \r\nGroup of States to take the floor at this important \r\nHigh-level Dialogue on International Migration and \r\nDevelopment.  \r\n The ACP Group of States is the largest organized \r\nentity for developing countries, with a membership of \r\n79 covering the African continent and the Caribbean \r\nand Pacific regions, and with an estimated population \r\nof over 700 million. It has as one of its core objectives \r\nthe alleviation of poverty. That objective, coupled with \r\nthe promotion of sustainable development, is also at \r\nthe heart of our Cotonou Partnership Agreement with \r\nthe European Union, which interlocks 103 countries \r\nand represents the most advanced and innovative \r\nNorth-South formalized development cooperation \r\narrangement. \r\n Today, we are gathered here at a time when the \r\nglobal community faces numerous challenges, together \r\nwith the related effects and transformations at the \r\ncontinental, regional and country levels. In a global \r\npartnership centred on human dignity and mutual \r\nrespect, issues of asylum, migration and mobility are \r\ncentral to the development of our countries and, \r\nindeed, are cross-cutting issues to almost all the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. \r\n In addressing those challenges, the ACP Group \r\nwould like to ensure that migration positively \r\ninfluences development. The ACP Group of States is \r\nconsidering those issues in a coordinated manner \r\nwithin its institutional framework. In that regard, \r\nactions taken and future initiatives of the ACP Group \r\nare captured in the ACP position document on \r\ninternational migration and development, which has \r\nbeen distributed. \r\n I would like to pose a few questions regarding the \r\nmobility of people. How many of us are living outside \r\nour countries of birth? How many of us are enticed or \r\nforced to migrate and eventually find means of \r\nsubsistence outside our countries of birth? How many \r\nof us are willingly leaving our countries of birth to get \r\na better chance to study, work and settle in new \r\nenvironments? \r\n None of those questions should remain \r\nunanswered and, to that end, the ACP Group is actively \r\nworking at defining a common strategy that is people–\r\nfocused and based on the alleviation of poverty and the \r\neventual promotion of sustainable development.  \r\n I, too, am a migrant, and so are most of us. \r\nTherefore, we should all endeavour to develop policies \r\nand programmes that are focused on the well-being of \r\nour peoples. That is why the focus of the global debate \r\non migration and development is so important in \r\nlooking at possible solutions in a new, innovative and \r\noverall positive way. \r\n The ACP Group is of the view that the United \r\nNations High-level Dialogue on International \r\nMigration and Development should be not an end in \r\nitself, but rather an important juncture of a continuing \r\nprocess. The continuing debate on migration and \r\ndevelopment should focus on improved integration of \r\nmigration issues into development policy and planning; \r\ncapacity-building to develop and manage migration \r\npolicies; ensuring an inclusive approach to migration, \r\nincluding the involvement of non-State actors, such as \r\nnon-governmental organizations, business, trade unions \r\nand civil society; greater utilization of the development \r\npotential of diasporas; the promotion of global \r\ndialogue on migration issues, including regional \r\n A/61/PV.6\r\n \r\n59 06-52461 \r\n \r\nconsultations and North-South exchanges; and greater \r\ncommitment to protecting the basic human rights of \r\nmigrants, refugees and displaced persons. \r\n The ACP Group believes that the High-Level \r\nDialogue on International Migration and Development \r\nhas steered an important process that involves \r\nGovernments, institutions, United Nations agencies, \r\nand international, regional and local non-governmental \r\norganizations, and attracts international attention to \r\nmigration and development. A global and \r\nmultidisciplinary approach to migration and \r\ndevelopment issues is the only way forward to ensure \r\nthat the positive and development elements stemming \r\nfrom migration can be further enhanced. Successful \r\nparticipation in the global migration forum requires an \r\nongoing exchange of information and best practices \r\namong countries of origin, transit and destination, \r\ntaking into account the ever-changing nature of human \r\nmigration. \r\n In conclusion, the African, Caribbean and Pacific \r\nGroup of States is committed to addressing the critical \r\nissues of migration in relation to sustainable \r\ndevelopment and, by implication, addressing the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. All endeavours to \r\ndevelop migration policies and programmes should be \r\nfocused on the well-being of our peoples. Let us join \r\nhands and together formulate concrete policies and \r\nprogrammes on migration and mobility that are people-\r\nfocused and, indeed, will complement efforts to \r\neffectively address poverty and the challenges of \r\nsustainable development. \r\n The ACP Group is convinced that its close \r\ncollaboration with other actors and participation in this \r\nimportant Dialogue will result in policies and \r\nprogrammes that are in the interest of all parties \r\ninvolved and, most importantly, the peoples of ACP \r\nStates. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to \r\nMr. Enrique Iglesias, Secretary-General of the Ibero-\r\nAmerican Conference. \r\n Mr. Iglesias (Ibero-American Conference) (spoke \r\nin Spanish): Allow me first, on behalf of the Ibero-\r\nAmerican secretariat, to express our thanks for the \r\nSecretary-General’s invitation to participate in this \r\nevent. The countries of our community have been \r\nstating their points of view in this important discussion \r\nand having been giving their support to the initiative of \r\nthe Secretary-General. In November, the heads of State \r\nor Government of Ibero-America will be meeting in \r\nMontevideo, Uruguay, and this subject will be a central \r\ntopic of discussion.  \r\n We in the secretariat supported the convening of a \r\nseminar in July which was attended by many people, \r\ntechnical and other specialists, and politicians, in order \r\nto address this item and start putting together the \r\npositions for Heads of State. I would like to mention \r\njust five very brief points from that meeting that might \r\ninterest participants here today.  \r\n First, Ibero-America is convinced that migrations \r\nare an essential and specific component of the Ibero-\r\nAmerican space. They always have been so, over many \r\ncenturies, and we have always derived benefit from \r\nthem. Today, we are now benefiting other parts of the \r\nworld with those persons who are migrating there. \r\nFrom the vast experience of Ibero-America, some \r\nimportant pioneering lessons can be drawn — \r\nregarding the right of asylum, for instance — to give \r\nan idea of the significant progress that we have been \r\nable to achieve in many areas. \r\n Secondly, there is a consensus in the region that a \r\nglobal and integrated approach to the migration \r\nphenomenon is indispensable, as well as an \r\ninternational shared agenda based on knowledge of the \r\nproblems, both in terms of countries of origin and \r\ncountries of destination. Further, we consider that any \r\ndomestic migration policy requires international \r\nagreement on the subject, but both should place the \r\nmigrant at the core of decision-making, taking into \r\nconsideration the problems for all the States, whether \r\nof origin or destination. As we have heard here, a \r\nmigrant is neither merchandise nor a delinquent. \r\nMigrants are men, women and children, looking for \r\nbetter living conditions, looking to offer their work and \r\ncontribute to the host society. They accordingly \r\ndeserve to be respected in terms of human and labour \r\nrights, access to dignified work, health, education, and \r\nsecurity on equal footing with the nationals of \r\nreceiving countries. \r\n That means tackling head-on two phenomena that \r\nconstitute an attack on individual rights. I am referring \r\nto the fight against xenophobia or discrimination at the \r\ndomestic level and the efforts to combat trafficking in \r\nhuman beings and migrants at the international level. \r\nHowever legitimate the security measures that are \r\ntaken, they should never infringe on the inalienable \r\nhuman rights of migrants.  \r\nA/61/PV.6  \r\n \r\n06-52461 60 \r\n \r\n Fourthly, a special priority should be given in \r\nmigration policies to indigenous people and women, \r\nwhich we believe have important specific features that \r\nneed to be promptly addressed. \r\n Finally, through suitable policies, we should \r\nenhance the benefits of migration and reduce costs. We \r\nunderstand the short-term benefits of remittances while \r\nbeing aware that these cannot be a panacea in the long \r\nterm. In any case, it is possible to do things which \r\nwould help to prioritize and enhance their benefits. We \r\nare also concerned about brain drain. We have to do \r\neverything we can to keep people at home, seek \r\nco-development solutions so these contacts are of \r\nbenefit to those who would otherwise have a brain \r\ndrain. I think we have to move forward on global \r\nagreements and build on what has been achieved in the \r\nIbero-American countries; it is not negligible. \r\n I think this meeting will provide important \r\nguidelines so that the United Nations can contribute to \r\nglobal solutions to this global problem. I am sure that \r\nIbero-America will contribute greatly to this \r\nendeavour. \r\n The President: I now give the floor \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Gottfried Zürcher, Director-\r\nGeneral of the International Centre for Migration \r\nPolicy Development. \r\n Mr. Zürcher (International Centre for Migration \r\nPolicy Development): Madam President, I want to \r\nthank you for organizing this event, which reflects the \r\ngrowing importance of international migration for \r\nStates around the world.  \r\n As so many issues surrounding international \r\nmigration have been taken up in this forum already, I \r\nwill limit my remarks to three points. First, our \r\nexperiences have shown that the value of an informal, \r\nflexible dialogue on international migration lies \r\nprimarily in the promotion of a mutual understanding \r\nof issues of common concern. Such issues arise \r\npredominantly in a regional context where regional \r\nconsultative processes can serve to identify concrete \r\nproblems and common interests, and can help in \r\narriving at coordinated policy responses.  \r\n To give you a concrete example of a well-\r\nfunctioning regional dialogue on migration, I would \r\nlike to mention the Budapest Process, which is a \r\nconsultative forum of more than 50 participating States \r\nand 10 international organizations. That \r\nintergovernmental process was started 15 years ago, in \r\n1991, which makes it one of the oldest regional \r\nconsultative processes in the world. My own \r\norganization, the International Centre for Migration \r\nPolicy Development (ICMPD), based in Vienna, has \r\nfunctioned as the Secretariat of the Budapest Process \r\nsince 1994. The Budapest Process provides a forum for \r\nexchange of experience and information among \r\ninterested States for the purpose of promoting \r\ncomprehensive systems for orderly migration in the \r\nwider European region. Its longstanding record, as well \r\nas the recent extension of the Process to the \r\nCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries \r\nand the south-east Mediterranean region, testifies to the \r\ncontinuing value of that forum to the participating \r\nStates.  \r\n Secondly, let me say a word on the importance of \r\ncapacity-building. Efficient and accountable \r\ninstitutions for the management of migrations are vital \r\nnot only for the implementation of sustainable \r\nmigration policies as such, but also for the holding of \r\nany meaningful and mutually beneficial migration \r\ndialogue. Thus, the promotion of good governance, \r\ncapacity-building and training, is often a precondition \r\nfor a structured migration dialogue, and should have a \r\nhigh priority on the development agenda.  \r\n Thirdly, based on this experience, we conclude \r\nthat the optimal level of migration dialogue should \r\ncorrespond to the principle of subsidiarity, or in other \r\nwords that policy coordination should be made at the \r\nlowest level possible and at the highest level necessary. \r\nThat means that an inter-State dialogue on international \r\nmigration can and should take place, at the bilateral, \r\nregional or global level, according to the issues and \r\ninterests involved. In that way, even a meaningful \r\ndialogue on migration may not prevent new crises from \r\narising, but it can certainly help to manage such crises \r\nmore efficiently and in a more targeted manner when \r\nthey arise.  \r\n The President (spoke in French): I now give the \r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Ridha Bouabid, Counsellor \r\nof the Delegation for Peace, Democracy and Human \r\nRights of the International Organization of la \r\nFrancophonie. \r\n Mr. Bouabid (International Organization of la \r\nFrancophonie) (spoke in French): The theme that \r\nbrings us together today is of special concern to the \r\nInternational Organization of la Francophonie in more \r\n A/61/PV.6\r\n \r\n61 06-52461 \r\n \r\nways than one, and first, because the French-speaking \r\narea is in itself a large area of migration. It is made up \r\nof 53 States and Governments spread around the entire \r\nglobe. The French-speaking world includes both \r\ndeveloped and developing countries, countries with a \r\nstrongly entrenched tradition of migration and host \r\ncountries — countries with a common language. \r\nMoreover, we are aware of the important role of \r\nlanguage in determining migration routes, since, in \r\nmany cases, migrants choose countries whose language \r\nthey can speak.  \r\n The problems of international migration — \r\nparticularly in the current context of globalization — \r\nand its undeniable effects on development represent a \r\nmajor challenge for our community as well as the \r\ninternational community. It is a challenge that requires \r\nexchanges of ideas and concerted action, which are the \r\nonly ways to limit — albeit only slightly — \r\nmigration’s negative effects and to maximize its \r\nadvantages to benefit migrants themselves, their \r\ncountries of origin and the countries of destination.  \r\n That is the context of the discussions that we \r\nbegan in la Francophonie several years ago, including \r\nat the international meeting held in Paris in 2001, on \r\nthe theme “Francophonie and migration”, at the \r\ninitiative of the High Council of la Francophonie and \r\nthe Government of Canada in Quebec, with the active \r\nparticipation of the International Organization for \r\nMigration. Here, I wish to commend them for their \r\ncommitment and leadership in placing migration issues \r\nat the top of the global agenda and at the centre of the \r\ninternational community’s concerns.  Our discussions \r\nare based on the values dear to la Francophonie: \r\nsolidarity, democracy, human rights, cultural diversity \r\nand dialogue among civilizations.  \r\n Aware that migratory movements can be a major \r\nasset for development, our community seeks in \r\nparticular to enhance exchanges and dialogue on how \r\nto better highlight cultural diversity in integration \r\npolicies and to implement genuine co-development \r\ninitiatives between countries of the North and the \r\nSouth, between countries of origin and countries of \r\ndestination, with the active participation of migrants \r\nthemselves.  \r\n First, we have been considering ways to organize \r\nthe mobilization of skills in the context of a North-\r\nSouth partnership, enabling the South to benefit from a \r\nreturn on its investment in the qualifications of its \r\ndiaspora. We have also been assessing the impact of \r\nsome experiments with decentralized cooperation \r\ninvolving migrants, identifying a number of good \r\npractices in that area. Finally, we have been \r\nconsidering in greater depth how to reconcile our \r\naspirations to francophone solidarity with the demands \r\nof States in terms of their needs, their interests and \r\neven their security.  \r\n As recently reaffirmed by the ministers for \r\nforeign affairs of our member countries at the \r\nconference on conflict prevention and human security \r\nheld in May 2006 at Saint Boniface, Canada, our \r\ndiscussions on the important issue of migration will \r\ncontinue at the regional and international levels, \r\ncontributing to the ongoing debates being held on these \r\nissues by the international community as a whole.  \r\n That is why our organization has an interest in \r\nthis High-level Dialogue. We are fully prepared to \r\nshare our experiences and build on our discussions \r\nwith all concerned international organizations and \r\npartners. The global forum on migration and \r\ndevelopment that the Secretary-General proposes to \r\nestablish in the near future would be a special forum \r\nfor such discussions and consultations on these crucial \r\nissues. In that regard, we are pleased that the first \r\nmeeting of the forum is scheduled to be held next year \r\nin Belgium, a country member of la Francophonie. We \r\nwelcome the opportunity to make our own contribution \r\nas appropriate.  \r\n The President: I shall now call on those \r\nrepresentatives who wish to speak in exercise of the \r\nright of reply. \r\n May I remind members that, in accordance with \r\nGeneral Assembly decision 34/401, statements in \r\nexercise of the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes \r\nfor the first intervention and to five minutes for the \r\nsecond, and should be made by delegations from their \r\nseats. \r\n Ms. Kennelly (United States of America): The \r\nUnited States deeply regrets the comments made earlier \r\ntoday by the delegation of Cuba, which were \r\ninaccurate, inappropriate and disrespectful to the spirit \r\nof constructive dialogue that we have had over the past \r\ntwo days. Those comments serve to reinforce my \r\ncountry’s concerns about the difficulties of advancing \r\nproductive dialogue on migration at the global level. \r\nPolitical polemics do nothing to advance the migration \r\nand development agenda. \r\nA/61/PV.6  \r\n \r\n06-52461 62 \r\n \r\n In response to Cuba’s statement, my delegation \r\nwould note that the Cuban Government’s refusal to \r\npermit the return of its own citizens from foreign \r\ncountries, as well as its atrocious human rights record, \r\nhave caused more than 1 million Cubans to leave their \r\ncountry for save haven in other lands and has led the \r\nUnited States to take measures to regularize the status \r\nof eligible Cuban migrants who reach the shores of the \r\nUnited States. \r\n I would like to emphasize that the United States \r\nis committed at all times to safe, legal and orderly \r\nmigration. \r\n Mr. González Pérez (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nMy delegation rejects, one by one, every word said by \r\nthe representative of the United States. The \r\nGovernment of the United States, which today accuses \r\nus and claims to act as the world’s great refuge and \r\ndefender of human rights, is the same country that \r\nencourages illegal migration from my country and \r\nhuman trafficking. It even refuses to cooperate with my \r\nGovernment to ensure legal, safe and orderly \r\nmigration.  \r\n The world knows that my country is being \r\nsubjected to a brutal and criminal blockade by the \r\nGovernment of the United States, which has caused all \r\nour people grave and countless suffering. Through that \r\ngenocidal economic assault, the United States is \r\nseeking to overthrow our revolution, seeking to cause \r\npain, hunger and despair among our people.  \r\n Part of that terrible blockade and of the political \r\nmanipulation of the migration issue by the United \r\nStates is the Cuban Adjustment Act — the murderous \r\nlaw, as we call it in Cuba — because of the number of \r\nlives that it has cost our country. The Cuban \r\nAdjustment Act serves as a true spur to illegal \r\nmigration and human trafficking, which contradicts the \r\nofficial statement made here in this Hall by the United \r\nStates delegation. Through that migration policy based \r\non double standards, the United States has sheltered \r\nwithin its territory kidnappers and traffickers who have \r\nprofited from the smuggling of Cubans from Cuba to \r\nthe United States. It has also protected notorious \r\nterrorists who have committed brutal acts against \r\nCuba. \r\n The United States says that Cuba seeks to blame \r\nit and to distract attention from the human rights \r\nsituation in Cuba. By making that statement, the \r\nUnited States is telling a double lie. Cuba does not seek \r\nto blame the United States. Actually, the United States \r\nblames itself; it does not need our help. Its acts \r\ndemonstrate that. The blockade persists and becomes \r\nmore intense every year, despite nearly universal \r\ncondemnation by the international community.  \r\n To attempt to justify the blockade as a way to \r\nimprove human rights in Cuba is silly, incongruous and \r\nfoolish, because the United States is the country with \r\nthe least moral authority and credibility to talk about \r\nhuman rights. After its unilateral wars — through \r\nwhich it violates international law and the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations — the torture committed at the \r\nGuantánamo naval base and at Abu Ghraib prison and \r\nthe massive bombardment of civilian populations, the \r\nUnited States should be silent on the subject of human \r\nrights. \r\n The primary violator of human rights now points \r\nits fingers at us, claiming us to be the worst. The \r\nGovernment that is accusing Cuba continues to protect \r\nthe main perpetrator of the horrendous crime of \r\ndowning a Cubana Airlines aircraft, in which 73 people \r\nlost their lives. That Government, through its migration \r\nlaws, is keeping Cuban families apart and preventing \r\ntheir reunification. That very same Government \r\nimposes democracy at the point of a gun. \r\n Any Government that commits such atrocities, as \r\ndoes that of the United States, truly has no grounds for \r\ncriticizing Cuba. Many years ago, we in Cuba learned \r\nto live at a level of dignity and resolve that can never \r\nbe overturned.  \r\n In conclusion, I should like to quote a paragraph \r\nfrom a document, dated 6 April 1960, which was \r\nrecently declassified by the North American \r\nauthorities. The document was drafted by Lester D. \r\nMallory, then United States Deputy Under-secretary of \r\nState for Inter-American Affairs. This statement truly \r\nbacks up everything we have said. He wrote that the \r\nmajority of Cubans support Castro and that “there is no \r\neffective political opposition”. He added, cynically, \r\nthat  \r\n “The only foreseeable means of alienating \r\ninternal support is through disenchantment based \r\non economic dissatisfaction and hardship … to \r\ndeny Cuba money and supplies, to diminish \r\n[personal] income so as to cause hunger, \r\ndesperation and the collapse of the government.” \r\n A/61/PV.6\r\n \r\n63 06-52461 \r\n \r\n I believe that this statement is sufficient to clarify \r\neverything we have said. \r\n Ms. Kennelly (United States of America): The \r\nridiculous distortions of the Cuban delegation compel \r\nme to respond, but I will be brief. \r\n Let us be clear: the migration situation has been \r\ncreated by the Castro regime. Its lack of respect for \r\nhuman rights, its oppressive crackdown on political \r\nopposition and dissident activity, its complete \r\nintolerance of free expression and its requirement that \r\nCuban citizens obtain exit permits before they can \r\nemigrate cause its citizens to take their lives into their \r\nown hands and flee the country by raft. \r\n Since the United States and Cuba agreed on the \r\nmigration accords in 1994, the United States has \r\nfulfilled its commitment to providing safe, legal and \r\norderly means of immigration from Cuba. Specifically, \r\nthe United States has approved at least 20,000 migrants \r\nfor travel to our country each year since the accord has \r\nbeen in place. \r\n Mr. González Pérez (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): I \r\ntake the floor again to put the lie to the statement made \r\nby the representative of the United States to justify the \r\nallegation that the United States is the real cause of the \r\nmigratory situation between the United States and \r\nCuba.  \r\n It is no secret to anyone that 24-hour-a-day radio \r\nbroadcasts financed by the United States seek to \r\ndestabilize our country and encourage illegal \r\nimmigration. The representative of the United States \r\nused the word “dissident”. I should like to refresh her \r\nmemory and ask whether the word “dissident” means, \r\nto her, a person who is working for, receiving direct \r\norders from and paid by a foreign Power? That is the \r\ncase of the so-called dissidents whom she claims to \r\nexist in Cuba. Those people are paid a salary by the \r\nUnited States and are told what to do. My country \r\ntherefore has a legitimate right to defend itself against \r\nany agent of a foreign Government working against our \r\nnational interests. \r\n In her statement, the representative of the United \r\nStates also referred to a lack of human rights in Cuba. I \r\ndo not wish to repeat myself, nor is this the appropriate \r\ntime to do so, but if we wish to discuss a lack of rights \r\nand true dictatorship, my delegation and much of the \r\nworld knows that the only dictatorship is that which the \r\nUnited States is seeking to impose at the global level \r\nby force and in disregard for the most fundamental \r\nhuman rights. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): We have come \r\nto the end of two long but stimulating days, during \r\nwhich we have discussed, for the first time at this \r\nHigh-level Dialogue, the multidimensional aspects of \r\ninternational migration and development. \r\n We have heard from over 140 representatives \r\nabout the opportunities and challenges that \r\ninternational migration poses for development in each \r\nof their countries. We have had four round tables that \r\nhave focused on the impact of international migration \r\non economic and social development, the centrality of \r\nhuman rights to ensuring the development benefits of \r\nmigration, the importance of remittances, and the \r\ncrucial role of international cooperation and \r\npartnerships in addressing the challenges posed by \r\ninternational migration. \r\n Above all, these two days have proven that \r\ninternational migration and development can be \r\ndebated constructively in the United Nations. \r\n This High-level Dialogue has been the \r\nculmination of years of preparation. I want first and \r\nforemost to express my gratitude to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his support in preparing and organizing \r\nthis Dialogue. I also want to thank Member States, the \r\nvarious United Nations agencies, other international \r\norganizations, non-governmental organizations, civil \r\nsociety and the private sector for their contributions to \r\nmaking this dialogue a success. \r\n On this occasion, I would also like to extend my \r\nsincerest appreciation to Mr. Peter Sutherland, the \r\nSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General on \r\nMigration, for his tireless efforts in promoting the \r\nmessages and recommendations set out in the report of \r\nthe Secretary-General. We look forward to continued \r\ncollaboration as our efforts evolve. \r\n Lastly, I want to acknowledge the key role of my \r\npredecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, Foreign Minister of \r\nSweden, in organizing the two panel discussions in \r\nNew York and Geneva, as well as the interactive \r\nhearings with non-governmental organizations, civil \r\nsociety and the private sector. \r\n The High-level Dialogue has affirmed a number \r\nof key messages in the report of the Secretary-General: \r\nfirst, that international migration is a growing \r\nphenomenon and a key component of development in \r\nA/61/PV.6  \r\n \r\n06-52461 64 \r\n \r\ndeveloping and developed countries alike; secondly, \r\nthat international migration can be a positive force for \r\ndevelopment in countries of origin and countries of \r\ndestination, provided that it is supported by the right \r\nset of policies; and thirdly, that it is important to \r\nstrengthen international cooperation on international \r\nmigration bilaterally, regionally and globally. \r\n The Dialogue has emphasized that respect for \r\nhuman rights is a necessary foundation for migration to \r\nbenefit development. Many of the participants have \r\nnoted that some vulnerable groups, such as migrant \r\nwomen and children, need special protection. It was \r\nalso highlighted that migration is no substitute for \r\ndevelopment. Too often, migrants are forced to seek \r\nemployment abroad owing to poverty, conflict and lack \r\nof respect for human rights. There has been widespread \r\nsupport for incorporating international migration into \r\nthe development agenda and for integrating migration \r\nissues into national development strategies, including, \r\npossibly, poverty reduction strategies.  \r\n You have all underscored the need to provide \r\ndecent work and decent working conditions in \r\ncountries of origin and countries of destination, alike. \r\nThat would alleviate the negative aspects of migration, \r\nincluding brain drain.  \r\n Furthermore, participants have noted that \r\nremittances are among the most tangible benefits of \r\ninternational migration for development. These \r\nremittances improve the lives of millions of migrant \r\nfamilies and have a positive effect on the economy at \r\nlarge. Many participants have called for a reduction in \r\nthe cost of remittances and transfers and for \r\nmaximizing their development potential.  \r\n We have now completed the High-level Dialogue. \r\nBut where do we go from here? During these two days, \r\nin plenary statements and remarks at the round tables, \r\nnearly all participants have expressed the wish to \r\ncontinue an international dialogue in some form or \r\nanother. Many participants have embraced the \r\nSecretary-General’s proposal for establishing a Global \r\nForum on Migration and Development and the offer \r\nmade by the Government of Belgium to host the first \r\nmeeting of the Forum next year. I commend the \r\nAssembly’s commitment to advancing this constructive \r\ndialogue on this important issue.  \r\n In closing, let me once more thank all the \r\nparticipants for their active participation in this High-\r\nlevel Dialogue and wish them all the best in their \r\nfuture deliberations on international migration and \r\ndevelopment. In the coming days, I will make available \r\na President’s Summary and summaries by Chairpersons \r\nof the round tables, which will be widely distributed to \r\nall Member States, Observers, United Nations agencies \r\nand other appropriate organizations.  \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n The General Assembly has thus concluded the \r\nHigh-level Dialogue on International Migration and \r\nDevelopment and this stage of its consideration of sub-\r\nitem (b) of agenda item 55.   \r\n  The meeting rose at 9.55 p.m.  \r\n"
