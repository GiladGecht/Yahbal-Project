It is my \r\nunderstanding that draft resolution A/61/L.1 has been \r\nwithdrawn. \r\n During the High-level Meeting, the General \r\nAssembly will assess the progress made in the \r\nimplementation of commitments; the meeting will \r\nprovide an occasion to reaffirm the goals and \r\nobjectives agreed upon at the Third United Nations \r\nConference on the Least Developed Countries, to share \r\nbest practices and lessons learned, and to identify \r\nobstacles and constraints encountered, actions and \r\ninitiatives to overcome them and important measures \r\nfor the further implementation of the Programme of \r\nAction, as well as new challenges and emerging issues. \r\n(spoke in Arabic) \r\n I am honoured to be with you all here today at \r\nthis High-level Meeting on the midterm comprehensive \r\nglobal review of the implementation of the Programme \r\nof Action for the Least Developed Countries for the \r\nDecade 2001-2010. \r\n I would like to begin by extending my warmest \r\nthanks to all Member States for their participation; to \r\nthe Secretary-General for leading the invaluable efforts \r\nof the United Nations in support of the least developed \r\ncountries; to Under-Secretary-General Anwarul \r\nChowdhury for his substantive role in the \r\nimplementation of this Programme; to the experts who \r\nspent three challenging days earlier this month \r\npreparing for this High-level Meeting; and to the \r\nA/61/PV.7  \r\n \r\n06-52559 2 \r\n \r\nvarious United Nations funds, programmes and \r\nspecialized agencies for their determination in helping \r\nto elevate the status of 600 million people living in the \r\n50 most vulnerable countries of the world. \r\n We are gathered here today to renew and reaffirm \r\nour political determination to meet by the year 2010 \r\nthe commitments set out in the 2001 Brussels \r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action at the national \r\nand international levels. It is only through a global \r\npartnership bringing together least developed countries \r\n(LDCs), donor countries, civil society, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and the private sector that \r\nwe can translate this collective endeavour into \r\nmeasurable outcomes and can face the challenges of \r\nabject poverty. \r\n Against this background, I am particularly \r\nencouraged that Member States have welcomed my \r\nproposal to discuss the implementation of global \r\npartnership for development in this year’s general \r\ndebate. \r\n The least developed countries remain \r\nmarginalized in the world economy and continue to \r\nsuffer from extreme poverty, child mortality and \r\nHIV/AIDS, often with insufficient domestic capacity to \r\nhave a long-term impact on those issues. In many \r\ninstances, development is being set back by civil \r\nconflict and the cost required to rebuild everyday life. \r\nThese impediments to development make LDCs even \r\nmore vulnerable to internal and external shocks and \r\ndeprive them of the ability to take advantage of the \r\neconomic opportunities of globalization. \r\n Together, the 2001 Brussels Declaration and \r\nProgramme of Action represent a comprehensive \r\nstrategy for a global partnership to lift millions of \r\npeople out of extreme poverty. At the 2005 Summit, \r\nworld leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the \r\neradication of global poverty, the achievement of \r\nsustainable development and economic prosperity for \r\nall. They urged all parties to continue making \r\nconcerted efforts and to adopt speedy measures in \r\norder to meet the goals and targets set out in the \r\nProgramme of Action. \r\n As we move forward and implement those noble \r\ngoals, we must always remind ourselves that poverty \r\nhas a human face. It is the face of children who go \r\nwithout food; of young women who sacrifice the \r\nopportunity for education and empowerment in order to \r\nwork or care for their brothers and sisters; and of \r\nelderly persons who have no one to care for them in \r\ntheir old age. \r\n Recently, in Benin, LDC ministers re-committed \r\nthemselves to the improvement of their people’s \r\nwelfare and reaffirmed their unswerving resolve to \r\nimplement the Brussels Programme of Action. As a \r\nresult of joint efforts made at the national and \r\ninternational levels, in 2004, LDCs were able to \r\nachieve an annual average growth rate of six \r\nper cent — the highest in four decades. That \r\ncommendable achievement demonstrates how, together, \r\nwe can overcome the obstacles to development and \r\nachieve our common goals. \r\n However, overall progress remains mixed. Recent \r\nstudies by United Nations agencies and the World Bank \r\nhave revealed that 34 of the total of 50 LDCs are \r\nexperiencing an increase in extreme poverty. In sub-\r\nSaharan Africa, the situation is particularly acute, \r\nwhere by current trends most of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals will not be achieved by 2015. In \r\nfact, over the next decade, extreme poverty could \r\nactually increase. An additional 100 million people \r\ncould join the 370 million people already living in \r\nabject poverty. \r\n Although it is alarming, this situation should not \r\ndiscourage us from our common mission, the common \r\nthread that gives us unity of action to deal with world \r\npoverty –namely, the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nTogether, we have an urgent moral imperative to \r\neradicate abject poverty. We can find encouragement in \r\nthe fact that, in contrast with previous centuries, we \r\nnow have the technical know-how and resources to \r\nmake a real and long-lasting difference. We must spare \r\nno effort to bring about significant changes in the lives \r\nof millions of women, men and children trapped in \r\nextreme poverty. \r\n When receiving her Nobel Peace Prize in 2004, \r\nProfessor Wangari Maathai of Kenya stated, \r\n  “In the course of history, there comes a time \r\nwhen humanity is called to shift to a new level of \r\nconsciousness, to reach a higher moral ground. A \r\ntime when we have to shed our fear and give \r\nhope to each other”. \r\n Let us ponder the wisdom of these words for a \r\nmoment as we embark upon the task ahead of us. I \r\nbelieve the time has come. The time is now. \r\n A/61/PV.7\r\n \r\n3 06-52559 \r\n \r\n On this occasion, let us demonstrate our \r\ndetermination to eradicate poverty by redoubling our \r\ncommitment and strengthening our efforts. We must \r\nreaffirm our solidarity and collective resolve to reach \r\nout to every woman, man and child afflicted by hunger \r\nand disease. Together, let us give them a real chance to \r\nescape the dehumanizing misery of extreme poverty. \r\n I now give the floor to Mr. Mark Malloch Brown, \r\nDeputy Secretary-General. \r\n The Deputy Secretary-General: It gives me \r\ngreat pleasure to welcome, on behalf of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, delegates as the General Assembly begins a \r\nnew session. \r\n This midterm review of the 2001 Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action is an occasion for stocktaking \r\nand sombre reflection. Over the past five years, least \r\ndeveloped countries (LDCs) have experienced higher \r\neconomic growth, greater exports and larger \r\ninvestment flows. They have also made some progress \r\ntowards several human development goals, including \r\nreducing maternal and child mortality and increasing \r\nuniversal primary enrolment. \r\n Yet, despite significant progress by some LDCs, \r\ntheir gains as a group have been insufficient to meet \r\nthe goals agreed to in Brussels. And they have had \r\nminimum impact where it is most needed, as we have \r\njust heard from the President, in the fight against \r\nextreme poverty. \r\n The limited data available on recent poverty \r\ntrends is not encouraging. It suggests a negligible \r\ndecline, and even some increases, in income poverty. \r\nIndeed, right now LDCs are considered to be the least \r\nlikely group of countries to meet all the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, including the goal of reducing \r\npoverty by half by 2015. And in an unprecedented \r\nreversal of historical trends, life expectancy is \r\ndeclining in several LDCs that are most affected by \r\nHIV/AIDS and civil strife. \r\n This is hardly news to all of you. After all, just \r\nthis summer in Cotonou, your representatives \r\nacknowledged the weak implementation of the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action, while strongly reaffirming the \r\nneed for its full implementation. \r\n To that end, we must accelerate and expand our \r\nefforts. First, we must further secure development on \r\nthe stable bedrock of democracy, human rights and \r\ngood governance. Secondly, we must make \r\nglobalization work at least as much for the poor as for \r\nthe rich. To prosper in today’s competitive economy, \r\nall countries need, in the first instance, to mobilize \r\ntheir own resources and attract investment from \r\nabroad. Their ability to do that depends, in large part, \r\non the quality of their governance. \r\n Least developed countries must, for example, \r\ncontinue to improve their institutions and strengthen \r\nthe rule of law. If LDCs are to eradicate poverty and \r\npromote human development, we need to do there what \r\nwe do anywhere else –and that is to stress democratic \r\ngovernance as one of the main foundations of progress. \r\n Such governance means ensuring that the poor \r\nhave a real political voice. And it means strong, \r\ntransparent institutions that are capable of providing \r\nthe services and protections people need most — not \r\njust health care and education, but also personal \r\nsecurity and access to justice. \r\n But let us be clear: if national action must lead \r\nthe way, international support must light the path. For \r\nif globalization is to have meaning for the citizens of \r\nthe least developed nations, then LDCs must have \r\nsecure, predictable market access. They must have \r\nfurther debt relief, and they must have more and better \r\nassistance. \r\n Development progress on external debt relief \r\nneeds to be sustained so that the debts of all LDCs are \r\nreduced to levels that prevent their being an \r\nimpediment to development. At the same time, the \r\nrising volume of development assistance must rise \r\nfurther. There is still a way to go before all donor \r\ncountries attain the 0.2 per cent of the gross national \r\nincome target established by the Brussels Programme \r\nof Action. Yet, increased official development \r\nassistance (ODA) remains imperative if LDCs are to \r\nfight poverty and build the social, institutional and \r\nother tools they need to compete in the global \r\neconomy. Ultimately, it is from the global trading arena \r\nthat many of the most durable gains will ebb or flow. \r\n As it stands now, the global economy is an \r\nuneven playing field. Subsidies and non-tariff \r\nmeasures for agriculture in developed countries, for \r\nexample, continue to act as a disincentive to \r\nagricultural production and exports in LDCs and work \r\nat cross-purposes with ODA. To address this \r\nimbalance, least developed countries need secure, \r\npredictable access to markets. They need duty- and \r\nquota-free access to all developed economies, without \r\nA/61/PV.7  \r\n \r\n06-52559 4 \r\n \r\nexception, by 2008. They need the reduction and \r\nelimination of all non-tariff barriers to their exports. \r\nThey need simplified and harmonized rules of origin \r\nand trade procedures for their exports. And they need a \r\ngreater voice in international financial institutions and \r\nmultilateral standard-setting bodies. \r\n Until now, LDCs have benefited from the limited \r\noutcomes of the Doha Trade Agenda. Yet, further trade \r\nnegotiations will likely erode the preferences currently \r\navailable to them. That is why, as new export \r\nopportunities are opened up, many poor countries need \r\nexternal assistance to make use of them. \r\n As that happens, the United Nations, both our \r\nHigh Representative Anwarul Chowdhury and all \r\nFunds and Programmes and Departments of the \r\nSecretariat, will continue to help LDCs take advantage \r\nof more open markets and more generally build the \r\ncapacity for them to compete in the world economy. As \r\nallies of those countries, we will do all within our \r\ncapacity to contribute. Working together with \r\ndeveloped economies and donor nations, I hope we can \r\nmake up for lost ground and achieve the progress that \r\nBrussels envisioned. \r\n The President: I would now like to draw \r\nattention to some organizational matters pertaining to \r\nthe conduct of the meeting. \r\n In order to accommodate all the 78 speakers \r\ninscribed on the list, I urge speakers to limit their \r\nstatements to no more than five minutes, on the \r\nunderstanding that this does not preclude the \r\ndistribution of more extensive texts. I further appeal to \r\nspeakers to deliver their statements at a normal speed \r\nwithin these time limits, so that interpretation may be \r\nproperly ensured. \r\n To assist speakers in managing their time, a light \r\nsystem has been installed at the speaker’s rostrum \r\nwhich operates as follows: a green light will be \r\nactivated at the start of the speaker’s statement; an \r\norange light will be activated 30 seconds before the \r\nend of the five minutes; and a red light will be \r\nactivated when the five-minute limit has been reached. \r\n Furthermore, in order to avoid disruption for the \r\nspeakers, I would request participants to remain in \r\ntheir seats after a statement has been delivered. \r\n The Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Boni Yayi, President of the Republic of \r\nBenin and Chairman of the group of Least Developed \r\nCountries. \r\n President Yayi (spoke in French): As Chairman \r\nof the Least Developed Countries Coordination \r\nBureau, I would like to congratulate you warmly, \r\nMadam, upon your election to the presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at the sixty-first session. I am \r\ncertain that under your leadership the work of the \r\nAssembly will be crowned with success. \r\n This High-level Meeting gives me the \r\nopportunity, for the first time since becoming President \r\nof the Republic of Benin, to address the General \r\nAssembly. I would like to pay deserved tribute to all \r\nthe eminent individuals who have contributed to \r\npromoting peace, security and harmonious \r\ndevelopment in the world. Benin has always been \r\ncommitted to those values and continues more than \r\never to be one of the most ardent and devoted \r\nadvocates of the United Nations. \r\n With a view to finding a solution to the specific \r\nproblems of the least developed countries (LDCs), the \r\ninternational community adopted the Programme of \r\nAction for the Least Developed Countries for the \r\nDecade 2001-2010 on 20 May 2001 at Brussels, in a \r\nspirit of responsibility and solidarity. The Programme \r\nof Action will promote development, and, if correctly \r\nimplemented, will enable those countries to lay a better \r\nfoundation for their own development and to create and \r\nmaintain propitious conditions for growth. \r\n At the time of the Programme’s adoption, it was \r\ndecided to carry out a midterm comprehensive global \r\nreview of its implementation and identify any problems \r\nor difficulties encountered in order to find a better way \r\nto achieving the agreed goals. Therefore, and in \r\naccordance with the relevant resolutions of the General \r\nAssembly, we are meeting here in New York to review \r\nwith courage and a sense of responsibility the \r\nimplementation of the Brussels Programme of Action \r\nadopted five years ago and which at that time raised \r\nthe hope of our peoples — the inhabitants of our cities \r\nand countrysides — that they would be able finally to \r\nbreak the vicious circle of poverty. \r\n Implementation of the Brussels Programme of \r\nAction has made it possible for several LDCs to make \r\nprogress in several sectors. I am pleased that some \r\nhave recorded clear progress despite an extremely \r\ndifficult international economic context, as \r\nMr. Malloch Brown has acknowledged. We are pleased \r\n A/61/PV.7\r\n \r\n5 06-52559 \r\n \r\nby the progress, specifically in the fields of health, \r\neducation and infrastructure creation. Social indicators \r\nsuch as gender equality have improved, even though \r\nthey remain among the lowest in the world. \r\n As for macroeconomic results, LDCs have \r\nincreased their average annual gross domestic product \r\ngrowth rate compared to the past, even though this is \r\nfar below the overall goal of 7 per cent set for our \r\ncountries by the Brussels Programme of Action. \r\nInflation was held in check in most cases, and the same \r\nwas true for public deficits, owing to appropriate \r\nfinancial and economic policies. Quantitative progress \r\nwas also made concerning official development \r\nassistance. In addition, as members know, there have \r\nbeen many proposals to cancel the debt of certain \r\nLDCs, including steps recently taken at the Group of \r\nEight summit held at Gleneagles, Scotland, in 2005. \r\n We welcome the fact that several of our partners \r\nare making great efforts to support us in the \r\nimplementation of the Brussels Action Programme. On \r\nbehalf of the group of Least Developed Countries, I \r\nwould like to express our sincere appreciation. \r\n It is clear that progress has been made here and \r\nthere, but overall implementation of the Programme of \r\nAction has not produced the results expected. That \r\nstate of affairs gave rise to the comments at the 2006 \r\nsubstantive session of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil, where it was observed that the Programme of \r\nAction had shown a very low rate of implementation \r\nsince its adoption. Many LDCs continue to face the \r\nsame difficulties as those that existed at the time of the \r\nadoption of the Programme of Action in 2001. \r\n The terms of trade for the main exports of the \r\nLDCs continue to deteriorate. In certain areas where \r\nour exports are already in jeopardy because of the \r\ndeterioration of the terms of trade, our economies are \r\nvictims of asymmetries in the multilateral trading \r\nsystem, owing to practices of certain developed \r\ncountries which are contrary to accepted international \r\ntrade practices. I am thinking in particular of cotton. As \r\nyou know, some partner countries of the LDCs greatly \r\nsubsidize cotton production in their own countries. \r\nThose subsidies have dramatic — I emphasize \r\ndramatic — impacts in our countries and contribute to \r\nthe worsening of poverty. \r\n International trade should drive development, as \r\nProfessor Stiglitz has stressed. Instead, it contributes to \r\nthe weakening of LDC capacity to generate resources, \r\nresulting in the non-sustainability and non-viability of \r\nour countries debts. Our urgent and exceptional needs \r\nfor financing have thus increased and we can no longer \r\nmeet those needs by relying on our own capacity to \r\nmobilize financing. That seriously jeopardizes the \r\nputting in place of basic infrastructure, while in so \r\ndifficult an environment good governance and respect \r\nfor fundamental rights and freedoms are constantly at \r\nrisk. \r\n The deep conviction of the LDCs is that \r\ndemocracy has no future, that there is no prospect for \r\ndemocracy in our countries unless it is concomitant \r\nwith sustained economic growth. I repeat — we are \r\ndeeply convinced that there is no prospect, no future \r\nfor democracy in our countries if it does not go hand in \r\nhand with sustained economic development.  \r\n This meeting must enable us to give fresh \r\nmomentum to the implementation of the Programme of \r\nAction, by identifying action that would enable us to \r\nbring about rapid and concrete results, in order to reach \r\nthe agreed goals within the prescribed time limits. In \r\nthat connection, the LDCs have already embarked on \r\ntheir own on the task of identifying the difficulties \r\nlinked to the implementation of the Programme of \r\nAction. They have reached conclusions that they have \r\nexamined together with their development partners, in \r\norder to arrive at appropriate solutions. \r\n We are gratified that the spirit of mutual \r\nconsultation and indeed collaboration exists in the \r\ncontext of international solidarity and cooperation. I \r\ncan assure you that the LDCs are aware that, if their \r\naction is to be effective and lasting, they must \r\nuntiringly continue to make strides in the areas of \r\ndemocracy, good governance, respect for the rule of \r\nlaw, the fight against corruption, the building of peace \r\nand domestic security and the reform and strengthening \r\nof their institutions.  \r\n I would like to take this opportunity to remind the \r\ninternational community that the LDCs are resolved to \r\nplay a leadership role on the basis of a shared vision to \r\nlead their countries towards the implementation of the \r\nDevelopment Goals — in particular, through regional \r\nintegration strategies. However, those efforts require \r\nthe creation of an environment conducive to the \r\nstrengthening of our production capacities in order for \r\nus to become more competitive, and to stimulate the \r\nsustained growth of our economies. \r\nA/61/PV.7  \r\n \r\n06-52559 6 \r\n \r\n To that end, it is crucial for all of the actors in the \r\ninternational community to join their efforts to reduce \r\nthe strong dependence of the LDC economies on the \r\ncost of commodities on the international market. We \r\nmust seek to diversify their export products, seek \r\nexternal financing and mobilize domestic resources \r\nthrough savings and national investments. \r\n We will all have to work so that the results we \r\nobtain have a direct impact on the eradication of \r\npoverty — that stubborn, recurring reality that persists \r\nwithin the LDCs. \r\n Thought should accordingly be given, among our \r\nmethods of action, to the establishment of a more \r\nappropriate evaluation mechanism so that we can \r\nquantify our efforts — the efforts of each and all of us, \r\nyear after year.  \r\n I have the pleasure to state that the goals set out \r\nin the Brussels Programme of Action are the \r\nMillennium Development Goals — those that are \r\nspecific to LDCs. For that reason I would like to invite \r\nour development partners to truly, and better than in \r\nthe past, support our LDCs in achieving those goals. \r\nTherefore, the LDCs invite the Secretary-General — \r\nand we welcome his untiring efforts thus far, and \r\nwould like his Special Representative to convey our \r\nthanks to him — to monitor, on the ground, the \r\nimplementation of the Brussels Programme of Action \r\nso that we can attain the agreed goals within the \r\nprescribed time frame. \r\n I cannot conclude my statement without urging us \r\nall to embark on concerted action, with all stakeholders \r\ninvolved, in the implementation of the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action, in a spirit of active solidarity, \r\nkeenly aware of the historic and human responsibility \r\nthat is ours at this crucial stage in the development of \r\nthe least developed countries.  \r\n Long live solidarity among the least developed \r\ncountries. Long live the United Nations. Long live \r\ninternational cooperation in the service of \r\ndevelopment. \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Maumoon Abdul \r\nGayoom, President of the Republic of Maldives. \r\n President Abdul Gayoom: First, I apologize for \r\nmy voice this morning, which is not pleasant. Having \r\njust arrived in New York from the Caribbean, I am not \r\nsure whether I can truthfully say that what I have is a \r\ncold. Having said that, let me turn to the issue at hand. \r\n(spoke in Arabic)  \r\n As this is the first time that I am addressing this \r\nAssembly, let me congratulate you, Madam, on your \r\nelection to preside over the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-first session. There can be no doubt that your \r\nelection to this high-level post is due to your broad \r\nexperience in international affairs. I can assure you that \r\nour delegation will work with you unstintingly so that \r\nyou may carry our your important mission successfully. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n The goal of the Brussels Programme of Action, \r\nwhich was adopted six years ago, was to advance the \r\nsocial and economic development of the poorest and \r\nweakest segment of the international community. In the \r\ntime since, the progress made has been very slow. \r\nDespite some achievements, much remains unfulfilled. \r\n I would like to note the tireless efforts of His \r\nExcellency Mr. Boni Yayi, President of the Republic of \r\nBenin, as Chairman of the group of Least Developed \r\nCountries, and those of the High Representative for the \r\nLeast Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing \r\nCountries and Small Island Developing States, \r\nMr. Anwarul K. Chowdhury, in pursuing the \r\nimplementation of the Brussels Programme of Action. \r\n While the national actions of the least developed \r\ncountries (LDCs) themselves must be geared towards \r\nachieving the goals of the Programme of Action, they \r\nconstitute only half of the story. The other half requires \r\nthe realization of the support pledged by the donor \r\ncommunity to ensure continuous development of the \r\nLDCs. I regret to say that, often, certain realities are \r\nhidden behind a veil of excuses for not letting such \r\nsupport flow in the direction of those desperately in \r\nneed of it. That is to say, while the LDCs are striving to \r\nadvance their development by exhausting the domestic \r\nresources that they mobilize, it is often charged by the \r\ndonor community that adequate domestic effort has not \r\nbeen made. That is not always the case. \r\n Low per capita income, poor public finance \r\ninfrastructure and the absence of capital accumulation \r\nall contribute to the domestic resource gap. Therefore, \r\ncontinued donor support is crucial for the \r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action. \r\n A/61/PV.7\r\n \r\n7 06-52559 \r\n \r\n In 2008, my country will embark upon its smooth \r\ntransition period. In 2011, we will graduate from the \r\nlist of the least developed countries. Despite significant \r\nobstacles to development, the Maldives has been able \r\nto achieve much by supplementing domestic effort with \r\ndonor assistance. \r\n The Maldives has already attained many of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. Extreme poverty has \r\nbeen halved and universal primary education has been \r\nachieved. As for the targets on reducing child \r\nmortality, attaining greater gender equality and \r\nimproving maternal health, I am pleased to say that the \r\nMaldives is on target to achieving those goals as well. \r\n In that regard, the Maldives has come a long way \r\ntowards realizing the guiding principle that only \r\npositive concrete processes and outcomes can sustain \r\npublic confidence in the development partnership \r\nbetween LDCs and their development partners. \r\n However, we are still a small and vulnerable \r\neconomy with a fragile environment. Our supply side \r\nconstraints persist due to limited opportunities to \r\nexpand our domestic markets. Increased aid is \r\nnecessary; but that is not sufficient. Rapid growth in \r\ntrade and increased market access are crucial for our \r\nsustainable economic development. Any failure of the \r\ncurrent round of trade negotiations would inevitably \r\nundermine the backbone of the Brussels Programme of \r\nAction by crippling the possibilities of accelerated \r\nLDC growth in terms of enhanced world trade and \r\nglobal financial and investment flows.  \r\n The list of the LDCs keeps growing. With the \r\nhigh speed of globalization, the gap between the North \r\nand the South is ever increasing. Can the rich afford to \r\nhelp the poor? The answer is incredibly simple. As \r\nProfessor Jeffrey Sachs, the author of The End of \r\nPoverty puts it, the question is not whether the rich can \r\nafford to help the poor, but whether they can afford not \r\nto. \r\n I firmly believe that there is no better time than \r\nnow to redeem the commitments laid down in the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi, Prime \r\nMinister, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for \r\nFinance of the Independent State of Samoa. \r\n Mr. Malielegaoi (Samoa): Samoa warmly \r\ncongratulates you, Madam, on the assumption of the \r\npresidency of the Assembly at its sixty-first session, \r\nand of this High-level Meeting to review the \r\nimplementation of the Brussels Programme of Action \r\nfor the least developed countries. I would also like to \r\npay tribute to your predecessor as President, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Jan Eliasson, for his sterling leadership \r\nof the sixtieth session. \r\n Our gathering here today illustrates our collective \r\ncommitment to address the plight of the least \r\ndeveloped countries (LDCs), to lift them out of poverty \r\nand to assist in their sustainable development efforts. \r\nAt this midterm review, it is a time for all of us to \r\ncritically reflect on how we have progressed in our \r\nnational, regional and international efforts to shift our \r\ncountries out of poverty and to be active players in this \r\nera of globalization. It is also incumbent upon us to \r\nidentify remaining challenges to the implementation of \r\nthe Brussels Programme of Action and to formulate \r\nappropriate recommendations to achieve the goals and \r\nobjectives of the plan. \r\n Samoa has consistently been a part of this review \r\nprocess since 2000, through the submission of its \r\nannual reports and participation in regional reviews \r\nand ministerial high-level consultations. At this \r\njuncture, I would like to thank the Office of the High \r\nRepresentative for the Least Developed Countries, \r\nLandlocked Developing Countries and Small Island \r\nDeveloping States for coordinating global overviews to \r\ntrack progress in where we are in the implementation \r\nof the plan. \r\n It is unfortunate to note that at the end of the \r\nreview, it is clear that while much progress has been \r\nachieved by many LDCs in various areas of the seven \r\ncommitments of the plan, stagnation is still evident \r\namong most of the LDCs. Many challenges remain, \r\nsome of them presenting formidable undertakings for a \r\nnumber of LDCs. \r\n We welcome in that regard the elaboration of the \r\nCotonou Strategy for the Further Implementation of the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action, not only because the \r\nStrategy provides an analytical snapshot of the current \r\nstatus of achievements in LDCs, but, most important, \r\nbecause it identifies the remaining challenges and \r\nrecommends actions to be taken by LDCs in \r\ncollaboration with development partners.  \r\n On behalf of my Government and the people of \r\nSamoa, I would like to acknowledge with appreciation \r\nthe contributions of our traditional development \r\nA/61/PV.7  \r\n \r\n06-52559 8 \r\n \r\npartners. I am pleased to say that in the case of my \r\ncountry, the partnerships are genuine and needs-\r\nfocused, actively executed towards national ownership \r\nand managed well and in a timely manner in order to \r\nachieve aid effectiveness. It is also an integrated \r\nparticipatory process that harnesses the strengths of \r\nnon-governmental organizations, and in particular the \r\nprivate sector, in all facets of development planning. \r\nAs a least developed country, Samoa is determined to \r\nmeet the remaining challenges, secure in the \r\nknowledge that our partners are with us all the way to \r\nprovide support whenever needed.  \r\n As members are aware, Samoa has been \r\nconsidered for graduation from the list of LDCs. While \r\nthat may be a positive reflection of our endeavours to \r\nimprove the lives of our people, we are concerned that \r\nit may be premature and would undermine our \r\nachievements to date. The data before the Economic \r\nand Social Council indicate that my country has \r\nperformed well in two of the LDC graduation criteria, \r\nnamely gross national income and the human assets \r\nindex. However, the data also show that Samoa’s \r\nperformance under the economic vulnerability index \r\nremains poor and that it is one of the most \r\neconomically vulnerable countries in the world. The \r\nUnited Nations Development Advisory Team, in its \r\nvulnerability profile report on Samoa to the Committee \r\nfor Development Policy of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil clearly mentions this, and the Committee for \r\nDevelopment Policy itself acknowledges it. Moreover, \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 59/209, on the smooth \r\ntransition strategy, states that graduating from the least \r\ndeveloped countries should not result in a disruption of \r\ndevelopment plans, programmes and projects. \r\n It is therefore imperative, in our view, that careful \r\nconsideration be given to the areas of vulnerability to \r\nensure that the sustainability and robustness of our \r\nmodest achievement, consolidated over the years, are \r\nable to withstand the impacts of external shocks. I \r\nwould like to reiterate, therefore, our request for the \r\nGeneral Assembly to favourably consider the \r\ndeferment of Samoa’s graduation from the list of LDCs \r\nuntil Samoa’s vulnerability profile meets the threshold \r\nlevel of the economic vulnerability index. \r\n Samoa cannot overemphasize the double \r\ndisadvantage of being a least developed country as a \r\nwell as a very small island developing State; the impact \r\nof any adverse event is felt throughout the country. \r\nEvery year, we endure cyclones or floods. Our \r\ndependence on imports, our single-product export \r\nconcentration and our limited industries and overseas \r\nmarkets are well known. Our structural vulnerability \r\nwill continuously generate challenges that have \r\nsystemic effects on our economy. External shocks, \r\nincluding the current oil price hike, resound throughout \r\nour country and impact investment and infrastructural \r\ndevelopment — indeed, the daily lives of our people. \r\n Samoa is dependent on a few sources of income \r\nsuch as remittances, agriculture, fisheries, tourism, \r\nservices and an infinitesimal manufacturing sector. \r\nSamoa is extremely vulnerable to climate change. We \r\nhave experienced 16 cyclones in the past 25 years. The \r\nresulting immediate effects include powerful economic \r\nand social shocks on the agricultural and export \r\nsectors, tourism, food security, property and \r\ninfrastructure that are still felt years after any cyclone. \r\n Those vulnerabilities and challenges \r\nnotwithstanding, our modest achievements to date are \r\nprimarily a result of the stringent utilization of \r\nassistance that comes to Samoa by virtue of its LDC \r\nstatus and through prudent planning and people-centred \r\nfinancial and economic policies. Largely through our \r\nLDC status, Samoa has been fortunate enough to \r\nparticipate in many regional and international \r\nconsultations and meetings. Our LDC status has also \r\nafforded us many training programmes for building and \r\nstrengthening capacity. Our financial contributions to \r\nmany international and regional organizations are also \r\naffordable to us only because of our LDC status. Loans \r\nat concessionary and competitive rates are granted in \r\nrecognition of that fact. \r\n Samoa’s progress and relative success to date \r\nbelie the extent of our country’s true vulnerability to \r\nexternal factors beyond our control, due to dependence \r\non tourism and remittances. The question of graduation \r\nclearly underscores the island paradox that we now \r\nfind ourselves in. \r\n I would like to assure Members of the United \r\nNations that it is not our intention to challenge the \r\ngraduation criteria. Nor do we challenge the proposal \r\nthat my country graduate. Rather, I request the General \r\nAssembly to look at the reality of a least developed \r\ncountry and a very small island developing State, and \r\nto carefully consider the areas of vulnerability so that \r\nour modest development progress thus far will not be \r\nreversed. Indeed, economic catastrophes following \r\ndevastating cyclones and man-made disasters beyond \r\n A/61/PV.7\r\n \r\n9 06-52559 \r\n \r\nour control are realities of our times that hardly require \r\nfurther justification. \r\n I appeal to Member States’ sense of pragmatism \r\nand logic to review the graduation rule to make \r\nperformance on the economic vulnerability index one \r\nof the key criteria to be met before graduation from the \r\nLDC. Accordingly, on behalf of my Government and \r\nthe people of Samoa, I request that the graduation of \r\nSamoa from the list of LDCs be reconsidered until the \r\nissue of economic vulnerability is included as one of \r\nthe key criteria to be met. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Lyonpo Sangay Ngedup, Prime \r\nMinister and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of \r\nthe Kingdom of Bhutan. \r\n Mr. Ngedup (Bhutan): Please accept my \r\ndelegation’s warmest felicitations, Madam, upon your \r\nelection to the high office of president of the sixty-first \r\nsession of the General Assembly.  \r\n My delegation welcomes the midterm review of \r\nthe Brussels Programme of Action for the Least \r\nDeveloped Countries (LDCs). There is no denying that \r\nprogress in the implementation of the Programme of \r\nAction has been unsatisfactory so far; unless greater \r\nefforts are exerted, the prospect of realizing its goals \r\nand objectives by the target year of 2013 will be \r\nbeyond reach. It is, therefore, our sincere hope that the \r\nreview will engender renewed commitment and \r\ndecisive action by all stakeholders for the remaining \r\nfive years of the Programme period. \r\n My delegation welcomes the increase in official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) over the past few years. \r\nHowever, significant portions of it are concentrated in \r\na few countries, and in real terms, ODA has declined in \r\nalmost half of the LDCs. ODA is a lifeline for LDCs, \r\nand for countries like mine constitutes the primary \r\nresource for development. We appeal to all countries to \r\ndeliver on their aid commitment of 0.7 per cent of \r\ngross national income and to allocate 0.15 to 0.20 per \r\ncent gross national income to the LDCs. This is a just \r\nappeal, as LDCs make up more than one third of the \r\nStates Members of the United Nations. We commend \r\ncountries that have fulfilled their ODA commitments \r\nunder the Monterrey Consensus, which was reaffirmed \r\nat the 2005 World Summit, and we urge others to do \r\nso. \r\n My delegation welcomes the 2005 Paris \r\nDeclaration on Aid Effectiveness, which places \r\nrecipient countries at the centre of development \r\nassistance. It is imperative that interventions be \r\ncountry-driven and ODA-untied for effective \r\nutilization.  \r\n Similarly, we welcome the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport on resource mobilization in the context of the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action, which highlights the \r\nneed to strengthen country ownership and genuine \r\npartnership between donor and recipient countries. The \r\nCotonou Strategy represents an effort towards \r\nownership and partnership, and it is our hope that the \r\nStrategy will be fully supported. Among the concerns \r\nhighlighted by the least developed countries (LDCs) \r\nduring the course of preparations for the midterm \r\nreview is the emphasis by development partners on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). The MDGs, \r\nnotwithstanding their importance, have overshadowed \r\nthe commitments to the Brussels Programme of Action \r\ninsofar as resource commitments at the programme \r\nlevel are concerned. My delegation believes that the \r\nProgramme of Action and the MDGs are compatible \r\nand complementary, and it requests development \r\npartners to take a similar view and accord equal \r\ntreatment.  \r\n We join others in welcoming the agreement \r\nreached at the Hong Kong World Trade Organization \r\n(WTO) Ministerial Meeting on duty-free and quota-\r\nfree market access for all products originating from \r\nLDCs by 2008. That is a significant measure that \r\nshould have far-reaching benefits for LDCs. \r\n Bhutan is fully committed to the Programme of \r\nAction and is making concerted efforts towards its \r\nimplementation. The Royal Government has integrated \r\nthe Programme’s goals and objectives into its \r\ndevelopment plans and long-term strategies. The seven \r\nbroad commitments highlighted in the Programme are \r\nin consonance with our development philosophy of \r\n“gross national happiness”. That philosophy places \r\npeople at the centre of development and strives to \r\npromote good governance, equitable socio-economic \r\ngrowth, environmental conservation and spiritual and \r\ncultural growth. \r\n Concrete steps have been taken to enhance good \r\ngovernance in the country. Recently, an extensive \r\nreview entitled “Good governance plus” was carried \r\nout, resulting in over 200 recommendations that are \r\nA/61/PV.7  \r\n \r\n06-52559 10 \r\n \r\ncurrently being implemented. As a result, future five-\r\nyear development plans will see significant planning \r\nand fiscal management reforms. Our plans will be \r\nMDG-based and therefore result-oriented. It was \r\nindeed a proud moment for us in Bhutan when our \r\nefforts towards good governance were recognized with \r\nthe Asia-Pacific best country practice in aid \r\nmanagement award during a recent workshop entitled \r\n“From Paris to Practice”, held at Bangkok. More \r\nsignificantly, Bhutan is poised for a historic political \r\nchange in 2008, when parliamentary democracy will be \r\nintroduced. \r\n Our country’s economy continues to grow at an \r\naverage annual rate of 6 to 7 per cent. We are \r\njudiciously harnessing the one renewable energy \r\nresource that the country has in abundance: \r\nhydropower is today our main source of revenue. The \r\nprivate sector in the country is being vigorously \r\npromoted as the engine of growth. Many enabling \r\npolicy instruments have been adopted, and we have \r\nmade significant progress in our negotiations for \r\naccession to the WTO. \r\n We have ensured that our economic growth is not \r\nachieved at the cost of the natural environment, to \r\nwhose protection we accord high priority. Our \r\necological footprint is small, and policies and laws are \r\nin place to ensure that it remains that way. At the same \r\ntime, growth has not come at the expense of the social \r\nsector, which continues to receive the largest share of \r\nour annual budget. Last year, our achievement in \r\nenvironmental conservation was recognized by the \r\nUnited Nations Environment Programme Champions of \r\nthe Earth Award for 2005, which was conferred on His \r\nMajesty the King and the people of Bhutan. Next \r\nmonth, the J. Paul Getty Conservation Leadership \r\nAward is also being awarded to His Majesty the King \r\nand the people of Bhutan. We appreciate the \r\ninternational community’s recognition of our \r\nconservation efforts. \r\n Our efforts are persistently challenged by the \r\nmany constraints we face as an LDC. Lack of adequate \r\nand predictable funding to finance progress towards \r\nour development goals is the most serious one. We \r\nhave been fortunate to receive the support and \r\nassistance of many bilateral and multilateral partners, \r\nand it is our hope that that will continue and be further \r\nenhanced in the future. As I mentioned earlier, Bhutan \r\nis in a critical political transition, and our success in \r\nthat process will, to a large extent, depend on our \r\nability to maintain and enhance current levels of socio-\r\neconomic development. \r\n My delegation would like to express our deep \r\nappreciation to all our development partners, both \r\nbilateral and multilateral, for the generous support they \r\nhave provided to us. We take note of the valuable work \r\nthat the Office of the High Representative for Least \r\nDeveloped Countries, Landlocked Developing \r\nCountries and Small Island Developing States is doing \r\nto support the efforts of those disadvantaged groups of \r\ncountries. We hope that this will continue through \r\nprovision of increased resources to the Office. \r\n In conclusion, I wish to emphasize that the need \r\nof the hour is not to search for new solutions. The need \r\nis to undertake the straight forward tasks of working \r\ntogether to fulfil existing commitments and of taking \r\naction on the ground. Over the course of our meeting in \r\nthis affluent setting, we must not lose sight of the \r\nhuman tragedies unfolding every minute in the LDCs. \r\nLet us ensure that our deliberations today have a real \r\nand enduring impact on precious lives besieged by \r\npoverty and deprivation. \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by His Excellency The Right Honourable \r\nPakalitha Bethuel Mosisili, Prime Minister of the \r\nKingdom of Lesotho. \r\n Mr. Mosisili (Lesotho): At the outset, Madam, \r\nallow me to join previous speakers in congratulating \r\nyou on your election to the presidency of this session. \r\nIn the same breath, I wish to extend our compliments \r\nto your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson \r\nof Sweden, and to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi \r\nAnnan, for a job well done. \r\n Thirty-five years ago, when the group of least \r\ndeveloped countries (LDCs) was first established, there \r\nwere 24 countries classified as least developed. Today, \r\nthe number has increased to 50. Perhaps this sharp \r\nincrease indicates the failure of the international \r\ncommunity to take urgent and effective action to arrest \r\nand reverse the deterioration in the socio-economic \r\nsituation of the least developed countries and to \r\nrevitalize their growth and development.  \r\n For their part, the least developed countries \r\nundertook to deepen the process of economic reform \r\nwhich they had begun about two decades ago, while \r\ntheir development partners undertook to make \r\n A/61/PV.7\r\n \r\n11 06-52559 \r\n \r\navailable a significant and substantial aggregate \r\nincrease in external support. \r\n This High-level Meeting constitutes a unique \r\nopportunity for introspection, following commitments \r\nmade in implementation of the outcomes of major \r\nUnited Nations summits and conferences in the \r\neconomic, social and related fields, including the Third \r\nUnited Nations Conference on the Least Developed \r\nCountries. It is a fitting opportunity to consolidate the \r\ngains made in the past and to take stock of this \r\ncollective journey by sharing our concerns and \r\nvaluable insights. \r\n In line with the theme for the midterm \r\ncomprehensive global review — namely, the \r\nProgramme of Action for the Least Developed \r\nCountries for the Decade 2001-2010: Redeeming the \r\ncommitments — we aim to contribute to the debate by \r\nsharing with members the issues Lesotho considers \r\ncritical to the current international effort to eradicate \r\npoverty. \r\n The war on poverty and inequality is far from \r\nbeing won. Many developing countries, particularly the \r\nleast developed countries, continue to be marginalized. \r\nWe in Africa are at a crossroads and continue to \r\nregister the highest number of poor people. Sub-\r\nSaharan Africa, home to 34 least developed countries, \r\nis the only region of the world where poverty has, in \r\nfact, deepened in recent years. Although 13 per cent of \r\nthe world’s population lives in Africa, the continent \r\naccounts for 28 per cent of world poverty. \r\n For us in Lesotho, the single greatest obstacle to \r\nthe development of our nation, and indeed to reaching \r\nthe objectives of the Brussels Programme of Action \r\nand the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), is \r\nthe scourge of HIV/AIDS. We are overwhelmed by the \r\nhigh levels of morbidity and mortality, especially \r\namong people of working age. HIV/AIDS has emerged \r\nas a major threat to development, reversing all the \r\ngains that have been made and ushering in the new \r\nsocio-economic phenomenon of orphans on an \r\nunprecedented scale. \r\n Despite the foregoing, we wish to put on record \r\nthat, with the cooperation that the Government of \r\nLesotho is enjoying from Basotho across the spectrum, \r\nas well as the support from our development partners, \r\nwe are convinced that we will win the war against this \r\npandemic. \r\n My delegation reiterates the call for increased \r\nsupport to the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD).  \r\n We commend the efforts of the donor countries \r\nthat have achieved the 0.7 and 0.2 per cent target of \r\ngross national income for least developed countries as \r\nofficial development assistance (ODA). We commend \r\nalso the initiatives taken by some of those countries to \r\nset up timetables for fulfilling their ODA targets. \r\nHowever, we wish to once again reiterate our appeal to \r\nthe developed countries to abide by their commitments \r\nto help developing countries in all relevant areas. \r\n In this context, special mention must be made of, \r\nand indeed, commendation given to, the United States \r\nGovernment’s initiatives, such as the African Growth \r\nand Opportunities Act and the Millennium Challenge \r\nCorporation. Clearly, without new inflows of external \r\nresources, development in Africa will forever remain \r\nstunted and stagnating.  \r\n We also wish to express our sincere appreciation \r\nfor all initiatives taken recently to address the needs of \r\ndeveloping countries, especially the debt cancellation \r\nextended by the Group of Eight to the highly indebted \r\npoor countries. However, we appeal for debt \r\ncancellation for all least developed countries in order \r\nto enable them to redirect their meagre resources into \r\ntheir economies. The fact that countries such as \r\nLesotho have been able to service their debts \r\nefficiently and therefore do not fall within the category \r\nof highly indebted poor countries cannot and must not \r\nbe used to their disadvantage. Real economic growth \r\ncan be realized only if we all benefit from debt \r\ncancellation. \r\n Both the MDGs and the Brussels Programme of \r\nAction for the Least Developed Countries are \r\nintertwined. Indeed, most of the MDG targets, such as \r\npoverty eradication, improved health and basic \r\neducation, are also embedded in the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action. We are therefore deeply \r\nconcerned that the 2005 Millennium Review Summit \r\nOutcome Document did not focus on progress relating \r\nto the achievement of the MDGs or issues of \r\ndevelopment, which, in our view, are the main \r\nconcerns for Africa and for the least developed \r\ncountries in particular. \r\n In conclusion, it is our strong conviction that, for \r\nthe least developed countries to eradicate poverty, the \r\ninternational community must give the development \r\nA/61/PV.7  \r\n \r\n06-52559 12 \r\n \r\nagenda the attention it deserves. If their special needs \r\nare not addressed by all concerned, the least developed \r\ncountries will not be able to achieve the objectives of \r\nthe Brussels Programme of Action, or the MDGs, by \r\n2015. \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Didjob Divungi Di \r\nNdingi, Vice-President of the Gabonese Republic. \r\n Mr. Divungi Di Ndingi (Gabon) (spoke in \r\nFrench): It is a tremendous honour and a genuine \r\npleasure for me to address the Assembly at this High-\r\nlevel Meeting on the midterm review of the Programme \r\nof Action for the Least Developed Countries for the \r\nDecade 2001-2010. \r\n However, Madam President, before I go on, allow \r\nme once again, on behalf of His Excellency El Hadj \r\nOmar Bongo Ondimba, President of the Gabonese \r\nRepublic, to commend you on your well-deserved \r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-first session. \r\n I would like also to take this opportunity to pay a \r\nwell-earned tribute to Secretary-General Kofi Annan \r\nand to convey to him our gratitude for his resolute \r\nefforts. \r\n The adoption of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals, emanating from the Millennium Declaration, \r\nwas a milestone in the history of our Organization. For \r\nthe first time, we committed ourselves to addressing on \r\nall fronts the issues of peace, development and human \r\nrights. Those Goals galvanized like never before \r\npeople of goodwill concerned with meeting the needs \r\nof the world’s poorest men, women and children. \r\n Indeed, the urgent need to fight poverty \r\nworldwide, as well as the possibilities offered by the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, have become a real \r\nrallying point for a global partnership and the \r\ncornerstone of development strategies at the \r\ninternational and regional levels. \r\n We all agreed on shared priorities with the aim of \r\nfinding solutions to the many aspects of abject poverty, \r\nnamely hunger, unemployment, disease, substandard \r\nhousing, gender inequalities and environmental \r\ndeterioration. The Governments of developed and \r\ndeveloping countries have undertaken to provide the \r\nnecessary resources and to implement appropriate \r\npolicies in order to achieve those Goals. MDG 8 on \r\ndevelopment refers to the least developed countries, \r\nwhich led to the Brussels Declaration and Programme \r\nof Action for the Decade 2001-2010, which addresses \r\nthe specific needs of those countries. The Declaration \r\nsets out the principles for integration of the least \r\ndeveloped countries into the global economy while \r\ndefining an approach to problems related to sustainable \r\ndevelopment, respect for human rights, democracy, the \r\nrule of law, good governance, gender equality, \r\nemployment and capacity-building. \r\n Since May 2001, when the Brussels Declaration \r\nwas elaborated, progress has indeed been made by a \r\nnumber of countries and a number of regions, but, in \r\nmost of the least developed countries, millions of \r\npeople are sinking into poverty, particularly in sub-\r\nSaharan Africa. The vast majority of the population of \r\nthe developing world still lacks basic sanitary \r\nfacilities. Fewer than two thirds of children attend \r\nprimary school. Women are far from achieving equality \r\nof representation at the highest levels of Government. \r\nOne million children under the age of five die every \r\nyear from diseases that could have been treated. Giving \r\nbirth is still very dangerous and is attended by a high \r\nmaternal mortality rate. The fight against such scourges \r\nas AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis is draining national \r\neconomies. \r\n Sub-Saharan Africa, which includes the largest \r\nnumber of least developed countries, remains the \r\nepicentre of that grim picture. Overall, we see a \r\nconsiderable lag there in the implementation of most of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. Although Asia \r\nappears to be the region of the world enjoying the \r\ngreatest progress, hundreds of millions of people \r\ncontinue to live in poverty there. In countries enjoying \r\nthe most rapid growth, some non-monetary goals have \r\nnot yet been achieved. Other regions of the world, \r\nparticularly Latin America, the Middle East and North \r\nAfrica, have had mixed performances. Progress has \r\nbeen weak or non-existent in the implementation of \r\ncertain goals, and deep-rooted inequalities persist.  \r\n The midterm review of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals has highlighted weaknesses, often \r\nwithin our own countries, that hinder implementation. \r\nTo be sure, the average 6 per cent growth in the least \r\ndeveloped countries has not led to a reduction in \r\npoverty, which in many cases has even increased.  \r\n No single explanation applies to the success or \r\nfailure of such an undertaking. For every goal, each \r\nregion and country requires a painstaking analysis. At \r\n A/61/PV.7\r\n \r\n13 06-52559 \r\n \r\nthe same time, four causes can generally be identified: \r\nbad governance marked by corruption and mediocre \r\npolitical and economic choices; a lack of respect for \r\nhuman rights in certain regions around the world; the \r\ntrap of poverty, in which the economy does not allow \r\nthe necessary investment; and stubborn pockets of \r\npoverty in certain countries. \r\n The least developed countries are determined to \r\ntake appropriate measures to follow up on the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action. The creation of focal points to \r\nimplement the Programme of Action and the \r\nestablishment by the Secretary-General of the High \r\nRepresentative for the Least Developed Countries, \r\nLandlocked Developing Countries and Small Island \r\nDeveloping States will clearly provide better \r\ncoordination and follow-up to the Programme. Those \r\ncountries can achieve the goals set out in the Brussels \r\nDeclaration only if there are massive increases in \r\npublic investment in capacity-building, mobilized \r\nnational resources, and official development assistance. \r\nThat effort will need to be maintained at the global, \r\nnational and local levels until 2010.  \r\n The international community’s commitment \r\nseems to be clear. Measures taken by the Group of 8 in \r\nScotland with respect to debt cancellation for some of \r\nthe poorest countries, along with the initiatives of \r\ncertain countries with respect to innovative \r\ndevelopment financing sources, lead us to believe that \r\nthe momentum has been set in motion. In that regard, \r\nthere is a need for solidarity towards attaining just and \r\nsustainable development. We need in particular to \r\navoid taking the easy way out by claiming that we can \r\nreduce official development assistance by cancelling \r\nthe debt. Instead, we need here to reaffirm strongly and \r\nclearly the principle of additionality. \r\n The participation here of Gabon, which is not a \r\nleast developed country, demonstrates our solidarity \r\nand proves that, in many ways, we experience the same \r\nrealities and share the same concerns. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Thongloun Sisoulith, Deputy Prime \r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Lao \r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic. \r\n Mr. Sisoulith (Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic): Let me extend my warmest congratulations \r\nto you, Madam, on your election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at this important session. We trust \r\nthat your skills in multilateral diplomacy will lead this \r\nHigh-level Meeting to a successful conclusion.  \r\n Our delegation thanks the Secretary-General for \r\nhis annual progress report on the implementation of the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action for the least developed \r\ncountries (LDCs). The report contains useful \r\nconclusions and recommendations. \r\n We support the statement to be made by the \r\nrepresentative of South Africa, Chairman of the Group \r\nof 77, and that made by the representative of Benin, \r\nChairman of the LDCs Coordinating Bureau, which \r\nhighlight major progress made and constraints faced by \r\nLDCs in the implementation of the Programme of \r\nAction, and suggest holistic approaches for its more \r\neffective follow-up.  \r\n We also share the concern of the developing \r\ncountries over the lack of progress made in the \r\nimplementation of the seven commitments of the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action, despite some \r\naccomplishments achieved by both the LDCs and their \r\ndevelopment partners in implementing the actions \r\nassigned to them in the Programme Of Action. The \r\nreport indicates that the improvement in economic \r\ngrowth and human development in LDCs has been \r\nmodest. The LDCs are finding it very difficult to live \r\nup to their commitments. In order to reverse those \r\ntrends, therefore, the international community must \r\ntake the necessary steps to provide the LDCs with the \r\noverdue pledged resources to allow them to fulfil the \r\ncommitments set out in the Brussels Programme of \r\nAction and in the Millennium Development Goals.  \r\n The continuing support of the developed \r\ncountries, the United Nations system and the \r\ninternational financial and trade institutions is of \r\ncritical importance. That necessity was underlined in \r\nthe 2005 World Summit Outcome, as well as in the \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution to implement it. The \r\ndeclaration we are going to endorse at the end of this \r\nMeeting also reaffirms the validity of the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action commitments and calls for \r\ngreater efforts to be undertaken by all stakeholders to \r\nimplement them in a full, timely and effective manner. \r\n The Lao People’s Democratic Republic has \r\nspared no effort to translate its commitments into \r\naction. The Brussels Programme of Action was \r\nintegrated into the 10-Year Socio-Economic Strategy \r\n2001-2010, with emphasis on the promotion of rapid \r\nand sustained economic growth, poverty reduction and \r\nA/61/PV.7  \r\n \r\n06-52559 14 \r\n \r\nenvironmental protection. The fifth Five-Year National \r\nSocio-Economic Development Plan 2001-2005 and \r\nassociated annual plans were all considered to be the \r\nprimary tools for implementing the Strategy. \r\n Various measures have been taken to put those \r\nplans into practice. As a result, gross domestic product \r\n(GDP) has attained a steady increase averaging 6.3 per \r\ncent for the past five years. Overall investment rose \r\nsteadily from 19.7 per cent in 2000 to around 26.6 per \r\ncent in 2005. GDP per capita improved by almost $500 \r\nfor the same period and poverty decreased to 32 per \r\ncent in 2005 from 39 per cent in 1997.  \r\n To further its efforts to fight poverty and pursue \r\nsustainable development, the Government of the Lao \r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic launched in 2003 the \r\nNational Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy as a \r\nlocalized poverty reduction strategy paper. The \r\nobjective of the Strategy is to sustain economic growth \r\nand alleviate poverty. \r\n Furthermore, the recently adopted Sixth Five-\r\nYear Socio-economic Development Plan 2006-2010 \r\nconstitutes a framework aimed, first and foremost, at \r\nfully and effectively implementing all the goals and \r\ntargets of the National Growth and Poverty Eradication \r\nStrategy in pursuit of the vision of the country’s \r\ngraduating from the LDCs by 2020. \r\n Despite the positive developments, there remains \r\na lot more to be done by the Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic towards the fulfilment of its international \r\ncommitments. For the country to achieve further \r\nprogress in the implementation of the foregoing \r\nstrategies, greater coordinated financial and technical \r\nsupport is needed form the international community. \r\nWe trust that those felt needs of the Lao People’s \r\nDemocratic Republic will continue to be met \r\ngenerously and unconditionally in the form of \r\nunconditional official development assistance. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Sato Kilman, Deputy Prime Minister \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs of Vanuatu. \r\n Mr. Kilman (Vanuatu): My Government \r\nwelcomes the midterm review of the implementation of \r\nthe Brussels Programme of Action for the Least \r\nDeveloped Countries (LDCs) for the Decade 2001-\r\n2010. The Programme of Action provides goals and \r\ntargets, along with action-oriented commitments in \r\nseven critical areas, following a commitment from \r\nworld leaders to promote development in the LDCs. \r\nThroughout this year, various preparatory meetings and \r\nconsultations have been held, culminating in this High-\r\nlevel Meeting today.  \r\n At the halfway mark, implementation of the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action has been moderate. Our \r\nresolve in implementing measures needed to address \r\nthe peculiar issues of LDCs, of which five are located \r\nin the Pacific Ocean, have continued to be hampered \r\nby several key challenges. I refer here in particular to \r\nthe case of Vanuatu. \r\n Vanuatu’s performance in the implementation of \r\nthe Brussels Programme of Action is a mixed one, with \r\nsome progress in the implementation and achievement \r\nof agreed commitments and goals, while some are still \r\nyet to be realized. Already, it is obvious that some of \r\nthose will not be achieved within the agreed time \r\nframe. Nevertheless, Vanuatu will continue to pursue \r\nthem over the medium to long terms. \r\n The Vanuatu economy is dualistic in nature, with \r\na rural population of 80 per cent engaged in the \r\ninformal subsistence sector and the remaining 20 per \r\ncent in the formal sector. Vanuatu has an economy \r\nwhich is small in terms of size, resources, market and \r\nnational output. That smallness implies that its ability \r\nto compete internationally in the goods and services \r\nmarkets is limited and that the prospect of achieving \r\nhigh economic growth is unforeseeable in the near \r\nfuture. \r\n The major contributing sectors to gross domestic \r\nproduct (GDP) are the agriculture sector and the \r\nservices sector, with the services sector making the \r\nlargest contribution of 73 per cent of total GDP. \r\nAgriculture, however, continues to be the mainstay of \r\nthe economy, as the services sector relies, among other \r\nthings, heavily on the agriculture sector and the simple \r\nfact that 80 per cent of the population survive via \r\nengagement in that sector. \r\n The role of official development assistance and \r\nits impacts on GDP growth in Vanuatu are also \r\nfundamental and will continue to remain critical in \r\norder for Vanuatu to simultaneously address its \r\ndevelopment priorities and to advance progress in the \r\npursuit of the achievement of the Brussels Programme \r\nof Action initiatives. In that regard, my Government \r\ntherefore wishes to raise its concern in relation to the \r\nCommittee for Development Policy’s recommendation \r\non Vanuatu’s LDC graduation eligibility status. The \r\n A/61/PV.7\r\n \r\n15 06-52559 \r\n \r\nrecommendation for graduation eligibility is one we \r\nconsider to be premature. \r\n Measuring one’s eligibility status based on the \r\nmajor criteria of gross national income, the Human \r\nAssets Index and the economic vulnerability index, and \r\nmaking a recommendation based on the achievement of \r\nthe income and assets indices, despite a very high \r\neconomic vulnerability, especially in the case of \r\nVanuatu, is highly inappropriate, as the gross national \r\nincome factor is influenced directly by the economic \r\nvulnerability index and hence brings into question the \r\nsustainability of the aforementioned income threshold. \r\nThat is particularly true for countries like Vanuatu, \r\nwhich, simply because of its geographical location on \r\nthe Pacific rim of fire, remains highly vulnerable to \r\nnatural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, \r\nlandslides and hurricanes, to mention but a few that \r\noccur on a regular basis in my country, and each of \r\nwhich could destroy the nation’s economic mainstay \r\nand driver, the agriculture sector, in but a few hours or \r\ndays. \r\n In-depth analyses of the last eight years of \r\neconomic performance shows a mere 0.69 per cent \r\naverage real growth in gross domestic product — an \r\neconomic growth rate far below the 7 per cent target \r\nstipulated in the Brussels Programme of Action. \r\nTherefore, to recommend that Vanuatu be made eligible \r\nfor graduation from LDC status does not hold, as even \r\nthough it may allegedly satisfy the first two criteria, it \r\ndoes not satisfy the vulnerability criteria simply \r\nbecause those vulnerabilities are “acts of god” and \r\ncannot be controlled or predicted with any degree of \r\nreasonable certainty. \r\n Furthermore, the basis of the GDP per capita ratio \r\nsupposedly measures the wealth of the nation, but that \r\nin itself is prone to errors. The inaccuracies that exist, \r\nfirst, in the data collection mechanisms, and hence the \r\ndata itself, mean that this measurement cannot be \r\npronounced with any reasonable degree of certainty. In \r\naddition, the uses of bivariate statistics to derive an end \r\nresult do not give an entirely accurate picture, given \r\nthat they do not explore in detail the relationship \r\nbetween the cause and effect factors of each of the two \r\nvariables. \r\n GDP per capita, for instance, is simply GDP by \r\ntotal population and assumes that each and every \r\nmember of the population derives the same benefits as \r\nall the rest. As we all know, that is not true. In most \r\ncountries in the world, including developed nations, \r\napproximately 20 per cent of the population contributes \r\nto paying 70 to 80 per cent of the taxes, and more often \r\nthan not that same 20 per cent of the population derives \r\n80 per cent of all the benefits and incomes. This clearly \r\nindicates that, within any given population, there are \r\nincome disparities, and that means that to assume that \r\nGDP per capita measures the wealth of the nations is \r\nnot a fair representation of the actual distribution of \r\nwealth. To further base one’s recommendations on that \r\none fact alone does not do justice to the nation that is \r\nrequesting consideration of its views. \r\n In the Vanuatu context, the agriculture sector \r\ncontribution to the national GDP is a much fairer \r\nrepresentation of rural incomes. Hence, dividing total \r\nincome earned from the agriculture sector by the rural \r\npopulation gives rural income per capita, in 2005, at \r\n$263, which is very low as well as very volatile, due to \r\nthe vulnerable profile of the country. \r\n The use of gross national income as a measure of \r\na nation’s general economic welfare fails to highlight \r\nthe problem of the high income inequality that persists \r\nbetween the urban and rural populations, as well as \r\nbetween highly paid expatriates and lowly paid ni-\r\nVanuatu living in the urban areas. Therefore, my \r\nGovernment strongly believes that using an indicator \r\nsuch as the gross national income per capita conceals \r\nthe hardship and difficulties that prevail in the rural \r\ncommunities and which one cannot see through reading \r\nnumbers.  \r\n The impact of any decision on Vanuatu’s LDC \r\nstatus will surely be felt greatly by the majority of the \r\npopulation whose everyday lives are dependent on \r\nsubsistence agriculture. Additionally, though the \r\nservices sector contributes the highest to the GDP, it \r\nexperiences high leakages, as all service providers are \r\nforeign-owned, which results in the high profits made \r\nbeing repatriated overseas, with little investment of \r\nretained earnings in the domestic economy. \r\n The gross national income factor does indicate \r\nthe level of income available to the country. However, \r\ngiven the aforementioned undeniable facts, it is clear \r\nthat there are income distribution problems that could \r\neither be structural or policy-based inefficiencies; \r\nhence, we recommend that, even if the country does \r\nmeet the preconditions for graduation, it would be \r\nmore appropriate to also analyse the distribution of \r\nthose measures of status and to identify policy or \r\nA/61/PV.7  \r\n \r\n06-52559 16 \r\n \r\nstructural inefficiencies and to recommend remedial \r\ncourses of action to assist the country, with a specific \r\ntime frame for undertaking those reforms or adjustment \r\nprogrammes so that, when the country does graduate, it \r\nis able to sustain the conditions which triggered the \r\nchanges in status.  \r\n One must also look at what is driving and \r\nsustaining the GDP growth rates and is thus a better \r\nreflection of the sustainability of the gross national \r\nincome. More specifically, whether or not the growth is \r\ndriven by domestic production, consumption and \r\nexport growth, or whether the growth is triggered by \r\nsuch external factors as aid and foreign direct \r\ninvestment, they leave the country highly open to \r\nshocks caused by externalities. \r\n Vanuatu’s comparative advantage in terms of \r\ntrade hinges mainly on a few low-value primary sector \r\ncommodities, such as copra, cocoa, beef and kava, \r\nwhich have continued to show a progressive decline. \r\nOn the other hand, Vanuatu depends highly on higher-\r\nvalue imports, most of which are manufactured items, \r\nresulting in rising trade deficits in the recent years. \r\nFactors that have contributed to that decline in the \r\nterms of trade include the effects of natural disasters, \r\nmainly cyclones; volatility in world market prices, the \r\nuncertainty of which in commodity prices often leads \r\nto discouragement and low productivity; price-fixing \r\nby the Vanuatu Commodities Marketing Board, despite \r\nmovements in world commodity prices; and the \r\nEuropean ban on kava. \r\n Overall, Vanuatu’s exports have been very \r\nunstable due to the effects of natural disasters and \r\nexternal economic shocks. The smallness of the \r\neconomy implies that there is a limit to the country’s \r\nability to insulate itself from those economic shocks. \r\n The Human Asset Index also looks only at the \r\nstatistics, but does not actually look into issues of the \r\nquality of the education being provided. Simply \r\nlooking at the statistics of secondary school enrolment \r\nand completion rates does not provide a real measure \r\nof the asset element, as one needs to look at the quality \r\nof the asset more than at the actual quantity of the asset \r\nin order to have a much better comprehension of the \r\npotential productivity of that particular human asset. \r\nAgain, here the statistics are inaccurate, as the various \r\nreports that have been issued by international \r\ninstitutions — including this one — are inconsistent in \r\ntheir statements with respect to the level of literacy, \r\nwhich they place between 33 per cent and 99 per cent. \r\nOnce again, forming conclusions based on mere \r\nstatistics may be at best informative, but certainly not \r\nconclusive. \r\n Issues of remoteness, instability in agricultural \r\nproduction capacities due to natural disasters and \r\ninternational price fluctuations, the instability in \r\nexports of goods and services, market access, statistical \r\ndata inaccuracies and so forth are other areas on which \r\nI could expound further, but I believe that the message \r\nhas been heard. Given the aforementioned issues, the \r\nGovernment of Vanuatu strongly feels that Vanuatu is \r\nnot ready to graduate from its LDC status. Therefore, it \r\nis recommended that Vanuatu be immediately removed \r\nfrom the list of countries eligible for graduation. \r\n In conclusion, I wish to bring to the Assembly’s \r\nattention the fact that while the Committee for \r\nDevelopment Policy does have the mandate to make \r\nthose recommendations, as the change in one’s status \r\nalso raises questions and/or issues of potential \r\nfundamental changes and adjustments that may be \r\nrequired to a nation’s policies, the allocation of a five-\r\nminute time frame within which to plead one’s case \r\nbefore the plenary is wholly inappropriate. It is perhaps \r\na matter that requires some consideration and attention, \r\nas I do not think that this is a reflection or an \r\nimplication of the importance that this institution \r\nplaces on the LDC issue. \r\n Finally, I would like to express my Government’s \r\nappreciation to Benin, as the Chairman of the group of \r\nleast developed countries, and to the Office of the High \r\nRepresentative for the Least Developed Countries, \r\nLandlocked Developing Countries and Small Island \r\nDeveloping States, in particular Mr. Chowdhury, for \r\ntheir unwavering support for the LDCs. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I now give the \r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Ahmed Aboul Gheit, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Arab Republic of \r\nEgypt, who will speak on behalf of the African Group. \r\n Mr. Aboul Gheit (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): It \r\ngives me pleasure to address the General Assembly \r\ntoday not only on behalf of Egypt, but also on behalf of \r\nthe African Group at the United Nations, which Egypt \r\nhas the honour to preside over this month. Egypt has \r\nalways been fully cognizant of the deep ties that unite \r\nit with the African continent. \r\n A/61/PV.7\r\n \r\n17 06-52559 \r\n \r\n Today’s meeting, on the occasion of the midterm \r\ncomprehensive review of the Programme of Action for \r\nthe Least Developed Countries (LDCs) provides a good \r\nopportunity to highlight the progress achieved in \r\nimplementing the decisions included in the Programme \r\nand to consider the genuine issues and challenges \r\nfacing the implementation of those decisions. \r\nUndoubtedly, this review process should give new \r\nimpetus to the efficient and coherent international work \r\naimed at assisting that group of countries in achieving \r\nsustainable development and in the eradication of \r\npoverty for its peoples. Egypt believes that the \r\ninternational community should render all possible \r\nassistance to those countries in order to counter their \r\nincreased marginalization in the global economy and to \r\nhelp them benefit from contemporary scientific and \r\neconomic capabilities and to capitalize on the \r\ndevelopment opportunities of globalization, while \r\navoiding its negative repercussions on their economies. \r\n Eradicating poverty and achieving sustainable \r\ndevelopment for all is a joint responsibility of the \r\ncountries of the North and South alike on an equal \r\nbasis. That requires us all to strive during the \r\nremaining period to achieve the effective \r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action by 2010 \r\nthrough serious work and a genuine partnership to \r\nsupport LDCs. That partnership should be based on \r\ninternational solidarity and the principles enshrined in \r\nthe United Nations Charter, the Millennium \r\nDeclaration, and the goals and commitments agreed at \r\nthe 2005 World Summit. Prominent among those are \r\nnational ownership of development plans and \r\nstrategies, and the granting of assistance in support of \r\nthe development priorities determined by each country \r\nin its quest to achieve sustainable development. \r\n The reports and documents issued by the United \r\nNations and the Cotonou Strategy adopted in June \r\nconfirm the tremendous challenges that face least \r\ndeveloped countries. Those challenges lie in the lack of \r\nresources to finance infrastructure projects and the \r\nprimary service sectors of education and health, in \r\naddition to the need for environment-suitable \r\ntechnology transfers, while ensuring the sustainability \r\nof the development process in LDCs by swiftly \r\nintegrating them into the international economy and \r\nterminating all tariff and non-tariff barriers that prevent \r\nthe access of their exports to the markets of developed \r\ncountries, in addition to assisting LDCs that are not \r\nmembers of the World Trade Organization to join it as \r\nsoon as possible. \r\n Undoubtedly, the time will soon come when the \r\nongoing non-implementation of United Nations \r\nresolutions on the ground will be obsolete and \r\nunacceptable. Those resolutions must not become a \r\nmere moral obligation that may be either implemented \r\nor mostly ignored and bypassed.  \r\n Egypt today renews its commitment to supporting \r\nthe least developed countries in accomplishing their \r\ndevelopment goals. In recent years, Egypt has offered a \r\nwide variety of technical assistance to those countries \r\nin the form of programmes and training courses, \r\nbilaterally or through trilateral cooperation, with the \r\naim of supporting capacity-building in LDCs in various \r\nfields, including education, health, agriculture, \r\ninformation and communication technologies, and \r\nother fields, consistent with the outcome of the \r\nMillennium Summit. Egypt will remain committed to \r\nproviding all it can to our brothers in those countries \r\nout of our solid belief in the principle of solidarity \r\nbetween the countries of the South and in the \r\nimportance of international cooperation in achieving \r\ndevelopment and attaining security and stability at the \r\nnational, regional and international levels, and in \r\nparticular in our African continent, which is home to \r\nthe largest number of least developed countries. \r\n Egypt is very eager to use its membership of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission of the United Nations to \r\nensure that the Commission focuses special attention \r\non peace and security in the least developing countries \r\nand to assist those countries in creating an environment \r\nconducive to proceeding with the burdens of long-term \r\npeacebuilding in a manner that avoids the repeated \r\noutbreak of armed conflict, while propelling the wheels \r\nof development onward in all fields. \r\n Egypt has also used its membership in the \r\nsubregional arrangements in Africa, in particular the \r\nCommon Market for Eastern and Southern Africa \r\n(COMESA) — which comprises 13 of the least \r\ndeveloped countries — to enhance the volume of \r\ncommerce between COMESA members. The free-trade \r\nzone between COMESA members has provided an \r\nopportunity for the exports of the least developed \r\nmembers of COMESA to gain access to the markets of \r\ndeveloping countries in COMESA, including Egypt. It \r\nhas also provided job opportunities for young people \r\nand promoted the success of numerous small and \r\nA/61/PV.7  \r\n \r\n06-52559 18 \r\n \r\nmedium-sized enterprises, which has helped to improve \r\nthe economic and living conditions of the populations \r\nof the LDCs.  It is our hope and resolve to continue \r\nto work for further progress and the improvement of \r\nthose living conditions. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to Her \r\nExcellency Ms. Tarja Filatov, Minister of Labour of \r\nFinland, who will speak on behalf of the European \r\nUnion. \r\n Ms. Filatov (Finland): I am honoured to speak on \r\nbehalf of the European Union on this very important \r\nissue. The acceding countries Bulgaria and Romania; \r\nthe candidate countries Turkey, Croatia and the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia; the countries of the \r\nStabilisation and Association Process and potential \r\ncandidates Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, \r\nMontenegro and Serbia; and the European Free Trade \r\nAssociation country Iceland, member of the European \r\nEconomic Area, as well as the Republic of Moldova \r\nand Ukraine align themselves with this statement.  \r\n The European Union thanks the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report on the implementation of the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action up to 2006 and other \r\nmaterials produced for this midterm comprehensive \r\nglobal review. \r\n The European Union, as a major development \r\npartner of the least developed countries (LDCs), takes \r\nthis opportunity to reaffirm its full commitment to the \r\nimplementation of the Brussels Programme of Action \r\nas a part of its wider commitment to the global \r\ndevelopment agenda. The Brussels Programme of \r\nAction is a crucial element in the global strategy to \r\nimprove the situation of the LDCs, and the European \r\nUnion’s participation in this High-level Meeting is a \r\nreaffirmation of its strong partnership with the LDCs. \r\n Respect for human rights, including economic, \r\nsocial and cultural rights, the rule of law, solid \r\ndemocratic institutions responsive to the needs of the \r\npeople, good governance, sound economic policies and \r\nimproved infrastructure are the bases for sustainable \r\neconomic growth, poverty eradication and employment \r\ncreation. As recognized in the final Outcome of the \r\n2005 World Summit, development, peace and security \r\nand human rights are interlinked and mutually \r\nreinforcing. \r\n We welcome the fact that, beginning in 2001, \r\neconomic growth in the LDCs as a group has almost \r\nreached the 7 per cent target. That has been a result of \r\nLDC Governments’ courageous macroeconomic \r\nreforms and consequent reduced fiscal deficits, lower \r\ninflation and reduced external imbalances. \r\nMacroeconomic stabilization has been successfully \r\naccompanied by such structural reforms as \r\nprivatization, the easing of regulations on businesses, \r\nand trade liberalization. \r\n Trade can be a strong catalyst for economic \r\ngrowth and poverty reduction in developing countries. \r\nIt should be integrated into the national development \r\nplans, such as poverty reduction strategy papers, of all \r\nLDCs. Therefore, trade is one central element in the \r\ninternational agenda to support the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, the World Summit Outcome and \r\nthe Brussels Programme of Action. Market access \r\nalone is not enough to improve the poorest countries’ \r\nsuccessful integration into world trade. That will \r\nrequire increased development financing for trade and \r\nproductive capacities, combined with domestic reforms \r\nand improved international trade rules. \r\n The cost of a definitive breakdown of the Doha \r\nDevelopment Agenda negotiations would be extremely \r\nhigh, especially for the most vulnerable of the \r\ndeveloping countries. What we now risk losing is far \r\nmore significant than just the issues on which the \r\nnegotiations have foundered. Completing the Doha \r\nDevelopment Agenda would substantially help LDCs \r\nin their objective to integrate better into the world \r\neconomy. The European Union, for its part, will do its \r\nutmost to secure an early resumption of negotiations \r\nand calls on its trading partners, in particular the major \r\nplayers, to make the necessary moves to enable \r\nnegotiations to restart and reach a positive outcome.  \r\n It is important that improved market access for \r\nLDCs be supported by appropriate trade-related \r\ntechnical assistance. The European Union strongly \r\nsupports such initiatives as Aid for Trade. In that \r\ncontext, it underlines the importance of contributing to \r\nthe Enhanced Integrated Framework. Such initiatives \r\nshould not lose their impetus with the current situation \r\nof the negotiations on the Doha Development Agenda, \r\nand the international community should support their \r\nrapid execution.  \r\n In December 2005, the European Union member \r\nStates committed themselves, within the framework of \r\ntheir future development assistance commitments, to \r\nstrive to increase their spending on trade-related \r\n A/61/PV.7\r\n \r\n19 06-52559 \r\n \r\nassistance to €1 billion per year by 2010. That would \r\nbring the contribution of the European Union as a \r\nwhole, including the Community contribution, to €2 \r\nbillion per year by 2010. The economic partnership \r\nagreements under negotiation complement our trade-\r\nrelated technical assistance.  \r\n Strengthening and expanding the productive \r\ncapacities and infrastructure of the LDCs is necessary \r\nfor regional integration, increased internal and \r\ninternational trade, and economic growth and \r\ndevelopment. To meet those challenges, the European \r\nUnion has, for example, adopted the Strategy for \r\nAfrica, which includes an initiative on a European \r\nUnion-Africa partnership for infrastructure.  \r\n Despite good overall economic growth, poverty \r\nand deprivation remain high in most of the LDCs. That \r\nunderlines the need to support improved overall \r\ngovernance, the fight against corruption, the rule of \r\nlaw and more equal social development in the LDCs. \r\nEconomic wealth and development should also benefit \r\nthe most vulnerable parts of the population. To that \r\nend, education, health and gender-equality programmes \r\nare vital elements of our Programme of Action in order \r\nto achieve better functioning, more equal and \r\nenvironmentally more sustainable economies in the \r\nLDCs. That is especially important in those countries \r\nwhere all of society is jeopardized by such threats as \r\nHIV/AIDS.  \r\n In education, some figures are really \r\nencouraging, although improvements in the quality of \r\neducation have not kept pace with increased enrolment. \r\nIt is still alarming that, in 2004, almost 15 per cent of \r\ngirls living in LDCs were not even enrolled in primary \r\neducation. That is why the European Union remains \r\nvery concerned about the slow progress made in \r\npromoting gender equality. The LDCs should fully \r\nmainstream gender into all of their development plans.  \r\n Reducing vulnerabilities and managing the \r\nenvironment sustainably in the LDCs is at the heart of \r\nthe Brussels Programme of Action, as well as of the \r\nbroader development agenda, particularly in our \r\nendeavour to fully implement the commitments of the \r\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development.  \r\n We note with satisfaction the increase in official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) from donor countries to \r\nthe LDCs. In 2001, the year when the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action was adopted, the yearly ODA to \r\nLDCs was approximately €10 billion. By 2004, that \r\namount had almost doubled to €19 billion, and if the \r\ntrend continues, ODA to LDCs will double again to \r\nover €40 billion by the year 2010. The European Union \r\nhas put itself in the forefront of that evolution through \r\nthe decisions of the European Councils of Barcelona \r\nand Brussels to considerably increase its ODA by 2010 \r\nand beyond.  \r\n The European Union is a supporter and financier \r\nof the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) \r\nInitiative and welcomes and supports the Multilateral \r\nDebt Relief Initiative to cancel 100 per cent of the \r\noutstanding debt of eligible HIPC countries. The \r\nEuropean Union also underlines the importance of \r\nsmooth transition from the list of LDCs and is ready to \r\nhelp the countries which have graduated from the list.  \r\n The European Union is very attentive to the \r\nquality of aid. Major commitments to a more \r\ncoordinated and complementary development policy \r\nwere made by the larger development community in \r\nthe Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, which was \r\nadopted in March 2005 and to which we are fully \r\ncommitted. The European Consensus for Development \r\nsets the principles for increased aid effectiveness and \r\ncoherence.  \r\n As expressed in the European Consensus, it is \r\nnecessary to support and strengthen credible \r\ninstitutions not only at the central and regional levels, \r\nbut also at the local level. In that context, the principle \r\nof subsidiarity has to be mentioned, together with the \r\nneed for effective policies on decentralization and \r\naccountability, capacity development and \r\nempowerment of civil society, especially at the grass-\r\nroots level. Progress in all those aspects will result in \r\nbringing about more equity and equality of opportunity.  \r\n To conclude, we can clearly state that poverty is \r\nnot invincible. Relatively new positive trends, such as \r\nthe improvement of the situation in many LDCs and \r\nthe graduation of Cape Verde and the Maldives from \r\nthe list of LDCs, must keep us from the temptation of \r\nresignation. Those trends reflect the first results of the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action. We should continue its \r\nfirm implementation until 2010. The goals are \r\ndemanding, but with growing resources and even more \r\nattention from every partner, we should be able to \r\nrealize challenges during the remaining five years of \r\nthe Programme of Action. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Jean Asselborn, Deputy Prime Minister \r\nA/61/PV.7  \r\n \r\n06-52559 20 \r\n \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs and Immigration of \r\nLuxembourg. \r\n Mr. Asselborn (Luxembourg) (spoke in French): \r\nAllow me at the outset to congratulate you, Madam, on \r\nyour election and to wish you much luck and courage \r\nin the very important and interesting task before you. \r\n The commitment of the European Union and its \r\nmember States to help the least developed countries \r\n(LDCs) has already been demonstrated. Indeed, it was \r\nunder European Union auspices that the Third United \r\nNations Conference on the Least Developed Countries \r\nwas held in Brussels from 14 to 20 May 2001. The \r\neradication of poverty and sustainable development \r\nwere identified at the time as the priorities of the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action, the implementation of \r\nwhich we are reviewing today, halfway through its \r\nperiod of implementation from 2001 to 2010. \r\n It is within the spirit of resolute and long-\r\nstanding European commitment that I should also like \r\nto endorse the statement made by the Finnish \r\nrepresentative on behalf of the European Union. \r\n Mr. Butagira (Uganda), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n It is even more pleasant for me to participate in \r\nthis most useful and necessary midterm review given \r\nthat the Government of Luxembourg has pursued a \r\nproactive and consistent development cooperation \r\npolicy. That policy, a cornerstone of our foreign policy, \r\nhas two particular features — one qualitative, the other \r\nquantitative. Since 2000, Luxembourg has been among \r\nthe far too few industrialized to abide by their \r\ninternational commitment to devoting at least 0.7 per \r\ncent of their gross national income to official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA). \r\n In fact, Luxembourg has done better. In terms of \r\npercentage of gross national income, its assistance to \r\ndeveloping countries stood at 0.82 per cent in 2005 and \r\nwill continue to rise to 1 per cent in the years to come. \r\nIn 2004, 49 per cent of Luxembourg’s assistance to \r\ndeveloping countries was earmarked for LDCs, and \r\nthat, too, will continue to increase as we pursue our \r\npolicy of focusing on that category.  \r\n In addition to the purely quantitative aspect, \r\nLuxembourg has held an ongoing dialogue with all its \r\ndeveloping partners, the LDCs in particular. \r\nLuxembourg’s cooperation identifies its interventions \r\non the basis of that dialogue and in accordance with the \r\npriorities identified by the partner Governments in \r\ntheir national development strategies.  \r\n Partnership is not an empty word to us. We are \r\nconvinced that only relations on an equal footing \r\nbetween development partners can possibly create the \r\ntype of understanding and respect that is critical if we \r\nare effectively to address the problems of the poorest \r\npopulations together. We must identify projects and \r\nprogrammes with a strong sense of ownership by the \r\ntarget communities. That is what guarantees truly \r\nsustainable development. \r\n Allow me also to thank the Secretary-General for \r\nthe report he has prepared on the implementation of the \r\nMay 2001 Brussels Programme of Action. While, on \r\nthe one hand, it should come as no surprise that, \r\nhalfway down the road, we have not yet attained all the \r\nobjectives, we are, on the other, sobered by the \r\nwarning that a number of LDCs are not on target for \r\nsuccess by 2010. Additional efforts by the LDCs and \r\nthe international community alike are indispensable if \r\nwe truly wish to rise to the commitments that we \r\nundertook in 2001. \r\n In Brussels, we were wise enough to look at the \r\nissue from the long-term perspective as we sought \r\nambitious progress for the LDCs. That long-term \r\nperspective should not penalize the poorest \r\npopulations, given that lofty ambitions tend to fade \r\nwith time. This midterm review is therefore a timely \r\nopportunity to restore momentum. The progress made \r\nover the past five years should encourage us. \r\n The total amounts earmarked for ODA reached \r\nunprecedented levels in 2005. While part of the \r\nincrease was attributable to contributions to the victims \r\nof the Indian Ocean tsunami and the alleviation of \r\nIraq’s debt, we must not forget that in May 2005, under \r\nthe Luxembourg presidency and at the initiative of my \r\ncolleague the Minister for Cooperation — acting \r\nconsistently with his predecessors in charge of \r\nLuxembourg’s cooperation policy — the States \r\nmembers of the European Union decided to raise \r\nassistance to developing countries to 0.56 per cent of \r\ngross national income in 2010 and to 0.7 per cent in \r\n2015. That new quantitative political commitment was \r\nbuilt on the foundation of an initiative adopted in \r\nMarch 2005, when the industrialized and developing \r\ncountries, including many LDCs, adopted the Paris \r\nDeclaration on Aid Effectiveness. \r\n A/61/PV.7\r\n \r\n21 06-52559 \r\n \r\n Respect for international commitments underpins \r\nrelations of trust within a well-defined and effective \r\npartnership between donor and developing countries. \r\nIn that respect, I have the pleasure of confirming that \r\nLuxembourg earmarked more than 0.3 per cent of its \r\ngross national income to LDCs in 2004. The Brussels \r\npromise to reserve between 0.15 per cent and 0.2 per \r\ncent has been more than met. We have implemented it \r\nin the context of indicative cooperation programmes \r\nwith 10 privileged partner countries. Those \r\nprogrammes guarantee, in the medium term and in \r\nconformity with the national development programmes \r\nof our partners, predictable assistance on the part of \r\nLuxembourg. \r\n Such social sectors as education, health, access to \r\nwater and local development are priorities of our \r\ncooperation. In view of the Secretary-General’s \r\nrecommendations, we are confident that this sectoral \r\ntargeting will contribute concretely to achieving \r\nprogress in the areas of governance, capacity-building \r\nand institution-building in LDCs, and above all gender \r\nparity and the fight against HIV/AIDS. \r\n In conclusion, I reaffirm the continuing support \r\nof the Government of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg \r\nfor the implementation of the Programme of Action for \r\nthe LDCs. They will find us to be reliable and \r\ntrustworthy partners. \r\n The Acting President: I give the floor to Her \r\nExcellency Ms. Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of South Africa, who will speak on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China. \r\n Ms. Zuma (South Africa): Allow me to \r\ncongratulate the President on her election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \r\nsession. We are delighted to see her presiding over this \r\nMeeting. \r\n The Group of 77 and China welcomes the High-\r\nlevel Meeting to assess the progress made in the first \r\nfive years of implementation of the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action for the Least Developed \r\nCountries for the Decade 2001-2010.  \r\n The Group of 77 and China further welcomes the \r\nCotonou Strategy, a comprehensive analytical midterm \r\nreview of the status of the implementation of the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action for the first five years \r\nwhich clearly and succinctly outlines the achievements \r\nmade thus far, the challenges ahead and the actions to \r\nbe taken together by the least developed countries and \r\ndevelopment partners. \r\n As a result of this midterm review, the Group of \r\n77 and China notes with concern that insufficient \r\nprogress has been achieved in the implementation of \r\nthe Brussels Programme of Action and that, as \r\nindicated, very few least developed countries are \r\nexpected to be able to meet the Brussels Programme of \r\nAction’s objectives, goals and targets if current trends \r\ncontinue. The full implementation of the seven \r\ncommitments must be adhered to if the least developed \r\ncountries are to achieve the internationally agreed \r\ngoals, including the Millennium Development Goals. \r\n In spite of the appropriate measures taken and \r\ntremendous efforts made by the least developed \r\ncountries themselves to build enabling national \r\nenvironments for the implementation of the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action in their efforts to pursue much-\r\nneeded development, the support received from \r\ndevelopment partners is still insufficient or sometimes \r\neven completely lacking. The Group of 77 and China \r\ntherefore calls on the development partners of the least \r\ndeveloped countries to expeditiously fulfil their \r\ncommitments. \r\n The 2005 World Summit Outcome reaffirmed the \r\ncommitments made to address the special needs of the \r\nleast developed countries and urged all countries, all \r\nrelevant organizations of the United Nations system \r\nand other relevant international organizations, \r\nincluding the Bretton Woods institutions, to make \r\nconcerted efforts and adopt speedy measures for \r\nmeeting in a timely manner the goals and targets of the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action. \r\n We do not, however, think that sufficient work \r\nhas been done to meet those commitments that were \r\nmade as late as 2005. Achieving the goals and targets \r\ncontained in the Programme of Action calls for \r\ncontinued and renewed commitment from the least \r\ndeveloped countries and the development partners \r\nalike. It is vital that this partnership be reinvigorated \r\nand enhanced by promoting mutual and shared \r\nresponsibilities between the least developed countries \r\nand their development partners in the interests of \r\npromoting economic growth and sustainable \r\ndevelopment in the least developed countries, thereby \r\nfurther promoting their integration into the world \r\neconomy. \r\nA/61/PV.7  \r\n \r\n06-52559 22 \r\n \r\n I would also like to reaffirm and agree with the \r\nmidterm review that special attention should be given \r\nto gender equality. Gender equality is important not \r\nonly in itself, but also in the achievement of the other \r\nMillennium Development Goals, such as reducing \r\ninfant and maternal mortality, because without gender \r\nequality it will be very to attain those two goals. It is \r\nalso important that agriculture, infrastructure, \r\nHIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and the obstacles to \r\nthe exports of the least developed countries be attended \r\nto. \r\n In conclusion, I should also like to say that \r\ncoordinated action on the part of the United Nations \r\nand its agencies, funds and programmes should be \r\nenhanced to support least developed countries. More \r\nimportantly, the development partners must fulfil the \r\ncommitments they made at all the major United \r\nNations summits over the past 10 years, especially the \r\nMonterey International Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment and the Johannesburg World Summit on \r\nSustainable Development. We all have a collective \r\nresponsibility to assist and to show our solidarity with \r\nthe least developed countries. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Rudolph Insanally, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Guyana, who will speak on behalf of \r\nthe Rio Group. \r\n Mr. Insanally (Guyana): On this important \r\nagenda item, I have the honour to speak on behalf of \r\nthe countries of the Rio Group. \r\n At this review of the Brussels Programme of \r\nAction, we must assess frankly the gains that have \r\nbeen made and seek to redeem the commitments of the \r\nProgramme, as the thematic focus for this High-level \r\nMeeting enjoins us to do. \r\n Important developments, including the doubling \r\nof official development assistance to least developed \r\ncountries (LDCs) since 1999, the substantial reduction \r\nof the debt of the poorest countries, increased duty-free \r\nand quota-free market access for most LDC products, \r\nmore systematized flows of untied aid, and increases in \r\nprivate capital flows provide encouraging signs that \r\naffirm the Brussels Programme as an invaluable \r\ncatalyst for the sustainable growth and development of \r\nthe LDCs.  \r\n At the recent High-level Dialogue on migration, \r\nmuch was made of the fact that LDCs now enjoy high \r\nvolumes of remittances. Indeed, that is the case, but as \r\na recent study by the International Monetary Fund has \r\nshown, those gains do not adequately compensate for \r\nthe losses of skills and other resources on the part of \r\nthe LDCs. All that glitters is not gold. \r\n In the interests of time, I shall restrict my \r\nstatement and make a longer version available to the \r\nGeneral Assembly, but I wish simply to make the point \r\nthat the situation of the LDCs remains very precarious. \r\nA comparison of available selected data for the LDCs \r\nreveals the arduous effort required to honour the \r\ncommitments articulated in the Brussels Programme. \r\n More worryingly, at present rates, even the \r\nminimal threshold of expected achievement cannot be \r\nguaranteed. In light of other considerations, such as the \r\nnegative impact of the high incidence of HIV/AIDS \r\nand other infectious diseases and the need for quality \r\neconomic growth, the reduction of inequalities and the \r\npreservation of the natural environment, a more sombre \r\noutlook for the LDCs is inevitable. \r\n At this midpoint of the third Programme of \r\nAction, it is imperative that we make the changes \r\nnecessary to ensure that our course is firmly charted \r\ntowards achievement beyond the disappointing level of \r\nresults of previous Programmes. \r\n The first five years have underscored the efficacy \r\nof partnerships in achieving the objectives of the \r\nProgramme. More intensive cooperation can thus \r\naccelerate progress and development to counter the \r\ncrippling effects of the unequal global trade rules that \r\nnow prevail. LDCs have themselves provided the \r\nleadership in articulating the focus and commitment \r\nnow necessary to guarantee the full implementation of \r\nthe Programme of Action. The Rio Group would call \r\nattention in that regard to the approach outlined in the \r\nCotonou Strategy for the Further Implementation of the \r\nProgramme of Action. \r\n Countries of our Group have advanced proposals \r\nat the global level that take account of the kind of \r\nthinking, action and collaboration necessary if further \r\nprogress is to be achieved. We believe that, in \r\nadvancing the agenda of the LDCs, as well as other \r\ncountries and regions that face special challenges, we \r\nmust give greater consideration to ensuring that those \r\nproposals go beyond these limited objectives, including \r\nthe call by my own country for the establishment of a \r\nnew global human economic and social system, the \r\nAction Against Hunger and Poverty initiative of Brazil, \r\n A/61/PV.7\r\n \r\n23 06-52559 \r\n \r\nChile and others, and the international humanitarian \r\nfund proposed by Venezuela. \r\n The standard for the judgement of success \r\nstipulated by the Programme of Action itself is its \r\ncontribution to the progress of LDCs towards \r\nachieving international development targets, as well as, \r\nif necessary, their graduation from the ranks of the \r\nLDCs. The report card at this stage shows that much \r\nbetter can and should be done.  \r\n The Rio Group therefore supports the strong \r\nrenewal of the political commitment to LDCs by this \r\nHigh-level Meeting. We express our continued interest \r\nin the development of the LDCs and encourage all \r\nactors — the LDCs themselves, the partner countries, \r\nthe international community and the Secretariat which \r\nhelps them — to redouble their efforts to assure greater \r\nsuccess and the full achievement of the objectives of \r\nthe Programme of Action. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Moctar Ouane, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Mali. \r\n Mr. Ouane (Mali) (spoke in French): Allow me \r\nfirst to convey to the President of the General \r\nAssembly the warm congratulations of the delegation \r\nof Mali on her outstanding election to the presidency of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-first session. \r\n I should like next to congratulate and thank \r\nMr. Chowdhury, High Representative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the Least Developed Countries, \r\nLandlocked Developing Countries and Small Island \r\nDeveloping States, as well as all those who contributed \r\nto the excellent organization of this High-level Meeting \r\non the Midterm Comprehensive Review of the \r\nImplementation of the Programme of Action for the \r\nLeast Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010. \r\nBy virtue of Mr. Chowdhury’s dynamic and effective \r\nleadership, this Meeting is most timely, and the \r\ncommitment shown by all has convinced us that it will \r\nproduce important results that will allow us to pursue \r\nthe implementation of the seven commitments \r\ncontained in the Brussels Programme of Action. \r\n Where do we find ourselves five years after the \r\nadoption of the Programme of Action? Let us be \r\nfrank — the results do not live up to expectations. As a \r\nresult, the least developed countries (LDCs) and their \r\ndevelopment partners need to devote additional efforts \r\nat the national, bilateral, subregional, regional and \r\nglobal levels to meeting the goals of the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action. It is from that standpoint that I \r\nwish very briefly to share the experience of Mali in this \r\narea. \r\n Mali took active part in the Third United Nations \r\nConference on the Least Developed Countries, which \r\nadopted the Brussels Declaration and Programme of \r\nAction. As a result, in 2002 the Government of Mali \r\nadopted a single reference framework for its \r\ndevelopment strategies and policies, which we call our \r\nStrategic Framework to Combat Poverty 2002-2006. \r\nThe Framework identified three pillars covering the \r\nseven Brussels Programme of Action commitments: \r\ninstitutional development and improving governance \r\nand participation; developing human resources and \r\naccess to basic social services; and developing basic \r\ninfrastructure and productive sectors. In that regard, \r\nMali’s national report on its implementation of the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action allows us to come to the \r\nfollowing conclusions.  \r\n With regard to access to basic social services, the \r\noverall education rate rose by 9.6 per cent, from 64.4 \r\nper cent in 2002 to 74 per cent in 2005. The proportion \r\nof people living within 5 kilometres of a health-care \r\ncentre rose from 44 per cent in 2002 to 50 per cent in \r\n2005. Vaccination coverage for diphtheria, tetanus, \r\nwhooping cough and poliomyelitis 3 rose from 75 per \r\ncent in 2002 to 90 per cent in 2005. Access to drinking \r\nwater rose from 57 per cent in 2002 to 66.1 per cent in \r\n2005. Although they fell, maternal and infant mortality \r\nrates continue to be of concern at 500 per 100,000 live \r\nbirths and 113 per 1,000 live births, respectively.  \r\n As to basic infrastructure, telephone coverage \r\nrose from one line per 100 inhabitants in 2002 to seven \r\nlines per 100 in 2005. The overall rate for access to \r\nelectricity rose from 12 per cent in 2002 to 15.03 per \r\ncent in 2005.  \r\n With respect to good governance, major progress \r\nwas made with the adoption of a plan to modernize \r\nadministration and to institutionalize the office of the \r\ngeneral auditor.  \r\n However, the overall poverty rate did not fall \r\nduring this period, despite the fact that the Malian \r\neconomy enjoyed a real growth rate of approximately \r\n5.1 per cent of gross domestic product, which falls \r\nshort of the goal of 6.7 per cent identified by the \r\nStrategic Framework. \r\nA/61/PV.7  \r\n \r\n06-52559 24 \r\n \r\n Very clearly, such conclusions can be applied to \r\nalmost every least developed country. What is to be \r\ndone? Let us first recall the truism that there can be no \r\nreduction of poverty without sustainable economic \r\ngrowth and a fair redistribution of the fruits of that \r\ngrowth. That is why Mali, drawing the lessons of the \r\nimplementation of its first Strategic Framework, \r\ndrafted a second for the period 2007-2011 that focuses \r\non economic growth, in particular the development of \r\nproductive sectors, the pursuit and consolidation of \r\nstructural reform, and enhanced access to basic social \r\nservices. \r\n It is also clear that our objective to cut poverty in \r\nhalf by 2010 will require the international community’s \r\nresolute commitment to increasing official \r\ndevelopment assistance, enhancing its effectiveness, \r\nand promoting the establishment of an international \r\nenvironment to facilitate the mainstreaming of the \r\nLDCs into the global economy. It will also require \r\ndirect foreign investment and technology transfers. \r\n There is also a need for the increased \r\ninvolvement of the Office of the High Representative \r\nof the Secretary-General for the Least Developed \r\nCountries, Landlocked Developing Countries and \r\nSmall Island Developing States in making the case to \r\ndonors and cooperation agencies and in capacity-\r\nbuilding for the LDCs, particularly in the area of trade.  \r\n Let me end as I started by stressing that Mali \r\nexpects the declaration that will be adopted as the \r\noutcome of this High-level Meeting to be \r\ncommensurate with the commitments that we all made \r\nin 2001, for how can we reasonably accept that, at a \r\ntime when the world is richer than ever, the number of \r\ninhabitants of LDCs living in poverty will increase \r\nfrom 334 million in 2000 to 471 million in 2015? \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. M. Morshed Khan, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Bangladesh. \r\n Mr. Khan (Bangladesh): I will try to make my \r\nstatement brief. \r\n This midterm review of the Programme of Action \r\nis extremely important for all of us, especially as we \r\ntake stock of why the least developed countries (LDCs) \r\nare yet to achieve the target growth rate of 7 per cent \r\nper year and increase the gross domestic product \r\n(GDP) investment ratio of 25 per cent. As the \r\nProgramme of Action correctly identified, the \r\nachievement of high growth rates will remain elusive \r\nfor the LDCs unless there are substantial increases in \r\ninvestments. The average GDP growth rate has been \r\nless than 3 per cent since we adopted the Programme of \r\nAction in 2001, and investments have also remained \r\nvery low. \r\n For the LDCs, therefore, the primary constraint is \r\nthe lack of capital. There was an expectation that there \r\nwould be increased capital flow, development \r\nassistance and foreign direct investment into the LDCs \r\nto make up for the investment-savings gap, but the \r\nreality has been otherwise. Some relevant figures will \r\nprove the point. Official development assistance to \r\nLDCs in 2004, according to the most recent data \r\navailable, amounted to $23.8 billion or $35.7 per \r\nperson living in the LDCs. That is less than 10 cents a \r\nday, which certainly is not sufficient to complement \r\nincome or boost the savings rate. \r\n During the same year, the LDCs returned almost \r\n$6 billion in servicing their debts. Another $8 billion \r\nleft the LDCs in terms of the net factor income of \r\nforeign companies and individuals operating in LDCs. \r\nThe last source of outflow is perhaps the trickiest \r\none — the LDC holdings of foreign exchange reserves. \r\nThe LDCs collectively held over $28 billion in foreign \r\nreserves, in dollars and euros, which is essentially a \r\nvery low-interest loan from the poorest countries to \r\ntheir rich benefactors. Between 2003 and 2004, LDC \r\nforeign exchange reserves increased nearly $5.5 \r\nbillion: a net outflow. If we deduct these outflows from \r\nthe official development aid (ODA) and foreign direct \r\ninvestment, net capital injection into LDCs is less than \r\n$5 billion a year, or only two cents per day for every \r\nLDC citizen. This is certainly not enough to make a \r\ndent in the perpetual savings-investment gap in the \r\npoorest countries of the world. \r\n Lack of capital is one side of the coin; the other is \r\nthe lack of market access. Following the adoption of \r\nthe Programme of Action, the Doha development round \r\nof trade negotiations began with a big bang but soon \r\nhit gridlock without any consensus on special and \r\ndifferential market access for the LDCs. Even when \r\ntariff barriers are low, LDC exports face substantial \r\nnon-tariff and para-tariff barriers, which essentially \r\nprevent any substantive growth in exports. In the WTO \r\nnegotiations, there have also been attempts to pit LDCs \r\nagainst each other, giving selective preferences to \r\nselected LDCs. This must stop, and all LDC exports \r\n A/61/PV.7\r\n \r\n25 06-52559 \r\n \r\nmust receive the same treatment: duty-free and quota-\r\nfree market access. \r\n The third problem is volatility in income. In a \r\nglobalized world, an economic downturn in one \r\ncountry can have significant adverse effects on its \r\ntrading partners. The LDCs unfortunately have no \r\neffective insulation against these so-called contagion \r\neffects. More important, the magnitude of shocks can \r\nbe very different for rich and poor countries, as it can \r\nbe for rich and poor households. There are also other \r\nexternal shocks, like the oil price hike, which \r\ndisproportionately affect the LDCs. Then there are \r\nweather-related income shocks, produced by floods, \r\ndrought and tsunamis, which erode domestic savings \r\nand impede investment. We need to take into account \r\nthe asymmetric effects of various economic shocks on \r\nLDCs, especially against the backdrop of procyclical \r\ncapital flows into the LDCs. \r\n How do we tackle these challenges and put the \r\nProgramme of Action on track to increase investment \r\nand growth? Please allow me to share some of my \r\nthoughts on these issues.  \r\n First, we need an innovative solution to deal with \r\nthe burden of foreign exchange reserves on LDCs. The \r\n$28 billion reserve that the LDCs are currently holding \r\nis, in fact, an unfair tax on the LDCs, given that they \r\ncannot use it to finance their development efforts. One \r\nsolution could be to allow LDCs to borrow against \r\ntheir own reserves at zero interest rate differentials. \r\nCurrently, the LDCs are charged a substantial markup \r\nto borrow against their own foreign exchange reserves. \r\nThe reserve-currency countries must commit \r\nthemselves to this arrangement. Otherwise, it remains a \r\none-way benefit for the developed countries, rather \r\nthan for the LDCs.  \r\n Secondly, we need to ensure that capital flow to \r\nthe LDCs is countercyclical. Lending and assistance to \r\nthe LDCs must increase when there is an economic \r\ndownturn. Countercyclical capital flows would smooth \r\ninvestment growth and make income less volatile in the \r\nLDC world.  \r\n Thirdly, we must devise new strategies and \r\nmechanisms to strengthen the LDCs’ capacities to \r\nmanage weather-related risks. The international \r\ncommunity needs to address this in all earnestness and \r\nlook into the possibility of introducing weather \r\ninsurance and weather derivatives in the LDCs.  \r\n Fourthly, we need to revisit the rules of the World \r\nTrade Organization (WTO), especially the principle of \r\nsingle undertaking, to grant expeditiously exports from \r\nthe LDCs duty-free and quota free access to developed \r\nmarkets, pending agreements on agricultural subsidies \r\nor on market access for non-agricultural goods. This is \r\nan imperative to resuscitate the Doha development \r\nround.  \r\n Fifthly, we need to step up our efforts to identify \r\nand eliminate the key supply side constraints that \r\nprevent LDC private sectors from becoming \r\ncompetitive globally. It is time that the international \r\ncommunity take concrete measures to activate fully the \r\nAid for Trade Initiative and an enhanced Integrated \r\nFramework, not only to remove capacity constraints \r\nbut also to identify and address the problems of non-\r\ntariff and para-tariff barriers in the developed countries \r\nthat impede LDC exports. Aid for Trade and an \r\nenhanced Integrated Framework should focus on the \r\nproblems in both the developed economies and the \r\nLDCs. \r\n Finally, there needs to be some monitoring and \r\nevaluation mechanism under the auspices of the United \r\nNations to ensure implementation of the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action and the commitments made by \r\nthe developed countries. We hope to see a better world \r\ntomorrow in line with this position. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon, Minister for Foreign Affairs and \r\nTrade of the Republic of Korea. \r\n Mr. Ban Ki-moon (Republic of Korea): Let me \r\nbegin by extending my heartfelt congratulations to \r\nMs. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa as she assumes her \r\nresponsibilities as President of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-first session. I wish her every success in this \r\nHigh-level Meeting on the least developed countries, \r\nand in all her noble work. \r\n This midterm review is a valuable opportunity to \r\nassess our achievements in implementing the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action, to recommit ourselves to its \r\ngoals, to exchange best practices and to seek effective \r\nways to accomplish the work that lies ahead. \r\n In my view, the priorities for the efforts of the \r\nLDCs and their development partners should converge \r\nalong the following priorities. First, greater efforts \r\nneed to be made to adopt and implement national \r\ndevelopment strategies. Many international agreements \r\nA/61/PV.7  \r\n \r\n06-52559 26 \r\n \r\nand programmes related to the least developed \r\ncountries, including strategies to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, are already in place, \r\nbut the recommendations have yet to be fully \r\nincorporated into national plans and policies. The \r\nefforts of LDCs to adopt and implement development \r\nstrategies should be reinforced with strong \r\ninternational support.  \r\n Secondly, capacity-building should be the central \r\nfocus of the development efforts of LDCs and their \r\npartners. The improvements made in the field of \r\neducation and health, as noted in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report (A/61/173), must lead to greater \r\ninvestment in this area. The nurturing of human \r\nresources is vital for sustained development. \r\nFurthermore, the economic foundations of the LDCs \r\nshould be strengthened through increased investment in \r\ninfrastructure, energy, agriculture and rural \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Thirdly, the role of women in development in the \r\nLDCs should be fully recognized. The empowerment \r\nof women and mainstreaming of gender perspectives \r\ninto policymaking and policy implementation is central \r\nto social progress. Women’s equal participation and \r\ninput promote development. The proof from the ground \r\nin development projects, large and small, is clear: \r\nwomen and girls can be the most effective agents for \r\nchange and social progress. Specifically, in the urgent \r\ntasks facing the LDCs, such as eliminating poverty and \r\nfighting HIV/AIDS, gender mainstreaming must be \r\nmade a central pillar of policy strategy. Korea’s \r\nexperience also shows that lasting social change cannot \r\nbe realized until women are fully incorporated into the \r\nprocess. \r\n Fourthly, the least developed countries should \r\nstrive continuously to strengthen good governance. It is \r\ndisheartening to see many least developed countries \r\ncontinue to struggle in the face of conflict and civil \r\nunrest. It is nonetheless encouraging to see the strides \r\nbeing made in many others towards political stability \r\nand democratic reform. While it is true that no single \r\nmodel of democratic governance exists, governance \r\ncan be improved by sharing best practices. In this \r\nregard, South-South cooperation can have its own \r\nbenefits and advantages. \r\n Finally, development partners must deliver on \r\ntheir commitments, especially in the areas of official \r\ndevelopment assistance, debt relief, market access and \r\ntechnical assistance. Even though positive progress has \r\nbeen made in these areas, more support is called for. \r\nMy Government recognizes its responsibilities in this \r\nregard, and has been faithfully honouring its pledges. \r\nAs announced at the World Summit last year, we will \r\ndouble our official development assistance (ODA) by \r\n2009 and triple it, to about $3 billion, by 2015. We are \r\nnow taking the necessary steps to introduce an air-\r\nticket solidarity levy, which should strengthen our \r\nODA. In particular, through our Initiative for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment, by 2008 we will triple our assistance to \r\nAfrica, which is home to almost two thirds of the least \r\ndeveloped countries. \r\n But aid alone is not enough. The history of \r\ndevelopment in many countries, including my own, has \r\nshown that promoting trade is the most effective means \r\nof achieving sustained growth. That is why my \r\nGovernment supports the Aid for Trade Initiative, \r\nparticularly for the least developed countries, and why \r\nwe will also expand duty-free and quota-free access for \r\ngoods from the least developed countries. \r\n This midterm review is an opportunity for us to \r\nstrengthen global partnerships for the development of \r\nthe least developed countries. Let us rededicate \r\nourselves to a world that nurtures today’s least \r\ndeveloped countries so that they can become \r\ntomorrow’s engines for freedom and prosperity. The \r\nfirst step, of course, is to make sure that we use the \r\nnext five years to keep the promises we made in \r\nBrussels. \r\n The meeting rose at 1.15 p.m. \r\n"
