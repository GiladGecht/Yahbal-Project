I also commend the Secretary-General for his \r\nreport contained in document A/61/173. I would like to \r\nassociate this statement with the statements made by \r\nthe President of the Republic of Benin, Mr. Thomas \r\nYayi Boni, and the Minister of the Republic of South \r\nAfrica, speaking on behalf of the least developed \r\ncountries and the Group of 77 and China, respectively. \r\n At the end of our meeting, we will adopt a \r\nministerial declaration in which, among other things, \r\nwe recommit to and reaffirm our shared responsibility \r\nin lifting millions of anguished people out of poverty \r\nin the least developed countries through the full \r\nimplementation of the Brussels Programme of Action. \r\nSome progress has been made, but we still have a long \r\nway to go if we are fully to realize the objectives \r\ncontained in the Programme of Action. \r\n We have now reached the halfway point in the \r\nimplementation of the Programme, but in reality we are \r\nvery far behind in achieving half of the commitments \r\nand targets set out in the Programme. That is in itself \r\nan urgent challenge to all of us who signed the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action in 2001 to reassess our \r\nindividual and collective shortfalls and to intensify our \r\nefforts to meet the targets within the remaining period. \r\n Today’s meeting is the culmination of an \r\nintensive preparatory process at the national, regional \r\nand global levels. The outcomes of those preparatory \r\nmeetings revealed that some least developed countries \r\nare making headway but that the majority are still \r\nlagging behind. One of the outcomes of the preparatory \r\nA/61/PV.8  \r\n \r\n06-52565 2 \r\n \r\nmeetings is the Cotonou Strategy for the Further \r\nImplementation of the Brussels Programme, adopted at \r\nBenin by the ministers of the least developed countries. \r\nThe Cotonou Strategy outlined the progress made, but, \r\nmost importantly, it identified gaps and made \r\nrecommendations for the way forward. My delegation \r\ntrusts that those recommendations will be taken \r\nseriously by the development partners of the least \r\ndeveloped countries in the five years that remain to \r\nmeet the targets of the Programme by 2010. \r\n The preparatory meetings reaffirmed that the \r\nprimary responsibility for the development of the least \r\ndeveloped countries lies with their peoples and \r\nGovernments. The commitments of the peoples and \r\nGovernments of the least developed countries to the \r\nprinciple of primary responsibility and ownership are \r\nreflected in their efforts to undertake economic, social, \r\npolitical and institutional reforms. There has never \r\nbefore been a period when the least developed \r\ncountries have introduced and implemented so many \r\nsuccessful reforms as in the last five years. \r\n During that period, there has been substantial \r\nimprovement in the gross domestic product (GDP) \r\ngrowth rate. Six least developed countries achieved \r\nand even surpassed the target of a 7 per cent GDP \r\ngrowth rate, whereas 11 were on track. Most of the \r\nleast developed countries had an average GDP growth \r\nrate of between 3 and 5 per cent. Other achievements \r\nrecorded during the same period include increased \r\nparticipation in global trade, an increase in domestic \r\nresource mobilization, and the implementation of good \r\ngovernance practices and human rights principles. \r\n The intensification of the combat against \r\ncorruption, the holding of transparent and democratic \r\nelections, the increase in the participation of women in \r\ndecision- and policymaking institutions, and the \r\nresolution and decrease in the number of internal \r\nconflicts are among such far-reaching reforms. \r\n In order for the least developed countries to \r\nsustain their momentum, their efforts should be \r\nsupported, in a timely and genuine manner, by a \r\nconducive international development environment. \r\n In its fourth phase of action, the Government of \r\nthe United Republic of Tanzania, under President \r\nJakaya Kikwete, is committed to maintaining and \r\naccelerating the momentum generated by his \r\npredecessor, Benjamin Mkapa, so as to achieve the full \r\nrealization of the goals and targets of the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action. Far-reaching reforms have been \r\nintroduced, including in the areas of governance, \r\neducation, human rights, democracy, the rule of law \r\nand fiscal reforms. The privatization of trade and \r\ncommerce, agriculture, mining and the tourism and \r\nindustrial sectors is yielding positive results in terms of \r\nthe country’s gross national product. The joint \r\npublication of the World Bank and the International \r\nFinance Corporation entitled “Doing Business 2007: \r\nHow to Reform” named Tanzania as among the top 10 \r\nreformers in the world in 2005-2006 and as the second-\r\nranked reformer in Africa, after Ghana. \r\n In the period under review, 2001-2006, the GDP \r\ngrowth rate registered an increase of between 5 and \r\n7 per cent, the inflation rate decreased from 5.1 to \r\n4.2 per cent, and foreign direct investment increased, \r\nfinancing approximately 20 per cent of Tanzania’s \r\ninvestments. Between 2004 and 2005, per capita \r\nincome increased by 12.9 per cent. \r\n The outcome of the elections clearly indicated the \r\nGovernment’s will and determination to increase the \r\nparticipation of women in decision- and policymaking. \r\nIt was in these elections that the country managed to \r\nachieve the goal of 30 per cent women \r\nparliamentarians, as required by the Southern African \r\nDevelopment Community. The current Cabinet \r\nincludes 16 women, of whom 6 are full ministers and \r\n10 are deputy ministers. \r\n The Government has fruitfully completed the \r\nimplementation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy \r\nPapers. That has resulted in, among other things, \r\ncompletion of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries \r\nDebt Initiative and qualification for total debt relief \r\nfrom the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund \r\nand the African Development Bank. Tanzania has \r\nalready benefited from 100 per cent debt cancellation \r\nunder the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative. We \r\nencourage other multilateral institutions and bilateral \r\ndonors to follow suit. \r\n We are now implementing the second phase of \r\nour Poverty Reduction Strategy, called the National \r\nStrategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty, which \r\nis our national framework for the implementation of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) as \r\ninternationally agreed targets for reducing, by 2015, \r\npoverty, hunger, disease, illiteracy, environmental \r\ndegradation and discrimination against women. Unlike \r\nthe first generation of Poverty Reduction Strategy \r\n A/61/PV.8\r\n \r\n3 06-52565 \r\n \r\nPapers — which focused on social sectors — the \r\nNational Strategy focuses on three clusters: economic \r\ngrowth and the reduction of income poverty; quality of \r\nlife and social well-being; and good governance and \r\naccountability. \r\n The Government has realized that without \r\nsustained economic growth, it would be very \r\ndifficult — if not impossible — to achieve the goals of \r\nthe Brussels Programme of Action, the MDGs and \r\nother internationally agreed development goals. We are \r\ngrateful to our development partners for their \r\nconfidence in our Strategy and for their predictable \r\nassistance — including budget support — for our \r\ndevelopment plans. Through this partnership, we have \r\nrealized the importance of timely and predictable \r\nassistance for achieving time-bound targets. \r\n Despite those achievements, there are a number \r\nof challenges that the country must meet to ensure the \r\nfull implementation of the Brussels Programme of \r\nAction. They include natural calamities such as \r\ndroughts; the high cost of energy; and external debt, \r\nwhich continues to use up much of the country’s \r\nrevenue. In addition, the agricultural sector is not \r\nperforming well, as a result of poor technology, \r\ndependence on natural rainfall, inadequate extension \r\nservices and limited resources for research. Other \r\nchallenges include increasing financing for higher \r\neducation and research and to ensure better \r\nperformance in high education, science and \r\ntechnology; and the fight against HIV/AIDS, malaria, \r\ntuberculosis and other infectious diseases. \r\n In order to sustain the achievements that Tanzania \r\nhas registered so far and to adequately address those \r\nchallenges, the support of the international \r\ncommunity — particularly of the developed \r\ncountries — is imperative. The importance of \r\nachieving the official development assistance target of \r\n0.15 to 0.2 per cent cannot be overemphasized. \r\nAddressing the global governance deficit — including \r\nby reforming the Bretton Woods institutions and the \r\nWorld Trade Organization to make them open, \r\nnon-discriminatory, transparent, democratic and \r\ninclusive — would greatly benefit Tanzania in \r\nparticular and the least developed countries in general. \r\nIt would facilitate an increase in resources and reduce \r\ndependence on external assistance. The recent \r\ncancellation of multilateral and bilateral debts, because \r\nit addressed the debt problem, was an unprecedented \r\ninitiative in the development partnership that was \r\nneeded by the least developed countries. It gives us \r\nspace to reorganize our development plans and \r\npriorities while avoiding the pitfalls of another debt \r\ntrap. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Antonio Fernando, Minister of Industry \r\nand Trade of Mozambique. \r\n Mr. Fernando (Mozambique): On behalf of the \r\nGovernment of the Republic of Mozambique and on \r\nmy own behalf, I would like to congratulate you, \r\nMadam, on your election to preside over the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-first session. \r\n Allow me to express our appreciation for the \r\nefforts of the United Nations Office of the High \r\nRepresentative for the Least Developed Countries, \r\nLandlocked Developing Countries and Small Island \r\nDeveloping States, the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme and other relevant United Nations agencies \r\nin advancing the implementation of the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action for the Least Developed \r\nCountries for the Decade 2001-2010. I also commend \r\nthe bureau of the least developed countries for its \r\nleadership during this review process and for \r\nrepresenting the interests and concerns of the least \r\ndeveloped countries in the United Nations system and \r\nin all relevant international and multilateral forums. \r\n My delegation associates itself with the statement \r\ndelivered this morning by the delegation of South \r\nAfrica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. \r\n Let me touch briefly on some of the crucial issues \r\naddressed in Mozambique, some of our experiences \r\nand some of the progress we have made so far. \r\n With regard to good governance, we have \r\nsucceeded in promoting gender balance in our \r\ninstitutions at all levels. As a result of the last general \r\nelections, in 2004, the number of women in parliament \r\nrose to 35.5 per cent of the total number of \r\nrepresentatives — 250 — while in the Government, 24 \r\nper cent of ministers are women, with the figure rising \r\nto 26.6 per cent among deputy ministers. Our Prime \r\nMinister is a woman. \r\n In 2004, we adopted an anti-corruption law. The \r\nGovernment’s priorities in the area of education have \r\nbeen expanding access, improving quality and \r\nstrengthening institutional capacity in various areas of \r\neducational administration. With regard to \r\nstrengthening administration capacities and the \r\nA/61/PV.8  \r\n \r\n06-52565 4 \r\n \r\nmanagement of the educational system, we have been \r\ntraining school directors and managers of the system at \r\nthe provincial and district levels. \r\n In the area of health, our priority has been to \r\nincrease access to, and improve the quality of the \r\nprovision of, primary health care. Efforts are also being \r\nmade to reverse the negative impact of HIV/AIDS, \r\ntuberculosis and malaria. \r\n The Government has long defined agriculture as \r\nthe basis of the country’s economy. Approximately 80 \r\nper cent of the labour force is engaged in agricultural \r\nand other rural activities. Rehabilitation of the existing \r\nagriculture-related infrastructure — including roads, \r\nrailway lines, ports, irrigation systems and water and \r\npower supply systems — has been a Government \r\npriority. \r\n Trade is an essential element for sustainable \r\ndevelopment and poverty reduction, contributing to the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. During the past few \r\nyears, Mozambique has undertaken trade reforms, \r\nincluding a progressive reduction of taxes on \r\ninternational trade and a reduction of barriers to \r\nimports and exports of goods and services. The \r\nMozambique Customs Office is in the process of \r\nharmonizing documentation within the region and \r\nimproving its infrastructure with the goal of facilitating \r\ntrade and reducing delays in the clearing process. \r\n We recently introduced the concept of the “One-\r\nStop Shop” in order to facilitate business. \r\nMozambique’s external trade policies are designed to \r\ncreate an environment conducive to promoting its \r\nproducts in international markets, especially those of \r\nthe developed countries of Europe, America and Asia, \r\nwithout prejudice to the promotion of intra-African \r\ntrade. \r\n While important progress has been made in our \r\ncountry’s efforts to tackle the fight against poverty, it is \r\nvery disappointing to notice that many of the least \r\ndeveloped countries (LDCs) are unlikely to realize the \r\ninternationally agreed economic development goals, \r\nincluding the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\n We would be very much encouraged if this \r\nreview presents successful and fruitful deliberations to \r\nreverse that trend. To meet that objective, the \r\nstrengthening of our shared responsibility and \r\npartnerships involving all relevant stakeholders, \r\nGovernments, civil society and the private sector is \r\nneeded. \r\n The President: I give the floor to His Excellency \r\nThe Honourable Anand Sharma, Minister of State for \r\nForeign Affairs of India. \r\n Mr. Sharma (India): On behalf of the \r\nGovernment of India, I would like to congratulate you, \r\nMadam, on your election as the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and on the successful organization \r\nof this important High-level Meeting to review the \r\nprogress made in the implementation of the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action for the Least Developed \r\nCountries (LDCs). It is a privilege to participate in this \r\nmeeting. \r\n At the outset, I would like to note that the LDCs \r\nthemselves have been making major efforts for their \r\neconomic development, including achievement of the \r\ngoals set out in the Brussels Programme of Action. The \r\nCotonou Strategy is a testimony to their commitment \r\nand determination. \r\n Recent studies have highlighted that many LDCs \r\nhave achieved relatively high rates of economic \r\ngrowth, though the sustainability of the accelerated \r\ngrowth has a significant element of being contingent \r\non commodity prices. The key to achieving sustained \r\neconomic growth in LDCs is developing productive \r\ncapacities. For this, the development partners need to \r\nmove vigorously in supporting the efforts of LDCs. \r\nInternational organizations can also play an important \r\nrole by providing replicable models and information, \r\nwhich would help LDCs to build national capacity for \r\ndomestic resource mobilization. \r\n The issue of debt is a critical one for many LDCs. \r\nWe welcome the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative and \r\nlook forward to the G-8’s political intentions being \r\nfully converted into unqualified commitment. India, on \r\nits part, has demonstrated its commitment to help \r\nLDCs, which are in a particularly difficult position, to \r\nreduce their external debt burden by writing off the \r\ndebt owed by seven heavily indebted poor countries \r\n(HIPCs) which had reached their “decision points”. \r\n Debt relief through HIPC initiatives or the \r\nMultilateral Debt Relief Initiative alone is not \r\nsufficient unless accompanied by efforts to improve \r\ndebt management capacity and a proactive approach to \r\nthe achievement of higher growth, enhanced exports \r\nperformance and revenue mobilization through better \r\n A/61/PV.8\r\n \r\n5 06-52565 \r\n \r\nmarket access and enhanced trade-related \r\nopportunities. Official development assistance (ODA) \r\ndisbursements to LDCs are more than a third short of \r\nthe agreed target. There is an urgent need for new and \r\nadditional commitments to fulfil the commitment by \r\nthe developed countries to meet the 0.15-0.20 per cent \r\ntarget for ODA to LDCs. This needs to happen without \r\nprescription of development modes or policy actions, \r\neither directly or through conditions attached to their \r\nsupport, as has been noted by the Secretary-General. \r\nMoreover, wherever appropriate, aid should help \r\npromote greater foreign and domestic private \r\ninvestments consistent with national priorities for \r\nsustainable development. \r\n The issue of good governance has been very \r\nmuch in focus in the context of development in \r\ndeveloping countries as a whole and LDCS in \r\nparticular. We believe that good governance at the \r\ninternational level is as essential as at the national \r\nlevel. Efforts at domestic resource mobilization need a \r\nsupportive international environment that is stable, \r\npredictable and characterized by non-discriminatory \r\ntrading, monetary and financial systems. LDCs and \r\nother developing economies also need to be assisted in \r\ncapacity-building, particularly in setting up the \r\nrequisite institutional framework to help prioritize \r\nsources and destinations and to attract, evaluate and \r\nfacilitate foreign investment inflows. \r\n India has been a strong votary of South-South \r\ncooperation. Indian technical and economic \r\ncooperation has, since 1964, provided technical \r\nassistance of over US$ 2.5 billion; more than 5,000 \r\nrepresentatives of developing countries receive training \r\nin over 250 institutions in India every year. We have \r\nconstantly tried to increase mutually beneficial \r\neconomic cooperation with LDCs in general and with \r\nthose in our extended neighbourhood in particular. \r\n We are partnering with Afghanistan in a \r\nsignificant manner for infrastructure and capacity-\r\nbuilding projects. We are cooperating in infrastructure \r\nupgrading projects with Myanmar, while our \r\nendeavours with Maldives include specialty health care \r\nand assistance for rehabilitation projects after the \r\ntsunami disaster. We have special relationships with \r\nNepal and Bhutan and a deep interest in their \r\ndevelopment. In the context of recent developments in \r\nNepal, we have offered a significant and immediate \r\npackage of assistance. India is the largest development \r\ncooperation partner of Bhutan. \r\n Africa has always been a high priority for India \r\nand we are strengthening our cooperation through the \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development and through \r\nother efforts such as Team 9 for Western Africa. Our \r\ncommitment in terms of lines of credit and other \r\nconcessional financial assistance add up to almost \r\nUS$ 1 billion. We are also working on a Pan-African \r\nNetwork which would be a major satellite and fibre-\r\noptic connectivity mission covering the entire \r\ncontinent of Africa. The would help to bridge the \r\ndigital divide, while enabling a network linking \r\nlearning centres, universities, hospitals in every \r\ncountry in Africa with counterpart institutions in India \r\nwith a proven expertise in these fields. \r\nMr. Mérorès (Haiti), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n In our endeavour to attain the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals globally by 2015, it is imperative \r\nthat Brussels goals for LDCs are attained by 2010. It is \r\nimportant that the international community comes \r\ntogether to ensure that this happens. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ncall upon His Excellency Mr. Seydou Bouda, Minister \r\nof Economic Development of Burkina Faso. \r\n Mr. Bouda (Burkina Faso) (spoke in French): \r\nThe midterm review of the Programme of Action of the \r\nLeast Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010 \r\nis an opportunity for Member States to examine closely \r\nthe commitments they made in 2001 at Brussels aimed \r\nat lifting the least developed countries (LDCs) out of \r\ntheir situation of precariousness and vulnerability. \r\nThere is no need for me to recall the contents of the \r\nProgramme. What is important is to evaluate together \r\nprogress made and the difficulties encountered in the \r\nimplementation of the seven commitments and, above \r\nall, to clear the way for achieving those goals on time. \r\nThe goals of the Brussels Programme of Action are \r\npraiseworthy and should make possible a significant \r\nimprovement in the economic and social situation of \r\nthe LDCs. \r\n Five years after its adoption, implementation of \r\nthe Brussels Programme of Action has, indeed, met \r\nwith moderate success. The LDCs have intensified \r\ntheir efforts to carry out political and economic \r\nreforms, and their technical and financial partners have \r\nincreased their official development assistance. At the \r\nsame time, however, reviews at the regional level \r\nreveal that most of the inhabitants of the LDCs \r\nA/61/PV.8  \r\n \r\n06-52565 6 \r\n \r\ncontinue to live in extreme poverty. The sudden sharp \r\nrise in oil prices and the recent drop in the price of \r\nexportable raw materials have significantly affected the \r\neconomic and social situation in non-oil-producing \r\ncountries. \r\n In Burkina Faso, the Brussels Programme of \r\nAction is being implemented within the framework of \r\nour national poverty reduction strategy. It takes into \r\naccount all international development goals. On the \r\nwhole, implementation has been fairly satisfactory. The \r\nGovernment of Burkina Faso has continued its efforts \r\nto build domestic capacity with a view to including \r\npopulation issues in its development strategy and to \r\ncreate a legal environment favourable to dealing with \r\npopulation issues. The legitimacy of governance is \r\nsatisfactory. Elections have been held regularly since \r\n1992. The most recent presidential elections and \r\nmunicipal elections, held in November 2005 and April \r\n2006 respectively, took place in accordance with \r\nrelevant international standards. The municipal \r\nelections signalled the full communalization of \r\nBurkina Faso; the greatest challenge facing us is \r\neffective implementation of decentralization. Owing to \r\nthe creation of a strategy framework to combat poverty, \r\nthere have been more effective efforts to combat \r\npoverty in such priority sectors as education, health, \r\nprovision of drinking water and sanitation. Human \r\ndevelopment indicators have clearly improved between \r\n2000 and 2005. \r\n As for strengthening the role of trade in \r\ndevelopment, development strategies and export \r\nprogrammes have been prepared and implemented. \r\nPreparation of an integrated framework is under way \r\nfor better participation by Burkina Faso in the \r\nmultilateral trade system. Burkina Faso is convinced \r\nthat one of the ways to improve the current situation is \r\nthrough better integration into markets through \r\nequitable trade and settlement of the issue of the \r\nenormous subsidies granted to producers in the North, \r\nwhich negatively affect the export receipts of the \r\nLDCs. Burkina Faso’s efforts to achieve economic \r\nstability have led to eligibility for the Multilateral Debt \r\nRelief Initiative. The expected amount of debt to be \r\ncancelled is approximately 800 billion CFA francs. \r\n Partnership is a reality in Burkina Faso. A general \r\nframework of budget support has been established, and \r\nefforts to align foreign assistance with the budget cycle \r\nare evident in the overall context of our anti-poverty \r\nstrategy. However, the greatest challenge facing us is \r\nthe tangible reduction of poverty. The needs are well \r\nknown. It is a question of further expansion of access \r\nto basic social services, economic infrastructure and \r\nmarkets. \r\n Like other LDCs, Burkina Faso is convinced of \r\nthe need for the international community to make an \r\nadditional commitment to supplement persistent \r\ndomestic efforts. Despite the tripling of domestic \r\nresources over a period of five years, achievement of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015 \r\nremains in question. The current approach of budget \r\nsupport, which enables the Government of Burkina \r\nFaso to pursue policies of its own, worked out with its \r\ntechnical and financial partners, is considered to be a \r\ngood one. But the scaling-up process begun by Burkina \r\nFaso several months ago has placed us in a position of \r\nconstantly looking for additional resources for \r\nachieving the MDGs. \r\n I cannot end without mentioning current thinking \r\non innovative sources of financing, a matter of interest \r\nto Burkina Faso. Burkina Faso, like many other LDCs, \r\nsupports such financing mechanisms, in particular the \r\nFrench initiative on an air ticket levy and the United \r\nStates commitment to fight poverty through the \r\nMillennium Challenge Account. \r\n I note with satisfaction that the Strategy for \r\nFurther Implementation of the Brussels Programme of \r\nAction, adopted in June 2006 at Cotonou, mentions the \r\nprogress that has been made, identifies the challenges \r\nlying ahead and makes useful recommendations for \r\nbetter partnership between the LDCs and our \r\ndevelopment partners. Debt cancellation proposals \r\nshould be pursued and should be expanded to include \r\nall the LDCs. Promises to open markets to exports \r\nfrom the LDCs should be backed by concrete and \r\nincentive-producing steps. Foreign direct investment \r\nshould be increased and should focus on increasing the \r\nproduction capacities of the LDCs, which is \r\nindispensable for strong growth and the creation of \r\nrewarding employment. We dare to hope that the \r\nparticipants will turn the Cotonou Strategy into a new \r\nsource of inspiration to improve and reinforce \r\nactivities in favour of the LDCs. \r\n It is possible to hope, but only with full respect \r\nfor the commitments of the Programme of Action will \r\nit be possible to reverse the trend and give the LDCs a \r\nchance to escape the trap of poverty. \r\n A/61/PV.8\r\n \r\n7 06-52565 \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Patteson Oti, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Solomon Islands. \r\n Mr. Oti (Solomon Islands): I take this \r\nopportunity to congratulate Ms. Haya Rashed \r\nAl-Khalifa on her assumption of the presidency of the \r\nAssembly, and I assure her of the support and \r\ncooperation of Solomon Islands. My delegation would \r\nlike to express its most sincere appreciation to the \r\nSecretary-General for his report (A/61/173) on the \r\nmidterm review of the Brussels Programme of Action. \r\nWe express our gratitude to the Office of the High \r\nRepresentative for the Least Developed Countries, \r\nLandlocked Developing Countries and Small Island \r\nDeveloping States, which has worked tirelessly with a \r\nquarter of the United Nations family — the 50 least \r\ndeveloped Members — in monitoring progress on the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action leading up to this \r\nmidterm review. My delegation would also like to \r\nthank the United Nations Development Programme \r\n(UNDP) for its support in funding the Solomon Islands \r\nnational assessment report. Our gratitude goes also to \r\nthe Chair of the global group of least developed \r\ncountries (LDCs), Benin, for its leadership in fostering \r\nthe LDC cause in the discussion of LDC issues, \r\nincluding with various United Nations agencies and \r\npartner countries. \r\n There are a number of gaps within the system \r\ndealing with LDCs. I would like to mention a few of \r\nthem and to suggest possible solutions. \r\n The Pacific subregion is host to five of the least \r\ndeveloped countries. Those countries are \r\ngeographically scattered in the world’s largest ocean. \r\nAll have narrow, resource-based economies and high \r\ncommunication and transportation costs; they have \r\ninadequate infrastructure or lack it entirely; and they \r\nare susceptible to environmental disasters. \r\n Despite those challenges, mixed progress has \r\nbeen made in recent years. Four of the five Pacific \r\nleast developed countries are being considered for \r\ngraduation. The current criteria used to assess countries \r\nfor graduation must be revised, especially for small \r\nisland developing States. The economic vulnerability \r\nof countries must be the principal element in the \r\nformula for determining whether or not a country is \r\neligible for graduation. We have seen all too often that \r\nit takes a cyclone only a few hours to damage an island \r\nState’s economy by a decade or two. For example, the \r\n2004 tsunami experience of Maldives highlighted the \r\nthin line between the environmental vulnerability of \r\nsmall island developing and least developed States and \r\ntheir very existence as States. \r\n Secondly, it is important that LDCs be assisted at \r\nall levels: nationally, regionally and internationally. My \r\ndelegation would like to see more engagement at the \r\nnational level and calls for more coordinated support at \r\nthe regional level to address the special and different \r\nconsideration and treatment required for LDCs. \r\n Solomon Islands is a country emerging from \r\nconflict. Hence, the seven commitments of the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action are being pursued and are \r\nfactored into our national economic reform \r\nprogramme, with bilateral, regional and multilateral \r\nassistance from selected institutions and countries. \r\n The Government makes rural development a \r\npriority in pursuing people-centred development. The \r\nintention is to invest in our people — 80 per cent of \r\nwhom reside in rural areas — thus enabling them to \r\nintegrate into, contribute to and participate in the \r\nnational economy and the international economic \r\nsystem, as well as participate in nation-building. \r\n Solomon Islands upholds the guiding principles \r\nof good governance and continues to ensure that they \r\nare fully reflected within our governmental machinery. \r\nMuch work has been done by the Regional Assistance \r\nMission to the Solomon Islands and the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme, including strengthening and \r\nenhancing the State’s legal and provincial institutions. \r\n I am pleased to note that the United Nations \r\nCapital Development Fund is looking at extending the \r\nstrengthening of the Solomon Islands provincial system \r\nnationwide. That project is vital for the sustainability \r\nof peace in that it unifies a geographically scattered \r\npopulation and brings the Government closer to its \r\npeople. \r\n Children are a country’s greatest asset. Solomon \r\nIslands is committed to making universal primary \r\neducation compulsory and has allocated 10.7 per cent \r\nof its 2006 budget to education. Achieving that goal, \r\nhowever, remains a challenge. \r\n In the area of trade, Solomon Islands continues to \r\nopen up its economy. A new investment act came into \r\nforce two months ago. The legislation aims to reduce \r\nadministrative and regulatory bottlenecks impeding \r\ninvestment, both domestically and for foreign \r\nA/61/PV.8  \r\n \r\n06-52565 8 \r\n \r\ninvestors. The country is also working on broadening \r\nand diversifying its economic base, including by \r\nremoving monopolies in the telecommunications and \r\naviation sectors. That can be achieved only by \r\ntransferring the appropriate technology. Not to do this \r\nwould be to threaten the country’s survival — \r\nespecially in the case of Solomon Islands, where the \r\nexport of round logs remains the country’s principal \r\nincome-earner. \r\n I would like to close by stating that the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action is, after all, built on global \r\npartnership. Its implementation and output are \r\ndetermined by how much we, the global community, \r\ninvest in that partnership. The world’s most vulnerable \r\nStates depend on this framework to enable them to \r\nrealize their economic aspirations, to be free from want \r\nand fear and to live in human dignity. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Cheikh Tidiane \r\nGadio, Senior Minister, Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nSenegal. \r\n Mr. Gadio (Senegal) (spoke in French): I should \r\nlike to congratulate Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa on \r\nher election as President of the General Assembly and \r\nto assure her of the full support of the delegation of \r\nSenegal as she carries out her lofty mandate. \r\n The adoption of the Brussels Programme of \r\nAction for the Least Developed Countries for the \r\nDecade 2001-2010 was an ambitious response to the \r\nconcern of the United Nations that the international \r\ncommunity should give to this category of low-income \r\ncountries — whose development is hampered by major \r\nstructural obstacles — special advantages to enable \r\nthem to overcome that situation. However, five years \r\nof the Programme’s implementation have left us still \r\nperplexed as to whether we will realize our hope to \r\nachieve the stated quantitative development goals by \r\n2010. \r\n A general assessment of these developments \r\nreveals real dynamism in a number of least developed \r\ncountries that have begun significant economic \r\nreforms, strengthened their political stability, improved \r\ntheir macroeconomic performance and increased their \r\nexports at a faster pace. It also reveals a clear desire on \r\nthe part of our aid partners to alleviate debt, increase \r\nthe number of development financing sources and open \r\nup markets. \r\n However, the situation of least developed \r\ncountries has not changed appreciably, as attested to by \r\nthe Trade and Development Report, 2006, of the \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development \r\nand the report of the Secretary-General (A/61/173). \r\nThat is because the progress made so far is not \r\nreflected in people’s living conditions, and the \r\nindispensable support of partners has not met \r\nexpectations; indeed, sometimes it has been completely \r\nlacking. \r\n Over the past five years, Senegal has done its best \r\nto translate the purposes and objectives of the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action into concrete actions. That has \r\nenabled us to achieve satisfactory results, with an \r\naverage annual economic growth rate of 5 per cent \r\nbetween 2002 and 2005. Progress has also been made \r\nin strengthening democracy, simplifying the \r\nadministrative procedures related to private \r\ninvestment, reducing the business tax burden, \r\nreforming the investment code, developing basic \r\ninfrastructure and establishing a comprehensive \r\nmechanism to fight corruption and a national good \r\ngovernance programme. \r\n In the social arena, we should note improved \r\naccess to education — which takes up 40 per cent of \r\nthe national budget — and to health services — which \r\ntake up 10 per cent — with free care for the elderly. \r\nMoreover, there is now greater participation by women \r\nand a greater role for them in economic, political, civic \r\nand cultural life, and there has been a considerable \r\nreduction in the HIV/AIDS prevalence rate, which is \r\nnow 0.7 per cent. \r\n Those results would have been even more \r\nsignificant if we had overcome the sizable structural \r\nconstraints shared by many least developed countries. \r\nThat is why Senegal has chosen to create structures to \r\nfurther improve the business environment and make \r\nbusinesses more competitive. These include the \r\nnational agency to promote investment and capital \r\nprojects, the presidential investment council, the \r\nagency to promote the development and management \r\nof small and medium enterprises and, recently, the \r\nSenegalese agency to promote exports. \r\n By establishing that support machinery, my \r\ncountry is seeking to participate in a dynamic of \r\naccelerated growth. Our strategy document, covering \r\nmainly the period 2006-2015, sets out a growth target \r\nof at least 7 per cent, which is needed to create enough \r\n A/61/PV.8\r\n \r\n9 06-52565 \r\n \r\njobs, significantly improve household living conditions \r\nand achieve the Millennium Development Goals by \r\n2015. \r\n With an average of 0.5 per cent of exports and 0.7 \r\nof imports, the part played by least developed countries \r\nin international trade remains very small. This situation \r\nhighlights the problem of building up the capacity of \r\nthe least developed countries to produce and supply \r\ngoods for trade. That is essential if they are to play \r\ntheir full part in an open world economy. \r\n One way of achieving this would be to exploit the \r\nmany potential opportunities that remain unnoticed or \r\nunused: surpluses in the workforce, latent \r\nentrepreneurial talent, unexplored traditional knowledge \r\nand unexploited natural resources. We deem it important \r\nto stress, in the context of trade, the need for increased \r\npreferential access by the least developed countries to \r\ninternational markets. \r\n In that respect, we most sincerely hope for an \r\nearly resumption of World Trade Organization \r\ndiscussions so as to quell the fears and concerns of the \r\nleast developed countries, whose situation could \r\nbecome even more precarious now that the discussions \r\nhave been suspended. \r\n Senegal welcomes the considerable efforts made \r\nby the partners to support the initiative of the least \r\ndeveloped countries, but other large-scale initiatives \r\nwill be required if we are overcome the numerous \r\nobstacles that remain. \r\n These obstacles include our heavy dependence on \r\nforeign financing and our low savings rate; a heavy \r\nexternal debt burden; instability in the price of \r\ncommodities, which represent 67 per cent of the \r\nexports of least developed countries; the prevalence of \r\ninfectious disease, in particular HIV/AIDS — indeed, \r\naccording to the Joint United Nations Programme on \r\nHIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the least developed countries, \r\nwith only 11 per cent of the world’s population, \r\naccount for 37 per cent of deaths from HIV/AIDS; \r\ninadequate infrastructures; and, finally and most \r\nimportantly, the massive spike in oil prices, which \r\nthreatens to reduce to nought all the efforts made by \r\nthe non-oil-producing least developed countries. The \r\nbudgets of our countries cannot handle this price \r\nincrease, which pushes production costs to exorbitant \r\nlevels. \r\n The least developed countries want to take their \r\nplace in the global economy. All they ask is support in \r\nforging a sound and healthy partnership that will \r\nenable them, through joint efforts, to emerge from their \r\nvulnerable situation and to become better integrated in \r\nthe globalization process. \r\n Hence the Cotonou Strategy, which not only \r\nunderlines the achievements made but also stresses the \r\nchallenges we must meet, along with our partners, and \r\nways of doing so. What we need is a genuine \r\npartnership that goes beyond lip service and gives \r\npriority to ensuring respect by all States for their \r\nobligations and undertakings, which were freely \r\nentered into. \r\n In conclusion, I hope that in 2010 the global \r\npartnership for least developed countries will make a \r\nhistoric leap forward so that the category of least \r\ndeveloped countries can become a thing of the past. \r\nThat is the real challenge before us, and meeting it \r\nwould be the ultimate proof of our will to do so. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I call \r\non His Excellency Mr. Jean Max Bellerive, Minister of \r\nPlanning and International Cooperation of Haiti. \r\n Mr. Bellerive (Haiti) (spoke in French): Allow \r\nme at the outset to extend to Ms. Haya Rashed \r\nAl-Khalifa my warmest congratulations and those of \r\nmy delegation for her leadership of the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-first regular session. I \r\nalso have the great honour of extending to the \r\nAssembly the brotherly greetings of the Haitian people \r\nand of President René Préval and Prime Minister \r\nJacques Edouard Alexis. \r\n I should like also to extend my congratulations to \r\nAmbassador Anwarul Chowdhury, High Representative \r\nof the Secretary-General for the Least Developed \r\nCountries, Landlocked Developing Countries and \r\nSmall Island Developing States, for the considerable \r\nwork he has done in conjunction with the \r\nimplementation of the Brussels Programme of Action \r\nfor least developed countries. \r\n The delegation that I have the honour to head \r\nwhole-heartedly supports the statement made by the \r\nGroup of 77 and China on behalf of the least developed \r\ncountries as well as the statement made by the \r\nPresident of Benin, the Coordinator for Least \r\nDeveloped Countries. We welcome also the report of \r\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, contained in \r\nA/61/PV.8  \r\n \r\n06-52565 10 \r\n \r\ndocument A/61/173. The report provides a concise and \r\ncomprehensive assessment of all initiatives and actions \r\ntaken over the past five years, since the adoption of the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action in 2001. Given the \r\nrelevance of the observations and recommendations \r\ncontained therein, the report is one of the best tools for \r\npursuing the implementation of the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action. \r\n The Government of the Republic of Haiti \r\nwelcomes the holding of this midterm comprehensive \r\nglobal review of the implementation of the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action for the least developed countries \r\nfor the decade 2001-2010. In our view, this review \r\nrepresents a milestone in the context of the sixty-first \r\nsession regular session of our Organization. This is an \r\nopportunity once again to draw the attention of the \r\ninternational community and of all people of goodwill \r\nworldwide to the deplorable and often tragic conditions \r\nin which more than 800 million people. \r\n In the time that has elapsed between the First \r\nUnited Nations Conference on the Least Developed \r\nCountries and this midterm review, almost everything \r\nhas been said on the situation of least developed \r\ncountries. There have been numerous analyses — each \r\nmore edifying than the last — which have outlined the \r\ninitiatives and actions required so as to eradicate the \r\ndeeply rooted ills affecting the neediest peoples living \r\nin least developed countries. \r\n We must now move forward. The Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action is at a crucial phase. It must be \r\nimplemented, and the main courses of action required \r\nfor success must be outlined in the context of an \r\nirreversible process. Let us take this midterm review as \r\nan opportunity to set an example and to make clear our \r\nwill and our determination sincerely to break with the \r\nnow long-standing practice of not respecting \r\ncommitments. Let us overcome chronic shortcomings \r\nin the area of the implementation of agreed decisions \r\nand measures, in particular with regard to social and \r\neconomic development programmes. \r\n The Government of Haiti views the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action as one of the most promising \r\ninstruments available to the United Nations for meeting \r\nthe challenges of eradicating abject poverty in the least \r\ndeveloped countries and reducing their vulnerability to \r\nongoing threats. That is why particular attention has \r\nbeen devoted to this instrument; indeed, we have \r\nintegrated it in our national poverty eradication and \r\nsustainable development plans. \r\n This midterm review comes on the heels of a \r\nseries of consultations and exchanges of views and \r\nexperience on the ground, which our representatives \r\nengaged in at Addis Ababa, Bangkok and Cotonou, \r\nfrom 5 to 8 June last. The Cotonou Strategy, the \r\noutcome of that exercise, is the result of the great \r\ncourage shown by the representatives of the least \r\ndeveloped countries in drafting the document, which is \r\nevidence of their awareness to redouble their \r\ndetermination to work, with the concerted and effective \r\ninvolvement of all stakeholders — development \r\npartners, non-governmental organizations, civil society \r\nand the private sector — to put an end once and for all \r\nto the continuing downward trend in the living \r\nconditions of the majority of the least developed \r\ncountries. \r\n The Cotonou Strategy, the outcome of the \r\ndetermined efforts of the representatives of the least \r\ndeveloped countries and the significant contribution of \r\nseveral United Nations specialized agencies and \r\ninstitutions, is not intended to replace the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action, as some of our partners implied \r\nduring the expert meeting held in New York from 5 to \r\n7 September last in the framework of the midterm \r\nreview. On the contrary, the Cotonou Strategy draws on \r\nthe Brussels Programme of Action and on the \r\ncommitments and objectives outlined therein, making \r\nrelevant recommendations and proposing corrective \r\nmeasures to be taken at this midterm review. \r\n The facts speak for themselves. The least \r\ndeveloped countries as a group are still strongly \r\naffected by their specific conditions — abject poverty, \r\nweakness in terms of human institutional capacities, \r\nvulnerability to external financial and economic \r\nshocks, and lack of resources. It is also important to \r\nunderscore that those negative factors continue to \r\nprevail despite the commendable progress achieved by \r\nthe least developed countries, with considerable \r\nassistance on the part of their development partners. \r\n Against that backdrop, the Republic of Haiti is \r\nconcerned at the incomprehensible attempt made by \r\ncertain partners — not the least significant ones — to \r\nreject the Cotonou Strategy without taking the time to \r\nfamiliarize themselves with its contents. Whatever the \r\nfate of the Cotonou Strategy in terms of the final \r\ndeclaration of this high-level meeting, the Republic of \r\n A/61/PV.8\r\n \r\n11 06-52565 \r\n \r\nHaiti views the Strategy as a vital instrument for the \r\nimplementation of the Brussels Programme of Action, \r\non which it is based. \r\n The Government of Haiti is aware of the fact that \r\nthe four years remaining before 2010 are crucial for the \r\ncommitments made in the Brussels Programme of \r\nAction. \r\n Despite delays due to a lack of means and \r\nresources to restore, once and for all, internal security, \r\nthe competent State bodies continue to manage \r\nprogrammes and projects linked to national sustainable \r\ndevelopment and poverty reduction strategies. The \r\nCotonou Strategy would be added to existing \r\nmechanisms, in particular the Brussels Programme of \r\nAction itself and the Interim Cooperation Framework, \r\nto ensure comprehensive development through a \r\ngradual and steady improvement in the qualitative and \r\nquantitative indicators of progress towards our \r\nobjectives. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency The Honourable Datuk Seri Syed \r\nHamid Albar, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Malaysia. \r\n Mr. Albar (Malaysia): I am grateful for the \r\nconvening of this important High-level Meeting, held \r\npursuant to resolution 60/228, and for the introductory \r\nstatement made by the President. I would also like to \r\nthank the Secretary-General for his statement and for \r\nhis useful report (A/61/173). \r\n The Secretary-General’s report clearly indicates \r\nthat, despite some progress made since the adoption of \r\nthe Brussels Programme of Action in 2001, the stark \r\nfact remains that the possibility of least developed \r\ncountries (LDCs) achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) by 2015 remains small. \r\nThe report also indicates that the reality on the ground \r\nremains complex, with different LDCs facing particular \r\nchallenges of their own. It is therefore important to \r\nnote that, given the complexity of the issue before us, \r\nit is clear that creativity, innovation and determination \r\nare required. \r\n We know that in an unprecedented reversal of \r\nhistorical trends, life expectancy is declining in several \r\ncountries, especially those experiencing AIDS and civil \r\nstrife. In addition, rapid population growth, \r\nurbanization and environmental degradation also pose \r\ndifficulties for the LDCs. This situation is indeed a \r\ncause of great concern for us all, as the 50 countries \r\ncategorized as LDCs contain roughly 600 million \r\npeople, or one tenth of humanity. This is occurring in \r\nan age when the human family possesses the resources, \r\nexpertise and technology to ensure that each and every \r\none of its members can be saved from life-threatening \r\npoverty, which unfortunately, is the lot of those in the \r\nLDCs. \r\n In this connection, while I commend the recent \r\nincrease in the level of official development assistance \r\n(ODA) to the LDCs — reaching $23.5 billion in 2004, \r\nan increase of 11 per cent over 2003 — this figure is \r\nfar less than the target of providing 0.2 per cent of \r\ngross national income of the Organization for \r\nEconomic Cooperation and Development countries to \r\nthe LDCs. Indeed in 2004, that figure stood at 0.08 per \r\ncent. At the same time, that increase in ODA can be \r\nattributed to one-off factors such as debt cancellation. \r\n But the level of ODA is not the only important \r\nissue that needs to be addressed. Of equal importance \r\nto the LDCs, and indeed to the developing countries as \r\na whole, is ensuring that the global economic \r\narchitecture is supportive of the developmental efforts \r\nof these countries. \r\n As trade is a central pillar of the global economic \r\narchitecture, it is essential that the stalled World Trade \r\nOrganization (WTO) talks be revived. Indeed, it is very \r\ndisconcerting that many initiatives that are beneficial \r\nto the LDCs, such as increased market access and \r\nassistance to facilitate trade, remain in abeyance due to \r\nthe single-undertaking principle. While efforts to \r\nrevive the talks continue, it is essential that the \r\ndeveloped world continue to assist the LDCs in their \r\nefforts to integrate more fully into the global trading \r\nsystem. In particular, steps must be taken to assist the \r\nLDCs improve their physical infrastructure such as \r\nports and roads. Technical assistance could also be \r\ngiven to help the LDCs improve their business \r\nprocesses. \r\n Further, it is of concern to us that for LDCs, \r\naccession to the WTO remains a long, cumbersome and \r\nexpensive process. Although some 32 LDCs are \r\ncurrently members of the WTO, only two have joined it \r\nsince the adoption of the Brussels Programme of \r\nAction, while 10 remain at various stages of accession. \r\n Current global economic imbalances, based on \r\nthe twin deficits faced by the economy of the United \r\nStates, also cast a long shadow on the economies of the \r\nLDCs. This is due to the fact that many LDCs continue \r\nA/61/PV.8  \r\n \r\n06-52565 12 \r\n \r\nto be dependent on one or two commodities as their \r\nprimary means of export earnings, rendering them \r\nvulnerable to volatile swings in the prices of those \r\ncommodities. Further, it should be noted that the high \r\nconcentration of exports in certain products makes \r\nsome LDCs particularly vulnerable to the erosion of \r\ntrade preferences. One of the measures to overcome \r\nthis problem is to ensure that assistance is given to the \r\nLDCs to build their productive capacities to diversify \r\ninto non-preference areas. \r\n Under the rubric of South-South cooperation, \r\nMalaysia has, in its own small way, sought to play our \r\nrole by entering into technical cooperation programmes \r\nwith LDCs. We now have 133 countries as participant \r\ncountries, including the vast majority of the LDCs, and \r\nwe offer more than 100 programmes involving 52 \r\ntraining institutions. Since the inception of the \r\nMalaysian technical cooperation programme in 1980, \r\nmore than 11,000 persons have participated in the \r\nprogramme. \r\n In addition, Malaysia is also looking at newer and \r\nbetter ways of cooperating with LDCs in the area of \r\nhuman resource development. Harnessing the power of \r\nnew technologies such as information and \r\ncommunication technologies (ICT) is one such way. It \r\nis for that reason that Malaysia hosted the first meeting \r\nof the Global Alliance for ICT Policy and Development \r\nin June of this year. We did so motivated by our \r\nawareness that knowledge, technology and innovation \r\nare replacing land, labour and capital as the key drivers \r\nof wealth-creation and economic growth today. At the \r\nsame time, however, it is unfortunate that those who \r\nare most in need of, and who stand the most to benefit \r\nfrom ICT, are those who have the least access to those \r\ntechnologies. This is due to factors such as lack of \r\ninfrastructure and relevant content, poor technological \r\nsupport and the dominance of English on the Internet. \r\n Technology transfer and technical assistance from \r\nthe developed countries are prerequisites for our \r\novercoming these difficulties. ICT and innovations \r\nsuch as the creation of a “cyber peace corps” or a \r\nglobal virtual resource centre need to be fostered and \r\ndeveloped in order to assist developing countries. \r\n In addition to ICT, Malaysia also believes that the \r\ninvolvement of the private sector in capacity-building \r\nprogrammes is a new and promising avenue of \r\nassisting the LDCs. Malaysia initiated the \r\nestablishment of the capacity-building programme for \r\nthe countries of the Organization of the Islamic \r\nConference (OIC). It should be noted that 22 out of the \r\n50 members of the group of LDCs are from the OIC; \r\nimproving the conditions in those countries would go a \r\nlong way in reducing the number of the world’s \r\npoorest. \r\n In conclusion, I believe that while this Meeting \r\naffords a valuable opportunity to reaffirm our \r\ncommitment to improving the situation in the LDCs, \r\nmore needs to be done in order to find more creative \r\nways of addressing the complex range of difficulties \r\nfacing the LDCs. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Eltigani Salih Fidail, Minister of \r\nEconomic Development of the Sudan. \r\n Mr. Fidail (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): It gives me \r\ngreat pleasure to convey to Ms. Haya Rashed \r\nAl-Khalifa my sincere congratulations on her election \r\nto steer the work of this High-level Meeting, a task she \r\nhas been undertaking with capability, skill and wisdom. \r\nThis promises a positive outcome that will spark great \r\nefforts towards fulfilling our desired goals. \r\n Allow me, in my personal capacity and on behalf \r\nof my delegation, warmly to thank the organizers of \r\nthis important Meeting, for their great efforts to \r\npromote the goals of development, to eradicate poverty \r\nand want and to realize the aspiration of our peoples to \r\ngenuine peace and development. \r\n My delegation wishes to associate itself with the \r\nstatement made by South Africa on behalf of the Group \r\nof 77 and China and to express our appreciation to the \r\nSecretary-General for the progress report he has \r\nsubmitted on the implementation of the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action for the Least Developed \r\nCountries for the Decade 2001-2010, and for the useful \r\ninformation and valuable statistics it contains; this all \r\ntestifies to the work we have accomplished during the \r\nreporting period. \r\n Although there has been progress in \r\nimplementing the Brussels Programme of Action, as \r\nstated in the report, poverty levels continue to be on \r\nthe rise in many of the least developed countries. \r\nDespite the improvements in some of these countries, \r\nespecially the oil-exporting ones, poverty has not been \r\neradicated. That is due to known structural and organic \r\ncauses in the economic infrastructure of these \r\ncountries. \r\n A/61/PV.8\r\n \r\n13 06-52565 \r\n \r\n The Sudan is greatly alarmed by the rising spread \r\nof HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other lethal \r\nepidemics in the least developed countries, particularly \r\nthose in Africa, at a time when other important social \r\nindicators continue to show considerable decline, \r\nthereby aggravating the poverty situation and placing \r\nthe implementation of the Brussels Programme of \r\nAction beyond the reach of many States. We must \r\ndeploy huge efforts in facing the many problems, \r\nmainly those related to renewing and strengthening the \r\ncapacity of LDCs and their development partners to \r\nimplement the Brussels Programme of Action and \r\nimprove human skills and capabilities. \r\n The availability of financial resources is crucial \r\nto the success of the Brussels Programme of Action. It \r\nis incumbent upon all development partners to meet the \r\nobligations they have undertaken in the areas of \r\nassistance, debt forgiveness and capacity-building. We \r\nwould also like to stress the important role of \r\ninternational trade in achieving those objectives \r\nthrough access to markets and other measures aimed at \r\nfacilitating trade. \r\n It has become clear from the few meetings that \r\nwere convened in Bangkok and Addis Ababa, in \r\naddition to the ministerial meeting in Cotonou, that a \r\ngreat number of the LDCs have made considerable \r\nprogress in various areas, such as in development, \r\nhuman rights, conflict resolution, democratization, \r\ngood governance, the rule of law, combating corruption \r\nand good management. A great many of those countries \r\nhave also made considerable progress in developing \r\npoverty reduction strategy papers, as well as in \r\ndesigning national environmental programmes. \r\n It would, however, be incorrect to assume that \r\nthose countries can no longer be considered least \r\ndeveloped, since many factors still impede the \r\nimplementation of the Brussels Programme of Action, \r\nand those countries are still hampered in achieving \r\ntheir development objectives. These problems include \r\nthe following elements. First, there is a scarcity of \r\nfinancing for development projects. Here, it should be \r\nemphasized that the Brussels Programme of Action is \r\npredicated on the concept of partnership between the \r\ndonor countries and the LDCs, while stressing the need \r\nfor donor countries to fulfil their obligations and \r\nprovide the necessary assistance to break the cycle of \r\npoverty and backwardness. \r\n Secondly, there is a lasting inadequacy in the \r\nLDCs as far as infrastructure and capacity-building are \r\nconcerned. This is one of the main objectives of the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action. There is a need to \r\nunderline the partnership dimension in this area. \r\n Thirdly, the report of the Secretary-General states \r\nthat a certain number of the LDCs have become oil-\r\nproducing States. In this respect, it should be noted that \r\nthe circumstances under which those countries were \r\nadmitted into the oil-exporting club tended to detract \r\nfrom their ability to benefit from development owing \r\nto the inadequacies of their national capacities and \r\ninfrastructures. It is of critical importance for \r\ndeveloped countries to help augment the efforts being \r\nmade by the LDCs to eradicate poverty, by enabling \r\nthem to join the world trade system, allowing their \r\nagricultural products to access foreign markets, and \r\ngranting them adequate safeguards under a world \r\neconomic system in which these LDCs would be \r\nassured of fair representation in its institutions. \r\n As we gather here today to review and assess our \r\nimplementation of the Brussels Programme of Action, \r\nas part of our overall goal of meeting our \r\ndevelopmental objective, we would like to underscore \r\nthe importance of the Cotonou Strategy, which \r\nrepresents the fruit of serious and strenuous efforts by \r\nthe LDCs and their development partners in the United \r\nNations system, institutions of civil society, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, and other stakeholders. \r\nThe Cotonou Strategy is, therefore, an effective tool in \r\nassessing the implementation of the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action and in highlighting what has \r\nbeen achieved and what remains to be addressed. We \r\nbelieve that the Cotonou Strategy will help us proceed \r\ntowards implementing the remaining objectives in a \r\nspirit of cooperation, collaboration and true \r\npartnership. \r\n The Sudan has committed itself politically to the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action for the LDCs, as is \r\ndemonstrated by its establishment of a High-level \r\nCommission comprised of representatives of various \r\nministries, as well as a number of institutions that \r\nrepresent civil society and the private sector. This \r\nCommission has undertaken studies of the Seven \r\nCommitments contained in the Brussels Programme of \r\nAction, and in 2002 the Sudan issued its first report on \r\nthe subject, followed by the creation of subsidiary \r\ncommittees to ensure the Sudan’s accuracy in reporting \r\nA/61/PV.8  \r\n \r\n06-52565 14 \r\n \r\nand to highlight the steps that need to be taken to fulfil \r\nthe remaining commitments. \r\n The second report was issued in 2003, and the \r\nthird in 2004. As for the year 2005, the subcommittees \r\nproduced a comprehensive report on the Sudan’s \r\nachievements for the purposes of the Mid-Term \r\nReview of the Brussels Programme of Action covering \r\nthe period 2001-2005. The report was adopted by the \r\nHigh-level Commission. In addition, the Sudan \r\nactively participated in meetings that were convened in \r\nAddis Ababa for the East and Central Africa Group, as \r\nwell as a Regional Group Meeting for the Least \r\nDeveloped Countries. The Sudan is currently working \r\nto finalize the first phase of the national programme to \r\nreduce severe poverty. A lot of difficult circumstances \r\nhave prevented us from implementing this Programme, \r\nnamely our preoccupation with the achievement of \r\npeace. Now, after peace has been achieved, we have \r\nmade great strides in setting up the foundations of \r\ndemocracy by adopting an interim constitution that \r\nguarantees all constitutional rights for citizens and lays \r\nthe foundations for a process of sustainable \r\ndevelopment in all parts of the country. It also ensures \r\nthat all segments of society can participate actively in \r\nthe development process by combating corruption and \r\nensuring the rule of law. \r\n After the signing of the Comprehensive Peace \r\nAgreement and the Darfur Peace Agreement, the whole \r\ncountry has been striving to implement these \r\nagreements and to fulfil the obligations stipulated \r\ntherein. This is indeed a major undertaking, in which \r\nthe Government is shouldering the greater burden. \r\n There are yet other major obstacles hampering \r\nthe country’s progress, the most important of which is \r\nthe debt problem. The Sudan is, unfortunately, one of \r\nthe few countries that has not been able to benefit from \r\ndebt relief initiatives, particularly the Heavily Indebted \r\nPoor Countries (HIPC) debt initiative, although it had \r\nmet its obligations and satisfied all the requirements \r\nand criteria. This obstacle will perhaps impede the \r\nimplementation of the Peace Agreements and the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action. \r\n For these reasons, my delegation wishes to renew \r\nits appeal to the international community to fulfil its \r\nobligations under the Oslo Conference and to include \r\nthe Sudan in the list of countries whose debts are to be \r\nrelieved, in accordance with the Group of Eight (G-8) \r\ninitiative. In order to make peace sustainable and to \r\nimplement the Brussels Programme of Action, the debt \r\nburden and related issues will have to be addressed. \r\n We would also like to draw attention to the \r\nchallenges that we face after the conflict. We need \r\nmore international assistance and support to succeed in \r\nour reconstruction and rehabilitation and to make peace \r\nsustainable. My delegation welcomes the European \r\nUnion initiative to continue to seek solutions to the \r\nremaining debt problems of the heavily-indebted \r\ncountries that have not benefited from previous \r\nmeasures on debt relief and looks forward to joining \r\nthe group of beneficiaries of such debt relief as soon as \r\npossible. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Jens Stoltenberg, \r\nPrime Minister of the Kingdom of Norway. \r\n Mr. Stoltenberg (Norway): One of the most \r\nhaunting challenges of our time is to narrow the gap \r\nbetween the rapidly developing world and those parts \r\nwhich are lagging behind. Billions of people are \r\nmoving towards a brighter future. But hundreds of \r\nmillions are not. The challenge is new to present \r\ngenerations. Now we can radically reduce poverty. We \r\ncan end the long night of underdevelopment. The poor \r\ncountries do not need to be lectured on what it takes to \r\nbreak out of the trap. They know the need for investing \r\nin people, health, education and good governance. \r\n The least developed countries themselves have \r\nthe primary responsibility for their own development. \r\nAnd they have taken the leadership role in the midterm \r\nreview process. They need long-term partnerships with \r\ncountries that understand that the fortunate ones are \r\nunder a compelling obligation to care. \r\n Norway was among the first to reach the goal of \r\nallocating 40 per cent of its bilateral development \r\nassistance to least developed countries; we reached it \r\nin 2002. We have stayed on the top of the list of such \r\ndonors since then, together with those other countries \r\nwhich are always on the top when donor performance \r\nis measured. This year again we are moving ever closer \r\nto donating 1 per cent of our income as development \r\naid. We reached the 0.7 per cent target decades ago and \r\nthe 0.9 per cent target years ago. \r\n This year I have the honour of serving as \r\nco-Chair of the High-level Panel on System-wide \r\nCoherence, together with my good colleagues from \r\nMozambique and Pakistan. The Panel will present its \r\n A/61/PV.8\r\n \r\n15 06-52565 \r\n \r\nreport to the Secretary-General later this autumn. We \r\nare in the process of finalizing our recommendations, \r\nhaving met with a great number of stakeholders and \r\ncountry representatives. I sincerely hope that the Panel \r\nwill contribute to a United Nations that is even more \r\nresponsive to the needs of least developed countries, \r\nand that the United Nations can deliver better services \r\nfor development, environment and humanitarian \r\nassistance. \r\n Six years ago, in 2000, here in New York, I \r\nparticipated in the adoption of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals as Prime Minister of Norway. We \r\nknew then, as we know now, about the many fine and \r\nsolemn declarations adopted by world leaders. Those \r\ndeclarations have raised the hope for a better tomorrow \r\namong the poor and destitute peoples and nations. But \r\nmany have remained unfulfilled. The Brussels plan \r\nmust not end up in that category. \r\n I felt then, back in 2000, that there was a risk that \r\nwe would not feel compelled to deliver on those \r\npromises and that the world would return to business as \r\nusual. That is why Norway has decided to take a \r\nspecial responsibility for realizing at least one of the \r\nMillennium Goals. We are going to take a lead role in \r\nachieving Millennium Goal 4: to help reduce child \r\nmortality by two thirds by the year 2015. It is a \r\nHerculean task, but it is possible. We have the means; \r\nit only takes finance and organization in order to \r\ndeliver. \r\n Our first step towards achieving that Goal is \r\nproviding vaccines for all of the children of the world. \r\nI announced earlier today that Norway has decided to \r\nincrease our budget allocations for immunization and \r\nchild survival from $75 million to $125 million \r\nannually. We need to work together to develop a global \r\nstrategy to reach Millennium Goal 4. What we need is \r\na global business plan. The plan will spell out clearly \r\nhow we can best organize ourselves, the financing \r\ninstruments we need and the pathways to achieve our \r\ngoal. We have the will and the knowledge to do so. \r\nReducing child mortality is a worthy goal. We cannot \r\npursue it halfway or part-time. That is why I invite \r\neverybody here to join this global campaign. \r\n Norway is a country of 4 million people. But at \r\nthe same time, we are the fifth largest donor to the \r\noperational activities of the United Nations. We cannot \r\ndo everything, but we have set out with high ambition \r\nto save the lives of millions of little children. Those \r\nmillions are the people who will live and who will help \r\nlift the poor countries out of poverty in our lifetime. I \r\nam humbled and proud to be part of that sea change. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the floor to Her Excellency Mrs. Marie Goreth \r\nNizigama, Minister of Planning of Burundi. \r\n Mrs. Nizigama (Burundi) (spoke in French): I \r\nwould like at the outset to join others who have spoken \r\nbefore me in hailing the masterful work of the team \r\nthat organized this midterm review of the \r\nimplementation of the Brussels Programme of Action \r\nfor the Least Developed Countries. I would also like to \r\ntake this opportunity, on behalf of the people of \r\nBurundi and its Government, to warmly congratulate \r\nthe Chair and Vice-Chairs of the preparatory meeting \r\nof experts and to thank the Secretary-General for the \r\nquality of the report submitted for discussion \r\n(A/61/173). The report clearly and courageously sets \r\nout the challenges our countries face as they implement \r\nthe decade-long Programme of Action for the Least \r\nDeveloped Countries (LDCs) and lays down strategies \r\nto tackle those problems and to accelerate the \r\nimplementation of the Programme over the next five \r\nyears. \r\n The Brussels Programme of Action came at a \r\ntime when Burundi was beset by a long and serious \r\ncrisis that had undermined the foundations of national \r\nunity and of our economy. The first five years of the \r\nProgramme coincided with the process through which \r\nwe emerged from the crisis. The process created a \r\nsense of optimism and hope for the future of our \r\ncountry. \r\n To this day the country has been working to \r\nre-establish itself, although repercussions from the \r\ncrisis remain. The newly elected authorities are \r\nworking to establish a favourable climate for \r\npeacebuilding and renewed economic and social \r\ndevelopment. \r\n The Government of Burundi has just completed \r\nthe preparation of a strategic framework for economic \r\ngrowth and poverty reduction, whose implementation \r\nwill make it possible to ease the suffering of people \r\nravaged by more than a decade of civil war. This \r\nshould also make it possible for Burundi to complete \r\nits application for debt relief under the Heavily \r\nIndebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. \r\nA/61/PV.8  \r\n \r\n06-52565 16 \r\n \r\n The challenge of peace and democracy that \r\nBurundi has accepted is a significant step towards \r\npolitical and social stability, which is an indispensable \r\ncondition for pursuing the strategies in the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action. \r\n In the post-conflict situation of a country like \r\nBurundi, where famine, disease, high rates of \r\nunemployment and degradation of the environment are \r\nthe daily lot of millions of people, gains in the fields of \r\npolitics and security can be consolidated only if \r\nadequate answers are found to deal with these \r\nscourges. \r\n I urge the friendly countries and organizations \r\nmeeting here, which have supported the people of \r\nBurundi in difficult times, not to give up and to \r\ncontinue to provide their support and solidarity, \r\nespecially at the Round Table planned for the end of \r\n2006. You are aware that implementation of the \r\nnational programme of action, based on the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action, has taken place at an especially \r\ndifficult time for Burundi and that there remains much \r\nwork to do to achieve our goals. \r\n The Government of Burundi is aware that under \r\nthese conditions, massive stimulation will have to be \r\ngiven to our economy if we want to achieve the goals \r\nof the Brussels Programme of Action by 2010. That \r\nimplies significantly raising the rate of economic \r\ngrowth, which, in turn, requires a corresponding level \r\nof investment. This goal can be achieved only if the \r\ninternational community is willing to back strongly the \r\nefforts of the Government of Burundi. \r\n The difficulties we face today are, unfortunately, \r\nthose faced by most of the least developed countries \r\n(LDCs), even those that have enjoyed relative political \r\nstability. An alarming fact is that the relatively high \r\nrate of economic growth recorded in most of the LDCs \r\nduring the past five years cannot be sustained because \r\nits base is weak and not diversified and has not been \r\naccompanied by the creation of stable and rewarding \r\nemployment. The economic growth achieved so far \r\ncannot be considered sufficient for a sustainable \r\nreduction of poverty in these countries. \r\n The common problems identified in this midterm \r\nreview of the Brussels Programme of Action are so \r\nmany that I cannot list them in the time allotted me. \r\nNonetheless, despite their large number and \r\ncomplexity, these challenges are far from unavoidable \r\nfor LDCs. We have the means, the courage and the \r\ndetermination needed to succeed within the period \r\nplanned, namely by 2010. \r\n For this, the LDCs need the support of the \r\ninternational community in their efforts to overcome \r\ntheir difficulties. Above all, the LDCs need adequate \r\nfinancial means at their disposal through increases in \r\nofficial development assistance. They also need justice \r\nand fairness in their trade relations with their partners \r\nin the North. Specifically addressing this last point, I \r\nwould like to ask the United Nations, through the \r\nSecretary-General, to help the LDCs in their search for \r\nsustainable solutions to problems created by the \r\nmultilateral trade system, such as access for our \r\nexports to the markets of the developed countries, the \r\nsubsidies granted by the developed countries to their \r\nfarmers and the internal subsidies that undermine the \r\ncompetitiveness of exports from the LDCs on the \r\ninternational market. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Li Zhaoxing, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the People’s Republic of China. \r\n Mr. Li Zhaoxing (China) (spoke in Chinese): On \r\nbehalf of the Chinese Government, I wish to \r\ncongratulate you on the successful holding of this \r\nmeeting. \r\n By focusing on the issues facing the least \r\ndeveloped countries (LDCs), we are addressing the \r\nsurvival and development of some 700 million of the \r\npoorest people in the world, and, more importantly, we \r\nare also addressing our common future. Over the past \r\nfive years, progress has been made on carrying out the \r\nProgramme of Action of the Least Developed \r\nCountries for the Decade 2001-2010, thanks to the \r\nconcerted efforts of the international community. \r\n However, there has been no fundamental change \r\nin the situation of the LDCs, and many difficulties still \r\nstand in the way of implementing the Programme of \r\nAction. In this regard, the international community \r\nshould take the following key steps. First, all parties \r\nshould, in the spirit of global partnership, deliver on \r\ntheir commitment under the Programme of Action in \r\ngood faith. The United Nations agencies should also \r\nstrengthen coordination to ensure that such \r\ncommitments are delivered. \r\n Secondly, the developed countries should meet \r\nthe United Nations target of using 0.7 per cent of their \r\ngross national income (GNI) for official development \r\n A/61/PV.8\r\n \r\n17 06-52565 \r\n \r\nassistance as soon as possible and spend 0.15-0.2 per \r\ncent of their GNI to help the LDCs. They should ensure \r\nthe sustainability and predictability of such funding \r\nand continue to expand the scale of grants. The \r\ninternational community should continue to reduce \r\nsubstantially the debt of the LDCs. China shares the \r\nview that new forms of funding should be explored to \r\nincrease funding for the development of the LDCs. \r\n Thirdly, the developed countries should extend \r\ntariff-free and quota-free market access to all goods \r\nfrom the LDCs by 2008. They should reduce non-tariff \r\nbarriers, simplify and make more transparent the rules \r\nof origin and take steps to help the LDCs to increase \r\nexports so that they can be fully integrated into and \r\nbenefit from the multilateral trading regime. \r\n Fourthly, out of respect for the choices made by \r\nLDCs as to their mode of development, the \r\ninternational community should help the LDCs \r\nimprove management in various fields so as to help \r\nthem strengthen their capacity to promote overall \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Until now, China has provided 1,701 instances of \r\nassistance or grants to 49 LDCs, completed 799 \r\nprojects in the LDCs, cancelled 172 debts owed by 36 \r\nLDCs and given tariff-free treatment to curtain exports \r\nfrom LDCs that have diplomatic relations with China. \r\nWe have also actively participated in multilateral debt-\r\nreduction plans. \r\n The five measures announced by the Chinese \r\nPresident, Hu Jintao, at the World Summit last year, \r\nwhich are aimed at supporting and accelerating the \r\ndevelopment of developing countries, will benefit \r\nprimarily the LDCs. China’s assistance is part of \r\nSouth-South cooperation. It is fraternal assistance with \r\nno strings attached, and China seeks no privileges in \r\nproviding such assistance. \r\n In the next few years, China will increase its \r\nassistance to LDCs and HIPC initiative countries. \r\nWithin two years, we will cancel or annul in other \r\nways all the outstanding interest-free and low-interest \r\nGovernment loans that matured at the end of 2004 and \r\nwere borrowed by HIPC initiative countries that have \r\ndiplomatic relations with China. And we will increase \r\nimports from the LDCs, extend tariff-free treatment to \r\nmore of their exports to China and help them train \r\nmore management and technological personnel. At the \r\nforthcoming Summit of the China-Africa Cooperation \r\nForum in November of this year, we will propose new \r\nmeasures designed to help and accelerate the \r\ndevelopment of African countries. \r\n An old Chinese saying states, “The unity of a \r\npeople’s will is as strong as a fortress”. I am confident \r\nthat with the concerted efforts of the international \r\ncommunity, the goals set forth in the Programme of \r\nAction will be achieved, and the LDCs will be able to \r\nembark on the road to prosperity sooner rather than \r\nlater. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Chhay Than, Senior Minister, \r\nMinister of Planning of Cambodia. \r\n Mr. Than (Cambodia): I am honoured and \r\npleased to represent the Kingdom of Cambodia at this \r\nmeeting and to brief you about the situation in \r\nCambodia with regard to the implementation of the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action for the Least Developed \r\nCountries for the Decade 2001-2010. Since the Third \r\nUnited Nations Conference on LDCs in Brussels in \r\n2001, Cambodia has adopted several cross-cutting \r\npriority strategies to build a Cambodian society that is \r\nsocially cohesive, educationally advanced, culturally \r\nvibrant and free from hunger, disease, inequality, \r\nvulnerability and exclusion. \r\n We adopted the National Poverty Reduction \r\nStrategy in 2002 and a set of Millennium Development \r\nGoals for Cambodia in 2003. And last year we \r\nprepared a National Strategic Development Plan, 2006-\r\n2010 (NSDP) synthesizing the programmes envisaged \r\nin the earlier two documents. All the programmes were \r\nformulated with intense and broad participation of all \r\nstakeholders, including in particular civil society \r\nrepresentatives. The NSDP also operationalizes the \r\nRectangular Strategy we adopted in 2004 aimed at \r\npromoting growth, employment, equity and efficiency. \r\nThe NSDP is now the single overarching document to \r\nguide us in our development efforts, which have a clear \r\npro-poor and pro-rural focus in order to rapidly reduce \r\npoverty levels. \r\n Some noteworthy features of our socio-economic \r\ndevelopment process, particularly since late 1998 when \r\nthe country was finally able to achieve internal peace \r\nand political stability, continue to be robust economic \r\ngrowth, improvements in agriculture, which help 80 \r\nper cent of our people living in rural areas, expansion \r\nof infrastructure, including in rural areas, and enlarged \r\nand enhanced provision of social services to help build \r\nand strengthen our much-needed human capital. \r\nA/61/PV.8  \r\n \r\n06-52565 18 \r\n \r\nPoverty in Cambodia has registered a steep decline \r\nfrom 39 per cent in 1993 to 28 per cent in 2004. We are \r\nacutely conscious that there is still so much more to be \r\ndone as envisaged in our NSDP. \r\n Cambodia has put in place a highly participatory \r\nsystem for grass-roots involvement in governance. \r\nWith the commune councils in place following \r\ncommune-level elections in 2002 and decentralization \r\nstarting with a bottom-up, integrated, participatory, \r\ndecentralized rural development scheme, now in \r\noperation for over a decade, Cambodia approved its \r\nStrategic Framework for Decentralization and \r\nDeconcentration in June 2005. The country pursues a \r\nmultipronged attack on corruption and has adopted \r\nbroad-based reforms in all aspects of governance. \r\n Cambodia’s accession to WTO in September \r\n2003 has entailed both the challenges and the benefits \r\nof globalization. Accordingly, Cambodia has put \r\nemphasis on developing several facilitating factors, \r\nsuch as strengthening of domestic enterprises and \r\ninfrastructure, development of human resources and \r\ntechnological capabilities, diversifying the external \r\nsector and creating market access. \r\n Cambodia has taken measures to reinforce \r\ninstitutional support structure for the private sector to \r\nenhance its role in national trade and domestic \r\ninvestment. Policies have been put in place to respond \r\nmore effectively not only to the needs of the productive \r\nsectors through better integration of trade capacity-\r\nbuilding and private sector development activities but \r\nalso to ensure that national poverty reduction goals can \r\nbe pursued with vigour. Our immediate challenge is to \r\nensure that favourable trade agreements with other \r\ncountries and regions can be taken advantage of by the \r\ntrade sector to export diverse Cambodian products. \r\n Cambodia’s priority is to develop human and \r\ninstitutional capacities, remove procedural and \r\ninstitutional bottlenecks hindering the reduction of \r\ntransaction costs, take full advantage of market-access \r\nopportunities, intensify horizontal and vertical \r\ndiversification, especially to boost productivity and \r\nmove up the value chains, promote the competitiveness \r\nof Cambodia’s exports, strengthen subregional/regional \r\ncooperation and facilitate the integration of domestic \r\nenterprises into the international economy. The \r\nBrussels Programme of Action is not only a shared \r\nglobal commitment but also forms an integral \r\ncomponent of our development vision and provides the \r\npillars for national progress towards peace and \r\nprosperity for all Cambodians. \r\n In order to realize these commitments and \r\nsuccessfully implement the Programme of Action, \r\nCambodia seeks continued and enhanced support from \r\nthe international community and our external \r\ndevelopment partners or donor agencies. While \r\nCambodia is taking all measures to promote a more \r\ndomestic resource-driven development process, success \r\nin leveraging the domestic reforms and achieving the \r\nCambodia Millennium Development Goals (CMDGs) \r\nwill heavily depend on greater global support and \r\nresource flows in implementing its pro-poor policies. \r\nSuch support needs to be aligned with Cambodian \r\nnational priorities, as reflected in the NSDP, and \r\nmanaged for results that can be ensured through \r\ndeveloping mutual accountability between the Royal \r\nGovernment of Cambodia and its external development \r\npartners. \r\n Cambodia strongly desires better and more \r\nfavourable access to international markets, especially \r\nin the developed countries. This should include \r\nenhanced market access for its overseas workers as \r\nwell. In this respect, granting of quota-free and duty-\r\nfree schemes for all Cambodian exports will contribute \r\nto increased export earnings and, with deeper backward \r\nlinkages in the country, will make trade work for \r\nCambodia’s development, which is particularly \r\noriented to the poor. \r\n We are confident that we shall be able to achieve \r\nour commitment under the Programme of Action, \r\nprovided that bold initiatives are taken by the \r\ndevelopment partners and the global community to \r\ncomplement pro-poor and pro-CMDG national policies \r\nwith required financial, technical and other support. \r\nThis will help Cambodia to break the poverty cycle and \r\nto achieve such critical goals as developing human \r\nresources, providing food security, removing supply-\r\nside constraints, managing forest and biodiversity and \r\nprotecting the environment. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHer Excellency Mrs. Patrizia Sentinelli, Minister \r\nDelegate for Development Cooperation of Italy. \r\n Mrs. Sentinelli (Italy) (spoke in Italian; English \r\ntext provided by the delegation): It is with real pleasure \r\nthat I am participating in this midterm review in my \r\ncapacity as Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs in charge \r\nof Development Cooperation. \r\n A/61/PV.8\r\n \r\n19 06-52565 \r\n \r\n For me, it is both a great honour and a \r\nresponsibility to represent here the new Government of \r\nItaly, which fully endorses the statement made by \r\nFinland in the name of the European Union. The \r\nGovernment has been in office for only a few months, \r\nfollowing recent elections. The new Government has \r\nindicated its strong interest in development cooperation \r\nby assigning development cooperation to a vice-\r\nminister, recognizing the fundamental role of \r\ndevelopment cooperation in foreign policy. This \r\nappointment was welcomed by all the organizations \r\nthat focus on peace and international solidarity. \r\n The change of pace in Italian development \r\ncooperation policies makes this meeting today \r\nparticularly meaningful and useful for me personally. \r\nFor me, it is an honour and a responsibility to learn \r\nfrom the main stakeholders of this meeting, the least \r\ndeveloped countries, how the more developed countries \r\ncan cooperate with them in the spirit of achieving goals \r\nof common interest and contributing to economic and \r\nsocial growth and poverty reduction. \r\n Development cooperation is a reciprocal \r\nexchange of what each country may have to offer — \r\nwhether it be experience, financial support or human \r\nresources — in order to identify together a way \r\nforward that will involve all countries and is able to \r\nprotect the things we all share. Cooperation should take \r\nplace among equals, and efforts should be made to \r\neliminate the persistent distinction between donor \r\ncountries and beneficiaries by fostering territorial \r\npartnerships. \r\n During this midterm review, we are assessing \r\nprogress in implementation of the Programme of \r\nAction over the past five years and envisioning \r\ncorrective actions for the years to come. In this \r\ncontext, permit me to stress two fundamental points. \r\nFirst, development is a long-lasting process that can be \r\nachieved only if women can participate fully in it and \r\nobstacles to their participation are removed. The \r\ngender dimension should, therefore, be considered in \r\nall our deliberations. Second, we should not forget the \r\nunique contribution of local institutions, NGOs and \r\ncivil society in shaping our cooperation. Governments \r\ncan greatly benefit from the active participation of \r\nlocal partners in the formulation of national economic \r\nand social policies. \r\n The reduction of poverty and the achievement of \r\nfinancial and social prosperity are fundamental to \r\nbuilding lasting peace, which will continue to be a \r\nutopian dream unless the basic conditions for a decent \r\nlife are established: food, housing, education and \r\nhealth for all. We should be able to reconcile politics \r\nand economics and not let the latter prevail over the \r\nformer. Let us treat the midterm review not as a \r\ndeadline to be met but as an opportunity to rethink, if \r\nnecessary, our priorities, goals and beliefs. The \r\nframework for our action should be improved \r\ngovernance to ensure that national and international \r\nefforts to reduce poverty and pave the way to lasting \r\nand balanced development are not hampered by bad \r\npractices. \r\n In Italy, we have traditionally paid special \r\nattention to the least developed countries in allocating \r\ndevelopment assistance. We intend to maintain our \r\ncommitment to our common partnership for \r\ndevelopment, and we are encouraged by the sense of \r\nownership expressed by our partners, the LDCs. We \r\nwill follow this policy in our bilateral and multilateral \r\ncooperation. This forum can provide us with guidance \r\non how to focus better our actions over the next five \r\nyears. \r\n The goals to be achieved were set out in the \r\nseven commitments of the Brussels Programme of \r\nAction. The target of earmarking 0.15-0.20 per cent of \r\nthe gross national income of donor countries for \r\nofficial development assistance to the LDCs was \r\nreiterated at the world summit of 2005. While we may \r\nhave to revise our strategies and some of our priorities, \r\nwe must make a real effort to come closer to these \r\nagreed targets. \r\n From the outset of the sixty-first session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly the countries represented at this \r\nmeeting have had the chance to send a signal of unity \r\nand willingness to work together; a signal that can set \r\nthe tone for the intense work that the General \r\nAssembly has to undertake in the coming days and \r\nmonths. It is my sincere wish that we not waste this \r\nopportunity. I feel confident that most of the countries \r\nhere fully share the same wish. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Mohammed Bedjaoui, Minister of \r\nState, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria. \r\n Mr. Bedjaoui (Algeria) (spoke in French): We \r\ngreatly appreciated the uplifting statement made by \r\nMs. Zuma, Minister for Foreign Affairs of South Africa \r\non behalf of the Group of 77 and China. That \r\nA/61/PV.8  \r\n \r\n06-52565 20 \r\n \r\nstatement, which Algeria fully endorses, is a source of \r\ninspiration for all of us. \r\n Algeria welcomes the attention which the \r\ninternational community is giving to the situation of \r\nthe least developed countries (LDCs) through this in-\r\ndepth midterm review of the Brussels Programme of \r\nAction. This review is a real milestone for achieving \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals, especially for the \r\nreduction of poverty and hunger. \r\n We noted with much interest the conclusions of \r\nthe Secretary-General’s report, which stresses the \r\nrenewal of efforts to implement the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action. This clearly requires our \r\nadhering to our commitments in matters like \r\ndevelopment aid, debt relief, access to markets and \r\ntechnical assistance. \r\n Algeria, which has always actively supported the \r\nefforts of the LDCs in their struggle against poverty \r\nand hunger, especially in Africa, remains convinced of \r\nthe importance of the follow-up mechanisms for \r\nimplementing the Programme of Action. We wish to \r\nexpress our full support for the Cotonou strategy for \r\ncontinued implementation of the Programme of Action, \r\nwhich is the basis for evaluating the progress made so \r\nfar and the constraints that have hindered its \r\nimplementation. \r\n We are concerned by the low rate of \r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action, especially \r\nwith respect to poverty reduction. A world economic \r\nenvironment dominated by a trade-oriented logic to the \r\ndetriment of a development ethic is, without question, \r\nthe primary cause. \r\n It is essential that the international community \r\ndisplay solidarity because of the fragility of the \r\neconomies of the LDCs, which, despite the efforts \r\nundertaken at the national level, remain vulnerable to \r\nthe vicissitudes of the international economy. \r\n In this respect, Algeria welcomes the remarkable \r\nprogress made by most of the LDCs, despite their \r\nlimited resources, to meet the challenges of growth by \r\nimproving their macroeconomic performance, \r\nreinforcing their human and institutional capacities and \r\nendeavouring to participate in the global economy. \r\nTheir progress deserves to be fully supported by the \r\ninternational community through the effective \r\nimplementation of the commitments we took on to \r\nsustain an irreversible development process. \r\n Most of the least developed countries are found \r\nin Africa. The fight against poverty and hunger is a \r\nmajor concern for the entire continent. We believe that \r\nAfrica should have more support from the international \r\ncommunity in view of the unique situation of the least \r\ndeveloped countries, whose economic vulnerability has \r\nbeen exacerbated by the drop in life expectancy caused \r\nby the HIV/AIDS pandemic and by unfortunate \r\nongoing conflicts. \r\n Least developed countries in Africa are \r\nnevertheless making commendable efforts to \r\nimplement economic and political reforms, thereby \r\nclearly demonstrating their adherence to the \r\ncommitments undertaken to promote democracy, \r\nhuman rights and good governance. \r\n Africa is working with its partners through the \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) to \r\nreach the goals of the Programme of Action for the \r\nLDCs, in particular as regards combating poverty. \r\nNEPAD seeks to promote regional integration by \r\nbringing all the countries of the region into the global \r\neconomy. \r\n We are convinced that even more promising \r\nreforms will be undertaken by the least developed \r\ncountries by the final comprehensive review, in 2010, \r\nmaking it possible to launch a process to bring about \r\nwhat we hope will be sustainable development. The \r\ninternational community should not waver in its \r\nsupport to least developed countries. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Abdullah Gül, Deputy Prime \r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey. \r\n Mr. Gül (Turkey): At the outset, I would like to \r\nannounce that Turkey aligns itself with the statement \r\nthat was delivered on behalf of the European Union. \r\n The midterm review of the Brussels Programme \r\nof Action is indeed most timely and helps us take stock \r\nof the progress achieved so far, rechart our course of \r\naction, if need be, and continue down the path we have \r\ntraced with even stronger determination to succeed. In \r\nthat connection, we welcome all the efforts on the part \r\nof the least developed countries (LDCs) and the \r\ncontributions made by their development partners, the \r\nUnited Nations system and other intergovernmental \r\nand non-governmental organizations (NGOs). We are \r\npleased to note that considerable progress has been \r\n A/61/PV.8\r\n \r\n21 06-52565 \r\n \r\nmade since the launch of the Programme in 2001. \r\nHowever, serious challenges and obstacles lie ahead. \r\n We commend the Governments of the LDCs on \r\ntheir efforts to strengthen their policies to develop their \r\nproductive capacities and improve governance and \r\nmacroeconomic performance, as well as on the \r\nachievements they have attained through structural \r\nreforms, trade liberalization and privatization. \r\n It is clear that the Cotonou Strategy will also \r\ncontribute to the further implementation of the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action. \r\n Yet, much more needs to be done. The least \r\ndeveloped countries are seeking, and require, the \r\nassistance and support of the international community \r\nto promote economic growth and sustainable \r\ndevelopment, build human and institutional capacities \r\nand eradicate poverty. \r\n Improving the living conditions of over 600 \r\nmillion people living in 50 LDCs is also our \r\nresponsibility. \r\n After having redressed the damage caused by a \r\nmajor earthquake in 1999 and the impact of the \r\neconomic turbulence of 2001, Turkey is now in a much \r\nbetter position to play the role of a development \r\npartner to LDCs and is determined to play such a role. \r\nWe cannot speak about universal peace, harmony, \r\nstability and cooperation unless we are able to provide \r\nthe means for a decent living for human beings \r\neverywhere. My country is actively supporting, and \r\nparticipating in, international efforts to eradicate \r\npoverty. The official development assistance provided \r\nby Turkey in 2004 amounted to $340 million. That \r\ngrew to over $600 million in 2005, which corresponds \r\nto 0.17 per cent of Turkey’s gross domestic product. \r\nThat does not include private sector contributions. \r\n Our contributions to the various United Nations \r\nfunds and programmes, as well as our voluntary \r\ncontributions to a number of international and regional \r\norganizations that serve least developed countries, \r\nlandlocked developing countries and small island \r\ndeveloping States, will also be sustained and increased, \r\nto the extent possible, in the years to come. \r\n In that context, we are trying to contribute to \r\nactivities aimed at addressing the needs and problems \r\nof the African continent. We have set up local offices \r\nof the Turkish International Cooperation Agency in \r\nAddis Ababa and Khartoum. They serve as \r\ncoordination centres for our development and \r\nhumanitarian assistance to the continent. We will \r\nestablish more local offices in the future. \r\n Turkey has also been recognized by the World \r\nFood Programme as one of the major donors providing \r\nassistance in the food crisis in Africa, reaching out to \r\n17 African countries. \r\n As international trade is vital for the development \r\nof LDCs, Turkey also attaches importance to the \r\ndevelopment of bilateral commercial relations with \r\nthose countries. We are ready to extend assistance and \r\nto cooperate in the fields of agriculture, health, the \r\nenvironment and good governance. \r\n Attracting Turkish investors to LDCs is another \r\nimportant component of our policy. Furthermore, we \r\nare promoting the idea of establishing joint business \r\ncouncils and chambers of commerce. \r\n As an illustration of our keen interest in issues \r\nrelated to LDCs, we are offering to host a major \r\nmeeting on LDCs in Turkey in 2007. We very much \r\nhope that such a meeting will generate further interest \r\nand support for the LDCs, both in Turkey and the \r\nregion. \r\n We have no doubt that LDCs will achieve \r\nsustainable development, sustained economic growth, \r\ngood and efficient governance and a pandemic-free \r\nenvironment, which they deserve. Turkey will continue \r\nto support them in every way it can. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Victor Manuel \r\nBarbosa Borges, Minister for Foreign Affairs, \r\nCooperation and Communities of Cape Verde. \r\n Mr. Barbosa Borges (Cape Verde) (spoke in \r\nPortuguese; English text furnished by the delegation): \r\nAt the outset, allow me to express my satisfaction at \r\nthe holding of this meeting aimed at reviewing the \r\nprogress made in the implementation of the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action for the Least Developed \r\nCountries, which was adopted five years ago. This \r\nevent is justifiable only if we — the least developed \r\ncountries (LDCs) and our development partners — are \r\ncapable of learning from our weaknesses and of \r\ndevising strategies and alternative approaches while \r\nfully assuming our commitments and responsibilities. \r\n Overall, the results that have been achieved are \r\nconsidered to be weak, unstable and unable to reverse \r\nA/61/PV.8  \r\n \r\n06-52565 22 \r\n \r\nthe entrenched dynamics of underdevelopment. The \r\nunequivocal progress that has been achieved does not \r\nmake up for the flaws and failures that pose such \r\ndaunting challenges to both LDCs and the international \r\ncommunity. At present, that assessment leaves us \r\napprehensive and sceptical. \r\n Cape Verde joined the group of least developed \r\ncountries in 1977, two years after its independence. We \r\nhave come a long way during those 30 years. Cape \r\nVerde has achieved the goals and targets established in \r\nthe areas of health and education. The series of reforms \r\ncarried out in the financial sector and the fiscal and \r\npublic administration systems have reinvigorated \r\nforeign direct investment and development. In that \r\ncontext, I would also like to mention the political \r\nreforms that made possible the establishment of a \r\ndemocratic system and the emergence of a cultural and \r\npolitical environment of tolerance and acceptance. \r\n As we are all aware, in December 2004 the \r\nGeneral Assembly decided to graduate Cape Verde \r\nfrom LDC status. In our view, that fact merits special \r\nattention from the United Nations system and the \r\ninternational community as a whole, particularly \r\nbecause Cape Verde is a small island country without \r\nnatural resources and is permanently exposed to \r\ndroughts and external shocks. It should be taken into \r\nconsideration that Cape Verde met two of the criteria \r\nrequired for graduation. However, we are far from \r\nmeeting the third criterion, namely, that pertaining to \r\novercoming economic vulnerability, which is essential \r\nfor sustainable development. \r\n In accordance with the provisions of resolution \r\n59/209, we established a so-called smooth-transition \r\nsupport group comprised of a small number of bilateral \r\nand multilateral partners, with the aim of monitoring \r\nthe transition process and helping with the clarification \r\nof the objectives, scope and elements of the transition. \r\nWe are convinced that, by January 2008 — the time \r\nwhen Cape Verde will exit the group of least developed \r\ncountries — we will have in place a common \r\nframework for dialogue and assistance for the \r\ntransition period, in conformity with the spirit of the \r\nrecent LDC ministerial declaration adopted in \r\nCotonou. \r\n I would like to refer to paragraph 13 of that \r\ndeclaration, in order to share with the Assembly a \r\npessimistic remark made to me in confidence by a \r\nfriend and former colleague of mine from the North, \r\nnamely, that the international establishment is \r\nuncomfortable with the positive dynamics of \r\ndevelopment. I certainly hope that all of us will \r\napproach graduation from a development-focused and \r\nnon-bureaucratic perspective, thereby proving my \r\nformer colleague and friend wrong. \r\n Cape Verde is in dire need of external financial \r\nresources. While we try to attract foreign direct \r\ninvestments, we should bear in mind that, like \r\nremittances from migrants, foreign investment is not a \r\nsubstitute for official development assistance. The \r\nchallenge before us is to find the appropriate balance \r\nso as to achieve greater synergy between the various \r\nmodalities of financing. \r\n With regard to the special case of Cape Verde, \r\ngraduation requires investments in terms of volume, \r\nquality and opportunity, so as to quickly create \r\neconomic momentum and reduce vulnerability. That is \r\nan essential condition for the success of our \r\ngraduation. It should be borne in mind, however, that \r\nprocedures and mechanisms will need to be adapted to \r\nfit the new situation. \r\n Before I conclude, allow me to acknowledge the \r\ncommendable work done by Benin, as coordinator of \r\nthe Group of LDCs, and the Office of the High \r\nRepresentative for the Least Developed Countries, to \r\nplace LDC issues high on the international agenda. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Hassan Wirajuda, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Indonesia. \r\n Mr. Wirajuda (Indonesia): My delegation \r\nassociates itself with the statement delivered on behalf \r\nof the Group of 77 and China on the progress made in \r\nthe implementation of the Programme of Action for the \r\nLeast Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010. \r\nWe believe that the implementation of the Programme \r\ncan be, and should be, made more effective. \r\n To achieve development, least developed \r\ncountries (LDCs) must overcome greater challenges \r\nand meet larger needs than those confronting all other \r\ncountries. Only through meaningful partnership with \r\nthe developed world can we keep those challenges and \r\nneeds from becoming unmanageable and from \r\noverwhelming the LDCs. The importance of such an \r\napproach is evident in the fact that the current session \r\nof the General Assembly has chosen global partnership \r\nfor development as its theme. \r\n A/61/PV.8\r\n \r\n23 06-52565 \r\n \r\n It is true that developed countries have been \r\nincreasing their support to LDCs, in keeping with the \r\nProgramme of Action and their commitments to the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). But they \r\nhave to do more to enable LDCs to achieve truly \r\nsignificant progress. They have to do more for LDCs in \r\nterms of opening up markets, increasing official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) and flows of foreign \r\ndirect investment and improving debt management, \r\nprivate sector development, access to technology and \r\nglobal governance. \r\n It is also true that some LDCs have achieved \r\ngrowth rates of 7 per cent and attained selected MDG \r\ntargets, but those gains can vanish in the face of \r\nspiralling oil prices and severely bad weather. That is \r\nwhat happened in the 1970s and 1980s. Preventive \r\npolicy measures should therefore be taken. \r\n Recent events, however, have not been \r\nencouraging. The collapse of the Doha Round is one \r\nexample of the unfortunate developments that make \r\ndeveloping countries — and LDCs in particular — \r\nmore marginalized as a result of trade liberalization. \r\nLDCs urgently need an international trading system \r\nwith a strong preference programme that will allow \r\nthem duty-free and quota-free access to developed \r\nmarkets. That would give life to the principle of global \r\npartnership. \r\n One way to assist in the national development of \r\nLDCs is through the South-South framework of \r\ncooperation, as it would provide LDCs with more \r\nopportunities to share development experiences and \r\ngood practices with other developing countries. That is \r\nespecially true in the area of capacity building, an \r\naspect of cooperation that should be strengthened \r\nconsiderably in the future, especially as regards trade, \r\ninvestment and the financial sector. In that regard, \r\npractical measures will have to be taken in the form of \r\ntriangular cooperation, where developed countries \r\ncould also contribute effectively to enhancing capacity-\r\nbuilding for LDCs. \r\n For its part, Indonesia has contributed to \r\ncapacity-building through technical cooperation among \r\ndeveloping countries and triangular cooperation \r\ninvolving donor countries and institutions. In \r\nparticular, our efforts have focused on the areas of \r\nmicrofinance, family planning, agriculture and \r\neconomic policy development. We have also sponsored \r\nscholarships for studies in Indonesia for a number \r\nLDCs. Indonesia has also provided technical assistance \r\nto LDCs in Asia and Africa, in the spirit of the New \r\nAsian-African Strategic Partnership, which was \r\nlaunched in Jakarta in April 2005. \r\n Furthermore, we have contributed to the \r\ndevelopment of LDCs through the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement Centre for South-South Technical \r\nCooperation, located in Jakarta. The Centre was \r\nestablished on the initiative of the Governments of \r\nIndonesia and Brunei Darussalam during the eleventh \r\nsummit of the Non-Aligned Movement, which was \r\nheld in Cartagena, Colombia, in 1995. Its objective is \r\nto assist developing countries, including LDCs, to \r\neradicate poverty and promote rapid and sustainable \r\nnational socio-economic growth. The Centre has \r\nendeavoured to collaborate closely with other \r\norganizations, including the United Nations \r\nEnvironment Programme, Japan’s International \r\nCooperation Agency, the Islamic Development Bank \r\nand the Centre on Integrated Rural Development for \r\nAsia and the Pacific. \r\n We remain optimistic about the long-term \r\nprospects of LDCs. The plight of LDCs is improving at \r\nlast, but too slowly. We must accelerate the pace of \r\nrecovery and growth. That means that we, the \r\ndeveloping countries, must once more strive in earnest \r\nwith our developed partners to deliver the most \r\nmeaningful support that can be extended to the LDCs. \r\nThere are still some extreme cases where rescue \r\noperations may have to be undertaken. When that \r\nhappens, let us deem it a matter of moral obligation. \r\n We are all responsible for one another’s fate — \r\nfor the plight of the weakest and poorest among us. We \r\nmust find the political will to help LDCs emerge from \r\ntheir severe predicament. Otherwise we will find out \r\nsoon enough that extreme poverty anywhere \r\nundermines the future of humankind as a whole. \r\nHuman destiny cannot be divided. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency The Honourable George Chaponda, \r\nMP, Minister of Local Government and Rural \r\nDevelopment of Malawi. \r\n Mr. Chaponda (Malawi): My delegation is \r\npleased to take part in the High-level Meeting on the \r\nmidterm comprehensive global review of the \r\nimplementation of the Brussels Programme of Action. \r\nOur appreciation goes to Mr. Chowdhury and the \r\nOffice of the High Representative for the Least \r\nA/61/PV.8  \r\n \r\n06-52565 24 \r\n \r\nDeveloped Countries, Landlocked Developing \r\nCountries and Small Island Developing States, for their \r\nefforts to make this meeting a reality. \r\n Malawi falls within two of the three categories \r\ncovered by the Brussels Programme of Action. It is one \r\nof the least developed countries (LDCs), and it is also \r\nclassified as a landlocked country. \r\n We realize that there has been some progress in \r\nthe implementation of the Programme. For example, \r\nsome countries have registered impressive growth \r\nrates. However, more has to be done to improve the \r\nsituation. \r\n The Brussels Programme of Action sets out an \r\nimportant and unique programme targeting least \r\ndeveloped countries. It is meant to address their special \r\ndevelopment constraints. As we undertake the midterm \r\nreview of this important Programme, we need to take \r\nstock of what has transpired since 2001 — the \r\nproblems and challenges we have experienced — and \r\ncome up with measures to improve the implementation \r\nof the Programme. \r\n Malawi strongly subscribes to the notion that the \r\nprimary responsibility for the development of the least \r\ndeveloped countries rests with the LDCs themselves. \r\nThere can be no alternative to that; however, as the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action is based on shared \r\nresponsibility, our development partners have the \r\nresponsibility to ensure that they fulfil their part of the \r\nbargain. In Malawi, we have taken up the responsibility \r\nof developing our country ourselves. We know what we \r\nwant. We also know what to do. \r\n For that reason, we are proud to inform this body \r\nthat we are one of the few countries to have developed \r\na home-grown, people-centred medium-term \r\ndevelopment strategy that gives priority to agriculture \r\nand food security, infrastructure development, energy \r\ngeneration and supply, irrigation and water \r\ndevelopment, integrated rural development and \r\nHIV/AIDS. We are also happy to have received \r\noverwhelming support for that initiative from our \r\ndevelopment partners, including the recent debt \r\ncancellation. However, we need more support, \r\nespecially in infrastructure development. That should \r\nassist us in constructing the Shire-Zambezi waterway, \r\nwhich will give Malawi easier access to the sea and \r\nwill also help other partners in the region. The ultimate \r\ntest for a people-oriented policy framework is not \r\nnecessarily on the level of consultations in its design, \r\nbut whether the policies are able to improve the lives \r\nof people, society and the economy. \r\n We in Malawi have the confidence to say that we \r\nhave made some notable achievements under the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action. We have put in place \r\nmeasures to enhance good political governance, \r\neconomic governance and socio-economic \r\ndevelopment. It is our desire that we will graduate \r\nfrom this category of countries as soon as possible. \r\n We recognize that the Brussels Programme of \r\nAction constitutes a fundamental framework for a \r\nstrong global partnership to accelerate sustainable \r\neconomic growth and development and poverty \r\neradication in the least developed countries. For that \r\nreason, we have participated actively in the review \r\nprocess and contributed to discussions aimed at \r\nidentifying measures to reinvigorate the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action. \r\n The Cotonou Strategy for the Further \r\nImplementation of the Brussels Programme for the \r\nLeast Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010, \r\nwhich was adopted at a Ministerial Meeting of least \r\ndeveloped countries, constitutes the boost required to \r\nreinvigorate the Brussels Programme of Action. We \r\nview the Cotonou Strategy not as an alternative or \r\nsubstitute for the Brussels Programme of Action, but \r\nrather as a consensus document that injects new life \r\ninto the Brussels Programme of Action. The Cotonou \r\nStrategy makes recommendations on each of the \r\naction-oriented commitments in the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action that will enhance the likelihood \r\nof their being achieved by 2010. \r\n We hope that this comprehensive review will \r\nprovide a significant boost to the international \r\ncommunity’s effort to effectively implement the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action in the remaining four \r\nyears. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Lamin Kaba Bajo, \r\nSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs of the Gambia. \r\n Mr. Bajo (Gambia): The least developed \r\ncountries (LDCs) are the poorest and weakest segment \r\nof the international community. The economic and \r\nsocial development of those countries is an imperative \r\nthat challenges us all. We must rise to meet that \r\nchallenge, because such high levels of poverty — \r\nspread among so large a proportion of humankind — \r\n A/61/PV.8\r\n \r\n25 06-52565 \r\n \r\nare in themselves unsustainable and constitute a threat \r\nto global peace and security. \r\n The development of those countries is hamstrung \r\nby factors such as inadequate human, institutional and \r\nproductive capacity; acute susceptibility to external \r\neconomic shocks and natural and man-made disasters; \r\nlimited access to information and communication, as \r\nwell as to education, health and other social services; \r\nand poor physical infrastructure. \r\n We are all agreed that, if the present development \r\ntrends continue, most of the LDCs, especially those on \r\nthe African continent, will require more than 100 years \r\nto attain the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\nIt is certain that, even with the best efforts in the world, \r\nthose countries will not be able to break the shackles of \r\nextreme poverty without the necessary props from the \r\ninternational community, props that come in the form \r\nof increased official development assistance (ODA) \r\nand foreign direct investment, debt forgiveness, a \r\nfavourable trade regime that eases their access to world \r\nmarkets, and assistance in better managing their \r\nenvironment. \r\n Alas, five years after the adoption of the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action, the expected level of support for \r\nthe LDCs in these and other areas, to which the \r\ninternational community had committed itself, has in \r\nfact not been forthcoming. Nor have the partnership \r\npromises been fulfilled. \r\n The LDCs have done their part in carrying out the \r\nreforms they undertook to make, and in some cases, \r\nthese reforms have translated into higher levels of \r\ngrowth. By and large, however, the growth levels \r\nenvisaged have not been attained, thus further \r\ncompounding the poverty situation in these countries. \r\n Of topmost priority in the Gambia’s development \r\nstrategies is the attainment of the MDGs. We seek to do \r\nthis not only through appropriate interventions in the \r\neconomy, but also through a massive investment \r\nprogramme in the social sector. We have devoted a \r\nlarge proportion of our budget to the health, education \r\nand rural sectors as a strategy for poverty eradication. \r\nThat has produced very positive results, as \r\ndemonstrated in the significant improvements in \r\nperformance indicators such as primary school \r\nenrolment, reduction of infant and maternal mortality, \r\nthe reversal of the spread of HIV/AIDS, gender parity \r\nin education, access to potable water and sanitation, \r\nand arresting environmental degradation. \r\n The Government of the Gambia continues to be \r\nrelentless in its efforts to harness resources for \r\ninvestment in social infrastructure and services in order \r\nto enhance our human and institutional capacities, the \r\nstrengthening of which are major prerequisites for \r\ngrowth and development. What we need now is the \r\nincreased support of our development partners in this \r\nendeavour. \r\n Although the Gambia’s economy has maintained \r\nmacroeconomic stability in these last several years, \r\nmajor challenges in the fight against poverty still \r\nremain. The burden of public debt, debt servicing and a \r\ngrowing domestic debt take away far too many of the \r\nresources we could otherwise channel towards poverty \r\nreduction programmes. Although we have been \r\nincluded in the category of countries that may be \r\nconsidered for debt cancellation under the Highly \r\nIndebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, it has not \r\nbeen easy for us to reach completion points which \r\nwould allow us to benefit effectively from the \r\nprogramme. For many of us in the LDCs, the criteria \r\nare too stringent and, at times, beyond our capacity to \r\nmeet. If the HIPC Initiative is to truly serve the needs \r\nof the poorest of the poor, the conditions for benefiting \r\nfrom it will have to be reviewed. \r\n Last year, we came to the end of our first Poverty \r\nReduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) implementation \r\ncycle. The implementation process has been hindered \r\nby a number of setbacks that has made the overall \r\nPRSP process not as successful as we would have \r\nwished. Capacity constraints were identified as being \r\namong the main factors responsible for this state of \r\naffairs. We are in the process of finalizing our second \r\nPRSP programming cycle, in which we intend to focus \r\non the MDGs. We hope that we shall, this time, \r\ncorrectly anticipate the problems likely to constrain \r\nsuccess and address them in a timely manner. We also \r\nhope that we will be able to count on the international \r\ncommunity to provide substantially more resource \r\nsupport in the second implementation cycle. \r\n Let me end by reiterating the Gambia’s \r\ncommitment to the implementation of the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action, and by calling on all our \r\ndevelopment partners to show greater support for our \r\nefforts. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Fawzi Salloukh, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Lebanon. \r\nA/61/PV.8  \r\n \r\n06-52565 26 \r\n \r\n Mr. Salloukh (Lebanon): We welcome the \r\nholding of a High-Level Meeting on the midterm \r\ncomprehensive global review of the implementation of \r\nthe Programme of Action for the Least Developed \r\nCountries for the Decade 2001-2010. We believe that \r\nthis Meeting should come up with additional ways and \r\nmeans to further promote the implementation of the \r\nProgramme of Action for the Least Developed \r\nCountries in a spirit of solidarity, partnership and \r\ncontinued cooperation. \r\n We support the Brussels Programme of Action for \r\nthe Least Developed Countries and consider it to \r\nrepresent a global commitment towards fostering \r\nsustainable development, sustained economic growth, \r\npoverty eradication and environmental protection in \r\nthe least developed countries. We believe that the \r\nconcerns and development needs of the least developed \r\ncountries should be given due attention and consider \r\nthat the Programme of Action reflects those needs. We \r\nfurther consider that the implementation of the seven \r\ncommitments can be achieved only through \r\ncooperation between the least developed countries and \r\ntheir development partners. We also consider that the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) for the benefit of the LDCs could best be \r\nrealized through the full implementation of the seven \r\ncommitments set out in the Brussels Programme of \r\nAction. \r\n Furthermore, we support the efforts made by the \r\nLDCs in identifying the 31 goals for the further \r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action for the \r\nLeast Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010. \r\nWe consider these goals to be an appropriate road map \r\nfor the achievement of the commitments related to the \r\nProgramme of Action. We call on all concerned parties \r\nand the development partners of the LDCs to support \r\nthe allocation of the means and resources needed for \r\nthe full achievement of those goals. \r\n We consider that the following elements are \r\nessential for the development and economic prosperity \r\nof the LDCs to be assured: a people-centred policy; \r\nsustained economic growth; sustainable development; \r\npoverty reduction; good governance at the national and \r\ninternational levels; the rule of law, respect for all \r\nhuman rights, including the right to development; the \r\npeaceful resolution of armed conflicts; investment in \r\nhealth, education and social infrastructure; the building \r\nof institutional and human capacities; protection of the \r\nenvironment; the building of productive capacities to \r\nallow the LDCs to reap the benefits of globalization; \r\nthe mobilization of financial resources; and the \r\nenhancement of the role of trade in development. To \r\nthat effect, we strongly encourage the facilitation of the \r\naccession of LDCs to the World Trade Organization \r\n(WTO), as we emphasize the need to grant some \r\ndegree of preferential treatment to products of LDCs \r\nby providing duty-free and quota-free access for all \r\nsuch products in the markets of developed countries. \r\n We also consider that debt relief could help boost \r\neconomies of the LDCs and therefore call for bolder \r\ninitiatives towards additional debt relief. We stress the \r\nimportance of official development assistance (ODA) \r\nfor the LDCs’ development and call upon all concerned \r\nparties to strictly observe the targets of 0.15 per cent to \r\n0.2 per cent of gross national product (GNP) dedicated \r\nto ODA for LDCs, as previously agreed in other \r\nforums. \r\n We are deeply concerned by the devastating \r\neffect of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, which is depriving \r\nLDCs of their young working people, thus impacting \r\ntheir economic prospects. We think that the human and \r\nsocial consequences are quite alarming, and therefore \r\nwe call for a concerted global effort to combat this \r\ndisease and other communicable diseases, such as \r\ntuberculosis and malaria. \r\n Finally, we should all work in a spirit of \r\ncooperation and solidarity in order to help the least \r\ndeveloped countries achieve sustainable economic \r\ngrowth. \r\n The Acting President: I give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Alberto Romulo, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Philippines. \r\n Mr. Romulo (Philippines): I should like to begin \r\nby congratulating Ms. Al-Khalifa on her election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly. \r\n My delegation associates itself with the statement \r\nmade by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of South \r\nAfrica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China \r\nregarding the Group’s position on the midterm \r\ncomprehensive global review of the implementation of \r\nthe Brussels Programme of Action for the Least \r\nDeveloped Countries. The outcome of this High-level \r\nMeeting will be awaited with keen interest by the 50 \r\nleast developed countries and their 600 million \r\nconstituents. \r\n A/61/PV.8\r\n \r\n27 06-52565 \r\n \r\n In the race to wealth, no one should be left \r\nbehind. Private businesses may be in a frenzy to \r\noutsmart their rivals in the global marketplace; \r\ndeveloped countries may be pursuing competitiveness \r\nwith passion; and developing countries may be gripped \r\nby the desire to expand their meagre market shares. \r\nBut even in the face of all this, we must never renege \r\non our collective responsibility to guarantee the \r\nrightful place of the least developed countries in global \r\ngrowth. \r\n In the march towards globalization, the interests \r\nof vulnerable least developed countries must not be \r\nignored. Their serious concerns must be given special \r\ncare and attention. They must accompany us on our \r\njourney and on the road to prosperity. \r\n There is reason for hope and optimism. The \r\nreport of the Secretary-General (A/61/173) on the \r\nperformance of the least developed countries during \r\nthe past five years since the adoption of the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action shows that there has been a \r\nnoticeable improvement in the performance of several \r\nof those countries. There has been clear growth in the \r\neconomic and social fields. \r\n That positive development is, however, \r\nattributable to increases in global commodity prices \r\nand to the opening up of a number of export markets in \r\ndeveloped countries. These short-term opportunities \r\nmust be made sustainable if we are to have an impact \r\non the extreme poverty, structural weaknesses and \r\nconstraints in the human and institutional capacities of \r\nthe least developed countries. \r\n To this end, my delegation endorses the strategy \r\nproposed by South Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 \r\nand China for the further implementation of the \r\nProgramme of Action for the Least Developed \r\nCountries. Structural impediments, weaknesses in \r\ngovernance, supply-side constraints and the prevailing \r\nexport-market barriers faced by the least developed \r\ncountries have to be overcome. Only then will those \r\ncountries have the capacity to achieve sustained \r\neconomic growth and development and thereby reap \r\nthe benefits that are the promise of globalization. \r\n Many developing countries have improved their \r\nproductive capacities by addressing those concerns. \r\nThis requires the faithful implementation of carefully \r\ndefined policies in national development strategies or \r\npoverty alleviation plans. However, this admonition is \r\neasier said than complied with, because of the inherent \r\nstructural and institutional limitations of the least \r\ndeveloped countries. \r\n Thus there is a need for strong support and \r\npartnership on the part of both developed and \r\ndeveloping countries. Given their vulnerabilities and \r\nlimited financial resources, the least developed \r\ncountries, if they are to achieve sustained growth, will \r\nrequire strong partnerships, with their neighbours in \r\nparticular. \r\n This is exemplified by our own regional \r\nexperience. When the Association of Southeast Asian \r\nNations (ASEAN) — originally made up of robust \r\neconomies — expanded to include four less developed \r\ncountries, two of which are least developed countries, \r\nwe launched the Initiative for ASEAN Integration, a \r\nstrategy to prevent the widening of the gap in \r\neconomic growth between member countries. \r\n ASEAN’s sense of duty to all its members has \r\nalso been demonstrated in other ways. In complying \r\nwith tariff reductions under the ASEAN Free Trade \r\nArea regime, we applied differentiated time lines. This \r\nallowed members to set up their implementing \r\nlegislative and policy frameworks, enabling their \r\nindustries to adjust to the liberalization process. \r\n The Initiative for ASEAN Integration has been \r\ncomplemented by the more comprehensive Vientiane \r\nPlan of Action. This Plan also takes into account social \r\nand developmental factors, with a view to enabling all \r\nthe peoples of the region to enjoy equal opportunities \r\nfor progress. ASEAN’s regional story shows that we \r\nmust not leave anyone behind in our quest to improve \r\nour economies and our peoples’ standards of living. \r\n As the Chair of ASEAN, the Philippines will \r\ncontinue to ensure that our programmes place every \r\nmember firmly on a common road to growth. Ours is \r\nan experience and a model that we would be happy to \r\nshare. In doing so, we hope to contribute to the \r\nattainment of the Millennium Development Goal of \r\nhalving poverty by 2015. \r\n A poet once said, “Ideologies separate us. Dreams \r\nand anguish bring us together.” Ours is a diverse global \r\nsociety, albeit with gaps and divisions. But our \r\ncommon hopes will remain, as will our collective pain, \r\nuntil, together, we bring poverty to its knees. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I give \r\nthe floor to Her Excellency Ms. Hawa Ahmed \r\nYoussouf, Vice-Minister in charge of the Office of the \r\nA/61/PV.8  \r\n \r\n06-52565 28 \r\n \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and International \r\nCooperation of Djibouti. \r\n Ms. Youssouf (Djibouti) (spoke in French): I \r\nshould like at the outset to congratulate Ms. Al-Khalifa \r\non her election to the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at the sixty-first session. I should also like to \r\ntake this opportunity to pay tribute to all the \r\nrepresentatives gathered here, as well as to the \r\nmembers of the Bureau of the Office of the High \r\nRepresentative for the Least Developed Countries, for \r\nhaving organized this very important meeting. \r\n I associate myself with the statements made by \r\nthe President of Benin and by the Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of South Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 \r\nand China. \r\n It is a great honour and privilege for me to be \r\nhere today for this very important meeting. I would \r\nlike to offer my warmest greetings to everyone here \r\nand to wish all countries every success at this session. \r\n We are gathered here five years after the holding \r\nof the United Nations Conference on the Least \r\nDeveloped Countries to review the progress achieved \r\nduring the past five years and, in particular, to consider \r\nwhat objectives remain to be achieved and how we can \r\nachieve them together. \r\n The least developed countries (LDCs), now free \r\nfrom the ideological divisions and confrontations that \r\ncharacterized the relationship between East and West \r\nduring the cold war, have every reason to welcome the \r\nemergence of a new world order based on \r\ninterdependence and the universality of the values of \r\npolitical and economic liberalism. \r\n However, this interdependence remains uncertain, \r\nbecause our world is now characterized by an \r\neconomic and technological divide between North and \r\nSouth — a gap that, unfortunately, is resisting all \r\nnational and international efforts to close it. \r\n In spite of the enormous efforts that have been \r\nmade in this regard, there is still a marked disparity \r\nbetween the LDCs and other countries. Some 700 \r\nmillion people live in the LDCs, and they remain \r\nhighly vulnerable — indeed, some have even seen their \r\nstandards of living worsen. In brief, the overall picture \r\nis very mixed, and it is now clear that, without a \r\nmarked acceleration of development efforts in the \r\nLDCs, few of the world development goals — \r\nincluding the Millennium Development Goals — will \r\nbe achieved. \r\n Certainly, significant efforts have been made, and \r\nsome progress has been seen in a number of countries. \r\nWhile those are encouraging signs, we are forced to \r\nadmit that we still have a long way to go. It is therefore \r\nonly right that the international community should take \r\nup this urgent challenge, according top priority and \r\nparticular attention to finding ways and means to \r\neliminate poverty and improve the quality of life for \r\nthe residents of the least developed countries by \r\nstrengthening their capacity to build a better future and \r\nto develop their countries. To that end, this High-level \r\nMeeting is of capital importance. The outcomes and \r\nagreements reached here will guide our future action. \r\n By working together, the LDCs and the rest of the \r\ninternational community will be in a position to meet \r\nthese challenges. It is in that spirit that the LDCs met \r\nin Benin in June to prepare a midterm review of the \r\nProgramme of Action, which formed the basis for the \r\nelaboration of the Cotonou Strategy. That Strategy \r\nsimply recalls the commitments undertaken at Brussels \r\nin 2003, what has been accomplished thus far and the \r\nchallenges still to be addressed. \r\n The LDCs cannot make a new start without a \r\nprofound reorientation of international cooperation \r\ntowards development and, in particular, a real North-\r\nSouth partnership. We cannot reiterate often enough \r\nthat the specific needs of LDCs as regards market \r\naccess, official development assistance and debt relief \r\nremain priorities. Maintaining preferential access is \r\nstill an essential way to improve their trade prospects. \r\nUnfortunately, debt relief remains an illusion for many \r\ncountries. \r\n Indeed, while we see progress in providing \r\nofficial development assistance in real terms and some \r\ngood performances in the area of economic growth and \r\nproductivity, much remains to be done. None of the \r\nLDCs appears to be on the way to halving poverty by \r\n2015. Adding to their vulnerability is the HIV/AIDS \r\npandemic, which limits the chances for success in \r\nmany LDCs, particularly because it affects current and \r\nfuture human resources. That in turn limits their \r\ncapacities to generate real economic and social \r\ndevelopment. \r\n There are also the harmful effects of natural \r\ndisasters, climate change and land desertification and \r\ndegradation. For example, the extremely severe \r\n A/61/PV.8\r\n \r\n29 06-52565 \r\n \r\nclimatic conditions of my country, the Republic of \r\nDjibouti, have negative effects on our natural \r\nresources, including a lack of fertile land, water and \r\nsoil salination and the exodus of nomads from rural \r\nareas, which is swelling the ranks of the unemployed in \r\nthe capital. That, of course, is causing a shortfall in \r\nagricultural production, resulting in food insecurity. \r\nThus, my Government has made it an absolute priority \r\nto tackle vulnerable areas, such as food insecurity, \r\nmalnutrition and poverty in general, by, for example, \r\ndeveloping the tourism sector as an income-producing \r\nactivity. \r\n We know that it is possible for us to take action \r\ntogether and to make progress together. We know that, \r\ntogether, we can struggle and succeed in attaining the \r\nprimary objective of the Programme of Action: to make \r\nsubstantial progress in halving by 2015 the number of \r\npeople living in extreme poverty and suffering from \r\nhunger, and to promote the sustainable development of \r\nthe LDCs. We are confident that, through joint and \r\ninnovative action, we can put an end to social \r\ninequality and achieve better social and economic \r\nresults for women and men in these countries. In so \r\ndoing, we shall contribute greatly to the achievement \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals. \r\n Finally, I remain convinced that there is the will \r\nto change. I hope that this Meeting can help to develop \r\nnew opportunities that we can realize together. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Sorajak \r\nKasemsuvan, Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nThailand. \r\n Mr. Kasemsuvan (Thailand): First of all, I would \r\nlike to acknowledge with appreciation the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report on the midterm review of the \r\nimplementation of the Brussels Programme of Action \r\n(A/61/173). This Meeting gives us an opportunity to \r\ndiscuss how the international community can do more \r\nto achieve the global goals of poverty eradication, \r\npeace and development for the least developed \r\ncountries (LDCs) and their peoples, as well as to \r\nintegrate them into the global economy and end their \r\nmarginalization. \r\n My delegation is pleased to learn from the report \r\nthat the overall economic growth of 50 LDCs has risen \r\ntowards the target of 7 per cent set out in the Brussels \r\nProgramme, with substantial progress in human \r\ndevelopment. Nevertheless, we all know that \r\nmalnutrition and extreme poverty are still acute in most \r\nLDCs. Moreover, the economies of these countries — \r\nwhich depend mostly on income from mineral and \r\nprimary commodities — are highly vulnerable to the \r\nfluctuation of world market prices. We agree with the \r\noverall picture presented in the report, which indicates \r\nthat unified actions need to be taken by both the LDCs \r\nand their development partners at all levels and in all \r\naspects for more effective implementation of the \r\nProgramme of Action. \r\n Thailand reaffirms its commitment to join hands \r\nwith partners in both the North and the South to \r\ntranslate the Brussels Programme into concrete actions \r\nso that its targets can be met by the year 2010. We \r\nattach great importance to meeting the special needs of \r\nthe LDCs, especially with regard to achieving human \r\ndevelopment targets, such as reducing extreme poverty \r\nand improving the quality of life. We also support the \r\nrecommendation, made in the report, that official \r\ndevelopment assistance provided by donor countries to \r\nLDCs be allocated more effectively and in sufficient \r\namounts to ensure that all LDCs fulfil the \r\ninternationally agreed development goals, including \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. \r\n In that respect, Thailand has extended technical \r\nassistance and development cooperation to its \r\nneighbouring LDC partners in the fields of its \r\nexpertise. Thailand, as a middle-income developing \r\ncountry, provided official development assistance \r\namounting to 0.13 per cent of its gross national income \r\nto other developing countries and LDCs in 2003. Of \r\nthat amount, about 93 per cent — or 0.12 per cent of \r\nour gross national income — went to LDCs, mainly \r\nour neighbours. That level of assistance is a substantive \r\ncontribution in light of Thailand’s own economic \r\ndevelopment level. \r\n Thailand has played an active role in promoting \r\nregional cooperation and integration, which are vital \r\nfor the economies of the LDCs in the region. Thailand \r\nis an important partner in a number of regional and \r\nsubregional development cooperation frameworks, \r\nsuch as the Ayeyawady-Chao Phraya-Mekong \r\nEconomic Cooperation Strategy and the Greater \r\nMekong Subregion cooperation framework, which are \r\naimed at alleviating economic disparities among \r\ncountries in the region through trade and investment \r\nfacilitation, the improvement of physical infrastructure \r\nand social programmes. \r\nA/61/PV.8  \r\n \r\n06-52565 30 \r\n \r\n We also place emphasis on extending assistance \r\nto LDCs in other parts of the world. We believe that a \r\nstrong foundation in human resources and satisfied \r\nlabour, free from hunger and disease, is the basis for \r\nstable economies. Therefore, Thailand has pursued \r\ntechnical cooperation with our friends in Africa, \r\ndrawing on our own experiences and best practices, \r\nespecially in the areas of agriculture and rural \r\ndevelopment, education and health care, including \r\nHIV/AIDS prevention and care. We also believe that \r\nlong-term investment and short-term, immediate help \r\nmust go hand in hand so that we can quickly address \r\nthe scale and depth of poverty and hunger. \r\n We are pleased to learn from the report of the \r\nSecretary-General that developed countries have made \r\npositive progress in accommodating the LDCs in the \r\narea of international trade. The initiative of the Group \r\nof Seven to increase funding for the Aid for Trade \r\nInitiative is a welcome contribution, since it would \r\nhelp the LDCs to reap greater benefits from the world \r\ntrading system and to increase their capacity to \r\ndiversify and move up the value-added ladder over the \r\nlong term. \r\n Finally, I would like to reaffirm that Thailand \r\nstands ready to cooperate with the LDCs, developing \r\ncountries, international organizations and other \r\ndevelopment partners in any way possible, including in \r\nthe exchange of knowledge, experiences and lessons \r\nlearnt in reducing poverty and in advancing economic \r\nand social development at all levels. We also reaffirm \r\nour strong commitment to contribute to the global \r\npartnership for the successful implementation of the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the floor to Her Excellency Ms. Leire Pajín, \r\nSecretary of State for International Cooperation of \r\nSpain. \r\n Ms. Pajín (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): The \r\npurpose of being here today is to reaffirm Spain’s full \r\ncommitment to support the efforts of the least \r\ndeveloped countries to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and move along the path towards \r\nsustainable growth. This firm commitment is backed \r\nup by several justifications. \r\n Mr. Sow (Guinea), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n First of all, Spain is committed to helping the \r\nleast developed countries because the very basis and \r\nultimate objective of Spain’s development cooperation \r\npolicy is to contribute to eradicating poverty, and it is \r\nin this group of countries where we find the most \r\ncritical needs and where there is a greater challenge \r\nwhen it comes to achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. \r\n Secondly, because the LDCs in their efforts to \r\nachieve those goals face special difficulties, which \r\nstem from their meagre and fragile economic, \r\ninstitutional and human resources, their geographical \r\nlocation and their vulnerability to exterior changes. All \r\nof this leads to major obstacles when it comes to \r\ndeveloping their national economies and ensuring a \r\nminimum standard of living for their population. \r\n Finally, we firmly believe that we all have an \r\nethical, moral and political obligation to support the \r\nefforts that many countries are making in order to \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals. In order \r\nto achieve this objective the developed and the \r\ndeveloping countries have to work together, assuming \r\ncommitments and responsibilities within the \r\nframework of a true international development \r\npartnership. This partnership must make it possible to \r\nfulfil the Brussels Programme of Action, which is the \r\nframework of reference and the strategy that will make \r\nit possible for the least developed countries to achieve \r\nfully the Millennium Development Goals within the \r\nperiod we have established. To do so, Spain firmly \r\nsupports this Programme of Action in all its areas of \r\nactivity. \r\n The seven areas of activities are crucial when it \r\ncomes to moving forward along the path to \r\ndevelopment and delineate the partnership between \r\ndeveloping and developed countries aimed at achieving \r\nthe MDGs. Compliance with the Brussels Programme \r\nof Action is a road map that shows the way in which \r\nthe least developed countries can achieve the goal of \r\nsustainable development. \r\n It is clearly evident that LDCs have to assume \r\ntheir own commitments when it comes to \r\nimplementing national poverty reduction strategies \r\nwith policies focused on human development, good \r\ngovernance and institution-building as well as \r\nstimulating production. But it is also true that we, the \r\ndeveloped countries, must assume our commitments \r\nand support the efforts of the LDCs in these areas, \r\nachieving greater mobilization of financial resources \r\nwithout forgetting the importance of maintaining the \r\n A/61/PV.8\r\n \r\n31 06-52565 \r\n \r\nconsistency needed among all the policies affecting the \r\npossibilities of many countries to develop. The search \r\nfor consistency should force us to work to support the \r\ndeveloping countries, especially the LDCs, in \r\nimportant areas such as trade, debt, migration, \r\ndevelopment, peace and security. \r\n Spain has assumed its share of responsibility. We \r\nare significantly increasing our assistance and we are \r\nseeking to increase its quality and efficiency as much \r\nas possible. Specifically in the area of greater \r\nmobilization of Spanish resources, Spanish cooperation \r\nis making an effort to increase significantly the \r\nassistance given to sub-Saharan Africa, where there are \r\na large number of least developed countries, while \r\nmaintaining our commitment as well to other countries \r\nand other regions, for example Haiti in Latin America. \r\n In 2006, Spain will provide three times as much \r\nassistance to this area as we did in 2003. Likewise, \r\nSpain will channel a large part of its support to the \r\nLDCs through initiatives such as the New Partnership \r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD) under the African \r\nUnion, which will make it possible to consolidate the \r\nprinciple of ownership by developing countries, as well \r\nas participation in global funds and programmes that \r\nare committed to the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nThese multilateral initiatives complement Spain’s \r\nefforts at the bilateral level in support of the LDCs in \r\nsensitive areas such as health, literacy, primary \r\neducation, gender equality, water and environmental \r\nsustainability. \r\n Furthermore, we must assist LDCs to avoid a \r\nsituation where excessive external debt might seriously \r\ncompromise every possibility of achieving sustainable \r\neconomic growth. In this respect, Spain, apart from its \r\ncommitment to the HIPC Initiative, has begun to \r\npromote initiatives to convert or exchange debt for \r\ncooperation programmes that free resources to finance \r\nparticularly sensitive areas such as primarily education. \r\nFor example, agreement to exchange debt with LDCs \r\nsuch as Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \r\nGuinea-Bissau and Somalia, agreements that will be \r\nexpanded in the future. \r\n Likewise, there is an obligation to commit to a \r\nfirm and determined struggle to eradicate disease that \r\nno longer exist in the developed world or that exist \r\nthere at a lower level but have a particular impact on \r\nthe LDCs. This is unavoidable if we want to promote \r\neconomic growth and development. In this respect, \r\nSpain will continue to support firmly the Global Fund \r\nto Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and will \r\nparticipate in the International Finance Facility for \r\nImmunization, which was established in the framework \r\nof the International Finance Facility proposal. \r\n The International Finance Facility for \r\nImmunization will finance vaccination projects in the \r\nLDCs that are linked to diseases with high indices of \r\ninfant mortality. In the field of education, Spain also \r\ncontributes to the Education for All Fast-track \r\nInitiative, the objective of which is to enrol 100 million \r\nchildren who are not attending school at this moment \r\nin countries with high levels of poverty. \r\n Although there has been progress, there is still \r\nmuch left to be done in order to comply with the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action so that its goals will be \r\na reality for the LDCs. Spain is convinced that in order \r\nto achieve this goal, the LDCs are not the only ones to \r\nassume their crucial responsibility to implement \r\ndevelopment strategies and fight poverty, but also \r\ndeveloped countries and international organizations as \r\nwell have to devote our efforts to these countries. The \r\nLDCs face major challenges and obstacles on the road \r\nto development, but the challenges are not simply \r\ntheirs alone. We have to see to their special needs and \r\nfirmly support their efforts in strengthening their \r\ncapacities in order to achieve the goals of eradicating \r\npoverty and improving the quality of life of their \r\ncitizens. \r\n The Brussels Programme of Action for the \r\nDecade 2001-2010 must be the framework and the \r\ninstrument that will make it possible, under the \r\ninitiative and leadership of the LDCs, to accelerate \r\nprogress in order to move clearly and effectively along \r\nthe path to development and to meet the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals fully and in a timely manner. \r\nSpain, in association with other countries, has to \r\ndevote its efforts to this, and that is why we will \r\ncontinue our commitment, not only in words, but in \r\nactions as well. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Todor Tchurov, \r\nVice-Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bulgaria. \r\n Mr. Tchurov (Bulgaria): I wish to join other \r\nspeakers in congratulating the President and in \r\nextending our wishes to her for success and in \r\nexpressing our readiness to support her in her noble \r\nmission. \r\nA/61/PV.8  \r\n \r\n06-52565 32 \r\n \r\n Let me also stress that we fully associate \r\nourselves with the statement made by the Finnish \r\nPresidency of the European Union. \r\n One year ago here in New York, world leaders \r\nreaffirmed their determination to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015 and \r\nreiterated their commitment to address the special \r\nneeds of the least developed countries (LDCs), \r\nparticularly through the implementation of the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action for the Least Developed \r\nCountries for the Decade 2001-2010. The Brussels \r\nProgramme proves to be a valuable tool for the \r\nachievement of the MDGs in key areas such as the \r\neradication of poverty, the reduction of infant and child \r\nmortality, primary education and access to safe water, \r\namong other things. \r\n We consider the midterm review of the Brussels \r\nProgramme timely and useful in order to take stock of \r\nits achievements, identify gaps and suggest realistic \r\nsolutions. We hope that this High-level Meeting will \r\ndeepen the partnership between the LDCs and their \r\ndevelopment partners and will assist further progress in \r\nthe implementation of the commitments made in the \r\nBrussels Programme. \r\n My country commends the Secretary-General for \r\nhis report on the implementation of the Programme of \r\nAction during its first five years (A/61/173). It contains \r\nsubstantial conclusions and results-oriented \r\nrecommendations. LDCs and their development \r\npartners have both made progress in implementing \r\ntheir commitments. We welcome the fact that economic \r\ngrowth in a number of LDCs has risen towards the \r\ntarget level of 7 per cent and look forward to further \r\nsustainable macroeconomic and financial stabilization. \r\nStill, much more remains to be done by all of us, since \r\nlife has shown that the MDGs are achievable only \r\nthrough concerted effort. \r\n Bulgaria is strongly committed to the \r\nimplementation of the Brussels Programme of Action \r\nas part of a broader commitment to the global \r\ndevelopment agenda, both within the United Nations \r\nand the European Union. In its capacity as an acceding \r\ncountry to the EU, Bulgaria has subscribed to the \r\nEuropean Consensus on Development, which includes \r\ntargets for increasing the volume of official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA). We are firmly \r\nconvinced, however, that besides the volume of aid, \r\nsuccess in development also depends on the quality and \r\neffectiveness of development assistance. \r\n Assuming the obligation of a member of the \r\nEuropean Union, Bulgaria is in the process of building \r\na national capacity for providing development \r\nassistance. This process opens a window of opportunity \r\nfor new partnerships with developing countries, \r\nincluding the LDCs, on both a multilateral and bilateral \r\nbasis. \r\n I would like to share several points stemming \r\nfrom Bulgaria’s experience in transitioning from a \r\ncentralized economy to a market economy that I \r\nconsider relevant to this discussion. \r\n First, in our country and the surrounding region, \r\nsound financial and macroeconomic policies have \r\nproven to be an effective working tool for achieving \r\nlong-term financial stability and for opening the way to \r\nsustained economic growth. \r\n Second, the example of South-Eastern Europe has \r\nclearly shown that active regional and bilateral \r\ntransborder cooperation aimed at modernized transport, \r\ntelecommunications and energy infrastructure provides \r\na strong incentive for development. This is why we \r\nbelieve that South-South cooperation can be really \r\neffective in achieving the LDCs’ development goals. \r\n Third, there is a direct link between security, \r\nconflict prevention and development. A stable, \r\npredictable and conflict-free environment acts as a \r\nmagnet for trade and foreign direct investment, which \r\ncontribute to job creation, promote economic growth \r\nand thus assist in raising the standard of living. \r\nConsequently, we would like to emphasize the call in \r\nthe Brussels Programme of Action for national policies \r\nand strategies to promote conflict prevention, peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes, reconciliation and post-war \r\npeacebuilding. \r\n Last but not least, good governance, the \r\npromotion of democracy, the rule of law and the \r\nprotection of human rights are identified by the \r\ninternational community as critical factors in reaching \r\nthe MDGs. Bulgaria’s experience has proven the \r\ncrucial importance of implementing these principles. \r\nWe encourage their further integration into national \r\nimplementation strategies. \r\n My country’s successful economic performance \r\nand acquired experience, along with our goal to \r\nbecome a donor of development assistance, have \r\n A/61/PV.8\r\n \r\n33 06-52565 \r\n \r\nmotivated us to put forward our candidature to the \r\nEconomic and Social Council for the period 2007-\r\n2009. We are committed to contributing to the work of \r\nthe Council, building on our experience in carrying out \r\nfundamental fiscal, economic and political reforms. \r\nThis specific experience can be a valuable asset for \r\ntranslating our solidarity with developing countries \r\ninto concrete action. We hope that we can count on the \r\nsupport of the Member States in this quest to contribute \r\nto the work of the United Nations in the economic and \r\nsocial fields. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency The Honourable \r\nMr. Semakula Kiwanuka, Minister of State for \r\nInvestment in the Ministry of Finance of Uganda. \r\n Mr. Kiwanuka (Uganda): Allow me to add my \r\ncongratulations to those of the other delegates who \r\nhave spoken before me in congratulating the President \r\non her election as President of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-first session. \r\n I wish to begin by noting the significance of the \r\nopportunity to voice concerns pertaining to the \r\nconsolidation of development gains by least developed \r\ncountries (LDCs) featured on the agenda of the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n The findings of the midterm review of the \r\nimplementation of the Brussels Programme of Action \r\npresent us with a mixed picture. On one hand, this \r\npicture gives us — the representatives of LDCs and our \r\ndevelopment partners present here — reason to \r\ncelebrate and congratulate ourselves. On the other \r\nhand, it points to the grave responsibilities by which \r\nthis and subsequent generations will judge us. \r\n Uganda shares the tangible results shown in the \r\nfindings of the midterm review. The overall growth in \r\nthe gross domestic product (GDP) of Uganda averaged \r\nover 5 per cent per annum during the review period. \r\nThe rate of GDP growth per capita has, however, been \r\nslower because of our high population growth rate, \r\ncurrently estimated at 3.4 per cent per annum. Among \r\nother things, this has resulted in a widening inequality \r\ngap among our people. \r\n Cognizant of the fact that economic growth must \r\ntranslate into poverty reduction, we have continued to \r\nprioritize poverty reduction within the context of our \r\nnational planning framework: the Poverty Eradication \r\nAction Plan, known as PEAP. We have done this by \r\nempowering stakeholders to own the priority actions of \r\nthe plan. \r\n As part of the process of putting in place people-\r\ncentred public expenditure, Uganda has continued to \r\nensure that the national budget and planning processes \r\nare open to all stakeholders. The preparation of the \r\ncurrent, third generation of the Poverty Eradication \r\nAction Plan is an example of that commitment. Other \r\nundertakings to that effect have included the \r\npublication of financial releases to local government, \r\nthe institutionalization of monitoring and reporting on \r\nthe utilization of budget resources under the poverty \r\naction fund and, more recently, the adoption and roll-\r\nout of an integrated financial management system. \r\n With respect to good governance, I am pleased to \r\ninform the Assembly that Uganda is furthering the \r\nreforms it embarked on prior to the adoption of the \r\ncurrent Programme of Action for LDCs. We have \r\ncontinued to deepen our decentralization strategy. The \r\nlatest undertaking in that regard was the \r\nimplementation of the fiscal decentralization strategy. \r\nUganda also recently held its first presidential and \r\nparliamentary election under a multi-party system. I \r\nam also pleased to report that, according to a new \r\nWorld Bank report released in Singapore, on \r\n15 September, Uganda was ranked among the high \r\nperformers in fighting corruption in the public sector. \r\nThe report — entitled “Governance matters, 2006: \r\nworldwide governance indicators” — also positioned \r\nUganda among the best performers in the promotion of \r\nfree speech and democracy in Africa. \r\n In recognition of the need to match Uganda’s \r\nhuman resource development strategy and the human \r\nresource requirements of its economy, Uganda has \r\nstepped up the profile of vocational training. It has also \r\nadopted free universal secondary education to absorb \r\nthe swelling number of graduates from its decades-old \r\nfree universal primary education programme. Those \r\nundertakings are in addition to its adult literacy and \r\nuniversal primary health-care programmes. \r\n In order for us to successfully build on the gains \r\nnoted in the midterm review, we must tackle the issue \r\nof effective partnerships with our development \r\npartners. True partnership must preserve the dignity of \r\nthe parties involved. That can happen only when we \r\nhave a mutual stake in our partnerships. Therefore, \r\nwhile we celebrate the midterm review finding that \r\nofficial development assistance (ODA) to LDCs is on \r\nA/61/PV.8  \r\n \r\n06-52565 34 \r\n \r\nthe rise, our higher aim should be to see ODA become \r\nhistory as it is replaced by growing flows of foreign \r\ndirect investment within developing countries, \r\nincluding from our development partners. \r\n That is why the recommendations of the Cotonou \r\nStrategy for the Further Implementation of the \r\nProgramme of Action for LDCs must not be watered \r\ndown. Regional infrastructure, appropriate \r\ntechnologies and economic diversification are the \r\nbuilding blocks to which our development partners \r\nmust direct an increasing proportion of the rising levels \r\nof ODA. \r\n It is true that human capital is important. \r\nHowever, human capital without employment \r\nopportunities is a recipe for social anarchy and unrest. \r\nIt is also contrary to the first commitment of the \r\nProgramme of Action, namely, fostering a people-\r\ncentred policy framework. \r\n Lastly, the midterm review has rightly observed \r\nthat international support in post-conflict situations has \r\nnot always corresponded to the long-term nature of the \r\npeacebuilding process. Conflict in LDCs is not only a \r\ndeterrent to the further implementation of the \r\nProgramme of Action for LDCs, it is also a major \r\nsource of erosion of the progress individual LDCs have \r\nattained. In that regard, the regional peacebuilding \r\nefforts of LDCs, specifically those within sub-Saharan \r\nAfrica, must receive the full weight and backing of the \r\nUnited Nations system. The current efforts of the \r\nUnited Nations system by way of support to refugees \r\nand peacekeeping efforts are highly appreciated. \r\nHowever, those efforts must progressively evolve away \r\nfrom managing conflict to preventing conflict and \r\ndisasters, with the Governments of LDCs providing \r\nleadership. \r\n Concerted investment is required in support of \r\nexisting and emerging conflict- and other disaster-\r\nprevention initiatives and mechanisms by the \r\nGovernments of LDCs. Furthermore, with the \r\nenvironmental effects of global warming transcending \r\ngeographical boundaries at the current rate, hunger, \r\nmalnutrition and poverty due to drought, desertification \r\nand floods are challenges that will require putting in \r\nplace increasingly well-coordinated mitigation \r\nmechanisms. For that reason, the efforts of LDC \r\nGovernments to transform household livelihoods in \r\nrural areas away from subsistence to off-farm \r\nlivelihoods must receive more attention from \r\nmultilateral development agencies and development \r\npartners. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Ishrat Hussain, \r\nChairman of the National Commission for Government \r\nReforms of Pakistan. \r\n Mr. Hussain (Pakistan): It is my pleasure and \r\ngreat privilege to represent Pakistan at this important \r\nHigh-level plenary Meeting convened to undertake the \r\nmidterm review of the implementation of the \r\nProgramme of Action for the Least Developed \r\nCountries for the Decade 2001-2010. \r\n Pakistan wishes to align itself with the statement \r\nmade by the Minister of South Africa on behalf of the \r\nGroup of 77 and China. \r\n The Programme of Action for the Least \r\nDeveloped Countries (LDCs) constitutes the \r\noverarching framework designed primarily to address \r\nthe special needs of LDCs through enhanced \r\ncooperation between those countries and developed \r\ncountries. Most important, it is premised on a \r\npartnership approach and has so far proven critical in \r\nsensitizing the international community about the \r\nformidable economic and development challenges \r\nfaced by LDCs. The optimism and euphoria that \r\naccompanied the adoption of the Programme of Action \r\ndoes not, unfortunately, match the actual results \r\nachieved so far. \r\n The Strategy for the Further Implementation of \r\nthe LDC Programme of Action, adopted recently in \r\nCotonou, Benin, while noting some of the positive \r\nstrides made by LDCs in the area of economic growth \r\nand improved governance, also presents a rather bleak \r\npicture of the continuing, and in some cases growing, \r\nincidence of poverty and the lack of capacity and \r\navailability of adequate resources. Clearly, there is now \r\nuniversal recognition that, if the present trends \r\ncontinue, most LDCs are less likely to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, particularly that of \r\nreducing poverty by half by 2015. \r\n Significantly, the Cotonou Strategy, in keeping \r\nwith the Programme of Action, places special emphasis \r\non implementation and contains time-bound and \r\nmeasurable goals and targets. We welcome and fully \r\nsupport that implementation focus and orientation of \r\nthe Cotonou Strategy. It is in line with the approach \r\nthat Pakistan has been strongly advocating in the \r\n A/61/PV.8\r\n \r\n35 06-52565 \r\n \r\ncontext not only of North-South but also of South-\r\nSouth cooperation for the development of a results-\r\nbased matrix to monitor the implementation of agreed \r\ndevelopment goals and commitments. \r\n We remain convinced that, in addition to \r\nmustering the requisite political will, this will be the \r\nbest way to effectively address the “implementation \r\nparalysis” in international development cooperation. \r\n Achieving the goals and objectives of the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action within the expected \r\ntime frame will require an improvement in the \r\neconomic and social development indicators of the \r\nLDCs and the creation of an international climate \r\nsupportive of their development so that they can break \r\nthe vicious circle of poverty, hunger and \r\nunderdevelopment. This would require concerted \r\nefforts on the part of all relevant stakeholders, \r\nparticularly in the following areas. \r\n First, there must be good governance and the \r\nright policies at the national as well as the international \r\nlevel. Such an approach would help to establish an \r\nenabling economic environment, which would support \r\nthe domestic policy framework. Secondly, the \r\navailability, in terms of quantity and quality, of the \r\nfinancial resources required by the LDCs through \r\ngreater debt relief and debt cancellation, enhanced \r\nofficial development assistance and investment flows \r\nmust be ensured. Thirdly, market access for products of \r\nexport interest to LDCs must be improved. The recent \r\ndecision on market access for LDCs adopted at the \r\nWorld Trade Organization Hong Kong ministerial \r\nmeeting must be implemented expeditiously. Fourthly, \r\naccess to technology, greater technical cooperation and \r\ncapacity-building must be facilitated. \r\n Despite limited resources and domestic financial \r\nconstraints, Pakistan has continued to provide \r\ntechnical, economic and humanitarian assistance to the \r\nLDCs on select products. Under the Pakistan Technical \r\nAssistance Programme and Special Technical \r\nAssistance Programme for Africa, a large number of \r\nparticipants from the LDCs have so far benefited from \r\nour training programmes in the fields of banking, \r\ndiplomacy, language skills, railways and accounting. \r\n The Government of Pakistan has also been \r\nextending trade credits, including duty-free market \r\naccess, to a few LDCs on select products under \r\narrangements established by the South Asian \r\nAssociation for Regional Cooperation, as well as \r\nproviding substantial humanitarian assistance to some \r\nLDCs. We will continue with our modest efforts in the \r\nfuture. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I give \r\nthe floor to His Excellency Mr. Ibrahim Sesay, Vice-\r\nMinister of Development and Economic Planning of \r\nSierra Leone. \r\n Mr. Sesay (Sierra Leone): My delegation fully \r\naligns itself with the statements made by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Boni Yayi, President of the Republic of \r\nBenin, on behalf of the least developed countries \r\n(LDCs) and by the Foreign Minister of South Africa on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China. \r\n I would like to thank the United Nations system \r\nfor its efforts to achieve progress during the past five \r\nyears in the implementation of the Brussels Programme \r\nof Action for the Least Developed Countries for the \r\nDecade 2001-2010 and, in particular, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his informative report on the issue. \r\n Furthermore, we appreciate the work of \r\nAmbassador Anwarul Chowdhury, Under-Secretary-\r\nGeneral and High Representative for the Least \r\nDeveloped Countries, Landlocked Developing \r\nCountries and Small Island Developing States, for the \r\ntremendous efforts that he and his team have made in \r\nensuring the success of the midterm review of the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action. \r\n Sierra Leone was at war when the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action was signed in May 2001. \r\nHowever, through the concerted efforts of the \r\ninternational community, notably the United Nations \r\nsystem, the war formally ended in January 2002. Since \r\nthen, considerable progress has been achieved in the \r\narea of peacebuilding and development as a result of \r\nseveral initiatives. These have been clearly outlined in \r\nour annual reports on the implementation of the \r\nProgramme of Action. \r\n We cannot but acknowledge that countries that \r\nhave experienced conflict face enormous challenges \r\nthat must be overcome if the internationally agreed \r\ndevelopment goals are to be achieved in a timely \r\nfashion. We have developed and begun implementing \r\nbold policies and programmes that have reasonably \r\npositioned us to achieve the goals and targets enshrined \r\nin the Brussels Programme of Action. \r\n Taking our limitations into consideration, we \r\nhave identified and embarked upon the implementation \r\nA/61/PV.8  \r\n \r\n06-52565 36 \r\n \r\nof urgent priority areas within our Poverty Reduction \r\nStrategy Paper (PRSP) to meet these crucial goals. We \r\nhave created the required policy environment and put \r\nin place strategies and policy measures to break with \r\nthe past and put an end to business as usual. Notable \r\namong these are ongoing judicial reforms, \r\nimprovements in public financial management, \r\ndecentralization, effective local governance, the \r\npromulgation of an anti-corruption Act, the setting up \r\nof a commission to stem corruption and the \r\nrepositioning of the Republic of Sierra Leone police \r\nand armed forces to better maintain peace and security \r\nfollowing the withdrawal of the United Nations \r\nMission in Sierra Leone. \r\n The Government of Sierra Leone has a mineral \r\npolicy that incorporates the Kimberley Diamond \r\nCertification Scheme, and it has agreed to sign up to \r\nthe Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. \r\nRecently, the Government of Sierra Leone and our \r\nbudget-support donors jointly signed the Improved \r\nGovernance and Accountability Pact for Poverty \r\nReduction and Sustainable Development. We are now \r\nin the second year of implementing the PRSP. The \r\ndismal statistics relating to school enrolment rates and \r\nhealth indicators that characterized the war period are \r\ngradually improving. \r\n Despite these improvements, challenges abound \r\nin so far as the implementation of the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action is concerned. Poverty is \r\nendemic, infrastructure inadequate and the capacity of \r\ncivil society weak. The proportion of the population \r\nliving below the poverty line is staggering. There is \r\nhigh unemployment, especially among young people. \r\n As recognized in this year’s country report of the \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development, \r\nthe lack of productive capacity in the LDCs is affecting \r\nthe achievement of the objectives of the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action. \r\n Developing productive capacities is necessary for \r\npoverty reduction and for securing the economic base \r\nfor good governance. As the Secretary-General noted \r\nin his report, although a number of LDCs have attained \r\nhigher rates of economic growth than in the past, there \r\nis still widespread poverty, which means that the \r\ngrowth rates recorded have not been translated into \r\neffective poverty reduction or improved human well-\r\nbeing. The major focus in the next five years should \r\ntherefore be on translating the positive growth rates \r\nrecorded in the LDCs into poverty reduction and \r\nsustained economic growth in those countries. \r\n The achievement of the Brussels Programme of \r\nAction is a mutual responsibility, and the support of \r\nour partners remains crucial for the achievement of our \r\nshared goals. Such support for development assistance \r\nshould include debt cancellation, capacity development \r\nfor effective trade, good governance and an enabling \r\nenvironment for investment, particularly in \r\ninfrastructure. \r\n Notwithstanding the many challenges facing \r\nLDCs, there is a sound basis for progress. Actions by \r\nthe LDCs in harnessing domestic resources, coupled \r\nwith the scaling up of support by the international \r\ncommunity, will prove crucial in the next five years. It \r\nis in this light, therefore, that we call on our \r\ndevelopment partners to support the recommendations \r\nof the Cotonou Strategy, which we see as reinforcing \r\nand furthering the implementation of the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I give \r\nthe floor to His Excellency Mr. Renaldo Bolívar, \r\nDeputy Minister for Africa of the Bolivarian Republic \r\nof Venezuela. \r\n Mr. Bolívar (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) \r\n(spoke in Spanish): The delegation of the Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela would like to congratulate Her \r\nExcellency Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa on her \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-first session, and for convening this important \r\nmeeting on the least developed countries (LDCs). \r\n For some decades now, the development debate \r\nhas become an increasingly problematic issue for \r\ninternational economic relations. In the early years of \r\nthe twenty-first century, the States members of the \r\nUnited Nations and of the World Trade Organization \r\n(WTO) adopted the Millennium Declaration, the \r\nMonterrey Consensus and the Doha Declaration on \r\ntrade, in which they agreed on international strategies \r\nprimarily aimed at addressing the needs of developing \r\ncountries. Those agreements were achieved through \r\ncomplex negotiating processes, which were frequently \r\nmarked by pressures and impositions from developed \r\ncountries. \r\n Today, when assessing the results achieved after \r\nsuch a long process, we note that many of the goals we \r\nset will not be achieved by most of the developing \r\n A/61/PV.8\r\n \r\n37 06-52565 \r\n \r\ncountries, including in particular the least developed \r\ncountries. While there has been some progress in the \r\nfight against poverty, such progress has been uneven \r\nand there are still shameful levels of human \r\ndeprivation. \r\n If we look at the history of the countries known \r\nas the least developed countries, we will discover the \r\nhistory of the most heavily colonized, exploited and \r\nsubjugated peoples, dominated by the action of the \r\ncapitalism during its imperialistic phase. We will \r\ncertainly also discover the other side of the \r\ndevelopment model that was historically imposed \r\nthrough the carving up of the colonial and capitalist \r\nworld. Finally, we will discover geopolitical relations \r\nmarked by unequal exchanges and international \r\nplunder in vast regions of the world, for the benefit of \r\na minority of the world’s population. \r\n The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela endorses \r\nthe demands made by the least developed countries \r\naimed at achieving their development goals. In this \r\nregard, development strategies should be compatible \r\nand in line with those countries’ needs, specificities, \r\nresources and possibilities. We call for fulfilling the \r\ncommitment to allocate 0.7 per cent of the gross \r\nnational income of developed countries to official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA), without establishing \r\nany conditionalities. Above all, it is necessary to create \r\npolicies which would enable States to implement their \r\nnational development strategies in a sovereign manner. \r\n In the commerce arena, the world has witnessed \r\nhow global trade has increased almost proportionally to \r\nthe increase in poverty and exclusion, showing that \r\ntrade and economic growth and the mobilization of \r\nnational and international resources resulting from \r\nsuch exchanges, do not necessarily lead to enhanced \r\ndevelopment levels or to lowered poverty statistics. \r\n While developed countries demand greater \r\nopenness and liberalization of the economies of \r\ndeveloping countries, they maintain a system of \r\ndomestic protection over a large part of their economic \r\nproduction, a fact that reveals the double standard in \r\nthe discourse on free trade that some have tried to \r\nimpose as the only way to achieve development. \r\n The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela supports \r\ninitiatives aimed at reducing the burden that foreign \r\ndebt represents in national budgets and considers that \r\nthe formulas which have been proposed to alleviate it \r\nshould not impinge on support for other development \r\nactivities. In this regard, when we assess debt \r\nsustainability, there should be a consultation process \r\nwith the debtor countries which would take into \r\nconsideration national development strategies. It would \r\nbe desirable to increase the presence of developing \r\ncountries in the international financial institutions. \r\nLikewise, we consider that debt sustainability should \r\nnot be measured in terms of the value of exports from \r\ndeveloping countries. \r\n The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has \r\nmaintained long-standing ties with African countries in \r\nterms of cooperation and the strengthening of South-\r\nSouth relationships. We have therefore enhanced our \r\ndiplomatic relations with more than 11 countries over \r\nthe past 15 months by increasing the number of our \r\ndiplomatic missions on that continent to 14. We are \r\nthus the Latin American country with the third largest \r\ndiplomatic representation in Africa, after Cuba and \r\nBrazil. \r\n In the past year, Venezuela has initiated new \r\ncooperation agreements in the political, economic, \r\nsocial, scientific, cultural and energy fields and has \r\nactively promoted multilateralism. As cooperation and \r\nsolidarity among peoples are the guiding principles of \r\nour foreign policy, we have enhanced our cooperation \r\nwith least developed countries in Africa, Latin America \r\nand Asia, in areas such as institution-building, the fight \r\nagainst desertification and humanitarian assistance in \r\nthe form of food and natural disaster relief. In 2005, \r\nthe Bolivarian Government answered the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s call to address the food crisis in the Niger \r\nBasin. Working with Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali and \r\nMauritania, we transferred, through the World Food \r\nProgramme, $3 million, a figure which in the course of \r\n2006 has already increased by more than 100 per cent. \r\n We have done all of this without demanding the \r\nusual perverse conditionalities which threaten the \r\nsovereignty of countries and which prevent us from \r\nfinding authentic ways to eliminate poverty. Such \r\ncontributions to development goals show that, with \r\npolitical will and humanistic ideals, it is possible to \r\nbuild a world which is different from the one that some \r\nare trying to impose on us from the economic centres \r\nof global power and from the international financial \r\ninstitutions, which are marked with the devastating \r\nmark of neoliberal thought. \r\n The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela would like \r\nto reaffirm its commitment to the developing countries, \r\nA/61/PV.8  \r\n \r\n06-52565 38 \r\n \r\nwith the purpose of advancing in building a world \r\nbased on justice, equality and equity. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Bhagirath Basnet, \r\nActing Foreign Secretary, Ministry of Foreign Affairs \r\nof Nepal. \r\n Mr. Basnet (Nepal): I would like to join previous \r\nspeakers in congratulating Ms. Haya Rashed \r\nAl-Khalifa on her election to lead the sixty-first \r\nsession of the General Assembly. I am confident that \r\nunder her able leadership, this review meeting and the \r\ncurrent session of the General Assembly will come to a \r\nsuccessful conclusion. \r\n Let me thank the Secretary-General for his \r\nanalytical report (A/61/173) assessing the progress in \r\nthe implementation of the Brussels Programme of \r\nAction and highlighting the priorities for future action. \r\nThe High Representative for the Least Developed \r\nCountries, Landlocked Developing Countries and \r\nSmall Island Developing States, Mr. Anwarul K. \r\nChowdhury, and his staff, also deserve our appreciation \r\nfor their constructive role in the regional and global \r\nreview process. \r\n Five years ago, we adopted the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action to promote global partnership for \r\nthe development of least developed countries (LDCs) \r\nover the course of a decade. It is only appropriate that \r\nwe should be here to review the progress to date and to \r\ntake measures necessary for the accelerated \r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action. \r\n Intergovernmental reviews and the report of the \r\nSecretary-General (A/61/173) show that there has been \r\nlittle progress in the implementation of the Programme \r\nof Action. The Least Developed Countries Report 2006 \r\nof the United Nations Conference on Trade and \r\nDevelopment confirms that reality. It has become clear \r\nthat many least developed countries will not be able to \r\nachieve the internationally agreed development goals, \r\nincluding the Millennium Development Goals, unless \r\nthere are serious additional efforts to implement them. \r\n Actually, the socio-economic condition in many \r\nleast developed countries has deteriorated over this \r\nperiod. Conflicts, disasters and macroeconomic \r\nimbalances have been hindering growth. In many of \r\nthose nations, a growing population, coupled with \r\nweak growth, has increased the number of people \r\nliving in poverty, disease and illiteracy. High debt \r\nburden, small revenue base and inadequate external \r\nassistance have constrained their capacities to invest in \r\ninfrastructure and social services. Poor access to world \r\nmarkets and supply-side constraints have stifled their \r\nability to trade. In essence, most LDCs have been \r\nfurther marginalized over the past five years. \r\n Least developed countries have been working \r\nhard to meet the Brussels goals in the remaining five \r\nyears. Those mired in conflict have been struggling to \r\nrestore peace and stability. Others have reformed their \r\npolicies, improved their governance, broadened their \r\ndomestic resource base and invested in poverty \r\nreduction activities. However, their efforts alone will \r\nnot suffice to address their deep-seated problems and \r\nrealize the goals agreed to in Brussels. \r\n If least developed countries were to meet these \r\ngoals, their development partners would have to keep \r\ntheir promises as well. It is disheartening that many of \r\ntheir commitments are yet to be fulfilled. For instance, \r\nonly a few wealthy countries have met the official \r\ndevelopment assistance target. Only 18 out of 38 \r\nhighly indebted countries have reached the completion \r\npoint. Several developed countries are yet to offer \r\nduty-free and quota-free market access to LDC \r\nproducts. Even when such access has been provided, \r\nLDCs have not been able to benefit from it due to other \r\nbarriers imposed on trade. Moreover, foreign direct \r\ninvestment has largely skipped over least developed \r\ncountries. \r\n Unless development partners help LDCs to turn \r\nthe situation around, the Brussels goals will remain \r\nunfulfilled. The focus of such support from \r\ndevelopment partners should be on capacity-building in \r\na variety of sectors, so that LDCs can stand on their \r\nown feet sooner rather than later. LDCs emerging from \r\nconflict require additional support and resources to \r\nbuild peace and stabilize their societies. This will give \r\nsuch countries a head start in achieving the targets of \r\nthe Brussels Programme of Action in the period \r\nremaining. \r\n It is not only development partners that should \r\nhelp LDCs in these critical areas. Those developing \r\ncountries that have the capacity and resources to do so \r\nneed to extend generous support to their less fortunate \r\nsister countries. It will be in their national interest not \r\nto have desperate poverty and deprivation in their \r\nneighbourhood. \r\n A/61/PV.8\r\n \r\n39 06-52565 \r\n \r\n The world needs open, free, fair and predictable \r\ntrading arrangements for shared peace and prosperity. \r\nThere should be a level playing field for every country. \r\nIt is a matter of profound concern to Nepal that the \r\nDoha development round negotiations have stalled. We \r\nurge the key trading nations to resume the negotiations \r\nand conclude them without further delay. Special \r\nprovisions will have to be made to safeguard the \r\ninterests of least developed and landlocked developing \r\ncountries in the Doha round. In particular, the \r\ninternational community should help those poor \r\ncountries to effectively operationalize special and \r\ndifferential treatment under the World Trade \r\nOrganization regime and regional plans for trade \r\nfacilitation. These measures will help LDCs to catch up \r\nwith the rest of the developing nations. \r\n My own country, Nepal, is passing through a \r\ncritical political transition. After a historic peaceful \r\nmovement, democracy was restored in April this year, \r\nand a ceasefire has been in place with the Communist \r\nParty of Nepal (Maoist). The Government of Nepal is \r\nnow in the process of negotiations with the Maoists to \r\nend the internal conflict and find lasting peace. Once \r\nthat goal has been achieved, this will pave the way for \r\nbetter implementation of activities geared to \r\nsustainable development in the country. \r\n Currently, Nepal has been implementing its tenth \r\nfive-year plan, 2002-2007, and its Poverty Reduction \r\nStrategy Paper. It has incorporated into the plan \r\nvirtually all the goals and targets of the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action. I am happy to report that, \r\ndespite the conflict, Nepal has made good progress in \r\nreducing extreme poverty, which is now estimated at \r\n30.8 per cent, as compared to 37.7 percent in 2001. \r\n The Government’s policies and priorities are \r\naimed at institutionalizing the democratic system, \r\ndeveloping infrastructure, improving the investment \r\nclimate and attaining broad-based pro-poor growth. \r\nFocus has been on gender perspectives, public-private \r\npartnerships, rural investment and the mobilization of \r\nlocal resources. With a view to promoting good \r\ngovernance, we are stressing effective service delivery \r\nby making the public sector efficient and accountable. \r\nPolicy measures for devolving power to local \r\ngovernments, as well as for combating corruption, have \r\nbeen initiated. In Nepal, there is an urgent need to \r\nlaunch post-conflict reconstruction and rehabilitation \r\nactivities. Success will depend upon the availability of \r\nresources from development partners including United \r\nNations agencies and from other friends. \r\n After assessing the progress made and the \r\nconstraints encountered in the implementation of the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action, LDCs adopted the \r\nCotonou Strategy. The Strategy reaffirms the \r\ncommitment to national ownership in LDC \r\ndevelopment and makes it clear that, unless urgent \r\naction is taken by both LDCs and their development \r\npartners, achieving the Brussels goals in the remaining \r\nfive years will be an uphill task. I believe the Cotonou \r\nStrategy provides a good basis for the future course of \r\naction. Least developed countries need to strengthen \r\ntheir unity, build effective partnerships among \r\nthemselves and persuade their development partners to \r\nagree to implement the Cotonou Strategy. \r\n As we enter the second half of the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action, it is important to ensure \r\ncoherence and consistency among national and \r\ninternational policies and strategies. Coordination and \r\nharmonization of donor assistance in accordance with \r\nnational policies and priorities will be equally \r\nessential. \r\n Finally, I thank the President for convening this \r\nimportant Meeting under her leadership. This Meeting \r\nwill hopefully give much-needed momentum to the \r\nimplementation of the Brussels Programme of Action. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Boroze Tchaa \r\nLasigaisi, Counsellor to the Minister for the Economy, \r\nFinance and Privatization of Togo. \r\n Mr. Boroze (Togo) (spoke in French): Like \r\nprevious speakers, I wish, on behalf of my delegation, \r\nto warmly congratulate Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa \r\non her election to the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-first session. My congratulations \r\ngo also to Mr. Anwarul Chowdhury, United Nations \r\nHigh Representative for the Least Developed \r\nCountries, Landlocked Developing Countries and \r\nSmall Island Developing States, and, through him, to \r\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for their \r\nsustained effort to place the least developed countries \r\n(LDCs) at the centre of the United Nations concerns. \r\n My delegation associates itself with the statement \r\nmade by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of South \r\nAfrica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. \r\nA/61/PV.8  \r\n \r\n06-52565 40 \r\n \r\n This High-level Meeting is justified only by our \r\ncommon desire to find efficient solutions to the \r\nmultiple challenges that the least developed countries \r\nare called upon to meet. They must address the \r\nweakness of their economic growth, the lack of \r\ninterdependence among the sectors of their economies, \r\nthe absence or inadequacy of economic \r\ninfrastructures — including roads, communications and \r\nenergy — and constraints on exports. \r\n The adoption of the Brussels Programme of \r\nAction for the Least Developed Countries for the \r\nDecade 2001-2010 was intended to support these \r\ncountries in meeting all the challenges confronting \r\nthem. After five years of its implementation, the \r\njustifiable hopes aroused by the Programme are far \r\nfrom being realized, despite efforts on all sides. \r\n If the results have been somewhat mixed, as \r\nindicated in the report of the Secretary-General on the \r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action for the \r\nLeast Developed Countries over the past five years \r\n(A/61/173), it is because of the insufficient \r\nmobilization of the financial resources necessary to \r\nsupport the Programme. But also, and in particular, it is \r\nbecause of the weak capacity of our countries to \r\nformulate consistent and credible development \r\nprogrammes likely to be endorsed by our partners. In \r\naddition, it is because of our poor ability to mobilize \r\nand manage available internal and external resources. \r\n For its part, my country intends to continue its \r\nefforts to boost its economy through short-term \r\nconsumption and medium- and long-term investment. \r\nThus, at Lomé in December 2005, we held a national \r\nseminar to adopt recommendations to that end. In that \r\ncontext, we will strive to improve the legal and judicial \r\nenvironment for business and to stabilize the \r\nmacroeconomic framework. Moreover, we will seek to \r\nintensify structural reforms to revitalize the economy \r\nby eliminating the constraints that have prevented it \r\nfrom maximizing its potential. \r\n In that regard, our country has just begun the \r\nprocess of formulating its long-term development \r\nstrategy, which is centred on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. At the end of that process, we \r\nshould have completed our second-generation Poverty \r\nReduction Strategy Paper, based on strategies in the \r\nfollowing areas: accelerating economic growth from \r\nthe standpoint of poverty reduction, mainly by \r\nimproving economic productivity and competitiveness \r\nand promoting sectors that contribute to growth; \r\ndeveloping the social, human resources and \r\nemployment sectors by finding solutions to problems \r\ninvolving health, education, drinking water, sanitation, \r\ngender inequality, social protection and children’s \r\nprotection; promoting the sustainable management of \r\nthe environment, including natural resources, by, inter \r\nalia, boosting national capacities to manage the \r\nenvironment and to strengthen subregional and \r\ninternational cooperation in that area; and, finally, \r\npromoting good governance, focusing on political, \r\ninstitutional, economic and financial governance, \r\ndecentralization and the development of the \r\ncommunity dynamic. \r\n Thus, the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper and \r\nthe Cotonou Strategy will constitute a true tool for \r\nplanning and development with a view to honouring \r\nthe commitments set out in the Brussels Programme of \r\nAction. It will be supported by the Medium-Term \r\nExpenditure Framework, which calculates the amount \r\nof investment necessary to attain the established \r\nobjectives on schedule. Togo, armed with a reference \r\ndocument to guide its actions to achieve long-term \r\ndevelopment, will be able to rely on the support of \r\ndevelopment partners with a view to improved \r\nimplementation of the Programme in its second phase. \r\n Despite its efforts to achieve macroeconomic \r\nstabilization and structural reform, Togo has faced \r\nenormous difficulties in honouring its commitments \r\nunder the Brussels Programme of Action for the Least \r\nDeveloped Countries for the Decade 2001-2010. Many \r\nprojects and programmes have not begun owing to a \r\nlack of financing, and those that have begun have been \r\nimplemented to only a small degree. Three main \r\nfactors explain that situation: the persistence of the \r\nsocio-political crisis, the suspension of international \r\nfinancial cooperation and the absence of a real \r\nInternational Monetary Fund programme. However, we \r\nshould note the continued support of a good number of \r\ndevelopment partners in humanitarian areas, \r\nparticularly health and education. \r\n In that context, the Government has just \r\nundertaken major political measures through the \r\nsigning, on 20 August 2006, of a comprehensive \r\npolitical agreement committing the country to the path \r\nof pacification, the strengthening of social cohesion \r\nand national reconciliation. The recent European tour \r\nmade by the President of the Republic significantly \r\nimproves Togo’s image abroad. The success of that \r\n A/61/PV.8\r\n \r\n41 06-52565 \r\n \r\npolicy will inspire confidence among our major \r\npartners in Togo’s political stability and create an \r\nimpetus for investors to return. \r\n As is often emphasized by the President of the \r\nRepublic of Benin, Chairman of the Least Developed \r\nCountries Coordination Bureau, democracy has no \r\nfuture if it is not accompanied by sustained economic \r\ngrowth. In that regard, the delegation of Togo wishes \r\nonce again to make a heartfelt appeal to all \r\ndevelopment partners for effective implementation of \r\nthe commitments made in the context of the \r\nProgramme of Action for the Least Developed \r\nCountries. I express the hope that this Meeting on the \r\nmidterm review of the Brussels Programme of Action \r\nfor the Least Developed Countries for the Decade \r\n2001-2010 will mark a new beginning of more \r\ndynamic and united international cooperation on behalf \r\nof our countries. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Hideki Ito, Deputy \r\nDirector-General for the Economic Affairs Bureau, \r\nMinistry for Foreign Affairs of Japan. \r\n Mr. Ito (Japan): I would like to express my \r\nsincere appreciation to Under-Secretary-General \r\nChowdhury and the officials of the Secretariat for the \r\nenormous work they put into the preparations for the \r\nmidterm review. \r\n In the five years since the Third United Nations \r\nConference on Least Developed Countries (LDCs) took \r\nplace, efforts by the LDCs and development partners \r\nhave resulted in improvements in the rate of economic \r\ngrowth and other development indices such as life \r\nexpectancy and the child mortality rate. Nevertheless, \r\nmany people in the LDCs are still mired in poverty and \r\nsuffering from its many effects. That is why this \r\nmidterm review is so significant, reaffirming as it does \r\nour commitment to achieve the goals and targets set by \r\nthe Brussels Programme of Action. \r\n Japan understands the problems faced by the \r\nLDCs. It is endeavouring to help address them on a \r\nnumber of fronts, and Japan is determined to make \r\neven greater efforts within the framework of \r\ninternational cooperation. I would like to take this \r\nopportunity to outline Japan’s basic ideas and the \r\nconcrete steps it has taken to achieve the goals and \r\ntargets of the Brussels Programme. \r\n Japan knows from its own experience the \r\nimportance of the roles played by ownership and \r\npartnership at each stage of development. Japan \r\nachieved its current prosperity because of the efforts \r\nmade by each Japanese citizen. In other words, the \r\ndriving force in nation-building is the commitment of \r\nindividual citizens and their strong belief in the future \r\nof their country. \r\n The foundation of Japan’s development was its \r\nownership of development, that is to say, we undertook \r\nand achieved our development through our own efforts. \r\nHowever, Japan also benefited from a partnership of \r\nthe international community. Not long ago, Japan was \r\nreceiving assistance from other countries and \r\ninternational organizations. Its present support for the \r\nleast developed countries is extended based upon the \r\nunderstanding of the importance of both ownership and \r\npartnership. \r\n To provide useful assistance to the least \r\ndeveloped countries, it is also important to take a \r\nhuman-centred point of view, whose paramount \r\nobjective is to protect people against threats such as \r\npoverty, hunger and infectious disease, while at the \r\nsame time seeking to empower them to deal with these \r\nthreats by themselves. From that perspective of the \r\nconcept of human security, Japan places emphasis on \r\nsupporting the basic social services as one of the keys \r\nto helping the poor, and has made substantial \r\ncontributions to work being done in the areas of \r\neducation, health, water and sanitation and gender, \r\nwhich are the core areas of the Brussels Programme of \r\nAction. \r\n For all those reasons, Japan shouldered one fifth \r\nof the entire volume of official development assistance \r\nthrough the 1990s. Last year, Prime Minister Koizumi \r\nannounced that Japan would increase its official \r\ndevelopment assistance by $10 billion in aggregate, \r\nover the course of five years, and would double its \r\nofficial development assistance to Africa in the course \r\nof three years. Japan is committed to providing \r\nassistance that really meets the needs of the \r\nbeneficiaries, placing emphasis on promoting \r\nownership by the least developed countries and \r\ncoordination with other development partners. \r\n Trade and investment are engines of economic \r\ngrowth, which is why Japan launched the Development \r\nInitiative for Trade prior to the World Trade \r\nOrganization (WTO) Ministerial Conference held in \r\nA/61/PV.8  \r\n \r\n06-52565 42 \r\n \r\nHong Kong in December 2005. That initiative seeks to \r\nprovide comprehensive and cross-sectoral support at \r\neach stage of the trading cycle — produce, sell and \r\nbuy — and, to that end, Japan has already begun the \r\ndomestic procedures necessary to provide duty-free \r\nand quota-free market access to most products \r\noriginating from the LDCs as soon as fiscal year 2007, \r\nor thereafter. \r\n The interruption of the WTO Doha Round is a \r\ngenuine disappointment, in that its purpose was to \r\nenable developing countries to derive greater benefit \r\nfrom trade. Japan is determined, however, to do \r\nwhatever it can to restart the negotiations and intends \r\nto move steadily forward with the implementation of \r\nthe Development Initiative for Trade, regardless of the \r\nresults of the Doha Round. \r\n Debt relief is another important issue. Many of \r\nthe LDCs suffer from excessive debt, which is a major \r\nobstacle to achieving sustainable development. Japan \r\nhas provided $2.6 billion in debt relief to 29 highly \r\nindebted poor countries, one fourth of the total volume \r\nof assistance from the G7 countries. In addition, we \r\nwelcome the implementation of the Multilateral Debt \r\nRelief Initiative and intend to act on it promptly and \r\nstay with it until it is fully carried out. \r\n Finally, I would like to explain Japan’s policy on \r\naid to Africa. The continent of Africa is the key to \r\nsolving the problems of the LDCs, as 34 of the 50 \r\nLDCs are there, with many of them facing the \r\nchallenges of poverty and armed conflict. Recognizing \r\nthat there will be no stability and prosperity in the \r\nworld in the twenty-first century, unless the problems \r\nof Africa are resolved, Japan has provided substantial \r\nassistance to Africa. Prime Minister Koizumi visited \r\nEthiopia and Ghana this past spring in a clear \r\ndemonstration of Japan’s concern for the problems of \r\nAfrica. \r\n Japan assists development in Africa mainly in \r\nthree areas; consolidation of peace, poverty reduction \r\nthrough economic growth and human-centred \r\ndevelopment, through the Tokyo International \r\nConference on African Development (TICAD) which \r\nfocuses on African ownership and the partnership of \r\nthe international community. We will continue to \r\ncontribute to the realization of the development of \r\nAfrica in TICAD IV, which is scheduled to be held in \r\n2008. \r\n In conclusion, I believe that the declaration we \r\nshall adopt at this midterm review will serve as a set of \r\nguidelines for the implementation of the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action, and Japan will therefore act in \r\naccordance with the declaration as it makes further \r\nefforts to insure that the Programme of Action is \r\ncarried out. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Pierre Chevalier, \r\nchairman of the Belgian delegation. \r\n Mr. Chevalier (Belgium) (spoke in French): In \r\ndeciding to host the Third United Nations Conference \r\non the Least Developed Countries in Brussels, with the \r\nEuropean Union, Belgium showed its commitment to \r\nthose countries. I am therefore particularly pleased \r\nwith the holding of this high-level meeting, which will \r\nmake it possible to review the midterm implementation \r\nof the Programme of Action that emerged from the \r\nBrussels Conference. \r\n First, let us note that the concerted action of the \r\ninternational community and of the least developed \r\ncountries (LDCs) themselves is starting to bear fruit. \r\nThat group of countries as a whole has seen its growth \r\nimprove since 2001. That was due to different reasons \r\nincluding a reduction in the number of conflicts, \r\neconomic reforms and rising prices for commodities as \r\nwell as renewed growth in official development \r\nassistance. However, despite the strides we have seen, \r\nthe goals of the Brussels Programme of Action still \r\nhave not been attained. The LDCs themselves \r\nunderscored that at Cotonou. Many challenges await us \r\nbefore 2010. \r\n Belgium is continuing efforts to implement the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action. That commitment goes \r\nhand in hand with our desire to contribute to achieving \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. Our efforts for the \r\nleast developed countries are part of the efforts of the \r\nEuropean Union. That guarantees greater consistency \r\nas well as greater effectiveness. We therefore fully \r\nsupport the statement made by the Finnish Presidency \r\nof the European Union. What I would like to do now is \r\nsimply to highlight a few of Belgium’s initiatives. \r\n We have made a commitment to attaining the \r\nobjective of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for \r\nofficial development assistance by 2010. In 2005, our \r\nofficial development assistance was already more than \r\n0.5 per cent. Our assistance to the least developed \r\ncountries now totals 0.21 per cent of our gross \r\n A/61/PV.8\r\n \r\n43 06-52565 \r\n \r\ndomestic product, thus going beyond the commitments \r\nwe undertook at the Brussels Conference. Furthermore, \r\nour assistance to the least developed countries is \r\nalmost entirely without conditions. \r\n However, beyond official development \r\nassistance, it is the participation of the least developed \r\ncountries that will drive their growth. But the capacity \r\nof the least developed countries fully to participate in \r\ninternational trade will also depend on their ability to \r\ndiversify their exports. Belgium will continue to \r\nsupport the Integrated Framework for Trade-related \r\nTechnical Assistance for the least developed countries \r\nand to finance programmes designed to strengthen their \r\ncapacities in terms of trade negotiations. \r\n We would like to stress the importance of the role \r\nof private investment in economic development and in \r\njob creation. That is why in 2001 Belgium set up the \r\nBelgian Investment Organization for Developing \r\nCountries, a new type of public and private partnership \r\nbetween the Belgian State and the Belgian Corporation \r\nfor International Investment. Its goal is to promote the \r\nprivate sector, particularly in Africa. \r\n Finally, I would like to point out that Belgium \r\ndecided in 2005 to cancel the trade debt of all countries \r\nhaving reached the completion point within the \r\nframework of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries \r\n(HIPC) Debt Initiative. \r\n In order to make further progress towards the \r\ngoals set out in our Programme of Action, we must \r\ncontinue to devote the necessary attention to policies \r\non population, education, promotion of women’s rights \r\nand job creation, particularly for young people. The \r\npartnership that is at the very core of the Programme of \r\nAction will lead to lasting results if the Governments \r\nconcerned continue with the necessary economic \r\nreforms and consolidate their political and judicial \r\nstability. We must also strengthen good governance and \r\nensure that the entire population reaps the benefits of \r\ngrowth. We are ready to work together to that end. \r\n It is clear that poverty is not something \r\ninevitable. Achieving the objectives of the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action remains within our reach as long \r\nas all of us — least developed countries and \r\ndevelopment partners — shoulder our responsibilities. \r\nI hope that our work will provide us with the necessary \r\nimpetus to continue along this path. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I give \r\nthe floor to the representative of Switzerland, Her \r\nExcellency Ms. Nicole Ruder. \r\n Ms. Ruder (Switzerland) (spoke in French): It is \r\nan honour for me to make this statement on behalf of \r\nMr. Walter Fust, Director-General of the Agency for \r\nDevelopment and Cooperation of Switzerland. \r\n Allow me first to express Switzerland’s gratitude \r\nto the least developed countries for the considerable \r\nefforts they have made to prepare this midterm global \r\nreview of the implementation of the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action, at both the national and regional \r\nlevels — efforts that culminated in the Ministerial \r\nConference held at Cotonou. \r\n When our Parliament established the legal basis \r\nfor Swiss development cooperation in 1976, it defined \r\nassistance to the world’s poorest countries as its \r\nprincipal aim. For 30 years, that goal has remained at \r\nthe heart of our activities, and we have consistently \r\ntried to improve the quality and enhance the impact of \r\nthese activities as well as increase funding for them. \r\nFor example, the funds allocated to the least developed \r\ncountries rose from $243 million in 2001 to $388 \r\nmillion in 2005. \r\n I do not wish to dwell here on what Switzerland \r\nhas done to date to contribute to the implementation of \r\nthe goals of the Brussels Programme of Action, \r\nbecause an assessment of Switzerland’s contribution \r\ncan be found in a brief document available in this Hall. \r\nInstead, I wish to share a few thoughts with the \r\nAssembly about some of the conditions that we believe \r\nare essential to increase the pace of development in the \r\nleast developed countries. \r\n The Governments of the least developed \r\ncountries have a crucial role to play. While the \r\ninternational community is devoting increased \r\nattention to the implementation of the Paris agenda on \r\nthe alignment and harmonization of aid, the primary \r\nresponsibility for integrating the key elements of the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action and of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals in national poverty-reduction \r\nstrategies lies with the Governments of the least \r\ndeveloped countries, which also must ensure that these \r\nstrategies are the overarching reference for all their \r\ndevelopment partners, internal and external. \r\n We are fully aware of the fact that many \r\nGovernments of least developed countries have long \r\nA/61/PV.8  \r\n \r\n06-52565 44 \r\n \r\nexpressed a considerable need for capacity-building, \r\nand we acknowledge that much remains to be done. \r\nThat is why we are trying to improve the performance \r\nof our bilateral assistance in this field; we also \r\nencourage our multilateral partners substantially to \r\nincrease their involvement in this sector, in particular \r\nUnited Nations agencies, which have a real \r\ncomparative advantage here. \r\n Moreover, we feel that it is essential that the \r\nGovernments of the least developed countries succeed \r\nin instituting equitable and transparent fiscal policies \r\nthat can ensure a better redistribution of resources. In \r\nthat respect, it is quite often possible to expand the tax \r\nbase and to make taxes more progressive, to ensure \r\nthat those citizens and enterprises that already benefit \r\nfrom globalization contribute in an equitable way to \r\nnational solidarity. Moreover, by concentrating efforts \r\nto achieve the sound management of these resources — \r\na country’s most valuable source of revenue — it \r\nshould be possible to have a positive impact in all other \r\nsectors of governance. Good governance also requires \r\nstrong support for national capacity-strengthening — \r\nan area in which we are prepared to increase our \r\ninvolvement. \r\n In a related area, Switzerland has noted with \r\nconcern that the monitoring system for the \r\nimplementation of the Brussels Programme of Action \r\nwithin the United Nations is extremely bureaucratic, \r\ncreating an administrative burden for the least \r\ndeveloped countries and donor countries, which we do \r\nnot find very constructive. Furthermore, the particular \r\nsituation of the least developed countries has led to a \r\nseries of specific recommendations within the \r\nframework of other conferences such as the Monterrey \r\nConference and the Johannesburg Summit. It might be \r\nuseful to try and ensure a simplified and coherent form \r\nof monitoring by asking the Secretariat to reconcile the \r\nvarious components of this very complex normative \r\nframework. \r\n Such an undertaking would, however, require a \r\nsubstantial improvement in cooperation between the \r\nrelevant administrative units of the United Nations — \r\nin particular the Office of the High Representative, the \r\nFinancing for Development Office, the Department of \r\nSocial and Economic Affairs’ Division for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, the United Nations Conference on Trade \r\nand Development and the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme. \r\n At the national level, the follow-up mechanism \r\nfor national poverty-reduction strategies seems to be \r\nsufficient to ensure follow-up of the implementation of \r\nthe Brussels Programme of Action and the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, at least in the countries where \r\nsuch a mechanism exists. \r\n If we want to reach the goals of the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action by the given deadline, it is today \r\nmore evident than ever that greater and better \r\ncoordinated efforts are needed on the part of all \r\ndevelopment partners, including developing as well as \r\nindustrialized countries, Governments and civil society, \r\nbilateral and multilateral organizations, development \r\nbanks, and the public and private sectors. \r\n As Switzerland already stated at Brussels, we are \r\nconvinced that efficiency in giving least developed \r\ncountries the support they need can be attained only if \r\nbroad consensus and a better division of labour are \r\nachieved among international financial institutions, \r\nUnited Nations agencies and bilateral cooperation \r\nagencies. \r\n Indeed, the facilitation of such a consensus was \r\nour aim when we very explicitly supported the creation \r\nin New York of the position of a High Representative \r\nfor the Least Developed Countries, believing that this \r\nlocation would allow the Representative to develop \r\nmore functional links in this field between the United \r\nNations and the Bretton Wood institutions. We \r\nacknowledge the recent efforts made in this respect, \r\nbut we are convinced that much more could be \r\nundertaken and achieved. \r\n Switzerland remains ready to join this collective \r\neffort. We wish to affirm unequivocally once again our \r\nprimary commitment to the least developed countries \r\nand to the implementation of the Brussels Programme \r\nof Action. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the floor to Mr. John Hewko, Vice-President, \r\nMillennium Challenge Corporation of the United States \r\nof America. \r\n Mr. Hewko (United States of America): The \r\nUnited States is pleased to be able to participate in this \r\nimportant event to discuss the issue of the social and \r\neconomic development of the least developed \r\ncountries. \r\n Desperate poverty challenges us all. Without \r\nhope, opportunity and freedom, unchecked poverty \r\n A/61/PV.8\r\n \r\n45 06-52565 \r\n \r\nbreaks trust, impedes effective action and breeds anger \r\nand despair. \r\n Let me be clear. The people of the United States \r\nand their Government know that it is in our national \r\ninterest to help lift from poverty those in the \r\neconomically least developed countries (LDCs). Under \r\nthis Administration, development has become a pillar \r\nin our national security strategy. \r\n United States official development assistance has \r\nnearly tripled from 2000 to 2005, from just under $10 \r\nbillion to nearly $27.5 billion. United States bilateral \r\naid to the least developed countries is up sharply as \r\nwell, increasing by over 40 per cent to nearly $5 billion \r\nfrom 2004 to 2005 alone. Aid to Africa, where growth \r\nand other positive change is visible in many places, \r\nwas three and a half times greater in 2005 than it was \r\nin 2000. These are the biggest aid increases since the \r\nMarshall Plan. \r\n The United States is also by far the largest single \r\nsource of humanitarian aid and disaster relief and of \r\naid in the fight against HIV-AIDS, tuberculosis, \r\nmalaria and polio. \r\n Private philanthropic giving is a tradition for \r\nUnited States citizens, who believe deeply in helping \r\nothers. Every year, billions of dollars flow from our \r\npeople to yours, to assist those devastated by tsunamis, \r\nfloods, famines and other tragic events. United States \r\nsupport goes wherever people are suffering, regardless \r\nof where they may be. \r\n Along with the international community, the \r\nUnited States knows that there is no substitute for the \r\nstrong will and efforts of the least developed \r\nthemselves in the long quest to end desperate poverty. \r\nYet, donor partners and outside aid can play an \r\nimportant, catalytic role. \r\n In recent decades, hundreds of millions of people \r\nhave been lifted from poverty by economic growth and \r\nthe creation of more capable institutions. There is \r\nunprecedented hope and practical evidence that \r\ntogether we can help the poorest enjoy better lives with \r\ntheir families and communities. \r\n In the year 2000, the United States and United \r\nNations partners agreed to work to meet the \r\nquantitative development goals set forth at the \r\nMillennium Summit. In 2002, in Monterrey, the United \r\nStates also agreed with our United Nations partners to \r\nprovide more aid to countries taking the essential steps \r\nto help their own people make development progress. \r\n We have kept our promise. \r\n In Monterrey, President Bush announced a path-\r\nbreaking programme, the Millennium Challenge \r\nCorporation (MCC). The MCC’s single focus is to \r\nprovide support to those poor countries that are taking \r\nsteps to invest in their own people, to promote \r\neconomic freedom and opportunity and to encourage \r\naccountable and inclusive governance, where \r\nindividual rights and free expression are respected. The \r\nMCC’s mandate is to reduce poverty through \r\nsustainable economic growth. We work with partners \r\nwhose own performance makes reaching that goal a \r\nreal possibility. The MCC is already engaged with 23 \r\ncountries whose policy performance, measured by \r\nindependent, objective indicators, has made them \r\neligible for MCC funds. Among them are 12 least \r\ndeveloped countries. \r\n We are proud to have already reached agreement \r\nwith nine partner countries on the Millennium \r\nChallenge Compact programmes designed to get real \r\nresults for the poor. Our current nine Compact partners \r\nare Madagascar, Cape Verde, Honduras, Nicaragua, \r\nGeorgia, Armenia, Vanuatu, Ghana and Benin. Four of \r\nthese are least developed countries. \r\n Our Compact partner countries deserve credit, as \r\ndo all the eligible countries, for their performance. \r\nThey are creating conditions for progress. Cape Verde \r\nis actually graduating from least developed country \r\nstatus. We hope that MCC support brings them still \r\nmore development success. \r\n The United States has committed over $2 billion \r\nto our Compact partners. We commit the full amount of \r\nthese multi-year programmes in advance. If partner \r\ncountries continue their good development efforts, they \r\ncan count on United States support. Each Compact \r\ncountry also has worked very hard to consult with its \r\nown people and to develop sound development \r\ninvestment proposals for MCC funding. We require \r\nthat Governments identify the poverty impacts and \r\neconomic benefits, including specific beneficiaries and \r\nparticular development outcomes — not just budget \r\ncosts and kilometres of roads paved — so that together \r\nwe can make headway on concrete development goals. \r\nThey have met that challenge. \r\nA/61/PV.8  \r\n \r\n06-52565 46 \r\n \r\n The approach taken by the United States \r\nMillennium Challenge Corporation reflects decades of \r\nexperience on what drives lasting development \r\nprogress. It also embodies what we all agreed to do in \r\nthe 2001 Brussels Programme of Action for the Least \r\nDeveloped Countries. There is no “one-size fits all” \r\nrecipe for development. Country ownership, capacity-\r\nbuilding, just and inclusive governance, effective \r\ninstitutions and rule of law, open markets, trade and \r\nproductive investment, environmental sustainability \r\nand mobilization of financial resources must all be part \r\nof the mix. \r\n The MCC approach embodies these ingredients in \r\nits performance incentives, in its partnership with \r\ndeveloping countries, in the substantial resources it \r\nmakes available to them and in the measurable results \r\nit expects from them. \r\n We enjoy very much the hope that a growing \r\neconomy, investments in people and a culture of \r\nentrepreneurship bring to our society. We know by \r\nexperience that these things do not come easily, or \r\novernight. But, hope, opportunity and inclusion are \r\nantidotes to the frustration and deprivation that can \r\ndrive people apart. \r\n The United States, including those of us at the \r\nMillennium Challenge Corporation, will stand \r\nshoulder-to-shoulder with the least developed countries \r\nas they strive to better the lives of their citizens. Their \r\nprogress will be ours as well. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the floor to Ms. Rosemary Banks, chairperson of \r\nthe delegation of New Zealand. \r\n Ms. Banks (New Zealand): The theme of this \r\nyear’s General Assembly debate, implementing a \r\nglobal partnership for development, is directly relevant \r\nto this Brussels Programme of Action five-year review. \r\nThe key to success in eradicating poverty in least \r\ndeveloped countries (LDCs) is through global \r\npartnerships. \r\n Through the seven commitments of the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action, least developed countries urged \r\nstronger action upon themselves and also from donors. \r\nOnly modest progress has been made in the last five \r\nyears. It is unacceptable that there is still so much \r\npoverty and hunger in least developed countries. \r\n We welcome this High-level Meeting as an \r\nopportunity to renew our commitments to supporting \r\nthe least developed on their path towards sustainable \r\ngrowth. The New Zealand Government, through its \r\ninternational aid and development agency, New \r\nZealand AID, contributes approximately 29 per cent on \r\naverage of the official development assistance (ODA) \r\nbilateral budget to least developed countries. \r\n New Zealand AID has a core focus on the Pacific, \r\nwhere five of our partners are LDCs — Vanuatu, \r\nSamoa, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu and Kiribati. We also \r\nhave programmes in Cambodia, Laos and Timor Leste, \r\nas well as a modest regional programme that includes \r\nZambia, Tanzania and Mozambique. \r\n The Secretary-General in his report identifies \r\nthree particular obstacles to implementation by least \r\ndeveloped countries of the Brussels Programme of \r\nAction, and these are country ownership, capacity and \r\nresources. New Zealand AID has aimed to recognize \r\nthose constraints in our programmes for LDCs. We \r\nhave done this by aligning as closely as possible with \r\npartner countries’ own systems and by encouraging \r\nharmonization with other donors, in line with the Paris \r\nDeclaration on Aid Effectiveness. \r\n New Zealand has, for example, taken a leading \r\nrole in helping to bring donors together to deal with the \r\neducation sector in the Pacific. A practical example of \r\nthis is the joint project we have between New Zealand, \r\nthe European Union and the Solomon Islands to cover \r\nthree years of investment in the education sector. \r\n An important principle of New Zealand AID’s \r\nengagement with LDCs is to build partner capacity, \r\nincluding in public sector management and \r\ngovernance. \r\n We recognize, however, that the primary \r\nresponsibility for development in LDCs rests with \r\nLDCs themselves. The voices of least developed \r\ncountry partners were heard at Cotonou recently. We \r\nneed to listen to them. \r\n We need to use all of the mechanisms available to \r\nus to support LDC development, including committed \r\naction in international forums, such as the World Trade \r\nOrganization. While LDCs are not themselves expected \r\nto make commitments in the Doha Round of trade \r\nnegotiations, they have the potential to reap significant \r\ngains; but only if we in the international community \r\nare able to make progress towards an agreement that \r\ncan deliver improvements in market access and reduce \r\nthe distortions prevailing in international markets. We \r\n A/61/PV.8\r\n \r\n47 06-52565 \r\n \r\nmust ensure when negotiations resume that the \r\nprogress already made in the Doha Round is retained. \r\nNew Zealand, for example, already provides duty-free \r\nand quota-free access for LDC products. \r\n The least developed countries represent the \r\neconomically poorest and weakest segment of the \r\ninternational community. Let us hope that in five years \r\ntime we shall have some better results to point to, and \r\nthat through our dialogue and sharing of experience we \r\nwill have deeper understandings of the responses that \r\nhave been the most successful in implementing the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Youssef Amrani, Director-General, \r\nMinistry for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of \r\nMorocco. \r\n Mr. Amrani (Morocco) (spoke in French): \r\nToday’s meeting is an occasion to measure the results \r\nof the implementation of the goals and commitments \r\nagreed to at the Third Conference on the Least \r\nDeveloped Countries in Brussels in 2001. It is also an \r\noccasion to examine the difficulties encountered and \r\nassess the principal measures that have been taken \r\ntowards implementing and, above all, in carrying out, \r\nthe Brussels Programme of Action. \r\n In Morocco, we believe that the proposals that \r\nhave emerged from that meeting must necessarily \r\nbreathe new energy into our efforts, with a view to \r\ncreating conditions that are conducive to a true \r\neconomic take-off for the least developed countries. \r\n Given the Cotonou Declaration and the strategy \r\nadopted at the Conference of the Least Developed \r\nCountries in Benin in 2006, the international \r\ncommunity should work together to achieve the \r\ncommitments made for the benefit of the least \r\ndeveloped countries, in particular the implementation \r\nof the Brussels Programme of Action as a basic \r\nframework of the partnership for sustained growth, \r\nsustainable development, and the eradication of \r\npoverty. \r\n In that respect, we call upon the international \r\ncommunity to increase its efforts to adopt urgent \r\nmeasures geared towards attaining the goals of the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action as well as those of the \r\nMonterrey Consensus. We should also emphasize that, \r\nif the least developed countries (LDCs) have the \r\nprimary responsibility for their own development, it is \r\nthe responsibility of the international community to \r\nprovide them with technical assistance, which is \r\nneeded not only for their development, but also to help \r\ndiversify their productive capacity and stimulate \r\neconomic growth, which will certainly lead to the \r\ncreation of jobs and the eradication of poverty and \r\npromote development. \r\n Within the framework of the implementation of \r\nthe Brussels Programme of Action, Morocco has taken \r\ncertain concrete steps; I will mention a few of them. \r\nWithin that framework, Morocco cancelled all of the \r\ndebt of African least developed countries and decided, \r\nas well, to provide free access to the Moroccan market \r\nfor export commodities from African LDCs, \r\neliminating all tariff and non-tariff barriers. \r\n Since taking the throne, His Majesty King \r\nMohammed VI has always promoted active solidarity \r\nfor the least developed countries. He thus travelled \r\nextensively in many African countries, introducing into \r\nMoroccan cooperation with the African continent \r\nassistance in many areas such as locust control and \r\nhealth care, as well as sharing expertise in agriculture \r\nand water resource management. \r\n Morocco has also made a commitment with the \r\nmany member States of the Economic Community of \r\nWest African States (ECOWAS) to promote trade, and \r\nis on the verge of concluding a free-trade agreement \r\nwith the member States of that subregional \r\norganization, thus further strengthening cooperation \r\nwith those countries in the areas of trade and \r\ninvestment. In addition, in 2001 Morocco joined the \r\nCommunity of Sahelo-Saharan States, which includes \r\nsixteen States of the region. It has also expressed the \r\ndesire to join ECOWAS. \r\n There are other sectors that are part of more \r\nintensive cooperation programmes within that group of \r\nAfrican brothers and partners, such as infrastructure, \r\ncommunications, mines, banks, irrigation, agronomy, \r\nas well as air transport. For example, there is the \r\nestablishment of Air Senegal in 2001, based upon a \r\npartnership between Royal Air Maroc and Senegal, as \r\nwell as the upcoming partnership of Royal Air Maroc \r\nwith other African airlines. Those are perfect examples \r\nof that cooperation and reflect Morocco’s solidarity \r\nwith the LDCs in the area of regional economic \r\nintegration, which Morocco has made a firm \r\ncommitment to support. \r\nA/61/PV.8  \r\n \r\n06-52565 48 \r\n \r\n Morocco also stands out for its cooperation in the \r\narea of universities and the training of technicians and \r\nmanagers. Each year, the Moroccan Agency for \r\nInternational Cooperation offers 6,000 grants to \r\nAfrican students who are pursuing their studies in \r\nMoroccan training centres. \r\n Morocco has also focused on promoting the \r\ndevelopment of Africa, in pleading for a new \r\npartnership. It has supported the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) in all international \r\nforums. As well, Morocco has developed tripartite \r\ncooperation for LDCs in cooperation with other \r\ncountries in Europe and Asia, as well as with regional \r\ninternational organizations such as the European Union \r\nand the Food and Agriculture Organization of the \r\nUnited Nations, among others. \r\n Furthermore, in the Moroccan private sector, \r\nMoroccan economic stakeholders are solicited by many \r\nAfrican partner LDCs for cooperation in many areas \r\nsuch as trade and investment. In that context, the \r\nMoroccan Centre for the Promotion of Export \r\nmaintains extensive and sustained cooperation with its \r\nAfrican partners. \r\n In June 2003, upon Morocco’s initiative, a special \r\nministerial conference on LDCs was held in Rabat and \r\nwas an ideal opportunity to relaunch the debate on the \r\neconomic and social situation of those countries. \r\nConvinced that the development of African countries, \r\nin particular that of the LDCs, cannot take place \r\nwithout political stability and peacebuilding, Morocco \r\nconvened a meeting in Rabat with the heads of State of \r\nthe Mano River Union region. \r\n Morocco has also taken part in several \r\npeacekeeping operations, including in Somalia, the \r\nCôte d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo \r\nand Haiti. Furthermore, His Majesty King Mohammed \r\nVI was one of the first heads of State to respond to the \r\nappeal of the authorities of Niger in connection with \r\nthe difficult food situation there in June 2005. \r\n I would like to conclude by stating that, when it \r\ncomes to the multilateral trade system, Morocco has \r\nalways aimed at satisfying the demands of LDCs so \r\nthat they can benefit from the appropriate flexibility \r\nwhen it comes to implementing their commitments. We \r\nshould also point out that it is our duty to redouble our \r\nefforts and to mobilize our energy in order to \r\nimplement our commitments and attain the goals that \r\nwe have set for ourselves. \r\n It is vital that the partnership between the LDCs \r\nand their development partners should be made more \r\ndynamic in order to promote their mutual and shared \r\nresponsibility. In this regard, Morocco reaffirms its \r\ncommitment to continue to strengthen the spirit of \r\nsolidarity and cooperation with the LDCs and will \r\nspare no effort in order to provide support and \r\nassistance for the effective attainment of the objectives \r\nset out in the Brussels Programme of Action. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the floor to Mr. Ahmed Alyahya, Director for \r\nResearch of the Saudi Development Fund of the \r\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia. \r\n Mr. Alyahya (Saudi Arabia) (spoke in Arabic): It \r\ngives me great pleasure to convey to the Assembly the \r\ngreetings of the Saudi leadership and its best wishes \r\nfor the success of the Meeting and the achievement of \r\nour goals. I also wish to thank you for inviting the \r\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia to participate in the work of \r\nthe Meeting. \r\n This Meeting at the midpoint of the decade 2001-\r\n2010 will evaluate the progress made in implementing \r\nthe Brussels Programme of Action for the Least \r\nDeveloped Countries (LDCs). Those countries have \r\ncome a long way, reducing financial deficits, lowering \r\ninflation rates and foreign debt, and developing human \r\nand institutional capabilities. \r\n Development partners have exerted considerable \r\nefforts to help in attaining these results. Official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) increased by 75 per \r\ncent over the period 2001-2004, and certain innovative \r\nideas for tapping alternative development financing \r\nsources have been put to work. A growing portion of \r\nthe financing is being channelled to fund projects of \r\nimmediate benefit to the poor, such as health services \r\nand education, as well as small and medium-sized \r\nprojects, within the poverty reduction strategies of \r\nthose countries. \r\n As a developing country that understands the \r\ncircumstances and challenges of other developing \r\ncountries, and as an effective player in the international \r\narena, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has undertaken to \r\nassist other developing countries in achieving \r\ndevelopment and in attaining higher standards of \r\nliving. \r\n Although Saudi Arabian support for international \r\ndevelopment comes from non-renewable sources, the \r\n A/61/PV.8\r\n \r\n49 06-52565 \r\n \r\nKingdom has willingly provided assistance in the form \r\nof grants or soft loans, free of political or commercial \r\nconditions. By so doing, the Kingdom reaffirms the \r\nimportance of ownership by an aid-receiving country \r\nof its development programme. Saudi Arabian \r\ndevelopment assistance over the past three decades has \r\nexceeded $84 billion, benefiting 87 developing \r\ncountries on various continents. This represents more \r\nthan 4 per cent of the average annual gross national \r\nproduct of Saudi Arabia, thus exceeding the target set \r\nby the United Nations sixfold, and putting the \r\nKingdom at the top of the international ranking. \r\n The Kingdom has been committed to extending \r\nmaterial and moral support to multilateral development \r\ninstitutions, including Arab, regional and international. \r\nThese institutions, to which Saudi Arabia contributes \r\ncapital and provides managerial and technical support, \r\nplay an effective role in advancing the economic and \r\nsocial development of developing countries. The \r\nKingdom’s total contributions to such institutions have \r\nexceeded $24 billion. In order to help alleviate \r\ndevelopmental burdens and pressures, Saudi Arabia has \r\nalso taken the initiative of writing off more than \r\n$6 billion of debt due by LDCs and extending debt \r\nrelief to eligible countries included in the Heavily \r\nIndebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative. \r\n In addition, the Kingdom ranks second \r\ninternationally in terms of cash remittances sent abroad \r\nby the foreign labour workforce in Saudi Arabia, which \r\nare estimated to total more than $15 billion annually. \r\nSuch huge money transfers are very important as an \r\nessential source of foreign currency and financial \r\ninflows to labour-exporting countries. They also play a \r\nleading role in improving the well-being of \r\nimpoverished households. \r\n Saudi Arabia’s accession to the World Trade \r\nOrganization in December 2005 will certainly boost \r\ntrade between the Kingdom and other countries, in \r\nparticular those in the developing world. This is an \r\nadditional contribution by Saudi Arabia to help \r\npromote trade with developing countries in support of \r\ndevelopment and poverty reduction. \r\n Through the Saudi Fund for Development, Saudi \r\nArabia has focused especially on supporting \r\ninfrastructure in developing countries, including the \r\nconstruction of hospitals and schools and the paving of \r\nroads, particularly those in rural areas, in order to \r\nfoster agricultural and rural development and help \r\nalleviate poverty. \r\n To improve aid coordination with other sources \r\nof finance and streamline procedures with development \r\npartners, the Saudi Fund for Development established \r\nsome 30 years ago, with sister development agencies, a \r\ncoordinating group to ensure consistency of \r\nprocedures, exchange of development information, \r\njoint administration of loans and co-financing \r\narrangements for development projects of common \r\ninterest. \r\n Although the progress achieved in the \r\nimplementation of the programme is considerable, \r\nwhat remains to be accomplished is also considerable. \r\nIt requires the collective efforts of developing \r\ncountries and their development partners. The \r\nparticipation of the Kingdom in this international \r\ngathering demonstrates the willingness of Saudi Arabia \r\nto continue to support the development efforts of \r\ndeveloping countries and other donor countries and \r\nagencies in attaining the common goal of development. \r\nI wish the Meeting every success in its endeavours. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the floor to Mr. Arjan Paul Hamburger, Deputy \r\nPermanent Representative of the Netherlands. \r\n Mr. Hamburger (Netherlands): We align \r\nourselves with the statement of Finland on behalf of \r\nthe European Union. \r\n The Netherlands has, for many years, been a \r\nmajor provider of development assistance. We have \r\nallocated substantially more than the United Nations \r\ntarget of 0.7 per cent of our gross national income to \r\nofficial development assistance (ODA) over several \r\ndecades now. We remain fully committed to supporting \r\nthe least developed countries (LDCs). This should be \r\nclear from the fact that the Netherlands contributes \r\n0.25 per cent of its ODA to LDCs, which is \r\nsignificantly above the United Nations target of 0.15 \r\nper cent. Half of the ODA goes to Africa. \r\n A significant number of our partner countries, \r\nnotably in Africa, fall into the category of LDCs. Many \r\nof those countries are making enormous efforts to \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \r\nthrough economic growth, improved performance in \r\nsocial sectors and greater focus on issues like \r\ngovernance. \r\nA/61/PV.8  \r\n \r\n06-52565 50 \r\n \r\n At the same time, we share the concern raised in \r\nvarious forums that progress has been uneven. For \r\nsome LDCs, the likelihood of attaining the Goals by \r\n2015 is becoming more remote rather than coming \r\ncloser. Shortfalls are especially serious with respect to \r\nchild and maternal mortality and access to safe \r\ndrinking water and basic sanitation. Unless we \r\naccelerate, most MDGs will not be met by 2015. \r\n Falling levels of aid throughout most of the 1990s \r\nhave certainly been a factor. Although this trend has \r\nnow been reversed, at least an additional US$ 50-60 \r\nbillion must be raised annually in order to achieve the \r\nMDGs. We need to see a more equal sharing of the \r\nburden. We call on developed countries, especially the \r\nGroup of Eight, to join actively in delivering the \r\nUnited Nations target of 0.7 per cent of gross national \r\nincome as ODA. We also call on non-traditional donors \r\nto step in and increase their assistance. \r\n As for policy, we have learned a good deal about \r\nincreasing the effectiveness of aid. We have focused \r\nour support on poor countries with good policy \r\nenvironments. We have learned that poverty reduction \r\ncan be sustainable only when economic, social and \r\necological development is in balance. Strengthening \r\ninstitutional capacity and stimulating good governance \r\nare prerequisites for sustainable development. \r\n Trade and integration into regional and world \r\neconomies are essential preconditions for economic \r\ndevelopment and poverty reduction. The Netherlands \r\nsupports an open, rule-based, predictable and non-\r\ndiscriminatory trade system, progressive trade \r\nliberalization and elimination of distorting subsidies \r\nand non-tariff barriers. LDCs would benefit from such \r\na system. In addition, preferential treatment for LDCs, \r\nlike the Everything but Arms initiative, can contribute \r\nto improved trading opportunities. We urge other \r\ncountries to give LDCs similar trade preferences. In the \r\nDoha Development Round, the European Union has \r\nput strong emphasis on trade-related technical \r\nassistance. However, trade preferences and ODA are \r\nonly one side of the coin. The other side is that LDCs \r\nmust strengthen their business and investment climate \r\nand promote a strong and competitive private sector. \r\n More efficient and effective use of existing \r\nresources is another area where important gains can be \r\nmade. Improving effectiveness by supporting country \r\nownership and leadership and better coordination \r\namong donor organizations has already yielded results \r\nin a number of countries. Recipient countries should do \r\ntheir part, as we should do ours as donor countries. As \r\ndeveloping countries improve their policies, \r\ninstitutions and governance, aid will be used more \r\neffectively and will therefore have greater impact. \r\n Recently, the architecture of international aid — \r\nincluding bilateral donors and such multilateral \r\norganizations as the United Nations, the international \r\nfinance institutions and global funds — has become \r\nmore and more complex. It has placed an ever-\r\nincreasing demand on the capacity of developing \r\ncountries. The Secretary-General’s High-level Panel on \r\nSystem-wide Coherence provides a unique chance to \r\nrestyle the way in which the United Nations is \r\noperating, especially at the country level. \r\n In many developing countries, the United Nations \r\nis represented by some 10 to 12 different agencies, all \r\noperating their own offices and managing their own \r\nprogrammes. The Netherlands strongly supports a \r\nmuch more streamlined United Nations at the country \r\nlevel. This streamlining need not be a one-size-fits-all \r\nprescription, but it should be based on the needs and \r\ncapacity of the country concerned. In countries where \r\ncapacity is scarce, a unified United Nations needs to \r\nact on the basis of a single programme, a single budget \r\nand preferably a single financial mechanism. We look \r\nforward to discussing the report of the High-level \r\nPanel with our partners here in the United Nations at \r\nthe country level. \r\n Finally, we must deliver on the commitments \r\nfrom the Brussels Programme of Action. Improving the \r\nlives of those living in poverty requires a sustained and \r\ncomprehensive effort from all of us, developed as well \r\nas developing countries. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Jamal Nasser \r\nAl-Bader, chairman of the delegation of the State of \r\nQatar. \r\n Mr. Al-Bader (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I would like to associate myself with the \r\nstatement made by the representative of South Africa \r\non behalf of the Group of 77 and China. \r\n The importance of this review is to confirm the \r\ncommitments undertaken by States to implement the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action for the Least Developed \r\nCountries for the Decade 2001-2010 and at other major \r\nUnited Nations conferences and summits. In this vein, \r\n A/61/PV.8\r\n \r\n51 06-52565 \r\n \r\nwe view the Cotonou Declaration as a comprehensive \r\nreview that addresses shortcomings in the \r\nimplementation of the Brussels Programme of Action. \r\n My delegation attaches the utmost importance to \r\nimplementation of the measures included in the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action and their translation \r\ninto concrete, specific steps and actions, in accordance \r\nwith the national development framework of the least \r\ndeveloped countries (LDCs), with a view to \r\neliminating poverty and achieving social and economic \r\ndevelopment in those countries. In this regard, my \r\ndelegation believes that the General Assembly can, \r\nunder the broad mandate assigned to it, play a leading \r\nrole in mobilizing international capacities, discuss the \r\nbest means to implement the goals defined in the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action and address the \r\nchallenges that stand in the way of achievement of the \r\nProgramme’s objectives. \r\n The Brussels Programme of Action includes a \r\nglobal commitment to tackle poverty in the LDCs \r\nthrough the mobilization of greater domestic and \r\ninternational resources in order to promote \r\ndevelopment and address structural challenges in those \r\ncountries. According to the Secretary-General’s report, \r\nthe progress of the LDCs on most of the goals of the \r\nProgramme has been so slow and uneven that it has \r\nfallen short of achieving the goals envisaged in the \r\nProgramme of Action for the LDCs and its aim of \r\neliminating poverty and achieving steady growth and \r\nsustainable development. We are all the more \r\nconcerned since the Secretary-General’s report states \r\nthat the recent experience of those countries has shown \r\na tenuous link between economic growth and the \r\nmitigation of poverty and that the limited data \r\navailable on recent trends in the rate of poverty in the \r\nLDCs indicate some increase in income poverty. The \r\nreport defines LDCs as those countries with a \r\ndwindling prospect of achieving the goal of halving \r\npoverty by the year 2015. \r\n While my delegation welcomes the partial \r\nimprovement in the flow of official development \r\nassistance (ODA) to the LDCs and initiatives to \r\nenhance access for the LDCs to the global markets, it \r\nbelieves that this improvement will remain limited in \r\nview of the continued small share of these countries in \r\nworld trade, the weak flow of foreign direct investment \r\nand excessive reliance on basic commodities. My \r\ndelegation believes in the importance of the \r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action for the \r\nLDCs, the commitments included in the 2005 World \r\nSummit Outcome (resolution 60/1), the Millennium \r\nDeclaration, the Monterrey Consensus and the Doha \r\nDevelopment Round. \r\n The State of Qatar has always sought to be a \r\nsupportive partner of the LDCs in their efforts to \r\ncombat poverty and distribute the fruits of global \r\ngrowth fairly and more equitably. \r\n We had the honour of hosting, at the end of 2001, \r\nthe fourth ministerial conference of the World Trade \r\nOrganization, which adopted the Doha Programme of \r\nAction. In 2005, we hosted the second South Summit, \r\nat which Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, Emir of \r\nQatar, introduced an initiative to establish the Doha \r\nFund for Development and Humanitarian Assistance. \r\nThe least developed countries will be the largest \r\nbeneficiaries of that Fund. Qatar also affirmed its \r\ncommitment to the agreed rate of its gross national \r\nproduct for development assistance, 15 per cent of \r\nwhich is devoted to the least developed countries as of \r\n2006. \r\n In conclusion, we hope that the international \r\ncommunity and all of its agencies and organizations \r\nwill uphold the commitment to grant effective \r\nassistance to the least developed countries in support of \r\ntheir development efforts. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the floor to the representative of the Russian \r\nFederation, His Excellency Mr. Nikolay Chulkov. \r\n Mr. Chulkov (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): I am speaking on behalf of the head of the \r\nRussian delegation, Mr. Vitaly Churkin. \r\n The Brussels Programme of Action remains fully \r\nrelevant for the global development agenda. The \r\nimplementation of the Programme should remain a \r\nhigh priority for the international community. The \r\ngoals set by the Brussels Programme of Action should \r\nbe incorporated by the least developed countries \r\n(LDCs) into their national development strategies. The \r\nsteps and initiatives of the LDCs themselves should be \r\nsupported. \r\n The Strategy adopted at the Cotonou Ministerial \r\nConference of LDCs is a very important document and \r\nreflects the approaches taken by this group of countries \r\nin the implementation of the Brussels Programme of \r\nAction. We therefore believe that that careful attention \r\nshould be given to that Strategy. \r\nA/61/PV.8  \r\n \r\n06-52565 52 \r\n \r\n Poverty eradication and marginalization of the \r\nLDCs in this era of globalization have become \r\nparticularly important issues, which cannot be resolved \r\nunless all countries and international organizations are \r\nunited in their efforts. Cooperation must therefore be \r\nexpanded under the auspices of the United Nations, \r\nwhich must also play a coordinating role. \r\n For its part, the Russian Federation is taking \r\nconcrete steps to further the development of LDCs. \r\nWith regard to goods produced by the least developed \r\ncountries, we are not posing quantitative limits on \r\nimports or considering the imposition of anti-dumping \r\nor preferential measures. \r\n We welcome the fact that some countries have \r\nestablished trade terms based on comparative \r\nadvantage for the least developed countries in response \r\nto the appeal made at the Millennium Summit. Russia \r\nis participating in the World Bank programme to write \r\noff all the debt owed by the poorest countries to \r\ninternational financial institutions and in the \r\nimplementation of the International Monetary Fund’s \r\ndecision to cancel $4.8 billion of debt owed by 19 \r\ncountries. \r\n Russia is also writing off the debt of the poorest \r\ncountries on a bilateral basis. In 2005, it cancelled \r\n$2.2 billion in debt owed by African countries, which \r\nis equal to 0.29 per cent of our gross domestic product. \r\nThe federal budget for 2006 provides for the possibility \r\nof writing off 100 per cent of the debt owed to Russia \r\nby the poorest countries. Currently, this debt, owed by \r\n16 countries, including countries in Africa, amounts to \r\n$688 million. \r\n In providing debt relief to the poorest countries, \r\nRussia attaches great importance to ensuring that the \r\nfunds designated for debt repayment in the indebted \r\ncountries are used for development in those countries. \r\nWe also believe that debt cancellation without effective \r\nfinancial, economic and budgetary policies, structural \r\nreform, the strengthening of governmental institutions \r\nand the improvement of the investment climate in the \r\npoorest countries will not bring about the desired \r\nresults. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to underline the \r\nimportance of ensuring effective mechanisms for \r\nmonitoring and assessing the implementation of the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action, and support in this \r\nconnection the draft Declaration to be adopted at the \r\nend of our Meeting. In our view, this consensus \r\ndocument takes into account the various aspects of the \r\ninternational community’s concerns regarding issues \r\naffecting the least developed countries, reflects the \r\ncommitment of Member States to cooperate in the \r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action, provides \r\nan objective assessment of our achievements and of the \r\nproblems that we are encountering in the course of its \r\nimplementation and directs the international \r\ncommunity towards further concerted efforts in this \r\nfield. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I give \r\nthe floor to His Excellency Mr. Anders Lidén, \r\nchairman of the delegation of Sweden. \r\n Mr. Lidén (Sweden): My delegation fully aligns \r\nitself with the statement made earlier by the \r\nrepresentative of Finland on behalf of the European \r\nUnion (EU). In particular, I would like to reaffirm my \r\ncountry’s full commitment to the implementation of the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action. Clearly, the challenges \r\nfacing the least developed countries must be addressed \r\nin partnership between rich and poor countries. The \r\nCotonou Strategy provides valuable input in this \r\nregard. \r\n I would like to add to the EU statement a few \r\ncomments relating to Sweden’s contribution to efforts \r\nto eradicate poverty, as well as some themes that my \r\ndelegation believes are of importance to the \r\ndevelopment of the least developed countries. \r\n The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) lie \r\nat the heart of Swedish development cooperation and \r\ngo hand in hand with our commitment to implement \r\nthe Brussels Programme of Action. The second report \r\non Sweden’s support for the achievement of the MDGs \r\nhas just been released. The report establishes that \r\nSwedish development assistance in 2006 will reach 1 \r\nper cent of its gross national income. Priority is given \r\nto the least developed countries in the allocation of that \r\nassistance. The report is available in this Hall. \r\n The High-level Panel on United Nations System-\r\nwide Coherence in the Areas of Development, \r\nHumanitarian Assistance and the Environment provides \r\na unique opportunity to revitalize the support of the \r\nUnited Nations to the developing countries. If the \r\nUnited Nations can rise to the challenge of reform and \r\nbecome more effective at the country level, it will be \r\nable to mobilize more development resources and \r\nensure that more of its resources can reach the \r\ncountries in need. The least developed countries would \r\n A/61/PV.8\r\n \r\n53 06-52565 \r\n \r\nbe the primary beneficiaries in this scenario. Sweden \r\nwill contribute to a constructive and fruitful \r\nconsideration of the Panel’s recommendations. \r\n Income differences between the richest and the \r\npoorest countries, as well as within countries, have \r\ngrown over the past 10 years. Widespread and \r\nprofound income inequality is not only morally unjust, \r\nit is also inefficient. Economic growth is a \r\nnecessary — although not a sufficient — condition for \r\na substantial and long-lasting reduction of income \r\npoverty. What we need is pro-poor growth. The focus \r\nshould be on establishing an environment that is \r\nconducive to the creation of decent and productive jobs \r\nfor poor people. This will, in turn, be a driver of \r\ngrowth. \r\n Sweden strongly believes that the issue of \r\nmigration and development should be on the agenda \r\nfor discussions about how the situation in the least \r\ndeveloped countries can be improved. We must \r\nacknowledge and build on the positive aspects of \r\ninternational migration. As was emphasized by many \r\ndelegations at the High-level Dialogue on International \r\nMigration and Development a few days ago, the role of \r\nthe diaspora, including remittances and returning \r\nmigrants who put new skills and experiences at the \r\nservice of their countries of origin, can have a \r\nsignificant positive impact on poverty reduction and \r\ndevelopment in the least developed countries. Having \r\nsaid that, however, we must keep in mind that \r\nremittances are private money and should not be seen \r\nas a substitute for official development assistance. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the floor to Her Excellency Ms. Fauzya Moore, \r\nthe representative of Canada. \r\n Ms. Moore (Canada): I am delivering this \r\nstatement on behalf of the chair of my delegation, who \r\nhas been regrettably delayed. \r\n Canadians care about bridging the enormous gaps \r\nin income, health, education and quality of life that \r\nexist in our interdependent world. Our compassion for \r\npeople living in poverty is a reflection of the values we \r\ncherish: humanitarianism, freedom, democracy, the \r\nrule of law and respect for human rights. \r\n The challenges facing the least developed \r\ncountries (LDCs) are of concern to Canada. We \r\nwelcome the opportunity to express our views on the \r\nimplementation of the Brussels Programme of Action. \r\nIn the five years since the Programme of Action was \r\nadopted, much has been done. There has been progress \r\nin some least developed countries. At the same time, \r\nmuch remains to be done, and many least developed \r\ncountries remain in grave difficulty. We acknowledge \r\nthat least developed countries have striven to create the \r\nbest possible environment for growth, development and \r\npoverty reduction. We appreciate the assessment by \r\nleast developed countries, in the Cotonou Strategy, of \r\nthe successes and failures of implementation. \r\n Canada, like other development partners, has \r\nmobilized in response to the Programme of Action. An \r\nunprecedented level of our development assistance \r\nnow goes to the LDCs; we have improved market \r\naccess; imports from LDCs have recently tripled; and \r\nwe have accelerated debt relief in support of the least \r\ndeveloped countries. \r\n Canada continues to focus its assistance on \r\nsectors that directly support the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) and are of primary \r\nconcern to the least developed countries: good \r\ngovernance, including freedom, democracy and human \r\nrights; basic education; health, including HIV/AIDS; \r\nprivate-sector development; environmental \r\nsustainability; and gender equality. Canadians have \r\ncontributed across a spectrum of Programme of Action \r\ncommitments. When developing our country \r\nprogramming frameworks, we support people-centred \r\ndevelopment through consultations with Governments, \r\ncivil society, business and people living in poverty. \r\nCanadians are working and sometimes dying beside \r\nour brothers and sisters in particularly fragile \r\ncountries, for example, Afghanistan and Haiti. We are \r\nactively engaged in aid-for-trade initiatives and the \r\nIntegrated Framework for trade-related technical \r\nassistance. We regret the suspension of talks of the \r\nDoha development round. We look forward to their \r\nspeedy resumption as the best way to promote trade as \r\na tool for development in least developed countries. \r\n Despite our collective efforts and renewed sense \r\nof partnership, there is much room for improvement. \r\nMy Government is particularly concerned with aid \r\neffectiveness, ensuring that development partners work \r\ntogether with developing countries to get the best \r\npossible bang for the development buck. Further \r\nprogress will also depend on countries developing the \r\nright governance structures to facilitate private-sector \r\ndevelopment and sufficient respect for human rights \r\nA/61/PV.8  \r\n \r\n06-52565 54 \r\n \r\nand democracy to build confidence in their \r\nGovernments. \r\n In conclusion, results have not been as rapid or \r\npredictable as we would like them to be, but such \r\nresults will come with the determined implementation \r\nof the Brussels Programme of Action. It is for that \r\nreason that we must continue and accelerate our efforts \r\ntowards the successful outcome of the Programme of \r\nAction. We welcome the draft declaration (A/61/L.2) \r\nas a positive step on the road to furthering the \r\nProgramme of Action and look forward in 2011 to \r\nreports of greater progress in the least developed \r\ncountries. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Robert Hill, \r\nchairman of the delegation of Australia. \r\n Mr. Hill (Australia): Australia recognizes that \r\nlong-term engagement, coupled with partner \r\nGovernment commitment, is essential to ensuring that \r\nleast developed countries (LDCs) make demonstrable \r\nprogress towards reducing poverty and achieving \r\nsustainable development. Australia is proud of the \r\ncontribution it makes to the international effort to \r\nassist LDCs. We strongly support the coordinated \r\nimplementation of the Brussels Programme of Action. \r\nIn 2004-05, 22 per cent of Australia’s total official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) went to least developed \r\ncountries. \r\n Through its historical ties and ongoing trade, \r\ndefence and other links, Australia has a special \r\nrelationship with the Asia region and, in particular, the \r\nPacific region. The Asia-Pacific region contains more \r\nthan a quarter of the world’s LDCs. That region is the \r\nfocus of Australia’s development assistance activities. \r\nOur key objectives in the region are to help accelerate \r\neconomic growth, foster functioning and effective \r\nStates, invest in people and promote regional stability \r\nand cooperation. We work closely with our partners in \r\nthe region to support their own sustainable \r\ndevelopment efforts. For example, we are working with \r\nKiribati to strengthen public-sector management, with \r\nCambodia to increase the incomes of the rural poor, \r\nand with Bangladesh to improve food security. \r\n But ODA on its own will never be enough. \r\nUltimately, poverty reduction will be driven by \r\neconomic growth, led by the private sector, and \r\nachieved through integration with the global economy. \r\nAs part of our broader development assistance \r\nprogrammes, Australia is therefore assisting LDCs to \r\ntake advantage of opportunities arising from trade \r\nliberalization, including through the Doha round and \r\naid-for-trade initiatives. \r\n Since July 2003, Australia has provided duty-free \r\nand quota-free access for imports of all products from \r\nall LDCs, with no phase-in periods or exceptions. We \r\nhave encouraged other countries to match that level of \r\naccess. We are also working within the World Trade \r\nOrganization (WTO) to assist LDCs in building their \r\ntrade-related capacities to implement and benefit from \r\nWTO agreements. Australia is also committed to \r\nproviding targeted debt relief to assist countries’ \r\ndevelopment. In particular, Australia contributed \r\n136.2 million Australian dollars to the International \r\nDevelopment Association in 2006-07, to finance \r\nAustralia’s share of the first 10 years of the Group of \r\nEight’s Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative. \r\n Australia looks forward to continuing its \r\nproductive work with its development partners in the \r\nAsia-Pacific region and beyond, to find practical, \r\nworkable solutions to their development challenges. \r\nWe remain committed to making a substantial \r\ncontribution to the coordinated implementation of the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action for the Least Developed \r\nCountries, in turn reducing poverty and making \r\nprogress towards achieving sustainable development \r\nfor all. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the floor to Her Excellency Mrs. Lucia Maierá, \r\nchairperson of the delegation of Brazil. \r\n Mrs. Maierá (Brazil): I would like to associate \r\nthe Brazilian delegation with the statements made by \r\nthe Minister for Foreign Affairs of South Africa on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China, and by the \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Guyana on behalf of the \r\nRio Group. \r\n For the Brazilian Government, the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action for the Least Developed \r\nCountries continues to have unique significance. We \r\nare convinced that no international order can be \r\nlabelled fair and just as long as the situation of this \r\nmost vulnerable group of countries is not significantly \r\nimproved. Brazil also deems the Cotonou Strategy an \r\nimportant contribution to the framework of national \r\nand international initiatives in support of the \r\ndevelopment strategies of the least developed countries \r\n(LDCs). \r\n A/61/PV.8\r\n \r\n55 06-52565 \r\n \r\n Although it is not a donor country, Brazil has \r\nadopted a set of measures and policies closely aligned \r\nwith the provisions set out in the Brussels Programme \r\nof Action. I wish to take this opportunity to emphasize \r\nthat the least-developed-country dimension is also \r\npresent within our own country, because, unfortunately, \r\nmore than 30 million of our citizens remain below the \r\npoverty line. \r\n Brazil is engaged in bilateral cooperation \r\nagreements and projects with least developed countries \r\nfrom all developing regions of the world: Haiti, Cape \r\nVerde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Sao Tome and \r\nPrincipe, Timor-Leste and Afghanistan, to name but a \r\nfew. Those agreements and projects encompass such \r\ndiverse areas as institutional capacity-building, justice, \r\ngovernance, education, health, agriculture, science and \r\ntechnology and professional training. \r\n Brazil is also actively participating in \r\ninternational initiatives in support of least developed \r\ncountries. The IBSA Facility for Poverty and Hunger \r\nAlleviation, established by Brazil, India and South \r\nAfrica, is financing projects currently under way in \r\nGuinea-Bissau and Haiti. Another project sponsored by \r\nBrazil, the International Drug Purchase Facility \r\n(UNITAID), will be officially launched tomorrow \r\nafternoon here at the United Nations. Created in the \r\ncontext of the Action against Hunger and Poverty \r\ninitiative launched by Presidents Lula, Chirac and \r\nLagos and Secretary-General Kofi Annan, UNITAID \r\nwill provide financial resources for the treatment of the \r\nthree most serious diseases affecting developing \r\ncountries, particularly LDCs: AIDS, malaria and \r\ntuberculosis. In addition, bearing in mind the constant \r\ndrain on the limited resources of LDCs caused by the \r\nheavy external debt imposed on them, Brazil, despite \r\nits limitations, has already provided significant debt \r\nrelief for seven African LDCs. \r\n It is our firm belief that much remains to be done \r\nat the international level under the Brussels Programme \r\nof Action and towards the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals by the LDCs. The \r\nBrazilian Government is of the view that long-lasting \r\neconomic growth and human development in LDCs \r\ndepend not only on greater effectiveness in \r\ninternational cooperation, but also — and especially — \r\non structural changes in international trade. \r\n The World Trade Organization (WTO) ministerial \r\ndecision, adopted at Hong Kong, to provide duty-free \r\nand quota-free market access for LDCs should be made \r\noperational. Our Government has already started \r\ninternal consultations with the private sector to work \r\nout the details related to implementing that initiative. \r\nOnce it is put into practice, 32 LDCs that are WTO \r\nmembers are expected to benefit from facilitated access \r\nto the Brazilian market for their exports. \r\n However, broader and much more in-depth \r\nactions and considerable changes are required to \r\nimprove the multilateral trading system. Brazil deeply \r\nregrets that the WTO Doha Development Agenda \r\nnegotiations have been suspended. We consider that to \r\nbe a setback for a round focusing on development and \r\nagriculture. We call for a prompt resumption of the \r\nnegotiations with a view to arriving at commitments \r\nthat are ambitious, balanced and faithful to the \r\ndevelopment dimension of the Doha round. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the floor to Her Excellency Mrs. Manuela Fereira \r\nof the Portuguese Institute for Development \r\nAssistance, Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Portugal. \r\n Mrs. Fereira (Portugal): It is an honour for me to \r\naddress the General Assembly on behalf of the \r\nPortuguese Government on such an important issue as \r\nthe midterm comprehensive global review of the \r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action for the \r\nLeast Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010. \r\n We align ourselves with the statement made by \r\nthe representative of Finland on behalf of the European \r\nUnion. We thank the Secretary-General for his report \r\non the implementation of the Programme of Action \r\n(A/61/173), which provides valuable input regarding \r\nthe midterm comprehensive global review. \r\n Since the adoption of the Programme of Action, \r\nmany changes have occurred at the national, regional \r\nand global levels. Many of them have drawn our \r\nattention to new realities: new or unexpected threats to \r\nglobal peace, prosperity and development, such as \r\nconflicts, civil unrest, natural disasters, massive illegal \r\nmigration and terrorism. Other, more encouraging, \r\nchanges have revealed positive developments, thus \r\nrenewing our hope that, through coordinated efforts to \r\nachieve concrete goals and objectives, we can reduce \r\nand even overcome poverty, deprivation, vulnerability, \r\nfragility and instability. \r\n In response to the challenges posed by the \r\nrealities I have mentioned, various important summits \r\nA/61/PV.8  \r\n \r\n06-52565 56 \r\n \r\nand conferences have taken place since the adoption of \r\nthe Brussels Programme of Action, including the 2005 \r\nWorld Summit, whose Outcome (resolution 60/1) sets \r\nout for us a broad and comprehensive approach to \r\nthese issues, including through the integration of \r\npeace, security, development and human rights. \r\n Portugal reaffirms its commitment to the \r\nimplementation of the Brussels Programme of Action. \r\nThe Programme, despite the fact that it was adopted in \r\n2001, continues to provide the framework for joint \r\nefforts to appropriately address the special needs of the \r\nleast developed countries (LDCs). \r\n We welcome the encouraging developments in \r\nLDCs and the fact that economic growth in those \r\ncountries as a group has nearly reached the target of \r\n7 per cent, as a result of the implementation of \r\nmacroeconomic reforms as well as improved \r\nmanagement and governance. We do, however, \r\nrecognize that the results achieved so far are uneven, \r\nboth between countries and within countries, and that \r\nmuch more must be done to make further progress in \r\nimplementing the Brussels Programme of Action and \r\nensuring equitable social development in which the \r\nmost vulnerable sectors of the population have access \r\nto such gains. \r\n We should thus make further efforts to build more \r\ncoordinated and coherent partnerships, while \r\nemphasizing that the main responsibility lies with the \r\ncountries themselves. But it is important to note that \r\nthe differences among the results achieved in various \r\ncountries reflect the differences among LDCs, thus \r\nrequiring different and contextualized approaches. \r\n In that regard, we would also like to make a \r\nparticular reference to fragile States. Although ending \r\nthe cycles of poverty and insecurity in fragile States \r\nshould be carried out primarily by national \r\nGovernments, international actors can also affect \r\noutcomes in such countries in both positive and \r\nnegative ways. Therefore, agreed principles for \r\nappropriate international engagement in fragile \r\ncountries could help to maximize the positive impact \r\nof engagement. \r\n The donor community should enhance its \r\nresponse in order to meet the needs of these countries, \r\nespecially by improving flexibility and providing \r\nadequate responses that take into consideration the \r\nthree D’s: diplomacy, defence and development. That is \r\na challenge to be addressed by the international \r\ncommunity, which should be prepared to take greater \r\nrisks and to tackle the problem of AIDS orphans. \r\n The main goals of the new strategy for \r\nPortuguese cooperation are to reduce poverty, achieve \r\nsustainable development and meet the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, in particular in Africa. \r\nInstitutional and human capacity-building, the rule of \r\nlaw, respect for human rights, good governance and the \r\npromotion of democracy are at the heart of Portuguese \r\ncooperation. That makes the Programme of Action a \r\ncrucial framework for our strategy with our \r\ndevelopment partners: a limited number of countries, \r\nall of them LDCs. \r\n Allow me to congratulate Cape Verde, one of our \r\nmain partners, as well as Maldives, both of which are \r\ngoing to be graduated from the list of LDCs following \r\na smooth transition period. We fully agree with the \r\nreference in the Secretary-General’s report to the \r\npossibility that such countries might need to continue \r\nto receive international support in order to sustain and \r\nfurther their achievements. \r\n It is a privilege to say that, in the period under \r\nreview, Portugal was included in the list of top bilateral \r\ndonors, in terms of percentage of aid to LDCs. Portugal \r\nalso fully supports multilateral initiatives aimed at \r\nassisting the poorest countries, such as those of the \r\nenhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative \r\nand the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative. \r\n We would like to reiterate our commitment to the \r\nleast developed countries. We are confident that better \r\nresults will be achieved during the next five-year \r\nperiod of the Programme of Action. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Aly Diane, \r\nchairman of the delegation of Guinea. \r\n Mr. Diane (Guinea) (spoke in French): It is a \r\ngreat pleasure for my delegation, which I have the \r\nhonour to lead, to take part in the High-level Meeting \r\non the midterm review of the Brussels Programme of \r\nAction for the Least Developed Countries for the \r\nDecade 2001-2010. \r\n At the outset, I would like to say that my \r\ndelegation fully endorses the statements delivered by \r\nthe representatives of South Africa and Benin on behalf \r\nof the Group of 77 and China and the group of Least \r\nDeveloped Countries, respectively. \r\n A/61/PV.8\r\n \r\n57 06-52565 \r\n \r\n My country attaches the greatest importance to \r\nthis meeting, as the question of the least developed \r\ncountries (LDCs) is among our main concerns. We \r\ncontinue to be resolutely committed to the attainment \r\nof the goals set out in the Programme of Action. Five \r\nyears following the adoption of that important \r\ninitiative, it is up to us to assess exactly what has been \r\nachieved by evaluating in detail the progress made and \r\nthe obstacles encountered in the implementation of the \r\nProgramme, so as to ascertain the efforts required to \r\nreach the main goal of eradicating entrenched poverty \r\nin the least developed countries. \r\n In that connection, my delegation welcomes the \r\nefforts made by our countries, especially as regards \r\ndomestic reform and governance. We duly appreciate \r\nthe considerable results achieved by our development \r\npartners in the areas of increased development \r\nassistance and debt relief. However, we must \r\nacknowledge that, as of this midterm review, results \r\nhave fallen well short of expectations. In the last five \r\nyears, poverty has increased in most LDCs, despite the \r\ncommitment of our Governments to place poverty at \r\nthe heart of our development policies and strategies. \r\n Given current trends, it is increasingly clear that \r\nrealizing the worthy aspirations of the millions of \r\npeople with an interest in the Programme of Action \r\ncould remain wishful thinking unless bold steps are \r\ntaken. In order to reverse those trends, therefore, we \r\nneed unified, collective efforts on the part of the entire \r\ninternational community more than ever before. Of \r\ncourse, least developed countries, with the assistance \r\nof their development partners, must intensify their \r\nefforts to enhance the effectiveness of these actions. \r\n The Republic of Guinea remains convinced that, \r\nnotwithstanding the shared responsibility to which I \r\nhave referred, we, the LDCs continue to be primarily \r\nresponsible for our own development. Among other \r\nthings, we should work tirelessly and intensify our \r\nefforts to build on our achievements in areas such as \r\ngood governance, promoting the rule of law, combating \r\ncorruption, ensuring the effective participation of our \r\npeoples in the decision-making process at all levels and \r\npromoting gender equality. \r\n We therefore appeal to all of our development \r\npartners, including in the context of South-South \r\ncooperation, to continue to offer their support to LDCs. \r\nIn particular, we urge all donor countries to honour \r\ntheir recent commitments to increase the volume and \r\nquality of official development assistance (ODA). We \r\ntake this opportunity to express our deep gratitude to \r\nthe countries that have reached the goal of contributing \r\n0.15 to 0.2 per cent of their gross national income to \r\nODA for least developed countries. \r\n In addition to increasing the volume of aid, we \r\nurge our partners to redouble their efforts to reduce the \r\nforeign debt of our countries, which is destroying our \r\nhopes of re-energizing our economic development. \r\nLikewise, we call for the lifting of barriers to exports, \r\nso as to allow our economies to break free of their \r\nmarginalization in this era of globalization. \r\n I cannot fail to mention the United Nations \r\nsystem, which should buttress its support for LDCs, in \r\nparticular by improving its own effectiveness through \r\ngreater coordination of its activities. In addition to its \r\nefforts in the area of deploying resources, the \r\nOrganization should contribute to the development and \r\nimplementation of national poverty reduction strategies \r\nthat are better geared towards achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. \r\n My own country’s case should spur the \r\ninternational community into action. Like other LDCs, \r\nand aware that every country is primarily responsible \r\nfor its own development, in 2002, following more than \r\na year of broadly participatory preparations, the \r\nRepublic of Guinea adopted its first Poverty Reduction \r\nStrategy Paper. The document covers the period 2002 \r\nto 2005, and sets out priority actions to be carried out \r\nin order to promote the poverty reduction process. \r\n Aware of the difficulties encountered in \r\nimplementing that document, our Government has \r\nworked with its partners to develop a second such \r\npaper geared towards meeting the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and taking into account the \r\ncommitments entered into in the Brussels Programme \r\nof Action. In carrying out our strategy, we will initiate \r\nmajor projects and programmes aimed at achieving \r\nequality; improving governance; strengthening human \r\nand institutional capacity in such priority areas as \r\neducation, health and integrated rural development; \r\nand the building of infrastructure. \r\n To a large extent, the success of those initiatives \r\nwill depend upon the support of the international \r\ncommunity, and especially upon increasing the volume \r\nand quality of assistance and, most important, the \r\nalleviation of the debt burden, which today consumes \r\n50 per cent of our domestic income. \r\nA/61/PV.8  \r\n \r\n06-52565 58 \r\n \r\n The Republic of Guinea urges the international \r\ncommunity to energetically commit itself to \r\nimplementing the Brussels Programme of Action. In \r\norder to do that, it is crucial that all concerned take up \r\ntheir share of responsibility under the joint \r\ncommitments undertaken in 2001. For their part, \r\nLDCs, following a lengthy process, recently adopted \r\nthe Cotonou Strategy at a meeting in Benin. We believe \r\nthat it will lend new impetus to the implementation of \r\nthe Programme of Action. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. José Alberto Briz \r\nGutiérrez, Chairman of the delegation of Guatemala. \r\n Mr. Briz Gutiérrez (Guatemala) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): We believe that it is essential to review the \r\nprogress made in providing assistance to least \r\ndeveloped countries (LDCs), so as to be able to address \r\ntheir needs more effectively in the five remaining years \r\nof the Brussels Programme of Action. \r\n We are grateful for the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral (A/61/173) on this matter, as well as for the \r\npreparatory meetings that were aimed at ensuring the \r\nsuccess of the midterm review. The review is a way of \r\nstrengthening our approach to this endeavour. We \r\nacknowledge the fact that the Cotonou Strategy and the \r\nreport of the Secretary-General both enrich the work of \r\nthis High-level Meeting by describing the major \r\nchallenges to be overcome and providing positive \r\nsuggestions. \r\n Guatemala would like to associate itself with the \r\nstatements delivered by the representatives of South \r\nAfrica and Guyana on behalf of the Group of 77 and \r\nChina and the Rio Group, respectively. \r\nMr. Penjo (Bhutan), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n We want to congratulate the least developed \r\ncountries for their efforts and achievements in the first \r\nfive years of the Brussels Programme of Action. My \r\ndelegation nevertheless acknowledges that there is still \r\nmuch work to be done. We are united with LDCs in \r\ntheir struggle to achieve sustainable development and \r\neradicate poverty. We believe that fulfilling the seven \r\ncommitments contained in the Brussels Programme of \r\nAction is the best way to ensure that LDCs can reach \r\ntheir goals. We acknowledge the value of the Cotonou \r\nStrategy — a useful tool that includes priorities set by \r\nthe LDCs themselves — as a positive input that can \r\nenrich the Programme of Action. \r\n We believe it a matter of urgency that the \r\ninternational community lend its support to meeting the \r\ngoals of the Programme of Action. Guatemala joins the \r\nappeal for redoubled efforts to continue the work that \r\nis under way. In that connection, we emphasize the \r\nurgent need for better statistics and indicators to enable \r\nus to more clearly understand the current situation. \r\nThey can be used as a springboard for improving our \r\nfuture efforts. \r\n We also recall the importance of dialogue \r\nbetween LDCs and their development partners. In that \r\nconnection, we must not underestimate the value of \r\nnational development plans. Every development \r\nstrategy being pursued should be part of the national \r\npriorities of LDCs in order to ensure that it enjoys \r\nsupport and is duly implemented. \r\n Similarly, we would like to underscore the \r\nimportance to LDCs of financial resources and \r\ntechnical and capacity-building assistance from the \r\ninternational community, including, as appropriate, \r\nreducing or cancelling foreign debt. We call for \r\nfulfilment of the commitments to provide official \r\ndevelopment assistance to LDCs. It is our hope that the \r\ndocuments prepared for this Meeting will contribute to \r\nmore appropriately channelling those resources. \r\n My country shares many characteristics with least \r\ndeveloped countries, which I now wish to point out. \r\n First, the devastation frequently caused by \r\nhurricanes, landslides and other natural disasters in the \r\nCentral American region makes it possible for us to \r\nunderstand the environmental risk faced by LDCs. We \r\nacknowledge that preserving the environment is a joint \r\nresponsibility. Given the particular vulnerability of \r\nsome LDCs, we urge the international community to \r\nsupport those countries in their efforts to adapt to \r\nclimate change. \r\n Secondly, we sympathize with the need of LDCs \r\nfor agricultural and rural development, given that \r\n72 per cent of their populations live in agriculture-\r\ndependent rural areas. We would therefore like to \r\nunderscore the value of state-of-the-art technology \r\ntransfers to LDCs. We also acknowledge the value of \r\nSouth-South cooperation and of improving \r\ninfrastructure and productive capacities. In that \r\nconnection, we would also like to emphasize the need \r\n A/61/PV.8\r\n \r\n59 06-52565 \r\n \r\nto support small and medium-sized business. We also \r\nappreciate the cooperation with the business \r\ncommunity. \r\n Thirdly, we share the concerns about the \r\nsubsidies given by developed countries to their \r\nfarmers. As a member of the Group of Twenty, \r\nGuatemala continues to be part of the struggle taking \r\nplace in the commercial sector on behalf of \r\npredominantly agriculture-dependent countries. We call \r\nfor the elimination of all obstacles to international \r\ntrade. \r\n Fourthly, as a country that has emerged from a \r\nlong conflict, we urge LDCs currently experiencing \r\ninternal conflict to pursue their efforts — with the \r\nsupport of the international community — to establish \r\na culture of peace through reconciliation, confidence-\r\nbuilding and peaceful conflict resolution. \r\n Guatemala also acknowledges the great challenge \r\nwe all face in meeting the Millennium Development \r\nGoals, especially with regard to eradicating poverty \r\nand hunger. We believe that is a major commitment \r\nthat should always figure on the international agenda. \r\n It is of course up to each country to work towards \r\nits own development and the well-being of its people. \r\nBut it is clear that we cannot close our eyes to the \r\nneeds of our fellow human beings in the least \r\ndeveloped countries. We hope that this review will help \r\nus to meet the seven commitments of the Programme \r\nof Action and orient our efforts to better support those \r\ncountries. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Llanio González Pérez, chairman \r\nof the delegation of Cuba. \r\n Mr. González Pérez (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThe delegation of Cuba would like to associate itself \r\nwith the statement delivered by the representative of \r\nSouth Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. I \r\nwould like to take this opportunity to make some \r\nremarks on this important issue. \r\n More than 30 years after the United Nations \r\nrecognized least developed countries (LDCs) as a \r\ngroup, and more than five years since the adoption of \r\nthe Brussels Programme of Action — intended to halve \r\nthe extreme poverty from which that group of countries \r\nsuffers — the economic, financial and social situation \r\nof LDCs continues to be critical. Not only has the \r\nnumber of LDCs doubled — from 24 in 1971 to 50 \r\ntoday — they have become more marginalized in the \r\ninternational marketplace and grown more \r\neconomically dependent, while their capacity to \r\nformulate and implement development policies and \r\nstrategies has decreased even further. \r\n While some developed countries try to hide the \r\ntraumatic situation of the LDCs, the severe economic \r\nproblems of those countries continue to expand at an \r\nalarming rate — added to which are armed conflicts, \r\nsocial tensions, natural disasters, diseases and \r\nstaggering illiteracy rates. Accounting for a little over \r\n11 per cent of the world’s population, those countries \r\ngenerate barely 0.6 per cent of world exports. Far from \r\ndecreasing, their external debt burden has continued to \r\ngrow, and has now reached unprecedented levels. \r\nAccording to The Least Development Countries Report \r\n2006 of the United Nations Conference on Trade and \r\nDevelopment, the total debt burden of LDCs has now \r\nreached the astronomical amount of $158.9 billion, \r\nwhich is $20.8 billion greater than it was in 2001. \r\n Real per capita gross domestic product grew only \r\n0.72 per cent between 1980 and 2003, which is very \r\nlow vis-à-vis the growth rate required to reduce \r\npoverty. While some indicators show a degree of \r\ngrowth in official development assistance rates during \r\nthe 1999-2004 period, this was due to donations in the \r\nform of external debt cancellation and emergency aid, \r\nwhich is why in actual terms net official development \r\nassistance came to a standstill or was reduced in almost \r\nhalf of the LDCs. \r\n As the data show, outcomes for LDCs are \r\ndisappointing. However, many developed countries \r\ncontinue to demonstrate a lack of political will in \r\nmeeting their commitments and impose conditionalities \r\nfor the implementation of their initiatives. At the same \r\ntime that they would have us believe that the primary \r\nresponsibility for underdevelopment and poverty lies in \r\nthe LDCs themselves as a result of the weakness of \r\ntheir markets, development policies and institutions, \r\nthey are also continuing to increase their demands and \r\nconditionalities in order to induce LDCs to give up \r\ntheir sovereign right to decide on their own economic \r\nand development policies. \r\n Developed countries have an obligation, as allies \r\nin development, to contribute to coordinating efforts in \r\nfavour of LDCs. It is necessary and crucial to \r\ndemonstrate that political will and not attempt to evade \r\nresponsibility. \r\nA/61/PV.8  \r\n \r\n06-52565 60 \r\n \r\n Despite the serious problems we face and the fact \r\nthat we have been subject to a brutal and cruel \r\nblockade, my country has developed, and continues to \r\ncarry out, a broad cooperation programme with several \r\nLDCs in Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa and \r\nAsia. Our efforts are focused in the areas of health \r\ncare, education, sports, agriculture and fishing, among \r\nothers. To cite just one example of that programme, a \r\nsignificant number of the more than 29,000 health \r\nprofessionals and technicians that Cuba has sent abroad \r\non medical cooperation programmes are devoting their \r\nefforts to develop programmes to combat AIDS in \r\ncountries with higher levels of prevalence and spread \r\nof the disease, among which there are several LDCs. \r\nLikewise, Cuba has offered as assistance to African \r\ncountries most affected by AIDS 4,000 doctors and \r\nhealth personnel, the professors needed to create 20 \r\nmedical schools in those countries, and has provided at \r\nno cost much-needed medical equipment and \r\nantiretroviral treatment for 30,000 patients. \r\n We strongly believe that without a radical \r\nredefinition of the current economic and financial \r\nsystem and the principles underpinning it, as well as \r\nstrong political will on the part of the entire \r\ninternational community — and especially by \r\ndeveloped countries — the situation and outcomes for \r\nthe LDCs will continue to be negative, with \r\ndevelopment and poverty reduction in those countries \r\nstill a pipe dream. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Salihu Ahmed-Sambo, chairman of \r\nthe delegation of Nigeria. \r\n Mr. Ahmed-Sambo (Nigeria): Nigeria is pleased \r\nto take part in this High-level Meeting on the midterm \r\nreview of the implementation of the Programme of \r\nAction for the Least Developed Countries for the \r\nDecade 2001-2010. \r\n Let me, at the outset, thank the Secretary-General \r\nfor the report (A/61/173) that he submitted to facilitate \r\nour review. \r\n We also wish to align ourselves with the \r\nstatement delivered by the representative of South \r\nAfrica on behalf of Group of 77 and China. \r\n The Brussels Programme of Action for the Least \r\nDeveloped Countries, which was adopted in 2001, \r\nremains an essential framework for cooperation with, \r\nand support for, the efforts of those disadvantaged \r\ncountries. Half way to the target date of 2010, there are \r\nsome encouraging signs of modest progress made by \r\nthe least developed countries (LDCs) with regard to \r\nsound macroeconomic policies, governance, human \r\nand institutional reform and development of \r\ninfrastructure. There have also been robust efforts to \r\naddress environmental concerns. While those steps are \r\ncommendable, Nigeria recognizes the enormity of the \r\nchallenges LDCs still face. We would also like to stress \r\nthe need for more commitment to realize the objectives \r\nof the Brussels Programme of Action. \r\n Development partners should act quickly to \r\naddress the special needs of the least developed \r\ncountries. In that connection, steps must be taken to fill \r\ntheir resource gaps by targeting efforts to significantly \r\nincrease the volume and quality of official \r\ndevelopment assistance, provide access to markets and \r\nbuild capacity. Furthermore, considering the fact that \r\nagriculture remains the mainstay of the economies of \r\nthe least developed countries, efforts should also be \r\nmade to support rural and agricultural development. \r\nWithout those steps, the projection of the United \r\nNations Conference on Trade and Development that the \r\nnumber of people living in poverty in the LDCs will \r\nincrease from 334 million in 2004 to 471 million in \r\n2010 may well come true. \r\n Nigeria provides support to LDCs, especially in \r\nAfrica, through the channels provided by such regional \r\nand subregional mechanisms as the Economic \r\nCommunity of West African States and the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development. With our \r\nimmediate neighbours in West Africa, we are carrying \r\nout energy and infrastructure development projects \r\naimed at fast-tracking regional integration and \r\nenhancing national capacities. In addition, most \r\nbeneficiaries of our Technical Aid Corps programme, \r\nwhich is administered bilaterally, are least developed \r\ncountries. Therefore, our support to LDCs, and in \r\nparticular for the implementation of the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action, is robust. \r\n I would like to conclude by stressing the need for \r\nthe international community to show greater political \r\nwill and commitment to the goals and objectives of the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action. It is Nigeria’s hope and \r\nexpectation that, when the Assembly reviews progress \r\nin 2010, the story will be that of the fulfilment of \r\ncommitments by all parties. We can ill afford to the \r\ndash the hopes of millions of people who look up to us \r\nfor succour and inspiration. \r\n A/61/PV.8\r\n \r\n61 06-52565 \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Aboubacar Ibrahim Abani, \r\nchairman of the delegation of Niger. \r\n Mr. Abani (Niger) (spoke in French): Allow me, \r\nat the outset, to convey my delegation’s pleasure at \r\nseeing you, Sir, preside over the High-level Meeting on \r\nthe midterm comprehensive review of the \r\nimplementation of the Brussels Programme of Action \r\nfor the Least Developed Countries for the Decade \r\n2001-2010. \r\n In that connection, my delegation would like to \r\nassociate itself with the statement delivered by the \r\nrepresentative of South Africa on behalf of the Group \r\nof 77 and China. That statement eloquently set out our \r\nviews on all the pertinent questions. \r\n The United Nations and the entire international \r\ncommunity have recognized the existence of the \r\ncategory of least developed countries (LDCs) for more \r\nthan 40 years. That group represents the most \r\nvulnerable sector of humankind. LDCs are \r\ncharacterized by extreme poverty and poor capacities, a \r\nsituation often exacerbated by insularity and natural \r\nhazards. The international community has on many \r\noccasions adopted measures aimed at improving the \r\nconditions of LDCs — with little success, as was the \r\ncase with the programmes of action adopted in 1980 \r\nand 1990. In today’s globalized world, the role of \r\nLDCs in the global economy continues to contract. \r\n Faced with the difficult prospects of ongoing \r\nmarginalization, the United Nations found it useful to \r\ntake the bull by the horns and adopt the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action, in 2001, which is based on a \r\npartnership between LDCs and their development \r\npartners. The Programme aroused great hopes that the \r\nparticular problems of LDCs would at last received the \r\nattention they deserved. Unfortunately, five years after \r\nits adoption, the Programme has not been sufficiently \r\nimplemented. \r\n This Meeting has been aptly named, in that it \r\nshould be an opportunity to identify what has not \r\nworked, so that we can take the necessary measures. In \r\nthat connection, I wish to welcome the report of the \r\nSecretary-General on this issue (A/61/173) and the \r\npreparatory work which the LDCs themselves carried \r\nout under the chairmanship of Benin and which bears \r\nthe title “The Cotonou Strategy for the Further \r\nImplementation of the Programme of Action for the \r\nLeast Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010” \r\n(A/61/117, annex I). Those two documents describe the \r\nprogress made and the obstacles encountered and \r\ninclude relevant recommendations for the further \r\nimplementation of the programmes in an effective and \r\nefficient way. They contain clear indications of the \r\nmajor effort made by LDCs in their continuing search \r\nfor development and well-being for their peoples. \r\n The President returned to the Chair. \r\n My country, like other LDCs, has undertaken \r\nmajor economic and institutional reforms and adopted \r\na national poverty reduction strategy, which is \r\ncurrently being updated in line with the \r\nrecommendations of the 2005 World Summit. Several \r\nother actions have been taken to implement the \r\ncommitments through the Programme of Action. \r\nHowever, the results have not always met our \r\nexpectations because of the lack of necessary support. \r\nWe therefore make an urgent appeal to our \r\ndevelopment partners to do more, as promised at the \r\nmajor conferences and summit meetings, particularly \r\nthe Millennium Summit, the Brussels Summit and the \r\nmeetings in Monterrey and Johannesburg. \r\n Here, allow me, Madam President, to sincerely \r\ncongratulate Ambassador Johan Løvald of Norway for \r\nthe skill with which he conducted the work of the \r\npreparatory meeting of experts, which was held from \r\n5 to 7 September 2006. At that meeting, our partners in \r\ngeneral demonstrated goodwill to support the LDCs in \r\na necessary way in order that they should achieve the \r\ndevelopment goals set out in the Brussels Programme \r\nof Action and the Millennium Declaration. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to renew my \r\ndelegation’s sincere wish that this Meeting will take \r\nplace in a spirit of mutual understanding and active \r\nsolidarity and will succeed in adopting an outcome \r\ndocument that reiterates commitments and outlines \r\nmeasures designed to ensure that those commitments \r\nare fulfilled effectively on the basis of real partnership. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I now give the \r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Mohamed El-Mabruk, \r\nchairman of the delegation of the Libyan Arab \r\nJamahiriya. \r\n Mr. El-Mabruk (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke \r\nin Arabic): At the outset, I would like to convey the \r\ngreetings of Mr. Abdel Rahman Mohammed, Secretary \r\nof the People’s Committee for International \r\nCooperation of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, who \r\nA/61/PV.8  \r\n \r\n06-52565 62 \r\n \r\nwould have liked to attend this meeting and deliver this \r\nstatement. He was not able to come. \r\n I wish also to extend to you, Madam President, \r\nhis congratulations on your election to the presidency \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. I \r\nwish you every success in conducting this meeting on a \r\ncomprehensive and objective assessment of the \r\nmidterm comprehensive global review of the \r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action for the \r\nLeast Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010. \r\n We hope to identify the difficulties and \r\nconstraints that prevented many of the least developed \r\ncountries (LDCs) from carrying out an economic and \r\ndevelopment transformation. I would like to express \r\nmy country’s support of the statement of Her \r\nExcellency Ms. Nkosazana C. Dlamini Zuma, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of South Africa, on behalf of the \r\nGroup of 77 and China, and the statement of \r\nMr. Ahmed Aboul Gheit, Foreign Minister of Egypt, on \r\nbehalf of the African Group. \r\n Various studies indicate that in the past few years \r\nthe global economy has seen some healthy growth. \r\nHowever, only a limited number of the LDCs will be \r\nable to achieve the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) by the year 2015. Those goals include \r\nreducing poverty and the number of victims of hunger, \r\nuniversalizing elementary school education, achieving \r\ngender equality, decreasing rates of infant mortality \r\nand fighting the HIV/AIDS epidemic. While some of \r\nthose indicators seem positive and reflect optimism, \r\nothers confirm that a number of LDCs — the majority \r\nof them in Africa — are still far from achieving the \r\nMDGs. If things do not change, those countries will be \r\nunable to achieve the goals and purposes of the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action. That is a cause for \r\nconcern and alarm. \r\n The failure to achieve the goals of that \r\nProgramme of Action cannot be attributed solely to \r\nweaknesses in the economic structure, limited human \r\nand institutional capabilities and failure to mobilize \r\nresources at the local level. It is also the direct result of \r\nthe modest response of the international community to \r\nthe challenges that LDCs face. This has prevented them \r\nfrom carrying out effective economic and \r\ndevelopmental transformation in various fields. \r\n Therefore, it is our view that the responsibility of \r\nthe international community to the LDCs lies in \r\nsupporting their national priorities by increasing the \r\nvolume of official development assistance. Such aid \r\nshould be transparent and should respect the choices of \r\npeoples and their political priorities. \r\n We also emphasize the importance of helping \r\nthose countries to obtain technology at a reasonable \r\nprice; providing training opportunities and transferring \r\nknow-how and expertise in order to promote economic \r\ngrowth and sustainable development, thereby reducing \r\npoverty, hunger and disease; expanding trade \r\nopportunities for LDCs by opening world markets to \r\ntheir exports; helping them to deal with their foreign \r\ndebt; reducing the fluctuations in the prices of basic \r\nagricultural commodities; promoting the diversification \r\nof exports; reducing tariffs; and honouring the \r\ncommitments and recommendations made in the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action and the Cotonou \r\nStrategy. These are among the major components \r\nconsidered essential to ensure the success of the \r\ndevelopment efforts that the LDCs are making in the \r\nvarious fields. \r\n Since most people in the LDCs rely mainly on \r\nagriculture to earn a living, it is important to provide \r\nthe necessary financing and investment in this sector, \r\nas well as the technical means that would increase food \r\nand agricultural production in those countries. \r\n On the basis of the goals and policies adopted by \r\nthe African Union to bring about economic integration \r\namong African countries, and given the importance of \r\ninvesting the necessary means and resources for this \r\nintegration — which aims, first and foremost, to deal \r\nwith the issue of food security on the continent — my \r\ncountry organized a number of high-level meetings in \r\nwhich African experts discussed agriculture and water \r\nresource issues. As a result, specific recommendations \r\nfor overcoming difficulties and increasing production \r\ncapabilities in this sector have been made. \r\n Libya has also contributed to the establishment of \r\nfinancial institutions in the Sahel and sub-Saharan \r\ncountries to support them in their efforts to finance \r\nproduction and service projects in both the private and \r\npublic sectors. In addition, Libya, with a number of \r\nother African countries, is working to increase \r\ninvestment in ambitious agricultural and industrial \r\nprojects. It is also encouraging Libyan investors to \r\nincrease their investments in production in many \r\nAfrican countries. \r\n Lastly, my country calls on the international \r\ncommunity to fulfil its pledges to the LDCs. My \r\n A/61/PV.8\r\n \r\n63 06-52565 \r\n \r\ncountry would also like to take this opportunity to \r\nreaffirm its willingness to contribute to specific \r\nprogrammes that will help end poverty, hunger and \r\ndisease and enable those countries to develop the \r\neducational and health programmes necessary for their \r\nadvancement and their progress towards a better life. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Archbishop Celestino Migliore, chairman \r\nof the observer delegation of the Observer State of the \r\nHoly See. \r\n Archbishop Migliore (Holy See): Although both \r\nthe progress made by the least developed countries \r\n(LDCs) and the increased official development \r\nassistance (ODA) afforded them by partners are to be \r\nwarmly commended, there is a consensus that recent \r\ngrowth remains extremely vulnerable since it rests \r\nalmost entirely on the export of raw materials, \r\nespecially oil, and has not yet produced overall \r\nprogress in the reduction of poverty or in the \r\nimprovement of human well-being. The Holy See joins \r\nthose who have pointed out that this relative and \r\nfragile macroeconomic improvement must not distract \r\nus or prevent us from giving serious consideration to \r\nthe grave underlying problems that are as yet \r\nunresolved and that we must not lose sight of their \r\ndramatic urgency. \r\n We are faced today not only with the pressing \r\nmoral imperative of economic solidarity towards poor \r\ncountries, based on the unity of the human race and on \r\nthe equal dignity of all persons, but also with the \r\nurgent task of remedying a situation which, in the \r\nabsence of solutions that are effective, just and \r\nrespectful of human rights, could cause unacceptable \r\ndamage in the least developed countries and bring \r\nabout a state of permanent instability in the social \r\nfabric of developed countries. \r\n As is well known, the Catholic Church has \r\nundertaken many initiatives in the last decade aimed at \r\nbringing both its own members and all people of \r\ngoodwill to a greater awareness of their shared \r\nresponsibility vis-à-vis problems derived relating to \r\ninternational trade and finance. Today many of its \r\nmembers, from rich and poor countries alike, \r\nassociated in a wide variety of organizations, are \r\nengaged in favour of least developed countries. \r\nLikewise, through an extensive network of centres for \r\ntraining and health care, we are actively supporting the \r\nefforts of least developed countries at all levels. This is \r\ntaking place in the field of education at all levels, \r\nwhere future leaders learn about their respective \r\nresponsibilities. It is also happening in the context of a \r\nvast range of health-care services, from the struggle \r\nagainst child malnutrition to the care of the elderly and \r\nthe incurably ill. In that area, our institutions are \r\nmaking extensive and important contributions to the \r\nstruggle against AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. \r\n The Holy See continues to encourage the \r\ninternational community, especially the more \r\ndeveloped and medium-income countries, to support \r\nthe implementation of the Brussels Programme of \r\nAction and appeals for a surge of solidarity in favour \r\nof least developed countries. The world needs such a \r\nsurge of solidarity. The adoption of the measures \r\nproposed in the Cotonou Strategy may appear costly \r\nfor developing countries and their citizens, but they \r\nwill be less costly than the social burden that will \r\nweigh down those same countries in the medium term \r\nif the problems facing the least developed countries are \r\nnot resolved. \r\n Twenty years ago, public opinion was moved by \r\nthose who risked their lives to climb fences that kept \r\nthem the prisoners of dictatorial regimes. Today \r\nmillions are risking their lives to escape from the \r\ndictatorship of poverty. Fences will not stop them. For \r\ntheir own good and for the prosperity of all of us, \r\ndeveloped countries and least developed countries must \r\nimplement effective policies such as those found in the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action, so that the citizens of \r\nthe least developed countries will choose freely to \r\nremain at home, where they can obtain — for \r\nthemselves, their families and their country — \r\nemployment and living conditions that can truly be \r\ncalled dignified. \r\n The President: I give the floor to Mr. Luca \r\nDall’Oglio, Permanent Observer of the International \r\nOrganization for Migration. \r\n Mr. Dall’Oglio (International Organization for \r\nMigration): The International Organization for \r\nMigration (IOM) is committed to contributing, within \r\nits mandate and capacity, to the achievement of the \r\ngoals and objectives of the Brussels Programme of \r\nAction. In the past five years, we have devoted \r\nsignificant energy and resources to those goals, and we \r\nhave made it one of our priorities to collaborate closely \r\nwith the United Nations Office of the High \r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General for the Least \r\nA/61/PV.8  \r\n \r\n06-52565 64 \r\n \r\nDeveloped Countries, Landlocked Developing \r\nCountries and Small Island Developing States. The \r\nIOM has presented a detailed report on the \r\norganization’s contribution to the Brussels Programme \r\nof Action, which is posted on the website of the Office \r\nof the High Representative. \r\n The IOM is active in four out of the seven \r\nCommitments defined by the Brussels Programme, \r\nnamely commitments 2, 3, 4 and 7, in more than 20 \r\nleast developed countries. Allow me briefly to \r\nhighlight some of the key interventions in this regard. \r\n Commitment 3, on building human and \r\ninstitutional capacities, is one of the areas of the \r\nProgramme in which the IOM is more heavily \r\ninvolved. \r\n First, the Migration for Development in Africa \r\n(MIDA) programme that the IOM launched in 2001 is \r\nan institutional-capacity-building programme that aims \r\nto facilitate the transfer of the vital skills and resources \r\nof the African diaspora to their countries of origin. \r\nMIDA offers options for the reinvestment of human \r\ncapital, including temporary, long-term or virtual \r\nreturn. Equipped with the new competences, ideas and \r\nexpertise that they gained abroad, migrants can be a \r\ntremendous asset for the development of their countries \r\nof origin, as the debate held over the past few days and \r\nthe High-level Dialogue on Migration and \r\nDevelopment has confirmed. \r\n Secondly, through remittances, migrants working \r\nabroad can provide significant support to their families, \r\nleft behind in the source countries, and contribute to \r\nthe economic growth of their communities. Countries \r\nwith sizeable migrant populations are increasingly \r\ntaking steps to strengthen such remittance flows. The \r\nIOM is developing databases of diasporas that help \r\nGovernments better target investment opportunities for \r\ntheir expatriate population and plan recirculation \r\nopportunities to take advantage of the diaspora’s skills \r\nfor local development. \r\n In response to the growing importance of \r\nremittances and their development potential for least \r\ndeveloped countries, the IOM, in collaboration with the \r\nGovernment of Benin and the United Nations Office of \r\nthe High Representative, organized a two-day \r\nministerial conference on remittances to least \r\ndeveloped countries on 9 and 10 February 2006 in \r\nCotonou. The event brought together more than 90 \r\nparticipants from 32 least developed countries, \r\nobserver countries and international organizations, \r\nregional banks and civil society and diaspora \r\norganizations. The conference adopted a declaration to \r\noptimize the development benefits of remittances and \r\nmobilize support for its implementation. \r\n Finally, Commitment 7, on mobilizing financial \r\nresources, stresses a crucial point: the inclusion of \r\nmigration in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers \r\n(PRSPs). The interlinkages between migration and \r\ndevelopment are complex and can exacerbate existing \r\nchallenges to achieving national and international \r\ndevelopment goals. But migration can also yield \r\nconsiderable benefits for the development of the \r\ncountries of origin. In order to enhance such benefits, \r\ncountries of origin need to consider mainstreaming \r\npolicies that link migration and development into their \r\nnational planning and development strategies. At the \r\nsame time, integrating migration issues coherently into \r\nnational development strategies makes it possible more \r\neffectively to address challenges to national \r\ndevelopment arising out of migration. The opportunity \r\ncreated by the current review of PRSPs has led the \r\nIOM to request many African Heads of States and \r\nGovernment and development partners to promote the \r\nintegration of migration into PRSPs and national \r\ndevelopment plans of action. \r\n In closing, we would like to acknowledge the \r\ntireless efforts of the High Representative for the Least \r\nDeveloped Countries and his team and to express our \r\nsincere appreciation for their dedication and for the \r\ninclusiveness they have shown in their collaboration \r\nwith all concerned organizations. \r\n The President: I give the floor to Mrs. Florence \r\nMugasha, Deputy Secretary-General of the \r\nCommonwealth Secretariat. \r\n Mrs. Mugasha (Commonwealth Secretariat): As \r\nall members know, the Commonwealth comprises a \r\ndiverse group of States at various levels of social and \r\neconomic development. Our members include both \r\ndeveloped and developing countries. Thirty-two of our \r\n53 member countries are officially classified as small \r\nStates, 25 are small island developing States, 15 are \r\nleast developed countries (LDCs) and 6 are landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries. \r\n As a consequence, the Commonwealth is duty-\r\nbound to provide those countries with the assistance \r\nthey need to help their people emerge from debt and \r\npoverty and to achieve the Millennium Development \r\n A/61/PV.8\r\n \r\n65 06-52565 \r\n \r\nGoals (MDGs). We therefore support the initiatives set \r\nout in the United Nations Brussels Declaration of May \r\n2001 and its Programme of Action for LDCs for the \r\nDecade 2001-2010. \r\n I will briefly describe the Commonwealth’s work \r\nin relation to each of the seven commitments of the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action. \r\n With regard to Commitment 1, “Fostering a \r\npeople-centred policy framework”, the Commonwealth \r\nSecretariat recently launched its strategy to bridge the \r\ndigital divide: the Commonwealth Connects \r\nProgramme, aimed at using technology as a tool for \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Commitment 2 is entitled “Good governance at \r\nnational and international levels”. Through the \r\nCommonwealth’s Fund for Technical Cooperation, we \r\nprovide training to Government bodies and private-\r\nsector organizations in the areas of corporate \r\ngovernance, public-sector reform, combating \r\ncorruption, upholding standards in public service and \r\nprosecuting money-laundering and terrorist financing \r\noffences. \r\n With respect to Commitment 3, “Building human \r\nand institutional capacities”, the Commonwealth \r\nprovides specialists who give professional advice to \r\nLDCs in critical areas related to human development. \r\nIn particular, our work in the area of education focuses \r\non achieving universal primary education. In the field \r\nof health, we target HIV/AIDS reduction and \r\nprevention. In addition, we have established safeguards \r\nthrough the Commonwealth Code of Practice for the \r\nInternational Recruitment of Health and Education \r\nWorkers, which sets out guidelines that take into \r\naccount the potential impact of HIV/AIDS in the \r\ncountries of origin. \r\n Regarding Commitment 4, “Building productive \r\ncapacities to make globalization work for LDCs”, the \r\nquestion we seek to address is: how can LDCs attract \r\nthe foreign investment necessary to expand or create \r\nnew businesses? Our response has been in the form of \r\nthe Commonwealth Private Investment Initiative. Since \r\n1997, we have injected nearly $190 million into the \r\neconomies of LDCs under that Initiative. In sub-\r\nSaharan Africa, the fund has achieved impressive \r\nresults for investors. Second-generation funds are now \r\nbeing established, with a stronger focus on the small \r\nand medium enterprise sector. Moreover, many LDCs \r\nare engaged in the production and export of \r\nagricultural commodities. We are therefore \r\ncollaborating with them to formulate appropriate \r\nstrategies and to provide training in the areas of agro-\r\nprocessing, developing coastal fisheries, expanding \r\ntourism and reforming the regulatory environment. \r\n With regard to Commitment 5, “Enhancing the \r\nrole of trade in development”, the Commonwealth \r\nplaces trade advisers in LDCs to strengthen their \r\nnegotiating capacity in the World Trade Organization \r\n(WTO). For other countries, we have supported WTO \r\nmembership negotiations. \r\n Commitment 6 is entitled “Reducing \r\nvulnerability and protecting the environment”. The \r\nCommonwealth has worked with LDCs to implement \r\nthe Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation \r\nof the Programme of Action for the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States to \r\npromote sustainable forest management, to improve the \r\nlives of slum-dwellers and to build capacity to adapt to \r\nclimate change. \r\n Concerning Commitment 7, “Mobilizing financial \r\nresources”, our focus is not on raising additional funds, \r\nbut on debt cancellation. We have been in the vanguard \r\nof securing debt relief for highly indebted poor \r\ncountries, and our debt management software is now in \r\nuse in 54 Commonwealth and non-Commonwealth \r\ncountries. \r\n Finally, in our work to support the seven \r\ncommitments, we are also working with the World \r\nBank on small-State issues and are in the forefront of \r\nglobal efforts to accelerate the growth of LDCs. We \r\ncommend all those who are similarly engaged. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Ángel Carro Castrillo, chairman of the \r\nobserver delegation of the European Community. \r\n Mr. Castrillo (European Community): I am \r\nspeaking on behalf of Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner. \r\n I am pleased to address the General Assembly on \r\nbehalf of the European Community to reaffirm our \r\ncommitment to the implementation of the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action. We fully associate ourselves \r\nwith the statement made by the representative of \r\nFinland on behalf of the European Union. \r\n The United Nations Millennium Summit called \r\non partners to address the special needs of least \r\ndeveloped countries (LDCs) and to intensify efforts to \r\nA/61/PV.8  \r\n \r\n06-52565 66 \r\n \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\nLet me assure members that the development policy \r\nand the assistance of the European Community (EC) \r\nwill continue to strive to achieve the MDGs. The EC \r\nwill fulfil all of the commitments made at recent major \r\ninternational summits, including the Brussels \r\nConference. \r\n As international trade is vital for the development \r\nof LDCs and for the eradication of poverty, the EC \r\nattaches particular importance to its trade relations \r\nwith those countries. We were the first major trading \r\nbloc to commit to duty-free and quota-free access for \r\nLDC exports. We have fully supported the LDCs at \r\nDoha and the implementation of the World Trade \r\nOrganization’s work programme for LDCs. \r\n We deeply regret the suspension of the Doha \r\nDevelopment Round negotiations. That situation could \r\nhave been avoided if all members had shown sufficient \r\ncommitment and flexibility. The gaps between member \r\nStates were not unbridgeable; there was a window of \r\nopportunity for a reasonable and balanced deal that \r\nwould have delivered real economic benefits for all \r\nmembers. We did everything possible to maintain the \r\nmomentum. Unfortunately, that cannot be said of all \r\nmembers. We remain convinced that a recalibration of \r\nthe United States position would permit a fruitful \r\nresumption of the talks. The costs of the suspension of \r\nthe Doha Development Agenda negotiations are high, \r\nand the risk could be even higher if the talks do not \r\nresume soon. \r\n However, there was already much on offer in the \r\nDoha Development Round — much more than in \r\nprevious rounds — that now risks being lost: real cuts \r\nin tariffs in industry and agriculture in all developed \r\nand most large developing countries, and thus a major \r\nboost to world trade; duty-free, quota-free access to \r\nrich countries’ markets for the LDCs; greater \r\ninvestment and choice in the provision of services, \r\nwhich are the backbone of modern economies; an \r\nambitious agreement on trade facilitation; and, most \r\nimportant, fundamental reform of farm subsidies in \r\ndeveloped countries, which ultimately only the WTO \r\ncan deliver. Beyond that, there are important political \r\nand systemic implications for the multilateral trading \r\nsystem and the cause of multilateralism in general. \r\nWhat we now risk losing is far more significant than \r\nthe individual issues on which the negotiations have \r\nfoundered. \r\n In the short term, we should ensure that the \r\npoorest developing countries do not fall victim to the \r\ncurrent impasse. We should create an early harvest for \r\ntheir benefit by frontloading a significant development \r\npackage. First, we should push ahead with the Aid for \r\nTrade package because developing countries’ capacity \r\nconstraints remain unchanged. \r\n Secondly, we should put in place the new \r\nIntegrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical \r\nAssistance to least developed countries (IF). Thirdly, \r\nthe Hong Kong agreement on duty-free and quota-free \r\nmarket access should be fully implemented outside of \r\nthe Round and possibly improved. \r\n We remain fully committed to the Doha \r\nDevelopment Agenda. We remain committed to the \r\ncase for open markets, progressive trade liberalization \r\nand stronger multilateral rules, as a trigger for growth \r\nand development. In this spirit, we need to look ahead \r\nand to rebuild. The European Union, for its part, will \r\ndo its utmost to secure an early resumption of \r\nnegotiations and calls on its trading partners, in \r\nparticular, the major players, to make the necessary \r\nmoves to enable negotiations to restart. \r\n The President: I give the floor to the Honourable \r\nAnne Makinda, Deputy Speaker of the Parliament of \r\nthe United Republic of Tanzania, speaking on behalf of \r\nthe Inter-Parliamentary Union. \r\n Ms. Makinda (Inter-Parliamentary Union): In the \r\nfirst place, I would like to congratulate you, Madam \r\nPresident, on your election. I would also like to \r\ncongratulate my colleagues for all the speeches that \r\nhave been made since this morning. I am the last \r\nspeaker but I really have very different issues to \r\ndiscuss. We have been talking about successes and \r\nless-than-successes with regard to the least developed \r\ncountries (LDCs) in the context of Government \r\nactions. Now, I speak on the part of the real people, \r\nwho are supposed to be the beneficiaries and who are \r\nthe real actors in this programme. \r\n I am honoured to address you all today on behalf \r\nof the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU). I am a member \r\nof parliament from one of the LDCs, the United \r\nRepublic of Tanzania, and this debate offers me the \r\nopportunity to explain how, at the parliamentary level, \r\nboth globally and nationally, we can advance the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action in the next five years \r\nand beyond. \r\n A/61/PV.8\r\n \r\n67 06-52565 \r\n \r\n The United Nations Secretary-General’s report, \r\nwhich concluded the year-long review process, \r\nprovides many clues as to the actual state of affairs in \r\nthe LDCs on many fronts, including the political and \r\neconomic areas. We share the view that progress in the \r\nLDCs is occurring, but at too slow a pace. What is \r\nneeded is both a qualitative and a quantitative leap \r\nforward if we are to raise living standards and lower \r\ninequalities in countries where the vast majority of \r\npeople still live without basic necessities and are \r\nsimply denied the opportunity to earn a decent living, \r\nsend their children to school, fight disease, live in \r\npeace and in a clean and safe environment, and \r\nparticipate in decision-making. \r\n We have learned during this session and read in \r\nthe report of the Secretary-General about many good \r\nideas to help the LDCs. We support all of them. But, \r\nfor the IPU, a political organization devoted to \r\nstrengthening democracy and good governance, the \r\ncrux of the matter comes down to this — the LDCs will \r\nonly be able to mobilize their own human, natural and \r\nfinancial resources for development, and make the best \r\nof external support, when their principal decision-\r\nmaking organ, parliament, assumes its rightful role in \r\nthe development process. \r\n In spite of some progress in recent years — with \r\nmore regular and fairer elections and an overall \r\nimprovement in the performance of parliaments — \r\nLDC parliaments are still very far from being able to \r\nexercise effective oversight of Government action and \r\nto perform their legislative and budgetary roles. \r\nDistortions in the political process have thus impacted \r\nthe economic and social domains, providing at least \r\nsome of the explanation as to why income poverty \r\nremains basically the same as five years ago in most \r\nLDCs, in spite of higher economic growth. \r\n As we heard again last Friday, at a parliamentary \r\ndebate that the IPU and the Office of the High \r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General for the Least \r\nDeveloped Countries, Landlocked Developing \r\nCountries and Small Island Developing States \r\norganized here at the United Nations, the truth is that \r\nparliaments in many LDCs continue to be confronted \r\nwith a series of grave difficulties, foremost among \r\nwhich is the overbearing attitude of the executive \r\nbranch, in some countries backed by the military. \r\nIndeed, many LDC parliaments continue to suffer the \r\nlegacy of being a rubber stamp. They are also plagued \r\nby inefficient practices and working methods and lack \r\nof cooperation with civil society. There is also a \r\ndisconnect between the people and their representatives \r\nand the latter are not always seen as articulating the \r\ninterests of the former. In addition, independent media \r\norganizations, properly acquainted with parliamentary \r\nprocedures, are scarce, making it difficult to have a \r\nbalanced and fair view of parliamentary proceedings. \r\n Underlying all that is a lack of resources and \r\nskills to empower parliaments and their members. \r\nResources are critically needed to acquaint newly \r\nelected parliamentarians with the rudiments of their \r\njob, hire qualified support staff for constituency and \r\nlegislative offices, build infrastructure like \r\nparliamentary libraries and research services, and \r\nenable parliaments to broadcast what goes on within \r\ntheir walls to the outside public. In this connection, the \r\npotential offered by the new information and \r\ncommunications technologies still needs to be \r\nharnessed with a view to achieving greater efficiency. \r\n The IPU has devoted a great deal of time and \r\neffort to improving governance and building capacities \r\nin the spirit of Commitments II and III of the Brussels \r\nProgramme. Technical assistance programmes have \r\nbeen developed in support of parliaments in countries \r\nsuch as Afghanistan, Burundi, Ethiopia, Equatorial \r\nGuinea, and Rwanda, with a view to improving their \r\nfunctioning both internally and vis-à-vis constituents \r\nand the executive branch. Regional seminars have been \r\nconducted in Africa and Asia in a number of areas, \r\nsuch as the incorporation of the provisions of \r\ninternational treaties and other instruments into \r\nnational law, or the more active participation of women \r\nin political life. They have also focused on the role of \r\nparliaments in promoting sustainable development and \r\nsecurity sector reform. \r\n The IPU is also working hard to raise the bar of \r\nwhat constitutes a democratic parliament. In this \r\nrespect, a comprehensive study was recently published, \r\nentitled “Parliament and Democracy in the Twenty-\r\nFirst Century: a Guide to Good Practice”. Based in part \r\non a worldwide survey of parliaments, to which several \r\nLDC parliaments contributed, this practical tool for \r\nparliamentarians and practitioners alike provides the \r\nmain elements for parliaments to measure their own \r\nperformance with respect to five key principles — \r\nrepresentation, transparency, accessibility, \r\naccountability and effectiveness. The guide offers a \r\ngolden opportunity to highlight success stories in \r\nA/61/PV.8  \r\n \r\n06-52565 68 \r\n \r\nparliaments’ endeavours to promote democracy and \r\ngood governance. \r\n If the parliamentary institution is central to good \r\ngovernance and democracy, and by extension to \r\ndevelopment in the LDCs, it follows that more needs to \r\nbe done to support parliaments. We in the international \r\ncommunity must join forces and take full advantage of \r\nour complementarities to help focus more attention on \r\nthe needs of LDC parliaments in the next five years. \r\nThree practical steps should be urgently considered. \r\n First, as a matter of policy, the international \r\ncommunity needs to increase its technical assistance to \r\nparliaments as a share of total funding. Donors must be \r\nmore focused on the critical role of parliaments in the \r\nfurther development of the LDCs and in the attainment \r\nof the Brussels Programme. It is critically important \r\nthat funds meant to build the capacities of parliaments \r\nbe given to, and managed directly by, them, thereby \r\nfacilitating their transition towards greater \r\nindependence from the executive branch. That does not \r\npreclude the need to ensure accountable management \r\nof such resources. \r\n Secondly, together with the United Nations, we \r\nmust work to ensure that the national development \r\nstrategies that the Secretary-General’s report invites \r\nLDC Governments to put in place are truly owned and \r\ndriven by the people through the parliamentary \r\nprocess. The same applies, of course, to poverty  \r\n \r\nreduction strategy papers. The IPU made a contribution \r\nin that regard last year, when it encouraged the \r\nparliaments of LDCs to participate in the preparation \r\nof national reports as a first step towards the midterm \r\ncomprehensive review of the Brussels Programme. \r\n Thirdly, it is important that parliaments, and not \r\nonly Governments and international agencies, be seen \r\nincreasingly as actors in building South-South, as well \r\nas North-South, cooperation. We should not \r\nunderestimate the importance of inter-parliamentary \r\ncooperation at the regional level, which in some cases \r\nis already bearing fruit. We need to help parliaments to \r\nlearn from each other. \r\n In all of that, the IPU stands ready to assist with \r\nits expertise and direct access to parliaments \r\nthemselves. Together with the United Nations and its \r\ndevelopment programmes, now including the new \r\nDemocracy Fund, the IPU will continue to engage and \r\nwork closely with LDCs in their quest for democracy \r\nand development. \r\n The President: We have heard the last speaker in \r\nthe High-level Meeting on the midterm comprehensive \r\nglobal review of the implementation of the Programme \r\nof Action for the Least Developed Countries for the \r\nDecade 2001-2010. \r\n The General Assembly will consider draft \r\nresolution A/61/L.2 tomorrow morning at 9 o’clock. \r\n  The meeting rose at 10.10 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
