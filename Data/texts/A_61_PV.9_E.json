The report \r\nof the preparatory meeting has been issued as \r\ndocument A/61/323 and is before the Assembly. \r\n I would be grateful if draft resolution A/61/L.2 \r\nwere adopted by the High-level Meeting by consensus. \r\n The President: The Assembly will now take a \r\ndecision on draft resolution A/61/L.2, entitled \r\n“Declaration of the high-level meeting of the sixty-first \r\nsession of the General Assembly on the midterm \r\ncomprehensive global review of the implementation of \r\nthe Programme of Action for the Least Developed \r\nCountries for the Decade 2001-2010”. \r\n May I take it that the Assembly wishes to adopt \r\ndraft resolution A/61/L.2? \r\n Draft resolution A/61/L.2 was adopted (resolution \r\n61/1). \r\n The President: I give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Benin. \r\n Mr. Aho-Glele (Benin) (spoke in French): The \r\nPresident of the Republic of Benin, who holds the \r\nchairmanship of the Bureau of Least Developed \r\nCountries, was to be present here in order to give his \r\naddress. However, due to traffic problems, he cannot \r\nA/61/PV.9  \r\n \r\n06-52725 2 \r\n \r\nattend and therefore has asked me to read out the \r\nfollowing statement. \r\n  “We have now reached the end of the High-\r\nlevel Meeting on the midterm comprehensive \r\nglobal review of the Programme of Action for the \r\nleast developed countries for the decade 2001-\r\n2010. \r\n  “In line with our commitments, and in \r\nresponse to the challenges of today’s world, we \r\nhave combined our efforts and worked in a \r\nresponsible and proactive manner to carry out a \r\nrigorous analysis of the implementation of the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action. \r\n  “We have also, most importantly, together \r\ncharted the course for the next five years by \r\nidentifying together ways and means of \r\neffectively reaching the goals set out in the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action within the \r\nestablished time frames. \r\n  “I would like to pay tribute to all \r\ndelegations for their commitment and thank them \r\nfor their efforts. Such hard work was only to be \r\nexpected, as our debate will influence the fate of \r\nmillions of people — the most vulnerable \r\nsegment of the international community. \r\n  “I would also like to welcome the adoption \r\nof the Declaration, a fitting outcome to our work, \r\nwhich reflects a balanced consensus and will \r\nprovide us with guidance as we continue the \r\nimplementation of the Brussels Programme of \r\nAction over the next five years. \r\n  “In this context, I welcome the contribution \r\nmade by the least developed countries \r\nthemselves, which, conscious of their primary \r\nresponsibility with regard to their own \r\ndevelopment, drafted and adopted, following the \r\nMinisterial Conference held from 5 to 8 June \r\n2006 in Cotonou, Benin, the Cotonou Strategy, \r\nwhich sets out the progress achieved and \r\nobstacles encountered during the past five years \r\nin the implementation of the Brussels Programme \r\nof Action, including concrete recommendations \r\non how to overcome those problems, with a view \r\nto achieving, in a comprehensive manner and \r\nwithin the time frame established, the seven \r\ncommitments set out therein. \r\n  “In our globalized and interdependent \r\nworld, no initiative can be successful and \r\nproductive if it is not undertaken in the context of \r\nconcerted and complementary efforts. I therefore \r\nappeal, on behalf of the group of least developed \r\ncountries, to all the parties involved in \r\nimplementing the Brussels Programme of Action, \r\nto redouble their efforts and to contribute, each in \r\nits own way, to ensuring that every human being \r\ncan live a life in dignity and prosperity, free from \r\nhunger and extreme poverty. \r\n  “Long live international cooperation for \r\ndevelopment!” \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): We are coming \r\nto the end of the High-level Meeting of the General \r\nAssembly on the midterm comprehensive global \r\nreview of the implementation of the Programme of \r\nAction for the Least Developed Countries for the \r\nDecade 2001-2010. \r\n This meeting has enabled us to provide the \r\ninternational community with information about the \r\nprogress made towards achieving the Programme’s \r\ngoals and overcoming the challenges that it has faced. \r\n The review process has been extensive. We have \r\nconducted national, regional and international \r\nconsultations, culminating in this High-level Meeting. \r\nThrough that comprehensive review process, we \r\ngenerated a deeper understanding of the issues \r\ninvolved and reaffirmed our commitment to the \r\nBrussels Declaration and Programme of Action.  \r\n The Declaration that we have adopted today \r\nreaffirms our commitment to combating poverty. We \r\nare optimistic about the commitment of all parties, \r\ncivil society, non-governmental organizations and the \r\nprivate sector to making efforts to strengthen \r\npartnerships that allow the international community to \r\nact more effectively with a view to achieving the seven \r\ncommitments set out in the Programme of Action. \r\n The challenges before us remain daunting, and \r\ntime is of the essence. As the Declaration states, if \r\ncurrent trends continue, most of the least developed \r\ncountries will be able to achieve neither the objectives \r\nof the Programme of Action nor the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. \r\n I therefore call upon all members to rise to the \r\nchallenge and to redouble their collective efforts to \r\n A/61/PV.9\r\n \r\n3 06-52725 \r\n \r\neffect a dramatic and urgent change in the lives of the \r\npoorest and most vulnerable people in the world. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n The General Assembly has thus concluded the \r\nHigh-level Meeting on the midterm comprehensive \r\n \r\n global review of the implementation of the Programme \r\nof Action for the Least Developed Countries for the \r\nDecade 2001-2010 and this stage of its consideration \r\nof agenda item 56 (a). \r\n  The meeting rose at 9.25 a.m. \r\n"
